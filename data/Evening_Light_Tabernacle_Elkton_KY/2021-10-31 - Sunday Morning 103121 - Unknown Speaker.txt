========================================

children can be dismissed for sunday school we'll just turn in the psalms to psalms 119 we're gonna read verse 129 we're going to stop at verse 144. it's gonna be a beautiful day today we just wanna worship the lord and truth and it sure is good to be in the house of the lord this morning psalms 119 starting in verse 129 thy testimonies are wonderful therefore doeth my soul keepeth them i opened my mouth and painted for i longed for thy commandments order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me make thy face to shine upon thy servant and teach me thy statutes righteous art thou o lord and upright are thy judgments my seal hath consumed me because my enemies have forgotten my words i am small and despised yet do not i forget thy precepts trouble and anguish have taken hold on me yet thy commandments are my delights the righteous of the testimonies of everlasting give me understanding and i shall live god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters hey you would you can turn to the 138th psalm but i was just going to go to this 131st verse here it says i open my mouth and i paint it for our long for thy commandments and the thing that just struck my heart is without mentioning water or the water of life david is talking to us as disciples telling us that the word of god is the living water that we all desire to drink from but turning to the 138th psalm here it's not a very long time i don't know it's been you know it's been several years you know i was um i even got notes from years ago when we i talked here about this but i have that book i don't know if some of you do or not uh from jaw uh mr spurgeon charles spurgeon and he has he does an in-depth study of all 150 psalms and uh i was reading his writing how he explains things and i was thinking you know he we're talking to the guy that was on the face of the earth maybe 130 140 years ago before brother branham was even here and some of the truths that he talks about and i was just thinking this morning you know don't be by people out there in the world you know i'm not afraid and i know you're not afraid to tell someone that you believe the message of the hour and that you believe brother adam was a prophet for the age that we live in but i will have you know a lot of these preachers you hear on the radio and the ones that you interact with if you go into their study they'll have spurgeon's writings all over the place and the difference between you and them is that you don't have to have footnotes because you're not afraid to tell people where you get your truths from where you're getting your inspiration from but if you listen to a lot of messages out there if you read old the old fathers in the in christianity whether it's wesley or spurgeon or anyone else you can hear the theme from the preachers you know what they're doing in their studies they're opening a book aspersion or they're open one of wesley's he has a series of his preaching that he preached you know where they're going to get their inspiration from they just they're just not telling you where they're getting their the messages they're right now from but if they were professors without the footnotes they wouldn't have a job so don't be afraid of letting people know what you believe or who who you believe in or what you believe shouldn't be afraid are they going to laugh at you you have no control over that and i know as as men and women i only can speak for men you know no one likes to be ridiculed no one likes to be made fun of but if you know what you believe is the truth no matter what people say to you you might not like it your flesh won't like it but you have nothing to fear or nothing to be afraid of and you know that's the age that we live in um i haven't even got started the age that we live in is trying to bind you into a position when you're afraid to tell the people that you interact with every day what you believe or how you feel it's the very age that we live in is trying to bind people so they are afraid to speak what they believe or tell people what they but so i'm not using the terms they use out there in the world but that's the way it is trying to bind everybody into one image and you just gotta refuse to have people tie you up in their ideology or in their truth just don't be afraid to speak what you believe and that's the problem right now you know you i talked you know spending all those years in the middle east you know seeing what islam is like in the middle east i don't know why i'm going here yet you know being around islamic people being around muslims all my life seeing how they are and how they interact with their populations i've always known when you have populations that have a muslim population over 80 percent i can guarantee you they will not tolerate any other religion or any other way of life other than their way life this is true they are they believe in what they believe in so dogmatically that they won't allow anyone else to have another opinion and you see it whether it's islam whether it's hindu whether it's any religion that binding you as a christian where you can't say what you think about that religion or about that way well it's in the same in a secular way they're trying to bind you or you can't say that this behavior is wrong or that behavior is right it's the age that we're living you just got to push it away and not conform to it i mean doesn't mean that everyone's going to like you you can't make people like you but i'd rather have god like me then be friends with everyone else but uh i'll just read the psalm here you know i do enjoy reading spurgeon's writings you know uh before we moved up here we were still in the old trump church and uh brother andy's older brother andy's was down there and he he kind of said the same thing he he read a portion out of uh brother spurgeon's writings and one of the things that he said that day was the ministers in your denominational churches brother spurgeon said without holiness no man is going to see god it's without holiness and now of course the world out there when you say that they mean that's holiness of the heart but once you've got god inside your heart it should be manifesting itself in your life you can't have one without the other does that mean a christian that's only been served in the lord a few months is going to be automatically changed and doing right no but from the inside out your life should be changing day after day year after year you shouldn't be the same mold of clay you were 20 years ago you should be different in everything as you move on but i'll just read the psalm this morning it's only eight verses i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy love and kindness and for thy truth for thou is magnify thy word above all all thy name in the day when i cried thou answered me and strengthens me with strength in my soul and all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the lord i yet he have respect onto the lowly you know that's an important thought right there no matter where you're at i don't care how low you are if you're laying on the street poor and you can't beat yourself from that state all the way to the richest person in the world god cares about you the lord yah yet he respects unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth a far off you know you can be a rich man and still be a christian but that but david's or a poor man still be a christian it's it that has nothing to do with it it's a relationship with jesus christ and out of that relationship whether you have wealth or don't have wealth you're going to use it for the kingdom of god and he goes though i walk in the midst of trouble that will the thou stretcheth forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies and my right hand shall save me the lord will perfect that which concerneth me the mercy o lord and excuse me thy mercy o lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine hands and i was gonna just go back to these first two verses this morning uh before i go go on another tangent here but uh he talks about the first thing the second verse i will worship toward thy holy temple and i will praise thine i am in love and kindness for thy truth as thou magnify thy word is above all thy name and then i would just say david said in this first verse i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing pray so that goes back a little bit earlier what i was saying uh no matter where you're at i don't false gods no matter what situations out there in the world you shouldn't be afraid to praise the lord in any given situation no matter whether they ridicule you make fun of you no matter what they do to you but let me uh i was gonna go to a scripture i don't know you know we that temple you know the word of god that temple um is i'll just turn here real quick the one thing i have learned my whole life the more time you give the lord in your life the more time you give him spend with him the better off you are the further you get away from the worse you are but uh i'll just this goes to the you know the temple of god is pretty simple and i'll just read what it says and i this is the 20 you don't have to turn here i know i'm jumping all over the place but the 21st verse of revelation it says and this is speaking for the time to come and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more seed and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as the bride to adorn her husband heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god so i've said this before we know who everything that god was i don't have to say you already know in your minds everything that god was he poured into christ and what christ is you could see the direct representation in the scriptures or in your life whatever god was christ was and what christ was he wants you to be it's a pretty simple thought right there you know don't be afraid of what you believe and who you are there's more than a you know what is it they say you'd be surprised how many people that you run across that though you see you might see something hard on the outside something shallow on the outside but you don't know what god's doing on the inside brothers brother david amen you love him this morning with all your heart i mean let's stand if we could this morning and it's just good to be here this morning and good to have we get still got some home folks gone uh sister martin several of their family is coming back from a youth camp so we want to remember them as they travel but man was good to have the colby and sister kaylee here this morning god bless you it's just good to see each and every one and i'm just just thankful for the lord this morning aren't you and i i begin to think is brother brian began to speak and things was on my heart this morning and just thought it's amazing how god just speaks to all of us and none of us know what the other one's going to say or what we're going to do and you know it's such a beautiful day outside and i thought you know and you look around and it's a beautiful day

you know there's nothing in the world they can do better than doing something for the lord they might have the most home runs they might make the most touchdowns but there will be nothing more glorious than what they do for the lord jesus this morning i almost forgot something this morning today's national holiday sister sarah's birthday and i almost forgot that and you know i was talking to a friend of mine the other day and i asked him how retirement was he said it's horrible and i thought you know and the older we get and i was thinking this morning when i got my foot fixed my left one now my right ones my heels hurting i can't hardly walk i thought well just like an old car you just patch it up and hope it runs a few more miles till we get our new body one of these days and hey man then we'll what will it be when we get over yonder it's just hard to imagine can you really imagine waking up not having a pain a worry or anything that you got to worry about that day just no pain the only people that have to deal with pain is young people most of the time but the older you get this hand hurts today and this one feels sorry tomorrow because you didn't give it as much affection as this one but i'm glad we're going to the city where we'll never grow old little joe there'll never be no more diabetes and no be no more cancer no more pain no more suffering and most of all we'll be with the one that died for us our lord jesus we'll get to look upon his face and spend eternity together amen let's sing that little course what a day that will be as brother brad comes this morning give brother brad your undivided attention this morning that the lord might come and speak to our hearts this morning and what a day that will be oh when my jesus i shall see and when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and when he takes me by [Music] what a day a glorious day that will be once again as brother brad comes this morning oh what a day that will be always my jesus i shall see and when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his race [Music] [Music] no more [Music] glorious day that will be amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning you happy to be a christian amen amen i tell you we've we've had some good thoughts come across the pulpit lately and the attributes of god and thanking musicians i appreciate it um your gifts for the lord is greatly appreciated so uh the attributes of god and uh the evidence of the holy ghost and some of the things we've been talking about and brother byler and so god certainly been good god certainly seems to be preparing preparing people and so with that in mind i hope you come expecting this morning did you come expecting because if you come expecting this morning and you come desiring something from god god is obligated that's an obligation he has to meet if you've prayed and you come expecting and you've got your cup up and say god i'll need something from you i want you to to pour out your spirit in me god he's obligated to do that so i trust you've come expecting this morning i want to turn if we could into the bible this morning in the book of galatians now you're probably thinking we're going to go to genesis wouldn't you no not genesis we're going to go to galatians so galatians chapter 5. we're going to take a little thought out of there and i want to just speak on walking in the spirit this morning galatians 5 and 16 is where we will where we'll go brother mike i seem to be getting a lot of rebound i don't know if it's coming through the monitors or or what but you might look at that galatians 5 and 16. this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so how do we overcome the flesh we walk in the spirit simple right not so much let's read the next one for the flesh lusteth against the spirit hell we got a battle going now we constantly are in a battle if we're in this life we're battling so the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now that's a great place to be right there led by the spirit so that the law does not rule your life none of us can make it on the merits of ourself and none of us can make it on law if you think you can make it on law i'm afraid you're going to be surprised now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness that means lustful sexual desire if you didn't know what that means idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things what's to say shall not inherit the kingdom of god and paul has told him this at least twice he said i've told you this before and i'm going to tell you again if you're participating and partaking of these things you're not going to make it into the kingdom of god now if we stop right there we're all in trouble but thank god there's more to the word and paul says but the fruit of the spirit notice that the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance and against such there is no law that's a big that's a mouthful right there there is no law and they that are that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vainglory provoking one another envied one another amen let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us lord to opportunity to come and fellowship into your house this morning and just fellowship around the word of god and the breath of life as we partake of it lord and lord as we're looking at these thoughts this morning and walking in the spirit we see the importance of being able to dedicate our lives in such a way that you can move in our vessels and fulfill all of these lord jesus we don't want to be those partaking of the things of this evil world and the things that's going on because we can't make it that way we can't make it on law we need we need love we need grace we need long suffering we need meekness gentleness kindness we need all those things lord and we ask or that you would just break it down this morning for us and and help us to see where we're at in the in the word and then the message of the hour and where we're at in your program god and lord this message is to help us to grow is to help us to to learn and to get closer to you father as our hearts desire is to be close to you father and to be uh first in your program lord we just want to tell you we love you we appreciate you we lift up our pastor this morning and just ask you touch his body would you restore his health to him and lord just give him a great day of rest that he could be himself again this week and lord we just ask lord that you just bless this church in a mighty way lord as our hearts are to draw close to you and to make that rapture that's our number one goal we can't miss it we cannot miss it lord and we know that we love you lord and give your honor praise and glory in jesus name amen you can have your seats i'm going to try not to hold you but i told sister joyce i said i tell you what i you know in my mind you think you've got a thought and you think you're gonna go one direction and then it goes in another and you think man you think i'm gonna it's gonna be good today we're gonna you know we're gonna get with it and then all of a sudden you're thinking man i just want to get off the platform so it's one of those you feel like you could just throw your notes in the air pick them up and go and and i'm not going to throw my nose in there i'm not that bold but we are just going to try to pick it up and go but we look at this and we look at these scriptures here and and we begin to think and we find out many times people try to produce and they try to manufacture so to speak their christian behaviors so they try to manufacture love they want to have the appearance of love they want to have the appearance of gentleness they want to have the the appearance of of peace they want people to think they are that but deep down inside sometimes they're not being able to to produce it and push it out naturally through the spirit of god but they're producing it on the flesh and as an image they're putting out before the people and the prophet tells us in this in this little story here he says you know a sheep is a very sensitive and odd animal he said you know the sheep never was asked to manufacture wool but he was asked to bear wool because he's a sheep and as long as he's a sheep he will bear wool because that's his nature and so it is with the christian church we're never asked to manufacture fruits he said we're asked to bear fruit he says galatians 5 says the fruit of the spirit is love joy faith peace long suffering meekness gentleness patience these are not to be manufactured no he says but these are products that come from the inside out they come from here they come from the inside out and he says the outside life that we live proves what's on the inside he said now we have tried to manufacture this we've tried to manufacture the fruits of the spirit and we always turn out hypocrisy he said because you can't manufacture christianity he said it's an experience by a spirit that lives in you and it bears the fruit itself you can't manufacture we've tried to educate it he said we tried to denominate it and we turn out hypocrisy and failure and it's not to be done that way don't try it is what he's saying don't try to do it that way it's going to produce failure in your life it's going to produce an image that shows hypocrisy in your life but let let the spirit of god live through you and do it god's way he says it's to be done as god intended it to be done the spirit inside bearing fruits of his presence and that's god's program and it can never be changed so i want to look this morning at the fruit of the spirit or walking in the spirit and brothers and sisters i believe that god is putting the finishing touches on his church i believe that there is a bride of jesus christ that has got to come to the fullness of who she is i believe that there is a bride that has to be fully identified with her place in the word in the message of the hour i believe that she has to be able to uh place herself in that word she has to be filled with a spirit and i believe she has to be able to operate under the authority of jesus christ a lot of times we want to operate as christians but why are we operating under the authority of jesus christ let me tell you what the difference is he said that there he said i found there's two classes of people he said i've found that there's fundamentalists and he said and on the other hand there's pentecostals so we can look back into the 50s and 60s right when he was preaching this and we realized the two groups of people that he was right in the middle with and he was being pulled in different directions and on one hand you had the fundamentalists that had the word they had the scripture they had the doctrine they had everything and on the other hand he had the pentecostals who had the spirit they had the movements they had the gifts and they had all these things taking place but he says there's two people there and he said the fundamentalists pers positionally don't know where they are positionally they know where they stand but they have never received the holy ghost we've got to be careful when we get that we don't get so uh uh so much it's hard to say it this way but we don't put so much emphasis on the doctrines that we forget the one who gave the doctrines we got to be able to associate with the spirit that gave the word as well as we do the word as it came so he said it's fundamentalist they got the word but they never received the holy ghost they haven't got faith hmm they haven't got faith he said that's right in the pentecostals he says they've received the holy ghost but positionally they don't know who they are so here he's talking about two groups of people it says let me liken it to you like this he said it's like a man who's got all the money in the bank he could want but he can't write a check he's got all the money he could he could buy the world over but yet he doesn't know how to write the check maybe he doesn't know how to sign his name he doesn't know how to fill out a check he said but then you got on the other hand you got somebody that can write a check but ain't got no money in the bank the two different people here now watch what he says he says you could get if you could get them both together you'd have it settled see what i say you got to have the importance of the fundamentals of the doctrine and the spirit they have to coexist together they have to go together they have to dovetail together he says if we can get those two together he said if you can get the pentecostal faith and the fundamental church and the fundamental teaching in the pentecostal church you'd have it made is that you're right then the great church of god would stand to its feet so you're telling me that if they could have come to agreeance doctrine and spirit if god could have moved on both of them and got them both together right then and there there would have been a movement that would have caused the church to stand and rise to its feet and here we are in 2021 and we're still treading on this on this ground that there hasn't been a rapture to take place is this the two things that's holding us up doctrine and spirit we've got to get the two together so that they dovetail together he says listen he says when the two come together you have a right you have a god-given privilege to every divine promise in the book and it's yours he said i know that truth by experience so let me ask you this morning would you agree with me and say that you want an endless supply of god this morning would you agree with me this morning and say god all that you are all that you ever was and all that you ever will be god it's my desire that you would pour it out on to me this morning so that god so that i could look at this and be a mirror image of you lord so that god that when i look at myself i can see that i've got the very same attributes as you god the father that ought to be our desire that god would give us everything he was and last time i spoke i spoke on the evidence of the holy ghost and by their fruits you shall know them so this morning why don't we spend a little time as we look at these fruits and spend a little time and look at those fruits and see what makes up those fruits what exactly is it that goes into this fruit that paul's talking about what is it that paul is trying to tell us now if i ask you what comes to your mind when you see this apple you see the apple everybody in this building has got a thought of what that apple is so in your mind maybe you're thinking i like apples maybe you're thinking you know apples are good apples are tasty apples are sweet apples are crunchy apples are juicy apples are refreshing whatever it is it don't matter it's not it's not it's not a test don't don't get stuck up on me but in your mind you have a thought of exactly an image of what that apple is and what it's supposed to be to you and god has the same kind of thoughts when he looks down he has the same kind of thoughts of what the image of a holy ghost field fundamentally sound christian should look like only he's not looking at apples he's looking at children the only other difference is his opinion doesn't change the way your opinion is different or this one's different maybe you don't like apples god loves his children so god is looking at this and he says if i can look down here i want to get the image of these just right and so paul talks about this in the book of galatians in chapter five as we read and it's important to know that as paul wrote this letter he wrote this letter to the galatians and this letter has been called the declaration of independence of christian liberty that's what scholars i'm no bible scholar i just read and research that's what they say this letter is it's the declaration of independence of christian liberty martin luther he loved this letter and i heard brother brian talking about the different ones a different spurgeon and luther and all these different ones but he says he was so passionate about this letter and he he says i call the galatian letter my catherine von bora that was his wife and he named the the book of goliath or the letter of the galatians catherine von bohr because he says i'm married to this letter this letter is so important i'm married to it this letter is a letter that is a passionate letter it's an outpouring of the soul of a preacher who's on fire for the lord paul and he's pouring out his heart and he's trying to get the deeply commitment committed here is to understand about the faith and faith of christ and he's pouring out his heart this letter brothers and sisters is the written proof from the apostle paul that every believer has been set free that every believer and the message of the hour that every believer everybody that calls upon the name of christ and lives a christian life that the bondage has been broken for them and they can live the life of a spirit-filled believer are you with me paul says at the very first of galatians chapter five the first thing he says is stand fast stand fast therefore in the liberty by which christ has made us free so the truth is that jesus christ has made us free and we're not to live in a bondage to jesus christ we're not to have to follow a legal relationship with jesus christ and i believe if we ever get that thought through to believers across the across the world we'll find the spirit of god moving in such a mighty way because it's so easy to want to have the do's and the don'ts and it's so easy to follow and listen and say well he said he said he said he said but he also said god is love he says the fruits of the spirit are and god is love he listed them he didn't he didn't say that we had to be under such bond and paul is bringing that out to this people of galatia because they lived under such law that paul said you'll never make it you'll never make it if you keep living like you're living and god is constantly trying to reach out to us god is constantly reaching out and he's pleading with us and god is reaching up and saying take my hand you need my strength and let me tell you it don't matter how deep a pitch you're in i watched a little story on the facebook showed up in the last day or so and it kind of went along with this and it was over spain or somewhere like that they were speaking it looked like spanish looked like spain somewhere along that line there and a small child had fallen down into the well shaft and these these rescuers were just frantic they were in a panic and they had backhoes and trackhoes and they were digging beside it and they were looking down with lights and you could hear that baby down in there crying and they're wondering what are we going to do what are we going to do how are we going to get down there i'm talking feet down there they were just letting rope down one after another and you could see i couldn't understand a word they were saying but you could see the picture no doubt it was a young child's daddy and he was crying and he was frantic and he was and he walked over and he ran over to this young boy and he was talking to him and just giving it all to him that he could and that boy shook his head this little boy is 14 years old just wiry and stringy are you with me they called the little boy over he shook his head yes they put a harness around his waist and tied the rope around his feet as tight as i could they lowered that little boy down into that well shaft feet after feet after feet after feet after feet and they shh hush everybody hush then they started pulling back up one after another one after another and you see the young 14 year old boy feet come and they pull up you know what he's got to hold in his hands he's got a hope to their little infant he's got to hold that and that's what god does us he doesn't care how far down in the pit we go you'll send whatever it takes to pull us out and he'll go to the depths of the sea to get you where you need to be the little 14 year old boy was a hero [Music] god don't forget us wherever we're at so god is constantly reaching out and he says take my hand you need my strength and walk in the freedom that i've got and don't get entangled in the yoke of bondage again do you think that little boy was ever going to go back and look into that shaft again i'm sure that little boy learned his lesson i'm sure he looked like a curiosity about got the best of him but he's not going to go back down into that same thing that got him in the bondage he was in and brother and sister we don't make ourself free we we try but we can't make ourselves free because freedom is a gift of jesus christ and every service we have to bring jesus christ into the picture or we're missing it because without jesus christ we don't exist without jesus christ we have no freedom because freedom was paid on the cross of calvary freedom was a painful price freedom was a humiliating price but yet this freedom is given to us freely what a loving god he is what a loving god he is so why do we try to free ourselves you know when we try to free ourselves we find ourselves getting in deeper entanglement than we was to begin with yeah we try to do things our way we try to cut a little corner here or there and say well god probably didn't mean this he probably didn't mean that he he he probably don't didn't care a whole lot about if if i did this or i did that and we're trying to make ourselves free we're trying to give ourselves the freedom that's not ours to give we start living on the edge start living [Music] on that edge of life and we get deeper and deeper and deeper it's like a spider web you know it's this time of the year and spiders are everywhere some of us don't like them but i was going out the back door the other day and you know how when you're in a routine you just open the door and you walk and i took a step i said whoa it was a spider web this big all the way across my back door and you know i've gotten in those webs before in my life and they're no fun have you ever walked into him you're gonna tell me and you just you're pulling and you're turning you can't and you just know that spider's in there somewhere and you you're doing everything you can to get that thing off of you and that's the way we do when we try to free ourselves we get ourselves so tangled in the web of satan you know he's in there and you try to fight you try to battle but yet you can't find your way out and people think that's freedom no that's not freedom but they they think freedom is doing whatever you want to do well that's the terrible shape our world is living in that's why we have antifa we'll get a little political here for just a second but when they take christ out that's what comes in when they reject the freedom that god has given that's what comes in you get antifa you get homosexuality you get transgender you get a socialistic movement like we see in our nation right now that's what's happening right now because god is and they want to be in control it's their freedom i have a right we don't have right to anything it's only by god they're living their life in a false liberty there's no freedom there we say we live in the land of the free but we're under more bondage than we've ever been before and their lives prove it because they're living contrary to the fruit of the spirit if let me tell you if we don't walk in the fruit of the spirit you're going to be right there with them that's that's a serious statement but i mean it with all i've got if we don't walk in the fruit of the spirit we'll be right there with them but as believers paul said you don't have to live under that tyranny no more paul says you're free from all those things paul says you're free from having to earn your way to god people try to earn their way they try to pay here pay there do this do that if i could just do this for god i know he'll accept me that's not what it's about and paul says you're free from having to earn your way to god you're free from sin you're free from guilt you're free from death you're free from hell add anything in there that you want to that applies to your life that satan has bound you by paul says you're free from you're free from you what will you got you're free from anything that you could that could possibly plague you you're free from hatred you're free from envy malice anxiety fear doubt lust it's hitting somebody here because we're human beings and it's like brother byler said as long as we're here this this is our problem this is our enemy we're free and paul says stand fast stand fast means it's going to take some effort why is it we think when we come to christ it's all just going to be just easy easy road you think man i've lived the life of the world and this happened and that happened and finally i give myself my give my heart to the lord it's gonna be in cruise control now no that's not what it says it may get a little worse brother brandon said i'm going to say this for the benefit of those many that it last night accepted christ and we've got young believers here new believers oh believers it doesn't matter it applies to all of us but he said don't expect the road to be a flowery bed of ease you've heard it if you've been around this message long enough you've heard that it it's going to be rough it's going to be a rugged road but it's going to be a blessed road he said because he promised he'd be with you remember it always takes the valleys to make the mountains it always takes the valleys to make the mountains it's the washing out of the earth that makes the valley and has the mountain up above it he said if you notice the children of israel when they started out and left egypt listen to what the road was he said their road was directed they followed the word of god by the letter he said following a prophet come on following an angel of god or a fire but trouble set in right away they were brought to a place that there was no place to run every time and every experience no exception it comes that way he said as they were there standing in his place in this jeopardy there was mountains on one side red sea had them cut off pharaoh's mighty marching army steadily on them he said and all of nature would scream for them he said he said god got in a panic and god got worried now you know the word better than that but he said god loves to get his children in those kind of places any of you parents ever know what it's like to be the the hero your child's in a then got their self in a tangled up mess and doing something they shouldn't do or they're that you know something's not going just right and you walk up and you get them out of it you are the hero and he said god loves to get his children in those kinds of places and i'm glad of it he said it's the greatest experience in my life when i get up against something that i can't get over around or under and i just stand still and watch god make a way through it and that's the most glorious time the most glorious place has anybody ever been there it's in those times when you think if we're not careful we begin to ask my goodness my god what have i done where where am i falling short why what what mistake did i make where's my punishment it's not punishment at all but it's god putting you in a place that you trust in him and you begin to fall back on those fruit of the spirit your peace it didn't say that they had to get all worked up what did moses do he just raised his hands peace god will see us through he said one time jesus was speaking to his disciples and he began to tell them the truth he said he really began to let the hammer down and he said you know what it did it cleaned out the church and it was 12 of them left and he said where are y'all going to go so we have to be careful and know where we stand you see sometimes people who's been made free if they're not careful they'll find themselves still living in bondage i said people that's been set free and they can be deceived into a place they find themselves back into slavery there was a story that uh d.l moody told and he told a story about a former slave woman in the south following the civil war and she was a slave woman but she was confused about her status and here's her quote she asked now is i free or been i not he said when i go down to my old master he says i ain't free he said when i go to my own people they say i is he said i don't know whether i'm free or not some people told me that abraham lincoln signed a proclamation but the master said he didn't said he didn't have any right to how many christians get confused on that same point you know that god has done something in your life you know jesus has set you free but yet you listen to the old master you go down there and you know that jesus christ wrote a a proclamation an emancipation proclamation that freed you from all bondage of satan of hell all bondage of any kind of things that satan would put upon us and he's freed you but yet you go back and you listen to that old master and we listen to that old master and we find ourselves following him and listening to him let me tell you you don't have to listen to him quit listening to him kick satan out of your minds we allow him to come in and we'll allow him to lit to start talking to us and start getting into our thoughts it's our responsibility to kick him out because he know what he's going to tell you he's going to tell you you're not a christian you're not rapture material you can't be healed you let somebody get sick what's the first thing devil says you're going to die you can't be healed you can't overcome you're not a believer you're weak and why do we listen to him why do we listen to him when there's been a proclamation made on calvary the blood was shed and said you don't have to have any of that there's no bondage for you anymore anything that i am you are through the spirit but it's what we water you know we we sow seeds and we wait for the water that's what i was doing wednesday afternoon we're trying to get grass to grow beside the road i'm trying to get clover to grow in a field i'm trying to get right to grow so we without working weeds out planting all these seeds and and i was waiting for the water we got the water but you know what that water is going to show you know what that rain's going to show it's going to show what kind of seed i put on the ground now when you take me i look at you and i look at rye they look the same to me i can't tell the difference but if i put it one over here and i put one over there and you let the water come down on it it's going to show exactly what it was back in the spring i planted buckwheat up in top of a field there's a prettiest field of buckwheat you ever seen i thought man this right here is beautiful and i wrote around the other day you know what was on the other side that i wasn't seeing about a 10 foot spot of kucklebergs where'd they come from why do we get kucklebergs in our life why do we get cuckol birds in our life and it's because of when we we go through things in life if we're not careful we don't kick those things out and as the water comes down it rains on the just and the unjust and whatever in there's where we're feeding is what's gonna grow brother brown said christians are known by the fruits of the holy spirit and listen what he says that's what dominates a christian's life and proves what he is he says then the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace faith long suffering goodness generous patience and the holy spirit those fruits manifest themselves as christians we look at galatians 5 22 and now we come to the portion of the service where people can count it down because we're going to hit them all we quickly look at this and we begin to see the examples of the fruit of the spirit and what walking in the spirit produces in our life so it says by the fruit the fruit of the but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering kindness goodness faithfulness general self-control and against such there is no law and i like that because i found out in life it's hard for me to follow the law in your christian walk it's hard for you to follow the law there were a lot of people stoned to death in the days of moses because they couldn't follow the law but in this there's no legality when you look at love i can't legally make you love something love somebody i can't tell you it's the law you have to be full of joy no i can't make you legally be long-suffering with people now i could tell you brother bother could tell you now you be careful that's your brother i know he's done you wrong but just be long-suffering i can't legally make you be long-suffering you may be long-armed so there's no law that applies to any of this legally you can't be kind but through the spirit things are different that's why paul says but the fruit of the spirit he's reminding us that in this flesh it overwhelms us this flesh that we're in and around it overwhelms us things are going on in this world it's not a good place this world for a believer to live in if you feel at home here i question your experience if you enjoy the things that are happening around us you got the wrong experience you should be making you homesick it should be making you have a desire to leave this place it should be making you have a desire to get closer to god so that you know you won't miss it nothing ever will and never can come good of this flesh but paul's telling us with all the world and the shape it's in and with all the turmoil that's going on around you all the things that you see that is not godly god is good enough god is big enough god can change the very life you're living if you'll follow the fruit of the spirit the fruit of the spirit changes our destiny the fruit of the spirit turns your darkness into light it turns your fear into faith you're hating to love your anguish into happiness who don't want that and this fruit has several important characteristics you know this fruit it isn't achieved by working no it's birthed there's a new birth that has to happen that begins to produce the fruit and as it's being produced you know what else it is it's fragile this fruit is fragile if i drop this on the ground what's it going to do it's gonna bruise it's gonna leave a bad spot in it it's gonna leave a hurt spot so the fruit is fragile we have to protect it the fruit reproduces itself whatever is on that tree is what's gonna come out when that seed goes into the ground it's going to bring itself right back up the fruit is attractive you ever seen a big bushel basket of these all polished up in a store they look real nice they're attractive to us but the fruit more importantly nourishes the fruit has nutrients in it that we can live by that makes us better and i like what paul's grammar he uses here and maybe you've never caught it this is what brought this whole message to me is when i heard paul's grammar and he says the fruit of the spirit now paul in describing the things up above he uses plural check it out when he's describing the things of the flesh he says the works with an s of the flesh that's in verse 19 if you want to find it but when he's speaking about this the fruit he's speaking singular why is that because the works the things that's going on in the in the world all the envy and the malice the hatred the fornication the the murders all these things these are works of satan these are works of satan and they come from demons now the pits of hell and these things get on people stay with me now you have one person over here that's a murderer this person over here he may be a fornicator this person over here he's a liar this person over here is full of envy this one's full of jealousy it's individuals works but when he looks at this he says singular the fruit he didn't say fruits we say that a lot don't we we all say it's the fruits of the spirit but that's not what paul said he said it's a fruit and what brought this to my attention is when my kids go to school they get an award every year they get some kind of fruit of the spirit award one year it may be joy and next year it may be love next year it may be peace meekness gentleness but they get a award for one of the fruits of the spirit and i thought that's not right that's not right at all because what paul's telling us in the big picture the spirit has one word to do and all of us these aren't individual gifts of the spirit they're not into they're not distributed to individuals like gifts this right here brothers and sisters is something for every christian both male female young old veteran christian new christian wherever you're at this right here the fruit of the spirit if you proclaim to be a christian the fruit of the spirit is for you it's all on one you probably can't see it but i've got them all written on there love yeah yeah love joy peace long suffering meekness kindness all of those make up one fruit we try to distribute it we try to say sister so-and-so man she's got love she's got a lot of love in her life she loves everybody man she i tell you what ain't nobody makes her mad she's she loves everybody she's a bleeding heart she's got all she's just love love love well she's an orange well this person over here they've got joy they're just you see them every time you sin they're just so happy they're so full of life and so so joyous they're an apple or this one's a banana you know if we place it that way we're completely wrong we're not a bunch of different fruits we're not an apple an orange a peach a pear a plum we're one fruit it's the fruit of the spirit all of those make up the spirit of god in the believer we have to all have love we have to all have peace we have to all have long suffering we all have to have gentleness and meekness and kindness you can't do it without one so rather than thinking about it as a piece of fruit uh one piece why don't we think about it as a cluster of grapes the grape hangs on the vine the cluster hangs on the vine there's a bunch of little grapes on one cluster they all make up that fruit that turns in to wine we have to have all of these the fruit of the spirit he says is love and the fruit of the spirit be in love we could say that that could be the fruit of the spirit because love encompasses all eight of the others if you think about it what is joy it's love you're loving stuff you're happy you're full of life because you've got love what is peace peace is love what is long suffering it's love so that's why love is first and love seems to be the most important brother adam says this look at this it's accepting the person christ jesus the other things will come right on in and they fit together he said let every member in this body this morning this little group of people if we can pull the curtains down alongside each one each and every person in here and each person received the person of christ jesus he said there wouldn't be a fuss or an argument amongst us he said it would just be perfect love he said yet you still believe this and believe that you you mean we can believe different around the message and still have perfect love for one another i didn't i didn't man i tell you i whoo i didn't think that was possible because there's you get around the message in this group over here they see this one way you're going to dress like this and do this and it's the length in the hair and it's all this certain way group over here may be just a little bit maybe they don't see it just quite that way does that mean we're not brothers no and that that's what he's saying here we all have to come together he says you can have perfect love and this won't believe this and this won't believe that you see how important love is over law he says but now jesus said by their fruits you shall know them and the fruit of the spirit we've done been through he said but i'm going to give you my estimation of what i think the closest thing to and evidence that a man is a christian you want to know what this is he says this is the closest thing i know of a man of the christian than anything i know of he said it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungry and thirsting for god that just simply day and night they just can't stand it they got to do something for god they're so full of love they're so full of their souls travail that they're travailing all the time so don't i'm not asking you did you legally do something this week i'm asking you did you travail this week are we in travail are we in travail for the lost are we in such a hungry and thirsty place before god that we're in sir travail the way day and night that's all we think about is what can i do for god how can i get somebody to god and you're travailing for the lost we look at love and the prophet says it's just like love he said it comes in two categories he said one of them's agape and the other is filio he said filio is earthly like friendship now there's other loves as well we've got passion you've got romance those those fall into different categories but he's categorizing the agape and filio he said affiliate love is earthly like a friendship agape love is above he said listen to this filio love is what you have for your wife and your children that's filio he said now if someone insulted your wife another place he said if a brother loved your wife he said that kind of love would make you kill him he said that man insulted your wife he said that's filial love that's not what we're looking for here watch what he says next but agape love it'll make you pray for his lost soul that's that's a that's a bunch right there because if somebody comes and they want to insult my wife my children they do something it's our natural instinct we're going to rile up and we're going to we're going to bristle up against them and we're going to be ready because we love those people with a kind of a filial love that's of this earth but god says when they do that you'll back down and you'll pray for them that's love fruit of the spirit of love did you ever notice that uh all of the things up above that paul's talking about the fornication adultery uncleanliness all those things they're uh complete knockoffs of love that's a complete opposite of love and that's where we find ourselves if we're not careful when we allow satan to come in and we get outside of the the the umbrella of the fruit of the spirit and we lose our love and joy and peace and all that we find ourselves doing those very same things if we're not careful you say well i i i'm not gonna participate in that i'm not a person full of hatred i'm not jealous and i'm not gonna commit murder what about your thoughts what about your thoughts i've found out even in my own life i'll be honest that if you ever fi if i ever find myself not as close to god one day as i was the day before my thoughts are not where they need to be and i found out in my life that a lot of times it's the people that i'm around that influence those things you know what i was saying if you sleep with dogs you're going to get fleas so young people be careful of who you're around be careful of the friendships that you embrace so close be sure that you're doing exactly what god wants you to be and you're where god wants you to be the fruit of the spirit is joy you know one of the greatest marketing strategies of satan is to make you think that the things of this world and the things of his kingdom are joyous he wants you to think that adultery is fun the fornication is fun there's nothing godly about fornication you'll never see in the bible anywhere where god said fornication's okay young people stay with me but satan has put himself into a place that he tries to convince us not only are the things of the world and the things of his kingdom fun and joyous and exciting he tries to also convince us that the things of god are boring unimportant time consuming he'll tell you no need to go to that youth camp it's boring you don't know anybody there it's no fun and he'll embed those things in your mind young people till you begin to believe it you'll talk yourself into going away from a good time in the lord now i said young people what about us older people well that service last week it wasn't no good preacher's not inspired right now now there's no need in going to church it's easy it's easy to listen to those things because he wants you to think he is the way satan's not the way only god is the way the truth and the life and it's through his joy where we find our joy but the thing about joy is is it's able to remain if you've got true godly joy it remains paul was a prisoner paul was in the shackles but paul still could sit there and say i'm a child of god i'm an apostle to the gentiles i still have joy i'm going to sing i'm going to rejoice joy suffers through no matter what the circumstance have you ever looked at those believers that's gone through some terrible horrible things in their life but yet somehow they still have joy what is that there's something on the inside that they can't produce when you go through those kinds of hard things in life that tear you down to shreds you can't produce joy that over rides that only god can produce that kind of joy the fruit of the spirit is peace i'm not talking about the kind of peace like we're not at war anymore we're in a peace town and i'm not talking about that but i'm talking about peace that passes understanding i'm talking about the kind of peace that produces a calmness and an assurance in our life that no matter where you stand and what you're going through you can stand with peace how do you get that peace you say it's the trustee the bible tells us to trust and obey if we listen and we're living and we're doing what christ tells us to do and we're obeying that you can walk in your life with peace the fruit of the spirit is long-suffering long-suffering means that you one can have love joy and peace over a period of time with people and events that annoy them i thought about that and i thought you know what i'm sure glad the pastors and preachers around the message are more long-suffering than the congregations because we wouldn't have a congregation we'd have a bunch of jailbirds we'd be in jail we are not generally as human beings we're not long-suffering if somebody don't do something we think they ought to do write them off they're not christians they don't do this they don't do that be careful christ has been long suffering what about when you first started your walk and you didn't see everything quite so clear as what you do now long suffering not not quick to judge the fruit of the spirit is kindness and goodness these two words are closely collected one of the only differences is that goodness also has generosity your goodness you're going to do things for christ your generosity you're generous you're giving you're kind to those around you you have the ability to serve god through years and years and you're faithful through these temptations the fruit of the spirit is gentleness and with this it's an idea the word gentleness here means that you've got a being that's teachable not having a superior authority i always remember the story there when brother branham talks about the man full of muscle two hundred something pound just bulging with muscles but one ounce of man in him it's not the muscles it's the spirit of christ on the inside there's where your gentleness is the fruit of the spirit is self-control this is one the world knows very little of self-control but every time they try to produce self-control is for selfish motives to make themselves better to make themselves greater or grander than what they really are but on the believer we have to have self-control and we do that on behalf of others it goes right back a little bit about what's talking about long suffering we have to have self-control that we don't lash out that we don't judge that we don't condemn we have to have self-control in our daily living with christ and ourself i have to i have to have some self-control in my life if i'm going to get any higher with god because if i didn't have self-control i'd be a hellion well i guess i'm the only one but it's the truth self-control but i like what paul says again at the end against all of these there is no law we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so that we can better understand what christ is as you live in the spirit and you walk in the spirit people begin to notice things begin to change your life begins to turn around when you live a life of love and joy and peace and longsuffering you don't have near the enemies that you used to have you don't have near the anguish that you used to have you don't have near the hatred that you used to have walking in the spirit i'm going to read this in closing here brother brown said you see god is our eternal judge he says whether you have the holy spirit or not no one can judge you but god alone but we have a sign that says by their fruits you shall know them not by their church affiliation and you know we're bad about that around the message well they go to brother so-and-so is there they're not they're not they're a notch above they're pastors so and so now we're all humans we're all living by faith we're all taken one step at a time it don't matter if you're the if you're the the the biggest name preacher around the message or if you go to that church or whatever it is we're all taken one step at a time so it's not by their church affiliation but by their fruits he said nowhere in the bible does it affiliated with the church he said no the bible does it say shouting is a sign see that's where the pentecostals were at they thought shouting and the movement of the spirit they could feel it they could feel the anointing of god in the services moving amongst the people until they lost control and they just committed themselves to the spirit but that wasn't it he said nowhere does it say that nowhere does it say speaking in tongues is a sign nowhere does it say that healing the sick is a sign and we look at those things and we think man i know people around us messages that think that they can get to certain preachers and they pray over them they'll be healed now no think about that where do we put our emphasis where do we put our emphasis and think man if i could just get to brother so-and-so and have him anoint me with oil i'll be all well i'm not saying their gifts are not true they are and we know that gifts are real and gifts are distributed but it's not a sign he said the sign of the believer is the fruits of the spirit the fruit of the spirit is not seeing visions it's not healing the sick it's not speaking in tongues it's not shouting it's love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience and you know what he says all that is you're gonna like this all of that is the seal of god where do we put our emphasis where do we as believers put our emphasis and where should we put our emphasis the spirit of god the fruits of the spirit if you're producing the fruits of the spirits spirit it's a good sign that you've got the seal of god on your life how many wants that seal this morning how many would say god i realize that i can't just have one of these things i've got to have all nine of them i got to have all of them in my life i've got to be full of love and joy and peace it's all got to be there i can't i got to be long suffering i got to quit putting down my brothers because i think they're wrong there's people there let's stand to our feet i know there's a lot of teaching in there today a lot of thoughts i hope that i hope it that that you could see the the fruit of the spirit the way i hope i could bring it out the way the lord showed it to me and not being a multi-item fruit a fruit over here fruit over there but one fruit full of all of these attributes and we've been talking about the attributes of god he's one god but he's all the attributes he's a healer he's a counselor his savior his friend his mother his father his lover counselor he's all of these attributes and we can go on and on and on and on just like the fruit of the spirit it's love you're one person you're one believer full of all of these attributes let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for the word does it come forth this morning we trust lord and we we believe that something was said that would help us to grow closer to you we trust that something was said that would encourage the believer this morning and being able to see what the fruit of the spirit really is father and and knowing that we have to contain all of these things it's not a it's not a partial experience it's a full experience we have to be able to to have love for one another and we have to be long suffering we have to have meekness and gentleness and kindness we have to have all these attributes peace and love and joy they all have to portray for us to act accurately show the world what a christian really is what a believer really is and we have to be able to push these uh bear these these fruits as christians we have to be able to bear the the products of what you are even in hard times father in times when we don't feel like we can go on in times when we feel like we're so far away we have to be able to get close to you that these fruits the fruits of the spirit will be able to come out and display to the world who we are lord we want to tell you this morning we love you we appreciate you lord it's our desire lord to at all cost so to speak lord to make that rapture lord we see that there's a a polishing time right now where the bride is getting herself ready it's a time like we've not seen before in years we've talked about the rapture for years but we see things happening now at such a fast pace the lord we ought to open our eyes it ought to open our eyes to look and say it can't be much longer it can't be much much more time left the decisions are not having to be made on a weekly or monthly basis we're having to make decisions for you jesus christ at a minute to minute second by second notification we have to be so in tune [Music] because this world is so against us the prophet said the world don't like you the people here don't like you they don't like your religion he said they don't like like the way you you you act in church and the world is against you and that was in the 50s and 60s and where are we today we're outcast of this world because we don't we don't give in to the thoughts of the world we don't give in to the to the attributes that satan has sold the people out on we don't give in to the thought that everything's got to be my way and i want to do things the way i want to do them we don't give ourselves into those thoughts and those temptations but lord i want my life to be what you have my life to be lord i want my life to line up with what paul told the galatian people that if you're gonna make it if i'm gonna have that seal i'm going to have to have these attributes of the fruit of the spirit lord work on us this week help us lord to take what was said today and if it's just one little portion if somebody needs to work on the love in their life if somebody needs to work on long suffering or somebody needs to work on joy whatever whatever it is we need to work on lord would you expose it to us and show us where we fall short will you help us lord so that we can pray about it so that we could ask for your help lord jesus because lord we just don't want to fall short we love you this morning lord we love our church our brothers and sisters this morning we lift up brother byler again lord that you would give him strength and health and lord i i pray that you would inspire him with such a fire and a and a burning zeal in the word of god that he would come out and just and as he preaches as the word goes forth it just set the church on fire lord jesus so that we could just get close to you lord jesus anoint our musicians our gifted musicians lord continue to anoint them and are so that our song service and our worship and our praise will be pleasing to your ears lord jesus [Music] anoint the brothers and sisters of the church to have a desire for each other lord jesus that we would want to see each other make it that we would pray for the lost that we would travail for those who don't know you father that we would find ourselves day and night with that thought on our mind who is not in that i can speak to lord that if we miss it we've lost everything [Music] if if loved ones around us miss it because we didn't tell we failed lord so lord give us the ambition give us the drive give us the courage [Music] to display ourselves as sons and daughters of god and the boldness when people ask that we can tell where we stand and what we believe without shame but with a boldness and a courage that would light a fire in an individual to make them want to know more about you to make them understand what really happened on calvary to let them know that the love was given freely by the shed blood on calvary and lord if there's somebody here that hadn't fully given themselves to you this morning and turned their heart over to you i pray that you reach out to them lord and tug at their heart until they can't stand it no more tug at their heart until they find themselves falling down at an altar somewhere and whether it's in their closet or in their bedroom find an altar that they can find themselves falling before your feet and ask you to be savior and lord and friend i'm thankful lord that i can call you those things but i can call you a savior [Music] and that name of jesus is a name that i can call my friend you've never let me down you've never failed me you've never left me hanging you've never left me in despair without me knowing your presence was there there's been times lord i'm honest there's times that i've hurt so bad i just didn't know what i was gonna do and my family's hurt so bad that we didn't know what we was going to do but through it all you kept us you held us you grabbed a hold of our hand you came down to the depths of our hurt and our pain and our anguish and you reached down and you grabbed us and lord i could never tell you how much i love you and thank you for that and i pray that if there's somebody here in that condition that you just reach out your arm because we know your arm's not too short it just keeps going and it reaches and reaches and reaches [Music] and help us start to grab a hold to gain that strength that we need to make it in this hour we live in [Music] because as the song says i can't walk without you holding my hand [Music] we love you lord jesus thank you for all you do for us and you're precious when we pray amen what are you playing there sis becky let's just say that i want to live the way he wants me to leave [Music] [Applause] till there's just no [Music] [Music] there's just no [Music] with all your hearts now i want to live the way he wants me to live if you mean it won't just raise your hands close your eyes and sing out to the lord this morning yes there's just no [Music] one more time if we could i want to live [Music] until [Music] [Music] there's just no more [Music] could never ever
