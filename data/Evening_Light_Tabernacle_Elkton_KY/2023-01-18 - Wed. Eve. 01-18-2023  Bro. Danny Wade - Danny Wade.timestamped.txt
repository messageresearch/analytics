[1:03:31] under the heaven a time to be born and a
[1:03:34] time to die a time to plant in the time
[1:03:36] to pluck up
[1:03:37] that that which is planted A Time to
[1:03:40] Kill and a time to heal a time to break
[1:03:42] down and a time to build up a time to
[1:03:45] weep and a time to laugh
[1:03:48] I think I got this off of it too
[1:03:51] a time to mourn and a time to dance a
[1:03:54] time to Cast Away stones in a time to

[1:04:11] keep silence in the time to speak
[1:04:14] time to love and a time to hate
[1:04:17] time of war and a time of peace what
[1:04:21] profit hath you any that worketh in that
[1:04:23] wherein he labereth
[1:04:25] I have seen the travail which God hath
[1:04:28] given to the sons of men to be exercised
[1:04:31] in it he hath made everything beautiful
[1:04:33] in his time also he hath set the world
[1:04:36] in their heart so that that no man can
[1:04:40] find out the word
[1:04:42] that God made kids from the beginning to
[1:04:44] the end I know that there is is no good
[1:04:47] in them that and but for a man to
[1:04:49] rejoice and do good in his life and also
[1:04:52] that every man should eat and drink and
[1:04:54] enjoy the good of all of it is labor in
[1:04:56] the gift of God I know that that
[1:04:59] whatsoever God do it it shall be forever
[1:05:02] nothing can be put to it no anything
[1:05:05] taken from it and God do with it that
[1:05:08] men should fear before him
[1:05:11] amen may God add His blessings to the
[1:05:13] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:05:22] a time
[1:05:23] in life we have at a time to be in sin a
[1:05:28] time for justification sanctification
[1:05:30] repentance in a baptism of the Holy
[1:05:32] Ghost and then a time to Backside in a
[1:05:35] time to get back up again and what
[1:05:37] happens after you receive the the Holy
[1:05:39] Ghost tonight I'd like to speak on the
[1:05:41] subject of
[1:05:43] time to stand still in a time to fight
[1:05:46] for what God has already given you
[1:05:49] Psalms 46 and verse 10 says be still and
[1:05:54] know that I am God
[1:05:56] I just that those words right there be
[1:05:59] still and know that I am God I will will
[1:06:03] be exalted among the Heathen I will be
[1:06:05] exalted in Earth
[1:06:07] first of all
[1:06:11] what does standing still doesn't mean
[1:06:14] that we don't do anything then there
[1:06:16] Comes A Time in your life when you
[1:06:18] repent in our baptized in the name of
[1:06:20] Lord Jesus Christ and then you receive
[1:06:21] the Holy Ghost you you and you know what
[1:06:24] to do in life I believe that that there
[1:06:27] also comes a time when we want something
[1:06:30] in our life and we we try to make it
[1:06:32] happen without first praying about
[1:06:35] whether it's God's will to move forward
[1:06:37] with whatever you are wanting
[1:06:39] there comes a time when we try and make
[1:06:42] something happen and we forget that God
[1:06:45] is is there behind the scenes keeping
[1:06:48] you from things that you shouldn't have
[1:06:50] and preparing things that you should
[1:06:51] have I believe that God has defended Us
[1:06:54] in battles that we don't even know about
[1:06:56] God is always behind the scene in every
[1:06:59] situation fighting for us and wanting us
[1:07:02] to hand over the Reigns and and hand
[1:07:05] over control and stand still and let God
[1:07:10] yeah
[1:07:11] now brother Brandon said someone said
[1:07:15] not long ago give me a threat in a
[1:07:20] certain city and said if if you don't
[1:07:22] quit preaching Divine Healing we'll
[1:07:24] throw a bomb on the platform I said the
[1:07:26] smoke won't dry till I'll be in glory I
[1:07:29] said that's all right why do we fear my
[1:07:32] if God before you who can be against you
[1:07:36] you know it's written in the Bible it's
[1:07:39] better than a that a millstone be hanged
[1:07:42] at your neck and drowned in the depths
[1:07:44] of the sea then then offend one of these
[1:07:46] that believe in
[1:07:47] me signs shall follow them that believe
[1:07:50] me touch not my anointed do do my
[1:07:54] prophets no harm if you fight God can't
[1:07:57] fight stand still let God fight he will
[1:08:01] bring it to pass amen and he will put
[1:08:03] every critic everything the same deeply
[1:08:06] do you believe him Brethren let's settle
[1:08:09] down in faith
[1:08:11] no that that does not mean that that we
[1:08:13] stand still and don't do anything to
[1:08:16] tonight I would like to speak for a few
[1:08:19] more moments in on what truly means to
[1:08:22] stand still it doesn't mean to not do
[1:08:25] anything and it also doesn't mean to try
[1:08:27] and lose
[1:08:28] this probably am
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:31] at this brother Brandon I'm speaking
[1:08:34] again it's probably a many man sitting
[1:08:36] here tonight that if he he'd done what
[1:08:39] what God told him a long time ago he'd
[1:08:41] be preaching the gospel somewhere do
[1:08:43] something don't understand still get out
[1:08:45] if if you're not uh if you're not a
[1:08:47] preacher testify do something somewhat
[1:08:49] don't stand still if you're washing
[1:08:52] dishes why testify to the neighbor and
[1:08:54] get out and pass tracks do something
[1:08:56] don't stand still what is it in your
[1:08:59] hand get doing something and whatever is
[1:09:02] at your hand use it
[1:09:04] whatever is in your hand don't stand
[1:09:07] stand still instead of going after what
[1:09:10] isn't in your hand
[1:09:12] there are always things in life that we
[1:09:14] that we want and things that God has all
[1:09:17] given us
[1:09:18] there comes a time to stand still and
[1:09:20] there comes a time to stand still and
[1:09:22] defend what God has already given to you
[1:09:24] children of Israel in bondage for 400
[1:09:28] years they Stood Still and waited on the
[1:09:29] Lord God on the Lord God sent them a
[1:09:33] deliverer and Moses did exactly what God
[1:09:35] told him to do and it was time for the
[1:09:38] children of Israel to stand still and
[1:09:40] let God move through Moses and Aaron and
[1:09:43] and bring them out of the land of Egypt
[1:09:45] that and then when
[1:09:48] Pharaoh said to leave Egypt it was time
[1:09:51] to go forward in what I had given to
[1:09:54] them our upstanding still is having
[1:09:56] something to stand still in the children
[1:09:59] of the Israel had Stood Still for over
[1:10:02] 400 years and now it was time to move
[1:10:05] forward because now that they knew that
[1:10:08] that what God's will was
[1:10:11] when you you know that that you're in
[1:10:13] the will of God move forward into the
[1:10:15] land that God has already given you
[1:10:17] it's a time to go forward in what God is
[1:10:20] already given into you in a time to
[1:10:22] stand still a time to stand still and
[1:10:25] wait on the prophet to do what God Said
[1:10:27] us to do that the children of Israel
[1:10:29] were at the the Red Sea and God had told
[1:10:32] them that they were
[1:10:34] free and and now the army of Egypt was
[1:10:38] upon them and they said said have you
[1:10:41] brought us out of Egypt to die
[1:10:43] Exodus 14 10 to 14.
[1:10:46] 10 to 14 it says
[1:10:49] and when Pharaoh Drew and I the the
[1:10:52] children of Israel lifted up their eyes
[1:10:53] and behold the Egyptians marched after
[1:10:55] them and they were sore
[1:10:58] of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and
[1:11:00] they said unto Moses because there were
[1:11:03] no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us
[1:11:05] away to die in the wilderness
[1:11:08] wherefore hast thou uh dealt uh with
[1:11:11] thus with us to carry us forth out of
[1:11:13] Egypt it is not the it's not this word
[1:11:18] that we we did tell thee in Egypt saying
[1:11:20] let us alone that we may serve the
[1:11:22] Egyptians for for it it had been better
[1:11:25] for us to serve the Egyptians than that
[1:11:27] we should die in the wilderness and
[1:11:29] Moses said unto the people fear ye not
[1:11:32] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:11:35] Lord which he today for the Egyptians
[1:11:38] whom he have seen today ye shall see
[1:11:40] them again no more forever the the Lord
[1:11:44] shall fight for you and ye shall hold
[1:11:46] your peace regardless of where the
[1:11:49] children and were were in natural
[1:11:51] circumstance fear you not stand still
[1:11:54] and see the salvation of the Lord why
[1:11:57] because the children of Israel were in
[1:11:59] the place that that they were supposed
[1:12:01] to be and
[1:12:03] God was going to fulfill his word
[1:12:05] regardless oh if we we would just if we
[1:12:08] would just not take any regard of what
[1:12:11] was going on in our natural lives and
[1:12:13] only talk about God's god promise I
[1:12:17] can't imagine Joshua and Caleb at the
[1:12:19] Red Sea they weren't the one we can't
[1:12:21] move forward they were the ones saying
[1:12:23] God is going to deliver to us why not
[1:12:27] because it made sense or because the
[1:12:29] natural circumstances light up to
[1:12:30] fulfill God's word but rather that God
[1:12:33] had placed the children of Israel in
[1:12:35] such a place where they couldn't anymore
[1:12:37] do anything in their own ability and now
[1:12:40] they literally couldn't do anything
[1:12:42] except to stand still and Moses told
[1:12:45] them them to stop complaining and stop
[1:12:48] talking about how bad of a situation you
[1:12:50] are in fear ye not and not stand still
[1:12:54] and see the salvation
[1:12:57] God was telling them to stand still stop
[1:13:00] talking about your situation do nothing
[1:13:02] except stand still and I will make
[1:13:04] things happen
[1:13:06] and most just put forth his staff
[1:13:08] because God said so and and God carted
[1:13:12] the waters and the children of Israel
[1:13:13] went forward on dry ground and and then
[1:13:17] then when they got across the army of
[1:13:19] Egypt went on this that same ground and
[1:13:23] God put the waters back and swallowed up
[1:13:25] the army of Egypt there was a situation
[1:13:27] where the only thing to do was just to
[1:13:30] stand still and let God fight their
[1:13:32] battles and just let God make things
[1:13:34] happen no one can and make make things
[1:13:38] happen and change your circumstances
[1:13:39] like God can first first you must be in
[1:13:42] the right place and that God wants you
[1:13:45] to be in in order to stand still and let
[1:13:49] God fight your battles God likes to put
[1:13:51] his people in impossible situations
[1:13:53] where unless they do something in the
[1:13:55] natural they'll lose or at least that
[1:13:58] That's what Satan wants them to feel
[1:14:00] when in reality God sets it up that that
[1:14:04] way so that we will have full faith in
[1:14:07] God regardless of circumstances even
[1:14:09] when God puts them in the situation
[1:14:12] where every natural element says they'll
[1:14:14] lose they can't they can just stand
[1:14:17] still and let God move
[1:14:19] I can imagine and Satan tempting Moses
[1:14:22] and saying you dead lead them out here
[1:14:24] to die
[1:14:27] Satan we are in the right place and
[1:14:29] regardless of Pharaoh's Army is a foot
[1:14:32] from the people God said and that he
[1:14:35] would deliver us it doesn't matter what
[1:14:38] natural circumstances say we aren't
[1:14:40] looking to what the circumstances say we
[1:14:43] are going to look at what God Said
[1:14:47] Amen now as in number uh 13 in uh 26 it
[1:14:54] said uh to 33 it says and they went and
[1:14:58] came to Moses
[1:14:59] and to Aaron into all the congregation
[1:15:02] of the children of Israel and to the
[1:15:04] Wilderness of puran to Kadesh and
[1:15:06] brought back a word unto them unto all
[1:15:08] the congregation and showed them the
[1:15:10] fruit of the land and they they told
[1:15:12] them and said we came unto the land
[1:15:15] whether thou sent us and surely it
[1:15:17] floweth with milk and honey and and this
[1:15:20] is the fruit of it nevertheless the
[1:15:22] people uh be strong that dwell in the
[1:15:25] land the cities were walled and very
[1:15:28] great and moreover we saw the children
[1:15:30] inact there the male the male kites
[1:15:34] dwell in the land of this in the South
[1:15:36] and the Hittites in the the jebusites
[1:15:39] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[1:15:41] and the Canaanites dwell in the sea and
[1:15:42] by the coast of Jordan and and Caleb
[1:15:45] Still the people before Moses and said
[1:15:48] let let us go up at once and possess it
[1:15:51] for we are able to overcome it the men
[1:15:54] that went up and and with him said we we
[1:15:57] be not able to go up against the people
[1:15:59] for they are stronger than we there
[1:16:02] Comes A Time to fight
[1:16:03] for what God has already given you
[1:16:05] fighting for what God has already given
[1:16:08] you is standing still in what God has
[1:16:11] already given you
[1:16:13] that this was the time to fight for what
[1:16:16] God had already given them they're
[1:16:18] stronger than us kid
[1:16:20] they're stronger than us Caleb said good
[1:16:23] I wouldn't have it any other way why not
[1:16:27] because Joshua and Caleb were thinking
[1:16:29] in their own ability but they were
[1:16:30] thinking about what God's ability to
[1:16:33] bring to pass what he had already gave
[1:16:35] prominent
[1:16:39] he he is the the word so so when a
[1:16:42] spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith
[1:16:45] takes the word into his heart and places
[1:16:48] it upon his lips why that is the same as
[1:16:51] deity speaking Every Mountain has to go
[1:16:54] Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:16:58] Josh and Caleb were going to take the
[1:17:01] land because they and they called those
[1:17:03] things which be not as though they were
[1:17:06] and they said God will deliver us they
[1:17:09] didn't care what the mountain said or
[1:17:10] how big the mountain was God said so
[1:17:14] they were standing still and fighting
[1:17:16] for what God had already given them at
[1:17:18] the same time it's a paradox how can you
[1:17:21] fight for what you don't have in the
[1:17:23] natural and stand still at the same time
[1:17:24] because when you move forward in faith
[1:17:28] saying hey not God is more than able to
[1:17:30] give you what that mountain instead of
[1:17:32] talking about how hard it is in the
[1:17:34] natural that's when God brings it to
[1:17:37] pass
[1:17:38] Joshua and Caleb had the Revelation that
[1:17:40] they really weren't supposed to ever
[1:17:43] think
[1:17:44] logistically about whether or not they
[1:17:47] could take the land all they had to know
[1:17:50] was whether or not God had given them
[1:17:52] the land and all they had to do was just
[1:17:55] just to stand still in the right place
[1:17:57] and God would make it happen
[1:18:00] too many times this the children of
[1:18:03] Israel got to uh stinking thinking
[1:18:05] thinking about the logistics of whether
[1:18:07] or not they could take the land when it
[1:18:11] it comes to the victories that God gives
[1:18:13] us we aren't supposed to try try and try
[1:18:16] and figure out whether or not they can
[1:18:18] logistically do it but rather say God
[1:18:21] gave it to us and that settles it
[1:18:25] standing ain't still putting yourself in
[1:18:28] a situation where you don't have to the
[1:18:30] Natural ability in yourself to win the
[1:18:32] battle and and you must completely yield
[1:18:35] yourself to God in order to win a
[1:18:37] victory and that's when God takes the
[1:18:39] abilities and that's and puts you and he
[1:18:42] puts it in in you and amplifies them and
[1:18:45] with his ability and it's the same as
[1:18:47] God speaking it's the same as God
[1:18:48] himself fighting the battle amen and cut
[1:18:51] every obstacle
[1:18:53] from Human things that they they they
[1:18:56] might be connected like in the Garden of
[1:18:58] Eden uh oh man I was going to choke it
[1:19:02] but this is brother Brandon speaking but
[1:19:05] I'm I'm going to say man man is
[1:19:08] omnipotent you don't believe in that but
[1:19:11] but he is a man fully surrendered to God
[1:19:13] as omnipotent did not did not he say in
[1:19:16] Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:19:20] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:19:21] pass you you can have what you've said
[1:19:24] what happens then into omnipotence meet
[1:19:27] when God odd and man come together two
[1:19:30] omnipotence got to shake some what
[1:19:33] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[1:19:36] power of omnipotence of God knowing that
[1:19:39] he's promised it that he said it in in
[1:19:43] his word it creates the power that that
[1:19:46] goes up yonder and brings things to past
[1:19:49] things that is not it makes them as
[1:19:51] though they they are because two
[1:19:54] omnipotents have met that there he
[1:19:57] stands oh isn't he wonderful
[1:20:00] amen Not Another Part of standing Stills
[1:20:03] is waiting for God to bring his will to
[1:20:05] pass and not doing anything to try to
[1:20:07] make it it happen while waiting this is
[1:20:11] hard for even it's hard for me to do in
[1:20:13] life it's hard for me to see what God
[1:20:16] wants me
[1:20:17] once for me and wait for God to bring it
[1:20:20] to pass instead of just trying to make
[1:20:22] it happen myself
[1:20:24] so had the same problem standing still
[1:20:26] is doing what God told you to do and
[1:20:29] only what God told to do what God told
[1:20:31] you to do not adding to God's will or
[1:20:35] altering the program because you're
[1:20:37] impatient but waiting on the Lord to
[1:20:39] fulfill his will regardless of what
[1:20:42] changes in life Saul was supposed to do
[1:20:44] and what Saul was supposed to do to wait
[1:20:49] for Samuel before he offered a burnt
[1:20:51] offering watch as Satan and stacks
[1:20:54] natural circumstances against Saul to
[1:20:57] try and get him to alter the program of
[1:20:59] God and not stand still and wait for
[1:21:01] Samuel regardless of any timing or of
[1:21:03] any anything the whole thing was a test
[1:21:07] to see whether or not Saul would wait on
[1:21:10] the Lord regardless of circumstances and
[1:21:14] that that told him to hurry up and offer
[1:21:16] the burnt sacrifice
[1:21:18] 1 Samuel 13 8 and 14 says and he tarries
[1:21:22] seven days according to the set time
[1:21:24] that Samuel had appointed but Samuel
[1:21:26] came not to to gilgal and the people
[1:21:29] were scattered from him and Saul said
[1:21:32] bring hither a burnt offering to me in
[1:21:34] peace offerings and he offered the burnt
[1:21:37] offering and it came to pass that as
[1:21:39] soon as he had made an end of offering
[1:21:41] the offering behold Samuel came and and
[1:21:45] Saul went out to meet him that he might
[1:21:48] salute him and Samuel said what has thou
[1:21:50] done and and Saul said because I saw
[1:21:53] that that the people were scattered from
[1:21:56] me that thou camest not within the day
[1:21:58] and days appointed in that Philistine
[1:22:01] the Philistines gathered themselves
[1:22:03] together at uh Mitch Match
[1:22:06] that therefore said I the the
[1:22:08] Philistines will will come down now upon
[1:22:11] me to gilgal and I have not made
[1:22:14] supplication unto the Lord I forced
[1:22:16] myself therefore and offered a burnt
[1:22:19] offering and Samuel said to Saul thou
[1:22:21] Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept
[1:22:23] the Commandment of the Lord thy God
[1:22:26] can you imagine uh Saul offering a burnt
[1:22:29] offering and hasn't done the and what
[1:22:32] God had commanded him to do even though
[1:22:34] it seemed like a good gesture which he
[1:22:36] commanded thee and now what would the
[1:22:38] Lord have established that Kingdom upon
[1:22:41] Israel for forever
[1:22:43] I I like the the film of David what when
[1:22:47] Saul says well I had to do something
[1:22:51] I I can imagine it's all saying to
[1:22:53] Samuel so I'm just supposed to wait for
[1:22:56] God even if the enemy surrounds me I'm
[1:22:59] just supposed to stand still and wait
[1:23:01] for God when it makes sense to alter
[1:23:04] God's program
[1:23:05] I'm just supposed to stand still and
[1:23:07] wait on God even if the Philistines are
[1:23:09] charging at me it was time for Saul to
[1:23:13] stand still and let God fight his
[1:23:14] battles for him I I believe that the
[1:23:17] Philistines would have attacked the camp
[1:23:19] I saw was waiting on Samuel to get there
[1:23:22] and and what would have just prayed to
[1:23:25] God and when they were running at him
[1:23:27] with swords and shields said said Lord
[1:23:30] you you said to stand still and wait on
[1:23:33] on Samuel before I offer the sacrifice I
[1:23:37] will do so I believe God would have sent
[1:23:40] lightning from Heaven to in order to
[1:23:42] stop those Philistines God wanted to see
[1:23:44] if if Saul would stand still even when
[1:23:47] Saul could win the victory without God
[1:23:51] but but
[1:23:53] um but now that thy kingdom shall not
[1:23:56] continue the Lord hath that sought him a
[1:23:59] man after his own heart and the Lord has
[1:24:01] commanded him to be Captain over his
[1:24:04] people because thou Hast not kept that
[1:24:07] which the Lord commanded thee then then
[1:24:09] God gave Saul another chance and Saul
[1:24:12] didn't attack it enough so Saul went
[1:24:14] from one extreme to another
[1:24:17] one Samuel uh 15 to 2-3 says thus saith
[1:24:21] the Lord of hosts I remember there that
[1:24:23] which Emily did it into Israel how he
[1:24:27] laid wait for him in in the way when he
[1:24:30] came up from Egypt now go and smite
[1:24:32] amalek and utterly destroy all that they
[1:24:35] have and spare them not but slay both
[1:24:38] man and woman infant and suckling ox and
[1:24:41] she camel and asked
[1:24:44] one Samuel 15 13 says and Samuel came to
[1:24:50] Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be
[1:24:53] thou of the Lord I I have performed the
[1:24:56] Commandment of the Lord and and Samuel
[1:24:59] said and what meaneth then then this
[1:25:02] bleeding of the the sheep in mind he
[1:25:03] used and the loading at The Oxen which I
[1:25:05] hear
[1:25:06] and Saul said they have brought them
[1:25:08] from the male kites for the people
[1:25:13] spared the the best of the sheep and of
[1:25:15] The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[1:25:17] God and and the rest we have utterly
[1:25:19] destroyed and Samuel said unto Saul stay
[1:25:22] and I will tell thee what the Lord hath
[1:25:24] said to me this night and he said unto
[1:25:27] him say on
[1:25:29] wherefore then did thou not obey the
[1:25:32] voice of the Lord but but did fly upon
[1:25:35] the spoil and did evil in the sight of
[1:25:37] the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel yeah
[1:25:40] I've obeyed the voice of the Lord and
[1:25:43] and have gone in the way the Lord sent
[1:25:44] me and have brought a gag the the king
[1:25:48] of amalekites
[1:25:51] ml account and and have utterly
[1:25:55] destroyed the male amalekites but but
[1:25:58] the the sport but the people took of the
[1:26:01] spoil sheep and oxen the chief the the
[1:26:05] things which got which should have been
[1:26:08] utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the
[1:26:11] Lord thy God and kill gal and Samuel
[1:26:14] said hath the Lord
[1:26:16] as great Delight in burnt offering and
[1:26:18] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:26:21] the Lord
[1:26:22] behold to obey is rather and is better
[1:26:25] than sacrifice into heart hearken and
[1:26:29] then then the fat of rams
[1:26:31] for a
[1:26:33] billion is as the sin of Witchcraft and
[1:26:36] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[1:26:39] because thou has rejected the the word
[1:26:41] of the Lord he hath also rejected thee
[1:26:44] from being King
[1:26:45] Saul had a problem standing still in
[1:26:48] what God had given him and wanted to
[1:26:51] instead go on on what what he thought
[1:26:54] instead of standing still and what God
[1:26:56] had told him to do
[1:27:00] in in um 11 Samuel
[1:27:03] um second Samuel 11 and and uh
[1:27:07] one one to verse two it says
[1:27:12] and it came to pass after the year was
[1:27:15] expired at the the time when when kings
[1:27:18] go forth to battle
[1:27:20] and David sent Joe up and he and his
[1:27:23] servants with him in All Israel and they
[1:27:25] destroyed the children of Amon and
[1:27:28] besieves rabba but Terror but David
[1:27:31] Terry still at Jerusalem
[1:27:36] at a time when David was supposed to be
[1:27:39] fighting for what God had already given
[1:27:41] him David got got to trying to alter
[1:27:43] God's program and get something in his
[1:27:47] own ability instead of um standing still
[1:27:49] and letting God fight his battles for
[1:27:51] him
[1:27:52] in verse two it says and and it came to
[1:27:55] pass in an evening time that David arose
[1:27:57] from off of his bed and walked upon the
[1:27:59] roof of the the King's house and from
[1:28:02] the roof he saw a woman washing herself
[1:28:04] and the woman was very beautiful to look
[1:28:06] upon we all know this story
[1:28:09] David didn't stand still in what God had
[1:28:13] already given him but when confronted
[1:28:15] with it David humbled himself and Stood
[1:28:18] Still In what God had already given him
[1:28:20] David said I have sinned against the
[1:28:23] Lord and that was all David didn't stand
[1:28:25] still but when he made that mistake he
[1:28:28] repented the right way and then Stood
[1:28:30] Still and let God God make things happen
[1:28:33] and he he had a son named Solomon David
[1:28:37] did much worse than what Saul did what
[1:28:41] was the difference how they repented
[1:28:44] Saul repented and and so so called and
[1:28:48] didn't want to stand still
[1:28:50] David repented and said that he had
[1:28:53] sinned and didn't add justification to
[1:28:56] his repentance he said that I have
[1:28:58] sinned against the Lord and then shut up
[1:29:03] second Samuel of um chapter 12 and 13
[1:29:06] says and David said unto Nathan I have
[1:29:10] sinned and against the Lord and Nathan
[1:29:13] said unto David the Lord also has put
[1:29:16] away thy sin and thou shalt not die that
[1:29:21] child that child died though
[1:29:24] need to stand still in what God had
[1:29:27] given him
[1:29:28] took that permissive will and turned it
[1:29:31] into his perfect will and date
[1:29:34] and David after or that he had a son
[1:29:38] named Solomon and what what can I learn
[1:29:42] from that
[1:29:45] what can I learn from that fight for
[1:29:47] what God has already given me and stop
[1:29:49] trying to make extra things happen God
[1:29:52] has already given me many things to
[1:29:54] fight for in my life and and many things
[1:29:57] to stand still in what and let God move
[1:30:00] in them and that's what I need to do
[1:30:03] two
[1:30:04] and and when natural circumstances say
[1:30:07] it can't happen that's when I need to
[1:30:09] say that God gave me gave this to me and
[1:30:12] whether or not it lines up in an actual
[1:30:15] realm God's God so and God will bring it
[1:30:17] to pass and all I need to do is stop
[1:30:19] worrying about what I don't have I get
[1:30:22] back to fighting for what I already have
[1:30:25] amen I believe that that worry is a form
[1:30:28] a form of sin worries praying to the
[1:30:30] devil praying is when when you thank God
[1:30:32] for what you already have and call all
[1:30:35] those things which be not as though they
[1:30:37] were in the in the positive and and
[1:30:40] Satan takes that and converts faith into
[1:30:42] worry
[1:30:43] believe that as Satan always tries to
[1:30:47] get us the war against to to start
[1:30:49] thinking into it to ourselves of that
[1:30:54] that I I gotta go and do something and
[1:30:58] and keep trying to push towards
[1:31:00] something that and we when we do that we
[1:31:02] when we do something outside of God's
[1:31:05] will I'll try to make something happen
[1:31:08] that God wants us
[1:31:11] to stand still and trust in him when we
[1:31:14] try to to get ourselves ourselves and
[1:31:16] try to do it ourselves and try to put
[1:31:18] push towards a place where we're like
[1:31:21] I'm I'm tired of waiting let me let me
[1:31:24] try and I I fell into this many many
[1:31:26] times and let me see what I can do it
[1:31:30] and keep trying to uh push for something
[1:31:32] and and keep trying to go after
[1:31:35] something
[1:31:36] when God said to stand still when when
[1:31:40] you know oh deep down that you're
[1:31:42] supposed to stand still and believe and
[1:31:45] stand still and trust that God will
[1:31:46] bring it to pass that God would will oh
[1:31:49] oh oh that God will bring it to pass to
[1:31:52] us no matter what uh and and when is our
[1:31:56] duty to stand still and believe the word
[1:31:59] in that place that we should stand still
[1:32:02] and wait and we go out and try to make
[1:32:05] it happen ourselves
[1:32:09] have faith stand still and fight for
[1:32:11] what God has already given you and God
[1:32:13] will make everything else come to pass
[1:32:15] in his time Proverbs 3 3 verse 5 then to
[1:32:20] six trust in the Lord with all thine
[1:32:23] heart and lean not unto thy known
[1:32:25] understanding and all thy paths
[1:32:27] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[1:32:28] past look at
[1:32:31] amen God will direct your paths we need
[1:32:35] to stop worrying about what's going to
[1:32:37] happen in the next few years stop trying
[1:32:39] to
[1:32:41] Satan always builds up this word this
[1:32:43] word what's going to happen what's going
[1:32:44] to happen in the future and what's going
[1:32:47] to happen we try to try our best to make
[1:32:49] this and that happen and do this and and
[1:32:51] and try to build our our own future
[1:32:54] outside of what what got it uh what we
[1:32:57] know that God wants us to do and when we
[1:32:59] do that
[1:33:00] we can we
[1:33:02] decided God's perfect willing into his
[1:33:05] permissive will like just like David did
[1:33:08] just uh just like sold it
[1:33:12] what what just like Saul did what he
[1:33:16] thought thought it would be a good idea
[1:33:17] to to go and and
[1:33:20] outside of God's perfect will when it
[1:33:23] seemed like he should get a fight we
[1:33:24] went here if he just said Stood Still he
[1:33:27] would the Philistines would overcome him
[1:33:28] and and attack him and and and kill him
[1:33:32] in his his army but
[1:33:35] but yet God God told him to stand still
[1:33:38] and wait for Samuel but he didn't
[1:33:42] it's so it's uh so even when when
[1:33:45] everything it looks like it's going
[1:33:47] against you everything around you is is
[1:33:49] going against you when God told you to
[1:33:52] stand still and God told you to wait on
[1:33:54] him well wait wait on Samuel until to
[1:33:58] arrive before
[1:34:05] wait on Samuel to arrive and and then
[1:34:09] and but but Saul refused to do that
[1:34:13] because Saul was scared so so sometimes
[1:34:16] feel if fear will get to us that we that
[1:34:18] we act in fear because we don't know
[1:34:20] what what God's doing what we don't know
[1:34:22] what God's gonna do so we act in fear
[1:34:24] and say that let me just do this let me
[1:34:25] just do that when God says stand still
[1:34:29] I will fight your battles amen
[1:34:35] now look look at the center of my way
[1:34:37] woman God promised her her a son now now
[1:34:41] I can see her her husband put that
[1:34:43] little old side nights and he helped her
[1:34:46] and and she put her lip in there and
[1:34:48] lifted her up she she said on the little
[1:34:51] old donkey and and pushed a little shawl
[1:34:54] across her face kiss him goodbye and
[1:34:56] brushed his tear him air back and said
[1:35:00] don't don't cry don't don't you cry

[1:35:24] away and she
[1:35:26] said and to the servant they led the
[1:35:29] mules the the music course and said no

[1:35:36] you even stop to check up unless I tell
[1:35:39] you on on up she went I can see her her
[1:35:43] going around just trying on this little
[1:35:45] mule singing the praise of God oh my and
[1:35:48] an old Elisha
[1:35:51] set back there and been reading this the
[1:35:54] scroll on the scroll down down and you
[1:35:57] know
[1:35:58] what all had taken place setting back
[1:36:01] there

[1:36:04] the name I'm not sure but we'll just go
[1:36:07] with gehazi studying at the the door
[1:36:11] nodding I can see Elisha rub his eyes
[1:36:15] and look out he said gehazi yes master
[1:36:18] he he jumped up said here here comes the
[1:36:22] Shona might go see what what she
[1:36:26] wants ask her if everything's well with
[1:36:28] her and her husband and her child so God
[1:36:31] honestly went out a little little piece
[1:36:34] that said is all well with thee is is
[1:36:37] all well with thy husband is all well
[1:36:39] with the child
[1:36:41] what what you're going to say sister
[1:36:43] what what you're going to say well well
[1:36:45] now if I'm counting on intellects I say
[1:36:47] oh merciful god oh My Baby's Gone but
[1:36:50] there's something down in me says say
[1:36:52] something different she she said all is
[1:36:56] well amen
[1:36:58] amen everything
[1:37:00] 's all right oh my that ain't casting
[1:37:04] down reasonings that that's making in
[1:37:07] the world that calls ridiculous that's
[1:37:11] what science would say was crazy but she
[1:37:14] got what what she asked for so what
[1:37:16] difference does it make she said
[1:37:18] everything's all right everything's just
[1:37:21] perfectly all right and amen and
[1:37:26] she spoke in power and
[1:37:30] and said as things as if it and he was
[1:37:36] already well because she believed that
[1:37:39] that man of God would raise her child up
[1:37:43] she because she believed because she
[1:37:46] believed with all her heart and and
[1:37:48] spoke things as if if they already were
[1:37:51] she got what she got what what she was
[1:37:55] looking for amen
[1:37:58] she said I stand still and fight for
[1:38:00] what God has already given me she didn't
[1:38:02] let natural circumstances change her
[1:38:04] demeanor at all God promised her the son
[1:38:07] and nothing was going to make her her
[1:38:09] say oh is not well the baby is already a
[1:38:14] dead thought all is well all is well is
[1:38:18] not meant to be based on natural
[1:38:20] circumstances it's based on God's
[1:38:22] ability to bring it to pass talking to
[1:38:26] someone that asked how it what what how
[1:38:29] I was doing and even though in the
[1:38:31] natural it wasn't that great I was I
[1:38:35] said that I was it was great because
[1:38:39] that's what God would say
[1:38:42] when you don't know what what to do or
[1:38:45] say don't think about how big a mountain
[1:38:48] is don't think about how hard the trial
[1:38:50] is or what what your mind is telling you
[1:38:52] think what what God would say
[1:38:55] if I asked him whether or not everything
[1:38:58] will be all right there is no natural
[1:39:00] circumstance that can stand against God
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:04] amen
[1:39:06] and if if we get to that place where
[1:39:08] we're looking to what what God would say
[1:39:12] what God can do and wait we know that
[1:39:15] that God is able to and you speak things
[1:39:17] uh you speak to that mountain and you
[1:39:20] you say hey tell that mountain to move
[1:39:24] it will move because because it is thus
[1:39:28] saith the Lord because
[1:39:30] just as
[1:39:33] brother Branham to M said it is it is
[1:39:36] not not
[1:39:37] me speaking Inc but it is God speaking
[1:39:40] through me if we if you is
[1:39:43] speak to that mountain speak to your
[1:39:46] mountain and say say
[1:39:48] be thou remove and not doubt in your
[1:39:51] heart it shall come to pass if you if
[1:39:53] you have the Holy Ghost within you that
[1:39:55] is that is God speaking through you and
[1:39:57] you and you speak with authority and you
[1:39:59] just tell that mountain
[1:40:00] and and you tell us that to get thee
[1:40:03] behind me Satan I'm not gonna doubt
[1:40:04] today I'm not going going to to give
[1:40:07] into your lies I'm not gonna worry about
[1:40:09] it I I'm just going to speak things as a
[1:40:12] in the natural they aren't but I'm gonna
[1:40:14] speak things as if they are
[1:40:19] amen and
[1:40:24] there there is no natural circumstance
[1:40:26] that can stand again
[1:40:28] Mark 5 and 13 verse 35 too so 43 says
[1:40:34] while he gets and yet speak that came
[1:40:36] from the ruler of the synagogue how how
[1:40:38] certain and which said thy daughter is
[1:40:42] dead why trouble us out of the master
[1:40:44] any further as soon as Jesus heard the
[1:40:47] word that was spoken he said unto the
[1:40:49] ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid
[1:40:52] only believe and he he refers he
[1:40:56] suffered no man to follow him say Peter
[1:40:59] and James and John the brother of James
[1:41:02] and he
[1:41:04] they come into the house of the the
[1:41:06] ruler of the the synagogue and seat the
[1:41:08] tumult
[1:41:10] and and then that wept and wailed
[1:41:13] greatly and what when he was coming he
[1:41:16] he saith unto them why maketh ye this
[1:41:19] Ado and Weep the damn soul is not dead
[1:41:21] but sleepeth
[1:41:23] and they and they laughed in this corn
[1:41:25] but but when he had put them all out he
[1:41:29] he take it the father and the mother of
[1:41:31] the the damsel
[1:41:32] excuse me and and then that where with
[1:41:35] him and entereth in in where the damself
[1:41:39] was lying and he took the dams up by the
[1:41:42] hand and said unto her uh excuse my
[1:41:46] pronunciation talitha uh Kumai which is
[1:41:50] being interpreted damsel I say unto thee
[1:41:54] arise and and straight away the damself
[1:41:57] rose and walked for she was at the age
[1:41:59] of 12 year years and they were
[1:42:01] astonished with great astonishment and
[1:42:04] and he charged them straightly that no
[1:42:06] man should know it and commanded that
[1:42:08] that something should be given her to
[1:42:09] eat
[1:42:10] it doesn't matter what the circumstances
[1:42:13] are we aren't supposed to try and figure
[1:42:15] out how to make God's will come to pass
[1:42:18] we're not supposed to fight for we're
[1:42:21] supposed we're supposed to fight for
[1:42:24] what we already have and let God fight
[1:42:27] for what what we don't have if we try
[1:42:29] and make things happen on our own we
[1:42:31] will mess things up yeah God can make
[1:42:34] things happen better than we can every
[1:42:37] single time
[1:42:39] now Daniel what what do you mean if I
[1:42:43] want a certain something to happen in my
[1:42:46] life and I truly believe that it is
[1:42:48] God's will to happen the best way I can
[1:42:51] make it happen is I fight for what I
[1:42:53] already have read read my Bible and pray
[1:42:56] and listen to the prophet of God every
[1:42:58] single day work hard at work and spend
[1:43:01] time with the family that God has
[1:43:02] already given me and stand still and
[1:43:04] fight for what I already have and if God
[1:43:06] if it's God's will God will make it
[1:43:09] happen and I don't need to worry about
[1:43:11] it truly standing and still is giving
[1:43:15] the Reigns to God for him to make things
[1:43:18] happen according to what his will is and
[1:43:20] not my will
[1:43:23] strengthened everything that I have and
[1:43:26] and God will bring the rest to pass and
[1:43:29] if it and if it isn't his will good if
[1:43:33] something is God's will then God will
[1:43:35] bring it to pass and not me
[1:43:38] amen
[1:43:40] musicians if you'll come
[1:43:45] I'm thinking of a Great Hero that's too
[1:43:48] too often forgot about in our reader met
[1:43:51] many of you men and women about
[1:43:53] out those brother Primus we can't
[1:43:56] believe
[1:43:58] we'll be able to remember him it
[1:44:00] happened in Switzerland many years ago
[1:44:02] Switzerland what was some Germans that
[1:44:05] went up there in the mountains they

[1:44:16] day when the aliens come in they were
[1:44:18] going to take their land from them the

[1:44:29] pitiful site that that day to see a
[1:44:32] handful of little Swiss backed up
[1:44:34] against the mountains with clubs and
[1:44:36] sticks in it and rocks and old

[1:45:07] long trained Spears in front of them
[1:45:09] every man perfectly in step and and hear
[1:45:12] the little Swiss stood not knowing what
[1:45:16] what to do and finally there was a young
[1:45:18] fellow stepped up by the name of Arnold

[1:46:11] spot of the Spears and he raised on
[1:46:13] toward heaven and and screamed at the
[1:46:16] top of his voice Make Way for Liberty
[1:46:18] and and he started running and he
[1:46:20] screamed again Make Way for Liberty and
[1:46:23] as he rushed towards the army with his
[1:46:26] hands up in it and his open bosom and to
[1:46:29] the spears more than a hundred Spirit
[1:46:32] weeks for him and he grabbed them and
