amen wednesday night and uh i got work in the morning you got work in the morning and uh i'm going to get my girls off to school and all that good stuff now the school's back in session and uh light

church body for receiving us again and uh again because we are in school time you don't see samantha the kids they're uh they're they're all buckled down doing homework and hopefully hopefully they're watching church tonight if we've got it i think brother joseph's getting ready to start back up we've been in construction for a period of time and haven't had wednesday night services but i think it's either tonight or possibly the following wednesday that we're starting back up to wednesday and i was just saying the other day how much i missed going to church midweek and so when brother wrote me and asked to come i i got excited just like a kid at christmas time hallelujah you get to go to church in the midweek amen i like that so good to us to be able to be here tonight and thankful for all the things that we believe the lord's going to do for us tonight in his word you come expecting you good that's good to hear all right god bless you i'm gonna go sing and we'll worship together a little bit and then uh get right into the word of god amen i always feel so like i'm missing something without sam coming over here next to me but anyhow praise the lord [Music] oh i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an eye i made my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment and i may not know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls his church away i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an eye i made my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment or i may not know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls his church away i'm listening for the trumping to sound most any time and the crown of life is waiting thank god will soon be mine i've got my invitation through a place called calvary by the precious blood of jesus that trip's been paid for me i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an eye i made my reservation for in the sky i may not know the moment and i may not know that they don't know that i know and i believe in when he calls his church away i like this right here now the captain of the vessel he's called and get on board and the destinations heaven safe on that crystal shore well there we'll meet our savior and our loved ones who have gone there to live for all eternity yes we're going home i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an eye i made my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment and i may not know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls his church away listen to that again oh the captain of the vessel he's calling get on board and the heaven safe on that crystal shore where there will meet our savior and our loved ones who have gone there to live for all eternity thank god i'm going home i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an eye i've made my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment and i may not know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls his church away but i know that i believe in when he calls his church away can you say amen to that praise the lord let's stand together this evening and let's get right into the word of the lord are you excited for the holy spirit amen and jesus good to us hallelujah hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 6 and seven hebrews chapter one verse six and seven i want to speak to you this evening upon a ministry of angels ministry of angels how many believes in the angels of the lord amen well if you don't you've come to pick a good night to be at church because before this so with i will do my best to prove to you that they're not only here for us they're here with us around us and they serve a great purpose in the body of christ for our needs hebrews chapter 1 6 and 7. and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god to him and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire now don't say it again ministers a flame of fire his angels spirits and his ministers of flame of fire so flames of fire aren't supposed to just do power points and if they do they should bring their power with their point amen if they're a flame of fire there shouldn't just be a good intellectual talk praise the lord if they are a flame of fire when they come to the pulpit they should fire well it makes sense if the priest went into the temple and he was going to burn the sacrifice up or he was going to light the candles i mean it'd be hard for him to do it walking out of the wet blanket god didn't call you to come to church tonight to listen to a wet blanket god called you to come and listen to flames of fire praise the lord now listen to this out of christ as the mystery just one little snippet here i want you to think about this as we dig into the message tonight brother brandon said in my opinion the first thing that god made was angels it's quite a statement in the first thing he made was angels let's pray together heavenly father what a privilege it is to be in the house of the lord lord jesus we are so grateful for the holy spirit that's amongst us tonight we pray lord that your word will come in such a powerful way lord that it'll be able to bring a change to our everyday lives our hearts our thinking and god may you just sweep us up for a few moments tonight lord jesus carry us away into that eternal place where we can hear from you forgive us of our sins wrongs and transgressions and foolishnesses we pray that the holy ghost will come in such a mighty way into our hearts tonight lord that we will be able to look into the unseen and recognize what's around us tonight as i pray you will bless this word to our souls as we take it into our soul mind body and spirit may we live by may live through us may the holy ghost water tonight this all that's been accomplished all the singing all the music the worship even to the taking of the offering which brother bam talked about being a form of worship lord our clapping of hands are rejoicing lord may every bit of it be to the benefit of the kingdom of god and to our walk with you as we commit this evening to your hands in jesus christ's name and the word and the speaker and the listener amen and amen god bless you may be seated hallelujah that was a great amen i didn't even ask you all to say amen and you gave one i i like that i like that that's good just keep that up that's good you know you're gonna have a good church service when the people are amen nice and loud i like that you know how you know you're in a good funeral everybody's crying and sad amen you know how you're doing a good church service everybody's rejoicing amen praising the lord i i like that now now i want to try if the lord will help me now i'm going to watch that clock very carefully tonight because um it'd be easy for me to get carried away on this subject and we'd be here an hour and a half without it without a problem but i'm going to try to just get into the high spots the best i can because there's so much in this that it would be impossible to break it down in one night and and i'm going to try if the lord will help me to get as much of the good meaty parts of this in so that we can understand uh this this unseen world around us and i i believe it's important to understand what it is around us simply because we know that we can't put confidence in anything that our our eyes look at and uh you know for example if a person wants to come to church tonight and uh you know you was to see uh you know some sort of uh uh natural occurrence some disaster some kind of thing we all know those things are temporal they only last for a season and then they go away the bible talked about how that everything we see around us brother joe is a temporal thing we can't trust it we can't put confidence in it we certainly can't believe in it to be an absolute and so we need to look beyond just this natural realm look beyond just where our eyes are always focused on and everything we're always viewing we need to look beyond all of that and so in doing that then there's another realm that is beyond our eyes is faster than our eyes that is brother teresa mentioned the name a moment ago saying that song about will speed up they'll slow down because there's a a dimension around us right now where there is activity taking place in another realm faster than our eyes are you with me so far now i want you to think about something just in a natural uh type approach to it right now this very moment over in another land there are people that are waking up we're getting ready to go to bed in a little while and then people right now are getting ready to wake up there'll be planes operating there'll be trains going down tracks there'll be people getting in their cars and on their motorbikes and they'll be going down to their places of business mothers will be picking up their children and taking them to school they'll be other people starting their day of business opening up the market they'll be doing all sorts of things and yet you and i are sitting right here right now and all we can see is the four walls of evening light tabernacle but yet beyond this building right now there is activity going on around us in this world there is life there is death there is birth there is suffering there is rejoicing there is joy there's all sorts of things that's taking place around us activity that's taking place right now but we can't see it we can't hear it we don't recognize it with our natural life and with our natural eyes so that tells me then that if in the natural i mean this is bringing on home right now in this little city there's people doing all kinds of things uh some town maybe a mile away there's a fellow working on a car trying to get an old car to start up and he's out there priming and juicing and pumping and everything he can do to get it going but yet we don't hear it we don't see it but he's probably over there hollering at the thing and kicking the tires trying to get it to go what i'm trying to say to you is just because you don't see it doesn't mean there's not activity taking place around you amen can somebody say amen now i want you to pay attention to what brother branham said here that angels were the first in the creation of god now if we believe brother branham would be a prophet of god and we believe that he had some sort of insight into supernatural things and we do believe that then we must also believe that this prophet understood what this realm must have looked like because remember outside of the apostle paul i'm talking about the new testament we don't really have a record of a man that was permitted to see into that realm any greater than william branham was as far as a ministry of being able to recognize and see supernatural things uh you know we've had a lot of impersonators come along they've had their angels of the lord and this top bentley down in florida you know he said brother branham's angel come to him and commissioned him to lay hands on the sick and we've had other people talking about angels coming and visiting and all of that is just their opinions and their supernatural imaginations are not supernatural so much but imaginations of supernatural things and and and we you know it seemed like every new doctor that comes along the message somebody's had an angel visit him at some point to give him authority to be able to say the things that they're saying but but we realize that in all of that nonsense out there and all of that counterfeit out there there is an authentic genuine community of angelic beings that god created for the service of the elect of god are you with me amen now brother branham was a window or a door or a look through that we could see into that realm to not only see how that demons behave and to understand how the demons operated but also to see how the angels of the lord operated within themselves now i'm going to give you part two of the little nuggets of my part two of this message now we don't have time to get to part two tonight but i'm going to give you a little peep hole a part two tonight like when you go to the motel you know and you look through that little thing and you get to see a little bit i'm gonna let you look through the little looking glass tonight just a moment and i want you to study this when you get time but go back and watch when brother bannon mentions the angel of the lord that come to him watch how he mentioned to the lord all the way up to 19 and 62 until he has a vision of seven angels it's going to medium at sunset then all of a sudden now he goes from talking about the angel singular angel of the lord now he once again over and over and over again after meeting his angels now it is angels of the lord seven angels of the lord seven angels of the lord again and again and again showing that there was a turning of the corner that took place at the opening of the seven seals amen in other words god permitted us to look beyond the curtain of time so that we could look into that realm and see that there was something taking place around you and i i i realize that we may not think of it just in this manner but but remember that when the book of revelation was wrote that john was seeing envisioned things that would take place in a literal manner but john when he was seeing them wasn't taking place right then when he hears the beast say come and see and he hears the thunder and he sees the white horse rider go out it would be it would be you know sometime along his generation that the first horse rider would ride as he writes it in his own epistle when he said little children that spirit of antichrist is already at work among you that's true but when john saw the red horse rider it would be hundreds of years after his passing that the red horse would ever take place the black horse would be a thousand and fifth of that well excuse me 1 500 years later the black horse would step out under that money-making scheme in martin luther's time and start charging people for their prayers and charging them to pay saints out of purgatory and so many hundreds of years after john sees it does it take place and remember there was activity prophesied to take place at the opening of the seven seals there was a cry that went out who is worthy to take this book and loose these seven seals amen that didn't take place when john was looking at it but it was a prophecy of activity hallelujah that would take place in 1963 there would be a cry go out who's worthy to take this book and then the lamb would take this book break the seals and now here we have the opening of the word laying before our eyes activity was taking place let me give you an example of what i mean remember when daniel prayed remember it was 21 days after he had asked the lord to show him what was going to take place in his generation 21 days after john or excuse me daniel had asked god to show him something the moment he prayed when gabriel finally shows up gabriel tells him look i heard you the first time you started talking amen but he said when i come to try to do something for you i couldn't do it on the kind of the prince of persia was there to withstand me but when he started praying there was activity taking place in another dimension don't you know saints it's the same thing with you and i remember when simon peter was in prison remember that you know you go to walmart and you see them doors go peter had the patent on that before them doors was ever invented because when the angel of the lord took him out of prison and prison doors went and peter walked right out the thing and remember he walked up to the very door where the saints were praying for his deliverance and they thought it was a ghost or a spirit of some sort but what was it activity was taking place in another dimension when they were asking god to deliver their brother same thing for you and i brother branham started praying about the age about the generation no other man had that burden you don't see billy graham and oral roberts and them starting to say things to their congregations about there's something about this book of revelation you don't find oral robbers standing up in front of his congregation and saying i'm going to the mountain with a pencil and a and a piece of paper and i'm going to lean up again two plus two is four until these revelations start breaking open nobody else had the burden to understand the hour we were living in like william branham did because the burden was in his heart the same as it was daniel it created activity in another dimension that's why the angels of the lord i kindly have my own personal feeling on that i wonder sometimes brother tom maybe the way that went was the lord had already instructed them seven angels what to watch for and when brother battam was out there walking up that mountain and he had the little brother back behind him it was a little out of shape and he went back to kind of catch up with him a little bit the holy spirit said throw up that rock i've often wondered brother joe the holy spirit hadn't already told him seven angels now let me tell you what your signal is when you move prophet's going to throw up a rock and when you see that you break through that dimension out there hallelujah amen but what was it activity because of the desire of a son of god to know what revelation is well brother if that's the way it was with daniel if that's the way it was with peter if that's the way it was for brother branham what is it with you when you desire to see something of god it creates activity in another dimension amen that's the end of part two i don't even have to preach it now hallelujah i'm the worst evangelist in the world to preach myself out of a job but it creates activity now i want to go back just for a moment to the very beginning if rem said the first thing that christ made was angels then before there was a sun before there was a moon before there were stars before the anything in creation god had this angelic community ready to do a job now remember these angels were not created with the offending bodies because in the theophany you know all things the theophany is the word and the word cannot be destroyed remember there'll be a portion of these angels to become demons that be cast into the lake of fire and they'll be destroyed so these angels were not created with a theophany body that knew all things even jesus said that the son of man doesn't even know nor the angels in heaven the time that jesus will return the coming of the so the angels of god do not have infinite wisdom they don't know everything about everything and the reason of that is is because god created them to be servants to serve you and i in the body of christ i'm going to tell you all something i want you listen to me carefully in your lifetime you may be saying to yourself i'm all alone before this evening is over i'm gonna prove to you you are never alone and never have been alone god in his word has surrounded you with a heavenly host you say how many are there i don't know because the bible said like this those demons those that were once angels in heaven john said you could number them two hundred thousand thousand but when paul spoke about these heavenly angels around us he said it's innumerable in other words you can't number how many christ has got hallelujah and hallelujah now if this was the first thing that god made it was also the first battle that was ever engaged remember it was lucifer who was also an angel the highest angel created in all of this angelic community remember there's degrees of these angels they don't all have the same power they don't all have the same authorities they all don't have the same abilities that's why religious devil is a whole lot harder to deal with than a devil of smoking or drinking or something of that nature and if you all that ever used to smoke and the lord delivered you of it you know how hard it is to quit smoking my daddy said one time many years ago he had he had to die in order to get away from them and it just about did with heart failure back in the 80s and even that kind of a struggle ain't nothing compared to a religious spirit why they're made different some have different abilities some are stronger than the other the prince of persia was stronger than gabriel and until him and michael ganged up and tagged him against the prince of persia he was fighting to lose in battle don't ever think that these demons that you wrestle with don't understand what it means to be supernatural religious speak in tongues and shout brother brahman said i've seen demons do it remember you're talking about beings that were once angels of god in heaven that's why the powers that are against us this is why we need the holy ghost because listen to me the devil who is a fallen angel never sleeps never eats never gets hungry never gets fatigued never gets tired never gets wore out he's got all every minute of the day to plan against you to work out schemes against your life and you think your puny little flesh is going to be any match for a demon that ain't slept for 6 000 years forever how long his creative time has been this is why we need the holy ghost and a double portion of it in order to be able to overcome every spirit that comes against the bride in this last day right we'll never be able to overcome it ourself so the first battle that took place was amongst these angels the first sin that took place was among them two remember lucifer sin coming against god so the first fall that ever took place was when these angels left their real estate god had given real estate in heaven and they left it walked off and left what god had placed in their hands oh but here's the hallelujah tonight when these angels fell from heaven you never find god said one deer you never hear him come back saying oh come you come i'll forgive you when they messed up god said get out but sometime later there's a scene unfolding on the earth and one of god's boys gets in trouble almighty god comes down from heaven himself crying and weeping adam adam where are you you see when angels fall it didn't even really move the heart of god because how much more is a son than a servant but when you fail when you come to the world speaking lies it's so moved the heart of god do you realize in the days of the annelid whenever the bible said in the days of noah repented god that he even made man you know what that word repented means it means that it grieved god until he cried when he saw his creation in the situation they were in i want you to find me one scripture where god ever got that upset over an angel find me one place where he ever got that tore up and that disheveled over an angel falling out of their position but when you get in trouble come on when you get in a spot where you don't know what to do it moves the heart of god in a way you could never even explain it praise god oh thank you jesus now notice angels can take on human form human characteristics if you'd like to see that it's genesis chapter 19 verse 1. two angels go down to sodom and lot meets these two angels falls himself to the ground and says my lords it was a lot different than that with abraham abraham saw three and brother john when he sees the three he says my lord because abraham had a revelation there's only one god uh come on when lord sees him lots of heathen at least he's been influenced by heathenism and he sees more than one and he says my lords worships sure that's the way the church world is fall down for anything any old thing fall for anything that moves but a true seed of god knows there's only one god and we do not worship angels but let's give credit where credit is due sometimes the things and the events that take place in your life in my life the help that god sends to us sometimes it ain't always directly the holy spirit moving on your behalf oh that got you thinking sometimes it's the angels of the lord commissioned to do work for you and i we say god move sure he'll move he'll do things but sometimes it ain't always the pillar of fire coming into the room to do certain things no he's got servants like the roman centurion said i tell them to go and they go i tell them to do and they do i tell them to act and they act well you ask god for anything sometimes if you ever recognize you don't feel the holy spirit but you know supernatural things are happening why it isn't the pillar of fire standing right by you directly he's got angels of god standing there doing a work for you now be careful before you get too critical of me i'm quoting your quote i'm just not telling you i'm doing it because they ask brother random about that why don't you give credit to the spirit of the lord he said i've got to be truthful he said it isn't always the holy spirit he said sometimes it's the angel of the lord doing now mind you it's god to it's a top and it'll be god at the bottom but how does god move sometimes how does he act is it always him running from one part of the throne to another down to kentucky down over here to tennessee running over and doing that he's got an innumerable host of servants that are commissioned to do the works that he commands them to do praise god again please let me remind you you're never alone notice now let's look at a new testament version hebrews chapter 13 verse 2. if angels can take on human form in the old testament what about the new testament paul said be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares now you know for most of us we would look for you know ufos if we walked out here in the parking lot flight in a big old round light zhu my goodness facebook would turn upside down we would tweet and it would be on instagram and everything else in the world oh you wouldn't believe what we just saw brother madam said that those investigating angels they come down to see the condition of humanity but what if sometimes them ufos show up in the form of unidentified flying visitors somebody that comes into the church just randomly just coming in i wonder if god sends them among us just to see what our attitude's going to be sometimes how we're going to treat people how we're going to welcome them or what we're going to say to them oh god some of y'all are guilty already ain't all or nothing well this is where you need to say forgive me lord and move on and fix it right but it'd be easy for us if we was to sit in a condition to say that the holy spirit was absolutely trying to help us and we'd say god i want you to help me you don't feel the lord you don't feel the holy ghost all of a sudden somebody shows up on the side of the road to help you fix your tire now you know what the agnostics and what the atheist the carnal and the intellectuals say well that's just life that's just the way life oh it isn't that simple those things are sent down many times as angels unawares if god can move on a donkey to spare a prophet can't god move on a motorist to help you with your tire come on somebody if we believe that god is in control of everything my brother's sister there is nothing he don't have his hand upon [Music] we just have to trust him that he knows what's going on if he's god if he's god he knows the end from the beginning so we should trust him or shut up and get out of the game come on we get all of our belly aching and grumbling oh god yeah i wonder to a being who knows everything how silly we sound some i mean i was carrying on the other day anybody ever carry on i'm in the south you're saying carrying on don't you i say that up north and then yankees go huh carrying what was he carrying and i was telling the lord oh lord this and all of that and all of a sudden i just i literally pinched my lips shut and i said shut up i said ben you're the dumbest person in the world you are telling god who knows everything what's going on i thought well how silly so i just repented i said lord i'm sorry for trying to remind you of what you saw before the world was ever created i just need your help i'm sorry for my humanity but what i'm trying to tell you lord is i need your help praise god kind of like him fellas when they go on the prayer closet you know they start quoting every book of obadiah and habakkuk oh lord how are god on page so and so the prophet said you think you don't know his word already you reckon we have to quote word to him all the time lord as the prophet of god said and the bible said and john said i wonder if sometimes jesus don't look down at us and go these poor dumb kids of mine i wish i'd get it through their head for he is god don't you look at me that way if you're a father you're a mother you know how you feel about your youngin sometimes you've got their world you've got their world in your hands and the way they carry on you say you silly things you got to know that jesus probably looks at us sometimes and goes don't you know don't worry about the light bit don't worry about the gas don't worry about i got it taken care of notice even about jesus in psalms 8 5 said they made him god made him a little lower than the angels now why is that you think about something for a moment and i would like to couple this scripture now with matthew 22 30. if you'd like to write this down or if you've got your book there you'd like to look at it jesus said that in the resurrection we were neither married or given married but be given marriage but be as the angels of god in heaven okay so if jesus then was made lower than the angels and then when we are changed in the resurrection we'll be more like the angels now what does that mean exactly and mind you when i say what i'm getting ready to say i am quoting you a quote i'm just not going to tell you where it's at because i'm going to do all your homework for you but remember that that jesus came to the world with sexual instrumentality he could be tempted by sexual things all right now listen close don't get a filthy mind and keep your mind on what i'm trying to tell you remember the very thing that put you and i in the condition we are in today all of your impatience all of your temper all of your strains all your sicknesses everything you put up with it came here because of sex desire yes or no come on talk to me that's the whole reason we showed up like we showed up so notice then that the lord jesus then was made lower than the angels why because angels were not made with reproductive instruments they have no sex clans they have no organs to reproduce by so they cannot propagate another species as it was given to the man he never said to the angels multiply and replenish the earth so angels have never smoked they've never drank they'd never curse they've never lied they've never committed adultery they've never felt lust they don't even know what it means but then jesus comes made lower than the angels meaning he came with all the instrumentality yes the prophet of god said jesus could have reproduced and had a family if he wanted to any of y'all ever hear about this ridiculous thing the da vinci code you know some of the uh the story line behind the da vinci code of course all the you know the charismatics they were all just you know flipping upside down oh my about jesus having a literal daughter he could have done it part of the storyline is is that jesus actually reproduced he could have done it he had the ability to do it listen but when we are changed notice this again in luke chapter 20 verse 36 he said neither can we die for we are equal to the angels and resurrection now and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection oh now watch so then jesus come to this earth you realize that with even the sex glands in our lips i read a study here not long ago that they said when a man and woman kiss that they exchange dna a portion of dna and they said that even as much as 40 years later they can pick up the dna from the person that they kissed 40 years before that it's something that once those glands exchange it lays in their body and some of these people that run around the mess are saying it's all right to kiss and carry on before they get married you better check that out really carefully as brother madam says potentially commit adultery you see why it's the crossing up of those glands and your first kiss should be at the altar right or you say but what if i'm guilty well then you never do it again you say god help me and you stay straight until you get a chance to get married be sure to confess it to your husband and future wife whoever it might be and let them know where you stand come on now right don't hide nothing like that say what's right because it's existing in your body so in the resurrection then we'll be more like the angels why now remember they've never smoked they've never cursed they've never drank they've never committed adultery and when we are changed we will be made just like them in other words ourselves will be rearranged and recreated so that we will be like those that have never smoked never cursed never drank never lied never committed adultery the very thing that put us in this condition before will be completely rearranged because that's the tree of knowledge of good and evil search scriptures that's the whole reason you're in the in the mess you are today because your great great great great great great great great great great great granddaddy had an awful temper and had a temper to fight a buzzsaw and about 12 or 14 generations later here you are and not only do you get that great great great great temper but you get a great great great great one than the great great great hat ain't that great come on now church but when we are changed our bodies will be rearranged hallelujah to reflect a complete conversion as though we were never born by sex desire in the beginning all that temper all that impatience all those desires all those things that lay in your body all those fights and struggles and late night this that the other early morning that whatever amen oh that'll be taken out of you and you'll be like the angels oh praise the lord now notice this again oh my i love this scripture right here first peter chapter 1 verse 12 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven now peter is saying that the report of the gospel has come to us by those that have preached the the gospel with the holy ghost from heaven you see this is the reason you want a real man of god preaching to you because here in greatest battle ever fought brother bradham said that when a minister comes to the platform an angel of the lord comes down to anoint the gift to serve the people so if there's no gift there there's no angel there you know what you got you got a good talker a charismatic speaker somebody good with power points and big words but you don't have an anointed man friends why do you think that many times we get these guys in the platform that they talk well but nothing ever happens if you leave a church service and you ain't been scorched or burned or convicted or made to feel some sort of emotion or helped or blessed or some other thing then that man of god i don't care how much you call him a preacher he's no preacher in god's book because part of my job is to come here and make you mad whoa come on because if you're living wrong and you ain't doing right read romans chapter 13 and see what i'm supposed to do with this sword word right here i'm supposed to eat you alive and and how am i going to do that if i'm not anointed with a gift because you understand human temper would not produce conviction human aggravation cannot produce repentance but if a man is gifted and an angel of the lord comes from heaven to anoint that gift and he enters into that channel to rebuke sin it'll produce a conviction it'll produce a repentance in the heart huh come on but if you don't have that then all he's going to do is yell at you and when you walk out of church you certainly don't feel rebuked you feel not spiritually rebuked anyways you feel like you've just you've just been yelled at all night that's why a real man of god if he enters into that channel he eats you up it is strange christians are the only people that can come and get yelled at and told how sorry they are and walk out crying saying thank you lord what do you reckon does that the gift of the holy spirit the heavenly holy spirit comes down to speak to your heart to show you how to correct and live better men cannot produce that i love this next statement peter says which things the angels decide to look into now this word look means to stoop down to bend the head and the body over to look to inspect the thing now you realize these angels of the lord were with you at your birth remember the prophet of god talked about when your mother was getting ready to give birth you there was a real sweet spirit oh sure i realized that was your soul that was you know just whatever you want to say it was but it was also the presence of the angel of the lord that behold your father's face for you because all of us have them as a matter of fact everybody has them you say everybody sure until the age of accountability that is everybody has a protective angel because god is just god gives everybody an opportunity to get right but what happens if an individual rejects the lord jesus very simple you reject god you reject everything that comes with him so take these people that have lived like the world and here they are on the other side they don't want nothing to do with religion but yet they'll talk about supernatural experiences when they almost drowned and all of a sudden something happened what was that the angel of the lord was protecting and watching over them to give them an opportunity to get saved but whenever they cross that line the angel just walks away just like god and every other heavenly thing but what about you that accept he doesn't leave he stays there he's watched over you at your birth and he'll watch over you at your death he was with you when you was on the barstool he was with you when he was running around doing this out in the other come on out and the day you got saved by the tom this angel stooped i i've watched him smoke i've watched him drink i've watched her curse i've watched her lie but i've never seen this before the joy that fills your face the tears coming down your eyes the chains that come over you the angel it's so is so peculiar to them that they actually stoop down what is going on because they don't understand redemption when an angel messes up that's it god don't even give him a second chance but when you and i mess up he gives us chance after chance after chance after chance after chance he preserves us whereas he doesn't preserve these angels that fall they have no idea they don't understand what's going on because they can't relate to what salvation looks and feels like watch this in matthew chapter 4. notice that let's look and see what these angels of god are jesus here fighting with the devil the devil leaveth him that's a pretty good thing you just get in such a condition that the devil will go away we're in pretty good shape then anyway notice the bible said behold angels came and ministered unto him do you know what this word minister means it means to glory wait at a table and offer food and drink to guests you and i know what we call those in modern day terms a waiter so in other words these angels are your special waiter in life i want to ask you a question if you're sitting down at a table and you've run out of drink and you ain't got no silverware and they've been waiting 30 minutes on ketchup do you sit around well you know that that's just the way it is oh i know i i make some of you i know how you are [Music] where in the world is that woman at i've been waiting 30 minutes on that sketchup where she gotta have this ketchup i'm leaving her a five dollar tip i'll leave her five cents in a piece of my mind careful how many pieces of your mind that you leave you can't get them back when you leave them but this is what god called the angels of the lord the very word that he uses for angel is a servant so that means if the devil was an angel in the beginning he was actually created to be my servant no wonder he hates us because in his very creation with all his brightness all of his glory all of his pomp and beauty he was still subjugated to the bride from the very beginning no wonder he hates you but now these angels of the lord are servants to the bride so if you're sitting there and you need more drink what do you do you call for them uh excuse me get more pepsi some more waters we need salts or napkins never understood why in the world these waiters and waitresses come to a table full of youngins and bring about one or two little napkins usually the ones ain't got no kids they bring about one napkin or two we would sit in a little place the other day and this lady brought us a break old great big old stack like that and i said you got kids she said yes i do but they were created to be your servant so you need more drink what do you do call for it oh i want to tell you something tonight amen as a sign as a dollar of god if you need more holy ghost if you need more joy if you need that refilling of the holy spirit all you've got to do is call for it they are created for your service do you remember the two women that came in the prayer line brother branham said one come up with stomach trouble another one had a cancer on her and he said after they went out of the prayer line and said they live right next door to each other nearly he said the one got up that morning and said she got hungry glory scrambled up some eggs and fried some bacon and drink some coffee and said that tastes pretty good jordan she made sausage a few other things for long she said i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed she went down to the house to tell her friend about it and she's out there shaking the bed sheet looking for that cancer that had fallen off her body you know what brother adam said he said the angel of the lord was passing through that neighborhood amen and when he brought one healing to one he brought the healing to the other that's what i'm trying to tell you tonight your prayers your desires your burdens has created activity and another round be on our eyes if we could only open up to see it we would recognize that the angels of the lord are here tonight to serve your needs they don't go back up to heaven and then pop back down they encamp about those that fear the lord oh bless his holy name can you say praise the lord now remember we're not supposed to worship these angels as paul said in colossians 2 18 the worshiping of angels but we should give credit where credit is due it isn't always the holy spirit directly specifically in contact doing an action have you ever felt when you've asked god for something you feel like when you're praying sometimes you feel the holy spirit so close in the room like you can just reach out and describe a big piece of him and pull him in and then there are times you pray and you feel something it's supernatural but it isn't exactly god you know what it is because jesus said that the angels of the lord are witnesses y'all don't know how bad i wish i had two more hours here tonight because i would absolutely turn you inside out some of these things i got laying up here how do i know i'd turn you inside out because it turned me inside out when i read them do you understand that there are note takers you think you take good notes in church not nearly like these angels of the lord they pay attention to everything that's going on matter of fact brother man said there's recording angels in every church service how do these men of god lace and preach the same messages because god has got notes going back up to heaven how does he know on the other side of the bride is getting ready because these investigating angels are taking these messages back to daddy oh he knows it he knows the end from the beginning but you're not listening to me he uses these servants as part of his economy it's just like he could send har laborers into the harvest he could just snap his fingers and send preachers everywhere but jesus didn't say he did it that way he said you pray so it goes to prove you have not because you ask not now if you're sitting at the table of god or you're sitting at the restaurant and it's like this mexican place up here they painted it white didn't they it's new i saw that thing looks good and you're sitting up there you know and maybe an hour goes by and you are so thirsty you could suck on a hickory nut you are just absolutely pour out with thirst and that lady of that man has passed you by about 15 times don't you go walking out of there and saying this is the sorriest establishment i've ever been in you know where the real fault lays because you wouldn't stop them to say hey i need more words amen in case you forgot it right this is what jesus said and when you ask ask in faith believing that you're going to receive what you asked for if you need more peace in your life all you've got to do is ask god of it listen there's no supernatural formula here this is not some supernatural workup oh you know if i could hold my hands in a certain way or if i can get so sincere that's why you see people around this message that have yet to break themselves free of all this old traditionalism that they've carried over from pentecost apostolic house and you'll see them when they're praying they're trying to force god to hear them oh god oh god you don't have to do all of that just say the words lord i have a need it doesn't matter if you're crying when you say it doesn't matter if your straight face don't matter if you're stoic it's an old robot all you gotta do is ask for it [Applause] and the servants are listening oh more holy ghost coming right up more victory coming right up you just have to take time to ask for it friends you're going to find most of the nonsense we carry on ain't nothing but just traditional carryover it is but you know we come to the altar and you'll see people that they're banging and screaming and hollering you know 90 of the time and i've been a minister going on next year 30 years i've been around the world a couple different times now the majority of that stuff you see like that ain't nothing but a bunch of emotional work up and people trying to convince themselves to be spiritual i don't doubt there's some sincerity i don't doubt there's some people that mean business with god when they come up with tears in their eyes but that ain't what god required of you you don't have to look at the waiter and say oh please mr wade please i'm begging you i'm on my hands and he's bringing me another silverware you're the one in charge the customer is always right oh that was sweet glory all you got to do is say bring me another silverware according to the laws of that organization if you ask for it they're hired to see to your need oh god have mercy so you gotta open up your mouth oh praise the lord listen to this my oh thank you lord jesus my my my listen to this in genesis chapter 28 verse 12 jacob dreams about a ladder the angels of god are ascending and descending up and down on it now jesus picks this up in john 1 51 and he said very verily i say unto you hereafter you shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man now notice that the angels then for the new testament was given the commission to guard the lord jesus even in death if you want to see this in saint john chapter 20 verse 12 the bible said that they saw two angels sitting one at the head and the other at the foot where the body of jesus had laid do you know why they were there because david prophesied that not one cell of that holy body could corrupt so if one of them roman soldiers would have had coronavirus and spit out a coronavirus bug and they proved they got little tentacles on them like that and that little tentacle reached out and tried to get into the cells of the lord jesus one of the angels of god would have pulled a sword and cut his tentacles off even in death they were sitting there just like the rich man in lazarus the angels of god packed that rich man excuse me the lazarus packed him right to the bosom of abraham glory to god the very same angel that accompanied you accompanied you in birth when you get ready to take your last breath that angel will gather up your soul and pack you to your theophany body oh praise the lamb of god it's all around us they say i don't see nothing because you ain't looking same as right now in china right now in india right now in other parts of the world when the suns get ready to come up in a few hours there's going to be all kinds of activity going on in them countries and you'll be fast asleep it reminds me about the way the church is today they're fast asleep and can't see the supernatural moving amongst them amen but let's remember don't be sleeping virgins but be wide awake to see the calling and the coming of the lord now just a little bit just just just another minute or two i'm almost done notice now oh my thank you lord notice he tells us that the angels of the lord matthew 13 were called to do two things gather the elect and sever all right now listen i'll say something to you have you ever wondered why our church services are so anemic when it comes to membership you ever stop thinking about it now you go you look at osteen's bunch they've got millions on dreaming contributing he's got tens of thousands sitting in that stadium out there do you understand why he's not so many and why message people have so few it can't be updated and our singing ain't of today huh it ain't because we're antiques but what we don't see is the angels of the lord are commissioned by god to pull in and gather only the elect in our churches and to sever out anything that is not elect you say that's the craziest thing i've ever heard might have you might have had the same opinion if you'd been sitting by the pool of bethesda all them years when one angel was commissioned by god to trouble the waters and when the waters was troubled if you got in you got your healing if the waters wasn't troubled by that angel it was just an old murky pool but when the angel did something it changed the scene change the do you understand why there's always shake-ups amongst our people because these same angels that are called of god to gather are the same angels of god called to sever they trouble things create situations let me give you an example what i mean i don't mean they're mischievous now like a bunch of elves or some kind of folklore like that but they're commissioned by god to uphold truth is that right by the word remember paul said if an angel or something comes preaches anything country let that angel be accursed so true angels of god always punctuate the word like that lady said to brother branham but man tell them man that the angel of the lord told you to baptize in jesus name he said lady your argument is thinner than the brother shadow of a chicken have been starved half to death he said if the angel of the lord would tell me something different from the bible i'd believe the bible and not the angel but they're commissioned to do things let me show you what i mean in world war 1 the 11th month the 11th hour on the 11th day the bible said the angels of god who held the four winds of the world that of the earth that means that they're the ones that control world war three the bible said that god spoke to him i'm just kind of giving you a picture here this may not be verbatim it's the jest of it and these angels of the lord and world war one stepped out on the 11th hour 11th day 11th month and said stop and the entire world stopped fighting in a moment's notice they've got that kind of authority remember oh praise the lord that the angels of the lord was also the one who had the power over euphrates when hitler eichmann mussolini stalin all the rest of them when those spirits those anointings were released remember there was angels that had power over those demons had power over those anointings they've got the authority to create wars did you know that brother baby said in victory day and sierra vesta he said that the reason you see wars on the earth is because there are demons which were once angels demons that reside and control countries one demon gets jealous of another demon and starts an influence of a war on the earth kind of reminds me what happens in churches one preacher gets jealous of another preacher and then they split and come on one singer gets jealous of another musician of another one no no no no no one's a better cook one's a better sower one's a better and they get jealous and create wars i should have been a big amen huh but the angels of god have the power to uphold the truth so if there is angels of the lord that even have what the bible said was the inkhorn you remember that the encorn was the seal of god in other words if you're going to get the holy ghost this angel of the lord come by to seal you in your forehead what do you all reckon happens in message churches whenever we're set in a pew like this the word is going forth the anointing is falling around the place the angels of the lord are here to serve us and that angel with the holy ghost in his hand goes by your pew and you're not interested he just takes his little incorn he goes to the next person he's looking for somebody that's interested in the holy ghost well if you give the holy ghost he's there to fulfill the commission of god that you can receive the holy ghost what about on the other side of that you ever notice how when somebody quits church it's like a whirlwind like something they somebody flipped a switch and all of a sudden they're gone you know what that was the angels of the lord were allowing this they were forbidden that they were creating this they were stopping that they were doing this that that that this situation that everything just started falling in place until that person either got in or got out hallelujah if a man is going to preach he better learn to preach with the angel of the lord and a gift of god because if that angel servant if his job is to serve you then that means when i've come to this platform and i for many years now i'm saying i love to sing i love play music you all know that i enjoy worshiping and singing these songs and i like putting my little parts in you know and the big endings and all that that gives me goosebumps i just love that to me i like worshiping the lord big and loud and strong and i've set up these pianos around the world and sang and played but when i walked to the platform since i've been 14 years old i can feel the presence of a person stepping behind me for many years i've wondered what that is oh you say you making yourself something sure son of god child of god on my way to heaven wraps already i don't know you just pick the title call it what you want but every time i've stepped in the platform i may not always feel it there are times that i don't necessarily feel anything begin to move like that but i've lost count of the times that i've opened up that bible and i can feel a presence stepping behind me and i wonder god why did i say that why did i preach that why did that go that way why you understand what was you're sitting in these pews with a need your needs may not necessarily be on my notes and if that angel is here to serve you and i am yielded to the holy spirit then wherever that angel is commissioned of god to serve the need he moves through the anointing the anointing moves through the gift and next thing i know i've been off my notes for 20 minutes and got no i no idea what plan of glory to god ain't got no idea what planning i'm on but i'm having a good time wherever it is why because you had a need that's what pulled a man of god off his notes you ever heard him say how did i get here next time you hear somebody brother tom or somebody say that just jump up and cut arrested glory to god you understand what it is now it means that the angel of the lord is among us that the holy spirit is in the camp closing its nine it's 8 30. i got to quit cool you got work in the morning i'm tired you're tired one more thing if the angels of the lord are here to serve us then that means that until my purpose and this life is finished there's not enough coronas or bubonic plagues or aids or cancers or anything else that can stop me from doing what god called me to do because i'm protected by a host of servants that watch over my footsteps but remember don't ask god to lead your feet if you ain't willing to move him uh because the fact of the matter is he said he'll protect the footsteps of the righteous he'll order them but you got to be willing to move a lot of times we're in such fear right all this that and the other listen i get scared too i'm diabetic okay i don't want corona because i'm one of those i'm one of those classes of people that it's dangerous for old folk and diabetic and stuff like that it scares me but every time i get in a car and i go somewhere another i wash my hands i wear my mask i've got a red mask with a red beard big red mustache you ought to see it it's quite cool i'm gonna wear one i'm gonna have some fun with it if you know anything about me at all you know that that's pretty much my personality i try to be as safe and as comfortable as i can be but i also have to remember i was i was at a meeting here a few months ago brother tom and a lady come up and she and i had my head down listening at her you know and they were playing the music and i was trying to listen and and and she said my husband died of coven when she said that she spit on my face she didn't do it on purpose you know but but john i like to die i was standing on that platform i thought oh god i'm a dead duck sure has god made green apples [Music] but then i got to thinking about what brother banham said he said that whenever you're praying for somebody he said if you have a gift the gift stands between you and that disease he said if you don't have a gift he said that's why you anoint him with the oil anybody that knows homo gory at all knows he packs a bottle of oil in his pocket everywhere he goes because he said i don't have a gift of healing or a gift of faith he said so i anoint the sick with oil so that oil will stand between me and that disease sure this is a scary time for some people i i know we could politicize this thing the rest of the night but it's a scary time for some people my poor mother sitting home panics you know about panics about everything she's a warrior ward anyways and and some if the church got sick had an infection in their leg the lady that took the boy to the church he ended up in the hospital he had fevers and had all that kind of stuff it's from an infection his leg where he had a bad accident last year like killed him and the lady that brought him hugged by a mother and she called on the way down to church she was convinced she had corona she's a hypochondriac anyways my precious mother is a hypochondriac sure as god made i'm telling you the woman worries about everything i come in the other day and i sat down i said mom you oh god i'm saying this to make a point if we could just only open our eyes to another realm brother what we would see is that while we're out here serving in this whole world there's a host of helpers protectors gathered all the way around us hallelujah watching over our footsteps and taking care of us as we go if we could only believe it let me say it again in another land in another country in another place there's activity taking place around this old world right now i've been um most you know i graduated college february and i've been working online with colleges and other doctoral students and helping them with their work and trying to mentor them and coach them and i picked up a little old job that i've been doing and not not working it because it's anything i need the money about or nothing like that the lord's taking care of us throughout the pandemic and everything and but i did it for the online experience so that i can work my way into uh teaching college and you know because once you get these little jobs like this they're remote and then i can use that money and whatever i earn with those things and i can preach and nothing can get in the way of preaching and i can use that money for missions or other things that we have need up listen i got a girl that's a few years away from 16. somebody smile at me i need money cars are coming this is coming that's coming college is coming you know whatever and and i thought well this would be a good opportunity maybe for me to get involved in online teaching so i took a little position and and it's it's just a little tiny thing it's called vipkid and i teach chinese students how to speak english in beijing china and believe it or not this is where this message started kind of forming was when i would get up of course i got to get i got to be at four in the morning tomorrow morning teach them and we start with classes now it's after school for them when i get up now when i'm up at 10 04 tomorrow morning that fella he's like five or six o'clock after the whole day is almost expired and i got to thinking imagine that the whole time i was asleep there was activity going on and i thought oh church if we can only get ahold of that tonight how many more of our prayers are being answered right now there's things taking place i know i know i did it we are impatient we want it right now we want to be able to get a hold of it right this very moment we want to be able to say god i want to see the tangibility of it but listen to me we don't know what this dot connects to that dot the connection of that dot you don't know how many dots need to connect before your prayer can be answered that's why we have to be patient while we have to wait on the lord and say god i've asked you for it now i'm expecting that my pepsi is going to be full ketchup's going to be on the table or some of these theologians if they heard me preaching tonight what'd you learn in church get ketchup in your table theological right but god hides himself in simple things like this it's just as simple churches walking over and saying lord i heard somebody praying tonight's sister with a headache god papa i got a headache tonight but you sent an angel down to bring me comfort maybe you're hurting in your spirit you know i've come to find out there's a lot of emotional sickness god help me i'm working on some messages about how to fix these emotional problems i've got them eight years ago whenever i almost died in that motel room over diabetes that give me a little touch of ptsd i'm convinced of it certain things will happen i don't know if you're this way brother john but i i just all of a sudden i lock up and i panic it just hits me all at once every nerve in my body just stands on its end after a high prevalent i taught myself that you're okay you're okay the first year of having diabetes i'd have them little elevator type feelings that go on in your body i'd be standing the platform have one of them feelings and i'd freeze nobody knew it i didn't let nobody know i had a few of those moments up here the first few years or so you never knew it because i didn't i didn't want to i didn't want to hinder your enjoyment of the word because i was going through some little things so i just remained a good actor and kept a smile on my face and kept going but god help me i want to dig in i want you to pray with me because i'm going to start trying to travel this world if the lord open up these borders i'll get to every corner that i can get myself into and i want to find some truth and some answers in the message about how to cure these emotional diseases that are running rampant in our spirits why do you think young people are depressed why do you think people are committing suicide why do you think marriages are busting apart why do you think pastors can't keep their mind on nothing why do you think that congregations are in the biggest mess they've ever been healthiest horses can lift up the back into trucks but emotionally they're sick and crippled as a man's got three months to live come on somebody let's learn god i need help tonight i'm calling for the angels of the lord to come and assist me to come and help me if we could ever learn to call i believe we'd find that god answers a whole lot more than what we recognize he does we got to pay attention though we got to pay attention to the things that the lord does because listen friends sometimes the holy spirit moves so subtle and so sweetly and so quietly that sometimes if you're not careful you overlook it not realizing that was god all along through it hindsight is always 20 20. huh you look back on something yeah i see it now but what good did it do you just need after it happened god trained me to where that i can be so sensitive and if i ask you for something i can watch things take a step back and i can watch the holy spirit acted out right before my very eyes brother brahm said them early apostles were so sensitive to god that all the lord had to do was nod in permission and they knew it they went right to action right then god help me help me be so sensitive that i can feel the movements of the holy spirit when i pray i'll ask you a question have you ever felt so dis don't you know why we get in those conditions not just because we're human but because we have failed to step into this real position of a son and daughter of god where we can take a step in those moments take a step back and say okay god as awful as this seems somehow this is going to work out for my good and i'm calling on you to bring all the help that you can give me so that i can just sit back and watch you begin to work and do what needs to be done to solve these problems i believe if we were that sensitive i believe when we pray we wouldn't have to beat and rip at an altar now listen if you feel emotional go with what you feel i'm not telling you to choke back your emotions surely to god not that's the worst thing you can do there ain't nothing worse than a spiritual robot somebody don't know how to cry some of you big tough guys in here you know you men i never shed no tear you big real men cry they do matter of fact brother said the only emotion jesus ever showed was he cried we hold ourselves into such a place to where we don't even know how to express ourself i agree we get so emotional we get overwhelmed sometimes too emotional let your emotion flow but while you're emotional take a step back and say okay lord if you've placed waiters at my beck and call then i'm asking for you to bring somebody to fix this situation somebody to give me guidance here somebody to help me deal with that somebody to go deal with that son or that daughter or that husband or that wife or that grandkid somebody to deal these problems so i can come out on top of this whole thing's over with not come on on top to be arrogant not to be smart but to be a conqueror with humility and grace to be able to weather all the storms and say greater is he this in me than he that's in the world ministry of angels i'm so glad they're around [Laughter] i wonder if i was to ask you tonight to testify you could just do so by raising your hand how many had those experiences where you could have been killed something happened changed it turned it around just look around at yourself you ever had that moment when something was going that way and all of a sudden it went [Music] you think boy thank you lord yes thank you lord we give credit where credit is due thank you jesus we worship jesus but thank you angels thank you for being at your post of duty [Laughter] one more thing when brother brown was in that cave and the angel of the lord came and learned the message that he was commissioned to get this is my last point and we're gonna quit i had a brother asked me one time him and his wife brother ben i heard what you preach why he said because he said sure tell me what is it i'll try to help you he said if i'm in the bathroom or if i'm embarrassing a situation or a personal private situation i don't want no angel looking at me i said i'm so glad you brought it up to me i'm going to tell you the answer if you want it he said i do i said have you ever been at a restaurant and tried to engage in a serious conversation with somebody i said yeah i said does a real genuine respectful trained waiter stand there and take note of your whole conversation and pay attention to everything you're doing he goes no i said what did they do i said they go stand in the corner and mind their own business until it's time to serve again i said i want to let you know something even though these angels of the lord even though they surround us never my friend we laugh but there are people i had a sister tell me my wife one time she said i don't like that i've always had a problem with people looking at me and then you preached angels watching us she said oh god she said if i'm changing clothes i don't want no angel and i told her the thing about business until you've changed into your nightgown or whatever that is it's funny i agree but for some people they get this kind of stuff in their mind remember they're servants they're servants they're not there to interrupt they're not there to intrude and if you break the word of god don't expect an angel of the lord to step in and save your hide they follow numbers and the orders is the word the commission comes from god and they follow that to the letter stand with me not everybody's smiling so big some of you were saying watch me in the bathroom yeah that's what she said i was genuinely worried about it amen let's sing something buddy let's worship the lord a moment before we go now with everything i preached to you tonight do you believe what i said to you is the truth believe it come from the message from the bible it's not brother ben's words is it just telling you what he already told us in his message now this is what i want you to do i could stand here for some kind of an emotional thing i'd rather leave this night with you going home pretty aware much conscious start thinking about the message tomorrow when you wake up and the message comes on your mind i want you to start identifying with what's been said i am a son of god i am a daughter of god if i need help all i have to do is call for it that's it i don't want to try to work you up into some try to beg you to believe this you're either going to believe it or you ain't going to believe it when you go to bed at night wake up tomorrow go through the week thinking about the message i want you just to recognize i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god and i've got help if i need it and all i have to do is call for it just picture them waiters and it'll help you god bless you i love you i've enjoyed speaking to you as i always do see the opportunity to come to elkton i hope it never ends i hope one day i'm raptured right here just like this brother tom that'd be good they'd be fine with me i sure love you people appreciate your love for me for my family pray for us the lord help us protect us as the roads are opening up i've been going about roughly three meetings every weekend since june and um there are a few opportunities uh coming up probably late next year depending on exactly how this goes with covid to try to do some actual physical in the country mission work but at the time most of us just been virtually trying to preach overseas and on the internet and things like that so normally i'd be asking you to pray for the travels and all that but pray for these little meetings and things that are being constructed going into these other lands and i just did an international convention a brother set up from ottawa with several other great men of god with steve brassand from montreal from uh brother john danqual from toronto another brother from new york and just different brethren we all had a night and preached and i was preaching this on the angels of the lord at the end of the service i said baby the angels bring healing he said i had back trouble for 30 years he said i can't even hardly get up out of a bed out about he said all of a sudden something warm come over my body so i've been healed ever since shouting the glory of god running up down the streets let me tell you something brother the thing i'm preaching to you and i ain't just lip service all you got to do is call for him and they're ready to bring whatever your faith declares i love you let's sing buddy god bless you church i'll see you when i see you pray for us
