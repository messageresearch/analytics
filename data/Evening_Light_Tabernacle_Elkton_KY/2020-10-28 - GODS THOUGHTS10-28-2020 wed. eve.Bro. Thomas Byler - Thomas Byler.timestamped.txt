[0:00] certainly i believe why people mis miss
[0:02] god
[0:03] because they fail to think the way that
[0:05] god thinks
[0:07] and the way that god does amen
[0:11] amen brother we all know that if you're
[0:14] ever going to shoot a big boat
[0:15] you got to think like a big bump right
[0:19] you got to think like it you know you've
[0:21] got to go in that avenue and if you're
[0:22] ever going to
[0:23] amen if you're ever going to marry a
[0:25] wife if your wife
[0:26] your husband if you're ever going to
[0:28] marry
[0:30] let me tell you think like god thinks
[0:35] so the first way back before the
[0:36] foundation of the world we know that he
[0:38] had the fable that
[0:39] the devil had wrong thoughts he said he
[0:41] did not have the right thoughts
[0:44] amen and truly
[0:50] amen i believe that the body is becoming
[0:52] one with god in order to be united with
[0:54] him
[0:55] we got to think like he does if we're
[0:56] ever going to unite with him
[0:58] amen let me just say this while it comes
[1:00] to my mind i truly believe the rapture
[1:03] and the real christians are going to be
[1:04] so simple
[1:06] it's going to be so simple
[1:10] that people will miss it people
[1:13] will miss the rapture because it's the
[1:16] simplicity that it's going to be
[1:18] uh you know i'm humble it's going to be
[1:21] amen
[1:22] come on down come drop down into time
[1:25] and we know what happened of course with
[1:27] adam and eve and so forth and
[1:28] amen and and even the serpent and so
[1:30] forth come down to cain and abel
[1:33] and here cain and abel they both come to
[1:35] church
[1:36] they both worship god isn't i right
[1:39] they were very religious
[1:42] very serious but they brought the wrong
[1:46] offering cain brought the wrong offering
[1:49] he didn't worship the way that god
[1:52] wanted him to worship
[1:53] and did god accept it now tell me what
[1:57] all the churches and everybody that's
[1:58] worshipping the court
[1:59] i'm not according to the word of god do
[2:01] you think god is going to accept it
[2:03] no they're going to find themselves in
[2:06] the
[2:06] in outer darkness what is that outer
[2:10] darkness that outer
[2:12] darkness is the tribulation period
[2:15] outer darkness is when there's no light
[2:17] by the bright
[2:19] no light at all right because how many
[2:22] knows as long as the holy spirit is
[2:24] still on the earth
[2:25] dealing with us gentiles there's a
[2:26] little light
[2:29] but truly can we say that it will be
[2:33] completely blacked out
[2:36] in this generation when the holy spirit
[2:39] leaves
[2:40] amen but as long as there's a little bit
[2:43] of light there
[2:44] amen they're still amen there's still a
[2:46] little bit of light it
[2:47] isn't out of darkness but when that
[2:49] lifts its outer darkness or
[2:52] we would call it utter darkness
[2:54] tribulation period god's wrath to be
[2:56] poured down
[2:57] amen upon mankind and god
[3:00] we don't want to be here then you can't
[3:03] imagine it
[3:04] being that bad is that right
[3:08] and that we're right at the brink of it
[3:11] just think of it
[3:12] we're right at the brink of it
[3:16] so we find denominations and so forth
[3:18] they're still worshipping
[3:21] but they're worshiping in maine
[3:24] cain worshiped in maine
[3:28] he was serious he built a church he made
[3:30] an
[3:31] altar he brought the fruits of the
[3:32] ground and so forth and he brought all
[3:34] of that
[3:35] sacrifice to god but cain i mean abel he
[3:38] had a revelation god quickened to him
[3:40] that it's going to take blood to cover
[3:43] this thing
[3:45] it's going to take more than an apple to
[3:47] cover this it's going to take me
[3:49] more than oranges and flowers it's going
[3:51] to take blood something's going to have
[3:52] to die for what happened
[3:54] and what did he do he went out there and
[3:56] got a bloody lamb lamb and just hacked
[3:58] it the piece of the shred
[3:59] amen that cain was probably as the
[4:01] probably god put it saying what is wrong
[4:03] with you brother
[4:04] what are you doing you look like a
[4:06] horrible sight
[4:08] you are look like a sight to be look at
[4:11] that blood all over your face and your
[4:12] hands
[4:13] my you're just swallowing and you're all
[4:16] in that blood
[4:17] you know i squirted all over you
[4:22] huh cain was thinking his thinking
[4:26] wasn't right
[4:27] he didn't realize that even the prophet
[4:30] of god said that you know in the old
[4:31] testament people used to have to do that
[4:34] get it all over you because you had to
[4:35] be spring
[4:37] with the blood it had to be part of you
[4:41] just like the blood of jesus christ it's
[4:43] got to be all over you
[4:45] it's going to be very obvious that your
[4:47] blood you're covered by the blood
[4:53] amen and then they may not look good
[4:56] people man i'll tell you what
[4:57] it might cause people to scream and
[4:59] shout and cry
[5:01] hallelujah and everything else
[5:05] amen but the dead they still the canes
[5:08] they might say boy well look at that
[5:10] sight
[5:10] look at how they're acting how foolish
[5:14] that looks
[5:15] huh but that's what god's accepting
[5:19] god's what god's receiving
[5:23] somebody that's gotten hold of the blood
[5:25] that is identified
[5:27] with their sacrifice i mean believe you
[5:30] got to be identified with your sacrifice
[5:33] cain was not identified with the
[5:34] sacrifice abel was identified with the
[5:37] sacrifice
[5:39] amen and god accepted it and said that's
[5:42] my
[5:42] that i accept that worship
[5:45] he was accepted oh
[5:49] hallelujah i hope everybody at evening
[5:51] that time everybody to come out on this
[5:53] wednesday night and everybody on the air
[5:54] works i hope
[5:55] everybody's listening god either accepts
[5:58] your worship to him
[5:59] or he don't accept it
[6:07] you're accepted or you're not accepted
[6:10] if you're not accepted if it's not true
[6:12] and coming from the heart then it's like
[6:14] a stench in god's nose
[6:17] i don't want to bring worship that's a
[6:19] stench in god's nose
[6:22] how many believes and unless the blood
[6:23] of christ is on your heart tonight
[6:25] it's a sense it's a formality
[6:31] god doesn't look for just formalities
[6:36] amen when we get to heaven
[6:40] it's not going to be well maybe i need
[6:42] to say thank you lord
[6:44] maybe i need to say praise the lord
[6:47] well maybe i'd better try to sing
[6:48] amazing grace how sweet
[6:51] no it's not going to be formal it's
[6:53] going to come from the heart
[6:56] thank you lord thank you lord thank you
[7:00] lord
[7:02] that's what god is worth working for i
[7:04] mean looking for he's looking for that
[7:06] genuine
[7:07] amen better says man they came to church
[7:09] they worshipped they offered sacrifice
[7:11] but they did it and it become calm to
[7:13] him and god refused that when your
[7:15] worship
[7:16] to god becomes common god don't accept
[7:19] it anymore
[7:23] isn't that what the prophet said then
[7:26] it's the thoughts of god
[7:28] i mean it's glad to know the thoughts of
[7:30] god you can properly worship when you
[7:32] know the thoughts of god
[7:34] one god when you know what god is
[7:36] expecting from you
[7:39] but if you don't know what god is
[7:41] expecting you don't know how to do it
[7:45] can i just say what comes to mind
[7:48] let me tell you something we might call
[7:50] ourselves message believers we may have
[7:52] been this in 40 years
[7:54] that still don't make you right you can
[7:57] still be dead wrong and i've been in
[7:59] this message for
[8:00] i don't know how many years
[8:03] god is not looking at how much you know
[8:05] the message how many quotes you know or
[8:06] how many stories you can tell
[8:09] he is looking at your heart's condition
[8:11] and whether he dwells in there or he
[8:13] does not
[8:14] [Music]
[8:18] amen what age are we living in
[8:26] what age are we living what are we
[8:27] talking about tonight
[8:29] the thoughts of god
[8:32] in what age
[8:36] are we living in
[8:42] mind age you know when god restored the
[8:44] church he began to restore the man but
[8:46] just shall walk by faith luther's time
[8:50] come on up this is for sanctification of
[8:52] the heart
[8:53] wesley and them amen satanified got to
[8:56] be sanctified
[8:57] isn't that right all the way up here
[8:58] come all the way up to the mouth
[9:01] speaking your tongues in the
[9:02] interpretation of tongues and so forth
[9:04] all the way to the bow
[9:06] but what was it then we could come up to
[9:09] the
[9:09] prophets prophet even the prophet of god
[9:12] to be able to see
[9:14] see what color hair eve had all with his
[9:16] eyesight
[9:17] but the last part of the man is what
[9:22] his mind we're living in the
[9:26] mind age the prophet of god began to
[9:30] many times many messages towards the end
[9:32] there
[9:33] but he began to talk about the back part
[9:35] of god's mind
[9:36] can i just read you a little quote
[9:39] brother them says now god's secret
[9:40] mystery he had before the world began
[9:43] now
[9:43] back in the back part of god's mind
[9:49] amen hallelujah think about it one time
[9:53] god says
[9:54] my ways are as far as the heavens from
[9:56] yours
[9:57] but there come a time how many believes
[9:59] there come a time when that won't be
[10:01] that way anymore men before we go there
[10:05] let's just go down through the old
[10:06] testament a little bit shall we
[10:09] so we look at kate and abel
[10:13] they didn't think alike
[10:17] did they no they didn't think alike at
[10:20] all
[10:21] were their ways the same
[10:25] because i'll tell you you'll act the way
[10:26] that you think
[10:28] and cain he had a certain way of
[10:30] thinking
[10:33] brother branham even said that cain had
[10:35] the kind of religion that he says you
[10:37] know
[10:37] here it is lord this is the best i can
[10:40] do
[10:41] accept it or reject it what did the man
[10:44] say to god i'll do with it
[10:45] he will reject your attitude
[10:48] god doesn't accept what you offer him
[10:51] the best that you can do
[10:53] no you come on his terms
[10:56] you come the way he says and on his
[10:59] sermons or he
[11:00] he rejects it completely but cain had
[11:03] the idea this is the best i can do i
[11:04] forget brought it to you
[11:05] god don't want to accept it that's fine
[11:08] and he got the hate
[11:10] able because god accepted him and he
[11:13] let that hatred brew and he began to
[11:16] have such
[11:17] terrible ways until he killed his own
[11:19] brother become a murderer
[11:21] tried to get rid of his brother that
[11:24] genuinely was worshiping god
[11:29] that was king tried to get
[11:32] rid of him amen
[11:36] he certainly had not god's ways did he
[11:39] never has had god's ways he didn't think
[11:43] like he
[11:43] god was thinking amen but abel did think
[11:46] the way that god was thinking
[11:49] amen always my ways are above your waist
[11:53] how about pharaoh and moses talk about
[11:56] them for a minute
[11:57] how many know they thought completely
[11:59] different
[12:04] stop i want to go back let's pick up
[12:07] moses in a minute we go back to noah
[12:10] noah and the world is that right
[12:13] noah went up on top of the hill and i
[12:15] still ain't seen the noah's ark how many
[12:18] he knows are how many has been up there
[12:21] seen
[12:21] what they built what they called noah's
[12:23] ark not nobody here huh
[12:26] but a joke ben is a bus and we'll all go
[12:28] see noah's ark sometime
[12:31] we can use the exercise i understand
[12:33] it's a long
[12:34] walk am i right but however big that
[12:38] thing is
[12:39] it's huge from what i understand i think
[12:40] brother troy and them and some of them
[12:42] have went up
[12:42] talked about and so forth but they're
[12:45] noah went
[12:45] on top of that mountain is that right
[12:49] probably had four-wheel drives to get up
[12:51] there you know
[12:53] they had to have some serious pulling
[12:54] power to get it way up there
[12:57] and now i look like the most foolish
[12:59] person in the world
[13:02] but didn't even paul
[13:05] say that god chooses the foolish things
[13:07] of the world
[13:09] to confound the wise
[13:13] huh sure he did
[13:17] and noah seemed like a foolish person
[13:21] foolish person to go out there and build
[13:24] that great big
[13:25] boat you know
[13:28] and i think every one of us that
[13:30] respects god
[13:31] does this if john hershberger if any of
[13:35] you would come to me and you would say
[13:37] well god told me this was going to
[13:39] happen and he told me to do this or die
[13:41] to the other
[13:43] you and i would be careful about what we
[13:45] said or did
[13:47] not the only time you wouldn't really
[13:48] have to be careful is
[13:50] if you know that it's contrary to the
[13:52] word of god
[13:54] that's the one way we would gauge it but
[13:56] if you couldn't really judge it on that
[13:58] i'd zip my lip huh
[14:04] just like that video we showed of that
[14:06] preacher
[14:07] predicting that it would be chaos come
[14:10] this election
[14:11] well folks you don't have to read much
[14:13] of the news to know that they're
[14:14] organizing all kinds of rallies to bring
[14:16] disruption all over the place so
[14:18] they're already according to the news
[14:20] you know they're planning it
[14:22] but i can't say yey or nay but there's
[14:24] only one thing left to do and that is to
[14:26] wait
[14:26] find out if it was of the lord it'll
[14:29] come
[14:30] to pass if it wasn't then hey then truly
[14:33] was just a
[14:34] nightmare or a dream you know
[14:39] but it certainly would look like but
[14:41] what i'm trying to say is somebody says
[14:43] that hey the lord said
[14:44] this so forth that hey it's time to pay
[14:47] a little attention it catches your ear
[14:50] it's different if you just say well i
[14:51] think well that's what we did let me
[14:53] think too we all have an opinion
[14:55] but when you say the lord told me yeah
[14:58] that brings it up to a whole new level
[15:00] and that's the way it was with noah is
[15:03] that right noah told the world i'm
[15:05] telling you people
[15:07] i'm for 120 years i i'm coming out
[15:11] sunday morning
[15:12] again i want to preach the same message
[15:14] i did last sunday
[15:15] it's going to rain people
[15:20] all right somebody closing prayer
[15:23] i'll see you all next week huh open up
[15:26] again the next week year
[15:28] after year 120 years folks you better
[15:32] get right with god he told me to build
[15:33] this ark i'm a beaten away from week the
[15:35] week
[15:36] that sound that you hear that hammering
[15:38] that you're here and all of that
[15:39] that's because god told me to get ready
[15:41] he's going to flood the earth
[15:42] it's going to rain
[15:46] do you realize they probably didn't even
[15:49] know what the word
[15:51] rain meant what do you mean
[15:54] rain noah cause it ain't never done no
[15:57] raining all we ever have
[15:59] is a little mist that comes down from
[16:00] the heaven and wets everything
[16:02] we've never had a downpour isn't that
[16:04] what isn't that true
[16:06] the bible says they never did have a
[16:07] rain so they find out what rain means
[16:09] first
[16:11] yeah it's going to rain and it's going
[16:12] to keep raining and it's going to flood
[16:14] it until this mountain's going to pick
[16:16] up the
[16:17] boy i'll tell you what that's going to
[16:18] be some deep stuff
[16:21] yeah they found out it got real deep
[16:23] didn't it
[16:27] did you ever see pictures of people
[16:28] climbing on the rocks and
[16:30] half naked and everything else trying to
[16:33] find a place
[16:34] to live for just a few more minutes
[16:37] before drowning and
[16:39] certainly can you imagine even if it was
[16:42] a
[16:43] flood today all of the people out there
[16:45] with the tattoos and
[16:47] freaking looking people how to do their
[16:49] hair and everything you'd have all kinds
[16:51] of
[16:51] you'd say what is that crawling on that
[16:53] rock that's how it was back then it was
[16:55] terrible
[16:57] people are utterly vile anymore but
[17:00] there they were drowning they found out
[17:02] yeah it did but it won't be no flood
[17:04] this time folks if people will
[17:06] burn it's gonna be a fire
[17:11] amen we don't say it's gonna flood but
[17:14] we can come in here and we can preach
[17:16] every service guess what people it's
[17:19] gonna burn
[17:23] amen it's all gonna burn
[17:26] with fervent heat the elements shall
[17:29] melt with fervent heat
[17:30] i heard brother brown talking about them
[17:31] gas is up in the rap
[17:34] atmosphere here catching fire
[17:40] you know that stuff that they're trying
[17:42] to keep from gases up in the atmospheres
[17:44] those are catch fight the heavens will
[17:46] be on fire
[17:48] and the earth will catch fire it'll burn
[17:50] it'll be a fire unlike anybody has ever
[17:53] seen amen
[17:56] but we can preach it why because god
[17:58] said it
[18:00] i like that song david said standing on
[18:02] the promises of god
[18:04] amen but i'm talked about and i was
[18:06] listening today he says you know every
[18:07] word of god
[18:08] is god's promise
[18:12] amen when god promises something
[18:15] he don't have to promise nothing all
[18:18] he's got to do is say it
[18:19] and it's his promise because it isn't
[18:21] going to come back boy
[18:24] every word of god is his promise
[18:29] it won't return void and i'll tell you
[18:31] right now
[18:33] that's where we want to be in is part of
[18:34] his promise it's probably part of his
[18:36] word
[18:37] because heaven the nurse will pass away
[18:39] but his word shall never
[18:40] pass away amen
[18:44] so guess what he kept preaching and kept
[18:46] preaching he kept preaching until
[18:56] crash lightning huh
[19:00] everybody in their beds woke up that was
[19:03] a terrible illustration by the way
[19:06] everybody woke up what oh man
[19:10] it ain't never thundered before never
[19:12] enlightening before but here it is
[19:16] go read isaiah where it talks about when
[19:18] the destruction from the almighty comes
[19:20] people's hearts will melt
[19:25] just all their spirit will be gone
[19:29] they won't have any pride anymore
[19:31] they're going the dens in the caves of
[19:33] the rock they know god's coming
[19:36] when all that happens they'll know that
[19:38] god's coming folks
[19:39] he's rising and they're going to have to
[19:42] give an account for all they did
[19:45] run your jaws now you'll answer for it
[19:49] later
[19:51] yeah that's right take him out
[19:53] everything now but he'll come into your
[19:55] life
[19:55] later amen you won't get out of this
[19:59] scotch-free
[20:00] no you can even put a gun to your head
[20:03] that isn't going to end anything
[20:06] new you can't get out of it amen
[20:10] here it came how many knows did absolute
[20:12] either
[20:13] noah had what he had god's word
[20:19] which was god's thought amen
[20:22] it was his thought and it was his word
[20:24] and he preached it amen to the whole
[20:26] world
[20:26] and as stupid as it may have seemed to
[20:29] the world
[20:31] the smartest thing that anybody did was
[20:33] to get into that
[20:34] ark how many believes the smartest thing
[20:38] you'll ever do in this time
[20:39] in this world is to get into the ark of
[20:42] christ
[20:45] brother brown talked about the end
[20:46] coming and so forth and
[20:48] the band was living in jeffersonville
[20:51] moved over to tucson people were
[20:53] leaving there and they wanted to go to
[20:54] tucson and they were asking where should
[20:56] we be where should we be
[20:57] to make this rapture to escape where
[21:00] should we be
[21:01] should we go to tucson should we go to
[21:03] jeffersonville
[21:05] jesus said i got the word from the lord
[21:07] brother man says i got the word from the
[21:08] lord
[21:10] huh he said to tell you
[21:13] just gather in christ the king
[21:16] you ain't gotta not gather in
[21:18] jeffersonville or tucson
[21:20] but you better be in christ the only
[21:23] place of safety is in christ
[21:27] how many is glad for that amen
[21:33] amen
[21:37] moses oh man
[21:41] maybe i don't know how long their hair
[21:44] was back then
[21:46] the picture showed pretty long hair we
[21:48] definitely call him my hippie
[21:52] long hair long beard
[21:55] wasn't this beard according to picture
[21:56] way down here
[21:58] you know sticking his hand
[22:03] coming up requesting an
[22:06] audience with pharaoh
[22:09] huh and he got his audience with pharaoh
[22:15] pharaoh prestigious
[22:18] mighty
[22:23] i guess they were what the greatest
[22:24] nation on earth
[22:27] they're the greatest kingdom on earth
[22:30] come up there
[22:34] and he come up there and say what do you
[22:35] want moses what do you want
[22:37] but i want to just tell you what
[22:40] god has in mind god promised the
[22:44] children of israel those slaves that you
[22:46] got he
[22:46] rushed promised them back way back a few
[22:49] bibles
[22:50] not bibles but a few books back i'm not
[22:51] sure just which one
[22:53] it was but he says he's going to amend
[22:56] the children of israel be
[22:57] delivered into egypt so forth they'll go
[22:59] captive for 400 years and after
[23:01] so long a time i'm going to deliver them
[23:04] and bring them out huh
[23:08] moses perhaps began to preach the
[23:09] pharaoh and it's that this time
[23:12] that it's time to let him go
[23:16] amen pharaoh asked well who sent you i
[23:19] know you ain't here by yourself huh
[23:22] what what nation do you represent what
[23:25] army do you represent
[23:27] who sent you he said well i am
[23:31] that i am because didn't even moses say
[23:34] look when i get up there who am i going
[23:36] to say that sent me
[23:37] and he says just tell them i am that i
[23:39] am sent you
[23:41] i imagine pharaoh i don't know how much
[23:44] he was versed into hebrews and
[23:46] their god perhaps he didn't know what
[23:47] who the i am the iam was perhaps he
[23:49] didn't
[23:50] i don't know but i would just presume
[23:53] perhaps he says the i am that i
[23:55] am wow what a riddle who is that
[23:59] it's god oh like i said a while ago when
[24:02] you said
[24:04] god it's time for ears to perk up a
[24:06] little bit
[24:07] pharaoh's ear should have perked up a
[24:09] little bit but he said god has sent me
[24:16] huh
[24:18] the bible's deep because i have to
[24:20] wonder
[24:21] i'm just going to wonder this if pharaoh
[24:23] wouldn't have let him go
[24:24] after the water turn into blood and
[24:27] everybody was drinking blood instead of
[24:28] water
[24:29] said all right i can't think this no
[24:31] more just get them and go
[24:33] but the bible says that god actually
[24:35] hardened his heart
[24:38] am i right harden his heart and he
[24:41] wouldn't let him go and wouldn't let him
[24:43] go
[24:45] amen i mean the fleas and stuff got so
[24:48] bad
[24:50] until he was in his bed no doubt and it
[24:52] says he was in his bed chambers and
[24:53] everywhere else
[24:55] and man he was trying to lay down and he
[24:57] felt little cleaves crawling up the lake
[25:01] under the brake and under the sheets and
[25:03] i don't know about you but i
[25:04] could not stand something like that i
[25:06] live in florida and i did that happened
[25:08] to me one time
[25:09] i tried our little old trailer when we
[25:11] first got married it was so infested
[25:13] with please we had to bomb it the next
[25:14] day
[25:15] like yo but why wasn't this fleas up in
[25:18] here
[25:19] so i can understand how pharaoh must
[25:21] have felt
[25:22] oh boy i'll tell you we're willing to do
[25:24] anything to get rid of all that
[25:26] but he still wouldn't let him go
[25:29] oh now he still wouldn't
[25:34] let him go not until
[25:38] the first spawn ain't that right
[25:41] finally moses said since you are so hard
[25:44] and you
[25:44] are you since you're so stubborn anybody
[25:47] that hasn't caught the blood on the
[25:48] lentil and so forth
[25:50] of every cow wasn't it even the animals
[25:53] from what understand and all the
[25:55] firstborn of human beings he always
[25:57] going to die
[25:58] and brother baby menstruated at one time
[26:00] he says those hebrews no doubt saw this
[26:02] great big black angel and the great weak
[26:04] wings
[26:05] coming out of the skies and coming down
[26:07] over the city
[26:08] made it coming down and that black thing
[26:10] was just coming down and everybody would
[26:12] run into their houses
[26:15] getting under the safety of their
[26:18] amen blood covered doors they would hear
[26:21] screaming
[26:23] they were here crying all through the
[26:25] city of egypt why
[26:27] one man had the thoughts of god and the
[26:30] other one
[26:32] thought he was more powerful than god he
[26:34] felt wrong
[26:36] isn't that right he thought wrong
[26:39] he didn't have god's thinking he had his
[26:42] own thinking
[26:44] and it didn't matter he was so stubborn
[26:47] with his own thinking
[26:48] i want you to know something that if
[26:50] you're a carnal person
[26:52] you are a stubborn carnal person because
[26:55] our carnal minds is
[26:56] stubborn oh it is stubborn it takes
[27:01] oh my it takes to get knocked down like
[27:04] paul did on damascus road
[27:08] and that right for us to break from our
[27:10] stubbornness
[27:11] he could not just stop and guess what
[27:13] not until his army
[27:16] huh was drowned in the red sea
[27:19] isn't that right it's red drowned in the
[27:22] red sea and i don't know if you ever
[27:23] watched that movie moses but
[27:25] it comes back i forget exactly the words
[27:28] but pharaoh's wife said something about
[27:31] my my here you
[27:34] are you don't even have
[27:38] army left
[27:42] moses who you thought so little of
[27:44] because god was with him
[27:46] he may just had a stick
[27:50] come on people is that awesome to think
[27:51] that it doesn't matter you ain't gonna
[27:53] have much if you've got god
[27:54] you got everything you got all you need
[27:59] if you got god on your side
[28:02] i'm so glad for that amen that if you've
[28:05] got god you've got what you need
[28:08] you can be happy praise the lord
[28:14] amen we're going to come down into the
[28:17] new testament
[28:19] now we know that the prophet taught us
[28:20] that god fulfills his scriptures
[28:23] in such simplicity one thing about god
[28:26] and the way that god thinks is
[28:30] in simplicity
[28:34] and what is the other word humility
[28:39] we as human beings we like it
[28:41] complicated we make it technical
[28:43] huh we always overlook everything we
[28:47] overshoot everything we're always
[28:49] trying to make everything big
[28:52] it has to be big it has to be great
[28:57] and most christians when they become
[28:59] christians want to become great
[29:01] and you brother bram says you go
[29:04] straight down you go vice versa
[29:07] because in order to become a christian
[29:09] you had to go down
[29:10] you had to become nothing and nobody
[29:14] amen that's how you even have to become
[29:17] to become a christian
[29:22] in hubility amen
[29:25] and so brother brandon made reference to
[29:28] one scripture he's talking about
[29:29] what john the baptist and so forth comes
[29:31] how that the clap
[29:32] the leaves will clap their hands and the
[29:34] high places will be made low and the
[29:35] lower places will be made high
[29:37] and oh the the hills will skip like rams
[29:40] and the
[29:40] all the leaves will cut their hand but
[29:42] they had an interpretation in their mind
[29:44] it's gonna be a great thing and brother
[29:46] bam says here comes an old
[29:48] long bearded man with a
[29:51] sheepskin wrapped around him whiskers on
[29:54] his
[29:55] saying repent the vipers
[29:58] huh and so forth and getting the people
[30:00] to repent and that was all of this when
[30:02] all the high
[30:03] places were made low isn't that right
[30:08] then john about to say says you know
[30:09] what did you come out to see
[30:11] and so forth you know he says talks
[30:13] about you generation of snakes
[30:15] the axes lay to the root of the tree
[30:19] all the high pharisees were brave
[30:22] brought low
[30:23] ain't that right the low places were
[30:25] made high
[30:27] at that time it was simplicity
[30:30] and yet they pretty much
[30:34] much missed john the baptist you know
[30:36] right
[30:38] i forget the percentage i forget the
[30:40] percentage
[30:41] that brother brandon gave of how many
[30:43] people knew that jesus was actually here
[30:46] it was not a very big percentage was it
[30:49] it was
[30:49] very small percentage of the people of
[30:51] the earth that actually even knew that
[30:53] he was here
[30:55] and let me just ask you this about
[30:56] malachi 4. behold i send you elijah
[30:59] prophet before the great and dreadful
[31:00] day of the lord
[31:01] do they come with that shall burn as an
[31:03] oven law that do wickedly
[31:05] shall be ashes and stubble under the
[31:06] soldier you feel all of these things
[31:08] malachi 4 god sends that malachi 4 and
[31:10] while he was here
[31:13] while he was here how many really knew
[31:16] he was
[31:18] how many open doors he put a batman 64
[31:20] and 65 right there at the end
[31:22] pentecostals had all put him out out
[31:26] amen so
[31:30] few actually knew that maleficent was
[31:32] actually here
[31:33] today we have a great mormon number that
[31:35] recognized it mean that right
[31:36] africa and all of those places even they
[31:38] exploded
[31:40] after the prophet was gone it's still
[31:42] they're still having a revival
[31:44] and that right well we send our
[31:46] missionary work and so forth whether
[31:47] there's people coming to the message out
[31:48] of the denominations and so forth
[31:51] amen but even they didn't realize it
[31:57] amen so we take this mysterious god we
[32:01] the
[32:02] one that created the heavens and
[32:05] far beyond ours
[32:08] and john the baptist introduces
[32:12] emmanuel god
[32:16] with us i think saint john
[32:20] first chapter some of where it talks
[32:21] about that jesus he was the express
[32:24] image of this person
[32:27] how many knows when jesus came he was
[32:29] the expressed
[32:31] image of god he
[32:34] expressed god perfectly
[32:39] he showed us perfectly how god thinks
[32:44] and how that god is a merciful god
[32:47] full of grace full of love
[32:50] full of truth so much so that when that
[32:54] woman was
[32:55] to stone him to kill him to death and
[32:57] they bring it to him
[32:59] and say here here's a rock your law says
[33:03] if you're of god that she's to be stoned
[33:06] killed isn't that right and he began to
[33:10] draw things in the sand
[33:12] how many times how many times the
[33:14] pharisees would ask him about
[33:16] paying taxes to caesar you know for all
[33:18] the terrible things he does because
[33:20] you know they support abortion if you
[33:21] pay your taxes you're supporting
[33:23] abortion
[33:24] maybe you made it a good case you know
[33:26] is that right
[33:28] uh so should we do this that will
[33:30] you know and jesus
[33:31] every time or whether it's a brother
[33:34] marrying
[33:34] his brother's wife because he passed
[33:37] away in the bible says you know you're
[33:38] going to do
[33:38] whose wife is going to be over there and
[33:40] all kinds of complicated questions to
[33:42] ask him
[33:44] and it says that at the end of it all
[33:47] no man there's asking many more
[33:48] questions
[33:51] i like that why because he was a
[33:54] fountain of wisdom man
[33:56] and he was the one that created the
[33:59] alphabet
[34:00] brother you know you're not gonna out
[34:03] talk him you're not gonna
[34:04] catch him in his words
[34:08] not him you aren't amen
[34:11] because that's what they tried to do is
[34:12] find fault in his words
[34:14] and they couldn't do it
[34:18] he had the perfect thought he had the
[34:20] perfect thinking he had god's thinking
[34:24] amen
[34:28] amen
[34:33] i know it's a rainy dark but it's not
[34:36] too cold
[34:38] night amen one of them nights
[34:41] where you could sure stay home amen or
[34:44] go home early
[34:46] isn't that right y'all smile
[34:50] come on i ain't reading your mind
[34:54] but you know it's always an honor it's
[34:56] all it's good to honor the lord
[34:58] i'm glad for the services that we have
[35:01] amen i believe it's the way that we
[35:02] honor the lord
[35:05] amen so we won't go too long but i want
[35:07] to go to
[35:08] first corinthians let's look at what
[35:10] paul said about the way
[35:12] that god thinks the thoughts of god and
[35:15] the way that he thinks
[35:17] because i'll tell you this i thank god
[35:20] in this generation that he truly told us
[35:22] how that god thinks because if you can't
[35:24] pick up on that and that become you
[35:27] you're gonna fail you're gonna miss it
[35:30] amen
[35:33] i think we'll go all the way down to
[35:37] um verse 25 of the first chapter of
[35:41] first corinthians let's go first
[35:45] corinthians 1
[35:46] and 25. let's say it forwards instead of
[35:50] backwards
[35:50] getting older you say things backwards
[35:53] let's go to the 25th verse of the first
[35:55] chapter the first corinthians see
[35:56] that's backwards anyway
[35:59] i do that a lot
[36:03] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[36:06] than men
[36:06] and the weakness of god is stronger
[36:09] than oh praise the lord
[36:13] how many knows weak little david
[36:17] was stronger than big monster goliath
[36:23] brother moses no matter how old he was
[36:26] and how feeble he looked
[36:27] he was stronger than pharaoh and all of
[36:30] his army
[36:36] david was stronger for you not many
[36:39] mighty
[36:40] not many noble are called muhammad knows
[36:42] that truly moses was
[36:44] a noble man he was a great man when he
[36:46] was in egypt but god had to take him on
[36:48] the backside of the desert
[36:50] paul also was a well-known scholar he
[36:52] was also a great man
[36:54] in that right so not always
[36:58] it says not very many are called doesn't
[37:01] mean that god doesn't call some of them
[37:03] is that right not many uh
[37:06] noble are called but god has chosen the
[37:09] foolish things of the world
[37:11] to confound the wise and god has chosen
[37:15] the weak things of the world to confound
[37:17] the things that
[37:18] are mighty
[37:22] amen
[37:27] when i thought about this scripture
[37:31] it reminded me of how that
[37:34] perhaps in today's world
[37:38] how did the world looks like come to
[37:39] church on wednesday and worship the lord
[37:41] and they think it's just kind of foolish
[37:44] sisters in their dress they dress kind
[37:46] of old-fashioned perhaps
[37:49] what the world calls foolish god calls
[37:52] great
[37:54] they might call you old-fashioned
[37:56] because you
[37:57] wear a dress or a skirt and you don't
[38:00] wear makeup you have long hair
[38:02] people can certainly identify you
[38:06] and they might call you old-fashioned
[38:08] but i call you holy
[38:12] amen and brother bam says you know
[38:16] old-fashioned really
[38:18] jesse bell that was long ago and she
[38:20] wore makeup so
[38:21] maybe that's old-fashioned huh
[38:25] she dressed herself up that's
[38:27] old-fashioned perhaps
[38:29] amen but we know the dogs ate her
[38:34] amen all you can say is well look i'm
[38:36] not of this world i'm not here trying to
[38:38] look like everybody else
[38:40] i'm trying to please my lord because one
[38:42] of these days what you call foolishness
[38:45] is gonna be gone and one day
[38:49] let me tell you something one day god
[38:51] will show the whole world
[38:53] that what the world call foolishness he
[38:55] chose
[38:57] that's his amen
[39:01] [Music]
[39:09] here's something to console here's
[39:14] something to encourage us
[39:16] out of weakness and humility god chooses
[39:18] the people to build his kingdom out of
[39:21] if you ever get to heaven or we if we
[39:24] ever stand in the presence of god with
[39:27] his church
[39:28] will stand in a bunch of people that's
[39:30] been weak and
[39:31] rejected and cast out by the world
[39:37] how many is glad not to fit in with the
[39:39] world cast out
[39:40] by the world they cast you out
[39:44] amen but brother brown says man a
[39:46] preacher came and says you know if i
[39:47] preach that they'll kick me out he says
[39:49] well which one do you want you want to
[39:50] be kicked out here
[39:52] or do you want to be kicked out over
[39:53] there you're going to get kicked
[39:56] out somewhere you're going to be
[39:58] despised
[39:59] somewhere you're going to be rejected
[40:02] somewhere
[40:03] i would rather be rejected by the world
[40:06] and the people of this world
[40:07] and to be accepted by god because we
[40:09] have a much longer revision
[40:11] than the next president or the next
[40:14] beyond that or the next beyond that
[40:15] we're looking prone to the end of it all
[40:17] and looking to the other worlds that's
[40:20] what we're looking to
[40:21] and we're getting ready for that world
[40:24] why do you dress like that sister
[40:26] because i'm getting ready for another
[40:28] world
[40:29] it's coming god promised it
[40:32] do you believe god's promises because if
[40:34] you do you better be getting ready
[40:37] are you with me
[40:41] we can rejected and cast out by the
[40:43] world
[40:46] and know this and
[40:49] know it nothings how many knows that
[40:52] most people think they know it all
[40:54] we're not know it alls
[40:57] but a band calls us know it nothings
[41:01] amen comes to mind
[41:04] you know what comes to mind
[41:10] right here paul i've read and came to
[41:12] you
[41:13] not with excellency of speech or wisdom
[41:15] declaring to you unto you
[41:17] the testimony of god for i am determined
[41:21] not to know anything
[41:25] among you except jesus christ and then
[41:28] crucified
[41:29] that's what you're going to know
[41:32] asked paul what he knew are you smart
[41:35] are you a scholar of the scholar sure i
[41:37] was
[41:37] but i had to forget all of that and to
[41:39] become nothing you know what nothing
[41:42] except that jesus christ died for my
[41:44] sins
[41:45] that's what i do know amen how many
[41:47] believes that
[41:54] god has chosen the weak things of the
[41:56] world
[41:57] to confound the wise i wish i knew what
[41:59] that word confound means
[42:04] and to confound the things which are
[42:07] mighty
[42:08] perhaps confused perhaps
[42:12] dumbfuzzle like how could that ever
[42:14] happen i'm sure pharaoh said that after
[42:17] he sat after
[42:18] he thought he would win he was
[42:20] confounded
[42:22] wow how did that ever happen
[42:25] confound the things that are mighty the
[42:28] base
[42:29] things of the world amen
[42:32] how many knows jesus was the chief
[42:35] base person
[42:39] huh isn't it something that jesus made
[42:42] sure
[42:42] that he was the one that washed the
[42:44] disciples feet
[42:45] first he gave him an example
[42:51] peter was like all the world isn't us as
[42:54] human
[42:54] humans are for the most part the
[42:56] disciples he it says
[42:58] uh i've got the scripture there but
[43:00] you'll know what i'm referring to i'll
[43:02] just make reference
[43:03] he says you know they there was a
[43:04] dispute among them who's going to be the
[43:06] greatest
[43:08] and that right that was their thought
[43:11] pattern that's what man thought
[43:13] who's going to be the greatest and jesus
[43:17] had to begin to tell him
[43:18] you know if you want to be the greatest
[43:20] you're going to have to be servant of
[43:22] all
[43:25] because here in the world that i'm
[43:27] speaking about the way that i think
[43:29] the last they're going to be first and
[43:32] the first here are going to be last
[43:34] there
[43:35] and that right you want to be top dog
[43:37] you want to be the first
[43:39] well guess what you'll be last over
[43:41] there
[43:42] but if you'll be the last that's why
[43:45] peter said
[43:46] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[43:50] god
[43:51] we as human beings and especially if
[43:53] you're a christian
[43:54] you humble yourself
[43:57] humble yourself because if you lift
[44:00] yourself
[44:01] up god will bring you down that's right
[44:04] that i that's how he believes that's the
[44:06] way god thinks that's
[44:08] what that's that's god's thoughts it
[44:09] used to be a mystery to us but that's
[44:11] what jesus taught
[44:12] that's what paul taught amen
[44:16] the things that are despised has god
[44:18] chosen the aid of things which are not
[44:21] to bring to not the things that are so
[44:24] that what
[44:25] no flesh should glory in his
[44:29] presence amen how many knows it's not
[44:32] about you it's not about me
[44:34] it's about him amen praise the lord
[44:44] brother ben makes a quote when jubilee
[44:46] here jubilee here
[44:48] jubilee year wait one another do service
[44:52] for one another don't be bigger than
[44:53] somebody else
[44:55] try to see how little
[44:58] you can be
[45:02] amen
[45:05] fox says have holes birds have nests but
[45:08] the son of man had nowhere
[45:09] to lay his head i'll i'm here to tell
[45:13] you that most of the time
[45:15] the children of god in the early age
[45:17] especially they were considered
[45:19] bums and you know we just don't have in
[45:22] our
[45:23] society not us here people don't have
[45:25] very much highest theme or much thought
[45:27] of a bomb
[45:29] but these were not just normal bums
[45:32] these were
[45:33] people that sold everything and had
[45:35] nothing
[45:36] but they loved the lord and they served
[45:38] god
[45:39] and god always supplied for them jesus
[45:43] he didn't have much
[45:44] he couldn't even pay his taxes until a
[45:46] fish spit out all the money for it
[45:48] and that right he became poor
[45:52] so that you could become rich
[45:56] he was despised and rejected so that you
[45:59] can be
[46:00] accepted how many believe that
[46:04] god became man so that man could become
[46:08] like god
[46:10] so that we could be like jesus he became
[46:13] us
[46:14] he became sin and he became a curse
[46:17] preaching on a curse remember he says
[46:19] cursed it
[46:21] is everyone that hangeth on the tree and
[46:22] jesus hung on a tree
[46:24] became a curse so that we could become
[46:26] blessed
[46:30] i've often heard say don't never be big
[46:34] in your own side amen if you're big let
[46:38] it be in the sight of god
[46:40] but belittle in your own sight and every
[46:42] man that humbles himself
[46:44] god will exalt but those who exalts
[46:46] himself
[46:47] god will bring a base see
[46:51] be little
[46:54] be little
[46:58] amen
[47:05] listen friends the more simpler that you
[47:08] can be
[47:09] the more god can deal with you amen
[47:13] you've got to forget all you ever knowed
[47:16] in your own knowledge to know christ
[47:19] you just become childlike and accept him
[47:21] that's all
[47:22] that's the way you accept god and the
[47:25] more simple you can be
[47:26] the more humble the more you can get
[47:28] away from yourself and your own ideas
[47:30] just take god's word for it amen
[47:34] and believe it for it's by faith that
[47:36] you believe
[47:38] amen
[47:44] jesus talked with simple language with
[47:46] the simple people
[47:49] and was written likewise and they're
[47:52] trying
[47:54] and they're trying to but those great
[47:56] big swelling outstanding
[47:58] hold on for dear life as i would call it
[48:00] words in it
[48:01] and they miss it so it was wrote simple
[48:04] correct
[48:05] so simple as it was to bring the gospel
[48:08] to the poor
[48:09] and the needy amen that's what makes him
[48:11] great to me
[48:13] but a guy that sticks his chest out and
[48:15] thinks he's somebody that shows how
[48:16] little he is to me
[48:18] that's right the more simple you can get
[48:21] the higher god can raise you so just be
[48:24] simple
[48:26] brother bam says that's why when africa
[48:27] and india and so forth god did so much
[48:30] more
[48:30] because here in america people are so
[48:33] educated until they're educated away
[48:35] from god
[48:36] they think they know more about it than
[48:38] god does god bless you let's stand
[48:40] tonight
[48:42] musicians if you'll come
[48:50] i think the second chapter of first
[48:52] corinthians paul talks about how that
[48:58] no man knoweth the things of man save
[49:01] the spirit of man that is in him
[49:03] and neither knoweth man the things of
[49:07] god except the whole by the holy spirit
[49:10] that's in him
[49:11] and then he goes to talking about who
[49:12] has been god's instructor who's known
[49:15] the mind of christ
[49:16] instruct him and he sums it up with this
[49:20] he says you know here's this but we have
[49:24] the mind of christ
[49:28] another place it says let this mind be
[49:30] in you that was
[49:31] also in christ jesus amen how many
[49:34] believes where they have the mind of god
[49:37] not only the mind of god but we're
[49:38] honored and privileged to be able to
[49:40] like jesus said in saint john 14
[49:42] the works that i do shall you do also
[49:45] and greater works than these shall you
[49:47] do because i go unto the father
[49:49] now it isn't that god is so far away
[49:52] anymore but god has become down and come
[49:54] become part of us so that we could have
[49:56] his mind have his works
[49:58] amen and be pleasing to the lord god
[50:01] bless you let's bow our heads
[50:07] search your heart tonight ask yourself
[50:10] if truly you can say
[50:13] yes i try to live every day
[50:16] thinking only what christ would think
[50:20] try to have his thoughts try to do his
[50:23] works
[50:25] i wonder how many tonight would say i
[50:26] need more of that brother but
[50:28] i need more of the thoughts of god in my
[50:30] life
[50:31] every day just to be thinking like him
[50:35] whatever situation arises then we can
[50:37] truly say like that little phrase goes
[50:40] what would jesus do what would jesus
[50:43] think
[50:43] how would jesus react
[50:47] amen what would jesus work
[50:50] because that's what i want the works
[50:53] that i do share you also
[50:55] god bless those hands a hungry heart
[50:58] to be more like jesus lord our hands are
[51:01] up saying father help us to have your
[51:03] thoughts to think your thoughts
[51:05] take our old thoughts away lord jesus
[51:07] don't never let us
[51:08] think from our carnal mind because paul
[51:11] has taught us that the carnal mind is
[51:13] enmity
[51:14] against god it's not subject to god
[51:16] neither indeed can be
[51:18] we have to take on your mind lord and
[51:20] that's what
[51:21] we desire tonight lord so that tomorrow
[51:24] we go to jobs when we go do whatever
[51:26] we're going to do
[51:27] we do it in the name of jesus christ
[51:30] under the power of the holy spirit
[51:32] living his life
[51:34] i ask god tonight that you draw each one
[51:36] father both those
[51:38] those that are here and those that
[51:39] couldn't be here lord
[51:41] father that you would draw them all
[51:42] closer to you lord and help each one of
[51:44] us to realize
[51:46] that you're coming for a wife to live
[51:48] with you in your palace for a thousand
[51:50] years and we need to have the same kind
[51:52] of thinking that you thought lord
[51:56] to believe your word and man
[52:00] shall not live by bread alone but by
[52:03] every word that proceedeth out of the
[52:05] mouth of god shall man live by
[52:07] lord help us to live that way help us to
[52:09] live your life
[52:10] and lord take the throne of our heart
[52:12] lead and guide us now
[52:13] in jesus name amen and amen
