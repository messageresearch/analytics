we'll see how this goes I don't know if there was a motive there or not but we'll just see how it goes amen it's good to be a Christian it's good to serve the Lord and just just love him can't say enough good things about the Lord that's right amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll turn to Genesis the 2 chapter and we'll read verse 8 just one small simple verse with a lot of meaning Genesis 2 [Music] and8 and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him let's pray dearly father we just thank you for a wonderful Sunday Lord and just the time that we've got to come together and have Fellowship around your word Lord you're always so good to us we pray tonight that you'll just bless what your word Lord and just help each family here and everyone in their challenges and situations in life may you just walk with them in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him a help meet for him you know Adam was surrounded by thousands of animals he was surrounded by beauty that was incomparable but God said it's not good that Adam to be alone he needed someone to share this Earthly Journey with someone he could talk to someone that even God wouldn't fulfill God wouldn't fulfill this role I mean here's God the omnipotent God and he said it's not good for man to be alone and that is what we want to talk about for a few minutes today tonight this evening this afternoon whatever time it is is we're not made to walk alone not made to walk alone god Set an example with the first human being that it was not good to walk alone because I don't know about you but when we get alone it especially if we're discouraged this kind of goes into the same vein uh I was speaking of this morning it's easier the discouragement becomes magnified the the despair becomes magnified the hopelessness becomes magnified now we don't need someone to walk with us that sympathizes with us to always but we need someone that will help us see things sometimes for how they really are and not how we've conceived them to be and and so God knew that Adam needed another human being that even he wasn't going to fulfill that that purpose that he needed another human being that would encourage him that would walk with him that would understand him another human being and the right relationships in our life our our family our church family uh the different ones the right Godly relationships is a gift from God it's a gift from God and we don't want to minimize that we don't want to think that we we you know this world teaches this kind of mentality especially young people listen to this they teach this world like I can do it on my own I don't need no help I'll just Google it YouTube it tick tock It Whatever more I can figure out everything but that is not how God wanted it to be he did never intended man woman to walk alone and that is why church is so important uh the local church is vital it's important to our walk and our walk with God and walk with each other yeah the easy thing in life is just to walk alone because well if they're not going to agree with me then I'll just do it myself yeah it's more challenging it's more harder when you get more than two people you got more than two opinions yeah and you have to work on things nobody gets their way 100% where if it's just you so God said it's not good for man to be alone and what he is doing he is sitting he's setting a principle for until eternity you know eternity just won't have one person there there will be many people there will be many of us so God said it's not good for man to walk alone and and he followed this principle through the life of Jesus in Mark the 6th chapter verse 7 this is Jesus calling the 12 and he called into him the 12 and begin to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits why didn't Jesus just say it would be more efficient we could cover more ground if I sent them one by one no he knew that when one got discouraged the other would be there to pick them up yeah he knew when they were sitting in an area area that had a lot of persecution that was very unfly that they could come back to the campfire at night and sit together and begin to encourage each other begin to talk about Jesus who had sent them and knew that they were on a eternal mission whereas if they had been alone they might have got discouraged and quit Jesus said I sent two by two there was no need for Jesus to tell us in the Bible how many how he sent them unless he wanted us to catch something from that he could have just said I sent the disciples out no but he said I sent them two by two you know the brother Brandon shares this little story there once was a little boy who was frightened by thunderstorms and maybe we all know this story but it's a good reminder and his mom comes into the room and it's late at night he's scared and she's holding his hand and and she thinks her little eight year or nine-year-old son is asleep and she begins to walk out of that room and he opens up his eyes wide and says mom where are you going and she's like well son I got to get some sleep you're fine you're safe God is with you and the boy replied I know God is with me but I want god with skin on it and and there's a there's a lesson there we know God is with us there's not a doubt in my mind that God is with us but sometimes because I'm human I want a god with skin on it yeah I a god send people in our life to encourage us yeah to give us strength right he could do it supernaturally but that is not his [Music] way he could have built the ark he didn't need Noah he didn't need Moses he didn't need Joshua he don't need me he don't need you in in in one sort of way we need him that's right but but that's not God's way God is not about the most efficient way the most logical way God sets the principles God sets the pattern and when Jesus walked here on Earth he said I'm not sending them one by one I'm sending them two by two and the only reason why I could think that Jesus would do that is because he knows Humanity gets discouraged he knows that Humanity sometimes fear and he knows that there's a power there's a power here tonight we all come together we all bring our Li of fires we all some of you might be discouraged some of you might be cold but there's enough here that are encouraged there's enough here that is on fire that what it does that atmosphere begins to change those that might not be on fire those that are feeling low those that are discouraged will by the power of a group of people that come to together that God has encouraged their heart they begin to encourage other people's heart amen hallelujah in Ecclesiastes 4:9 the Bible says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor now now listen I I love the Bible verse 10 for if they fall the one will lift up is fell not tear him down when a person falls will not to make it harder for them to stand again that's God's job but the Bible says when they fall the other one will lift him back up but woe the Bible says woe which means a heavy Calamity the word woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he have not yet another to help him up again if two lie together they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken a threefold cord is not quickly broken see there's power in unity there's strength in togetherness uh have you ever felt alone have you ever felt alone but as I said earlier have you ever felt alone and you just needed another human being another Christian another believer to tell you I know what you're going through but it will get better yeah I know exactly where you're at but God who is rich in Mercy you're going to see the sun shine again amen hallelujah prise amen hallelujah Adam had Eve Abraham had Sarah Moses had Aaron notice when God Called Moses he called Aaron too he told Moses Moses said I'm not an eloquent speaker he said I stutter I can't even say things right God said don't you worry your brother Aaron has a part to play and I will use him in this capacity amen see when we bring our gifts together then the body moves forward every one of us have different gifts every one of us have different burdens every one of us have different strengths and we come tonight under a local church and God is magnified because not just one came but two came three came four came and all these gifts all these strengths all these burdens begin to make the army of God and the army of God continues to move forward amen amen Timothy had Paul Paul had Timothy David had Jonathan if you ever want to read a story of someone that brought strength to another person read about Jonathan how much he helped David David couldn't do it alone David sinned when he was alone oh that's a different avenue the serpent got Eve when she was alone yeah see there's power and unity you know I be there's power and accountability I believe there's power I'm going get ready going on a tangent but I I just don't even think like young people and teenagers should have full control over their phone I don't think so I think they they need accountability because we're human beings my wife has all my passwords she has access to my phone any time she wants not there's a reason there because I'm a human being and there's power and accountability there's power and unity but when you get along is when the devil starts talking to you right most sin happens alone or the birth of sin happens alone amen even when Jesus was alone is when Satan begin to talk to him in the Garden of Gethsemane brother Brenham said that was the hardest time of his whole Ministry he's alone Satan begins to talk to him Jesus even went as far to say god father if you would allow let this cup pass but then he knew that the god in him he be he recognized that that is not my calling amen brothers and sisters we need each other we need each other don't discount the power of godly people in your life amen don't discount the the power of accountability of godly people in our life amen we're not we're not superum beings we're human beings that by the grace of God he lives within us but sometimes this flesh gets sticky and we're living in a very challenging time yeah addiction is on a rampage pornography is on a rampage all these other addictions that wasn't such a strong C 20 years ago are riid in the church and everybody's coming with a smile everybody looks good but the problem is when they're alone with their phone amen amen we we we need people that we can be honest with we can be straight up we need people in our life everybody does ministers included they say I failed I did wrong WR but by God's grace he has sent me here to hold me accountable amen that's where we're living brothers and sisters that that's the world we live in we're all facing it amen you know the Bible says iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend now I don't know much about sharpening iron but I would say that it deals with tension FR friction that it that it's not easy so when you rub two sharp blades together they make each other sharper yeah amen when you bring two people together that really want to serve the Lord they begin to sharpen each other they begin to bring strength to each other believer walking with believer yeah there's a strength there think about this Jesus even Jesus didn't try to do it all himself he sent disciples he he said disciples two by two as we said earlier God didn't call one man to do everything or one woman he didn't do that he called that there's a body there's a mystical Body of Christ and some's here in Elon some's there in Murphysboro sons in Africa Hawaii wherever it may be there's a mystical Body of Christ amen and together we strengthen each other amen amen amen he you know Jesus think of all think of the disciples he called different personalities different backgrounds you had Max I almost said max you had ma Matthew the tax collector Peter was a little gun hole I mean Peter was ready to whip anybody that looked at Jesus wrong yeah I mean Jesus probably had to keep a close eye on Peter because Peter's probably about to mess up something he's always he he was just a courageous person yeah God called all these different personalties and said 12 of you you're going to work together yeah Matthew probably looked at Peter Matthew probably was a very logical person he was probably very anal with the numbers he was a tax collector and he probably looked at Peter and thought how in the world will I work with someone as wild as Peter and Peter probably looked at Matthew and thought how am I going to work with someone as closed-minded as Matthew but see Jesus's economy is so different so when you look at your brothers and sisters said they're just so different than me that's okay that is okay yeah God didn't call us to be Little Ant little robots yeah he has a Min member body but we can gain strength from each other because we were not made to walk alone amen you know Paul's in prison I want to read these scriptures acts 27 And1 through3 Paul's in prison he's on a ship he's going to Italy with other prisoners they're all prisoners and they're selling to Italy verse one of the 27th chapter of Acts and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy they delivered Paul certain other prisoners prisoners unto one named Julius a satarian of Augustus band and entering into the ship of whatever that word is we launched meaning to sell by the coast of Asia one and all these different cities being with us or different people and the next day we touched at sidon and jul Julius courtly intreated Paul and gave him Liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself so here's Paul he's a prisoner and he he he arrives to sodon the city and and Julius gives him the opportunity to go to his friends the Bible says to refresh himself refresh himself I just like to believe that it wasn't so much Paul needed a shower probably most his life he needed a shower showers W the main priority back then uh I think the refreshing would have been encouragement all right strength yeah think of that nothing in this Bible was put in there unintentionally there's a reason for everything Julius courtly verse three entreated Paul and gave him Liberty to go into his friends to refresh himself Paul's a prisoner and he goes to the city of sodon and Julius was so kind he let Paul go to his friends to get encouragement to get refreshing amen strength as a prisoner he's a prisoner there there's there's a lesson here sometimes circumstances won't change Paul was still a prisoner when he left his friends he was still in shackles he still had to was getting ready to go for for the court yeah it didn't change his journey everything about Paul was still the same except he was now refreshed praise the Lord so we're not talking about your situation always changing you're there's always going to be things in our life that is hard and challenging those things might not change you're going to have the same problems probably you walked into this church they'll still be there tomorrow morning but what is different is if you look at this as encouragement that God said I will never leave you or forsake you you that God has placed people in my life to encourage me to strengthen me Paul was refreshed yes nothing was said about his circumstance changing we always want our circumstance to change but sometimes it's not going to change but what can change is how we look at it how we see it and God can place people in our life that may be been on that same Journey and they can refresh you they can encourage you they can let you know that yeah the situation is bad and it's challenging but God is going to watch over you God is going to keep you the outcome might not be what you want but you still can be refreshed in the middle of a storm thank you Lord we have to get used if we think life is going to be Utopia here perfect we're lying to ourselves that's right because once you get done with one problem there's going to be another problem probably yeah there's going to be another situation there's going to be another challenge we're not getting rid of that until we get to heaven but what we can do is be refreshed right what we can do is come to church and be refreshed call and text and visit people and be refreshed have friendships in our life that refreshes us but what we don't want to do is isolate ourselves because remember those that isolate themselves will fall de deeper and deeper and deeper into despair amen so when he arrived Paul found refreshing we need godly people in our life not perfect people not people that agree with us on everything we live in such a polarized country with the only way people get along as if they agree it was never meant to be that way I mean brother br taught the principle that you should be able to hug someone's neck if you bitterly disagree right you should still love them and we don't want to bind to that secular view view we need to realize there's a secular View and there's a Godly view yeah a secular view tells you if someone does you wrong you do them wrong a Godly view tells us to turn another cheek a secular view says it's all about me a Godly view says no it's not all about me I'm here to refresh people amen man amen we need people in our life that are Godly Believers that want to see us grow in Christ the type that will call us if we don't show up at church two or three times a month that really have a concern about us amen that want to see us grow that want to see us raptured out of here that want to see us in heaven Amen brother Brandon once said this was in 1965 if that that means anything but he once said if I had a trustee on the board that had a different idea and wouldn't stand up and would Express his own views of it I throw him off the board though as contrary to my belief I want to express him to express what he thinks yeah amen don't you want an environment in your life like that where there's this freedom to be who God called us to be amen a lot of times we only want people in our life that make us feel comfortable right that are 100% agree I like people that make me feel comfortable I love people that are like little me m don't you you say the sky's green they say the sky's green if they say they if you say you love M&Ms they love M&M's which I do yeah I like people that are 100% agree with me but that isn't what I need and that's not what you need we don't need puppets in our life we need people that shoot straight with us yeah that's what helps us grow it hurts but that's what helps us grow in a loving way in a kind way that really have a motive really want to see us grow not a motive of tearing us down or hurting us but a really motive young people that's you probably won't find many people that have that motive other than your parents and you'll find people but parent to me parents usually have that motive it it's it's purely that you want to see your kids on the right track there's no other motive there's no money to gain there's no friendship there's nothing other than unconditional love that you just want to see them do good and that you see them serve the Lord so usually parents are going to shoot straight with you but that's not a bad thing because they want to see you grow in Christ amen I don't know of any other relationship that's like that uh that can be as pure as a relationship with a a parent and a child but see we want people in our life that just make us feel comfortable but God gives us friends God gives us a church family God gives us family that just doesn't always make us feel comfortable right for it's not good for man to be alone and though it's probably times where Adam didn't have a lot of confidence in that scripture but God knew what Adam needed more than what Adam knew he needed and sometimes we might not feel able with the people that were around but if they have our best interest in mind then they're sent from God if they want to see us grow in Christ and grow in God and be what God has called us to be they're a blessing to our life amen thank you Lord that's good but for relationships to have a foundation or to be effective in our life they're based on one thing and that's respect for relationships if we're not made to walk alone and there's going to be people in our life of all different types even in this church there's such a variety of personalities just by the Numbers alone there are some of you that are maybe quiet introverted there's some that are extroverted that are more like to be where of the party's at there there are some that a good night for them is just to be at home there's others that um would rather just be at Walmart 24/7 just to be around people I mean they're just people people but so there's such a variety even here and if we don't watch it we get so we magnify that P the personality and don't realize that God can use all these different people to help us grow Amen in 1860 Lincoln was elected president and he did something that no other president had really ever done and not many presidents have done since the 13 men that he choose to be on his cabinet most of them were his enemies he now think of this this is one of the greatest president of all time and he chose third men to be on his cabinet and most of the men bitterly disagreed with him but he thought that was best cuz he thought that's how good ideas are birth where people come together to have different opinions and just just hash it out and one of his biggest enemies was a man by the name of Mr Seward and he was his biggest rival and Lincoln asked him to be on the board he actually had ran against Lincoln as president there had been so much mud slinging in the election this man had said all kinds of bad things about Lincoln and now Lincoln had asked him to be on his board his cabinet and he he accepted but when it's all said and done this is what Mr Seward wrote to his wife about Lincoln the president is the best of us it's a wonderful Arc of the story that Lincoln has became my friend his bitterly enemy became one of his good friends that now this is the thing they were still not always in agreement they didn't still didn't see a lot of things eye to eye but they learned to respect each other yeah and that is what we're missing a lot in society churches schools whatever you call we miss that level of respect for each other I've always liked this I might even said it here years ago but brother Brenham said this and I always thought this was so good he said the medical doctor condemns the chiropractor the chiropractor condemns the medical doctor the osteopath which I think is a natural doctor condemns them both and all of them cond condemn Divine Healing now he says the osteopath does a lot of good things the caropractor does a lot of good things the medicine does a lot of good things and then he goes on uh he says the surgery also does a lot of good things even the medical doctor sometimes condemns a surgeon the surgeon condemns a medical doctor he says we need he's talking about doctors we need you and we need one another now think of this brother Brenham has a Ministry of Divine Healing especially in this decade in the 50s when he said this and a lot of his other ministers like AA Allen a lot of them was hammering hard against doctors you don't need them and brother Brenham took a total different view of it he said no we need each other everybody brings something to the table he said we need he then he says this it looks to me like that anyone that would condemn anything that is helping someone it's a selfish motive there's something wrong with that person that would condemn someone that's trying to do something good he said if we all would just forget that the osteopath the car PR the medical doctor the surgeons he even said if the ministers would forget it and we all work together to try to help our fellow man to make life a little better to for them to make their Journey a little little more pleasant what a different way of looking at things so what it tells me we need to try to help everybody at work we need to try to help people we come in contact we we don't want to come so spiritual that we can't be any human good that's right we're still human beings and I like how he said this because they's such a great principle you know my my dad unfortunately he's been going through kidney stones and keep them in your prayers Thursday if it doesn't pass he'll be get having surgery I thank God for good doctors Because unless God decides otherwise they will be taken out that kidney stone and we would just pray God will lead the hands of that daughter I don't care how God does it I just want to see him do it see see see man was it's not good for man to walk alone amen respect is the key though we need people to speak into our life you know sometimes you might tell your kid or your teenager you might tell them something and they they might disagree with you but you give them a little time you know they're thinking about it and then they come back a couple days and they tell you they had this great idea and you're like that was my idea how did it turn into being your great idea I mean I still want to get some credit for it they're like Dad man I guess this good idea it's like that's the idea I gave you but we don't say that as parents we just let it go and they came out with another great idea that they plagiarized from us um anyway I better get off that subject I still I got some kids here but so you know we we we need each other to speak in each other's life but in order to have a relationship that God can use it takes respect now let's look what the Bible says Galatians 2:1 I won't keep you much longer th this is what Paul says he confronts Peter he says in verse Galatians 2:11 he says but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the the face because he was to BL blame Paul called out Peter he said I stood up in Peter's face because he was to blame now what what was he why did Paul think Peter does something so bad well verse 12 tells us why for before that certain came from James he's talking about Peter he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision basically Peter was afraid of what people would think and the Bible says in verse 11 Paul said I stood up in his face and I told him Peter you are to blame now Peter is saved Paul is saved but they're having this bitter disagreement so so the issue is p Peter like Paul had here's was the fundamental issue Peter like Paul they came from a Jewish tradition and Paul had Stripped Away all that traditional Judaism but Peter was having a very difficult time with it he was hanging on to a lot of his Jewish Traditions while still being a follower of Christ he just couldn't help it it was still being kind of taken out of him he was still trying to grow but who was helping him grow Paul yeah God didn't supernaturally come down and say Peter I'm going to take it all out of you no God sent Paul to get up in Peter's face and said Peter you got to quit acting like a hypocrite who cares what the Jews think we're not Jewish anymore we're not Pentecostal anymore we're not whatever our tradition is anymore that's the thing of the past we're Believers we're Believers and that means we're not going to do what our traditions we sometimes need a PA to get in our face yeah and say quit being hypocrite quit hold on to the traditions and follow the lord Jesus Christ yeah amen where is Paul amen now I'm not sure why well I know why but I think I know why Peter did not want to eat with the Gentiles in front of the associations of James who were circumcised he was having a hard time letting go of all those Jewish Traditions Paul told him he's wrong they're both Servants of God he didn't send Peter to hell he just told him what he's doing wrong that's right cuz he wanted Peter to get better that's it wasn't a bad motive but he really wanted to see Peter be who Peter should be yeah amen and not everybody has a bad motive that corrects us sometimes they some people really want to see us be better amen want us grow us closer to God and you you know what you know how it works though someone might correct us but eight months later we might have to correct them yeah cuz none of us are 100% perfect some of us just in different seasons that's right that's good so Paul told me is wrong but I want you to catch this how Peter viewed Paul turn with me to Second Peter the thir chapter verse 14 now this is very important because all that there must have been some between Peter and Paul but this is what Peter said about Paul who had corrected him he said now Peter's talking he said wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and verse 15 and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also Accord according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you he called Paul not only brother but beloved brother Paul and he ALS said also said Paul was a very wise man now wonder if you turn to Second Peter and Peter was telling off Paul wonder if second Peter was all about all the trash in Paul's life but that's not how it was they were brothers man's not good it's not good for man to walk alone they were there to help each other and Peter must have came to realization that Paul really did help him maybe part of it was Peter's personality he just had a real struggle of letting go of some of this Jewish tradition that he was still holding on I don't know the reason maybe Paul was just was able to burn the bridges a lot easier but what I do know is God used Paul to get into Peter's face and say you need to quit acting like you're Jewish cuz you're not Jewish amen and then Peter was able to grow was able to grow let me read you something brother Brandon said about Nixon he said Mr Nixon made the brightest remark this is when Nixon was President I've heard any president or a vice president making the last few years when he said the other day what's the matter with American people they've lost their love and respect for one another I think that's a bright statement I don't think we need to fight dirty I mean you see all this junk on the [Music] news remember remember this news is a business and the only way news makes money is eyeballs because news get paid by advertisement so they've always got to keep something going I don't care if it's Fox News CNN they always always got to keep something going because that is the only way they make money they're they're a profit organization they don't have your best interest in mind these people make millions and millions of dollars they're not out to help the little none of them are they're Catalyst I'm not saying all of them as bad I I like some of these commentators but I always keep in my mind can they just tell me the story without their opinion just give me the flat news and let me come up with my own opinion I don't need to tell me what I should think that's my soap box for tonight right so we had to have this respect give me about maybe five or 10 more minutes brother Brenham said about Oral Roberts he said oral is my brother I love him he's a real fellow a real guy and I love him he just thinks the world of me and I do to him he said the pro he said the only thing is we just don't agree on scripture well I thought we had to agree on scripture to get along no that is all man-made so brother brand said we love each other we're brothers we just don't agree on scripture there's so much to learn here just in our daily life brother Brenham said before he died less than a month I respect any man's message that he's given about God whatever it is I respect that with all my heart he didn't say it had to be a certain level he just said if they're giving a message about God see see respect opens the door for people to help us that's right yeah that's right but as long as we can't respect people unless they see it our eye our way then there's no room for growth that's right because all we're doing is going in circles because we're just we're just hanging around people that are yes people we're just hanging around people that doesn't challenge us in our Christian walk they just do everything we do they're little puppets but we don't need that in our life brother Bram had a lot of people in his life that disagreed with him and he was okay with that and we should be okay with that because that is what helps people grow oh God help us to realize the gift of other people in our life let's say you're listening to a minister I won't say tonight let's just say you're listening to a minister and he says something he's speaking to your heart and then all of a sudden he says something you disagree with you put on the brakes do you shut down I mean you've been enjoyed it you've been amen amen amen amen and then he said that one sentence and you're like no more amens it's over do you ignore the rest of it or do you do like Mary the Bible says Mary pondered it in her heart do you say maybe I don't understand quite what was just said I don't even know if I agree with it but God I'm going to write it down and you just deal with my heart that's I'm gonna go home and get out the Bible and different things and I'm just going to ask God you show me see when we close the door to our heart then we close the door for people to help us if we just shut the brakes because it goes against something we bleed for 40 years that's not good enough we never grow I don't care if you've been around 92 years there's still room to grow in God's economy and God's kingdom cuz God is the almighty teacher we will never know God fully on this Earth that's right amen but the Bible says Mary pondered that in her heart she that didn't mean she understood that didn't even mean she liked what was going on in her body and the different changes but all she knew to do was be humble and Ponder sometimes God's talking to us because he wants us to change and the way he often we often change is through other people yeah God help me to be that way this can app this don't even have to apply Church it can apply to our spouse friends Brothers and Sisters in Christ believers do we shut down when people just say something that that totally we disagree with or do we say you know I disagree with you but I want to pray and think about it maybe I'm wrong yeah we can be wrong I know that's a revelation I know that blows us our almost blows our brain to Pieces but we can't be wrong amen so God I you know I want by God's help and Grace I pray that he helps me to be humble helps us all to be humble that when our thoughts our Traditions are challenged we say Lord here am I here am I open my heart maybe I've missed something but open my heart because you said it's not good for man to be alone maybe this man this woman or whomever it may be it could be a kid maybe they're teaching me something I need to learn I had a Godly friend as we stand I had a Godly friend named brother Stewart he's from Georgia he was from Georgia uh just saw his daughter and his his wife his uh a couple weeks ago brother Stewart was a godly man and he passed away in 2012 some of you might have known him uh and a few months ago we had dinner with his son-in-law and his daughter and had a wonderful time and we were just talking about brother Stewart in his early years he had had a very rough life he had walked out on his family I think we did a testimony in Eagles view about it many years ago he had walked out on his family he had some other issues going on in his life but then one day God got a hold of his heart and he changed he did like a 180 and he changed and then it came a priority in his life to tell everybody about the goodness of God if you worked with him you knew that he was a Christian if you worked with him you knew you saw the transformation his life and so in 2012 he passed away from cancer I had talked to him a few months prior and he was still in such a good mood he was uh still just believing God was going to heal him and uh but I was reading through his obituary in the comments and this is what one man wrote let me say this when at his funeral there was a wide array of people there there was believers there was unbelievers there was a there was just such a wide array of people there wasn't just all churchgoers but he had affected so many people's life in his community that he had grown up at he had been a star football player in high school and then then he got his life together in his mid late 20s but this man wrote this about Steward he said we both Eddie and myself worked with Stuart but I worked side by side with Stuart me many years closely it's because of him and the word of God that brought me to Calvary and I wanted you and his friends to know he lived the word of God and was a True Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ yeah see it's one thing for everybody in church to say that but it's another thing when the people that you work qu say that right or you go to school with yeah it's a different ball game that's right and he had affected this man's life to such a point that he gave his life to God now steuart didn't never worry about whether they became a message believer or anything like that all he was just worried about is they got to Calvary and let God do the rest and and and Stuart touched so many lies because he was just always there to help another human being amen God said when Adam walked on Earth the first human being it's not good for man to walk alone in a perfect place called Eden where everything looked great it was beautiful God sets forth in motion a principle if it wasn't good for man to walk alone in the Garden of Eden when everything was perfect what do you think about today when temptation is everywhere we don't even have to go out of this church for Temptation we all bring it in with our little phones temptation is everywhere trials and tribulations challenges and and and polarization and all these things especially young people are dealing with but my prayer is that we have people in our life that when we're down they pick us up when when we don't feel like going on they carry us for a little bit amen when when we feel that the whole world is on us they carry part of that world yeah may God just bless us with people in our life that's right may God bless this church tonight that we you all as a local body be that to each other be that to each other and that brings a strong church when there's that kind of unity may God just help us all do you love them let's pray dearly father we just thank you for this beautiful Sunday Lord this time of Fellowship it's been a few years and it's just been wonderful I pray that you'll be with each one here be with brother brother Bor and sister Bor and the church here may you just continue being with them and guiding them and leading them Lord give them strength help every situation here Lord if anyone tonight Lord feels alone may you open their eyes that there's many around them that are there for them Lord we wouldn't want anybody to leave to felt like they were having to carry this whole burden themselves you started out in the Book of Genesis with it's not good for man to walk alone when Jesus came to Earth he didn't do it himself he sent disciples two by two when Peter and Paul had a bitter disagreement Peter Still realized I need Paul so Lord may we recognize we need each other yes we just thank you for a beautiful Sunday we love you amen amen let's try that course what a friend we have in Jesus
