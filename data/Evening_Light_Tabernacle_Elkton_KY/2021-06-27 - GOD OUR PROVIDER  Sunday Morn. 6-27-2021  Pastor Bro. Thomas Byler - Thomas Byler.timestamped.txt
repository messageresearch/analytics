[28:39] it sure is a privilege to be in the

[30:54] amen we'll just go in the psalms
[30:59] and then sunday schools the children can
[31:01] be dismissed for sunday school
[31:04] and we'll go to psalms 91.
[31:18] psalms 91 he that dwelleth
[31:22] i can wait just a little bit here he
[31:25] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[31:27] most high shall abide under the shadow
[31:29] of the almighty
[31:38] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[31:40] snare of the fowler
[31:41] and from the noisome of pestilence
[31:52] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[31:54] by night
[31:55] nor for the arrow that flies by day
[32:06] thousands shall fall out thy side and
[32:08] ten thousand at thy right side
[32:10] but it shall not come nigh thee
[32:18] because thou hast made the lord which is
[32:20] my refuge even the most high
[32:23] thy habitation
[32:31] for he shall give his angels charge over
[32:33] thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[32:42] i shall tread upon the lion and add her
[32:44] the young lion
[32:45] and the dragon shalt thou trample under

[33:00] him i will be with him in trouble

[33:05] long life
[33:06] will i satisfy him and show him my
[33:08] salvation
[33:10] god bless you maybe seated brother brian
[33:11] for adult sunday school
[33:24] morning brothers and sisters you know
[33:27] after a chapter like that
[33:29] what are your worries well
[33:32] there's really nothing for you to now
[33:34] don't get me wrong
[33:36] you know the life can be
[33:39] difficult but after reading a chapter
[33:42] like that and if your confidence is in
[33:44] the word of god
[33:45] and in that relationship you have in it
[33:47] then what are your worries this morning
[33:50] and it's going to be your enemy's goal
[33:53] to get your mind clouded and your eyes
[33:56] clouded
[33:57] worrying about things that you have no
[34:00] control over
[34:02] that you should be releasing to the lord
[34:04] and not worrying about that's his sole
[34:06] purpose is to just
[34:07] ruin your life to get you worrying
[34:10] running after things that really don't
[34:11] matter in the end
[34:13] if you were talking with me to the 15th
[34:17] chapter of the gospel of john
[34:27] i was trying to use some technology this
[34:29] morning and it didn't work out for me so
[34:32] i'll have to do this for memory this
[34:34] morning
[34:37] i was uh researching certain things
[34:40] but i i was thinking this morning where
[34:43] we're sitting at if you look over on
[34:45] this picture right here and i have a
[34:46] loud
[34:52] notice that there's no light there it's
[34:55] all
[34:56] it's all darkness but when you look at
[34:58] that you got to look at it from a
[35:00] different perspective
[35:02] and i and i was listening to and reading
[35:04] things
[35:06] that brother branham had to say and the
[35:07] most important thing
[35:09] like brother joe was praying the light
[35:11] of the world for this age that we live
[35:13] in is you
[35:13] this morning the light that they're
[35:15] going to see is going to be reflected
[35:17] from your life that's hid in jesus
[35:20] christ
[35:20] and that's why you brother thomas has
[35:23] been talking about
[35:24] every other minister that you deal with
[35:26] should be talking about the fact
[35:28] that you should be reflecting jesus
[35:31] christ in everything
[35:32] that you do and say because you're gonna
[35:35] you're the life for the age that we live
[35:37] in right now that's what they're seeing
[35:39] i mean you can't hide who you are from
[35:41] them
[35:42] they're gonna know who you are and what
[35:44] you are you can't you can't hide that
[35:46] but i i i wrote that down this morning
[35:49] and i was thinking you know i was
[35:53] just in perspective i was pulling i was
[35:56] trying to print some stuff that
[35:58] i was reading but brother branham always
[36:00] said that
[36:01] in this age that we live in there's no
[36:03] hope
[36:04] and brother thomas has been talking if
[36:07] you look at the outside world
[36:09] it's a pretty miserable place there's no
[36:11] light out there
[36:12] the things that are going on out there
[36:14] that are totally contrary to the word of
[36:17] god
[36:18] now can you convince people what they're
[36:20] doing is contrary to the word of god
[36:22] no you just got to show them but there's
[36:24] a way to live a life
[36:26] that's totally sure before the living
[36:29] god you just got to be
[36:30] who god made you to be and and i was
[36:34] thinking this morning
[36:35] everyone here that's sitting here
[36:38] listening or from the beginning to the
[36:40] end
[36:41] everyone here has to come the same way
[36:45] and i was just like everyone will have a
[36:47] relationship with jesus christ
[36:49] everyone will have his own personal
[36:51] experience with the lord and it's
[36:54] what you're going to hit your like
[36:57] brother branham
[36:58] always talked about is what you're going
[36:59] to hit your horse do it's what you're
[37:01] going to hit your heart
[37:02] and your soul to that experience you
[37:04] have with the word of god where god you
[37:06] know
[37:07] that god come into your life and god has
[37:09] talked to you
[37:10] he's spoken through his word back to you
[37:13] i always try to
[37:14] say that it's not what i think it's not
[37:17] what someone else thinks it's what god's
[37:19] word thinks in any given situation
[37:22] uh i you know no one has any any a
[37:25] personal opinion in it
[37:27] this morning and we all have that
[37:29] experience this morning that we have to
[37:31] hit yourselves too
[37:34] am i hitching into an emotion or no i'm
[37:36] hissing it to what god
[37:38] has done for me in my life and where i
[37:40] have come from and everyone here sitting
[37:43] this morning is in the same boat you all
[37:45] came from one place and are moving to
[37:47] another place
[37:48] and you all had that experience in your
[37:50] life i hope
[37:52] where god has spoken to you through his
[37:54] word and you know that you're a child of
[37:56] god
[37:56] uh you can't manufacture that you can't
[37:59] make that
[38:00] that's something that god's got to do
[38:02] for you and you gotta just release it to
[38:04] him
[38:05] you know like i was saying uh there's a
[38:08] there's a book that sits on my desk at
[38:10] home i read it all the time you all know
[38:12] i'm what i'm about to say some of you
[38:14] because you've heard me so long i i read
[38:17] that pilgrim's progress boo
[38:19] book time and time again i i just liked
[38:22] that book i've always
[38:23] read that book for the last 40 years i
[38:25] keep reading that book
[38:26] during the 40 years and there's some
[38:29] real
[38:29] truth in that book real life experience
[38:32] and the age we're in
[38:33] right now is like when christian
[38:37] had just come out of vanity fair and
[38:39] he's
[38:40] and hopeful joins him and then they get
[38:42] off the path and the giant
[38:44] captures them and that's the age we're
[38:46] in right now you've got to
[38:48] stay on that path you got to stay on
[38:50] that trail
[38:51] you can't you have to walk the walk that
[38:54] god
[38:55] shows you and everyone is that giant of
[38:58] despair is out there on that world
[39:00] this morning we're all going to fight
[39:01] that giant of despair
[39:03] there's always going to be something
[39:04] trying to come into your life to get you
[39:06] to run after something
[39:08] that has no meaning and that's the
[39:10] purpose of your enemy this morning
[39:12] is to get you on a track that runs you
[39:16] after something that in the end won't
[39:17] profit at you
[39:19] won't do anything for you the only thing
[39:21] that matters the only thing that counts
[39:24] is your relationship with jesus christ
[39:26] and anything that's clouding that up
[39:27] this morning
[39:29] it shouldn't be there and uh i'll just
[39:32] read and you all know that i read you
[39:34] can tell that i read these chapters and
[39:36] john a lot because this page is out of
[39:38] my bible already
[39:39] and it's not that old but i really
[39:42] believe this you're a vine you're going
[39:44] to represent
[39:45] something this morning you're either a
[39:47] good vine or a bad vine this morning
[39:49] you're representing the truth or the
[39:51] hour that we live in or you're
[39:53] representing something else but i'll
[39:55] just read a few of these scriptures here
[39:57] this morning
[39:58] i am the true vine and my father is the
[40:00] husband men
[40:02] every branch in me that birth not fruit
[40:04] he takes away every branch that bear
[40:06] with
[40:07] branch that bear fruit he purges it that
[40:10] it may bring
[40:11] forth more fruit and that's everyone
[40:13] knows in their life like i said i say
[40:15] this a lot but i can only speak for
[40:17] myself
[40:18] as a man you know whether god's pruning
[40:21] you and you know
[40:22] whether you're growing in the faith this
[40:24] morning you know where you came from and
[40:26] where you're headed
[40:27] and you know in your life what god has
[40:29] added to you
[40:30] so you know you can examine where you're
[40:32] at this morning
[40:33] and he goes now you are creating through
[40:36] the word which i have spoken on you
[40:38] inviting me and i in you and as the
[40:41] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[40:43] except it abide in the vine no more
[40:46] no more can you except you abide in me
[40:48] and that's what i'm really saying this
[40:50] morning
[40:50] you have to be abiding in jesus christ
[40:53] this morning
[40:54] anything outside of that it won't mean
[40:56] anything
[40:57] and you'll have a you won't have any
[41:00] victory in your life if you're outside
[41:02] of that
[41:02] it's got to be in christ everything that
[41:05] you do
[41:06] and i am the true vine and you are the
[41:08] branches he that abideth in me
[41:10] and i in him the same bringeth forth
[41:12] much fruit for without me you can do
[41:14] nothing
[41:15] and if a man abide not in me he is cast
[41:19] forth as a branch
[41:20] and is withered and men gather them and
[41:22] cast them into the fire and they are
[41:24] burned
[41:25] but if you abide in me my words abide in
[41:27] you you shall ask but you will and it
[41:29] should be done unto you
[41:30] aaron is my father glorified that you
[41:33] bear much fruit
[41:34] so you shall be my disciples and as the
[41:37] father hath loved me
[41:38] so so so have i loved you continuing my
[41:42] love and i'm gonna
[41:42] jump over here this morning
[41:50] and then i'm going to just jump over in
[41:52] the 16th chapter here
[41:53] and like and some of the stuff and jesus
[41:57] says these things have i spoken on to
[41:59] you
[41:59] that you should not be offended you know
[42:02] everyone was offended in jesus christ
[42:04] because of the things he was saying
[42:06] and i'm thinking this morning you
[42:10] i'm gonna finish with
[42:14] what no matter what you say or what you
[42:17] do you
[42:17] can't make people like you you can't
[42:20] make people
[42:21] trust you they have to see your lives
[42:24] this morning and see that you're really
[42:26] what you say you are
[42:27] and then they'll listen to you you can't
[42:30] make people
[42:31] do the right thing you can't force
[42:33] people to do the right thing it's
[42:34] something
[42:35] that they've got to choose to do and the
[42:37] only way they'll choose to go
[42:39] and walk the right way is that you
[42:41] represent jesus christ
[42:43] one you know a lot of times
[42:46] you you you can pray for it you can
[42:48] believe for it but
[42:49] actually like uh i firmly believe in
[42:52] this age it's totally dark
[42:54] that like i said brother brown always
[42:56] said and and
[42:58] there's a lot of things in the gospel of
[42:59] john that
[43:01] show us that it should be jesus christ
[43:04] living inside that little now but the
[43:05] people believe that jesus christ is
[43:07] living in you
[43:08] most people would say you're a fanatic
[43:09] if you tell them that but it's actually
[43:11] where we're at this morning
[43:13] god is only coming for his own he's not
[43:15] coming for anything else but his own
[43:17] and the only way you'll become one of
[43:19] his
[43:20] is that you totally yield to jesus
[43:23] christ this morning i know i say that a
[43:24] lot
[43:25] you know a man or a woman can never say
[43:28] that too much to people
[43:29] you know it's not me it's not you it's
[43:32] not anything we
[43:33] believe anything that we do or say it's
[43:36] what jesus christ does through us that
[43:38] makes the difference in everything that
[43:40] we are
[43:40] and will be you know when i was a young
[43:43] man
[43:44] it's actually been 40 years it was about
[43:46] this time
[43:47] four years ago you know god was dealing
[43:49] with me
[43:50] you know 40 years i'm almost 62 years
[43:53] old
[43:54] and 40 years goes like it's just
[43:56] yesterday you know what i mean it's
[43:58] 40 it was what 1981 in the late summer
[44:02] early october of this
[44:03] very year that god was dealing you know
[44:05] everyone knows that god deals with you
[44:07] god's been dealing with some people god
[44:09] deals with a lot sometimes it's later in
[44:11] life
[44:12] you know brother branham always said
[44:14] that most of the time god gets hold of
[44:16] that
[44:16] that man or that woman when they're
[44:18] young it doesn't mean that he doesn't
[44:20] get a hold of you when you're a hundred
[44:21] either
[44:22] but you know everyone has that
[44:24] experience where god is going to reach
[44:25] down and touch your life and
[44:27] like i started with a few minutes ago
[44:30] you have to have your anchor your anchor
[44:32] has to be in the word of god
[44:34] and where you know that god is leading
[44:36] you in the right direction
[44:38] and here i am i'm almost 62 years old
[44:41] and it's
[44:42] been a journey for 40 years and i was
[44:45] just thinking this morning
[44:46] does jesus christ in my heart mean to me
[44:50] at almost 62 what it did to me when i
[44:53] was
[44:53] 21 22 years ago oh and i i guess that's
[44:57] where we have to think
[44:59] as you get older does god mean just as
[45:02] much to me this morning
[45:03] as he did to me when i was 21 22 years
[45:07] old and is that experience that i had
[45:10] with him as a 22 year old
[45:12] is that still holding me today and
[45:14] that's how
[45:15] i have to examine myself do i still have
[45:18] that same
[45:19] zeal do i have still have that same
[45:22] presence with me
[45:23] almost 62 that i did when i was 22.

[1:11:50] speaks to jackie with us
[1:11:52] amen so praise the lord i hadn't seen
[1:11:55] him since just now yet this weekend
[1:11:56] today
[1:11:57] so good but amen
[1:12:05] well it's always something good to say
[1:12:07] when you're in church
[1:12:09] i just want to thank the lord for his
[1:12:11] grace and his mercy and
[1:12:14] you know the older i get the more i
[1:12:16] appreciate his word
[1:12:17] and especially this end time message
[1:12:20] that he's revealed to us
[1:12:22] and restore to us done through the edges
[1:12:25] i usually pray lord if i ever turn my
[1:12:27] back on this just take me home
[1:12:29] you know especially when you see so much
[1:12:32] going on these days of
[1:12:34] of people um you know turning back
[1:12:37] after being it for so many years you
[1:12:39] know i just can't comprehend that
[1:12:41] but just talking with my wife and about
[1:12:44] that um
[1:12:45] i just it's something i just can't
[1:12:47] comprehend because where are you gonna
[1:12:48] go if you leave this you know i came out
[1:12:50] of the denominations
[1:12:52] and um there's there's nothing there and
[1:12:55] to go back to that
[1:12:57] i just it's just uncomprehensible
[1:13:00] to me and i just thank the lord for his
[1:13:03] absolute
[1:13:04] truth um in the word and um
[1:13:07] you know sometimes i think a lot of
[1:13:09] times we kind of live
[1:13:10] we come a little bit sheltered when we
[1:13:12] are among believers of like precious
[1:13:14] faith
[1:13:15] but when you go in among you know
[1:13:18] unbelievers like work
[1:13:19] you know um it's a total different
[1:13:23] uh kind of scenario and um sometimes
[1:13:26] you're
[1:13:27] you're called upon to stand for what you
[1:13:29] believe because
[1:13:30] there come a time where everybody will
[1:13:33] have to
[1:13:33] stand you just can't hide among the
[1:13:37] crowd and just
[1:13:38] keep it through they'll start to test
[1:13:41] you in some way
[1:13:42] and um i know at work um there was a
[1:13:46] um this girl she's getting married and i
[1:13:48] thought well that's wonderful
[1:13:50] but then i heard she was getting married
[1:13:51] to another girl
[1:13:53] and it was so it was kind of shocking to
[1:13:55] me because
[1:13:56] um you know it's all coming out in open
[1:13:59] now and bad thing is
[1:14:01] the law is protecting that so sin is
[1:14:04] being protected
[1:14:05] and then at some point you have to take
[1:14:07] a stand regardless of if the government
[1:14:09] or whoever
[1:14:10] you know pass laws it says you need you
[1:14:13] know you should go along with it
[1:14:14] because god's word is what our lives are
[1:14:16] dictated by
[1:14:18] so they they passed along a card you
[1:14:20] know of um you know congratulations you
[1:14:22] know on the
[1:14:23] whole department i don't know it's 30
[1:14:25] something people you know would sign the
[1:14:27] card so he put it on my desk to sign and
[1:14:29] i
[1:14:30] and after knowing um the fact about this
[1:14:33] person getting married to another girl i
[1:14:36] thought i can't sign this and i and i
[1:14:39] told him i said you know
[1:14:40] i can't go along with this i mean
[1:14:42] because it's it's against it all that i
[1:14:44] stand for it's against god's word
[1:14:47] and they had a big party you know and
[1:14:48] they invited me and i couldn't go
[1:14:50] how could i go and celebrate and be
[1:14:53] joyful
[1:14:54] something that's contrary i mean you
[1:14:57] didn't have to have a revelation
[1:14:59] right that's wrong and then and then
[1:15:02] rejoice in that kind of thing
[1:15:04] and um of course when you take a stand
[1:15:06] you're marked
[1:15:07] so so you know but who are you gonna
[1:15:11] you know you're gonna get man's approval
[1:15:13] god's approval you know
[1:15:15] so always take a stand for god's word
[1:15:17] regardless
[1:15:18] of the consequence that the world would
[1:15:21] you know you get shunned
[1:15:23] okay i mean to take a stand for god's
[1:15:25] word
[1:15:26] is not all you know rejoicing and so on
[1:15:28] because you'll be
[1:15:30] shunned you'll be talked about you know
[1:15:32] and so on but in the end what does it
[1:15:34] matter
[1:15:34] you see that's what god um
[1:15:38] dictates and there just a few other day
[1:15:43] this fella right next door um
[1:15:47] he said he changed his name and i
[1:15:49] thought really what did you change
[1:15:52] his name was oliver okay i thought wow
[1:15:54] oh there's a wonderful name
[1:15:55] and he said he changed his name and i
[1:15:57] thought why did you change your name too
[1:15:59] he said i changed my name to phoenix and
[1:16:02] i said
[1:16:03] that he said well oliver was too
[1:16:06] masculine
[1:16:08] and i thought what
[1:16:11] you know if if my parents had named me
[1:16:13] hulk or
[1:16:15] gunther that would have been fine with
[1:16:16] me hey you know i'm a
[1:16:18] man of small stature anything helps you
[1:16:20] know but
[1:16:22] you know they change his name to suit
[1:16:24] his lifestyle
[1:16:25] you see so phoenix means that you know
[1:16:27] we rise from the ashes and so on
[1:16:29] the bird and i thought well you're
[1:16:31] rising from the ashes aren't you i told
[1:16:33] them but um
[1:16:34] brethren you there come a time when you
[1:16:36] have to take a stand
[1:16:38] there'll be a set of circumstances that
[1:16:40] will surround you
[1:16:41] and if you're not grounded in god's word
[1:16:43] and filled with the spirit
[1:16:45] those set of circumstances will just
[1:16:46] suck you right back out into the world
[1:16:49] you have to have a anchor
[1:16:52] that holds you and of course it's not us
[1:16:54] that order ourselves it's the holy
[1:16:56] spirit
[1:16:57] so i'm just so very thankful i'm glad to
[1:17:00] every time come to church and see
[1:17:01] believers and
[1:17:02] fellowship with you and it makes my
[1:17:03] heart glad when i see the church
[1:17:05] you know packed and um a lot of
[1:17:09] people have like precious fate so i'm
[1:17:10] very thankful for that
[1:17:12] and i'm just a word of testimony there's
[1:17:14] always something good to say
[1:17:16] give god glory and he's the one that
[1:17:18] keeps us and
[1:17:20] hopefully like i said older i get i just
[1:17:22] look forward to his coming
[1:17:23] and god
[1:17:26] bless you all it's it's good to be here
[1:17:29] thank you
[1:17:37] thank you better mark amen i think that
[1:17:40] was a sermon in itself don't you think
[1:17:43] amen praise the lord we don't i don't
[1:17:45] think we realize amen but
[1:17:47] you know being on the net and everything
[1:17:49] and people hear what you say and
[1:17:51] amen it's certainly amen uh
[1:17:56] should i say you have to either stand or
[1:17:59] you don't stand and
[1:18:00] you may be a good bit persecuted and i
[1:18:02] don't think that uh
[1:18:03] i don't think we've seen even hardly the
[1:18:05] beginning of persecution
[1:18:07] because you we know we know what is
[1:18:10] going on out there as far as persecuting
[1:18:13] anything that is right is that right
[1:18:16] and it's it's coming you know it's
[1:18:19] coming
[1:18:20] and so but i don't care amen because i
[1:18:23] only care about
[1:18:24] that right and so uh
[1:18:28] we just take a stand for the lord amen
[1:18:30] and when he gets ready to take us out of
[1:18:31] here we leave you amen
[1:18:33] praise the lord cd
[1:18:39] oh all right sound
[1:18:42] all right test that good
[1:18:46] amen um i think that'll be off of the
[1:18:48] music
[1:18:49] thank you i want to give a little report
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:02] on our missionary endeavor
[1:19:05] in uganda probably about a month and a
[1:19:08] half ago
[1:19:09] or so brother jim from vancouver
[1:19:13] texted me and uh
[1:19:18] he wrote me a text and they said i'm
[1:19:20] going to read it to you and then lord
[1:19:22] willing
[1:19:23] if it's okay next weekend we'll take
[1:19:25] another missionary offering
[1:19:27] amen we already have several thousand in
[1:19:29] the missionary offering but
[1:19:30] we want to give everybody a chance to
[1:19:32] give to missions because it's
[1:19:35] the thing that god has told us to do not
[1:19:37] going into all the world
[1:19:38] and it is very very necessary and he
[1:19:42] can't go wrong doing missions amen
[1:19:44] and so we definitely want to do that i
[1:19:47] know
[1:19:47] in the last year so we haven't really
[1:19:49] done as much as what i
[1:19:51] had wanted to because of covet and
[1:19:52] everything and they couldn't build over
[1:19:54] there in uganda for a while because of
[1:19:56] the covet but
[1:19:57] they have taken off and done it and so
[1:20:00] i'm just going to read this to you dear
[1:20:02] brother byler
[1:20:03] greetings in the name of the lord jesus
[1:20:04] christ i just wanted to send you some
[1:20:06] church building pictures

[1:24:18] our supplier amen
[1:24:22] our supplier amen so we'll turn to
[1:24:25] genesis
[1:24:26] go all the way back to genesis amen
[1:24:28] we'll take adam and eve as an
[1:24:30] illustration to begin with
[1:24:33] and see where the lord will take us from
[1:24:34] there genesis 3.
[1:24:53] genesis 3 and verse 22 and the lord god
[1:24:56] said behold the man is become
[1:24:59] as one of us to know good and
[1:25:03] evil and now least he put forth his hand
[1:25:05] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:25:07] eat
[1:25:08] and live forever therefore the lord god
[1:25:12] sent him forth from the garden of eden
[1:25:14] to till the ground
[1:25:15] from whence he was taken so he drove
[1:25:19] out the man and he placed at the east
[1:25:22] of the garden of eden cherubims and a
[1:25:26] flaming sword which turned
[1:25:28] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[1:25:30] life
[1:25:31] amen may god add his blessings to the
[1:25:33] reading of the word you can be seated
[1:25:35] this morning but abandon makes a
[1:25:37] statement about adam and eve and
[1:25:39] especially about adam and talking about
[1:25:40] in the beginning he says
[1:25:42] when he didn't have to shift for himself
[1:25:46] god provided everything that he had
[1:25:49] need of praise be to god think about
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:54] god provided everything that he had
[1:25:58] need of all right but
[1:26:01] after he got reckless and shiftless and
[1:26:03] so forth and done wrong
[1:26:05] and sin separated him from god then he
[1:26:08] had
[1:26:08] to shift for himself
[1:26:14] amen now jesus came to redeem this man
[1:26:17] back
[1:26:17] into the care of the hands
[1:26:20] of the loving father amen
[1:26:24] redemption brought back replaced put in
[1:26:26] position
[1:26:27] listen to this he says when a man will
[1:26:30] walk for god and walk with god
[1:26:33] god will walk with that man but when
[1:26:35] that same individual turns us back from
[1:26:37] god
[1:26:38] then god just lets him shift for himself
[1:26:41] amen
[1:26:41] and we find it is a bad thing that when
[1:26:44] we have
[1:26:45] to ship for ourselves
[1:26:49] faith be to god how many thankful for a
[1:26:51] heavenly father
[1:26:53] that cares about you
[1:26:56] he cares for you and philippians 4
[1:27:00] amen and verse 19 paul said just in
[1:27:03] christ

[1:27:10] covet problem in heaven you ain't got no
[1:27:12] shortage of supplies
[1:27:15] in heaven like we do down here amen
[1:27:18] every one of us is finding that man you
[1:27:20] can't get this and you can't get that
[1:27:22] no you know because his factory was shut
[1:27:25] down this was stuck down
[1:27:26] i'm sure glad it ain't that way with god
[1:27:30] amen he ain't shut down yet now the day
[1:27:33] will come when he's gonna shut down
[1:27:35] isn't that right
[1:27:36] that's right when he comes and leaves
[1:27:38] that mercy seat people will go to
[1:27:40] begging for mercy they'll
[1:27:42] throw themselves at the elders say god
[1:27:44] help me
[1:27:45] but there ain't gonna be no help anymore
[1:27:51] oh aren't you glad that you're not a
[1:27:53] sinner this morning without god having
[1:27:55] to do
[1:27:56] everything yourself
[1:28:02] amen you can't rely upon the
[1:28:05] supernatural to take care of you
[1:28:07] amen and i wanted you to know there's
[1:28:09] people that don't think that god
[1:28:11] amen is intimate about amen taking care
[1:28:14] of people's needs but i want you to know
[1:28:16] he
[1:28:17] is we have a supernatural god that
[1:28:22] provides for us
[1:28:23] he is our provider
[1:28:30] and he's a good one isn't he a good one
[1:28:34] amen go ahead take a deep breath
[1:28:39] he provided you with that right there
[1:28:41] every breath you take has been
[1:28:44] given to you when he decides to take it
[1:28:46] away
[1:28:47] that will be the end of you here
[1:28:50] amen adam eve the most terrible
[1:28:54] terrible thought the most terrible scene
[1:28:56] that you can imagine
[1:28:58] is when he had sinned against god and
[1:29:00] god took a whip
[1:29:02] and said get out of here
[1:29:05] it said he drove him up
[1:29:11] get out of here adam get out of here eve
[1:29:13] the devil use your head
[1:29:15] i use a man's heart you should have
[1:29:18] listened to
[1:29:19] what that heart told you amen
[1:29:23] that heart told you that if they that
[1:29:25] you eat thereof that day you will
[1:29:27] surely die the devil come along he says
[1:29:31] no you're not surely gonna die
[1:29:34] because god doesn't know that you know
[1:29:36] if you eat of this you're going to be
[1:29:38] like
[1:29:38] gods you're going to know both good and
[1:29:41] evil
[1:29:43] huh and it was a tree to be desired
[1:29:47] it was a tree to make one wise she
[1:29:50] lusted after wisdom
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:54] this right here will get you in trouble
[1:29:57] faster than what you can ever imagine
[1:30:01] think about it amen you get this here
[1:30:04] people
[1:30:05] people will put a gun to their brains
[1:30:07] because they're sick of it they can't
[1:30:09] handle it anymore it drove them crazy
[1:30:12] hello that's what this mind will do
[1:30:16] amen but it has to come from down here
[1:30:19] and then we know that god has placed a
[1:30:21] special
[1:30:22] opening they found imminent science they
[1:30:24] found a special
[1:30:25] a compartment in your heart that is not
[1:30:28] in the animal
[1:30:29] kingdom and they say that it's the place
[1:30:31] must be the place
[1:30:32] of the soul
[1:30:35] a special compartment i believe it's the
[1:30:37] control power of man
[1:30:39] amen because you have in there and you
[1:30:41] have that soul
[1:30:42] and it is supposed to be the control
[1:30:44] tower
[1:30:46] of your entire life is right here
[1:30:51] even jesus said you know he says it's
[1:30:53] not what a man eats that defiles him but
[1:30:56] it's what comes out of the mouth
[1:30:58] amen and defiles him because what comes
[1:31:00] out comes from where
[1:31:02] the heart out of the heart are all the
[1:31:06] issues of life
[1:31:07] this is where it all comes from is we're
[1:31:09] down on the inside
[1:31:11] of your inside praise be to god
[1:31:16] oh my we want to talk this morning with
[1:31:19] the help of the lord about being ready
[1:31:21] how many know jesus said be ready for
[1:31:24] you know not the day nor the hour that
[1:31:26] the lord will come
[1:31:28] oh i'm so glad this morning that if
[1:31:30] there's one thing that's sure it's not
[1:31:32] my word it's not a man's word this here
[1:31:35] is the only word that's sure
[1:31:38] amen and if you repeat this then you're
[1:31:41] saying the right words
[1:31:42] amen because jesus said heaven and earth
[1:31:45] will pass away
[1:31:46] but this will never pass away it doesn't
[1:31:48] matter how many
[1:31:49] mockers come in the last days and say
[1:31:52] where is the promise of thy coming for
[1:31:54] since our fathers fell asleep all things
[1:31:56] continue as they were
[1:31:59] huh well let me tell you some things
[1:32:01] ain't continue like they were are they
[1:32:03] they're changing fast but yeah they were
[1:32:06] continuing like it was in the days of
[1:32:08] lot
[1:32:09] like it was in the days of sodom isn't
[1:32:11] that right
[1:32:12] homosexuality it all continues like that
[1:32:15] but oh my think about that was just
[1:32:18] before the fire
[1:32:19] fell christ is coming jesus is coming
[1:32:23] he's going to return
[1:32:28] if you could just genuinely believe that
[1:32:31] with all your heart to know
[1:32:33] without a shadow of doubt that jesus is
[1:32:36] coming back
[1:32:38] he's coming back folks
[1:32:42] and when he does he's going to come back
[1:32:45] in what they call in the bible he says
[1:32:48] behold the day of the lord
[1:32:49] comes both cruel and it's going to be a
[1:32:53] horrible thing when he comes back to
[1:32:54] this earth
[1:32:56] right the wrath of god is going to get
[1:32:58] poured out upon mankind
[1:33:00] just like it was in the days of noah
[1:33:03] every man woman and child
[1:33:04] died from the flood so the fire is going
[1:33:08] to fall and
[1:33:09] burn the earth with fervent heat and all
[1:33:11] the things are in there going to
[1:33:13] be burnt up isn't that right when he
[1:33:15] comes the day of the lord it's going to
[1:33:17] come
[1:33:18] but we know that before that day comes
[1:33:20] and before he comes back in that manner
[1:33:22] we know that he says you know that
[1:33:24] there's going to be a rapture that takes
[1:33:26] place we which are alive and remain unto
[1:33:28] his coming shall be caught up together
[1:33:30] to meet the lord in the air two will be
[1:33:32] in the field two will be in bed one will
[1:33:34] be taken and the other one will be left
[1:33:35] in that right
[1:33:36] she will be working but he'll come as a
[1:33:38] thief in the night and he'll catch his
[1:33:40] little waiting people away
[1:33:42] because he's not going to destroy the
[1:33:44] just with the wicked
[1:33:47] he didn't destroy noah with the wicked
[1:33:49] he didn't destroy a lot with the wicked
[1:33:51] isn't that right
[1:33:52] he never give the same punishment to the
[1:33:54] believer as it does the unbeliever
[1:33:58] amen he makes a way of asking
[1:34:01] aren't you glad that he provides
[1:34:03] everything
[1:34:08] folks i can't help it when i think about
[1:34:10] god and who he is
[1:34:11] i just get a little excited when i think
[1:34:15] about what god is not about what we are
[1:34:19] but what he is and how that he provides
[1:34:24] folks i thank god for air conditioning
[1:34:29] how many likes how many would like to
[1:34:31] sit right there
[1:34:32] and pour sweat just torn off of you
[1:34:36] you like that no or how about having to
[1:34:39] not get enough coats on it's freezing in
[1:34:42] here
[1:34:43] i mean why because we and we don't like
[1:34:45] the july weather do we
[1:34:48] go ahead out there in that 105 feet
[1:34:50] index go out there and say i just love
[1:34:52] this
[1:34:52] you're probably lying unless you got
[1:34:56] some really
[1:34:56] cold blood uh but we as human beings we
[1:35:00] like it
[1:35:01] in the spring and the fall i love it i i
[1:35:03] like that
[1:35:04] 50s and 70s weather why because it's
[1:35:08] just
[1:35:09] right do you realize that god had killed
[1:35:12] it he's gonna he could turn the
[1:35:13] temperature
[1:35:14] up and he probably will after a while
[1:35:15] but he had and because of the fall
[1:35:17] and the tilting of the earth we know
[1:35:19] that we have it out of cater right now
[1:35:22] it would all be the same nice rather all
[1:35:25] the time if things were in line but
[1:35:26] things are not more online
[1:35:28] that's why it gets a little too cold it
[1:35:30] gets a little too hot
[1:35:33] come on folks how many weather people do
[1:35:36] we have in here
[1:35:37] that likes good weather well i'm so glad
[1:35:40] that god provides and he wants us to be
[1:35:42] comfortable
[1:35:43] he wants it to be just right in your
[1:35:46] life he don't want you to be a miserable
[1:35:48] naked blind poor
[1:35:50] person and neither does he wants to and
[1:35:52] to be anything else but just the way
[1:35:54] that god wants it to be
[1:35:57] are you with me this morning we thank
[1:35:59] god for the comfort
[1:36:01] and it doesn't don't you know that god
[1:36:03] wants to provide everybody with comfort
[1:36:06] everybody wants comfort
[1:36:10] and what did he provide he provided us
[1:36:12] with a comforter
[1:36:14] if i don't go away the comforter can't
[1:36:16] come
[1:36:19] and he made it so that it doesn't matter
[1:36:21] how wicked and how cold and how cool the
[1:36:23] world is it don't even matter so much
[1:36:25] the tribulation in the trials that he
[1:36:27] might lead you through
[1:36:29] you can still say well praise be to god
[1:36:33] huh it is well with my soul
[1:36:37] remember the man that lost his wife his
[1:36:39] children in the boat amen in the ocean
[1:36:41] and the boat went down when he went over
[1:36:42] a boat
[1:36:43] over that same spot he got inspired to
[1:36:45] say it is well it is well with my soul
[1:36:52] aren't you glad for the comforter i mean
[1:36:55] thankful for the comforter that he
[1:36:56] provides
[1:36:58] i like that god in our spiritual self he
[1:37:01] wants
[1:37:02] everything to be just right
[1:37:06] he cares about you
[1:37:11] amen whether everything's wrong or
[1:37:12] whether he's not and how many knows that
[1:37:14] god leads his children along
[1:37:17] he leads us in many different ways and
[1:37:19] he doesn't always lead us
[1:37:20] just to flowery beds of ease
[1:37:24] no but i'll tell you this if you are in
[1:37:26] christ and in christ's care
[1:37:28] and you know that he's providing for you
[1:37:30] it doesn't matter how many
[1:37:31] dead-end roads you come to how many red
[1:37:34] seas you come to
[1:37:35] and you don't know how you're going to
[1:37:37] cross
[1:37:39] isn't that right oh god wanted to hear
[1:37:43] from the children of israel when he took
[1:37:45] him down to that red sea and they
[1:37:46] couldn't go back because the
[1:37:47] egyptians were coming all he wanted to
[1:37:50] hear
[1:37:50] was i love him and i know that he's
[1:37:53] going to take care of me
[1:37:56] and then we are just just give god
[1:37:59] praise
[1:38:00] anyway just like paul when he was in
[1:38:02] prison
[1:38:04] oh he had his he had his seats and
[1:38:06] stalks and everything else
[1:38:07] and he began to just praise the lord
[1:38:10] begin to pray and praise the lord
[1:38:12] and the angels come and open up the
[1:38:14] doors he didn't need nobody to bail him
[1:38:17] out the angels build him out
[1:38:20] god makes a way when you're in god's
[1:38:23] care
[1:38:24] god makes away
[1:38:30] am a personal witness folks many of us
[1:38:32] sitting
[1:38:33] here are a personal witness that when
[1:38:35] you come up to the places you don't know
[1:38:37] how to go over it
[1:38:38] you can't go under you can't go around
[1:38:40] and you don't know which way to go
[1:38:45] which way do you go when you don't know
[1:38:46] which way to go
[1:38:48] how about this way that's a good way to
[1:38:51] go right there
[1:38:52] that's a good way to go say lord
[1:38:55] i can't stand anymore i don't know how
[1:38:58] to go forward anymore so i'm just going
[1:38:59] to go down
[1:39:01] and i'm going to say god here this is
[1:39:02] for you i can't handle this
[1:39:05] i need you to handle this
[1:39:10] oh i've heard so many illustrations
[1:39:12] already of of the three hebrew children
[1:39:15] and how they didn't know which way to go
[1:39:16] they were in stocks and they were bound
[1:39:18] and they were being led to the fire
[1:39:19] but they trusted in their god and he
[1:39:22] made a way
[1:39:25] took the very heat out of the fire
[1:39:30] oh took the very heat out of the fire
[1:39:37] aren't you glad that god makes way
[1:39:41] god always makes the way he forgives you
[1:39:43] comfort he makes a way
[1:39:46] always with every trial everything comes
[1:39:48] your way he makes a way of escape
[1:39:51] it would really be bad if he didn't make
[1:39:53] it away wouldn't it he'd be stuck in
[1:39:55] that state
[1:39:58] but he always provides a way
[1:40:02] and in this generation how many of those
[1:40:04] that god has
[1:40:05] a provided way for
[1:40:08] this day when
[1:40:11] all of the evil that is coming in and
[1:40:13] it's flooding in
[1:40:15] this in the 1950s and 60s
[1:40:18] brother bannon said that the lid has
[1:40:20] come off of hell
[1:40:23] and he said you watch sin go plum to the
[1:40:26] core now
[1:40:26] you watch it get worse and worse and
[1:40:28] worse
[1:40:31] hasn't it done just that the sale of the
[1:40:33] lord has done
[1:40:34] just that it got worse and worse and
[1:40:36] worse and worse and
[1:40:38] man don't know if it's a man or woman
[1:40:39] anymore
[1:40:45] he said the world will eventually go
[1:40:47] completely insane
[1:40:49] we have arrived
[1:40:53] just a few short years ago the very
[1:40:56] people that are condoning it
[1:40:58] would have said that's insanity
[1:41:01] huh now they do it
[1:41:04] all right folks in the early 1900s if a
[1:41:09] woman went out there
[1:41:10] and she had her sh addressed up to here
[1:41:12] did i arrested her
[1:41:16] she was i did arrested her for
[1:41:18] immorality
[1:41:21] and you can look back and look at
[1:41:22] pictures of history and how it is and
[1:41:24] how did
[1:41:25] it just progress and got worse and worse
[1:41:27] and worse and worse
[1:41:28] now look at him out there didn't they
[1:41:29] get you don't know it
[1:41:33] hello but what is it god is going to
[1:41:36] make your way
[1:41:38] in this hour when that darkness and
[1:41:40] those
[1:41:41] demons of hell amen that wickedness just
[1:41:44] going to flood the earth over and it's
[1:41:46] going to consume
[1:41:48] almost everybody i like that almost
[1:41:51] praise the lord for the almost
[1:41:53] it's going to consume almost everybody
[1:41:58] but even like the bible says if god
[1:42:00] wouldn't have left them a seed we'd have
[1:42:02] all been made like
[1:42:03] unto solomon and gomorrah if god
[1:42:07] wouldn't have left us a word
[1:42:12] as you see jesus is the i was he's the
[1:42:14] word of yesterday he's
[1:42:16] the i am he's the word of today and he
[1:42:18] is the i will be
[1:42:20] he's the beginning he's the ending he's
[1:42:22] the first he's which he is
[1:42:24] and which will be he's all of it if god
[1:42:27] wouldn't have left us a word
[1:42:29] and the way that god has made for this
[1:42:31] hour god
[1:42:32] knew that we would need something
[1:42:34] powerful
[1:42:36] to get us through this you know right
[1:42:40] i mean i don't know about you but just
[1:42:41] being homies wouldn't have done it for
[1:42:43] me
[1:42:45] just being men and i wouldn't have done
[1:42:46] that all of them blaming young people
[1:42:48] they're losing young people they're
[1:42:49] losing people left and right
[1:42:50] people shifting back and forth they
[1:42:52] don't know where to go
[1:42:56] folks but when the message of the hour
[1:42:57] coming jesus christ come down here
[1:42:59] amen he did the very same things he did
[1:43:01] when he walked the shores of galilee
[1:43:03] through malachi 4.
[1:43:04] he had his picture taken with a man with
[1:43:06] a halo on the back let me tell you about
[1:43:10] this story right here
[1:43:12] i think it was mr best right challenge
[1:43:14] the prophet of god says i can i want to
[1:43:16] prove that there ain't no such a thing
[1:43:17] as divine healing and all those things
[1:43:19] and
[1:43:19] he had photographers everywhere and he
[1:43:21] wanted to get better about him on the
[1:43:22] platform
[1:43:23] put his finger up in his nose and say
[1:43:25] and condemn everything about
[1:43:27] him and all that and the angel finally
[1:43:29] told him he was in the audience he
[1:43:31] wasn't
[1:43:31] debating i believe it was brother at the
[1:43:34] bossworth that debated with him and so
[1:43:35] forth and i asked him one question
[1:43:37] and blew the whole debate out because he
[1:43:39] says there's no such divine healing in
[1:43:41] the new testament and he asked him it
[1:43:43] says all the redemptive
[1:43:44] compound redemptive names of jehovah
[1:43:46] does it apply to jesus jesus one of them
[1:43:48] with jehovah jireh
[1:43:50] i am your healer if he says yeah it
[1:43:52] applies to him that he is our healer
[1:43:54] he couldn't ask to for answer the first
[1:43:56] question but brother man did come with
[1:43:58] you
[1:43:59] with the commission of the angel go and
[1:44:01] close in prayer he says i never claim to
[1:44:03] be healer i'm not a healer i only
[1:44:05] represent jesus christ and so forth amen
[1:44:07] and quickly yeah
[1:44:08] miss smith had his had his people go up
[1:44:10] and put his finger up and everything
[1:44:11] i'll take pictures
[1:44:13] and guess what none of the pictures came
[1:44:16] out none of them come out
[1:44:18] except that one
[1:44:22] only one folks i'm a believer
[1:44:25] that ain't gonna tell me that now i you
[1:44:27] can't tell me a camera doesn't work any
[1:44:29] better than that
[1:44:32] that's just what god wanted it to
[1:44:34] develop he was showing you and me this
[1:44:36] morning that this is who i'm with
[1:44:39] this is the very same pillar of fire
[1:44:40] that led the children of israel
[1:44:42] thousands of years ago amen everywhere
[1:44:44] they went
[1:44:48] why and time after time never again
[1:44:52] never through the dark ages
[1:44:53] did christ come in such a way as he did
[1:44:55] in this hour
[1:44:56] discern the thoughts of the people's
[1:44:58] heart heal the sick 13 people raised
[1:45:00] from the dead did all kinds of miracles
[1:45:02] and signs and wonders
[1:45:04] until you wouldn't have the doubt but it
[1:45:05] has to be god
[1:45:08] that's why i stand here because we have
[1:45:10] something sure
[1:45:12] something that you know that you know
[1:45:14] that you know that you know
[1:45:16] something i would take a bullet in my
[1:45:17] head any day for
[1:45:19] i would gladly die for the message of
[1:45:21] the hour it's jesus christ coming and
[1:45:23] showing
[1:45:23] himself alive after two thousand years
[1:45:26] called god
[1:45:27] knew i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:45:29] before the great
[1:45:32] and dread paul and peter and all of them
[1:45:36] aren't you glad that god has provided a
[1:45:38] way in our day
[1:45:41] you can there's only two ways that's
[1:45:43] your way or god's way
[1:45:44] it's not my way and then god come and do
[1:45:47] my way no
[1:45:50] there's going to be way too many people
[1:45:51] amen that's going to be disappointed on
[1:45:53] that
[1:45:54] hour you know even jesus says you know
[1:45:57] i'm going to provide
[1:45:58] robes there's a wedding and and the one
[1:46:00] that had the wedding furnish the guests
[1:46:02] with robes isn't that right
[1:46:04] at the door they furnish every grass
[1:46:06] rich or poor with a robe
[1:46:08] and when he comes in there and when he
[1:46:10] got to his marriage and suppose there
[1:46:11] was a man in there that did not
[1:46:14] have a robot
[1:46:17] how many believes that jesus christ
[1:46:21] provides us with the robe you don't try
[1:46:25] to make your own like adam did
[1:46:27] don't try to make your own righteousness
[1:46:30] like adam no it has to be his
[1:46:32] righteousness we come god's way or you
[1:46:33] don't come
[1:46:35] amen there was a guest in there did not
[1:46:38] have the robe on now how many knows that
[1:46:40] if you ain't got the righteousness the
[1:46:42] pure
[1:46:42] clean white linen of the saints amen
[1:46:45] imminent of the righteousness of jesus
[1:46:47] christ
[1:46:47] then your own righteousness it says what
[1:46:51] filthy rags there was a guy coming there
[1:46:54] ain't that he had been working
[1:46:56] perhaps a mechanic and he got up in that
[1:46:59] oil and he got dirty there's hardly
[1:47:00] anybody gets more dirty than a mechanic
[1:47:02] he had that dirt and grease all over him
[1:47:04] and then the master come says what are
[1:47:06] you grease monkey
[1:47:08] doing in here
[1:47:11] what are you doing you know robot you're
[1:47:13] sturdy filthy
[1:47:16] what'd he do called the guards
[1:47:19] ushers take him out find him hand and
[1:47:22] foot
[1:47:23] and cast him in the hollow darkness
[1:47:25] there will be weeping and wailing and
[1:47:26] gnashing of faith
[1:47:29] and it comes on the other way and
[1:47:30] through jesus christ that god has
[1:47:32] provided
[1:47:33] they're going to be cast out into the
[1:47:34] tribulation period
[1:47:37] and when them atomic bombs come and they
[1:47:39] begin to feel them heat wave
[1:47:42] their teeth will nash and their they'll
[1:47:43] gnaw their tongues for pain as they die
[1:47:47] they will be weeping and wailing and
[1:47:49] gnashing of teeth
[1:47:53] oh my aren't you glad that god made the
[1:47:55] way
[1:47:56] oh my with everybody is sad
[1:47:59] and blue
[1:48:03] huh folks how you can go go you can try
[1:48:06] crack cocaine you can try all of that
[1:48:09] stuff
[1:48:09] you can try whatever you want there

[1:48:12] happiness and joy except jesus christ
[1:48:15] huh the other it'll destroy you it'll
[1:48:18] destroy your family
[1:48:19] it'll destroy everything it's a
[1:48:22] destroyer

[1:48:27] it causes you to love your wife more it
[1:48:30] causes you to love
[1:48:32] your husband more it brings the family
[1:48:34] together
[1:48:35] that's what god provides joy
[1:48:38] unspeakable peace that passes
[1:48:40] understanding
[1:48:42] you just can't explain what it's like to
[1:48:45] have your heart
[1:48:46] right with god
[1:48:50] that's right listen
[1:48:54] i want to preach on forgiveness but now
[1:48:55] i'm gonna in en
[1:48:57] envelop it in it if it's all right god
[1:49:00] provided forgiveness
[1:49:02] huh because he knew after adam fell
[1:49:06] that we were some rascals he knew that
[1:49:09] we were some sinners he knew we were far
[1:49:12] from perfect he realized that we'd fall
[1:49:16] short
[1:49:17] isn't that right amen and uh amen and we
[1:49:20] know that he told abraham when he was up
[1:49:22] there
[1:49:23] offering his son and so forth and the
[1:49:25] son asked him we have the wood and the
[1:49:26] fire but where's the sacrifice
[1:49:29] amen and abraham says god will provide
[1:49:33] himself
[1:49:33] a sacrifice that's exactly what god did
[1:49:36] he provided himself
[1:49:38] came man amen who had a sacrifice died
[1:49:41] for your sins and for my sins
[1:49:46] so that you could have forgiveness 490
[1:49:49] times a day
[1:49:50] if that's what you needed but he knew
[1:49:53] that we needed some serious forgiveness
[1:49:55] aren't you thankful he provided
[1:49:57] forgiveness for us because without
[1:49:58] forgiveness you can't be right with god
[1:50:04] we need forgiveness every day
[1:50:08] amen and i thank god for that
[1:50:10] forgiveness
[1:50:11] that brings us back into fellowship back
[1:50:13] into a place
[1:50:15] to where we can have god run our
[1:50:19] life oh aren't you glad for that
[1:50:24] i'm so thankful for that
[1:50:29] listen when god made man brother barron
[1:50:32] says he says he made him thus
[1:50:34] he made him a certain compartment in the
[1:50:36] throne room of his heart
[1:50:38] he says god wants to lead man but man
[1:50:41] wants to lead himself
[1:50:45] jesus said my sheep know my
[1:50:48] voice how many knows that we are
[1:50:51] considered
[1:50:52] sheep sheep have to be led
[1:50:55] that's our problem so many times we let
[1:50:57] our head lead us
[1:50:58] instead of god through the heart lead us
[1:51:02] every one of us was meant every man was
[1:51:04] made
[1:51:06] to have god on the throne room of that
[1:51:08] heart
[1:51:09] you know the good thing that god made
[1:51:11] when he made man
[1:51:13] he provided us with what we call a
[1:51:15] thirst
[1:51:17] am i right that's why a lot of us is
[1:51:19] sitting here this morning
[1:51:20] because we're thirsting for something we
[1:51:23] need something more
[1:51:25] there's got to be more to life than this
[1:51:26] huh
[1:51:28] we want more of god we have i who have
[1:51:30] been a christian for
[1:51:31] i don't know how many years close to 40
[1:51:33] maybe
[1:51:34] i still want more of him i still thirst
[1:51:38] blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[1:51:42] for they are not going to get what i
[1:51:44] provide for them
[1:51:47] no for they shall be
[1:51:50] filled god is in the filling
[1:51:53] business how many believes that
[1:51:57] he wants us everyone to be filled
[1:52:00] to overflowing
[1:52:03] but it's our own ways to get in the way
[1:52:07] we have to let go all right can i read
[1:52:09] some more listen
[1:52:10] he wants to lead himself therefore there
[1:52:13] is a war
[1:52:14] constantly the man wants to go after the
[1:52:16] things that he sees with his eyes
[1:52:19] is that right and that's where he's
[1:52:21] deceived that's where
[1:52:22] eve was deceived because the things that
[1:52:25] she could see
[1:52:26] now paul said we knew look not to the
[1:52:29] things that are seen
[1:52:30] but the things are not seen because the
[1:52:33] things that are seen are what
[1:52:36] temporal but the things that are not
[1:52:38] seen are
[1:52:39] eternal oh my you see me happy this
[1:52:45] morning
[1:52:45] you see the fire burning it's the unseen
[1:52:50] and you please lord i need more of you
[1:52:53] lord will you touch me will you come and
[1:52:55] give me the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:52:57] will you fill me with your power
[1:53:00] and he does how do you know
[1:53:04] well i hate to go by feelings but you'll
[1:53:07] feel it when it happens
[1:53:09] you'll know when it happens oh yeah
[1:53:13] when god comes down in your heart and he
[1:53:15] does something for you
[1:53:16] i like brother brother brian's testimony
[1:53:20] 40 some odd years huh 20-something years
[1:53:23] old how was
[1:53:24] how was you when he accepted the lord
[1:53:25] brother 22
[1:53:28] i think i was married at 22 so it's
[1:53:30] around 20 that i accepted so
[1:53:32] just a couple of years apart and look at
[1:53:33] us
[1:53:35] old men now huh
[1:53:40] i want to say well if you're 52 53
[1:53:42] you're not old yet but
[1:53:43] when you get close to 60 you might as
[1:53:44] well confess it you're old now
[1:53:51] but i'll tell you this right now is
[1:53:54] something that holds
[1:53:56] you i like brother mark's testimony i
[1:53:59] said that just a few weeks ago we're
[1:54:00] talking about how that
[1:54:01] you know if you're really a son of god
[1:54:04] if you're really one of god's children
[1:54:05] and he has saved you
[1:54:06] it's for eternity it's not just for 20
[1:54:10] 25 years
[1:54:12] brothers mark i'm convinced that folks
[1:54:14] that even preachers
[1:54:16] i i know preachers that have preached
[1:54:18] for a very very long time amen
[1:54:22] a family member their dad died a couple
[1:54:25] years later
[1:54:26] they're announcing the message
[1:54:28] announcing everything
[1:54:31] what there's something not right down
[1:54:34] here
[1:54:36] god don't do a work like that it's a
[1:54:39] pretender
[1:54:40] somebody that can do it with their mind
[1:54:42] and so forth but it's got to be here
[1:54:44] way down in your soul it's for time and
[1:54:47] eternity when god does it
[1:54:50] amen you love him oh my but notice how
[1:54:54] that
[1:54:55] not he's let me say this and he says you
[1:54:57] notice a man or a woman that tries to
[1:54:59] walk after the things of this world
[1:55:02] amen what the bible says what is what is
[1:55:05] the things of the world the lust of
[1:55:06] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[1:55:08] of life
[1:55:09] if you've got the love of the world in
[1:55:11] you the love of the father isn't in you
[1:55:13] because all of these things are going to
[1:55:15] pass away we are looking for christ to
[1:55:17] come
[1:55:18] we're going to live with him for a
[1:55:19] thousand years there's a new heaven
[1:55:21] a new earth we're in dwell of
[1:55:23] unrighteousness
[1:55:24] no not one bit of sin is going to be
[1:55:27] over there amen
[1:55:29] we're looking for that we look at the
[1:55:31] unseen not the things that we can see
[1:55:34] he says look if you ever if you just
[1:55:36] look at the things of the world you
[1:55:37] never can
[1:55:38] please god amen
[1:55:41] but a man a woman that will look at the
[1:55:44] but just go according to the leading of
[1:55:46] the spirit they're usually in the will
[1:55:48] of god
[1:55:49] paul said that the children of god
[1:55:52] are what led by the spirit of god
[1:55:59] praise be to god how many believes it's
[1:56:00] important that we are led
[1:56:03] by the spirit of god
[1:56:06] not just by the things that we see how
[1:56:09] many knows in the age
[1:56:11] that we live in the sight and
[1:56:14] the sight thing is stronger than
[1:56:17] ever amen
[1:56:20] not just for wanting things amen
[1:56:24] but the lust of the flesh all of that is
[1:56:26] stronger than
[1:56:28] ever and you have to be stronger than
[1:56:30] ever in the lord to overcome
[1:56:32] [Applause]
[1:56:34] and close your eyes and say look we know
[1:56:35] that this is all going to pass away
[1:56:38] folks i'm here to tell you it's not
[1:56:40] going to last much longer
[1:56:42] not going to last much longer it's
[1:56:44] getting too evil the cup of iniquity
[1:56:46] is really starting to trickle over the
[1:56:48] edge a little bit
[1:56:49] it's full fixing to run over and god is
[1:56:52] fixing to take it out
[1:56:55] he's going to bring a change how many
[1:56:57] thankful for that
[1:57:00] praise be to god
[1:57:03] so many times that god with his people
[1:57:06] was always there to provide a way
[1:57:09] remember when the children of israel
[1:57:11] they begin to complain and they murmur
[1:57:13] and the dev and the lord brought in
[1:57:15] serpents snakes to bite the people
[1:57:18] isn't that right he bite the people and
[1:57:20] thousands of them die because of their
[1:57:22] complaining but then god made it away
[1:57:24] from the live and they took a serpent
[1:57:27] and they put him up on a pole
[1:57:29] a brass pole and that serpent
[1:57:31] represented your nature your evil nature
[1:57:34] that has to go to calvary and die
[1:57:38] and that right put on the pole and then
[1:57:40] they even have it on the ambulances now
[1:57:42] that it was a type of you look upon that
[1:57:45] serpent he said
[1:57:46] and live kind of some strange thing to
[1:57:50] look at isn't it
[1:57:51] but look upon your old nature being dead
[1:57:54] and it'll bring you life
[1:57:55] in that right it'll bring you life if
[1:57:57] you'll die to your own nature
[1:58:00] amen praise be to god
[1:58:04] with every temptation the bible says
[1:58:06] with every temptation that comes your
[1:58:08] way god always makes
[1:58:10] a way of escape
[1:58:14] aren't you glad that god makes a way of
[1:58:15] escape no matter what the trial is no
[1:58:17] matter what the test is
[1:58:18] if you really seek it with all your
[1:58:20] heart say god there's got to be a way
[1:58:22] here
[1:58:24] and he'll open up a path
[1:58:27] sometimes it's not like we figure it all
[1:58:30] but i don't know about you but i
[1:58:31] really really like it when i know that
[1:58:34] it was not me
[1:58:35] clearing the way but you know that it
[1:58:36] was god opening
[1:58:38] up the path aren't you glad for god's
[1:58:42] leading
[1:58:43] folks if you're not being led by god if
[1:58:45] you don't have a great heavenly father
[1:58:47] like like a son and daughter of god does
[1:58:50] you're in a whole lot of trouble praise
[1:58:53] be to god
[1:58:55] god is good isn't he amen
[1:59:05] we've got in the dog business a little
[1:59:06] bit me and my wife have
[1:59:08] and when i look at the birth of a dog
[1:59:14] and the instinct that a dog has now we
[1:59:16] know that this is in all nature
[1:59:17] and that right that there's things
[1:59:20] that's put
[1:59:20] in the instinct of nature now i want to
[1:59:23] say this that
[1:59:24] if anybody ever studied nature
[1:59:28] if you take a close look at nature
[1:59:31] whether it's geese that were born
[1:59:33] somewhere but they automatically know
[1:59:34] where to find next
[1:59:37] all the different things you would it
[1:59:39] would almost be enough to save you
[1:59:42] to make you know that that dumb animal
[1:59:45] can't be that smart
[1:59:48] because no matter how many generations
[1:59:51] it's passed down
[1:59:52] they all know what to do
[1:59:57] just like i was talking about the birth
[1:59:58] of a dog that dog has to know
[2:00:00] that within a minute or two it has to
[2:00:02] open that puppy out of the bag
[2:00:05] and that right it's got to clear its
[2:00:06] mouth and so forth to make sure it can
[2:00:08] get a breath
[2:00:09] and then it has to cut the biblical core
[2:00:11] that's a pretty smart animal
[2:00:15] isn't that right and get all of that and
[2:00:17] that's just one instance of
[2:00:18] many things that is in nature itself
[2:00:23] amen as the prophet put he says you know
[2:00:25] that uh up in the north those ducks will
[2:00:27] go up north and dale
[2:00:28] they'll burst a bunch of baby ducks and
[2:00:30] so forth to grow by fall
[2:00:32] all of a sudden maybe the first cool
[2:00:34] wind that comes
[2:00:35] there'll be a certain duck
[2:00:39] certain male duck that'll all of a
[2:00:41] sudden go to quack quack quack quack
[2:00:43] quack quack quack quack quack quack
[2:00:45] y'all weren't expecting this in church
[2:00:46] would you
[2:00:51] all of a sudden he'll go to quacking
[2:00:52] he'll fly over towards the middle of the
[2:00:54] pond and guess what all the other ducks
[2:00:56] quack quack quack quack quack quack
[2:00:57] quack i'm flocking around that one mill
[2:01:00] bird
[2:01:02] bill look at that now barnes this is
[2:01:04] what are you trying to tell us what are
[2:01:05] you trying to tell us
[2:01:08] and when he gets them all together
[2:01:09] they're all quacking they're all having
[2:01:11] a revival
[2:01:12] folks i believe that's the way it's
[2:01:14] going to be before this bride leaves
[2:01:16] amen the pressure is going to bring this
[2:01:17] church together amen
[2:01:19] you're going to hear a bunch of amen
[2:01:20] hallelujah it is about time to go
[2:01:23] amen i believe i'm going to see my loved
[2:01:24] one anytime now the time of the
[2:01:26] rapture is that
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:32] god provides the animal kingdom with an
[2:01:36] instinct
[2:01:37] for survival and that right
[2:01:41] if he would provide them for an instinct
[2:01:43] for survival wouldn't he provide us
[2:01:45] with an instinct for survival when we
[2:01:48] know that it's getting cold outside
[2:01:51] it is getting real cold outside
[2:01:54] it's time to fly to a warmer place
[2:01:57] it's time to go into heavenly atmosphere
[2:02:00] into a heavenly place
[2:02:01] and then let's gather together a minute
[2:02:03] a certain cracker he'll crack and
[2:02:05] they'll just all follow him and all of a
[2:02:06] sudden he'll take to the skies
[2:02:10] and all the others take a bath when they
[2:02:13] head down for the louisiana
[2:02:16] rice paddies or whatever they head back
[2:02:17] down the warmer place
[2:02:19] and they follow that god
[2:02:23] provides us with leadership how many is
[2:02:26] that for leadership
[2:02:29] jesus said my sheep hear my voice
[2:02:33] not only here but this my sheep know
[2:02:37] my voice
[2:02:42] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:02:44] silent angel when he begins shall begin
[2:02:45] to sound
[2:02:46] mystery of god shall be finished he has
[2:02:48] declared to his servants the prophets
[2:02:52] every one of us sitting here most most
[2:02:53] of us anyway are message believers
[2:02:56] when proud when brother man of money
[2:02:58] would preach a message on those tapes
[2:02:59] and when he preached that message
[2:03:02] there was something about it wasn't it
[2:03:04] there was something about it now it
[2:03:06] wasn't necessarily the
[2:03:08] the uh i don't know what you call on the
[2:03:11] octaves of his voice isn't that right
[2:03:15] even though that had something to do
[2:03:16] with it because when he said come out of
[2:03:19] heart my people
[2:03:20] he caught his attention but when he told
[2:03:23] us about
[2:03:24] the baptist methodist presbyterian all
[2:03:26] these different religions what is right
[2:03:29] that caught our attention in it what is
[2:03:32] it because jesus said
[2:03:33] you know i speak the truth
[2:03:37] and my word has no place and you don't
[2:03:39] hear it
[2:03:40] you don't hear the truth he says the
[2:03:42] truth you shall know the truth and the
[2:03:44] truth shall set you free
[2:03:46] it's what he said it's the truth that
[2:03:49] you hear
[2:03:50] that you know is right
[2:03:53] even this morning it isn't the sound of
[2:03:55] my voice
[2:03:56] but it's what i say amen that you're
[2:03:59] supposed to hear
[2:04:02] amen and even jesus said my
[2:04:05] sheep hear my voice they know the truth
[2:04:11] oh my how different it would be
[2:04:14] if brother mark or me would come up say
[2:04:16] that we you know you can
[2:04:18] you can just kind of participate just
[2:04:19] don't let them know where you stand and
[2:04:22] stuff
[2:04:25] that's right it wouldn't sound right
[2:04:28] would it be
[2:04:29] you know we would rather we would rather
[2:04:31] die than to compromise on the truth
[2:04:34] we would rather give our life than to
[2:04:36] knock down to some because
[2:04:37] listen if brother mark listen if he went
[2:04:40] over to that party
[2:04:42] he'd had to go home and revenge because
[2:04:45] he participated in evil
[2:04:48] in a celebration of evil which
[2:04:52] that holy spirit in him no i'm not even
[2:04:55] signing that card
[2:04:57] if i signed it it'd be repent or perish
[2:05:02] it wouldn't like that signature too much
[2:05:05] but yet guess what that would be nothing
[2:05:07] but the truth
[2:05:08] that unless they repent they're going to
[2:05:10] burn in hell period
[2:05:13] that goes for any sinner doing anything
[2:05:15] wrong amen
[2:05:16] repent or perish
[2:05:21] hallelujah so god provided us in this
[2:05:24] hour with not just
[2:05:25] a man not just a preacher but christ
[2:05:27] himself to come down
[2:05:28] and confirm that what was said was the
[2:05:32] truth
[2:05:33] two confirmations with signs following
[2:05:36] according to
[2:05:37] acts acts and matthew says they went out
[2:05:39] preaching the gospel
[2:05:41] and signs followed them and they're
[2:05:43] right
[2:05:44] it has the number one match up with this
[2:05:47] bible
[2:05:49] and then god comes out and he confirms
[2:05:51] it well if you just believe both of
[2:05:53] those
[2:05:53] you're going to be in a whole lot of
[2:05:55] trouble
[2:05:57] amen he leads he he absolutely in all of
[2:06:00] nature amen
[2:06:02] you say that's nature that's not nature
[2:06:04] that is god having put something
[2:06:07] in every one of those little creatures
[2:06:12] and then last night me and my wife is
[2:06:14] sitting out on a recliner
[2:06:16] in the yard well no he wasn't we was
[2:06:19] sitting there but this is not when it
[2:06:20] happened
[2:06:24] but anyway my wife is cleaning things up
[2:06:27] we'll see leave it at that
[2:06:29] and i said honey there was a couple of
[2:06:31] big old cranes
[2:06:32] were flying up through there i said
[2:06:35] honey take
[2:06:35] a minute stop what you doing and look up
[2:06:38] look at some big old birds
[2:06:40] look how beautiful he's running flying
[2:06:41] across our pine trees over through there
[2:06:44] i said look at that how beautiful that
[2:06:46] is then there was a straggler here comes
[2:06:49] another one praise be to god
[2:06:51] and i says you know there's going to be
[2:06:53] birds flying around in heaven
[2:06:56] how many knows that it reminded me of
[2:06:58] when hope came back to brother bannon
[2:07:00] when he called her back
[2:07:01] he says he was beautiful birds were
[2:07:04] flying from tree to tree
[2:07:06] that's what she said amen i believe will
[2:07:09] have birds over there
[2:07:11] but god back this up that god put that
[2:07:14] in
[2:07:15] each every creature and if people would
[2:07:18] look at that and realize hey
[2:07:19] that can't just happen by chance
[2:07:23] a divine architect put that in there
[2:07:29] i'll tell you what that's why that's why
[2:07:31] i believe that any christian loves
[2:07:33] nature
[2:07:34] we love nature because
[2:07:38] it's so unique it's a miracle in itself
[2:07:41] to think just of the leadership of the
[2:07:44] different animals and so forth and how
[2:07:45] they're led
[2:07:46] now that you and i are supposed to be
[2:07:48] led
[2:07:50] amen let me come down towards the close
[2:07:53] of the service but
[2:07:55] i want to talk to you about priorities
[2:07:59] priorities would that be okay
[2:08:03] because if you don't have your
[2:08:05] priorities right
[2:08:07] then you don't really have now i believe
[2:08:09] a child of god is watched over by god
[2:08:11] but god brings you the place of
[2:08:12] repentance he watches you over as you
[2:08:14] sinner
[2:08:15] but you don't have the blessings like a
[2:08:16] believer does
[2:08:18] how many knows that and this is where he
[2:08:20] gets right down and we can really take
[2:08:22] something home with us this morning is
[2:08:24] that okay
[2:08:25] so let's turn to matthew if you will
[2:08:27] this is one of
[2:08:28] one of many of my favorite scriptures in
[2:08:30] the bible when it talks about god's
[2:08:32] providence and god's care
[2:08:35] amen and how god takes care of us how
[2:08:37] did he is our
[2:08:39] supplier and it actually this has a
[2:08:43] i want to try to bring out the deeper
[2:08:45] meaning of this if i can with the help
[2:08:47] of the lord
[2:08:48] matthew 6 we'll begin with verse
[2:08:51] 21. notice here first he says where your
[2:08:54] treasure is
[2:08:56] there will your heart be also how many
[2:08:59] knows your heart
[2:08:59] really needs to be in the right place
[2:09:06] and verse 24 he says no man can serve
[2:09:10] two masters shall either hate the one
[2:09:11] and love the other or else he will hold
[2:09:13] to the one and despise the other you
[2:09:15] cannot serve god and mammon
[2:09:17] amen i don't know
[2:09:21] all right so now verse 25 therefore i
[2:09:23] say unto you
[2:09:24] take no thought for your life or what
[2:09:27] you shall eat or what ye shall drink
[2:09:30] nor yet for the body what ye shall put
[2:09:32] on
[2:09:33] is not the life more than the meat and
[2:09:35] the body than raymond
[2:09:38] behold the fowls of the air they
[2:09:41] so not neither do they reap
[2:09:44] nor gather into barns yet your heavenly
[2:09:48] father
[2:09:48] feedeth them hallelujah
[2:09:52] in the wintertime when it's cold the
[2:09:55] snow
[2:09:56] is covered everything up deer by
[2:09:59] practically eating the bark off the tree
[2:10:01] isn't that right
[2:10:02] how many knows according to this that
[2:10:05] god cares about the birds
[2:10:07] out there even though they don't store
[2:10:09] anything up
[2:10:10] god still watches over them he's a
[2:10:13] caring god
[2:10:16] amen verse 25 gives us
[2:10:19] a hint of what we are
[2:10:22] to think about what take no thought for
[2:10:26] your life so it actually tells us what
[2:10:27] we are to think about
[2:10:29] now ye are much more better than they
[2:10:32] now
[2:10:32] i want to go down to verse 30.
[2:10:36] wherefore if god so clothed the grass of
[2:10:39] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[2:10:40] cast into the oven
[2:10:42] shall he not much more clothe ye o
[2:10:45] ye of little faith
[2:10:48] therefore take no thought saying what
[2:10:51] shall we eat or what shall we drink
[2:10:53] or wherewithal shall we be clothed
[2:10:56] for after all these things do the
[2:10:59] americans
[2:11:00] the germans huh the russians
[2:11:04] north koreans that's this is what all
[2:11:06] the nations of the world
[2:11:08] think seek after that's all they think
[2:11:12] about it
[2:11:12] is their food their clothes huh
[2:11:16] where they it's their houses their
[2:11:19] vehicles
[2:11:20] that's all that they meditate upon
[2:11:24] now notice for after all these things to
[2:11:27] the gentile seek for your heavenly
[2:11:30] father knoweth
[2:11:31] that you have need now how many knows
[2:11:34] that whenever
[2:11:34] you're before you can have something
[2:11:36] supplied there has to be a need
[2:11:41] huh and your heavenly father knows that
[2:11:44] you have need of d
[2:11:45] things of all the
[2:11:49] things but seek ye
[2:11:53] first the kingdom of god and his
[2:11:55] righteousness
[2:11:57] and all these things shall be supplied
[2:12:01] for you how many believes that
[2:12:06] now talking about if you want a heavenly
[2:12:09] father to take care of you
[2:12:12] then he's beginning to tell you what
[2:12:14] your state of mind is
[2:12:15] what he's requiring of you what he's
[2:12:18] requiring of me
[2:12:20] if he's going to take care of you
[2:12:25] now we know that our priorities for the
[2:12:28] most part
[2:12:29] let me not our not ourselves so much not
[2:12:31] if you're a christian
[2:12:32] but the world's priorities there's
[2:12:35] there's three
[2:12:36] let's talk about three priorities one of
[2:12:38] them is yourself
[2:12:40] the other one is uh your family
[2:12:44] huh the other one is supposed to be god
[2:12:48] three priorities and that's pretty much
[2:12:50] the way the world has it
[2:12:52] is myself first because people man they
[2:12:54] don't care about their family they just
[2:12:56] care about themselves
[2:12:58] that what leads to divorces people are
[2:12:59] too selfish
[2:13:01] they don't think about what your mate
[2:13:02] wants that's where they run into
[2:13:05] problems
[2:13:06] huh that's where it is right there the
[2:13:08] shelf first because
[2:13:10] in the last days the bible says men
[2:13:12] shall be lovers of themselves any
[2:13:16] high-minded truth-breakers and so forth
[2:13:18] amen but normally you think about your
[2:13:21] family
[2:13:22] amen before yourself but then your
[2:13:24] family maybe
[2:13:25] and then most people well if i get time
[2:13:28] i'll think about god
[2:13:35] how many knows that's not the way
[2:13:36] priorities are supposed to be
[2:13:39] now notice here that even jesus is
[2:13:41] saying here why are you even thinking
[2:13:43] and
[2:13:44] for ourself what is the first thing we
[2:13:46] think about ourselves if you're thinking
[2:13:47] about yourself
[2:13:48] well have i got nice clothes do i eat
[2:13:50] good
[2:13:52] but he says don't even you shouldn't
[2:13:54] even worry about that
[2:13:55] you shouldn't even worry about whether
[2:13:57] you've got good food deed
[2:13:59] or clothes to wear
[2:14:02] now we're getting stronger isn't it
[2:14:05] because you got to remember that jesus
[2:14:06] didn't have a place to lay his head
[2:14:09] he didn't have no bank account he had to
[2:14:11] go catch some fish
[2:14:13] and get some coins out of fish's mouth
[2:14:14] to pay his taxes with
[2:14:19] see oh my
[2:14:26] all right
[2:14:35] y'all getting quiet now is that all
[2:14:38] right
[2:14:40] jesus said in another place he says if a
[2:14:42] man loves his
[2:14:44] father or mother or brother or wife
[2:14:47] children more than me
[2:14:50] and that right then you're not worthy of
[2:14:53] me
[2:14:54] so if your family is before god
[2:14:57] god's not obligated to you huh
[2:15:01] you don't have your priorities right if
[2:15:03] you got your family before god
[2:15:05] if you got your wife before god or your
[2:15:07] husband before god
[2:15:09] your priorities still aren't right you
[2:15:12] have to have him first
[2:15:14] another place he says if a man is not
[2:15:15] willing to forsake all that he has
[2:15:18] he cannot be my disciple in other words
[2:15:20] you've got to be willing to forsake
[2:15:22] everything he is number one
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:30] we have a lot better lives if we got our
[2:15:32] priorities right
[2:15:34] we could be a different person we get
[2:15:35] our priorities right
[2:15:38] why let me just say something else that
[2:15:40] i've seen that happens to us
[2:15:42] is that we rely too much on other people
[2:15:45] to supply us
[2:15:46] with what we have need up
[2:15:52] in different places i heard the prophet
[2:15:54] talk about he says about the jericho
[2:15:56] road
[2:15:56] how did there's only room on a jericho
[2:15:58] road listen
[2:15:59] let me just read it um
[2:16:03] he says listen man whoever amounts to
[2:16:05] anything is a man
[2:16:07] that stands alone with god
[2:16:12] him and god alone that's the man see
[2:16:15] on the jericho road there's room for
[2:16:18] just two
[2:16:19] no more and no less and that's you
[2:16:22] and jesus
[2:16:27] now how many knows that does not say
[2:16:29] that you can't be with your wife oh my
[2:16:31] goodness no
[2:16:32] if your wife's a christian that's a big
[2:16:33] plus if your family is a christian
[2:16:35] that's a big plus
[2:16:37] but it's all pluses because there's many
[2:16:40] other people that come to christ
[2:16:42] a woman come to christ and the man i
[2:16:44] don't want no part of it
[2:16:47] i'm sorry but i'm going to surrender my
[2:16:49] life to god i don't want to party
[2:16:50] anymore i don't want to do all of this
[2:16:52] anymore
[2:16:52] the man might leave her and divorce her
[2:16:54] it might happen
[2:16:56] huh even jesus said i didn't come to
[2:16:59] bring peace but a sword
[2:17:01] to bring at variance husband wife
[2:17:05] daughter-in-law
[2:17:05] brother-in-law there's a variance there
[2:17:08] if they don't want to follow jesus i'm
[2:17:10] still going to go on
[2:17:12] don't none go with me yet will i follow
[2:17:18] in order to get our priority in order to
[2:17:20] have the kind of master kind of savior
[2:17:22] amen that's going to supply everything
[2:17:24] for us just like a wife
[2:17:26] isn't supposed to have to worry about
[2:17:28] the finances of the house
[2:17:30] that's her husband's job hey man
[2:17:34] he is she is completely in his care he
[2:17:36] better get out there and work till his
[2:17:38] hands bleed to make sure
[2:17:40] she is supplied for
[2:17:45] she can be in the kitchen and house
[2:17:47] praising the lord and just having
[2:17:49] all kinds of good times she don't have
[2:17:50] to get no gray hair
[2:17:54] no worry she's married she has a husband
[2:17:59] that takes care of him
[2:18:02] go ahead amen i'll say it for you
[2:18:06] that's the truth that's the way our
[2:18:09] relationship with him
[2:18:11] that's what god wants us to do he loves
[2:18:13] for
[2:18:14] us to rely on him jehoshaphat had a
[2:18:18] whole army coming against him way
[2:18:20] more he could never handle he fell on
[2:18:22] his knees and dressed in cyclops
[2:18:24] and he never had to lift the blade god
[2:18:26] destroyed them all
[2:18:29] all they did was go and get all the
[2:18:30] jewels and all kinds of
[2:18:33] gold and stuff off of their bodies god
[2:18:36] fought their battles for him
[2:18:37] because he relied upon god
[2:18:41] god supplied his need
[2:18:47] i think we could all come to the altar
[2:18:49] and say god
[2:18:50] i worry too much about my clothes my
[2:18:53] electric bill
[2:18:54] food and i worry too much about it and i
[2:18:58] don't think
[2:18:58] enough about you lord my mind isn't
[2:19:03] completely on being right
[2:19:05] and ready oh i was thinking about ready
[2:19:09] you know and i thought you know i've
[2:19:11] preached before ready or not
[2:19:12] christ is coming i don't really believe
[2:19:14] that's true
[2:19:17] it's true for the unbeliever but i know
[2:19:19] that god
[2:19:20] is going to have a bride with a spot and
[2:19:22] she is going to be ready
[2:19:24] if he said be ready i believe she's
[2:19:26] going to be ready
[2:19:31] and i thought well thomas bottler look
[2:19:32] at your faults look at your failures
[2:19:35] maybe i'm what's keeping this whole
[2:19:37] thing up
[2:19:41] are you ready are you keeping the
[2:19:44] rapture from coming
[2:19:46] are you holding him up do you need a
[2:19:49] closer walkway
[2:19:50] are you not in the place that you ought
[2:19:51] to be
[2:19:57] the one thing that i want to ask
[2:19:59] ourselves is the one thing that i see in
[2:20:01] my life
[2:20:02] and that is that i'm itching closer and
[2:20:05] closer it may not be a big great big
[2:20:07] step
[2:20:08] it might be small steps but as long as
[2:20:10] i'm getting a little closer to christ
[2:20:12] than i was last week
[2:20:14] huh how many is that as long as you're
[2:20:17] making little steps towards god
[2:20:19] then you can rejoice say well look i see
[2:20:21] improvement here
[2:20:22] god is helping me just get a little bit
[2:20:24] at a time
[2:20:26] huh but you sure don't want to be going
[2:20:28] the other way
[2:20:34] if we go back the other way it won't be
[2:20:36] long that our women will rest wrong
[2:20:38] dress wrong huh
[2:20:42] we'll have blue hair we'll have tattoos
[2:20:46] no drinks
[2:20:48] if we go the wrong way but no
[2:20:51] i want to see us more modest i want to
[2:20:53] see let us be modest in a modest apparel
[2:20:55] the bible says
[2:20:57] huh our brothers
[2:21:00] oh boy here we go
[2:21:05] man of the house the spiritual
[2:21:09] leader of the house
[2:21:15] treats his wife like christ treats the
[2:21:18] church
[2:21:19] and gives himself for her
[2:21:26] bible says that a man that is married
[2:21:28] seeks the things of the world
[2:21:30] how did he can go ahead
[2:21:35] please his wife
[2:21:39] your wife ought to have a smile on her
[2:21:41] face
[2:21:44] no you don't go get that boo new bow and
[2:21:46] arrow
[2:21:47] and then they'll buy her no pots and
[2:21:49] pans we ain't got no money for that
[2:21:50] arnie
[2:21:51] and how could you buy that big old bow
[2:21:53] that was twelve hundred dollars
[2:21:56] here we go already
[2:22:01] men that love their wives have
[2:22:04] themselves i've often said if you do
[2:22:06] that
[2:22:06] your family problems are taken care of
[2:22:10] if she leaves you after you treat her
[2:22:12] like that you don't need her anyway
[2:22:17] ooh that was kind of strong wasn't it i
[2:22:20] said if she leaves you not you throw her
[2:22:22] out or something but if she leaves and
[2:22:24] you treat me real good
[2:22:25] huh that's not on you
[2:22:29] amen all right where was he
[2:22:33] seek the kingdom first take no thought
[2:22:36] for tomorrow for the marshall take care
[2:22:37] of the thought of itself
[2:22:38] sufficient for the day is the evil
[2:22:41] thereof so that's what he was saying
[2:22:43] that our minds should be on god's
[2:22:45] kingdom
[2:22:46] and us being ready to meet him at
[2:22:49] any time one more thought can i convey
[2:22:53] one more thought to you and that is the
[2:22:54] thought of relying on others for our joy
[2:22:57] for our happiness that's why i brought
[2:23:00] this out it's just you
[2:23:02] and him
[2:23:06] well i went to this church and nobody's
[2:23:08] friendly
[2:23:10] huh tell you what i was outside and
[2:23:12] people just walked by and
[2:23:13] nobody's friendly i'm not going back to
[2:23:16] that church
[2:23:17] huh folks you're going to be going to a
[2:23:19] lot of churches
[2:23:23] you see folks it's you and christ
[2:23:26] and if there ain't a friend in the world
[2:23:29] you'll be singing
[2:23:30] what a friend i have in jesus oh he's
[2:23:35] the best friend you'll ever have
[2:23:37] you might get disappointed and probably
[2:23:39] will get disappointed in your friends
[2:23:40] sooner or later a little bit am i right
[2:23:42] but this friend will never forsake you
[2:23:43] he'll never leave you you'll always be
[2:23:45] the best
[2:23:46] friend that you've ever had
[2:23:49] well nobody loves me
[2:23:53] come on folks do you realize what you
[2:23:57] have when you
[2:23:58] go tell me something somebody this is
[2:24:00] i'm going to leave it open when you have
[2:24:01] the holy ghost what have you got
[2:24:07] you have everything that you'll ever
[2:24:10] have
[2:24:10] need of in this life's journey and when
[2:24:13] you come to taking your last breath
[2:24:15] god's going to take care of you then is
[2:24:18] that right
[2:24:20] you can't rely you can't have this walk
[2:24:22] with this one and with that one
[2:24:24] you'll find yourself by the wayside it's
[2:24:28] you and god that's the walk no matter
[2:24:31] what anybody else does
[2:24:32] you're walking with god
[2:24:38] remember when jesus preached real hard
[2:24:40] and everybody left
[2:24:43] and he says to disciples are you going
[2:24:45] to leave me too
[2:24:48] he said are you going to leave me too
[2:24:55] and how many knows that they eventually
[2:24:57] did
[2:25:00] peter even denied knowing the guy
[2:25:03] three times they all forsook him he
[2:25:06] didn't have anybody
[2:25:08] but did that keep did he miss did he
[2:25:10] lose out on his course
[2:25:12] no he kept the course because him
[2:25:15] and the father him and the holy ghost
[2:25:17] right here
[2:25:18] in that right all the way to the end
[2:25:22] doesn't matter what the disciples did
[2:25:24] doesn't matter what anybody else did
[2:25:26] he had a relationship with god this
[2:25:29] brings me to mind
[2:25:30] that people and christians so time so
[2:25:33] many times
[2:25:34] need they have need uh they need
[2:25:37] attention
[2:25:40] huh they need attention
[2:25:43] well i want attention and they want to
[2:25:46] be ministered to
[2:25:47] but remember what jesus said i didn't
[2:25:50] come to be ministered you don't have to
[2:25:51] baby me
[2:25:54] you don't have to baby me i didn't come
[2:25:57] to minute be ministered to
[2:25:59] but i came to minister
[2:26:02] in other words i came to give love i
[2:26:04] came to give care
[2:26:06] i came to give it's not whether i get it
[2:26:08] back and
[2:26:09] it's that's what i come for amen and
[2:26:12] that's the way i believe christians are
[2:26:14] every one of us it doesn't matter
[2:26:15] whether people love us or not
[2:26:17] whether care for us or not my friend or
[2:26:19] not i want you to be i like lots of
[2:26:21] friends and
[2:26:21] lots of love and lots of pats on the
[2:26:23] back sure
[2:26:24] we all like that good job brother by the
[2:26:26] good decided to the other but doesn't
[2:26:28] have to have
[2:26:30] nah doesn't matter i'm still going to
[2:26:33] love people just as much anyway
[2:26:35] i'm here to minister how many is with me
[2:26:36] let's be ministers not have to be
[2:26:38] ministered
[2:26:39] to brother babe says people that need
[2:26:42] attention are people usually that are
[2:26:43] sick
[2:26:47] i'll tell you what when your wife gets
[2:26:48] sick you better give her attention
[2:26:50] isn't that right when one of us will
[2:26:52] have the need or whatever we want to
[2:26:54] give him attention and eat it
[2:26:56] but if you're spiritually healthy you
[2:26:58] shouldn't need attention
[2:27:00] amen god bless you this morning
[2:27:04] this is just what the lord laid on my
[2:27:05] heart amen
[2:27:08] thinking about the jared cole road how
[2:27:11] do we walk with him and how did he
[2:27:12] supplies
[2:27:14] everything that we have need of amen
[2:27:19] praise the lord this just comes to mind
[2:27:24] you are sitting on the very thing that i
[2:27:27] just said
[2:27:28] it was divinely provided
[2:27:32] we got this church almost done but we
[2:27:34] had no seats
[2:27:36] isn't that right and a tornado tore down
[2:27:40] a baptist church
[2:27:43] and we went to them folks i don't know
[2:27:45] who did brother john but some of us
[2:27:46] maybe brother billy or
[2:27:47] some of us asked that church what they
[2:27:49] were going to do with it
[2:27:52] if i'm not wrong they said that we could
[2:27:53] have it free of charge right
[2:27:56] completely free of charge so as you see
[2:27:59] you're sitting on god's provided way
[2:28:04] let's give the lord a hand
[2:28:15] take a minute as i close and think about
[2:28:19] your life
[2:28:20] think about what god has supplied for
[2:28:22] you when you didn't know how it was
[2:28:23] going to be
[2:28:24] happen huh think about it
[2:28:32] i'm thinking about something right now
[2:28:34] it was great it was big it was huge
[2:28:37] didn't know which way to go there god
[2:28:39] made a way
[2:28:41] now do you have a thought let's give him
[2:28:43] another hand
[2:28:44] for what he's done for you say thank you
[2:28:46] lord jesus
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:28:53] in closing stand with me
[2:28:58] saint john 14 jesus says behold i go
[2:29:01] and i prepare a place for you that where
[2:29:05] i am
[2:29:07] there you can be also how he's looking
[2:29:08] forward to go to that place
[2:29:10] that he's going to supply he's going to
[2:29:12] have a place ready for us
[2:29:14] amen
[2:29:20] see folks god has called me the pastor
[2:29:22] he's called me the pastor
[2:29:23] he's called me to help you get
[2:29:26] ready how many believes that that's how
[2:29:29] i want every one of us
[2:29:31] i want you ready and waiting
[2:29:35] if you go by the way the rapture that's
[2:29:36] wonderful but if you come down to the
[2:29:38] door of the grave and i've had several
[2:29:41] people go
[2:29:42] by the way of the grave that i can say
[2:29:45] this morning
[2:29:46] that i was proud of them they did not
[2:29:49] fear death
[2:29:50] when they looked it in the face when
[2:29:52] they embraced it
[2:29:53] they did not fear it there was no fear
[2:29:56] there
[2:29:57] they were ready to go that's how i want
[2:30:00] to be that's why each one of us because
[2:30:02] guess what
[2:30:02] one of these days is going to be the
[2:30:04] ultimate
[2:30:06] need that you have and that is for god
[2:30:09] to supply for you if you take your last
[2:30:13] breath
[2:30:14] you say lord into thy hands
[2:30:18] i commit my spirit huh you're gonna
[2:30:21] rely upon god at that time to take your
[2:30:24] spirit
[2:30:25] and put it in that new body you're gonna
[2:30:27] completely
[2:30:29] rely on god
[2:30:32] let me say this i believe our daily life
[2:30:34] with our heads
[2:30:35] bowed in our daily life that's what we
[2:30:39] need to do
[2:30:40] completely rely on god to lead us
[2:30:44] and to guide us and we put our complete
[2:30:48] trust and faith in him
[2:30:50] that what we have need of he knows all
[2:30:53] about it he knows
[2:30:54] behold the fowls of the air he said look
[2:30:57] at the bird i take care of them aren't
[2:30:59] you worth a lot
[2:31:00] more than that god is looking down every
[2:31:02] day
[2:31:03] and he is looking at what you're
[2:31:05] thinking about
[2:31:08] he is looking at what you are caring
[2:31:11] the most about he is looking at your
[2:31:14] heart
[2:31:15] and he's saying where is your heart
[2:31:20] because he says that wherever your
[2:31:22] treasure is
[2:31:23] that's where your heart will be also
[2:31:26] may god begin to help us each and every
[2:31:29] one
[2:31:30] every day of our life to make him the
[2:31:32] center
[2:31:33] of all that we do all that we say
[2:31:37] and all that we think
[2:31:42] lord jesus we bow our heads to you this
[2:31:43] morning
[2:31:47] and as we bow i want to ask the
[2:31:49] congregation how many
[2:31:51] in here knows that you really
[2:31:55] need to begin to focus on god more than
[2:31:57] what you do
[2:31:59] the things of this world the holy spirit
[2:32:03] spoken to you
[2:32:04] this morning said you know your focus is
[2:32:07] still not right where it should be
[2:32:08] your priorities are still not quite
[2:32:11] right

[2:32:14] into disguise but first your priorities
[2:32:16] have to be right

[2:32:20] worthy of that
[2:32:23] i'm god almighty i take care of you i'll
