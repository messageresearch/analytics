[36:11] And we have several prayer requests
[36:13] tonight we want to take to the Lord in
[36:15] prayer. Also,
[36:18] Brother Thomas, I believe, has the
[36:19] address of where they've moved Sister
[36:21] Peggy to, and I think he's going to make
[36:23] that available. But we want to continue
[36:25] to remember Sister Peggy that God will
[36:27] just continue to help her, and also
[36:29] Sister Parish.
[36:32] And we also want to remember Sister
[36:33] McCagan and the the girls that God will
[36:36] just continue to move in their lives
[36:39] tonight. And I just really had them on
[36:43] my heart. and and I know God's going to
[36:45] do a miracle for him. He's already done
[36:46] a miracle for him. We're just trusting
[36:49] in him the rest of the way. And also, we
[36:52] want to remember sister Adriana, she's
[36:54] not feeling well tonight. And just pray
[36:57] that God will touch her body. And just
[37:00] pray that the Lord will heal her
[37:01] tonight. And also, some of the Wade
[37:04] family is sick. They didn't say which
[37:06] ones were, but we want to remember them
[37:08] tonight in prayer that God would just
[37:10] touch their bodies. And also I received
[37:13] a message before church that my uncle
[37:15] he's in his 90s he's fell again and and
[37:19] uh he's at that stage they're going to
[37:21] have to probably put him in assisted
[37:24] living and I know he's not going to be
[37:26] too happy with that but he's having some
[37:29] issues and and my aunt Brenda she's been
[37:31] in the hospital in Nashville they had
[37:33] overmedicated her and she's doing a lot
[37:35] better. So continue to remember them in
[37:37] your prayers. If you have need on your
[37:38] heart, you might let it be known
[37:40] tonight. Amen. We're going to ask

[41:31] a testimony meeting next Wednesday.
[41:34] Amen. Next Wednesday night. And um
[41:40] can't think of any other announcements.
[41:41] Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we
[41:43] come before you, Lord. Grateful, Father,
[41:45] to be able to assemble ourselves
[41:47] together once again. Lord, in your name,
[41:51] Lord, listening to your spirit,
[41:53] believing, Father, that you'll come down
[41:54] and speak to our hearts, Lord, by your
[41:57] Holy Spirit tonight, Father, search our
[41:59] lives, search our hearts, help us to
[42:01] prepare for that great day that lays
[42:03] ahead, Lord. We ask, God, that you'll
[42:05] just help me to get out of the way, Lord
[42:07] Jesus, and open the ears of the of the
[42:11] hearers, Lord. For we know, Father, that
[42:14] having an ear to hear is real important,
[42:17] Lord. So we ask God that you'll help
[42:19] each one of our ears to be open. Father,
[42:21] the same way with those may be streaming
[42:23] tonight. We ask God that they would lay
[42:26] aside whatever they're doing and focus
[42:28] in Lord Jesus of what the Holy Spirit
[42:30] would have to say to the church tonight.
[42:32] And we just be careful to give you the
[42:34] praise, the honor, and the glory now in
[42:36] Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[42:40] Amen. Do feel like I've got a little
[42:42] message. Amen. Uh tonight. Amen. And so
[42:48] we'll just get right into it. Kind of
[42:51] different.
[42:53] Amen. But
[42:55] uh
[42:57] I just pray the Lord help me help me.
[43:00] Amen. Period. To bring it out in the way
[43:02] that kind of God brought it to me. And
[43:05] I'll just go to the scriptures basically
[43:07] that come to mind when I begin on this.
[43:09] And I think it's in u
[43:13] second Peter.
[43:16] Second Peter.
[43:23] And if you have bring the title up if
[43:25] you will. I'll give you my title. Kind
[43:28] of a different title. Amen. What then?
[43:33] Now and then.
[43:35] Amen. That's very different, isn't it?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Very different. Amen. But that's the
[43:40] best way I knew to put it.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[43:47] So, second Peter 3
[43:51] and we'll begin with verse three.
[43:54] Knowing this first that there shall come
[43:57] in the last days scoffers and walking
[43:59] after their own lusts and saying, "Where
[44:02] is the promise of his coming? For since
[44:04] the fathers fell asleep, all things
[44:06] continue as they were from the beginning
[44:08] of the creation. For this they willingly
[44:11] are ignorant of that by the word of God,
[44:14] the heavens were of old, and the earth
[44:16] standing out of the water and in the
[44:18] water,
[44:20] whereby the world that then was being
[44:23] overflowed with water perished.
[44:27] But the heavens and the earth which are
[44:28] now by the same word are kept in store
[44:31] reserved unto fire against the day of
[44:34] judgment and predition of ungodly men.
[44:38] But beloved, be not ignorant of this one
[44:40] thing that the day of the Lord is as the
[44:42] day with the Lord is as a thousand years
[44:44] and a thousand years is one day. The
[44:47] Lord is not slack concerning his
[44:49] promise. Amen. I got to stop there just
[44:52] just for a second. Amen.
[44:55] Don't you believe that that's the way
[44:57] it's going to be when we get over there?
[44:58] One day is going to be like a thousand
[45:00] years and one day and a thousand years
[45:02] like one day. Amen. Can you imagine a
[45:05] thousand years being like one day? Can't
[45:09] imagine it. But the Lord is not slack
[45:11] concerning his promise as some men count
[45:13] slackness, but is long-suffering to
[45:15] usward, not willing that any should
[45:16] perish, but that all should come to
[45:18] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[45:20] come as a thief in a night in which the
[45:22] heavens shall pass away with a great
[45:24] noise, and the elements shall melt with
[45:26] fervent heat. The earth also, and the
[45:28] works thereof that are therein, shall be
[45:32] burnt up, seeing that all these things
[45:35] shall be dissolved. manner of persons
[45:37] ought to be in all holy conversation and
[45:39] godliness looking for the hasting unto
[45:42] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[45:45] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[45:47] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[45:49] heat. Nevertheless we according to the
[45:51] pro his promise look for a new heavens
[45:54] and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[45:56] righteousness. Wherefore, beloved,
[45:58] seeing that ye look for such things, be
[46:01] diligent that thee may be found of him
[46:03] in peace and without spot and blameless.
[46:06] May God add his blessings to the reading
[46:07] of the word. You can be seated. A that
[46:11] this really, really, really applies to
[46:15] you and to me.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] It really applies to you and to me. And
[46:23] I'm not talking about being here when
[46:25] the world burns.
[46:27] Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about wherefore, beloved,
[46:31] seeing that you look for such things.
[46:33] Amen. Because what are we looking for?
[46:35] Verse 13. Nevertheless, we according to
[46:37] his promise look for a new heavens and a
[46:40] new earth wherein dwelleth
[46:41] righteousness.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Why are we here tonight?
[46:46] Why do people listen tonight perhaps?
[46:50] Amen. It's because you've got faith.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. because you got
[46:56] faith. If you didn't have faith,
[46:59] you wouldn't probably not be here. You
[47:01] wouldn't listen.
[47:03] Because what is faith? Faith, brother
[47:05] Bam says, is a long range vision.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Faith looks to the
[47:13] future.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; It looks ahead,
[47:17] way ahead. If you don't have faith, then
[47:21] all you do is look right down here in
[47:23] front of us.
[47:25] It's like binoculars. Faith gives you
[47:27] binoculars to see what's way out there.
[47:30] But if you don't have faith, you're only
[47:32] paying attention to what's right in
[47:33] front of us.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You're only paying attention to your
[47:38] body's needs.
[47:40] Amen. Your physical needs, the things of
[47:42] the earth, the things of the world.
[47:44] That's what most people are concerned
[47:47] about. They're not concerned about going
[47:49] to church on Wednesday night. They're
[47:50] not concerned about uh church or
[47:53] anything because they're con too
[47:54] concerned with things right in front of
[47:56] them. They don't have a vision. They
[47:58] don't have faith. But faith inspires us.
[48:02] Faith causes us to look in the future.
[48:05] Faith causes us to come together and to
[48:08] prepare ourselves for something, to get
[48:10] ready for something. It's nothing like
[48:13] being ready for whatever you plan to do.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And it's terrible if you have to come to
[48:18] a place Amen.
[48:20] Amen. Perhaps. Amen. Uh, you know, you
[48:24] come to the end of the year and all of
[48:25] your taxes are due and you can't pay
[48:27] them and you're going to have to pay the
[48:29] January amount and it's going to be way
[48:32] bunch, you know, but it's nice when you
[48:35] come to the end there and and you've got
[48:37] things taken care of.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And how many know the end of this world
[48:42] is coming?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; People are going to have to pay for
[48:46] their sin. They're going to have to pay
[48:49] their dues. They can they can live in
[48:51] pleasure. They can enjoy the pleasures
[48:52] of of sin for a season, but guess what?
[48:55] They're going to have to eventually pay.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But how many's glad that we've got
[49:03] a prepaid going on?
[49:05] &gt;&gt; We have prepaid. We paid beforehand long
[49:09] before we ever come to judge. We already
[49:11] paid.
[49:12] That's why the uh judge is not going to
[49:15] ask, "Hey, you're going to have to pay."
[49:18] That's because he says, "You already
[49:19] paid." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; We're not worried about the fire.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Are you really not worried about the
[49:32] fire?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Are you really not worried about the
[49:35] fire?
[49:36] &gt;&gt; If you really ain't worried about the
[49:38] fire, you could be a happy person. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz how many know as I study this and as
[49:44] I bring this out and teach you just what
[49:46] kind of fire this is going to be, it's
[49:48] going to be fire beyond your
[49:50] comprehension. It's going to be hotter
[49:52] than you can ever imagine.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; How many knows we're living real close
[50:00] to the day of that fire?
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] Let me just warn you ahead of time. This
[50:09] is a Sunday morning service on a
[50:10] Wednesday night and I don't want to go
[50:12] too long, but I want to try to get out
[50:15] what the Lord wants out. Is that okay?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[50:25] Malachi 4 says, "Behold, the day
[50:28] cometh." How many believe that he was
[50:30] going to send you Elijah to before the
[50:31] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[50:33] the Lord? How many knows that Elijah has
[50:35] already come and gone for over 550 years
[50:38] almost? It's come and it's God.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, the day cometh that shall
[50:46] burn as a oven. This is what I call the
[50:50] then.
[50:51] Amen. There's the now and then there's
[50:54] the then.
[50:57] You can pay now or you can pay then.
[51:02] You choose now where you're going to
[51:04] spend your eternal destination.
[51:08] Amen.
[51:10] People never don't worry about the then.
[51:13] We do.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Sure we do.
[51:18] And the now the now
[51:21] determines
[51:23] where you're going to be then.
[51:27] And we want to look in the past and see
[51:30] others who wish they could come from
[51:32] where they are.
[51:34] Amen. Have another now experience now
[51:38] and then. They would love to come back
[51:41] and have an experience of being able to
[51:43] have another chance.
[51:46] Amen. But their now is past.
[51:49] So now let me finish this. And all the
[51:51] proud that shall burn as an oven. All
[51:53] the proud, and all that do wickedly
[51:56] shall be stubble, and the day that
[51:58] cometh shall burn them up, sayaeth the
[52:01] Lord of hosts, and it shall leave them
[52:04] neither root nor branch.
[52:10] Amen. So, we see there's a fire coming,
[52:13] ain't it, right? Let me uh just kind of
[52:16] lay a little I like the way that brother
[52:19] Brandham said it, so I'm going to let
[52:21] him say it to us. that. Okay,
[52:24] I want you to go with me a little piece.
[52:26] Some of you people go back. Some of you
[52:29] elderly people sitting here up to 40
[52:32] years old.
[52:35] Pass back with me for the next 20ish
[52:37] years back. And look how fast that
[52:40] progress has come. How much faster
[52:43] things are developing in the last 20
[52:45] years than it did in the previous 20
[52:47] years. Watch how much faster them 20
[52:50] years did the second block of 20 than it
[52:54] did with the third block of 20. Amen.
[52:58] And did you know only about 150 years
[53:01] ago or less time that man was just
[53:04] almost as primitive as it was in the
[53:07] beginning 2,000 years ago.
[53:10] How many knows that was true? Think
[53:12] about the 1800s and so forth, the Civil
[53:15] War with their with their uh muzzle
[53:19] loaders.
[53:21] Didn't that what they fought with?
[53:22] Muzzle loaders. I don't know about you,
[53:24] but they had bullets flying at them and
[53:26] they had to get the stick out and pour
[53:28] the powder in and quickly get the book.
[53:30] Come on, get it in there.
[53:33] Here goes one. He didn't get his bullet
[53:35] in.
[53:38] It was terrible
[53:41] &gt;&gt; to have to reload. We would we laugh
[53:43] because we realize, hey man, that
[53:45] nowadays, can you imagine I want them
[53:47] gatling guns?
[53:49] You know how many know the Chinese one
[53:51] time I think brother Brian would know
[53:53] about it over in Korea and different
[53:54] places. They would China would send
[53:56] waves after wave of human. They thought
[53:58] that they could just absolutely
[54:00] overwhelm a smaller amount of people by
[54:03] just sending a bunch of humans. And
[54:04] Amen. If one died, he'd grab the other
[54:06] guy, grab the gun, and he'd go and and
[54:08] they couldn't do it. No matter how much
[54:11] they waved, them gatling guns and them
[54:13] machine guns just mowed them down like a
[54:15] bunch of grass.
[54:17] You can't just throw a bunch of humans.
[54:19] You got to be smarter than that.
[54:22] But that's what it's progressed.
[54:26] All right.
[54:29] All right. So he says just primitive
[54:32] 1800s just primitive way back
[54:37] you know what you can see some of them
[54:38] back then that they still had carry
[54:40] swords ain't that right carry swords can
[54:43] you imagine a day is Lord why my
[54:46] gracious I'm going to bring a sword to
[54:48] to me I'll tell you what I'm going to
[54:49] laugh I'm going to say if what in the
[54:50] world you bringing a gun to a gun I mean
[54:53] a knife to a gunfight for
[54:56] it'd be a joke wouldn't it better be
[54:59] real good and you better be very fast
[55:00] and very accurate and throwing a little
[55:01] blade or something cuz you know but how
[55:05] many think about it and brother Brandon
[55:07] brings a point out here that they were
[55:10] just as primitive as at the beginning
[55:12] 2,000 years ago did you notice how
[55:14] things are traveling so fast and I
[55:18] thought about today how many knows that
[55:19] right now things are moving so fast man
[55:22] it's just been you know just the other
[55:24] day and my phone will say hey you need
[55:26] to update you know you need to get an
[55:27] update another update that many changes
[55:30] and they got AI coming out and they got
[55:32] artificial intelligence and I don't I
[55:34] don't even know what hardly AI is
[55:37] but I think it's artificial intelligence
[55:39] right some kind of smart system that's
[55:44] supposed to do all kinds of crazy stuff
[55:45] and I don't even know what it is but
[55:47] it's un almost unimaginable the things
[55:50] that they're coming up with
[55:53] but at the same time the Bible said they
[55:55] would get smarter they get wiser but
[55:57] they'd get weaker their morality is
[56:00] gone.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Sin is on the rampage.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; And just in a hundred years, and I'll
[56:07] just I'll I'll read this here. He says
[56:09] in the He's that here's the way time
[56:12] started at the first 6,000 years of
[56:14] life, we moved on like this, and we've
[56:16] never changed a bit until we come up now
[56:18] to the last hundred years, and we're
[56:21] just speeding like that. We got the same
[56:24] man with the same mental faculties.
[56:27] Every scientific thing that ever was on
[56:29] the earth was back there was back there.
[56:32] The same things they're making use of
[56:34] today.
[56:36] The same man with the same brain. He had
[56:39] the same brain that he's got now. But
[56:41] all at once something happened, didn't
[56:43] it?
[56:45] Oh, how we could say that this world,
[56:47] how can this world stand much longer?
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It reminds me of brother Baptist.
[56:54] He says, "Even wars have come to an end.
[56:56] You can't have war.
[56:59] Do you realize how easily Putin could
[57:02] end that war in Ukraine?
[57:05] He could end it in one day with his
[57:08] nukes,
[57:10] but he knows not to do that. Only God is
[57:13] keeping him from it. Ain't that right?
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Sure. Because as far as I know, Ukraine
[57:18] don't have any. If they do, boy, here we
[57:21] go. Right. But he's at wars at an end.
[57:24] National uh governments are at
[57:26] democracy's at an end. How many
[57:28] everything is at an end?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; We've come down to the end people.
[57:35] Morality is at an end. Look at just the
[57:37] last few month a week years.
[57:42] And it really sped up when our Supreme
[57:44] Court judge, you know, about marriage,
[57:46] you know, being between man and man if
[57:48] it wants to be from there. It just went
[57:50] worse.
[57:53] Amen. And we could talk about how
[57:54] schools used to be and and the
[57:56] punishment kids would get and this that
[57:58] or the other. And look at them now. Look
[57:59] what they're doing now. Going in there
[58:01] and shooting each other up. Killing a
[58:04] bunch of kids. Killing their teacher.
[58:10] It's terrible, isn't it? The morality is
[58:14] gone. I didn't get all the quotes, but
[58:16] you know how brother Bam says national
[58:18] life is at an end. Marriage is at an
[58:21] end. divorce, one out of two out of
[58:23] three or I don't know what it is
[58:24] anymore. It's very hard to keep a
[58:26] marriage together nowadays.
[58:35] Marriage is at an end.
[58:38] The world's at an end. We're at the end.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And it's come to it. talk about they've
[58:44] got enough power now when they come up
[58:47] with the nuclear and everything, you
[58:48] know, enough power to burn it over many,
[58:50] many times over. Brother Bam says, you
[58:53] can't really even have a war without
[58:56] risking a nuclear war. And look at how
[59:00] Putin's threatening. Ain't that right?
[59:02] Threaten, threaten, threaten.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; He can't do it until I I'm gone.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; What did I say? He can't do it till
[59:14] Yeah. I wanted you to say I'm cuz I want
[59:16] you to be gone, too.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Can't do it till I'm gone.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; How many's glad to be a Christian?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; How many glad to have the Holy Ghost?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; How many's glad that when all the other
[59:31] kingdoms come to an end, your kingdom
[59:34] has just started?
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Bible says this kingdom or his kingdom
[59:39] that shall never be no end.
[59:41] Russia, America, North Korea, all of
[59:44] them, they'll come to an end, but your
[59:46] kingdom will never come to an end. And
[59:49] that's worth shouting about.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; I receive the kingdom that cannot be
[59:55] shaken. Everything that can be shaken
[59:57] will be shaken.
[1:00:00] I hope you're so grounded until you
[1:00:02] can't be shook.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing can shake you. Why? Because the
[1:00:07] kingdom inside of you is God's kingdom.
[1:00:11] It can't be shaken. Trials can't shake
[1:00:14] it. Hardships can't shake it. Ain't
[1:00:16] nothing can shake it. Tribulation can't
[1:00:19] shake it.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Thing wants to hurt a
[1:00:30] little bit. Must be getting old.
[1:00:34] The old ticker wants to hurt. I'm going
[1:00:36] to have to calm down.
[1:00:40] Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice he talks about this.
[1:00:49] All of a sudden something happened. We
[1:00:52] can never the world can never survive an
[1:00:54] atomic war. It can never survive a
[1:00:57] hydrogen bomb war. He says they talk
[1:01:00] about if you if they if one explodes, if
[1:01:03] one goes up and gets on that radar,
[1:01:04] guess what? The chain causes a chain
[1:01:06] reaction and it'll go into it. One will
[1:01:09] break here and one there. Amen. Then
[1:01:11] those chains of relay will get together
[1:01:13] and what will happen? The war will
[1:01:15] start. He says the other day, I heard on
[1:01:17] the radio the biggest scientists in the
[1:01:20] world give the world 10 years to total
[1:01:22] annihilation.
[1:01:24] Imagine that. Back then they thought it
[1:01:27] was 10 years.
[1:01:33] I want you to think about right now
[1:01:36] and the very possibility that within the
[1:01:39] next 10 years we'll be there.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; For one thing, that generation of
[1:01:45] Israel, they're getting old, so it can't
[1:01:47] be all that much longer. It's getting
[1:01:50] close.
[1:01:52] It's getting close.
[1:01:54] And guess what? How many is concerned
[1:01:57] this morning or this evening about the
[1:01:59] then?
[1:02:01] Where will you be then?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:10] Total annihilation. That's not
[1:02:12] scripturally speaking. That's
[1:02:13] scientifically speaking. 10 years for
[1:02:16] total annihilation. And that wouldn't
[1:02:18] contradict the Bible. What the Bible
[1:02:20] said, the heavens and earth will be on
[1:02:21] fire. Just sweep over the deserts and
[1:02:23] everything. There'll be nothing left.
[1:02:26] Then he says, "And then where's your
[1:02:29] soul going to be at that time, men and
[1:02:32] women,
[1:02:34] 150, remember 500 years from tonight,
[1:02:37] your tombstone may blow over right here
[1:02:40] out in the desert somewhere, which is
[1:02:41] way out yonder."
[1:02:45] How many heard the howling winds today?
[1:02:48] That wind was howling, wasn't it?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Just the howling. Butter Bam says, you
[1:02:53] know, 500 years howling winds blowing
[1:02:56] against it, your tombstone there, but
[1:02:59] where's your soul? I mean, know better
[1:03:02] has a tombstone.
[1:03:05] Amen. After tribulation period, when
[1:03:07] that when that great fire comes, perhaps
[1:03:10] his will be tilted over,
[1:03:13] brother Brandham.
[1:03:17] Amen. Where will your soul be?
[1:03:21] Tonight is a soularching message.
[1:03:26] Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Soul prison. Now he says now the souls
[1:03:35] now in prison. He says souls that are
[1:03:38] now in prison. Now the soul of man is
[1:03:39] not the body of man. It's the soul.
[1:03:42] Amen. And he goes into detail. So that's
[1:03:45] what we're dealing with. How many knows
[1:03:46] that that's what we're looking at
[1:03:48] tonight
[1:03:50] is our soul. Not this body. This body
[1:03:55] will perish. But yet that one on the
[1:03:57] inside is created in the image of God.
[1:04:02] It's spirit being.
[1:04:08] And guess what? How many knows that when
[1:04:10] you die, you don't die.
[1:04:16] Well, let me clear that up for you. When
[1:04:18] your body dies, you don't die.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You are still somewhere. Yep. You're
[1:04:24] going to be awake. Yep. You're going to
[1:04:27] be conscious.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; You're going to be somewhere. That soul
[1:04:32] is going to be somewhere.
[1:04:39] And where that soul will be depends on
[1:04:42] what kind of choice you make now.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Where that soul will be then depends on
[1:04:49] what choice you make now.
[1:04:55] People don't realize the opportunity,
[1:04:59] the privilege that we have. How many
[1:05:03] believe we're a privileged people right
[1:05:04] now? You be go beyond that curtain of
[1:05:07] time. You go beyond this life and you're
[1:05:09] not so privileged anymore.
[1:05:15] Where will your soul howling winds
[1:05:16] blowing itself your tombstone? Where is
[1:05:18] your Where will your soul be?
[1:05:21] Now is the time to think about things.
[1:05:25] Amen. How many believes that?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the time to think about
[1:05:30] things.
[1:05:33] I know. And we know that at the time
[1:05:36] that the time of is near at hand,
[1:05:40] we see the world in a quivering, shaking
[1:05:44] condition, knowing that the atoms will
[1:05:46] soon be burning.
[1:05:49] Listen to this.
[1:05:53] Do you know that when they set off the
[1:05:56] first atom bomb, they were scared?
[1:06:00] because everything is made out of atoms
[1:06:03] and they were afraid it was going to
[1:06:06] burn the whole earth earth up. It's
[1:06:08] going to cause a chain reaction and it's
[1:06:10] going to burn everything up. So they
[1:06:12] kind of hesitated, you know, it's like
[1:06:14] doing something for the first time, you
[1:06:16] know, is what is it going to do?
[1:06:21] Listen to what the prophet says.
[1:06:24] See the heavens
[1:06:26] and uh will be on fire as the apostle
[1:06:29] Peter said it will burn with fervent
[1:06:31] heat. Brother Bam says the atoms of the
[1:06:35] earth will catch fire
[1:06:40] because remember one place he talks
[1:06:42] about that the heavens and the earth is
[1:06:44] going to be dissolved
[1:06:46] and then he talks about that these that
[1:06:49] there's going to be a nuclear there's
[1:06:52] going to be a a nuclear
[1:06:54] war. How many believes that he taught
[1:06:56] that that man destroys himself.
[1:07:01] So the way I'm seeing it this morning, I
[1:07:04] mean this evening is that these bombs
[1:07:06] will set it off.
[1:07:09] That's right. Burn with fervent heat.
[1:07:11] The atoms of the earth will catch fire.
[1:07:13] Then there will be a relay and there'll
[1:07:17] not even be dust left of the people.
[1:07:23] I was uh hunting the other day and I was
[1:07:25] up on top of a mountain. I could see
[1:07:26] about 20 miles or so and I thought,
[1:07:28] "Wow,
[1:07:30] God is fixing to change this whole
[1:07:32] thing."
[1:07:34] How many knows he's going to
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; the whole earth? It's hard to fathom,
[1:07:38] hard for us to imagine
[1:07:41] that not just the whole earth is going
[1:07:43] to be on fire, but the heavens will be
[1:07:45] on fire.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; How many know it's going to be hot?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] What are we saying tonight? We're saying
[1:07:57] the same thing. Preaching the same
[1:08:00] gospel. Preaching under the same
[1:08:02] anointing that Noah did when he said,
[1:08:04] "It's going to rain. It's going to rain
[1:08:06] for 120 years. Get ready. Prepare
[1:08:10] yourself."
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; How many believe that we got to prepare
[1:08:16] ourselves for what lays ahead?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; We have to make preparations. Amen.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Have you made preparations to go there?
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing else is going to matter. The
[1:08:30] things that we hold so dear
[1:08:33] aren't going to matter.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; How many believes we ought to focus on
[1:08:38] what matters.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] Praise the Lord. All right. Nothing.
[1:08:48] There won't even be dust left.
[1:08:51] And then what Lord again he says maybe
[1:08:56] at 500 years from now an old tombstone
[1:08:58] blow over yonder into howling winds
[1:09:01] burning blistering sun when it lays near
[1:09:04] the sun for its purification before the
[1:09:07] millennium. Maybe the name of some of
[1:09:09] the people here will be written on that.
[1:09:12] Where will their wondering soul be?
[1:09:17] May they not look to this modern world
[1:09:19] now, but they may look the way to
[1:09:21] Christ, listen to the message and to the
[1:09:24] messenger that's speaking to their
[1:09:26] hearts.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Again, down here, he says it
[1:09:33] says it another one in investments. He
[1:09:35] says, "May we invest our time, our
[1:09:38] talent."
[1:09:40] How many believes
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; when he preached on investments,
[1:09:44] he preached on that rich young ruler.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? When he had the
[1:09:50] opportunity, when the now time came, now
[1:09:53] is your day of salvation. How many
[1:09:55] believe that? Today you will hear his
[1:09:58] voice. Harden not your hearts as in the
[1:10:00] provocation.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's a message?
[1:10:04] That's God's gospel. But David said it
[1:10:07] all the way all the way back in uh
[1:10:10] Psalms. He says, "Oh, come let us
[1:10:12] worship and bow down. Let us kneel
[1:10:14] before the Lord our maker. For he is our
[1:10:16] God and we are the people of his
[1:10:18] pasture, the sheep of his hand." Today,
[1:10:21] if you will hear his voice, harden not
[1:10:24] your hearts.
[1:10:26] I'm going to go back through time and
[1:10:27] I'm going way back to Sodom and
[1:10:29] Gomorrah. We're going back to Noah, all
[1:10:30] the way back to the angels, all the way
[1:10:32] back, all these different places of
[1:10:34] history where people had their chance.
[1:10:37] They had their now and they made the
[1:10:38] wrong choice.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; But we humans, we just don't seem to
[1:10:43] learn. We don't seem from learn from our
[1:10:45] mom and dad's mistakes. We don't learn
[1:10:47] from other people's mistakes. We just go
[1:10:50] barreling on through our lives making
[1:10:53] the same ones. God help us.
[1:11:00] See today if you will hear his voice,
[1:11:02] harden not your hearts as in the
[1:11:04] provocation, as in the day of the
[1:11:06] temptation in the wilderness. How many
[1:11:09] know when Moses spoke, when God spoke,
[1:11:12] they hardened their hearts.
[1:11:15] They complained. They murmured. They
[1:11:17] would not believe.
[1:11:19] And you today, their souls are out there
[1:11:22] somewhere wishing they could just have
[1:11:24] another now time.
[1:11:27] How many knows Elvis Presley wishes he
[1:11:29] had another now time? Michael Jackson
[1:11:32] wishes he had another now time, a time
[1:11:34] to come back. That richer man, Amen,
[1:11:36] that lifted up his soul in hell. Oh, I
[1:11:38] said go warn my brother. How much he
[1:11:40] would have liked to had another chance.
[1:11:42] How many glad that we have a chance
[1:11:44] right now. Right now is your chance.
[1:11:47] World right now is your chance. Now you
[1:11:50] choose
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; where you're going to be then.
[1:11:59] Amen. Harden not your hearts. Don't make
[1:12:02] excuses.
[1:12:10] Give God your all.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] As in the temptation in the wilderness
[1:12:19] when your fathers tempted me, proved me
[1:12:21] saw my works. 40 years long was I
[1:12:24] grieved with this generation and said it
[1:12:27] is a people that do heir in their heart.
[1:12:30] Can we say that about this generation?
[1:12:32] This generation aired in their heart.
[1:12:40] Oh,
[1:12:47] the queen of the south shall rise up and
[1:12:49] condemn her generation
[1:12:52] because she came from the uttermost
[1:12:53] parts of the world to hear the wisdom
[1:12:56] and the discernment that Solomon had
[1:13:00] and a greater than Solomon was there.
[1:13:02] Those Pharisees didn't learn nothing.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say in this hour, God has
[1:13:08] come and the very same things and a
[1:13:10] hundred times more than he did when he
[1:13:12] was here on earth. But people still
[1:13:15] harden their hearts.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. They refuse. They in their hearts.
[1:13:28] They have not known my ways. They don't
[1:13:30] know God in simplicity. They don't know
[1:13:32] God in humility. guy don't know God
[1:13:35] might just use a hillbilly out of
[1:13:37] Kentucky.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; With his hints and totes and fetches,
[1:13:42] but when he come up here, he wasn't by
[1:13:44] himself. Amen. He had somebody here
[1:13:47] represented him. Amen. He said, "If he
[1:13:49] don't come, you don't got to believe
[1:13:50] what I say." But he'd be there. He was
[1:13:53] there every time.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The people go into the basement and say
[1:14:00] the sun's not shining when it is
[1:14:02] shining.
[1:14:03] Christ is here.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But they refuse to believe it. And
[1:14:07] they're going to end up in the same
[1:14:08] place that the angels that kept not
[1:14:11] their first estate. The same place
[1:14:13] Israel did. Jesus said they're everyone
[1:14:16] dead. That's lost, gone in the regions
[1:14:19] of the lost. Wish they wouldn't have
[1:14:20] been complainers and murmurss. Wish they
[1:14:23] had believed the power of God.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. unto whom I swear in my wrath,
[1:14:33] they shall not enter into my
[1:14:38] rest.
[1:14:40] Amen.
[1:14:49] Paul said the same thing in Hebrews 3
[1:14:51] verse 7. Wherefore the Holy Spirit saith
[1:14:54] today, if you hear his voice, harden not
[1:14:56] your hearts as in the provocation the
[1:14:57] day of temptation in the wilderness.
[1:15:00] Amen.
[1:15:02] Oh, Stephen, he comes to my mind right
[1:15:04] now. Stephen, how many knows? He says,
[1:15:06] "Oh, you stiff neck and hard of heart,
[1:15:09] you always resist the Holy Ghost."
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; They had such a hard heart until when he
[1:15:16] told them the truth, they got mad,
[1:15:19] nashed upon him with his their teeth,
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; took him out and stoned him.
[1:15:25] Wonder where they are today.
[1:15:29] How many cares about where you going to
[1:15:31] be tomorrow? Where you going to be in
[1:15:34] another 500 years?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Where will you be?
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you set your goals right and you
[1:15:41] set your heart right, you'll get your
[1:15:43] priorities right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; How many believes you got to keep your
[1:15:46] priorities right?
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a caught up in this
[1:15:51] lukewarm age. Get away from God.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, it ain't
[1:15:56] no time you get away from God.
[1:15:57] Depression sets in.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All kinds of things set in.
[1:16:05] Backslidness sets in.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Church isn't important anymore.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Wednesday nights ain't important
[1:16:17] anymore.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Our attendance dwindles.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Why? What's more important?
[1:16:26] Sure,
[1:16:28] if you got your ox in it, you
[1:16:29] understand?
[1:16:32] But the Bible says if you love the world
[1:16:34] or the things of the world, the love of
[1:16:37] God ain't in you.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; See, if you love the world and the
[1:16:42] things of the world more than you love
[1:16:44] God, your priorities are wrong.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Hello. How many knows it's important?
[1:16:54] Cuz when we get over there, we're going
[1:16:57] to we're glad that we've lived for
[1:16:59] Jesus.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I live for Jesus.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; It wasn't so bad on a dark Wednesday
[1:17:10] night to go, Amen. get in our car and go
[1:17:12] and worship the Lord.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I did it. I do it for Jesus. We
[1:17:18] do it for Jesus.
[1:17:22] Amen.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] See folks in Revelations 9 and verse 20
[1:17:35] it says, "And the rest of the men which
[1:17:37] were not killed by these plagues, yet
[1:17:39] they repented not of their works of
[1:17:41] their hands, that they should not
[1:17:43] worship devils or idols of gold or
[1:17:46] silver or brass or stone or wood, uh,
[1:17:49] which neither see nor here walk." How
[1:17:51] many know people will worship anything
[1:17:54] almost?
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you put in front of God is your
[1:17:58] idol. Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Pretty strong.
[1:18:02] You love him.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's look
[1:18:07] at this again. Brother Bam says, "To
[1:18:10] think of this world, Brother Bam had a
[1:18:12] picture of it."
[1:18:15] Amen. I'll never forget some of the
[1:18:18] loneliest
[1:18:20] loneliest times is to be in my bed in
[1:18:22] Amish house somewhere in the bed and the
[1:18:26] winter has set in.
[1:18:29] Amen. Brother Woody isn't here, but when
[1:18:32] we were taking his mom to the grave, as
[1:18:34] they were taking the casket from the
[1:18:36] road over to where they were going to
[1:18:38] bury her, the leaves, the wind came and
[1:18:40] just the leaves all come down. They were
[1:18:42] blowing down. I thought, "Yeah, that's
[1:18:44] right." How many knows in the fall of
[1:18:46] the year the leaves fall off
[1:18:49] the trees, you know, are the leaves
[1:18:52] represent old age, gray hair, losing
[1:18:57] strength.
[1:18:59] Amen. Losing their grip and just falling
[1:19:01] off. Amen. And she was falling off the
[1:19:05] earth, dropping down. Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Then the cold winter comes. Like I said,
[1:19:16] we'd have that wind ha howl and the wind
[1:19:18] would be blowing sideways snow and
[1:19:21] somehow or other. I don't know if I can
[1:19:22] imitate it or not, but it would kind of
[1:19:25] kind of sound like this.
[1:19:41] It was spooky.
[1:19:46] How many knows that's what we about hear
[1:19:48] out there? The cold winds
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; of sin and immorality blowing. It's
[1:19:53] scary.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; We're not at home here.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; We're looking for another place.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; We hear it howling. That's right. The
[1:20:08] winds howling blow across this world
[1:20:10] when it's blowed up with an atomic bomb
[1:20:13] laying out yonder in the sphere of the
[1:20:16] sun. Howling winds blowing across it.
[1:20:19] 150 or 500 years from that tonight.
[1:20:22] There'll be tombstone hitting that sign
[1:20:24] with maybe our names on them. Laying
[1:20:26] yonder whirling in a howling the winds
[1:20:29] the hot won't be cold but it'll be hot
[1:20:32] blistering heat from the sun. But where
[1:20:35] will your poor soul be?
[1:20:40] I had one more
[1:20:42] that I Let me see here. I had one more I
[1:20:46] wanted to read.
[1:20:52] Amen.
[1:20:55] I can't find it just now.
[1:20:58] Nope.
[1:21:01] Where will your soul be? Praise the
[1:21:04] Lord.
[1:21:06] Now,
[1:21:08] let's go back a little bit and think
[1:21:09] about this.
[1:21:13] Here it is. right here. I never finished
[1:21:16] the quote. Maybe when our tombstones
[1:21:19] will be floated up in the sands, when
[1:21:22] the howling winds are going, when this
[1:21:24] world, now notice, when this world is
[1:21:28] swept into the sun yonder, thrown out
[1:21:35] like it was at the end of the
[1:21:37] destruction. Instead of it being thrown
[1:21:40] from the sun,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; it'll be into the sun.
[1:21:48] Can you imagine? Brother Brand is paint
[1:21:51] painting a picture here that it'll be
[1:21:52] closer to the sun. Take it right up
[1:21:54] there close to the sun or whichever way
[1:21:56] it'll be. And you can imagine how hot
[1:21:59] it'll be. You talk about sweating 110
[1:22:02] degrees. You get a little closer. You
[1:22:05] bring that thing closer,
[1:22:08] it will be very, very hot. Amen. No more
[1:22:13] water but fire this time. Amen. And the
[1:22:17] sands howl across the earth before the
[1:22:20] great millennium.
[1:22:22] Amen. And our tombstones come up. Dr. So
[1:22:25] and so, Bishop So and So, what good did
[1:22:28] it do when our souls are yonder
[1:22:30] somewhere in eternity?
[1:22:35] Amen.
[1:22:37] Somewhere
[1:22:38] in eternity.
[1:22:42] How many knows that all those lost souls
[1:22:45] are somewhere out there in eternity?
[1:22:54] That's right.
[1:22:57] Menite preacher made a statement.
[1:23:00] He says we when he was preaching the
[1:23:03] funeral to make something we just we
[1:23:04] haven't figured life out yet
[1:23:07] and we don't really know what's over
[1:23:08] there on the other side because we
[1:23:10] haven't went there.
[1:23:13] I thought
[1:23:16] I'm glad that we know a little bit about
[1:23:18] life
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and I'm glad what we know what life's
[1:23:22] all about
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; and I'm glad that we had somebody
[1:23:25] because brother Brandon when he went to
[1:23:26] souls and preached the souls in prison
[1:23:28] maybe we'll get have time to read it yet
[1:23:30] but he said I've been in both places and
[1:23:32] he described what it was like going down
[1:23:34] in the regions of the lost and where
[1:23:36] they are
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; how horrible it will be how horrible it
[1:23:41] would be how horrible it is
[1:23:45] amen.
[1:23:48] And listen to what he says.
[1:23:53] How many knows those souls
[1:23:56] that did not choose God, did not choose
[1:23:59] their message for their they
[1:24:03] are in the same place were in prison.
[1:24:08] Brother Brandon when he preached to
[1:24:09] souls in prison now you can listen to it
[1:24:12] but he talks about Jesus having had a
[1:24:14] three pulls and the third pull was
[1:24:16] actually going and preaching to the
[1:24:18] souls that were in prison.
[1:24:21] This is where I was fixing to go to into
[1:24:23] my scriptures in first Peter
[1:24:27] second Peter 2. We'll lay a foundation
[1:24:30] before we read brother Bam's message
[1:24:32] here. He says, "For if God spared not
[1:24:35] the angels that sinned, but cast them
[1:24:38] down to hell and delivered them into
[1:24:40] chains of darkness to be reserved unto
[1:24:44] judgment."
[1:24:46] Amen. How many knows? That's right.
[1:24:48] They're in chains of darkness. Reserved
[1:24:50] unto judgment. And he spared not the old
[1:24:53] world, but saved Noah, the eighth
[1:24:55] person, a preacher of righteousness,
[1:24:57] bringing in the flood upon the world of
[1:24:59] the ungodly. Amen. There he's talking
[1:25:02] about Noah's day, Noah's group,
[1:25:06] that whole world.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:25:15] Don't you just wish that you could get
[1:25:17] people to believe?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Get people to believe that God destroyed
[1:25:22] them. Everyone but eight. Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy everybody that is
[1:25:28] not in Christ in our generation.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; The fire's coming.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; The judgment's going to fall. But this
[1:25:36] is your chance. This is your hour.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; This is your now. Today is the day of
[1:25:43] salvation.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Today, God is speaking. Today, God
[1:25:48] reaches out his hand. Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Even better said, you know, even Jesus
[1:25:52] said, he says, you know, he held his
[1:25:54] hand up, but they would not
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; to Israel, he held his hand up, but they
[1:26:00] would not.
[1:26:02] Proverbs, I think in the second chapter,
[1:26:03] he says, "When your calamity cometh upon
[1:26:05] you in your desolation, your
[1:26:06] destruction,
[1:26:08] when I reached out my hand, you laughed.
[1:26:10] You made fun. You laughed."
[1:26:13] He says, "But when your calamity comes,
[1:26:14] I will laugh. I will laugh at your
[1:26:17] calamity.
[1:26:19] Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Your desolation comes.
[1:26:26] You think
[1:26:29] Hollywood actors I read I heard seen
[1:26:31] something in the news the other day
[1:26:33] where some of them uh you know they die
[1:26:35] terribly.
[1:26:37] Those movie stars those rich people
[1:26:38] Elvis died terribly. His wife left him.
[1:26:41] He was with another woman on drugs.
[1:26:44] Couldn't get off the drugs. got fat and
[1:26:46] got finally fell over off the commode, I
[1:26:48] guess. Died alone there in a terrible
[1:26:51] way.
[1:26:54] How about Michael Jackson and all that?
[1:26:55] Think about it. What they would do
[1:27:00] to have a church service on a Wednesday
[1:27:02] night
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; to have the preacher say, "Why don't you
[1:27:05] come and accept the Lord?" I wouldn't
[1:27:08] doubt, but they'd come up.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Sure. But guess what? They had the
[1:27:13] chance, right? They made their choice
[1:27:18] just like we make our choice of how
[1:27:21] we're going to live our lives. Is it
[1:27:22] going to be for Christ or is it going to
[1:27:24] be for ourselves?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus said, "If you follow me,"
[1:27:28] Amen. You got to be willing to forsake
[1:27:30] all to follow me.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And if you get over there and you're
[1:27:38] over there, you're going to be glad that
[1:27:40] you for was willing to forsake all to
[1:27:42] follow Christ. Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; He spared not the old world.
[1:27:53] Amen. Brought the flood in upon the
[1:27:54] ungodly, turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:27:56] Gomorrah into ashes and condemned them
[1:27:59] with an overflow, making them an example
[1:28:02] of those unto those that should
[1:28:04] afterward live ungodly.
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:14] Even Sodom and Gomorrah. How many know
[1:28:18] they were given a chance? Two angels
[1:28:19] went down there.
[1:28:22] How many believes that that brother Bam
[1:28:24] typed that with the age you and I are
[1:28:25] living?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Billy Graham, all Roberts preached a
[1:28:29] Pentecostal, preached to the Baptist,
[1:28:30] the Method, all of those. And they
[1:28:32] wearied themselves to find a door.
[1:28:36] They couldn't find a door.
[1:28:39] But brother Bam says there was another
[1:28:41] angel. The angel of the Lord was with
[1:28:43] Abraham up there discerning Sarah's
[1:28:46] thoughts and intents of her heart.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; We were not on in Sodom. And when the
[1:28:51] world is falling apart, aren't you glad
[1:28:53] that your life is not falling apart?
[1:28:56] Your world's not falling apart. Your
[1:28:59] family doesn't have to fall apart. No.
[1:29:02] God is restoring us. In the middle of
[1:29:04] everything else falling apart, there's a
[1:29:06] restoration that takes place.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you need to be restored, God
[1:29:12] wants to restore you. Maybe the joy of
[1:29:14] your salvation,
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; maybe your first love,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; God is in the restoring business.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; He's going to have a bride without spot
[1:29:25] and without wrinkle.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; How many believes? And he's going to do
[1:29:29] it by the messenger that he send, the
[1:29:31] message that he send. Come out of her,
[1:29:34] my people.
[1:29:36] Amen. Have we got any of my people here
[1:29:38] tonight?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm some of them my people
[1:29:41] that you receive take not for take not
[1:29:43] of her sins that you receive not of
[1:29:45] plagues.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Woo. I don't know about that. I just
[1:29:50] love that little story of that wagon
[1:29:52] train going out west. Amen. And that
[1:29:54] little boy said to his sister, "Don't
[1:29:56] you worry, sis. We're standing where the
[1:29:58] fire has already been."
[1:30:01] How many believe that we've made
[1:30:02] reservations? We already have been
[1:30:05] through the fire. Amen. We're going to
[1:30:07] get some prepay here. We're praying here
[1:30:09] and say, "God, forgive me." We're
[1:30:11] repenting and getting it bleached in the
[1:30:13] blood of Jesus Christ. Washed in the
[1:30:16] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:23] That's right.
[1:30:26] Praise the Lord. How many knows when
[1:30:29] Moses spoke that was the time for them?
[1:30:32] When Jesus spoke that was the time for
[1:30:35] them. He said unless you believe that I
[1:30:38] am he you will die in your sins.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; They could not believe that who he was
[1:30:43] you are going to die in your sins.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:31:00] Jude says it this way. I will therefore
[1:31:03] put you in remembrance, though ye once
[1:31:05] knew this. I that the Lord having saved
[1:31:08] the people out of the land of Egypt
[1:31:09] afterwards destroyed them that believed
[1:31:13] not.
[1:31:14] and the angels which kept not their
[1:31:16] first estate but left their own
[1:31:17] habitation he had reserved in
[1:31:19] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[1:31:22] the judgment of the great day. Then he
[1:31:25] mentions again Jude does Sodom and
[1:31:26] Gomorrah and the cities like man are
[1:31:28] giving them over to fornication and
[1:31:30] going after strange flesh are set forth
[1:31:33] for an example suffering the vengeance
[1:31:35] of eternal fire. But notice he says,
[1:31:37] "The angels which kept not their estate,
[1:31:39] they have reserved an everlasting chains
[1:31:43] of darkness."
[1:31:47] Brother Brandon when he was describing
[1:31:49] his vision when he was shot, his buddy
[1:31:52] shot him when he was uh accidentally
[1:31:54] when they were hunting and he was almost
[1:31:58] dead.
[1:32:01] Doctor wanted to cut his both legs off
[1:32:04] right at the waist.
[1:32:07] He says, "Don't do that. Just cut me on
[1:32:09] off off of here." Brother Brand told the
[1:32:11] doctor. In other words, finish him off.
[1:32:15] Brother Brandon was a sinner cuz he's so
[1:32:18] shot up, meat hanging everywhere. It was
[1:32:20] so terrible. Isn't it something that God
[1:32:23] would allow his servant to go through
[1:32:25] something like that?
[1:32:27] Then sometimes we wonder, well, why God
[1:32:29] lets things happen to us? Look what he
[1:32:32] allowed to happen to him.
[1:32:36] How many knows brother Bannon couldn't
[1:32:38] die?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Not even when he tried to shoot himself.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; No. So whenever those he said it was a
[1:32:46] shotgun shot in his legs, shot both of
[1:32:48] his legs. You can only imagine God
[1:32:51] allowing it but yet not allowing it to
[1:32:54] hit certain arteries that would have
[1:32:55] bled him out. Hello.
[1:32:59] He spared him and he said the doctor
[1:33:02] decided to operate on him and everything
[1:33:04] and he said I got great legs today. G
[1:33:06] brother Rand said great leg.
[1:33:09] That's God for you. How many believe
[1:33:11] God?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; How many glad God takes care of you?
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; God. Aren't we glad tonight that we've
[1:33:17] got a God that cares about us? He
[1:33:19] watches out for us. He protects us.
[1:33:23] He started a good work in his brother
[1:33:25] Brad and he's going to finish it. He
[1:33:28] started this.
[1:33:31] My
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get away from God. I hope God
[1:33:38] makes you so miserable that you just
[1:33:42] can't stand it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And you flee to the horns of the altar
[1:33:46] and say, "God, forgive me. I can't take
[1:33:48] this no more. I want to be right with
[1:33:49] you."
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That'll be a good sign that you're of
[1:33:52] God.
[1:33:54] But you keep barreling right on down the
[1:33:57] wrong road and you ignore that little
[1:33:59] clusk, that still small voice in your
[1:34:01] heart.
[1:34:03] God have mercy on your soul. If that's
[1:34:06] that little voice drowns out and it
[1:34:08] doesn't talk to you anymore,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I hate where you end up at.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; A terrible place. You thank God for that
[1:34:19] still small voice. Yeah.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; How many tonight,
[1:34:24] how many tonight can say honestly, don't
[1:34:27] raise your hand if it ain't true, but
[1:34:30] that still small voice is getting louder
[1:34:33] and louder in your heart.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four,
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; five,
[1:34:43] six.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:34:48] It is in mine.
[1:34:51] I'm thankful for it
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; because guess what? We're close, folks.
[1:34:57] I mean, as your pastor, I tell you,
[1:34:58] we're close
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; and we need to search our hearts. You
[1:35:03] need to search your heart to see if
[1:35:04] you've got everything ready.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Could happen any time.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bam says, "I was so weak.
[1:35:16] The vision struck me. I was so weak. I'd
[1:35:18] lost all that blood. I thought I was
[1:35:21] sinking into an endless eternity. Many
[1:35:23] of you has heard me say that before.
[1:35:26] Sinking into an endless eternity.
[1:35:31] He says, "And the first thing I was
[1:35:33] going like through clouds and then
[1:35:34] through darkness, sinking down, down,
[1:35:36] down, and the first thing you know, I
[1:35:37] got into the regions of the lost. I
[1:35:39] screamed and I looked and there was just
[1:35:43] everything. There was no foundation to
[1:35:45] it. I could never stop falling.
[1:35:49] You know, I I I I thought that I think
[1:35:51] in my own self I says, you know, there's
[1:35:54] nothing there. There's no floor for you
[1:35:56] to walk around on.
[1:35:59] It's a bottomless pit. Endless eternity.
[1:36:02] Brother Bapt says he was fallen and
[1:36:04] fallen and fallen. What a horrible
[1:36:07] feeling.
[1:36:10] Falling for an eternity. It looked like
[1:36:12] I was going to fall and there was no
[1:36:15] stopping nowhere. Amen.
[1:36:22] My
[1:36:24] and he says it this way and oh
[1:36:27] he says I saw the vision of both sides
[1:36:29] by the grace of God. I don't say that's
[1:36:31] sacriiggious and if it's wrong God
[1:36:34] forgive forgive me. I believe I've seen
[1:36:36] both places. I've been in both places. I
[1:36:39] don't know about you, but I really
[1:36:41] appreciate that God allowed brother
[1:36:43] Brandham to go beyond the regions of the
[1:36:45] blessed so that you and I in our mind
[1:36:49] have comfort about knowing where you're
[1:36:51] going.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; How many knows that's a big comfort? Not
[1:36:55] all churches, not all people can say
[1:36:56] that. We really don't know what's over
[1:36:58] there. We know that about 20 feet up in
[1:37:02] the air are all the redeemed of this age
[1:37:05] and they're happy. there in the splendor
[1:37:07] of their youth. They're as bright as
[1:37:09] they ever were. How many believe that?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm thankful.
[1:37:16] And we know that going the other way is
[1:37:20] terrible.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible place over there.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, notice
[1:37:29] I've seen the red.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I've seen the lost and where they were
[1:37:32] at. That's why I stand as your brother
[1:37:35] today to warn you to flee from that
[1:37:37] downward path. Don't you never go down
[1:37:40] that road.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; You've got everything to live for that
[1:37:43] blessed upward way where the redeemed
[1:37:45] are in joy and peace. They can't sin.
[1:37:48] They can't be sorry. Almighty, they're
[1:37:50] perfect. I've seen both places. He says,
[1:37:53] I realize that's an awful statement to
[1:37:55] for a person to make, but God is my
[1:37:57] judge. I solemnly believed I've seen
[1:37:59] both places.
[1:38:01] Hello. There's a lot of people out there
[1:38:03] on YouTube and have seen a lot of
[1:38:05] different bunch of stuff.
[1:38:08] It might be and it might not be, but
[1:38:10] I'll stick to this right here.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, far be it from any person.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; If you are standing with hot wires bored
[1:38:20] through you, tormented every day, it not
[1:38:22] be that like that devil torment that
[1:38:25] that is in that place. There could be
[1:38:27] nothing. No human mind. The human mind
[1:38:30] couldn't comprehend what that regions of
[1:38:33] the lost is. There's no way to explain
[1:38:35] it. There's no way to explain what the
[1:38:37] regions of the blessed is. Amen. One is
[1:38:40] so horrible and the other is so great.
[1:38:43] So if anybody hears me, I'm getting to
[1:38:46] be an old man.
[1:38:48] I'm
[1:38:51] seven, eight years older than brother
[1:38:53] Brandon was.
[1:38:55] I'm getting to be an old man. I don't
[1:38:57] know how much longer I've got. Brother
[1:38:58] Bam says, I'll soon be 55 years old. I
[1:39:02] don't know. He says, but don't you never
[1:39:05] go down that to the regions of the lost.
[1:39:08] You can't picture hell being that bad.
[1:39:10] Whatever you do,
[1:39:13] oh my, don't you forget this that the
[1:39:16] regions of the blessed. I would say like
[1:39:17] St. Paul did, eye has not ear seen and
[1:39:20] ear has not heard how great it is over
[1:39:23] there. So listen to what brother Bram
[1:39:25] says.
[1:39:27] Stop. So stop. If you're listening to
[1:39:30] the tape, let me say this. If you're
[1:39:32] listening to my voice tonight,
[1:39:35] Amen. If you're listening, turn the
[1:39:36] machine off and repent.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; If you're not saved, get right with God.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That's my message for Evening Light
[1:39:46] Tabernacle. And anybody listening, get
[1:39:49] right with God.
[1:39:57] This is your chime. This is God's voice
[1:40:00] telling you, "Now is your time to decide
[1:40:04] where you're going to be in a little
[1:40:06] bit."
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Or then
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; the angels, look where they are. Noah's
[1:40:12] group, look where they are. Look where
[1:40:13] the Sodom and Gomorrah are. Look where
[1:40:16] the Pharisees are. Look at where all
[1:40:18] those people are in the regions of the
[1:40:20] lost.
[1:40:23] Hello.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; But hallelujah. How many's glad there's
[1:40:28] another region? It's a region of the
[1:40:31] blessed
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; the blessed.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Joy unspeakable,
[1:40:41] full of glory. But he says, "Turn it
[1:40:43] off. Get saved." In other words, push
[1:40:46] stop. Butterb says, "Get right now.
[1:40:50] Don't wait.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I am saying this by firsthand
[1:40:58] experience. Amen.
[1:41:02] That I've been there making that
[1:41:04] statement that I have been in both
[1:41:06] places.
[1:41:09] How many knows that Jesus final ministry
[1:41:13] after he died that his soul went to hell
[1:41:18] and preached
[1:41:20] to all of these that were in prison.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; The scripture says it. He went and
[1:41:26] preached to the souls that were in
[1:41:28] prison.
[1:41:30] Can you imagine
[1:41:32] that? Could not be saved. Brother man
[1:41:34] said
[1:41:36] couldn't be saved
[1:41:44] after Jesus had clearly came identified
[1:41:47] himself and prophesied that after the
[1:41:50] days of his prophecy through those
[1:41:52] spiritually scripturally identified the
[1:41:55] people rejected him. That's right. And
[1:41:58] he preached then after they rejected him
[1:42:00] here the ones that had a possibility to
[1:42:03] be saved. Remember when he was preaching
[1:42:05] there was a possibility for anyone to be
[1:42:09] saved. How many believe that's the
[1:42:10] truth?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; When the preaching's going forth there's
[1:42:14] a possibility
[1:42:16] for people to be saved.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] We don't know who they are. They're
[1:42:25] predestinated.
[1:42:26] But after the days of his preaching, his
[1:42:28] ministry continued on cuz the last group
[1:42:31] that he preached to was the souls that
[1:42:34] were in hell that could not be forgiven.
[1:42:39] Amen. Now, in this same message, Brother
[1:42:41] Bam says, "Don't believe that there's a
[1:42:42] burning hell right now because God
[1:42:45] doesn't
[1:42:47] actually judge. He does not punish
[1:42:50] somebody before first judging them.
[1:42:52] It'll be till after the judgment. But
[1:42:55] this hell, these regions of the loss.
[1:42:58] But Abraham said it's worse. It's worse
[1:43:00] than a burning hell
[1:43:02] to know that you're lost.
[1:43:05] Just that feeling just, oh, it's a
[1:43:07] terrible place. Amen.
[1:43:11] And I didn't stop finish my thought here
[1:43:13] after in a little while because remember
[1:43:16] I said that we were made in the image of
[1:43:17] God. And when our body dies, our soul
[1:43:21] does not die. It's still alive out there
[1:43:23] somewhere. How many knows where your
[1:43:25] soul dies?
[1:43:28] Jesus said, "Don't fear him that can
[1:43:30] destroy your body, but fear him that can
[1:43:33] boy both destroy your body and your soul
[1:43:35] in hell." Amen. The lake of fire
[1:43:38] according to Revelations 21 there, the
[1:43:41] lake of fire. This is the lake of fire.
[1:43:43] That is the second death. That's where
[1:43:45] your soul becomes annihilated.
[1:43:50] It'll take some kind of fire, some kind
[1:43:52] of some kind of horrible thing to think
[1:43:55] that you slowly your soul will slowly
[1:43:57] die and become extinct,
[1:44:02] annihilated,
[1:44:04] never to be. How many knows Jesus came
[1:44:07] to give his life and to give it to us
[1:44:09] more abundantly?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; How many wants more abundant life?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to live my life to the
[1:44:15] fullest. And the only way that you can
[1:44:17] do that is to be surrendered to Jesus
[1:44:18] Christ, have your sins under the blood,
[1:44:20] to be right with God, to put him first
[1:44:24] daily. Die to yourself daily.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; How many believes it's a daily dying?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because it's so easy to
[1:44:33] backslide and get away from God. You
[1:44:35] must die to yourself daily. You must
[1:44:37] love him with all your heart, mind,
[1:44:38] soul, and strength. Above your job,
[1:44:40] above everything else, you've got to
[1:44:42] love him more than anything.
[1:44:44] family, even children, wives, anything,
[1:44:47] land, no matter.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So, he went and preached they
[1:44:55] That's right. He went to pre to preach
[1:44:57] to those that could not be forgiven. If
[1:44:59] you'll listen to brother Bram's message,
[1:45:01] he believed that this message here would
[1:45:03] also do the same thing. And when he
[1:45:07] preached this message and brought all
[1:45:08] these things out and he made an altar
[1:45:10] call, he says, "You should see the altar
[1:45:12] now. People just flocked to the altar.
[1:45:15] The altars were full. Everybody crying
[1:45:17] out, "God, don't let it be too late."
[1:45:19] Because he said, "If that ministry
[1:45:21] preach to the total lost, this ministry
[1:45:23] will preach to the total lost if it's
[1:45:25] going to be parallel."
[1:45:28] And brother Brandham uses a scripture
[1:45:30] that I want to close with
[1:45:33] and it's in Hebrews,
[1:45:36] Hebrews 3. It says, "For it is
[1:45:38] impossible for those who were once
[1:45:39] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:45:41] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:45:43] the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the
[1:45:46] good word of God and the powers that are
[1:45:48] to come, if they should fall away to
[1:45:50] renew themselves again to repentance,
[1:45:52] seeing they crucified themselves the son
[1:45:54] of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:45:56] shame." So it is impossible.
[1:46:00] All right. But Abraham says, "Remember
[1:46:02] in Hebrews 6th chapter was the ones he
[1:46:05] made known the truth and they refused to
[1:46:07] walk in it. There's no repentance, no
[1:46:10] more repentance for them." When the
[1:46:13] truth is presented to a person for the
[1:46:15] last time and they refuse to receive it
[1:46:18] according to Hebrews, there's not even
[1:46:20] nothing in the world that can ever save
[1:46:22] them.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; They're finished.
[1:46:26] No repentance, no redemption. There's
[1:46:28] nothing left for them. They're eternally
[1:46:30] separated.
[1:46:32] Amen. Looking for a fearful fire and
[1:46:35] indignation which shall devour the
[1:46:36] adversary.
[1:46:38] Amen. Listen to this. You talk about
[1:46:41] people walking away from the message.
[1:46:43] And when the truth of God's gospel has
[1:46:46] been proven, thoroughly a vindicated,
[1:46:50] and then turn around and walk away from
[1:46:52] it, they're finished.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; They're finished.
[1:47:00] That's all. It's awful, but I have to
[1:47:02] tell it.
[1:47:05] Remember, even the angels that kept not
[1:47:07] their first estate, but left their
[1:47:08] habitation, they are in prison. A house,
[1:47:11] prison house of darkness. It's where the
[1:47:14] world is walking today in that same
[1:47:17] prison. And there's no repentance.
[1:47:21] See, brother Bam, he was a messenger of
[1:47:23] God. And he's seen how people would walk
[1:47:26] out and walk out and walk out. When God
[1:47:28] determines that those people walked out
[1:47:30] for the last time,
[1:47:33] they can come to a service
[1:47:37] and hear the message preached.
[1:47:40] But it'll be a message being preached to
[1:47:43] the total lost.
[1:47:48] Let me tell you something.
[1:47:51] It's scary.
[1:47:53] I'm a pastor here. I've seen a lot of
[1:47:55] people. I've heard a lot of evangelists
[1:47:57] come through here and preach the gospel.
[1:48:01] Preach the gospel. And people have
[1:48:02] walked away from it. Walked away from
[1:48:05] it.
[1:48:08] I'm here to tell you as a pastor, it's a
[1:48:10] scary thing, Brother Brad.
[1:48:13] I'm not the judge. I'm glad I'm not
[1:48:16] because Paul persecuted the very church
[1:48:18] of God for a while. Ain't that right?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Blasphemed, so to speak. But the thing
[1:48:24] that Paul said he did is he did it in
[1:48:26] his ignorance.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; If people get up and walk out, my praise
[1:48:35] God, forgive them. Just let it be in
[1:48:38] their ignorance.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Let it be in their ignorance. You don't
[1:48:42] wish that to nobody.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is the judge. But that's what
[1:48:49] brother Brandham was saying is that
[1:48:50] we're living in a world. Look at it.
[1:48:54] I'll say this, our balcony should be
[1:48:57] full.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; This place should be crowded. The chairs
[1:49:01] ought to be out. But people have failed
[1:49:04] to hear the voice of God.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; They hardened their hearts. Nah, they're
[1:49:09] just a false prophet. No, he's not a
[1:49:11] false prophet. It's a real prophet of
[1:49:13] God. And you're going to seal your
[1:49:15] destination
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; by the attitude that you have
[1:49:20] towards those whom God has sent.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Evening light tabernacle.
[1:49:34] It's not time to backslide.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Not time to get cold on God.
[1:49:43] Ask yourselves what's important.
[1:49:47] What's first in your life?
[1:49:50] Brother Bam says, "In the seal of God,
[1:49:52] but one of these days, the last Holy
[1:49:54] Ghost anointed sermon will be preached."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? One of these
[1:50:00] days, me and Brother Brad, we're going
[1:50:01] to preach our last sermon here.
[1:50:04] Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; The last gun will fire. One of these
[1:50:08] days the last last song will be sung.
[1:50:13] One of these days the last prayer will
[1:50:15] be prayed. One of these days the doors
[1:50:17] of the tabernacle will be closed for the
[1:50:20] last time. The Bible will be closed on
[1:50:22] the pulpit and you'll stand in the
[1:50:24] presence of God and give an account for
[1:50:26] what you've heard tonight.
[1:50:29] Hello. In other words, what you do with
[1:50:32] it now
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; determines where you'll be then.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Now and then.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Very important words.
[1:50:44] Today is the day of salvation. Now is
[1:50:47] time to accept the pardon that God has
[1:50:49] given to you.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Don't wait. You got all those examples.
[1:50:52] Why wouldn't you say, "Yeah, look at
[1:50:54] that. I don't want to end up like that.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; I want to serve God with all my heart.
[1:51:02] Amen.
[1:51:04] And you'll stand in the presence of God
[1:51:05] and give an account for tonight. Brother
[1:51:07] Bam says, "What then? What then? When
[1:51:10] the great book is opened, what then?
[1:51:14] When tonight comes on record, what
[1:51:18] then?"
[1:51:20] Then Brother Bam says, "Those tapes will
[1:51:22] meet this generation on judgment day."
[1:51:26] Cuz those were not brother Bam's words.
[1:51:28] That was Christ's word.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; He said God would not come and vindicate
[1:51:33] something that ain't right.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; But he did. Listen, he came and proved
[1:51:39] what was right. When the great book is a
[1:51:41] what then? Tonight on the records, what
[1:51:45] then? Oh, as the song says, what then?
[1:51:48] When the great book is opened, what
[1:51:50] then? When the ones that rejected the
[1:51:52] Savior today will be asked to give a
[1:51:55] reason. What then?
[1:51:58] Oh my. I believe that you could you
[1:52:02] could actually somehow inject a little
[1:52:05] bit of the fear of God into people if
[1:52:07] you just if they just realize that you
[1:52:10] can't just go on thinking that you don't
[1:52:12] have to give an account for yourself.
[1:52:17] But they've deceived our young people
[1:52:21] into thinking they've come from monkeys
[1:52:22] or they evolved and they'll die like
[1:52:24] rats or anything else. And so it doesn't
[1:52:27] really matter. And it doesn't if you
[1:52:29] really believe that. No wonder they
[1:52:30] shoot everybody up. No wonder they have
[1:52:33] no morals. No, we're all just going to
[1:52:35] die anyway.
[1:52:38] Get mad at somebody or whatever. You
[1:52:40] know, it's sad. That's what our
[1:52:43] leaders
[1:52:45] have taught our children. And then they
[1:52:48] wonder
[1:52:50] how many knows it is terrible. What
[1:52:52] about this in what is it Minnesota now?
[1:52:55] and that the the corruption of all of
[1:52:57] this money that uh they've gotten and
[1:53:00] borrowed is, you know, and and and just
[1:53:03] the corruption is really coming out.
[1:53:05] Like brother Bam says, the core will go
[1:53:07] plum to core. It's just really bad.
[1:53:12] Finishing up. Listen, when that great
[1:53:14] when that great book is open, he says
[1:53:17] when you'll be asked to give a reason,
[1:53:21] what then?
[1:53:24] Your job stood in your way.
[1:53:27] Your parents stood in your way. Your
[1:53:29] boyfriend stood in your way. Your
[1:53:31] girlfriend sitt in your way. Your church
[1:53:33] stood in your way. What then? What then?
[1:53:37] Now I wrote down here, maybe you stood
[1:53:38] in your own way. How many know it's
[1:53:41] cause you to take out to take up your
[1:53:43] own cross, die to your own self daily.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] No, no,
[1:54:01] no is the answer. I didn't let anything
[1:54:05] stand any more my way. We gave our all.
[1:54:09] How many wants to say, I give my all.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I give you everything. I give you my
[1:54:14] all, both great and small.
[1:54:17] We're going to scream. We're going to
[1:54:19] shout and say, "God, I'm so thankful
[1:54:21] that you by your grace help me to whip
[1:54:23] myself." Because many times we are our
[1:54:25] own worst enemy.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Our self is our own worst enemy. I want
[1:54:31] to do this. I'm going to do that. I get
[1:54:33] caught up too much in other things.
[1:54:36] I'm here to confess evening light
[1:54:38] tabernacle and to you listening. Amen.
[1:54:40] That I love to work. I love to build. I
[1:54:42] love to hunt. I like to fish. Amen. I
[1:54:44] like to do things and I'm too busy. I've
[1:54:46] been too busy for years.
[1:54:49] so busy
[1:54:53] that I have to make time that when I'm
[1:54:55] drinking my coffee, I'll get my iPad and
[1:54:57] push play and listen to scriptures four
[1:55:00] or five chapters and so forth. I'd
[1:55:02] gotten away from it. Hello. Time to get
[1:55:05] down on your knees and pray, study,
[1:55:08] think about your soul.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this most of all, make
[1:55:13] sure church that God is first.
[1:55:18] Put God first in everything. He won't
[1:55:20] have it any other way.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't, you'll easily fall
[1:55:25] into one of those categories of, "Well,
[1:55:27] this got in my way or that got in my
[1:55:29] way." Amen.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; We can't have it.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; As the pastor, I don't want you to have
[1:55:36] it. I want you to be close to God and be
[1:55:38] ready to go.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; I want to be ready to go.
[1:55:48] Lord, change my heart.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Show me where I still have impurities in
[1:55:53] there. Let God search your heart. See
[1:55:57] where you still have impurities in
[1:55:59] there.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; He'll tell you.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; When we come back to church Sunday,
[1:56:06] we'll have a different atmosphere,
[1:56:09] a better one yet.
[1:56:12] I'm not making y'all sinners and so
[1:56:14] forth, but I know that we all are human.
[1:56:17] We have our errors and we have our
[1:56:19] shortcomings. We have our things in man
[1:56:21] that we need to deal with and say, "God,
[1:56:22] help me and make me stronger in it."
[1:56:23] Ain't that right?
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit has that much
[1:56:27] discernment to know because we've got to
[1:56:29] get ready to get out of here, people. We
[1:56:31] got to be ready for the If you're going
[1:56:33] in the rapture, you got to be ready for
[1:56:34] that rapture.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; You got to got to be able to say,
[1:56:36] "Brother B, I'm ready for the rapture.
[1:56:39] I'm ready to go."
[1:56:40] Amen.
[1:56:42] Why do you think brother Brandham in
[1:56:44] most of his sermons, Lord, forgive me of
[1:56:46] my wrong, forgive us of our debts, and
[1:56:47] forgive us where we have sinned against
[1:56:49] you, constantly making things right,
[1:56:51] making sure you're right, in tune.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:03] Musicians, if you'll come.
[1:57:09] Think
[1:57:11] about
[1:57:13] your soul more than you think about
[1:57:18] your body.
[1:57:20] Amen.
[1:57:24] And you'll have your perspective right.
[1:57:28] Jesus said, "What does it profit a man
[1:57:31] if he gain the whole world and lose your
[1:57:34] soul?" How many is the most treasured
[1:57:37] thing that you've got is your soul? It's
[1:57:39] your life. That's the real treasure.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; That's what Christ came to save. Save
[1:57:44] our souls. Give us eternal life.
[1:57:48] How many's glad to have eternal life?
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Eternal life.
[1:57:54] 10,000 years
[1:57:57] and we'll just be started.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? We'll just be started.
[1:58:08] That's right.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; 10 million. That's just a little bit too
[1:58:11] much for me to comprehend. Uh a 100,000
[1:58:14] years. That's a little more, you know.
[1:58:17] Imagine 10 million years will just be
[1:58:20] started.
[1:58:24] Oh my. Praise be to God. God is good,
[1:58:28] isn't he?
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you all for praying for me. Will
[1:58:33] all you continue to pray? Lord, help the
[1:58:36] pastor to come up here, not just preach.
[1:58:39] And I I was funny that brother Brad
[1:58:41] said, "Not just another Wednesday night
[1:58:43] because I was going to say that thing
[1:58:44] when I come out here. We're not here
[1:58:46] just to have another service on a
[1:58:48] Wednesday night." But no, we come here
[1:58:51] to search our souls. We are here to have
[1:58:53] the Holy Spirit speak to us and tell us
[1:58:56] what we should do, where our focus ought
[1:58:59] to be,
[1:59:01] where we need to repent.
[1:59:04] How many needs to repent?
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Stand with me tonight,
[1:59:10] Lord Jesus. You see all of our hands up,
[1:59:12] Father, in the day and age that we're
[1:59:15] living in, Lord, the speed that
[1:59:17] everything's going and we get caught up
[1:59:19] in that speed, God, and we need to slow
[1:59:21] it down,
[1:59:23] Lord, to make time for you and realize,
[1:59:25] God,
[1:59:27] sometimes we just get too busy, Father,
[1:59:29] and we don't stay prayed up. We don't
[1:59:31] stay in tune like we ought to, Lord.
[1:59:34] you become secondary, third, fourth.
[1:59:39] Lord, forgive us. We ask God tonight
[1:59:42] that you'd renew our fellowship with
[1:59:44] you. Lord, if there's anybody in here
[1:59:46] that sinned, God, and they actually
[1:59:48] brought their hands up into the air,
[1:59:50] said, "I do need to repent. There's
[1:59:52] things I need to repent of." They're
[1:59:54] honest, God. And even as your prophetist
[1:59:57] said, if you're not right with God,
[2:00:00] stop the tape right now. Get right right
[2:00:03] now, Father. This is our time. Now is
[2:00:05] our time to say, "Lord Jesus, wash us
[2:00:08] white. Clean us of any iniquity.
[2:00:11] Sometimes we sin, Lord. And sometimes we
[2:00:13] do things we know we ought to do. No,
[2:00:16] but every one of us iniquity, we ask
[2:00:18] God, forgive us of iniquity, Lord. Wash
[2:00:21] us pure. Help us to go from here a
[2:00:25] better people than what we were when we
[2:00:27] came in those doors, Lord. closer to
[2:00:29] you,
[2:00:32] more on fire for you, Lord. Bless every
[2:00:35] heart, every hand now, Lord. Lord, as
[2:00:38] they repent and say, "God, forgive me,
[2:00:40] Father, of where I've gotten away from
[2:00:41] you, Lord. Forgive me. It's so easy to
[2:00:44] get caught up with jobs, to get caught
[2:00:47] up with work, to get up with caught up
[2:00:50] with pleasure, to get caught up with
[2:00:52] whatever it might be that we get caught
[2:00:53] up in, Lord. And you don't stay on the
[2:00:56] forefront, Father. This is no time to
[2:00:58] let up, God. Cuz we want to meet you in
[2:01:01] the air. When you say, "Come up." You
[2:01:04] said, "Lazarus, come forth." And one of
[2:01:06] these days a trumpet sound, and you're
[2:01:08] going to call your bride up, Lord. We
[2:01:10] want to hear our name called. We want to
[2:01:13] be a part of that great reunion in the
[2:01:15] sky to meet you in the air, Lord. And
[2:01:18] we're going to be at a great great
[2:01:22] wedding supper. We're going to be on
[2:01:24] that table gathered around while the
[2:01:26] earth is on fire. We'll be
[2:01:28] fellowshipping one with another and
[2:01:29] you'll be wiping the tears from our
[2:01:31] eyes.
[2:01:33] Amen. And it'll be eternal joy, Lord
[2:01:35] Jesus. While you're purging this earth,
[2:01:38] while you're burning this earth, and all
[2:01:40] that do wickedly,
[2:01:43] all the evil will be burned. So take all
[2:01:46] evil out of us Lord as we come this
[2:01:47] Wednesday night to prepare to get a
[2:01:50] little more ready Lord to meet you in
[2:01:51] the air. Father in Jesus name we ask it.
[2:01:56] Amen and amen. Brother David.
[2:02:00] Amen. Until then. Praise the Lord. You
[2:02:04] love him with all your heart tonight.
[2:02:06] Amen. Brother Thomas asked that we'd
[2:02:08] sing this song tonight. Until then.
[2:02:11] Amen. I ask him to get the words and
[2:02:14] we'll pull it up. And how many enjoyed
[2:02:15] the word tonight? And
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; my you know I I listened to that message
[2:02:20] yesterday investments and then I
[2:02:22] listened to the prophet today convinced
[2:02:24] and concerned and and then then brother
[2:02:26] Chris preached Sunday and I brother
[2:02:29] Brandon was talking about that old man
[2:02:30] that got excited in the attic because he
[2:02:32] had a geography book. I said Lord that's
[2:02:35] my desire.
[2:02:38] I don't have to have a Bible, but I can
[2:02:39] see in everything around me that it's
[2:02:42] you living in me. That's my heart's
[2:02:45] desire. Amen.
[2:02:49] My heart can sing.
[2:02:52] When I pause to remember,
[2:02:59] a heartache here
[2:03:02] is but a stepping stone.
[2:03:08] That's winding.
[2:03:12] It's winding all ways upward.
[2:03:18] This trouble
[2:03:22] is not my final home.
[2:03:28] But until the end,
[2:03:32] my heart will go on singing.
[2:03:38] But until then,
[2:03:42] with joy I'll carry on.
[2:03:48] Until
[2:03:49] the day
[2:03:52] my eyes behold that city
[2:03:58] until the day
[2:04:02] God calls
[2:04:04] me home.
[2:04:08] The things of earth
[2:04:12] will dim and lose their value
[2:04:18] if we recall.
[2:04:21] They're borrowed for a while
[2:04:28] and things of earth
[2:04:31] that cause the heart to tremble.
[2:04:38] Remember there
[2:04:41] will only bring a smile.
[2:04:48] But until then they
[2:04:51] my heart will go on singing
[2:04:57] for until they
[2:05:01] with joy I'll carry on
[2:05:07] until the day.
[2:05:13] Behold that city
[2:05:17] until the day
[2:05:21] God calls
[2:05:24] me home.
[2:05:27] This weary world
[2:05:31] with all its toll and struggle
[2:05:37] may take its soul
[2:05:41] of misery
[2:05:43] and strive.
[2:05:47] The soul of man
[2:05:51] is like a waiting eagle.
[2:05:57] When it's released,
[2:06:00] it's destined for the sky.
[2:06:06] But until this,
[2:06:10] my heart will go on singing.
[2:06:16] But until this
[2:06:20] with joy I'll carry on
[2:06:26] until the day
[2:06:30] my eyes behold that city.
[2:06:36] until the day
[2:06:40] God calls
[2:06:42] me home.
[2:06:46] Amen. Are you looking forward to that
