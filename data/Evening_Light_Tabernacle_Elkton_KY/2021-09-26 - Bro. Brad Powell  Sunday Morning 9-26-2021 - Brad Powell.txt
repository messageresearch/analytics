brother troy children can be dismissed for sunday school and if we'll go in the psalms psalms 119. we're going to start um with uh verse 89. and we're going to read the 104. psalms 119 starting verse 89 forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou has quickened me the wicked have waited for me and destroy me but i will contin consider thy testimonies oh how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation i have refrained my feet from every evil way that i might keep that word how sweet are they words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey my mouth through thy precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters you know you reading those uh verses right there i don't care if the the oldest man the youngest man same for the woman the smartest man or the dumbest man i don't mean that in a bad way you have more knowledge and more understanding in the world we live in this morning to anyone out there i don't care if he's got double degrees phd's the scripture just tells you if you've got the revelation of god's word for the hour that you live in then you're smarter than the rest of those people out there in the world that you know they they would call you uh ignorant because you hold on to a simple faith and a simple truth but it's the opposite it's completely the opposite you're holding on to something that has more weight to it than what they believe but if you return with me to uh uh galatians the sixth chapter before i get started i've like i talked to you before i paid all those bills that we talked about i didn't pay all the insurance i'm paid up into the uh last day in february for the next so the first six months is paid for all not all the fuel i only paid two thousand dollars for the winter fill but last year was about by the time what we had in the tanks and well we didn't have as much in the tank last fall as we started as we do this year we're almost 80 so i'm thinking we'll be all right i might have to top it pending on the winner the kind of winner we get i think we'll be all right with the fuel cell that's brought the general fund down from that amount that i told you about so right now we're down to about right about five thousand dollars i have a deposit ready to make before i go on vacation so i'm gonna try to make that deposit on monday or tuesday morning so the church financially is still sitting pretty well uh the only last thing i have to do for the church is i'm i need to try to de-lime the boiler before we start the seasoning i don't know if i'm going to have that time but that's the last thing i have to do before we we turn the heat on but we've been pretty fortunate with this one i have had no issues in two years uh with it so the other ones before that every every 18 months to 12 months either it was a part that went out or we had a leak so uh just hoping the best and god will bless us there but i was uh listening to numerous messages this morning just sitting in my office and the thing i wrote some notes down but all of us sitting here this morning wouldn't be here this morning unless we believe jesus christ and the word of god and obviously you can't make someone believe you can't force someone to believe you can't explain sometimes to somebody why you believe but you just believe and that's a gift that god gives you doesn't mean it excuses you be ignorant of god's word i'm not saying that but it's a gift that god gives each of us every day that we just simply believe god's word and and we just stand on it we live on it we it's there's nothing else we can do but depend on it and you can sometimes some people you can't explain to them why you believe you just believe now the world we live in right now they call that vine ignorance you know because you just simply believe a simple truth but it's really important that we believe just what god tells us but i'll read this this morning you know and brother brown was in the message i was listening this morning the one thing that really struck me we overlooked he he always told the people i if if god has saved you sanctified you and given you the holy ghost don't be afraid to ask for something here in that match i don't know how many times he said that don't be afraid to ask god for something that you need in the hour of your need you know a lot of times as men you have a tendency just want to bear your pains and bear your burdens but that's not how a christian's really supposed to be you need to release your burdens to him and whatever your need is you don't be afraid ask god for it you know whatever that need is this morning or in your life don't be afraid to ask god to do something for you the more you ask him to do and the more that he proves himself to you the greater your experience will be and the more willing you'll be to want to share it with someone else you never ask god to do something for you it doesn't give you an opportunity to tell people what god's done for you so you should never be afraid to ask god to do something for you now some people that's different they would rather just bear their burdens and go to the grave just like that but that's not how a christian's supposed to be but let me read this here before i get off on the tangent here and this is what paul had to say brethren if a man be overtaken excuse me brethren if a man be overtaken in a fall he that are spiritual restore such as one in the spirit of meekness considering myself at least thou also be tempted you know that word meekness there sometimes we forget about that you like i just said you can't make someone believe but in meekness and in love you try to correct your brother or your neighbor when you know they're doing something wrong does it make you better than them should you have an attitude like you're better than them no but in meekness and in love you try to correct people consider myself least thou also be tempted and that's what paul is saying here when you're trying to correct people you be really mindful of your own attitude and your own place in life and he goes up bear ye another one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself you know i spend hours talking about that that's how most of the people on that you work with they forget that they're human too they make any time you deal with people a lot of times when they're on a tangent they forget that they're a human being and they make mistakes also too let everyone prove his own works and he shall have rejoicing himself alone not in another you know that goes about not being afraid to ask god for something and you're going to bear your own works one day and he goes every man shall bear his own burdens let him that is taught in the word communicate on to him that teaches in all good things be not deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man selleth that shall he also reap you know you know every man every woman every child you all know that you when you reach something you sow or excuse me i shouldn't have said it that way when you sow you reap it's an aspect of life you can't get away with i've done things in my flesh as a young man that i'm paying for today as i live that we all are at that point it goes on to say let him that his thought and word communicate on to all that teacheth good things be not deceived god is not mocked so whatsoever a man so that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his thought shall reap shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall the spirit reap life everlasting i'll finish on that eighth verse you know there's two types of selling you either sow good seed or you sow bad seed in your life and that's a choice we're going to make this morning or we've made in our whole life what kind of seed we plant in the ground and uh we want it to be good seed that it brings forth more life in our lives and everything that we do you know i was uh just like when i was listening to that message i say i'll just say it again that's one thing that struck me while he was teaching to the people that's he kept saying it time and time and time again don't be afraid to ask god for something whatever it is this morning just don't be afraid if you've done what god asked you to do if you've met those requirements that god has asked you to do and you've done all those things and don't be afraid to ask god to do something for you this morning brother david hey man you love him with all of your heart this morning i mean let's stand and sing that little course i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart this morning if we could well i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise i will say this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice for he has made me glad [Music] and he has made me glad yes he has made me glad oh i will rejoice for he has made me glad that yes he has made me glad it's made me glad oh i will rejoice for he has faith in that once again this morning when i will enter escape with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise oh i will say this is the day that the lord has made oh i will rejoice for he has made me glad oh and he has made me glad yes he has made

lord anyway and it really doesn't matter what comes my way today i'm gonna wear a smile hold my head up high and say oh i'm happy in the lord anyway will you know oh satan he likes to get you down he

this morning he said he was ready for snow i thought man you are out of your mind with weather like this who wants snow i thought he said you know just a little bit i forgot the amount he thought i

praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god praise god amen good to be in the house of the lord i just uh thankful thankful for the pre-service and the sunday school and the songs that we're saying just couldn't have lined up any better than than what i had on my mind that'd be all for the music thank you um and you know brother brian why don't you have your seat for just a minute i i kind of had a detour of thoughts here when i listened to the sunday school and then the uh the the special that was sung there and brother brian was talking about the sunday school really stuck to me there where he was talking about he'd done some things as a young man and you know i think we've all been there and uh this last week i i was asked to go preach i guess the chapel at the boys school and that's kind of what we we spoke on is scars and the life that we live as a young person this should be our greatest time in our life but yet if we're not careful the memories that we have and the things we see and hear and do as a young person creates memories of scars and and so uh i thought about that i thought man that's just really kind of fitting with with what's going on then when uh sister sister becky and brother steve there they got up there and singing about the mountain if you've got a mountain you can't climb or a river you can't cross or a valley that's too wide there's a way across it and you know that goes kind of right along with what uh what my fault was today and um sitting there and i was studying and this little little story come to me and said there was a little five-year-old boy uh that was in the kitchen and he was watching his mother make supper and she asked this little boy said i want you to go down to the cellar and i want you to get me a can of tomato soup and he said i don't want to go down there i don't i don't want to go down there alone it's dark down there i'm scared i don't want to go mama and she asked again he was still persistent i don't want to go and finally the mom looked at the little boy and she said it's okay jesus will be in there with you jesus will be in there with you and so the little boy he walked down slowly down there and he opened up into the door to go on down to the cellar and he looked down in there and he said it was dark and musky and and and he was scared and fearful and and just about then he was fixing to leave and then he got the idea and he said jesus if you're in there would you hand me a can of tomato soup now we laugh at that but i think about this when we think about this in our life so many times we're called upon to go into uncomfortable situations we're faced with situations where we have to climb the mountain and and we look at the story that little story and we kind of chuckle at it but it's just true because we go into places that we're driven into sometimes we go into places that that'll challenge us and see if we really do believe what we say we believe and this way god puts us through these tests and we have to have this mindset that no matter where life takes us and no matter what i have to do no matter what it is god i'm going through because it's easy to stop it's easy to quit it's easy to not keep pressing on so this morning i'm going to try to take my time uh i i just felt like i i were several directions i felt to go but i i just felt that i want to slow down if i could this morning and maybe teach just a little bit and that's not by my choice but that's just the way i felt to go so we'll try to slow slow it down a little bit if you would stand with me we'll read into in the book of genesis genesis 22 i think a lot of times we preachers we like to preach because it's it's energetic and and you know teaching can be energetic too but a lot of times when you preach your thoughts are moving so fast and and and you're being inspired so quick that you oh you kind of pass over the little details and a lot of times in life it's the little details that'll get you through the big problems so genesis 22 it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine only son whom thou lovest now i want you to remember that little statement there whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains for which i tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two young men with him and isaac his son and claimed wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which god had told him then on the third day how many is thankful for the third day on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship remember that go yonder and worship and come again to you hold on to that there's a lot in this come again to you and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here i am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering my goodness think about this question if it was given to you dad i see the wood i see the fire i see the knife but where is the where's the lamb at this was a 16 to 18 year old young man the prophet said some people think he was 33 around the same age as christ when all this happened this wasn't a child that was oblivious or didn't know what was going on he knew exactly what they were going to do where is the lamb and watch what abraham said my son remember this god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering and so they went to both of them together and they came to the place which god had told them of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son let's pray heavenly father we're thankful lord for this day you've given us for the many blessings in our lives regrets your mercy lord and lord we we feel like the service has been orchestrated from the very beginning to bring honor and glory to you and to build our faith this morning lord to to show us who we are as believers and to help us recognize that you move in our life you work in our life and you expect great things from us because you put it in there to begin with and you just want to see it pulled out of us lord and so we asked lord this morning as the word goes forth as the preaching and the teaching goes forward that we be drawn closer to you lord we just want to tell you lord we give you honor we give you praise and glory for all you do in jesus name god bless you may have your seats many times i feel like we we get to a place that we uh we take god's power and his ability for granted we don't we don't let god be god a lot of times we're so uh so caught up in our human self that we want to control things we want things to be the way we want it and we don't let god be god and do what god is capable of doing listen to this quote and it's in 54 god providing healing for this generation and and if you want to look it up but he says when the crucial moment has been come god is able to step in right there and provide the sacrifice or a provided way when god has made us a promise god's under obligation to his word to keep it his obligation is to you the believer so if he gives you a promise and he tells you that you're going to go through the life and you're going to do this and you're going to do that it's his obligation to keep his word listen to this next quote and this is where i it blew my mind i read it four or five times to make sure i was reading it right and i read it and listen what he says he says because god he's preaching in chicago and he says god could make sea serpes crawl out of that lake there so big that it would mash chicago down if he seemed fit to do it and we limit god's ability we limit what god can do he can make sea serpents crawl out of the lake so big that it would mash chicago down if he seemed fit to do it he says that sounds mythical but he could do it he could create one when god speaks he speaks life into existence and he can speak life out of existence he's god and we underestimate his being his ability for he can do all things so look in here we see abraham here looking here at abraham and the jewish teaching here tells us that uh abraham was tested in 10 different manners of events in his life and a lot of times we we don't think about that we look at different people in the bible we look at the different events that they go through but we always think about abraham and being the father of faith brother branham says this he says now god the creator speaking here to abraham the patriarch and he said gave him a promise of a son through sarah his wife who was now nearing about the age of 90 and abraham was a hundred and about that time about 25 years of waiting for god to fulfill his promise little isaac was born and then after isaac became the age of about 16 or 18 god told him to take isaac out and to offer him for a sacrifice and he said that was destroying destroying every hope that he would ever be heir to the world can you imagine what's going through abraham's mind god has given him this promise and now all of a sudden he's going to destroy every hope he has brothers and sisters over and over and over in life we're going to be tested and god here and the prophet's not talking about trials and so much of battles but something that will make you stand for what you believe abraham here was being called to stand for what he believed and he had to stand on the faith that was in him and i thought about this and i thought about peter and i thought about when peter was called and he wanted to walk on the water and he said lord beat me to come and so instantly there's something inside of him when jesus said come faith rose up inside of peter it was already there god had already there because peter had seen things happen over and over and over so peter now looks and he hears god come peter so he comes but what happened his faith began to waver he began to look at the circumstances all around him and that faith that was so strong to give him the ability the true ability to walk on water wavered and so peter because he's wavering faith he didn't he didn't hold on to all that he had learnt he didn't hold on to all that he had seen the miracles after miracle after miracle and because of that slowly he drifted down in the water and cried out saved me but we see abraham here he's got 10 different times in his life that's documented in jewish traditions here god tells it let's look at him god tells him to leave your homeland and become a stranger in the land of canaan that takes a little bit of faith leave everything that you know leave all of your customs all of your traditions leave everything and go into a strange land and start all over of course immediately when he gets there what happens but a famine we a lot of times we make a move we think it's going to be for the better right and he gets there and there's a famine next thing we know the egyptians they like the looks of his wife say hey we we want to take her and he's all oh that's my sister you remember the story that's my sister because he was afraid for his life abraham faces the battle of nine kings another big battle there in the in the bible he marries hagar because he can't have children with sarah god tells him to circumcise himself at an at an old age that'll kill most people it was a brutal procedure back in those days and it would kill most people today again the second time his wife has looked upon twice and he tells the same stories my sister twice this happens and then god tells him things are finally going good he's got a child israel god tells him says send hagar away get rid of hagar and ishmael get them out of your life send them out of the way get them out gone and lastly god tells him to sacrifice his dear son isaac upon this altar and we see abraham's life it's it's spoken about and talked about again back into the new testament in the book of hebrews because we look at him as the father of faith and abraham is honored and he's honored for his obedience and his commitment to god and for the life he lived a faithful life to god and he's talked about in the heap in the book of hebrews in chapter 11 and even sarah is brought into it and says through faith sarah also received strength to conceive and a child was delivered when she was past her age because she judged him faithful who had a promise so faith surrounded these people and as believers faith surrounds us people but what do we do with it so it's important that we look here and as we look at this and we break this down and we see brothers and sisters and we note here that god tested abraham and it wasn't so much of a test to produce faith to try to get him stronger in faith but it was it was a test to reveal the faith are you hearing me it was a test to reveal the faith that was already in there and god built this faith slowly in abraham's life tested him day by day slowly piece by piece year by year he was building and building and building to get abraham to a place that he could carry out what god was going to ask him to do and so what that tells us is that we have to learn from our trials and our tests we have to be committed to say god when i go through something and you put me through something what have i learned what have i gained how have i grown in your word and how has my faith been strengthened you have to ask yourself christians brothers and sisters we have to be honest and ask ourselves these things so that we can get to a place that god wants us you know we're expecting to take a rapture we've got to get the faith that's within us pulled out to the surface i can't imagine a better test than what the lord applied to abraham on that day here's your only son here's the son that i promised you for 25 years and there's the son that i turned you back to a young man so and your wife to a young woman so that you could have the sun here is the sun that's going to be heir to everything and you're going to be the the grains of sand are going to be the number of your people this is the sun think about it put it in your day put it in our perspective this is the one that you raised up you called it as a baby this is the son that you sent off to school you took pictures of him the first day of school you were so proud of him you got him involved in sports and he loved these things and now he's grown up to 16 18 years old he's a young man in the prime of his life and i want you to take him up here on this hill and slay him god calls down to abraham abraham and he says here i am here i am what was that abraham was quick to answer the call of god abraham was quick and it's a wonderful example of how the man or woman of faith should respond to god and then when god calls upon us we should be quick to faithfully answer him we should be able to answer god but do we do that do we do that said here i am which meant i'm ready abraham knew what he'd been through abraham knew the battles that he had overcome the trials the tests the life that he had been been honed out of and he looks at him and he says i'm ready god i'm ready to be taught i'm ready to obey i'm ready to surrender and i'm ready to be examined by god are we there are we there this morning that we can look at god and say god whatever the word when the word goes forth teach me from it god and i'm going to obey that word and god i want you to know that i'm going to fully surrender my life and here's the hard one and examine me how many of us can don't raise your hands but how many of us could stand before god and say examine me i know where i'm at god examine me that's a tough question but brothers and sisters i believe god when he asked called for abraham and abraham said here i am i believe that god must have adored the boldness in that man's voice and he must adore the boldness of the believers when we stand before him and say come god i need more of you take now your son your only son isaac did you notice there that there's significance in that that god called isaac your only son he called him your only son when abraham had another son ishmael but ishmael in the previous chapter had been cast out and thrown away and so as far as god was concerned and as far as the godly covenant was concerned abraham had one son one son and he looks at this and he says it's your only son isaac whom you love remember i told you to hold on to that whom you love and if you count or start in the book of genesis 1 1 to genesis 22 when we get right here that's the first time the word love is ever used there's some significance there that's the first time that the word love is used in the bible i didn't believe it either go home put it in your computer keep it up and see it's the first time that love is ever used it's first mentioned in the context of a love between a father and a son and the connection of the idea that there's going to be a sacrificial offering of the son are you with me that's deep that's deep you better put on your thinking through your thinking caps because abraham is being told i want you to take your son whom you love i'm going to love my son the first time that love is cast into humanity yet with this love every phrase of god's commandment to abraham cuts like a knife everything god told abraham is cutting he tells him take your son he didn't say ask ask isaac ask him if if he wants to go go talk to sarah about this situation and see what she thinks take take your son your only son cuts him right there cuts him take your only son isaac whom you love cutting him cutting him deep and offer him as a burnt offering god telling abraham to offer him as a burnt offering for that offering to take place there has to be a sacrifice there has to be a death and you see abraham he was a sojourner he was a pilgrim in the land of canaan and and he heard about he heard this when god told him this and this wasn't nothing new for the canaanites this wasn't nothing they were used to having uh sacrifice sacrificial offerings before their gods and abraham hears this and it kind of strikes him just a little funny as he thinks about this can you imagine because he's thinking the people of canaan there's nothing strange about this but i thought yahweh was different i thought god was different and so with this command that god has given abraham he must wonder yahweh what kind of covenant is this i thought you was the creator of heaven and earth are you like these pagan gods that the canaanites and others worship they say it don't matter if god's leading you or not if god's head of the program or not there's going to be something that's going to place a little bit of doubt in your walk there's going to be something that gives you a little bit of room to make a decision you see our christian walk is based around the decisions we make and here abraham was caught between a rock and a hard place so to speak and he had to make a decision he had to make a decision am i going to believe that this is the god a new a god of a true covenant the creator of heaven and earth or am i going to believe this is some pagan see abraham's no different than we are today we find ourselves a lot of times in situations where we question our minds god what are you doing and we try to take things upon ourself but by the end of the story abraham knew that god was not like these pagan gods god was not going to demand a human sacrifice but in fact the truth was just the opposite but let me ask you this morning how would you react put yourself in abraham's shoes i always like to do that because i like to honestly ask myself what would i say put yourself in his shoes what would you say we would do what most people would say god mind your own business this is my son this is my life this is this is the way i want to do it mind your own business [Applause] thankful for one honest art i'm going to do it my way and see that's what the world has done [Music] they they tell god to mind his own business that's not what believers do but that's what the world does they say we need prayer in school mind your own business god we don't want you in our schools we know as believers we need the ten commandments to be posted on every building in the in the nation mind your own business god get out of our courts and that's what the world does over and over and over they say mind your own business but not abraham [Music] not abraham it meant more to him he wanted to be pleasing to god this test here was difficult in another aspect and it because it seemed to contradict the previous promise of god he's already told uh i told him he said it's already told abraham that i promise and isaac your seed shall be called that's a promise and what i said earlier you can't god can't change his mind on his promises it's going to come to pass and he tells him in isaac yours shall be called but still there's a strange contradictory how am i going to kill my son who's going to be who my seed is going to be in when he doesn't have children how am i going to do that how am i going to do this but god made a promise and brother and sister sometimes god wants us to learn the difference between trusting the promise and trusting the promiser there's a big difference there's a big difference between trust in the promise because we can believe for a promise but you may not get to that promise the way you thought you would and when you feel like you're running in circles and you're battling and you think god i know you told me to do this i know you told me to go here i know you told me to move here i know you told me to take this job i know you told me to send my kids here everything it seems like from the pits of hell battles against you are you trusting the promiser because the promiser said you're going to get there he didn't say hell and see it's easy for us sometimes to put god's promise before god himself and we feel it's our responsibility i'm going to bring this promise to pass god you told me i'm going to go here i'm going to do this i'm going to do that i'll tell you what i'm going to i'm going to go this way i'm going to circle around and i'm going to come back through here and i'm going to go through this through this riverbed and i'm going to climb this mountain and all the while god's saying you're on the wrong road to the promise the children of israel they were given a promise i promised land but they wanted to do it their own way and wander and wander and wander and wander on a few days journey for 40 years you think they were trusting the promiser no no they were trusting in themselves but we we can't allow things in this world to to think we're going to take a matter into our own hands that's not the way the promiser works down south brother brown said there was a an old black guy that loved the lord he believed the word and he said his boss said to him said why do you carry that bible for and he said well boss i believe it he said you can't read he says what do you carry it for he said i carry it because i believe it from cover to cover and he said i believe the cover also because it's got holy bible on it and he said somebody tells me that anyway he said i know it can't fail for it's god's promise and the boss said do you believe that he keep all those promises he said i most certainly do and he said well what if god would tell you to jump through that stone wall what would you do he said i jump i jump now in our life if god told me to go through a stone wall i might try to go around the end of that thing because being honest it would probably hurt if i jumped into that stone wall are you with me so i'm going to try to take a route around it myself to get to where where god told me to be but that's not what this guy said he says no if god told me to jump through that stone wall i would jump and the boss told him he said well how would you think you'd get through it there's no hole in it and he said well if god told me to jump it'd have a hole in it when i got there that's faith that's living upon what the promiser says and not the promise so he said if god told me to jump through it i'm going to jump because there will be a hole there and no matter what kind of wall you're up against this morning if god told you that you would be on the other side he'll make a way through it god tells abraham go into the land of mariah and upon the mountains for which i shall tell you see god has specifics in life he's going to have him go to a specific place at a specific time on a specific day and we rush we rush things in life we're not patient like we should be we want things done now we're instant we're in the instant age and god says go to this certain certain place at this certain certain time and then i'm gonna instruct you what to do so abraham does just that he rises up early and no sign of hesitation when god tells him to go he rises up early and i'm thinking to myself that must have been one sleepless night as he's in the camp with isaac no one knows what's fixing to happen and i'm thinking that must have been one sleepless night but god's obedience showed that he trusted god even when he didn't understand that's where we find ourselves in trouble a lot of times we don't understand god and what he's wanting us to do and so we figure it out and we try to uh wait until we understand things in other words we say god i'll do it and i'll obey you and when i understand it all god's not wanting you to understand what he wants you to do i don't understand a lot of things god has asked me to do but he's asking me to believe because whenever we put ourselves up there and say god i'm going to wait till i understand you're putting yourself up there on equal grounds with him yep and that's not going to work abraham showed the the obedience abraham knew god i can't walk unless you're holding my hand and he knows that he goes through there and he he don't go through there and and seek or debate and ask for counsel from others why is it when sometimes god speaks in our lives and it's so dear and treasured we want to go ask everybody's opinion and everybody's approval god told me to do this god told me to do that what do you think about it abraham didn't question he got up he went he began to move and it showed that he trusted god even when he didn't feel like it how many times in our lives dad you had to walk trust god when you don't feel like it i'm thankful i don't have to operate on my feelings because many times i don't feel like doing a lot of things but god requires us to move upon him when he calls upon us not upon our feelings if we went up our feelings we'll be in trouble abraham didn't have a word of argument no arguments there not one solitary question not even hesitation when he did that it's like to say god you're god i don't have to ask you why i don't have to know what the purpose is i don't have to know what the reason is but god you said it i'll do it i'm saying a lot of catchy things here i hope you're writing these down but remember as i say it god your god if you said it i'll do it we're still talking about him taking his son to the top of the mountain cutting his throat spilling his blood and burning him there's the reality of it and he saddles up his donkey and he goes out and begins to cut wood here's abraham he's out here now and he's saddling up his own donkey and he's starting to cut wood splitting wood why would he do that abraham had hundreds probably servants he had all kinds of people he had two young men with him on this journey that could have easily went out there and got his donkey ready busted his wood and got it ready but he wasn't going to do that this man was a sheik and he was mighty in his camp but at this time in his life he became a wood splitter because he knew that this work was too sacred for anybody else's hands and so he humbles himself down and goes down to begin to split wood and he'll doubt every time he split a piece of wood it would split his heart knowing that the wood he's splitting is to sacrifice his son he goes to the place that god tells him to go and and he's wonderfully trusting and obedient and he goes right to the spot where god tells him to go and you know would have been a whole lot easier on abraham if he could have just said god spare my son i'll just take my life he would have gladly done that there's not a father sitting in here who wouldn't gladly give your life to save your son but abraham didn't do that and he came up on this place into the third day a place which is today the modern day jerusalem and he said i'll go up yonder and worship i'm going to go up yonder and worship and when we talk about worship that is the first time the word worship is used in the bible same as love isn't that something worship and love and you've got god and and and jesus and you've got abraham and isaac and you've got love and worship father son both both examples are committed themselves to saving he said i'm going to go up there and worship which means to bow down he wasn't going up there to sing songs of praise and have a worship elevation worship service no he was going there to bow down before god and say god you've called upon me to do this and in humility and obedience i laid my life my son's life down and abraham leave to go up on up into the altar up into the mountains and abraham makes one of the most faithful statements you'll ever see in the bible and he looks to his servants and he says and we will come back to you he didn't say i'm coming back he said we will come back to you one of the most faithful things that's ever said and he's speaking to these young men and he's telling him i believe that both me myself and isaac are going to return so let me ask you how could he do that how could god tell him to go up there and sacrifice his son but yet he knows he's going to come back with him there was something deep on the deep on the inside there that was called to abraham and let him know that no matter what happens if god takes your only son and slays him he'll raise him up again he didn't ever doubt that there was going to be a sacrifice he didn't ever doubt that there was going to be a sacrifice but he knew that god would see a way back through because god had promised him isaac and him will be your seed you know at this age abraham's done been through a lot abraham's been through a lot in life at this point and abraham is at this point he's already been rejuvenated to youth and his wife sarah rejuvenated to youth and had a son so the probability of him the likelihood of him having any more children should isaac die it's not very good so he's living on a promise that is out of this world he's living upon a promise knowing that if isaac dies the very light of abraham is quenched there is no seed and abraham's name is forgotten abraham knew listen to this abraham knew anything was possible but he also knew that it was impossible for god to break his promise abraham knew that god was not a liar he knew that god was not a liar other than but but he based his up on his faith he based it upon god's promise and abraham now takes this wood and his burnt offering and lays it upon isaac his son this thing is progressing we're getting to the end of this battle we're getting to the end of this conflict that abraham's going through and having to see what god is wanting him to do and isaac received the wood for his own sacrifice he receives the wood from his own sacrifice from his father and carries it to the hill now let me tell you if my daddy told me he was going to kill me in a roundabout way i'm going to put i don't put the picture of the puzzle together i see the big picture all right we're going up here we got fire we got wood we got ropes to bind somebody with we got a knife but we don't have a lamp and i'm 16 17 years old man somebody fixing a fight either that or i'm fixing a run won't be no holding me on that mountain but there was something more to it there the bible says they have all of this and the bible says but the two of them went together you know what that means it literally means that the two of them went in agreement but when we look at abraham we think oh abraham's the father of faith and and and he's so obedient to the word of god but look at isaac we're talking about a young man that says god didn't speak to him he's going upon the promises of his daddy and he's saying god spoke to you i agree with your dad i'll do whatever you have me to do in agreement and he looks at him he said my son [Music] god will provide a lamb himself for this burnt offering abraham knew somehow that there was going to be a sacrifice and that god was going to offer something for sacrifice but where is this lamb where is this lamb what are we going to do where is this lamb how can we find this lamb we're going up into the mountains where there's no water there's rocks there's no vegetation there's nothing up there that can live where is this lamb that question has been asked all through the bible through the faithful from isaac to moses to david to isaiah all the way to john the baptist to where he finally says behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world where is this lamb and here we have a remarkable picture we have a picture of the work of jesus at the cross thousands of years before it ever happened we have a picture of the son of a promise willingly went to sacrifice in obedience to his father carrying the wood on his back up a hill upon the same mountain with full confidence that there will be a resurrection i hope this is not too too deep because i'm not a deep preacher and if i'm too deep we're in trouble as an obedient son isaac lays down this wood and he lays down this wood ready to be sacrificed and brothers and sisters abraham now stretches out his hand and takes this knife to slay his son and abraham there's completely willing to plunge this knife right into the heart of his own son willingly and able to do it but he's got a hope he's got a promise he's got a promise that if he has to go through with this and this is the way the sacrifice lays out he's got a promise in his mind that somehow god is going to raise him up and the prophet said he raised his hand and as he raised his hand the holy ghost caught it and the holy ghost called it and said abraham abraham he said here i am lord can you imagine the the elation he must have had when he heard that voice and he felt the holy ghost stop his hand and says here i am lord stay your hand don't touch the boy don't touch the boy i know you love me listen you wouldn't withhold your own son i know you love me abraham and about that time in a land where there's no lambs living and he hears this bleeding from behind him he looks around and there's a ram a little male sheep caught by his horns in the thick where did that ram come of it he said he was a hundred miles from civilization where did that lamb come from he's on top of this mountain where there's nothing no water how did he get up there it wasn't a vision it was a real lamb said he picked him up and he was kicking and bleeding and he laid him up there and he cut his throat and the blood run out it wasn't a vision it was a real lamb it was a real lamb where did it come from no wonder he called it jehovah jireh the lord provided he said god almighty who could speak himself into a body and speak angels into a body spoke that ram into existence and you're going to tell me we're going to worry about how we get to the other side of our promises when god says right there hundreds of miles from civilization he speaks a ram into existence and the prophet said that he can he can take and make a hole through a wall where you can go through it and he's telling me he can make a sea serpent come out of the lake of chicago that would smash it to the ground amen thank you and so here we have now into existence in one minute five minutes later it went out of existence he said for god is jehovah jireh no matter what the conditions are he'll provide himself a sacrifice when god asked abraham for an ultimate demonstration of love and commitment he asked for his son when god the father wanted to show us the ultimate demonstration of his love and commitment to us he gave us his son we can say to the lord now lord i know that you love me seeing that you have not withheld your son your only son from me do you see how these two turned on each other one goes right in and dovetails right into the other story here's the lamb that abraham goes up there and willingly gives his son a sacrifice because and god looks like he says i know you love me now abraham i know you love me but now we can look and say god i know you love me because you gave me your son your only son and abraham looks at that place and says i'm gonna name this place jehovah jairo notice that he didn't name it in the reference of what he experienced no he didn't name it mount trial he didn't name it mount agony or mount obedience instead he named it a hill for what reference to what god had done for him he named it mount provision see sometimes we walk up these mountains and it's step by step and day by day and we wonder when will i see the promise but just above the top there is a promise to be had isaac his life is a picture of jesus it becomes clear both were loved by their fathers both were offered themselves willingly jesus willingly offered his life carried that that wood upon his back up to the mount mount calvary isaac carrying the wood upon his back to mount provision both carried their wood up there both were sacrificed on the very same hill in the very same region and both were delivered on the same third day what a story we have here brothers and sisters as we close here there's no reason for us not to believe what god has promised us god has promised us a life and a life of abundance god has promised us a life and raptures at the end of this life god has offered us and given us a commitment to him that says we are his and because we're his he is that's ours so if you're walking up the hill today if you're walking up a mountain today and god has made you a promise i i challenge you to grasp on to that promise and say god i don't know how but the sacrifice will be made i don't know how i'll get there i don't know how i'll get what you've got for me but god i know that there will be a sacrifice made and i'm going to come out on the other side do you love him this morning musicians if you would come would stand to our feet i love i love breaking down stories and i know it's hard sometimes when you teach it it wears you out but we need good scriptural teaching because like i said it's the little things we overlook that may just be the little tidbits you need to get you through tomorrow if we could just all bow our heads go before the lord in prayer lord we thank you lord for this little service lord jesus and we thank you for the word lord as as it was given to us this morning lord and i know it sure touched my heart and things that were brought out that i'd never seen before and to know that when abraham and isaac was typing you and jesus and the sacrifice that would be made it was the first time that love was mentioned and there's no greater love than the love that uh that you have for your son and for the the love that jesus willingly went up on the cross of calvary and shed his blood for us a sacrifice a substitute for where i should have been this morning there's no greater love story to be told for that blood that was shed for sinners such as i so lord we worship you this morning we bowed down humbly before you this morning with humility and obedience lord jesus coming before you and just asking lord that you will continue to draw out the faith that's inside us that you will continue to strengthen that faith that is inside us lord lord we've heard the word preached for years we've heard of a rapture we've heard of uh of a translation of an instantaneous translation lord but build our faith a greater day by day by day that we could accept a transformation that's to take place because god no matter what we do if we will commit ourselves and be in obedience to you as abraham was we know that you will see us through [Music] and we thank you for that lord yes thank you lord jesus [Music] you're great this morning lord just thank you lord [Music] did you start singing that there brother david yes [Music] [Music] and i love that'll cross [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] last [Applause] yes [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hold that old rugged cross so despised by the world has
