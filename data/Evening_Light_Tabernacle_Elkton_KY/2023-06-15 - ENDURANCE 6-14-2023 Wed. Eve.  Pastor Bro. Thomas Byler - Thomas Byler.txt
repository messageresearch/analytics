Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord we'll just get into the word would that be all right amen I just want to Amen to kind of kind of continue on a little bit further on the same line of thought amen that we had um Sunday maybe just a little bit different but um so if you will turn your Bibles we will begin uh I guess with where we left off which would be in Hebrews 6. Hebrews 6 . I'm going to read that and then I want to kind of tell you where pretty much my thought came from and then we'll go from there Hebrews 6 and we'll begin with reading a scripture we read Sunday verse 13. for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured and that he obtained the promise for men barely swear by the greater and an oath of for confirmation is to them and end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the promised immutability of his counsel he confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible it was impossible for God to lie we might have strong consolation who have fled for Refuge till they hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the veil amen may God have his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen I wanna I was listening to several tapes this week and there is something that brother Benham said that kind of caught my attention and it just kind of let me down this road amen and so this is what he said in end time seed sign Tifton Georgia amen now he says now this is 1962 and what does the Bible say the Bible said in the last stage that the work be cut short for the scriptures cannot lie for The Elixir notice for the elect's sake or there be no flesh saved amen then we see and look at the Church look how it's swallowed up and stuff like in Satan just as easy and Satan has fed them this Corruption of hell and many thousands has believed it amen another place talked about it was like he said he uh I had to quote but it didn't bring he says it's like a great monster almost I mean that is just swallowed the people up the whole world and everybody is just swallowed up amen by the evil basically that is flooded out upon the Earth and that he also mentions he says talks about the work being cut short for the elect's sake or no flesh would be saved what is told meme kind of what it showed me let me just let me let me finish the oh Lord Jesus come Lord you said if the work wasn't cut short there'd be no flesh saved truly Lord we see in amen ourselves today we see the falling away the cooling off or May the remnant that escapes out of this Babylon may it rise and shine may you fill it with the power of God Amen May the Holy Spirit come upon it Lord amen and perform perform great things again and what shall I do with this Jesus called the Christ he says you're either in the Beast or the image of the Beast according to Revelations the Bible said you would be Jesus spoke of this not as communism but in Matthew 24 chapter beginning at 21st verse he says he predicts that the spirit of this system would be so much like the real thing that it would deceive the very elected if possible amen the elected whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and frankly it got them so tied up until he said if he didn't we'll cut the work Shard for their sake there'd be no flesh saved what does that tell us it tells me that it's going to be really bad if God has to cut the work short or the elected won't even make it isn't that what you're hearing here so it's very deceiving so Connie amen but we know that the elect won't be deceived and we want to talk about the elect with the help of the Lord again tonight A man talking about what who God knew before the foundation of the world wrote their name their names down how many believe that amen and they only the only those that who have that names on it I mean I really like really feel like the Holy Spirit led us on that talking about how to say you know the Bible and I never looked at even that scripture talking about seeing a scripture In a Different Light I mean I always thought you know the whosoever will just let him come that's opening God opening up the way but you know in another way it's actually calling 90 of the people amen come on but we know that so many don't have that thought they certainly don't have the desire to come all the way with Christ they have a desire everybody has The Thirst forgotten someone but not so much that they'd be willing to forsake all to follow him and to take up their cross and to even deny their self and die to theirself amen so they're not willing to go that measure Jesus and if you're not willing to forsake all to follow me you're not worthy to be my disciples amen so tonight's message this is going to be kind of different but I titled into something I've spoke on many times over the years here amen and it's honest speaking I'm going to retitle it I guess but we're going to talk about endurance but I want to call it deep roots I'll talk about Deep Roots amen is that okay praise the Lord let me establish first you know because I thought that I heard him say this and I said well where in the world did the Bible ever talk about him cutting the work short and I says I certainly don't want to go up there and just say something and and not have a scripture for it amen I believe everything should be back up by the scripture don't you amen it's found in Matthew if you want to go with me Matthew 24. amen Matthew the 24th chapter amen but that was the one thing that caught my attention when I was listening to end time seeds on because I'm kind of following and listening to them ever I I the um the spoken word is the Original Seed and then the next few of them just listening to what he said and then the end time seed sign kind of follows a chronological order and so forth and we kept talking about this and when he made that statement about the work being cut short for the elect's sake or there be no flesh saved amen that to me just kind of put me uh kind of on guard heads up isn't that right it's going to be tight I'm gonna be is it gonna be tied amen even if even the elect there's gonna come close it's going to come close that even the elect's gonna be deceived or misled isn't that right or not make it because it's so cunning amen and so I thought well Lord help us amen it's going to take something special for us to make it isn't it amen and it's found it's found in uh Matthew 24. reverse um 21 amen and he was talking about many false prophets Rising iniquity abounding and so forth many shall come a minute saying here's Christ and there is Christ and so forth but in verse 21 it says for then shall there be great tribulations such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and accept those those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved amen but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened amen amen so when you talk about the work of the Lord being cut short it's just hard to imagine that God would cut anything short but but like it talks about cutting something short to make sure that elect gets in amen praise the Lord now I want to go to our thought here I mean that was just established that you know you know and God is going to have to have an elect and what's going to be inside of this elect what we're going to be like now notice in verse 11 of the same chapter for many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax code but he that shall endure unto thee and the same shall be saved praise the Lord and I want to talk now about that endurance there's one thing that that goes along with endurances amen faithfulness and perseverance and so forth amen it takes into doors and I thought you know and I looked up what Siri had to say about endurance and it said the facts or power of enduring and unpleasant or difficult process or situation without giving way amen praise be to God you know what I thought you know I'll tell you what yummy knows that life is not just all up on the Mountaintop experience no Eddie I'll tell you what if you always was on the Mountaintop everything always went good and everything was always Pleasant you wouldn't have to endure nothing is that right and the Bible talks much we'll read a lot about it but it talks about thee that shall endure unto them there's many things to endure Amen in Hebrews 12 it talks about if you endure chastisement amen so we have to endure the chastisement about God almighty God we have to endure time itself we have to endure trials where there's a lot to have to endure sometimes you all got to endure me I gotta endure you amen isn't that right we got to endure amen endurance like I said again amen it means that it's not always going great and wonderful but it means that you have the power of in doing unpleasant and difficult process or a situation amen something that's hard something that's not easy amen until I thought you know that's really really what you're talking about is the valley him in the valley part of life is where or even a desert huh amen where you just think you know and even coming to this message I you know usually I get it real easy but I really had to struggle for this when I thought Lord you know it usually comes easy but Lord one will have whether you have for me to speak and I have to struggle to pray extra hard and spend more time and so forth hey man it's all but you know I believe God brought us to this but notice how he says that amen did he that endureth unto the end shall be saved way back in Revelations amen enduring is something going through a long prize of having long longevity or something like that I can't say that word right but yeah I think you get what I'm saying maybe another uh you gotta you have length you got to be able to endure hey man go through the process you know and so but over in in uh Revelations the second chapter in samurna church age the second Church age of course we know it's when uh when so many hundreds of thousands of Christians were being killed he says you know fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that they may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days there was 10 years of real tribulation amen where they just slaughter them to them slaughtered the Christians Real by he says be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life I thought that goes along with he that is endureth unto the end the same shall be saved praise the Lord hallelujah cause I'll tell you I'll be honest with you you know because we see it so much don't we we see so much to where people start out in the race but they don't finish it we got a lot of attitudes sitting right here because people that went so far but they just couldn't keep on going sometimes many many years and how many knows that time wears or time wears on me it wears on you those Christians in the Dark Ages they got tired of living and they'd be in the caves and hide and so forth but they get tired of this and I'm gonna go ahead and man they go out there and let them know they're a Christian to get fed the lives it's over with but you know with you when I it's a lifetime it's a whole life long a long long time and every day the devil gets another hit at you he'll get to he'll get to you know have another hit that or God allows you to go through more trials amen and you have to have endurance we are not in a 50-yard Dash amen we're not in the 50-yard Dash folks we're in a marathon and how what how many knows any but he can run a 50-yard Dash I can run to the background up to the front even though I'm as old as I am I can still run a little Sprint but it ain't gonna be very long hello why but you in order to have to be able to run a marathon you have to have endurance amen how many knows any endurance Runners are running a little bit run a little more run a little more run a little more running until they finally get the distance to where they can actually do it amen and that's what you and I are are on is on a marathon praise be to God amen amen I believe Paul he's he talked about it that way he says no ye not the thing which run in the race run all but one receiveth the prize so run amen oh this comes to mind how many even Jesus said when you uh take up the cross count the cost whenever you're building a tower see if you're able to finish it or not how many believes that when you're going to be a Christian if you're ever going to give your young people if you're ever gonna give your life to God remember this you gotta say that I'm oh and then all my life my whole life everything about me I give it to you then God will fill you with the Holy Ghost and give you the power that you need to finish the thing otherwise you'll never make it amen because I'll tell you what there's just too many that don't make it amen it's sad amen it's coming real fast can I just say when you realize brother John that Lord's held you for so many years amen how many knows it's the Lord holding you it's the Lord that gives you that endurance the fact that you're still here and the fact that you believe that it's been God that has held you here and you're still running the race we're still here it ought to make you happy to realize hey that that's a that's a good sign that you're probably one of those elected amen praise be to God you're still striving now notice one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that strives for the Mastery is temperate in all things not only knows what Temperance Temperance from what I understand is self-control boy the world doesn't have a lick of self-control they will paint their eyeballs huh taint everywhere you know a tattoo or two isn't good enough no it's got to be everywhere come on control yourself now there's no such a word is there now not to any of them out there don't seem like temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crowd and then of course he goes on to settlement into the 10th chapter I don't really want to get into that but he talks about Israel uh the fathers were under the cloud they passed in the Red Sea they were baptized under Moses they all eat spiritual Manna amen but Jesus said they were everyone dead think about it they started in his race but they couldn't finish it it didn't finish it isn't about starting it's about getting to the finish line I love about you but that's why this is God I am determined I'm gonna get to the finish line praise God that you have that determination that's God putting that determination in you everybody else is just chilling well I guess maybe maybe not come on folks you've done relaxed way too much already amen all right all right so they started but I want to go to I want to talk a little bit about this because when I think about endurance I want to go to Matthew up no Mark turn with me to Matthew and I want to read another I want to once again read a scripture we're very familiar with that I've read just here maybe in the last few weeks but I want to read it again mark IV and he began to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so he had entered into a ship and sat in the sea sat in the sea the whole multitude was by the Sea on the land and he taught them many things in Parables saying unto them in his Doctrine heart and behold there went out and so were to sow and it came to pass it as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up the sun fell on Stony ground where it had Earth and immediately it sprang up but because it had no depth of verse when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root we're going to talk about that root for a little bit is that all right now notice Jesus himself it withered away and some fellow among thorns and they grew up and so forth but the other verse 8 fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some a hundred so what is it that causes a Christian to actually bear fruit and get something is because they have the right root system they have the right dirt praise be to God Jesus explains it a little bit later on if you'll notice let's go all the way we're just gonna go to verse 14. Not A sower sowed the word so with the word and these are the by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown into hearts these are likewise which are sown on Stony ground which who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness but have no root Hallelujah no root in themselves and so notice this is our words and I Endure but for a little time amen now it's enduring for a little time okay no no he that endureth unto the end how many believes God is looking for those who endure all the way to the end words when Affliction and persecution arises for the word sake immediately they are offended there's two groups that I want to talk about and that is this group here a man who had no ground didn't have enough ground they had a little bit of ground and they come to church and say praise the Lord I believe that amen hallelujah give my heart to God Rejoice for a while they run the house they scream they shout they're on fire but by and by stefire on the dwindle the fire go down amen wouldn't it be nice if God just had us on the Mountaintop all the time but you know what we'd be if God did that we'd be a bunch of jellyfish what do you think about I think about when I think about uh a steadfastness when I think about both sure and steadfast I think about roots how many knows that that's why I read that first scripture you know that we have him amen his word him in it is both sure and steadfast somebody that endures they made an Affliction whatever opposition comes they endure without giving way Hallelujah think about it I think about a tree that's planted by the rivers of water I think about these trees when winds come is that right I think about these blown over trees sometimes many many Big Dreams but other trees they don't aren't blown over well and it has to do with the root system folks I'm not talking about that please I'm talking about you hey man why do we why are you not blowed over I'm here to tell you it's because of your own system it's because of that there's roots that has went way down here they've been planted by the water you've been giving lots of water a minute the trees have been a little one come by amen and it might pulls you up but guess what it causes that rooting to go deeper to go deeper and deeper those Pharisees those scribes they thought that they had Deep Roots they went all the way back to Abraham amen Moses with their Prophet but Jesus said amen you're of your father the devil you haven't got a deep enough amen I want you to know tonight how many gods and we don't go back to Abraham we don't go back to that we go all the way back by the god before the foundation holds you did your name is in the book Nation laughs my mouth if that don't do something to you I don't know I will to think that root systems in your heart we're not a bunch of jellyfish let me know you get a bigger law you get a jellyfish out and hold it up here hey man you drop it what's gonna do five foot and you'll have a five foot splatter but you take a dog oh you think that wrecks we can be thrown around we can fall we can jump we can do all new things right but we still survive if you kill some something with a backbone how many at least we need to have backbone that's where our strength comes from and our backbone amen is right here not a jellyfish oh my but you gotta have a root system I like that I thought about that that's right those Pharisees thought you know if we have Abraham as our father Jesus said ain't gonna cut it not good enough and they could no doubt Trace their lineage back to Abraham I'm of the tribe of Levi I'm trying to rub and I'm tired of this out of the other but he needs to go further than that didn't it needs to go further than that praise the Lord Hallelujah let's look at something for just a minute over in James he said take my brethren James 5 and verse 10 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience how many knows endurance and patience go hand in hand oh my Hallelujah remember what we read early and so after God's War by himself saying surely I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will pull up must have multiplied thee so after Abraham had patience definitely endured life isn't always about easy sometimes it's about endurance young people that's the way it is in a marriage she can be in church it can no matter where you are your job sometimes it takes endurance and Abraham had to have endurance after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise I think about it I think about after we have patiently endured after we have been patient on God folks I know people in this message said they're raptured done took place they said the sure the Lord came in the spirits in the form of the Holy Ghost but what did Brother bam say I think Perugia people were were but they don't even look for his Carnival the Lord Jesus Christ huh literal Return of the Lord Jesus Christ these same people of course they didn't need a pastor anymore brother but better Tommy they had come to perfection see that perfect love when you got that perfect love you have to that one that which is perfect this calm then that would just farted and gotten away with but we got that boy found out they weren't so perfect they're out in the world scattered today folks no words to be found you get off the word a little bit folks and it ain't long you're way off that's why I believe any manager and myself we have to stick with that we'll say right there with that word when you leave that word everything we preach everything it's got to be lined up with that word because when you leave that there's no telling how far you'll go but anyway let me finish this scripture so now notice he says our example of suffering Affliction and of patience in this something how James here mentions behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job amen and we have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy so now here they mentioned job as suffering Affliction I mean no job well he endured I I want to try to grasp it really and I don't think I can I don't think any of us really can having nine beautiful children that love the Lord having sheep knocks and have everything you can possibly imagine everything God's blessed him knowing that that we didn't get it through deceit he didn't steal and Rob to get ready no it was all God's blessing everything yeah and he offered God sacrifices every day he'd make sure everything was right huh just in case it's wrong or I'm offering a special sacrifice forgive him keep them all undercover blood and then for all of that happening all of his children dying on about a six o'clock news com a messenger comes in and he tells them all these things I think it was different Messengers that came in and told him this also happened that also happened that also happened that also happened huh and he worshiped job actually worship you talk about the patience of Job you talk about it wasn't joyful I mean sometimes you know Christian walk it isn't Joy it's sorrow it's sad you never lose that peace and that love for God but you still experience a sadness and you have to endure just kind of push through it just keep going how many is with me let me knows what it's like to have it go through life and come to the places where you really you just you know you're just keeping on going not that you hate the Lord or not want to serve God I don't believe we want to do that but it's just that it's so hard the road gets long your own gets hard and people forsake you friends forsake you huh yeah that's right it will get long and hard and gets lonely and you just have to endure amen that's the way it was with job he had to just endure and guess what after he passed that test he worshiped the Lord said the Bible says he worshiped God saying the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord job had endurance then the Devil Comes again read the next chapter whatever comes again says have you considered my job yeah all that a man has you'll give and so forth but touch his body and then it'll be a different story God says all right touch his body the only thing you can't do is kill him everything can we say something everything but kill him you can do a lot all except don't quite kill him just about kill him but not quite kill him he cursed the day he was born let the moose this Moon not shine to sign that shine and all these uh oh he just popped the job and on and on and on it was sad it was so miserable boils all over him sitting on ash Heap on the pit of misery God's greatest man on the Earth in that kind of misery I mean it was it endurance patience patience people aren't patient people don't endure but he did and then I find you know if they're going to be in that condition that to be better for him to just to go to a better place well she didn't want to see him suffer you've been suffering I don't know we have no word oh this is Africa the ending you have no hope you had everything's coming out of it why don't you just go ahead and curse God and die that I think about the thing that God puts inside of you and inside of me is that right because that was not just job that was something that God had seen and placed in job because the main thing that the devil come up to God about was I'll make him curse you to your face I'm making cushion when that woman spoke cursed God or something rose up woman I love you but you fool you speak like a foolish woman huh our speakers like a foolish moment the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen it's God that's seen that in job that's why he took he did God didn't take the challenge God gave the challenge is that right Satan come into the congregation God says have you considered my servant though I got something for you to try out he instigated the challenge amen where Satan comes in like a flood God knows he sets up a standard against it he knows what's in you remember brother Branham brother Branham is another example of a prophet who impatiently endured in that right affliction when his wife passed away when his baby got passed away and Leonard Brandon was begging God to save spare Sharon Rose he had done laid hands on many people people he knew God was a Healer but he wouldn't heal oh his baby because he didn't go when God said to go in the right and God was taking him home and he wanted God to do it and the devil come to him and talked to him and said you know you know he don't love you and why are you can you serve a God Like That he could never say that there wasn't a God or a deceited him in that lesson brother Ben was just about to say something is that right he was thinking he tells us on the book what he thought if God's gonna be like that that's how God's going to be but he says no Devil he's just get thee behind me hello and he said the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord later on somebody come up and ask him brother bad I'm sure all of that did you hold your religion did you hold you what did he say no no I did that but he held me how many blades he endurance that you have it's not you it's God put that endurance in you thank you God for endurance this world foreign enduring this world to come your way endurance because your root Boutique go deep how many of these are roots go deep they go all the way back I believe is Paul said one playing dead we are planted in Christ we're planted in Christ amen you have seen the end of the Lord now turn with me if you will to Hebrews again let's look at the Lord for a minute let's look at the Lord Hebrews 12 verse 1 wherefore see we are compassed about we're so great a cloud of witnesses can we stop there for a minute don't keep reading we're compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses what was that such there's those around of us that are saying you can make it I mean please those Witnesses saying you can go you can do it because there's another company of witnesses that say nah can't do it I mean not what Israel the spies said we're not able to take away we can't do it you know how many times that if Israel failed to have that endurance they failed to have that patience in hard times they kept wanting to go back to the garden with the God we were in Egypt at least have something to eat wasn't there enough graves in Egypt to bury us and are we wanting to go back Lord help us a real Christian we don't want to go back there ain't no going back it's only going forward why we're more than able we have a great great company of witnesses all rebel I mean Hebrews 11 that we just got finished talking about uh Ray Urban and then get in and oh Abraham and even God himself speaking the world into existence and Moses are forsaking Egypt and all of those all those Witnesses amen cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience to race that is set before us amen I heard brother Brown talking about he says Lord a little bit of life that I have left let me use it for you and I thought that's my prayer Lord Jesus what life I have left what breath I have left what energy I have left Lord let me use it to serve you and to bring honor and glory to your name amen because time is so swiftly fleeting amen I didn't read it but rather Branham he was when he we talked about something of some of these things he talked about every 2000 years he says something major happens he says we got 36 years left according to that calendar and he says or there would be no flesh saved if you don't get saved it doesn't come within that time frame which he says we don't know when he is coming but according to the calendar he said it'll be two thousand years and then he says the scientists and different ones say that our calendar is so far off we're off by 17 years that we're still already 17 years further down the road than what do you barely even thinking so it's late how many believe that let us run the race with patients that set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher maybe like that don't you of our faith praise be to God aren't you glad that it's he that started this race for you and that it's him that gives you the endurance to keep on going my that just makes me want to run around through every Fire Patch through every trial through every test because God knows his world amenities race and this that we're running amen he's got mountains it's got balance it's got long deserts folks it's easy to serve God when you're on the Mountaintop don't need endurance but when you get down in them long valleys folks I don't know what it's like to have like about a 10-year Valley 10 years a valley hello how long you know you know what why did God do that he gives you little trials to build your endurance then he gives you a little longer trials to give you more endurance then he gives you greater trials to give you more endurance I'm here to tell you with God you can go through anything there ain't nothing you can't go through if you have God can I say something else there ain't no telling what you might have to go through brother Tommy never expect that award a thing to show up right just like that all of a sudden he may not live another hour or two huh life-changing whole mind changing you know completely rock your world so to speak hello whatever it might be we don't know what lays ahead but we know him that lays or has our future in his hands praise be to God okay now looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set down before him enjoy going to the cross no it was the hardest thing he ever did because he was human I mean as he was human death was not something that he wanted to do not favorable to the flesh say you say that's exactly right because he said Lord father if it be possible that this could pass from me that was the flesh then the spirit spoke and said nevertheless not my will but thine be done I believe brother Brown said the greatest battle that he ever fought is the greatest battle was in The Garden of Gethsemane between himself his will and God's will let me tell you something I'm going to do this that's where all of our greatest battle is right there between your will or is it going to be God's will that's the battle right there and it was a battle with him he endured the cross I've just like brother Benham he had he had to come down to the place where he's either gonna reject God and say no I ain't doing this no more God you took my wife and baby I quit I'm done huh or he's going to say the lord gave the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord and brother bran said every child of God comes down to that place God will take you all the way to the bottom amen he'll take you right to that place to where he'll either have that that he placed in there or you won't have it amen and I Think Jesus gave a perfect example of people that you know go for a while but and by and by they're offended I'm by they're gone all right so now notice endure the cross despising the shame it wasn't didn't enjoy being stripped of all of his clothes totally humiliated totally humbled I mean all of his disciples every one of them forsook him the offersook him Peter remember he says I'll never forsake you I'll never you know they'll never take you out and Jesus says before the cockroached you'll deny me Thrice Peter didn't have a deep root system did he he didn't have a very deep root system why because he wasn't born again now let me ask you this how many knows that anybody that's not born again is not got a very deep root system not until you're born again when you're born again of the spirit of God planted in Christ Jesus you have become a part of almighty God then you've got a deep deep root system so much so that Peter when they got to crucifying him isn't that right he says don't crucify me up right like it did the Lord I'm not worthy to be killed the way that he was hang me upside down huh that's right he had a deep root system amen now all right now notice endure the cross despising the shame and it set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself least he be weary and faint in your minds how many believes that's what happens with people too many people are fainting to passing out can't go on anymore just can't go on anymore just can't go on anymore amen how many of us will come to that place where boy we just don't know if we can keep on going huh but then something happens isn't that right Give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord thank you for that something that happens and to get back up okay you have to keep on going because there's something in here God has planted and it's called predestination it's called election it's called being a child of God how many believes that our genetics you have to be a gene seed of God brother bran said folks we are not tied to some Earthly man we are tied to the master himself our genetics go right back to his genetics we have we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Gene of his Gene but the band says if you're not a gene of God you'll never come to it amen you'll never unless you are a seed Gene of almighty God you'll never I'll say that man trace your lineage how many please we've got to trace your limit Trace Your Roots amen like you've heard the family tree people like I'll tell you what the Bible or book I I don't even bother looking at it I'd be so confused
