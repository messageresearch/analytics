========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning brothers and sisters it's good to be in the house of the Lord beautiful day outside beautiful day inside we just stand this morning Joe will open us in prayer this morning now this heard people ch people do amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school if you'll go in the Psalms with me to Psalms 61 a little short Psalms here Psalm 61 Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer for th for me in a strong tower from the enemy for thou oh Lord has heard my vows thou has given me of those thy name he shall abide before God forever oh prepare mercy and Truth May preserve him so will I sing praise un thy name forever that I may daily perform my vows God bless you may be seated brother Brian is there said um for sheltered for me in a strong tower from the enemy so the word of God that's your strong tower the presence of that's your strong tower I know in our age it's when you read something like that go back a thousand years or 500 years into a different time in a different age where if you were a society a strong tower or you didn't have an aous area that you could defend yourself when the enemy came everything that you worked stolen by another people and it's no different for us this morning our Strong Tower is the word of God and the presence of Jesus Christ and that's what you fory yourself beond morning no matter what your circumstances are out there this morning I'm just one man I don't know what where each person is sitting here this morning I don't know where you're at but Jesus Christ does and I know that the word of God is just as powerful this morning and it's just Faith you have to have faith in the word of God and presence that of Christ that's been given to you this morning anything outside of that you'll be in and you'll be out you'll be up and down but if you're if you're Rock is in the word of God and the presence of Jesus Christ and there's nothing to be afraid of in this world that we live this morning and I'm already off morning as some of you know already I uh turn the heat on this week so the uh the me are spinning for the next couple of months uh with me to I'm trying to decide where to go this which direction to go but you know people have been praying and we in the back room you know I'm six I'm past that point I'm not a young man no more but brother Glenn knows when I was on active duty when you when you want to live a Christian Life want to set an example to the people or the men around you that life to lead is not an easy life especially when you're alone and by yourself and you have to be willing no matter what people think about you whatever the circumstances are you just have to move out in faith and whether you talk you you know just like the brother Joe how it became a Christian it almost separated me completely experience you know being raised as a Catholic boy when I accepted Christ as my savior when I went back to my family I can they didn't receive it very well even my parents didn't receive it well but you have to put people you care about people but your whole desire your whole purpose in life is to walk the path that Christ morning and I'm trying to find a place to start this morning some of you might be laughing about that but uh let's go to Philippians um fourth chapter I wrote I was listening to some messages this morning uh let me find where I have these not at this morning but this is this goes to Philippians the 4th chapter you know if there's any chapter there's numerous chapters I could say you can't read enough in a day you know one of them for me would be Corinthians the 5th chapter and Philippians the third and fourth chapter if you need encouragement those would be the chap to read this morning but I kind of in um this is from the homepage on recing and I this is a a the quote and uh some of you know where I'm going some of you probably uh it really speaks to the age that we live in uh I'll just read it it's from blind bear uh mys again are all messed up as I get I can't even pronounce that but I'll just read what brother brandham had to say it and this goes back to another quote I have I carry around it's right Philippian this quote from the uh healing thoughts book and the premise of it same no matter what and he goes on to say here these things that are positive and that's really important for an if you're one of those people that see everyone is different if you're don't want to be the person a negative in everything we do you know that that that you hear people speak there's a guy that always looks half dampy and the other guy that looks at a glass as half full we want to be the one or I want to be the one to look situation as being on a positive s what brother random had the S think on these things that are positive never let a negative pass through just don't let it stop anyhow so every day his goal is to get you to be thinking on stuff that has no meaning that has a negative connotations to it he's trying to push you away from being positive and keep your positive and on what the good way to positive thoughts this morning is always putting your mind on Christ on Jesus Christ this morning if you're thinking about him you won't be negative you can't be negative and think about Jesus Christ it's impossible it's a it's a positive thing you can't be negative if you put your hope in that this morning and he goes on to say don't think heing a don't think sitting here in a wheelchair you or helpless you're not don't let the negative thought ever pass though or don't you can't help from going through your mind that's right don't let it stop and he goes on and say you all know where this last you've um brother Glover whoever was talking brother Thomas was talk to say like the old farmer said I can't keep from flying over my place everyone know you can't keep the birds over your mind constantly your enemy is going to try to put those say here but he had a double barrel shotgun and I can I can sure keep them from roosting so you so you you too see don't let them Roost don't let them pass right on gone through and I you know in life it's easy to say a thing it's hard to do a thing and that's what you have to do you have to do the thing you have to not allow those evil thoughts or those bad thoughts to possess your mind or heart and I'll just um I want to read this fourth chapter I say that and I and uh but it goes on to I just wrote some notes I was listening to another message this morning before I read that chapter other thing iom say this morning is that your healing and your blessings aren't really are based faith not on your salvation there are things you reach out in faith believing going to do those things for you and you have to have your your mind has to be stable it has to be reaching out the presence of Jesus Christ and for those things this morning and back to this chapter here this morning I'll just read here in the fourth chapter of uh it says therefore my brethren dearly beloved and long for my and Crown so stand the Lord my beloved so he's telling his and Tion are going to be brutal again this morning Beech edus and beseech s mind in the Lord and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow help those women with me in the gospel with clment also and with the other my fellow laborers who in The Book of Life we're no different we all are working to a purpose here this morning on to say rejoice in the lord always and I again to say rejoice so no matter what the you have you can rejoice in the word of God and in the in Jesus Christ this morning don't me take away your joy this morning if you doesn't getting out there in the world to be full of people that have no joy and what's funny about it they're G to do everything they can to take your joy away from you and he goes on I entreat thee also trth I've read that already as always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known that goes with what was said this morning so far and the peace of God all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally and this this scripture this eth verse here enough are true and whatsoever things are honest and what just whatsoever thing are pure and whatsoever thing are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things and these are the things that to think on every day not and he goes on to say these things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you and I'll just finish I don't I was about to say something I'm not going to say it but I was just thinking this morning of our circumstances before I I'm just this is I've got I was just I was reading a a man that wrote a study long ago and it kind of speaks to this what I was thinking about this morning in the age that we live in where we're at right now you know you hear ministers tell you one thing in church and another thing when you get to work those days are over with the days of playing around with the Gospel of Jesus Christ are over with now I could say something like that but does it really have any meaning I can only speak for myself does it have any meaning for me in my life and as I get older I realize all the things that I but I'll just I'll just read this I read this a lot here this is out of that healing thoughts book but I really don't have a lot else to say without getting probably getting in trouble this morning but I'll just finish this and I read I read this a lot when I'm by myself and my stuff study in the a lot I read this that's why I keep it in my Bible and this comes out of spiritual adoption you all have read this before but I'll read it again and finish with that this morning and we all know brother random said in order to stay with God stay gentle and that's re really important and I know in my own life as I get older it's you need to stay gentle you can't let the circumstances of Life make angry or frustrated and I know sometimes I don't live up to that but he goes on to say God is gentle stay with God stay with love God is love stay Meek don't ever be self-sufficient I got to raise my hand there I that's thing I have to work on I try to do things myself instead of letting God do them don't ever be self-sufficient always rely upon him never use your own mind take his thoughts and that goes back to what I was reading this morning of very thoughts have to be possessed with the word of God this morning those are his thoughts this morning when you read the word of God that's the very thought of God expressed to us as human beings this morning take them into your carnal mind and repeat them over and over say oh God take away all my doubt away and let my thoughts be your thoughts and I know that's something I have to do every day put you know when I get so caught up with the circumstance I have to go and be quiet enough to let the the word of God have its effect in my own life and he says just to Cast Away the thoughts of sickness takes God healing let them become your thoughts think on these things and it's not just healing if you're having family problems if you're having financial problems whatever those problems it's not just healing problems if you put your mind to it and you just surrender to God and let him take control of the circumstances I know I know in my own I've seen it he's more than able to bring about whatever you desire this morning so if Brother David would come if we could this morning sing course I Love You Lord and I lift my voice this morning with all your heart amen he's been so good to us this morning amen oh I love you Lord and

remember each one that has already been prayed for we thank you for their healing Amen in Jesus name amen praise the Lord amen let's turn our Bibles amen um to the book of Philippians book of Philippians amen and we want to try to take a little tour in our mind amen back before the foundation of the world once again amen before we get to the core of our message and then once we get amen maybe to our to our core so don't fall asleep on me while we're to get to where we want to go amen so praise the Lord Philippians 2 amen and we'll through five if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of Love of any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like my having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through Strife or Glory but in liness of Mind Let each esteem other better amen better than them look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Amen in First Corinthians 2 1 Corinthians 2 amen remember how I spoke of how uh through Luther uh it was typed that through Luther Luther it was a restoration amen of the fullness of Christ coming back to church a't that right and he was represented as walking by faith the just shall walk by faith Wesley was the chest and so forth amen up in here with sanctification of the spirit and so forth and then Pentecost was of course uh to speaking in tongues a't that right you were like up here amen and then our Prophet was to seeing he was the Seer he could look uh you know God would show him visions and he could tell the thoughts and intents of people's heart ain't that right amen and then of course faculty above that is of course your mind amen so we're in the mind age and we want to talk about the mind of Christ with the help of the Lord for a little while this morning would that be okay so 1 Corinthians 2 and verse4 it says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for there are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who ha known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ amen Give the Lord a hand thank you Lord that we can have your mind amen how many wants to think his thoughts amen you got to think his thoughts confession amen if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved you got to say what he said amen because it's the enemy that wants us to think our thoughts amen or his thoughts and that's sometimes much easier to do what we realize may God add blessings to the reading of the word you can be SE amen praise the Lord amen I just love I just love amen to think about what is in the mind of God you know how I say sometimes man I'd like I wish I could get in his mind to see what he's thinking you know and and and that's the it is with God you know because we know that we've already talked Paul had talked about the mystery that had been hid for ages and gener generation is now being made known the manifold wisdom of almighty God in other words the purpose of God is being made known amen and so his plan is made being made known amen what was in the mind of God is being expressed and it's being lived out amen so there is absolutely nothing nothing that ever comes our way that catches God off guard it's not a surprise to him amen no he already knows he knew before the first Stardust was ever made now let's go back as we begin to think about God and we know of course through the mind of the Prophet because you know in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall be the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets is that right and so even the church first two three chap chapters of Revelation talks about the seven Messengers The Seven Stars to the seven Church ages and so forth you know all of that was made known the mystery of God the revelation of the Seven Seals it was opened up amen and it shows how the Antichrist would work and actually where he came in at and that's where we found serpent seed and how that H You Know Thy Sheed you know he says thy seed shall bruise his heel and so forth talking about the serpent had his seed there in the Garden of Eden is that right and we find out St John there it says you know well actually over in Matthew I believe it says Jesus said when he talked about the world being a field isn't that right and the good so went forth and he sowed good seed and he says the evil one also came and sowed evil seed and at the end of it when he was explaining it to the uh the the disciples you know they said explain us to US mean about the the the parable of the tears and the wheat he says well the I'll tell you he says the tears the actually the the wheat are the children of the king Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one Amen in the CH John in in 1 John or I believe it's 1 John 3:12 somewhere in there amen it says that we don't do the works of the devil but he says not like that Wicked one not as Cain who was of that Wicked one so that linked Cain to being of that Wicked one and he showed that that's how the devil sowed his seed amen and when God came right write down to Cain and he says Cain just do what your brother does just do what your brother does and you'll be accepted cuz he was jealous cuz he had church he had offerings he worshiped God Cain did how many knows and it's the same cane today some people will worship God some people claim that they believe the Lord Jesus Christ of yesterday amen that he Calvary isn't that right but when he comes and he does the very same thing today they reject him and what you do with Jes Jesus today is what you would have done with him then that's the problem amen believe I will brother Tommy I'll get fired up here in a minute amen and mean I was listening to a tape and and and and brother brand come across and he was said something and then I wanted to say it and I said well I just replay that so I went back a little bit amen and God has provided a way in 1956 he says there's never been a time in the history of the world at any age or any time where the gospel of the power of God has been demonstrated like it is right now how many believe that seven times around the world that it was not about the man bre brandom but it was about Jesus Christ coming and doing the very same thing that he did when he walked the shores of Galilee that hasn't been done all through the dark amen the Hindu 30,000 if we talk we want a book of act let me 3,000 Souls were saved in one day no he says it was the Hindu and the Buddha and all of them when that Blind Man's eyes came open and he says I challenge your Gods all of your Gods come up here and open this Blind Man's eyes and then I'll serve your god brother benam said ain't that right but if my Lord Jesus had resurrected to th000 years ago will open up his eyes will you accept him amen he said 30,000 raw naked and women raise their hands we accept him when he opened up and they put clothes on themselves that's what the Holy Ghost will do amen praise be to God 10 times the book of Acts but that people won't believe it you can open up the you can raise the dead 13 different people raised under that Ministry is that right little girl that doesn't have any eyeballs doesn't have any eyeballs amen and he prays for him and prays for her amen prays for her to have eyes amen and then before he ends he says oh by the way what color would you like what color would you like Glory when he open up I guarantee that they were the very color that she desired I'm here to tell you God Has Come such a this message has come God has such a message that it should give you rapturing [Applause] Faith that's right there's no other message coming this is the last message the last Angel seventh angel because we know the destruction is coming Sodom and gomor is here confusion is here religious confusion is here but God came to give us a clear path and to make us to know that it wasn't brother brandom it wasn't some other it was Jes in brother brandham it was God in you God in be that he is the one that gets the he's the one that gets the honor amen amen aren't you glad for that can I finish the quote all right let me go back notice never in the history of the world wow that's a big word what did Noah say what was his message it's going to rain it's going to rain you don't read where he did discernment the thoughts and the hearts and all that right the sign of the Messiah and all the Miracles and all of that happened he had a simple message but in this age and the reason that it's so important that God sends something that you can know that you know that you know that you know that you know how many knows that you know that you know that you know there's not even one little shadow of a doubt you'd be a fool to try to talk me out of this why because it's not man it's God it's God this message is God's message God help us to get rid of every doubt every smidgen of Doubt of the word of God Amen praise the Lord my and it did how many knows it shall be light in the evening time the Bible says there'll be day that'll be neither night no but it'll be dismal day that was down through the Dark Ages Luther Wesley Amish men and all of that kind of well you know but in the evening time you're going to know that you know you're going to be able to see very clear amen when he comes up here said now if I am a servant of God if I've told you the truth if Jesus don't come back it up you don't have to believe a word I said how many knows he would come every time I'll read you a few stories here after a while if I have time amen of the times amen I might as well go there while I'm there and let's just go there we'll go back to our original thought here in a minute all right let's look at what happened amen got a few pages here it's good I got blown not blony I got I got ters we got green beans this morning we got some pecon pie cherry pie or whatever CH pie you like it's some good stuff folks this is some good stuff cuz even God told Brother B he says you store up those tapes you store up food this is spiritual food amen that that little widow woman's going to need in the time of this spiritual drought when everybody ain't got a Clapp in the church they ain't got a hallelujah amen they're dried and dead up that's going to be somebody that's full of life they've been eating on the and they feel good W that's right that's right aren't you glad for spiritual food that's been stored up amen praise the Lord there was this woman that she come here and she was on crutches and she came to the pr prayer line she walked and up I said lady you come to the meeting because someone told you that you should come you don't even have you don't even believe in in this faith that a upset her and she says well I belong to a certain certain church and I love my church I said you should do that but you've got to believe you've got to believe and she says well can I help and uh uh she said well can you help me I said no ma'am I can't I said your help will have to come with your individual faith in the finished work of Christ amen and she says well I believe that and I says will you believe it with all your heart she said yes and then I said well then I looked at her again and the Darkness that was over her had left Don't Clap just yet it's not a good story and I said now look back again in the darkness was listen uh uh it had left and I said Do you believe with that do you believe me to be his servant remember when the angel of God came and commissioned to prophet he says if you can get the people to believe you why cuz brother bam was right under God he was God's right- hand man amen and he would speak when he would speak he would let any time go back to the tapes and see what he said it was Christ speaking through him amen do you believe with all his heart you got to believe oh my isn't that a great word believing okay now where we at that now notice right the darkness had left do you believe me to be his servant yes and I said then I want you to walk up there to the end of the stairs and throw away your crutches and walk down off the platform and she says you expect me to do that being on these crutches for all these years not the right word not Faith amen after being these all these years and I said now I thought that you said you beli me I said now you'll always be on those crutches then they brought in an old woman the ushers was half they said her back there about five or six rows that was at Houston Texas the night before a few nights before this big picture was taken there of the big at the Houston col before that picture was taken we all know the story of some critic putting his face up in his F and everything and trying to the make so that the pictures would come in the next really to show him that was the only picture that developed the only picture that was taken was that Pillar of Fire over his amen when that was taken listen just before that and the ushers had got her up and some young man had give her a seat and they sat her down and the poor old thing so crippled and the blessing that she should have went to this woman there stood that light over that work woman circling around that old woman and I looked at her and I said sister you are a Believer huh see no doubt this church that this other lady went to didn't believe in this kind she says you don't believe in this Faith but Abraham sought it she didn't but she believed just enough to say I believe you're I believe you I believe you're a servant of God I believe you can help me and that shadow left her that right but the second she confessed the wrong thing you mean after all these years huh you expect me to do that and what happened no doubt that shadow came back and the pillar fire went somewhere else amen but this woman she said yes I'm a Believer and I said they just brought you here by plane you come from Ohio she said that's right she said that's right and I said because you've been following the meeting several uh meetings trying to get in and you've never been able to arrive at the right time said yes that's right and I said Jesus you stand up and throw away your crutches that woman couldn't hardly move she threw her crutches and run around the building just as hard as she could run screaming and shouting it was her faith amen see no matter what this woman didn't have faith and this woman did praise the Lord amen so God come in this generation what did he do did the supernal how he knows this is almost every surface thinks like this would happen almost every every service how could this generation of people not believe amen judgment going to be quite something in it when all the secrets of men's hearts are made known and amen if you can believe you need to thank thank you Lord for I can believe blessed are your eyes for the see they see seeing not amen but we have eyes to see blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears if you can hear the truth amen praise the Lord that's right the power of God has been demonstrated like it is like it is never before like it is right now through radio television through faithful ministers amen and he and he put it to other ministers also into the missions Fields into the hot and tots and Africa to China into different places great healing revivals and powers and works and signs and wonders coming from everywhere never was in all the world like it friends God has provided it God has it God has performed it and God is here this morning he has provided you with everything that you have need of how many believe that he has provided us with everything that we have need of amen amen so there was God before the of the world and we know that he wasn't even God at one time God means an object of workship he was just the self-existing one he existed all by himself I thought on I thought about this on the way to church I thought you know I love to think about God what what kind of a being what kind of a being is able to make Earth the Sun the Moon to stars and hang all of that wo does do something to you think there is a being in the universe that made all of this made you he made me he made everything without him and there was nothing made but what was made by him everything was made by him Amen Let me just tap into the future just a little bit one of the things that this is done with this cancer and this thing that the God has allowed amen it has made and I've heard Donna say it and it certainly applies to me and I'm sure it applies to you amen but this whole thing has made amen this seem like a new book these words of faith and believing it's just takes on a whole new meaning man I going into my search subject just a little bit further brother Tommy if I'm not wrong before your aarta episode youed a little LAX on God is that right felt like he was just in a hum drum a little Lolly kind of just kind of hum drumming around and I want to talk to you here after a little bit about the purpose of this and so I believe everything's for a purpose don't you we'll pick that up but let's go back again we think about God all by himself dwell alone dwelt alone there was God all by himself for eons on eons and eons and I'm sorry but it's more human mind can comprehend we we we we just he never had a beginning we always want to think well where did it start because for us everything started somewhere is that right but he never did start never did finish amen he never did start never does end is that right he always was so I don't know about you sometimes for some people it may it maybe uh it's more than their mind can comprehend or more than they can believe it's easier for them that there was some big bang somewhere and we all just come into existence that's right that's why you know my fingers didn't come Christ huh if a big bang would be probably produced something like like that but aren't you glad that the god that put your fingers in line was a Divine designer that's right usually I say design divver or something but I said it right this morning Divine designer he was by himself amen now there he was and you ask yourself what is he what is he what is he well being alone he was alone and that's one thing that God doesn't want to be he don't want to be alone he's been alone long enough that's just one thing but that's what we want to talk about with the help of the Lord and I will skip over a lot of it because I want to get down to what I really want to say but when we think about there he was what is he well how many knows that God a father in him was to be a father but there was no children in him was to be a savior but there was nothing to save in him was to be a deliverer is that right and we can just take one of those things H let me go back again one of the first things that God was was a god him made the god of Glory right May the god of Glory Be With You amen the first thing about it was glorious he had a glory about him he's glorious and in the Book of Revelations 4 and verse 11 the 4 and20 Elders Fall Down and Worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive Glory how many believe that all glory goes to him anytime a preacher or laid my hands on somebody and this out of there you don't get no glory no all glory goes to God because anything good is it came from him in the first place glory amen that's how many knows oh I love this amen oh my let me see see another place in verse chapter 5:12 amen he says and I beheld and behold the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was thousand times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice saying Worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power how many knows you don't have no power you're you're not a church without the power of the Holy Ghost is a dead Church you as an individual God you're a dead church so all power blow amen he's worthy receive power power riches wisdom strength honor and glory and blessing how many know we say we're blessed I am blessed blessed blessed blessed but God needs to get some blessing in return bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name let's give him back some of what he is oh my he's a deliverer when he took MO and he delivered Israel out of Egypt amen and finally their enemies were all dead in the sea amen she began to give God PR Hallelujah God has delivered us hallelujah that's what God had in his mind he's going to receive glory for who he is hey aren't you glad for that amen so you see sickness sorrow death amen all these things are secondary the fall Sinners the only reason he allowed us to become is so he can save us how manyan know just think about that one act God being a savior the the millions out through the Dark Ages have gotten saved through Christ amen they give him praise and honor because I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see how glad saved God gets much Glory out of being a [Applause] savior Oh What A Savior Oh What A Savior he knew for the of the world we sing that song Oh What A Savior is my wonderful glorious wonderful savior how many knows he's a wonderful savior thank you Jesus for who you are amen so there and God had some thoughts that's why even Jesus says the Bible says Jesus was crucified he was crucified before the foundation of the world where in the mind of God it happened before the world ever began Revelations 138 All Shall Wonder after the Beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world everybody that'll ever be saved their names are already on the book they were on the book before the foundation of the world so if you're saved this morning you ought to be a happy person say my name is there cuz I'm saved my name is there oh you ought to have a run and fit thank you Jesus cuz you saved me amen Millions giving him glory for his saving power his delivering power how many knows he's a mighty warrior I love to think about him a warrior there's names that are forever edged in the Bible and in history the people that God has used to display his power and His glory like David amen if I ask wild back there what did David do Jonathan what did David do what did he he killed go that's right the littlest child knows about David why because he surrendered himself and God used him to do what everybody else St in their Fox all to know they were scar not David no so is that name is forever Edge that's being used to God to bring goath down amen praise the Lord Brother Brandon was telling the story whenever that Maniac came up to the platform and he says I'm going to break every bone in your body you hypocrite preacher the brother Brandon call him a hypocrite preacher and everything else that done broke the Jaws I think of a couple other preachers beaten him up you know and he says he was well able to do it is that right and he started to come forward to him and they the ushers wanted them to maybe bring the police and come after that guy and wrestle him down but man says hold him off right said don't arrest him leave him alone the Holy Spirit spoke to him because you have challenged the spirit of God you will fall on my feet is that right amen he come tow Jim amen I'm not spit did he spit on him he actually spit on brother random that right I'll show you whose feet I'll fall under he come up and swung fell right down and pinned his feet to the ground can you just see the angel in the Supernatural s you little guy I'll show you why cuz there's an angel of God with present with the prophet 24/7 never left his side amen even when Billy Paul saw him Angel was always looking at him why cuz there's demon powers that want to take your life there's demon forces that want to get you how many believes every child has that angel around them that's right that's not my words Bible says the angels of the Lord are encamped round about them that fear Glory that's God's word he's got you back I'm glad for that praise be to God that's right in many of the things like that when we think about of how God was a deliverer he was a savior he's a father and I want to again in the church age book talking about how to God before the foundation of the world he here in is the love of uh God presented that God wanted a a family of his own sons and daughters like himself how many believe that's God's that's that that's the message that's the gospel nutshell so to speak God wanted a family that's why he created a man and a woman and children and grandchildren cuz that's what he had in his mind he wanted to be a father he wanted a wife the bride has made herself ready how many believe God of Jesus Christ and it's important that a husband and and a think the same amen I want you to know we want to think if he says you're here I'm Healed if he says I'm delivered and I'm delivered if he says I'm a Son of God I'm a of God I don't care what the devil says amen praise be to God he wanted a family of his own and then he'll chasen those Sons and Daughters of God even as a parent chastises their children will them and everything else teaches them trains them not always about getting a beating but it's about getting lessons being taught how many believes that being taught in the ways of God so that we can understand how that God thinks what he wants what his desires are see Israel had a problem Israel Israel could never really understand understand God's ways and his thinking how many knows it's important that we understand the purpose of God and the way that God thinks the reason and sometime maybe we'll take a lesson on suffering why God allows us to suffer amen and all these things that God allows it's important to understand why there's trials why in the world that God would lead the children of Israel out in that right Mighty hand make Pharaoh so miserable until he says just get out of here take wife take your children take everything and just get out of here I can't stand and I can't stand the first Barn amen getting BN ain't that right finally he realized he's got to let go poor phoh he had persecuted the children of God what God did to him is that right all the things that he had done to God probably God this he hardened his heart pharoh power I [Applause] can't you be made glad he is's the god of GL to come you could really appreciate it really appre too many folks well I'm in church again boy this is so boring I'm here to tell you you know I hear him say that over and over again amen God is so boring to some folk that's not what God wants God wants you not to be lukewarm he wants you to be hot he wants you on fire he wants you to burnning with the power of God that's why he lets things come amen praise be to God many things all right let's jump fast forward a little bit God is just good isn't he amen God is just so good and I thank him for his grace born schz and TR Bram up at home schwat and all body the strictest the F strictest PA said amen by God's amen he touched me he called me amen like Paul said on the road to Damascus you know he was out for called him amen the thing first of all there's only two elements in the world brother Bram say that controls the world tonight that's fear Faith fear or faith amen doubt is that right I might as well say the devil brings fear the devil bring the devil tries to get you to have a Wy Wy Woos he tries to get us down why devil tries to tell you you're not this that or the other I like to remind you devil I know you're scared I know you know that God you know you're going to hell and you want me to share in that fear I refuse to share and your fear I will have no part of your depression I will know my amen the more you try to depress me the more will glorify God it'll just make us stronger you'll have to bring death to scare us why because we know the one that's conquered death hell and the grave we are more than conquerors for him that loved us amen but he tries to bring fear is that right worried scared fear doubt amen Russia is trying to get everybody fear them but we're trying to get everybody to have faith in God that's the difference those two elements control All Nations controls all people controls all churches controls all individuals fear or faith amen praise the Lord sometimes we come up to places to where it's either amen flight or fight amen I'll share a thought will give me in all of this amen it was when I was real down I said Lord I don't know if I can do this this is so much I don't know if I can do this and the more I thought in that line the weaker I would get the weaker I would get oh my but you know I felt like there's a voice says well you can't really get out of it can you no this is a fight like I said to the death this is a battle is that right I said if you trusted me Lord and my wife I say me but it's us we're one me trusted us with this God helped me to come up to the faith in my I call her I come up with a name name for my wife I said I call her have y'all ever heard of the Amazon Women there were some Amazon women warriors got a little bit about them and they're supposed to be these He-Man women drawing s and just being bad to the ball oh hope she don't get me guys AR amen and she was like you know to put some doubt in there confess to me I hope she don't mind she says I confess I said Lord Jesus please forgive me for sinking what you did on Calvary was good for me forgive me for thinking the wrong no I'm not calling her an I'm a son Warrior right I I'll give you the name in a minute here but I thought man her faith level is so don't allow one doubt to come in not one doubt don't you tell me I'm going to die don't you tell me this that or the other never had a fear it was crying her comforting me she said that about crying if you cry and boohoo don't cry right now you have faith for her you believe for her amen have faith amen I say well pet me because she's always not done I have never fared very well when I have a pity party around her nope nope nope she just doesn't go much for a man that has to have a pity party so I have to man up come on now get yourself together but I thought might you know if I Lord up to that Faith where I can cast every how many knows and there going to be an everyday battle and it's not just for her but it's for me and it's for us as a church amen every day shine every unbelief every Doubt cast it out cuz that'll give an Avenue for God to work as I as I'll show you amen so this is the name I give her my warrior Queen I thought my warrior princess at I said no she's not a princess anymore she's a queen she's my warrior Queen amen okay mighty warrior take the word of God by his strip devil I'll cut your head off that's right if she can do it you can do it I can do it we can all do it if she canot amen cut that devil down cut that unbelief [Applause] out amen see fear has no value in it at all whatsoever for you to ever be scared about anything it won't do nothing for you make it worse let me see what he says here see if you you fa a doubt you just get yourself up the more nervous you get you even get more nervous with fear you see he says no value at all it's perfectly endless doesn't have one good thing about it if I was morning was going to be shot what good would it do to have fear what good would it do me you say well what good would Faith do you Faith could deliver me yeah Faith deliver me but fear won't help me a bit get yourself worked up more nervous than ever when it comes to for time for the gun for nervous rank Ain that right that's right but don't let fear grab a hold of you don't let doubt grab a hold of you Lord help us amen all right now another one here we get to my thought what I want to share with you this morning and what we're in notice a Shepherd a Shepherd after he gets them all numbered and they're all bted down the shepherd goes down to this hole where the Sheep had come in at and lays himself across that hole maybe that narrow place is that right and no wolf can come no Thief can come in no harm can come in unless it comes over the shepherd first folks I'm here to tell you well this isn't just something the devil slipped in on us so we're going to throw him up because we never expected this and guess what this out other the devil didn't do nothing but what he had to go over the shepherd first now you tell me if the shepherd allows you to get cancer why my wife to get cancer it has to have permission from God that's right nothing goes over that CH and if it is then I want you to know something that God has a purpose in it he don't do it for fun he don't do it for no reason he has a purpose in it there's a purpose in it there's a reason for it amen and I've already seen probably more reasons than what I can number I can already see the purpose of God and the and what it has done and what it's doing wouldn't it be sad if something like that happened we'd be all confused about the whole thing and one wonder what this happened wonder what this is but when you see one of the things it does amen and it gets you right amen first things I H I'm every time I fussed at you or did anything to you honey I'm so sorry forgive me and she me too thank you know I've done things too I'm so sorry amen the first thing that happens amen there's a cleansing that comes forth amen and there closeness God you begin to draw nigh to God and your slackness and your lukewarmness and your laziness it's got to go by the wayside God don't want us look warm he want us H for God is that Tomy not mediocre hot for God Amen he wants us as a church hot for God and oh my we know that uh Trump got it what's her name didn't get it Camala chameleon I mean Camala Kamala didn't get it it's very likely that that scripture is not in the past could easy be woman had Rosen power they made Havoc of the place is that right could be sometimes more simple I'm not saying it is could be now Trump and all this everything that's happened and the way that it's gone amen and so to speak to him coming back and and the next thing according to the vision is that going to destroy America a fire is fixing the fall so what's the purpose of this what does this do every how many knows it elevates our faith we promise is mine amen and if we're going to have a body change then we going to have to learn how to conquer cancer we're going to have to conquer some big GTH us we're going to have to learn to have faith in God how many know he done a lot for all of us already caused us to check up pray up and be your faith up folks I'm here to tell you I wouldn't even stand up here if I think of the negative and let it get me down be depressed we don't have to be depressed amen when the devil want to frown we're just GNA laugh a little louder everybody smile that's right give him a black eye devil you thought you'd make me all sad you thought you'd make me doubt he he doeses try to you know how much he tries to bring doubt in oh boy here we go you know the devil will tell you now what if the evening light Tabernacle believes she's already healed confess that she's already healed rejoice as though she's already healed the devil will tell you then what if it don't happen aren't you going to look like a fool are people going to you know that's what the devil tries to tell me but this is what I say to the devil those Hebrew children they had faith in God they didn't doubt they didn't know what God would do but they said now this one thing is for sure we will not bow we will not have doubt devil you won't depress us CL you're not going to depress us go back to hell with your thoughts I'll say this we're going to have faith I believe this church has faith I'm going to have faith my wife is going to have faith if she wouldn't get it it would not be because of our faith are you listening to me amen I don't believe that it would be of course not because that we didn't believe I believe that we believe it because every day I cast out out she cast that out and I'm expecting it to happen let me tell the other department Department of when where and how that's God's business that's his business not your business your business is to believe [Applause] amen our business is to believe the other department is God's Department he's Sovereign he's Divine nobody tells him what to do what a picture of Christ laying himself down for us nothing can harm us unless it comes over him and if you're sick and you say brother brandham sickness crossed over him brother bam says but it for the glory of God how many believe that that's right it's for the glory of God Amen maybe he wants to give you a testimony that's right maybe he wants to give you a testimony this what God had done to me oh I was thinking I can't wait amen until we can go in there and they look for it and they say we can't find it and they all got crossed eyes what happened I don't know what's going on and let him be dumb fuzzed we don't know it we it can't be but it is how manyan know many of doctors in the past they can't figure it out they don't know what happened but it ain't there W Glory if you can find out what your place is in the plan of God even though you be S nearly dead say I'm a Christian how could that be in the plan of God see it might be in God's plan to heal you and to give you a testimony that you'll shake to the kingdom of God Amen God allows God lets those and you may have ups and downs and so forth but it's all in the plan of God oh I like looking at it at the Right Way Church looking at it the right has allowed it he's got a plan it he's got a purpose in it my desire this morning is God will fulfill his represent have your way Lord we are yours but we're expecting a mighty and when he gives a devil a black eye of healing amen all the critics will have to shut up this comes to me just now it's some when you face a situation like this the reaction of people their testimony their reaction to you and what they'll say oh I'm so sorry brother I'm I'm praying for you so sorry I'm glad you're sorry you know but right now I need a little bit different words I'm sad enough already I don't we be more sorry huh a certain brother texted me and I told him last night I said this is what we're looking for amen can I share it with you Amen Let me see here Jonathan howchin his testimony is he says hold on a minute brother berer the news about sister berer and we are so sorry but know that she'll have a brand new Bud over there no listen to what he says about sister Bor we just wanted to let you know that we're not accepting that box of

atmosphere you won't have to go to work tomorrow you can praise God tomorrow like you are right here right now we're just getting started all right so now brother bam says how many Christians is in here let's see your hand he said Almost 100% present all Christians now each one of you God saved you in the same way by faith if you're saved this morning if you holy ghost in your heart you got it because of the faith that you had if you believe in your heart that God has raised him from Thou shalt be saved you believe that with all of your heart amen when Jesus said come and follow me and mean you willing to forsake mom forsake dad forsake Church forsake everything for Christ when accepts your sacrifice and your repentance amen God fa through faith that not of yourself that faith is a gift of God W what is that Faith that's not your faith my wife said many times no it's not my faith it's God's faith in me it's God's faith in me you were saved by faith you could not come here I says you could come here and you could cry and pray and pray and cry all this week and next week and next month you could be at the altar crying and pray ask God to forgive you he says you'd be there a month and you'd still be a sinner until you accept what he has done you've got to accept that he has forgiven you that's where it lays accepting what's already been done how many know every Redemptive has already been paid for sometimes we are let's admit it so sometimes we're good at have faith for saving of our souls but when it comes to the healing of the body and cast out devils and Cancers and stuff like that sometimes we're a little weak we need our faith exercise we need stronger Faith Sav you amen that's right accept him is that right that's right it's not your crying that saves you it's your faith that saves you that's right now there's just a little instructions on might say to the sick you might come here and be prayed for you might have angels to lay hands on you and it'll never do you one thing to you until you first believe it now isn't it funny I didn't realize that would match with that first story I read so well Angel the angel of the Lord was there ready to touch her and actually even removed the darkness from her actually even removed it because she said she believed but the second she I doubted it it came back isn't that right an angel could touch you but if you don't believe it you'll never get it it's your belief your faith in your heart that does it amen while we're on this and one of the multitude answer and said master I have brought unto thee my son which ha a dumb spirit and he taketh him he teth him and he foth and he nashes with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not and he answered says oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long will I suffer you bring him unto me and he brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallered foaming and his father and he asked his father how long has this been that came upon him and he said of a child and this woman this woman has said been on them crutches for years and because she had been on them so long she it could happen how many know maybe you've got to happen maybe you've got something it can't be don't never think [Applause] that don't say God has already delivered me [Applause] amen listen you have to believe it first you have to accept it and confess it for he is the high priest of our profession our confession Ain that three says he as a high priest he said it's done Jes said the work is done if he was here in his suit now he said he could not heal you you have to accept that what he did already he is now sitting at the right hand of the father anden making good your confession the devil doesn't want us to confess he wants us to be afraid to sign a check he wants us to be scared to sign a check of what people will think I don't care what people think I don't care what the devil thinks I just care what God says you want to be a Critic go ahead you ain't going to stop me amen here's a big one he says and we've got to confess it first before he can witness it before God Amen he's the high priest D to make intercessions Upon Our confession of what he has done for us now what is Divine Healing does it mean that you have to wait till tomorrow night to be healed no sir do you have to come to church to be healed no sir the moment that you believe and accept it as your personal property it's finished right [Applause] there praise be to God listen to this now the moment that you can accept your healing or your salvation if you're walking down the street wherever you are the moment you accept it that's when you turned around anytime any place don't have to be in church but this is a good place moment you accept it amen praise the Lord couple more stories here at least one more I love these stories amen here not
