tidwell's mom passed away so we'll remember her at the same time everybody remembers sister Vicky tidwell's mom amen and so but we just want to have a moment of silence for those two people if you would amen this morning and remember them let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we just come before you this morning Lord and while we believe and know that both of these mothers were Godly women and we truly believe that they're on the other side in that dimension in a better place but yet those families Lord Jesus they still have to deal with not having them around anymore and we just pray father both for the Miller family and for the well family just now God that you would bring Comfort to their hearts Lord Jesus even though they're separated and have to go through this Lord I believe as Paul said that we through comfort of the scriptures don't have to grieve as those who have no hope Lord for we do believe that we will see him once again Lord and father we thank you for this hope that you give us by dying on the cross on Calvary and for raising from the dead once again and showing us that there is life after death there will be a resurrection there will be a heaven to go to Lord Jesus there will be eternal life Lord Jesus where we'll never grow old and we where these uh mothers which were way up in their eight years father no doubt but they're 20 years old again father they've turned back young Lord and we believe that's what we'll do one of these days each and every one of us father and Lord that's what we come together for us for the hope of the Resurrection the hope of the Rapture The Hope father if we have not of this world but the hope that we have of the world that is to come and father we ask God this morning that you would just be with us Lord Jesus as We Gather ourselves together in your name and as we prepare ourselves for that hour and for that day and how to live while we are here on Earth Lord Jesus and how we're to conduct ourselves Lord as Sons and Daughters of god father Sons and Daughters of the king Lord and help us to live an example life Lord Jesus and we just pray this morning Lord that you'll bless father what I feel Lord that you've laid upon my heart to speak this morning we ask God that you'll just take the words father out of your Bible Lord Jesus and just say what you once said and help me to get out of the way that your Holy Spirit might speak to your people bless each one that is gathered here this morning for those that are still recovering Lord amen from sicknesses we ask God for a special touch from for those and Lord this morning most of all we just ask and invite you to come by and touch us Lord Jesus visit us this morning Lord Jesus in a special way father by your spirit coming down upon the congregation and Lord doing something father that we know that only you can do Lord father look into our hearts look into our lives Lord and see if there be any way in there that is unpleasing to you father and as we go into this 2021 Lord Jesus we pray God that as we dedicate this year to you we ask God that we would ever be drawn Closer to You Lord and perhaps even drawn to your very being Lord this year we look forward to it and believe God it will happen one of these days just as sure as we are standing on the earth you've created your word will come to pass God that we will see you face to face we ask God as we now father Lord going into the sincere part of the service Lord Jesus and lay aside the cares of life and all these other things Lord we ask God that you would father help us to be sincere enough Lord to listen to your voice that you have that you speak to our hearts each one Lord Jesus that we'll hear you speak father speak to our hearts this morning Lord Jesus be with us bless us father and we commit this both this year this month this day and this time to you ask God you'd help us to serice with every serve you with every breath that we have and every minute that we have in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you amen do you want to say God bless you to all of our young people here this morning morning amen amen good to see everybody so praise the Lord all right so I think we've got it I know last Sunday I hated that we didn't get that message last Sunday uh because we had one little technical problem I think it was and so uh we didn't get to have any sound on it is that right so anybody was streaming I don't think you could hear it but um anyway so amen I certainly you know I pray the Lord will help us to maybe get somehow right now we're doing the best we can on streaming so hey you know if you don't get to see it very well or whatever I think you just get what you can out of it right and so as long as we're getting fed and we getting it I think that'll have to do until they get perhaps a better faster service through here in this area they just don't have anything here right now so amen and so you just we just commit that to the Lord amen if you will open your Bibles this morning we'll go to the Book of Matthew amen Book of Matthew Matthew 14 and we'll begin with verse 22 and read down to 31 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side and while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is eye Not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if that if it be thou bit me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched out forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore this thou doubt amen and when they were come into the ship ceased amen praise the Lord may God bless add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning I think this will probably last I don't know if Donna if you changed the batteries in it or not but I think we might be all right amen praise the Lord so there's a little thought that came to me here this week amen and just something that um um I've wanted to perhaps share with you and I've spoken on this subject several different times but I trust that it'll be a blessing and perhaps we'll be able to look at it in just a little bit different direction or a different way so we find here uh that Jesus of course you know uh came upon the waters and they thought it was a spirit and it says that they were they cried out for fear they were scared right they were scared and that's where Jesus said be of good cheer it is I don't be afraid this morning with the help of the Lord I'm going to speak a little while on fear or faith fear or faith Amen brother he makes a statement when he was speaking on on this same subject talking about this same story he says you know there's two elements that control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear and the other one is Faith amen now now there he says it's either fear or faith that controls every nation every denomination and every individual amen you're either fear or faith that controls you again in expectation he makes a statement now there's only two elements in the world that controls the whole world tonight that's fear or faith amen makes a statement talking about all churches all individuals all of these is simply one or the other and this morning with the help of we want to talk about perhaps where fear comes from where fear takes you and then where faith comes from and what operates it and and where it takes you so now we've already been uh uh been taught by the prophet how that our our being here our existence here that we're a Triune being amen we're body we're spirit and we're soul is that right Body Spirit and soul amen and the most of you that's raised in this mes especially you we've had diagrams of it and things and so forth that the outer senses of course the body being see taste feel hear and smell the spirit being conscious reason imaginations memory and so forth and then down in the soul we realize there's only two factions in the soul you'll either do one thing or the other and the ultimately your see taste feel here and smell your conscious reing memory and all of those things all of your complete body your complete World basically that you live in is controlled by only two things that's down in your soul and there's only one or the other that you can control by and that's either Faith or doubt amen Faith or doubt you either believe or you'll not believe praise the Lord all right so there's only two factions only two ways that you can look at it one of them of course we realize that uh doubt now how many knows that doubt or what we might call unbelief amen now Jesus said that go into all the world and preach the gospel and you know he that believeth shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned so we see the results of unbelief or doubt now you and I are living in the world okay we're living in the world and most most everything around us amen the world is being governed by that unbelief or doubt that's the reason that people are in the condition that they're in and right now more than at any other time because of the virus people are playing on your fear is't that right we're being played on by our fear like never before cuz even some of our Supreme Court Justices are amazed at how much we're willing to give up how much uh uh we allow people to break the Constitution break laws make new laws make their own laws up and make you live by their laws not laws at all they're even amazed huh and so you see how that you know and we know we know that that it's a play to devil is in it all now it doesn't matter what government is we know that all government are controlled by the devil and so and as we look at it we look at the world we look at the condition that's out there amen and I'll tell this right now as we go into 20 and 21 amen and we go into this new year you know that fear and that doubt will only get worse and worse and worse amen so we see that we're are Liberties and different things that people and the devil wants to take that from us isn't that right and so if you're thinking brothers and sisters if you're thinking that it's going to turn around that it's going to get better amen and I thought well I got got some good news for you this morning it's not going to get better it's going to get worse how in the world is that good news huh huh come on be of good cheer now don't fear why because we know that the scripture says the scripture says that the Antichrist system amen it is going to get so bad that no man can even buy or sell you talk about your right say you can't go to the grocery store and by groceries you can't sell unless you receive that Mark so there's a squeeze coming isn't that right but the Bible says that we're not going to be shut up we're going to be taken up so that's the good news it's finally coming to pass because we've got to get out of here so it has to get worse it has to have more doubt it has to have more fear but that's not what controls us the world I mean you think about the unbelief look at how people dress look how people look look they won't even wait there's more you know drugs and we have a a drug pandemic and everything else all kinds of things because it's all under doubt they've created a world under doubt and fear I want you to know that one thing that automatically comes with doubt is fear and scare huh because if you'll notice Peter here he was told look come come you want to walk on the water come on did Jesus said come now I don't know about you but if Jesus himself looks you in the face and say come on yeah that's what you probably want to do just come on down but even Jesus himself couldn't keep Peter from sinking you know because he wasn't well no matter how much I doubt no matter how much I look at my symptoms I'm getting no he begin to sink when he begin to look at the symptoms how many knows when you begin to let even a little bit of Doubt come into your life you are on the road to sinking amen but Jesus did reach out his hand and saved him amen come on don't look at your symptoms they're full of Doubt don't look at the surroundings don't look at the world it'll bring fear in your life it'll bring doubt in your life look at this world is going down amen this ship is going down the whole world it's going down it's doomed ain't that right but we don't fear every one of us is as good as dead amen I put that a little bit different than part brother brandham did Brother Bram said I'm looking I'm a dying man looking at dying people a that right it's just a matter of time that's right that's right our mothers just a matter of time they're gone our uncles and ants now we're the uncles we're the ants we're the ones going up there it's just a matter of time isn't it something God put us on a sinking ship sure he did he allowed us to get on this sinking ship I don't hear no praises the Lord huh but you know as well as I do before even telling you he give us a Lifeline how many knows he didn't just put us on a sing ship without having some lifeboats on the boat how many believe there's a Lifeboat and you can come God has given I want you to know when you climb up into the fears of faith and I'll show you toward the end of the service that you don't even have to fear death I'm going to give you illustrations and examples of people's footprints that we can follow how many knows we want to follow people's Footprints people who've had faith and walked by faith amen I believe it's Romans the first chapter in verse 7 says for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith and is as it is written the just shall live by doubt no the just shall live by faith praise be to God our Prophet taught us that there is absolutely no value whatsoever in doubt and fear right the first person that ever be to have a little doubt what happened it was Eve she doubted God's word well God didn't really mean what he said that's what the devil told her nah Down You're Not Really Gonna Die God didn't mean what he said oh my listen this atmosphere in this world and doubt and fear it goes all the way into churchianity churches the deceiving part is those who have just so much but they still reject the truth amen now I want to tell you something that your faith you cannot rest in anything else outside of the word of God this is where your faith rests I don't know how many heard Wednesday night we were talking about the arm of Faith amen the arm of Faith every last one of these promises even even Jesus said nothing shall be impossible for you if you have faith as the grain of a mustard seat you could say to this mountain be plucked up and moved into the ocean if you had that kind of faith it can happen Joshua had Faith he stopped the universe all these things is that right and whatsoever you ask in anything in M I will do it but there's a condition you remember the woman that touched the ham of His Garment remember the woman that he called a dog he says according to your faith be it unto you it just takes a strong arm it just depends on how weak or how strong the arm of faith is to grab that sword and cut those promises out of the Bible you'll never get saved unless you believe that he died for you and that that it was for you you can come to the alt and repent for two weeks and unless you accept what he did you have to accept what he did amen it has to be a strong arm of Faith to cut your salvation out amen praise the Lord so many wonderful promises well I've got need of this and I got I'd like to have a job and I'd like to have a mate and I'd like to have a home and I'd like to have I'd like to be taken care of Jesus says you know if you'll seek the kingdom of God and my right rightousness food and reignment all these things shall be added unto you I like when he's taking care of me don't you he does a lot better job taking care of me than I can take care of myself amen so so many so to just those that are Christians are to live every day let me say this that that's what we want to do in 2021 we want to live by faith to live by faith now how many knows that faith has to be governed by something faith has a governor it's got a governor and it's found in Galatians in Galatians 5 and verse 6 it says for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love amen so faith is governed Faith Works by love praise be to God and so fear fear works because of unbelief and doubt because of doubt we're living in a whole world of Doubt yet in the midst of it all think about it think about this Malachi 4 the prophet in this generation many times he would come say Allah you know who I'm waiting on he said now if I've preached the gospel and Jesus don't come and back it up you ain't got a B to believe the what I said and let me tell you something how many you knows one thing he taught us that if he taught something was contrary to B I wouldn't believe the prophet but Brandon would see visions and he see things and he'd go back to the scripture and make sure it's scriptural it all has got to be scriptural that's a good part of it it's scriptural but then Jesus would come down and do exactly what he did 2,000 years ago a million more times millions of more times than he did when he walked the Earth he discerned a woman at the well thoughts and intents of her heart Jesus can come do that all of that and guess what this place still isn't full this place ought to be packed out brother Phil we ought to have a a super church but people don't believe every Church would be right here if they truly believe Jesus Christ because it wasn't brother bam doing it was Jesus Christ himself coming and doing what he's always done that woman that was discerned the thoughts of her heart she says went into the city after he told her that she had five husband one amen you know and the people believed her testimony said isn't this what the Messiah is going to do the prophet of God said this is him again this is the Messiah again and we all know the world's going to burn but God has sent the last prophet to the world other than the two Jew the two ones that's going to Israel amen but see the doubt look at where the doubt is today look at where the doubt takes churches it's a deceiving thing amen but in the midst of it all let me tell you something I believe that God has a group of people amen every one of his bride members those who truly love this because listen to this how many knows that one thing the prophet taught us that Eve disbelieved one word and took her down into the pits of death and fear if you lack the love of God it'll cause you to have a complex huh that's right and they they likeed the love of God after they did what they did after Adam and Eve did what they did what did they do they went and hid themselves they were ashamed themselves they knew they were guilty they tried to hide they had fear fear set in anybody that's not saved anybody that ain't got the Holy Ghost you got fear in your heart whether you believe it or not because guess what you've got condemnation in your heart and if you've got condemnation in your heart it's hard for you to have any kind of Faith isn't that right the only thing that you can possibly believe for is Lord forgive me of my sin make me right before you God will hear your prayer right amen but it brings fear it brings doubt amen it did it did Adam he brought fear in scare a complex amen and that's how Humanity was for 4,000 years man was having a complex they were scared of death but how many are glad that even during that time period there was some folks that did love the Lord there was some people that led the Lord amen and that love governed and caused them to have faith in God in the face of death itself amen that's right even in the face of death so what does do what does faith do for you first of all it puts it makes a man out of you it gives you courage the opposite opposite of scared is courage can I just say what comes to mind how many sometimes you know you feel like raising your hand or a you feel like saying Amen brother preach it huh or praise be to God or how many times think about it now that you pull back that you pull back from even worshiping the Lord because what go through your mind is what's somebody else going to think what's the next guy gonna think well the devil will put it in your mind well you wasn't quite perfect last week huh you wasn't quite perfect and if I say Amen all the rest of the Young Folks are going to look at me and thinking hey you know is he really holy is he a Christian you know and he's going to live up to his shouting in church here because we know you're not supposed to shout any louder than you live all kinds of things going but really when you just let go and don't worry about the next person if that bothers you tell hey praise be to God hallelujah just scatter that doubt don't worry about what everybody else thinks Worship the Lord he's worthy to be praised you wouldn't even draw your next breath if it wasn't for him you wouldn't have anything that you have if it wasn't for him and we come quiet as a mouse huh we hold back cuz the devil plays in our mind fear scare huh that's I'll tell you what the prophet of God didn't have much for a no in church that's right no Hallelujah no praise the Lord where's the freedom oh my I'll tell you what you get a young little girl out here you get one of these young boys out here turn them loose brother Troy out there what are you gonna do they're happy they're free why they run they scream they shout if they G to fuss they go f big time and fight really big you know whatever they do who do hardly land to the Lord but listen amen they're free and brother B says Americans in America people aren't free people say they're free but they're not really free people are bound by things God came to give us Liberty the whole world is getting bound and they want to bind us and they want to bind everything now but there's a group of people who have been set free by the Holy Ghost we don't live by fear we don't live by doubt faith will take you into Heavenly places doubt doubt will take you in despair amen it'll take you into sorrow it'll get you depressed amen but Faith it'll lift you up it'll save you it'll give you the Holy Ghost it'll give you joy unspeakable and full of glory and I am a witness after 30 years of preaching after 30 or something years as a Christian I want you to know it just gets better all the time better and better and better all the time because I know the devil's tactics I know how he works I know he tries to drag you down amen and you learn those tactics and you overcome the devil amen you're sick and tired and depressed you ain't got no amen well you need to get in sick and tired a little more until you're sick and tired of being sick and tired you see I ain't doing this no more amen shamgar lived under fear and doubt for year after year after year them devils and them Philistines just oppressed him took all of his Joy amen he had to have his growling stomach his children had a growling stomach his wife was until what of he days he had it up live or die he was going out of the barn and there was a big old stick on the side of the door he Gra gra that o go you went out there and killed 600 of them I've had enough and that Faith killed him like I said he was invincible do you realize this morning that faith will give you invincibility like I said it didn't matter if Samson had a th if there would have been 10,000 amen shamgar 600 or 10 it don't matter cannot be stopped you cannot be stopped what the brother unless you ever get born again it's for Time and Eternity there ain't no imps no Devils Out of Hell could ever stop you if you're ever genuinely born again you can't even stop yourself come on folks you can't even stop yourself God's going to see to it that you are there he said if you would become rebellious if you are God's sh he has begun a good work was able to perform it and it wasn't you that started it was him that started in the first place boy I wish I could jump over this Pulpit right now I would I just need a few wings and I'll be gone amen I thank God for that faith will lift you up it'll inspire you it'll make you feel good doubt will drag you down thinking about your problems will drag you down looking at your symptoms will take you down it'll depress you looking at the world looking at politics it'll drag you down can I say something here and on the tape world huh I think it's about time that we shut off the news we're more involved in politics and in opinions and politics than we have ever been huh every time you hear it get worse why don't you just begin to say praise praise be to God to take a little more of your Liberties say praise be to God it's coming it's coming cuz I'm fixing the goal and it has to come before you can go you ain't G to change it nobody going to change it thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord through the prophet you could put a Abraham Lincoln and George Washington in every County huh it would never turn it around they spurn their day of Grace amen the only thing that is left is the coming of the Lord there's the only one hope only one hope and that's the coming of the Lord praise the Lord other other than that it's thus sayith the Lord there's 's a fire coming that shall melt the elements with fervent heat the heavens and the Earth will be on fire praise be to God but you fear not fear not for I am the first and the last I am he which liveth and was dead Don't Be Afraid don't be scared don't worry about it that's right huh so let me just say this for everybody that does watch the news and keep up with politics have you ever felt it kind of make you feel down a little bit huh well then guess what as a preacher I want to tell you you need to look to some other direction if it ain't making you feel better you're probably looking at the wrong thing I could lie to you and tell you well keep looking get better after a while I'm glad I put that lie to you first what that wouldn't be the truth would it no it wouldn't just going to get worse but what thus saith the spirit to the bride I say good morning [Applause] shalom back in 63 the prophet said Shalom peace be to you Hallelujah I said in 20 21 Shalom little bride how many believes it's peace time for the bride it's not frustration it's not depression that comes by doubt by unbelief this here oh oh my what ra say he says if you are believing every jot and every TT he says you are Justified as though you never done it in the first place there's not one sin against you you are The Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ may we come to that in this year come to where we believe every job every TT every part of it to become it huh are you with me this morning there's not one strike against you you can't have a smile on your face unless you're right with God therefore being justified amen we have peace with God isn't that right amen there's now therefore some condemnation no no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after politics in the flesh but after the spirit amen praise be to God oh yeah yes amen praise the Lord Faith operated we to live by faith every thought they come through your mind it's either right thoughts or wrong thoughts thoughts of Doubt or thoughts of faith faith Paul said casting down reasoning imagination and bringing into captivity put it behind bars slam those doors and lock it up put behind bars every thought bring it captive to what God Said one thing come into your mind that ain't according to the word of God lock it up throw it out you'd be a lot happier if you didn't have this big nest on your head where you let long thoughts come and oh it just builds and builds and builds birds come up there and not only make a nest up there they hatch eggs got other little birdies coming up and you I'm so miserable I'm telling you birdie birdie up birdie birdie up there making you all kinds of misal because you thought all the wrong thoughts huh get way too carried away huh yeah that's right let a wrong thought come grab your shotgun boom drop that bur out of W yeah Hallelujah that's right cuz that's the devil how many know that's what the devil does he uses your thoughts to try to get you captive to get you down to make you feel like you're not a son of God like you're not a child of God and I want you to know the thing that I'm the very happiest about right now this morning and that is that I TR believe that I'm the Son of God behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon Thomas B that he should be called The Son of God I ain't going to get no tattoo and no earring and everything else to try to find my identity I already know who I am ain't that the truth people don't know what they want to be they don't know where to come from they don't know where they going but the bride knows who she is and she knows who her daddy is she knows who her great is wo I don't need no opium I take it every day right here's my opium it comes from the lily of the valley and it makes you feel good that's right this afternoon I won't have no hangover nope you can take more it'll be all right just makes you feel better all the time put a smile on your face praise be to God I'm knows we're governed Every Nation every church every individual you're either governed by God or you're governed by the devil either by faith or by doubt one or the other governs you it makes you what you are there's people who just have a certain Aura the prophet of God said around them just something about them yeah some people you like to be around and some people you just would rather not that's right why because of the atmosphere that they create how many believes we are all creators let me say this 2021 is for your creating it's for you to create that's right that's right it's why it's a open book huh we're just on the the first or second page is't that right it's for you to write well I tell you I'm so frust is that what you want to write well I need a job but should nobody ever hire me you know I'm just too ugly I'm not smart enough I'm not no don't write all that stuff I am a child of God and Hallelujah God said that he was going to provide it for me when I get a job it's gonna be a good job hello and they create an atmosphere we're all creators that's right I believe it I don't care if a California sinks I don't care what happens you're still in Heavenly Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we don't rock when the world rocks this place was to start shaking earthquake the Bible says we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken you have a kingdom on the inside of your heart it don't matter what comes it don't matter what goes oh and God loves to test Us in those places to see whether we're living by faith or whether we living by doubt right why do you think he put Israel down at the Red Sea and led him to a dead end Street and he had the sound of Chariots the dust rising up of the mightiest Army on the earth coming to take him back cuz he wanted to find out what they were governed by was it going to be Faith or are it going to be doubt because doubt automatically causes you to do what the first thing that you're going to do is complain it's going to gripe about your condition and where you're at if you want to find a person that is doubtful amen one lady was so positive always saying good things about everybody and somebody was going to get her I'll get her she said she asked the lady he says well what about the devil isn't he terrible what' she say she says no he's just a real good adversary that's some good to say he's good at his job huh wow you talk about the Holy Ghost how many knows bam taught us that the the Holy Ghost is never negative he is always positive praise be to God that's why we try to push that's why we try to get everybody in the Holy Ghost there won't be no complaining Among Us amen no matter what comes or what goes God was trying them testing them see whether they would be operated by faith or whether they'd be there was how many knows there was two of them when all of those 10 spies came back from from across the from across the river Amen to bring back a report of what Jericho and all these places amen the T spies didn't have the Holy Ghost man I want you to know that we went to a race yeah we went to a chariot race we watched The Chariot race we heard it and guess where it was it was on top of their City walls they got enough room to run chariot races over on top of them walls that's how they are you ain't never going to make it we'll never make it and guess what we peeped around the oak tree and we looked down there and there was this great big Goliath and Giants scared the liver out of us that's right tell it sister wo think about it scared us to death listen came back with a negative report she says if the preacher can yell so can I I love to sound of children we got life amen but so what was it think about it and there was two of them that had a different Spirit about them H how many know brother pH you know when you meet somebody you can always tell when there's just a different Spirit about him huh like brother Braham says there's poor folks that think they're so much better than you huh you going up to somebody that thinks they're better than you it's not going to be the best Vibes folks sorry they're not going to give you the time of day or think anything of you but then he's been with rich people he's been with wealthy people he says who make you feel like you're something he said now that's a real man why because when somebody can make you feel like the big man whether they're the big man or whatever amen it's about the atmosphere amen so folks let's create 2021 not by oursel but by this how me believe this is true nothing is solid in this world is this not even close there's no absolute outside of this there's nothing that you can have faith in outside of this I don't have my own message I preach Jesus's message I got to say what he said amen because when I inject my own ideas my own thoughts hello then I make the word the null and void and God's not GNA be in it lean not to your own understanding lean to the word of God it's all right let's go a little further people who lived by love lived by faith because of their love how many know Daniel Prayed three times a day he had a good relationship with God he must have had love in his heart because the Bible says in St John there he says perfect love casts out fear it takes doubt and locks it up say don't you try to get me into disbelief and any kind of scare any kind of fear it takes away any kind of fear makes you fearless and Daniel how many know that he faced death he faced the death with that faith that God had given him it was his life is on the line that's how real it is and because of the love that he had for God he had faith in God live or die he served God how many believes that that's how you need to love God more than your very life and as a result God honored him and shut the lion's mouth said nah this guy here he's got the love that he's supposed to have it produced Faith how many May believe that when you got the right kind of love for God it will produce the faith that you have need of it absolutely will produce the right kind of Faith three Hebrew children the same way they face death amen and whether you know it like it or not remember what I said earlier we're all we all face death we're all coming down to that door if time terries if time terries we come up to that door they came to that door and they believe God no matter what what did it do that Faith Delivered Daniel and that Faith also delivered the three Hebrew children out of the fiery furnace but B says a doubt and unbelief has no value whatsoever even if he was going to be taken out and shot tomorrow to have doubt and fear wouldn't do you a bit of good it wouldn't do you one bit it has no strength in it whatsoever people live by doubt many of them end up committing suicide that's how miserable it makes them how many knows the world is in a miserable condition why can't people just live decent dress decent love God and stay the same but people are changing all the time because you're not satisfied you're not satisfied that's right David how many knows David when he came up to Goliath when all of Israel was living by fear they were scared of that that Goliath but David had Faith he lived by faith and he did not have one bit of fear of that Goliath even though his very life was at stake it was a life and death situation for David and yet he had Faith to believe that God is more than able oh I hope this goes deep that this year may we come to that place that it don't matter if you're up against a rock wall I don't care if you facing a lion I don't care if you're facing a fiery furnace or whatever that is put your faith in God and rest and rest that's how I want to live this year it's more and more than I ever have before no matter what comes your way what problems you face young people I'm here to tell you you'll face a lot of difficult things sure you sure will but let me tell you one of the greatest lessons you'll learn quick is that you learn to give it to God amen try to handle it yourself and see how bitterly it fails but they commit it to God and watch him bring you out the other side praise the Lord all right amen how about Paul let's talk about coming up to this door of death for a minute Paul he said he come up to the because let me just say this there's many battles that we Face many things we have to overcome in life right right but one of the greatest enemies one of the greatest things that you'll face in this world is coming to the door of death amen having to face that place of going over to the other side and like I said faith will actually lift you up in such a place that you don't even have to fear death itself Paul was one of them I'm GNA start with Paul I me knows Paul amen he says oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your Victory he didn't have a problem laying his CH head in The Chopping Block I know maybe one of those things that come sliding down he was more I'm more than willing to die death where is your sting grave where is your Victory but I know the one that gives me the Victory and it's Jesus Christ Our Lord he didn't hesitate why because he lived by faith amen praise the Lord how many knows brother brah said that whenever uh he was in the middle of that field and that killer bull came at him and had killed some other man already because that's why they put him in that field and he didn't remember that he was in there and he was going across that field to go pray for somebody and here that bull rose up in the middle of the field brother Brandon was a game W and brother Brandon went like this where's my gun reached for his gun ah I left it in the truck I'm done that's it I'm going to be ground in the dirt by this bull reach for the gun what he do next no gun me look around where is that tree where is that tree where is that fence tree there's no tree the fence is too far this guy he's gonna be a lot faster me huh and he begin to say Lord if this is how I'm supposed to go let me go bravely huh and he said something come down over him amen don't you want that to H happen when you are faced with a very hard situation just let something come down over you let God take over that's where God Specializes is in places where you really need him like that that's where you really see God it's no time to lose it it's no time to be scared like the disciples were remember they were scared they were afraid says they were afraid and what did Jesus have to say fear not be of good cheer you're not seeing a ghost it's me isn't it something how did Jesus send him on beforehand to the ship and then he went up to pray I think there was a plan in it the whole time don't you yeah I think there was a plan in the whole time and about the Fourth Watch which I understand perhaps if I'm okay with my understanding Fourth Watch would be what from 3:00 midnight or 3:00 in the morning to about 6 you know 6 to 9 9 to 12 12 to 3 3 to 6 somewhere in there the Fourth Watch of the night I don't know about you but I see somebody coming about 3 4:00 at night [Music] dark and walking on the water I'll be the first to admit I'd probably be a little scared myself who wouldn't be I'd rub my eyes D rub what is that but as he came Closer Closer hey we know him that's Jesus ain't that right that's Jesus Peter should have said y'all calm yourself down it's Jesus don't you worry about nothing but the Bible says they were all screaming for fear they screamed out for fear my's gonna get us all screamed out for fear Jesus had to talk to them fear not be of good Che it is I Be not Afraid brother Brandon took the same type and he preached a message on it his ey Be not Afraid when discernment went forth some people call it mental telepathy reading their minds and everything else he says no this is Jesus and he's saying the same thing to our generation it's me don't be afraid of me it is I be not afraid this is this is me this is Jesus spoke to us that way aren't you glad for Jesus that did that for us in this generation it is I Be not Afraid amen and then when Peter actually saw that it was him and believed he said if that's you huh bid me come to thee and he said come come how many believe Jesus is still telling every one of us come I'm here I haven't forsaken y'all I didn't die in the Dark Ages I didn't the denomination sins cross me I'm still here I'm still alive amen I'm here separate from all of them say here come to Christ Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecost the Lish menite the SS and all of y'all of you come to me I'm still here amen it is I Be not Afraid don't be scared in 2021 I say by the spirit be not afraid afid fear not I'm the first I am the last I am he which was which is and which is to come he which was dead and now I am alive forever I'm not dead how many believe he's not dead he's here what whatever your situation whether it's lions or whether it's tigers or whether it's problems or whatever it is it just just hang in there amen he's with us let's look at two people perhaps brother brah talked about FF Bosworth he was about a hundred years old he had been a missionary he had been a great missionary in the 1800s I guess early 1900s and brother bam had heard that he was at the point of death and he had been in Texas establishing churches and all these other and so forth he says did you ever hear how he went he says about an hour before he left to cross over he'd been asleep for a while kind of in the coma he raised up looked in the room and said mother and for a solid hour or maybe two hours he shook hands with friends that he had L to Christ that had been gone for 50 years covered Over the Bar on the other side went back and laid down his hands cross them like that and went to meet God remember brother B says brother Bosworth you know you're dying he says you're not sick he says no I'm not sick it's just my time to go then he brother BR ask him what's the greatest time and they had revivals they had people getting healed you know and all kinds of things what the was the greatest time of your life he said brother Ram this is it right here this is the greatest time in my whole life how many knows brother boss knew what it was like to live by faith not doubt right up to his last breath he had complete faith that he was God's child and where he was going just like Paul did I don't know about you but those are the kind of footsteps I want to follow those kind of Faith footprints that are left in the sands of time that perhaps a wayward brother or someone amen seeing might take heart again let's take heart again today how many's with me let's take heart again say God give me that kind of Faith don't be let me be ashamed of the Gospel don't let me be ashamed to Worship the Lord in spirit and in truth don't let me be ashamed to testify don't let me be scared at all let me have no fear at all he that fearth is not made perfect in love it'll not it'll take any fear of anything even death itself it'll take it out when you have the kind of love that you need to have for God you'll have the kind of faith that you did amen he talked about Paul Raider the same way he talked about how that he was dying and the Moody Bible Institute sent him a quartet down there and they were singing near my God to thee and so forth and brother B say just like FF Bosworth am mean this brother here he was he had a sense of humor and he said he said sing me some gospel he's he said who's dying here me or you oh my good phrase I want to I want to say be able to say that who's dying here me or you amen sing me a little Lord old gospel little bit more of a Snappy song because where I'm going folks I want you to know it's a lot better than this folks aren't you glad this is not the end of it this is not the end of the world this is the beginning of our world this is the end of their world of doubt and unbelief it'll all end up in fire but that's not going to be us we who live by faith look for a new heavens and in New Earth oh my I never fig how many times that I told brother hsel brother hsel I'll tell you what when I was young I always like a foot race when we get over there we're going to run all over the place I want to run and run and run and Run and Jump scream and shout and Hallelujah huh how about you tonight how many would you say Lord that's what I'm looking for my hope is not built here my hope is oh my oh on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness nothing outside of Christ can ever get us there praise be to God this morning amen hallelujah amen praise be to God you love him this morning amen let's stand this morning musicians if you'll come with our heads bowed this morning as we begin in Earthly time we begin a new year we all realize that whenever you're born again that's when you became a creature of Eternity not a creature of time but our bodies where we're still at is still a creature of time but on the inside we started heavenward when we was born again but this year coming up can we say if it's anything like last year it's going to be wow it's going to be wow and yes it's going to get worse things are going to get worse gradually one way or the other but how many this morning would say I want to rededicate my life to the Lord this morning rededicate myself to living by faith and let Faith govern my life as an individual I want the Holy Spirit I want the love of God in my heart to operate faith in God no matter what the circumstance is no matter what the situation is whether I have food or no food
