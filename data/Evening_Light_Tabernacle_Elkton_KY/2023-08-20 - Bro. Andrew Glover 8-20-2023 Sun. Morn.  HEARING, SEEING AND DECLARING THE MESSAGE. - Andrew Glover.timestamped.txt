[51:36] this morning that he's done so much for

[51:40] him enough or praise him enough or bless
[51:43] his name enough amen for all the

[52:19] want to look in a couple of places today
[52:20] we want to First first of all look in
[52:22] the Book of Job
[52:24] the 42nd chapter The Book of Job the
[52:27] 42nd chapter and then we're going to
[52:29] look in the New Testament in the book of
[52:31] First John 1. and
[52:33] and that while you're turning there to
[52:36] come
[52:36] and the opportunity to be here and we
[52:39] want to say God bless him to him and his

[52:42] here and
[52:43] the church we sure appreciate you all
[52:45] and amen just a real real special
[52:48] special place in our heart amen and we
[52:52] we sure love the Lord today amen The
[52:54] Book of Job
[52:57] the 42nd chapter
[52:59] we want to read here in the first verse
[53:01] of job 42
[53:04] um
[53:05] the Bible here says
[53:07] then job answered the Lord and said
[53:10] I know that thou canst do everything
[53:14] and that no fault can be withholden from
[53:16] me
[53:17] who is he that hideth counsel without
[53:19] knowledge therefore have I uttered that
[53:23] I understood not
[53:25] thanks too wonderful for me
[53:28] which I knew not so job's actually
[53:30] testifying that he's actually uttered
[53:32] things that he didn't even understand
[53:34] but he uttered them because they were
[53:37] truth Hebrew or sorry the verse 4 here
[53:40] says here I beseech thee and I will
[53:42] speak now watch this I beseech thee and
[53:44] I will speak here I beseech thee and I
[53:47] will speak so there's a connection
[53:49] between what you're hearing and what
[53:52] you're speaking see I will demand of the
[53:55] declare thou unto me now that's some
[53:57] pretty pretty bold words amen I will
[53:59] demand of thee to declare unto me for I
[54:03] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[54:05] ear but now mind I seethy wherefore I
[54:10] abhor myself and repent and dust and
[54:13] Ashes now brother Brian says what was he
[54:15] seeing he was seeing the word Vindicated
[54:18] so he was declaring what he was seeing
[54:20] and what he was seeing was Vindicated
[54:22] word now in the book of First John the
[54:25] first chapter of First John
[54:27] the first chapter I love to read the
[54:31] Bible they've been under the teachings
[54:33] of a Vindicated Prophet Amen in first
[54:36] John 1 and verse 1 it's a very very
[54:39] powerful reading here how the John is
[54:42] describing the person of Christ in first
[54:45] John 1 verse 1 he says now that which
[54:48] was from the beginning which we have
[54:51] heard which we have seen with our eyes
[54:53] which we have looked upon and our hands
[54:56] have handled of the word of life
[54:59] for the life was manifested and we have
[55:02] seen it and bear witness and show unto
[55:04] you that eternal life which was with the
[55:07] father and was manifested unto us
[55:11] now that which we have seen and heard
[55:15] declare we unto you that ye Also may
[55:18] have fellowship with us and truly our
[55:21] fellowship is with the father and with
[55:23] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[55:25] right we unto you that your joy may be
[55:28] full I want you to notice here in verse
[55:30] 5 he says this then is the message which
[55:35] we have heard of him and declare unto
[55:38] you that God is light and in him is no
[55:42] Darkness at all amen let's just buy our
[55:45] hearts together this morning and ask the
[55:46] Lord to minister to his Heavenly Father
[55:48] Lord your word is true your spirit is
[55:51] here this morning Father we believe that
[55:53] you're an ever-present help in the time
[55:55] of trouble we believe that your strength
[55:57] when we're weak we believe that your
[55:59] courage when we're discouraged father so
[56:01] Lord this morning we're inviting you to
[56:03] come into this building have your way
[56:05] Among Us Lord may you drive out ever
[56:07] Spirits it's unlike the Holy Spirit
[56:09] father may you bring an anointing and
[56:11] Liberty upon this place today Father
[56:13] Lord that we could declare your word
[56:15] Lord without reservation Lord without
[56:17] hindrance oh God the Lord we've come
[56:20] here this morning to do one thing that
[56:22] is to lift up the name that is above
[56:24] every name so Lord I'm inviting you this
[56:26] morning come and take preeminence Among
[56:28] Us have your way here today God father
[56:30] forgive us of our failures forgive us of
[56:33] our shortcomings Lord we we don't want
[56:35] to leave this meeting today the same as
[56:36] we came we want to leave change father
[56:38] so Lord send the spirit of wisdom in
[56:41] Revelation into the building oh God and
[56:44] Lord take these things as you've placed
[56:45] upon our heart and Lord give us the
[56:47] grace Lord to deliver it and to declare
[56:49] it father as you have so graciously
[56:52] given it to us and we'll be sure father
[56:54] to give you all the praise all the honor
[56:56] and all the glory that's do your
[56:57] wonderful name the name of the Lord
[57:00] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[57:02] Believers says
[57:04] amen and amen God bless you this morning
[57:06] that you may be seated here today amen
[57:09] we we want you this morning by the help
[57:10] of the Lord for just a few moments amen
[57:13] I want to speak to you here from these
[57:16] passages of scripture and if I would
[57:18] title this thought this morning I want
[57:19] to speak to you for a few moments on
[57:21] hearing seeing and declaring the message
[57:24] hearing seeing and declaring the message
[57:27] you know I love the word there that John
[57:30] uses in verse 5. he said this then is
[57:33] the message so when he uses this word
[57:36] message you go look at the Greek uh
[57:38] definition rather Hebrew of the word
[57:40] message and it means an announcement it
[57:42] means a promise it is the act of
[57:45] promising a promise given or to be given
[57:48] it is a promise good or blessing now a
[57:51] message then could very well be said
[57:53] that this then is the promise or this
[57:55] thing is the announcement this then is
[57:58] the blessing amen that God is alive and
[58:01] in him is no Darkness at all but the man
[58:04] preaches called hearing recognizing
[58:06] acting on the word he said now first
[58:09] Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing
[58:11] the word of God he said then the lever
[58:14] he hears it and recognizes it and acts
[58:16] on it the believer hears it he
[58:18] recognizes it and acts on it he said the
[58:21] carnal man will hear it sound of it but
[58:23] never see so here means to understand
[58:26] now look at it it's looking at something
[58:28] but to see it is to understand it so you
[58:31] can look at something and never see it
[58:33] you can you can physically look at
[58:35] something and it never really become a
[58:38] reality to you but when you actually see
[58:40] it you understand it now that's why that
[58:42] Jesus would say Amen except a man be
[58:45] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[58:48] heaven right amen or other words he
[58:50] cannot understand it again and the
[58:52] message I've heard but now I see he said
[58:54] and the church has heard of God they
[58:56] have read of him and what he did and the
[58:58] promises he made amen but now we see him
[59:02] with our eyes so we love him we've read
[59:05] about him all the promises he made amen
[59:08] but now we see him with our eyes just
[59:11] the same amen as job did see I have
[59:13] heard of thee amen but now I see thee
[59:16] now we see him with our eyes can I say
[59:19] it to you like this in other words now
[59:21] amen we understand him now now we see
[59:25] him now amen we understand his ways we
[59:28] understand his word now you all know the
[59:30] the prophet of God says it like this he
[59:32] said now in the last days we are given
[59:34] the understanding by the word amen that
[59:37] we are going to understand it because
[59:40] it'll come to an Ephesian age to it so
[59:43] in the last days there has to come an
[59:46] understanding in the church to bring the
[59:48] church to another Ephesians amen which I
[59:51] said last night and Ephesians amen will
[59:54] positionally place the believer in
[59:56] Christ amen to who they are what they
[59:59] are where they come from and where
[1:00:01] they're going now I'll set you as plain
[1:00:03] as I know how I believe that we have
[1:00:05] seen the message how many could raise
[1:00:07] your hand and say you've seen the
[1:00:08] message amen we have seen the message
[1:00:10] can you raise your hand and say we've
[1:00:11] heard the message I I believe we've seen
[1:00:13] the message I believe we've heard a
[1:00:15] message amen but I believe that the time
[1:00:17] has come to declare the message I I
[1:00:19] believe this is the time he meant to to
[1:00:22] lay aside every weight to lay aside
[1:00:24] every sin to lay aside everything amen
[1:00:27] that so easily besets the church and let
[1:00:30] us run the race with patience and
[1:00:32] declare amen what God has done in this
[1:00:34] age now I love in the book of Isaiah 48
[1:00:37] verse 6 he says Thou is heard amen and
[1:00:39] see all this and will not eat declare it
[1:00:43] you have heard it you have seen it but
[1:00:45] will you not declared I have showed thee
[1:00:48] new things from this time amen even
[1:00:50] hidden things and thou didst not know
[1:00:53] them in the book of First John verse 3
[1:00:55] chapter 1 verse 3 John says that which
[1:00:58] we have seen and heard declare now when
[1:01:01] you look at this word scene it means to
[1:01:03] see with the eyes it means to see with
[1:01:05] the mind it means to perceive amen this
[1:01:08] word gives prominence to the Discerning
[1:01:10] mind when the physical side recedes this
[1:01:13] word denotes perception in general as a
[1:01:17] resulting principally from Vision it is
[1:01:19] the prominence being in the mental
[1:01:21] element now he said we have seen and
[1:01:23] then he said we have heard that word
[1:01:25] heard means not death amen it means to
[1:01:28] perceive by the ear amen what is
[1:01:30] announced in one's presence so there
[1:01:32] will be an announcement in the presence
[1:01:34] of the church and there will be somebody
[1:01:36] to accept or to hear amen the
[1:01:40] announcement that is being made amen it
[1:01:42] means to learn to give ear to or a
[1:01:45] teaching amen or a teacher now now when
[1:01:48] you see something when you hear it amen
[1:01:50] then to declare it
[1:01:52] and to declare it means to bring Tidings
[1:01:54] amen it means to Proclaim to make known
[1:01:57] openly so when you declare something
[1:01:59] you're not you're You're Not Afraid amen
[1:02:02] but you're declaring it you're
[1:02:03] proclaiming it openly now amen I love
[1:02:06] then what John goes on to say he said so
[1:02:08] these things right we unto you that your
[1:02:10] joy may be full amen he said this then
[1:02:13] is the message which we have heard of
[1:02:16] him and declare unto you amen that God
[1:02:18] is a light and then him is no Darkness
[1:02:22] at all I love what Apollo says in Acts
[1:02:24] 20 verse 27 he said I have not shunned
[1:02:28] he meant to declare unto you the whole
[1:02:31] counsel of God he said now look at this
[1:02:33] now this word shunned it's a very
[1:02:34] powerful word it means to draw back it
[1:02:37] means to let down it means to lower to
[1:02:40] withdraw it is of those who from Timothy
[1:02:42] amen hesitate to avow what they believe
[1:02:45] Amen to be unwilling to utter from Fear
[1:02:49] amen so Paul here is saying fear amen
[1:02:52] could not stop me from declaring the
[1:02:54] counsel of God Amen fear could not could
[1:02:56] not push me off of The Declaration amen
[1:02:59] that God is true
[1:03:02] is it okay to preach this morning are
[1:03:05] you with me amen amen God he is true so
[1:03:08] he was declaring amen that the word of
[1:03:10] God is not a word of fear but it's a
[1:03:13] word of authority now you all know here
[1:03:15] you're very well taught that fear is one
[1:03:17] of the greatest things that Satan has
[1:03:19] put on the church but I believe it's
[1:03:22] time to rebuke the spirit of fear I
[1:03:24] believe it's time to remember what the
[1:03:26] Bible said amen that God has not given
[1:03:28] us the spirit of fear amen but
[1:03:31] have power and of love and of a sound
[1:03:34] mind now amen you all know that fear
[1:03:37] comes in many forms one for her amen is
[1:03:39] a fear of criticism people are actually
[1:03:41] afraid to do something amen because
[1:03:43] they're afraid of criticism even they're
[1:03:46] afraid of somebody saying something
[1:03:48] about them or somebody ain't been
[1:03:50] thinking something about him amen but I
[1:03:52] want to say this this is the time Amen
[1:03:54] to rebuke fear it's the time to rebuke
[1:03:56] criticism because we have been brought
[1:03:59] upon the Earth with a responsibility
[1:04:01] amen I'm losing it in my ear amen with a
[1:04:04] responsibility to declare amen without
[1:04:07] fear without reservation without
[1:04:09] hesitation amen what God has done in
[1:04:12] this generation now and then I'll say it
[1:04:14] to you like a prophet said he said now I
[1:04:17] stand Here declaring the creator of the
[1:04:19] heavens and earth amen Jehovah God he
[1:04:22] said I stand Here declaring the Creator
[1:04:24] amen of Heaven and Earth Jehovah God he
[1:04:28] said now I claim to be a representative
[1:04:30] of
[1:04:31] stays they meant to bring a faith to his
[1:04:34] church amen so a prophet was not
[1:04:37] declaring God Amen to bring a fear upon
[1:04:39] the church he was declaring God to bring
[1:04:42] a faith in the church amen because God's
[1:04:45] provided way to declare his word amen is
[1:04:48] through the channel of prophets amen now
[1:04:51] notice he wrote the Bible by his own
[1:04:52] chosen way he chose the way his work
[1:04:55] came and that was by His prophets which
[1:04:58] were predestinated and foreordained amen
[1:05:01] being a part of God's word listen
[1:05:04] declaring the revelation of his word to
[1:05:07] that age in that time and then so when
[1:05:09] God sent a prophet on the scene he was
[1:05:12] not declaring just the word but he was
[1:05:14] declaring the revelation of the word in
[1:05:17] the season that the prophet was bringing
[1:05:18] that Revelation in now you all know
[1:05:21] a little bit of modern day Prophet is a
[1:05:23] preacher right remember he said so a
[1:05:25] real true Prophet points back to the
[1:05:27] word of the Lord amen the promise of the
[1:05:30] Lord amen not the Declaration of the
[1:05:33] church is made amen but a declaration
[1:05:35] that God has made and then so a word
[1:05:38] Prophet points to the Declaration amen
[1:05:41] of the revelation of the word of God in
[1:05:44] the season that you're living I I love
[1:05:46] this study brother Brown I love these
[1:05:48] says here he says in the name of Jesus
[1:05:50] Christ I take every spirit in here amen
[1:05:53] under my control to declare the word of
[1:05:56] God Amen I take every spirit in this
[1:05:59] building under my control Amen to
[1:06:01] declare the word of God Amen why was he
[1:06:04] declaring the word of God because now
[1:06:06] there was a people on the Earth that had
[1:06:09] eyes to see they had ears to hear they
[1:06:12] had a heart to believe I'm on church
[1:06:14] amen God does not reveal something
[1:06:16] unless there's somebody to receive what
[1:06:18] he's revealing and then he does not send
[1:06:21] a message and let's search somebody Amen
[1:06:23] to receive the message that is sending
[1:06:25] and God who is rich in Mercy has
[1:06:27] ordained you amen and chosen you and
[1:06:30] elected you
[1:06:32] Amen to received the revelation of the
[1:06:36] word that's promised
[1:06:38] amen I said like this you really cannot
[1:06:41] declare something until you've seen it
[1:06:44] thank you brother you really cannot
[1:06:46] declare something until you've seen it
[1:06:48] now the prophet says he reveals things
[1:06:50] amen by his foreknowledge to those who
[1:06:52] he is for ordained of these things
[1:06:54] otherwise they don't see it standing
[1:06:56] right there looking right at it and he
[1:06:57] cannot see it he says how many ever seen
[1:07:00] the picture of a cow in the bush or you
[1:07:02] just have to look and look did you ever
[1:07:03] see that or see the picture of Christ in
[1:07:05] the bush or in the sky or the clouds
[1:07:07] amen see the painter has got that Soul
[1:07:09] fixed up to you have to look at it amen
[1:07:12] just a certain way he said well then
[1:07:14] when you once see it you can't see
[1:07:16] nothing else about that amen every time
[1:07:19] you look at it there it is amen it's
[1:07:22] always been there amen but you could not
[1:07:25] see it until somebody pointed it out to
[1:07:27] you and I don't know maybe some of you
[1:07:29] all been there in Arizona they're in
[1:07:30] Tucson amen and if you're standing there
[1:07:32] in Eagle Rock looking up and then you
[1:07:34] can see a rock and in that rock is the
[1:07:37] formation and then you actually see a
[1:07:39] prophet profile amen right there bro
[1:07:41] remember his face right there in the
[1:07:43] face of that rock now I met hundreds and
[1:07:45] thousands of people to her through there
[1:07:46] every day and they never see it amen
[1:07:49] when I was there one time and brother
[1:07:50] Doug Baker he points it out to me and
[1:07:52] now every time I'm standing there amen
[1:07:54] that's all I can see see amen before it
[1:07:57] was pointed out I could not see it amen
[1:08:00] but when it was made so clear amen and I
[1:08:02] seen it I could see nothing else he said
[1:08:05] well that's
[1:08:06] the way Christ is himself the gospel
[1:08:08] amen the message is when you want see
[1:08:11] the message of the hour amen there's
[1:08:14] nothing else you can see but that amen
[1:08:16] everything else is gone amen the rest of
[1:08:19] it is just feel or see when you want see
[1:08:22] the message and then when you watch see
[1:08:25] the message amen everything else is
[1:08:27] filler when you once see the message
[1:08:29] everything
[1:08:31] paints off of the scene amen and you are
[1:08:33] seeing Christ and then you're not seeing
[1:08:36] a book you're not seeing a tape you're
[1:08:37] not hearing a sermon amen but you have
[1:08:40] come into contact amen with the person
[1:08:42] of the message and let me just go and
[1:08:45] say the person of the message is none
[1:08:47] other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] ain't that the person of the message is
[1:08:53] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:56] amen I believe that's what we need today
[1:08:58] amen is a personal face-to-face contact
[1:09:00] with God and in that face-to-face
[1:09:03] contact with God takes place amen then
[1:09:05] that will bring a fellowship are you
[1:09:08] hearing me a face-to-face contact even
[1:09:10] that will bring a fellowship amen can I
[1:09:13] cut a party for a second brother Brad
[1:09:15] amen if brother Brad's stand here facing
[1:09:17] that wall amen he's facing that wall and
[1:09:19] I'm standing here and I'm trying to talk
[1:09:21] to him I'm saying uh my name is Andrew
[1:09:23] how are you doing what's your name where
[1:09:25] did you come from amen there's no
[1:09:27] Fellowship I'm looking at him but he's
[1:09:29] not looking at me but if brother Brad
[1:09:31] turns around amen and I look at him he
[1:09:33] looks at me I can say I'm Andrew he can
[1:09:36] tell me his name we can shake hands see
[1:09:38] and now we can Fellowship thank you
[1:09:40] buddy we can now Fellowship because
[1:09:42] we're facing each other and do you see
[1:09:45] what this message is amen this message
[1:09:47] is bringing you peace amen with out of
[1:09:51] Abraham the god of Isaac amen where
[1:09:53] you're not just standing there amen
[1:09:55] looking at God reading about God Amen
[1:09:58] but God has turned around and he's
[1:10:00] looking at you face to face eye to eye
[1:10:03] I'm on church amen this ain't the hour
[1:10:05] to back off it's just the hour to
[1:10:07] declare I know him I believe him I have
[1:10:11] seen him I have heard him I have
[1:10:13] received him amen what's happening
[1:10:15] through this message amen you are coming
[1:10:17] into a fellowship you have seen God face
[1:10:20] to face you have seen him eye to eye
[1:10:22] amen and now you can't have fellowship
[1:10:25] with him I love what John says he says
[1:10:27] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:10:30] yeah
[1:10:32] and with his son Jesus Christ you know
[1:10:35] if that Word Fellowship means it means
[1:10:37] the association the community the
[1:10:39] communion amen The Joint participation
[1:10:42] it is exhibiting an embodiment and a
[1:10:45] proof of Fellowship amen so when you're
[1:10:47] actually fellowshipping with something
[1:10:49] you're actually you're actually
[1:10:50] embodying amen what's your fellowship
[1:10:53] been with amen I love what the prophet
[1:10:55] says he said many of you can fellowship
[1:10:57] with me on this thought amen when you
[1:10:59] was a little boy or a little girl a man
[1:11:01] you would walk around there would be
[1:11:03] certain things it would just well it
[1:11:04] didn't bother other kids but it was
[1:11:06] something like you in you cried out he
[1:11:09] said there was a god somewhere yet you
[1:11:11] were a sinner you remember that amen now
[1:11:13] what was that that was that little form
[1:11:15] of life that was in you then see and
[1:11:18] then after a while amen you heard the
[1:11:21] gospel maybe you went to church you
[1:11:22] picked out this and that went from the
[1:11:24] nomination to the nomination amen but
[1:11:26] one day you being a part of God you had
[1:11:29] to be a part of the word and when you
[1:11:31] heard the word you knew where you come
[1:11:34] from you know what was the truth you
[1:11:36] were always amen the seed was in you
[1:11:39] always amen come on church amen you were
[1:11:42] the embodiment of the predestinated seed
[1:11:45] of almighty God Amen and when that seed
[1:11:48] would become quickened it would produce
[1:11:50] a fellowship between you and the life of
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ amen the word seen the word
[1:11:56] can you say amen amen that was before
[1:11:59] for the foundation of the world Amen saw
[1:12:02] the word and you come to it can I say
[1:12:05] this you were called by the word
[1:12:09] you were not called by the music you
[1:12:11] were not called by a preacher you were
[1:12:13] not called by special meaning amen you
[1:12:15] were called by the word in other words
[1:12:18] the written word amen called out to the
[1:12:21] predestinated word and there was a union
[1:12:23] took place amen and you are the
[1:12:25] embodiment of the fellowship amen of the
[1:12:28] written word and the predestinated word
[1:12:30] in the age that you're living I don't
[1:12:32] know how else to say it other than just
[1:12:34] to say it you didn't claim this message
[1:12:36] this message claimed you
[1:12:38] amen amen amen you didn't claim this
[1:12:40] message this message you were actually
[1:12:43] claimed by the message that's why John
[1:12:46] said this then is the message which we
[1:12:48] have heard of him and declaring to you
[1:12:50] amen that God is light and then him is
[1:12:54] no Darkness at all I look at this here
[1:12:56] the prophet of God said the layout of
[1:12:58] sin age amen is supposed to receive a
[1:13:01] message Malachi 4 said they would
[1:13:03] another place she said we as this group
[1:13:05] of people we have a message for this day
[1:13:08] amen we believe that God has given us a
[1:13:11] message amen that if God has given us a
[1:13:14] message what kind of message will it be
[1:13:16] it will be a scriptural message the
[1:13:19] problem God said like this he said when
[1:13:21] God is in it a message is going to
[1:13:23] follow that amen and the message must be
[1:13:26] from the scripture that must be a
[1:13:29] scriptural message it must come thus
[1:13:32] saith the Lord another place he said I
[1:13:35] like the message to be God constructed
[1:13:36] with the scriptures amen scriptural
[1:13:39] message and right there with it
[1:13:40] everything with the scripture it's thus
[1:13:43] saith the Lord then and it's got to
[1:13:45] stand because it isn't my word in
[1:13:47] question it'll be his word it's in
[1:13:49] question amen bringing it from the
[1:13:51] scripture we are not following a message
[1:13:54] that is based upon the ideas of a
[1:13:57] denomination where you're not following
[1:13:59] a message that is based upon the
[1:14:00] Traditions that has been passed down
[1:14:02] through generation amen We are following
[1:14:05] a scripture God constructed the saith
[1:14:08] the Lord amen Vindicated amen infallible
[1:14:12] perfect amen message there listen
[1:14:14] friends if this message is not perfect
[1:14:16] then how are you going to come to
[1:14:18] Perfection you do not bring something
[1:14:20] imperfect to Perfection by something
[1:14:22] imperfect but if you're going to bring
[1:14:24] something to Perfection you gotta lead
[1:14:27] it by Perfection and we have a perfect
[1:14:29] word we have a perfect interpretation we
[1:14:33] have a perfect faith we have a perfect
[1:14:34] word listen and that has brought us to a
[1:14:37] perfection
[1:14:39] now hey man I'd just like to tell you
[1:14:41] this woman for a few moments amen from
[1:14:43] the message amen what the messenger said
[1:14:45] the message yes amen 1953 he said the
[1:14:48] message is ready and the power of God is
[1:14:51] sufficient amen men and women are scared
[1:14:54] to break out your under into those fears
[1:14:57] before God and dare to trust him and
[1:14:59] take his word amen 1957 he said you
[1:15:02] don't come to church just to hear a
[1:15:04] message or to see a messenger amen the
[1:15:06] message is the holy spirit amen taking
[1:15:09] the word of God and giving it to you the
[1:15:13] message is the holy spirit taking the
[1:15:15] word of God and giving it to you another
[1:15:18] place you said now 1957 then Jesus came
[1:15:21] he said now if I understand the
[1:15:23] scriptures right I believe that there's
[1:15:25] gifts that comes into the church that
[1:15:27] the Holy Spirit speaks and pronounces to
[1:15:30] his people the things he wants to do and
[1:15:33] therefore the people who spoke was just
[1:15:35] an order after they got through speaking
[1:15:37] and now the message gifts to the people
[1:15:40] that he has already did the blessing for
[1:15:43] you it's for you to receive it amen so
[1:15:47] the message of Malachi 4 is a scriptural
[1:15:50] bus saith the Lord message that is
[1:15:52] pointing you back to a finished work and
[1:15:55] is declaring to you even you don't have
[1:15:57] to work for it you don't have to earn it
[1:15:59] the only thing you have to do amen is
[1:16:02] receive what he's already done amen for
[1:16:05] you that day of Calvary amen all church
[1:16:07] of living God Amen if you could see this
[1:16:10] morning that you're already saved amen
[1:16:12] you're already healed you're already
[1:16:14] delivered you're already set free you're
[1:16:17] already redeemed amen you have just got
[1:16:19] to receive amen what God has already
[1:16:22] done
[1:16:24] and then I love it I love that the
[1:16:26] protagon goes another place now 1961. he
[1:16:30] said the message is to God's children
[1:16:31] amen it's not to any certain
[1:16:33] organization amen it is to God's
[1:16:36] children it is the rise of the son 65.
[1:16:39] he said the message is to the believer
[1:16:42] amen the message is to the believer to
[1:16:46] them that perish it's foolishness amen
[1:16:48] but to them better in Christ amen and
[1:16:51] are a part of that seed in his life amen
[1:16:54] can I give you another one except the
[1:16:56] message is absolutely urgent amen the
[1:16:59] message is urgent don't stop amen keep
[1:17:02] going just keep moving we haven't got
[1:17:04] time for socials and picnics and cart
[1:17:06] parties amen the message is urgent amen
[1:17:10] can I give you another one he said the
[1:17:12] message is on my heart it meant the
[1:17:15] messages on my heart I must get it out
[1:17:18] amen that's my Soul Purpose regardless
[1:17:20] of what but my wife says what my
[1:17:23] children says what my pastor says my
[1:17:26] whatever says amen it's my Lord and I
[1:17:29] must get it out amen so there was a
[1:17:31] burden upon the heart of a prophet Amen
[1:17:34] to declare the revelation of the word
[1:17:36] amen to the people that needed it amen
[1:17:39] because the only way we're going to get
[1:17:41] out of time amen and back into eternity
[1:17:43] is by the preaching of the message of
[1:17:46] the hour
[1:17:47] now hey man I just sent you like this
[1:17:50] amen this is my favorite one amen the
[1:17:52] message is right are you hearing me amen
[1:17:56] the message is Right amen amen we
[1:18:00] believe that right the message is right
[1:18:02] he said because God sent the message God
[1:18:05] sent the messenger and no doubt that
[1:18:07] every gun of Hell will be firing at him
[1:18:10] that's right he will stumble and he will
[1:18:13] fall but he will get up and shake his
[1:18:15] head and go on Amen the messenger
[1:18:18] bringing the message will stumble
[1:18:21] and he will fall but he will get up he
[1:18:24] will shake his head and he will go on he
[1:18:26] said we got a message and nothing is
[1:18:30] it's going to stop it I'm on church I
[1:18:33] mean if the messenger who was bringing
[1:18:35] the message amen had such a street amen
[1:18:38] from the message that he was bringing a
[1:18:40] minute he would stumble and he would
[1:18:42] fall but he would get up and he would
[1:18:43] shake his head and he would keep on
[1:18:45] going amen then how much more power does
[1:18:48] that message have in the people who have
[1:18:51] received that message listen if it'll
[1:18:53] make the messenger get up in all the
[1:18:55] Metro Church get up if it'll make the
[1:18:57] messenger keep on going it all to make
[1:18:59] the church keep up now come on church

[1:22:56] Quicken your Immortal bodies even then
[1:22:59] the life that you now live is the lie
[1:23:02] for the Son of God and you don't live at
[1:23:04] my works you don't live in my feelings
[1:23:06] you don't live it by sensation but you
[1:23:08] live it by the faith of the Son of God
[1:23:10] who loved you and died for you listen
[1:23:12] friends I will announce to you amen the
[1:23:15] Supreme deity of God is back in the
[1:23:17] church

[1:23:25] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ if you
[1:23:28] could ever realize who he was and what
[1:23:30] he did for you men and women amen your
[1:23:32] hearts would ran within you and you
[1:23:34] would be willing to throw away the trash
[1:23:36] of the world to live for him amen if you
[1:23:39] would ever see who he is

[1:23:59] Supreme deity of almighty God now if you
[1:24:01] want to find Supreme deity it's in the
[1:24:04] Book of Revelation the first chapter and
[1:24:06] the eighth verse Jesus says I am Alpha

[1:24:11] ending amen saith the Lord which is
[1:24:13] which was and which is to come amen the
[1:24:16] almighty now the prophet of God says
[1:24:18] amen saying I am Alpha Omega first and
[1:24:20] last it is not the announcement of the
[1:24:23] second party or the third party but the
[1:24:25] only party amen I'm the alpha and omega

[1:24:41] our Lord Jesus Christ amen then it's
[1:24:44] time to declare the greatest of all the
[1:24:47] Revelation is the Supreme deity of our

[1:24:52] Revelation is the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:24:55] Christ you must know who he is amen when
[1:24:58] you hear his voice
[1:25:01] in Revelation 3 and verse 8 Jesus says
[1:25:04] amen I Know Thy works and behold I have
[1:25:07] set before thee an open door and no man
[1:25:09] can shut it amen for thou Hast little
[1:25:12] strength and has kept my word and has
[1:25:15] not denied my name amen look at this
[1:25:17] Open Door what was it it was the
[1:25:20] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:25:23] Christ amen not being a second person of
[1:25:26] a trinity amen but being God himself
[1:25:28] made flesh amen and dwelling Among Us
[1:25:31] amen so the open door amen was the
[1:25:34] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ amen being God in flesh made
[1:25:39] manifest among us if you want to see the
[1:25:42] Revelation here it is where he would
[1:25:44] build his church and the only way he
[1:25:46] could take
[1:25:47] his church amen is back to the
[1:25:50] revelation of what he is amen so God
[1:25:52] claims the Church of the revelation of
[1:25:55] himself and the age that that church is
[1:25:57] living in come on it's in your book
[1:26:00] Christ is the mystery he said God
[1:26:01] reveals himself in a threefold purpose
[1:26:04] the first phone is he reveals himself
[1:26:07] amen the second thought is he takes pm
[1:26:09] and that's and the third fold is he
[1:26:12] takes a bride back to the Garden of Eden
[1:26:13] can I show you right there come on now
[1:26:16] right there is a prophet declaring amen
[1:26:19] what he would later say or earlier say
[1:26:21] rather in the seventh seal he said now
[1:26:23] the seventh seal will be revealed in a
[1:26:25] threefold manner right it's on your tape
[1:26:27] he said will be revealed in a threefold
[1:26:29] manner amen now if you want to find that
[1:26:31] it's in the message it's in Christ the
[1:26:33] mystery he reveals himself in a
[1:26:34] threefold purpose it's in your rapture
[1:26:37] book it's a shout it's a voice and it's
[1:26:39] a trumpet listen France Jesus Christ is
[1:26:42] not stealing you from the Devil he's not
[1:26:44] stealing you from laodicea when he takes
[1:26:47] you in Iraq sure he is taking you by the
[1:26:49] revelation of himself that has claimed
[1:26:52] you in the age you're living listen
[1:26:54] France if you reclaim my feelings then
[1:26:56] feelings will take you out if you are
[1:26:58] claimed by emotion that emotion will
[1:27:00] take you out but if you have been
[1:27:02] claimed by the revelation of Jesus
[1:27:05] Christ there ain't enough devils in hell
[1:27:07] in time or in laodicea
[1:27:10] they've been to take you out of the plan
[1:27:13] of God
[1:27:15] now come on let's not come up to it and
[1:27:17] back off of it we have been claimed by
[1:27:20] the revelation of the word of God you
[1:27:22] say preacher where are you going to fix
[1:27:24] I'll tell you where I'm going with this
[1:27:25] we're going to leave layout and see
[1:27:27] about Revelation we're going to take a
[1:27:29] Rapture by Revelation we're going to
[1:27:31] walk on the streets of gold by
[1:27:33] Revelation come on some of y'all right
[1:27:35] now you don't even feel like you're
[1:27:37] going to be there and that's the reason
[1:27:38] why it's cause the devil's lying to you
[1:27:40] the fat devil is a liar and he's the
[1:27:43] father of all lies but I come here this
[1:27:45] morning to take every Spirit under my
[1:27:48] control so I can declare the word of God
[1:27:50] I can declare the Revelation and the
[1:27:53] revelation of the word says you are the
[1:27:56] sinless Spotless Justified amen by the
[1:27:59] Jesus Christ it is as told you never
[1:28:02] even done it in the first place why
[1:28:04] don't you let Revelation amen lift you
[1:28:07] up out of the ash heat why don't you let
[1:28:09] Revelation lift you up into a place
[1:28:11] where you can see God
[1:28:14] amen he claims you by the revelation of
[1:28:17] himself where he would build his church
[1:28:19] that's the only way he could take his
[1:28:21] church is back to the revelation of what
[1:28:24] he is now not what he was or what he
[1:28:26] will be what he is because what he is is
[1:28:28] what he was and what he was is what he
[1:28:30] will be and what he will be is what he
[1:28:32] is and what he is is what he was
[1:28:35] and what he wants is what he will be and
[1:28:38] what he will be is what he is and what
[1:28:40] he is is what he was
[1:28:44] come on church it's the identified
[1:28:46] Christ of all ages he's the same
[1:28:48] yesterday today and forever you say what
[1:28:52] is the identifying characteristic of God
[1:28:54] he is the unchanging God and he has
[1:28:57] unchanging ways oh I tell you what
[1:28:59] that's enough to Shadow on this morning
[1:29:01] amen is to know that our God is the
[1:29:04] unchanging God time is changing churches
[1:29:07] are changing world is changing politics
[1:29:09] brother Valor everything's changing amen
[1:29:12] but there is a God who is seated at the
[1:29:15] right hand of the father in majesty and
[1:29:17] power this morning and he is the
[1:29:19] unchanging God and His word never
[1:29:21] changes his leads never changes his love
[1:29:24] never changes oh God we change every day
[1:29:28] but he is the unchanging God so there's
[1:29:31] nobody could ever stop the message of
[1:29:35] the Supreme deity and the baptism in the
[1:29:37] name of Jesus Christ listen the Gates of
[1:29:40] Hell will never Prevail against it are
[1:29:43] you with me now he revealed it in the
[1:29:46] church at Ephesus is that right and that
[1:29:48] was when the light first broke through
[1:29:49] to shine the Christian Light the Holy
[1:29:52] Ghost age started right here in Ephesus
[1:29:55] and the prophet said there would come a
[1:29:57] day that wouldn't be night or day but in
[1:29:58] the evening light would come back again
[1:30:00] you see it see the day of this will come
[1:30:02] across through here all this here in
[1:30:04] this organization but in the last days
[1:30:07] over here way down here he would set
[1:30:09] that open door and Jesus said I am that
[1:30:13] door come on Amen for seven Gentile ages
[1:30:16] you can look across amen and you can see
[1:30:19] at the End Amen what was in the
[1:30:21] beginning would be at the ending because
[1:30:23] he is the Alpha and the Omega he that
[1:30:26] was is and shall come come on church he
[1:30:29] can look all the way across those Seven
[1:30:31] Ages and oh I love how many represents
[1:30:34] and it's beautiful he said he is the
[1:30:36] creator of his own bride right he said
[1:30:38] therefore he could create his breath he
[1:30:40] said he could stand right here Amen in
[1:30:42] the very first age and he could look all
[1:30:45] the way over to the end and he would say
[1:30:47] these words and still see himself
[1:30:50] he could still see himself where would
[1:30:53] he see himself at amen First Seven Ages
[1:30:56] they've been trying to put him out for
[1:30:57] Seven Ages Darkness has been increasing
[1:31:00] amen but in the end time the same light
[1:31:02] that shown in the beginning would return
[1:31:04] In the End Amen and Jesus Christ the
[1:31:07] resurrected Lord would be standing there
[1:31:10] as an Open Door they said come on church
[1:31:12] it's the Fulfillment of Revelation 18.
[1:31:14] come out of her my people why did he say
[1:31:17] come out of her because they put him out
[1:31:20] and they would not let him back in
[1:31:23] come on they put him out and they would
[1:31:25] not let him back in so in order to have
[1:31:27] access to his people the only way he
[1:31:29] could do it was Austin was he had to
[1:31:31] call you out he had to call you out and
[1:31:34] that's why the prophet introduced the
[1:31:36] term the bride age and said for the
[1:31:38] first time there will be for the coming
[1:31:40] forth of the Bride for the bride coming
[1:31:42] of Christ there
[1:31:43] will be a bride age listen I know people
[1:31:46] I hope I can take some Liberty I know
[1:31:48] people get all tore up and say or you
[1:31:50] can't preach Fridays you can't say right
[1:31:51] age because somebody somebody said it
[1:31:54] somebody amen listen before anybody
[1:31:56] Twisted it a prophet told it so let's
[1:31:58] teach the original and forget the false
[1:32:01] and remember when a prophet saying that
[1:32:03] this is the broad age listen friends
[1:32:06] this is the age when the Supreme deity
[1:32:08] of Jesus Christ is manifesting in his
[1:32:11] bride oh that's why the prophet said one
[1:32:13] of my favorite songs is down from his
[1:32:16] glory amen how many ever heard that song
[1:32:18] Oh What A Story down from his glory
[1:32:21] every living story my God and savior
[1:32:24] came and Jesus
[1:32:27] and Jesus was his name are you hearing
[1:32:31] me verification in an age where they're
[1:32:33] trying to make him just a prophet
[1:32:34] they're trying to make him just a
[1:32:36] teacher he said I love that song Amen
[1:32:39] because that song Amen refers to the
[1:32:42] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ he said
[1:32:46] that song expresses the Supreme deity of
[1:32:49] Jesus Christ what are you saying
[1:32:51] preacher I'm saying this he has come
[1:32:54] down are you hearing me he has come down
[1:32:57] now now when you start talking about
[1:32:59] this I know people uh sometimes they'll
[1:33:01] say well we got to be careful we got to
[1:33:03] place these things a certain way but you
[1:33:05] know what I believe amen I believe that
[1:33:07] there is that there has been an
[1:33:09] appearing of the Lord in this generation
[1:33:11] now I know I know some of y'all here are
[1:33:13] probably familiar with this picture I
[1:33:15] I'm sure you are you're familiar with it
[1:33:17] it may not do you realize what this is
[1:33:19] this is not just a picture it's not just
[1:33:22] it's not just something to argue and to
[1:33:25] fuss about this is actually an
[1:33:27] announcement it's a message now what are
[1:33:29] you saying because the Bible says
[1:33:31] Revelation 10 1 that I saw another
[1:33:33] Mighty Angel come down from heaven and
[1:33:37] he was clothed with a cloud and a
[1:33:39] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:33:41] as it were the Sun and his feet his
[1:33:43] pillars of fire let me see if I can
[1:33:45] maybe prop that up there his face as it
[1:33:47] were amen his feet as pillars of fire I
[1:33:50] want you to catch something here he says
[1:33:52] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:33:55] amen what did he say he said oh how I
[1:33:58] love him amen down from his glory are
[1:34:02] you hearing me it's not about our sin
[1:34:04] going up amen he come up no he come down
[1:34:07] now you say preacher why are you
[1:34:09] emphasizing on that because he come down
[1:34:11] and what appear Now Fair in Arizona was
[1:34:14] ahead now you all hear probably how many
[1:34:16] got driver's license
[1:34:19] uh even if you're driving don't have one
[1:34:20] it's okay
[1:34:22] no no I'm just kidding it's a joke

[1:34:26] that I said in the church and I said I
[1:34:28] said how many here got their driver's
[1:34:30] license and one sister he didn't raise
[1:34:32] your hand you know straight to church we

[1:34:35] driving off and I thought Dear God
[1:34:38] so you know I have a license so somebody
[1:34:39] told me he said well she didn't need a
[1:34:40] license she got keys so listen go get a
[1:34:42] license moving on okay all right but
[1:34:45] better license now own your driver's
[1:34:48] license you got a picture and on that
[1:34:50] picture it's not your foot

[1:35:02] are you hearing me Amen on that picture
[1:35:05] is your face
[1:35:07] is your hand listen the only part that
[1:35:11] identifying you is your hand listen your
[1:35:15] hand does not identify you your foot is
[1:35:17] not an end but your face which is the
[1:35:20] headship of your body is on the driver's
[1:35:22] license and it identifies you oh church
[1:35:25] are you hearing me do you realize what
[1:35:27] this was amen this was a cloud that
[1:35:30] appeared and missed the cloud 1960s

[1:35:40] I asked brother Jack I said brother Jack
[1:35:42] is this Jesus in his glorified body he
[1:35:45] said no he said that didn't mean he

[1:35:49] said Jack said it was Jesus glorified
[1:35:51] body I said brother Jack man don't ring
[1:35:53] a bell he said so I went back in the
[1:35:55] room and he said when I went in the room

[1:35:59] the room Oh my he said now as I was
[1:36:01] looking at this he said as I was homing

[1:36:19] chariots everything he said but when a
[1:36:22] prophet walked out there and he said now
[1:36:24] listen if you'll take that picture and
[1:36:26] you'll turn it to the right he said oh
[1:36:28] he said there was an audible gasp amen
[1:36:31] went across the congregation he said
[1:36:33] these words he said see turn it to the
[1:36:35] right and there is Jesus as he was in

[1:36:52] message of this hour listen friends when
[1:36:55] that cloud appeared it was not an

[1:37:03] upon the Earth to identify come on
[1:37:06] Church whether you want to believe it or
[1:37:07] not this is your head
[1:37:10] this is your hand now come on cause I

[1:37:17] baller it's his head stirring up at the
[1:37:19] sky when he appeared in the sky he's
[1:37:21] looking down why is he looking down
[1:37:24] because he's looking for his body he's
[1:37:27] looking for his body come on church and
[1:37:30] who is his body you are the mystical
[1:37:33] body of Jesus Christ listen friends we
[1:37:36] are not looking for headship headship is
[1:37:38] here we are not looking for Rapture in
[1:37:41] faith rap stream faith is here we have
[1:37:43] been claimed by the Supreme deity of
[1:37:46] Jesus Christ I love what the problem God
[1:37:49] says he said before he reveals the
[1:37:51] characteristic of the last age he gives
[1:37:53] us one final look at his own gracious
[1:37:55] and supreme deity this is the Capstone
[1:37:59] revelation of himself amen the catched
[1:38:02] on Revelation of himself is the Supreme
[1:38:05] deity of himself having preeminence
[1:38:08] Enterprise come on Church we're not at
[1:38:11] the bottom of the pyramid we're not even
[1:38:13] halfway up we have climbed Seven Ages
[1:38:16] and we're standing on the seventh Peak
[1:38:18] amen and the hits on this come listen
[1:38:21] church this message is our leadership
[1:38:24] come on somebody this message is our
[1:38:27] leadership what are you saying I'm
[1:38:29] saying when the prophet said the message
[1:38:31] he is he goes before us he's not in a
[1:38:35] tomb behind us he is before us making a
[1:38:38] way we are to follow not to look back to
[1:38:41] the tomb but to look forward to where
[1:38:43] he's leading us amen for he is our
[1:38:46] leader we are to follow him amen not
[1:38:49] look back to the tombs come on church
[1:38:51] this bride does not go back she goes
[1:38:54] forward amen and the only way she can go
[1:38:57] forward is somebody has to lead her
[1:38:59] somebody has to be the leadership
[1:39:02] something Brother Brad has to be the
[1:39:04] headship a headless body has no
[1:39:07] Direction a headless body goes in
[1:39:09] circles but when there's a head with an
[1:39:12] intelligence then there's a direction to
[1:39:14] lead the church forward
[1:39:16] now I'm just going to take a little time
[1:39:19] here as I'm as I'm moving through this
[1:39:21] I'm not going to preach all day but I'm
[1:39:22] gonna say this amen what is our
[1:39:24] leadership
[1:39:26] what is leading us now you say preacher
[1:39:29] amen the message well is it really
[1:39:31] because I have met people Amen in
[1:39:34] ministering around around the world by
[1:39:36] God's grace I've met people and you know
[1:39:38] what they say the message is our
[1:39:39] leadership and I talked to about five
[1:39:41] minutes and I realized the message ain't
[1:39:43] their leadership what somebody thinks
[1:39:45] about the message is their leadership
[1:39:49] hope it's okay are you hearing me the
[1:39:52] message really is not well somebody told
[1:39:54] him I remember one time I was fellowship
[1:39:56] with your brothers and I
[1:40:01] and one guy he got to talking he said
[1:40:04] now you know he said there's two Lords I
[1:40:06] said oh really two Lords he said yeah I
[1:40:07] said there's two Lords I said wow I said
[1:40:10] amazing to me as the Bible says there's
[1:40:11] one and the devil shakes I said what if
[1:40:13] there was two it'd probably fall over I
[1:40:15] just kind of joke you know he said you
[1:40:17] mean to tell me you don't believe in two
[1:40:18] Lords I said come on brother prove it to
[1:40:20] me from the Bible he said well he said
[1:40:22] over there in the book of Psalms the
[1:40:24] Bible says my lord said to his Lord amen
[1:40:26] sitting here on my right hand I may call
[1:40:28] the Amy's thy footstool he said right
[1:40:30] there's two Lords I said brother have
[1:40:32] you not studied what a prophet said he
[1:40:34] said oh yes I have I said well tell me
[1:40:35] what he's saying he'd give me about
[1:40:37] about five or ten minutes worth of stuff
[1:40:39] you couldn't time that being out of it
[1:40:41] in the message and I said well why don't
[1:40:43] we just say what brother Brandon said he
[1:40:45] should say I said he said he was both
[1:40:47] root in offspring of David good enough
[1:40:49] for me
[1:40:50] right he was both root and Offspring and
[1:40:52] David that said listen so that's when
[1:40:54] some more Brothers a while back a while
[1:40:56] after that and we were kind of talking
[1:40:57] and they got to tell me and one brother
[1:40:59] wasn't even around that previous
[1:41:01] conversation and he starts telling me
[1:41:03] word for word what the other guy told me
[1:41:05] and he starts telling me and when he
[1:41:07] gets done I said brother where'd you
[1:41:08] give that he said I got it from brother
[1:41:10] so and so I said oh so that must have
[1:41:12] been where brother so and so see they
[1:41:14] get stuff and it doesn't come from the
[1:41:16] Bible it doesn't come from the message
[1:41:17] and then here's where the problem is
[1:41:19] when you refuse to follow it then you're
[1:41:21] an unbeliever you're not a message
[1:41:23] believer you're serpent seat but as a
[1:41:26] genuine believer of this end time word I
[1:41:28] am only under obligation to follow one
[1:41:31] thing and that is the headship of Christ
[1:41:33] that is descended into this age and it
[1:41:36] is the Capstone it is The Headstone
[1:41:38] listen I am not under obligation to
[1:41:41] follow your opinions we are not under
[1:41:43] obligation to follow your home
[1:41:48] y'all know I'm
[1:41:50] telling you the truth amen all kinds of
[1:41:53] ideas creep in and then you can't prove
[1:41:55] them by the message and then well
[1:41:58] so that's why you got to preach the
[1:42:00] message because the the message is the
[1:42:04] headship now brother I'll just say like
[1:42:05] this brother Balor you have personal
[1:42:07] connections I have personal connections
[1:42:10] brother Brian you have personal connect
[1:42:11] we all have personal convictions but
[1:42:14] when it comes to the pulpit the only
[1:42:16] thing that belongs in the Pulpit is the
[1:42:19] word
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:24] only thing that belongs in the world now
[1:42:27] y'all know I'm telling you the truth I
[1:42:29] met a guy one time he said brother he
[1:42:31] said why don't you preach this so he
[1:42:32] started telling me all about it I said
[1:42:33] whether that's your personal conviction
[1:42:35] he said that's right he said it all to
[1:42:37] be preached he said go in the Pulpit
[1:42:38] preaching I said brother you crazy if
[1:42:41] you think I'm gonna go preacher
[1:42:42] conviction when I don't even preach my
[1:42:43] own
[1:42:45] laughs
[1:42:46] come on if I don't even preach my own
[1:42:49] personal convictions I sure ain't gonna
[1:42:51] preach yours because I'm under a Mark 16
[1:42:54] commission I've got to preach the gospel
[1:42:56] listens oh God I hope it's okay amen
[1:43:01] sometimes you can build personal
[1:43:03] convictions and they're good but they're
[1:43:06] not you you cannot you cannot lead the
[1:43:08] church by them
[1:43:10] hell glory to God
[1:43:16] can't leave the church by because you
[1:43:18] have no less sense Lord to stand by it
[1:43:20] come on it's your purse and there's
[1:43:22] nothing wrong with it have it enjoy it
[1:43:24] believe it raise your family back but
[1:43:26] don't put us in hell cause we don't
[1:43:28] follow it
[1:43:33] that's why God send a message
[1:43:36] so when we come to the pulpit we would
[1:43:38] all be saying the same thing
[1:43:42] now you all know I'm telling you the
[1:43:44] truth when we come to the message we
[1:43:46] witness land well brother so and so
[1:43:48] thanks and this one thanks but we would
[1:43:50] be studying the message and preaching on
[1:43:52] a prophet
[1:43:54] oh
[1:43:55] and it would be bringing a spiritual
[1:43:58] unity in the body now let me say this to
[1:44:00] you the message of the hour remember his
[1:44:03] names he said but in this church age he
[1:44:05] said the message is being poured
[1:44:07] somebody say poor it's being poured into
[1:44:10] the church now watch this he said this
[1:44:12] Tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[1:44:14] Tabernacle there is no such a thing he
[1:44:16] said individuals that come into this
[1:44:18] church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles
[1:44:21] they are Tabernacles that contain the
[1:44:24] Holy Ghost
[1:44:26] but not the church and the body a group
[1:44:28] he said but what this man who was
[1:44:30] pouring the water the messenger to the
[1:44:33] church listen was pouring the message
[1:44:35] into the church but what was the water
[1:44:37] doing he said it was bullying all the
[1:44:40] trash that was in it whoa it was
[1:44:44] bullying all the trash out that was in
[1:44:46] the so you had seven Church ages and
[1:44:49] every age had trash in it but when God
[1:44:52] sent a star if a message to declare the
[1:44:55] revelation of the word for that age and
[1:44:58] he began to pour that message in the
[1:45:01] message began to wash the trash out well
[1:45:03] we might as well preach amen because
[1:45:05] that's what Jesus did in Luke the 24th
[1:45:08] chapter when he raised from the dead and
[1:45:11] he was walking with the two on the road
[1:45:13] to Emmaus you know what they said they
[1:45:15] said if thou not a stranger around here
[1:45:16] do you not know the events that's taking
[1:45:18] place amen remember they were full of
[1:45:21] complexes they were full of fears they
[1:45:23] were full of sadness they were full of
[1:45:25] confusion and then they were all tore up
[1:45:27] and here they are walking with Jesus now
[1:45:30] listen what a prophet says he said and
[1:45:32] Jesus was walk with him and he never
[1:45:34] started arguing
[1:45:38] he never started arguing with him or
[1:45:40] talking watch what he did he went
[1:45:43] straight to the word he said see you're
[1:45:45] all confused one says this one says that
[1:45:47] one says this one says something else
[1:45:49] but base your thoughts on thus saith
[1:45:51] Lord and God will confirm it now watch
[1:45:54] this Jesus went straight to the word and
[1:45:57] he began to pour the word in he did not
[1:46:00] argue with him he did not fuss with him
[1:46:02] he just went to the word and he began to
[1:46:05] pour the word in and he began to say oh
[1:46:07] fools and slow of Hearts who has
[1:46:09] Bewitched you amen not to understand
[1:46:11] he's
[1:46:13] see he went back to the Old Testament
[1:46:14] and began to prove how the Christ should
[1:46:17] suffer and raise the third day and
[1:46:19] brother John by the time he got done
[1:46:21] pouring the water in he had washed all
[1:46:23] their fears out he had lost all their
[1:46:25] sadness out he had lost all their
[1:46:27] questions are you hearing me what done
[1:46:30] it friends the preaching of the
[1:46:32] revelation of the word that was in
[1:46:34] season in that hour listen let me say
[1:46:36] like this it's called the washing of the
[1:46:39] Water by the word Paul said that he
[1:46:42] might sanctify and cleanse the church
[1:46:44] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:46:47] word now I know it may get a little
[1:46:48] quiet here I'm used to it but we'll get
[1:46:50] through it okay Esther purged her heart
[1:46:52] before God and she walked up with a meek
[1:46:55] and humble Spirit he said and the church
[1:46:57] is going to be the bride of Christ now
[1:46:59] remember Esther refuse the worldly
[1:47:01] adornment she took the spirit in her
[1:47:04] heart to go before the king and the
[1:47:06] woman today the church that she's going
[1:47:08] to get in because she's got numbers
[1:47:09] she's the best stressed crowd she's got
[1:47:12] the biggest organization the biggest
[1:47:13] church in the city things like that you

[1:47:33] preacher like this it gets tired but
[1:47:35] I'll go ahead and say it the church
[1:47:36] needs a washing
[1:47:39] come on church the church needs a
[1:47:42] washing that's right he said not just a
[1:47:45] part washing but a Full Gospel washing
[1:47:48] amen cleaned up made new creatures in
[1:47:50] Christ Jesus another place he said your
[1:47:53] garments Washed by the Water of the

[1:47:57] so the word bled for you and you're the
[1:48:00] washed and bleeding word Watch The Life

[1:48:05] for you that you might be washed from
[1:48:07] the filth of these prostitutes and be
[1:48:09] cleansed and Sanctified amen by the
[1:48:12] washing of the water of the word and
[1:48:14] that'll make your mind and heart State

[1:48:19] been serving God for 45 years ain't no

[1:48:26] we've been serving God for 80 years we
[1:48:29] are living in a world that's full of
[1:48:30] trash and devils and trash and
[1:48:34] they'll find their way in and you know
[1:48:37] what we need to do we need to get back
[1:48:38] to preaching them message and let the
[1:48:40] message watch the church that's the word
[1:48:42] claim the church
[1:48:44] I've seen a lot of guys get up I'm just
[1:48:48] preaching amen get up watch the church
[1:48:50] and they weren't trying to wash them by
[1:48:52] the message they was trying to wash them
[1:48:53] by their personal convictions now y'all
[1:48:56] know it's the truth well you can't do
[1:48:58] this amen before long you can't find
[1:49:00] them amen they're out somewhere wrecked
[1:49:02] up on an ass Heap and they're all wadded
[1:49:04] up and they're blaming the message
[1:49:05] listen this message is not legalism
[1:49:10] if you well Glory if you preach the
[1:49:14] message you won't have to worry about
[1:49:15] makeup coming in the church if you'll
[1:49:18] just preach the message you won't have
[1:49:19] to worry about high-heeled shoes oh are
[1:49:21] you hearing me if you just put your
[1:49:23] message you don't preach the skinny
[1:49:24] jeans right off the boys and put on a
[1:49:26] pair of pants and look like a man
[1:49:29] you gotta preach the message quit
[1:49:30] preaching your convictions and well I
[1:49:32] say preach what a prophet said a prophet
[1:49:35] well God Hammer you know why thanks crap
[1:49:37] back in it's cause people got a little
[1:49:39] bit afraid they've been to say what a
[1:49:41] prophet said he said a woman wore paint
[1:49:43] he said well you ought to say good
[1:49:45] morning Miss all Mead and some little
[1:49:47] fear come in and run back in the corner
[1:49:50] and they they quit saying it listen if
[1:49:52] you're gonna be a sit down and let
[1:49:55] somebody up this kind of backbone
[1:49:56] because these are souls and they need to
[1:49:59] hear the message of our declared in the
[1:50:02] power of the washing of the water of the
[1:50:05] word
[1:50:10] and then what does the word say now you
[1:50:12] know what the prophet of God says I love
[1:50:14] this quote I've been I've been brother
[1:50:15] brother Thomas I've been chewing on this
[1:50:17] for months he said the message is the
[1:50:20] correcting
[1:50:22] foreign
[1:50:26] another place when the church is in
[1:50:28] trouble that's when a message Goes Forth
[1:50:31] to correct the thing another place oh if
[1:50:33] the church could ever get to that place
[1:50:34] to where it can solemnly rest upon God's
[1:50:37] word
[1:50:38] Amen to you the truth what a difference
[1:50:39] there would be what a correcting there
[1:50:41] would be what a cutting away there would
[1:50:43] be what a joy there would be what a
[1:50:46] power there would be when men and women
[1:50:48] would take God at face value that what
[1:50:50] he's saying is the truth
[1:50:54] now you know what the message is to do
[1:50:56] is to correct the situation now you all
[1:50:59] know that there's been situations arise
[1:51:01] and here's what we say how we gonna fix
[1:51:03] it
[1:51:05] some of y'all been in the message for
[1:51:06] years and you've seen that you you've
[1:51:09] seen the different uh how can I say it
[1:51:11] winds of Doctrine that's come through
[1:51:13] you've seen it you've seen it come
[1:51:14] through and and sometimes now y'all just
[1:51:17] give me some Grace here but sometimes we
[1:51:19] get under a pressure to try to fix it
[1:51:24] y'all know you know what I'm talking
[1:51:26] about and it
[1:51:27] you get under pressure and so you how
[1:51:29] they gonna fix this man things are
[1:51:31] getting out of balance how we gonna fix
[1:51:32] it how we gonna correct it okay y'all
[1:51:34] ready go ahead
[1:51:36] I'm gonna give you a really deep answer
[1:51:39] it's gonna be deep okay
[1:51:41] you got a notebook piece of paper you
[1:51:43] might want to write it down it's going
[1:51:44] to be really deep
[1:51:45] how we gonna fix it are you ready preach
[1:51:47] the message
[1:51:55] it's very deep
[1:51:57] just preach the message
[1:51:59] if you preach it the message will
[1:52:01] correct it and the church will move on
[1:52:03] because the message is not to bring
[1:52:06] people back to a preacher or a
[1:52:07] personality the message is to bring the
[1:52:10] people back to the word and the prophet
[1:52:13] said because the word corrects the error
[1:52:17] the word corrects the error the Bible
[1:52:21] said we are of God and he that knoweth
[1:52:23] God heareth us he that is not of God
[1:52:25] here is not us hereby know we the spirit
[1:52:27] of truth and the spirit of error said
[1:52:31] today there is a gross error it is that
[1:52:33] there are three Gods instead of one this
[1:52:35] Revelation is given the John by Jesus
[1:52:37] himself corrects the error it is not
[1:52:39] that there are three Gods but one God
[1:52:40] but three offices there is one God but
[1:52:43] three titles this Mighty Revelation is
[1:52:45] what the early church had and it must be
[1:52:48] restored in the last name you say what
[1:52:50] are you getting at I'm saying this
[1:52:52] Jesus knew he was the word
[1:52:55] he knew he was the word the product God
[1:52:58] said Jesus himself when he came he knew
[1:53:00] he was the word he was positive that
[1:53:03] when he was just 12 years old little boy
[1:53:04] we found him in the temple to make Mr
[1:53:06] priest his knowledge could surpass their
[1:53:08] traditions and when his own mother come
[1:53:10] to him and said a word that was wrong
[1:53:12] watch the word correct the error because
[1:53:15] the word always corrects the error
[1:53:19] anytime you see error just preach the
[1:53:22] word because the word will always
[1:53:24] correct the air and if the people are
[1:53:26] going to see that today the word
[1:53:27] corrects the air he said the whole thing
[1:53:29] is becoming air but God's word is what
[1:53:32] is right he said now watch the word that
[1:53:35] is prophesied for this day corrects the
[1:53:38] error of the day I love these quotes the
[1:53:40] word comes back and corrects that error
[1:53:43] by identifying itself the hour and the
[1:53:45] time of the hour I watched this when he
[1:53:47] was a 12 year old boy he wouldn't do
[1:53:49] that he was the word see he was the
[1:53:52] spoken word of the age so therefore the
[1:53:55] identified character if God was in
[1:53:57] Christ he corrected the error
[1:54:01] can I give you another one the word
[1:54:04] always corrects the error by identifying
[1:54:07] God among them
[1:54:08] can I give you another one but let's go
[1:54:11] back for just a few moments now and
[1:54:12] identify what Jesus was when he was on
[1:54:15] Earth and we'll find out what he was
[1:54:16] then what he's been to the other ages
[1:54:18] then it'll have to be the same thing in
[1:54:20] this age to make it right see why
[1:54:23] because we are the present-day Disciples
[1:54:26] of Christ now the Bible said You shall
[1:54:29] know the truth
[1:54:30] and the truth shall make you free
[1:54:33] remember ask the question he said what
[1:54:35] is the truth he says Thy word is truth
[1:54:39] he said you believe in the truth
[1:54:42] and truth will always speak for itself
[1:54:46] that's right you never have to strain
[1:54:49] truth
[1:54:52] you never have to strain truth truth
[1:54:56] will always be truth the truth will
[1:55:00] never make you popular but the truth
[1:55:02] will make you honest
[1:55:05] and we'd rather be honest
[1:55:08] than popular
[1:55:10] you say brother Andrew you're getting
[1:55:13] laid out there am I really
[1:55:15] the truth
[1:55:16] coming in the church
[1:55:18] will set the church free
[1:55:20] yeah
[1:55:21] the truth being spoke over your life
[1:55:24] will heal your body
[1:55:27] the message of the hour is the
[1:55:31] correcting why are you saying this
[1:55:32] because the spirit of God always comes
[1:55:36] to the word
[1:55:39] brother Andrew
[1:55:40] why are you why are you so emphasizing
[1:55:43] on this because there's a lot of trash
[1:55:45] in laodicea
[1:55:49] but it belongs in laodicea not in the
[1:55:51] bride
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:53] belongs in laodicea it don't belong in
[1:55:56] the bride therefore this bride must have
[1:55:59] a washing
[1:56:00] of the water
[1:56:02] by the word
[1:56:04] how many can say Lord Wash Me
[1:56:06] Wash Me
[1:56:08] Watch Me Lord you know we you know and I
[1:56:11] know I know I'm slowing down a lot right
[1:56:13] here we can get bad attitudes
[1:56:16] and we can shout dance and holler and
[1:56:18] scream run all over the building and got
[1:56:19] a bad attitude
[1:56:27] praying for power to move mountains and
[1:56:29] he said you can't even move your
[1:56:30] attitude
[1:56:32] yeah he said God will never give you
[1:56:34] power to move mountains if you can't
[1:56:35] move your attitude
[1:56:36] are you hearing me you say oh brother
[1:56:38] Andrew this ain't the message it is
[1:56:40] it's The Headstone it's the leadership
[1:56:43] it's the Direction coming upon the
[1:56:46] church for Rapture to lead her out of
[1:56:49] here
[1:56:49] how many can say Lord Wash Me
[1:56:52] wash me let our musicians come this
[1:56:53] morning Lord wash me he said so many
[1:56:56] people today are open their hearts the
[1:56:57] wrong thing and they get a spirit all
[1:56:59] right but many times it contradicts the
[1:57:02] word saying this the days of Miracles
[1:57:04] has passed there's no such a thing as
[1:57:06] this or that remember listen remember
[1:57:09] that's a devil under the disguisement of
[1:57:12] Christianity
[1:57:13] God help us when we get down here see
[1:57:16] there's an evil spirit in the
[1:57:17] disguisement of Christianity but it
[1:57:19] isn't the spirit of Christ because the
[1:57:22] spirit of Christ comes to the word every
[1:57:24] time he cannot deny his own word
[1:57:29] think about that
[1:57:31] he cannot deny his own word you know
[1:57:35] what this you know what this word is
[1:57:36] this word's like a detector
[1:57:38] you can try to hide stuff y'all y'all
[1:57:41] know they got these these things you go
[1:57:42] through the airports now and you go
[1:57:44] through there and drive you crazy I mean
[1:57:46] literally drive you crazy you gotta you
[1:57:48] gotta belt on BBB well it's about yeah
[1:57:52] but what they're doing is they're so
[1:57:54] built to pick up things that you can't
[1:57:56] hide nothing
[1:57:58] can't hide nothing
[1:58:00] try to hide it in your shoe and it's
[1:58:01] gonna go off try to hide it in your
[1:58:03] socket it's going to go off I didn't
[1:58:05] think that they or somebody was trying
[1:58:06] to hide some drugs and they're in their
[1:58:08] as they were traveling they had a needle
[1:58:10] in their arm and put a shirt over in a
[1:58:12] jacket and actually had it buried in
[1:58:13] their arm taped over and that thing
[1:58:15] still picked it up
[1:58:16] it's built to detect things you realize
[1:58:19] what this word is it's a detector
[1:58:22] it's built to detect the trash and
[1:58:24] unbelief and doubt the creeps into our
[1:58:26] lives now listen when that when that
[1:58:29] when that this when that beeper goes off
[1:58:30] big big you got one or two options
[1:58:34] you can behave yourself step aside let
[1:58:37] them search you get on your plane or
[1:58:39] throw a fit and go to jail
[1:58:43] you got two options
[1:58:45] got two options
[1:58:47] remember this school said one time he
[1:58:48] said he was going to Israel and he said
[1:58:50] he was going to there and they were
[1:58:51] checking his Bible checking his computer
[1:58:52] he finally said this is just ridiculous
[1:58:55] he said this is crazy she said you're
[1:58:56] the one getting on the plane not me
[1:59:00] he said I kind of stepped back thought
[1:59:02] well maybe I ought to get a little more
[1:59:03] security if it's me getting on she's not
[1:59:05] she could care less if the thing gets
[1:59:07] hijacked
[1:59:08] but in other words what I'm saying is
[1:59:10] this and I'm done
[1:59:11] the word of God being preached detects
[1:59:15] things in our life it exposes it
[1:59:20] I know that I've been preaching long
[1:59:21] enough to know when you got when you get
[1:59:22] into something and the church gets real
[1:59:24] quiet oh you're on the trail
[1:59:26] your brother Thomas you know what I'm
[1:59:28] talking about hit something and
[1:59:30] somebody's facial expression changes you
[1:59:31] know you near something you know what it
[1:59:33] is it's not the man Discerning brother
[1:59:36] about him the Messiah sign is not to be
[1:59:38] reimbursemented into being made of Pope
[1:59:39] Joe that was here to identify a prophet
[1:59:41] the word is the discerner so as the word
[1:59:45] is going forth it begins to detect the
[1:59:48] unbelief it begins to detect the trash
[1:59:50] and then all of a sudden that word
[1:59:51] begins to go b b b b b
[1:59:56] and you got one of two options
[1:59:58] you can say Lord I'm sorry
[2:00:00] forgive me I want to make it right I'm
[2:00:03] wrong your word is right
[2:00:06] or your other options blow up and get
[2:00:07] mad and go home don't come back Church
[2:00:12] somebody breathe in here or something
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:17] when the word exposes the devil I'm just
[2:00:20] going to go ahead and say you're
[2:00:21] automatically free
[2:00:25] see when that word exposes that devil
[2:00:28] and you recognize it and you start
[2:00:30] hearing that b b
[2:00:32] you don't have to make a decision do I
[2:00:34] Want to Be Free you're already free
[2:00:37] the decision you make is do I want to
[2:00:39] move on or get mad and go back
[2:00:42] y'all remember the story brother Brian
[2:00:43] says there in the in the meeting he's
[2:00:45] Discerning and he says you soldier boy
[2:00:47] you come here he said the devil's lying
[2:00:49] to you renounce that devil you're not
[2:00:51] going to commit suicide you're going to
[2:00:53] go home and be a real man we have that
[2:00:55] on tape for years and never understood
[2:00:56] it till brother mystical brought some
[2:00:58] light to it and told us that brother
[2:01:00] Brandon was actually with him in a
[2:01:01] restaurant and the young man and the
[2:01:04] doctor because the boy had been in the
[2:01:05] mental hospital the young man and the
[2:01:07] doctor brings the brings the boy down uh
[2:01:09] to the to the meeting then they come to
[2:01:11] the restaurant and the boys in the
[2:01:13] mental hospital because she's going to
[2:01:14] commit suicide he's lost his mind and
[2:01:17] brother man comes in and they walk in
[2:01:19] and the boy says can I have a moment
[2:01:21] with you and brother bisco said I
[2:01:22] watched him as brother
[2:01:24] random and the Soulja Boy walked down
[2:01:26] the sidewalk and as they're walking he
[2:01:28] said all of a sudden I saw something
[2:01:29] change he said that young boy began to
[2:01:31] take his fist and he began to pump it in
[2:01:33] the air he began to say I'm free I'm
[2:01:36] free I'm free said he turned around walk

[2:04:08] frees the church
[2:04:11] I remember I remember we had how I'm
[2:04:13] trying to quit but y'all still put a
[2:04:15] little bit I mean we had an attorney
[2:04:16] there in Kingsport Tennessee y'all I
[2:04:18] grew up here in the hills of East
[2:04:19] Tennessee and we had an attorney there I
[2:04:20] won't call his name but he was a he was
[2:04:22] a pretty famous guy you know he he had a
[2:04:24] reputation of getting people out of
[2:04:25] anything you know and he he had this one
[2:04:28] case it's a it's still a story told
[2:04:29] around town he had this one case and in
[2:04:32] this case he had he this guy was up for
[2:04:34] I think murder or something and they I
[2:04:35] mean they're gonna put him away for life
[2:04:36] you know so he even hired this this
[2:04:38] attorney this guy would do things that I
[2:04:40] would not even mention in a church let
[2:04:42] alone I mean I would mention he would do
[2:04:44] things in the courtroom to just get the
[2:04:45] judge's attention off of this and then
[2:04:47] the case you know so they had this guy
[2:04:49] in this real big case downtown and they
[2:04:51] had the court reporters the news
[2:04:53] reporters out front and the the day the
[2:04:56] verdict was coming in all these things

[2:04:59] all out there you know they're ready
[2:05:00] well this guy's fishing go away for life
[2:05:01] I mean if if this attorney don't do
[2:05:03] something he gone you know I mean for
[2:05:05] good so he goes in there and while he's
[2:05:07] in there they're all out there they
[2:05:08] wouldn't let the news reporters go
[2:05:10] inside the cape inside the core so all
[2:05:12] of a sudden and I won't even go tell you
[2:05:13] what this guy done this time to win this
[2:05:15] case but rather in the middle of it
[2:05:17] right before they went to decide on the
[2:05:19] verdict the attorney stands up that's
[2:05:21] something walks out comes back in sits
[2:05:23] down a few hours later they're out there
[2:05:25] front they said the verdict's in the
[2:05:27] verdict's in and all of a sudden all of
[2:05:30] a sudden the the doors and the court

[2:05:40] running I mean he literally running down
[2:05:42] the down Center streets jumping and
[2:05:44] screaming and so one news reporter she's
