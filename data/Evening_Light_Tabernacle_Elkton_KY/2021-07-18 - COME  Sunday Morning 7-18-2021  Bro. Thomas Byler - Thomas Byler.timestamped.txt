[0:42] so
[4:26] foreign
[5:22] you
[6:04] thank
[6:15] good morning brothers we'll just all
[6:18] stand this morning
[6:23] maybe brother brad will open us in
[6:32] prayer
[6:46] foreign
[7:00] and the children can be dismissed for
[7:02] sunday school and if we'll
[7:03] go to the psalms here
[7:07] psalms 143.
[7:25] psalms 143
[7:29] hear my prayer oh lord give ear to my
[7:31] supplications
[7:32] in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy
[7:34] righteousness
[7:43] for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he
[7:46] hath smitten my life down to the ground
[7:48] he hath made me to dwell in darkness as
[7:50] those that have been long dead
[7:59] i remember the days of old i meditate on
[8:01] all thy works a muse
[8:03] on the work of my hands
[8:14] hear me speedily oh lord my spirit
[8:16] faileth hide not thy face from me
[8:19] lest i be like unto them that go down
[8:20] into the pit
[8:33] deliver me o lord from mine enemies i
[8:36] flee unto thee to hide me
[8:47] quicken me o lord for thy name's sake
[8:50] for their righteousness sake bring my
[8:51] soul out of trouble
[8:53] and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies
[8:56] and destroy all them that afflict
[8:58] my soul for i am thy servant amen god
[9:01] bless you may be seated brother brian
[9:16] good morning brothers and sisters
[9:20] i can't read it that way if you would
[9:23] turn with me to the 44th song
[9:37] you know that second verse that's the
[9:40] previous psalm we read you kind of goes
[9:43] with what
[9:44] brother thomas was talking about on
[9:46] wednesday and
[9:47] the other ministers that have been
[9:49] coming through knowing yourself you
[9:51] can't
[9:52] justify yourself and when god looks at
[9:54] you he knows you can't justify
[9:56] yourself in anything it's only by god's
[9:59] grace
[10:00] through salvation through his son that
[10:02] any man or any woman or any child
[10:05] could ever be justified before god so
[10:07] it's nothing
[10:08] i do or you do it's what god does for
[10:11] us and uh i'll read the
[10:15] this 44th psalm here i was going through
[10:18] my notes
[10:20] out at the in my office and
[10:25] i think it was like in the middle 2007
[10:29] to that i was actually looking through
[10:31] my notes and i was
[10:32] i had that psalm book here and for a
[10:35] year or two i was going for all the
[10:36] different psalms
[10:38] you know i was going through my notes
[10:39] and somehow i had the 43rd psalm
[10:42] in my notes and i had the 45th psalm i
[10:45] didn't
[10:46] have this 44th but i was just thinking
[10:48] this morning
[10:50] uh this psalm actually speaks for the
[10:53] day that we're in right now
[10:55] and it's not a very long psalm as i read
[10:59] it
[11:00] and this is what uh this is what
[11:03] it has to say we heard with our ears oh
[11:06] god our fathers
[11:07] have told us what works thou didst in
[11:10] their days
[11:10] in the times of old so you all no
[11:13] different here this morning
[11:15] you have the message of the hour you
[11:17] have all the books from the time of
[11:19] christ
[11:19] until this day that we live in right now
[11:22] you have all the histories you have the
[11:24] foxes book of martyrs
[11:26] you have all the writings from the last
[11:28] two thousand plus
[11:29] years so this affects us just as much as
[11:32] it did to children of israel
[11:34] you have examples you have stories you
[11:37] have
[11:37] all the truth as that's been revealed
[11:41] that you can go back to and he goes on
[11:43] to say here
[11:45] how did this thou drive out the heathen
[11:47] with our hand and
[11:48] planets them that how thou didst afflict
[11:51] the people and cast them out
[11:53] for they got not the land in possession
[11:56] by their own sword needed their
[11:58] their own arm save them but by thy right
[12:01] hand and thy arm and the light of thy
[12:03] continents
[12:04] because thou had his favor onto them so
[12:06] the psalmist was saying here
[12:08] that it wasn't the strength of the
[12:10] israelis that conquered the land it was
[12:12] god through the israelis that conquered
[12:14] the land for him and it's the same way
[12:16] with everyone sitting here this morning
[12:18] you know you don't conquer any anything
[12:21] in yourself and and uh
[12:25] in the world we live in that's i was
[12:27] writing this down
[12:29] this morning there's always
[12:33] a negative and a positive in anything in
[12:35] life whatever you do there's always
[12:37] gonna in
[12:38] in relationships when you're dealing
[12:40] with people
[12:41] or in governments or in anything there's
[12:43] always going to be a positive
[12:45] and negative and i just wrote
[12:48] some examples you know the first example
[12:51] that the children of israel were given
[12:53] is positive and a negative you know they
[12:56] were in deuteronomy they were given that
[12:58] law there was a law a life
[13:00] and a law of death and you have to
[13:02] choose this morning which law you're
[13:04] going to follow
[13:04] whether you're going to follow the law
[13:06] of life or you're going to spurn that
[13:08] law
[13:09] and live under death every man woman and
[13:11] child has to make that decision this
[13:13] morning
[13:14] which law are you going to put first in
[13:16] your life and it comes into the day that
[13:18] we live and are you going to put god's
[13:19] word first
[13:20] or are you going to put what other
[13:22] people tell you first and another law
[13:25] you know it it we faces
[13:28] we have uh we have the new testament
[13:32] and it's a law to ourselves too it gives
[13:34] you
[13:35] principles to live by and principles not
[13:37] to live by
[13:38] and yet again this morning all of us
[13:40] have to make a choice
[13:42] on what principles we're going to live
[13:43] by you know i can't make them for you i
[13:46] can't make
[13:46] i can only make them for myself and
[13:48] you're gonna everyone sitting here this
[13:50] morning
[13:50] is either living under a negative light
[13:52] or living under a positive light
[13:55] that's your choice though this morning
[13:57] no one put you in that place you chose
[13:59] to be in that place yourself
[14:01] and uh there and then brother branham
[14:04] always talked about
[14:05] you know there's a false vine and a and
[14:07] a true vine there's
[14:09] twins there's an evil twin and there's a
[14:11] good twin and everyone
[14:12] you know you deal with people in life
[14:14] you know you you'll come across a good
[14:17] family
[14:19] that has had all kinds of good things in
[14:22] their life and that's that good family
[14:23] you'll get that one
[14:24] guy that you wonder where he came from
[14:27] that bad
[14:28] that bad apple in the bunch that's just
[14:31] the way life is
[14:32] and then also you know there's a true
[14:34] vine in the bat
[14:35] bad vine there's a false church and
[14:38] there's a real church you know
[14:40] and then and it's simply there's honest
[14:42] men and there's evil men i mean that's
[14:44] just the way
[14:45] life and i lost my place as i was
[14:47] talking here
[14:48] but uh it's the fourth verse thou art my
[14:51] king oh god command deliverance for
[14:53] jacob
[14:55] through thee will we push down our
[14:57] enemies and through thy name we will
[14:59] tread them under
[14:59] that rise up against us for i will put
[15:02] not trust in my bow neither my sword
[15:05] save me so we can't trust them our own
[15:07] strength you know i
[15:08] i say this a lot i'm one of them guys if
[15:11] i'm not careful
[15:12] i'll just trust in my own strength and
[15:14] my own abilities
[15:15] to get something done instead of just
[15:17] waiting on god to do it for me
[15:20] and i'll go on to saying seventh verse
[15:22] but thou has saved us from our enemies
[15:25] and thou has put them to shame that
[15:26] hated us and god we boast all day
[15:29] long and praise thy name for sailor now
[15:33] in any psalm or in any scriptures
[15:35] there's always
[15:36] a good and a bad there's a negative and
[15:38] a positive
[15:40] and he as we're going to start switching
[15:42] here to the negative side
[15:44] and he goes on to say in the night first
[15:46] but that was cast off and put
[15:48] us to shame goes not forth with our
[15:51] armies
[15:52] and i was thinking that's where we're at
[15:53] this morning and
[15:55] you know there's a very that picture
[15:57] back there i've said it before in
[15:59] in the age that we live in right if you
[16:01] look back on that
[16:02] circle there you don't see no light at
[16:04] all and that's where we're at the only
[16:06] light like i said a couple of weeks ago
[16:08] is the light that you reflect
[16:09] that god gives you to reflect in the
[16:11] world that we live this morning and
[16:12] that's the only light that they're going
[16:14] to see
[16:15] is your light as you reflect and get
[16:17] around other people they see what god's
[16:19] done for you
[16:20] and where you're at this morning and he
[16:21] goes on to say
[16:24] thou makes us to turn back from the
[16:26] enemy and they which had a spoil for
[16:28] themselves thou has given us
[16:30] like sheep appointed for meat and hath
[16:33] scattered us among the heathen
[16:35] you know when the church went through
[16:36] this and you go through the seventh
[16:38] church age book you go through the seven
[16:40] seals
[16:41] where brother brown talks about you know
[16:43] the church started good
[16:45] it had a place where it fell and then
[16:47] come back and now we're in a place where
[16:49] the church has fallen again
[16:50] if you're not in this word and for this
[16:53] hour
[16:54] out there there's no hope there's just
[16:56] blackness out there there's just
[16:57] darkness
[16:58] so to leave this what are you going to
[17:01] when you leave this
[17:02] what is out there to leave for there
[17:05] there's really nothing to leave for and
[17:07] he goes on to say
[17:10] uh i lost my place here it is thou has
[17:12] given us like the sheep appointed for
[17:14] meat
[17:14] and that scattered us among the heathen
[17:17] thou
[17:18] sell us thy people for not does not
[17:20] increase their wealth by their price
[17:22] thou makes us
[17:23] a reproach to our neighbors a scorn and
[17:26] an aversion to them that are around the
[17:27] battles
[17:29] thou makes us a byword among the heathen
[17:31] and a shaking of the head among the
[17:33] people
[17:33] well that's what the mainline church
[17:37] i mean the heathen they just laugh at
[17:38] the mainline church there's no power in
[17:40] those churches out there
[17:42] i mean they talk a good talk but they
[17:43] have nothing to back it up so he just
[17:45] make fun of him out there nowadays
[17:48] and he goes you go my confusion is
[17:50] continually before me the shame of my
[17:53] face hath covered me
[17:55] for the voice of him that reproaches and
[17:57] blessed femeth by the reason of the
[17:59] enemy and the avenger and
[18:00] that really i mean there's just blasting
[18:03] me all over the world nowadays but
[18:05] they unless they see the power of jesus
[18:07] christ in you there's
[18:09] it's nothing going to change people
[18:11] unless they see christ in you this
[18:12] morning and it goes on
[18:14] all this has come upon us yet we have
[18:16] not forgotten me neither have we dealt
[18:19] falsely in the covenant and it's
[18:20] switching here
[18:21] it's even in that in the days of israel
[18:24] there was always a remnant
[18:26] that worshipped the living god the way
[18:27] he wanted to be worse in the age that
[18:29] we're in this morning
[18:30] there's that remnant among us that knows
[18:33] the true
[18:34] god and is worshiping the true god the
[18:36] correct way
[18:38] and and he goes on to say our heart has
[18:40] not turned back
[18:41] neither of our steps declined from their
[18:43] way
[18:45] though thou has so broken us in places
[18:48] of dragons and covered us with shadow of
[18:50] death
[18:51] if we have forgotten the name of our god
[18:54] or stretched out our hands to a strange
[18:56] god
[18:57] you know and you know many ministers
[18:58] come in and talk about this you know
[19:01] you can make anything in your life god
[19:03] you can say you're a christian and
[19:04] worship something else if you're not
[19:06] careful
[19:06] so i mean it's real you can you know i
[19:10] have to be careful you can make your job
[19:11] your god you can make your entertainment
[19:13] your god you can make
[19:15] you can make anything of god that you
[19:17] put before christ every day that you'll
[19:19] choose to do this
[19:20] before you do that and he goes on to say
[19:23] we have forgotten the name of our god
[19:25] and stretch our hands to a strange god
[19:27] shall not god churches search this out
[19:30] for he knows the secrets of of the heart
[19:33] gave
[19:34] for thy sake are we killed all the day
[19:36] long and we are counted
[19:38] as sheep for the slaughter awake thou
[19:40] sleepers thou o lord arise stress out
[19:43] us not off forever wherefore hit us thou
[19:46] thy face and forget us to our
[19:48] inflictions and our
[19:50] oppressions for our souls is bowed down
[19:53] to the dust our body
[19:55] cleaveth upon the earth arise for our
[19:57] help
[19:58] and redeem us for thy mercy's sake it's

[26:36] and if there's anyone that's they
[26:38] printed that book for
[26:39] computer book for dummies that they did
[26:42] it for me and

[26:44] frustrated this morning
[26:46] just if it works it works
[26:50] if not i still know how to write
[26:53] i'll write it out we're good
[26:55] everything's okay
[26:57] so it did it again so then i hit a
[26:59] button and it started erasing everything
[27:02] so i just closed it out went over and i
[27:04] thought well
[27:05] lord you know
[27:08] and then some other things happened this
[27:10] morning i thought wow we're going to
[27:11] have an awesome service this morning
[27:13] because it's just been nothing but a
[27:15] battle
[27:16] how many knows when it's a battle when
[27:17] you're trying to go to church sometimes

[27:22] there be a battle that's the reason the
[27:24] devil doesn't want you to get
[27:26] what god has in store for you today amen
[27:29] so

[27:38] see him this morning

[27:45] singing as i go and
[27:48] pointing souls to calvary
[27:52] to that crimson floor where
[27:55] many arrows pitch my soul
[27:58] from without with
[28:02] but my lord leads me on and through him
[28:06] i must wait i know
[28:09] i wanna see him just look
[28:17] [Music]

[40:37] [Applause]
[40:57] sorry now
[41:12] he was patting that foot i thought maybe
[41:14] that'll help me stay in rhythm so i
[41:15] learned something this morning from
[41:17] brother jonathan this morning maybe i
[41:19] can stay in
[41:20] amen amen we're going to have a
[41:22] testimony this morning
[41:23] brother thomas said brother aaron had
[41:25] something in his heart so we'll ask him
[41:27] come this morning
[41:32] goodbye in the house of lord this
[41:33] morning so
[41:37] so before i start i would like to
[41:40] just go ahead and give the lord a round
[41:41] of applause because you know i've not
[41:43] been trying to get a truck for
[41:46] probably a month now and it's been a
[41:48] little bit but you know the lord stepped
[41:50] in and
[41:51] gave me i was supposed to get a ten
[41:52] thousand dollar loan from the bank but
[41:54] instead of ten thousand they gave me the
[41:56] full amount for the truck
[41:57] so i'm just gonna go ahead and give the
[41:58] lawyer a rental
[42:03] [Applause]
[42:06] so on my last testimony i said that i
[42:09] overcame
[42:10] a battle i've been going through which i
[42:12] didn't and
[42:13] so but this is a battle that i went
[42:16] through probably two to three years
[42:18] uh it's been pretty much war with it and
[42:21] you know i'm a little nervous this
[42:22] morning my legs shaking so i guess i'm a
[42:23] little nervous
[42:25] but uh it's been a war and
[42:29] i forgot i forgot my phone i was going
[42:31] to show you a video that
[42:33] it's a place that it led me to it's
[42:36] i used to have tick tock and this video
[42:41] it is a place that it led me to
[42:45] but it's on tech talk i don't know if i
[42:47] can find it let me see if i can find it
[42:57] so it's got music playing in the
[42:58] background but i guess just ignore that
[43:00] part
[43:00] but this is a place that it led me to
[43:04] i need prayers i don't know if i'm
[43:08] i'm good enough to make it in the
[43:09] rapture not i've done so many things
[43:12] wrong
[43:12] you know i just won't let y'all know
[43:14] that
[43:16] no i mean i haven't always been the best
[43:18] of a christian
[43:20] i know i've been acting like a christian
[43:24] haven't been
[43:26] i just want to ask that maybe
[43:30] like this video to let me know that
[43:32] you're listening
[43:34] um and pray for me
[43:38] probably become the
[43:46] pray that i can be willing more willing
[43:49] to be a christian and more
[43:52] proud that i can be more willing to let
[43:53] go of the things that
[43:55] that i have not been able to let go
[43:57] before
[44:01] me it means a lot
[44:04] so that was one of the videos that i
[44:07] made
[44:08] i started in that video because you know
[44:10] i felt like i was so low and
[44:12] felt like i was so uh not a christian
[44:16] that it just made me feel so bad
[44:18] and this led me to places to where i
[44:19] felt like i was going to leave the
[44:21] message and if it wasn't for the grace
[44:23] of god i would have
[44:25] but you know today you know i went to
[44:26] byc i think it was
[44:28] not this week last week but
[44:32] last week and i think i pre one of the
[44:35] preachers so we had brother uh
[44:38] which is andrew glover preaching for us
[44:39] he said you know when you give a
[44:41] testimony it uh breaks the date as
[44:43] devil's back so
[44:44] i'm breaking his back this morning but
[44:45] oh well so i don't really care if he
[44:47] likes it or not i'm gonna give a
[44:48] testimony whether he likes it or not
[44:50] so when i went to byc and now
[44:54] i'm free i'm a free man this morning
[44:57] even though i'm unworthy and undeserving
[44:59] i know that i've done things but i'm
[45:00] free this morning
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:13] let's stand well thank god i am
[45:16] free free free
[45:20] from this world of sin
[45:24] for i've been washed in the blood of

[45:49] bring me out show me the way
[45:55] like a bird out of prison

[46:43] [Music]
[46:56] [Applause]
[46:56] [Music]
[47:04] [Music]
[47:07] he would bring me
[47:10] [Music]
[47:17] amen are you happy you're free this
[47:20] morning
[47:21] amen appreciate with aaron's
[47:24] testimony and you know it's not just his
[47:27] but it's all of us
[47:29] no matter how long you've been serving
[47:30] the lord it's still your heart's desire
[47:32] to grow closer to him
[47:33] and to be better and you know
[47:36] i always i was chuckling the other day
[47:40] and
[47:41] i thought you know if brother branham's
[47:44] worst enemy was him
[47:46] wow what about me
[47:50] i've really got problems brother joe big
[47:52] problems
[47:53] think lord a prophet would stand there
[47:56] and say
[47:57] when he gets up in the morning his worst
[47:59] enemy is himself
[48:01] lord help me i need help today amen i
[48:04] don't know about you but i do
[48:07] and i know i know one thing
[48:11] we live in a very fast-moving world
[48:13] everything's in a hurry
[48:15] and i have found out that every time i
[48:19] let the enemy
[48:20] convince me that i don't have time to
[48:22] pray or time to read
[48:24] guess what i had plenty of time because
[48:28] i'm gonna have troubles but they just
[48:30] multiply
[48:32] and i think all you you just
[48:35] had to be in a hurry you had to be here
[48:37] no
[48:38] we have to be here in god's presence
[48:42] that way no matter what comes our way

[51:48] let's bow our heads this morning lord
[51:50] jesus we come before you this morning
[51:52] lord
[51:52] with the one purpose in our heart father
[51:55] and that is to glorify you lord
[51:57] to lift your name up to brag about you
[51:59] lord and
[52:00] father to just honor you and respect you
[52:03] lord jesus for the
[52:05] respect and honor that's due to your
[52:07] name we ask god that
[52:09] you once again bless our gathering
[52:11] together in your name we know father
[52:13] that
[52:13] we believe with all of our heart
[52:15] wherever two or three are gathered in
[52:17] your name there you will be in our midst
[52:19] and we thank you lord jesus so much for
[52:21] that father for if we didn't have you we
[52:23] would be of all men most miserable
[52:25] and lord we ask god that you'll just
[52:26] take the meditation of our heart and
[52:28] that which we feel you've laid upon our
[52:29] heart to speak on
[52:30] and say what you once said father help
[52:32] me just to get out of the way and help
[52:34] me not to say anything that would be
[52:36] in myself but just what the spirit would
[52:38] say father
[52:39] bless every effort of every person here
[52:41] this morning god
[52:42] lord jesus of coming into your house
[52:44] lord prepare their hearts their prayers
[52:46] and
[52:47] lord their preparation father to hear
[52:49] from you lord and now god as we
[52:51] change the order of service from singing
[52:53] and so forth to your word
[52:55] we ask god that you would just bless us
[52:57] lord with what you want to say
[52:59] in jesus name amen and amen
[53:02] so just trying to follow the leading of
[53:04] the spirit trying to listen to his voice
[53:07] amen um uh we want to go
[53:10] this morning amen and let's turn our
[53:13] bibles
[53:15] i think we'll go to luke if you will
[53:19] luke 14.
[53:35] and this is certainly something that
[53:37] i've preached on
[53:39] before but perhaps we can just get a
[53:42] little bit
[53:43] further or a little bit more
[53:44] enlightenment from it
[53:46] i mean that's usually what i appreciate
[53:49] about the lord it's not about whether
[53:51] you know something it's about whether
[53:52] the lord
[53:53] can take you a little bit deeper in what
[53:55] you have already amen
[53:57] so let's go to luke 14 and we'll begin
[53:59] with verse 16.
[54:01] then said he unto him
[54:06] a certain man made a great supper and
[54:08] bade many
[54:10] and sent his servant at supper time to
[54:12] say to them
[54:13] that were bidden come all for all things
[54:16] are ready now and my title this morning
[54:19] is just going to be
[54:20] that word come amen that all right
[54:24] come for all things are ready now
[54:27] and they all with one consent began to
[54:30] make
[54:30] excuse the first said unto him i've
[54:33] bought a piece of ground
[54:34] and i must needs go and see it i pray
[54:37] thee
[54:38] have me excused and another said i have
[54:41] bought five yoke of oxen and i
[54:43] go to prove them i pray thee have me
[54:45] excuse
[54:46] and another said i have married a wife
[54:48] and therefore i cannot come
[54:49] so that servant came and showed his lord
[54:51] these things
[54:52] then the master of the house being angry
[54:55] said to his servants go out quickly into
[54:57] the streets
[54:58] and lanes of the city and bring in
[55:01] thither the poor
[55:02] the mane the halt and the blind and the
[55:06] servants said lord it is done as thou
[55:08] has commanded and yet there is room
[55:11] and the lord said to the servant go
[55:15] into the highways and to the hedges and
[55:17] compel them
[55:18] to come in that my house may be filled
[55:21] for i say unto you that none of those
[55:22] men which were bitten shall taste
[55:24] of my supper amen may god of his
[55:26] blessings to reading your word
[55:28] you can be seen seated
[55:41] i want to also turn to john i'm going to
[55:43] go and read this over here in john
[55:47] saint john 19
[55:51] and verse 30.
[55:54] when jesus therefore had received the
[55:57] vinegar
[55:59] he said it is finished
[56:02] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[56:05] ghost
[56:06] this is the only book out of the four
[56:09] books
[56:10] where he's where it says that he said
[56:12] this
[56:13] all the others were pretty much my god
[56:16] without forsaking me or it is
[56:18] different things that they said but this
[56:20] is the only place where he said
[56:22] it is finished and he bowed his head and
[56:25] he gave up the ghost here it says that
[56:27] it was the very
[56:28] last words jesus said
[56:32] before dying amen
[56:36] and it might seem kind of simple to us
[56:38] but i believe it had a great bearing
[56:41] don't you i think it had to mean a lot
[56:44] for him to say it's finished
[56:48] what's finished and that right
[56:51] we would ask ourselves well what is
[56:53] finished
[56:55] what's finished amen
[57:11] in the old testament we know that
[57:13] humanity and man as a whole whether it
[57:15] was david or whether it's solomon or
[57:17] whoever it was
[57:18] how many knows they were born with a
[57:20] natural sinful nature
[57:22] right and there was never no way to
[57:25] escape
[57:26] that never any way to get away from that
[57:29] right man was so to speak condemned
[57:32] isn't that right
[57:33] uh they were without hope in the world
[57:37] there was no way for them to get back to
[57:39] god you know
[57:40] and uh in order after adam finley in
[57:44] order for man to actually ever be united
[57:47] with god again it was going to have to
[57:49] be up to god to make a way
[57:52] for man to come back into relationship
[57:54] with him again
[57:55] isn't that right so there was a great
[57:57] responsibility
[57:58] up to this point there was a
[58:00] responsibility that god had
[58:03] of making a way for us now right
[58:07] he was going to make a way now uh we
[58:09] know that through the preaching of the
[58:11] gospel perhaps we'll detail some things
[58:13] this morning but
[58:14] it doesn't matter whether it was calvin
[58:16] knox mooney it doesn't matter who
[58:18] it is and our redemption
[58:22] and our way back and everything goes
[58:25] and it points back to what
[58:28] the cross right at the cross at the
[58:32] cross it's all about
[58:33] that cross it was about what happened on
[58:36] the cross
[58:38] because without that happening nothing
[58:40] was ever going to be
[58:41] possible for any of us
[58:42] [Music]
[58:45] it's just not going to be happening you
[58:47] know but here something was happening
[58:49] and jesus
[58:50] of course we know that he struggled he
[58:52] labored and so forth
[58:53] amen and he took uh upon his our sin
[58:56] upon him
[58:57] and he went through the battle the
[58:59] greatest battle he ever went through in
[59:01] the garden of gethsemane
[59:02] of whether he was going to go through
[59:04] with this or not and if it be possible
[59:06] let this cup pass from me and
[59:08] and so when you think about uh the king
[59:11] of glory coming into humanity coming and
[59:14] becoming a man
[59:15] amen and and you know you just find that
[59:18] you know when when you have a rich
[59:19] person
[59:21] when you have a rich person they don't
[59:23] tolerate very much
[59:26] is that right because they think of
[59:28] themselves way too highly
[59:29] to put up with much of your mess
[59:32] they'll take you to court i don't know
[59:34] what all they'll do but they tend not to
[59:36] put up with too much all right because
[59:39] they
[59:40] think they're a somebody but when we
[59:43] think about almighty god the king of
[59:45] glory becoming humanity
[59:47] amen and getting spit upon in that rock
[59:50] getting false accused
[59:52] getting his beard plucked out getting
[59:54] mocked getting scorched
[59:55] all of these things that he did right
[59:59] when you think about what he did for you
[1:00:01] and for me amen
[1:00:02] that's the thing that he would be able
[1:00:04] to do is be the very king of all glory
[1:00:08] could humble himself to calvary
[1:00:11] and to death
[1:00:15] and we'll never know we'll never know
[1:00:18] you'll never know
[1:00:20] outside of somehow god divinely
[1:00:24] when we perhaps go over there allow you
[1:00:26] to see i don't know that he ever will
[1:00:28] this is total presumption
[1:00:30] pre-ops to let you know what kind of
[1:00:32] suffering that he suffered
[1:00:35] how bad he suffered as a man
[1:00:41] amen because i think brother he taught
[1:00:43] that uh
[1:00:44] you know that even signs from what i
[1:00:46] understand that when you suffer so much
[1:00:48] your water separates from your blood
[1:00:51] your blood and water separate amen i
[1:00:53] don't understand all of that that had to
[1:00:55] be some severe
[1:00:57] excruciating suffering that he did
[1:01:00] we know it was disappointment beyond
[1:01:03] comprehension
[1:01:05] he came to his own his own received him
[1:01:07] not not only did they not receive him
[1:01:09] not only those who he had
[1:01:10] chosen so forth and not we understand
[1:01:13] that his own children are the one that
[1:01:16] crucified him
[1:01:18] i don't know about how you would feel of
[1:01:19] you as a dad and your own children
[1:01:21] to crucify you you know we can't like i
[1:01:25] said we can't comprehend
[1:01:26] perhaps the suffering that he went
[1:01:28] through but he suffered and he had to go
[1:01:31] through a big battle a great battle for
[1:01:34] you and i
[1:01:37] amen and so
[1:01:42] when we think about that the king of
[1:01:44] glory coming down
[1:01:46] becoming man king of kings
[1:01:50] humbling himself to the cross
[1:01:54] when he could have spoken to many
[1:01:56] legions of angels
[1:01:59] and changed the whole thing
[1:02:02] amen but he went through great battles
[1:02:06] he did many things and taught us and so
[1:02:08] forth but there
[1:02:09] the very end their last words that come
[1:02:12] out of his mouth
[1:02:14] were that it
[1:02:17] was finished
[1:02:20] it's done
[1:02:24] praise be to god all right it's done
[1:02:27] what's done
[1:02:28] the price is paid the work
[1:02:32] for god is finished his
[1:02:35] part is accomplished
[1:02:42] no doubt jesus knew what this meant
[1:02:46] he knew what it meant it meant
[1:02:50] that we're going to be able to have a
[1:02:51] service like this 2
[1:02:53] 000 years later us way here at the end
[1:02:56] of laodicea are still going to
[1:02:58] love the lord god more than anything
[1:03:00] else in the world
[1:03:02] amen it meant so much
[1:03:07] that it is finished
[1:03:11] it just comes to mind
[1:03:16] compare it is finished to verse 17 of
[1:03:20] luke 14 where it says
[1:03:22] and he sent his servant at supper time
[1:03:24] to say unto them
[1:03:26] that were red that were bitten come
[1:03:29] for all things are now
[1:03:33] ready it's finished
[1:03:38] and it's ready
[1:03:42] hallelujah so the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:46] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:03:49] man that made a supper
[1:03:52] and the cry went out whosoever will
[1:03:57] let him come
[1:04:00] is that right
[1:04:05] you know and the thing of it is here
[1:04:09] i want to just rephrase it
[1:04:14] whosoever wants to
[1:04:21] whosoever whoever wants to
[1:04:27] let him come
[1:04:31] i like that god opens his arm
[1:04:35] says look the work's done now anybody
[1:04:38] that wants to
[1:04:39] come on
[1:04:42] come on
[1:04:47] compare that with revelations
[1:04:52] 22. and 17 says
[1:04:55] the spirit and the bride
[1:04:59] say
[1:05:02] come
[1:05:05] let him to hear us say
[1:05:08] and let him that is the thirst come
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:19] brother brennan makes a statement he
[1:05:20] says you know if jesus was standing
[1:05:22] tonight
[1:05:23] here in my suit that he gave me
[1:05:27] amen he couldn't heal you
[1:05:32] scripturally speaking he couldn't heal
[1:05:34] you
[1:05:36] why because he's already done it
[1:05:39] you might say why he says he
[1:05:42] would tell you i did it at calvary
[1:05:48] hallelujah you say well he could heal me
[1:05:50] no he could not
[1:05:52] unless you believed it
[1:05:56] for many works he could not do in his
[1:05:59] hometown because
[1:06:00] of their unbelief
[1:06:04] so there are things that god cannot
[1:06:07] do why because it's hinged upon his law
[1:06:12] and upon his word already that you have
[1:06:15] to accept it
[1:06:16] just the other day i wanted to pull it
[1:06:18] up didn't have time to but brother man
[1:06:19] talks about he says you can come to the
[1:06:21] altar
[1:06:22] and you can repent of your sin and you
[1:06:24] can call upon god till you're 90 years
[1:06:27] old
[1:06:28] and you'll never get nowhere
[1:06:33] unless you accept
[1:06:37] what he done amen
[1:06:46] you have to accept what he already did
[1:06:50] that's what jesus said basically in my
[1:06:53] words
[1:06:54] my part is finished
[1:06:58] this part is finished
[1:07:01] he has supplied what we have need of
[1:07:05] he has made the supper
[1:07:12] boy there are a lot of illustrations we
[1:07:14] can pull from this
[1:07:15] for one thing is people don't want to
[1:07:18] come
[1:07:22] you know what he was having trouble with
[1:07:25] all of the good folks all the pharisees
[1:07:27] all the scribes all of those people
[1:07:29] he invited them first first he went to
[1:07:31] the house of israel
[1:07:32] and tried to get them to come but they
[1:07:34] would not they were too busy with their
[1:07:36] churches
[1:07:37] they were too busy with their doctrine
[1:07:39] they were too busy with their
[1:07:41] uh creeds of man and everything else
[1:07:46] and i wanted to say this because i want
[1:07:48] to say it later but i'm going to say it
[1:07:49] now
[1:07:50] on the day of judgment all people will
[1:07:53] have
[1:07:55] is excuses
[1:07:58] they'll only have an excuse
[1:08:01] that's all they'll have
[1:08:05] why because he supplied everything so
[1:08:08] they can't say it wasn't there
[1:08:10] huh it was there
[1:08:14] amen and all they can offer well and
[1:08:16] it'll be an excuse
[1:08:19] amen so you think about that
[1:08:23] it'll be just an excuse
[1:08:27] so the first his children his friends
[1:08:29] and relatives first he invited them
[1:08:31] they could not come they had an excuse
[1:08:33] and then the second he says men go out
[1:08:35] there
[1:08:36] in the highways in the streets and
[1:08:38] compel people to come on
[1:08:44] compel them to come in compel them to
[1:08:47] come to me
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:54] i'm gonna read you over there's one more
[1:08:57] time that
[1:08:58] jesus says it's finished he called it
[1:09:02] it is done revelation 16
[1:09:07] and verse 15 it says be called as a
[1:09:09] thief
[1:09:10] blessed is he that watches and keepeth
[1:09:12] his garments least he walked naked
[1:09:14] and they see his shame and he gathered
[1:09:16] them together into a place called
[1:09:18] the hebrew tongue armageddon and the
[1:09:20] seventh angel paul
[1:09:21] poured out his vial upon the air and
[1:09:24] there were great voices out of the
[1:09:26] temple and out of heaven
[1:09:28] and from the throne saying it is
[1:09:32] not
[1:09:35] amen it's not the only time that god's
[1:09:37] going to say it
[1:09:38] is done
[1:09:42] i like that it's finished
[1:09:45] it's over
[1:09:49] listen to this
[1:09:52] and there were voices and thunderings
[1:09:54] and lightnings and there was a great
[1:09:55] earthquake such as was not since man
[1:09:58] were upon the earth
[1:09:59] so mighty and earthquake and so great
[1:10:02] and the great city was divided into
[1:10:03] three parts
[1:10:04] and the cities plural i guess it's
[1:10:08] called more than one
[1:10:10] and the cities of the nations
[1:10:13] fell folks this little condo
[1:10:17] apartment place falling in florida is
[1:10:20] not going to be nothing compared to the
[1:10:22] cities that are going to fall all of
[1:10:25] those big scrap scrapers are coming down
[1:10:30] yeah all the glory of
[1:10:33] man all those beautiful cities
[1:10:37] is all going to be shaken all going to
[1:10:41] die like rats
[1:10:43] why because they didn't come
[1:10:46] they refused to come
[1:10:51] can i make another statement this
[1:10:52] morning
[1:10:54] you are this is really the subject this
[1:10:57] morning
[1:10:58] is to find out what condition we're in
[1:11:01] huh don't you think it's good for us to
[1:11:03] ask ourselves what condition
[1:11:05] are you in a doctor on
[1:11:09] looking at anybody to find out what your
[1:11:11] condition is
[1:11:12] i believe the holy spirit's doing that
[1:11:14] this morning what is your condition
[1:11:19] now i want to make this statement that
[1:11:20] whatever condition you're in
[1:11:24] is the condition that you want to be

[1:11:44] lady
[1:11:45] i will give you rest so if you're in a
[1:11:48] condition of no rest it's because
[1:11:50] you want to be
[1:11:54] amen pretty strong but it's the truth
[1:11:58] in other words it's a place where you
[1:12:00] can't blame god
[1:12:02] because he did his part up to it is
[1:12:04] finished
[1:12:05] he had a responsibility it was our god
[1:12:09] but now it's not on god anymore why
[1:12:13] because he finished it he got this up
[1:12:15] already
[1:12:15] he made a way now it's on us
[1:12:19] it's on humanity
[1:12:28] praise be to god amen
[1:12:32] there's a whole lot there for all of us
[1:12:37] is that right don't blame me
[1:12:42] i'm not jesus amen
[1:12:45] you can't come and say brother bible
[1:12:46] heal me of this help me no you got to
[1:12:48] get on your knees and you got to ask
[1:12:49] jesus
[1:12:50] to help you well it's not your church

[1:12:57] it's not your wife it's not your husband
[1:13:01] no it ain't nobody's fault don't blame
[1:13:04] nobody but
[1:13:07] yourself you're your biggest enemy
[1:13:12] it's your relationship with god not you

[1:13:16] your brothers or your sisters or your
[1:13:17] preachers
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:23] so he turned the corner he was turning a
[1:13:26] corner
[1:13:28] amen now jesus was going to
[1:13:32] come into a new place into a place where
[1:13:35] he begins to say
[1:13:36] blessed are they that want
[1:13:41] to come blessed are they that do hunger
[1:13:46] and thirst am i right
[1:13:50] after righteousness for thee
[1:13:55] that's awful quiet they shall
[1:13:58] be filled now
[1:14:01] you're at the place that you can't get
[1:14:03] filled
[1:14:06] brother mother i'm just about a quarter
[1:14:08] field i got an
[1:14:10] eighth of a tank i better get to the gas
[1:14:12] station
[1:14:14] huh
[1:14:20] can i say something brother tommy you
[1:14:22] know if you've only got an eighth of a
[1:14:24] gas tank
[1:14:25] only eight you're eight full you know
[1:14:28] what that means
[1:14:30] you're full of hot air more than you are
[1:14:32] gas
[1:14:36] the rest of your tank is filled with air
[1:14:39] emptiness are you with me
[1:14:43] that's right that you're more empty than

[1:15:09] says you're going to be full of
[1:15:10] something
[1:15:12] you're going to be filled with something
[1:15:14] and if the gas goes out

[1:15:36] that
[1:15:37] god himself told brother ben put these
[1:15:40] messages on tape

[1:15:46] because people down the road are going
[1:15:49] to need it
[1:15:51] so that when brother thomas comes along
[1:15:53] brother brad comes along or some other
[1:15:55] preacher comes along
[1:15:57] you'll know whether they're telling the
[1:15:58] truth or not
[1:16:02] you'll have food to eat and what did he
[1:16:05] see he saw cabbage and lettuce and
[1:16:07] tomato
[1:16:10] oh ribeye steak i don't care if it's a
[1:16:12] team of
[1:16:13] all kinds of good meat all kinds of good
[1:16:18] food
[1:16:21] i'll tell you church evening light
[1:16:23] tabernacle we're in bad shape if every
[1:16:25] time a preacher comes by he's got to
[1:16:26] come and preach you to repent and
[1:16:28] get filled with the holy ghost is that
[1:16:31] the state you're in
[1:16:34] empty places place that you always gotta
[1:16:36] get right
[1:16:37] whatever happened walk with god
[1:16:41] whatever happened with the daily walking
[1:16:44] with thee
[1:16:48] i know we got us we got little things
[1:16:50] you know but i'm talking about i'm not
[1:16:51] those
[1:16:52] little things that you do you make that
[1:16:54] right the second you do it
[1:16:56] isn't that right oh my
[1:17:01] i don't want us brandon we talked about
[1:17:03] he said you know
[1:17:04] i don't see nothing hindering the coming
[1:17:06] of the lord outside of the readiness of
[1:17:08] the bride
[1:17:09] well guess how many guess what we
[1:17:11] somebody got to be getting ready we're
[1:17:12] pretty late here down the road
[1:17:16] how many this morning will believe that
[1:17:19] you are the one that is going to be
[1:17:21] ready
[1:17:22] he was talking about you you talking
[1:17:26] about me
[1:17:26] being ready
[1:17:33] all right so let's think about this he
[1:17:35] begin to say things like blessed are
[1:17:37] they that hunger and thirst after
[1:17:40] righteousness
[1:17:41] for they shall be filled
[1:17:45] oh my now it's on
[1:17:48] us now it's on humanity and aren't you
[1:17:51] glad god
[1:17:52] put something down in there to first
[1:17:56] with
[1:17:59] if you're not happy when you get away
[1:18:01] from the lord and all you get miserable
[1:18:03] you ought to dance a jig
[1:18:06] why because there's something in there
[1:18:07] telling you you ain't right you need to
[1:18:09] get right
[1:18:11] the rest are happy not being right
[1:18:14] they don't ever want to be right
[1:18:22] so this morning if you're not filled
[1:18:25] with peace that
[1:18:26] passes understanding it's not god's
[1:18:29] fault

[1:22:30] at the table we are blessed because of
[1:22:34] what god has made
[1:22:36] available at the table and there ain't a
[1:22:40] thing that he has not made available to
[1:22:42] us
[1:22:42] he fixed the full course meal for us
[1:22:46] there's no no way that we have to live
[1:22:49] below
[1:22:50] our privileges as a christian i don't
[1:22:53] care
[1:22:53] if you're paul and you ain't got but a
[1:22:55] coat to wear and you're in the inner
[1:22:57] prison somewhere on a cold dark stormy
[1:22:59] night
[1:23:00] amen as long as you've got god you have
[1:23:02] got a prison buster
[1:23:03] and then those those walls of shake
[1:23:06] god get you out of there
[1:23:08] you're blessed
[1:23:16] joy unspeakable joy unspeakable and full
[1:23:20] of glory
[1:23:27] most of us got joy not speakable
[1:23:43] joy what's joy is that some kind of a
[1:23:46] dish liquid or something
[1:23:54] but it says that joy unspeakable and
[1:23:57] full of glory
[1:23:59] not half full but paul
[1:24:06] it's there for us just stay seated now
[1:24:09] don't get too happy about this but it's
[1:24:11] there for you
[1:24:13] it's right here you can have it right
[1:24:28] now
[1:24:33] from what i understand jesus is sitting
[1:24:36] on the throne on his intercessory box
[1:24:40] he's interceding for everybody the
[1:24:42] chinese on the other side of the world
[1:24:44] the
[1:24:45] russians and it doesn't matter who he's
[1:24:47] on the intercessor box
[1:24:48] you need something i'm here for you but
[1:24:52] you can have joy on spiegel every one of
[1:24:54] these things are made accessible
[1:24:56] but one of these ways when he gets up
[1:25:00] when he leaves that box
[1:25:05] it's done
[1:25:09] people will come to the altar or they'll
[1:25:11] come to church on sunday the preacher
[1:25:13] will preach
[1:25:15] he'll preach that they're still there
[1:25:18] they'll come to the altar but they won't
[1:25:21] get a thing
[1:25:23] they will not get a thing
[1:25:31] huh wouldn't be a terrible place to be
[1:25:35] amen even as a sinner you cry come up
[1:25:37] here and you pray and you don't get it
[1:25:39] isn't that terrible
[1:25:41] a terrible feeling like you didn't get a
[1:25:43] thing
[1:25:46] it'll be terrible but then no matter how
[1:25:48] much they try
[1:25:49] it won't be available anymore can we say
[1:25:54] he'll say supper is now being ended
[1:25:58] this summer is over
[1:26:03] and he'll say who came let's see who is
[1:26:04] who come
[1:26:08] other thing i draw from this parable is
[1:26:10] that there's always room
[1:26:14] there's still and yet he said there's
[1:26:17] room
[1:26:19] get people to come in i want my place
[1:26:22] full
[1:26:25] that got me into thinking about the
[1:26:26] parish i wonder how many peop how many
[1:26:29] million christians are going to be in
[1:26:30] heaven
[1:26:31] how many is going to be there
[1:26:36] you don't know do you that's a wise ques
[1:26:39] i mean that's written
[1:26:41] because nobody knows but it'll be a
[1:26:44] hundred
[1:26:44] 200 300 million will it be a billion
[1:26:48] i don't know but god says there's still
[1:26:52] plenty of room
[1:26:56] and i'll tell you this right now i don't
[1:26:58] know about you but i want to be one
[1:27:00] let me be one of them let you be another
[1:27:02] one
[1:27:04] there's still more room
[1:27:07] but in this case with the supper table
[1:27:10] amen there's still
[1:27:11] more aren't you glad that you don't have
[1:27:13] to do like you did with the
[1:27:15] ten brothers and ten sisters and quickly
[1:27:17] grab for that piece of meat loaf
[1:27:20] quickly grab for that last dish of
[1:27:21] mashed potatoes because it's just about
[1:27:23] no
[1:27:27] huh you ain't got to do that at god's
[1:27:30] table
[1:27:31] it's always full it's all you want
[1:27:36] hallelujah
[1:27:42] comes to mind i shouldn't remember the
[1:27:44] scripture as much as i quoted where he
[1:27:46] says
[1:27:47] come unto me all ye that thirst come to
[1:27:50] me and buy a food and so forth
[1:27:52] and drink and let your soul enlighten
[1:27:55] itself
[1:27:56] in yeah we know the word well don't we
[1:28:02] fatness let your soul delight itself in
[1:28:05] fatness
[1:28:10] we need more fat people around here
[1:28:12] brother farage
[1:28:17] hey we're on the scriptural side of
[1:28:18] things spiritually right
[1:28:21] brother don't put that us on us so
[1:28:23] natural we're working hard to get rid of
[1:28:24] some of that
[1:28:26] that's right fatness
[1:28:29] amen let your soul delight itself
[1:28:33] come no money
[1:28:36] no price just come and eat it
[1:28:40] amen aren't you glad that we're living
[1:28:44] in that
[1:28:45] era of grace
[1:28:48] that time of grace
[1:28:54] amen the service this morning
[1:28:58] is good as what you want it to be
[1:28:59] [Applause]
[1:29:03] the preacher is as good as you want him
[1:29:05] to be
[1:29:07] just depends on how hungry you really
[1:29:09] are
[1:29:15] there may be people here this morning
[1:29:16] say brother i really gots a lot
[1:29:19] of that was so good somebody else might
[1:29:21] go say well it was just brother balor
[1:29:26] preaching to people happy again
[1:29:29] huh well i'll tell you what
[1:29:34] you can't give what you ain't got
[1:29:38] so if i'm a little happy and you get a
[1:29:39] little that's all right isn't it
[1:29:43] because we got a lot to be happy about
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:47] a quote comes to my brain right now is
[1:29:49] that okay
[1:29:51] what did brother branham say about
[1:29:52] happiness
[1:29:58] we ought to be there let's give the lord
[1:30:01] a hand
[1:30:02] thank you jesus we ought to be the
[1:30:05] happiest
[1:30:06] people in the universe in the world the
[1:30:10] happiest people
[1:30:14] why because of what happened on calvary
[1:30:17] amen i'm glad for what happened on
[1:30:19] calvary
[1:30:20] i'm glad oh my don't get me going
[1:30:26] this is better than a big old horse just
[1:30:28] slobber on that alfalfa
[1:30:30] i'm about to spit everywhere
[1:30:36] more i think about it why just think
[1:30:38] about it i mean if you want to change
[1:30:40] your life
[1:30:42] just start thinking on the right things
[1:30:47] what i say wednesday show me what you
[1:30:49] think about it all the time and i'll
[1:30:50] show you who you are
[1:30:52] as a man thinks in his heart so easy
[1:30:56] start thinking on the right thing think
[1:30:58] on god
[1:31:02] just a little revelation on this think
[1:31:04] about this talking about
[1:31:05] when we eat something how many knows
[1:31:07] when you eat them it becomes a part of
[1:31:09] your dna
[1:31:11] how do we eat spiritually we eat
[1:31:13] spiritually through our eyes
[1:31:16] and through our ears blessed is he that
[1:31:19] heareth
[1:31:20] blessed are your eyes if you can see
[1:31:22] blessed he that readeth
[1:31:24] in that right you read it goes into your
[1:31:27] through your eyes
[1:31:28] and then the things that you hear it
[1:31:29] goes into your and so guess what that's
[1:31:31] why
[1:31:32] we read our bible not right we listen to
[1:31:36] we think about
[1:31:36] hear the word of god
[1:31:40] and jesus said unless you eat my flesh
[1:31:43] and drink
[1:31:44] my blood you have no life in you
[1:31:47] brother baptized the end of his ministry
[1:31:49] said he says you're not eating on a man
[1:31:52] but you're feeding on the unfailing
[1:31:55] body word of jesus christ
[1:31:58] i mean please that when you read the
[1:32:00] word you're eating jesus
[1:32:02] and it becomes a part of your dna
[1:32:05] it becomes a part of you what you think
[1:32:07] about what you take in
[1:32:08] becomes part of your body
[1:32:14] amen that's helped me even in the last
[1:32:18] few weeks
[1:32:20] just to think about it more meditating
[1:32:23] money more
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:31] it does you good all right
[1:32:34] praise the lord god provided
[1:32:39] for us at this table
[1:32:42] a spring of water
[1:32:45] a spring of water cold
[1:32:48] cold water i mean like the water that
[1:32:52] comes
[1:32:53] from the word of god it doesn't matter
[1:32:56] if you're on your lawn mower
[1:32:57] it don't matter if you're driving down
[1:32:58] the road i don't care if you're driving
[1:33:00] your truck
[1:33:01] i don't care if you're whatever it is
[1:33:02] you're doing when that meditation is
[1:33:05] upon the world
[1:33:06] and you begin to let that flow in
[1:33:09] oh my it takes all of the bugs out it's
[1:33:12] good clean fresh water
[1:33:15] amen it springs up into the in your
[1:33:18] innermost it says
[1:33:19] into everlasting life
[1:33:23] but people don't want fresh water
[1:33:27] they don't want preaching like this
[1:33:28] because it goes right down to where you
[1:33:29] live
[1:33:32] your toes might get stepped on
[1:33:35] you'll find out you're really not what
[1:33:36] you ought to be
[1:33:38] you're not where you want to be but
[1:33:41] praise god
[1:33:42] for that i am not

[1:33:58] interests are in other places

[1:38:13] name in a new era from the time that it

[1:38:17] i did my part he was here this morning
[1:38:22] he couldn't do any more for you than he
[1:38:23] did already
[1:38:25] he could try to find ways to get you to
[1:38:27] what
[1:38:28] believe it that's right find ways to get
[1:38:31] you to believe god is a merciful god
[1:38:33] amen praise the lord
[1:38:37] draw my god and god will draw an
[1:38:40] eye to you care about god and
[1:38:45] god will care about you love
[1:38:49] god and god will love you
[1:38:52] because it don't matter how much god
[1:38:54] loves you that ain't going to matter a
[1:38:56] bit there's going to be a lot of people
[1:38:58] burning hell
[1:38:59] that god loved
[1:39:03] that's a little hard explain this
[1:39:04] brother butler can i give me a minute
[1:39:07] well give me about five seconds the rich
[1:39:09] man he loved the young man the bible
[1:39:12] says he loves
[1:39:13] the rich young ruler jesus loved him
[1:39:18] jesus loved cain
[1:39:24] he god was so caring for cain that he
[1:39:27] led him to water
[1:39:29] he said just drink this water and you'll
[1:39:31] live
[1:39:32] you know right just do what i day to do
[1:39:35] and you'll live
[1:39:37] i thought about the children of cain
[1:39:39] sons of cain sons of the devil which
[1:39:41] this world is filled with
[1:39:44] you can take the water by the parish and
[1:39:46] you can take them to the trough
[1:39:48] you can grab them by the head and you
[1:39:50] can stick their head down in the puff
[1:39:52] break this water
[1:39:54] down under water and you know all will
[1:39:57] come up is
[1:40:01] all you're going to get ice bubbles
[1:40:03] little air going out but they sure ain't
[1:40:05] going to suck it in
[1:40:06] they would rather almost die of a lack
[1:40:10] of oxygen
[1:40:11] than to drink this water they don't want
[1:40:12] it
[1:40:15] because that's how merciful god was huh
[1:40:19] let me tell you something the signs the
[1:40:21] wonders the miracles that god in this
[1:40:23] generation was so generous
[1:40:25] to show this world what was really truth
[1:40:28] and they still don't want it
[1:40:34] oh yeah brother brahms tapes will be
[1:40:37] played back at judgment
[1:40:40] he says this tape will be played back
[1:40:42] because this is not me this is god doing
[1:40:45] and the works that god did in this
[1:40:47] generation will be played back to them
[1:40:50] and like brother brian says we've got
[1:40:51] all the prophets all the sages all the
[1:40:53] examples
[1:40:54] you know it's going to be more tolerable
[1:40:56] for sodom and gomor than for this city
[1:40:58] because if they stood if they had the
[1:41:00] miracles done in that city they'd
[1:41:01] repent that's what he said become more
[1:41:05] tolerable
[1:41:07] amen than for these
[1:41:10] who had these miracles done proving
[1:41:14] amen what was really truth
[1:41:17] and then still denying it
[1:41:22] we have an unbelieving bunch of world
[1:41:24] today
[1:41:25] amen living
[1:41:29] in satan's eden praise be to god

[1:49:01] between the righteous and the wicked
[1:49:04] between him that serveth god
[1:49:06] and him that service him not

[1:49:11] church for a while somebody that's been
[1:49:13] studying their bible that knows right
[1:49:14] from wrong
[1:49:16] how many believe we need to know right
[1:49:17] from wrong
[1:49:19] amen now notice this
[1:49:23] right into chapter 4 of malachi behold
[1:49:26] the day cometh that shall
[1:49:28] burn as an oven
[1:49:32] put this under loudspeakers put this on
[1:49:34] every radio station put this on every tv
[1:49:36] channel
[1:49:37] that there is in the world and let's
[1:49:39] read it
[1:49:41] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[1:49:44] oven and all the proud yea all that do
[1:49:48] wickedly shall be stubble
[1:49:53] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:49:57] up just like it did sodom and gomorrah
[1:50:02] for thus saith the lord of hosts
[1:50:08] and it shall leave them neither root
[1:50:12] nor branch amen
[1:50:18] that's a sad ending isn't it that's a
[1:50:21] sad ending
[1:50:23] next verse has something in it i really
[1:50:26] like
[1:50:27] it says but
[1:50:31] let's give the lord a hand bye
[1:50:38] but unto you that are reverent
[1:50:41] you that fear you that respect
[1:50:46] my name shall the son of righteousness
[1:50:50] arise with healing in his wings
[1:50:56] amen and you shall go forth and grow up
[1:50:58] as calves
[1:50:59] of the stall and you shall tread down
[1:51:03] the wicked and there shall
[1:51:07] be ashes under the souls of your feet
[1:51:10] in the day that i do this saith
[1:51:14] the lord of hosts
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:27] that's the scripture i want to be found
[1:51:29] in
[1:51:31] a person that fears and reverences
[1:51:35] the lord the one that allows the holy
[1:51:39] spirit
[1:51:40] to lead and to guide
[1:51:43] to convict you your mom might not see it
[1:51:47] your dad might not see it
[1:51:49] in my case the people might not see it
[1:51:52] but god sees it
[1:51:54] he knows your heart and he has to bring
[1:51:56] the conviction in your heart
[1:51:58] saying look you did this little
[1:52:00] something you said something you
[1:52:02] shouldn't have said
[1:52:04] or you didn't do something simply that
[1:52:06] sin of neglect
[1:52:08] you didn't do something that you should
[1:52:10] have done
[1:52:11] amen all right let me come to a close
[1:52:18] so we see that god has supplied
[1:52:20] everything isn't that right
[1:52:22] is there no balm and gideon is there no
[1:52:24] healing is there no medicine
[1:52:28] you go to the doctor's office and he's
[1:52:29] got no medicine where are you going to
[1:52:31] go
[1:52:33] the next doctor's office is that right
[1:52:37] go where there's medicine that's why you
[1:52:40] got to watch what church you go to
[1:52:41] nowadays make sure you've got medicine
[1:52:43] in there
[1:52:45] make sure the holy ghost is there make
[1:52:48] sure they got something that they can
[1:52:49] give you
[1:52:50] that'll help you
[1:52:56] amen so god has supplied the medicine is
[1:52:59] there no vaccine remember brother
[1:53:01] message many times on the message call
[1:53:04] why
[1:53:05] amen so here we are
[1:53:09] a changing of dispensation god's
[1:53:11] responsibility has been taken care of
[1:53:13] it's finished now it's up to you
[1:53:14] whosoever will let him come

[1:54:17] at the day of judgment why
[1:54:22] why i've said different times i believe
[1:54:25] that's one of the main questions
[1:54:26] that god's going to ask the world is why

[1:54:30] when i invited you it wasn't just my kin
[1:54:33] folks not just

[1:56:22] quiet because they're
[1:56:23] packed full of vitamins and nutrition

[1:56:27] they're not like the starving calf that
[1:56:29] the farmer never fed all winter

[1:56:34] went outside of the fence
[1:56:35] and made it on the green and couldn't
[1:56:37] barely walk
[1:56:40] no it can't barely all go miserable
[1:56:43] there was another preacher that
[1:56:44] fed his church i mean another pastor
[1:56:46] that fed his little
[1:56:47] uh you know calf and when he got out
[1:56:50] there he got no

[1:56:58] don't know what sound to make so they
[1:57:00] just bellow out

[1:57:04] prophet of god put it that little
[1:57:06] starved calf
[1:57:08] says ah that person thinks they're so
[1:57:10] spiritual the amens they say in church

[1:57:35] closing
[1:57:37] in a orchard with fruit trees
[1:57:42] what fruit ripens first
[1:57:45] where is it located
[1:57:48] top of the tree right by the way the
[1:57:51] coons ate all our
[1:57:52] peaches the first year i had a bunch of
[1:57:53] good peaches and the coons came and
[1:57:56] robbed me
[1:58:00] you were just about ripe i got one good
[1:58:02] pump juicy one that was ready i ate it
[1:58:04] my wife come back out there and say
[1:58:05] somebody was hungry we've got some bum

[1:58:10] somebody came and ate all our peaches i
[1:58:11] don't know anything you could do that
[1:58:14] because we found some of them little
[1:58:15] nuts down on the bottom i said something
[1:58:17] i believe it was
[1:58:17] or something
[1:58:21] hey let me tell you something if the
[1:58:23] devil has robbed you of your fruit of

[1:58:34] right to be here
[1:58:36] my tree's gonna be full of fruit top of
[1:58:39] the tree is where it ripens first
[1:58:42] why
[1:58:46] yes it's the one that gets the most
[1:58:50] sunlight
[1:58:54] who this church is the most spiritually
[1:58:56] mature
[1:58:59] the one that basks in the word of god
[1:59:02] the one that just stays in the light of
[1:59:04] the word the sun
[1:59:06] isn't that right you're going to ripen
[1:59:09] so much quicker
[1:59:12] you're not going to ripen real quick
[1:59:13] down in the basement in some dark place
[1:59:16] is that right
[1:59:21] and it's about time he believes it's
[1:59:22] about time to be right brother troy
