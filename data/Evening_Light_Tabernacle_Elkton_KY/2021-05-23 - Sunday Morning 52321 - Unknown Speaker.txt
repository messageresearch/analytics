lord this morning you believe you're a child of the king amen does his royal blood flow through your veins amen we're a blessed people this morning uh if you want to turn in your bibles while you're turning i'm going to read a quote i will read in the book of hosea this morning and while you're turning there i just want to read a little quote here that the prophet shared to lay a foundation of our thoughts this morning and i trust it it will all pull together and got a couple of different stories we're going to get into and and thoughts in the bible maybe something than you heard scriptures and and um and it can be tied together with the message so that's the way i look at if you've got your front sight and your rear sight and they line up you'll hit your target so uh brother brown says uh he says now jesus said and the scriptures declare that god has hid the gospel from the eyes of the wise and the prudent so you'll never know it by theology and reveal it to babes such as will learn is that right he says just remember it's hid from the smart people you'll never know it you don't know it by your theology or by your education you know it by your faith you believe it and faith is something that you can't see or know he said did you ever read a line from your wife he said when i was in africa my wife would write me a letter and she would say dear husband i'm sitting here tonight thinking of you he said i love her he said when i left home i didn't have to say to her now look don't do this don't go with nobody else i'm your husband and you don't go out here and you don't do that and i don't have to do that because she loves me and i love her he said and i say goodbye honey pray for me and i go on and i know that's what she does she does it and i do the same because i love her and she loves me so it's just a love affair he said that's the same way it is with god i just take his word that's all there is to it no matter what you see he said but when she writes me a letter now listen to this when she writes me a letter she might kind of hold a little bit back and refrain she'll say a certain certain thing but i know she's talking and i'm in the letter reading that letter i can read between the lines there's something special about it when there's a relationship between a husband and a wife and it's such a special relationship that she can say a key word she's telling him a key word to the prophet and he says she don't have to write out the whole thing she just has a word here a word there and i can read between the lines and know what she's telling me he said and i know what she's talking about i can read between the lines now there's a whole lot of that in this great love story of the bible read between the lines let's look in hosea if we could chapter 1. the word of the lord came to hosea the son of berea during the reign of uzziah jotham ahaz hezekiah king of judah and during the reign of jeroboam son of joe joe hash king of israel the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go and take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the lord let's just go before the lord in prayer heavenly father we're thankful lord to be in your house this morning lord we're thankful for a group of people a house of people that's come this morning inspecting lord and lord you can hear it in their voices and their worship and in their praise lord and they're they're expecting something from you lord and lord if we come expect them we know that you're a deliverer lord that you will bring delivery of the word lord that will sink down into our hearts and draw us close to you lord and as these thoughts we look at today lord if there's anything in our lives lord that that we would feel we're falling short upon anything in our lives lord as these words go forth today that we're guilty of lord maybe you just find favor in your eyes lord and forgive us of where we fail you lord because we want to be guiltless up on that day lord when when we come before there and the rapture takes place we don't want anything holding us back lord anything that would tie us to this world or to this earth or to the any of the the demonic things that go on in this world lord so we ask for that deliverance today lord lord we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you and just give all glory and honor unto you in jesus name and the bride said amen you can have your seats i want to speak to you this morning if i could for a few minutes on the greatest love story the greatest love story now we as human beings we are captain john michael you're smiling for the greatest love story we as human beings are captivated by a good love story it's just something that draws us to it we tend to like the storyline when boy meets girl or girl meets boy and they fall in love and there's something they see something special about one another and there's something that they go and they just can't be separated you can't pull them apart they're just so in love with one another and we are intrigued by that that they may go through ups and downs and valleys there may be things that that as they're dating important that they may be disappointments that come along the way but there's something in it about each other that they just can't let each other go and we know that at the end they're going to live happily ever after we love a happy ending we love a happy ending the good thing is that in this book we have the bible and we know that there is an ending in this book and in this book we know the ending we know we win it's a happy ending for the bride of christ and christians around the world so if i were to ask you this morning what is the greatest love story maybe if i were to ask the english theologian or somebody in that profession there they would say romeo and juliet romeo and juliet may be one of the greatest love stories of all time you've got young man young woman so in love divided by kingdoms but yet can't find themselves apart they love each other so much that they're willing to die so that the other never has to live without each other what a love story and you say well maybe it's the latest movie that hallmark puts out there's a happy ending there right hallmark never puts out a movie with that unhappy ending maybe you would answer that it's adam and eve and we find adam in the very beginning when god comes down he creates adam and he pulls him out of the dust of the earth and he builds man and the prophet said there stood atom with his toes in the ground like roots and he stands solid and god pulls a pulls from adam and makes himself a wife eve and that there was such a love relationship there that would happen in the garden of eden adultery but adam stands beside his wife and says i will take it too so you don't have to go through it that's a love story maybe it's when jesus christ you look at and you say maybe it's jesus christ is the greatest love story on the cross when he died that is the greatest love story that we can think but brothers and sisters for the bride of jesus christ there is even a greater love story than that the bride of jesus christ has a special calling a special elected group of people from the foundation of the world where god placed in them a predestinated seed and god says i love you through it all now this is where we're going to get sticky and some of my denominational friends would probably beg to differ with me there are many christians in this world there are many christians in this world but being a christian does not make you the bride of jesus christ being a christian does not make you the bride jesus christ accepting christ as your savior does not give you the ticket to the rapture there is a hidden mystery there is a hidden mystery that is only known through faith brother brown said it's through faith it's right there in the faith in that holy spirit it's the holy ghost filled believer that takes the rapture you know there's christians throughout the world that believe because they go to church and i say christians i'm talking christians i'm talking message christians baptist christians methodist christians christians they because they go to church they pay their tithes they give their offerings they maybe serve on the deacon board they do this that and the other all these things they think that they're going in a rapture there's a confusion there somebody's confused there and sometimes we even hear it amongst message people we intertwine and we use the message when we say bride and church and christian and believer all these words tied together but what does that really mean when we break it down because these people if they're not filled with the holy ghost they can serve on all the deacon boards they want if these people are not filled with the holy ghost they can give tithes every day endless they may be blessed sure blessings will come in because they're doing their duty but that does not mean that they're going to take a rapture and answers brother brown was asked will only those who have the baptism of the holy ghost be in the rapture of the church or will all believers be indicated so let's just kind of i'm not changing what he said let's just change the word so we can understand more what the question was let's just read it this way if only those who have the baptism well only those who have the baptism of the holy ghost be in the rapture of the church or will all christians be indicated let's read it that way so let's look at what john 3 16 says very familiar scripture we know it for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life what's to say next for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned here we still haven't said anything about the holy ghost he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god so listen the way brother brown answers this question now he says we ain't got time to justify it but only the holy ghost bride will be in the rapture the others won't be lost look he said who's going to judge the earth the saints daniel said daniel said i saw him coming to an ancient time and he came with ten thousands times ten thousands of his saints is that right the rapture of the church had gone and they come down and judgment was set and the books were opened is that right and another book was open it was the book of life the sanctified believer that hadn't received the holy ghost he said didn't jesus teach that ten virgins went out to meet the bridegroom all of them were virgin pure and holy these five didn't get the holy ghost these five had the holy ghost the oil and their lamp now during this time we ought to understand that during that time of a marriage ceremony there was a there was a march a wedding march that took place and so everybody that came virgins and so forth they came and they would bring lamps with them and it was their responsibility to have oil in their lamps whether it was a a small lamp or a twig a stick whatever they were going to march the bride and the bridegroom through the street when the bridegroom made his call so here they were waiting in this scene we can imagine these virgins are sitting there waiting and there's they fall asleep they fall asleep five prepared five unprepared then the bridegroom calls out and they say oh let us go in and then what do they say give us some of your oil no you're not getting my oil this is my god my holy ghost my all that i have worked for i s i prepared for this ceremony and here are these five that wanna they wanna go get oh and they can't and brother brown said that the virgins the virgins the five the five that were prepared went into the wedding supper he goes on to say it this way breaking it down he says to you women and i always liked it when i read this quote years for years now he says to you women when you lay down a pattern and it's a nice piece of goods he says it's the same goods in it and you take it like this and you lay your pattern this way and you're going to cut it you're going to cut the pattern out of the fabric he said you cut the garment out and the rest of it is used sometime or another you're going to use it whether it's piecing together a quilt or whatever women are going to use it he said it's just as good as the goods as the rest of it but by election you chose how you wanted that pattern to look on what you were making by election you chose that he said and this the rest of it is just as holy and just as good and just as expensive but it was your choice and god has promised that we're going in the rapture by election and the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years is that right he said he'll not be lost but the holy ghost bride will go in the rapture the rest of them will come through the judgment bride christian are you with me now we look at hosea this is where we're going to get to get into where the rubber meets the road so the lord began to speak to hosea and the lord says to this man this prophet of god go and take into yourself an adulterous wife and a wife and with children of unfaithfulness what scandal that would be what scandal that is if god comes down to this man a man of god and is told to go find a promiscuous wild woman and marry her well it's quiet brother ben said he could hear a pin drop i hear crickets god tells this man to go find the wildest promiscuous woman that you can find and marry her and we begin to look at this and we realize how in the world could this be how could this be and then we realized that the pain involved would cause us to have such sympathy on hosea and for god because god is telling this holy man go marry a woman with a bad reputation a reputation for unfaithfulness go marry a woman who is going to break your heart no will never be faithful to you go and marry a woman that is by her nature her own wicked nature is certainly going to commit adultery on you anybody ever read this before go pick the vilest woman that is destined to cause you endless frustration and grief so the obvious question we look at this and we say why in the world would a prophet be called to marry a woman such as this what would compel god to do such a thing can you imagine how he must have felt getting the the word the vision the word of the lord as a prophet and god compelling him to do such as this here's where we have to read between the lines as the prophet said in that love we have to read between the lines we have to look here and deep and interpret what this love story is because the bible tells us that in the land it was the it was the guilty and violence of adultery and they had departed from the lord so he married gomer the daughter of diblaine and she conceived and bury him a son and no doubt they were still even though israel at that time was as vile as vile could be there were still some men of integrity some men of god some other prophets and priests and so forth that had to come up to hosea and say hosea you're very respected amongst the community you're very respected about god and people of god how could you do this you how could you how could you uh take and live such a life as this you're held with high esteem your wife is a disgrace what kind of decisions are you making what are you thinking i can picture hosea standing there offended i can picture him offended and maybe ask him the better question isn't why am i married to a woman like that but why is such a good and loving god married to an adulterous people like you you see that i see what's happening now see what's happening now hosea was married to an adulterous woman because god was married to an adulterous people and god had to do what was taken place at the time so by hosea's harlot harlot running around with all these other men they were showing israel that they were doing the same thing with other gods they were in idolatry they were learning with idols and in god's eyes they were doing the very same thing so he was an eye opener look at what you're doing you're pointing your fingers at hosea but you are living the very same life well at that point in time israel had all their priorities out of order they're all out of or out of order and idolatry was up there at the top of the list and let me tell you brothers and sisters idolatry can be subtle idolatry can be so subtle and the more subtle it is the more dangerous it is because we can't even see the dividing power we can't even see the dividing power and we got to be careful that we don't fall into those same traps of idolatry because it's so easy to do even if you're the elected bride of christ our jobs begin to separate us from jesus it becomes important to succeed in life that you begin to trust in your own efforts your own abilities to provide for your family and now all of a sudden trusting in god becomes obsolete you get so consumed with life with your job that you completely separated from jesus we begin to live out our hobbies everybody got a hobby you need a hobby it just don't need to be before god everybody needs a hobby but not before god because one thing you know you begin to separate your life of christ with the things you want to go do for fun and entertainment that's what these people were doing fun and entertainment let me reword it a little bit this morning oh and our desires our wants our cravings are on ourselves separation and divide and what does satan want to do he wants to divide and conquer the more satan can get between you and christ the happier he is he's working day and night 24 7 365 on you he's got he's got weapons that don't just pick out uh he just don't point at one person at a time he does that but he can point at the whole world at one time and focus on that one individual whatever your weakness is whatever your love is whatever your desire is he will find it you say well that's not me i don't even fish i don't hunt i don't golf i don't play sports i have any hobbies i don't really focus on my work i go to my job we read thousands of texts and emails and we text thousands of messages a week this right here is one of the biggest idols in the world and if you don't believe me check your hours check and see how many hours you're on this thing if you if you leave home and you you drive 50 miles and you find out you forgot it you'll turn around and drive 50 back to go get it because oh my goodness i'm lost without this thing i've got to have this phone see we all have something that we can put as an idol and we have to be careful i have to be careful my kids they get them dad you got to quit texting and driving you're going to kill somebody yeah i know i know i know but it was work it was from your mama it was from this that's not an excuse and i've got to do better because i'll begin to put this before things that really matter brothers and sisters what happened what happened to our first love what happened to our first love why is it when these things get in front of us we ought to be able to see the red light flashing stop stop stop stop stop but we don't do that what happened to our first love jesus speaks about it in the scriptures and he says i have somewhat against thee and what was it you have lost your first love so ask yourself do you love jesus today as much as you did five years ago ten years ago and when i'm pointing at you i got three pointing back at me because i look back at my life and i think man i have really truly if i'm honest with myself i've lost some zeal i haven't lost my love for god i love god more than i ever have and i depend on him more than i ever have and i trust any more than i ever have but my zeal and my passion and my love that i had when i was 16 and brother daniel williams baptized me and brother brian and sister jeanette's swimming pool in the cold winter as zeal is not there it's your zeal there oh me it's okay you can say it oh me what happens to that brother i'm saying that fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for the reaching out of the spirit it all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god it's cooled off and become a bit formal i don't know if it happens with age i don't know if the newness wears off but it begins to fade away and it be and then you find yourself being formal and he says that's what happened back there to the ephesians he said they were getting a bit formal they abandoned the abandonment to god was a dying out and the people were weren't too careful about what god thought of them as they began to uh to be careful about what the world thought of them so they didn't worry too much about what god thought anymore they worried about what the world thought they thought about what their boss thought they thought about what the people they hung out with thought they demanded a king to be like the other nations when they did that they rejected god but they did it anyway that's the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to god it isn't long until you see them stop doing the things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially satan creeping in he's creeped into he's crept into our church not just ours churches around the world our message is on fire like they were in the 60s 50s 60s i didn't see anybody lined up to get in this morning i didn't see anybody fighting to get to the front row well it's the truth they get likes and he said that's what ephesus means drifting so brothers and sisters what would jesus say jesus would say you're just running to the world like gomer runs to her lovers and you dare say that you love me so in the next chapter we see the story and we see god's pain and his anger and our false hope and those other things that will never satisfy and gomer was definitely a woman who was looking for love in all the wrong places that's an old song some of you probably heard it old country song but she was looking for love in all the wrong places god says i will not show my love to her because they are children of adultery their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in a disgrace she said i will go after my lovers watch what she says my lovers who give me food and water and wool and linen my oil and my drink she was going after people who could not only satisfy her needs but her desires she was going after somebody who could give her everything she wanted and her children were the product of adultery but the thing is she had a very good thing going but she wasn't aware of it she had a loving husband she had a good husband at home the whole time he's shamelessly caring for her and the whole time she's chasing her boyfriends and frolicking around in bad places she thought her lovers were going to take care of her they were going to provide for her they were going to protect her when her husband did all those things for her are you saying a picture between the christian life and god are you seeing the correlation there there's something that happens there brother sisters we get all kinds of gods and we begin to fight for the they fight for the throne in our hearts comfort money fashions pleasures legalism that's a big one legalism people around this message can't have love because they're so full of legalism they can't love somebody who's down somebody a christian who's failing a christian who's a gomer because they're so legalistic that they only see how good they are they forget from where they came might i say how do we know what's getting a grip on us as believers as bride as christians how do you know in your life what's getting a grip on you let me let me give you some things what do you sacrifice for what do you sacrifice for what do you give up paychecks for what do you give up time with your family for what makes you mad when things don't go right at work okay bar the doors what is it makes you mad when things don't go right in your business and nothing seems to be flowing and you get so mad about are you putting your business before god because you're awful mad about something that god's in complete control over what do you worry about you know i found out in life as i've gotten older a lot of things that i that i used to worry about they're insignificant they don't matter the only thing that matters is between me and god i've had things go wrong in business and people around me get frustrated and and they throw their hands and think what are you going to do what are you going to do we got to do this we got to do that they don't have this they don't have that especially during this covet and i said it'll be all right and they look at me like i'm a lunatic but it'll be okay it'll be all right because my god said he would never leave me nor forsake me he'll be with me even in me to the end of the world so what have i got to worry about if i'm doing what i'm supposed to do but what are you wanting to applaud you and i praise you are you looking for that promotion at work you're wanting that praise you're wanting that applaud these things these people they're going to steal your affection away from god if we're not careful god is the only one that gives us love provision protection he warns us that he's the one that can take it away every good and perfect gift is from above and yet his people who call themselves his people go looking for love and happiness and joy and fulfillment that places where god won't even be found gomer was a type of a wife much like today's church ignores her husband wishes he wasn't around as much isn't it inconvenient when you want to do something god's in your ear well brother david only me and you has ever happened to she wishes he was in the ground so she could go spend his money and she could get all of her gifts and she loves the affection of others and not not to mention layout of sins what do layoff sins love to be called christians they love to be called christians but they hate being married to christ you ever thought about that they love to be called christians call me a christian i'm a lay out this out call me a christian i tell you i go to i do this i do that but when it comes to that real relationship that one-on-one love of time with god to where you're like brother branham said i don't want to hurt her so i won't do those things some people they think well i just want to be left alone i just want to be left alone you're worse off if god leaves you alone you will be living a life of hell if god leaves you alone if god is not dealing with you satan's already got you and you're setting yourself up for a road of failure there'll be people thousands millions and millions of people that walked on the face of this earth and said god i want you to leave me alone stay out of my life i don't want no part of you and they will reach up and beg out the pits of hell that's the reality of it the pain that god must feel when we run from him and we reject him when hosea hurt do you think gomer cared now she didn't care when he cried out for she ran from him when he loved her she loved other men she could care less that's what makes it so painful can you imagine the pain that god feels when he catches us sneaking away with some of something else some other thing some other item some other idol can you imagine the pain that god feels can you imagine what would you how would you feel if you were sitting there and you saw your one and only putting their arms around another person and embracing that person sometimes we try to put things in our life we try to compartment compartmentalize it put it into little boxes little compartments we try to say this is my marriage and i'm gonna leave my marriage right over here and this is my work right over here this is my hobby right over here this is my friends and family right over here and over here is my christian life that's not what god asked us to do god doesn't ask us to leave our marriage over here all by ourselves god wants to be part of everything that you're in he wants to be in all of your life he wants to be in your marriage if your husband and wife you need to be talking about god you need to be talking about the things of god and what god is doing in your life right at this moment god wants to be a part of it god wants to be in your job he wants to be in your business he's not wanting to go over here and do it on your own he wants to help you that's what god does he wants to be in your hobbies he wants you to enjoy hunting and fishing golfing sports baseball whatever it is he wants you to enjoy those but he wants to be there too hosea maybe asked gomer maybe asked hosea why are you getting all bent out of shape why are you getting all bent out of the shape i may give my body to others but my heart still belongs to you brother sisters if her heart belonged to hosea she wouldn't share her body with other men and if we would give ourselves all to god and say that our heart truly belongs to god we won't go looking for affections in the world i don't have to search for approval from anybody why do we find ourselves sometimes thinking we need everybody's approval in our life i only need the approval of one person and that's god almighty he's the one that's got my heart i need to prove it to him by my actions by the way i live by the life i live by the words i speak the places i go the people i meet prove it that way imagine if your wife come to you and say you know what i'm going to be your spouse on mondays and thursdays the other five are mine yeah you'd look at them cross-eyed but why do we do that to god i'll be yours on sunday and wednesday but the other five are mine you know there's a song out right now that says what if the church on sunday was the church on monday wouldn't that make a lot of sense why should god have any more importance on sunday than he does tomorrow but yet we prepare and we get ready and we dress up and we we come to worship and sing praise god he wants that tomorrow too i'm guilty i'll be the first to tell you i'm guilty i have no shame in telling you i i lose at that i just told my wife this week i said we're getting up at five o'clock this week and we're going to do some things different she said 5 30 i said 5 o'clock we'll work it out but we're going to do some things different we need more time with god i need more time with god she needs more time with god my kids need more time you need more time with god make time for god we're in a late late hour as we go on into this story here the groom the groom here doesn't want the honeymoon to end so we think about the church on sunday being the church on monday and god wanting all of us he wants that honeymoon to continue out throughout your life so that feeling that you had when you were 16 20 14 12 whatever it was when you first came to christ and you had this zeal and you was on fire and you couldn't wait to pray you went to bed praying you woke up praying you woke up reading you couldn't get enough of god he wants that that's the honeymoon and he wants that to continue through day through day through day through our lives not just a phase listen to what happens to hosea here the bible says god says i will punish her for the days she burned incense to the to the other gods she decked herself with rings and jewelry and went after her lovers but she forgot me we've already determined that gomer was a a woman of the night she was a woman of the night looking for love and places and trying to get out there to mingle with others and while her husband her prophet her husband is at home and she's out mingling with others and the bible says that she forgot god now think about this immediately in our minds we get angry and immediately in our minds we're thinking about poor hosea and we want revenge this woman is treating him terrible and so in our minds we begin to think we want vengeance we want something to take place leave her right there if it was your friends you would say leave her out there get rid of her but watch what god says he says therefore i am now going to allure her i will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her isn't that an amazing statement isn't that an amazing statement like i said if it was our friend and our friend was standing there and you knew that his his wife was treating him that way you'd say kick her to the curb get rid of her leave her let her have all those men you don't need her anyway forget about it but not god god tells hosea to pursue her we don't see this picture of god often do we because we think about a god that is full of fire we think about a god that takes care of situations right but god is telling him this time go win back your lady because i'm a god and i'm going to win back my people he's just like a love struck teenager he wants to do everything he can to woo this young lady of his dreams he can't stand the thought of being without her he can't stand the thought of her being in the arms of another man aren't you thankful that god thinks about his people that way where would each one of us be if god didn't say i will go allure you back to me but we forget don't forget don't forget in exodus we read that god is a jealous god he's a jealous husband and he's constantly lowering himself to win back the affections of this adulterous wife a wife that is so beneath him this whole relationship just looks absurd and he's trying to win her back she's worth everything to him think about this see the picture now don't don't let it get too deep that you can't see what's happening god is looking out there at his people hosea is looking out there at his wife the people of god are committing all kinds of spiritual adultery hosea's wife is committing adultery but yet they mean everything to them what kind of love is that that's a love that you and i can't understand we don't have that kind of love for our and for each other we give up on each other but he's saying she's worth dying for even though she humiliated me she's worth dying for we often hear about and and the bride of christ and the church being the bride of christ and and that kind of reminds me that it's about not about i'm sorry religion but it's about a relationship it's about the relationship that we have with christ you know there's a lot of religious people there was a lot of religious people in jesus name so religious so pious so mighty they walked above anybody else in the streets they were so religious so legalistic they knew it all but yet they had no love in their life can you imagine as hosea pursues gomer through the streets as he's pursuing his wife through the streets through the dirty streets around shady characters and he's going to go up to these these men these hormones are saying have you seen gomer have you seen my wife i really like to find her i really like to talk to her listen what the bible says the lord said to me go show your love to your wife again though she is loved by another and as an adulteress love her as the lord loves the israelites though they turn to other gods and love sacred cakes so i bought her for 15 shekels of silver and about a homer and a left lethal of this has to be one of the saddest stories i think i've ever read into the bible isaiah is searching for his wife now a prostitute owned by somebody else ownership she's being sold out and here he is coming into a situation that just went from bad to worse at first she was just running around doing her thing doing what she wanted to do running in the world going here going but now she is in a place where she is owned by somebody and here we see the prophet of god standing outside of a brothel in a line full of strange men that are wanting to pay for the affection of his wife this is serious business and he's standing in the line sitting there and says i'm willing to pay for the half a price of a slave to get my wife back you talk about going into some bad places to find your love he's standing outside this brothel what kind of love is this what kind of love is this that such a pure and holy god would go into such a filthy sinful people and have his prophet stand at the doors of a brothel and pay for his own wife you add up all the totals of what he said he was going to pay for his life back and it equals the sum of money that judas was paid for the life of jesus that's not a coincidence that's god using a prophet in his day hosea i also pronounced hoshea joshua yes the way the hebrew name for jesus isn't that an amazing story that god's love would go into such pits of the earth to such dirty and filthy place then when you're giving yourself to the things of the world that god will stand in line for you that when you were at your lowest in your life god stood in line for you and he paid a price that no other man could pay for you brothers and sisters that's god constantly dealing with christians that's god constantly dealing with christians what a love is that what kind of love is that that's the kind of love that says brother brown said there will be people over there that you never dreamed in your life would make it will make it lord there will be people that you never dreamed in your life make it because of this kind of love can you imagine jesus can you imagine jesus standing there on that day and saying why are you chasing over this chasing over here chasing over there what are you looking for and he wonders why are you when are you ever going to settle down in your life what are you looking for love in those places for when i'm the only love you need that's why it's hard for the bride to sometimes believe that some of these people are christians we got to be careful if you consider yourself right and i hope you do don't get so heady don't get so haughty and how high-minded that you look down on people that say they're christians and you judge them and say that can't be a christian because think back about gomer she couldn't have been a christian because she couldn't have been a prophet's wife because jesus couldn't go to israel because be careful know the difference between christian and bride there is a love a greater love for the bride of jesus christ there is a special called out group of chosen people brothers and sisters people that don't run back and forth to the world now i'm talking to a different group of people now we're going to go into a different storyline because these people find god in their jobs these people place god in their hobbies these people place god in their families god is first and foremost as for my house we will serve the lord that's the kind of people under no circumstance do they go to the things of the world alcohol drugs cigarettes none of those things have any kind of pull or power on them they don't need any of those things why because they're filled with the holy ghost the holy ghost don't do those things they are so honed in and in tune with the bridegroom they're not like that ephesian church that forsaken their first love don't confuse yourself with first group we've all fallen short but there's something on the inside there's something on the inside that tells you that god has a special place and there's a special pull between you and god let me tell you there's going to be bride in denominational churches too oh boy ain't got no way man's there there's gonna be people i feel like i know some of those people that live so close to god that know not one thing about this message well talk about that one after church so honed and tuned in with god listen now to another story where brother branham's talking he's got a few more pages here brother branham says the bible is a love story of god's writing to his children do you believe that he said i love my wife we really got a real love affair she and i when i go overseas it's a similar story we told before a little different word and i liked it he says i don't come up and say miss branham let me tell you something thou shalt not have no other husbands and she don't say to me yes and my young man thou shalt have no other wives either no he said now that wouldn't be a home we're talking about a different kind of love now a different kind of love than what hosea and gomer had a different kind of love he said she said i'm going to go and she said she'll get down and pray with me one with another and says god bless you honey i'll be praying for you billy and she said i'll see you again sweetheart overseas i go and that's all there is to it i'll never live untrue to her i will never live untrue to her she want with me as long as we love one another when you love god you ain't going to hurt him so the question we have to ask ourselves are we living lives that hurt god are we living lives that hurt god because he says when you love god you ain't going to hurt him you're going to do everything you can that's the main thing in your life is to love god though i speak with tongues of men and angels that have not love i'm nothing love if you want to follow with me i'm going to go to genesis 24 now as we turn to another love story genesis 24 and abraham was old and wealth stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things and abraham said unto his eldest servant of the house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell so abraham now his wife sarah has died has passed on isaac now is leading a wife let's set the scene in order and isaac is needing a wife and and abraham makes uh eliezer make a vow with him that you will not find somebody that's not of our royal blood you won't find somebody out there that's out of the canaanites but you will go to my homeland but thou shalt go to my country into my kindred and take a wife until my son isaac and the servant said unto him prayer adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring my son again unto the land from which thou camest and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again the lord of god of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and swear unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from dance and if a woman would not be willing to follow thee then thou shall be clear from this my oath and only bring my son thither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter now you want to talk about a faith and a love that abraham had for his own abraham said i want you to go my servant i want you to go in into the my homeland and i want you to find my son isaac a wife and i want you to promise me under no circumstance will you get one from any other place but i want you to go there and i'm so confident that god has told me and showed me that the angels of god will go before you and prepare this place my my what a love so here we see rebecca one of the greatest stories of all time in the bible rebecca here with his love reciprocating eliezer reaches into abraham's home homeland and he goes and he's looking for this wife and he says one of the greatest prayers in the entire bible now listen to what he says paraphrasing psalm lord god of my master abraham give me success today and show kindness to my master abraham see i'm standing outside of this spring and the daughters of the town's people are coming out to draw water may it be that when i say to a girl please let down your jar that i may have a drink that she says i will drink and i will draw water from your camels too let her be the one you have chosen for your servant isaac by this i will know that you have shown kindness to my master brothers and sisters before eliezer had finished praying do you realize that if you look in the scriptures he said before he came out of my heart there come a damsel there come a woman there come rebecca out with a jar on her shoulder here come this beautiful lovely virgin girl we're not talking about a gomer we're talking about a girl that had never been with a man a girl who was so pure and lily what before he finished praying she went down to the spring to fill her jar and eliezer runs over to her to meet her and he says please give me a little drink from your jar and what does she say drink my lord drink drink my lord and she lowered her jar quickly and gave him a drink and after she gave him a drink what did she say and i will give drink to your camels too until they have finished drinking so here quickly she empties her jar into the troll so run back to get more water and fill the trough more and more so these camels can drink and drink and drink all along she don't even know who she is at this point but god has sent eliezer out to find a bride are you with me god sent eliezer out to find a bride for his son and eliezer prays this great prayer of faith and god is moving on the scene and eliezer then goes to rebecca's home and he goes there to see rebecca's family and laban sitting there and they're discussing the possibilities of rebecca becoming the bride for isaac and they're sitting there and here the servant eliezer and all of his uh contraband that was with him they come and they bring gold and silver and all these beautiful clothing to rebecca and costly tools and all these items and they begin to tell her tell her who she is who she will be and they eat and they drink and they spend the night the next morning it says eliezer woke up the next morning he said send me on my way to my master with her the lady said oh wait a minute here wait a minute here we're moving this engagement up a little fast here aren't we you just showed up yesterday you're paying us with gold and jewels and all these nice precious things and you're telling us about a land flowing with milk and honey and you're telling us about all these things and where you come from and how royal you are and you go wait i think we slow this thing down a little bit i think we need to wait about 10 days and let her think about this he says don't waste my time eliezer knew that the love of god had called this girl to the well eliezer knew that the love of god caused that woman that the angels had went before her and set up the scene that she would say here drink from my cup and let me drink and feed your camels as well let me water your camels as well so he said well let's just let the girl talk let's let her decide so they called her in there and they said rebecca do you want to go with this man and without hesitation i will i will there was no doubt in her mind she began to realize who she was that god had placed something in her heart that there was a future home waiting for her just beyond the hillside a place that no other woman could go a place that no other person could go because they wasn't worthy and she was worthy because the angels of god set it up that way i will i will so rebecca and all of her handmaids they begin to load up the camels with all of their supplies and they're riding back to the to abraham's place to me to isaac and she's riding and i love the story as it goes on and i love the way brother bill yon sings the song ellie needs to tell me more we want to know more about my god elies are telling me more tell me what's he look like is he handsome is he tall is he dark what color is his eyes oh brothers and sisters can you imagine what rebecca thought when she saw isaac out in the field and isaac and she got up and i think the prophet said he was just down kneeling to pray and he stood up and rebecca sees him and she puts that veil across her place because she's showing she's pure as can be she hasn't been with nobody else she's not a gomer she's not running through the world she's i'm pure that's my man brother branham said she jumped off that camel she run to meet him and it was love at first sight he said they were sweethearts brothers and sisters we had our eliezer for our day do you realize that do you realize that we've had our eliezer for our day that god sent a prophet in the hour in the most darkest hour that there is when there's no light left and he sent a prophet in this hour to come and prepare a bride and all the mysteries that the master can be made known what a love story the greatest love story the marriage and divorce was revealed invisible union revealed serpency revealed the seals revealed church ages revealed and all i know is that the more i learn about my master the more i love him and the more that i love him the more he loves me the more he gives to me this is the evening time brothers and sisters brother brown said look it was in the cool of the evening when isaac walked out and some people said well if you see him you'll know him he's a real dark jew and if you see him you'll know him because of this and if you see him you know him because of that and she said i don't care what he looks like he's my savior i don't care what he looks like it'll be love at first sight the bride of jesus christ is true to the word the bride of jesus christ is true to her god she's not running around she's not chasing idols she's not chasing the dreams and the passions of this world we've all got to live we know that we got to do things to make it through this life but we need to make sure what we're doing is putting christ first she's a holy ghost filled bride brother brown said what a great thing it is today lord to know that now we are united with one spirit one spirit the holy spirit has got the word and his grips and it comes in us and what a great thing it is what a privilege to cut loose from all the world and unite ourself to jesus christ and to think that someday in a physical form with a body like his own glorious body we'll set down at the table at the wedding supper and there will be united and wed in marriage to him and to live as bride and bridegroom through all times that is to come listen to this through a ceaseless eternity can you imagine the hand of god the arms of god wrapped around you in a ceaseless eternity don't don't miss it we can't miss it we can't we can't lose you can't afford to lose when i was in nursing school ten years ago whatever it was it was some of the hardest tests i've ever taken in my life and you think this is childish superstitious whatever you want to call it but every time there was test day i had a university of kentucky t-shirt and at that time it said refuse to lose i wore the shirt to every test refuse to lose bride it's testing time it's testing time where do we fall at to be a christian is a great great thing but there's also some hardships that come with that there's a tribulation that comes with that but to be a bride to be the bride of jesus christ is the greatest love story ever told let's stand our feet just bow our heads uh musicians if you want to make your way up it'll be fine all heads bowed and eyes closed we've told the tale of two love stories both of them today were tremendous love stories and showed great love and passion from god showed love and compassion to a people that was running from him a people that still turned to the things of the world of people or a woman who lived a life of adultery and and lived as a prostitute and was sold out to the things of the world and that love was so great that he chased her and he pursued her and he and he allured her into a place that he could say i'm all that you need i'm all the love you ever need quit going to the things of the world if you find yourself in a place this morning where you say i'm not sure i fit that bride message this morning of rebecca and a pure virgin bride who don't turn to the things of the world if you find yourself wondering where you're at just right there you don't have to raise your hand just be honest with god and say god please draw me close to you me in to where the things of the world don't allure me no more but that only your love is draws me near we need that relationship with god god needs that relationship with us he desires that relationship with us he desires a pure bride without spot or wrinkle no blemishes when the sacrificial lamb was given in the old testament that lamb had to be without spot or wrinkle or blemish it had to be perfection symbolizing as a token for what jesus christ was going to do on the cross of calvary that an innocent lamb will take on the sins of the world and now that innocent lamb has gone he took the sins of the world he made a way so that you could come back and if you're running in a place that such as governor was but now this lamb is going to come back for a bride and just as he was without spot or wrinkle she's going to have to be without spot or wrinkle [Music] she needs that token of the holy ghost over her life the token of the holy ghost is what gives you your ticket to the rapture brothers and sisters you've heard the prophet tell the story many times or the person trying to get on the the tram or the train and they didn't have that ticket to punch they didn't have that token that token wasn't applied to their life god apply the holy ghost token to our life lord jesus be through your eyes we may be seen faultless [Music] though in our hearts we have many we fail you daily lord but it's not our desire it's not that we're seeking things of this world it's just that we're human fill us with the holy spirit lord we love you lord jesus [Music] brother david can you start that song for us oh how i love him how i
