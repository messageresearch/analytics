[8:43] foreign
[9:06] my brethren rejoice in the Lord to write
[9:09] the same things to you to me indeed it
[9:12] is not Grievous but for you it is safe
[9:16] foreign
[9:22] for we for we are the circumcision which
[9:26] worship God in the spirit and rejoice in
[9:29] Christ Jesus and have no confidence in
[9:32] the flesh
[9:43] circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock
[9:46] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and
[9:48] Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the
[9:50] law of Pharisee
[9:56] thank you
[10:00] but what things were gained to me those
[10:03] I counted lost for Christ
[10:20] and be found in him not having my own
[10:23] righteousness which is of the law but
[10:26] but that which is through the Faith of
[10:29] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[10:32] by faith
[10:34] foreign
[10:43] if by any means I might attain unto the
[10:46] resurrection of the Dead
[11:01] Brethren I count not myself to have
[11:04] apprehended but this one thing I do for
[11:06] getting those things which are behind
[11:08] and reaching forth unto those things
[11:10] which are before
[11:18] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[11:22] thus minded and if in anything ye be
[11:25] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[11:27] this unto you
[11:36] Brethren B followers together of me and
[11:39] mark them which walk so as ye have us
[11:42] for an ensample
[11:50] yeah
[11:53] whose end is destruction whose God is
[11:55] their belly and whose glory is in there
[11:58] saying who mine Earthly things
[12:08] and this last one together
[12:10] who shall change our vile body that it
[12:13] may be fashioned like into the Glorious
[12:15] body according to the working whereby he
[12:19] is able even to subdue all things in
[12:22] terms of Amen you maybe did Brother
[12:23] Brian
[12:25] foreign
[12:36] that whole chapter you could or take
[12:39] this literally but you could go home and
[12:42] you've had a service already this
[12:43] morning
[12:44] when you read the first couple of verses
[12:46] in Philippians 3
[12:48] . see where Paul is letting everyone
[12:50] know he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he
[12:53] had all the knowledge he had everything
[12:54] and it didn't mean anything because he
[12:57] didn't have Jesus Christ to start with
[12:59] and it's no different for us she could
[13:01] have everything in the world and still
[13:03] have nothing you could be worthless and
[13:06] still have you have millions billions of
[13:08] dollars and if you don't have Christ
[13:10] Jesus it doesn't mean anything if you
[13:13] would charge me to the 9th and 10th
[13:16] chapter of Romans
[13:19] you know I was sitting there this
[13:20] morning
[13:21] I was read there was a devotional for
[13:25] January 15th before I get started in
[13:27] Romans I got it here it kind of speaks
[13:30] to what brother Thomas and brother Brad
[13:32] and other preachers
[13:34] have been talking about you know
[13:37] everyone here this morning knows whether
[13:39] you're who you are and what you are in
[13:42] Christ Jesus I mean it's not what's on
[13:45] the outside but it's what's on the
[13:47] inside and I'll read this devotional
[13:48] this morning
[13:50] for January 15th it it really speaks to
[13:54] what's been said Lately from the pulpit
[13:57] and the the verse is out of Matthew the
[13:59] 10th
[14:01] chapter verses 6 through 20. behold I
[14:04] send you forth as sheep in the midst of
[14:06] wolves be you therefore wives and
[14:08] serpents and harmless as doves you know
[14:11] that's really important it's not nothing
[14:13] wrong with being smart but you have to
[14:15] use that you're what God teaches you
[14:18] what he inspires you with you've got to
[14:20] be harmless about how you treat people
[14:22] with it and he goes on
[14:25] or they will deliver you up to councils
[14:27] they will start you in their synagogues
[14:29] and you shall be brought before
[14:31] Governors and Kings for my sake
[14:33] you know you bring it into our day and
[14:36] age you know we don't have a king here
[14:38] we have people that think they're kings
[14:40] but we don't have Kings here but you
[14:42] still have representatives in the
[14:45] government and for a testimony against
[14:47] them and the Gentiles
[14:49] but when they deliver you up take no
[14:51] thought of how you shall speak and
[14:53] that's you know we get times
[14:54] you know a lot of times we don't know
[14:56] what we're going to say or how we're
[14:58] going to say or when we're going to say
[15:00] it but if you just yield to the spirit
[15:02] of Jesus Christ God will give you what
[15:04] you need to say to that situation that
[15:06] you're facing this morning whether it's
[15:08] talking to another man a woman about the
[15:11] Gospel of Jesus Christ or whatever it is
[15:14] you but you got to store up you can't
[15:16] have no you got to store up can you
[15:19] apply the knowledge you stored up
[15:22] correctly no but take what you stored up
[15:24] and use it for his glory when it's time
[15:27] and needful and then um let me finish
[15:30] this
[15:31] but when they deliver you up take no
[15:33] thought of how you shall speak
[15:35] for it shall be given of you in the same
[15:37] hour that you shall speak or does not
[15:39] even speak but the spirit of your father
[15:41] would speak within you and that's the
[15:44] verse and this is what brother Brown had
[15:45] to say you know when you read that third
[15:48] I'm you read that third chapter of
[15:51] Philippians we just read
[15:53] uh you should never be embarrassed being
[15:56] believing in the message of the hour
[15:57] because Paul said exactly in that third
[16:00] chapter of Philippians what brother
[16:02] Brown said in the message of the hour he
[16:05] he
[16:08] he's just saying the same thing Paul
[16:10] fell away from church today and said
[16:12] well I kind of enjoy going down there I
[16:16] like to sing and people are friendly
[16:19] around a little
[16:22] don't do that so he's basically saying
[16:24] if you're going to church just for a
[16:26] good feeling and just because you like
[16:27] the people or you like the singing or
[16:30] you like the preacher that's not the
[16:31] purpose of it and he goes um don't do
[16:34] that brother let your heart become a
[16:36] flame say here I've got to do something
[16:38] about this I've got to go out and see if
[16:40] I can get somebody saved you know that
[16:43] really is a thought for the age that we
[16:45] live in and uh he goes on and don't go
[16:48] out saying bless God if you don't repent
[16:51] you're going to Paris it now go go out
[16:55] out excuse me go out in general and be
[16:58] as wise as a serpent and harmless as a
[17:01] dove and see that's the way you go way
[17:04] too go approach the person and you all
[17:07] know what brother random says about how
[17:09] you witness the people you don't witness
[17:11] the people sending their souls to hell
[17:13] but you wouldn't witness them with
[17:15] loving understanding it goes to say here
[17:17] approach the person if he's raising
[17:19] chickens talk about chickens to him for
[17:22] a while see and then the first thing you
[17:24] know you'll be talking about the Lord if
[17:26] he's a farmer talk about his farm he
[17:28] sells automobiles talk about his own
[17:31] automobiles for a while what nice cars
[17:34] you got so forth
[17:36] until you catch the spirit of when the
[17:38] father says now it's time to approach
[17:40] him about the soul and you know that's
[17:43] the same and witnessing and it's the
[17:46] same in anything that we do
[17:48] God wants a our quiet Spirit he doesn't
[17:52] want a Holy Spirit and then it goes on
[17:55] to say here you can wind it off you see
[17:57] that's a fine automobile you know
[18:00] Transportation day has become so great
[18:02] for how the Nations have been brought
[18:04] close together and the cities of our
[18:06] Nations friends and mothers can visit
[18:08] each other you know it's a wonderful
[18:10] thing to have on he's just trying to set
[18:13] an example on how to talk to somebody
[18:15] about about the Lord by first having an
[18:18] introduction to them like like you're
[18:21] selling yes sir it's sure how you know
[18:23] you're you know a puffing on a cigar
[18:26] whatever it is basically what he's
[18:28] saying here whatever you see on the
[18:30] outside you might
[18:32] foreign
[18:33] you just got to put that aside and
[18:36] realize that man or that woman has got a
[18:38] soul and you got to have an inner
[18:40] reaction before the Gospel of Jesus
[18:42] Christ can have its way don't do you
[18:44] ever think of the old times when you've
[18:46] already seen something like that just
[18:47] keep going on like that you know and
[18:50] after a while yep sure is you know
[18:52] another thing it does it
[18:54] it brings like we have it in like in
[18:57] revivals people can come across the
[18:59] country quickly for Revival you see your
[19:02] opening in the way of time you know but
[19:05] he's basically you know it kind of
[19:07] speaks to the edge right now you all
[19:08] have tablets you all have the ability
[19:10] whether you can come to church or not
[19:13] you can keep feeding yourself from the
[19:15] word of God and if you feel something
[19:17] close choke up clock up that way stop
[19:21] right there move over another doctor
[19:24] said to me Lord fill my mouth with good
[19:26] words then nudging when I said enough
[19:28] you see nudging when I said enough I
[19:31] think that's a good sentence for the day
[19:34] people
[19:35] have to real you know
[19:37] I'm a person of little words don't take
[19:39] me wrong I don't speak a lot but
[19:42] sometimes you can say too much or you
[19:44] might not say enough but I was reading
[19:46] this morning
[19:48] and then that comes I think
[19:50] if I if you went to your devotional
[19:52] Let's uh believe comes out of the Hebrew
[19:54] Series in the late 50s I think that's
[19:56] the Hebrews 3 if you all want to know
[19:59] where that quote comes to but
[20:02] I was thinking this morning as I was
[20:04] reading the 9th and 10th chapter of
[20:06] Romans
[20:07] uh I'll go to the 10th chapter of Romans
[20:12] I'm looking at the clock back there
[20:16] also
[20:17] of
[20:22] with what I was reading this morning and
[20:24] that Psalm I mean the Philippians 3
[20:30] um as I read this chapter
[20:33] he's speaking to the children of Israel
[20:36] in in his day and age brother Paul is
[20:39] but when you see him talking about the
[20:41] Jews we're talking about the south I
[20:44] just
[20:45] sees or Pharisee
[20:48] in now it's not a Hebrew church but it's
[20:52] a Christian church and I'll just read
[20:55] the 10th chapter and I'll sit down
[20:57] everyone knows this is this dance
[21:00] chapter
[21:01] for us to introduce people to Jesus
[21:04] Christ but it has a lot of other nuggets
[21:06] in it this morning and it starts with
[21:08] the first verse of the 10th chapter of
[21:10] Romans
[21:12] Brethren my heart desires and prayer to
[21:15] God for Israel that they might be saved
[21:17] so you would just replace
[21:20] I'm not being sacrilegious here just
[21:23] replace Israel with the current Church
[21:25] of the hour that we have right now are
[21:27] Paul would be no different as brother
[21:29] Branham or any other minister would be
[21:31] to see people saved and he goes on for I
[21:34] bear them records They have a Zeal of
[21:36] God but not according to knowledge
[21:38] that's the same thing for our age that
[21:40] we live in right now the church World
[21:42] they have knowledge but they don't have
[21:44] what they need they don't have the right
[21:45] Zeal in it for being ignorant of God's
[21:48] righteousness and going about to
[21:50] establish their own righteousness have
[21:52] not submitted themselves unto the
[21:54] righteousness of God and that speaks to
[21:56] today they're building denominations and
[21:58] they're building church but they're not
[22:00] building converts to Jesus Christ for
[22:03] Christ is the end of the law for
[22:05] righteousness to everyone that believeth
[22:08] and goes on say for Moses describe the
[22:11] righteousness which is of the Lord that
[22:14] a man would stealth these things shall
[22:16] live by
[22:17] you could take that verse and apply it
[22:19] to the age that we're at right now not
[22:21] the law itself but the law of Grace
[22:23] you think of it that way and he goes on
[22:25] to say I lost my place here I don't want
[22:27] to reread read starting at the seventh
[22:30] who uh the sixth verse which is of is a
[22:34] faith speak it on this wise say not in
[22:37] the heart we shall Ascend into heaven
[22:39] that is to bring Christ down from above
[22:41] or who shall descend into the deep that
[22:44] is bring Christ again from the dead but
[22:48] that
[22:49] but what is said the word is nine even
[22:52] in thy mouth and in thy heart This Is
[22:55] The Word of Faith which we preach and
[22:57] that's where we're all at this morning
[22:59] and if thou shall confess the Lord Jesus
[23:02] Shall Believe in thy heart but God had
[23:04] raised him from the dead
[23:05] thou shall be saved
[23:07] for with the heart
[23:09] man believeth unto righteousness and
[23:11] with a mouth confession is made unto
[23:13] salvation for the scripture saith
[23:15] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[23:19] ashamed and that's you know this was
[23:21] this is Paul speaking here and that's no
[23:23] different for us if you believe on Jesus
[23:26] Christ this morning you have nothing to
[23:28] be ashamed of you have nothing to be
[23:31] afraid of talking to other people about
[23:33] Jesus Christ there's no there should be
[23:36] no fear in it and I lost my place again
[23:38] for there is no difference between the
[23:40] Jew and the Greek for the same Lord is
[23:43] overall is Rich on to all that call upon
[23:46] them and everyone knows this verse
[23:49] it's in the you hear people talk about
[23:51] Romans road of salvation for whomsoever
[23:54] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[23:56] shall be saved how then shall they call
[23:59] him and whom they have not believed and
[24:01] how so they believe in him who they have
[24:04] not heard and how shall they hear a
[24:06] preacher you can't get away from the
[24:08] scripture here this morning that's how
[24:10] God sent his church that he would take
[24:13] fallible men to preach the Gospel of
[24:16] Jesus Christ that are inspired by the
[24:18] Holy Ghost
[24:19] and how shall they preach except they be
[24:22] sent it is written how beautiful are the
[24:24] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[24:26] peace being glad
[24:29] things of good things but they have but
[24:32] they have not all obeyed the gospel for
[24:34] Elias say Lord who has believed a report
[24:37] so then Faith cometh by hearing and
[24:39] hearing by the word of God faith and
[24:41] have not heard yes very their sound went
[24:44] into all the Earth and their words into
[24:46] the ends of their world but I say did
[24:49] not Israel know first Moses saith I will
[24:51] provoke them to jealousy by them that
[24:54] are no people and by a foolish Nation I
[24:57] will anger you and it's no different
[24:59] today
[25:00] you as message Believers I believe that
[25:03] kind of speaks to us today and he goes
[25:05] on to say I lost my place
[25:08] but Elias is very bold and saith I was
[25:12] found of them that sought me not and I
[25:13] was made manifest unto them that asked
[25:15] not to me but the Israel saith all day
[25:19] long I have stretched forth my hand onto
[25:21] a disobedient and gained same people we
[25:24] don't want to be that last scripture
[25:26] this morning we want to be the group
[25:27] that receives Jesus Christ freely and
[25:30] there's no there's no continent you know
[25:33] no disputing and that God has his way in
[25:37] our hearts and lives this morning I
[25:39] didn't mean
[25:40] take a lot you know as
[25:44] one thing I have Assurance of or as a as
[25:47] a Believer God is going to make a way no

[56:54] you'll just do a special work for her
[56:56] and also protect brother Parish Lord
[56:57] watch over him and be with him in a
[57:00] special way and any any of us Lord that
[57:02] has been sick Lord and we just ask God
[57:04] you just help us to believe and to know
[57:06] that we're completely better Lord Jesus
[57:08] we love you this morning and ask God
[57:10] that you would just bring us the word
[57:12] that you would have us at here Lord and
[57:15] say what you want to his father and we
[57:17] ask God that you tell me just to step
[57:19] aside and and as their Prophet said just
[57:22] to pull must pull himself into certain
[57:24] gear just to release himself and let you
[57:27] have his way Lord and many thoughts I
[57:29] have on my heart speak this morning
[57:30] Father and but Lord I know that it's
[57:33] going to take you just your inspiration
[57:34] and your leadership father to place it
[57:37] in there just the way that you want it
[57:38] this morning but we do ask God did you
[57:40] come father anoint us Lord Jesus and
[57:42] give us the ability to minister your
[57:44] word and edify the body of Christ this
[57:46] morning Lord be with different
[57:49] ones traveling not here Lord this
[57:51] morning and father those streaming Lord
[57:53] Jesus we ask your blessing to rest upon
[57:55] them in a special way and may we all go
[57:57] from here saying it's been a good good
[58:00] to be in the house of the Lord we love
[58:02] you and ask for your power now father
[58:04] just to come in his best way in Jesus
[58:06] name amen and amen I don't know what my
[58:09] voice wants to kind of uh be dampened so
[58:13] to speak it feels like amen but we'll
[58:15] see amen so I gotta well I feel like a
[58:18] new message amen
[58:20] so certainly I don't think that I've
[58:23] preached on it before amen but um it
[58:27] just come to me in a two words basically
[58:29] come to me and amen and I wasn't really
[58:33] sure even where it was found in the
[58:36] Bible and what it was talking about even
[58:38] but in those two words that come to me
[58:41] that I felt like you know I felt like
[58:43] the Lord was speaking to me about
[58:46] amen those two words were lying vanities
[58:51] lying vanities
[58:54] amen
[58:55] I says well I ask my father where do you
[58:59] find that in the Bible who was it what
[59:00] was what was said about that and so
[59:02] forth but amen and so amen but I thought
[59:05] it had to do with Jonah I was pretty
[59:07] sure it had to do with Jonah amen and
[59:09] his symptoms and so forth but
[59:11] amen
[59:12] and so we want to go to the Book of John
[59:21] he
[59:22] man
[59:25] this is really amen this is centered
[59:29] towards and certainly is uh Centered for
[59:32] the believer it applies
[59:35] to a Believer amen
[59:37] doesn't really apply to a unbeliever
[59:40] amen
[59:42] so we definitely want to speak to
[59:44] Believers this morning with the help of
[59:46] the Lord
[59:47] amen let's start with Jonah the first
[59:51] chapter and we'll begin
[59:53] of the Lord had prepared a great fish to
[59:57] swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the
[1:00:00] belly of the fish three days and three
[1:00:01] nights then Jonah prayed unto the Lord
[1:00:04] his God out of the fish's belly and said
[1:00:07] I cried by reason of Mind infliction
[1:00:09] unto the Lord and he heard me out of the
[1:00:12] belly of Hell cried I and that hurt us
[1:00:16] my voice
[1:00:17] for thou had cast me into the deep in
[1:00:20] the midst of the Seas
[1:00:22] and in the floods
[1:00:24] come pass me about all thy Billows and
[1:00:28] thy waves passed over me
[1:00:30] then I said I am cast out of thy sight
[1:00:34] yet I will look again Towers I hope
[1:00:39] the waters can pass me about now notice
[1:00:43] he's talking about his symptoms even to
[1:00:46] the soul the depth closed me round about
[1:00:50] the weeds were wrapped about my head
[1:00:54] I went down to the bottoms of the
[1:00:56] mountains the Earth with her bars with
[1:01:00] was about me every forever
[1:01:03] yet has thou brought me up brought up my
[1:01:07] life from corruption oh Lord my God
[1:01:10] when my soul fainted within me I
[1:01:12] remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[1:01:15] on in unto me into thine Holy Temple
[1:01:19] they that observed lying vanities
[1:01:23] forsake their own Mercy
[1:01:25] but I will sacrifice and today with the
[1:01:28] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that
[1:01:30] that I have vowed salvation is of the
[1:01:33] Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish
[1:01:35] and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land
[1:01:39] begotten His blessings to the reading of
[1:01:41] the words you can be seated
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:44] so we want to speak with the help of the
[1:01:46] Lord about lying vanities
[1:01:49] vanities
[1:01:51] and of course like we could take a lot
[1:01:53] of time here on this
[1:01:55] amen just talking about vanity
[1:01:58] and things that are Vain and I want to
[1:02:00] just go ahead and I pulled up the
[1:02:03] meaning of vanities and of course one of
[1:02:05] them we know vanity is uh
[1:02:08] it calls in the plural sense it calls it
[1:02:11] excessive Pride or in or uh admiration
[1:02:15] of One's Own appearance
[1:02:17] or achievements amen and uh
[1:02:22] then there's another another another one
[1:02:24] here as a modifier it calls it he says
[1:02:27] the quality the quality of being
[1:02:29] worthless
[1:02:31] or futile
[1:02:34] amen there's another one uh the
[1:02:38] adjective and another place he says it I
[1:02:40] ask it twice one for vanity and one for
[1:02:42] vain
[1:02:44] Amen in vain it says that it is
[1:02:48] um
[1:02:51] hold on
[1:02:57] vain means without acts without success
[1:03:01] or a result producing no results
[1:03:06] useless
[1:03:08] useless amen
[1:03:10] amen notice how that even Jesus talked
[1:03:14] about uh
[1:03:17] um
[1:03:19] how about the the Pharisees and talk
[1:03:21] about how he said that they in vain do
[1:03:24] they worship me teaching for doctrines
[1:03:27] of men something
[1:03:28] that is of no use amen
[1:03:31] and isn't this something how that Jonah
[1:03:34] now
[1:03:35] Jonah said and he called his symptoms he
[1:03:38] called his symptoms lying vanities amen
[1:03:43] praise the Lord
[1:03:46] all right well
[1:03:47] give me a minute I think I left my notes
[1:03:49] in here all right I'll be right back
[1:03:59] there we are praise the Lord
[1:04:03] I only got a few of them this morning
[1:04:04] don't have very many but amen I like the
[1:04:07] way that the prophet put it and I want
[1:04:08] to read it as we start out
[1:04:11] now brother bam he says you know
[1:04:13] everybody is looking at their symptoms
[1:04:15] the pastor will pray for them and
[1:04:17] they'll go over and say that well now I
[1:04:19] don't I don't seem to be any better well
[1:04:21] that's not healing healing he says no
[1:04:24] the symptoms are the worst things one of
[1:04:26] the greatest scarecrows the devil's God
[1:04:30] symptoms don't have nothing to do with
[1:04:32] it because it's what God Said Amen my if
[1:04:36] there's anybody ever had a case of
[1:04:39] symptoms it was Jonah
[1:04:42] he had boy he had the symptoms he was
[1:04:44] backslid
[1:04:46] huh
[1:04:47] backslid hands tied behind him in the
[1:04:51] belly of a whale about a mile deep
[1:04:54] remember he said you know I'm down below
[1:04:56] the mountains
[1:04:58] I mean and he talked about the different
[1:04:59] places brother but I'm talking about
[1:05:01] this mentioned how that my goldfish and
[1:05:03] after he eats it'll go down to the very
[1:05:05] bottom and spread its fins out and just
[1:05:07] sit at the bottom they said describe
[1:05:10] this fish as doing that in the belly of
[1:05:12] the whale about a mile deep in the ocean
[1:05:14] a stormy sea seaweeds wrapped around his
[1:05:18] neck you talk about symptoms he looked
[1:05:21] this way and it was all Will's belly he
[1:05:24] looked that way and it was all whale's
[1:05:26] belly everywhere he looked was whale's
[1:05:29] belly
[1:05:32] can I say something I'm gonna put a
[1:05:35] little to it I
[1:05:37] I've kind of have a tendency to believe
[1:05:39] that no matter where he looked he
[1:05:42] couldn't see a thing
[1:05:44] can you imagine Ain't No Light down
[1:05:46] there and inside of his stomach there
[1:05:47] ain't no light that I know of in there
[1:05:49] so everywhere looked or felt should we
[1:05:51] say everything was Well's belly we don't
[1:05:57] found him and I can only imagine this
[1:05:59] morning it didn't smell too good
[1:06:03] you know I you know I can only imagine
[1:06:05] there might have been so much water you
[1:06:07] know in there with him and he's slushing
[1:06:09] around in that slushy water and mess and
[1:06:12] the acid and oh my what a good you know
[1:06:15] God had to actually I believe God had to
[1:06:17] put some
[1:06:18] especially in there because when you
[1:06:20] were in the stomach that long you're
[1:06:21] going to start deteriorating right
[1:06:24] but for him not to deteriorate for three
[1:06:26] days isn't that right in that mess in
[1:06:28] that weeds and everything and then
[1:06:30] notice how he had symptoms everywhere
[1:06:33] and he said
[1:06:34] yeah
[1:06:35] you know even though I only Temple
[1:06:39] and that's in their eyes the better man
[1:06:41] goes on he says notice he says he had oh
[1:06:44] my run his neck you talk about symptoms
[1:06:47] everywhere look that away it was whale's
[1:06:49] belly everywhere look but he said there
[1:06:54] lying vanity
[1:06:58] right he said look at this whale's belly
[1:07:02] anymore but once more will I look to
[1:07:04] your whole Temple see it just depends on
[1:07:07] what you're looking at
[1:07:09] but once more is it not ice he says if
[1:07:13] you're looking at your symptoms they'll
[1:07:16] be there if you
[1:07:17] look at God's word symptoms will have to
[1:07:21] vanish
[1:07:23] I'm gonna take a little trip with the
[1:07:24] help of the Lord this morning let's go
[1:07:26] all the way from Genesis all the way
[1:07:27] down amen and I'll start with perhaps
[1:07:29] Genesis but I want to pick it up again
[1:07:31] when to Solomon and some of the things
[1:07:33] that Solomon
[1:07:35] talk about vanity
[1:07:37] because one thing and I want you to
[1:07:39] understand one thing that anything that
[1:07:41] isn't real is Vanity
[1:07:45] it's vain it's useless it comes to an
[1:07:48] end it's temporal
[1:07:50] isn't that right anything and we know
[1:07:52] that Adam
[1:07:54] amen Adam and Eve in the fall through us
[1:07:58] all into vanity
[1:08:01] he threw they threw everything the whole
[1:08:04] creation they threw into vanity
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:09] amen but you know as we pick it up
[1:08:11] perhaps later that Jesus come to give
[1:08:13] you something real isn't that right
[1:08:15] you know because even Jesus said the
[1:08:17] Bible talks about he didn't have the son
[1:08:18] have life he that hath not the son has
[1:08:20] not I come to give you life and give it
[1:08:23] to you more abundantly because even life
[1:08:26] itself was vanity
[1:08:30] if all you have is your natural life all
[1:08:33] you have is Vanity
[1:08:35] it's feudal it's worthless it doesn't
[1:08:37] mean anything at all
[1:08:40] oh my
[1:08:43] God but lying vanities it's pretty good
[1:08:45] praise be to God Thug we know that amen
[1:08:47] all these things are vanities first of
[1:08:50] all amen Adam threw us into that threw
[1:08:53] us into vanities into complete vanity
[1:08:55] and I want to have a scripture to back
[1:08:58] that up would that be okay
[1:09:00] that everything is Vanity
[1:09:03] Solomon he got a real revelation of
[1:09:05] vanity what it was all about
[1:09:07] but you know I like I like these all
[1:09:11] these vanities will try to bring up and
[1:09:13] call them lying vanities amen
[1:09:16] in Ecclesiastes all right Ecclesiastes
[1:09:19] will begin with verse 1 and perhaps
[1:09:23] verse 12. all right and I the preacher
[1:09:26] was King over Israel in Jerusalem and I
[1:09:28] gave my heart to seek and search out
[1:09:30] wisdom concerning all the things that
[1:09:33] are done under the heaven
[1:09:36] this sword travail hath God given to the
[1:09:38] sons of men to be exercised therewith
[1:09:41] I've seen all the works that are done
[1:09:43] under the sun and behold
[1:09:46] all is Vanity
[1:09:51] amen you know even before I found this
[1:09:54] scripture that was going in my mind
[1:09:58] I was thinking you know so everything
[1:10:00] everything in the natural is all vanity
[1:10:05] and then I'll begin to think about what
[1:10:07] some of the things that Solomon talked
[1:10:10] about his frustration with everything
[1:10:11] being so vain
[1:10:13] so useless
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:16] and he says all the works that under
[1:10:18] Down Under the Sun Builder all vanity
[1:10:20] and vexation of spirits
[1:10:23] amen now let's go down
[1:10:26] uh down to verse chapter 2 verse one and
[1:10:29] I said in my heart now and I will prove
[1:10:31] thee with Mira
[1:10:34] a mirth am I art th Mirth
[1:10:38] for enjoy pleasure and behold is also is
[1:10:42] Vanity I said to laughter's mad
[1:10:46] and tomorrow what does
[1:10:48] that's it I saw it in my heart to give
[1:10:51] myself unto wine yet acquainted Mine
[1:10:54] Heart with wisdom and to lay hold on
[1:10:57] Folly till I might see what was that
[1:11:00] good for the sons of men which they
[1:11:03] should do Under the heaven all the days
[1:11:05] of their life oh my I made me great
[1:11:09] works I build me houses I planted me
[1:11:13] Vineyards amen I made me Gardens and
[1:11:16] Orchards and planted trees in them and
[1:11:19] all kinds of fruits are you with me when
[1:11:23] enjoy all the fruits of all the truths
[1:11:25] and so forth I made me pools of water
[1:11:27] and watered there with the wood uh the
[1:11:30] wood that bringeth forth trees I got me
[1:11:32] servants and maidens and had servants
[1:11:34] born in my house and also had great
[1:11:37] possession of Great and Small cattle
[1:11:40] above all that were in Jerusalem before
[1:11:42] me huh
[1:11:46] he was a Donald Trump
[1:11:48] he was a multi-billionaire
[1:11:52] it was very rich he had everything you
[1:11:54] could imagine
[1:11:56] I gathered me also silver and gold and
[1:11:59] peculiar Treasure of kings and of the
[1:12:01] provinces
[1:12:03] I get me men singers and women singers
[1:12:06] and the Delights of the son of men as
[1:12:09] musical instruments of all that source
[1:12:12] so I was great increased more than all
[1:12:16] that were before me in Jerusalem amen
[1:12:19] let me tell you something this just goes
[1:12:20] to show it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:12:22] millionaire a millionaire
[1:12:24] I don't care how great amen like Jesus
[1:12:27] as you know
[1:12:29] you gained the whole world
[1:12:32] what does it profit y'all absolutely
[1:12:35] doesn't do your pentagon
[1:12:37] huh
[1:12:39] if you lose your own soul
[1:12:42] oh my my wisdom remained with me and
[1:12:45] whatsoever in my eyes desired I kept not
[1:12:48] from them I withheld not my heart from
[1:12:52] any joy and my heart rejoice in all my
[1:12:55] labor
[1:12:56] and this was my portion of all my labor
[1:12:59] and I looked at all the works at my
[1:13:00] hands that wrought and the labor that I
[1:13:02] had labored to do and behold
[1:13:07] hey
[1:13:10] are you with me somebody knows you're
[1:13:14] not going to get anywhere
[1:13:17] focusing on things that are vanity
[1:13:21] Don't Mean a Thing
[1:13:27] my he had gotten to the top
[1:13:30] whether it's wine whether it was music
[1:13:32] whether at all that I delighted myself
[1:13:34] in doesn't matter huh
[1:13:37] sexual pleasure with his 500 or a
[1:13:40] thousand wives huh
[1:13:43] doesn't matter what it is
[1:13:45] all he said it's all vanity
[1:13:48] doesn't get you anywhere doesn't mean a
[1:13:50] thing
[1:13:51] amen Ma
[1:13:54] behold all was vanity and next nation of
[1:13:57] spirit and there was no
[1:14:00] Prophet under the sun
[1:14:03] I think he described perfectly what Adam
[1:14:06] took us into
[1:14:08] that's where Adam took us into something
[1:14:11] that does not profit
[1:14:13] gets you nowhere
[1:14:16] amen because you can gain the whole
[1:14:18] world
[1:14:19] and still only own about three foot wide
[1:14:22] and six foot of ground
[1:14:25] that's your space
[1:14:27] and you're down under there and don't
[1:14:29] even know it
[1:14:30] doesn't do you any good
[1:14:33] that's where vanity goes and that's
[1:14:35] where vanity gets you nowhere
[1:14:41] how many believe the whole world needs
[1:14:43] to hear that
[1:14:44] everybody out there it doesn't matter
[1:14:46] how much wealth you get no matter how
[1:14:48] rich you get no matter how much land oh
[1:14:50] how much no matter how much pleasure no
[1:14:51] matter how nice you have it it's all
[1:14:53] vanity doesn't mean nothing
[1:14:59] pretty strong ain't it
[1:15:01] and he says a whole lot more and listen
[1:15:03] down to verse 17 so therefore I hated
[1:15:05] life
[1:15:06] because that the work that is raw Under
[1:15:09] the Sun is Grievous unto me for all is
[1:15:11] Vanity and vaccines the spirits
[1:15:15] oh my I can't help but think and feel
[1:15:18] that he had a little bit of what Abraham
[1:15:20] in it a little bit of what Moses added
[1:15:22] him because Abraham went and he was not
[1:15:24] pleased with where he was but he seek
[1:15:27] see who's
[1:15:29] filter and make her with God
[1:15:31] he was a pilgrim and a stranger and he
[1:15:34] had focus and he wanted more
[1:15:37] how many days that's the way a Christian
[1:15:39] is we want more than just what this life
[1:15:41] holds
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:44] that's the way Solomon must have felt
[1:15:48] I hate it all verse 18. yeah I hated all
[1:15:50] the labor which I had taken on under the
[1:15:52] sun because I should leave it and to the
[1:15:54] man that shall be after me
[1:15:56] how many knows that one thing that
[1:15:59] it's about the Millennium of the prophet
[1:16:01] in the Bible says that you know what
[1:16:02] we'll build houses and another cell that
[1:16:05] had happened
[1:16:09] by the work of your hand
[1:16:12] that's what we're fighting for something
[1:16:15] that's real something that's nothing
[1:16:18] something that's eternal
[1:16:24] if that isn't your ambition tonight you
[1:16:26] need to get
[1:16:28] on your prayer bones see God
[1:16:30] what is my desire what am I looking at
[1:16:33] this morning
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:37] my
[1:16:40] leave it after me for who knoweth
[1:16:42] whether he shall be wise or a fool ah
[1:16:47] this is what he said yes shall he have
[1:16:49] rule over all my labor worrying I have
[1:16:52] laid it and wherein I have showed myself
[1:16:55] why
[1:16:56] is Under the Sun this also is Vanity in
[1:17:00] other words you don't know what's going
[1:17:02] to happen with your fortune when you
[1:17:04] leave it
[1:17:05] your kids might spend your fortune in no
[1:17:08] time or maybe your kids perhaps maybe
[1:17:11] get sick or dissed out of the other half
[1:17:13] and then have to spend all about just to
[1:17:15] stay alive you don't know what'll happen
[1:17:20] like the Bible says one place he says yo
[1:17:22] don't don't look at riches they get
[1:17:25] riches get wings and flies away
[1:17:29] amen
[1:17:32] verse 20 therefore I went about to cause
[1:17:34] my heart to despair of all the labor
[1:17:37] which I had took under the sun
[1:17:39] amen for there is a man whose labor is
[1:17:42] in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity
[1:17:44] yet to a man that hath not labored
[1:17:47] therein he shall leave it for his
[1:17:50] portion
[1:17:51] this also is Vanity and a great evil
[1:17:55] oh
[1:17:57] and how I'm long story
[1:18:01] amen how many is looking for an eternal
[1:18:03] home
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:08] for what is half man of all his labors
[1:18:11] and the vexation of his heart wherein he
[1:18:14] hath labored Under the Sun for all these
[1:18:17] days are sorrows and his travail grief
[1:18:20] yeah taketh no rest in the night this
[1:18:24] also is Vanity amen so many different
[1:18:27] things but what's up there
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:31] so think about that vanity
[1:18:39] Solomon saying that all is Vanity all
[1:18:41] the works everything is Vanity
[1:18:44] praise be God
[1:18:45] under the first Adam he brought us all
[1:18:48] into this
[1:18:49] but the Christian
[1:18:51] for the creation
[1:18:54] amen it's not
[1:18:56] Christian has something that's not
[1:18:58] vanity
[1:18:59] amen
[1:19:02] I believe the Apostle Paul Allah I want
[1:19:04] to just
[1:19:05] go into the Apostle Paul
[1:19:13] what he said
[1:19:18] Paul said in second Corinthians 4
[1:19:23] Verse 18 for we look not at the things
[1:19:27] which are seen
[1:19:28] huh but at the things which are not seen
[1:19:31] for the things which are seen are
[1:19:34] temporal
[1:19:36] huh
[1:19:37] everything but the things which are not
[1:19:40] seen are Eternal brother random is

[1:21:52] the difference about them children any
[1:21:53] different is he is love he says you
[1:21:56] can't scientifically prove it to me amen
[1:21:58] but better ma'am says later on talks
[1:22:00] about you you know never win anybody by
[1:22:02] an argument it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:22:04] but
[1:22:06] the point was what program says anything
[1:22:08] that's real is something that can't be
[1:22:10] seen I mean that's what Christ came and
[1:22:12] that's what he died for is to give us
[1:22:14] something real
[1:22:15] even one place I believe the church says
[1:22:18] he says you know one day we'll that
[1:22:20] realization will come the perfect
[1:22:21] realization amen
[1:22:23] oh my
[1:22:25] let me go before I go into that that
[1:22:26] Avenue I want to go down here for just a
[1:22:28] little bit if it's all right let's look
[1:22:30] at some
[1:22:31] more now we realize that brother Brown
[1:22:34] says that you know that our symptoms
[1:22:38] is what lie to you you get prayed for it
[1:22:40] you get and you look at your symptoms
[1:22:44] right they're lie according to the word
[1:22:47] of God they're lies they're the one that
[1:22:50] lies the devil is what lies to you the
[1:22:53] Bible says one place that every man's
[1:22:54] word be a lie and mind the truth
[1:22:57] and certainly when the devil tells you
[1:22:59] something you don't want to believe that
[1:23:02] you know because he's certainly going to
[1:23:04] lie to you
[1:23:05] and their their Jonah was like mother
[1:23:07] van says you know Jonah was down there
[1:23:09] at the bottom of the well in the belly
[1:23:11] of the well we dropped around him and
[1:23:13] meant it didn't look at all but he says
[1:23:15] they're all just a bunch of lying
[1:23:16] symptoms I'm gonna be once again he knew
[1:23:19] that he knew God's Gonna deliver him he
[1:23:23] looked at the Holy Temple and he prayed
[1:23:24] and he believed in that confidence in
[1:23:26] the God Amen is that that uh I believe
[1:23:29] it was a
[1:23:30] um it was Solomon that had dedicated to
[1:23:33] someone he says God he and his
[1:23:34] dedication to the prayer he made a big
[1:23:36] stop of working and got all said he got
[1:23:38] in front of everybody and he made his
[1:23:39] big long prayer amen if anybody amen

[1:23:44] from Heaven if their backslip he is from
[1:23:46] Heaven all kinds of conditions nothing

[1:23:54] from heaven and Jonah with backslady
[1:23:57] with all terrible he said he was
[1:23:59] like in Hell
[1:24:01] and he said you know I believe and have
[1:24:03] confidence in the prayer Asylum that
[1:24:05] God's gonna hear it and he looked hard
[1:24:06] to Temple amen and got delivered him he
[1:24:08] says how much more you and I when Jesus
[1:24:11] said whatever things you desire believe
[1:24:13] in you'll receive him and you will have
[1:24:15] them

[1:24:18] and no matter what your symptoms are
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:23] oh my

[1:24:29] got a lot of symptoms
[1:24:32] yep got a lot of symptoms but they're
[1:24:34] lying symptoms
[1:24:38] how am I
[1:24:40] I like that don't you
[1:24:42] they're lying symptoms
[1:24:45] praise be to God
[1:24:48] when a person has got behind God behind
[1:24:51] them
[1:24:53] it doesn't matter what the opposition is
[1:24:56] look at David let's just look at David
[1:24:58] for a minute
[1:24:59] he got in front of this great big
[1:25:01] Goliath
[1:25:03] all right
[1:25:04] this glass war did he take him and he
[1:25:07] take him on the end of his beer and he'd
[1:25:08] feed his body and his flesh to the to
[1:25:11] the birds
[1:25:13] the fall of the air what could David say
[1:25:15] David could say you lied devil
[1:25:19] you are big you're huge bird you ain't
[1:25:21] nothing but a lying symptom
[1:25:25] huh
[1:25:26] cause today I'm gonna cut your head off
[1:25:28] because I don't
[1:25:30] come to you in my own power but I got
[1:25:33] the different set of eyeballs I'm
[1:25:34] looking at something different
[1:25:37] thank you
[1:25:38] amen that's what a Christian has to have
[1:25:40] you've got to have a different view than
[1:25:42] a natural person
[1:25:44] you gotta look and see by faith David
[1:25:46] seeing him dead yet no he knew that that
[1:25:50] God would come down because that bear
[1:25:52] went down the line went back down
[1:25:54] that giant that wanted to scare the
[1:25:57] liver out of David didn't scare him at
[1:25:59] all
[1:26:00] he was lying to me
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:04] Moses look at Moses a whole whole fair
[1:26:08] in all of Egypt when God spoke to him
[1:26:09] says go deliver my people he went down
[1:26:12] there amen and he chose him that he'll
[1:26:14] let that five people gone do you realize
[1:26:16] how many times and failed almost
[1:26:20] do not let them go
[1:26:22] Moses could look in his face and say
[1:26:24] Pharaoh you are lying
[1:26:28] you're lying because you are gonna let
[1:26:30] him go
[1:26:31] you're nothing but a lying symptom
[1:26:35] isn't that right

[1:26:39] hello
[1:26:40] should build Faith to know the hell yeah
[1:26:43] oh it's just me I realize I'm just an
[1:26:45] old man a gray-headed old man but I'm
[1:26:48] here to tell you it's not about who I am
[1:26:50] it's about who's behind me
[1:26:52] I want you to know this morning it ain't
[1:26:54] about who you are and it's about who is
[1:26:56] behind you
[1:26:57] who are you with if you're a God is with
[1:27:00] us who can be against you
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:04] he said you're lying there you are gonna
[1:27:06] let my people go cause God said you
[1:27:09] better let him go every man's word is a
[1:27:11] lie tell your word is alive because
[1:27:13] God's word is short he said I have come
[1:27:15] to deliver my people and he's going to
[1:27:17] deliver his people
[1:27:22] away from God I want you to know you
[1:27:25] don't have to stay that way
[1:27:28] all you got to do is look
[1:27:31] look and live
[1:27:32] look at what God Said
[1:27:36] oh my
[1:27:39] let me shout out something else
[1:27:41] something else comes to my Abraham
[1:27:44] Abraham ain't that right
[1:27:46] God told Abraham said Abraham I've
[1:27:48] called you I want you to leave your land
[1:27:50] I want you to leave
[1:27:51] your family are you leave everybody take
[1:27:53] you and Sharon you come out here and
[1:27:55] serve me out here
[1:27:56] what did he do he went out the way God
[1:27:59] said but when he do he brought his dad
[1:28:01] he brought his nephew lot
[1:28:04] and after a while attend he was backslid
[1:28:08] he didn't do what God had told him to do
[1:28:10] when you don't do what God tells you to
[1:28:12] do your backslip
[1:28:14] and then Abraham got miserable and there
[1:28:16] was a fight that brewed up between his
[1:28:18] his kid the herdsmen between lot and
[1:28:20] Abraham never the big fuss and the feud
[1:28:23] huh no doubt Abraham says I knew I
[1:28:26] should have brought him along God told
[1:28:27] me not to bring him alone
[1:28:29] foreign
[1:28:30] how many times in our lives you know
[1:28:33] something don't go right and ain't right
[1:28:34] because you know you do something you
[1:28:35] ain't not supposed to do
[1:28:37] you're not where you ought to be do you
[1:28:39] wanna then you get that conscience to
[1:28:41] condemn you
[1:28:42] huh
[1:28:44] but what was it Abraham didn't give up
[1:28:46] he believed
[1:28:49] no matter what God has made the promise
[1:28:51] I'm still going to be a father of
[1:28:53] Nations you'll work it out
[1:28:56] and Abraham's backslitting this is not
[1:28:58] being completely surrendered to God all
[1:29:00] of those things were just symptoms they
[1:29:02] were lying symptoms
[1:29:05] because God was going to do what God was
[1:29:07] going to bring this Strife he was going
[1:29:09] to accept get him to separate from his
[1:29:10] from God he's going to cause his daddy
[1:29:13] daddy was he died finally
[1:29:15] huh
[1:29:17] finally got to the place the brother van
[1:29:18] says he got the fully surrendered to God
[1:29:20] and God poured him out the full blessing
[1:29:23] let me tell you something so many times
[1:29:24] the devil will get you to look
[1:29:28] it's your fault
[1:29:31] look at your failures things that you
[1:29:33] think you'll never ever overcome the
[1:29:35] devil that's a devil's life oh you'll
[1:29:38] never overcome this you'll never
[1:29:39] overcome don't you believe the devil's
[1:29:41] lie
[1:29:43] laughs
[1:29:45] amen this is nothing but a symptom
[1:29:48] for a real believer nothing but a
[1:29:50] symptom
[1:29:52] praise be to God
[1:29:54] how many beliefs ever Abraham's children
[1:30:01] last week we had a little riddle about
[1:30:05] you need to be a bee
[1:30:08] don't be a wannabe
[1:30:10] huh
[1:30:12] and be a b don't be a hasbian
[1:30:15] you know something that used to be there
[1:30:18] you go
[1:30:18] be a bee not a used to be
[1:30:22] and not just not and I was but you are
[1:30:25] this week I have another one for you
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:30] let's turn if you will
[1:30:44] I
[1:30:46] I believe it's found in
[1:30:50] well I didn't Mark I've got the little
[1:30:52] tab here but I didn't uh here it is
[1:30:55] Romans
[1:30:56] Romans 4.
[1:30:58] Romans 4 Abraham talking about Abraham
[1:31:07] Romans 4 and verse 17 as it is written I
[1:31:11] have made thee a father of many nations
[1:31:14] before him whom he believed even God who
[1:31:18] quickeneth the Dead
[1:31:20] now I noticed and cold though things
[1:31:23] which be not
[1:31:25] as though they were
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:29] Believers call those things which are as
[1:31:33] though they're not
[1:31:34] and we call those things which are not
[1:31:36] as though they are
[1:31:41] the things that be not we call as they
[1:31:44] are and those things which be
[1:31:46] we call it as they are not
[1:31:49] in other words the symptoms
[1:31:52] because how many beliefs if you're an
[1:31:54] Abraham seed you are in the business of
[1:31:56] speaking things into existence
[1:32:02] and you're in the business of speaking
[1:32:05] things out of existence
[1:32:09] Abraham called it you know
[1:32:14] all his body well let me just read
[1:32:17] the rest of it can we
[1:32:20] who against hope believed in Hope
[1:32:25] that he might become the father of many
[1:32:27] nations according to that which was
[1:32:30] spoken so shall by seed be well it comes
[1:32:33] to mind let me just say something else
[1:32:34] you know what a symptom is a symptom
[1:32:37] there's a symptom called doubt is that
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:41] and a Believer what are you supposed to
[1:32:43] do with your doubt
[1:32:47] doubt your doubt in other words speak
[1:32:49] that doubt out of existence see I doubt
[1:32:53] that doubt
[1:32:55] don't believe that now I don't believe
[1:32:56] that I'm believing but
[1:32:58] the devil tries to put it in my mind
[1:33:01] bring every thought in your mind under
[1:33:03] the Captivity of the word of God destroy
[1:33:06] that symptom of unbelief
[1:33:10] well I can don't you ever say that word
[1:33:13] all things are possible to them that
[1:33:15] believe
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] Hallelujah
[1:33:23] oh my notice and being not weak in faith
[1:33:27] he considered not his own body now death
[1:33:32] he didn't know how it was gonna happen
[1:33:35] but I mean
[1:33:37] his body was dead at 90 some years old
[1:33:39] Sarah's womb was dead and again he
[1:33:42] wasn't gonna have no children perhaps
[1:33:43] they hadn't had no relations in 20 years
[1:33:45] or so how is anything ever going to
[1:33:48] happen
[1:33:49] but they did not consider it
[1:33:52] you know what another symptom of Abraham
[1:33:54] was Hagar
[1:33:59] isn't that right because his wife said
[1:34:00] they're going to Hagar and let's have
[1:34:01] the seed that the God promised they got
[1:34:04] their dirty hands in it didn't they
[1:34:05] that's why we got a bunch of wild men
[1:34:07] running around here trying to kill
[1:34:08] everybody
[1:34:09] yeah the Bible says every man's hand is
[1:34:12] against him and he's against every man
[1:34:13] if they ain't if they ain't fighting you
[1:34:16] and I they're fighting each other he's a
[1:34:18] bunch of Fighters you ever saw but God
[1:34:19] had a plan in it all but what that was
[1:34:21] solve this is the symptoms Abraham knew
[1:34:24] yeah we didn't do it was right I know
[1:34:26] that ain't good away that God's gonna do
[1:34:27] it
[1:34:28] but it's all a lion saying God's still
[1:34:30] gonna do it
[1:34:32] yeah man praise be to God
[1:34:36] not even his own body now that
[1:34:39] when he was a hundred years old neither
[1:34:41] the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[1:34:43] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:34:45] through unbelief was was strong in faith
[1:34:48] even glory to God
[1:34:52] Hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:34:54] Abraham was a man
[1:34:56] who called everything as always wasn't
[1:34:58] not all of those lying symptoms there's
[1:35:01] nothing but lying symptoms
[1:35:06] well you ain't holy enough you ain't
[1:35:07] running righteous enough you know
[1:35:09] there's going to be a lot of message
[1:35:10] people that's not going to go in the
[1:35:12] Rapture and the devil tell you you're
[1:35:14] probably one of them
[1:35:16] he'll try to put you in the mind you
[1:35:18] look at how you are you're probably not
[1:35:20] you're probably not one of them
[1:35:23] foreign
[1:35:27] are you ready
[1:35:29] well I got a good one for the devil when
[1:35:31] he tries to give me anything put that
[1:35:34] thought in my mind
[1:35:36] and if he does yours you just tell him
[1:35:37] this but I want you to know something
[1:35:39] that if I ever did make it
[1:35:44] I read the book
[1:35:46] I'm not gonna unbelieve that no matter
[1:35:48] what he tries to tell me
[1:35:50] huh
[1:35:51] is that right
[1:35:54] not a matter of you trying to make it
[1:35:56] God's going to see to it how many knows
[1:35:58] that the Seed of Abraham the children of
[1:35:59] God Amen whether you make it or not that
[1:36:01] is unconditional Covenant with God
[1:36:04] yes promise you I will do it it's not
[1:36:06] what you do sure I'm going to chastise
[1:36:08] it for you Craig I'll bring you to
[1:36:09] Perfection I'll chastise you for your
[1:36:11] mistakes but I'm not going to lose you
[1:36:13] he said I'm not going to lose any of
[1:36:15] them
[1:36:20] and what was it this is another good
[1:36:22] thought
[1:36:23] if if you want to take a different
[1:36:24] approach
[1:36:25] somebody said brother Brandon you're
[1:36:27] Antichrist even hell and this side of
[1:36:29] the other he says well okay
[1:36:30] they do then that's what I want to do
[1:36:35] whatever the Lord's will is for me
[1:36:37] that's what I want
[1:36:40] he says but I have a strong feeling that
[1:36:42] if I do I am lost and he cast me aside
[1:36:45] all I want is to keep this love that I
[1:36:47] have in my heart friend
[1:36:49] you know if I can have that because he
[1:36:51] knew he whether he loved the Lord or not
[1:36:54] if he kind of doubted that God was to
[1:36:56] cast somebody away to love you
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] doubt your doubts amen doubt your doubts
[1:37:04] doubt
[1:37:05] all your symptoms
[1:37:08] your shortcomings even they're lying
[1:37:10] symptoms
[1:37:11] they're not going to keep you
[1:37:13] this just comes to mind didn't brother
[1:37:15] Bannon say God's Gonna Save you despite
[1:37:17] yourself
[1:37:19] You're Gonna Save you despite yourself
[1:37:23] you might want to try to get in a way
[1:37:24] but God's going to do it because how
[1:37:26] many knows did you
[1:37:29] I'm glad that I'm not in my own
[1:37:31] I don't hold my own future my own
[1:37:34] purpose god holds my future and purpose
[1:37:36] praise be to God
[1:37:38] lying symptoms
[1:37:42] now false enough area lying symptoms
[1:37:44] Abraham Falls he had problems but they
[1:37:47] were lying symptoms
[1:37:49] that wasn't going to keep him from
[1:37:50] getting the problems he got the promise
[1:37:51] just the same
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:55] staggered not but he was fully persuaded
[1:37:58] what he had promised he was able to
[1:38:02] perform
[1:38:03] amen
[1:38:11] talking of Moses again talk about Moses
[1:38:14] a little bit by faith Moses when he was
[1:38:16] born was hid three months of his parents
[1:38:18] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:38:20] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:38:22] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[1:38:24] come of years refused to be called the
[1:38:27] son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:38:29] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:38:31] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:38:34] pleasures of sin for his season do you
[1:38:36] reckon that Moses got a different view
[1:38:39] got a different vision
[1:38:41] huh he's seen all the pleasures of Egypt
[1:38:45] him being the next Pharaoh just kind of
[1:38:47] like what Solomon was Solomon ruling
[1:38:50] everything and have every pleasure he
[1:38:51] could imagine
[1:38:52] huh
[1:38:55] and here Moses could have had it at all
[1:38:57] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
[1:39:00] with Moses I don't know that it was that
[1:39:02] way with uh app uh Solomon I don't
[1:39:05] believe he was a sinner
[1:39:06] and all that he kept all things pure but
[1:39:09] yet he could have all the pleasures amen
[1:39:12] until of course at the end how many
[1:39:14] knows his wives let him let him stray
[1:39:16] and don't mean it was I'm not saying
[1:39:18] that but all of his Heathen lives
[1:39:25] amen all right to enjoy the presence of
[1:39:28] sin for a season that's deeming the
[1:39:29] reproach of Christ greater riches and
[1:39:32] all the treasures of Egypt for yet
[1:39:34] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:39:36] reward he's seen a greater reward how
[1:39:39] many knows Paul said there's a flight
[1:39:40] Affliction which is put for a small
[1:39:42] season is not to be compared with the
[1:39:45] great reward for a Christian for a
[1:39:47] believer
[1:39:48] amen
[1:39:49] if by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing
[1:39:52] the Wrath of the king for he endured as
[1:39:55] seeing him who is invisible
[1:40:00] they believe it's important that you
[1:40:03] keep your eyes on the right thing come
[1:40:05] back into another thought but how many
[1:40:07] remembers brother Ram says Abraham was
[1:40:09] an old man is that right he was an old
[1:40:12] man
[1:40:14] and his body was

[1:40:18] this stooped over and had to go slow
[1:40:21] but he says he kept believing God's word
[1:40:27] he was as he put He says he said God
[1:40:30] came to him as our Shadi eye which means
[1:40:32] the breasted God and Abraham kept
[1:40:36] nursing on God and that's how he got his
[1:40:38] strength it don't matter if I

[1:49:52] know what I do if I were the Christians
[1:49:59] that's right doesn't matter Abraham
[1:50:01] doesn't matter old people how old you

[1:50:06] still shouldn't be depressed
[1:50:10] let me know as you get older our days of
[1:50:13] joy and our smile likes to turn into
[1:50:15] frown
[1:50:16] because there's a lot more aches and
[1:50:18] pains and things to be sad about when
[1:50:20] you get older
[1:50:21] huh
[1:50:23] sure

[1:51:11] that are vanity that are vain that are
[1:51:13] useless that are lying
[1:51:16] amen with Solomon perhaps they weren't
[1:51:18] lying it just seemed so real everybody
[1:51:20] gets it there's no hope for you to
[1:51:22] Future this that or the other but Jesus
[1:51:23] came to change all that so second Adam
[1:51:27] came to give his life to give it more
[1:51:28] abundantly to give us peace that passes
[1:51:30] understanding to give us joy unspeakable
[1:51:33] full of Glory to give us victory over
[1:51:35] sin and death how many leaves he gave
[1:51:37] his victory over that hell in the grave
[1:51:40] you give us victory over all of that
[1:51:43] I believe it was in uh uh
[1:51:46] possessing all things y'all got to
[1:51:48] listen to that tape I heard things in
[1:51:49] there even after I preached it I heard
[1:51:51] things that you know you know because he
[1:51:53] he brother man talks about death he says
[1:51:55] you know death you know it serves us now
[1:51:57] we have power over it now
[1:51:59] it does what we tell it to do in other
[1:52:01] words all it can do is take us into the
[1:52:03] presence of God the unbeliever sure it
[1:52:06] takes out into
[1:52:07] the wrong place between to us it's a
[1:52:10] little vehicle that we takes us into the
[1:52:12] presence of God
[1:52:13] amen
[1:52:14] God bless you tonight
[1:52:17] morning let's bow our heads
[1:52:20] how many in here
[1:52:22] look too much to those lying symptoms
[1:52:25] I'm gonna say God help me do not look at
[1:52:27] these lying symptoms but to you word
[1:52:29] father to look to you like Jonah did he
[1:52:32] looked to you that's the way we do we
[1:52:35] look to your promises not our symptoms
[1:52:36] and the way we feel or even our failed
[1:52:39] we don't look to that we look to the
[1:52:40] fear of the word father
[1:52:42] and we asked God this morning you'll
[1:52:44] bless every heart every hand Lord Jesus
[1:52:46] help us as a church not to be hooked on
[1:52:48] and not to be relying on and have
[1:52:50] our affections don't let us
[1:52:53] have our affections on it but set our
[1:52:56] affections on things above or Christ set
[1:52:58] us at the right hand of God
[1:53:01] or knowing god one of these days will
[1:53:03] change from mortality to immortality
[1:53:05] this even all of mortality is a lying
[1:53:08] Manatee for the believer because Lord
[1:53:10] will be changed into immortality we look
[1:53:12] for you to come in the Clouds Of Heaven
[1:53:14] Lord Jesus take us out of here one of
[1:53:15] these days Lord when we ask God that you
[1:53:18] draw us ever closer to you now father
[1:53:19] take these words that has been spoken
[1:53:21] help each one to remember this in the
[1:53:24] next few days Lord Jesus and help us
[1:53:25] Lord to realize
[1:53:27] that no matter what
[1:53:28] how successful we are in the world and
[1:53:31] we should be and want to be blessed in
[1:53:32] that way but we realize that's all
[1:53:35] temporal but we want to Lord seek those
[1:53:37] things as Paul said look to the things

[1:53:57] more precious to us than gold that
