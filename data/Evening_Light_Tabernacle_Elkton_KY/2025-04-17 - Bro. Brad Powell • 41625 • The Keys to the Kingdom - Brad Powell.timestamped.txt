[16:48] good to be here. Amen. Let's stand this
[16:51] evening. Let's sing. He brought me out
[16:52] of the miry
[16:55] clay. Well, my heart was
[16:59] distressed Jehovah's
[17:02] dread and low in the pit where my sins
[17:08] dragged me down. I cried to the Lord
[17:13] from the deep my
[17:16] reclaim who
[17:19] tenderly brought me out to golden
[17:24] day. Oh, he brought me out of the
[17:29] mighty
[17:31] clay and he set my feet on the rock to
[17:37] stay.
[17:39] He puts a song in my soul
[17:45] today, a song of praise.
[17:52] Hallelujah. He placed me upon the strong
[17:57] rock by his
[17:59] side. My step were
[18:02] established. And here I'll abide.
[18:07] No danger of falling while here I
[18:12] remain but
[18:15] stand until the crown I gain. For he
[18:22] brought me out of the
[18:25] mighty
[18:27] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[18:33] stay.
[18:35] He puts a song in my soul
[18:40] today, a song of praise.
[18:47] Hallelujah. He gave me a song. It was a
[18:52] new song of
[18:54] praise. My day and my night, it sweet
[18:59] notes will raise. My heart's
[19:05] overflowing. I'm happy and
[19:09] free. Praise my redeemer who has rescued
[19:15] me. For he brought me out of the mighty
[19:22] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[19:28] stay.
[19:30] He puts a song in my soul
[19:36] today. A song of praise.
[19:42] Hallelujah. I'll sing of his wonderful
[19:47] mercy to me and I'll praise him till
[19:54] men shall see. I'll sing of
[19:59] salvation at home and
[20:03] abroad until many shall hear the truth
[20:07] and trust in God. For he brought me out
[20:14] of my
[20:17] ref. He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[20:25] He puts a song in my soul
[20:30] today, a song of praise.
[20:37] Hallelujah. I'll tell of the pit with
[20:41] its gloom and despair. And I'll praise
[20:46] the dear
[20:47] father who answered my prayer. I'll sing
[20:53] my new song, the glass story of love.
[20:58] Then join in the chorus with the saints
[21:04] above singing. He brought me out of the
[21:09] myy
[21:11] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[21:17] stay.
[21:19] He puts a song in my soul
[21:24] today. A song of praise.
[21:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[21:36] let's sing. When I sing, when I see the
[21:37] blood, I'll pass over you.
[21:41] Christ our
[21:43] redeemer died on the
[21:47] cross and died for the sinner who paid
[21:52] all his
[21:54] due. Sprinkle your soul with the blood
[21:59] of the
[22:01] lamb and I will pass I will pass over
[22:06] you.
[22:09] When
[22:12] I see the
[22:15] blood. When
[22:18] I see the
[22:22] blood. When
[22:25] I see the
[22:28] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[22:33] you.
[22:37] and chiefest of
[22:39] sinners. Jesus will
[22:43] save. As he has
[22:46] promised, that will he
[22:49] do. Wash in the
[22:53] fountain. Open for
[22:56] sin and I will pass. I will pass over
[23:02] you.
[23:04] When
[23:07] I see the
[23:10] blood. When
[23:13] I see the
[23:17] blood. When
[23:20] I will see the
[23:23] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[23:28] you.
[23:31] And judgement is
[23:34] coming. All will be
[23:37] there. Each one
[23:41] receiving justly his
[23:44] due. Hide in the
[23:47] saving sin cleansing
[23:51] blood. And I will pass. I will pass over
[23:56] you.
[23:58] [Music]
[23:59] When
[24:01] I see the
[24:05] blood. When
[24:08] I see the
[24:11] blood. Oh, when
[24:14] I see the
[24:18] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[24:23] you.
[24:26] And oh great
[24:29] compassion, oh boundless
[24:32] love, oh loving kindness, so faithful
[24:38] and
[24:39] true. Find peace and
[24:42] shelter under the
[24:45] blood and I will pass. I will pass over
[24:53] you when
[24:56] I see the
[24:59] blood. Oh, when
[25:03] I see the
[25:06] blood. Oh, when
[25:09] I see the
[25:13] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[25:20] you. Amen. What a promise we have. Amen.
[25:24] You may have your seats this evening.

[25:30] that you care. Oh, I'm
[25:35] amazed. Oh, that you love me.
[25:41] I'm
[25:44] amazed at how you
[25:47] [Applause]
[25:49] care. And through your
[25:52] preious blood I found
[25:58] pardon. And my
[26:01] sins are
[26:03] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[26:10] sins are

[27:02] this evening? Amen. And we're going to
[27:03] go to prayer at this time. And Amen.
[27:06] Brother Michael John and brother Danny
[27:07] and brother Paul, if you'd just come

[27:11] offering. Amen. We have quite a number
[27:13] of prayer requests this evening. And

[27:20] test she needs tomorrow. Remember her.
[27:22] Also, sister Parish has been very sick
[27:24] this week, very weak. We want to
[27:26] continue to remember her. Also, Adriana
[27:29] has been sick every day this week. Pray
[27:31] for strength for her. the Lord would
[27:33] raise her up. Also, a prayer request for
[27:36] Sister Marlene, um Sister Leicia's mom.
[27:39] Uh she went to the emergency room today.
[27:40] She had a small obstruction on her
[27:42] intestines and um the surgeon is going
[27:46] to talk to her tomorrow um about what to
[27:48] do moving forward with that. So, we just
[27:49] pray for good results for that tomorrow.
[27:52] Amen. Brother Steve, would you take
[27:54] these requests for the Lord tonight?
[28:29] Listen to that song. Because he lives, I
[28:32] can face
[28:34] tomorrow. Because he
[28:38] [Music]
[28:40] lives, I can face tomorrow.
[28:48] Because he
[28:52] lives, all fear is
[28:58] gone because I
[29:01] know, yes, I
[29:04] know he holds my
[29:10] future and life is worth living
[29:16] just because he
[29:22] lives. Oh, because he
[29:27] lives. Oh, I can face
[29:34] tomorrow
[29:36] because he lives.
[29:41] All fear is
[29:45] gone. And because I
[29:49] know, yes, I
[29:52] know he holds my
[29:58] future. And life is worth the living
[30:04] just because he lives.
[30:10] Amen. He paid a debt he did not owe. He
[30:15] paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a
[30:23] debt. I could not pay. I
[30:28] needed
[30:30] someone to wash my sins away.
[30:38] And now I sing a brand new
[30:43] song. Amazing
[30:46] grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[30:53] debt that I could never
[30:59] pay. Oh, he paid a debt at Calvary.
[31:06] He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm
[31:13] glad that
[31:15] Jesus did all my sins
[31:22] embrace. I now can sing a brand new
[31:28] song. Amazing
[31:31] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[31:38] debt that I could never pay. One day
[31:43] he's coming
[31:44] back. And one day he's come back for me
[31:51] to live with him eternally.
[32:00] Oh, to see him on that
[32:06] day. Oh, I then will sing a brand new
[32:12] song. Amazing
[32:15] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[32:21] debt that I could never
[32:27] pay. Amen. Let's stand this evening and
[32:30] let's sing how great is our God as we
[32:32] invite brother Brad to come have his
[32:34] liberty this evening. Amen. Who's
[32:36] looking forward to the word? Amen. Sing
[32:38] how great is our God. Oh, how
[32:43] great is our
[32:46] God. Sing with me. How
[32:50] great is our God. And all will see how
[32:57] great how
[33:00] great is our
[33:04] God. How great is our God. Oh, how
[33:10] great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How
[33:16] great is our God. And all will see how
[33:23] great, how
[33:26] great is our God, name above all names.
[33:31] Oh, for he's the name
[33:36] above all names.
[33:40] He is worthy of our praise. Bless you.
[33:46] And my heart will sing. How
[33:51] great is our
[33:54] God. How great is our
[33:57] God. Oh, how
[34:00] great is our
[34:03] God. Sing with me. How
[34:07] great is our God. And all will sing, how
[34:13] great, how
[34:16] great is our
[34:21] God. Amen. Aren't you thankful for a
[34:23] great big God? He's great in all
[34:27] aspects. Great in all that that you can
[34:29] imagine.
[34:30] He's greater than great. We're going to
[34:32] talk a lot about him tonight. So, we're
[34:34] going to lift him up on high. You know,
[34:36] he comes where he's invited. And we're
[34:38] going to invite him tonight just to come
[34:40] into our presence. Let's just bow our
[34:41] heads. Heavenly Father, we come before
[34:44] you tonight with humble hearts. Humble
[34:46] as we look at the message that we've
[34:48] studied, you've laid on our hearts for
[34:50] the last several days or weeks even. And
[34:53] we just trust, Lord, that you would
[34:54] allow me to step myself out of the way
[34:56] and just that you would just step into
[34:58] the shoe leather of man tonight and use
[35:01] my voice, Lord. That you would speak to
[35:04] us tonight, Lord. That you would draw us
[35:06] close to you, Lord. That you would just
[35:08] speak the words of life to us, Lord. And
[35:10] and and Lord, that we may manifest more
[35:13] of you, Lord, and and see the the
[35:15] importance of the Holy Spirit and the
[35:17] Holy Ghost and all that you are in our
[35:20] lives, Lord. May we constantly keep you
[35:22] first in our life. We just want to give
[35:24] you honor, praise, and glory. We we just
[35:27] want to just lift those up that we had
[35:29] prayer for already in the the the for
[35:31] the prayer request and we was able to
[35:33] hear in the back and some real important
[35:35] needs and some real serious situations
[35:38] could be. But Lord, we know that you're
[35:40] a miracle working God. and we just hold
[35:42] the and lift the people up before you
[35:44] that have a need in their in their
[35:45] bodies, Lord. That you would just go
[35:47] down and physically touch them and be
[35:49] the great physician tonight. We love
[35:51] you, Lord, with all of our hearts and
[35:53] just ask that you would have
[35:54] preeminence. That all that we say and
[35:56] all that we do would be under your
[35:58] orchestration. That you would be the
[36:00] great conductor and that it would be
[36:02] pleasing to your ears and that Lord that
[36:05] it would just be uh to lift you up and
[36:08] to glorify you for what you've done in
[36:10] our life. We love you Lord and give you
[36:13] honor, praise and glory during this
[36:15] Easter season in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[36:19] Certainly good to be in the house of the
[36:20] Lord tonight and just got uh got a lot
[36:24] of things on the plate here and so we
[36:27] want to get right into the word if we
[36:28] could. And if you'd like to turn over
[36:30] into uh First Peter, we'll get started
[36:33] there in First Peter and chapter 2 and
[36:38] we'll read verses 1-6. And I've got
[36:41] another scripture we want to read that
[36:42] goes along with this, but we uh we don't
[36:44] want to keep you standing that long to
[36:46] tonight. I want to speak, it's been a
[36:48] little thought on my heart for quite a
[36:50] quite a while, couple of weeks or more.
[36:52] And and I and um we just want to speak
[36:55] on the keys of the kingdom. The keys of
[36:57] the kingdom. So second chapter of first
[37:01] Peter and verse one. Wherefore laying
[37:04] aside all
[37:06] malice and all gile and hypocrisies and
[37:10] envys and all evil speakings as newborn
[37:14] babes desire sincere milk of the word
[37:17] that they may grow by thereby. Aren't
[37:20] you thankful for that? You have a desire
[37:21] in your life for the word.
[37:24] Amen. If ye if if so be ye have tasted
[37:29] that the Lord is gracious to whom coming
[37:32] as unto a living stone disallowed indeed
[37:35] of men but chosen of God and precious.
[37:38] Ye also as lively stones are built up a
[37:41] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[37:44] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[37:47] to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also
[37:50] it is contained in the scripture,
[37:52] behold, I lay in Zion the chief
[37:55] cornerstone, elect, precious, that he
[37:58] that believeth on him shall not be
[38:01] confounded. You may have your seats
[38:03] tonight and the Lord add his blessings
[38:05] to the reading of the word. And as we
[38:07] read here and we look and we we can look
[38:09] at this and we can see that Peter here
[38:11] by his own testimony, he don't see
[38:14] himself as the rock on which the church
[38:18] was founded. You know, the Catholics,
[38:20] they try to make Peter the rock, and the
[38:22] Protestants make Jesus the rock and so
[38:25] to speak. And brother Brandham said they
[38:26] may be right on that, but I tend to lean
[38:28] a little different on their thinking.
[38:30] But Peter here doesn't say that he is
[38:32] the rock on what the church is founded.
[38:34] But he says that he's a living stone. He
[38:37] says Jesus is the cornerstone. So we
[38:40] could look at this and we could say that
[38:41] Peter was the first believer. Peter was
[38:45] the first rock of many rocks to follow.
[38:49] How many tonight can say, "I'm thankful
[38:50] I'm a rock of Jesus Christ." And so
[38:53] Peter here, we look at this and he's
[38:55] talking about coming to him and and as a
[38:57] living stone rejected by men, chosen of
[39:01] God and precious, and you as living
[39:04] stones being built up a spiritual house,
[39:08] a holy priesthood. So God is working on
[39:10] us. God is building. And we look and we
[39:12] see that God is constantly in the
[39:14] building business. God is constantly
[39:17] building and forming and he's building
[39:19] upon a foundation that he set long
[39:22] before. And I want to read this quote.
[39:24] It's one of my favorites and and I've
[39:25] read it many times, but it just stands
[39:28] out to me so so perfect in this message.
[39:31] Brother Bham says that God was unfolding
[39:33] himself now down into let us make man
[39:37] which was his son an offspring from him
[39:41] in our own image. He was a supernatural
[39:44] being and he let him have dominion over
[39:47] the cels of the field and so forth. He
[39:50] says now the man led the cattle in
[39:53] everything just like the Holy Spirit
[39:56] leads the true believer today. So God is
[40:01] in the very beginning in the building
[40:03] business and he is beginning to begin
[40:05] and to create and to lead and he wants
[40:08] people to follow. So here we are. Listen
[40:10] to what he says. He said the voice of
[40:12] man talking about the the spirit voice.
[40:15] He the voice of man could speak and call
[40:17] cattle this way. Cattle come over here.
[40:21] Wouldn't it just be nice if it was that
[40:23] simple, brother John? No. We have to get
[40:25] switches. We have to get whips. We have
[40:27] to get four-wheers. We run them over. We
[40:29] push them through gates. Anything we can
[40:31] do to get them to go where we want to
[40:33] go. But that man, he said that he could
[40:35] say, "Cattle be here. Sheep be here.
[40:40] Fish be here." Can you imagine going and
[40:43] saying, "I want this pond stocked with
[40:45] fish. Come out of this pond and go into
[40:48] this pond." This is the power that God
[40:51] had in the foundation in the very
[40:53] beginning. And he said, "God formed man
[40:56] and everything obeyed him.
[41:01] He said he formed man out of the dust of
[41:03] the earth and he put a supernatural
[41:06] spirit in. He said I can see Adam
[41:08] standing there and I can see him
[41:10] standing like a
[41:14] tree. You've heard it. How many's heard
[41:17] it? I can see Adam standing like a tree.
[41:22] God had made him. He said he was as dead
[41:24] as he could be, but his toes were like
[41:27] the roots sticking into the
[41:31] ground. God's got a
[41:34] foundation. God will always have a
[41:37] foundation, something that can be built
[41:39] upon, something that we can look at and
[41:41] say, "This is where it started. This is
[41:42] how it grows. This is how we get better
[41:44] and stronger and more into the depth of
[41:46] the word of God." And so, here is Adam
[41:49] now with this foundation, his toes
[41:51] rooted into the ground.
[41:53] You know, it wasn't Adam that
[41:57] fell. Had to throw that in there. Some
[41:59] of you looking at me kind like a cow
[42:01] looking at a new
[42:02] gate. But his toes were rooted into the
[42:05] ground with a foundation that God had
[42:07] placed him upon. And he says, God said,
[42:10] "Let there be." And he
[42:12] breathed the breath of life into him.
[42:15] And Adam jumped. And he said from right
[42:18] then he began to move on and on and on.
[42:21] That was Adam. And God was building a
[42:23] foundation. Let me tell you brothers and
[42:25] sisters, God will always have a
[42:27] foundation. What was happening? God was
[42:30] building. God was moving. God was
[42:33] creating a kingdom in his own
[42:35] likeness. The very mind of God begin to
[42:39] come into the desires of his mind were
[42:41] being manifested in the Garden of Eden
[42:44] in a man called Adam built upon a
[42:48] foundation.
[42:52] I like how God does everything on a
[42:54] foundation. You say, "I thought we was
[42:56] talking about keys." We are, but we got
[42:58] to get the
[42:59] foundation. And he's built upon a
[43:01] foundation. So, in the very beginning,
[43:03] Adam with his roots in the his toes like
[43:06] roots into the ground, standing as a
[43:08] found as a man on a
[43:10] foundation. We have a foundation that we
[43:12] stand upon. Our foundation tonight is
[43:15] the word of God. It's the infallible
[43:18] word of God that cannot be shaken. It
[43:21] cannot be destroyed. It cannot be
[43:23] defeated. That's why we sing the song on
[43:26] Christ the solid rock we stand. All
[43:30] other ground is what? Sinking
[43:35] sand. Let me read you this. I come
[43:38] across this when I was
[43:41] studying. Everything that God has is
[43:43] built on a foundation.
[43:46] Everything that Satan has, not so much.
[43:50] Anything that that that Satan has
[43:51] generally and always will fall.
[43:56] And the prophet says when he was about,
[43:58] he's telling the story when he was about
[44:00] 14 years
[44:01] old. And he's telling the story where he
[44:04] was out with one of his buddies. I think
[44:06] he was about 14. And his the gun
[44:08] misfired, his friend's gun
[44:10] misfired, shot him in both legs. He said
[44:13] it was a horrendous accident. And he
[44:16] said he laid in the hospital bed for
[44:18] days and there was nothing they could do
[44:20] but just take towels and soop up the
[44:22] blood underneath
[44:24] him. He said he thought it was going to
[44:26] be the end of him. And he said he laid
[44:29] there. He said they used so much ether
[44:31] to try to put him asleep. He said when
[44:32] he and it wouldn't work. And he said at
[44:35] that time they didn't have a lot of
[44:36] medicines. that he was gripping a hold
[44:37] of a man's arm so strong as they were
[44:40] picking and cutting with scissors the
[44:42] the flesh off of his legs with no
[44:46] anesthetics. And he said he he they had
[44:49] to pry his fingers off of that man's
[44:52] wrist. And he said and he laid there one
[44:55] night and he went
[44:56] unconscious. You know, your body can
[44:58] only tolerate so much t pain until your
[45:01] unconsciousness takes over. And he said
[45:04] he laid there unconscious and he as he
[45:06] was laying there unconscious he said a
[45:09] vision struck me. He said I was so weak
[45:11] I lost all this
[45:13] blood. I thought I was sinking into an
[45:16] endless eternity. He said many of you
[45:18] have heard me tell this before. I was
[45:20] sinking into an endless eternity. He
[45:23] said, "First I thought I was going
[45:24] through like clouds and then through
[45:27] darkness and then I was sinking on down
[45:29] and down and down and the first thing
[45:32] you know I got into the regions of the
[45:36] lost." He said, "I was there and I
[45:40] screamed. There's going to be a lot of
[45:42] screaming there."
[45:45] He said, "I screamed and I looked and
[45:48] there was everything, but there was no
[45:50] foundation to
[45:53] it." He said, "There was no foundation
[45:56] to it and I could never stop
[45:59] falling." Think about that. He said, "I
[46:02] could never stop falling." That's what
[46:04] eternity looked like. I was going to
[46:06] fall. There was no stopping
[46:09] nowhere. That's not the kind of place
[46:12] I'm looking for. I'm looking for
[46:15] something that's built upon a rock.
[46:17] Something that'll stand the test of
[46:18] time. Something that will that will last
[46:20] through the hard times, through the
[46:22] through the down times, through
[46:23] discouraging times. It's that rock
[46:26] called Jesus Christ. It's the Holy
[46:29] Spirit that gets us through these times.
[46:32] If you want to follow along in Matthew
[46:34] chapter 16, I'm going to read there for
[46:36] quite a quite a minute. Matthew chapter
[46:39] 16.
[46:46] 13-2 When Jesus came to the coast of
[46:49] Cesariah Philippi, he asked his
[46:51] disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that
[46:54] I, the son of man,
[46:57] am they said unto him, some say thou
[47:00] John the Baptist, some say Elias, and
[47:03] others Jeremas and or one of the
[47:05] prophets." So can you imagine the scene
[47:08] here is taking place as Jesus is talking
[47:10] to his disciples and he says who are
[47:12] people saying that I
[47:14] am. Well there's a lot of chatter going
[47:19] on. You know some of them think it's
[47:21] you're John the Baptist. Some think that
[47:23] you're one of the prophets. Maybe
[47:24] Jeremiah or Elias. You maybe you're one
[47:27] of these. You see what was it? They each
[47:29] one had their own ideas and their own
[47:32] way of thinking. You see how our
[47:34] stinking thinking will get in the way of
[47:36] what God's trying to do? Here was Jesus
[47:39] Christ on the scene had done miracle
[47:41] after miracle after miracle and they
[47:43] were expecting a messiah to come but yet
[47:46] they say I don't I think it's maybe this
[47:48] guy. I think it's maybe that. I think
[47:51] it's maybe this or that or telepathy or
[47:53] maybe that's
[47:54] fake. You see? And so here they are.
[47:58] Here they come to him and Jesus says,
[48:00] "But whom say ye that I
[48:04] am?" And Simon Peter, put me back on.
[48:06] There you go. Thank you, Carson. And and
[48:09] Simon Peter answered and said, "Well,
[48:12] thou art the
[48:14] Christ." Do you realize this is the
[48:17] first time that Jesus had been
[48:20] recognized? Out of all he had done, out
[48:22] of the miracles, this is the first time
[48:24] that somebody acknowledged who he really
[48:26] was. You are the Christ, the son of the
[48:29] living God. And Jesus says unto him,
[48:33] blessed art thou, Simon. Blessed art
[48:35] thou, Simon Barjonah. Why? Because flesh
[48:39] and blood didn't tell you this. But you
[48:42] received a revelation from the heavens
[48:45] that God Almighty has revealed to you
[48:48] who we are, who he is in the hour that
[48:50] he's standing. Aren't you thankful
[48:52] tonight that God Almighty has revealed
[48:55] to each and every one of us who we are
[48:58] in this hour and what Jesus is doing in
[49:01] this
[49:03] hour? Peter had gotten a revelation,
[49:06] brothers and sisters. He had gotten a
[49:08] revelation. Peter was looking through
[49:10] spiritual
[49:11] eyes. He wasn't just looking through a
[49:14] book. He wasn't just trying to put the
[49:16] pieces of the puzzle together, but he
[49:18] was looking through spiritual eyes. He
[49:20] had seen miracles taking place. He had
[49:23] seen a a revelation of what it meant to
[49:25] walk on
[49:27] water. He had seen and witnessed what it
[49:30] was like when Jesus took five loaves and
[49:33] two
[49:34] fishes. And he took it and he broke it
[49:36] and he bled looked up to the heavens and
[49:38] blessed it and fed up a multitude of
[49:41] almost 20,000
[49:43] people. You say that's a miracle. Let me
[49:46] tell you the miracle. They were
[49:48] satisfied and they took up 12 baskets of
[49:50] leftovers.
[49:54] God don't cut nothing
[49:56] short. Peter knew what it was like when
[49:59] he looked and he he witnessed the the
[50:01] boat being tossed to and fro and up and
[50:03] down and fearing for their life. And he
[50:05] knew what it was when he saw a man step
[50:07] up on the bow of the ship and said,
[50:09] "Peace, be still." And the water turned
[50:12] to glass.
[50:20] And I say also unto thee, that thou art
[50:23] Peter, and upon this rock I will build
[50:26] my church, and the gates of hell shall
[50:29] not prevail against it, and I will give
[50:31] unto thee the
[50:33] keys, the
[50:40] keys, the keys of the kingdom.
[50:50] He didn't look at him and say, "Peter,
[50:52] you're a pretty good fella, so I'm going
[50:54] to build my church upon
[50:56] you." When he looked at him, he began to
[51:00] look at him and he says, "Peter, you've
[51:03] recognized who I
[51:06] am. Do you see that?" And he tells
[51:10] Peter, "Because you have the revelation
[51:12] of who I
[51:14] am, the rock of which the church will be
[51:19] built
[51:20] upon. Whatever you bind on earth shall
[51:24] be bound in heaven. Whatever you loose
[51:25] on earth shall be loosed in heaven." You
[51:27] want to talk about a scripture that has
[51:29] confounded and confused and has been
[51:31] misrepresented and mispreached across
[51:34] the world. This is one of them.
[51:37] Some of you know what I'm talking about.
[51:38] Some of you should be saying, "Amen."
[51:43] It doesn't mean that Peter could do
[51:44] whatever he wanted to do. It doesn't
[51:47] mean that whatever Peter said went. It
[51:50] doesn't mean that whatever rules he made
[51:52] or said that because that's what binding
[51:54] and loosening is. The the Pharisees
[51:56] would say, "Oh, we'll bind you with this
[51:58] or we'll loose you of that." One of the
[52:00] examples I seen, and I didn't put it in
[52:02] my notes, but I'll share it with you.
[52:03] One of the examples I seen is if a dog
[52:05] dies in your house, your house is
[52:07] filthy. You're bound by that. So then
[52:11] the priest would say, if the dog dies
[52:13] outside, your house is clean. You're
[52:16] loosed under those principles. But if
[52:19] the dog dies on the porch and he's
[52:20] facing the
[52:22] house, now what do we
[52:25] do? You see what I'm saying? This is
[52:28] creeds and traditions. That's not the
[52:30] way Jesus works. But what the scripture
[52:33] is telling us is that Peter, because you
[52:35] have had a real revelation from God and
[52:38] you understand the spirit moving amongst
[52:40] us when I g you the keys of the kingdom
[52:45] which is the Holy Spirit
[52:49] and you take the Holy Spirit, the
[52:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit and you
[52:52] preach and you preach the word of God
[52:55] and you preach it in its entirety and
[52:57] you preach it truth just like the
[52:59] preachers, the ministers, the Holy Ghost
[53:01] men of God today and our prophet did.
[53:03] They will be loosed or bound based upon
[53:07] the words you preach.
[53:12] That's the that's that's where we're at.
[53:14] It doesn't mean that I can say, "Well,
[53:15] Uncle Joe uh Uncle Uncle Bobby Joe was a
[53:18] good guy, so I'm going to put him in
[53:21] heaven." Or, "Man, I sure don't like
[53:24] him. You know, he run over my dog one
[53:26] time. I about about kill my dog. He's
[53:28] out."
[53:31] Uh-uh. It don't work that way. But he's
[53:34] telling him a and as this goes on, Jesus
[53:36] then takes charge and he tells his
[53:38] disciples, "Don't tell anybody who I am.
[53:42] Don't tell anybody who I am." But it
[53:44] says, "From that time forth, Jesus begin
[53:47] to show unto his disciples how that he
[53:49] must go into Jerusalem and suffer the
[53:51] things from the chief priests and the
[53:54] scribes, how he's going to have to be
[53:56] killed, but then he's going to raise
[53:58] again on the third day.
[54:00] Now you watch this patriarch Peter
[54:03] here. Peter looks at him and took him
[54:06] and he rebuked him and said, "Be it far
[54:08] from thee, Lord. This shall be unto
[54:11] thee. This shall not be unto
[54:16] thee." And what did Jesus
[54:19] did? He he turned around as as he could
[54:22] and looked at Peter and he said, "Peter,
[54:25] get thee behind me, Satan.
[54:28] You mean this is the guy who just had
[54:31] extreme spiritual revelation?
[54:36] Do you see why you can't build on the
[54:38] foundation like that?
[54:40] Do you see how the church world got it
[54:42] wrong?
[54:44] But here and now Peter, Jesus looks at
[54:45] him and says, "Get thee behind me,
[54:47] Satan. Thou are an offense to me. For
[54:49] thou savorest not the things of God, but
[54:51] the things of men." So now, oh, Peter's
[54:53] done got in the flesh.
[54:57] What happened to his spiritual eyes?
[54:59] What happens sometimes to our spiritual
[55:02] eyes? Sometimes we can be so spiritual,
[55:05] but then the next little thing just sets
[55:06] us off and puts us over the
[55:10] edge. Do you see why it's important that
[55:13] we have the
[55:15] keys to the
[55:19] kingdom? We think about the keys of the
[55:22] kingdom and we look and we think of a
[55:23] key. We look at it and we think this is
[55:25] an instrument. This is a tool that is
[55:28] used to open a
[55:29] lock. And we think about that and and if
[55:32] something is locked up, it must have
[55:34] great value. Wouldn't you think, Paul?
[55:36] If you if you take the time to lock
[55:38] something up, it must mean something to
[55:39] you. It must be significant. It must it
[55:42] must have a great value or it's an item
[55:44] of importance in the eyes of the
[55:46] beholder of the
[55:48] key. And Jesus is talking about giving
[55:51] Peter the keys.
[55:54] to the
[55:55] kingdom. We lock up our
[55:59] houses. We put our valuable documents in
[56:02] a lock
[56:04] box. We put our money, our jewelry, our
[56:07] guns in a locked
[56:11] safe. And we only give a copy of that
[56:13] key to the people we trust the most.
[56:18] You know, I've had people ask, "I need
[56:20] to get in your house. What's What's a
[56:22] combination get in your house? Uh, I
[56:24] don't know. I can't remember. I just
[56:26] went
[56:30] blank. Selective
[56:34] memory. I'm just
[56:36] kidding. But, you know, sometimes people
[56:39] want these
[56:41] things. Who wouldn't want the keys to
[56:44] the kingdom?
[56:46] Who would not want to know everything
[56:48] that is the hidden treasures that Jesus
[56:51] Christ himself has hidden back away into
[56:54] the
[56:55] heavens? This key, brothers and
[56:59] sisters, it has to be put into the hands
[57:02] of somebody that God can trust.
[57:09] You and I as individuals, as
[57:12] believers, God has to be able to trust
[57:15] you. God has to be able to trust me.
[57:18] When God hands the the the written word
[57:21] to any minister, any man of God, he has
[57:23] to be able to trust that he will take
[57:25] that word and he will diligently go
[57:27] through it and he will seek seek exactly
[57:29] the way the spirit wants to move.
[57:33] When God calls a song leader,
[57:37] Don't think I don't take note every time
[57:39] songs are sang before I come out. The
[57:42] first song Brother Josh sang tonight was
[57:44] about a
[57:46] rock. You probably didn't pick up on
[57:49] that, but I
[57:51] did because I want to make sure that I'm
[57:54] in tune and I'm in channel with what the
[57:56] what the Lord is trying to move. But
[57:59] here this key Jesus is telling
[58:01] Peter, you've got I've got something.
[58:04] I'm going to give you the keys of the
[58:05] kingdom. And I've got something that is
[58:07] of great value locked away here. And I'm
[58:10] going to put this keys and and because I
[58:12] trust you, Peter, because I trust you
[58:15] more than anybody else. You see, Jesus
[58:17] saw something special in the life of
[58:19] Peter. He saw something that the other
[58:21] disciples didn't have at that time.
[58:24] Because when he asked, "Who do you say
[58:25] that I am?" It was who spoke up. Peter
[58:28] spoke up and said, "You are the Christ,
[58:31] the son of the God, the son of the
[58:32] living God. You're Jesus Christ. There's
[58:34] no doubt in my mind.
[58:39] But as much as Jesus loved Peter and
[58:41] spoke highly of Peter, when Jesus spoke
[58:44] of the rock, he wasn't referring to
[58:47] Peter as the
[58:49] foundation. He wasn't looking as Peter
[58:51] as the foundation, but he said, "Peter,
[58:54] I I I this has been revealed to you that
[58:57] I am the rock of revelation." That's
[59:00] right. It was the revelation of Jesus
[59:03] Christ that Peter had in his
[59:07] mind. And I will build my church and the
[59:10] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[59:12] it. You know, if people could only
[59:15] realize who Jesus Christ is
[59:20] tonight, the gates of hell can't prevail
[59:22] against anything in your life.
[59:29] But it takes recognizing who Jesus is.
[59:32] You know, Peter was a little bit shaky.
[59:34] He couldn't have been the foundation
[59:35] because he was up and down. He was kind
[59:37] of in and out. I mean, wasn't he the one
[59:39] that cut off the guard's ear right
[59:40] before Jesus got taken away to the
[59:42] garden? I don't believe that was the key
[59:44] that done that. I don't believe that was
[59:46] the key to the
[59:50] kingdom. Listen to what the prophet
[59:53] says. And upon this rock I'll build my
[59:55] church. the gates of hell cannot prevail
[59:57] against it. He says it's the divine
[1:00:01] revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Upon
[1:00:04] that solid rock, Christ builds his
[1:00:06] church and the gates of hell will never
[1:00:09] prevail against it. Listen now. when
[1:00:13] that direct revelation comes from heaven
[1:00:16] that Christ is your
[1:00:18] emancipator that when he has become your
[1:00:21] savior that when he's become your
[1:00:23] deliverer
[1:00:25] can we add to it I I I looked up I want
[1:00:27] to know what all I could find on Jesus
[1:00:29] Christ when he becomes your advocate
[1:00:31] when he becomes your almighty the alpha
[1:00:34] the omega the amen the arm of the lord
[1:00:36] the author and finisher of our faith how
[1:00:39] many more do you
[1:00:41] want. He's the beloved son, the blessed
[1:00:44] and the only. Uh the the branch, the
[1:00:47] bread of life, the captain of salvation,
[1:00:48] the chief shepherd, the cornerstone, the
[1:00:50] counselor, the creator, the deliverer,
[1:00:52] and I'm skipping over about half of
[1:00:54] them. The everlasting father, the
[1:00:56] faithful witness, the first begotten,
[1:00:58] the forerunner, the glory of the Lord,
[1:00:59] the good shepherd, the governor, the
[1:01:01] great high priest.
[1:01:03] This is Jesus. This is the keys. These
[1:01:05] are the keys that we have. These are the
[1:01:08] keys that he holds and he wants to give
[1:01:09] to us. He wants to be all of this and
[1:01:13] more to us this hour.
[1:01:16] He's the holy one, the horn of
[1:01:18] salvation. The I am. Who do you say I
[1:01:21] am? I am. Just tell him I am coming.
[1:01:24] Come on, Moses. Who is who you sending
[1:01:26] you? The I am is sending me. Who do you
[1:01:29] stand for tonight? The I am. How do you
[1:01:33] How do you know you're healed? Because
[1:01:34] the I am said I was. How do you know
[1:01:37] you're delivered? Because the I am said
[1:01:39] I was. How do you know you're set free?
[1:01:42] Because the emancipator set me free.
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:45] [Applause]
[1:01:50] He said, "But when he becomes your
[1:01:51] deliverer and that is anchored in your
[1:01:53] heart, all of the devils and torment
[1:01:56] will never make you deny it." That's
[1:02:00] right.
[1:02:02] People can pull your eye teeth out, but
[1:02:04] you will not deny Jesus Christ. When you
[1:02:07] come face to face and eye to eye and you
[1:02:09] know him as your savior and you know him
[1:02:11] as the rock upon what you stand upon,
[1:02:15] nothing can ever make you turn from it.
[1:02:17] Nothing can ever make you deny it.
[1:02:20] That's the key. Jesus is the key. If
[1:02:23] Jesus is all of that and more, what
[1:02:26] holds us back?
[1:02:33] What holds us
[1:02:36] back? You want to know what the prophet
[1:02:39] said? He said, "What holds us back is we
[1:02:42] got too our minds on too many things in
[1:02:44] the
[1:02:46] world." We wasn't thinking about
[1:02:48] emancipator and deliverer and son of God
[1:02:51] and first and last and alpha omega, the
[1:02:53] counselor, the prince of peace, the king
[1:02:55] of kings, lord of lords. We're thinking
[1:02:57] about work.
[1:02:59] He says, "We're thinking about the
[1:03:00] things of life." He says, "We we
[1:03:02] thinking about the the if we could just
[1:03:04] throw these things out of our mind, but
[1:03:05] we're thinking about what we'll do next
[1:03:07] week. Will I have a job tomorrow? Will
[1:03:09] this be or that be?" And he said, "Those
[1:03:11] things are in the hands of God anyway.
[1:03:12] Think on Christ."
[1:03:15] Listen to what he says. You want to know
[1:03:16] why it's important that our minds are on
[1:03:18] Christ? He said, "If we could throw the
[1:03:19] things of the world off our mind and
[1:03:21] think on Christ and his soon coming,
[1:03:24] there'd be more revelations and power in
[1:03:28] the church." How many wants to see a
[1:03:31] power working wonder God in our church?
[1:03:35] That's our desire. We want to see God in
[1:03:37] action and God moving amongst us. So get
[1:03:40] the things of the world off our mind.
[1:03:44] And I got to thinking about this. I
[1:03:45] thought, how could I apply this in the
[1:03:47] scripture? And I got to thinking about
[1:03:48] blind
[1:03:51] Barameus. I felt for that
[1:03:54] guy for
[1:03:56] years. What was it? 40
[1:03:59] years. He sits at the gate blind, poor,
[1:04:04] and afflicted. This man is sitting there
[1:04:06] with no hope. But you know what the
[1:04:09] prophet said about him? Listen to this.
[1:04:10] He said, "But he was thinking the right
[1:04:12] kind of thoughts."
[1:04:16] In our minds, we're thinking he's
[1:04:18] thinking poor pitiful me.
[1:04:21] No, that's not what the prophet said. He
[1:04:23] said he was thinking the right kind of
[1:04:26] thoughts. He said he was thinking the
[1:04:29] right kind of thoughts. And by thinking
[1:04:31] those, listen, when he's thinking the
[1:04:34] thoughts of Jesus, he's then holding a
[1:04:36] key.
[1:04:39] He's holding a key that opens a door
[1:04:40] somewhere.
[1:04:42] He's just waiting for the door to reveal
[1:04:44] itself.
[1:04:46] and he's thinking on these thoughts and
[1:04:48] he's holding this key and just about the
[1:04:50] time he's thinking these thoughts,
[1:04:51] little children begin to run by and he
[1:04:54] said the children are screaming and
[1:04:55] they're making noise and people are
[1:04:57] hollering. They're saying hosana. And
[1:05:00] others are hollering and mocking Jesus
[1:05:02] and they're saying you holy roller, you
[1:05:04] raised Lazarus from the dead. We've got
[1:05:07] a whole graveyard full. Why don't you
[1:05:08] raise all of them? Can you imagine?
[1:05:12] Can you imagine Jesus Christ walking
[1:05:14] through the streets today and people
[1:05:16] saying that to him? They're doing it.
[1:05:19] They're doing it in our schools. They're
[1:05:20] doing it in our government. They're
[1:05:22] doing it all around our our jobs.
[1:05:24] They're making a mockery of Jesus
[1:05:26] Christ. But we hold the key.
[1:05:29] Amen.
[1:05:33] An old blind Barameus says, "Who is that
[1:05:37] passing
[1:05:40] by?" Can you imagine him sitting there
[1:05:42] blind and hearing the noise and the
[1:05:44] chaos? Just shut your eyes and imagine
[1:05:46] as you hear the screams of hosana and
[1:05:48] all this actions taking place and kids
[1:05:50] and they're running about. They say,
[1:05:51] "Oh, he's the he says he's the he's the
[1:05:53] the the deliverer. He's the healer."
[1:05:57] who is passing by? Somebody please tell
[1:05:59] me who's passing
[1:06:05] by? And the prophet said he couldn't get
[1:06:07] any consideration from
[1:06:09] nobody. And he's just wondering, please
[1:06:12] somebody tell me, somebody help me, tell
[1:06:14] me who's passing by. And this goes on
[1:06:18] and on. He said, until finally a kind
[1:06:20] little lady stepped down and said,
[1:06:22] sir, have you ever heard of Jesus of
[1:06:25] Nazareth?
[1:06:29] Thank God for a kind little
[1:06:32] lady. Sir, have you ever heard of Jesus
[1:06:34] of Nazareth? And Vine Bara said, "No,
[1:06:36] who is Jesus of Nazareth?" And she said,
[1:06:40] "He's that Galilean prophet and he does
[1:06:43] great miracles and signs. He could be
[1:06:47] the
[1:06:50] Messiah." Some people thinks he
[1:06:53] is. and blind Barnameus the prophet
[1:06:56] remember he said he was thinking the
[1:06:58] right kind of
[1:06:59] thoughts and he's sitting there and in
[1:07:02] his mind
[1:07:04] scriptures begin to come back from his
[1:07:06] childhood and as he's thinking on these
[1:07:09] thoughts in his mind his heart goes back
[1:07:12] to when he was a little
[1:07:13] boy and he goes back and it it seemed
[1:07:16] that those scriptures begin to press
[1:07:18] right up against him and the prophet
[1:07:21] said when a man's in
[1:07:23] need And if you feel you're in need of
[1:07:26] Christ tonight,
[1:07:29] everything you've ever heard about him
[1:07:31] will come right forward.
[1:07:34] Have you ever noticed that? That if you
[1:07:37] go into you have something in your life
[1:07:38] that's going on, something that's out of
[1:07:40] cater or you you feel like you need you
[1:07:42] need God and you just get alone. You
[1:07:43] begin to dwell and you begin to think on
[1:07:45] Christ and little by little things begin
[1:07:47] to unfold right before your eyes and he
[1:07:50] presents himself as whatever the need is
[1:07:52] that you have in that hour. God, you may
[1:07:56] not needed an extra dollar for 40
[1:07:59] years and you're behind on a bill and
[1:08:01] you'll find a $100 bill laying in the
[1:08:03] yard.
[1:08:07] thinking the right kind of thoughts and
[1:08:10] Barnameus is thinking all the time on
[1:08:12] those teachings and he's thinking
[1:08:14] Jehovah a mighty deliverer and he said
[1:08:17] it sprung to him and what was it he said
[1:08:20] he had a need and he rose to his
[1:08:23] feet and he rose to his feet and he
[1:08:25] screamed oh Jesus thou son of David have
[1:08:28] mercy on
[1:08:30] me and he screamed no doubt in the
[1:08:33] middle of as loud as he stood in the
[1:08:35] middle of the streets and the prophet
[1:08:38] said physically there was no way for
[1:08:41] Jesus to hear him.
[1:08:43] 40 to 50 yards away and he's blind
[1:08:47] screaming into the
[1:08:49] city. Jesus, thy son of David, have
[1:08:52] mercy on me. I can't
[1:08:56] see to fall on deaf
[1:09:04] ears and he's
[1:09:08] yelling and people start throwing
[1:09:10] overright fruit at
[1:09:14] him, but he's thinking the right kind of
[1:09:17] thoughts and they begin to throw rotten
[1:09:20] fruit at him and and they begin to to
[1:09:22] physically Ally yell back at him. Shut
[1:09:24] up. Shut up. Who what are you doing? Who
[1:09:26] do you think you are? Keep quiet. You're
[1:09:28] getting everybody
[1:09:30] excited. Keep still. Ain't that what the
[1:09:33] devil wants you to do? When you have a
[1:09:35] need in your life and you're crying out
[1:09:37] to God and the devil tells you, "Shut
[1:09:38] up. He don't hear you anyway."
[1:09:44] But that's not what the prophet said.
[1:09:46] You see, brothers and sisters, he leaned
[1:09:48] back on his childhood teaching and he
[1:09:50] began to thank Jehovah. Jehovah is a
[1:09:53] deliverer. And if this person is the
[1:09:56] Messiah, he's the right person that can
[1:09:58] help me. He had a key, brothers and
[1:10:00] sisters. And he had that key. And when
[1:10:02] he was fixing to stick that key in the
[1:10:03] door and turn the key because he had the
[1:10:06] key that could open blinded eyes.
[1:10:10] All along he had everything he needed.
[1:10:12] He just needed to find the door.
[1:10:14] Yeahise.
[1:10:16] Everything we have need of in life, God
[1:10:18] has already placed on the inside of us.
[1:10:21] We just need the revealed door of the
[1:10:23] hour to turn the key and open the
[1:10:30] door.
[1:10:32] Jesus, he says, listen, Jesus, if he is
[1:10:35] the son of God, has raised from the
[1:10:37] dead, he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:10:38] and forever. And we've got a right to
[1:10:41] ask for
[1:10:42] help. That whatsoever thing you desire,
[1:10:45] if you pray, believe and you receive it
[1:10:47] and you shall have it. We've got a right
[1:10:49] to ask for it. That's the teachings of
[1:10:52] the Bible. We have a right to
[1:10:55] it. Blind Barnameus is
[1:11:00] screaming. And Jesus prophet says with
[1:11:03] his head back
[1:11:05] walking. He's walking down the streets.
[1:11:09] The priests are screaming at him.
[1:11:10] They're making fun of him. People are
[1:11:12] crying
[1:11:13] hosana as the whole burdens of the world
[1:11:18] are upon his
[1:11:20] shoulders. Think about this. The burdens
[1:11:24] of the entire
[1:11:28] world are dependent upon Jesus at this
[1:11:35] hour. You want to you ever had a burden?
[1:11:38] You get in a zone and you're just
[1:11:40] thinking all you can think and and
[1:11:42] you're zoned out on everything else
[1:11:43] around you and you're thinking about
[1:11:45] that one
[1:11:46] obstacle. You're thinking about that one
[1:11:48] challenge that lays ahead. You're
[1:11:49] thinking about that surgery that's
[1:11:51] coming up. You're thinking about that
[1:11:52] lost loved one. You're thinking about
[1:11:54] that child that's gone astray. And you
[1:11:55] got a tunnel
[1:11:58] vision. Here is Jesus got the weight of
[1:12:02] the world on his shoulders and he's now
[1:12:04] in tunnel vision. But
[1:12:06] Barnameus has a sincere heart.
[1:12:10] He's thinking on the thoughts of Jesus.
[1:12:13] He had the same thing that the woman who
[1:12:16] touched his garment had.
[1:12:18] You know, she went to doctors for years,
[1:12:20] spent every dime that she had till she
[1:12:22] had no more to spend
[1:12:24] with a blood issue that would not stop.
[1:12:29] But it was one touch of the garment.
[1:12:32] It was one touch. Why? Because she had
[1:12:34] the sincere heart. the same heart that
[1:12:36] Barnameus had.
[1:12:38] And here is Barnameus crying out to
[1:12:41] Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:12:43] him. God, don't let him pass me
[1:12:47] by. And when he said, God, don't let him
[1:12:50] pass me by, Jesus stops in his
[1:12:54] tracks. Amongst a multitude of people
[1:12:57] screaming and hollering and mocking and
[1:13:00] making a debauchery of
[1:13:03] him. His voice, the prophet said, never
[1:13:06] touched
[1:13:07] him, but his faith touched him. That's
[1:13:10] the kind of faith I want in my life.
[1:13:12] That's the kind of faith I want when I
[1:13:14] walk and I have a need in my life. I'm
[1:13:16] going to say, I'm going to believe for
[1:13:17] it until I stop Jesus in his tracks.
[1:13:24] That's the kind of touch that Jesus
[1:13:26] wants to feel from his
[1:13:28] church. You see, a lot of times we
[1:13:30] petition to
[1:13:33] Jesus. Lord, I need I need I I I I if
[1:13:36] you could I I would like I
[1:13:39] need. We
[1:13:42] petition. But the kind of touch that
[1:13:44] Jesus is looking for is not our voice.
[1:13:48] He said, "But it's our faith.
[1:13:51] God, I don't know what's going to
[1:13:53] happen, but I'm
[1:13:55] believing. And I'm going to believe for
[1:13:57] every every single day, for every day I
[1:14:00] walk, I'm going to believe that you're
[1:14:02] going to move on the scene in this
[1:14:05] situation. I've seen it happen over and
[1:14:07] over and over. I've seen it in this
[1:14:08] church. I've seen it in
[1:14:11] others. Just a believing heart trusting.
[1:14:15] You know, God can't give a key to
[1:14:17] somebody he don't trust.
[1:14:21] You got to trust and believe and follow
[1:14:25] what God has in his life. Thinking back
[1:14:28] about Peter here, we look Yeah. Let's go
[1:14:31] back to Peter here. When Jesus was uh
[1:14:34] sat there and he's speaking to to Peter,
[1:14:36] what was it that Jesus was telling
[1:14:39] Peter about the
[1:14:41] rock? He said, "Peter, I'm going to give
[1:14:43] you more
[1:14:45] revelation. And when you get that, I'm
[1:14:47] going to give you more
[1:14:48] revelation. And when you get that, I'm
[1:14:50] going to give you more revelation and
[1:14:52] more revelation and more revelation in
[1:14:54] the days to come. Because Jesus then
[1:14:57] began to open up himself to his
[1:14:59] disciples. And he began to tell the
[1:15:01] disciples of what was fixing to happen.
[1:15:04] That he was on a mission and that the
[1:15:06] world depended on
[1:15:08] him. We think we got
[1:15:11] troubles. We think we got burdens.
[1:15:16] The entire fate of
[1:15:21] mankind rested.
[1:15:26] All of your
[1:15:28] faults, all of my
[1:15:30] faults, all the evil things I've ever
[1:15:32] thought, said, or
[1:15:34] done, and you
[1:15:37] and the
[1:15:38] neighbor and thousands and millions and
[1:15:40] billions of others who's done, gone
[1:15:43] on, and are to
[1:15:45] come rested on the fate and the of the
[1:15:49] weight of Jesus's shoulders. So brothers
[1:15:52] and sisters, if we could get a full
[1:15:53] revelation of who we are and how
[1:15:55] important we are to Jesus
[1:15:59] Christ, we hold in our
[1:16:02] hands the
[1:16:04] key that unlocks all the treasures of
[1:16:07] the kingdom of God. You think about it.
[1:16:11] Jesus is the key that unlocks
[1:16:12] redemption. Jesus is the key that
[1:16:14] unlocks drug addiction,
[1:16:16] alcoholism. He unlocks pornography. He
[1:16:19] unlocks depression. He unlocks
[1:16:21] brokenheartedness. He unlocks uh
[1:16:23] shackles of sin and doubt and fear and
[1:16:26] anxieties.
[1:16:29] That's what the keys of the kingdom
[1:16:32] does. Amen.
[1:16:35] We don't need to take it for granted. We
[1:16:37] don't need to take it lightly because
[1:16:38] brothers and sisters, we don't have to
[1:16:40] be bound by the shackles of the devil in
[1:16:42] this hour. Do you realize that? Because
[1:16:45] we have the revelation of who Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ is in this hour. We have the
[1:16:49] revealed word of our day.
[1:16:55] We're We're years down the road, but
[1:16:58] it's still the truth.
[1:17:00] I listened to the tape the other day
[1:17:02] from 50, 57,
[1:17:04] 63, but it's still the truth.
[1:17:10] You say, "Well, people don't recognize
[1:17:12] it." It's still the truth. I seen where
[1:17:14] brother Josiah Scott, his family, I
[1:17:17] think went to Washington
[1:17:19] DC, they went to the Library of
[1:17:21] Congress. You know what they
[1:17:23] found? Still
[1:17:27] there. It's truth.
[1:17:30] Still there.
[1:17:32] The original picture in the Library of
[1:17:35] Congress in Washington
[1:17:39] DC. We've got a key.
[1:17:42] We have a revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:17:44] in this hour. And with Christ, all
[1:17:46] things are possible. And Jesus has now
[1:17:49] come down in this hour and he's handed
[1:17:51] over the keys. That's right. This is
[1:17:53] your key. This is your
[1:17:58] key. You say, "I need a quote." I got
[1:18:04] one. Think it I'll be honest. I think
[1:18:06] it's the first time I've ever read this
[1:18:08] in my life since I've been reading this
[1:18:11] message from 16, 17 years old. And I say
[1:18:14] unto thee, thou art Peter, little rock.
[1:18:17] I'm the great rock. I'm the cornerstone.
[1:18:21] But you're the little rock that's placed
[1:18:22] upon me. The builders chose you. You
[1:18:26] never chose yourself. The builders chose
[1:18:28] you. Aren't you thankful that you were
[1:18:31] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:18:33] world?
[1:18:34] Listen to what he
[1:18:36] says. The angels of God one night were
[1:18:40] working in a
[1:18:41] quarry. Have you ever heard this? Raise
[1:18:44] your hand. Oh, good. We all going to
[1:18:46] learn a little
[1:18:47] something. The angels of God one night
[1:18:50] were working in a quarry and they called
[1:18:53] you out and you submitted yourself to me
[1:18:57] and I cut you in my own fashion.
[1:19:03] I made you the way that I wanted
[1:19:06] you. I done the sawing. You just stood
[1:19:10] still. Wouldn't it be nice if we just
[1:19:12] stand still and let God do the
[1:19:14] work? And I've placed you now as a
[1:19:17] little stone to fit in with some other
[1:19:19] stones to lead that stone. And this
[1:19:22] stone leads that stone and that stone.
[1:19:25] And the seammen of love is bringing you
[1:19:29] together, making
[1:19:32] my
[1:19:35] foundation, which I am, to be fitted
[1:19:38] together with every stone that professes
[1:19:41] my name and receives this
[1:19:44] revelation. And may I take this moment
[1:19:47] to say this, my friend, that the entire
[1:19:49] church of the living God is built
[1:19:51] solemnly upon the spiritual revelation
[1:19:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ. No matter how
[1:19:56] educated you are, how smart you are, how
[1:20:00] how smart you may be, or how well you
[1:20:02] think you know the Bible, Satan knows it
[1:20:04] a lot better than you do.
[1:20:09] But only through revelation that God
[1:20:11] gives you through the Holy Spirit, your
[1:20:13] tutor revealed to you. He saves you by
[1:20:16] his
[1:20:16] grace. Listen to
[1:20:19] this. Though it would be against it, yet
[1:20:21] it cannot prevail. Talking about the
[1:20:23] gates of hell. For when the enemy comes
[1:20:25] in like a flood, the spirit of God will
[1:20:28] raise a standard against it every time.
[1:20:34] God honed you. Sent angels down and
[1:20:37] chose you and honed you out of the stone
[1:20:39] this morning, this evening. and he cut
[1:20:43] away the things he didn't like. He said,
[1:20:45] "I made you what I wanted you to be. I
[1:20:49] don't want to be nothing in my life that
[1:20:50] God don't want me to be." I say, "God,
[1:20:53] keep cutting on me. Keep honing on me.
[1:20:55] Keep sawing on me. Get the things out of
[1:20:57] my life that are holding me
[1:21:02] back." You see, a key does you no good
[1:21:04] if you don't use
[1:21:06] it or if you use it in the wrong lock.
[1:21:08] You ever stuck a key in there, you think
[1:21:10] it's the right key and you stick it in
[1:21:11] there and it it won't work and you look
[1:21:13] at it and you it's rough and you spit on
[1:21:15] it and Well, I
[1:21:19] do. I think it's it needs some
[1:21:21] lubrication or something, you know, and
[1:21:24] it but if you put the key in the wrong
[1:21:28] lock, you can turn it all you want. And
[1:21:32] you know that's what a lot of people I
[1:21:33] got to thinking that's what a lot of
[1:21:34] people do around the word around church
[1:21:37] around
[1:21:40] message. They have a
[1:21:42] key. They've been in church their whole
[1:21:45] life. They've heard the message of the
[1:21:48] hour. They know the revealed
[1:21:51] word. But when it comes to them wanting
[1:21:54] deliverance, they use a key of career.
[1:22:00] They walk up to the door of deliverance.
[1:22:02] They walk up to the door of healing and
[1:22:04] they think hobbies. They have a hobby
[1:22:07] key. I'm going to do what I want to do
[1:22:09] on this day. I'm going to do what I want
[1:22:10] to do Sunday. I'm not going to church.
[1:22:11] I'm going to do what I want to do. They
[1:22:13] want all of the benefits, but they're
[1:22:15] putting the key in the wrong doors.
[1:22:24] Yeah. Let that one sink in.
[1:22:28] They want their kids saved and
[1:22:30] sanctified, filled with the Holy
[1:22:33] Ghost. But career is more important.
[1:22:38] Huh?
[1:22:42] If I were to set a locked box in front
[1:22:45] of you tonight, Michael John, last week
[1:22:48] he was a
[1:22:49] quarterback. Today we're going to set a
[1:22:51] locked box in front of you. Just say
[1:22:53] right there. Now you say right there.
[1:22:55] But if I set a lock box in front of you
[1:22:57] and I said inside that lock box is a,000
[1:23:01] pounds of solid gold bars.
[1:23:07] You what? Say it. I want it. You would
[1:23:11] want it. Well, I got a key.
[1:23:16] You'd want the key from me? You mean you
[1:23:18] wouldn't stick that key in your pocket?
[1:23:23] You wouldn't, if I handed you this key,
[1:23:24] you wouldn't just throw that key over in
[1:23:26] the into the brush or throw it into the
[1:23:28] trash.
[1:23:32] You'd be trying everything you could to
[1:23:34] get that key in there, wouldn't you?
[1:23:35] You'd be digging. You'd be clawing. Let
[1:23:36] me see what's on the inside. But why do
[1:23:38] people do that with God?
[1:23:43] He's given us the key to the treasures
[1:23:45] of the kingdom of heaven, but yet we
[1:23:47] don't use the key. We'll wait to another
[1:23:49] day.
[1:23:51] God's I think God was calling at me, but
[1:23:54] maybe he will next
[1:23:56] week. I think God was want to deliver
[1:23:58] somebody, but nobody
[1:24:03] moved. Let me tell you what you'd do,
[1:24:05] Michael John. If I told you there was a
[1:24:07] box there with a,000 pounds of gold and
[1:24:09] I didn't have a key, you'd gnaw the lock
[1:24:10] off of it.
[1:24:19] But we stand nonchalant in front of God
[1:24:22] and let those things stand between us
[1:24:24] and the promises of
[1:24:29] God. He said, "So we hold the key, the
[1:24:32] faith, the word, every bit of faith that
[1:24:34] you believe. Don't doubt one speck. You
[1:24:37] can unlock every door that stands
[1:24:39] between you and the blessings that God
[1:24:42] has for you.
[1:24:49] We move
[1:24:55] on. Some say thou are John the Baptist.
[1:24:58] Some say you're Elijah. Some say you're
[1:25:00] the prophet. But who do you say I am?
[1:25:04] And Peter says, "Thou art Christ, the
[1:25:06] son of the living God."
[1:25:09] and upon this rock, this spiritual
[1:25:12] revelation of the word, I'll build my
[1:25:13] church, and the gates of hell will not
[1:25:15] prevail against it. And I'll give you
[1:25:17] the keys. And he says, what? He said,
[1:25:20] the keys of the kingdom of heaven. What
[1:25:22] is the kingdom of
[1:25:26] heaven? The Holy
[1:25:29] Spirit. That's what he says. He says
[1:25:32] it's the Holy Spirit. The Bible said the
[1:25:34] kingdom is within you. And he says that
[1:25:38] they go there and they're talking about
[1:25:39] the days of Pentecost on the day of
[1:25:41] Pentecost. And he says, "Peter, I'm
[1:25:42] going to give you the keys of the
[1:25:44] kingdom." In other words, I'm going to
[1:25:46] give you, Peter, the gift of the Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost, the most prized possession any
[1:25:51] Christian could
[1:25:53] have because the Holy Ghost leads you.
[1:25:56] The Holy Ghost guides you. The Holy
[1:25:57] Ghost delivers you. The Holy Ghost frees
[1:26:00] you from sin.
[1:26:02] The Holy Ghost makes you do what you're
[1:26:04] supposed to do and act the way you're
[1:26:06] supposed to act. It makes you love
[1:26:08] people the way you're supposed to love
[1:26:10] people. It makes you treat people the
[1:26:12] way you're supposed to treat people.
[1:26:15] And he's telling Peter, I'm going to
[1:26:17] give you the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:26:18] the prophet said here was Peter, an
[1:26:20] uneducated man that couldn't even sign
[1:26:23] his own name. And he's in one place he
[1:26:26] said he wouldn't know his name signed if
[1:26:28] you showed it to him.
[1:26:30] And he said he stood up on a
[1:26:32] soapbox and he began to preach under the
[1:26:35] anointing of the Holy Ghost and he began
[1:26:37] to tell the people what was going to
[1:26:39] happen in the days of Jerusalem. And and
[1:26:41] he began to tell them these men are not
[1:26:43] drunk like you think they are.
[1:26:47] But they've got something that God gave
[1:26:48] them. He gave them a key. He gave them
[1:26:50] the Holy Ghost. He said he would pour
[1:26:52] out his spirit on all flesh.
[1:26:55] And he began to tell them. And the Bible
[1:26:57] says that they were pricricked in their
[1:26:58] hearts and they asked him and said, "Man
[1:27:01] and brethren, what can we do to be
[1:27:03] saved?"
[1:27:05] Think about this. What can we do to be
[1:27:06] saved? This is a question of a door that
[1:27:08] had never been walked through.
[1:27:13] This is a door that man had never
[1:27:15] opened. It had been locked for years and
[1:27:17] years and years. What can we do to be
[1:27:22] saved? And I like the way the prophet
[1:27:24] tells it.
[1:27:26] Because you remember Jesus trusted
[1:27:30] Peter. He gave him whatever you bind
[1:27:33] will be bound. Whatever you loose will
[1:27:35] be
[1:27:37] loosed. So under the anointing of the
[1:27:40] Holy Ghost, Peter could only say what
[1:27:42] the Holy Ghost would say. Are you with
[1:27:49] me? So here he is. The prophet says,
[1:27:52] "Oh, be careful, Peter.
[1:27:55] You got the keys hanging on
[1:27:57] now. The first gospel
[1:28:03] message. Huh? He said as he's standing
[1:28:07] there where the Holy Ghost had fell its
[1:28:09] first time and Pet asked Peter, "What
[1:28:10] can we do to be saved?" And he says that
[1:28:13] they had been talking about we go be
[1:28:15] baptized in the name of the father, son,
[1:28:16] and holy ghost. What are you going to
[1:28:18] do, Peter? You got the keys.
[1:28:22] And he says, "Peter, look there." And he
[1:28:24] says, he looks down there and he says,
[1:28:25] "Peter's got the keys." And he says,
[1:28:27] "What are you going to do?" God has to
[1:28:29] recognize it in heaven. What do we do,
[1:28:32] Peter, to be saved? And he said,
[1:28:34] "Repent, every one of you, and be
[1:28:35] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:28:38] the remission of your sins."
[1:28:41] He said the right things. He said the
[1:28:44] right things. What did he do? He said he
[1:28:45] crammed the key into the door and
[1:28:47] unlocked what people needed in that
[1:28:49] hour.
[1:28:53] And whatever he said, it settled it
[1:28:55] forever. He said, "No person at any
[1:28:58] time, any place could ever ever
[1:29:01] contradict
[1:29:05] it." He said in one
[1:29:08] place he said when they asked, "What
[1:29:10] should we do to be saved?" He said, "If
[1:29:11] Peter would have said stand on your
[1:29:13] head, that's what it would have taken."
[1:29:18] You see the power of the
[1:29:22] key. Oh, he says only if the church
[1:29:25] could possess the keys. If the church
[1:29:27] could only possess that key of faith
[1:29:28] that could unlock any door, any
[1:29:30] sickness, any plague, any case that
[1:29:33] there is, if it could be unlocked to us,
[1:29:36] we could possess that key.
[1:29:45] Let's go to Jerusalem as we
[1:29:51] close. Prophet said it was a morning
[1:29:53] about
[1:29:55] 8:00. He said, "I hear a noise
[1:29:58] outside." And he said, "I hear this
[1:30:00] noise outside. We're we're they're
[1:30:01] talking and and all this is going on. A
[1:30:03] bunch of carrying on and a and a hiss
[1:30:05] and a cry and some mocking.
[1:30:08] And I pull back the shades to look
[1:30:13] out. Sometimes I wonder what it would it
[1:30:15] be like to be in the mind of a
[1:30:18] prophet. I pulled back the shades to see
[1:30:20] what was going
[1:30:23] on. What's going on out there? And look,
[1:30:25] coming down the street, there's a man
[1:30:28] and he's got two male factors following
[1:30:31] him. And on his shoulder, on his back is
[1:30:34] a
[1:30:36] cross. And they say that's Jesus of
[1:30:39] Nazareth, an
[1:30:41] impostor. He says he's a divine healer,
[1:30:43] but he's the one that troubles our
[1:30:45] churches, teaches things that our
[1:30:48] priests don't believe
[1:30:53] in. And I I see those big cross going
[1:30:57] over those cobblestones as he goes out
[1:30:59] the gate. And it the cross is bumping up
[1:31:02] and down, up and down on his shoulder as
[1:31:04] he goes along. And I noticed he had on a
[1:31:07] robe without a seam and had all these
[1:31:10] little bitty red dots
[1:31:13] speckled. He said, ' But as I watch him
[1:31:16] and he goes towards Calvary, these
[1:31:17] little dots get bigger and bigger and
[1:31:21] bigger until it runs into a red ri a big
[1:31:24] red
[1:31:25] splotch. It's
[1:31:27] blood. And he says as he starts up
[1:31:30] Calvary there, I can hear something
[1:31:32] going. What is it? It's the second Adam,
[1:31:34] the redeemer, the blood of the righteous
[1:31:36] one, bleeding for the sinner to cover up
[1:31:39] our
[1:31:40] sins. He said, "And we spit it back to
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:48] him. We we wag our heads and said, I'll
[1:31:52] have my own
[1:31:55] way. I've got my own religion. I don't
[1:31:57] have to have that
[1:31:59] stuff." But without that, you're lost.
[1:32:01] without hope, without God, without
[1:32:03] Christ, and a world dying, going to the
[1:32:05] sinner's grave and a devil's hell
[1:32:08] without
[1:32:10] that. But he said, "God made a
[1:32:12] preparation for
[1:32:14] you. He could have saved himself." He
[1:32:16] said, "But I can see him going up that
[1:32:18] hill, packing that cross, and his little
[1:32:21] weak body
[1:32:22] staggering." I think one place he says
[1:32:24] he couldn't have weighed more than 140
[1:32:27] pounds. 135, 140 pounds.
[1:32:31] And he's packing his cross and I can see
[1:32:33] under his under his weak body it's
[1:32:35] staggering as he goes up the hill and
[1:32:37] you first thing you know it was whirling
[1:32:39] around him
[1:32:40] death it was biting at him
[1:32:43] hard and he's moving up Calvary
[1:32:47] yonder because he had to.
[1:32:51] No, he said because love drove him
[1:32:59] to. Think of
[1:33:02] it. He saved
[1:33:05] others. He could not save
[1:33:08] himself. That's what they said about
[1:33:10] him. And the prophet said that was a
[1:33:12] great
[1:33:16] compliment. He couldn't save himself.
[1:33:20] Did you ever think of it? He said that
[1:33:22] he was a father God as a sacrifice.
[1:33:25] That's the reason that that's that I
[1:33:27] love that song, brother. When you try to
[1:33:28] make him just a prophet, he's more than
[1:33:30] a prophet. He was God manifested in
[1:33:34] flesh. You say, "Well, that shows his
[1:33:36] weakness." No, it shows his
[1:33:38] strength. His strength was being able to
[1:33:41] refrain from calling down 12 legions of
[1:33:44] angels. 72,000 angels he could have
[1:33:47] called on his behalf and said do away
[1:33:49] with
[1:33:50] it.
[1:33:52] 72,000 angels were sitting watching from
[1:33:56] the banisters of heaven waiting for
[1:33:58] Jesus to say
[1:34:00] come. Rid me of
[1:34:06] this. And all the while his own
[1:34:09] children screaming for his blood.
[1:34:13] Now you're you got some we got some
[1:34:14] fathers and mothers in here. Can you
[1:34:17] imagine your children screaming for the
[1:34:19] death of
[1:34:23] you? That's what they did. They begin to
[1:34:25] scream, "We want his blood. Away with
[1:34:28] him. Kill him. Give us
[1:34:31] Barabbus. Crucify
[1:34:38] him." And what did he say?
[1:34:42] Father, forgive
[1:34:47] them. The greatest key the world has
[1:34:49] ever
[1:34:51] known. Father, forgive them for they
[1:34:54] know not what they
[1:35:02] do. One was on a cross beside him on the
[1:35:05] left hand. One was on the cross beside
[1:35:07] him on the right hand. And one said,
[1:35:10] "Look at you. You can save others, but
[1:35:11] you can't save us. If you're the who you
[1:35:13] say you are, get us down from here. And
[1:35:16] the other one says, "Listen, it's
[1:35:18] you. We deserve what we're getting. He
[1:35:22] has done nothing
[1:35:25] wrong." You talk about a revelation of
[1:35:27] the
[1:35:29] word. At that time, he held in his
[1:35:32] hands, brothers and sisters, the key to
[1:35:34] paradise.
[1:35:36] And he said, "If you will, when you go,
[1:35:38] remember me in this
[1:35:40] hour." And Jesus said,
[1:35:43] "Today, today you've unlocked the door
[1:35:47] to the kingdom of paradise. You will be
[1:35:50] with me when I get there."
[1:35:57] He died between those two malfactors.
[1:35:59] They put him in a grave and they sealed
[1:36:01] the
[1:36:02] grave. I said they sealed the grave.
[1:36:05] They want to lock it
[1:36:06] up. They knew enough about him. They
[1:36:08] knew he was powerful
[1:36:11] enough that he might just do what he
[1:36:13] said he was going to do. And so they go
[1:36:16] to Pilate and they tell him in Matthew
[1:36:17] chapter 27, they go to Pilot and they
[1:36:20] say, "Listen here, sir. Remember that
[1:36:22] deceiver? While he was alive, he said
[1:36:24] after three days he's going to rise
[1:36:26] again."
[1:36:28] He said, "So, so we command therefore
[1:36:31] that the septic septler be made
[1:36:34] sure." What's that mean? Lock it
[1:36:37] down. Make sure that it's sure until the
[1:36:39] third
[1:36:40] days. You know, we don't we don't really
[1:36:42] think he's going to get up, but what if
[1:36:44] his disciples come and steal him away
[1:36:45] and they say that he
[1:36:51] rose? So, make it sure. And Pilate said
[1:36:54] unto them, I'll give you a watch. You
[1:36:56] have your watch. Go your way. Make it as
[1:36:58] sure as can
[1:37:01] be. And so they went and they made the
[1:37:03] supplicer sure, sealing the stone and
[1:37:05] setting
[1:37:08] watch. Can you imagine this stone
[1:37:10] weighing 10,000 tons, maybe 10,000 lbs,
[1:37:14] I don't
[1:37:16] know. And they pack the clay around
[1:37:19] it and seal it up so that it cannot be
[1:37:23] opened. No
[1:37:24] man, no man in the the greatest strength
[1:37:28] the deck of man could have could roll
[1:37:29] that stone away. And they garnish it, he
[1:37:32] said, with a bunch of soldiers. A 100
[1:37:34] men armed around that supplr to make
[1:37:37] sure nothing would take place. A hundred
[1:37:40] armed
[1:37:44] soldiers. I've got a key to the
[1:37:48] kingdom. I've got a key to the kingdom.
[1:37:57] And he said, "On down there, here they
[1:37:59] come. All those religious demons down
[1:38:01] there to to the to the to uh to to hold
[1:38:03] him back." And he said, "There he laid
[1:38:06] in the tomb in body, but in spirit.
[1:38:10] He's going on down." Now, you remember
[1:38:12] what we read when brother said he was in
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:15] accident. There was no foundation and he
[1:38:18] was falling and he was falling and there
[1:38:19] was no bottom to it. And now here we see
[1:38:22] Jesus going on down into the regions of
[1:38:24] the demons to the very gates of hell and
[1:38:26] he knocks on the door.
[1:38:31] Let me tell you, he didn't go down there
[1:38:33] and say, "Sir, Mr.
[1:38:37] Satan, Mr. Satan, could I talk to you
[1:38:40] for just a minute? If would you mind
[1:38:41] stepping out on your front porch?" He
[1:38:42] said, "Open the door.
[1:38:45] God, I'm on a mission. Open the door.
[1:38:49] Let me see you face to face. I'm here to
[1:38:51] meet you. And Satan looks at him and
[1:38:54] says, "Oh, you've arrived. Have you? I
[1:38:57] thought I had you when I killed Abel. I
[1:38:59] thought I had you down through the dark
[1:39:01] ages. I thought I had you through all
[1:39:03] these times, but now you're here. And
[1:39:05] I've got you in my
[1:39:09] grasp, locked away in a
[1:39:13] tomb in the regions of the lost.
[1:39:23] And the prophet said, I could hear him
[1:39:24] say,
[1:39:27] "Satan, come
[1:39:31] here." You know, there's a time when
[1:39:33] Jesus when God means
[1:39:36] business. Satan, come
[1:39:38] here. I'm boss now.
[1:39:42] I'm boss now. He reaches over and grabs
[1:39:45] the keys of death, hell, and the grave.
[1:39:47] Yes. Hallelujah. Now I've got the keys.
[1:39:50] He says he gives him a swift kick and
[1:39:52] puts him right back to where he should
[1:39:54] have been. Kicks him down there. He
[1:39:55] says, "You've been a bluff long enough.
[1:39:57] You've got a fake key. You've got a key
[1:39:59] that don't open anything that helps my
[1:40:01] people. You're a deceiver. You're a
[1:40:03] bluff. You're a liar. I've got the keys
[1:40:05] now." And he puts them on his hip.
[1:40:13] I've got a key to the kingdom.
[1:40:16] You've got a key to the
[1:40:22] kingdom. I'm boss
[1:40:29] now. But on that Easter
[1:40:32] morning, he said, but on that Easter
[1:40:35] morning, it didn't matter how many
[1:40:38] armies they had
[1:40:40] garnished when it was time for that word
[1:40:43] to be fulfilled.
[1:40:46] when it was time to put that key into
[1:40:48] the door.
[1:40:50] When it was time for the tomb to be
[1:40:52] rolled away, when it was time for him to
[1:40:55] come up out of the ground and say, "I
[1:40:56] have conquered death, hell, and the
[1:40:58] grave." And you've got the mysteries in
[1:41:00] your hand. You've got a key of the Holy
[1:41:02] Ghost and the bride of Jesus Christ. Ask
[1:41:04] what you will and it'll be given.
[1:41:08] Let's stand to our feet.
[1:41:11] He said, "I'll suffer not my holy one to
[1:41:13] see corruption." It had to happen. The
[1:41:16] key had to open the door.
[1:41:20] Christ walked out victorious over death,
[1:41:23] hell, and the grave.
[1:41:26] The time had come.
[1:41:29] Let's bow our heads. Musicians, if you'd
[1:41:31] like to come, Brother Josh.
[1:41:34] Heavenly
[1:41:36] Father, just thank you, Lord, for this
[1:41:38] day, for your blessings. Thank you for
[1:41:41] the word tonight, Lord. We trust that
[1:41:43] it's been encouraging and edifying to
[1:41:46] the body tonight, Lord, that we could
[1:41:48] gain strength from it, knowing that
[1:41:50] you've given us all that we have need of
[1:41:51] in this life. But we just have to be
[1:41:53] able to to use the the possession of the
[1:41:55] Holy Ghost. We have to find ourselves
[1:41:57] before you, faithful and true, dedicated
[1:42:01] and faithful in this fight and this
[1:42:03] battle we're in. But with the keys that
[1:42:05] we have in this kingdom, we can overcome
[1:42:07] everything that's that Satan puts before
[1:42:09] us. Every sickness, every every disease,
[1:42:12] every fault, every every hindrance,
[1:42:14] everything we have need of is in the
[1:42:16] keys of the Holy Ghost, in the keys of
[1:42:18] the kingdom.
[1:42:19] Lord, Lord, help us to be more than just
[1:42:22] professors of Christianity, professors
[1:42:25] of a of a powerful, wonderworking God,
[1:42:27] but let us be
[1:42:29] possessors. Possessors that know how to
[1:42:31] use the keys of the kingdom, that know
[1:42:33] how to stand upon the word of God, who
[1:42:35] get into the word and knows that we can
[1:42:37] stand on the word and as the word goes
[1:42:38] forth, things have to happen. Just like
[1:42:40] you said, you could not see corruption
[1:42:43] set in. So therefore, you had to come
[1:42:44] out of the tomb. And as we think about
[1:42:47] on this Easter week, we celebrate
[1:42:51] Easter. We're so thankful that you had
[1:42:53] us on your
[1:42:55] mind. We're so thankful that the key to
[1:42:58] our
[1:43:00] redemption was you pouring out your love
[1:43:04] on our lives, Lord.
[1:43:06] that though we done so many things that
[1:43:08] were wrong and evil and mistreated and
[1:43:11] said things that were bad, done things
[1:43:13] that were
[1:43:14] wrong, when you were on the
[1:43:18] cross, I was on your
[1:43:21] mind. Thank you,
[1:43:23] Lord. Lord, help us never to to take for
[1:43:26] granted what you've done for us.
[1:43:30] Help us just to take the time of the
[1:43:32] rest remainder of the week to celebrate
[1:43:34] what Easter means. It's not a a bunny, a
[1:43:38] an egg or a pink painted flower or an
[1:43:41] egg that's been painted and
[1:43:43] decorated, but it's about a blood that
[1:43:46] was shed on Calvary. And it's about a
[1:43:48] blood that your your prophet said that
[1:43:51] that that is still wed on Calvary. And
[1:43:53] it's still a it's still a healing blood.
[1:43:55] It's still a miracle working blood. And
[1:43:56] it's still a powerful work in
[1:43:59] blood. So help us to remember that this
[1:44:03] week and in the months to
[1:44:07] come. We love you Lord with all of our
[1:44:10] hearts and give you honor and praise and
[1:44:12] glory in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Josh,
[1:44:16] you just want to sing for
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:24] us in the name of
[1:44:29] Jesus. We've got the
[1:44:33] [Music]
[1:44:35] power in the name of the
[1:44:40] Lord. Though Satan
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] rages, we cannot be
[1:44:51] defeated. We've got the
[1:44:56] power in the name of the
[1:45:01] Lord. Oh, give me your hand.
[1:45:08] Let's agree
[1:45:12] together that all of our
[1:45:17] eneies will crumble at our feet.
[1:45:24] Whatever we bind on
[1:45:28] earth shall be bound in
[1:45:31] [Music]
[1:45:33] heaven at the name of
[1:45:38] Jesus. Oh, Satan has to
[1:45:43] flee. And we've got the
[1:45:49] power in the name of
[1:45:54] Jesus. We've got the
[1:46:00] power in the name of the
[1:46:05] Lord. And though Satan
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:10] rages, we cannot be
[1:46:15] defeated. We've got the
[1:46:21] power in the name of the
[1:46:26] Lord. And for many years
[1:46:31] now, Satan's tried to stop
[1:46:36] us. Oh, but the pride of
[1:46:41] Jesus, the Lord, we're still
[1:46:46] alive. And like a mighty
[1:46:52] army, we keep marching
[1:46:57] onward, winning every
[1:47:02] battle cuz the Lord's on our side.
[1:47:09] We've got the
[1:47:13] power in the name of
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:18] Jesus. We've got the
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:24] power in the name of the Lord.
[1:47:30] Though Satan
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] rages, we cannot be
[1:47:39] defeated. For we've got the
[1:47:45] power in the name of the Lord. Let's
[1:47:48] sing that second verse one more time.
[1:47:51] Oh, for many years
[1:47:55] now, Satan tried to stop
[1:48:00] us. Oh, but the bride of
[1:48:05] Jesus, the Lord is still
[1:48:10] alive. And like a mighty
[1:48:16] army, we keep marching
[1:48:22] onward in every
[1:48:26] battle because the Lord's on our
[1:48:31] side and we've got the
[1:48:37] power in the name of Jesus.
[1:48:42] Jesus, we've got the
[1:48:48] power in the name of the
[1:48:54] Lord. And though Satan
[1:48:58] raes, we cannot be defeated.
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:05] We've got the
[1:49:09] power in the name of the
[1:49:14] Lord. Amen. Do you believe it this
[1:49:16] evening? Amen. It's been good to be
[1:49:19] here. Amen. Let's just take that what we
[1:49:21] heard tonight and apply it to our lives
[1:49:22] this week and walk in victory. Amen. As
[1:49:25] we're dismissed this evening, let's sing
[1:49:26] there is power. Power. Wonder working
[1:49:29] power. There is power.
[1:49:34] Power, wonder, working power in the
[1:49:39] blood. Oh, of the
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:43] lamb. There is
[1:49:45] power,
[1:49:47] power, wonder working power in the
[1:49:52] preious blood of the lamb.
[1:49:57] There is
[1:49:59] power. I won't.
[1:50:04] [Music]
