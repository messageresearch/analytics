[13:27] children can be dismissed to Sunday
[13:29] school
[13:35] Brother Brad would you open us in a
[13:38] prayer
[14:14] hey open your Bibles to Isaiah 53
[14:39] who hath believed a report and to whom
[14:42] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[14:46] foreign
[15:02] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[15:06] grief
[15:07] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[15:10] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[15:22] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[15:25] was bruised for our iniquities the chat
[15:28] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[15:31] him and with his stripes we are healed
[15:45] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[15:47] yet he opened not his mouth he is
[15:50] brought as a lamb to this latter and as
[15:53] a sheep before her shearers is done so
[15:55] he openeth not his mouth
[15:58] foreign
[16:12] with the wicked and with the rich in his
[16:16] death because he had done no violence
[16:18] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[16:38] he shall see at the travail of his soul
[16:42] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[16:46] shall my righteous servant justify many
[16:48] for he shall bear their iniquities
[16:55] a portion with a great Haitian of the
[16:59] spoil with the strong because he has
[17:02] poured out his soul unto death and he
[17:04] was numbered with the transgressors and
[17:07] he Bears sin of many and made
[17:09] intercession for the transgressors
[17:13] okay
[17:18] other Troy
[17:25] to be seated
[17:27] that's a beautiful scripture wasn't it
[17:31] is the Lord being good to everyone this
[17:32] week
[17:35] it's been good to me I know that he's
[17:37] been good I believe and trust to all of
[17:40] us it's a beautiful day out
[17:42] we're looking headed in the right
[17:44] direction with weather it looks like so
[17:45] that's really nice
[17:48] we'll just go back uh
[17:50] a few uh chapters here in Isaiah it's
[17:54] just one
[17:56] verse
[18:02] it's Isaiah
[18:04] one
[18:11] he's got a couple scriptures
[18:13] talking about the goodness of God
[18:16] how good he is to us
[18:18] it's a uh in Isaiah it's uh chapter one
[18:22] verse 18.
[18:28] come now and let us reason together
[18:30] saith the Lord
[18:31] though your sins be as Scarlet they
[18:33] shall be as wide as snow
[18:36] though they be red like Crimson they
[18:38] should be as wool amen
[18:42] it was
[18:45] that's a lot of times when the devil
[18:47] tries to trick us and he tries to get us
[18:49] to look at ourselves or what we offer to
[18:51] God but we have nothing to offer God
[18:54] work he did everything
[18:56] and I got this quote here from adoption
[19:05] talking about the love of God
[19:07] for the ram says well bless your heart
[19:09] he was talking to a sister there no harm
[19:11] can come nothing at all in the evening
[19:13] time will go up on top of the mountain
[19:16] talking about
[19:17] uh on top of the mountain say oh papa
[19:19] God and once was lost but once was in
[19:22] the moccasin
[19:24] but you saved me
[19:26] why people that's tried to express that
[19:29] which went crazy well that man who wrote
[19:31] the last verse of that oh love of God
[19:33] depend on an insane while the
[19:35] institution who tried to express love of
[19:38] God
[19:39] how many stood to how that he stooped
[19:42] down to save Sinners and now
[19:44] that he did his love that come down to
[19:47] save you and I talk about worship Angels
[19:49] don't know nothing about it the worship
[19:51] the angel only knows he can stand there
[19:54] in his and his wings go back and forth
[19:57] and across and say hallelujah hallelujah
[20:00] but oh mercy when it comes to knowing I
[20:02] was lost and now I'm found I was dead
[20:06] and I'm alive again
[20:08] oh God it was sin I was in Mock and I
[20:12] was down in the dump but I'm not anymore
[20:14] thank the Lord
[20:16] and he was talking about the best of
[20:18] life we look at the
[20:20] it's a beautiful day out
[20:22] the things of life he says here's the
[20:24] best that life could give you did you
[20:26] ever go down and he's talking about
[20:29] where we were and stooped in sin and and
[20:32] uh he said did you ever go down to the
[20:34] dump this was the Colgate dump it's the
[20:37] stinkiest
[20:39] they used to must have burned the dumps
[20:41] off back then he said that old just
[20:43] makes me sick to smell it laying there
[20:44] and all that old smoke so sick at your
[20:46] stomach just turning inside out
[20:49] after taking castor oil he said see just
[20:52] as sick as you can be rats running all
[20:54] over you trying to eat on you and that's
[20:56] the best that life can give you here and
[20:59] then
[21:00] and then somebody reached down and pick
[21:02] you up
[21:03] and you're real old and can't help
[21:05] yourself and he just reaches down and
[21:07] picks you up and turn you to an 18 year
[21:10] old boy again set you up on top of the
[21:12] mountain
[21:13] the very very Bloom of Health my good
[21:17] breath or fresh air like that good cold
[21:19] drink of water would you ever want to go
[21:21] back to that dump again
[21:23] he says never never would I ever want to
[21:25] go back to that dump again
[21:27] and I heard him this morning it was uh
[21:29] just uh hearing this he said
[21:33] even if we don't want a minute he said
[21:34] after you're over the age of 25 he said
[21:37] you're going back going backwards to the
[21:39] dust but he said well he didn't make a
[21:42] exception in there he said we're we're
[21:44] actually going back but he said actually
[21:46] our life's not even started yet so I
[21:49] thought that was really good
[21:50] but let's see here where are we going
[21:52] here okay
[21:54] we'll turn over into Ephesians
[22:03] Ephesians 2
[22:05] and Paul
[22:13] and uh
[22:14] just the chapter two here Ephesians
[22:16] chapter two and and you have he
[22:18] quickened who were dead and trespasses
[22:20] and sins wherein in time pass you walk
[22:23] according to the course of this world
[22:25] according to the prince of the power of
[22:28] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[22:30] the children of disobedience
[22:32] among whom also we all had our
[22:35] conversation in times past in the lust
[22:37] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[22:39] the Flesh and of the Mind where by
[22:41] Nature the children of a wrath even as
[22:43] others
[22:47] uh verse 4 here but God who is rich in
[22:50] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[22:53] loved us
[22:55] even when we were dead in sins hath
[22:57] quickened us together with Christ by
[22:59] Grace we are saved
[23:01] and hath raised us up together and made
[23:03] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[23:06] Christ Jesus
[23:07] that in the ages to come he might show
[23:09] the exceeding Riches of his grace and
[23:12] his kindness toward us through Christ
[23:14] Jesus for by grace are ye saved through
[23:17] faith and that not of yourselves it is a
[23:19] gift of God
[23:22] that's a again we've talked about a lot
[23:25] of times you know talked about different
[23:26] people but we
[23:28] sometimes try to we sometimes get
[23:30] ourselves in the way of God for he says
[23:33] there
[23:34] uh
[23:37] seeding Riches of his of his grace to
[23:40] his kindness toward us through Jesus
[23:41] Christ for by grace are ye saved through
[23:44] faith and that not of yourselves it is a
[23:48] gift it is a gift of God to us now that
[23:50] works lest any man should boast for We
[23:53] Are
[23:54] for we are his workmanship created in
[23:57] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[23:59] hath before ordained that we would
[24:02] should walk in them
[24:04] and this little quote kind of goes with
[24:06] it
[24:10] one's from
[24:12] the faith of Abraham
[24:14] brother Baron says in here whosoever is
[24:16] born of the spirit of God is gods and
[24:19] you're coming by the promise that the
[24:20] Covenant God made to Abraham his promise
[24:23] that he would send Christ and if you're
[24:25] in Christ you're part of that Covenant
[24:27] and the promises you say I'm not worthy
[24:29] neither was Abraham these are good
[24:32] things to listen to because a lot of
[24:33] times if you don't listen and go build
[24:35] yourself up in in the word of God or
[24:37] build or listen to a tape the Devil he's
[24:39] at your ear all the time all the time
[24:41] telling you you're no good you're no
[24:43] good you're no good so this is good
[24:45] stuff for us to hear uh all throughout
[24:47] the week really we should feed on it
[24:49] because it just keeps you up because the
[24:51] world's just a pressure pressing you
[24:53] down pressing you down
[24:54] but I like how I sit in here
[24:57] Covenant and it was through the Covenant
[24:59] that he had gave Abraham and you say he
[25:01] says and you say I'm not worthy and
[25:04] brother Brandon said neither was Abraham
[25:07] nobody's worthy it ain't how worthy you
[25:10] are it's what God promised you
[25:12] and uh he says he goes on to say I'm not
[25:15] worthy to stand up here but he called me
[25:17] to do it you're not worthy to be a
[25:19] Christian but God made you one this
[25:22] Temple was not worthy to sit on this
[25:23] ground but God said it here that's it it
[25:26] ain't what you are it's what he is
[25:29] everybody's always looking at
[25:31] theirselves why you can't look at
[25:33] yourself and get anywhere you're
[25:35] finished to begin with your failure to
[25:37] start with there's nothing to you to
[25:39] begin with it's what God Made You
[25:41] is what you are under the old Covenant
[25:45] what if a little mule would be born out
[25:47] of the pasture some night and when that
[25:50] little mule was born he turned around
[25:51] and his Mammy would look at him and his
[25:53] ears would be flopped down you know that
[25:55] what a flopped your mule is being a
[25:57] farmer that's a mule that's no good
[26:00] and he's cross-eyed his knees are
[26:02] knocked together his tail stick straight
[26:04] up in the air
[26:05] well he's the horriblest looking sight
[26:07] you ever seen
[26:09] that little fella could look around at
[26:11] his Mimi and say well I won't be able to
[26:12] live no sir because as soon as the
[26:14] master comes out here he he'll knock me
[26:16] in the head because I ain't worth
[26:17] nothing
[26:18] that's just about like every one of us
[26:20] but his mother well instructed in the
[26:23] word of God she'd say wait a minute
[26:24] honey no no you're born under a
[26:28] Birthright when the man of the house
[26:30] comes out he will go to the pasture
[26:32] and hunt the most perfect lamb that he's
[26:34] got
[26:35] the high priest will never see you he
[26:38] will see the lamb he won't examine you
[26:40] he will examine the lamb because you're
[26:43] born under a Birthright the lamb has to
[26:46] die for you
[26:48] now you look at Jesus and find any fall
[26:50] in him don't look at yourself look at
[26:52] him
[26:55] don't look who you are look who he is
[26:57] then you'll be getting close to Divine
[27:00] Healing search your sacrifice over if
[27:02] you can find any fault in that well
[27:03] that's that's the different then you
[27:06] have a right to disbelieve but there's
[27:07] no fault in him there's no fault in
[27:09] Jesus God don't look at you
[27:12] he looked at the sacrifice there was a
[27:15] perfect one died for us faulty ones we
[27:18] who are disfigured in immoral and ugly
[27:20] and everything we but he took the
[27:22] perfect one and looked him all over this
[27:25] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[27:26] pleased
[27:27] he was the sacrifice God accepted him so
[27:31] ours is finished all we have to do is
[27:33] walk in Grace
[27:35] well that little mule could just kick up
[27:37] them little heels and knock them little
[27:38] naught knees together and knicker go all
[27:41] over the field because he's free you
[27:43] don't have to die a lamb died for him
[27:46] he's perfectly safe you don't have to
[27:48] fear about dying the lamb died for him
[27:51] for
[27:51] uh for him you don't have to fear about
[27:54] what you are it's what he was he was the
[27:58] one who died for us for you
[28:01] when you find fault in him then I'll
[28:03] tell you why he can't be healed but when
[28:06] you find no fault in your sacrifice God
[28:08] has accepted that sacrifice and when he
[28:09] accepts a sacrifice he accepts your
[28:11] confession in the sacrifice and you
[28:13] become part of it
[28:15] amen that's good
[28:18] I'm just gonna finish up
[28:20] that's truth 100 truth you have to take
[28:24] and look at Jesus as your sacrifice and
[28:27] like I said the devil will kick you
[28:30] around devil try to get you to look at
[28:31] your symptoms try to look at you try to
[28:33] look at why you can't have it that don't
[28:35] have nothing to do what God done did for
[28:36] you he done he doesn't finish the work
[28:39] so take a hold of it and go forward
[28:42] always go forward
[28:43] brother Steve said
[28:45] I guess we'll do her best and he said
[28:48] well it'll go forward basically he said
[28:50] we don't never go over never Retreat we
[28:52] go forward
[28:53] but this is that
[28:55] part of that verse this is a little bit
[28:57] of the verse before
[28:58] talking about the love of God that song
[29:00] the love of God is straight or far than
[29:03] tonger pen can ever tell goes beyond the
[29:05] highest star and reaches two
[29:08] the lowest hell this was the verse that
[29:11] was penned on the side of an insane
[29:12] insane Institution
[29:15] could we with ink the ocean fill
[29:20] and were the Skies of parchment made
[29:24] where every stalk on earth a quail
[29:27] and every man ascribed by trade
[29:31] to write the love of God above
[29:33] would drain the ocean dry
[29:37] nor could this grow contain coal
[29:41] go stretched from Sky to Sky
