[3:44] here Psalm
[3:48] 20 short Psalm but a powerful
[3:54] Psalm sure is good to be in the house of
[3:57] the Lord this morning
[4:02] Psalm

[4:55] name of the Lord our God
[5:02] save the Lord let the king hear us when
[5:05] we call God bless you may be seated to
[5:07] Brother
[5:24] Brian morning brothers and
[5:27] sisters I hope it's you've had a good
[5:30] week and the week ahead you'll have a
[5:32] better week you know that Psalm there
[5:34] goes with those quotes that were on the
[5:36] thing this
[5:38] morning the sole purpose of everything
[5:41] our whole Endeavors in life is to have
[5:43] the very presence of Jesus Christ in our
[5:45] heart and life I mean there's nothing
[5:47] that can stand between you the believer
[5:50] as long as the Living God the Eternal
[5:52] God is living in the heart and life of
[5:54] you your family the church everything
[5:57] around you then there's nothing to be be
[5:59] afraid of and I was uh reading this this
[6:03] morning uh if you turn to the the
[6:06] prophet
[6:07] hay the first chapter this
[6:11] morning you know I was also listening to
[6:14] a a
[6:15] message this morning also and it really
[6:20] struck me what brother brandham had to
[6:21] say to that one Minister but I'll just
[6:24] read this chapter you'll have to forgive
[6:26] my pronunciations I listened to it
[6:29] you know on the Bible app but I know I'm
[6:32] going to mess up some of these words but
[6:34] this is where uh the Lord's talking to
[6:37] they've come out of uh Babylon you know
[6:40] they've come out of Persia they're in
[6:43] the new land and they're all worried
[6:45] about their own lives and everything
[6:46] that goes on with their own lives and
[6:48] they forgot the house of the Lord but
[6:50] I'm not thinking of it in in a natural
[6:53] sense I'm thinking of in this day and
[6:55] age how the the church and the people
[6:59] have forgotten in their own lives to
[7:01] build the house of the Lord in their own
[7:03] hearts and in their own lives and I'll
[7:05] just read what the prophet had to say as
[7:08] God spoke to him in the second year of
[7:10] dyus the king in the sixth month and the
[7:13] first day of the month came the word of
[7:15] the Lord by Hagi the prophet onto
[7:19] zerubabel the son of sheel the governor
[7:22] of Judea and to Joshua the son of jasak
[7:28] the high priest saying
[7:30] and this is what he had to say thus
[7:32] speak of the Lord of hosts saying this
[7:35] people say the time has not come the
[7:37] time that the Lord's House should be
[7:39] built and and I'm not thinking in a
[7:42] natural sense I'm thinking in a physical
[7:44] sense form they then came the word of
[7:48] the Lord on BAGI the prophet saying is
[7:51] it time for you oh ye to dwell in your
[7:55] uh sealed houses and the houses and the
[7:59] house lying waste and he's talking about
[8:01] the house of the Lord but we're the
[8:02] house of the Lord this morning now
[8:05] therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[8:07] consider your ways you have sown much
[8:10] and bring in little that's speaks a lot
[8:13] to our lives you know you s a lot you do
[8:16] a lot but if you don't got God in your
[8:18] heart it's not going to prosper you got
[8:20] to go back to the source here and I lost
[8:24] my place but uh okay you've sewn much
[8:29] and you in little you eat I think I
[8:32] lost I I'm on the right spot you eat but
[8:35] you have not enough you drink but you're
[8:37] not filled with a drink you're
[8:39] clothe you but there is none warm he
[8:43] that
[8:49] [Music]
[8:58] earnthenecklace the Lord where they
[9:00] could worship and it's no different for
[9:02] us I'm not thinking in a monetary way of
[9:05] providing I'm just thinking in our lives
[9:07] do do we do the things in our life that
[9:10] God ask us to do to be prosperous in the
[9:13] day that we live we all know what God
[9:15] ask us to do like brother Bram said your
[9:17] ABCs always believe Christ you know the
[9:20] things we need to do every morning every
[9:22] evening every day do we do we forget to
[9:26] do those things and then thus sayith the
[9:28] Lord theost can consider your ways go up
[9:32] to the mountain and bring wood and build
[9:34] house and build the house and and I will
[9:36] take pleasure in it and I will be
[9:38] glorified sayeth the Lord you look for
[9:41] much and lo it came to little and when
[9:43] you brought it home I do blow upon it
[9:46] why sayeth the Lord of hosts because of
[9:48] mine house that is a waste you run every
[9:51] man to his own house so it's the same
[9:53] thing in our own lives if if you're
[9:55] putting everything else in your life
[9:58] before the Lord
[10:00] you're going to be no different than
[10:01] these people in this day and age and he
[10:03] goes on to say therefore the heavens
[10:05] over you is stayed from due and the
[10:07] Earth has stayed from her fruit you know
[10:10] the blessings come does it always mean
[10:13] you're going to be blessed in everything
[10:14] you do no but the blessings come upon
[10:17] those that put God first in their life
[10:20] sometimes those aren't a natural
[10:21] blessing that could be a physical
[10:23] blessing and he goes on therefore the
[10:25] heavens over you is stayed from due and
[10:28] the Earth is stayed from the fruit fruit
[10:29] and I've called for a drought upon the
[10:31] land and upon the mountains and upon the
[10:34] corn and upon the new wine and upon the
[10:36] oil and upon which the ground bringeth
[10:39] forth upon men upon cattle upon all the
[10:42] labor of the hands and then my
[10:45] pronunciations here then suub the son of
[10:48] shathi the Joshua the son of josac the
[10:51] high priest with all the remember of the
[10:53] people obeyed the voice of the Lord
[10:56] their God and the word of Hagi the
[10:58] prophet as the Lord their God had sent
[11:00] him and the Lord did fear be and the PE
[11:03] excuse me the people did fear before the
[11:06] Lord then spake Hagi the Lord's
[11:08] Messenger to the Lord's message unto the
[11:12] people saying I Am with You sayeth the
[11:14] Lord and and they begin to prosper when
[11:17] they did the right thing excuse
[11:20] me and then finishing these last few
[11:23] verses here it says and the Lord stirred
[11:25] up the spirit of zubar Ru and the son
[11:28] I'm not going to pronounce this word the
[11:30] same more never going to pronounce this
[11:33] word Sai the governor of Judah the
[11:36] spirit of Joshua the son of jeac the
[11:39] high priest and the spirit of all the
[11:41] REM of the people and they came and did
[11:43] the work in the house of the Lord of
[11:45] host their God and the 4 and 20 days of
[11:49] the sixth month and the second year of
[11:51] dyus the king and if you would turn with
[11:54] me over to 2 Thessalonians the 3 chapter
[11:57] but I was listening to that message
[12:00] um and I I wrote a note to myself this
[12:03] morning and it
[12:05] said faith in God we have to have faith
[12:08] in God and it's not something we can
[12:10] develop ourself God gives you every
[12:13] individual here this morning some form
[12:15] of Faith whatever that form of faith is
[12:18] you take that faith that God gives you
[12:20] you take it back to the word of God in
[12:22] the message of the hour and God will
[12:24] take that little faith and make it
[12:26] stronger each day in your hearts and
[12:27] lives you have to and you have to work
[12:30] in it every day to build that Faith to
[12:32] believe the promises of God but um I I
[12:35] just wrote what he was talking about I
[12:37] don't know I can't remember the name of
[12:39] the message but we all know the faith
[12:42] faith in God equals the power of Christ
[12:45] so faith in God will bring the power of
[12:48] Christ into your heart and into your
[12:49] life and it's not for yourself but it's
[12:53] for his kingdom and for his economy that
[12:55] he can benefit his people he uses you to
[12:59] benefit it's not something that we reach
[13:01] out in jealousy to grab for our own self
[13:04] God gives us to share with others and
[13:07] and the one thing I was also struck me
[13:09] about this uh about this message I was
[13:13] reading here in um third th thessal
[13:16] second Thessalonians the third verse I
[13:20] find as I get older I've have more time
[13:22] problems pronouncing words and he goes
[13:25] this is what Paul had to say here we
[13:28] know what the the second chapter talks
[13:30] it talks about the time Paul talks about
[13:34] this time we're in right now how the
[13:35] world has gone nuts and gone crazy and
[13:38] it goes back to what I was saying in in
[13:41] that chapter of Hagi and what brother
[13:44] Bram was talking about
[13:46] here if if you don't have the sense of
[13:49] Christ in your heart and life and you
[13:51] don't have the
[13:54] it's the blessings of God abiding upon
[13:57] you you your life will be like the world
[14:00] it'll just be a mess but when you have
[14:03] that you have something that keeps you
[14:05] on the road keeps you steady to go
[14:07] through all the trials of life and I'll
[14:10] just read what this chapter says in
[14:12] Thessalonians here it says finally
[14:14] Brethren pray for us that the word of
[14:17] the Lord may be have free course and be
[14:20] glorified even it is with you so Paul is
[14:23] telling the people just like brother
[14:25] brandham said pray for me that God will
[14:27] give me the Liberty to give back to you
[14:30] the word of God and the spirit of God
[14:32] it's all one big economy where we all
[14:35] have an equal part in it this morning
[14:37] and he goes on that you we may be able
[14:39] to deliver from unreasonable and wicked
[14:42] men for all men have not faith and we
[14:44] know that truth you can take that
[14:46] scripture and see it in the world today
[14:48] and it goes on to say but the Lord is
[14:50] faithful who will establish you and keep
[14:53] you from evil so it's not yourself
[14:55] that's going to keep you from evil but
[14:57] if you trust God God will will keep you
[14:59] from evil and he goes on to say and we
[15:01] have confidence the Lord touching you
[15:03] that you do both do and will do the
[15:06] things which you we command and the Lord
[15:09] direct your hearts into the love of God
[15:12] and into the patient waiting for Christ
[15:14] that's where're all at this morning now
[15:16] we command you brethren in the name of
[15:18] the Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw
[15:21] yourselves from every brother that
[15:22] walketh disorderly and not after the
[15:25] tradition which we received of us when I
[15:27] read that scripture I think of my uh men
[15:31] andite and uh neighbors you know that
[15:34] they use that scripture in there a lot
[15:36] right there for you yourselves know how
[15:38] we ought to follow to follow us for we
[15:41] behave not ourselves disorderly among
[15:44] you and this scripture goes back to what
[15:46] brother brandham said and what what Paul
[15:48] said you follow Christ as I follow
[15:50] Christ he gave us an example neither did
[15:53] we eat any man's bread for not but
[15:56] rought with labor and Trava night and
[15:58] day that we might not be chargeable to
[16:01] any of you so Paul was being setting the
[16:05] proper example not because we have not
[16:07] the power but make ourselves an example
[16:10] unto you to follow us for even when we
[16:13] were with
[16:14] you this we commanded you that if any
[16:18] would not work neither should he eat I
[16:20] guess if the government believed in the
[16:23] Bible that that' solve a lot of problems
[16:25] right there this morning and we go for
[16:28] here for before we hear that we are the
[16:30] same which walk among you disorderly
[16:32] working not at all but are busy buddies
[16:35] but you can read this and see the world
[16:37] we're in this morning now them which are
[16:40] are such we commanded and exal You by
[16:43] the Lord Jesus Christ that which
[16:45] quietness they work and eat their own
[16:47] bread boy the world would be a lot
[16:49] better this morning if people just live
[16:51] that little scripture right there but ye
[16:54] Brethren be not worry and well doing and
[16:57] that's a really important that's
[16:58] something I think a lot about no matter
[17:01] what people do to you no matter what the
[17:03] circumstances in your life doesn't give
[17:05] you a reason to be hateful or to be
[17:09] disrespectful to other people that's
[17:11] what Paul is saying here this morning be
[17:13] not worry and well doing you can't be no
[17:16] matter what people do to you you can't
[17:19] be afraid to keep doing the right thing
[17:21] because it's the right thing to do and
[17:23] he goes on to say if any man obey not
[17:25] our word by this epistle note that man
[17:28] and have no company with him that he may
[17:31] be
[17:32] ashamed but I guess a lot of people
[17:34] forget to keep going down with these
[17:36] other scriptures but count him not as an
[17:38] enemy but admonish him as a brother now
[17:41] the Lord of Peace himself give you peace
[17:43] Always by all means the Lord be with you
[17:46] the salutation of Paul with my own hand
[17:49] which is the token in every epistle as I
[17:52] Rise the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:55] be with you all amen and I was just
[17:57] thinking I was listening to to that
[17:59] message this morning not wanting to lose
[18:02] anything here but um brother Brandon he
[18:06] was talking about he was dealing with
[18:08] these Full Gospel ministers and it
[18:10] really struck me how he answered these
[18:13] these ministers the and I could tell to
[18:15] these ministers he didn't say it but the
[18:17] way they were talking to him they had to
[18:19] be Church of Christ so they were
[18:20] basically trying to make fun of him
[18:23] saying well we've got a hospital full of
[18:25] sick people and we got graveyards full
[18:28] of dead people if you got faith like you
[18:30] say you should be able to raise the
[18:32] graveyard and and heal every sick person
[18:34] in the hospital and I I thought his
[18:37] answer really spoke truth to what I'm
[18:39] saying this morning
[18:42] um and it he wasn't being funny he was
[18:45] being honest with him he told those
[18:46] Brothers he said he said if that's true
[18:49] are he asked him first thing he asked
[18:51] Are You full go believers do you believe
[18:54] the word of God and you know of course
[18:56] they said they did well you know what he
[18:58] said he said well let's go walk into a
[19:00] bar this morning and I want you to
[19:02] exercise your Word of Faith this morning
[19:04] and save every soul in that bar this
[19:07] morning and I thought his answer is
[19:08] really true he was actually putting it
[19:11] back on them if they had Faith to
[19:13] believe the word of God then they should
[19:15] be able to go into any place in the
[19:17] world and convert every sinner in
[19:20] whatever that place was and I think he
[19:22] caught their attention when he said that
[19:24] this morning and the only thing I'll
[19:26] finish with this thing and like like
[19:28] those quotes that I know I say this a
[19:32] lot but everything we do in life it's
[19:35] meaningless unless you got the author of
[19:38] Life yourself abiding in your heart and
[19:40] life this morning brother
[19:53] David amen you love the Lord this
[19:56] morning me let's stand if we could this
[19:59] morning and it's good to be in the house
[20:01] of the Lord isn't
[20:03] it amen and we welcome our visitors this
[20:06] morning God bless you
[20:09] and want to sing This Little Chorus and
[20:12] I thought of it this morning and before
[20:14] I do I need to make an announcement
[20:16] before I forget that and it says uh
[20:20] evening like Tabernacle Fall Festival

[20:24] 5th so just put that on your calendars
[20:28] that's the Fall Festival October the
[20:31] 5th amen this little course
[20:34] and then brother Brian said something
[20:37] and it brought it back to my memory in
[20:39] my life Lord be glorified this
[20:42] morning

[23:24] Chorus come on my heart and I tell you
[23:27] this morning the song songs and
[23:29] different things and I began
[23:32] to go back in my mind I was looking for
[23:36] a song that we're going to sing here in
[23:37] a little bit this morning and I pulled
[23:39] up a song book and it was my
[23:41] grandfather's and and I remember the
[23:44] song that they sang at my grandfather's
[23:46] funeral it was the first time I ever
[23:47] heard it brother John and sister Hannah
[23:50] and sister Sarah's family brother Bill
[23:52] used to sing it I want to stroll over
[23:54] heaven with you and I was about 14 years
[23:57] old and you know know I didn't I didn't
[24:00] have a clue what that song was I was
[24:02] just a 14-year-old kid that was
[24:05] rebellious anybody ever been there
[24:07] besides me I didn't think
[24:10] so but you know what and then I begin to
[24:12] think and and and then the thing come
[24:15] along for brother Tommy and he lost his
[24:17] grandpa and I thought you know Lord one
[24:19] of these days we're going to get to go
[24:21] home how many's ready to go home this
[24:24] morning I'm ready to go home and and I
[24:26] couldn't find the words of this song the
[24:28] Hallelujah side as I begin to go and and
[24:30] I just pushed it aside and when I come
[24:32] to church and the Lord just kind of
[24:35] spoke to my heart and I began to look
[24:36] and I found it in a song book and of
[24:38] course brother Micah and them they just
[24:41] they can do anything if you need it done
[24:43] just ask brother Micah and brother
[24:45] Carson they'll get it done for you we're
[24:47] going to sing this song this morning the
[24:48] Hallelujah side and it just began to
[24:51] speak to my heart and I just pray this
[24:53] song service will bless you this morning
[24:55] amen and this first verse is once a
[24:57] sinner far from Jesus I was perishing I
[25:02] mean was perishing I still remember that
[25:04] and brought back a lot of memories this
[25:06] morning as I begin to think about this
[25:08] song and I thought of all the how many
[25:11] years I fought him and tried to run and
[25:13] I just couldn't run any further and I'm
[25:15] glad that he was he wanted me he I was

[55:42] this morning Father to your children so
[55:44] that we could eat so that we could Feast
[55:46] at your table Lord that we could come
[55:49] and dine Lord Jesus so that we could go
[55:51] away whole father we ask God that you
[55:54] would draw us closer to you this morning
[55:57] father and that we would go out those
[55:58] doors closer to you that than what we
[56:00] were when we came in Lord we ask God
[56:03] that you would help me to get out of the
[56:05] way and be you just Express father what
[56:08] you laid on my heart God to speak to the
[56:10] people and may we receive it father this
[56:13] morning we thank you and praise you for
[56:16] all of your goodness in Jesus name amen
[56:20] amen kind of a amen it's
[56:24] certainly I can't say it isn't something
[56:26] that I've ministered before but it's
[56:28] perhaps uh taken it maybe in a little
[56:32] different way amen that's that's all I
[56:34] about I do any more days is maybe just
[56:36] preach things that I've preached amen at
[56:38] a little different angle
[56:40] amen a little bit more God just reveals
[56:43] a little bit to me a little bit more and
[56:46] so yesterday while I was praying and
[56:48] Desiring and waiting on the Lord amen he
[56:51] gave me this thought amen and so that's
[56:53] where we started from and so we'll see
[56:56] what the Lord will have but if you will
[56:57] turn to Zachariah 4 Zachariah
[57:11] 4 amen for some reason this scripture
[57:13] came to my
[57:16] mind and it's just a portion just a
[57:19] portion of a verse amen one portion of
[57:23] the verse that I want to read Zechariah
[57:25] 4 4 and verse 10 for who hath despised
[57:31] the day of small things amen may God to
[57:36] add His blessings to the reading of the
[57:37] words you can be seated amen we want to
[57:40] talk about the day of small things day
[57:44] of small things amen praise the
[57:50] Lord amen so our thought goes of course
[57:56] back Amen to why the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:00] why God Almighty would even allow
[58:04] Humanity to fall in the first place is
[58:08] that right amen the Bible says that
[58:11] God's ways are so much higher than our
[58:14] ways his thoughts are so much higher
[58:17] than our thoughts amen but with the help
[58:19] of the Lord this morning we want to try
[58:21] to tap into the way that God thinks
[58:24] ain't that right amen the way that he
[58:26] thinks and he does and I believe in over
[58:28] in Hebrews I've said it many times amen
[58:30] when uh whenever Israel would not
[58:34] believe God when they came up to the Red
[58:37] Sea or when they didn't have anything to
[58:39] eat or when they didn't have anything to
[58:41] eat drink and so forth he says you know
[58:44] that they would not God promised that
[58:45] they would not enter into my rest
[58:48] because they have not known my ways amen
[58:52] how many believes that it's important
[58:54] for us to understand God
[58:56] ways and the way that he does things
[58:59] amen amen and so when we think about let
[59:03] me just start here also think about
[59:05] little things we think about big things
[59:07] amen big things small things a day have
[59:09] small things and now of course we know
[59:11] that God is a great big
[59:14] God he's bigger God than what your mind
[59:18] can ever comprehend your finite mind
[59:20] can't understand cannot comprehend the
[59:23] how great God really is amen
[59:26] amen just the one thought is trying to
[59:29] even think of how that he could have
[59:30] always been always been you know and so
[59:35] that's just almost unfathomable but he
[59:37] always was
[59:39] amen amen and so he made a great big
[59:42] world Amen we get are fascinated by the
[59:45] galaxies isn't that right the star
[59:47] systems and so forth and amen and uh uh
[59:51] I think Micah was talking this week and
[59:53] he was kind of talking about different
[59:54] things and and and pulling up quotes
[59:57] brother Glenn and and he pulled up one
[59:59] quote that brother Bram says he Al he
[1:00:00] said that one day they'll find out that
[1:00:02] they're not seeing way out there but
[1:00:04] that they're seeing in a
[1:00:08] circle ain't that right so you know he's
[1:00:11] a great big God and just the solar just
[1:00:14] out there it's great great big things
[1:00:17] which sa a serve a great great big God
[1:00:20] Heaven is his throne Earth is his foot
[1:00:22] stol he uh he he he encumbers all space
[1:00:26] and
[1:00:27] time amen that's really big to think
[1:00:29] that he is in all space all out there
[1:00:32] and in all time he he fills all
[1:00:36] time incomprehensible right even back to
[1:00:39] the Garden of Eden all of that time he
[1:00:41] fills all time and space the future the
[1:00:43] Millennium he's out there he's already
[1:00:45] there he's he's you know he's a great
[1:00:48] big
[1:00:50] God
[1:00:51] amen amen and so so we first realize how
[1:00:56] big he really is but the other thing is
[1:01:00] one thing that our prophet of God taught
[1:01:02] us was that the one thing that about God
[1:01:05] is he is so great in that so big that he
[1:01:10] can make himself so
[1:01:12] little and because he can make himself
[1:01:14] so little is what makes him so
[1:01:17] great amen and that's what we want to
[1:01:19] talk about with the help of the Lord a
[1:01:20] little bit this morning on each
[1:01:21] individual everybody here you know cuz
[1:01:24] he talked about a lot of times he says
[1:01:25] says if you ever talk to really great
[1:01:28] men brother Brams talked a lot of Great
[1:01:30] Men He says real Great Men amen will
[1:01:34] make you feel like you're the great
[1:01:37] man is that right because uh you know he
[1:01:42] they've come come to that place to where
[1:01:44] well they know they're great so they
[1:01:47] don't have to act great so they're
[1:01:49] humble themselves and talk about you and
[1:01:52] your things and and make you feel great
[1:01:55] I might as well go here while I'm on it
[1:01:57] but a lot of times I think about myself
[1:01:59] I think you know a lot of times we'll
[1:02:01] get in a conversation and we'll talk to
[1:02:03] people ain't that right amen and
[1:02:06] sometimes folks sometimes I don't even
[1:02:08] have to talk the other person does all
[1:02:09] the talk and talks all about himself
[1:02:12] I'll just say yeah right yeah right
[1:02:15] that's that's awesome brother that's
[1:02:16] awesome and I'm like Lord help me not
[1:02:19] you know get in a conversation where I
[1:02:20] always got to talk about me me me mine
[1:02:22] mine what I do this that the other but
[1:02:24] care about the other person what about
[1:02:26] you sometimes it's better to listen than
[1:02:29] it is to do all the
[1:02:31] Talking care more about what that person
[1:02:33] that's a great person and make you feel
[1:02:36] like you're great
[1:02:37] amen amen and so that's just a little
[1:02:40] touch on Small Things become small amen
[1:02:44] the day of small things amen so God
[1:02:48] dwells of course when you think about
[1:02:50] when we think about the world the world
[1:02:51] is always looking for big things people
[1:02:55] are always trying to be
[1:02:58] great bigger better nicer this that or
[1:03:02] the other never trying to be
[1:03:05] small never trying to be
[1:03:08] little amen or small in your own
[1:03:12] sight amen so let me just tell you one
[1:03:15] thing about Humanity each and every one
[1:03:17] of us amen we are taught in the Bible
[1:03:20] that he that humbleth himself or makes
[1:03:23] himself little God will exalt
[1:03:27] but he that exalts himself boy you're
[1:03:29] going to respect me I'm going to be a
[1:03:30] great no you're going to be brought
[1:03:33] down ain't that
[1:03:35] right isn't it strange and I just begin
[1:03:38] to think about little things and how
[1:03:40] that God is in those little things like
[1:03:43] humility not Pride but
[1:03:47] humility why the world don't have think
[1:03:49] much of humility do they no they don't
[1:03:52] think much of faith when you go to a
[1:03:55] doctor and you say I'm believing for my
[1:03:56] healing praise God they like well I'm
[1:03:59] not one of them religious Fanatics you
[1:04:01] know right they frown upon Faith so
[1:04:06] that's little to them but how many knows
[1:04:07] it's a big
[1:04:10] thing amen I wrote down here why why
[1:04:14] does God Amen uh demand of us and ask of
[1:04:18] us to have
[1:04:19] faith when it would be so much easier
[1:04:22] for him to just show
[1:04:24] us for you to be able able to
[1:04:26] see with your
[1:04:29] eyes but you know what I concluded that
[1:04:31] that would be easy wouldn't
[1:04:35] it it would be
[1:04:37] easy if you could just see it and not
[1:04:40] have to believe it but God
[1:04:42] expects greater things from us he
[1:04:46] expects more from us than to have to see
[1:04:49] everything to
[1:04:51] believe
[1:04:53] amen that's right that's why it's
[1:04:56] impossible to please God without faith
[1:04:59] because if you know that he is and that
[1:05:01] he is in the invisible realm God Amen
[1:05:04] says that we live not Paul said we don't
[1:05:06] live by faith I mean by the things that
[1:05:08] we see but we believe on the things that
[1:05:10] we have not
[1:05:15] seen
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] amen so
[1:05:22] contrary are the ways that God thinks
[1:05:24] and the way that he does
[1:05:28] does than what we
[1:05:31] think so we realize as sitting
[1:05:35] here brother Tommy's Grandpa passing
[1:05:39] away death funeral homes a't that
[1:05:43] right getting old getting feeble our
[1:05:46] mind's slipping a little
[1:05:50] bit can't pronounce things the way we
[1:05:52] used to I can't hardly preach like I
[1:05:53] used to my mind ain't as fast as it used
[1:05:56] to be
[1:05:59] hello my
[1:06:00] voice sometimes I have to struggle just
[1:06:03] to have a voice you can hear the
[1:06:05] raspiness yeah even my voice is
[1:06:10] changing but all of this sickness sorrow
[1:06:14] all it was all part of God's
[1:06:18] plan part of God's plan that's right he
[1:06:21] allowed it as a matter of fact when he
[1:06:23] made Adam and Eve he knew that Eve would
[1:06:26] fall it took a a real absolute prophet
[1:06:29] of God to actually say that she he took
[1:06:31] her out of a rib because she was not the
[1:06:33] original creation but a byproduct amen
[1:06:36] and he knew that she would
[1:06:38] fall and he knew Adam would step
[1:06:41] out amen there was a purpose in
[1:06:45] it
[1:06:48] amen amen pray praise the Lord so we
[1:06:53] want to look at these small things if we
[1:06:56] can and I think we'll go to let's go
[1:07:00] to
[1:07:02] Luke
[1:07:10] six Luke
[1:07:15] six we know the birth of Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ amen the how that he was born in
[1:07:21] a manger isn't that right not in a hotel
[1:07:23] room in a big fancy place in a great
[1:07:26] luxurious thing but in a horse stable so
[1:07:29] to
[1:07:30] speak his very coming was in humility in
[1:07:36] meekness little small humble is that
[1:07:40] right that's where God dwells how many
[1:07:43] knows that God dwells in
[1:07:47] humility God doesn't dwell in great big
[1:07:50] fancy things for some reason we as
[1:07:52] humans we always have to have things
[1:07:54] fancier bigger better and all of
[1:07:58] that
[1:08:00] amen now let's just look at Jesus here
[1:08:03] now we know that he said uh that we
[1:08:06] should be as the master amen the
[1:08:10] disciples should be as the master if
[1:08:12] they persecuted me they'll persecute you
[1:08:14] if they loved you they'll if they love
[1:08:16] me they'll love you but if not you know
[1:08:18] they'll hate you like they haed me a't
[1:08:20] that right and when he begins to
[1:08:22] Proclaim blessings upon people the
[1:08:26] blessings this is in St Luke 6 and verse
[1:08:29] 20 uh verse 20 and he lifted up his eyes
[1:08:32] on his disciples and said blessed be ye
[1:08:37] poor amen for yours is the kingdom of
[1:08:42] God my wow I thought he'd make us rich I
[1:08:46] thought we'd become a multi-millionaire
[1:08:48] or he'd do great no but blessed are ye
[1:08:52] poor wow
[1:08:55] now some of the things that I'm going to
[1:08:57] say this morning is is uh something
[1:09:00] that well how do I would how would I
[1:09:03] express it something that we haven't
[1:09:04] really experienced or don't know because
[1:09:08] we're in a rich
[1:09:09] country we're lead AIA an age of
[1:09:14] riches amen I looked in my closet this
[1:09:17] morning thinking of uh all of those
[1:09:19] pairs of shoes that I've gotten you
[1:09:22] know all of those pairs of shoes all of
[1:09:24] those suits of clothes when the Apostle
[1:09:26] Paul had maybe he had to ask Timothy to
[1:09:29] bring his coat he had maybe one pair of
[1:09:31] clothes one pair of shoes you
[1:09:33] know isin that
[1:09:36] right we want to talk about Paul but
[1:09:39] instead of Rich he says poor for yours
[1:09:41] is the kingdom of God blessed are ye
[1:09:43] that hunger now for ye shall be filled
[1:09:47] blessed are ye that weep now for ye
[1:09:49] shall
[1:09:51] laugh amen so he's saying man if you're
[1:09:54] weeping and then you're sighing and
[1:09:56] crying for the Abominations and the
[1:09:58] wickedness that the worlds and end and
[1:10:00] so forth and you've got the baptism the
[1:10:02] Holy Ghost now we are blessed person
[1:10:04] you're better off weeping now cuz then
[1:10:08] later on you're going to
[1:10:10] laugh amen is it something I just comes
[1:10:14] to mind but didn't Jesus say you know
[1:10:16] the last shall be first and the first
[1:10:18] shall be last so guess what God's
[1:10:21] calling you not to be first not to be
[1:10:23] the head and all that but to be last
[1:10:28] the
[1:10:31] least the base
[1:10:34] Amen in this
[1:10:36] world because as Christians I want you
[1:10:38] to you're a special class of people
[1:10:40] called to a special walk and our future
[1:10:43] is not
[1:10:45] here our fut future is over
[1:10:49] there amen those Dark Ages those 68
[1:10:52] million Christians that died horrible
[1:10:55] deaths they were last they am mean they
[1:10:57] were burnt they were all of these things
[1:10:59] but when they come in the glory of God
[1:11:02] when they come with Jesus and all the
[1:11:04] Holy Angels all those who killed them
[1:11:07] that were first that were the boss that
[1:11:10] thought they were the dictators will
[1:11:13] look upon them and realize you know they
[1:11:15] are with God now we're first now you're
[1:11:23] last amen
[1:11:27] our glory is then not
[1:11:30] now this is man's day ain't that right
[1:11:34] this is Satan's Eden that's why you have
[1:11:37] the corruption that you
[1:11:38] do
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:48] listen part of what brought me to this
[1:11:50] and this thought was the fact that I
[1:11:52] begin to think about brother brandham
[1:11:55] and how that you all remember when he
[1:11:57] was uh in his trailer one time and the
[1:12:00] back part of his little trailer he had a
[1:12:02] little typewriter that he would send
[1:12:04] people their mails back and so forth and
[1:12:07] he thought about Billy Graham he thought
[1:12:08] about or Roberts and their big
[1:12:10] universities and they got to have tens
[1:12:12] of thousands of dollars coming in to
[1:12:15] make it every day and they can't take
[1:12:16] little meetings they got to have so much
[1:12:18] to have a meeting ain't that right they
[1:12:21] have big universities and all that they
[1:12:23] were doing and he said look at me look
[1:12:25] at this what I've got a little trailer a
[1:12:26] little
[1:12:28] typewriter I have nothing I'm
[1:12:32] little and remember but Braham said I
[1:12:34] stay little I don't want all of that
[1:12:36] because I don't want to have to do I
[1:12:37] want to be able to go to a little group
[1:12:40] of 12 or so if a God calls me to go
[1:12:42] there I believe it was Shalom isn't it
[1:12:45] the Sarah Vista back there on the back
[1:12:46] side of desert I believe it was where he
[1:12:48] preached them great message of Shalom to
[1:12:50] just a very small group of
[1:12:53] people the the Bible says uh uh
[1:13:00] uh fear not little flock for it is the
[1:13:03] Father's Good Will to give you the
[1:13:06] kingdom amen straight is the gate and
[1:13:10] narrow is the way that leads to life and
[1:13:12] few there be that find
[1:13:16] it
[1:13:17] Amen brother B I'm talking about and I
[1:13:20] want to just stop here because you know
[1:13:22] talking about poor
[1:13:28] brother brandham says I do appreciate
[1:13:31] every man that God I see poor people
[1:13:34] when they haven't got nothing and see
[1:13:35] them come up and get a nice home and an
[1:13:38] automobile and and uh you don't know how
[1:13:40] good that makes me feel just to see poor
[1:13:43] people he says I know what it's what it
[1:13:46] means to be poor I'm poor yet will die
[1:13:52] poor but what it means to me to see
[1:13:55] people when they've come up and God has
[1:13:57] blessed them it just shakes my
[1:14:00] heart you think about that you think
[1:14:03] about brother manam one time pulling off
[1:14:04] the out of meetings here because he got
[1:14:06] 10 $15,000 in debt and he promised he
[1:14:09] would never pull for money he'd never be
[1:14:11] one of them Beggars and so forth is that
[1:14:13] right course God said later on you know
[1:14:16] to for them to take up a offering and
[1:14:18] receive an offering that's okay a't that
[1:14:20] right but he didn't want no part of all
[1:14:22] of
[1:14:23] that so even brother Bram had to get his
[1:14:26] mind right about things but he didn't
[1:14:27] want all of that amen and then one time
[1:14:30] uh here's another place what yall
[1:14:32] remember uh that that big mission Bell
[1:14:35] wiy and all when God I believe somebody
[1:14:38] was healed in that in in in in that
[1:14:40] realm and somebody wanted to they had
[1:14:42] were they had $28 million I think and
[1:14:44] they wanted to give brother bam a
[1:14:46] million and a half
[1:14:48] dollars this is what he said he said I
[1:14:50] don't care what he owns sir my father
[1:14:52] owns the cattle on every Hill I don't
[1:14:55] have any need of the money see and he
[1:14:57] said I was just seeing your mother's
[1:14:58] home he said and yours here your
[1:15:01] parsonage you could use
[1:15:05] it I wonder how many message preaches
[1:15:08] would turn down a million and a half
[1:15:12] dollars they're probably millionaires
[1:15:14] already probably wouldn't even turn it
[1:15:17] down amen this wife yeah my mom needs it
[1:15:22] my family needs it I could GI this out
[1:15:23] or the other but there was a he wanted
[1:15:25] he brother Brandon was not about the
[1:15:27] money he was about your
[1:15:28] soul he was about getting you to Christ
[1:15:33] amen and said you could use it I said
[1:15:36] yes and when I need it father will give
[1:15:38] it to me I don't need it now and I
[1:15:40] refuse to look at that at it a million
[1:15:42] 500,000 in in one offering I'd rather
[1:15:45] take 50 cents or a dime from so and so

[1:18:33] certain that we can take nothing off

[1:19:39] and just that be careful be careful
[1:19:43] because if you go after that thing God
[1:19:45] will pull back God ain't in
[1:19:48] that
[1:19:51] amen one thing I've learned as a pastor
[1:19:53] here
[1:19:55] is that God builds his
[1:19:57] church God does the
[1:19:59] doing it has never got to be my
[1:20:02] carnality or myself to get into it and
[1:20:05] try to build
[1:20:06] it I want every person in here that God
[1:20:09] wants in here if he doesn't want you in
[1:20:11] here then you need to find a place where
[1:20:13] God does want
[1:20:17] you my Prophet the prophet of God taught
[1:20:19] me that each Pastor is uniquely built
[1:20:24] with his experence experience and
[1:20:25] everything for that
[1:20:30] area and I believe
[1:20:33] that and I'll I'll say this Brother Brad
[1:20:36] I believe each person sitting in the
[1:20:38] pews has to be uniquely built to sit
[1:20:40] under a crazy man like
[1:20:47] me
[1:20:50] yeah I believe
[1:20:52] it but if you're just in the will of the
[1:20:54] Lord Lord that's all we want ain't that
[1:20:56] right as long as we're in the will of
[1:20:57] the Lord we're
[1:20:59] happy and guess what we don't have to
[1:21:01] move no matter what comes or what goes
[1:21:04] no matter what storms blow and how many
[1:21:06] huff and puff and try to blow the house
[1:21:08] down and justess as me it's tried to
[1:21:10] happen it'll never happen as long as God
[1:21:12] has got our hand on
[1:21:14] us amen praise be to God so I think I
[1:21:18] thought that you might like that amen I
[1:21:20] thought that's right not that be have be
[1:21:22] big homes and popular but just pray that
[1:21:24] I can stay in the hands of God mold clay

[1:27:05] you if you're a Christian you better
[1:27:08] expect
[1:27:09] it Paul said all that live Godly in
[1:27:12] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:27:15] persecution Jesus is telling you here
[1:27:17] the way that it's going to go
[1:27:20] amen so you're going to be ashamed or
[1:27:23] you're not going to be ashamed I'm not
[1:27:24] going to be ashamed I'm not I'm never
[1:27:26] going to be
[1:27:28] ashamed to say God sent a prophet in
[1:27:30] this generation any Christian any person
[1:27:33] out there God has sent a prophet in this
[1:27:35] generation and you need to hear him it's
[1:27:37] up to you whether you want to or
[1:27:39] not but Jesus didn't come and do all
[1:27:41] this amen for us not to tell the world
[1:27:45] about
[1:27:46] it that which you hear Proclaim on the
[1:27:49] housetop amen so I thought about this I
[1:27:52] thought wow even there as you can
[1:27:55] see will
[1:27:58] be the
[1:28:00] last in this world not first Not Top Dog
[1:28:09] amen First
[1:28:21] Corinthians I think I will cover another
[1:28:23] area while I'm covering it before I go
[1:28:26] into this other direction and I believe
[1:28:28] it's found in uh Luke 19 let's go to
[1:28:31] Luke 19
[1:28:33] first actually yeah Luke
[1:28:38] 19 this has to do with the way that we
[1:28:41] handle
[1:28:43] money and I believe it's not just about
[1:28:46] money but it's about any detail of our
[1:28:48] life
[1:28:50] okay um Luke 19
[1:28:55] we read the story of how a nobleman went
[1:28:58] into a far country and he gave his uh
[1:29:01] servants 10 servants he gave him 10
[1:29:03] pounds and so
[1:29:05] forth but then in verse 16 when he came
[1:29:09] back then came the first saying
[1:29:13] Lord thy pound hath gained me 10
[1:29:16] pounds and he said unto him well done
[1:29:19] thou servant thou has been faithful in a
[1:29:24] very
[1:29:26] little very
[1:29:29] little have thou authority over 10
[1:29:34] cities how many believe he faithful to
[1:29:36] be it's we need to be faithful in the
[1:29:39] little
[1:29:41] things faithful in the little things God
[1:29:43] sees the Small
[1:29:46] Things
[1:29:49] amen he had 10 pounds and he
[1:29:52] gained no thy pound pound has gained me
[1:29:54] 10
[1:29:55] PB so he took one pound took a dollar
[1:29:59] and turned it into 10 took a 100 and
[1:30:02] turned it into a thousand
[1:30:04] amen took a thousand and turned it into
[1:30:09] 10,000 all
[1:30:11] right and the second came saying thy
[1:30:13] pound has gained me five pounds he also
[1:30:15] likewise said unto him be thou also over
[1:30:18] five cities and another came saying Lord
[1:30:21] hold here this thy p i hel here this p
[1:30:24] and kept it laid up in an app and of
[1:30:25] course we know what happened to him he
[1:30:27] said take what he had give it to
[1:30:28] somebody
[1:30:31] else
[1:30:32] amen so we see here he says that even in
[1:30:36] talking about
[1:30:39] money in Luke 16 and verse 10 it says he
[1:30:42] that is faithful in that which is the
[1:30:45] least Is Us Faithful also in
[1:30:49] much he that is unjust in the least is
[1:30:54] unjust also in
[1:30:58] much how many beli it's important to be
[1:31:01] right in the little things Lord help us
[1:31:03] to do the things that's right in the
[1:31:05] little
[1:31:07] things now something else I wrote down
[1:31:09] here about small small the day of small
[1:31:13] things even God's voice that leads you
[1:31:18] that guides you is called a
[1:31:22] still small

[1:31:30] you to don't do that do this do this you
[1:31:32] know he could tell us he could be
[1:31:34] audible but he don't want it to be that
[1:31:36] easy he wants you to have to
[1:31:40] listen how mean you got to
[1:31:43] listen I got to us ministers we got to
[1:31:45] listen we got to listen hard Lord what
[1:31:48] would you speak to the people

[1:31:57] will just
[1:31:58] speak
[1:32:01] amen our daily lives we need that small
[1:32:04] still voice God loves when you believe
[1:32:08] in him even though you don't see it even
[1:32:11] though you don't hear it audibly yet you
[1:32:13] hear it in here something here speaks to
[1:32:16] you

[1:32:24] amen yesterday I think Grace was at the
[1:32:26] table and I said day of small things the
[1:32:30] day of small things that's what the Lord

[1:32:46] that which is at least is also in so if
[1:32:48] you'll be faithful in little things
[1:32:50] you'll be faithful in much how many
[1:32:52] believes that God cares of he talking
[1:32:54] about money I mean he wants you to be
[1:32:56] faithful with your money he wants you to
[1:32:58] spend your money right folks there's
[1:33:01] been time that I've been in
[1:33:03] debt and and and instead of paying a
[1:33:06] debt I'd go buy something
[1:33:08] else that's not a good way to do it but
[1:33:12] I said Lord I'm going to take this money
[1:33:13] another time I'm gonna take this money
[1:33:15] I'm gonna pay off my bill I'm gonna pay
[1:33:16] this bill off and you wouldn't believe
[1:33:18] the money did come afterwards I'm like
[1:33:19] boy thank you
[1:33:21] Lord why cuz God knows how you use your
[1:33:24] money if he's pleased with how you use
[1:33:26] money he'll give you more do the right
[1:33:29] thing
[1:33:31] amen I preach on money for some reason
[1:33:33] this morning but but isn't it true that
[1:33:36] uh a person you can be
[1:33:39] poor and yet you can have thousands of
[1:33:41] dollars in the bank poor people can have
[1:33:44] plenty of money in the bank if they
[1:33:45] manage it
[1:33:46] right but other people they can make
[1:33:48] pretty good money and not have a dime
[1:33:50] and be in debt up to your neck and
[1:33:52] everything else why because because you
[1:33:54] don't want man it's your money
[1:33:56] right we all know that you could be a
[1:33:59] millionaire you'd still be
[1:34:02] broke you're broke with whatever you
[1:34:04] have if you was a millionaire you'd
[1:34:06] still end up
[1:34:08] broke why it's because you don't manage
[1:34:10] it right you don't use it the way that
[1:34:12] you ought to but you can be poor and
[1:34:14] still be in good
[1:34:15] shape praise the Lord anyway that's free
[1:34:19] free monetary advice
[1:34:21] today pay your bills and instead of
[1:34:24] spending it on something else yet if
[1:34:26] you've got
[1:34:27] them praise the Lord be content with
[1:34:30] what God gave you maybe he'll give you
[1:34:32] more use it right you'll be
[1:34:36] rewarded amen praise the Lord now let's
[1:34:40] look at little things base things humble
[1:34:44] things
[1:34:45] nothings
[1:34:48] amen 1
[1:34:50] Corinthians
[1:34:52] 1 1 Corinthians
[1:35:03] 1 how many knows that God most of the
[1:35:06] time and a lot of times calls to use in
[1:35:09] his Service Little

[1:35:15] David was not a big man Samson wasn't
[1:35:17] this Hercules they were already little

[1:35:26] use greatly wasn't it Moody I believe

[1:38:40] the Holy Ghost and all that stuff like
[1:38:43] that before Pentecostal people he walked

[1:38:55] masterly fix and he could just explain
[1:38:57] the Bible away and God didn't know
[1:39:00] nothing about it and the first thing you
[1:39:03] know it didn't take with the people he

[1:50:34] even brother Bram says a preacher will
[1:50:36] get up there preaching and he'll be
[1:50:38] humble and after a while he thinks he's
[1:50:39] a somebody and raise up and uh oh we fix
[1:50:42] to have a fall it's easy to rise above

[1:51:14] what God loves to do he wants to prove
[1:51:17] us he wants to try us so he guess what
[1:51:20] he can't always let things be
[1:51:24] easy he allows things to get hard for a
[1:51:28] reason he allows trials you come your
[1:51:31] way to see what you'll do about
[1:51:33] it we know that because when he led
[1:51:36] Israel out of the land of Egypt the
[1:51:37] first thing he did is put him in a dead
[1:51:39] end right down to the Red Sea got him
[1:51:41] between some rocks and down in there
[1:51:43] couldn't go forward backwards couldn't
[1:51:44] go any which way and let him sit
[1:51:48] there he'll bring you to a hard place
[1:51:50] sometime between rocks and hard places
[1:51:52] to see what you'll
[1:51:53] do will you really have that which the
[1:51:56] world despises called Faith or not it
[1:51:59] may be little to the world but it's big
[1:52:01] to a Christian and it's big to God faith
[1:52:04] is Big to
[1:52:08] God and you got to have it to believe in
[1:52:12] the Unseen
[1:52:13] amen praise the
[1:52:20] Lord amen
[1:52:23] I'm just going to say what comes to mind
[1:52:25] wasn't brother brandham given a
[1:52:27] Cadillac and he just sat in the
[1:52:30] garage just sit in the garage just sat
[1:52:33] there he didn't want to rrive a
[1:52:34] Cadillac that mean you can't have a
[1:52:36] Cadillac I'm not saying that I'm just
[1:52:38] saying he didn't want to drive around in
[1:52:40] the
[1:52:41] Cadillac he went and preached to poor
[1:52:43] people over in Arkansas and everywhere
[1:52:44] else and he comes pulling up in the
[1:52:47] beautiful Cadillac wow that preacher is
[1:52:49] driving a nice
[1:52:50] car if it's just way he
[1:52:55] was
[1:52:57] amen it came to mind so I said it is
[1:53:00] that all right Lord help
[1:53:04] us humble ourselves can we humble
[1:53:10] ourselves amen praise the Lord
[1:53:14] okay so oh what a preacher this great
[1:53:18] man who sought God he said God I am weak
[1:53:23] I don't know what to do I just pray God
[1:53:26] strengthen me take my infirmities away
[1:53:28] from me and these things so I can be
[1:53:30] stronger and God spoke back to him said
[1:53:32] Paul my strength is made perfect in your
[1:53:37] weakness and Paul said I will glory then
[1:53:41] in my
[1:53:42] infirmities let me go can I take a
[1:53:44] little more time where it's time time's
[1:53:46] up already can I go a little longer this
[1:53:48] morning we'll go overtime this morning
[1:53:50] that all right
[1:53:52] M so Paul said he's going to
[1:53:55] glory in his hardships in his
[1:54:00] infirmities he said here into chapter
[1:54:02] four of 1 Corinthians verse 9 I think
[1:54:05] that God has set forth us Apostles last
[1:54:09] well the scripture for before that he
[1:54:11] says now ye are full now ye are rich now
[1:54:13] you have reigned as kings without us and
[1:54:15] I would to God that you did Reign that
[1:54:17] we might also reign with you but I think
[1:54:18] that God has set forth the apostles last
[1:54:21] as it were appointed unto death we are
[1:54:24] made a spectacle unto the world and to
[1:54:27] angels and to Men We are fools for
[1:54:30] Christ's
[1:54:32] sakes but ye are wise in Christ we are
[1:54:35] weak but ye are strong ye are honorable
[1:54:37] but we are despised even un this present
[1:54:40] hour we both hunger and thirst and are
[1:54:44] naked and are Buffet it and have no
[1:54:48] Dwelling Place
[1:54:52] thank God for what you have if you don't
[1:54:54] leave not with nothing else this morning
[1:54:56] you thank God for what he has what you
[1:54:58] have and be thankful for the grace of
[1:55:00] God that we aren't having to go out
[1:55:02] there and be shot and persecuted and
[1:55:05] burned at the stake how many believes we
[1:55:07] ought to be thankful for what God's
[1:55:09] given us CU those disciples on down
[1:55:12] through the ark eight you was not promis
[1:55:15] any kind of a flowery bed of
[1:55:17] ease
[1:55:19] amen don't allow your ease
[1:55:23] and how easy you do have it to drown out
[1:55:27] the Lord Jesus Christ do not allow the
[1:55:29] love of money to keep you from
[1:55:33] church to keep you doing the way that
[1:55:35] you're supposed to do because you're not
[1:55:37] supposed to have the people love money
[1:55:39] that's that's what's evil the love of
[1:55:41] money is the root of all not money
[1:55:43] itself but the love of it got to have
[1:55:46] it got to have it I don't care what it
[1:55:48] cost me what I got to do how hard I got
[1:55:50] to work ain't nothing wrong with believe
