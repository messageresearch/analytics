[16:30] morning
[16:32] hallelujah hallelujah all right let's
[16:35] stand together get right into the
[16:37] preaching of the word
[16:38] i just love to worship the lord but the
[16:40] word's more important
[16:41] and i could go on like that all day long
[16:43] singing one song after another and
[16:45] anybody that knows me
[16:47] knows i love to sing and play and
[16:49] worship god but
[16:50] thank god we got a bible this morning we
[16:52] can look into
[16:53] thank god we've got a text we can read
[16:55] and we got a message we can bring thank
[16:56] god for it
[16:58] amen if you got your book with you now
[17:00] second timothy chapter three
[17:02] i'd like to look at verse 1 the lord
[17:04] helping us and i i want to read
[17:06] several verses god willing and uh what i
[17:09] want to try to do if the lord will help
[17:10] me is i want to speak to you on
[17:12] bride war bride war
[17:15] sounds like an odd subject on it but uh
[17:18] there is a bride war going on and i
[17:21] don't mean just ebride
[17:22] but i mean the bride there's a bride and
[17:24] bride going on in warring right now
[17:27] and uh different ones are calling
[17:29] themselves the bride in this day
[17:31] but there is one she is the real one
[17:35] she is the elected predestinated one
[17:38] she's the one that god's got his hand on
[17:41] and will continue to have his hand on
[17:43] and i believe somehow we are part of
[17:45] that program and wouldn't be sitting
[17:46] here today
[17:47] amen and i'm not going to believe we're
[17:48] on the other side of it i'm going to be
[17:50] on the good side of it ain't that right
[17:51] now second timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[17:54] before we read before i forget i almost
[17:56] failed to mention this pray for me i go
[17:58] the 11th i have a dye test done on my
[18:00] eyes
[18:01] they found some diabetic retinopathy in
[18:04] my eyes from
[18:05] high sugars and things and and i will
[18:08] say that the lord's already touched my
[18:10] body in many different ways and things
[18:11] are
[18:12] changing in a way that i can't even
[18:14] begin to explain to you but i need the
[18:16] lord's help in it because i started
[18:17] having a little
[18:18] issue with that right eye just a bit and
[18:20] um
[18:21] some swelling has set up in that eye and
[18:24] i've got some
[18:24] possible he said maybe some possible
[18:26] bleeders in the left
[18:28] eye but what was funny about that
[18:31] and i was kind of laughing to myself at
[18:33] how good the lord is
[18:34] i went to one guy when he first
[18:36] diagnosed it he looked in the left eye
[18:37] and he said well you got hemorrhaging
[18:39] all over that eye
[18:40] and jonathan you know he lives right
[18:42] across the street from me i mean
[18:43] literally i walked to his house
[18:45] in 10 seconds and probably less than
[18:47] that trippy told us across the street
[18:49] and um i was staying out in the yard
[18:50] didn't know what to do and i said well
[18:52] you got to preach across the street
[18:53] from your dummy call him you know that's
[18:55] just mine how you think
[18:57] so i rang him i said come out here and
[18:58] pray for me he did
[19:01] and uh i felt like the lord moved for me
[19:03] well within about
[19:04] 12 days after that visit i went to this
[19:06] specialist and he said
[19:07] maybe i suspect you might have maybe
[19:10] some bleeders in that left eye
[19:11] so i feel like the lord's already moving
[19:13] but listen folks i don't know how to say
[19:15] this and please
[19:16] please please i know i know you'll
[19:18] probably mean best and you'll want to
[19:20] help me and you'll want to
[19:21] offer me every vitamin every piece of
[19:23] advice you can give me
[19:24] just pray for me please and understand
[19:26] this when i tell you this
[19:28] the bottom line is this is a battle i've
[19:30] got to win
[19:31] and it's been something i've been up
[19:32] against for eight years and i haven't
[19:35] done very good at winning it i've had
[19:36] victories i've had losses i've had on
[19:39] either side of it but
[19:40] i want you folks to i got confidence in
[19:42] y'all's prayers i really do and
[19:43] i believe if you pray for me i believe
[19:45] the lord will help me in it and
[19:47] will you pray for me will you do it
[19:49] thank you i can't lose my eyes i got i
[19:51] got too many things going on i need them
[19:52] amen i got people to preach to and i got
[19:54] scriptures to read and
[19:56] and you say well are you better than the
[19:58] apostle paul
[19:59] no no i'm really not if god chose to let
[20:01] me have trouble like at the rest of my
[20:03] day
[20:03] that'd be all right but i don't want it
[20:04] to be self-afflicted either amen
[20:06] amen i want the lord to help me with it
[20:08] all right
[20:10] now that i got y'all feeling so happy
[20:11] let's read the bible second timothy
[20:13] chapter three verse one bright war
[20:15] this know also that in the last days
[20:18] perilous times
[20:19] shall come and we know that word
[20:21] perilous actually means
[20:22] dangerous dangerous times shall come now
[20:25] let's look and see what's
[20:26] dangerous about this age for men shall
[20:29] be lovers of their own self
[20:31] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[20:33] disobedient to parents
[20:35] unthankful unholy without natural
[20:38] affection truce breakers false accusers
[20:40] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[20:42] that are good traity heady high-minded
[20:44] lovers of pleasure
[20:45] more than lovers of god good lord what a
[20:48] wicked bunch
[20:49] that's awful ain't it uh read one more
[20:53] verse
[20:56] y'all getting it having a form of
[20:58] godliness
[21:00] so you mean to tell me these people we
[21:02] read about the church folk
[21:06] that's exactly what it is now on the
[21:08] outside they should
[21:09] you know they show forth a good image or
[21:11] some kind of a spiritual type
[21:13] way about them but really on the inside
[21:15] all of this stuff is hiding in there
[21:17] now listen you folks ain't always been
[21:19] christians you've been out in the world
[21:20] before haven't you
[21:22] haven't you ever heard people say that
[21:23] church people are the meanest people you
[21:25] ever meet in your life
[21:28] you don't think so ask a waitress
[21:31] she's the one that knows when we get
[21:32] done at them restaurants we don't never
[21:33] leave her the right kind of tea for him
[21:35] we let we leave all kinds of messes
[21:37] under the table oh god you're getting
[21:38] quiet already
[21:40] and yet you women walking under that
[21:42] long hair and them long dresses
[21:44] on and you men that make a lot of money
[21:45] or make enough money you don't even drop
[21:46] a dollar on the table because
[21:48] you know you just don't believe in that
[21:49] sort of thing
[21:52] but you do believe in wrecking the place
[21:53] and walking out with that long hair and
[21:54] long dress following you
[21:56] you know it ain't right it ain't right
[21:58] what do they say when they walk out
[22:00] them christian people are the worst the
[22:03] bible said so
[22:05] because on the outside they put forth a
[22:07] good front but all of this brother brad
[22:09] is hiding right down inside of that
[22:10] heart right there if they're not born
[22:11] again of the holy spirit
[22:12] that's what you're looking at with
[22:13] people in church traitors
[22:15] heady high-minded lovers on and on and
[22:18] on and on and on
[22:19] and having a form of godliness
[22:23] amen bride war let's pray lord jesus we
[22:26] love you so much
[22:28] father it's a privilege to be here in
[22:29] the house of god
[22:31] lord as we bow our heads to you we
[22:33] already feel the anointing of the holy
[22:35] spirit in this place and we know you
[22:36] have been with us from the very
[22:38] opening scripture that was read from the
[22:39] opening prayer as lord you promised
[22:42] where two and three are gathered you'll
[22:43] be right there
[22:44] in the midst of your believing children
[22:46] and the saints of god
[22:47] and father we're praying now that you'll
[22:49] come and take this text and these words
[22:51] and things that i've assembled here
[22:53] by the best of my ability lord i do what
[22:55] i can to follow what i believe is you
[22:57] but lord i trust you that if you need to
[23:00] speak something that ain't on this paper
[23:01] in front of me
[23:02] you take my mouth lord my mind my
[23:04] thoughts i yield it to you to use any
[23:06] way you desire
[23:07] lord may you edify us our coming
[23:09] together and may the holy spirit now
[23:10] grant to us your favor heal all the sick
[23:12] and afflicted
[23:13] be with everyone streaming online those
[23:15] will see the service later at some point
[23:17] maybe
[23:18] lord if they can't join us at this very
[23:20] moment say they've got a need lord
[23:22] god may the same holy spirit fall two
[23:24] hours from now as it would fall right
[23:26] now in the service and
[23:27] may your anointing just go right through
[23:28] that channel and bless everyone
[23:30] in divine presence that will come under
[23:32] the auspice of the word now
[23:33] as we commit this to you now both
[23:35] speaker and listener in the name of
[23:37] jesus christ
[23:38] amen and amen and all the saints said
[23:40] amen
[23:41] god bless you may be seated now hold
[23:45] your bible right there ii timothy don't
[23:46] get too far from you now because we're
[23:48] going to really
[23:49] really dig on this part right here and
[23:52] by the way when i went to get my eye
[23:54] test done the other day with my glasses
[23:56] on which i just got a slight stigmatism
[23:58] that girl said well i don't know what
[23:59] the big deal is you're reading 20 20.
[24:01] hallelujah anyhow we we thank the lord
[24:05] that
[24:05] whenever we have the opportunity to look
[24:07] at scriptures like this
[24:08] that we don't have to be in the dark
[24:10] about it that there is a true
[24:12] understanding
[24:13] of what it is that we're reading because
[24:15] of the visitation of
[24:17] this last day and because of the message
[24:19] of the hour we can look at these
[24:20] scriptures like this and have a clear
[24:22] understanding about what it means to you
[24:24] and i
[24:25] because i do believe with all of my
[24:27] heart that what we are seeing
[24:29] unfold around us and not just in the
[24:32] world
[24:32] on the outside but what we're seeing
[24:34] unfold even in the ranks of the church
[24:37] is everything that paul prophesied to us
[24:39] and this is prophecy
[24:41] about what would take place in the last
[24:43] days and the condition of man's heart
[24:45] and the idea that he has about uh you
[24:48] know humanity and life
[24:50] and love and politics and all that he
[24:53] is is just it's just going to bleed into
[24:55] every area of life whether it be in
[24:57] church whether it be in politics whether
[24:59] it be in
[25:00] whatever it is and uh you know when uh
[25:03] as some folks know uh you know brother
[25:05] brad he's worked in some political
[25:07] arenas before and he knows that you know
[25:10] it's the type of person it's not the
[25:12] politic
[25:13] it's the person that's behind the thing
[25:15] as to whether they're going to be
[25:16] genuine and they're going to have
[25:18] a real conviction about something and of
[25:20] course
[25:21] you go up so high with that and as
[25:22] brother branham said you could put like
[25:24] an abraham lincoln or somebody in the
[25:25] office now
[25:26] and because people are so evil in their
[25:29] heart and they entertain that so deeply
[25:32] no matter what you would say about it
[25:34] the devil has so
[25:35] legalized sin and made it such a on the
[25:38] front
[25:39] in the beginning in your face type deal
[25:41] that it would be almost
[25:42] impossible to squash out many of these
[25:45] unrighteous things that we see
[25:46] unfolding before us today in politics
[25:48] and in religion
[25:49] all these different arenas so we know
[25:52] that the reason of this is
[25:53] is the same as it was in the days of
[25:55] noah that the imagination of
[25:58] of every man and every woman their
[26:00] thoughts
[26:01] their intentions their ideas their
[26:03] mindsets
[26:04] was upon as the bible said evil
[26:07] continually
[26:08] day and night now paul gives the
[26:10] contrast to that
[26:11] when he tells you and i that what
[26:13] several things are lovely whatsoever
[26:15] things are holy
[26:16] whatsoever things of good report to
[26:18] think on those things and that word that
[26:20] he uses their thank in the greek
[26:22] is logismo which means to calculate to
[26:25] compute
[26:26] to reckon to count not just once but to
[26:29] do it again
[26:30] and again and again and again and again
[26:33] so if you have something
[26:34] of good report you should meditate on it
[26:37] you should think on it day and night it
[26:39] should be at the forefront of your mind
[26:41] rather than all of the politics and all
[26:43] the scandals and
[26:44] all those other i think what we're going
[26:45] to find out one of these days
[26:47] is that the majority of the things that
[26:49] we have seen transpire
[26:50] in just 20 20 alone has been the product
[26:53] of evil men with all of this inside of
[26:55] their heart
[26:56] that are trying to sway the world in a
[26:59] direction
[27:00] toward the marking of the beast i mean
[27:02] let's just be honest all it took
[27:04] was for one virus now listen you we've
[27:07] heard about the cold war and some of we
[27:09] uh you know some of us we lived through
[27:10] the time of the cold war
[27:12] i'm a 70s baby so i come up during the
[27:14] time when reagan and all them guys were
[27:16] working on all that
[27:17] and and you know we hear about russia
[27:19] and their bombs and we read those quotes
[27:21] by the tom
[27:22] about russia's got a a a bomb with our
[27:24] name on us got our number on it
[27:26] but we don't wake up of a morning and
[27:28] throw on a mask and sanitize our hands
[27:30] and go around in mortal fear that
[27:32] somebody's going to push the button
[27:34] we don't worry about those type of
[27:35] things because to us it's not really
[27:37] that kind of reality
[27:39] but all it took was one virus to get out
[27:42] one respiratory virus to get out amongst
[27:44] the public
[27:45] and circle through the world and the
[27:47] entire world went on lockdown
[27:49] within a few weeks time and brother that
[27:51] lets you know that the coming of the
[27:52] lord
[27:53] can be so quick and all of the events of
[27:55] prophet
[27:56] prophecy can come together so quickly
[28:00] that you may not think to yourself oh
[28:01] well there's no way that this could
[28:03] happen and that could happen and all
[28:04] there's got to be a woman vice president
[28:06] and a woman present and there's got to
[28:08] be
[28:08] this that and the other and let me tell
[28:09] you something when god pulls the trigger
[28:12] on this thing
[28:12] it will move so quickly it'll make
[28:14] corona look like it's standing
[28:16] still because all of the events of life
[28:19] are
[28:19] are are propelled forward in a certain
[28:22] direction and brother joe god's got an
[28:23] image in his mind
[28:25] of what the end looks like and what the
[28:27] last moment looks like
[28:28] and all the events are working toward
[28:31] that moment
[28:32] amen don't ever forget the lord jesus
[28:34] still has
[28:35] all of this world and everything around
[28:37] us right in the palm of his hand
[28:39] amen he's got the whole world in his
[28:42] hands
[28:44] absolutely right and then you look at
[28:46] the arena of politics and you look at
[28:48] the elements of
[28:49] all the politicians and you know of
[28:50] course all of them have got the answer
[28:53] amen and when trump was in and he was at
[28:55] the forefront of the thing you know he
[28:56] had all the answers and when obama was
[28:58] there he had all the answers and when
[29:00] reagan was there
[29:01] he had all the answers and when clinton
[29:03] was there he had all the answers they
[29:05] all got the answer
[29:06] to a problem that they never can seem to
[29:08] fix
[29:10] and you understand why that is because
[29:12] god is allowing it to remain
[29:14] in such an utter confusion that the only
[29:17] way it can ever be straightened out
[29:19] is for one supernatural leader to step
[29:22] on the forefront
[29:23] and to take control of the whole thing
[29:25] and that's what's being set up in rome
[29:27] right now as we speak
[29:28] amen that pope sitting over there may
[29:30] not be the guy
[29:31] because the bible tells us that the pope
[29:34] the beast that will rise up
[29:35] to take over the world economy to take
[29:37] over the world system
[29:38] it'll rise up out of the united states
[29:41] did you see what happened the other day
[29:42] they just got through putting i think it
[29:44] was eight or ten cardinals
[29:45] from the united states of america in a
[29:47] position to where if something happens
[29:50] to this pope
[29:51] they can elect from that pool of
[29:52] cardinals don't forget what brother
[29:54] bannon said
[29:54] and acts of the holy spirit 1954 that
[29:57] one day a pope would rise up
[29:59] out of the united states it's according
[30:01] to prophecy he said
[30:03] revelation 13 11 that that beast would
[30:06] rise
[30:06] out of the earth which is the united
[30:08] states 13 stars 13 stripes
[30:11] 13th chapter and it would raise up to
[30:14] take over all now
[30:15] now the people will say our politics
[30:17] have failed
[30:18] and our governments have failed and we
[30:20] can't seem to find resolution about
[30:22] anything
[30:23] but remember when this man rises up the
[30:26] bible said in the book of daniel
[30:28] that he will cause craft or
[30:30] manufacturing to prosper
[30:33] what a better time for them to step in
[30:35] on something like right now
[30:37] when manufacturing has taken such a hit
[30:39] over this little demonology thing
[30:42] resort somebody when all of the world
[30:45] economy has taken such a bus
[30:47] all it takes is for mr biden
[30:49] president-elect to get in there
[30:51] and hot shot himself around and shut us
[30:53] down for about another month and we are
[30:54] completely
[30:55] bankrupt we never survive another time i
[30:57] don't think
[30:59] what a better situation for mama to step
[31:01] right in and say
[31:02] we'll pay your bills we've got all the
[31:05] money you need to pay you out of debt
[31:07] we'll take care of you
[31:08] oh sure she will for an exchange of
[31:11] course
[31:12] as economists one of the first rule of
[31:14] economics and if you've ever done it in
[31:16] college young people or older people
[31:18] middle age if you ever been a college
[31:19] folk
[31:19] took economics what is rule number one
[31:22] there is no such thing as a free lunch
[31:25] somebody pays the piper somewhere and i
[31:29] guarantee they've got our answer all
[31:31] right but it comes at a heavy price
[31:33] you won't be able to buy nor sell
[31:36] unless of course you are supportive of
[31:39] their agenda
[31:41] and can't you see what's taking place
[31:42] right now look at the attitude people
[31:45] have if you dare go in public
[31:47] without a mask on
[31:51] and then the ones that's got a mask on
[31:53] they're on the other side of it
[31:55] you look at the attitude of people they
[31:58] are coming to such a unified
[32:00] way of thinking now friend whether you
[32:02] wear a mascara don't worry about it
[32:03] that's up to you i do
[32:05] where it's a bunch of come walking in
[32:06] the office tom's center looking at me
[32:10] now you can wear one sure no problem but
[32:14] the guy that don't think you should wear
[32:15] one
[32:17] he's got a clan too he's got a group
[32:20] that thinks you're completely out of
[32:21] your mind
[32:23] uh and then the other side going i can't
[32:25] believe they won't follow the cdc
[32:28] another group saying they're a bunch of
[32:29] nonsense all it takes
[32:31] is for this virus or some kind of
[32:33] situation to get bad enough that it
[32:35] causes both sides
[32:37] to unify and they will drop all of their
[32:41] pettiness
[32:42] especially if it means their money lord
[32:45] you all are getting quiet
[32:47] now you do listen to tapes right read
[32:49] books william branham you know him don't
[32:51] mountain okay
[32:52] because all this i'm talking to you
[32:53] about it's coming right out of the
[32:54] message i don't know
[32:55] now remember these things that are going
[32:57] to transpire is the same as it was in
[32:59] the days of jesus you remember
[33:01] pilate and herod historically speaking
[33:04] not even biblically
[33:05] historically speaking pilate and herod
[33:08] hated each other so deeply
[33:10] that it's never been recorded to have a
[33:12] more bitter revi
[33:14] uh a rival except for maybe the
[33:15] hatfields and the mccoys
[33:18] they absolutely so despise one another
[33:22] that even the name of the other was said
[33:24] to cause them to spit on the ground
[33:28] and yet when jesus stood before him and
[33:30] pilates all you know what the bible said
[33:33] that there was an alliance or a
[33:34] friendship made between pilate and herod
[33:38] because of jesus a common cause
[33:41] caused them to drop all of their
[33:43] politics and their
[33:44] this that and the other and come
[33:45] together as one
[33:47] against this one lord jesus christ
[33:49] claiming to be the messiah the king and
[33:51] the jews
[33:52] it caused them to so unify amen
[33:56] until these two men that hated each
[33:58] other found a mutual advantage
[34:00] in destroying the life of jesus christ
[34:04] you know the world is heading there you
[34:06] know why
[34:07] because they're getting a mind and
[34:10] they're getting a mind that comes
[34:12] directly from the devil himself
[34:15] the bride is getting christ's mind
[34:18] don't you think so i mean i sure hope
[34:20] that's what all this church and this
[34:21] preaching's about
[34:22] i hope we're not just sitting here
[34:23] warming up his pews and just doing a
[34:25] little religion for the day
[34:27] i sure hope and believe in john i hope
[34:29] the idea is that when we're sitting here
[34:30] that we're getting just a little bit
[34:32] more of the mind of christ than what we
[34:34] had before
[34:35] i'm sure believing that's a purpose what
[34:38] do you all reckon happens when people
[34:39] watch a new movie
[34:41] or read something in the paper don't you
[34:42] realize what's happening the message and
[34:45] the mind of the devil
[34:46] is being communicated in shaping
[34:48] people's thinking
[34:50] this it's not that you can't pick up a
[34:52] newspaper and uh you know i mean we're
[34:53] not careful we're going to be
[34:54] cursing everything's going to be the
[34:56] devil before we get out of here
[34:58] this is the reason in the token
[34:59] brotherhood said to throw out newspapers
[35:01] and to throw
[35:02] out television the idea wasn't that the
[35:04] television itself is going to send you
[35:06] to hell
[35:07] but in other words stop being such a
[35:09] ponzi to it
[35:10] or a patsy which one that's yeah that's
[35:12] the word
[35:14] quit believing everything you read and
[35:16] hear
[35:17] oh you're getting quieter and quieter
[35:19] buddy i know you got you thinking i know
[35:20] i'm not where i need to be
[35:22] i'll just you don't have to answer me
[35:24] but how many of you during the during
[35:25] the actual shutdown during quarantine
[35:28] the more you read the news the more
[35:30] scary it got
[35:32] oh there's a few of you want a minute
[35:35] joe i'm with you boy
[35:37] i mean you got to look you think what in
[35:38] the world is going on i wondered are we
[35:40] on the eve of the tribulation period
[35:43] you did too don't you look at me like
[35:44] that we got all of these quotes laying
[35:47] here from brother adam if there was any
[35:48] group at all
[35:49] that was wondering what was going to
[35:50] take place next it was this bride i
[35:52] guarantee you that
[35:54] especially with this woman vice
[35:55] president coming up
[35:58] it makes everybody start going what's
[36:00] going on
[36:02] huh and all of that was projected to us
[36:06] where from the bible
[36:09] from the pulpit did you get your fear
[36:12] because you come to
[36:13] sunday church or brother tom said oh
[36:15] church i don't know what we're going to
[36:16] do
[36:18] did you read that from where where peter
[36:20] said glory to god church we're hopeless
[36:23] you won't find such things as that word
[36:25] of god you sure didn't get it from the
[36:27] pulpit you sure didn't get it from the
[36:28] servants of the lord
[36:29] and you didn't get you didn't get that
[36:31] way by pushing play
[36:33] where did them thoughts come from hello
[36:37] come from the devil satan was implanting
[36:41] his mind
[36:42] and his influence upon you and i and oh
[36:45] because we're all connected
[36:48] and alone together our minds
[36:53] pretty much in sync oh there's a cloud
[36:57] all right but it ain't got nothing to do
[36:58] with microsoft google dropbox or nothing
[37:00] guys
[37:01] it's a cloud all right it's one of them
[37:02] dark ones
[37:05] and he's got everything he needs stored
[37:07] in that all you got to do is tap
[37:09] into some of the media now friends i'm
[37:11] not telling you to take a shotgun to
[37:12] your television i'm not trying to tell
[37:14] you
[37:14] to throw your cell phone the bottom of
[37:16] the lake but be mindful be aware of
[37:18] what's taking place around you
[37:20] because i'm going to read you some
[37:21] things in just a little bit you'll
[37:23] understand a little bit more why i'm
[37:24] preaching the way i am this morning
[37:26] but i'm going to read you some things in
[37:27] a moment that'll show you that all of
[37:29] this that's going on around
[37:30] us is on purpose
[37:34] don't kid yourself every agenda that
[37:36] shows up out of washington
[37:38] the devil's got a reason behind pushing
[37:40] it
[37:43] all right praise the lord now notice
[37:46] again let's go back to second timothy
[37:48] chapter three
[37:49] are you all right everybody okay anybody
[37:51] need to take a break go outside catch
[37:53] some breath come in
[37:54] okay all right good stuff hang in there
[37:57] with me then
[37:59] now watch again for this sword are they
[38:01] which creep into houses and lead
[38:03] captives silly women
[38:04] laden with lust led away with divers uh
[38:07] with sins rather led away with divers
[38:08] lusts
[38:09] ever learning and never able to come to
[38:12] the knowledge of the truth
[38:14] so they've got that ability where they
[38:16] can learn and learn and learn and learn
[38:18] to learn the prophet said the prophet
[38:19] said the bible said the bible said the
[38:20] prophet said the bible said the bible
[38:21] said
[38:22] but they're never able to come to the
[38:23] real knowledge of it
[38:25] which this particular word knowledge is
[38:27] an intimate relationship it's more than
[38:29] just
[38:29] being acquainted with it by reading it's
[38:31] actually having an
[38:32] affinity with that which you are reading
[38:35] or a relationship with jesus christ to
[38:37] make it very simple
[38:38] because once you have that relationship
[38:40] or that knowledge of the lord in your
[38:41] heart
[38:42] then there's nothing in this bible you
[38:43] can read that that confuses you
[38:46] you may not understand it but you won't
[38:47] be confused you won't be standing on
[38:50] your head wondering what tomorrow is god
[38:52] will have your answer
[38:54] because you're a child of god
[38:58] and not say you won't wonder about
[38:59] things ponder them
[39:01] but the lord is never if you've really
[39:02] got the holy ghost this morning every
[39:04] one of us me included can testify
[39:06] i can't think of one time he's ever left
[39:07] me alone
[39:09] not once i can't think of one time that
[39:11] i ever really wanted to know something
[39:13] or desire to know
[39:14] or to see something in the word of god
[39:15] that eventually it didn't come down my
[39:17] pathway
[39:19] so god has got our answer if we allow
[39:21] him to lead us and teach us
[39:26] praise the lord we don't want to be ever
[39:29] learning
[39:30] but never able to come to a knowledge
[39:33] you read the bible of the morning or you
[39:35] sit down the coffee table and and you
[39:36] know you got your
[39:37] your your espresso or whatever you like
[39:39] to drink and you're sitting with your
[39:40] book open don't just read them words and
[39:43] say well now praises let me remember
[39:44] how did paul say that exactly ask
[39:47] yourself the real question
[39:48] how can i apply this to me what does
[39:50] this mean to me
[39:52] what's the lord trying to show me out of
[39:54] this particular verse right here
[39:56] that's what you call applying intimate
[39:58] knowledge it's more than just reading
[40:00] the text
[40:01] it's knowing it in a very very plain way
[40:04] now notice again and as janus and
[40:07] jamboree's withstood moses so do these
[40:10] also resist the truth
[40:11] men of corrupt minds represent reprobate
[40:14] concerning the faith
[40:16] now you know i wonder sometimes where
[40:18] did paul get the authority to call these
[40:20] names
[40:22] moses never called their names where'd
[40:24] he get the idea
[40:25] the big idea him daring to call the
[40:28] magicians names in egypt
[40:30] well i reckon since he was a prophet of
[40:32] god and he had open vision himself i
[40:34] reckon he was allowed to call a few
[40:36] things
[40:37] of course some people probably put up a
[40:38] website and this day about it
[40:41] praise the lord right drop down to verse
[40:44] 13
[40:45] but evil men and seducers
[40:48] shall get better and better and better
[40:52] it shall be so good you'll never hear of
[40:54] him again again
[40:58] come on now come on now you tabernacle
[41:00] folks preach to me
[41:02] huh what's your bible say
[41:06] worse and worse that just don't mean
[41:09] worse one time that means every day
[41:10] getting worse
[41:11] and worse and worse at what point did
[41:14] y'all think it would get better
[41:18] if the devil is coming to full power at
[41:20] what point did you think this was going
[41:21] to get increasingly better
[41:25] raise the lord somebody right
[41:28] because it cannot get better if the fact
[41:31] is that it is the very nature of the
[41:33] character of the devil that we just read
[41:34] about
[41:35] traitor heady high minded all that stuff
[41:36] you read it comes straight from the
[41:38] devil it's what he was in heaven
[41:41] he was heady he was high-minded he was a
[41:42] lover of pleasure more than he was a
[41:44] lover of god he wanted a big beautiful
[41:45] kingdom better than that and michael he
[41:46] wanted to worship to himself
[41:48] every characteristic we just read that
[41:50] come right straight from their daddy
[41:54] incontinent fierce don't get much more
[41:56] fierce than the devil
[41:59] talk into robbing a bank and then call
[42:00] the law on you for robbing it
[42:03] the kind of person is he's fierce all of
[42:05] that nature all of that characteristic
[42:07] is being projected down into the lives
[42:09] of human beings and they are
[42:10] simply reflecting the life
[42:14] of what they've come from
[42:17] plainly said the shame of it is
[42:20] it's not going to get better because if
[42:23] god is fully expressing himself today
[42:25] the devil has got to do the same exact
[42:27] thing
[42:28] he's got to express himself fully in
[42:30] some way or another
[42:32] because remember the last day bribe when
[42:33] she goes out of here she will not be an
[42:35] infant girl
[42:36] she will be a mature full-grown woman
[42:39] come on somebody
[42:41] and so this other bride can't be a
[42:43] little girl either
[42:45] she's got to be mature as well
[42:49] praise the lord now watch the word
[42:52] seducers here
[42:53] is the word goes which is actually
[42:55] spelled almost like an english word
[42:57] ghost g-o-e-s
[42:59] but it means a deceiver an imposter or
[43:02] a juggler
[43:07] so evil men and jugglers
[43:10] will get worse and worse well you know
[43:11] what a juggler is on you
[43:13] they're a person that has learned how to
[43:15] take so many balls or
[43:17] bowling bins or whatever it is and so
[43:19] they have just a few moments that they
[43:20] put a little emphasis on that one spot
[43:23] and then they let it go they grab
[43:24] another one put some emphasis and let it
[43:26] go
[43:26] grab another one put some emphasis and
[43:28] let it go and they've learned how not to
[43:30] put too much emphasis on one thing
[43:33] but just keep things moving all along
[43:37] always in motion
[43:40] never stopping
[43:44] seducers are very very good
[43:48] at juggling the truth
[43:51] never placing emphasis more than needs
[43:54] to be
[43:54] before moving on to the next subject for
[43:56] example when they come to church and
[43:58] they tell you
[43:59] that you need to get born again they
[44:01] glance the subject and move on to the
[44:02] next part
[44:05] they never preach in a way that gets the
[44:06] people quiet let me tell you what we
[44:08] need
[44:08] in this message we need some preachers
[44:10] that learn how to shut people up and get
[44:11] them quiet and get them thinking
[44:14] you don't need to kind of preach let me
[44:15] tell you something no man of god
[44:18] is really going to do credit to you or
[44:20] benefit your life will be somebody that
[44:22] you go to church and listen to
[44:23] and you can sit there and feel
[44:25] comfortable the whole service if he did
[44:26] that he's not a preacher he's a hireling
[44:29] he's a god called man at some point in
[44:31] the service you ought to feel a little
[44:32] uncomfortable somewhere
[44:34] because holy ghost fire is hot hello
[44:37] y'all
[44:39] it should be hot when he preaches it
[44:41] should be hot when he gets into your
[44:42] conscience
[44:44] and he works on you in such a way not
[44:46] just placing gentle emphasis upon
[44:48] well we we need to live live right and
[44:50] and you know real bride are saying
[44:51] yeah preach that get down to that talk
[44:54] about holiness man we need it right here
[44:56] and then he's
[44:57] on to the next subject anybody ever had
[45:00] a preacher like that in her life
[45:02] i have i've been associated with a bar
[45:04] shop they don't know how to get out
[45:06] there and really put the heat
[45:08] where it belongs to preach a service on
[45:11] nothing but repentance and try to get
[45:13] the people down the business and praying
[45:15] to get through to the holy ghost and to
[45:16] get right with god you
[45:19] well you can't do that and juggle all
[45:20] them other issues
[45:23] if you're going to really do something
[45:25] for the people in this day and age
[45:26] you've got to be a man
[45:27] that knows how to get off the subject
[45:29] quickly
[45:30] because of course in this day and age if
[45:32] you stay on a subject too long you might
[45:33] make somebody mad
[45:36] god forbid what a brand new concept i
[45:39] must be experienced in the last several
[45:40] years people get
[45:41] mad in church it's a new thing for me
[45:47] the fact is you're supposed to come to
[45:48] church and get your feathers ruffled
[45:50] every now and then
[45:52] come on somebody gonna sit there and
[45:53] look at me church preach to me
[45:56] you're not supposed to come to the house
[45:57] of the lord and feel comfortable
[46:03] the word should be so direct
[46:07] that it feels like it's personal
[46:10] even though it's not even though it's
[46:14] not the word should be so direct
[46:18] that it feels personal
[46:22] that's when it'll do you some good
[46:26] because you know it's easy for people to
[46:27] stand up here and read the bible and
[46:28] read quotes and
[46:29] over to god jesus is his savior and
[46:31] jesus is a healer and
[46:33] he's all that but if people don't have a
[46:35] right attitude i don't care what god is
[46:37] he can't touch them until they get their
[46:38] attitude straight now
[46:41] so the holy ghost i mean if they come
[46:42] walking in the house of the lord and
[46:43] they feel like there's some little
[46:44] elitist little thing
[46:47] you know most of you probably know i've
[46:48] told you this different times i've been
[46:49] teaching chinese kids
[46:51] uh how to speak english overseas online
[46:53] and i always know
[46:55] the little free madonnas that show up in
[46:56] the classroom
[46:58] i i know them i can almost tell them
[46:59] they're just light church people
[47:01] they're the ones if you're preaching and
[47:03] you look down at them oh heaven help you
[47:05] you looked at them when you said that
[47:08] well i gotta look at somebody it might
[47:10] as well be you
[47:12] unless you want me to preach to the
[47:14] lights up there get saved lights
[47:16] they can't they can't feel conviction
[47:18] that piano can't feel conviction but you
[47:20] can
[47:21] and maybe the holy ghost had the
[47:22] preacher look at you because you needed
[47:23] to be looked at
[47:24] whoo but the word should be so
[47:29] direct that it should feel personal
[47:32] even though it's not
[47:35] that's why real god called pastors god
[47:38] bless them
[47:39] they've got a real task on their hand
[47:41] because you imagine they got to come to
[47:43] church and make people feel like that
[47:45] pastor was coming down on them
[47:48] and then they got to get up the next
[47:49] service and do it all over again
[47:52] and then you got to kind of pet on the
[47:54] sheep a little while and get them back
[47:55] into the humor and then
[47:56] make them mad again god bless you
[47:58] brother tom
[47:59] [Laughter]
[48:01] and sometimes you don't even mean to
[48:03] step into them landmines
[48:05] but the holy ghost is a discerner of our
[48:07] thoughts and our intentions
[48:09] and he knows how to take that word and
[48:11] taper and tailor that word in a way
[48:13] that will go right down to whatever is
[48:15] hiding inside that heart
[48:17] no matter what the outside may look like
[48:19] no matter what the form may be
[48:21] come on now god knows what's hiding
[48:24] inside of our hearts
[48:27] so the juggle issues well i've actually
[48:30] heard preachers say
[48:32] they would never say it publicly of
[48:33] course this is just preacher talk at the
[48:35] table but i've actually heard preachers
[48:36] say
[48:38] i don't read those quotes because it
[48:39] might upset people
[48:41] i said why don't you read it all just
[48:44] read it all
[48:45] i mean if i believe this man was a
[48:47] prophet why don't i just read it all
[48:49] oh well he made a mistake there so i'll
[48:51] read that
[48:53] somewhere there's got to be a place he
[48:54] corrected i can read that one too right
[48:56] if i read that one i can read the other
[48:57] one huh
[49:00] what about the one where he said he lied
[49:03] oh but people might think something
[49:05] wrong against brother bannon like what
[49:06] he was a human being
[49:09] and he needed to repent and stay right
[49:10] with god
[49:12] uh-huh you see that's what we've done we
[49:14] have juggled so many issues and we do it
[49:16] as parents we do it as husband and wife
[49:20] that's some man married to some girl i
[49:23] mean he might think you know
[49:24] the uh what was it the teeth like a
[49:26] flock of sheep and the neck like a swan
[49:28] i guess that's compliments in 2020 i
[49:30] think you probably get slapped
[49:31] [Laughter]
[49:33] hair like a flock of goats and all that
[49:36] you'd have to find you'd have to find an
[49:38] updated version of that i think
[49:42] but get some girl like that and boy she
[49:45] knows how to work the system or get some
[49:47] man who is a manipulating gaslighter
[49:51] who knows how to manipulate that woman
[49:53] right down to the core
[49:54] sure juggle the issue why not stand up
[49:57] to it
[49:59] hey sister if he spends too much money
[50:01] why not just tell him he does
[50:04] brother she pouts too much why not just
[50:05] tell her tired are you pouting
[50:08] get out of the business talk the truth
[50:11] oh god half of you trying to run out the
[50:13] back door already
[50:15] stay put stay put
[50:20] why not be honest about things it's
[50:23] because a lot of times what we want to
[50:25] do
[50:25] is is juggling is a lot easier to deal
[50:28] with than
[50:29] actually facing an issue
[50:33] for preachers it's a lot more lucrative
[50:36] see i'm the dumbest evangelist on the
[50:37] planet you didn't know that did you
[50:39] but places that i have been that have
[50:41] put a lot of money in my pocket
[50:43] i've went in there and i've preached
[50:45] hard rough and rude and been mean
[50:47] downright mean because holy ghost told
[50:48] me to be mean
[50:50] and instead of keeping things going and
[50:53] then of course keeping the paychecks
[50:54] rolling if you want to call them
[50:55] paychecks
[50:56] or the offerings or whatever you want to
[50:58] say i go in and preach myself out of a
[51:00] job
[51:02] i'm the dumbest evangelist that ever
[51:03] walked the face of this planet
[51:07] but to me the word is more important
[51:11] than compromising and juggling an issue
[51:15] just because of how somebody can bless
[51:16] you i figure my father owns a cattle on
[51:19] a thousand hills he'll have some sinner
[51:21] pay my debts off if i need it
[51:27] jugglers juggle this chocolate rather
[51:30] than be men of god and stand up to the
[51:32] issue
[51:32] don't you realize that's why the world
[51:34] hates this man william branham
[51:37] because when you listen to them tapes he
[51:39] don't cut women no slack
[51:41] they don't cut to men by none either
[51:44] they're acting like a jezebel he calls
[51:45] him a charity bell
[51:47] that that man's acting like an ahab he
[51:49] just calls it right out
[51:51] i like that kind of preaching at least i
[51:54] know where i stand
[51:57] but seducers jugglers
[52:00] watch us in the rising of the sun he
[52:02] said now there's been churches churches
[52:03] brides brides
[52:06] churches brides brides and he said
[52:08] there's got to come one hallelujah says
[52:12] there's got to come a real bride one
[52:14] that's got not only the mechanics
[52:16] but the dynamics to make the church live
[52:19] and move in the power of the
[52:20] resurrection
[52:24] so here you have two brides set up
[52:27] one claiming with a form of godliness i
[52:29] am the bride of jesus christ and you got
[52:32] the authentic one standing there
[52:33] claiming the same thing
[52:35] both of them are mechanical oh believe
[52:37] me when they quote the scripture they're
[52:38] going to go
[52:39] they're going to do their best to quote
[52:40] it right and one ride will probably know
[52:43] more than the other bride
[52:45] someone might even be smarter
[52:49] huh even have signs and wonders you say
[52:52] brother ben that's ridiculous
[52:53] cain was more scientifically
[52:57] advanced than his little farmer brother
[52:59] abel
[53:01] don't forget that smartness and doesn't
[53:02] always mean that god's behind it
[53:05] the children of this world are a lot
[53:07] wiser than us as saints
[53:10] they have no uh they have no
[53:11] reservations if it comes to splitting
[53:13] atom they don't even stop to talk to the
[53:14] lord about it they just split the thing
[53:18] their wisdom comes from the from the
[53:20] ability to just
[53:21] throw caution to the wind and do
[53:22] whatever they want to they don't seek
[53:24] for the will of god
[53:25] and wait on the lord for the reality of
[53:26] what the consequence would be
[53:29] it's like i believe with all my heart
[53:31] and forgiveness if this sounds like a
[53:32] political statement
[53:33] i believe all my heart this virus is
[53:35] broke out in a a laboratory
[53:38] something that got away from them i
[53:39] believe that with all of my heart
[53:42] if maybe the men that have been behind
[53:43] that if they'd have stopped and prayed a
[53:45] little bit
[53:46] maybe the road would have been right to
[53:47] help humanity or do something to fight
[53:49] some kind of dreaded this that or the
[53:51] other maybe they'd have stopped and said
[53:53] lord what shall we do about this and god
[53:54] would say whoa
[53:55] don't you touch that but the children of
[53:58] this world they don't care about things
[53:59] like that
[54:01] comes to experiment on a human body they
[54:03] had to create
[54:05] laws to keep folks
[54:08] from doing studies that were completely
[54:12] unethical
[54:14] and damaging to the human body the world
[54:17] power
[54:18] had to put a stop to human beings
[54:21] from conducting studies on human
[54:23] participants
[54:24] without the consideration of their mind
[54:26] their body and their safety
[54:29] that's how cruel people are don't
[54:31] believe it look at nazi germany
[54:33] oh you say that was them read feast of
[54:35] the trumpets and listen what brother
[54:36] brahman said
[54:37] he said the same spirits that attack him
[54:39] jews in nazi germany
[54:40] are the same devils coming against you
[54:42] and i here today
[54:44] same spirits politically driven sure
[54:47] economically driven absolutely
[54:50] religiously driven 100
[54:54] now notice let's go to exodus chapter 7
[54:56] verse 10 now
[54:58] and let's look at the scene that paul
[55:00] brings up here
[55:01] everybody doing all right praise the
[55:04] lord
[55:05] so glad joe's with us this morning i
[55:06] wouldn't have no amens if he wasn't here
[55:08] bull and i
[55:09] y'all are just looking at me somebody
[55:10] [Laughter]
[55:14] watches exodus chapter 7 verse 10. and
[55:17] moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and
[55:18] they did as the lord had commanded
[55:21] and aaron cast down his rod before
[55:23] pharaoh and before his servants and
[55:24] became a serpent
[55:27] then pharaoh called the wise men and the
[55:28] sorcerers
[55:30] now the magicians of egypt and they did
[55:32] in like manner with their enchants
[55:33] enchantments for they cast down every
[55:36] man is rod and they became
[55:37] serpents but aaron's rod
[55:41] swallowed up their rods all right now
[55:43] let's let's take ourselves
[55:45] out of 2020. okay let's transport
[55:48] ourselves
[55:48] back in time to this moment
[55:52] all right now you don't know what's in
[55:54] moses hand you don't know what's in
[55:56] aaron's hand you've never seen this
[55:57] before
[55:59] this is the first time that any of this
[56:02] has ever taken place
[56:03] it's never happened before in the events
[56:05] of human history
[56:07] and you are standing on the sidelines in
[56:09] egypt and you watch this 80 old
[56:12] 80 year old man walk up there that boy
[56:14] on his hip
[56:16] and here he is walking up and two little
[56:18] crooked sticks in their hand
[56:20] and aaron of course who's a prophet to
[56:22] god which moses was god and aaron was
[56:24] the prophet
[56:26] what the lord told him you be god and
[56:28] marry and be your prophet he'll talk for
[56:30] you and aaron walks up
[56:33] and now thus saith the lord and throws
[56:36] his staff down it becomes a stick
[56:37] you've never seen this before you don't
[56:39] know what's getting ready to take place
[56:42] at the very moment he does that pharaoh
[56:45] starts cackling
[56:48] you think that's something hey y'all
[56:51] boys come
[56:52] show them something
[56:56] they're throwing their rods down
[56:57] becoming serpents just like what aaron
[56:59] did
[56:59] at the very beginning you might have
[57:00] went wow what's taking place here
[57:04] what's going on remember you've never
[57:06] seen this before
[57:08] and now the magicians are doing the very
[57:10] same thing all right even like
[57:12] tabernacle i want to ask you
[57:14] how are you going to call this ball game
[57:17] which one are you going to take a stand
[57:19] for you don't know nothing now
[57:22] except for what you're looking at all
[57:24] you can see is what's
[57:26] transpired before your eyes so which one
[57:29] is the true and which one is the false
[57:33] now the truth of the whole situation lay
[57:36] not in the beginning
[57:38] not in the middle but the whole truth
[57:41] laid at the end
[57:45] praise the lord because the true
[57:48] manifestation
[57:50] of what was real remember an enchantment
[57:53] can't
[57:53] has no digestive system
[57:57] sorcery has no real teeth
[58:00] and these men ever how they was able to
[58:02] manipulate they might have had gases
[58:04] they might they don't tell them what
[58:05] they've done to be able to perform what
[58:07] they did
[58:10] the bible said it happened that's all i
[58:11] know is it happened
[58:15] but when it come to actually being able
[58:17] to manifest
[58:20] that what was on the inside was also a
[58:22] snake
[58:24] there was no way in the world that they
[58:26] could manifest truth
[58:28] because all you were looking at was a
[58:31] form of godliness
[58:33] a cloud that was empty without any water
[58:35] in it
[58:38] and when aaron's rod begins to eat up
[58:40] these other snakes you know what it
[58:41] proved
[58:42] it goes to prove that the manifestation
[58:44] of what what aaron was saying
[58:45] was god because that wasn't no pretend
[58:47] snake it was a snake
[58:52] because god don't make pretend
[58:56] somebody should have had a holiday man
[58:58] on that one
[58:59] god don't make fakery god is no magician
[59:03] that's why he don't do miracles for the
[59:05] sake of funding around and just just
[59:06] putting on a show for people
[59:09] religion miraculous those powers of god
[59:11] they are not for entertainment
[59:13] they've got a purpose behind them
[59:17] and you know what happened to those
[59:18] other snakes well they was bottled up in
[59:20] aaron's rod
[59:23] praise the lord so here you've got in
[59:26] type two brides
[59:28] which one are you going to believe if
[59:31] you look at it from the beginning
[59:33] you're going to see one view if you look
[59:35] at it in the middle you're going to see
[59:36] another view but wait to the end of the
[59:38] story and you will know
[59:40] who the real one is this is the
[59:42] principle that's being shared with us in
[59:43] this book
[59:44] now watch here in israel in the church
[59:46] brother baby said now joseph was sold
[59:48] for almost 30 pieces of silver by his
[59:50] brothers
[59:51] the jewish church betrayed joseph today
[59:53] what is it in the church
[59:54] a betrayal
[59:58] now surely you all don't think that you
[1:00:00] know that our greatest betrayal is going
[1:00:02] to come from the
[1:00:03] religions out there now if you do please
[1:00:06] change your thinking because that is not
[1:00:08] where
[1:00:08] our greatest betrayal is going to take
[1:00:10] place
[1:00:12] but really if it was the brothers of
[1:00:15] joseph that did the betraying it wasn't
[1:00:17] the
[1:00:18] outside folk it was the inside folk
[1:00:22] the greatest betrayal of saints of god
[1:00:25] is going to come from those that call
[1:00:27] themselves saints
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:32] if y'all get any quieter i'm wondering
[1:00:34] huh
[1:00:37] oh but they say their bride sure at the
[1:00:39] beginning they can say that
[1:00:40] remember it's not he that begins the
[1:00:41] race it's the guy that finishes it that
[1:00:43] makes the difference
[1:00:46] all of them have a voice in the
[1:00:48] beginning
[1:00:50] but keep following on watch again he
[1:00:53] said i keep this in their in your mind
[1:00:55] they are going to have a confederation
[1:00:57] with all of their churches
[1:00:59] he said they're already here in america
[1:01:01] they're already
[1:01:02] he said confederating together and
[1:01:04] they're going to have a band here that
[1:01:06] will someday
[1:01:07] fight communism it'll hook up with
[1:01:09] catholicism
[1:01:10] the protestant church the catholic
[1:01:11] together and those inner denominations
[1:01:14] who stood for the truth that's y'all if
[1:01:15] you didn't know
[1:01:20] he said and got away from the dogma
[1:01:21] they've got will be persecuted
[1:01:24] the mark of the beast the seal of god
[1:01:26] the showdown will come
[1:01:28] soon he said brother that's not there
[1:01:30] you'll be deceived just as sure as the
[1:01:32] world how about the holy ghost
[1:01:33] he said now notice he said they'll make
[1:01:35] an agreement and bring
[1:01:36] all christianity should christianize the
[1:01:39] world back and it will look so good
[1:01:41] people will chop into it
[1:01:47] they'll confederate the churches to try
[1:01:49] to make christianity
[1:01:51] one unit well of course they will
[1:01:55] because christianity is so blasted
[1:01:57] divided
[1:01:59] friends is no joke it is
[1:02:02] you can't get one baptist to set down
[1:02:04] from another branch of the baptist and
[1:02:06] agree on nothing
[1:02:08] come on don't y'all look at me that way
[1:02:09] you can't get hardly two message people
[1:02:11] to sit down let them agree on anything
[1:02:16] but they've all got the answer you know
[1:02:17] how it is debating doctrine
[1:02:19] you know of course if you're in the
[1:02:20] debate you're the one that's the winner
[1:02:24] no matter if you're disproved or not
[1:02:25] you're the one winning
[1:02:27] right is that the idea well how can this
[1:02:30] one have the truth and that one have the
[1:02:32] truth
[1:02:34] have you ever seen fiddler on the roof
[1:02:37] and that guy says to him he's right and
[1:02:39] he's right they can't both be right
[1:02:42] [Laughter]
[1:02:46] but of course truth you understand comes
[1:02:48] from the bible not from men's political
[1:02:50] views
[1:02:52] not from their agendas or perspectives
[1:02:54] of world economics or world power or
[1:02:56] world whatever
[1:02:58] those things come from the bible let all
[1:03:00] mans be alive man's words be a lie and
[1:03:02] let mine be the truth
[1:03:06] so somehow another they're going to have
[1:03:08] to come
[1:03:09] together
[1:03:14] and the bible said in revelation he'll
[1:03:15] give
[1:03:17] power and everything under the image of
[1:03:20] the beast
[1:03:20] that's us if you all didn't know
[1:03:24] not canada not mexico not new zealand
[1:03:26] not africa
[1:03:27] not india the united states of america
[1:03:30] will become the image under the beast
[1:03:31] you'll speak
[1:03:32] with the same authority well if she's
[1:03:35] doing some talking
[1:03:36] you can't have a word without a thought
[1:03:39] and to have a thought you have to have a
[1:03:41] mind
[1:03:43] so where did her mind come come from
[1:03:47] you understand when not when when nazi
[1:03:49] germany when hitler decided
[1:03:50] that he was going to spread the third
[1:03:52] rock you understand what he did
[1:03:55] not only did he get into the media he
[1:03:57] controlled the media
[1:03:59] he controlled entertainment
[1:04:02] there wasn't a show that they put on
[1:04:04] that didn't have nazi germany
[1:04:06] agenda threaded all the way through the
[1:04:09] whole thing
[1:04:11] and some of us will sit down there with
[1:04:13] a remote control on our hand or we'll
[1:04:15] scan through to netflix or we'll turn on
[1:04:17] hbo max or one of these kind of deals
[1:04:19] like that amazon prime
[1:04:20] and we'll watch every old filthy ungodly
[1:04:23] thing and one all just entertain
[1:04:24] entertainment be careful
[1:04:27] somebody is projecting their mind
[1:04:32] to what you're watching
[1:04:35] i'm not telling you to be i'm not a
[1:04:37] legalist that you can't sit down and
[1:04:39] watch golf on tv god's sakes
[1:04:43] but we need to stop and consider what
[1:04:45] we're letting to the gates
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:49] because satan hasn't agenda everything
[1:04:51] he pokes at
[1:04:54] every time you pick up a paper whether
[1:04:55] it's electronic or on your ipad or
[1:04:57] wherever it might be there's an agenda
[1:04:59] attached to that
[1:05:00] have you all noticed how sweet the media
[1:05:02] has been since trump has been
[1:05:04] voted out since he has no more time if
[1:05:07] you notice how sweet they've got
[1:05:09] now every time you scroll through your
[1:05:10] through your through your phone now oh
[1:05:12] it's oh you know oh
[1:05:13] all the nations we're covering probably
[1:05:15] but we're standing together
[1:05:16] so you got somebody that wouldn't call
[1:05:19] you out no more
[1:05:22] one thing i loved about the guys he put
[1:05:24] them people in their place where they
[1:05:25] belonged
[1:05:26] a bunch of crooks and sidewinders and
[1:05:28] liars the day of judgment will declare
[1:05:30] everything they've
[1:05:31] ever done to push them fear tactics off
[1:05:34] on the people
[1:05:37] right if it suits them it'll suit them
[1:05:40] but there must come
[1:05:41] something eventually now listen to me
[1:05:44] these are little micro things little
[1:05:45] tiny stops and
[1:05:46] and divots and bumps in the road but
[1:05:48] there's got to come something big enough
[1:05:51] that will cause both democrat republican
[1:05:53] independent yellow green purple and all
[1:05:55] the rest of these parties
[1:05:56] to come together on a common basis
[1:06:00] now you think to yourself i know what
[1:06:03] you're getting ready to say but how
[1:06:04] could it be us
[1:06:05] they don't even pay attention to us and
[1:06:08] one little virus
[1:06:10] put the world in the condition it's in
[1:06:13] let me tell you something church
[1:06:15] when god gets ready to declare this
[1:06:18] bride and who she
[1:06:19] is it'll get the world's attention
[1:06:24] maybe not in the way we think it will it
[1:06:27] certainly won't be a worldwide revival
[1:06:28] come on
[1:06:31] but the power of god will not leave out
[1:06:33] of here without making a mark for it
[1:06:34] goes
[1:06:36] because there will be a showdown
[1:06:39] sure it won't come away we think it is
[1:06:41] just like the rapture resurrection won't
[1:06:42] be a bunch of angels out there with
[1:06:44] shovels and hoes and rakes in their hand
[1:06:46] digging bodies up and giving them
[1:06:47] change the graves are open but not the
[1:06:50] way you say open
[1:06:52] not the way i say open watch this again
[1:06:55] and the message called to see jesus do
[1:06:57] you realize in the last day when this
[1:06:59] duel of spirits come
[1:07:01] is i wasn't going to say this but the
[1:07:03] holy spirit is pressing on me now
[1:07:05] you realize the bible preaches in the
[1:07:06] last day that the two spirits has to
[1:07:08] come to a showdown
[1:07:10] that will not be some doctrine of
[1:07:12] churches or something
[1:07:15] i love this quote so in other words
[1:07:18] the final showdown will not be okay was
[1:07:20] my doctrine right or was your doctrine
[1:07:26] right
[1:07:28] did i have the right version or did you
[1:07:30] have the right version
[1:07:32] no no when the showdown comes listen
[1:07:35] brother bretton said
[1:07:36] the two spirits will be so close it
[1:07:38] could deceive the elected if it was
[1:07:39] possible
[1:07:40] surely you don't believe that exists
[1:07:41] outside the ranks of this message
[1:07:46] that's so close so close
[1:07:49] got to be close to be close friends
[1:07:56] you realize he said as janice and james
[1:07:57] withstood moses so these men reprobate
[1:07:59] concerning the faith
[1:08:00] they'll try to withstand the spirit of
[1:08:02] god in the last days
[1:08:04] listen to me don't you know that's
[1:08:06] what's taking place already
[1:08:08] go to some of our churches and just ask
[1:08:12] somebody what they think about the gift
[1:08:13] of the spirit
[1:08:17] it won't be long you'll find out number
[1:08:20] one many of them don't even know what
[1:08:21] you're talking about
[1:08:23] and number two a lot of them don't even
[1:08:25] want to talk
[1:08:26] gifts in a church of course they don't
[1:08:28] because gifts keep your church clean
[1:08:31] you can't go on with the lifestyles and
[1:08:32] where you live if you've got prophecy
[1:08:34] calling you out every time you pull it
[1:08:39] remember this demonic spirit that comes
[1:08:41] in it calls itself
[1:08:43] a bride but it's church formal
[1:08:47] and so its idea is we don't need worship
[1:08:51] even though they'll worship but they
[1:08:53] don't worship
[1:08:54] like worship like you got it they don't
[1:08:56] want spontaneous christian worship
[1:09:00] they want program manufactured clap on
[1:09:03] cue
[1:09:04] raise your hand on cue
[1:09:09] well i've seen you all quiet before but
[1:09:11] i've never seen you all
[1:09:13] die in a service like this
[1:09:16] [Laughter]
[1:09:18] huh say with me a little while
[1:09:21] don't you understand what's taking place
[1:09:23] that coldness that we feel
[1:09:25] amongst the ranks you can even feel it
[1:09:28] in your own church i'm sure
[1:09:29] i'm not i'm not speaking down about the
[1:09:31] believers here but i'm sure you get
[1:09:32] folks in here that possibly don't
[1:09:34] believe in worship and praise in the
[1:09:35] lord and things like that and then you
[1:09:36] try to cut loose
[1:09:37] you feel it it's coming from the back
[1:09:41] up the side where's it coming from it's
[1:09:43] coming
[1:09:46] i'll tell you something i appreciate
[1:09:48] about brother tom i believe he's a real
[1:09:49] man of god
[1:09:51] you know how i know that sister don and
[1:09:53] his wife's a real daughter of god
[1:09:56] i've watched that woman back here in
[1:09:58] that sound booth whenever it comes time
[1:10:00] the holy ghost goes to move and i've
[1:10:01] lost
[1:10:02] count i hope this is all right sis i
[1:10:03] don't mean to embarrass you
[1:10:05] but i've lost count of the times brother
[1:10:07] tom that i could feel the holy ghost
[1:10:09] getting ready to explode on the platform
[1:10:11] and watch her immediately respond before
[1:10:13] any of you all caught a word that lady
[1:10:16] back here is sensitive to the holy ghost
[1:10:18] i don't say that trying to suck up as
[1:10:20] they say that's not me just trying to
[1:10:22] kiss up to the boss
[1:10:25] but i'm saying this to be truthful
[1:10:29] you have to come to a place to where you
[1:10:30] realize that cold
[1:10:32] spirit that doesn't want you to move in
[1:10:35] the holy ghost
[1:10:36] that is a false bride anointing
[1:10:39] that would love nothing more than to
[1:10:41] shut down anything that looks like true
[1:10:42] pentecost
[1:10:46] that's why i spent a god have such a
[1:10:48] battle
[1:10:49] i i've just learned to come on whether
[1:10:51] you do or not i'm going to tell you to
[1:10:52] come on but i'm coming on whether you do
[1:10:54] or not
[1:10:55] it just makes it a whole lot nicer when
[1:10:57] you do come on
[1:10:59] you know i mean i've been in services
[1:11:03] where
[1:11:04] they've literally been swinging from the
[1:11:05] rafters almost
[1:11:07] and i'm going come on somebody cut on
[1:11:09] somebody
[1:11:11] i'm going to haul it like that no matter
[1:11:12] whether you're saying amen or not that's
[1:11:13] not really the point
[1:11:16] but the idea is there's a spirit amongst
[1:11:18] the people of this message that would
[1:11:19] love to just
[1:11:20] squash that supernatural part out we
[1:11:23] believe the prophet we believe the
[1:11:24] message but you know
[1:11:28] speaking in tongues
[1:11:33] prophecy what's the matter with you
[1:11:40] and yet do you realize the very s the
[1:11:41] very hope of the christian church
[1:11:44] is based upon the gift of prophecy
[1:11:48] that's called the coming of the lord how
[1:11:51] do you know
[1:11:52] about the coming of the lord because it
[1:11:55] was prophesied to you
[1:12:01] so that little insignificant gift of
[1:12:03] prophecy it is beneficial
[1:12:06] but this other group don't want that let
[1:12:08] me show you why
[1:12:10] brother man says here's a message called
[1:12:11] go tell he says come to a place the
[1:12:13] little church has believed the message
[1:12:15] amen and stood on both feet with her
[1:12:17] eyes centered on the cross
[1:12:20] he said the nations have got to
[1:12:22] recognize it it'll come to a showdown
[1:12:25] he said the council of churches and so
[1:12:26] forth is so honeycomb with communistic
[1:12:32] no wonder they can't believe in the
[1:12:33] supernatural no wonder they can't
[1:12:35] believe in divine healing
[1:12:37] they don't have any message in their
[1:12:39] heart
[1:12:43] he said that's why no matter how hard
[1:12:46] they're running now notice he says
[1:12:47] honeycomb
[1:12:48] with communism anybody know what the
[1:12:50] real meaning of communism is
[1:12:52] well i didn't so i looked it up
[1:12:56] communism means it is a
[1:12:59] system of social organization
[1:13:03] where all social and economic activity
[1:13:07] is controlled by a political party
[1:13:10] or by one person
[1:13:14] and brother brahm said the churches are
[1:13:15] honeycombed in communism
[1:13:18] oh so they're not out there running
[1:13:20] around with red flags and
[1:13:21] you know and goose stepping but this is
[1:13:24] the spirit that lay behind communism
[1:13:27] to control the churches by
[1:13:30] social influence
[1:13:35] because you know what they call these
[1:13:37] new up and coming social media types
[1:13:39] don't you
[1:13:39] they call them social media influencers
[1:13:44] and we have the same thing around the
[1:13:45] ranks so the message let me tell you
[1:13:46] something friends
[1:13:48] listen i didn't go to school to learn
[1:13:49] how to preach
[1:13:51] i i i'm gifted i believe by the hand of
[1:13:53] the lord but i've taken my cues from a
[1:13:55] hundred other preachers in this message
[1:13:56] i've learned how to preach by watching
[1:13:57] every preacher there is to learn how to
[1:13:59] preach
[1:14:00] to try to find a way to be have a good
[1:14:03] presentation and to help the people get
[1:14:05] somewhere
[1:14:07] but i'm going to say something i
[1:14:10] guarantee you in this day and age a man
[1:14:12] can't preach a sermon
[1:14:14] without being accused of sneaking around
[1:14:18] and reading or listening to somebody
[1:14:19] else's deal
[1:14:22] and it's always about five or ten or
[1:14:24] eight top men
[1:14:28] and if it didn't come from there then it
[1:14:30] didn't come from anywhere
[1:14:32] well i figured y'all get quiet but i'm
[1:14:33] coming on anyhow
[1:14:35] don't you realize what that is now i'm
[1:14:37] not saying that these particular
[1:14:38] brothers have a communistic spirit on
[1:14:40] them
[1:14:40] but what the people have done with them
[1:14:44] i mean i'll just point you to a place
[1:14:46] down in the east down by the ohio river
[1:14:48] that for some people's attitude is
[1:14:49] that if it doesn't come from that
[1:14:51] headquarters down there it didn't come
[1:14:52] from anywhere
[1:14:56] communism and on the other side of that
[1:15:00] i don't care what the preacher's name is
[1:15:02] if he controls his church or he controls
[1:15:04] his people based on
[1:15:06] social politics and who they like and
[1:15:08] who they don't like
[1:15:10] i've told you a million times people say
[1:15:12] who do you preach for
[1:15:14] what in the world has that got to do
[1:15:17] don't you know what that is that's a
[1:15:18] communistic devil
[1:15:20] because then see if i preach for this
[1:15:22] one this one this one and this one that
[1:15:23] i must be okay
[1:15:24] how do you do that
[1:15:30] praise the lord it's a social
[1:15:33] communistic spirit
[1:15:36] controlling the thing through social
[1:15:38] agendas
[1:15:39] some people some preachers i'm telling
[1:15:41] you friends and some people
[1:15:42] can do more damage sitting in a parking
[1:15:44] lounge or with a cell phone attached to
[1:15:46] their ear
[1:15:46] than they could if they ever got on
[1:15:48] youtube and broadcast it or whatever
[1:15:49] they did
[1:15:51] because all they got to do is call up
[1:15:52] their 15 buddies and tell them we don't
[1:15:53] like that guy
[1:15:55] and he's done i've seen many evangelists
[1:15:58] squashed
[1:15:59] like bugs on the field because of social
[1:16:02] pressures from the outside from
[1:16:04] men that didn't like the way they
[1:16:06] presented themselves
[1:16:10] i remember many years ago when i was a
[1:16:11] boy preacher before i was a preacher
[1:16:13] before i was even saved now i think
[1:16:14] about it i had a dream for whatever
[1:16:16] reason i was standing at the apostolic
[1:16:18] arc that
[1:16:19] but at the church it had a big overhang
[1:16:22] like this
[1:16:23] and there was always full of preachers
[1:16:26] and i never will forget
[1:16:29] in the stream i was sitting up there and
[1:16:30] i had a pair of overhauls on no shirt
[1:16:34] and the branches were short ragged
[1:16:36] tagged hanging down below my knee of
[1:16:37] course and all that
[1:16:39] and i got up i didn't have no shoes on
[1:16:42] didn't my hair wasn't comb sticking
[1:16:43] every direction i was muddy all over
[1:16:46] and they called me to preach and i got
[1:16:49] up to preach
[1:16:49] and all them preachers go you're not a
[1:16:51] part of our club
[1:16:52] you're not a part of our group you don't
[1:16:55] do it the way we do it
[1:16:56] i said it on then god was calling me for
[1:16:58] that kind of lifestyle
[1:17:04] because don't you realize even in a
[1:17:06] church
[1:17:07] if a family does a certain thing in a
[1:17:09] certain way
[1:17:10] that will be perceived as being the holy
[1:17:12] ghost
[1:17:14] that's right and if you're not careful
[1:17:18] that spirit
[1:17:19] spirit of communism will fall on you
[1:17:24] and you'll dress like them walk like
[1:17:26] them talk like them act like them
[1:17:29] well brother tom it's been fun majority
[1:17:32] years together sir
[1:17:36] huh it's a communistic spirit and this
[1:17:39] false thing weaves itself and threads
[1:17:42] itself through the church and of course
[1:17:43] he who has
[1:17:44] the most money wins
[1:17:47] because in some circles if they pay
[1:17:48] enough tithe or whatever all that
[1:17:50] influences the preacher
[1:17:52] right sure it does that's one reason why
[1:17:56] preachers should not get themself
[1:17:57] entangled with tithing accounts and all
[1:17:58] this other kind of stuff
[1:18:00] they should know and have opportunity to
[1:18:02] do with it what the
[1:18:03] they want ties belong to this man right
[1:18:05] here in this church
[1:18:07] you don't have a say to it it ain't none
[1:18:09] of your business what he does with it
[1:18:13] god if he wants to take it and buy him a
[1:18:15] brand new
[1:18:16] red something something truck
[1:18:20] it's his business god will answer
[1:18:24] make him answer on the day of judgment
[1:18:25] of course for high handling
[1:18:28] but how do you know he didn't need that
[1:18:29] red drug
[1:18:31] i need a red truck then go to work
[1:18:35] that's what he's doing okay
[1:18:39] couple of them if you need it listen
[1:18:42] i somebody said to me one time i can't
[1:18:45] get my young people to stop getting on
[1:18:48] this and doing what's the problem i said
[1:18:51] you let him lay at the house all day
[1:18:52] long with nothing but video games a cell
[1:18:54] phone
[1:18:54] and access to the internet if you want
[1:18:57] to solve their problems
[1:18:58] get them off the altar and get them in
[1:19:00] jobs
[1:19:04] i want a boy to get off the altar it's
[1:19:06] where they belong i said
[1:19:08] it ain't doing them no good to go to the
[1:19:09] altar because when they get done at the
[1:19:11] altar they're still getting involved in
[1:19:12] nonsense
[1:19:14] idle hands are the devil's playground
[1:19:16] somebody preached to me
[1:19:26] communism what y'all are in church this
[1:19:29] morning communism
[1:19:34] thank you jesus now notice again
[1:19:37] questions and answers brother i'm
[1:19:38] speaking on the mark of the beast don't
[1:19:39] you believe that'll be a tattoo or a
[1:19:42] number in your head or number on your
[1:19:44] hand
[1:19:46] i was absolutely amazed i'm a social
[1:19:48] media guy okay i like facebook and
[1:19:50] i've got facebook and and and
[1:19:54] if it's used right i think it's okay you
[1:19:57] know
[1:19:58] listen people years ago misused a
[1:20:00] telephone when it was connected to the
[1:20:02] wall and it was the little rotary jobby
[1:20:05] same anointing was on them people back
[1:20:07] then same ones on the facebook today
[1:20:10] it ain't the facebook it's in rotten
[1:20:12] people that are on it
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:14] hallelujah social distance and i'm sorry
[1:20:18] [Laughter]
[1:20:25] but i was amazed during quarantine how
[1:20:27] many people i just went right down
[1:20:28] through the line
[1:20:29] about this rfid chip and
[1:20:32] cashless society oh this is it
[1:20:36] this is what we were warned of these are
[1:20:38] message people and i wanted to write in
[1:20:40] their soul
[1:20:44] haven't y'all ever listened to a tape
[1:20:46] any y'all
[1:20:47] and y'all ever read a book you who claim
[1:20:50] this man was a prophet of god
[1:20:52] never taught you that an rfid chip was
[1:20:54] the mark of the beast
[1:20:57] and he never taught you that cashless
[1:20:59] societies was the mark of the beast
[1:21:02] the mark of the beast listen
[1:21:05] is the rejecting of the baptism of the
[1:21:07] holy ghost
[1:21:11] not a tattoo
[1:21:15] i read one guy said he's supposed to be
[1:21:16] a message guy
[1:21:18] we're gonna get a number of those that
[1:21:20] won't take the vaccine
[1:21:22] that's oh god it hurts it hurts
[1:21:28] where do people get the ideas that they
[1:21:30] get they've been programmed
[1:21:33] do you understand when people are
[1:21:34] talking that doomsday stuff they've
[1:21:36] never really given themselves to the
[1:21:38] message of the
[1:21:38] hour because when all of this takes
[1:21:41] place
[1:21:41] jesus said didn't don't look the cnn
[1:21:43] don't look the fox don't look to none of
[1:21:45] the rest of them
[1:21:46] look up
[1:21:51] because your redemption draws nigh
[1:21:55] get your eyes off all of that mess out
[1:21:57] there
[1:22:02] just to pinch further let's quit
[1:22:06] handwriting on the wall he said i want
[1:22:07] you to notice
[1:22:10] he said the beginning of the gentiles
[1:22:12] when god dealt with them they were
[1:22:13] haughty in their heart
[1:22:14] and forced every man to worship a holy
[1:22:17] man
[1:22:18] the image of a holy man
[1:22:22] the gentile age comes in with that
[1:22:26] the gentile age will go out with that
[1:22:32] they said it will be issued the same way
[1:22:35] a boycott
[1:22:39] of the mark of the beast that will force
[1:22:41] people to worship images and do things
[1:22:43] that's been taught contrary to the word
[1:22:46] of god
[1:22:49] very next statement he said it will be a
[1:22:51] boycott against
[1:22:53] the bride
[1:22:59] you can feel that very spirit
[1:23:03] in the midst of our churches right now
[1:23:07] let a true servant of god preach truth
[1:23:09] to the people
[1:23:10] he will be marked as a troublemaker
[1:23:14] not so shall be acceptable and you'll
[1:23:17] hear people voice
[1:23:18] their unneeded unnecessary opinions i
[1:23:21] just don't like him
[1:23:23] since when did that become an uh the the
[1:23:25] the measuring stick for whether you hear
[1:23:26] what i gotta preach or not
[1:23:29] i got news you could not like anything
[1:23:30] about me you could think i'm the most
[1:23:32] repulsive human being you've ever met
[1:23:33] but if i preach the word to you you
[1:23:35] better get your mouth open say amen
[1:23:39] because when it comes to the word it
[1:23:40] ain't got nothing to do with my
[1:23:41] personality
[1:23:45] this is about god and what he said right
[1:23:49] here
[1:23:53] he said paul was hard to take peterson
[1:23:57] you know why paul was very plain spoken
[1:24:01] there's a pharisee he was conditioned to
[1:24:03] be that way
[1:24:04] well you know how the pharisees was with
[1:24:05] jesus
[1:24:07] rough rude straight in your face
[1:24:10] paul didn't lose too much of that when
[1:24:11] he was preaching
[1:24:13] because when he come to them galatians
[1:24:15] he said you want to give me your eyes
[1:24:17] until i told you the truth
[1:24:21] oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched
[1:24:25] you
[1:24:25] you know what he's saying somebody's
[1:24:27] cast a spell on you
[1:24:29] and you're like a heathen that's some
[1:24:31] hard preaching
[1:24:33] [Laughter]
[1:24:37] but it didn't have nothing to do with
[1:24:38] paul's personality
[1:24:42] it was about what paul had to say
[1:24:45] now listen close the other side of that
[1:24:49] is with this false group it has
[1:24:52] everything to do with personality
[1:24:57] because you see they don't have an
[1:24:59] agenda unless they have a personality to
[1:25:01] lead that agenda
[1:25:03] well since their foundation of this
[1:25:05] false bride has nothing to do with the
[1:25:06] word of god
[1:25:08] then it has to be controlled or inspired
[1:25:10] by something
[1:25:12] so a lot of times the inspiration behind
[1:25:14] them things is charisma
[1:25:17] well speaking
[1:25:21] listen i've been through enough college
[1:25:22] stuff in my life to hear a guy use the
[1:25:24] wrong language you know what i mean
[1:25:28] i had a lady tell me once i think i've
[1:25:29] told you this before
[1:25:32] she said you are smart as a whip i said
[1:25:34] thank you
[1:25:36] she said but the way you talk oh she was
[1:25:40] an english
[1:25:40] english gal she said you don't say
[1:25:43] nothing right
[1:25:45] i said what do you mean she said your
[1:25:46] wasn't should be words your words should
[1:25:47] be was
[1:25:52] i said yeah she said and you don't seen
[1:25:55] it
[1:25:55] you saw it her exact words for god's
[1:25:59] sakes you saw it
[1:26:04] i said yes ma'am that's true i said but
[1:26:06] listen to me the people i preached to
[1:26:09] they wouldn't understand the way you
[1:26:10] talk either
[1:26:12] because you use words that they'd
[1:26:14] haven't they need a dictionary people
[1:26:15] look at mine
[1:26:18] i said so i choose not to incorporate
[1:26:20] any of that into my language
[1:26:22] now i've been on a plane and i've sat
[1:26:24] next to doctors and different people and
[1:26:26] they're scholar
[1:26:26] learned people and you know i try to
[1:26:28] fall in the rhythm
[1:26:30] of being just me not change but i try to
[1:26:33] fall on the rhythm if they use certain
[1:26:34] words you know i
[1:26:36] i try to you know yeah i understand
[1:26:37] where you're coming from
[1:26:39] i refuse to become a personality
[1:26:44] a celebrity that's what they call them
[1:26:46] nowadays you know
[1:26:48] in the message we have celebrities now
[1:26:53] god help us friends it's a false bride
[1:26:58] creating a false agenda through social
[1:27:02] influence and social control
[1:27:04] i appreciate the internet i appreciate
[1:27:06] what god's been able to do for it
[1:27:07] i'm sure some of you listening this
[1:27:08] message right now at home streaming i'm
[1:27:10] sure you appreciate being able to hear
[1:27:12] the message this way
[1:27:14] but social media and social influences
[1:27:16] have been just as destructive
[1:27:19] as they've been beneficial because the
[1:27:22] second somebody becomes even a little
[1:27:24] bit visible
[1:27:25] all of a sudden they become an authority
[1:27:30] that's what we got to remember the only
[1:27:32] authority we come back to
[1:27:39] this right there oh and don't forget
[1:27:42] say only what was said on those tapes
[1:27:50] so the world is going to go out
[1:27:51] worshiping images now do you honestly
[1:27:53] think
[1:27:53] that if the pope walked in here in all
[1:27:55] of his reality and
[1:27:57] his popenos
[1:28:01] see what i mean about cause that poor
[1:28:04] professor to pass out
[1:28:08] you think he walked in here there be you
[1:28:10] message people will be gone
[1:28:11] oh you're holiness
[1:28:15] you think we'll be falling down and
[1:28:17] going home let me kiss your ring
[1:28:23] but what if a man stood up here and said
[1:28:25] brother adam said brother of adam said
[1:28:26] brother adam said
[1:28:31] oh y'all wasn't so quick to answer then
[1:28:34] but we've got the same anointing on us
[1:28:37] if we raise brother branham to a level
[1:28:40] that god never put him
[1:28:42] and we raised him to a level of almost
[1:28:44] worship
[1:28:46] to where everything the man did was god
[1:28:48] everything the man said was god
[1:28:51] william branham was not god william
[1:28:54] branham was a son of god
[1:28:56] he was god's messenger of the ladies and
[1:28:58] church age he was the voice god used to
[1:29:00] lead us back to the scripture
[1:29:01] and to reveal those seven seals i'm
[1:29:04] talking about the mysteries now
[1:29:07] to show the bride who she was where she
[1:29:09] come from where she's going it was a
[1:29:10] vessel god used
[1:29:12] but never ever ever did god ever intend
[1:29:14] for us to worship that man
[1:29:17] and to let his name fall off our tongue
[1:29:18] more than we ever said the name jesus
[1:29:20] christ
[1:29:22] false bride did that
[1:29:26] because you see if they can't create
[1:29:27] their personalities in the in their own
[1:29:29] little ministerial groups
[1:29:31] if they believe in ministers well then
[1:29:33] it's easy they'll use the messenger
[1:29:35] they'll just grab his words and they'll
[1:29:37] hold him up as being the authority of it
[1:29:39] all
[1:29:41] and it's the same gentile spirit that
[1:29:44] worshiped images
[1:29:46] as those folks that you see when they
[1:29:48] come down there and they
[1:29:49] kneel to the toe of the pope
[1:29:52] i just hope the man washes his feet
[1:30:01] i'm not trying to be disrespectful or
[1:30:03] funny
[1:30:05] it's pitiful and we look at that and we
[1:30:08] think him
[1:30:08] poor blinded people and yet we do the
[1:30:12] same thing when we come into these
[1:30:13] churches
[1:30:14] and sit down here and name the name of
[1:30:16] this message
[1:30:18] and we hide how's in our heart
[1:30:19] incontinent fears
[1:30:22] despisers of those that are good when we
[1:30:24] project an image on the outside and it's
[1:30:26] not really on the inside
[1:30:29] we're doing no different than a bunch of
[1:30:31] people that scrape their knees on the
[1:30:32] concrete trying to find penance before
[1:30:34] god
[1:30:36] come on somebody preach to me same
[1:30:39] spirit same anointing
[1:30:42] same revelation two minutes we're going
[1:30:46] home can you handle two minutes
[1:30:48] all right two minutes true sign and soda
[1:30:52] look
[1:30:52] there'll be a national showdown you know
[1:30:54] my mom told me this morning don't preach
[1:30:55] long you preach so long
[1:30:58] i'll try i'll try mama i'll try
[1:31:02] there'll be a power like they've never
[1:31:04] seen before trouble of it is this time
[1:31:06] it's going to be too late
[1:31:07] the doors will be closed remember we're
[1:31:10] at the end time
[1:31:12] he said the latter rain will come forth
[1:31:13] the mount carmel showdown as john the
[1:31:16] baptist fulfilled malachi 3 the
[1:31:17] messenger before his face
[1:31:19] planted the former reign was rejected by
[1:31:20] the churches the denominations and the
[1:31:22] pharisees and the sadducees in his day
[1:31:24] jesus had to come to mount
[1:31:25] transfiguration showdown and the
[1:31:28] forerunner the last days will sow the
[1:31:29] former rain
[1:31:31] and jesus jesus
[1:31:36] will be the showdown between
[1:31:37] denominations and creeds
[1:31:41] not doctrine not books not tapes not
[1:31:43] message
[1:31:45] jesus
[1:31:49] so if jesus is not on the inside
[1:31:53] then the real showdown comes between
[1:31:57] you and jesus
[1:32:02] god help me say this right but some of
[1:32:05] you folks have been sitting in here for
[1:32:06] 30 years
[1:32:07] maybe you started with brother tom
[1:32:12] if you are still not sure whether you're
[1:32:13] born again or not don't you reckon it's
[1:32:15] about time to get down to business
[1:32:20] we are not only at the end of it we're
[1:32:22] at the end of the end of the end
[1:32:26] too many things are happening around us
[1:32:28] for not to be close
[1:32:30] then again we could go 40 years we don't
[1:32:32] know i don't see how we could but we
[1:32:34] could
[1:32:36] brad mean you get old one day if that
[1:32:39] happens
[1:32:40] i feel like i'm kind of almost there how
[1:32:42] about you
[1:32:45] but eventually down the line somewhere
[1:32:48] we're going to have to admit to ourself
[1:32:51] the real showdown between the true bride
[1:32:53] and the false bride isn't
[1:32:54] okay what do they believe listen to me
[1:32:57] listen
[1:32:57] i feel i feel pressure i know you want
[1:32:59] me to quit i'm almost there
[1:33:01] just bear with me another moment
[1:33:05] set this one bride here that's a false
[1:33:08] one
[1:33:08] okay set the true one right there let's
[1:33:10] question and answer them
[1:33:12] right what do you believe on the godhead
[1:33:15] both of them are going to tell you i
[1:33:16] believe in one god
[1:33:18] his name is jesus christ how are you
[1:33:21] supposed to be baptized in the name of
[1:33:22] jesus christ for the mission of your
[1:33:24] sins water baptism
[1:33:26] how are you going to heaven believe the
[1:33:27] message get the token
[1:33:29] we're going to give you all those same
[1:33:30] standard answers
[1:33:33] moses snaring through down there rods
[1:33:35] magicians threw down their runs
[1:33:38] how are you gonna know who the real ones
[1:33:42] are because this group
[1:33:46] don't have jesus on the inside this
[1:33:50] group
[1:33:50] has jesus on the inside
[1:33:55] that's the real showdown brother
[1:33:58] the real showdown ain't got nothing to
[1:33:59] do oh brother time i finally figured it
[1:34:02] out
[1:34:03] i understand what tim plagues was in the
[1:34:05] fifth seal now
[1:34:07] praise god brother you're on your way
[1:34:11] and it got nothing to do with it i know
[1:34:14] god will reveal things to us out of his
[1:34:15] word
[1:34:16] i certainly don't discount the need for
[1:34:18] revelation
[1:34:23] but when it comes down to evening light
[1:34:25] tabernacle and whether or not we going
[1:34:26] out of here
[1:34:28] you better have more than just a form of
[1:34:32] godliness
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:36] you want to know how you test it
[1:34:39] i'm done let's go to the four let's go
[1:34:41] to the first scripture you wanna know
[1:34:42] how to test it
[1:34:45] look inside your heart and just pick it
[1:34:48] up at verse 2.
[1:34:50] if it says men you put woman there okay
[1:34:54] men shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:34:57] you want to test yourself
[1:34:59] look at your life and say am i a lover
[1:35:01] of my own self
[1:35:03] because y'all better said eternal life
[1:35:05] is living for somebody else
[1:35:08] and not just for the people that are
[1:35:09] good to you but eternal life is living
[1:35:10] for those that would kill you
[1:35:18] praise the lord covetous
[1:35:23] i mean we can go on the rest of the
[1:35:25] morning you get that right
[1:35:27] all you got to do is test that heart out
[1:35:31] is this in me is this in me
[1:35:34] is this in me do i do these things
[1:35:37] because i'm just falling prey to
[1:35:39] influences and i bow to pressure and i
[1:35:41] i get under the wrong influences i do
[1:35:43] these things when i do them
[1:35:45] i feel convicted i repent that's a good
[1:35:47] sign right there too
[1:35:50] it's not that the elect won't ever do
[1:35:51] things like this
[1:35:54] some elect may be have uh parts of their
[1:35:56] nature for example let me give you an
[1:35:58] example some people that
[1:36:00] uh an example would be that some people
[1:36:02] love pleasure
[1:36:04] sports fanatics i'm not i'm not here
[1:36:07] kicking at your football or not i'm just
[1:36:09] saying
[1:36:10] you may have loved it all your life you
[1:36:11] may really really love it
[1:36:14] and there's nothing wrong with enjoying
[1:36:15] a football game
[1:36:17] but when you love that thing more than
[1:36:19] you love god you need to get down to
[1:36:20] business and say lord take that out of
[1:36:22] my heart
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:27] friends i know people in this message
[1:36:29] that go to football games on sunday
[1:36:31] nascar on sunday
[1:36:32] they'll go to baseball games wednesday
[1:36:34] night instead of going to the house of
[1:36:36] god
[1:36:36] because they're just going to hear the
[1:36:38] same thing they have always heard and
[1:36:39] they're bored and uninterested
[1:36:41] and that helps them more than being in
[1:36:43] the house of god
[1:36:46] you know what brother graham said he
[1:36:48] said it is a joy to go to church
[1:36:52] under any circumstance whether it's cold
[1:36:56] or indifferent whether the people are
[1:36:57] fussing or fighting whether they're up
[1:36:59] down whether it's this way or that
[1:37:00] he said it is a joy
[1:37:05] come on somebody it is a try to go to
[1:37:08] the house of god
[1:37:13] we get bored oh come on don't look at me
[1:37:16] like that
[1:37:16] i know i can't admit that in church what
[1:37:19] would he think of me
[1:37:20] i think you're an honest human being
[1:37:21] instead of being that cardboard cutout
[1:37:23] you've been for the last 10 years
[1:37:26] [Laughter]
[1:37:30] we get bored sometimes i get that
[1:37:33] we have to entertain ourself i get that
[1:37:36] brother branham's entertainment was to
[1:37:38] grab a gun to grab a bag and go out to
[1:37:40] the woods and lay in the coal with
[1:37:42] icicles on his beard with squirrel blood
[1:37:44] all over him
[1:37:45] no thank you i'll pass
[1:37:50] i don't like the cold i don't like the
[1:37:52] heat
[1:37:53] i don't like nature i don't like i like
[1:37:56] guns
[1:37:59] i like shooting i'm a good shot
[1:38:03] i don't like all that that's not me so
[1:38:06] it'd be easy for me to have certain type
[1:38:08] of pleasure and maybe
[1:38:09] fall into that thing well you know
[1:38:13] it's wednesday night oh you know
[1:38:17] but you check yourself is that in my
[1:38:19] heart more
[1:38:21] than loving god if you can look inside
[1:38:24] yourself and see these things
[1:38:26] are the dominant influence in your life
[1:38:29] listen my words carefully
[1:38:30] if you can look and see these are the
[1:38:33] dominant
[1:38:34] influences of your life you better get
[1:38:35] down to business
[1:38:39] because only a christian i'm not saying
[1:38:41] you won't do this
[1:38:43] i'm not saying you won't be a traitor
[1:38:44] sometimes any men in here ever had to
[1:38:47] repent to their wife
[1:38:50] she thinks you're a traitor right now
[1:38:51] you know you know
[1:38:53] certain little things you know i'm
[1:38:54] talking about you do little errors or
[1:38:56] little
[1:38:57] things like that you know that little
[1:38:59] feminine type nature i mean you betrayed
[1:39:01] them
[1:39:02] you you broke you shattered everything
[1:39:06] that's one reason they run in the room
[1:39:07] shut the door i can't believe you after
[1:39:10] all of these years
[1:39:11] you're a traitor oh some of you men are
[1:39:14] scared to death a holler a man
[1:39:20] sure so you look at that you say well
[1:39:24] you know this is brother carol talk baby
[1:39:26] doll he'd say
[1:39:29] i'm sorry i did that i'm sorry i said
[1:39:31] that i'm sorry i acted that way
[1:39:33] well see that's what christians do when
[1:39:34] they recognize these kind of things
[1:39:35] raising up in their heart
[1:39:36] they say god forgive me but false pride
[1:39:40] brother tom
[1:39:41] they make excuses for it
[1:39:44] oh it's always somebody else's fault
[1:39:45] there's always response somebody else
[1:39:47] did it was
[1:39:48] let me tell you something one of the
[1:39:49] worst things you can do trying to repent
[1:39:51] is not to repent you know what i mean by
[1:39:54] that right
[1:39:56] when you start saying well i i'm sorry
[1:39:58] but
[1:40:00] you got messed up right there there is
[1:40:03] no i'm sorry but
[1:40:06] if you're sorry you'll just be sorry
[1:40:09] i repent i make it right i'm sorry i did
[1:40:12] that but if you
[1:40:13] had that oh you're not repenting you're
[1:40:15] starting to fight
[1:40:17] hush be quiet repent
[1:40:23] don't start that old nonsense like that
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] but i'm gonna give her a piece of my
[1:40:31] mind and she's gonna know it be careful
[1:40:32] how many pieces of your mind you give
[1:40:34] away you may be regretting
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:40] but you say brother ben i do see these
[1:40:42] things in my life what do i do
[1:40:44] repent don't go to god don't do that
[1:40:48] don't do that don't come to him and say
[1:40:50] lord
[1:40:51] i'm sorry but you know my daddy
[1:41:00] lord i take responsibility for what's
[1:41:03] inside of me
[1:41:05] and i'm sorry it's there and i want you
[1:41:09] to fix me
[1:41:13] if you ever get there you'll be in a
[1:41:15] whole lot better position than all that
[1:41:16] other nonsense
[1:41:19] don't make excuses one last statement
[1:41:22] we're going to quit
[1:41:23] done 20 after 12. i'm a liar you know
[1:41:26] that
[1:41:26] i'm going to preach quick to you uh-huh
[1:41:29] sure nobody believes that in this church
[1:41:31] let me tell you that right now
[1:41:34] truth the matter is i only preached
[1:41:35] about an hour or so with all that
[1:41:36] singing it seemed long
[1:41:39] but
[1:41:42] when you're talking about the false
[1:41:43] group just just look
[1:41:46] in revelation one time when god says i
[1:41:49] give her a space
[1:41:52] to repent but but what does she do
[1:41:56] just like balaam just like saul
[1:41:59] remember when saul got caught
[1:42:02] first thing saul started doing was
[1:42:04] blaming the people
[1:42:08] well samuel you know what's the bleeding
[1:42:11] of this oxen i hear well you know the
[1:42:13] people uh-huh
[1:42:14] and who's king over those people who was
[1:42:17] their boss
[1:42:19] who's the one that could have told ten
[1:42:20] men to go take care of it but you didn't
[1:42:26] right look at the difference in david
[1:42:28] and saul
[1:42:30] when nathanael come up and said let me
[1:42:31] tell you a story and such and such and
[1:42:32] so-and-so happened and
[1:42:34] on and on and whatever whatever whatever
[1:42:36] and david was standing there david
[1:42:37] didn't say but you know
[1:42:38] you don't remember what i went through
[1:42:40] with saul do you
[1:42:42] nathanael said thou art the man
[1:42:45] listen david had such a right attitude
[1:42:49] that god asked him how he wanted to be
[1:42:54] whipped
[1:42:57] do you want famine do you want
[1:42:58] pestilence what do you want
[1:43:01] i'm going to tell you something if a man
[1:43:03] without the holy ghost can live that
[1:43:05] close to the lord
[1:43:06] i want to have such a repentant attitude
[1:43:08] before god that when i mess up the lord
[1:43:10] gives me a choice
[1:43:12] of how i can take my weapon
[1:43:16] god just didn't pour it out on him he
[1:43:18] had a relationship with david
[1:43:22] and david didn't make excuses either
[1:43:25] he just come clean
[1:43:29] i'm sorry that's one reason dave
[1:43:34] if it was a man how to repent
[1:43:40] this other group will boycott you
[1:43:43] because they think that your tender
[1:43:45] attitude is a weakness
[1:43:48] they think that repented attitude is a
[1:43:51] weakness
[1:43:53] i've heard preachers say it i've never
[1:43:56] seen the gifts benefit a church
[1:43:59] i heard a man say that one time packing
[1:44:02] a bible in his arm
[1:44:03] calling brother man's name every few
[1:44:04] seconds
[1:44:07] what a shame of course what gifts they
[1:44:11] refer to as tongue interpretation and
[1:44:12] prophecy
[1:44:13] but when they get sick they sure want
[1:44:16] the gift of healing
[1:44:20] when they got devils come up in their
[1:44:21] home they sure want discernment to show
[1:44:23] up
[1:44:26] but this false group don't want nothing
[1:44:27] to do with anything supernatural
[1:44:29] they perceive that surrender to god as a
[1:44:32] complete
[1:44:33] weakness oh and have i got a message for
[1:44:36] you in closing
[1:44:38] that's what god wants out of us
[1:44:42] complete and total weakness because
[1:44:48] brother john when i get so weak
[1:44:50] that i can't fight anymore that's when
[1:44:53] jesus can take over
[1:44:56] and do things that my mind can't even
[1:45:00] comprehend
[1:45:03] it is a bride war how do you know what
[1:45:07] side you're on
[1:45:10] i know what side i'm on because i can be
[1:45:12] corrected
[1:45:14] by the word that's how i know who i am
[1:45:19] it doesn't mean i won't make mistakes i
[1:45:21] don't want me to mess up a thousand
[1:45:23] times
[1:45:25] it don't mean that i won't dave ramsey
[1:45:27] do stupid with zeros on the ends of it
[1:45:31] but it means when i do i'm willing
[1:45:35] to revent
[1:45:40] i thought you hasn't been just a moment
[1:45:45] all right here comes the showdown for
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:50] while you're sitting there this morning
[1:45:55] why don't you just just shut out
[1:45:58] everybody around you
[1:46:00] don't think about the time don't think
[1:46:02] about
[1:46:03] church after before next week don't
[1:46:07] think about nothing
[1:46:09] just steal your mind
[1:46:13] and then your thoughts just ask yourself
[1:46:17] this question
[1:46:19] lord
[1:46:22] is there any of these things that i've
[1:46:23] read in the bible today are they in my
[1:46:25] heart
[1:46:28] because if they are lord if they're in
[1:46:30] my heart
[1:46:32] i need a real move from you in the way
[1:46:34] of salvation
[1:46:36] and being born again by the holy ghost
[1:46:42] if you be willing to say that
[1:46:46] you'd be willing to be honest before the
[1:46:48] lord would you do me the
[1:46:50] favor and the honor i promise i will not
[1:46:53] repeat what i
[1:46:53] see i won't tell my wife i won't tell
[1:46:56] nobody
[1:46:57] only god and i alone will know what hand
[1:46:59] goes up next
[1:47:00] but if you're willing to be honest
[1:47:02] before the lord and say god i've got
[1:47:04] these things in my heart and i need to
[1:47:05] be born again would you slip your hand
[1:47:07] up to the lord so i can pray for you
[1:47:15] god bless those with your hands up
[1:47:18] i'm not even going to identify how many
[1:47:20] are
[1:47:21] sides of the building or where it might
[1:47:23] be at i'm just going to give you privacy
[1:47:24] because i don't want you to feel
[1:47:26] pressured by a preacher but if you know
[1:47:29] these things are in your heart you know
[1:47:30] you need to get right with god
[1:47:33] i need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:47:36] i've got to get this stuff out of me
[1:47:37] because it dominates my life
[1:47:40] bad attitude bad spirit bad thoughts bad
[1:47:43] this bad that i can't seem to get
[1:47:44] victory to save my life
[1:47:46] you need the holy ghost friend
[1:47:50] now if you're willing to say that i
[1:47:51] believe god's willing not to meet you
[1:47:53] just halfway i believe he's willing to
[1:47:54] meet you all the way
[1:47:57] i wonder if you'd stand with me as a
[1:47:59] body this morning let's pray for each
[1:48:01] other can we
[1:48:05] let's ask the lord to help us each
[1:48:08] now i saw your hands i know who you are
[1:48:10] but
[1:48:12] i promise i'm not going to repeat
[1:48:13] nothing to nobody i wouldn't want to
[1:48:15] embarrass you like that
[1:48:17] i wouldn't want nobody to think less of
[1:48:18] you but i want you to have an
[1:48:20] opportunity to be honest before the lord
[1:48:24] and when you're standing there i want
[1:48:25] you to listen to me in just a moment
[1:48:27] once you
[1:48:27] hear my words what i'm going to say put
[1:48:29] it in your mind put it in your spirit
[1:48:32] you do not need me to lay my hands on
[1:48:34] you to be right
[1:48:36] you do not need brother tom or any other
[1:48:37] preacher in this building to lay their
[1:48:39] hands on you to get you right
[1:48:41] you do not need a great loud with our
[1:48:44] sister on the piano and our brother on
[1:48:46] the base of a bunch of
[1:48:47] music and things to make that kind of
[1:48:49] decision all
[1:48:50] you need is to just decide in your heart
[1:48:54] right now
[1:48:56] god from here on out i'm asking you to
[1:49:00] take a hold of the reigns
[1:49:03] take over and move forward from here on
[1:49:05] out you the boss
[1:49:08] because if you ever get desperate enough
[1:49:10] in your heart my precious friend that
[1:49:11] raised your hands
[1:49:13] if you ever get desperate enough that
[1:49:14] you realize you've come to a spot you
[1:49:16] realize you can't do it
[1:49:18] that's when a holy ghost can step in and
[1:49:20] do things you never even dreamed of
[1:49:24] but you be serious with god and watch
[1:49:26] and see if the lord ain't serious with
[1:49:27] you
[1:49:28] now in a moment when we start praying if
[1:49:31] you start feeling happy and the lord
[1:49:32] moves on you and you want to cut up
[1:49:34] well then i guess the cat's out of the
[1:49:35] bag of who you are then
[1:49:37] but that's up to you i'll keep your
[1:49:40] privacy i promise i won't reveal it to
[1:49:42] nobody not my wife not nobody only
[1:49:44] god alone in prayer will know those that
[1:49:47] i'm praying for
[1:49:50] perhaps brother tom was able to look as
[1:49:51] well i'm sure his heart's right there
[1:49:53] with me in the same way i'm sure
[1:49:56] as a pastor he wants to see his sheep
[1:49:57] come closer to god
[1:49:59] a man don't labor like he has all these
[1:50:01] years and my 30 years i've given to him
[1:50:04] since a boy you don't do them things
[1:50:05] because you just want to stand up here
[1:50:06] and be recognized as a preacher you're
[1:50:07] trying to help folks
[1:50:10] i want to see you get somewhere with the
[1:50:11] lord this morning
[1:50:13] so me and business i know this may seem
[1:50:17] a little baptist
[1:50:18] well just raise my hand and pray but you
[1:50:20] know really
[1:50:21] sometimes that's called for
[1:50:25] because when the lord moves on you this
[1:50:27] morning and i'm telling you he's going
[1:50:28] to move on some of you
[1:50:29] i already feel that in the anointing
[1:50:31] coming
[1:50:33] i'm just lingering just a moment because
[1:50:34] i'm waiting for faith to build to a spot
[1:50:36] i feel something moving but i'm just
[1:50:38] holding steady just a moment but
[1:50:41] when he does move on you heart
[1:50:44] no man deserves the credit
[1:50:48] and no man deserves the praise for what
[1:50:50] god does for you today
[1:50:53] if you've got real faith and you believe
[1:50:55] it watch and see if something don't
[1:50:57] change today
[1:50:59] if you believe what i've said is the
[1:51:00] truth pray with me with all your heart
[1:51:02] now
[1:51:03] you believers those that didn't raise
[1:51:05] your hand you with the holy ghost
[1:51:06] there were several one up i want you to
[1:51:07] help me pray all right
[1:51:09] ask the lord to be mindful let's join
[1:51:12] our hearts together now
[1:51:14] lord jesus so we stand here lord jesus
[1:51:17] in this
[1:51:18] cold december morning lord god
[1:51:22] coming to the close of such a tumultuous
[1:51:25] year and
[1:51:27] so many things have transpired and lord
[1:51:30] god no doubt
[1:51:31] fear and other things have crept into
[1:51:33] the hearts of people and
[1:51:35] lord no doubt their minds are muddled up
[1:51:37] with all kinds of confusions and
[1:51:40] lord influences from everything from
[1:51:42] social media to the news to
[1:51:44] lord everything around us from even
[1:51:47] press reports from the white house lord
[1:51:48] and just
[1:51:49] somehow our minds are shook our hearts
[1:51:52] are shook our lives are shook apart
[1:51:54] with what this world is calling a new
[1:51:56] normal
[1:51:57] lord jesus with all we see going on
[1:52:00] around us
[1:52:01] i can only believe that lord when you
[1:52:03] begin pulling out the feathers from
[1:52:05] underneath the nest
[1:52:07] that lord it means it's time for the
[1:52:09] eagles to learn how to fly on their own
[1:52:11] so lord jesus we want to come to you
[1:52:14] great mother eagle
[1:52:16] lord as you let us spin and topsy turvy
[1:52:19] down through this
[1:52:20] lord this course this walk of life
[1:52:22] father we know that we may
[1:52:24] fall we may make mistakes we may falter
[1:52:27] but lord jesus that thy watchful eyes
[1:52:30] upon a rock
[1:52:31] lord if we got too far down you can fly
[1:52:34] faster than we can fall
[1:52:36] for thy watchful eyes over us every
[1:52:38] moment every hour
[1:52:40] lord jesus thou art mindful of every
[1:52:42] heart
[1:52:43] lord of every soul of every thought of
[1:52:45] every intention
[1:52:47] lord from those and the youngest lord
[1:52:49] plum to the oldest representative
[1:52:51] in this group maybe across the internet
[1:52:53] this morning lord there'll be a little
[1:52:54] population that'll have their hand
[1:52:56] raised lord in their living room
[1:52:58] or where they might be sitting oh god
[1:53:01] thou who sees the end from the beginning
[1:53:03] i pray that you will move into this
