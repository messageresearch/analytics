[33:20] children can be dismissed for sunday

[33:24] we're going to go to psalm 71.
[33:34] we're going to go to
[33:37] 71 and we're going to read uh
[33:39] we're going to start in verse 1 and i
[33:41] think we'll read to verse 12 there and
[33:42] then
[33:45] in the o lord do i put my trust let me

[34:34] i am as a wonder unto many but thou art
[34:36] my strong refuge
[34:43] ask me not off in the time of old age
[34:46] forsake me not when my strength faileth
[34:56] saying god hath forsaken him persecute
[34:58] and take him for there is none to
[35:00] deliver him o god be not far from me o
[35:05] my god make haste for my help god bless
[35:08] you may be seated brother brian
[35:23] morning brothers and sisters
[35:27] if you return with me uh
[35:29] to the 16th chapter of the gospel of
[35:31] john
[35:33] i have to i have to use
[35:36] something else because that part of my
[35:38] bible is slowly but surely falling apart
[35:41] staples aren't in it
[35:43] you know you know that psalm
[35:45] as
[35:46] part of that psalm
[35:48] in my office i was thinking about this
[35:50] morning
[35:51] you know that when you get older
[35:54] you don't want god to forsake you as the
[35:57] older you get or the it doesn't make a
[35:59] difference where you're at in your life
[36:00] it just lets you know how more dependent
[36:03] you're on his grace and mercy for you
[36:06] the older you get you realize you
[36:08] weren't what you were when you were 20.
[36:10] and i was just thinking about that this
[36:12] morning i was down to my office praying
[36:15] and
[36:16] just reading my bible and listening and
[36:18] something
[36:20] touched my heart saying he you know god
[36:22] basically i can only speak in my own
[36:24] words he knocked and said i told you
[36:27] this day was coming you know i only
[36:30] speaking for myself you know and
[36:32] everyone knows who i am and the kind of
[36:34] person i am you know
[36:36] but eventually you realize that you're
[36:38] not as strong as you think you are
[36:40] you're not as
[36:41] you don't have as much energy as you
[36:43] think you have and something spoke to me
[36:44] this morning let me know that you're at
[36:46] that time you know and i'm not in a bad
[36:49] way
[36:50] being not being humorous either just
[36:52] letting you know you might have been a
[36:54] machine all your life but eventually
[36:55] even machines break down
[36:57] even even the best the machines are
[36:59] eventually going to break down so sooner
[37:02] or later the only thing that you can
[37:03] hold to
[37:05] is god's word and his grace for you no
[37:07] matter what's happened
[37:08] you know
[37:10] and i've realized as i get older things
[37:12] that you thought were so easy to do when
[37:14] you were 20 are not the same thing to do
[37:16] when you're in your 60s not that i would
[37:18] ever let it affect me i'm still going to
[37:20] do what i did when i was 20. but you
[37:22] know that's just who i am but i was
[37:24] thinking in this
[37:25] gospel of john i was wanting to read
[37:27] this out of pilgrim's progress though
[37:29] before i get started
[37:30] this is in the second part
[37:32] there's two parts to it
[37:35] and this is the interpreter he's talking
[37:37] to christina and her children
[37:40] and mercy and the other people in this
[37:42] book i don't know if any you've ever
[37:44] read both parts a lot of people just
[37:46] focus on the first part
[37:48] and this is the second part
[37:50] but it uh it's this is what interpreter
[37:53] says it's on page 238 i don't
[37:56] the pages might be different in your
[37:58] book that you have it
[37:59] then interpreter began to say and that
[38:01] they were
[38:02] asking to be taught from an interpreter
[38:05] i said
[38:06] in
[38:07] this is
[38:09] riddles and
[38:11] you know and not getting into english
[38:13] but it says fatter the cell is the more
[38:16] she desires
[38:17] the mire and these are just truths in
[38:20] this day and they do the same today the
[38:22] fatter the ox is the more gamercy he is
[38:25] to the slaughter
[38:26] and he goes on to say and the more
[38:28] healthy the lusty man is the more prone
[38:31] he is on the evil now that last sentence
[38:34] there is really true
[38:36] when you think you're prospering and
[38:38] you've got all the wealth of the world
[38:41] it tends to make you even more sinful
[38:43] you reach and grab out for things that
[38:45] you know you shouldn't reach out for you
[38:47] just become worse
[38:48] there are just some people god give them
[38:50] riches and they just they become more
[38:53] profane with it and it goes on to say
[38:56] there is a desire in women you know this
[38:58] was don't i'm not trying to be funny
[39:00] here but this was written
[39:02] by
[39:03] 16th century so we're talking almost 500
[39:06] years ago
[39:07] things don't change there's a desire in
[39:10] women to go neat and fine
[39:12] and it is calmly thing to be adorned
[39:14] with that that in god's side is a great
[39:17] price
[39:18] it's just easier watching a night or two
[39:20] than to sit up a whole year together
[39:23] so it's just easier for one to begin to
[39:25] profess well
[39:27] then to hold on as he should
[39:29] to the end and and this speaks to the
[39:32] age that we live in brother joe was
[39:34] praying about it
[39:35] you know that the sad thing is to start
[39:37] as a young man 40 years ago
[39:40] believing the medicine
[39:42] believing in salvation and all of a
[39:44] sudden to get 40 years down the road and
[39:47] to totally walk away from it that would
[39:50] be a that's to me is a horrible thing
[39:53] and he goes
[39:54] say every ship's master when in the
[39:56] storm will willingly cast that overboard
[39:59] that is of the smallest value in the
[40:01] vessel
[40:03] but he who will throw the best out first
[40:05] none but he
[40:06] that feareth not god so proportionally
[40:10] we have to throw out the it's basically
[40:12] saying what are you holding on to in
[40:14] your storms are you holding on to things
[40:16] that you shouldn't be holding on to are
[40:18] you willing to throw overboard in your
[40:20] life
[40:21] and then the things that don't matter
[40:23] are you willing to so your ship is right
[40:26] and safe and he goes on one link will
[40:28] one link leak will sink a ship and one
[40:31] sin will destroy the center
[40:33] and uh you know
[40:35] we're all landlocked here but if
[40:38] and you know lakes are a little bit
[40:40] different rivers are different you know
[40:41] you're close to shore
[40:43] but when you're 30 or 40 or 50 or a
[40:46] thousand miles out to sea and your ship
[40:48] has a leak in it that's a total
[40:50] different experience and that's the same
[40:52] with your life when you're out there and
[40:54] all of a sudden you've got holes in your
[40:56] experience you've got holes in your
[40:59] revelation you're just a lincoln ship
[41:02] and you're gonna you're gonna fail if
[41:05] you don't go back to the truth and it
[41:06] goes on
[41:08] he that forgets his friends is un
[41:10] ungrateful unto him he that forgets his
[41:12] savior is unmerciful to himself
[41:15] and that's a truth that can't be changed
[41:18] right there you can't forget who your
[41:20] god is and who your
[41:22] savior is
[41:23] and then he that lives and sins looks
[41:25] for happiness there
[41:27] yeah
[41:29] i'm a habit of losing my places he that
[41:31] lives in sin looks for the happiness
[41:33] thereafter it's like to him that's so
[41:36] with the cockle
[41:37] thinks to fill his barn with we are
[41:39] barley
[41:40] and basically what he's saying here in
[41:41] the sentence
[41:42] is that he's perverted his storage house
[41:45] because he's put things in there that
[41:47] are unclean and then this is what i was
[41:50] thinking about this morning
[41:53] it's in the psalms it's in proverbs it's
[41:56] in the scriptures to say this is where a
[41:59] lot of this comes from
[42:00] if a man would live well let him fetch
[42:02] his last day to him and make it always
[42:05] his company keeper so what
[42:08] interpreter is saying here you should
[42:10] live each day of your life knowing that
[42:12] you're going to die the next day and the
[42:14] way you live your life would be in a way
[42:17] that whatever happens the next day
[42:19] there's
[42:20] there's no shortcomings there's no
[42:22] regrets there's nothing in that next day
[42:25] and that's the problem with people you
[42:28] we all forget that one day we're going
[42:30] to have to come to that experience
[42:32] unless you're raptured out so we should
[42:34] live each day like tomorrow we're not
[42:36] going to be here and he goes on to say
[42:39] here
[42:41] uh whispering and change of thoughts
[42:43] proves that sin is in the world
[42:45] if the world which god sets light on by
[42:48] is counted a thing of the worth with man
[42:51] what is heaven that god commandeth and
[42:53] i'll
[42:55] finish reading with that poor i was just
[42:57] wanting to read a few of these
[42:58] scriptures here i was thinking this
[43:00] morning
[43:04] in our life you know you're never alone
[43:06] christians are never alone sometimes
[43:09] your enemy will get you so
[43:12] burdened down with the things of life or
[43:14] the problems of life that sometimes you
[43:16] think it's all you and there's there's
[43:18] nothing there for you but you're really
[43:20] never alone and i'll just read some of
[43:22] these scriptures here i i read this
[43:24] whole chapter you'll have to forgive me
[43:27] but like i've said before i can never
[43:29] read god's word too much it's not what i
[43:31] think
[43:32] what i have to say it's what god's word
[43:34] has to say
[43:35] and this is chapter 16.
[43:38] you know i spent a lot of time in the
[43:39] book of john i'm i'm sure all you are
[43:41] the same way
[43:43] but i had to print it out because i
[43:44] can't read it with these pages in my
[43:47] bible or tore out
[43:48] these things
[43:49] jesus is talking
[43:52] this is after
[43:53] this is after
[43:54] communion and after the upper room and
[43:57] they've moved from that and they're in
[43:59] further down the dave these things that
[44:01] i spoken unto you that you should not be
[44:03] offended so
[44:05] you have the word of god this morning so
[44:08] you shouldn't be offended what your
[44:09] neighbor thinks but the man you work or
[44:12] the woman you work with thinks
[44:14] you you shouldn't even put
[44:16] don't get me wrong doesn't mean it
[44:18] doesn't
[44:20] hit the heart sometimes when people say
[44:22] evil things to you but in the end he's
[44:25] warned you here he should not be
[44:27] offended
[44:28] they should put you out of the synagogue
[44:30] say the time cometh or whosoever kill of
[44:32] you
[44:33] will think that he doeth god's service
[44:35] you know we think of the reformation
[44:38] and we think back in the time of paul
[44:40] and the apostles but
[44:42] we've come full stage at that point
[44:44] right now
[44:45] and these things they will do on you
[44:47] because they have not known the father
[44:49] nor me
[44:50] and the people in our country in the
[44:52] world wouldn't do the things that they
[44:54] do have they really known the father and
[44:57] it goes on but these things have i told
[44:58] you that when the time come you may
[45:01] remember that i told you them these
[45:03] things i said not unto you at the
[45:05] beginning because i was with you and
[45:08] this is throughout the ages i wrote a
[45:09] sentence between the two you know god
[45:12] has given in every age and every
[45:15] situation god gives truth to us he
[45:18] doesn't leave you alone and he just
[45:20] keeps working forward to the goal but
[45:22] now i go my way to him that sent me and
[45:25] none of you asked me whether this goes
[45:27] down because i have said these
[45:29] things on to you
[45:30] so that filled your heart
[45:33] and you know the disciples knew what was
[45:35] about to happen
[45:37] and they were having a hard time dealing
[45:38] with that fact they put a lot of
[45:40] confidence in jesus in a natural sense
[45:43] goes on to us as christians
[45:45] you know
[45:46] sometimes if you put your confidence in
[45:49] a man and a woman and they fall that'll
[45:51] shake your very experience unless you
[45:54] have the truth and he goes on to say
[45:55] when he come he will reprove the role of
[45:57] sin and righteousness and of judgment
[45:59] and of sin because they believe not me
[46:02] of righteousness because i go to my
[46:03] father and you see me no more enough
[46:06] judgment because the prince of this
[46:08] world is judged
[46:10] i have men yet many things to say
[46:13] to you but you cannot bear them now i
[46:15] bet when the spirit of truth has come he
[46:17] will guide you into all truth and he
[46:19] shall not speak of himself but whosoever
[46:22] shall hear
[46:23] that shall he speak and he shall show
[46:25] these things
[46:27] and uh i was just thinking i just wrote
[46:29] the sentence i don't want to take a lot
[46:31] of time this morning
[46:33] but
[46:35] every time everything we do in life
[46:38] is the lord or jesus christ glorified in
[46:42] who you are and in your ways
[46:44] and a lot of times as a man or as i only
[46:47] can speak for myself
[46:49] sometimes it's hard to get that small
[46:52] quiet place where god can show you how
[46:55] he sees you
[46:56] i mean sometimes we get so busy in the
[46:58] things of life a lot of times we realize
[47:01] on the outside we might not be what god
[47:04] wants us to be and you got to get really
[47:06] quiet sometimes for god to show you who
[47:09] you really are and i'll i'm jumping here
[47:11] i don't want to read this whole chapter
[47:14] and uh i'll start about the 28th verse
[47:18] it says i come forth from the father and
[47:20] i've come into the world again and i
[47:22] leave the world to go to the father
[47:24] and this disciple said on to him blood
[47:26] now speaketh out plainly and speaketh no
[47:30] proverb and we're the same there's no
[47:32] problems
[47:33] god has spoken plainly to us in this age
[47:36] you don't have any doubt and he goes on
[47:38] to say here
[47:40] how now we are sure that most all things
[47:42] need us not that anyone should ask thee
[47:45] by this we believe that thousands came
[47:47] forth from god
[47:49] and jesus answered them do you now
[47:51] believe behold the hour cometh yay has
[47:53] now come that ye shall be scattered
[47:55] every man to his own and shall leave me
[47:58] alone but yet i'm not alone
[48:00] because the father is with me and that's
[48:02] true for you all this morning you know
[48:04] you're never alone god is there for you
[48:07] these things have i spoken unto you that
[48:10] you might have peace in the world you
[48:12] shall have tribulation but be of good
[48:14] cheer i have overcome the world and
[48:17] jesus is telling his disciples this
[48:19] morning
[48:21] you know whatever the tribulations are
[48:23] whatever the problems in your life
[48:26] you can be at peace in god's word and in
[48:28] your experience i was just thinking this
[48:30] morning
[48:31] brother branham always said life is like
[48:33] a
[48:34] well i we would say a video but like a a
[48:37] movie camera he said back in his day
[48:40] life is like a video god is starting
[48:42] from the day you were born until the day
[48:44] you or you die and there's a video of
[48:47] everything you've said and done from one
[48:48] end of that stream
[48:50] to the other end of that stream
[48:53] and the only thing that changes that
[48:55] stream is you reaching out in faith and
[48:59] as reaching out to the savior and
[49:01] receiving salvation and grace so
[49:03] everything on that tape before then is
[49:06] put in god's sea of forgetfulness and
[49:08] every one of us this morning have to
[49:10] have that experience i i know i say this
[49:13] a lot but you can never say it enough
[49:15] you want that stream before you were a
[49:17] christian to be thrown into god's sea of
[49:19] forgetfulness so it won't be there on
[49:22] the other side you know the scripture
[49:24] says but i'm going the scripture says
[49:26] you know
[49:28] pete there's two type of people
[49:30] people that are judged now they judge
[49:32] themselves now so god can cleanse you
[49:35] and
[49:36] cleanse your heart and cleanse your life
[49:38] so that on the other side there's
[49:40] there's no reckoning and then there's
[49:42] other people that don't pay no attention
[49:44] to it and there are sins and those
[49:47] situations go to the other side and we
[49:49] don't want to be that group of people
[49:51] this morning where the ghost to the
[49:53] other side you want to be able to have
[49:55] the word of god judge you this morning
[49:57] that you stand pure before god on the
[49:59] other side that tape you know the only
[50:02] thing that changes that date this
[50:03] morning
[50:04] is you giving your heart and life to
[50:06] jesus christ this morning brother david
[50:18] let's stand if we could and sing that
[50:20] little course all my hope is in jesus
[50:23] this morning

[1:23:13] bring it to you it's it's all for all of
[1:23:15] us
[1:23:16] but
[1:23:17] i thought i might take one offering a
[1:23:19] year now
[1:23:20] one offering a year
[1:23:22] to
[1:23:23] towards the principal of the church amen
[1:23:26] and if we go right at 69 right now
[1:23:30] if let's say we get 10 000
[1:23:32] in each one of those offerings for the
[1:23:35] next three years that's going to be
[1:23:36] about 30 000 and brother brian seems to
[1:23:39] think if i'm not wrong that within that
[1:23:41] time frame that three year time frame we
[1:23:43] can probably in a regular paying pay
[1:23:45] extra and get it paid for within a three
[1:23:48] year period amen how many would like to
[1:23:50] do that
[1:23:52] amen because i believe
[1:23:54] we can i don't believe we have to push
[1:23:56] it out to eight years i believe we can
[1:23:57] do it amen in three by the grace of god
[1:23:59] i mean it's in my heart so um i'll let
[1:24:02] you know next sunday on the date so that
[1:24:04] everybody can get prepared or whatever
[1:24:06] give you a date uh on uh when we want to
[1:24:09] take that offering and when we do take
[1:24:10] that offering if anybody wants to give
[1:24:12] their offering before or whatever in a
[1:24:14] check form or whatever just designate it
[1:24:16] for that and give it to brother brian
[1:24:18] amen and we'll try to get this place
[1:24:20] paid for i'm tally would that be nice
[1:24:23] and we had to have it paid for i mean
[1:24:24] and then of course we can focus a little
[1:24:26] bit more perhaps on missionary amen and
[1:24:29] sending more i know we want to try to
[1:24:31] take two missionary offerings a year
[1:24:33] amen for the lord because you are not
[1:24:36] doing what god wants you to do if you're
[1:24:38] not doing missionary work amen let's go
[1:24:41] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:24:43] that is the commission to the church is
[1:24:45] to spread this gospel and the word of
[1:24:46] god
[1:24:47] amen
[1:24:48] so we'll do that and most likely either
[1:24:50] the first of august maybe first or next
[1:24:52] month or somewhere like right in there
[1:24:54] maybe we'll look at taking the offering
[1:24:56] okay
[1:24:57] all right god bless you stand with me
[1:24:58] this morning let's get into the word of
[1:25:00] god and we do want to have communion
[1:25:02] this morning amen and i thought it's
[1:25:04] that isn't it wonderful that this
[1:25:06] weekend we get to
[1:25:07] celebrate well i guess two of the
[1:25:10] greatest events
[1:25:11] probably in our life isn't that right
[1:25:14] and that is the declarative creation of
[1:25:15] independence and and talking about a
[1:25:18] nation perhaps that has had more freedom
[1:25:21] uh or just as much as freedoms as what
[1:25:23] israel would have had the greatest
[1:25:25] nations of freedom that that was ever in
[1:25:28] the world amen not to have to live under
[1:25:30] a dictatorship and live where we do and
[1:25:33] to this day i still thank god for my
[1:25:35] country i still thank god that i'm
[1:25:38] living where i'm living amen and we know
[1:25:40] we're going to get burned or they're
[1:25:42] going to get burnt but we have a promise
[1:25:44] that we're going to leave here brother
[1:25:45] glenn before we do get burned
[1:25:47] but there's a fire coming but amen we
[1:25:49] know that god's going to hold the future
[1:25:51] and we're glad
[1:25:52] that we know that that great god that
[1:25:56] holds our future amen we don't have to
[1:25:58] fear the future amen and his brother
[1:26:00] brian says we are not alone you don't
[1:26:02] walk alone you have somebody with you
[1:26:05] i'm glad for our present god this
[1:26:07] morning aren't you glad for god that's
[1:26:08] not just a god of history but he's a
[1:26:10] present god
[1:26:11] amen this morning i just
[1:26:13] i want to speak on when jesus comes and
[1:26:16] when jesus leaves
[1:26:18] would that be okay
[1:26:19] and i titled a very present help in
[1:26:21] trouble amen that's what i titled it but
[1:26:24] those two thoughts i want to speak on
[1:26:25] for a little while with the help of the
[1:26:26] lord this morning amen so if you will
[1:26:28] let's defy our heads before we amen open
[1:26:31] the word lord jesus we come before you
[1:26:33] lord with grateful hearts lord to be
[1:26:35] able to assemble together lord for we
[1:26:37] know according to your prophet lord that
[1:26:40] someday churches like this will be shut
[1:26:42] down father we won't have even the
[1:26:44] freedom to come and worship lord jesus
[1:26:47] and father already father they're
[1:26:49] burning down churches
[1:26:51] lord jesus so if it's at that place now
[1:26:53] lord wonder where are we at well you
[1:26:54] know we've never really heard of that
[1:26:56] much of it that way but lord now and and
[1:26:58] my father we just lord we realize it's a
[1:27:00] late hour god and we're living in
[1:27:02] troubled times lord jesus but father we
[1:27:05] don't have to be troubled
[1:27:07] father for that we ask god that you'll
[1:27:08] bless the reading of the word the
[1:27:10] meditation of our heart help me just to
[1:27:12] get out of the way that you might speak
[1:27:13] to us that it would draw us closer to
[1:27:15] you and that we would edify the body of
[1:27:17] christ lord and bring it to perfection
[1:27:19] bring it to the place that we should be
[1:27:21] father lord we thank you for your
[1:27:23] goodness for your healing for all the
[1:27:25] blessings you've bestowed upon us in
[1:27:27] jesus name
[1:27:29] amen and amen turn to psalms if you will
[1:27:32] we'll read the first scripture here in
[1:27:34] the book of psalms
[1:27:45] in the book of psalms the 46th chapter
[1:27:48] psalms 46
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:58] it says verse 1
[1:28:00] god is our refuge and strength
[1:28:03] a very present help
[1:28:06] in trouble amen
[1:28:08] praise be to god
[1:28:09] amen
[1:28:11] and then i want to read
[1:28:13] john 15 1-7 and we'll start with when
[1:28:17] jesus leaves would that be okay we'll
[1:28:19] start with the thought of when jesus
[1:28:21] leaves and over the prophet god preached
[1:28:23] the message when jesus comes amen
[1:28:26] amen when jesus comes amen
[1:28:29] but he also spoke of when he leaves the
[1:28:31] bible talks about when jesus leaves we
[1:28:33] want to dwell on that for maybe about 15
[1:28:35] minutes and then we'll go another 20 or
[1:28:37] so on when jesus comes
[1:28:39] all right
[1:28:40] in chapter 15 of saint john jesus says i
[1:28:43] am the vine and my father is a husband
[1:28:47] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:28:49] fruit he taketh away amen
[1:28:54] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:28:56] purges it that it bring may bring forth
[1:29:00] fruit more fruit amen
[1:29:02] this is where i get what i call that god
[1:29:05] is always working on us
[1:29:07] he's always trying to get more fruit out
[1:29:09] of us and they believe that
[1:29:11] and i'm sure that in our hearts we would
[1:29:13] say we're always trying to get
[1:29:15] closer to christ amen and bear more of
[1:29:18] christ's fruit
[1:29:19] you are clean through the word which i
[1:29:21] have spoken unto you abide in me and i
[1:29:23] and you as a branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:29:26] itself except it abide in the vine and
[1:29:28] no more can ye
[1:29:29] except he abide in me i am the vine
[1:29:32] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[1:29:35] me and i in him the same bringeth forth
[1:29:37] much fruit for without me you can do
[1:29:41] nothing amen
[1:29:43] how many have you ever tried to be a
[1:29:45] christian without the holy ghost
[1:29:47] well it just don't work
[1:29:48] too good does it no it just really
[1:29:51] doesn't work too good because it doesn't
[1:29:53] matter what you do you still feel the
[1:29:55] same
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:57] but if a man and if a man abide not in
[1:29:59] me he is
[1:30:01] cast forth
[1:30:03] as a branch
[1:30:05] and is withered
[1:30:07] and man men gather them and cast them
[1:30:10] into the fire and they are burned
[1:30:13] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:30:15] you you will you shall ask what you will
[1:30:18] and it shall be done unto you may god
[1:30:21] add his blessings to the reading of the
[1:30:22] word you can be seated this morning
[1:30:26] amen you know we're always praising god
[1:30:29] for what he has done or for what he will
[1:30:31] do
[1:30:32] but a lot of time we fail to recognize
[1:30:34] what god is doing this morning just as
[1:30:37] we are celebrating our independence
[1:30:39] we're celebrating and we're uh enjoying
[1:30:43] the blessing of something that happened
[1:30:45] long time ago
[1:30:47] amen this morning i want to praise god
[1:30:49] for what he has done
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] how many knows we can worship him what
[1:30:53] he has done we want to worship him in
[1:30:56] what he's doing
[1:30:59] amen
[1:31:00] because he's a very present how many
[1:31:02] know that god is not just a god of david
[1:31:05] and goliath he's not just a god of moses
[1:31:08] and great deliverance but he's that same
[1:31:10] god this morning
[1:31:14] amen praise the lord how many is glad to
[1:31:16] have him in your heart this morning
[1:31:18] i trust you have him in your heart
[1:31:19] because it doesn't mean a whole lot if
[1:31:21] you don't have him in your heart
[1:31:24] amen it's just something that somebody
[1:31:25] else has or a story of the testimony of
[1:31:29] somebody else not of you and i want a
[1:31:31] testimony of what that i have him in my
[1:31:33] heart
[1:31:35] amen
[1:31:37] praise be to god and also the god of the
[1:31:40] future now when we talk a little bit
[1:31:41] about christ amen when jesus comes how
[1:31:45] many knows jesus is going to come
[1:31:47] amen when he is going to come
[1:31:50] he has come
[1:31:52] and he is also here
[1:31:54] god many believes that and we certainly
[1:31:57] certainly are looking for his coming
[1:31:59] in our future amen in the future in the
[1:32:02] near future we're going to see him face
[1:32:04] the face
[1:32:06] whatever joy that you have whatever
[1:32:08] happiness you have you can multiply that
[1:32:11] a million times more
[1:32:14] when you have a body change and when you
[1:32:16] see him coming in the clouds of heaven
[1:32:19] how he believes that
[1:32:20] it's going to be a amen as the song says
[1:32:23] won't it be a
[1:32:24] time
[1:32:27] i can't sing it like brother jewel but i
[1:32:29] can try huh won't it be a time
[1:32:32] amen praise the lord i've been praising
[1:32:35] god for what he's going to be
[1:32:37] amen and never going to have a body
[1:32:39] change and we're not going to have to be
[1:32:40] in this world
[1:32:42] that jesus has left
[1:32:45] let me know that jesus has left this
[1:32:47] country
[1:32:52] this country that we love and that we
[1:32:54] cherish and so far so thankful for but
[1:32:56] yet
[1:32:56] i believe it was between 1956 and 1957.
[1:33:01] brother brown said that america has left
[1:33:05] and they have rejected christ
[1:33:07] they went beyond what he called he says
[1:33:10] he went over the line so to speak
[1:33:13] blasphemy there is no more return there
[1:33:16] is not a hope left for america
[1:33:20] now if i'm not wrong he says he don't
[1:33:21] even pray for anymore
[1:33:23] you might as well not pray for him it
[1:33:25] isn't going to do any good
[1:33:26] when god declares something it's done
[1:33:29] it's over with it's finished you can
[1:33:31] pray all you want to
[1:33:33] but now god is still with individuals
[1:33:35] let me know that god is still with
[1:33:37] anybody that'll repent and turn to god
[1:33:40] but as a nation he says now you watch it
[1:33:42] get worse and worse has it
[1:33:48] it has until it's fit for fire folks it
[1:33:52] is fit it is getting ready for the fire
[1:33:55] for the burning
[1:33:57] amen
[1:34:01] oh
[1:34:02] my the lord
[1:34:05] so
[1:34:06] when jesus leaves
[1:34:08] how many knows when christ leaves
[1:34:12] things wither
[1:34:15] wilt just like a flower that doesn't get
[1:34:17] any water
[1:34:19] it withers
[1:34:20] dries up
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:25] all right
[1:34:28] you know
[1:34:30] sin
[1:34:31] is the major cause of christ leaving our
[1:34:33] hearts and our lives
[1:34:35] we know that we can grieve the holy
[1:34:37] spirit away can't we
[1:34:39] you and i can grieve the holy spirit
[1:34:42] away
[1:34:44] but abraham i think it was in the church
[1:34:45] in its condition the first time you go
[1:34:47] to gospel boom there he goes
[1:34:50] you sit at the table and you choose a
[1:34:52] gossip about somebody remember the holy
[1:34:54] spirit left the second you thought to
[1:34:56] open your mouth to gossip about somebody
[1:34:58] he left
[1:35:01] because one thing we got to realize i
[1:35:03] want to realize that everything these
[1:35:04] hands do
[1:35:06] is it christ do it
[1:35:08] doing it
[1:35:11] every move i make them every thought i
[1:35:13] think every deed that i do is it christ
[1:35:15] doing it because if it isn't then it
[1:35:18] ain't right
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] we ask that question what would jesus do
[1:35:22] everything you do ask yourself would
[1:35:25] jesus do this
[1:35:31] isn't that good
[1:35:33] it would jesus do if he wouldn't do it
[1:35:35] then don't do it
[1:35:38] praise be to god
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] so we think about that sin causes him to
[1:35:45] leave
[1:35:46] amen because you know
[1:35:48] he talks about any any anybody that
[1:35:50] leaves him if you abide in me and i and
[1:35:53] you there's things that you can do that
[1:35:55] will absolutely cause him to leave your
[1:35:57] house
[1:36:00] and when he leaves
[1:36:02] trouble sets in
[1:36:04] bad things happen when christ leaves
[1:36:07] but said one place that ichabod was
[1:36:09] rolled over the doors of america
[1:36:13] the presence of god is departed
[1:36:18] the first time that we've not the first
[1:36:19] time but many times we know that when
[1:36:21] adam and eve left the presence of god
[1:36:23] when they sinned we realized that they
[1:36:25] went and hid themselves and god had to
[1:36:27] come looking for him
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:30] but over in samuel if you'll remember
[1:36:32] how that
[1:36:33] eli and his sons were doing evil and
[1:36:36] israel was doing evil and
[1:36:38] so forth and they were doing evil and uh
[1:36:42] they were fighting the philistines all
[1:36:44] right
[1:36:45] and they they went and uh fought the
[1:36:47] philistines and they were defeated so
[1:36:49] what they did in the fourth chapter
[1:36:51] first samuel is they went back and they
[1:36:53] got the ark of god and says you know
[1:36:56] we're going to bring the ark of god and
[1:36:57] then we're going to win
[1:36:59] and then it says that they shouted with
[1:37:02] a great shout
[1:37:05] they praise god hallelujah they praise
[1:37:08] god until the philistines says man we
[1:37:10] can't fight against them we know what he
[1:37:12] did with these people we know what he
[1:37:14] did with them people and the philistines
[1:37:17] military leaders had to say
[1:37:18] quit yourselves like men and fight come
[1:37:21] on don't let don't be their servant he
[1:37:22] had that they encouraged the philistines
[1:37:25] to fight the israelites
[1:37:29] and guess what they went to battle and
[1:37:31] all of israel shouting all of worshiping
[1:37:33] and even the ark of god being there
[1:37:36] didn't save them
[1:37:39] no matter how much they shouted
[1:37:41] sin was in the camp
[1:37:43] when the sin was in the camp
[1:37:45] they were they lost 30
[1:37:47] foot men
[1:37:49] thirty thousand foot men they lost
[1:37:52] and remember that uh eli's two sons also
[1:37:56] were killed in it
[1:37:58] and that right they were killed in the
[1:37:59] battle
[1:38:01] they came back and said you know we were
[1:38:03] defeated and not only that the ark of
[1:38:05] god
[1:38:06] had been taken away
[1:38:12] ma what a terrible things just goes to
[1:38:14] show you that it doesn't matter how you
[1:38:16] much you put on trying to be righteous
[1:38:19] it has to be right down here
[1:38:22] you got to be right not just to act
[1:38:24] israel was just going through the act
[1:38:26] surely shouted loud sure it sounded like
[1:38:28] thunder but god wasn't in it
[1:38:31] because things were wrong
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:35] think about judas how many knows that
[1:38:36] judas was fine
[1:38:38] until he left the lord
[1:38:40] in that right and betrayed him then he
[1:38:42] was so miserable that he couldn't stand
[1:38:45] himself and he went and hung himself he
[1:38:48] felt so bad he was so miserable so dried
[1:38:51] up huh
[1:38:54] see folks when jesus leaves
[1:38:56] trouble comes in
[1:38:58] we think about our country back to our
[1:39:00] country and our independence and how
[1:39:02] that all the way up to world war ii how
[1:39:05] that we fought the great super powers of
[1:39:08] the world i want you to know that hitler
[1:39:10] was a major threat
[1:39:12] he had better tanks
[1:39:15] if you ever say the history of it us
[1:39:17] americans barely had an army even
[1:39:20] we didn't hardly have any rifles and we
[1:39:21] were untrained
[1:39:23] huh
[1:39:27] very untrained but we had like you know
[1:39:30] like they said the slopes they woke up a
[1:39:32] sleeping giant
[1:39:36] oh i love this i love this because i
[1:39:39] don't care if it's russia right now if
[1:39:40] it was mark about then if god has
[1:39:43] ordained for that country to do a
[1:39:44] certain thing ain't nobody going to
[1:39:46] defeat that country
[1:39:48] that country's going to stand because we
[1:39:50] know the japs and what they did if they
[1:39:51] rushed just as ready as they were and as
[1:39:54] unready as we were if we didn't come if
[1:39:56] they didn't come on in they probably
[1:39:57] whooped us
[1:39:59] huh did a problem
[1:40:01] whooped us if you know
[1:40:03] technically speaking with the military
[1:40:04] they had
[1:40:06] but they were they were worried they
[1:40:07] were scared for some reason and they
[1:40:09] went back and gave us all kinds of time
[1:40:11] to recoup that's the worst thing to do
[1:40:12] for the enemy let them recruit because
[1:40:15] they're gonna be pretty mad like we were
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:19] but we think about the great superpowers
[1:40:21] like hitler like japan
[1:40:23] people who were absolutely gonna fight
[1:40:25] to the last child i mean they were
[1:40:28] having their little girls
[1:40:31] training them in the fight if we come
[1:40:32] all the way to their homeland they're
[1:40:34] gonna fight to the bitter end that's the
[1:40:36] kind of enemy we had
[1:40:39] that's where heroes were made
[1:40:41] people did heroic things
[1:40:44] when i think about the independence
[1:40:45] brother brad i think about every
[1:40:47] horror every
[1:40:49] horror
[1:40:51] of bloodshed
[1:40:52] of people getting literally their heads
[1:40:54] blowed off arms blown off legs blown off
[1:40:57] folks i would never want to have to see
[1:40:58] it would you
[1:41:00] but you think about the worst horror
[1:41:01] movie you ever watched if you ever
[1:41:03] watched one open not but the worst
[1:41:04] horror movie that's multiplied multi
[1:41:07] multiple times that is what we did and
[1:41:10] what people did what men did
[1:41:13] and how they died for our freedom
[1:41:17] folk i'm here to tell you our generation
[1:41:19] does not appreciate the blood and the
[1:41:21] guts that were spilled
[1:41:24] for our freedom so that we could be free
[1:41:26] because there was people that hitler
[1:41:28] didn't want he to come over here quicker
[1:41:29] than anything after england
[1:41:31] huh japan wanted to take us into into
[1:41:34] captivity or whatever think about it
[1:41:36] you know
[1:41:38] and we have to fight for our freedom
[1:41:40] but i think about it i think about the
[1:41:42] independence and how they sign we are
[1:41:44] not dependent upon them anymore what it
[1:41:46] costs
[1:41:47] then you think about albary hello and
[1:41:50] the cost that christ paid for you and i
[1:41:53] so that he could also declare
[1:41:56] our liberties
[1:42:01] it ought to be a little noisier in here
[1:42:04] think about it that he could declare you
[1:42:06] are no more slaves
[1:42:09] amen when he hung on the cross there he
[1:42:11] said it is done
[1:42:14] it is finished you are free
[1:42:19] how many please we're free free from sin
[1:42:22] free from the bondage of condemnation in
[1:42:25] our heart
[1:42:26] that's what we're free from amen that
[1:42:28] brings you joy brings you peace it
[1:42:31] brings you love oh my just brings all
[1:42:34] kinds of good things
[1:42:35] that's when jesus comes it's a different
[1:42:37] story
[1:42:38] amen
[1:42:40] but had sinned against god and god
[1:42:43] couldn't bless him and that's what sin
[1:42:45] does in each individual life amen and
[1:42:47] the don and his daughter-in-law
[1:42:50] phoenius's wife
[1:42:52] was with child near to be delivered and
[1:42:54] when she heard that the tidings that the
[1:42:56] ark of god was taken and that her
[1:42:58] father-in-law and her husbands were dead
[1:43:00] she bowed herself and travailed
[1:43:02] for her pains came upon her and about
[1:43:04] the time of her death
[1:43:06] huh think about it it was still
[1:43:08] terrible that in his childbirth it
[1:43:11] killed her
[1:43:12] she died
[1:43:16] that the woman by her said under her
[1:43:18] fear not that has borne his son
[1:43:20] but she acknowledged not neither did she
[1:43:22] regard it
[1:43:23] and she named the child ichabod
[1:43:27] jacob
[1:43:29] can you imagine that woman in travail of
[1:43:32] all the sorrow that it brought for the
[1:43:34] people to sin against god
[1:43:37] huh
[1:43:38] i want you to know it brings sorrow it
[1:43:41] brings despair to sin against god
[1:43:48] amen
[1:43:50] amen if she didn't she didn't even name
[1:43:52] it just the last perhaps the last word
[1:43:54] it means i named him ichabod
[1:43:59] what a horrible name to give a child
[1:44:02] but he was born in terrible times under
[1:44:04] terrible conditions isn't that right
[1:44:08] he had a terrible father
[1:44:11] amen
[1:44:12] because they did all kinds of evil with
[1:44:14] the congregation took the meats and this
[1:44:16] out of the other and lay with the women
[1:44:17] of the church and everything else evil
[1:44:19] in the presence of god
[1:44:22] amen
[1:44:23] called the son ichabod
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:28] say the glory
[1:44:30] of the lord is
[1:44:32] departed what a terrible thing
[1:44:36] when the glory of the lord departs folks
[1:44:39] it's a terrible thing
[1:44:42] because the ark was taken because her
[1:44:44] father-in-law and her husband and she
[1:44:46] said
[1:44:47] the glory of
[1:44:49] the glory is departed from israel and
[1:44:52] the ark of god is taken they had nothing
[1:44:55] i mean that's what it is when you leave
[1:44:58] the lord and get away from god you have
[1:45:00] nothing
[1:45:02] you ain't got no joy you ain't got no
[1:45:04] peace you ain't got no nothing anymore
[1:45:07] just get away from god and i'll tell you
[1:45:09] what trouble sets in
[1:45:11] brother brown makes a statement in
[1:45:13] resurrection he says and notice i want
[1:45:15] you to get this now
[1:45:16] jesus went away from the home of lazarus
[1:45:19] and when he left
[1:45:21] sorrow came in
[1:45:24] oh my let me say this to you christians
[1:45:26] when you leave
[1:45:27] when you when jesus leaves your house
[1:45:30] watch out sorrow is on its row
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:34] sorrow is on its road he says again when
[1:45:36] jesus leaves your home watch trouble as
[1:45:40] sure as he goes away trouble sets in
[1:45:47] if you drive him away with your sinful
[1:45:50] living and reckless and careless life
[1:45:52] sorrow is on its road
[1:45:55] listen evening night tabernacle don't
[1:45:57] you get reckless don't you get careless
[1:45:59] about your life
[1:46:00] and then if you aren't careful you'll
[1:46:02] drive him away
[1:46:04] and sorrow will sit in trouble will set
[1:46:07] in emptiness will set in
[1:46:10] future set in between you and your wife
[1:46:12] and your children and everybody will be
[1:46:14] all set all upset
[1:46:17] because there's no blessing outside of
[1:46:19] christ
[1:46:20] folks since america found out what it's
[1:46:22] like to try to fight a vietnam war and
[1:46:25] all these other wars should never be
[1:46:27] able to win
[1:46:29] why because if god ain't there it's
[1:46:31] ichabod
[1:46:33] folks i feel bad for those 60s 56 000
[1:46:37] the man i believe it was in vietnam that
[1:46:39] lost their lives just for us to pull out
[1:46:44] because when you lose a war everybody
[1:46:46] that died died in vain
[1:46:52] huh
[1:46:55] because you fought so hard to win
[1:46:56] something and you didn't
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:00] oh my
[1:47:03] trouble
[1:47:04] sets in
[1:47:06] evil sets in
[1:47:12] now jesus had left and when he left
[1:47:14] trouble came in now when he leaves you
[1:47:17] or you leave he
[1:47:19] leaves your home where you dwell at
[1:47:21] troubles on its road road satan's got an
[1:47:25] open door when jesus leaves
[1:47:30] isn't that exactly right well this uh
[1:47:32] spirit is going out of a man and so
[1:47:34] forth his house is cleaned and seven
[1:47:36] more evil spirits come in when christ
[1:47:39] goes out it leaves an open room for the
[1:47:41] devil to come in
[1:47:45] for evil to come in
[1:47:48] and let me tell you something
[1:47:50] our patrick hentry our george
[1:47:52] washington's and all those that were
[1:47:53] godly they're all gone
[1:47:55] now what has come in
[1:47:58] evil has come in
[1:48:01] even the things that ronald reagan says
[1:48:03] if it ever goes that way he says you
[1:48:05] watch it out then it's done
[1:48:07] and it's going that way
[1:48:10] huh
[1:48:11] no hope for this country no hope for
[1:48:13] this world
[1:48:14] but i'm glad to be tied to some kingdom
[1:48:16] that does have some hold aren't you glad
[1:48:19] praise be to god this morning

[1:48:30] to make him feel better and that didn't
[1:48:31] work
[1:48:33] oh can i say something this morning i
[1:48:35] don't care you get away from the hope
[1:48:36] because i don't care what you drink i
[1:48:38] don't care what you smoke it'll never
[1:48:39] bring you comfort
[1:48:41] i don't care what you do it'll never
[1:48:43] bring you comfort
[1:48:48] saul was miserable after he disobeyed
[1:48:50] the lord departed from him how many
[1:48:51] knows he departed he went anointed and
[1:48:54] he says i give your kingdom to one more
[1:48:56] better than you are one more
[1:48:58] worthy and he was miserable all the days
[1:49:01] of his life
[1:49:04] and everything he did
[1:49:06] failed
[1:49:08] till the philistines if i'm not wrong
[1:49:09] cut his head off and put it on a stake
[1:49:15] pretty bad a bad ending wasn't it
[1:49:19] samson found out what it's like
[1:49:21] to kill a thousand philosophy to be

[1:49:59] the spirit needs
[1:50:01] you'll find out that you're going to be
[1:50:02] defeated
[1:50:03] wonder why you don't have no amen or
[1:50:05] hallelujah or joy in your heart and life
[1:50:10] amen
[1:50:12] samson found out
[1:50:18] the hard way

[1:51:38] and challenging them some more here i
[1:51:40] wasn't ever laughing at me

[1:51:47] when he leaves
[1:51:48] when he's not there anymore
[1:51:51] my mama
[1:51:54] let me tell you something the one thing
[1:51:56] the prophet of god told us that hell is
[1:51:58] going to what makes hell hell
[1:52:00] is the fact there is no god there
[1:52:02] there is no hope
[1:52:05] no god he's not there
[1:52:07] amen
[1:52:09] lost
[1:52:10] completely gone
[1:52:12] that'll haunt you for however long it
[1:52:14] takes
[1:52:15] samson had plenty time to think about it
[1:52:17] didn't he
[1:52:18] but
[1:52:19] disobeying the word of god
[1:52:22] amen samson did saul did even
[1:52:25] david did
[1:52:30] amen when he sinned i'll tell you what
[1:52:33] god left he didn't bless him anymore for
[1:52:35] a good period of time
[1:52:37] things went really bad for quite a while
[1:52:41] how about the brother of god when he was
[1:52:43] first coming into ministry and he
[1:52:44] wouldn't go preach because his
[1:52:45] mother-in-law says don't you take me out
[1:52:47] amongst that trash that holy roller
[1:52:50] those crazy fools
[1:52:52] so to speak is that right
[1:52:54] that's the trash that's the office i
[1:52:56] mean he wouldn't go he had plenty time
[1:52:58] to think about not obeying god
[1:53:01] and listening to his mother-in-law
[1:53:05] when his wife was there dying
[1:53:08] and died
[1:53:10] and then he went back to sharon rose
[1:53:12] they said she's in bad rip shape
[1:53:14] went back to sharon rose and her eye
[1:53:16] flies were flying around there and
[1:53:19] eyes were across from all the pain
[1:53:22] huh
[1:53:23] her eyes had crossed
[1:53:30] i caused that daddy i caught that i did
[1:53:34] this don't punish my baby girl
[1:53:40] he was not the teacher
[1:53:42] he taught him good
[1:53:45] amen
[1:53:47] he says god just
[1:53:49] just let my baby live and a black sheep
[1:53:52] come down in front of him
[1:53:55] god shut him off
[1:53:57] this is what it's like without me
[1:53:59] it's a terrible world
[1:54:01] i mean it was a terrible world without
[1:54:04] christ look around you out there it's a
[1:54:06] terrible world without christ your world
[1:54:09] will be terribly without christ but your
[1:54:11] world will be blessed beyond measure
[1:54:14] when christ is there
[1:54:17] aren't you glad that he came to your
[1:54:19] house
[1:54:20] aren't you glad that he has an abiding
[1:54:23] place in your house
[1:54:25] you really don't have a worry in the
[1:54:27] world because he promised he would never
[1:54:29] leave yeah he'd never forsake you
[1:54:33] he never does leave us he never does or
[1:54:35] shakes us then forsake him
[1:54:40] it's us that leave him
[1:54:42] that we don't abide in him
[1:54:45] so he goes off somewhere until we're
[1:54:47] willing to take him back
[1:54:48] make things right
[1:54:55] god have mercy on people who
[1:54:58] aren't with the lord the lord is not
[1:54:59] with them
[1:55:00] you think about the church world out
[1:55:02] there god is not in that
[1:55:05] no he's not there anymore they don't
[1:55:06] even know and they keep right on going
[1:55:11] folks i don't care
[1:55:12] when i go down the wrong road when i
[1:55:14] believe jesus somewhere i hope he gets
[1:55:16] my attention if he has to throw me on my
[1:55:18] back
[1:55:19] uh if he can put me in the hospital
[1:55:22] if he's gonna take my life
[1:55:25] don't let
[1:55:27] from your lord
[1:55:28] huh
[1:55:30] because the worst thing you could ever
[1:55:31] imagine is to go on thinking you're okay
[1:55:33] when you're not
[1:55:34] and to be disappointed in the end
[1:55:37] folks you want to make sure that you're
[1:55:39] on god's side and make sure you're
[1:55:41] resting in the blessings of god
[1:55:44] because if not man i'm here to tell you
[1:55:45] things will go bad
[1:55:49] huh
[1:55:51] we can hear it amongst us
[1:55:53] we can say that's right
[1:55:55] that's right brother i've been there i
[1:55:57] know what you're talking about but i
[1:56:00] thank god that in the midst of all of
[1:56:02] that when you reach down and do like
[1:56:04] israel and repent god
[1:56:07] comes back to you
[1:56:09] and he
[1:56:11] gets to that peace again after you're
[1:56:12] done wrong
[1:56:15] when jesus comes the tempter's power is
[1:56:18] broken when jesus comes all tears are
[1:56:21] wiped away when jesus comes the dead
[1:56:24] race to life again when jesus comes to
[1:56:27] church has a hallelujah and is trying it
[1:56:29] again
[1:56:31] but it's
[1:56:32] got to be christ coming it's not just
[1:56:34] talking about something but it has to be
[1:56:36] his presence that comes down
[1:56:39] amen
[1:56:41] when jesus comes
[1:56:43] i like that don't you
[1:56:46] oh hallelujah
[1:56:47] i don't want to open door
[1:56:50] for the own devil to come in
[1:56:52] i want to keep it closed up i want to
[1:56:54] keep it sealed
[1:56:57] so that the devil can't come in
[1:56:59] praise the lord
[1:57:01] brother brahm says about the tabernacle
[1:57:03] branham tabernacle
[1:57:05] that's a whole lot of what's the matter
[1:57:08] with the brandon tabernacle because of
[1:57:10] unbelief
[1:57:11] because of the cares of the world has
[1:57:13] bound to people he would say this to his
[1:57:15] own church pretty strong huh
[1:57:18] until it cannot
[1:57:20] produce spiritual i guess that would be
[1:57:23] one of the most
[1:57:24] discouraging things to a pastor is to
[1:57:26] see that these people
[1:57:28] don't progress
[1:57:32] people just don't progress
[1:57:36] a pastor is the most forgiving
[1:57:39] the most understanding the most merciful
[1:57:43] person the most long-suffering person
[1:57:46] probably that you'll ever meet
[1:57:49] huh
[1:57:50] long we'll put up with all kinds of
[1:57:52] garbage
[1:57:53] he'll pray for you and believe for you
[1:57:55] anyway and no matter how bad you been
[1:57:58] he'll forgive you
[1:58:00] if you're willing to repent and get
[1:58:02] right and try a little more
[1:58:05] sure he is
[1:58:07] boy oh boy
[1:58:10] and god and
[1:58:11] and a pastor is thankful
[1:58:14] when he has a congregation that's a
[1:58:15] little bit that way back
[1:58:18] huh
[1:58:20] it hurts
[1:58:21] it hurts bad
[1:58:23] when there's no return of it
[1:58:26] amen
[1:58:27] when he has mistakes when he has
[1:58:28] failures
[1:58:31] there's just condemnation
[1:58:33] because folks how many believes there's
[1:58:35] plenty to go around
[1:58:37] all of us have mistakes
[1:58:39] but i learned that it was a year ago or
[1:58:41] two years ago
[1:58:43] or three years ago or one month ago
[1:58:47] i don't know what it was brother i said
[1:58:48] something about when you get older you
[1:58:49] think a little bit more about every
[1:58:50] little thing
[1:58:52] you don't want to you want to make sure
[1:58:53] that you don't grieve him away
[1:58:56] amen watch every little thing you do
[1:58:59] amen when we're younger we're a lot less
[1:59:01] careless we just are i don't know why
[1:59:04] we're a lot less less careless from what
[1:59:06] we do sometimes but as you get older you
[1:59:09] realize hey you know
[1:59:13] even coming out this morning and
[1:59:14] standing here most of the service just a
[1:59:16] little bit
[1:59:18] jittery just a little bit nervous
[1:59:20] amen
[1:59:22] i guess because of the responsibility
[1:59:24] to try to make sure you don't want to
[1:59:26] come up here and say something that
[1:59:28] would be
[1:59:28] wrong amen because you're accountable
[1:59:31] for it
[1:59:32] just want to be in tune with god
[1:59:35] make sure that everything you say and do
[1:59:37] is pleasing to him
[1:59:39] amen
[1:59:41] all right let's go on the cares of the
[1:59:42] world is bound to people until it cannot
[1:59:44] produce spiritual growth
[1:59:46] that's what's the matter with our nation
[1:59:49] that's the matter with that's what's the
[1:59:50] matter with our churches
[1:59:52] they have no joy
[1:59:54] and the joy of the lord is departed
[1:59:57] as it is written one time in the
[1:59:59] scripture in the hebrew word means
[2:00:01] ichabod
[2:00:02] which means the presence of the lord
[2:00:04] has departed amen
[2:00:07] again he says
[2:00:08] ichabod is rolled over our doors and
[2:00:11] over our nation a black checkmark has
[2:00:14] come across it
[2:00:16] amen
[2:00:18] but praise be to god
[2:00:23] let's
[2:00:24] come back up for the next 10 or so
[2:00:26] minutes is that all right
[2:00:28] how many knows that
[2:00:33] not so many hundred years ago
[2:00:36] maybe 500 years ago
[2:00:39] this world was in a bleak
[2:00:41] dark condition
[2:00:43] amen it was called the dark ages
[2:00:46] it was dark folks
[2:00:49] catholicism
[2:00:51] almost had their millennium
[2:00:54] they almost had their millennium reign
[2:00:57] for almost a thousand years
[2:00:59] huh because it wasn't but a hundred
[2:01:00] years after the death of christ if or so
[2:01:03] remember when
[2:01:04] constantine joined with the christians
[2:01:07] and so forth the roma church became the
[2:01:09] roman catholic church
[2:01:11] the roman catholic church at one time
[2:01:13] was the part of a real genuine
[2:01:14] pentecostal church that came off of
[2:01:16] pentecost
[2:01:17] but they left the word
[2:01:20] they left the word became the roman
[2:01:21] catholic church
[2:01:22] for
[2:01:24] you know and they would join church of
[2:01:26] state and right there and about a couple
[2:01:27] hundred years after death of christ
[2:01:29] hundreds of thousands of so-called
[2:01:31] christians would be killed if they
[2:01:33] didn't bow to the will of the antichrist
[2:01:36] the roman church catholic church they
[2:01:39] ruled all the way up the columba and
[2:01:41] then we had a luther and it was very
[2:01:42] dark they didn't want you to even think
[2:01:44] for yourself it was so dark
[2:01:47] but then jesus
[2:01:48] came and he got into somebody
[2:01:51] how do we know he got into luther
[2:01:54] he got into luther
[2:01:56] and he began to protest the catholic
[2:01:58] church and pinned those thesis on the
[2:02:00] door and says no we don't have to pay
[2:02:02] for this we don't have to pay for that
[2:02:03] we ain't got to worry about to pay for
[2:02:05] all these that just shall live by faith
[2:02:08] he didn't have a whole lot but he had
[2:02:10] enough to spark a whole uh reformation
[2:02:14] thousands upon thousands of people and
[2:02:16] they tried to even kill him but they had
[2:02:18] kings in different countries where they
[2:02:20] would protect him and guard him and not
[2:02:22] let him get a hold of him
[2:02:24] a lot of them before him tried it and
[2:02:26] they got killed
[2:02:27] huh they got killed for it but martin
[2:02:29] luther escaped it was the right time
[2:02:32] jesus was coming and he was coming back
[2:02:36] amen but after luther it was wesley that
[2:02:38] right wesley he began to say no it's not
[2:02:41] just justification but now it's
[2:02:44] sanctification quick smoking them soaks
[2:02:47] and drinking them beers and so forth
[2:02:49] it's time for sanctification you got it
[2:02:51] in a deeper walk
[2:02:53] they had a great time it was a revival
[2:02:55] all over the world like you ain't never
[2:02:57] seen tracks and everything going on in
[2:02:59] the world and the gospel being spread
[2:03:04] over in england
[2:03:06] is that right
[2:03:07] first germany
[2:03:09] then
[2:03:10] then the third one was
[2:03:12] landed in california
[2:03:15] huh
[2:03:16] now he knows that wherever people reject
[2:03:19] christ it gets dirty and filthy and
[2:03:22] terrible
[2:03:23] just like england they are filthy dirty
[2:03:26] and everything else
[2:03:28] it was it's just real bad long before
[2:03:30] america was
[2:03:32] because they rejected john wesley
[2:03:34] they rejected the gospel and then he
[2:03:36] landed where on azusa street we had a
[2:03:39] pentecost right
[2:03:41] we had not just sanctification now we
[2:03:43] had you know speaking in tongues and and
[2:03:45] interpretation of tongues and my just
[2:03:48] the outpouring of the holy ghost
[2:03:51] speaking in tongues and then it started
[2:03:53] a revival that went world over
[2:03:56] [Music]
[2:03:59] amen
[2:04:01] but where did they put christ out
[2:04:05] unless you believe that speaking in
[2:04:07] tongues is the initial evidence of the
[2:04:08] holy ghost and you ain't got it
[2:04:11] they were wrong
[2:04:13] it was wrong
[2:04:17] because from pentecost we went up
[2:04:18] another step
[2:04:20] we went into the prophetic age we went
[2:04:22] into the eagle age hello
[2:04:25] amen and this was not just somebody
[2:04:28] so to speak i don't want to call it
[2:04:30] rattling but to most people it would
[2:04:32] sound like rattling on in some language
[2:04:34] and then somebody interpreted
[2:04:36] and you might say well maybe that's
[2:04:37] right and maybe it's not
[2:04:40] huh
[2:04:42] maybe it's right maybe it's not
[2:04:46] and if it was prophecy saying somebody's
[2:04:48] gonna have this is gonna happen it
[2:04:49] happened yeah yeah
[2:04:51] but if you're just quoting scripture
[2:04:53] but we got something more christ became
[2:04:55] more evident more real
[2:04:59] and jesus came down in malachi 4 isn't
[2:05:01] that right
[2:05:02] he had such grace and such mercy for
[2:05:05] this world this layout is here age how
[2:05:08] many was he had mercy for germany he had
[2:05:10] mercy for england he had mercy for japan
[2:05:12] he had mercy for the buddhists
[2:05:14] muhammad's jeans
[2:05:16] all of them people over there the
[2:05:18] ishmaelites and all of those everybody
[2:05:21] he got the same sign of wonder to him
[2:05:24] is that right
[2:05:25] it was no more
[2:05:27] maybe it's right
[2:05:30] but while he was here i challenged any
[2:05:32] man anywhere to come and prove that that
[2:05:36] discernment was wrong one time not even
[2:05:39] once
[2:05:41] he could tell you what your name was who
[2:05:42] you was if he prayed for you declared
[2:05:44] you healed you'd be evil huh
[2:05:50] he it was
[2:05:51] so much of christ of
[2:05:54] brother i'm called the fullness of
[2:05:56] christ
[2:05:57] we had the fullness of christ again in
[2:05:59] this age
[2:06:01] amen to bring us to a full stature of
[2:06:04] christ the fullness of christ was
[2:06:06] nowhere
[2:06:07] not walking the shores of galilee but
[2:06:09] now the fullness of christ is in the
[2:06:11] church
[2:06:14] proving himself alive again just like he
[2:06:16] did how many times brother bam said now
[2:06:18] jesus he was then i'm here to tell you
[2:06:20] he's here now
[2:06:22] and he will do the same thing if he does
[2:06:24] the same thing
[2:06:26] god is identified by his characteristics
[2:06:28] he said 1965 another by his character
[2:06:32] but what he does is how you identify who
[2:06:34] christ is
[2:06:36] hallelujah aren't you glad when there
[2:06:38] was 900 different ways how in the world
[2:06:41] are you ever going to figure out which
[2:06:42] one's right
[2:06:44] 900 just about the time you figured out
[2:06:46] hey this one is right another one has a
[2:06:48] little of truth hey but that's right
[2:06:50] over there and you don't believe that
[2:06:53] so what am i going to do now if i go
[2:06:55] there then they believe it yeah but they
[2:06:57] don't believe some of the stuff that's
[2:06:58] true that they are
[2:07:00] and on and on and on and on
[2:07:04] that's where we were
[2:07:06] what are we going to do
[2:07:10] but he came and made a path didn't he
[2:07:12] he came and he says now if i haven't
[2:07:13] told you the truth
[2:07:15] god don't come vindicated you don't have
[2:07:16] to believe it
[2:07:18] first of all he says if i say something
[2:07:20] contrary to this here
[2:07:23] then i'm a liar i'm not false
[2:07:25] we went right back to what paul taught
[2:07:28] that's what the prophet took us back to
[2:07:30] exactly back to the original
[2:07:32] the original seed is what we have i mean
[2:07:35] believes that it produces an original
[2:07:38] church
[2:07:39] original baptism another
[2:07:42] an original new birth
[2:07:46] praise be to god
[2:07:51] amen
[2:07:53] praise be to god
[2:07:57] and what did it do when jesus came
[2:08:01] there i was
[2:08:02] minecraft sarasota
[2:08:06] confused what's what's right
[2:08:10] didn't he want to go to church
[2:08:13] it's funny though you know what's funny
[2:08:15] somebody that won't go to church
[2:08:19] they're still going to go to church what
[2:08:22] do you mean brother
[2:08:23] it's going to be their own church
[2:08:27] yeah
[2:08:29] a one-man denomination it's like they
[2:08:31] are they want to believe it the way they
[2:08:32] want to believe it
[2:08:33] you're a denomination already because
[2:08:36] it's not about going to church but there
[2:08:37] is a true church how many believe that
[2:08:38] there's a true church god is not in this
[2:08:41] or we are not in this world without
[2:08:42] there being a true church
[2:08:45] amen
[2:08:47] i wouldn't be standing here brother
[2:08:48] perish if i didn't think i was in it
[2:08:51] i believe i'm in the true church of god

[2:09:14] that's the truth
[2:09:16] you come god's way or you don't come
[2:09:19] that's one thing for sure if anybody's
[2:09:20] gonna get to heaven you're gonna have to

[2:11:19] nice and cool in here
[2:11:23] folks man i
[2:11:24] got a shower and i they thought god
[2:11:27] thank you for a shower
[2:11:29] and i looked at the wash and drawer in
[2:11:31] front of me i said thank you god for
[2:11:32] washing dry we used to have to go down
[2:11:34] they used to have to go down uh you know
[2:11:36] back in on independence they probably
[2:11:38] going to do it on the scrub board
[2:11:40] they they couldn't go inside their
[2:11:42] shower just turn that knob on
[2:11:44] although they couldn't go over to a
[2:11:45] commode and just flush
[2:11:47] pray speech to god then go to the
[2:11:49] kitchen and have a kitchen sink with
[2:11:51] water oh praise the lord
[2:11:54] don't have to have an ice box or wonder
[2:11:55] how you're going to keep things you got
[2:11:56] to pray thank you jesus
[2:11:59] i'm thankful for all that god has given
[2:12:01] us we have god it's so nice and then you
[2:12:04] know even the dishwashers and everything
[2:12:06] and then we're still
[2:12:10] yeah
[2:12:11] come on forks
[2:12:15] you know what it is
[2:12:17] the problem is it is a lack of correct
[2:12:19] raising
[2:12:22] people
[2:12:23] don't teach their kids to be
[2:12:24] conservative and not waste and take good
[2:12:26] care of what they have
[2:12:28] amen how many know how many has learned
[2:12:30] a lot of us has learned that brother
[2:12:32] irvin is sometimes better to fix
[2:12:33] something than just to buy something new
[2:12:36] people can't fix one little bitty thing
[2:12:38] and have to spend 1500 for something new
[2:12:43] well
[2:12:44] i believe it's the same with our
[2:12:46] generation of people who don't
[2:12:47] appreciate the price that we paid for
[2:12:50] our freedom
[2:12:51] the price that was paid for our freedom
[2:12:53] and they are squandering it and wasting
[2:12:55] it
[2:12:56] i mean it's like a
[2:12:58] person being rich and having a child
[2:13:00] that
[2:13:01] is not worthy of
[2:13:03] that it's just such wasteful spender and
[2:13:05] you can't hardly you can't hardly give
[2:13:07] that person everything you have ever
[2:13:08] worked for because you know they're just
[2:13:10] gonna waste it
[2:13:12] just
[2:13:13] squander it that's what our generation
[2:13:15] is doing we pay dearly with our blood
[2:13:18] for our freedoms and they're just
[2:13:19] squandering it
[2:13:21] being waste they're not worthy of it
[2:13:23] amen
[2:13:25] and
[2:13:27] in any way
[2:13:29] i thank god for
[2:13:30] the benefits of what christ died for me
[2:13:32] for i don't want to squander that amen
[2:13:38] i don't know if i read this or not
[2:13:41] in matthew i believe it was
[2:13:46] and i'll just read the scripture and say
[2:13:47] a few words did i be okay and then we'll
[2:13:49] get into communion
[2:13:52] amen
[2:13:53] yeah i believe it's found in
[2:13:56] let me see where i've got this wrote
[2:13:57] down matthew 9
[2:13:59] matthew 9
[2:14:02] and verse 18 and when he spake thee
[2:14:04] things unto them behold there came a
[2:14:06] certain ruler in worship saying my
[2:14:08] daughter
[2:14:09] is even now dead but come and lay the
[2:14:13] hand upon her and she shall live
[2:14:16] can somebody say this man had faith
[2:14:20] he believed
[2:14:22] i don't know if you heard about lazarus
[2:14:23] at this time yet or not perhaps you
[2:14:25] hadn't learned about him raising
[2:14:26] laughter he said my daughter's dead but
[2:14:28] i know that if you lay your hands on her
[2:14:30] she'll raise
[2:14:32] and jesus arose verse 19
[2:14:35] and followed him and said and so did his
[2:14:37] disciples and behold a woman which was
[2:14:39] diseased with an issue of blood 12 years
[2:14:42] came behind him and touched the hem of
[2:14:43] his garment
[2:14:44] and she said within herself if i make
[2:14:47] but touch the hem of his garment i shall
[2:14:49] be made whole
[2:14:50] and jesus turned about
[2:14:53] and so when he saw her said daughter be
[2:14:55] of good courage comfort thy faith has
[2:14:58] said may be whole and the woman was made
[2:15:00] whole from that hour another place
[2:15:03] another scripture says he
[2:15:05] had virtue to go from amen
[2:15:08] and
[2:15:09] when
[2:15:11] jesus came
[2:15:12] amen when jesus
[2:15:15] comes
[2:15:18] into the ruler's house
[2:15:20] and saw the minstrels of the and the
[2:15:22] people making a noise he said unto them
[2:15:26] give place
[2:15:27] for the maid is not dead but sleepeth
[2:15:30] and they laughed him
[2:15:32] to scorn
[2:15:34] when i read that i just try to imagine
[2:15:36] the sound of it
[2:15:38] because you know
[2:15:40] laughing's one one thing but to scorn it
[2:15:43] sounds like it's just a little on the
[2:15:44] heavy side
[2:15:46] just really laughing
[2:15:50] how much different their faith was
[2:15:52] than the dad
[2:15:54] the dad said if you come and touch it
[2:15:55] she'll be made
[2:15:56] he says she's just sleeping
[2:16:00] they should all said oh okay okay

[2:16:05] believe with you that she's just
[2:16:06] sleeping go wake her up we want to see
[2:16:08] her raise up
[2:16:10] but to laugh him to scorn with doubt
[2:16:15] and he put the people forth
[2:16:17] amen how many know sometimes you just
[2:16:19] got to get away from unbelief
[2:16:21] and he went in and he took her by the
[2:16:23] hand and the maid rose and the fame
[2:16:25] thereof
[2:16:26] here of went abroad in all of the
[2:16:30] land

[2:17:50] demons have to flee when he comes lives
[2:17:52] are changed
[2:17:54] when he came for me folks i've never
[2:17:57] been the same
[2:17:59] i think
[2:18:01] about the past
[2:18:05] the past the god of the past
[2:18:07] of my past
[2:18:08] when he came to me some 30 years ago

[2:18:15] and i've never been the same
[2:18:18] praise the lord
[2:18:20] about mary and martha he had left but he
[2:18:23] came back
[2:18:24] when he came back
[2:18:26] lazarus was four days dead and he seemed
[2:18:29] a little late
[2:18:31] can i say something
[2:18:33] usually when jesus comes it's a little
[2:18:36] late brother bam said he called the
[2:18:39] darkest hour then jesus comes he lets it
[2:18:43] get real
[2:18:45] dark
[2:18:51] i want that to soak in so i'm being
[2:18:53] quiet the darkest hour most of the time
[2:18:55] then jesus comes
[2:18:58] jesus never showed up for the three
[2:19:00] hebrew children
[2:19:02] until they begin to come into the
[2:19:04] atmosphere of the heat
[2:19:08] and just as they came into the
[2:19:09] atmosphere that he there he was
[2:19:12] right on time they didn't get their hair
[2:19:14] since first
[2:19:15] now he protected them all the way that
[2:19:17] right
[2:19:18] but they tried him and tested him all
[2:19:20] the way to the heat
[2:19:22] just the looks of the fire and the
[2:19:24] threat of their life and the feeling of
[2:19:26] being extinguished and killed and so
[2:19:28] forth you know they had to get past all
[2:19:30] of that go all the way to the heat
[2:19:33] i'll take you all the way to the heat
[2:19:36] to see what you'll do
[2:19:37] and see if you'll keep on believing the
[2:19:39] same way with daniel
[2:19:40] didn't stop at the wall
[2:19:42] no he went in
[2:19:46] gotta let you go in your trial
[2:19:49] amen
[2:19:54] some of us brother brad better joe
[2:19:56] different ones of us we think about how
[2:19:58] that god has given us a second
[2:20:00] chance we know what that dark hour is we
[2:20:03] know what it was like to be at the
[2:20:05] bottom of the bottom and it can't get
[2:20:07] any worse
[2:20:10] or it doesn't seem like it can but guess
[2:20:11] what if you're a child of god and you
[2:20:14] put your trust in him look out because
[2:20:16] here jesus comes
[2:20:20] let me tell you something a lot of y'all

[2:21:00] christian
[2:21:02] our money is with us our younger
[2:21:03] generation our children that are coming
[2:21:05] up they need the protection of the holy
[2:21:07] spirit they need jesus to come in their
[2:21:09] lives and make a difference that'll be a
[2:21:11] difference for a lifetime
