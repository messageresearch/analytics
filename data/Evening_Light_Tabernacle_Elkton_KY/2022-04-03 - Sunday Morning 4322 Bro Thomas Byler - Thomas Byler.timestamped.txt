[12:36] morning everyone um
[13:14] is
[13:23] pointing out
[13:43] uh
[13:53] you're just only people who can hear
[14:04] my mouth shall speak of wisdom
[14:08] meditation of my heart
[14:27] uh
[14:35] none of them can by any means
[14:38] but they're going to give
[14:39] god
[14:48] that he should
[14:49] still live forever and not see
[14:51] corruption
[15:04] [Applause]
[15:08] [Music]
[15:11] they call their land
[15:12] after their own name
[15:23] this is their ways they're falling
[15:29] they're saying
[15:45] but god will redeem my soul from the
[15:48] power of the grave forth he shall
[15:50] receive
[15:59] foreign
[16:13] you shall go to this generation of his
[16:15] fathers they shall never see life
[16:19] together
[16:25] [Music]
[16:27] from
[16:48] you know whatever
[16:52] [Music]
[16:53] isaiah
[17:16] the principle of um church
[17:19] uh
[17:20] after i make the payments this coming
[17:22] week will be done for about 75 thousand
[17:25] dollars
[17:26] and we're at that point
[17:28] when you if you've been paid off and
[17:30] longer early
[18:41] don't be afraid to ask me
[18:46] listen to what brother thomas had to say
[18:48] wednesday
[18:49] and i was just as i was reading the song
[18:52] this morning
[19:08] you know
[19:36] that is foreign
[19:45] but then isaiah talks about as it goes
[19:48] further on this
[19:49] you know there's always a positive and
[20:56] it's not a nice place
[20:59] you can't believe anything you hear
[21:29] ii devotional this morning and i was
[21:31] thinking
[21:32] uh
[21:33] not to be funny here
[21:36] you know some sometimes
[21:39] this is what this man had to say and
[21:40] this is for april 3rd
[21:43] you know these were men in world war ii
[21:45] they were about to go into conflict and
[21:47] this is their devotional
[21:49] for this day out of that little book i
[21:51] had
[21:53] and the scripture that was what this
[21:54] morning goes to what brother thomas was
[21:57] talking about on the wednesday and the
[21:59] scriptures
[22:00] second timothy
[22:01] first chapter the seventh verse and it
[22:03] says
[22:04] for god has not given us a spirit of
[22:06] fear but a power and a blood and mind
[22:10] and that last portion of that scripture
[22:13] and if you have the gospel of the hour
[22:15] and your heart and mind this morning you
[22:18] have jesus christ abiding in your life
[22:20] within your heart
[22:21] you can be grateful that you do have a
[22:23] sound mind
[22:32] [Music]
[22:38] is
[22:48] some of you know this historically some
[22:50] of you might not
[22:51] like to offer his power so
[22:53] congratulations basically thank god
[22:55] involved in the spiritual power through
[22:57] the word of god
[22:59] jesus christ
[23:01] he talked about this man given my
[23:02] pronunciation
[23:04] dr john valley of pembroke
[23:28] maybe
[23:29] it would have taken a lot longer
[23:31] for home and victory if they lost that
[23:34] armor but he goes on forgotten
[23:36] providence
[23:38] you're bringing almost 400 000 men
[23:41] across the channel but it goes great
[23:43] then took their little crash
[23:45] risking everything helping brothers off
[23:47] the safety entertainment
[24:03] and
[24:04] made her way southward in france and he
[24:07] felt that meeting our friend soldiers
[24:09] were so grateful for fear that he was no
[24:11] longer a man
[24:13] and that's pretty
[24:14] pretty brutal thing when someone so
[24:16] fearful
[24:31] to be abandoned and
[24:32] fear has destroyed his ability and
[24:35] thinking of the day that we live in you
[24:37] know a fearful day but for christians
[24:39] you know you can become so fearful
[24:42] in life with everything that's going on
[24:44] around you
[24:56] there's a story of a man in the early
[24:58] church and this goes to what i was
[24:59] thinking this morning there is a story
[25:01] of a man in the early church which you
[25:04] never see tomorrow and you remember him
[25:07] and we all as soon as i mentioned this
[25:09] thing you'll know the story
[25:10] and peter was his name and he seemed to
[25:26] he wouldn't
[25:55] after the free time show
[25:57] and goes on a short time later however
[25:59] we see the same man
[26:01] as the leader of the liberal league of
[26:03] christians in jerusalem
[26:05] not exceeding any of us could be this
[26:08] morning if you weren't successful or you
[26:10] made mistakes ten years ago five years
[26:13] ago two weeks ago
[26:15] you can still change god's
[26:17] channel and go to a short time later
[26:20] however we see this man as the leader
[26:32] [Applause]
[26:36] and give us the power of god all powers
[26:38] said jesus give it up to me
[26:41] in heaven and on earth
[26:43] go to there before and make disciples to
[26:45] behold i set a promise of my father upon
[26:48] me
[26:49] but terribly in the city
[26:59] but you don't move any further than god
[27:01] gives you the experience for when you
[27:04] start
[27:05] getting ahead of god or getting ahead of
[27:06] what the lord wants you to do that's
[27:09] what you start out in trouble and so you
[27:11] know i promise my father unto you
[27:14] in the city
[27:15] of jesus christ
[27:18] but you shall receive the power after
[27:20] the holy ghost will come upon you
[27:23] and you should be with
[27:25] the most important thing i can say this
[27:27] morning without that holy ghost power in
[27:29] your heart this morning
[27:31] everything we do
[27:33] i'm not saying it's not good it isn't
[27:35] fruitful but without god leading you and
[27:38] god being inside you you're not going to
[27:40] be successful today you know when i look
[27:42] at the world the way it is this morning
[27:46] it's pretty rude right everyone here
[27:48] does that
[27:50] your friends when you journey people
[27:52] making the thoughts that you can trust
[27:54] more
[27:55] you're greater than you find out there's
[27:56] no portrayal but you know the only thing
[27:59] that matters is jesus
[28:28] foreign
[28:53] [Music]
[28:55] [Applause]
[29:05] this morning where everything that we do
[29:08] that doesn't mean that you don't need to
[29:10] work anymore

[29:32] he's an awesome god this morning
[29:35] and we just

[51:05] amen
[51:07] he's definitely been faithful to us
[51:09] hadn't he
[51:10] oh my
[51:12] amen
[51:16] you know
[51:17] he's never failed me
[51:20] but i failed him many times
[51:23] but he still keeps on loving me
[51:27] and he steve keeps on telling me
[51:29] that i'm his child
[51:33] you know
[51:36] i always said if
[51:39] my dad had raised me in this day and
[51:41] time he would
[51:42] been
[51:43] locked up in jail because
[51:46] very hard-headed young individual and
[51:49] sometimes the old saying goes he just
[51:51] had to beat the far out of me
[51:54] but you know
[51:56] i told someone i said you know i never
[51:58] did feel like that my dad didn't love me
[52:01] and that my mom didn't love me you know
[52:04] the lord jesus has gave me some pretty
[52:05] good spankings
[52:07] but you know what i still
[52:09] loves me
[52:10] and i'm so glad this morning to say that
[52:12] i'm a child of the king this morning
[52:15] amen
[52:17] there's a lot of people as brother brian
[52:18] said this morning we look at the world
[52:20] and how it is but we can be at peace
[52:22] this morning
[52:25] that ought to just make every one of us
[52:27] shout you know we live in this so
[52:29] chaotic
[52:31] but we have peace this morning
[52:33] no worries
[52:36] you say i have luck no you don't
[52:38] there's a gospel song out if you've got
[52:40] time to worry you've got time to pray
[52:43] and i believe we need to take it to the
[52:45] lord in prayer
[52:46] give it to him you say you're still
[52:48] going to worry yeah
[52:49] sometimes we do
[52:52] but help us
[52:54] it's all in his hands brother josh is
[52:55] going to sing for us this morning come
[52:57] ahead brother josh
[53:01] god bless you buddy
[53:13] [Music]
[53:20] it's not hard to believe
[53:25] standing on the mountaintop
[53:29] in glory
[53:34] when you can hear the songs of angels
[53:38] and the breeze
[53:40] heaven sent your spirits
[53:48] but in the valley once more
[53:52] will jesus still be lord that's the
[53:56] question
[53:56] [Music]
[54:02] because believing
[54:05] leaving isn't easy
[54:09] that is the testing
[54:12] [Music]
[54:14] and i need faith for the time
[54:19] when the sun does not shine
[54:22] and the mountaintop is just a memory
[54:27] [Music]
[54:29] there's no sign to be seen
[54:33] i don't feel a thing
[54:36] to the word of god alone
[54:39] i can clean
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] and i need strength for the day
[54:45] when troubles come my way
[54:48] and i just don't
[54:50] understand
[54:52] what it means
[54:55] that's when nothing else will do
[54:58] faith alone will see me through
[55:01] and believing becomes
[55:04] [Music]
[55:09] it's not hard to believe
[55:13] when things are going well when skies
[55:17] are sunny
[55:19] [Music]
[55:22] when you feel you're making progress
[55:26] doing good
[55:27] living in a time of plenty
[55:35] oh but if all of that should change
[55:39] would you still keep the faith that's
[55:42] the question
[55:45] [Music]
[55:48] because believing when believing isn't
[55:52] easy
[55:54] that is the testing
[55:58] oh
[55:59] and i
[56:00] need faith for the time
[56:04] when the sun does not shine
[56:06] and the mountaintop is just a memory
[56:12] when there's no sign to be
[56:25] and i need strength for the day
[56:28] the troubles come my way
[56:31] and the mountaintop is just a memory
[56:37] and that's what nothing else will do
[56:41] faith alone will see me through
[56:46] [Applause]
[56:46] [Music]
[56:56] when the sun does not shine
[56:59] and the mountaintop is just a memory
[57:04] when there's no sign to be seen
[57:08] i don't
[57:10] feel a
[57:14] [Music]
[57:20] my troubles come my way
[57:23] and i just don't understand
[57:26] what it means
[57:29] and that's when nothing else will do
[57:32] faith alone will see me through
[57:36] and believing becomes my
[57:39] [Music]
[57:49] [Applause]

[1:02:14] us and we don't know just who the
[1:02:16] following wednesday we might

[1:02:20] amen that's how we like
[1:02:22] just pray god will bless you while we're
[1:02:25] gone amen pray for us that
[1:02:27] amen my wife she's uh that'll be all for
[1:02:31] the music
[1:02:33] uh my wife she we had originally planned
[1:02:35] to go with mike and grace
[1:02:37] uh and go down the miako river i don't
[1:02:39] know if you all know where that is
[1:02:41] to through the deep hole all right and
[1:02:44] and so my wife she looked up
[1:02:46] what deep hole was and it had so many
[1:02:49] gators they were laying on top of each
[1:02:51] other and she doesn't like gators so she
[1:02:54] was really nervous the last week or so
[1:02:57] about knowing and oh my this is not much
[1:03:00] of a vacation for her you know because
[1:03:02] you don't like going around them gators
[1:03:04] but it was really i mean they have
[1:03:06] hundreds of gators in that hole which we
[1:03:08] try to bypass but anyway so
[1:03:11] that didn't work out the river is really
[1:03:13] really low amen and we probably have to
[1:03:15] drag our canoes or boats around like
[1:03:17] that so mike and grace you're not going
[1:03:19] to go at this time i guess
[1:03:21] uh but anyway so because of that low
[1:03:24] reload river because we was planning a
[1:03:26] three-day
[1:03:27] trip down there and and and have spent
[1:03:29] about two or three nights on the river
[1:03:32] but as it works out amen we've got a
[1:03:34] place that we can stay now and it's
[1:03:35] going to be at a house way out on five
[1:03:37] acres and it's gonna be real nice and so
[1:03:39] we're just gonna go and and fish you
[1:03:41] know here and there and relax and take
[1:03:44] it easy and we'll try to make sure that
[1:03:46] donna gets a good vacation for a change
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] he may not take all my time our time
[1:03:51] fishing but anyway
[1:03:52] we'll do quite a bit of it if we can
[1:03:54] help it man
[1:03:55] but anyway so that's the plan amen and
[1:03:58] so
[1:04:00] lord willing how many knows how you
[1:04:01] always pray
[1:04:03] a bunch about whatever you do because
[1:04:05] you always want god in
[1:04:07] and watch have him watch over you
[1:04:10] amen so that
[1:04:12] i mean you have to trade safe journey
[1:04:15] amen we was praying like today
[1:04:18] amen and i know we want to take the
[1:04:20] lord's supper communion so forth this
[1:04:23] morning and i thought well lord today be
[1:04:25] nice to have maybe something courage and
[1:04:27] about communion and
[1:04:29] then it just began to open up and i can
[1:04:31] always tell when the lord kind of opens
[1:04:33] up a thought for me and
[1:04:34] a message and you know and so
[1:04:37] we want to with the help of the lord
[1:04:39] this morning to speak something that is
[1:04:41] centered around
[1:04:43] communion amen because i got to thinking
[1:04:45] of how
[1:04:46] what communion is what really communion
[1:04:49] is
[1:04:50] and it's actually communing with the
[1:04:52] lord amen
[1:04:54] and when you're communing with the lord
[1:04:56] or each other or whatever it might be
[1:04:59] it has to do with fellowship in the
[1:05:00] right you're fellowshipping when you're
[1:05:02] communing amen
[1:05:03] and so and we want to talk about
[1:05:06] fellowship with the help of the lord
[1:05:07] this morning stand with me we'll just
[1:05:09] get into the word of god this morning
[1:05:11] bow our heads
[1:05:13] kind heavenly father lord we want to put
[1:05:16] you before us always in everything lord
[1:05:18] and ask for your guidance and for your
[1:05:22] ability lord that you give lord for your
[1:05:24] presence lord jesus and for your divine
[1:05:26] will
[1:05:27] god in the message this morning that we
[1:05:30] feel lord you've laid upon our heart
[1:05:32] minister and then the communion lord
[1:05:34] that you've asked us to do father we ask
[1:05:36] lord jesus that you just be in the
[1:05:38] service and also in the communion
[1:05:40] service this morning as we remember what
[1:05:42] you did for us
[1:05:43] and lord just help us lord this morning
[1:05:45] to get out of the way and speak to our
[1:05:46] hearts and our lives draw us closer to
[1:05:49] you lord jesus and help us and cause us
[1:05:52] lord to have fellowship with you and
[1:05:54] with one another for we ask these
[1:05:55] blessings in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:58] amen and amen turn your bibles will to
[1:06:01] the first book of the
[1:06:04] the first book of john
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:08] first epistle of john
[1:06:10] john 1
[1:06:13] and we want to read
[1:06:15] 1 down through 7.
[1:06:30] we want to perhaps this will give us a
[1:06:32] little better understanding of communion
[1:06:36] that which was from the beginning
[1:06:39] which we have heard which we have seen
[1:06:41] with our eyes
[1:06:43] which we have looked upon and our hands
[1:06:46] have handled
[1:06:48] of the word of life
[1:06:50] everybody in this book of first john i
[1:06:52] guess
[1:06:53] if you'll notice this first verse
[1:06:56] makes it very personal doesn't it
[1:06:59] amen their eyes have seen their hands
[1:07:02] have handled and so forth
[1:07:05] that they have been with the word of
[1:07:07] life for the life was manifested
[1:07:10] and we have seen it and bear witness to
[1:07:13] show unto you that eternal life
[1:07:15] which was with the father and was
[1:07:18] manifested unto us
[1:07:20] that's which we have seen in her declare
[1:07:22] we unto you that ye
[1:07:25] also
[1:07:26] may have fellowship
[1:07:29] with us amen
[1:07:31] how many believes that birds of a
[1:07:32] feather flock together amen
[1:07:35] fellowship is about birds of a feather
[1:07:38] having fellowship amen together and
[1:07:41] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:07:44] and with his son jesus christ how many
[1:07:47] is glad to have fellowship this morning
[1:07:50] with jesus christ amen
[1:07:53] and these things right we unto you that
[1:07:55] your joy may be full and this is the
[1:07:58] message which we have heard of him and
[1:08:00] declare unto you that god is light
[1:08:03] and in him is no darkness at all
[1:08:08] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:08:10] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[1:08:13] not the truth
[1:08:15] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:08:17] the light then we have fellowship one
[1:08:20] with another and the blood of jesus
[1:08:22] christ his son cleanses us from all
[1:08:26] sin may god add his blessings to the
[1:08:28] reading of the word
[1:08:29] this morning you can be seated
[1:08:32] now notice i like that he says listen he
[1:08:35] says our fellowship is with the father
[1:08:38] it's with his son jesus christ and then
[1:08:41] also it says that if we are in the
[1:08:43] lightest walk in the lightest year then
[1:08:45] we have fellowship one with another
[1:08:49] i believe brother benham said that
[1:08:50] brother bosworth that he i talked to him
[1:08:53] he says and brother bosworth asked him
[1:08:55] he says what is fellowship and he says
[1:08:57] you know fellowship is two fellows
[1:09:00] in one ship
[1:09:02] amen two fellows in one ship and i got
[1:09:05] to thinking about that because
[1:09:07] you know just because you're in the
[1:09:08] shape one thing that it means if you're
[1:09:10] in the same ship
[1:09:12] it also means that you're going to the
[1:09:15] same place
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:17] you're going the same direction
[1:09:22] the bible says how can two walk together
[1:09:24] unless they be
[1:09:28] agreed
[1:09:30] and then how many knows that's the whole
[1:09:32] idea of fellowship is agreement
[1:09:36] because you if you don't agree with
[1:09:38] somebody you don't have very good
[1:09:40] fellowship
[1:09:42] huh husbands and wives right
[1:09:45] get in the argument it's called argument
[1:09:47] you disagree
[1:09:49] you know you don't it's just not the
[1:09:50] most pleasant thing there is
[1:09:53] amen and so it's about agreement and
[1:09:55] even depaul talked about what agreement
[1:09:58] has uh be bial or bail
[1:10:01] with christ you know they don't agree
[1:10:04] with each other light and darkness don't
[1:10:06] agree there's a whole lot of
[1:10:07] disagreement going on
[1:10:10] amen how many beliefs and i believe that
[1:10:11] it brings in unity it brings in
[1:10:14] oneness amen
[1:10:18] and we are to have fellowship oh i like
[1:10:20] this and let me just say this i truly
[1:10:23] believe and i said it before i want to
[1:10:24] say it again that you know unless a
[1:10:26] person is truly born again unless two
[1:10:30] people are filled with the holy ghost
[1:10:32] they really don't have a lot in common
[1:10:38] all right now listen let me just read
[1:10:40] you read you a quote from the prophet
[1:10:42] when he said on communion remembering
[1:10:43] the lord he says sometimes we place now
[1:10:46] we come to the lord's table okay
[1:10:49] talking about this dolores table here to
[1:10:51] take communion showing that we have
[1:10:53] fellowship with christ because remember
[1:10:55] if jesus said that if you if i watched
[1:10:57] thou has no part with me
[1:11:00] i mean it's important to be able to take
[1:11:02] uh communion it really is
[1:11:04] no part with me you know and so he says
[1:11:07] we come to the lord's table we've
[1:11:09] explained it before
[1:11:11] how that we call it communion the taking
[1:11:13] of the bread sometimes we place it on
[1:11:15] the wrong thing we place the right thing
[1:11:17] in the wrong place it isn't so much the
[1:11:19] bread that matters or the wine that
[1:11:22] matters or the kosher and so forth
[1:11:24] that's what it is but the main thing is
[1:11:26] is the communion
[1:11:29] it means to talk to talking to him
[1:11:32] remembering him
[1:11:34] i think it's the most blessed time of
[1:11:36] services
[1:11:37] see every hour of our life ought to be a
[1:11:42] communion
[1:11:44] how many knows you're not to take of it
[1:11:46] if you're not worthy if you don't aren't
[1:11:48] in fellowship with christ
[1:11:51] then you take damnation to yourself
[1:11:54] because you're saying you have communion
[1:11:56] in which with him you have fellowship
[1:11:58] with him you are part of him and you
[1:12:00] aren't really
[1:12:02] and then god has to correct you for that
[1:12:05] he has to judge you for that he has to
[1:12:07] bring judgment that's why he said when
[1:12:09] the lord judges us chasing us
[1:12:12] huh
[1:12:13] if you're not right
[1:12:16] amen so it's important then again the
[1:12:19] next quote he says the communion with
[1:12:21] the lord is like an oasis
[1:12:23] in the desert
[1:12:27] praise the lord we could stop here and
[1:12:28] preach for a while
[1:12:31] you know to talk with the lord to have
[1:12:33] fellowship to have a prayer prepare me
[1:12:35] how many knows that's most of the time
[1:12:37] when you have fellowship with it when
[1:12:39] you're praying
[1:12:40] even paul said praying always in the
[1:12:42] spirit when you're driving down the road
[1:12:44] talk with him fellowship with god loves
[1:12:49] communication
[1:12:51] god loves for you to talk to him we
[1:12:53] don't do enough of it
[1:12:57] i got all my prayer bones i believe it
[1:12:59] was yesterday evening and yesterday and
[1:13:01] this morning god i'm coming before you
[1:13:03] again but you know i just don't do this
[1:13:05] enough lord help me to do it more
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] pray without ceasing about fellowship
[1:13:13] without ceasing have communion god
[1:13:16] dwelled all by himself for eons of time
[1:13:21] before the first angel was made before
[1:13:24] the first
[1:13:25] stardust was made but he didn't want to
[1:13:28] be alone he wanted can we say fellowship
[1:13:35] amen
[1:13:37] we'd be a lot better off
[1:13:40] just like shadrach mesha their prayer
[1:13:42] was daniel was a prayer warrior he was
[1:13:45] in a ace he had a he went to his oasis
[1:13:48] three times a day
[1:13:50] to get away from the cares of life the
[1:13:52] work the business just oh if we just
[1:13:55] take time out of our schedule to have a
[1:13:57] little bit of a siesta with him a little
[1:14:00] little oasis
[1:14:02] a little rest with him just to take it
[1:14:04] aside
[1:14:06] the fellowship with him we'd be stronger
[1:14:10] christians i'd be a better preacher than
[1:14:12] what i am i'd be a better christian than
[1:14:13] what i am i'd be a better husband than i
[1:14:15] am i'd be a better grandparent than what
[1:14:17] i am
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:24] what is it that you can't do too much
[1:14:27] pray
[1:14:28] fellowship talk commune something you
[1:14:31] can't never do it or you can sing too
[1:14:33] much you can pray to preach too much
[1:14:36] so you can't preach no more he might go
[1:14:37] horse might go horse and not be able to
[1:14:39] preach anymore
[1:14:40] but you can't talk to the lord too much
[1:14:45] aren't you glad that he is
[1:14:48] within
[1:14:50] hearing distance
[1:14:55] because of his shed blood on calvary
[1:14:58] now he can hear you
[1:15:01] is that right
[1:15:02] he can hear you you can have fellowship
[1:15:04] you couldn't have it before then
[1:15:09] one place i believe the bible says is as
[1:15:10] long as often you take this or as often
[1:15:12] as you meet do this in remembrance of me
[1:15:16] what are we supposed to remember we're
[1:15:17] supposed to remember calvary
[1:15:19] we're supposed to remember what made our
[1:15:22] fellowship with him possible
[1:15:25] this is my blood which
[1:15:27] you know is filled for you this is my
[1:15:29] body which is broken for you
[1:15:31] so that you can have fellowship with me
[1:15:33] again
[1:15:35] daniel had such a relationship with him
[1:15:39] huh
[1:15:40] until he didn't fear
[1:15:42] going into the lions then
[1:15:44] three hebrew children had such
[1:15:46] fellowship with god until they didn't
[1:15:47] mind getting burnt if that's what it
[1:15:49] takes
[1:15:50] huh but they had a walk with god
[1:15:55] lord help us in our walk with him
[1:15:57] our fellowship with him
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:05] it's like an oasis in the desert it's
[1:16:07] like a spring like the traveler coming
[1:16:10] by can stop and he drinks
[1:16:13] the water till he quenches his thirst
[1:16:16] that's
[1:16:17] remembering the lord coming by the order
[1:16:20] of the table where the passing pilgrim
[1:16:22] that's so journeying here on earth with
[1:16:25] us together that we can come by this
[1:16:28] table
[1:16:29] and there drink of his blessings and of
[1:16:31] his grace
[1:16:33] and of his word in fellowship around his
[1:16:36] word
[1:16:37] amen
[1:16:38] how many know that's what you do every
[1:16:40] time that we come to church
[1:16:43] we come to the table of god to feast
[1:16:47] together to fellowship around the word
[1:16:49] of god
[1:16:53] we don't come to talk about what
[1:16:55] terrible things happened to you
[1:16:56] yesterday and the day before we don't

[1:17:00] do your business better and how you can
[1:17:02] make money and just that or the other or
[1:17:04] you know how bad it's really going or
[1:17:06] whether i think prices are up or whether

[1:17:10] fellowship around that stuff
[1:17:14] we're here to fellowship around

[1:19:09] refreshing ourselves
[1:19:12] in his presence now
[1:19:14] how many knows if you're going to
[1:19:16] talk to somebody
[1:19:18] you got to have something to talk about
[1:19:22] what you're going to talk about
[1:19:26] what are you going to think about
[1:19:32] well
[1:19:33] this group here think about it birds of
[1:19:35] a feather flock together
[1:19:37] there's a lot of people doing a lot of
[1:19:39] different things there's a lot of people
[1:19:41] with a lot of different interests
[1:19:43] this morning
[1:19:44] and they're out there with the group
[1:19:46] that they like to hang with
[1:19:48] that they like to be with
[1:19:50] doing the things that they like to do
[1:19:52] talking about the things that they would
[1:19:53] like to
[1:19:54] hear
[1:19:56] but what brings us together is this word
[1:19:59] it's the word of god
[1:20:02] amen and let's talk about first of all
[1:20:05] you have to be
[1:20:07] in agreement with somebody before you
[1:20:09] can really talk about anything
[1:20:12] you take a big group
[1:20:14] you take a church somewhere
[1:20:16] all right or let's just say you have a
[1:20:19] convention somewhere where many churches
[1:20:21] come together
[1:20:22] those people every person with a certain
[1:20:25] spirit
[1:20:26] they will find another person with that
[1:20:28] same spirit
[1:20:31] they call to each other
[1:20:32] they're drawn to each other
[1:20:34] huh
[1:20:36] it's just something about it they it
[1:20:38] just somehow they make their way
[1:20:40] together
[1:20:41] remember what the prophet says he says
[1:20:43] you know even the young the middle age
[1:20:46] and the older people a lot of times they
[1:20:48] hang out together
[1:20:49] he says when you see a little child
[1:20:52] hanging with grandma
[1:20:54] right what do you say
[1:20:56] well they don't really have a lot to
[1:20:58] fellowship about
[1:21:01] no he says usually she's got a bag of
[1:21:03] candy or something
[1:21:06] and that's why the little kids over
[1:21:07] there get a little piece of gum i get a
[1:21:09] little candy you know
[1:21:10] why because grandma's mind is so far
[1:21:12] beyond the child's right because the
[1:21:15] first time she gets her candy who does
[1:21:16] she run back to who does he run back to
[1:21:19] their little friends of their own age
[1:21:22] and they have things in common
[1:21:24] i mean he believes that's how it is they
[1:21:25] have things in common
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] i want you to know that god wants us to
[1:21:32] have things in common
[1:21:35] god wants us to be
[1:21:37] unified
[1:21:39] how many
[1:21:40] believes that
[1:21:43] he wants us
[1:21:45] to be able to fellowship one with
[1:21:47] another
[1:21:49] let me just say this
[1:21:51] a
[1:21:51] real genuine believer really doesn't
[1:21:54] have fellowship with a make-believer
[1:21:57] or a unbeliever
[1:21:59] believers hang with believers make
[1:22:01] believers have a tendency to hang with
[1:22:03] make believers
[1:22:04] unbelievers hang with unbelievers
[1:22:07] not right
[1:22:09] that's why he says if we come under the
[1:22:11] blood of jesus christ you will have
[1:22:14] fellowship one with another you can't
[1:22:16] help it why because you have the same
[1:22:18] interests
[1:22:19] you think the same
[1:22:21] i mean that's one thing that gives us
[1:22:24] fellowship with one another is the
[1:22:27] fact that when we come to christ this is
[1:22:29] something that we should all be able to
[1:22:30] agree on that when we come to christ you
[1:22:33] died to your own thinking
[1:22:36] you die to your own ways you die to
[1:22:39] yourself because jesus said unless you
[1:22:41] crucify even yourself and die to
[1:22:43] yourself you're not worthy of me
[1:22:46] and then we begin to think like christ
[1:22:48] thinks
[1:22:49] am i right
[1:22:51] each and every one of us
[1:22:54] and then we have fellowship one with
[1:22:55] another
[1:22:56] you know paul he really loved
[1:22:59] for us to have fellowship he loved for
[1:23:01] us to have fellowship one with another
[1:23:03] and to think the way that we're supposed
[1:23:05] to think
[1:23:06] if there being if this is in philippians
[1:23:09] the second chapter if there be any
[1:23:10] consolation in christ if any comfort of
[1:23:13] love
[1:23:16] let this just i go so fast
[1:23:19] any consolation if any comfort of love
[1:23:21] if any fellowship of the spirit
[1:23:25] if any bowels of mercy fulfill ye my joy
[1:23:31] that you be
[1:23:33] like-minded
[1:23:37] come on folks
[1:23:40] how many believes that we have to be
[1:23:42] like my we need to think the same things
[1:23:47] brother perry's know that when they were
[1:23:48] in the upper room they were what
[1:23:51] with one mind one accord one mind
[1:23:56] they had one goal one ambition and it
[1:23:59] was so unified that the god himself when
[1:24:02] they got in that place in that condition
[1:24:04] christ came down
[1:24:06] when we come together
[1:24:09] that's what we're supposed to have if we
[1:24:10] all come to church expecting
[1:24:15] folks so many times one person will come
[1:24:18] up and say brother
[1:24:19] brother that was just for me
[1:24:22] huh
[1:24:23] that'll be the only person that ever
[1:24:25] says anything about having enjoyed the
[1:24:28] service huh now the others probably
[1:24:32] probably everybody did
[1:24:34] but if that person comes with
[1:24:35] expectation and they're ready to hear
[1:24:37] from and that the holy spirit speaks to
[1:24:39] that person
[1:24:41] they make a special note a lot of times
[1:24:43] to tell the preacher hey brother i want
[1:24:44] you to know that was for me
[1:24:48] and don't ask don't ask me how preaching
[1:24:50] works
[1:24:52] other than you have to be led by the
[1:24:53] spirit
[1:24:54] because i've preached
[1:24:56] sermons that i felt like was a flop like
[1:24:58] i just really didn't get off the ground
[1:25:00] with this airplane
[1:25:01] we just had to go ahead and shut her
[1:25:03] back down
[1:25:05] you know and it'll be in those services
[1:25:07] somebody will come and say that i'm like
[1:25:10] wow you know
[1:25:14] like i said i don't know how maybe god
[1:25:15] maybe god kept me down here so i would
[1:25:18] say something
[1:25:19] that maybe i wouldn't have said up there
[1:25:22] but he wanted to say something to
[1:25:24] somebody and he is the one that is in
[1:25:26] the control tower how many believes that
[1:25:29] now i believe that's how it ought to be
[1:25:30] don't you
[1:25:32] it always makes you feel good whether
[1:25:33] you preach a sermon that you felt like
[1:25:35] the roof almost came off or you never
[1:25:37] left the ground as long as god's doing
[1:25:39] it that's all we care about
[1:25:42] amen
[1:25:44] so paul says here he says for you my f
[1:25:47] for you my joy fulfill you my choice and
[1:25:50] all of that to say this
[1:25:52] that you think alike that you feel like
[1:25:56] now we all have a little bit of
[1:25:58] difference but i'm telling you what i
[1:25:59] believe the closer we can get to
[1:26:00] thinking the same thing the better off
[1:26:02] we are
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:06] i'll just stop here because it comes to
[1:26:08] my brain and i probably won't say it if
[1:26:09] i don't say it
[1:26:11] do you realize that's the problem with
[1:26:13] our nation right now
[1:26:17] lincoln say about a country divided
[1:26:23] a house divided against itself jesus
[1:26:26] said
[1:26:27] he repeated
[1:26:29] befall
[1:26:30] it cannot stand how many knows that our
[1:26:34] former presidents and different ones
[1:26:36] won't mention names but you probably
[1:26:37] know said we are going to fundamentally
[1:26:40] change america
[1:26:43] so we know that there's a group that's
[1:26:44] wanting to not have america to be
[1:26:47] america anymore they want to change it
[1:26:50] huh
[1:26:52] and there's the christian or
[1:26:53] conservative there's a lot of us that
[1:26:55] don't really want to change it
[1:27:00] i like my constitution
[1:27:02] i like america
[1:27:04] you know
[1:27:06] i
[1:27:06] sure i mean not so much anymore but
[1:27:09] you know what i'm saying
[1:27:12] i like what the foreign fathers i like
[1:27:13] the idea that we were a christian nation
[1:27:15] we could actually say we were a
[1:27:17] christian nation god was with us
[1:27:19] he sure ain't anymore
[1:27:21] that's the truth
[1:27:26] but it's because that they divide they
[1:27:28] don't think a lot they don't have the
[1:27:30] same god they're not going to write in
[1:27:32] the same direction
[1:27:33] you cannot have fellowship with people
[1:27:36] that are going in a different direction
[1:27:40] not in a nation
[1:27:44] not in a family
[1:27:46] not in a church
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:49] huh
[1:27:50] when you've got a church where somebody
[1:27:53] wants to go in a certain direction
[1:27:56] huh
[1:27:57] the pastor wants to go a certain
[1:27:58] direction you are in for some trouble
[1:28:01] the splash will fly upwards
[1:28:05] when you've got a husband and wife that
[1:28:07] can't get along
[1:28:09] it gets a little
[1:28:11] sparky huh
[1:28:15] yeah
[1:28:16] that's the truth
[1:28:20] amen
[1:28:21] something has to give but praise the
[1:28:23] lord now notice so he says that ye may
[1:28:26] be like-minded having the same love
[1:28:29] being of one accord
[1:28:33] this ain't just me preaching folks this
[1:28:35] is the scriptures
[1:28:37] the court and of one mind
[1:28:42] one mind one accord one direction
[1:28:47] what is our goal church
[1:28:51] make the rapture
[1:28:53] to be in the rapture to go to heaven
[1:28:54] that is our goal
[1:28:56] he didn't have this hope in him in him
[1:28:59] the bible says purify us himself even as
[1:29:01] he is pure
[1:29:03] that's our goal if we don't have that
[1:29:05] goal that we don't have much in common
[1:29:13] hello
[1:29:15] there's baptist there's methodists
[1:29:16] there's presbyterian there's amish there
[1:29:19] are mennonite there's beechy amish
[1:29:20] there's beachy amish mennonite
[1:29:25] yeah there's all three piled together
[1:29:27] there's this that there's the other
[1:29:30] they don't agree with each other they
[1:29:32] can't walk with each other
[1:29:34] there's pentecost
[1:29:37] huh
[1:29:38] and how many knows we came out from all
[1:29:40] of that
[1:29:42] to follow what
[1:29:44] the manifested vindicated word of the
[1:29:47] hour to follow the word
[1:29:49] it's back to the word the proven word
[1:29:54] i want to get into that just a little
[1:29:55] bit later
[1:29:57] but just to shake you
[1:29:59] people so many people claim to be
[1:30:00] following the word let me just tap this
[1:30:02] a little bit i can't hardly get off of
[1:30:04] it but the pharisees how many knows the
[1:30:06] pharisees and the scribes they were
[1:30:08] israel they were the church the way that
[1:30:09] god had meant for him that he set up
[1:30:12] if there was ever a people of god in the
[1:30:14] church of god it was israel but yet when
[1:30:16] christ came he condemned him
[1:30:21] huh
[1:30:22] he condemned them he said you make the
[1:30:24] word of god a non-effect he called him
[1:30:26] you are your father the devil and his
[1:30:28] works were doing everything else
[1:30:30] the whole system of what seemed to be
[1:30:31] what was god wasn't god so be careful
[1:30:35] you got to make sure that you're sure
[1:30:36] that you're following christ
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] all right
[1:30:42] so he says
[1:30:46] like-minded of one accord of one mind
[1:30:52] why
[1:30:53] because the next word will explain what
[1:30:55] will happen if you're not
[1:30:58] let nothing be done through
[1:31:01] strife
[1:31:03] or vainglory
[1:31:07] how many knows brother brown could have
[1:31:08] taken up those offers of a debate
[1:31:12] no he says debates lead to arguments and
[1:31:15] fussing and the holy ghost don't do that
[1:31:19] the holy ghost shows you the truth and
[1:31:21] you follow it or
[1:31:23] we don't even have such a custom paul
[1:31:25] said if people don't want to listen to
[1:31:26] this then we don't even have such a
[1:31:28] custom we're not going to argue about it
[1:31:30] but if you believe paul let any and
[1:31:33] preacher or angel come from heaven if
[1:31:35] he's a a spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:31:37] that the things that we write unto you
[1:31:39] are the commandments of god now
[1:31:41] when somebody comes says well it doesn't
[1:31:42] matter what paul says
[1:31:44] huh can you fellowship with somebody
[1:31:46] like that
[1:31:47] how many knows the one thing we believe
[1:31:49] is this is bible is true
[1:31:50] every bit of it is true and that we are
[1:31:53] not to live by one word or two words or
[1:31:55] some of this and some of that and say
[1:31:57] well we don't believe that part of the
[1:31:59] bible i don't have fellowship with you i
[1:32:00] believe all of the word i believe this
[1:32:02] is the eternal word of god it's all true
[1:32:07] because jesus said man shall not live by
[1:32:08] bread alone but by every word that
[1:32:10] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:32:14] praise the lord
[1:32:15] if you don't believe that you can't amen
[1:32:17] to that
[1:32:18] but i believe it
[1:32:20] you love him
[1:32:21] now notice so he says
[1:32:24] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:32:26] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[1:32:29] each esteem
[1:32:31] other better than themselves
[1:32:35] look not every man to his own thing but
[1:32:36] every man also to the things of others
[1:32:39] let this mind be in you
[1:32:42] that was also in christ jesus
[1:32:55] i don't know if you've ever been called
[1:32:56] crazy or not
[1:32:59] you're crazy
[1:33:01] huh you've lost your mind
[1:33:04] huh you know what i have to say that
[1:33:06] yeah you're exactly right
[1:33:09] i did lose my mind
[1:33:12] i lost my mind in romans
[1:33:17] the sixth verse
[1:33:19] see one time i was
[1:33:22] carnally minded
[1:33:24] for to be carnally minded is death
[1:33:27] how many knows that's what the whole
[1:33:29] world is minded
[1:33:30] this carnally minded it's death
[1:33:33] we just had a mass shooting overdue
[1:33:35] overnight i guess it was six people
[1:33:37] getting shot and killed and all of this
[1:33:39] why because to be carnally minded his
[1:33:41] death a believer a christ-like mind that
[1:33:44] would never do something like that he
[1:33:45] wouldn't murder and kill his sleeve and
[1:33:48] steal and stuff no but to be carnally
[1:33:51] minded is that but to be spiritually
[1:33:52] minded is life and peace
[1:33:55] because the carnal mind is immunity it's
[1:33:59] against god
[1:34:00] i mean it's just your carnal mind will
[1:34:03] never think the things that the holy
[1:34:05] spirit or christ's mind will think
[1:34:09] no
[1:34:12] no it's imminent against god for it is
[1:34:14] not subject to the law of god neither
[1:34:17] indeed can be
[1:34:19] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:34:21] cannot please god amen
[1:34:25] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:34:28] spirit
[1:34:29] why do you think the prophet said that
[1:34:31] if you aren't born of the holy ghost
[1:34:34] hello
[1:34:35] you're not in your right mind
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:44] let me see how i wrote this down the
[1:34:46] world says that we are
[1:34:48] out of our mind praise be to god i'm
[1:34:51] happy this way they say i'm crazy yeah
[1:34:53] paul said after the way that they call
[1:34:55] heresy which is crazy so worship i the
[1:34:59] god of my father
[1:35:01] who was it one of those one of those uh
[1:35:04] uh quote now i forget his name now but
[1:35:07] one of i'd hear it but one of them said
[1:35:09] you know you know you're oh you're like
[1:35:11] a madman or something you know
[1:35:14] but anyway so not those the world says
[1:35:16] that we are out of our mind yeah we have
[1:35:19] lost our mind our carnal mind is what
[1:35:21] we've lost and we've got our mind that
[1:35:24] you're supposed to have and i write down
[1:35:27] here listen but they are out of the
[1:35:30] right mind
[1:35:33] they are out of the right mind they
[1:35:35] don't have the right this world
[1:35:38] everyone out there think about that's
[1:35:40] not born of the holy spirit
[1:35:42] doesn't have the right that they're
[1:35:44] supposed to have
[1:35:47] so who's the crazy one
[1:35:49] who's the one that's really out of the
[1:35:51] mind
[1:35:53] well i ain't got to say nothing i ain't
[1:35:55] got to say a word all you have to do is
[1:35:57] look around and listen to our politics
[1:35:59] and you'll know who is out of their mind
[1:36:01] and if you don't think they're out of
[1:36:02] mind you ain't in your right mind either
[1:36:08] you think that's the right mind you need
[1:36:10] a mind change
[1:36:12] huh
[1:36:14] that's right
[1:36:15] god help us
[1:36:17] you know what we have to preach any more
[1:36:18] days we got to teach our children that
[1:36:20] if if they were born with the genetics
[1:36:24] of a male
[1:36:25] oh
[1:36:26] guess what god made you a man
[1:36:32] that's right if you're a little bit
[1:36:34] dating you look
[1:36:35] a little girlish go to the workout room
[1:36:40] all right start trying to look and act
[1:36:42] like a man don't get all dainty on me

[1:36:50] [Applause]
[1:36:51] start being a man
[1:36:53] you were born a woman the same way
[1:36:57] huh
[1:36:59] but what did they do no they cut their
[1:37:01] hair like a man they look like a man

[1:37:06] supposed to have long hair
[1:37:09] and that right they cut theirs off and
[1:37:11] all of these sissies and some of these
[1:37:13] hunting shows brother joe with these
[1:37:15] long hairs

[1:37:20] i saw your hair

[1:37:38] there and you don't have nose rings and
[1:37:40] so forth they look at you and they think
[1:37:42] you're weird
[1:37:43] what do you think when you look at that
[1:37:44] he says that is
[1:37:46] weird
[1:37:48] there's some weird people in the world
[1:37:51] why because they ain't in their right
[1:37:52] mind
[1:37:55] the prophet said he said you know and
[1:37:56] it's true the guys are long good and
[1:37:59] long hairs

[1:38:25] fellowship on with another
[1:38:28] huh how are they going to have
[1:38:30] fellowship with god they're not going to
[1:38:32] have fellowship with god
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:37] my so to be carnally minded is death
[1:38:40] praise the lord
[1:38:43] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:38:46] peace
[1:38:48] how many know the only way you'll ever
[1:38:50] get peace is to change your mind
[1:38:53] is to say god i don't know what to do i
[1:38:55] don't know where to go i can't go
[1:38:57] anymore
[1:38:58] i want to give you my life i want to
[1:39:00] give you my heart i want to give you my
[1:39:02] bible says to love him with all your
[1:39:03] heart soul mind and strength
[1:39:06] you gotta love it with your mind give
[1:39:08] him your mind also
[1:39:11] amen let him come in there and let you
[1:39:13] allow you to believe this bible believe
[1:39:16] what he did on calvary huh
[1:39:19] because it is a gift
[1:39:21] it is a grace
[1:39:23] to you to be able to believe this word
[1:39:26] because look at all the people that
[1:39:27] don't
[1:39:29] so that's mercy to be able to bring this
[1:39:32] and to believe what christ did to
[1:39:34] forgive you of all of your sins all of
[1:39:36] your past can be god
[1:39:39] you can be as free and as happy and as
[1:39:41] jumpy as any of these little kids that
[1:39:44] are not at the age of accountability yet
[1:39:48] amen
[1:39:50] that's exact i don't care if you're uh
[1:39:52] how old you are
[1:39:56] hey man you can kick up your kill say
[1:39:58] well praise be to god you ain't got
[1:40:00] enough room up here for me just like a
[1:40:02] little kid
[1:40:04] as innocent as a kid
[1:40:07] as happy as a kid as joyful as a kid as
[1:40:10] much peace as a kid
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:15] such a child i guess
[1:40:17] people might think you're talking about
[1:40:19] goats but we're not talking about goat
[1:40:22] as a child as a as a kid amen you love
[1:40:24] him
[1:40:26] praise be to god
[1:40:30] my
[1:40:32] jesus loves
[1:40:34] for us to be one
[1:40:36] how many believes
[1:40:37] jesus loves
[1:40:39] when we love one another
[1:40:43] when we are together as one
[1:40:46] let me tell you something church eating
[1:40:47] like tabernacle maybe we need to work on
[1:40:49] this a little bit but we are to be
[1:40:52] united together we're supposed to be and
[1:40:54] think alike
[1:41:00] jesus said in chapter 17 of saint john
[1:41:05] verse 22
[1:41:06] let's go with 20 20. neither pray i for
[1:41:10] these alone but for them which shall
[1:41:12] believe on me through their word
[1:41:14] that they all they all may be one
[1:41:18] as thou father art in me
[1:41:21] huh
[1:41:23] how many know jesus loves unity in a
[1:41:26] group of people
[1:41:28] see
[1:41:30] god which is jesus he knew what it was
[1:41:32] like to be in heaven
[1:41:33] to have disunity in heaven
[1:41:36] two-thirds of the angels
[1:41:38] right or a third of the angels sided
[1:41:40] with satan
[1:41:41] and he had to kick them all out
[1:41:45] excuse me so god doesn't like this unity
[1:41:47] role he don't it's not how he does it
[1:41:50] amen he loves for his people to dwell
[1:41:52] together
[1:41:56] that fellowship one with another
[1:41:59] that they may be one as so the example
[1:42:02] is
[1:42:03] like the father and jesus were one
[1:42:07] how many know they were actually in the
[1:42:08] same body
[1:42:10] are in me and i indeed that they also
[1:42:13] may be one in us that the world may
[1:42:15] believe that god has sent me
[1:42:17] the glory which thou gavest me i have
[1:42:20] given them that they may be one
[1:42:23] even as we are
[1:42:25] one i in them thou in me
[1:42:29] that they may be pure be perfect in one
[1:42:32] and that the world may know that thou
[1:42:33] hast sent me and has loved them
[1:42:36] as thou has loved me
[1:42:39] amen
[1:42:42] paul
[1:42:42] he believed in unity
[1:42:44] first corinthians 1 and verse 10 says
[1:42:46] now i beseech you brethren by the name
[1:42:49] of our lord jesus christ that ye all
[1:42:51] speak
[1:42:52] the same thing
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:56] how many believes that ought to be it's
[1:42:58] how it ought to be
[1:42:59] we speak the same three think the same
[1:43:02] way
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:07] that there be no divisions among you and
[1:43:10] that ye be perfectly joy be joined
[1:43:12] together
[1:43:14] in the same mind and in the same
[1:43:17] judgment
[1:43:19] again it goes back to two can't walk
[1:43:22] together unless they're agreed
[1:43:25] the body of christ how many knows by one
[1:43:26] spirit are we all baptized into one body
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:32] and that body is to be one it ought to
[1:43:35] be in unison
[1:43:38] amen when my when my body tells me to
[1:43:40] move my fingers and hands it says to
[1:43:42] take a step forward my feet disobey just
[1:43:45] exactly what that body says do
[1:43:50] folks
[1:43:53] i don't know how to say this but
[1:43:54] sometimes i wonder if we don't have a
[1:43:57] sometimes you have a maybe you have a
[1:43:59] body
[1:44:00] all of us they got people some people
[1:44:02] got the jerks you can't stop that jerk i
[1:44:04] wish you would quit but my arm keeps
[1:44:06] just going to the side
[1:44:08] huh
[1:44:10] what are you going to ask by the parish
[1:44:13] what are you going to ask me what is
[1:44:15] wrong with your arm no
[1:44:17] what is wrong with your heart what is
[1:44:19] wrong with you there's something wrong
[1:44:20] you don't just normally keep doing that
[1:44:27] i don't know this is off script i guess
[1:44:29] but
[1:44:30] i hope it helps you
[1:44:33] that body is supposed to be
[1:44:35] one
[1:44:36] just
[1:44:37] everything
[1:44:39] does what
[1:44:41] the mind tells it to
[1:44:43] right and this is supposed to be
[1:44:45] governed by christ
[1:44:46] right whatever and he is the head how
[1:44:49] many knows it says that the body that
[1:44:51] jesus is the head of the body
[1:44:53] he is the mind of the body
[1:44:56] he tells it what to do it moves all
[1:44:59] according to him
[1:45:01] the way that he wants it to move
[1:45:04] oh when we get together like that a rap
[1:45:05] shall take place
[1:45:07] we come into perfect harmony
[1:45:09] that's what god wants perfect harmony
[1:45:12] with this word
[1:45:16] jesus said all things are possible to
[1:45:18] them that believe
[1:45:20] nothing shall be impossible with you
[1:45:23] do you know what those bible schools out
[1:45:25] there taught in brother branham's hour
[1:45:27] they were teaching that the holy ghost
[1:45:28] was only for the 12 disciples they were
[1:45:31] saying there's no such thing as the holy
[1:45:32] ghost today the days of miracles this
[1:45:34] past is what they were teaching them
[1:45:38] weren't they
[1:45:39] now tell me was that the mind of christ
[1:45:41] no that was not the mind of christ
[1:45:42] that's why the prophet god come along
[1:45:44] and correct that thing
[1:45:48] oh my
[1:45:49] can i tell you a story again maybe
[1:45:51] somebody hadn't heard it
[1:45:55] young man went off to bible school to
[1:45:58] learn about the bible and his mom got
[1:46:00] real sick and was fixing to die and they
[1:46:02] sent word to the son said your mom is
[1:46:04] about to die you better come home
[1:46:07] well
[1:46:08] mom had a friend that said well you know
[1:46:10] we got a little old church down on the
[1:46:11] corner we believe in praying for the
[1:46:12] sake

[1:46:17] there and get prayed for she went down
[1:46:19] there and she got prayed for and she got
[1:46:21] well said word to the son no he ain't
[1:46:23] got to come

[1:46:27] when he does come home
[1:46:29] he asked mom well mom whatever happened
[1:46:33] how did you get better she had to tell
[1:46:35] them but we went down there and they

[1:46:42] the sink and they shall recover

[1:46:50] huh
[1:46:51] you know them people are kind of looked
[1:46:53] down upon and so forth and we learned in
[1:46:55] our bible school that mark 16 from the
[1:46:57] like the 16th verse or some a little bit
[1:47:00] before that from there on is not even
[1:47:02] inspired
[1:47:06] tell me the devil ain't that worth
[1:47:07] teaching things that's contrary to the
[1:47:09] word
[1:47:12] now how many knows the holy spirit
[1:47:13] always has a way to come back
[1:47:16] the holy spirit always gets the last
[1:47:17] word
[1:47:19] i like that the holy spirit always
[1:47:22] corrects he says
[1:47:25] praise be to god holland mom what's with
[1:47:27] you well i was just thinking son if god
[1:47:30] can heal me with the uninspired word
[1:47:33] what can he do with this part
[1:47:37] praise be to god
[1:47:40] what a rebuke
[1:47:42] amen folks we're living in a generation
[1:47:45] where
[1:47:46] churches
[1:47:47] don't think the way that god wants them
[1:47:49] to they aren't on the same page with god
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:56] i want to get to the point i want to
[1:47:57] bring up about the pharisees and so
[1:47:59] forth because we know that they were the
[1:48:01] church of the hour
[1:48:02] right one thing that a believer believes
[1:48:05] is that jesus christ is the same
[1:48:08] yesterday today and forever his word is
[1:48:11] eternal it never passes away
[1:48:14] isn't that right
[1:48:16] his word does not pass away and sooner
[1:48:18] or later he comes and he fulfills every
[1:48:21] promise that he made
[1:48:23] when jesus came how many knows that was
[1:48:25] a promise that was made
[1:48:27] and it was being fulfilled right in
[1:48:29] front of their eyes
[1:48:32] and yet they were so blind hello
[1:48:37] because i want you to know something
[1:48:39] jesus and the pharisees didn't get along
[1:48:42] very well
[1:48:47] they didn't
[1:48:49] a believer and a unbeliever really don't
[1:48:52] have a lot in common
[1:48:58] i believe this paul said it this way he
[1:49:00] says that you're not supposed to be
[1:49:02] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:49:04] unbelievers
[1:49:06] in other words don't marry somebody that
[1:49:08] don't believe like you do
[1:49:11] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:49:13] unbelievers for what fellowship has
[1:49:16] righteousness with unrighteousness
[1:49:20] oh my think about it
[1:49:22] if you're interested in righteousness
[1:49:24] we'll have fellowship if you're not we
[1:49:26] won't that's what with jesus and the
[1:49:29] pharisees
[1:49:31] what was it saint john 3 16 there
[1:49:33] somewhere in there and he says and this
[1:49:35] is uh the condemnation that light has
[1:49:38] come into the world after he said forgot
[1:49:40] to love the world he says this is
[1:49:41] condemnation let's come and men
[1:49:44] love darkness rather than life
[1:49:48] any time that the
[1:49:50] truth is presented in front of a person
[1:49:53] if they are not of the light they will
[1:49:56] not enjoy it they will scatter from it
[1:49:58] they'll get away from it
[1:50:01] what fellowship so my question now on
[1:50:02] the way to church i thought what
[1:50:03] fellowship does
[1:50:04] light have with darkness
[1:50:07] do you see the two present at once
[1:50:10] no as soon as you turn on the light the
[1:50:12] darkness scatters
[1:50:14] it leaves they have no fellowship
[1:50:17] huh
[1:50:19] just exactly like when you come into
[1:50:21] florida kitchen brother urban and you
[1:50:24] turn the light on at night you'll find
[1:50:26] out if you got roaches or not
[1:50:29] if you got roaches man they would come
[1:50:31] off of that counter and scatter like you
[1:50:33] wouldn't believe they'll get to get
[1:50:34] scoot out they love the
[1:50:36] darkness huh
[1:50:38] if you really want a nightmare amen i
[1:50:41] was sleeping one time with my shirt off
[1:50:43] and i heard
[1:50:47] landed right on my chest and come
[1:50:49] running up towards my head
[1:50:52] i don't know about you but i don't like
[1:50:53] roaches
[1:50:55] creatures of the night
[1:50:57] they love the darkness
[1:50:59] reminds me of the pharisees think about
[1:51:02] it the truth was right there in front of
[1:51:04] them jesus come and he manifested the
[1:51:07] word of god
[1:51:09] oh my jesus said my sheep know my voice
[1:51:13] they hear my voice they know the truth
[1:51:16] so where does that put all these
[1:51:18] denominational churches that saw jesus
[1:51:20] christ discerning the thoughts and
[1:51:21] intents of the heart just like he did
[1:51:23] with the woman at the well over and over
[1:51:26] and over again
[1:51:28] and pointed us to not his own words not
[1:51:30] to himself not to him being popular or a
[1:51:33] millionaire or moral millionaire but
[1:51:35] took us right straight to the word of
[1:51:38] god said all of your name putting on a
[1:51:40] book on somewhere in the book of church
[1:51:42] that don't mean nothing ain't no bible
[1:51:43] for it
[1:51:44] the bible says by one spirit i would
[1:51:46] baptize into one body that's how you get
[1:51:49] into the body and then become a member
[1:51:51] in particular
[1:51:53] isn't that right that's the right way
[1:51:54] acts 2 38
[1:51:56] amen repent every one of you and be
[1:51:58] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:52:00] christ there's only one way to come not
[1:52:02] all kinds of different ways
[1:52:04] all your good deeds isn't going to do
[1:52:05] that you got to come by the way the word
[1:52:07] chest whether it's for knowledge whether
[1:52:09] it's predestination whether it's your
[1:52:11] name being on the book all of those
[1:52:13] things are straightened up
[1:52:15] and then jesus christ would come down
[1:52:17] and vindicate it and prove it because it
[1:52:19] was the word
[1:52:20] not brother branham's word it was god's
[1:52:22] word
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:25] what did it do for us that were of the
[1:52:28] light something happened down here
[1:52:31] didn't it
[1:52:32] something down here happened
[1:52:35] that's why we're sitting here
[1:52:37] because we're in agreement that god send
[1:52:40] a prophet in this generation
[1:52:42] behold i'll send you elijah the prophet
[1:52:44] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:52:47] lord
[1:52:48] not the acceptable year of the lord john
[1:52:50] the baptist but the day great and
[1:52:52] dreadfully i'll send you elijah the
[1:52:54] prophet he'll turn our hearts back isn't
[1:52:56] that right we fellowship around the
[1:52:59] truth that we stay with what the bible
[1:53:01] said
[1:53:03] and we say with what that prophet says
[1:53:04] when it comes to the interpretation now
[1:53:06] remember
[1:53:08] a prophet is a divine revealer of the
[1:53:10] word of god according to the scriptures
[1:53:12] they
[1:53:13] the word of god comes to the prophets
[1:53:17] surely i will do nothing but reveal my
[1:53:20] secrets unto my servants the prophets
[1:53:22] the bible says
[1:53:23] how many is in agreement
[1:53:26] amen and we come out of amish i come out
[1:53:29] of army he can't dead sweats as good as
[1:53:31] he comes english
[1:53:32] yeah come from amish mennonite
[1:53:36] baptist pentecostal
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:42] invisible union probably god says you
[1:53:44] know he used to say you know now he
[1:53:46] finds you a local church somewhere but
[1:53:48] towards the end when they put christ
[1:53:50] outside of the church and he was
[1:53:51] knocking trying to get back in
[1:53:54] huh because their thinking was different
[1:53:57] than what christ's thinking was
[1:53:59] they thought different they took their
[1:54:01] own thinking they lead to their own
[1:54:03] understanding
[1:54:04] then we had to come out of it come on be
[1:54:06] not partakers of our sentence you
[1:54:08] receive none of her plagues he called
[1:54:10] her the mother of harlots and
[1:54:12] abominations of the earth
[1:54:14] that great
[1:54:15] huh
[1:54:17] anytime you deny christ let me tell you
[1:54:19] something you can't expect to make it to
[1:54:22] heaven and say well i believe this
[1:54:24] portion of the word but i don't believe
[1:54:25] that part of the word
[1:54:26] my church teaches different
[1:54:29] right there you separate yourself from
[1:54:31] god
[1:54:32] because i don't care what church it is i
[1:54:34] don't care if it's this church
[1:54:36] huh
[1:54:38] this church better be preaching what
[1:54:39] this word says or it's wrong
[1:54:42] the bible says let every man's word be a
[1:54:44] lie and mind the truth that's the
[1:54:46] agreement
[1:54:48] amen you believe it
[1:54:51] so listen what he says
[1:54:53] and what communion
[1:54:55] has light with darkness
[1:54:57] it absolutely has no fellowship
[1:55:00] what was the
[1:55:02] quote says you know you can't be he
[1:55:04] makes a statement you can't be the bride
[1:55:06] of jesus christ in this hour and belong
[1:55:10] to some man-made denomination
[1:55:13] no you can't because they don't have no
[1:55:15] fellows they don't have any communion
[1:55:17] together
[1:55:23] you wouldn't sit here
[1:55:26] i want to say i wouldn't sit here but
[1:55:27] i'm here
[1:55:29] if i come up here and said something
[1:55:31] contrary to the word of god
[1:55:33] if this church was
[1:55:35] the brother's coming here
[1:55:37] with long hair
[1:55:39] huh
[1:55:40] not dressed right not do right not act
[1:55:42] right
[1:55:43] mostly our sisters is what shows what
[1:55:45] the church condition is isn't that right
[1:55:47] because we usually dress you know but
[1:55:49] our sister coming here they dress wrong
[1:55:51] they dress like a prostitute they look
[1:55:53] like one can't have them up in the sink
[1:55:55] because their skirts are too tight or
[1:55:57] they're wearing pants the bible calls
[1:55:58] with deuteronomy an abomination
[1:56:01] huh
[1:56:02] it used to be an abomination in the
[1:56:04] early 1900s but all of a sudden it
[1:56:06] become legal no no no no
[1:56:08] you used to give arrest them for many
[1:56:10] skirts but now all of a sudden no it's
[1:56:11] not okay just because you make it okay
[1:56:14] if it wasn't okay then it's not okay now
[1:56:17] a woman to cut her hair huh even
[1:56:19] pentecost they used to preach it you
[1:56:21] know
[1:56:22] paul says let it be shorn or shaven you
[1:56:24] know
[1:56:25] it's a
[1:56:26] shame right
[1:56:29] and it's a shame for a man to have long
[1:56:31] hair so it's just a shame for a woman to
[1:56:32] cut her hair
[1:56:34] i don't care what part of the word it is
[1:56:35] i want all of it don't you
[1:56:38] not just some of it because that's what
[1:56:39] that's why the whole world is going to
[1:56:40] hell it's because they just take some of
[1:56:42] the word
[1:56:45] you can't be a part of something like
[1:56:47] that you can't belong to something like
[1:56:49] that expect to be
[1:56:50] the bride of jesus christ
[1:56:54] amen why because you have no fellowship
[1:56:57] how many know jesus is coming one of
[1:56:59] these days what is he coming for
[1:57:02] when a boy meets a girl you want to date
[1:57:05] her and you want to get to know her real
[1:57:07] good vice versa
[1:57:09] to make sure you're on the right page
[1:57:12] the same page
[1:57:13] that you have the same goal that you
[1:57:15] think alike isn't that right because if
[1:57:18] you don't you have trouble down the road
[1:57:22] amen and jesus christ is coming for a
[1:57:25] bride for a people
[1:57:27] that think
[1:57:29] like he does
[1:57:32] how many wants to be lord let this mind
[1:57:34] be in you
[1:57:36] that was also in christ jesus so that we
[1:57:38] can have fellowship we can have
[1:57:40] something to talk about
[1:57:42] amen when he says something we say amen
[1:57:45] amen you love him this morning
[1:57:47] amen all right we want to take the
[1:57:49] lord's supper and communion this morning
[1:57:51] so if you will we'll change the order to
[1:57:52] service stand with me if you will
[1:57:57] let's bow our heads
[1:58:01] with those few words how many in here
[1:58:04] just have a greater desire to think the
[1:58:06] way that you're supposed to the way that
[1:58:08] jesus wants you to think lord help me to
[1:58:11] think the right thought i've got his
[1:58:12] spirit i believe i'm holy spirit filled
[1:58:14] but sometimes thoughts want to come into
[1:58:16] my mind
[1:58:17] just like it did judas the devil put
[1:58:19] into his mind to betray him he put doubt
[1:58:22] in there even though he had walked with
[1:58:24] him all that time and we don't want to
[1:58:25] be no judas we don't want the devil to
[1:58:27] put any kind of thoughts in our mind
[1:58:29] this morning we just want to think his
[1:58:30] thoughts god bless those hands lord help
[1:58:32] us to think your thoughts and think the
[1:58:34] way that you want us to think the way
[1:58:36] we're supposed to be lord and we just
[1:58:38] ask god that you'd help us lord so that
[1:58:40] we could have divine fellowship with you
[1:58:43] on a daily basis in jesus name bless
[1:58:46] those hands now amen and amen
[1:58:49] god bless you this morning
[1:58:51] you love him
[1:58:53] now
[1:58:54] we have come we have feasted at his
[1:58:56] table we have fellowship around his word
[1:58:58] and around christ
[1:58:59] and this we realize that this is a
[1:59:01] symbol
[1:59:02] of
[1:59:03] his broken body and his blood that was
[1:59:06] shed for us so that we could have
[1:59:08] constant communion
[1:59:10] constant fellowship with jesus christ
[1:59:12] let's turn our bibles if you will to
[1:59:14] first corinthians
[1:59:30] you
