[38:25] out of first corinthians 4.
[38:28] first corinthians 4. the way that i got
[38:30] to thinking about this
[38:32] i got to thinking about david
[38:35] and i was thinking about david
[38:37] and
[38:39] um let's uh actually i've got that wrote
[38:42] down i pulled it up just before i come
[38:44] out here because i want to read it and i
[38:46] think we'll go to that one first first
[38:48] second samuel
[38:50] ii samuel
[38:53] i haven't even turned to it yet
[38:58] that's going to be the sixth chapter
[39:02] ii samuel 6.
[39:07] and since it was him that i was thinking
[39:09] about before we go into the new
[39:11] testament
[39:13] uh six and
[39:27] i'll bring that down a little bit
[39:30] verse 20 will begin how many remembers
[39:33] that this was when the ark of the lord
[39:35] was coming back into jerusalem coming
[39:37] back home amen
[39:39] and david was very very happy he was
[39:42] very glad
[39:43] when it happened in that right and we'll
[39:44] begin with verse let's go back back with
[39:46] 4 verse 14
[39:49] 13 and it was so that when they that
[39:51] bear the ark of the lord had gone six
[39:53] paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
[39:57] and david danced before the lord with
[39:59] all of his might and david was girded
[40:00] with a linen ephod
[40:02] so david and all the house of israel
[40:04] brought up the ark of the lord with
[40:06] shouting and with the sound of a trumpet
[40:08] and as the ark of the lord came
[40:11] into the city of david mike
[40:14] michael i guess
[40:16] saul's daughter looked
[40:18] through a window and saw king david
[40:21] leaping and dancing before the lord and
[40:23] she despised
[40:24] him in her heart
[40:28] and they brought up brought in the ark
[40:30] of the lord and set it in his place in
[40:32] the midst of the tabernacle that david
[40:33] had pitched for it and david offered
[40:35] burnt offerings and peace offerings
[40:37] before the lord and as soon as david had
[40:39] made an end of offering burnt offerings
[40:41] and peace offering he blessed the people
[40:42] in the name of the lord of hosts and he
[40:44] dealt among all the people even among
[40:47] the whole multitude of israel as well to
[40:50] the
[40:50] women and men to everyone a cake of
[40:53] bread and a good piece of flesh and a
[40:55] flagon of wine so all the people
[40:57] departed everyone to his house then
[41:00] david returned to bless his household
[41:02] and my michael the daughter of saul
[41:04] came out to meet david and said how
[41:07] glorious was the king of israel today
[41:09] who uncovered himself today in the eyes
[41:12] of the hands-maids of his servants as
[41:15] one of the vain fellows shamelessly
[41:18] uncovers himself
[41:19] and david said unto my michael
[41:22] michelle is it
[41:24] i don't know how to pronounce that
[41:26] m-i-c-h-a-l matchelle a chell we'll just
[41:29] do the best we can
[41:31] michelle all right
[41:33] we got teachers here that probably tell
[41:34] us amen and david said unto michelle if
[41:37] if it was before the lord
[41:40] who's who which chose me before my
[41:43] father and before all of his house to
[41:45] appoint me ruler over the people of the
[41:47] of the lord over israel therefore will i
[41:50] play before the lord
[41:51] and i will yet again them be more vile
[41:54] than thus
[41:55] and will be based in my own sight and in
[41:58] and of the hands matrix i have spoken of
[42:00] them shall i be made head in honor shall
[42:04] i be had in honor
[42:05] and michael the daughter of saul had no
[42:08] child unto the day of her death
[42:10] over in first corinthians one more
[42:12] scripture
[42:16] one more scripture over in first
[42:17] corinthians
[42:19] amen in chapter four
[42:23] and i'll just read the first part of
[42:26] verse 10 and then we want to try to go
[42:28] back and pick up a few thoughts on this
[42:30] thought
[42:32] chapter 4 verse 10 we are fools for
[42:35] christ's sake may god add his blessings
[42:36] to the reasoning word you can be seated
[42:39] amen
[42:42] amen i was thinking about david and how
[42:44] that
[42:45] he danced before the lord and how happy
[42:47] he got and i was thinking about this i
[42:50] i was thinking if the thought came to my
[42:52] heart says is it okay to be stupid
[42:56] but for the lord
[42:58] [Laughter]
[43:02] is it all right to get plum stupid for
[43:04] the lord
[43:06] amen now we know that
[43:08] down through history amen and especially
[43:10] in the early 1900s the pentecost move
[43:13] come on the holy ghost come upon people
[43:15] people spoke in tongues and we've heard
[43:17] all kinds of stories people running the
[43:19] aisles running on top of benches running
[43:22] outside the building running people just
[43:24] going crazy so to speak
[43:26] right
[43:27] we've heard a lot of things that people
[43:29] do under the influence of the holy ghost
[43:32] you know and i know that there's a lot
[43:34] of wildfire right a lot of it maybe some
[43:36] of it may be carnal
[43:39] some of it may be fleshly
[43:42] some of it me you might say that's just
[43:44] plain parallel
[43:46] but what did brother bob say about it
[43:50] about fire a little wildfire he said i'd
[43:52] rather have a little wild or fire then
[43:55] no fire at all
[43:57] amen praise the lord now in this
[44:00] scenario that we're looking at with
[44:01] david we realized that the ark had been
[44:03] gone amen and it was a time for the ark
[44:05] to come now i know about you but if i'd
[44:07] have been part of israel i wouldn't want
[44:09] to have in any place except for where
[44:11] the ark is because we know that god's
[44:12] blowing that earth
[44:14] and so when god was coming back and it's
[44:16] just like a backslider almost you get
[44:18] away from god and you're all down you're
[44:20] all depressed you're all that's terrible
[44:22] when you greet the holy spirit when you
[44:24] get that holy spirit back
[44:26] it's a time of rejoicing and that's the
[44:28] way it kind of was with david it was a
[44:30] time of rejoicing and and
[44:32] he got beside himself almost folks begin
[44:35] to strip his clothes off and dance
[44:39] now i don't know how many other times
[44:40] not just to a whole lot of other times
[44:42] maybe you know i know miriam and them
[44:45] dance all these different places you
[44:46] know but not a whole lot of times that
[44:48] people get so carried away that they
[44:50] just go to dancing everywhere and david
[44:53] he was just a main fellow i think that
[44:56] that michelle must have thought that he
[44:57] was just a little crazy you acted like a
[44:59] fool
[45:02] huh
[45:05] so to speak
[45:08] that's just how you just act a little
[45:09] bit foolish but he didn't mind because
[45:11] he was for the lord
[45:15] and you know david had known that what
[45:16] it was like to be in a sheep's coat and
[45:18] a and a sheep herder way on the backside
[45:21] and he was the least among all of his
[45:23] brethren
[45:26] i think it was samuel that came to
[45:28] anoint somebody in their household amen
[45:31] and all the brothers passed by samuel
[45:33] and none of them were ordained
[45:37] and and samuel had to ask him hey heaven
[45:39] you got somebody else because i know god
[45:41] don't make a mistake he sent me to your
[45:43] house
[45:45] and he said he said one more he says oh
[45:47] yeah
[45:48] the little shyster
[45:50] you know the least one that little one
[45:52] in the family the offscaring of the
[45:53] family he's kind of the weird one
[45:58] always always you know just oh my he's
[46:01] got to have his own secret time in his
[46:03] own place always talking about
[46:05] god and all being spiritual and
[46:06] everything you know
[46:09] yeah he's on the back side and he said
[46:11] bring him on bring him up
[46:14] they brought him on in and sure enough
[46:15] the light flashed just right
[46:17] and he went over there and anointed him
[46:19] with oil
[46:20] he's going to be the next king of israel
[46:24] huh
[46:25] i chose him to be the next king of
[46:27] israel
[46:28] amen and later on way on later in his
[46:30] life you know he said you know god told
[46:32] him uh talking about david i took you
[46:35] from the sheep coke i've taken you from
[46:37] being a nobody and now i've made it you
[46:39] the king of all of my people
[46:42] david had something to praise god about
[46:46] when i got to thinking about if we would
[46:48] really think if you would really think
[46:50] about what you got to praise god about
[46:53] you would be a hot lot happier
[46:59] you know meditation is a good thing
[47:01] what goes through our mind
[47:04] is the atmosphere
[47:06] that we create around ourself
[47:09] wherever we are
[47:12] i hope you got that
[47:14] the things we think about the things we
[47:15] meditate on is what we become it's what
[47:19] we feed on
[47:21] amen i can think about uh
[47:24] losing my wife i can lose think about
[47:26] losing my kids i can lose i can drive
[47:29] down the road and i can think and just
[47:31] try to imagine what this would be like
[47:33] some of these things and it almost take
[47:35] me to tears
[47:37] huh just sheer meditation
[47:40] i believe that we need to have our
[47:41] meditation upon the lord
[47:44] amen but david he knew he remembered of
[47:47] where
[47:49] god had brought him from
[47:51] because how many knows every breath that
[47:53] you take is a gift from god
[48:00] and you only got so many
[48:02] oh when i think about how did god amen
[48:05] you know before i was raised born and
[48:07] raised up with ohio
[48:10] amish boy a little amish boy a horse and
[48:12] buggy little square haircut yeah that's
[48:13] right a two-year pastor is used to be a
[48:16] amish boy
[48:19] i don't know why they call them dumb
[48:20] amishmen but anyway there you are
[48:24] i was just a dumb amishman and ain't
[48:25] much better now but anyway
[48:29] praise god when you think about it
[48:31] you know i thought about i came from a
[48:33] family of 10 and
[48:35] 10 children and i think back and i think
[48:37] about where i come from and how my mom
[48:39] and dad the environment that i was and
[48:41] then i think of how that there was
[48:43] something on the inside that brought me
[48:45] to where i am
[48:46] today and that's what i'm so i'm so
[48:49] thankful you know because i believe the
[48:51] little boy or i believe i had a
[48:53] stillborn son that was born just before
[48:55] me
[48:56] and they had to give me like seven blood
[48:59] transfusions just to get me crank up i
[49:01] barely made it
[49:03] huh
[49:05] and so
[49:06] and i think about that now think about
[49:08] you know it was god that brought me to
[49:10] this world it was god that brought you
[49:13] out of another million people it could
[49:14] have been germinated in your mother's
[49:16] womb god picked you
[49:22] aren't you glad to be alive aren't you
[49:24] glad to be living
[49:26] i ain't hearing no david's around here
[49:28] come on folks it ought to be giving you
[49:30] something to dance about
[49:33] i am very happy tonight just to exist
[49:38] how many knows every singer that ain't
[49:40] got a hold of god and don't have eternal
[49:41] life they are someday gonna cease to
[49:44] exist but if you have eternal life
[49:46] you'll never cease to exist
[49:49] that don't excite you i don't know what
[49:51] will
[49:54] that don't give you a little joy to know
[49:56] that you have eternal life in your bosom
[49:59] god coming he took your whole life away
[50:01] the old thomas violet he's dead you're
[50:04] looking at a new man
[50:06] you're looking at a different person
[50:10] yeah that's why david acted like a fool
[50:16] and he didn't mind do it and in front of
[50:18] his army he didn't mind do it in front
[50:19] of his whole nation he danced before the
[50:22] lord
[50:24] i don't care how many had michael's
[50:26] attitude
[50:28] huh
[50:28] he didn't care when somebody dances in
[50:31] the lord he gets all happy the lord and
[50:32] acts stupid
[50:34] i don't really care it's for the lord
[50:36] like he said
[50:40] yes it's okay to act stupid for the lord
[50:56] so we're talking about
[50:58] dealing tonight
[51:00] with crazy
[51:02] crazy can somebody tell me something
[51:04] about crazy
[51:08] when i asked myself that question coming
[51:10] to church
[51:11] i said
[51:13] what have we got to say about crazy
[51:17] you know what came to my mind
[51:20] i wanted to ask you if you know if you
[51:21] have a good thought on crazy go ahead
[51:23] speak up i'll let you do it
[51:29] what's crazy
[51:38] crazy up on get going off on a limb
[51:40] somewhere he
[51:41] might phrase that
[51:43] right but the first thing i thought is
[51:45] yeah the whole world is crazy
[51:52] the whole world is crazy they have gone
[51:54] insane the prophet declared that they
[51:55] would someday go totally insane and
[51:57] that's what we're living in we're living
[51:58] in an insane institute
[52:04] i thought today welcome to sodom and
[52:07] gomorrah because
[52:09] that's
[52:10] the world the world is in the sodom and
[52:13] gomorrah condition
[52:18] used to be other countries but now it's
[52:20] us now it's us
[52:22] folks if we can't kill we're gonna riot
[52:24] if we can't kill babies
[52:27] that's insane
[52:30] all right you are insane you have lost
[52:32] your mind you are officially crazy
[52:36] amen
[52:39] amen and in the world's view
[52:43] you are crazy also
[52:46] a fool somebody that we call great he's
[52:48] crazy nothing but a fool
[52:50] he's nuts
[52:53] [Laughter]
[52:55] the whole world's nuts
[52:57] let me tell you something the whole
[52:59] world's fools
[53:00] believer and unbeliever
[53:04] everybody's a fool
[53:07] that's why i say i gotta make sure that
[53:09] we say this right because it can be a
[53:10] little hard to swallow i'm crazy
[53:17] that's right jesus called his own
[53:19] disciples fools
[53:23] after his resurrection tommy
[53:26] he come back and cleopas and his friends
[53:28] were walking on the road to emmaus and
[53:30] they were talking about the lord and and
[53:32] these different things and
[53:33] jesus come right out of the woodwork and
[53:35] he walked with him you know and he
[53:36] explained his gospel to him and he said
[53:39] oh
[53:40] fools
[53:43] oh fools and full of art they believe
[53:45] all that the prophets are spoken
[53:47] his own child's
[53:48] called fools
[53:52] amen
[53:54] jesus used it many times he used it on
[53:56] the pharisees
[53:57] and then he used his own his own
[53:59] disciples
[54:02] but abraham tells the story of in
[54:03] california one place he says he read a
[54:05] story of what a man was going down down
[54:07] the road picketing and he big old sign
[54:10] on this button on his back it said i am
[54:13] a fool for christ
[54:16] because that's what paul said he was
[54:18] we're fools for christ
[54:21] and he went walked on back and on the
[54:23] back it said who's fool are you
[54:27] because you're gonna serve somebody
[54:28] you're gonna be half one master it's
[54:30] gonna be god or he's gonna be the devil
[54:32] gonna be one or the other that's who
[54:34] you're gonna serve
[54:38] amen
[54:43] see
[54:44] they're full
[54:46] they're fools to us and we're fools to
[54:47] them
[54:48] the bible says in first corinthians 2
[54:51] and verse 14 but the natural man
[54:53] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[54:55] of god for they are foolishness to them
[54:59] unto him and neither can he know him
[55:01] because they are spiritually discerned
[55:04] amen
[55:06] so to us the world
[55:09] man we are fools to the world
[55:15] amen
[55:19] listen to brother brown
[55:20] he made the statement i can just
[55:22] remember
[55:23] halfway right he said god does some of
[55:25] the most ridiculous things
[55:30] god does some of the most ridiculous
[55:31] things
[55:32] he said he takes the foolish things he
[55:35] does some foolish some crazy stuff
[55:37] sometimes god does
[55:39] huh
[55:40] that's what i gather he and the bible
[55:42] declares the same thing
[55:45] that god will take the foolish things of
[55:47] this world
[55:49] to confound the wise
[55:53] amen
[55:54] faith be the god
[55:57] hallelujah
[56:00] do you know what you get saved by
[56:04] you get saved by foolishness
[56:11] i'm so glad i got a scripture up here
[56:13] because i got so many eyes on me
[56:17] what in the world are you talking about
[56:20] preacher
[56:24] all right
[56:25] for the preaching of the cross to them
[56:28] that perish is foolishness
[56:30] isn't that right
[56:32] but unto us which are saved it is the
[56:34] power of god
[56:36] the bible says that by foolishness god
[56:39] chose to save them that belief
[56:45] by the foolishness of preaching
[56:48] this here it's supposed to them it's
[56:51] foolishness
[56:53] but it's not to us
[56:56] it's the power of almighty god if you'll
[56:58] believe the preacher's foolishness you
[57:00] can get to heaven
[57:03] his foolish preaching
[57:06] if you'll believe
[57:09] isn't that right and my honor and i
[57:12] ain't got many hands but
[57:15] god chose by the foolishes of preaching
[57:17] to save them better lost
[57:21] praise god
[57:23] amen i wasn't going to get excited
[57:24] tonight i was just going to give you a
[57:26] good lesson here
[57:27] but the more i talk about this the
[57:29] better i feel
[57:37] i'll say like the prophet said you know
[57:39] i may be just a little crazy but leave
[57:41] me alone i like it this way
[57:43] i'm happy here
[57:47] if i'm crazy just leave me alone
[57:52] amen
[57:57] oh my
[57:58] i talked to a girl not long ago but her
[58:00] ma'am says up in oregon she belonged to
[58:02] another denomination i believe she was
[58:03] catholic
[58:04] and she says who's done people what's
[58:06] attending your party
[58:08] if uh they're the ones that is going to
[58:11] be in heaven then i wouldn't want to be
[58:12] there
[58:14] she was a reporter i believe
[58:16] talking to him
[58:17] and i said well you won't have to worry
[58:19] very much about that unless you change
[58:21] your attitude
[58:25] see
[58:26] you ain't got to worry much about that
[58:28] she says all that they're screaming and
[58:30] carrying on
[58:33] i mean that we could use a little more
[58:36] i'm you know if i don't get nothing else
[58:38] it costs tonight let me get this because
[58:41] that we need the more of those
[58:42] experiences like the prophet had that if
[58:45] you're mowing your yard you ought to
[58:46] stop that thing and pull it up in the
[58:48] park and you ought to have you as little
[58:50] rather jubilee sometimes just to run and
[58:53] fit because i could got it
[58:55] that's when there ain't nobody watching
[58:57] it's just you and the lord like brother
[58:59] bannon was out in the wilderness and he
[59:01] got to looking at that eagle he made it
[59:03] out at all he got the revelations of
[59:04] what it was all about he said i wasn't
[59:06] running around running around that tree
[59:08] just screaming in the hole in the top of
[59:10] my voice if anybody would ever heard me
[59:11] and he said there's a crazy man up there
[59:17] just like david
[59:19] he was a crazy man he went a little
[59:20] crazy
[59:22] but that's all right
[59:24] it's for the lord he's worthy of it
[59:28] i could see god up on the throne looking
[59:30] down at
[59:31] that's my boy right there
[59:37] even the new testimonies from testimony
[59:39] he says wants us have joy unspeakable
[59:42] and full of glory that's what god wants
[59:44] you not to have
[59:49] how many if i said if you don't
[59:51] that right now you need a trip to the
[59:53] altar how many would you have to come to

[1:03:47] danced under the spirit acting like
[1:03:49] somebody drunk
[1:03:50] you think you'll get the heaven under
[1:03:53] anything less than that
[1:03:55] when god's own mother so to speak early

[1:04:12] huh
[1:04:13] idiots crazy
[1:04:15] man people take all kinds of names on us
[1:04:17] but jesus said man be happy when they
[1:04:19] cast your name out as evil
[1:04:22] they called him beelzebub
[1:04:24] they didn't call him nothing nice
[1:04:27] they call him the chief of devils
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:32] and listen even paul said in the way
[1:04:34] that's called heresy that's crazy
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:40] oh some heresy crazy well we
[1:04:43] call that because the supernatural is so
[1:04:45] much different from the carnal things of
[1:04:47] the world till it makes people think
[1:04:49] that they're crazy
[1:04:51] paul said to gribba i'm not mad means
[1:04:54] crazy
[1:04:55] i'm not crazy you think i am but in a
[1:04:57] way that's called heresy so worshipped
[1:04:59] by the god of my father's that's the way
[1:05:01] i do it i like that
[1:05:04] but says i'd like to join hands with
[1:05:05] paul
[1:05:06] i'd like to be there on that day when he
[1:05:08] gets his robe of righteousness of christ
[1:05:10] when he's crowned hallelujah i want to
[1:05:12] have the same kind of robe on that he
[1:05:14] did
[1:05:15] and he was not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:05:18] christ amen
[1:05:21] praise be to god not ashamed of the
[1:05:23] gospel of christ
[1:05:25] in many different ways paul talked about
[1:05:26] how that
[1:05:28] in the way it's called harris he so
[1:05:29] worships he the god of his father
[1:05:32] now let's go back to paul again
[1:05:34] let's look at where this
[1:05:36] was where we started off with
[1:05:41] chapter 4 verse 10 we are fools
[1:05:44] for christ's sake
[1:05:48] all right now let me just uh
[1:05:54] make another statement and then i'll
[1:05:56] back it up with the scripture
[1:05:58] in order for you to really become a
[1:06:00] christian
[1:06:01] you have to become a fool
[1:06:04] all right
[1:06:06] if you think you're smart listen to this
[1:06:09] chapter 3 verse 18 let no man deceive
[1:06:11] himself if any man among you seems to be
[1:06:14] wise in this world let him become a fool
[1:06:20] huh let him become you think you're wise
[1:06:23] you think you know something
[1:06:25] you're gonna have to become a fool
[1:06:27] in other words
[1:06:29] fools don't know too much
[1:06:33] huh
[1:06:34] they're not considered very smart
[1:06:37] huh
[1:06:38] folks i don't know but i've lived long
[1:06:40] enough brother glenn to know i'm not
[1:06:42] smart
[1:06:44] no
[1:06:46] oh my
[1:06:48] i've done some other dumber things have
[1:06:49] you
[1:06:51] the only good in me is what christ is
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:57] the problem is people don't get simple
[1:06:59] enough they think they know something
[1:07:02] outside of this you don't know nothing
[1:07:05] you ain't even got a right to think
[1:07:06] anything outside of this word
[1:07:09] he that believeth is baptized shall be
[1:07:10] saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:07:12] damned come that way or don't come at
[1:07:13] all think better don't think at all
[1:07:16] everything christ said that's what you
[1:07:17] said amen how many believes that
[1:07:20] i want to repeat oh i want to have the
[1:07:23] mind of god let this mind be in you that
[1:07:25] was also in christ jesus
[1:07:27] become a fool hey man you've got to get
[1:07:29] stupid
[1:07:31] stupid in yourself
[1:07:33] stupid to think that you're smart you're
[1:07:35] not
[1:07:37] because if you think you're smart and
[1:07:38] maybe you are wise be your einstein
[1:07:40] maybe you're some of those great men
[1:07:42] but if they didn't ever come to god they
[1:07:44] weren't very smart
[1:07:46] stupidest thing anybody will ever do is
[1:07:48] not come to christ not accept what he
[1:07:50] did
[1:07:52] it'd be lost in the end
[1:07:54] huh
[1:07:55] that's true stupidity
[1:07:58] real wisdom
[1:07:59] is accepting what god has for you
[1:08:02] and become nothing we all understand
[1:08:04] what brother brahm said if you've got to
[1:08:05] become a nobody
[1:08:08] an absolute nobody
[1:08:10] praise be to god and never raise above
[1:08:12] that just like paul he was a smart true
[1:08:15] dude
[1:08:18] amen smart worldly wise
[1:08:21] but what did he say all those things
[1:08:23] that i learned and all the little things
[1:08:25] that i had
[1:08:25] [Applause]
[1:08:27] i wish i could remember the scriptures i
[1:08:28] call all things but dumb
[1:08:32] we all know what dung is
[1:08:35] hello we i can't laugh but bunch of dogs
[1:08:38] so that i may not know the power of his
[1:08:40] resurrection
[1:08:41] so that might know him everything in my
[1:08:43] past all my wisdom is not but that's it
[1:08:48] he became a fool he became a nobody
[1:08:51] that's what made him a great man of god
[1:08:55] if you ever want to be a great christian
[1:08:57] but you've got to become
[1:08:58] don't live your own life i like what i
[1:09:00] heard by the way i'm saying knowing that
[1:09:01] on on paul a prisoner a prisoner he says
[1:09:04] my achievements my ambitions i got man
[1:09:06] the only thing i have is i want to
[1:09:08] please him i'm going to do whatever he
[1:09:10] wants me to do
[1:09:12] that's my ambition that's my goal
[1:09:15] that's my dream just to be what god
[1:09:16] wants me to be
[1:09:21] that's right listen to that tape a
[1:09:23] prisoner
[1:09:24] a good tape
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:28] praise be to god
[1:09:32] all right
[1:09:37] let the man deceive him if you if you
[1:09:39] think he wise
[1:09:40] then become a fool for the wisdom of
[1:09:42] this world
[1:09:44] is foolishness with god
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:49] for it is written he taketh the wise in
[1:09:52] their own craftiness
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:55] and again the lord know the thoughts of
[1:09:57] the wise that they are
[1:09:59] vain
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:11] again
[1:10:14] for the preaching of the cross
[1:10:16] is to them that perish
[1:10:18] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[1:10:20] it is the power of god
[1:10:22] for it is written i will destroy the
[1:10:24] wisdom of the wise and i will bring to
[1:10:26] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[1:10:28] where is the wise and where is the
[1:10:30] scribe where is the disputer of the
[1:10:31] world
[1:10:32] it's going to dispute it
[1:10:36] oh as a minister of god i'd like to say
[1:10:39] who is going to dispute god's word
[1:10:44] no
[1:10:45] you can think you are but it'll never
[1:10:46] change it
[1:10:48] it'll never diminish it it'll never pass
[1:10:50] away
[1:10:51] it's not what you think it's what he
[1:10:53] said
[1:10:56] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[1:10:58] world by wisdom knew not
[1:11:01] god
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:04] for it pleased god by the foolishness of
[1:11:06] preaching to save them that believe
[1:11:10] for the jews require a sign and the
[1:11:12] greeks seek after wisdom but we preach
[1:11:13] christ crucified unto the jews of
[1:11:16] stumbling block and unto the greeks
[1:11:18] foolishness
[1:11:20] praise be to god
[1:11:22] you go to church ah that's so foolish no
[1:11:26] it's not
[1:11:27] but somebody's gonna think if you're a
[1:11:29] christian you're just stupid
[1:11:31] you wear those clothes you're just
[1:11:33] stupid

[1:11:48] don't never cower down
[1:11:49] to somebody knocking you for your
[1:11:51] christianity

[1:12:37] screaming and shouting and stuff and

[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:37] praise be to god
[1:17:40] the foolishness of god is wiser than men
[1:17:43] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[1:17:45] men for you see your calling brethren
[1:17:49] how that not very many wise men after
[1:17:52] the flesh not many mighty
[1:17:54] not many noble
[1:17:56] are you even called
[1:17:59] huh
[1:18:02] peter was one of them right couldn't
[1:18:04] even write his own name ignorant
[1:18:06] and unlearned they said
[1:18:09] never probably had any schooling
[1:18:12] but the bible says they took note
[1:18:15] that they had been with jesus
[1:18:17] they knew something about this guy
[1:18:19] he's not smart he's not wise but this
[1:18:20] guy's been with jesus
[1:18:22] huh
[1:18:24] how many knows god does call the noble
[1:18:27] god does call the wives
[1:18:30] because paul was a wise man and so was
[1:18:32] moses
[1:18:34] moses was supposed to be the next
[1:18:35] pharaoh of egypt
[1:18:37] he was going to be the head now you had
[1:18:39] the whole world
[1:18:40] he was
[1:18:41] power
[1:18:42] i mean those egyptians they were a
[1:18:43] superpower at the time
[1:18:45] there's a problem of god he could have
[1:18:47] had every physical pleasure that you
[1:18:50] could imagine
[1:18:52] for the rest of his days
[1:18:56] don't even try to imagine it
[1:18:57] a wine here whatever it is just whatever
[1:19:01] fleshly pleasures he could have he could
[1:19:03] have had it
[1:19:04] but then the bible says that he chose
[1:19:07] to suffer the afflictions of those
[1:19:09] slaves
[1:19:10] he crowned that be a son and not of god
[1:19:13] greater riches than all the treasures of
[1:19:16] egypt
[1:19:19] to us and to the world he was stupid
[1:19:22] not to us but to the world
[1:19:24] poisoned that them he gave up everything
[1:19:27] he lost
[1:19:28] everything over one egyptian
[1:19:32] huh he didn't like something in moses
[1:19:35] didn't like
[1:19:36] how that egyptian was treating
[1:19:38] his brothers
[1:19:40] and he went and killed the man and
[1:19:41] buried him in the sand
[1:19:43] thought he could cover it up but no he
[1:19:45] had major consequences
[1:19:47] and all right the word got out he had to
[1:19:50] run for his life and everything else on
[1:19:52] the backside of the desert became a
[1:19:54] desert dweller for 40 years
[1:19:56] god had to put him on the backside
[1:19:59] with a hot-headed woman for 40 years to
[1:20:01] get him to calm down
[1:20:06] huh
[1:20:08] it worked
[1:20:12] brother if you think that you know you
[1:20:14] can just tell your wife what to do when
[1:20:16] to learn how to do it let it raise up
[1:20:17] and say no
[1:20:19] huh there's gonna be some sparks fly
[1:20:21] it'll calm you down
[1:20:23] uh maybe i better go about it a little
[1:20:25] different
[1:20:26] and she was hot at it
[1:20:28] but anyway
[1:20:30] took that out of him and made him have
[1:20:32] an experience with god on the back side
[1:20:35] of the desert
[1:20:37] oh and then again god began to use a
[1:20:40] foolish old man
[1:20:43] as the prophet put it he says here comes
[1:20:44] an old man with his wife and a baby on
[1:20:47] her hips on a mule
[1:20:48] coming down to egypt to take over people
[1:20:52] will ask him along the way where are you
[1:20:53] going moses i'm going down to egypt to
[1:20:56] deliver this relax
[1:20:58] what where
[1:21:01] i don't see no army where moses is your
[1:21:03] army
[1:21:05] huh
[1:21:07] i'm gonna do it with this stick right
[1:21:08] here
[1:21:10] huh
[1:21:12] i'm gonna do with the stick come and
[1:21:14] watch
[1:21:15] right come and watch
[1:21:20] could have easily said
[1:21:22] you just can't see him but there's
[1:21:24] chariots and horses and you ain't never
[1:21:26] seen the likes of what behind me
[1:21:29] because you with god with one man and
[1:21:32] god you are an invincible army
[1:21:36] huh we learned that with david we
[1:21:37] learned that from
[1:21:38] moses
[1:21:40] we've got all things that are possible
[1:21:42] they're totally possible with god
[1:21:47] folks hang on to your seat aren't you
[1:21:49] glad to have god on your side
[1:21:51] if we don't say nothing else folks just
[1:21:53] to have god just to be in contact with
[1:21:54] god
[1:21:56] what man calls foolish their paul was he
[1:21:58] was going to be the next k ephesus he
[1:22:00] was he was going to be the high priest
[1:22:02] he's going to be the top dog so to speak
[1:22:05] he was jealously persecuting the
[1:22:07] christians
[1:22:08] and god struck him down
[1:22:11] brought him off of his heist horse and
[1:22:12] found out that he was really he was a
[1:22:14] lot dumber than what he thought he
[1:22:16] thought he was doing the right thing but
[1:22:17] god said you are persecuting me
[1:22:20] but he changed paul completely and he
[1:22:23] said i'm going to let you let me show
[1:22:24] you a lot of things that you're going to
[1:22:26] suffer
[1:22:28] oh my paul suffered and suffered
[1:22:33] until
[1:22:34] paul
[1:22:40] had nothing better to do
[1:22:42] called himself a fool
[1:22:45] if he's going to be a fool listen to
[1:22:46] what he says for i am become a fool
[1:22:50] in glorying
[1:22:52] in glory
[1:22:58] paul said one place i say again let no
[1:23:00] man think me a fool
[1:23:01] if otherwise yet as a fool receive me
[1:23:04] that i may boast myself a little bit
[1:23:05] here
[1:23:06] that i'm speak i speak
[1:23:08] i speak it
[1:23:09] not after the lord but as it were
[1:23:12] foolishly in this confidence of boasting
[1:23:14] seeing the many glory after the flesh i
[1:23:17] glory also
[1:23:19] but you suffer fools gladly seeing you
[1:23:21] yourselves are wise but for ye suffer if
[1:23:24] a man bring you into bondage if a man
[1:23:26] devour you if a man take you if a man
[1:23:27] exalts himself if man smites you on face
[1:23:30] i speak concerning reproach as though we
[1:23:32] had been weak i'll be it who's
[1:23:34] wheresoever and he is bold i speak
[1:23:37] foolishly i am bold also
[1:23:45] are the hebrews so am i are the
[1:23:47] israelites i so am i are you the seat of
[1:23:50] abraham so am i are they the ministers
[1:23:52] christ i speak as a fool
[1:23:54] i am mower
[1:23:57] in laborers
[1:23:59] boy paul work for it
[1:24:01] he suffered for it
[1:24:03] hardly anybody in that generation
[1:24:05] i i i believe i speak under the
[1:24:07] inspiration hardly anybody outside of
[1:24:09] christ suffered as much as paul did in
[1:24:11] that generation for the gospel
[1:24:14] huh
[1:24:17] in stripes above measure in prisons more
[1:24:20] more frequent in this often of the jews
[1:24:22] five times received i-40 stripes save
[1:24:25] one thrice was i beaten with rods
[1:24:28] once was i stoned thrice did i suffer
[1:24:31] shipwreck a night and a day in the deep
[1:24:34] in journeyings often in peril to the
[1:24:37] water and perils of robbers and perils
[1:24:39] of my own countrymen and perils by my by
[1:24:41] the heathen
[1:24:42] in pals in the city and perils in the
[1:24:44] wilderness
[1:24:46] snake bit
[1:24:48] huh
[1:24:50] paul had some rough
[1:24:52] days
[1:24:55] and he gloried in those
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:02] perils amongst false brethren in
[1:25:04] weirdness and painfulness
[1:25:06] in watchings often in hunger and
[1:25:08] thirsting fast things often and cold and
[1:25:11] nakedness
[1:25:13] praise be to god think about it god was
[1:25:15] so real and paul's heart and his life
[1:25:18] him and paul and silas were in the inner
[1:25:20] prison one time put in shackles and
[1:25:23] chains
[1:25:25] and in the
[1:25:26] night
[1:25:28] they were crazy
[1:25:30] what kind of a crazy man could sing
[1:25:32] under those conditions
[1:25:34] pray and praise god but paul could
[1:25:37] in the worst dark dungeon hole cold
[1:25:40] hungry
[1:25:42] nothing to his name no nothing to look
[1:25:45] forward in this world
[1:25:46] and begin to praise god
[1:25:51] he was so crazy
[1:25:53] that all he could do was brag about his
[1:25:55] infirmities
[1:25:59] that's what we would say about thomas
[1:26:01] bother if i come up to you but it's on
[1:26:02] all i was ever talking about man how my
[1:26:05] motor blowed up
[1:26:06] huh coming home and everything else
[1:26:09] broke down my tire blew up
[1:26:12] this happened and that happened
[1:26:15] huh
[1:26:17] praise be to god
[1:26:19] well done sonic folks that's what paul
[1:26:21] had he says i will glory in my
[1:26:23] infirmities if i'm in the glory
[1:26:25] i am a fool he says in glorying in my
[1:26:28] infirmities
[1:26:30] to the world it may be foolish but guess
[1:26:32] what he wasn't looking at his
[1:26:34] infirmities he was looking at the fact
[1:26:36] that it don't matter if he's in the
[1:26:37] dungeon of dungeon abductions he knows
[1:26:39] he's the son of god he knows he's going
[1:26:41] to live eternally he knows he's in god's
[1:26:43] care and god sent angels in there open
[1:26:46] up the prison doors unshackled him and
[1:26:48] set him free he had god to come down and
[1:26:51] set it free
[1:26:53] if we would be more inspired about the
[1:26:54] things of god you'll see more miracles
[1:26:56] happen you see more of the power of god
[1:26:58] around
[1:26:59] but the disciples they were so poor then
[1:27:01] they followed the poor man they follow
[1:27:03] the bagger they follow somebody that
[1:27:04] didn't have a dime to his name and no
[1:27:06] place to lay his head
[1:27:08] what a boss
[1:27:10] huh
[1:27:14] that right didn't even have a place to
[1:27:16] lay his head jesus did me
[1:27:18] but yet they followed him
[1:27:20] because eternal life is worse than him
[1:27:22] more than anything here out in this
[1:27:23] world remember that
[1:27:25] eternal life is worth more than anything
[1:27:27] in this world
[1:27:29] that is the number one top thing in your
[1:27:32] life and in mine
[1:27:34] meditate on it more think about it more
[1:27:37] pray about it more amen
[1:27:40] i love it
[1:27:43] i love it
[1:27:44] just little thoughts like that
[1:27:46] about david why do you have to be such a
[1:27:49] crazy man
[1:27:51] what makes you so crazy
[1:27:54] that your wife will tell you you're
[1:27:56] acting like a fool
[1:27:59] you act like one of the banging people
[1:28:02] i'll tell you why because i know
[1:28:04] what god has done in my life
[1:28:07] and he's coming back into my life
[1:28:11] oh my
[1:28:13] he's coming back into my life
[1:28:15] and i'm excited about it
[1:28:17] i'm going to dance before the lord
[1:28:20] i'm acting a little stupid for the lord
[1:28:22] but that's all right
[1:28:24] they can act stupid for their stuff
[1:28:27] how many knows and they do
[1:28:31] should i say what comes to mind
[1:28:34] they outdo us when it comes to stupid
[1:28:37] for their god
[1:28:41] they do
[1:28:43] i got amen and we all agree
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:48] a lot of us would say that's that's
[1:28:50] definitely me i haven't acted like some
[1:28:52] of them acted
[1:28:54] i think i never finished a story about
[1:28:56] the man that came and and a woman
[1:28:58] screamed in the back
[1:29:00] in the back and chills running over his
[1:29:02] back and after service he says how can
[1:29:03] you preach
[1:29:05] you know how can he preach but i think
[1:29:06] if i'm not wrong he was out there at a
[1:29:08] baseball game a little bit later and he
[1:29:10] got so excited
[1:29:12] he says he could get excited out there
[1:29:14] but he can't get excited in church
[1:29:17] come on folks
[1:29:22] this feels good to my toes brother glenn
[1:29:25] it feels good from the top of my head
[1:29:26] down to the feet this old tip of my toe
[1:29:30] i'm healed i am whole from the top of my
[1:29:33] head to the soul to the tip of my toe
[1:29:39] let me say sing it this way i am filled
[1:29:43] up
[1:29:44] from the top of my head to the soul to
[1:29:46] the tip of my toe
[1:29:48] filled up
[1:29:52] man this is good
[1:29:54] oh man
[1:29:55] i'm apologizing
[1:29:57] no
[1:29:58] god is good
[1:30:02] amen he's good we need more of god in
[1:30:05] this hour
[1:30:06] you better get more of god because that
[1:30:08] world is a strong pull
[1:30:10] he's got a strong pull and you better
[1:30:12] get over here where it's got a strong
[1:30:15] pull
[1:30:15] i mean you get a hold of it to overcome
[1:30:17] that that's
[1:30:19] a real elected child of god will have
[1:30:21] that
[1:30:23] it'll be indians to do it
[1:30:25] it'll be in here to do it it'll be your
[1:30:27] number one desire
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:34] cold and nakedness besides those things
[1:30:36] that are without that which cometh upon
[1:30:38] me daily the care of all the churches
[1:30:40] who is weak and i am not weak who is
[1:30:42] offended and i burn not
[1:30:44] if i needs to be crazy if i need the
[1:30:46] glory i will glory of the things which
[1:30:49] concern my infirmities
[1:30:52] amen
[1:30:54] praise be to god
[1:30:56] he was going to brag about how that god
[1:30:58] delivers him
[1:31:00] out of all of his troubles
[1:31:03] i can do oh my paul said later on he
[1:31:06] says i can do all things i know how to
[1:31:08] be a base i know how to be a hungry i
[1:31:10] know how to be full i know how to have
[1:31:11] it good and i know how to have it bad i
[1:31:14] can do all things through christ which
[1:31:16] strengthens me
[1:31:17] god help us to be able to say things i
[1:31:19] can go through bad times and praise god
[1:31:20] i can go through good times and praise
[1:31:22] god
[1:31:24] we need to get it into our membrane into
[1:31:26] our genetics that guess what when it's
[1:31:28] going bad you don't need to change
[1:31:31] you need to say the same person if not a
[1:31:33] little bit more for god in the hard
[1:31:35] times and the bad times
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:42] how many needs to go to the ultra on
[1:31:43] that one
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:49] that's right that's right be honest
[1:31:53] not all that's easier said than done
[1:31:59] praise the lord
[1:32:02] oh my
[1:32:06] i heard a politician this week saying
[1:32:08] we are sincerely going to take care of
[1:32:10] this problem
[1:32:13] now i'm like
[1:32:14] the only part of any sincerity that's
[1:32:16] ever going to take effect is this word
[1:32:18] sincere that just came out of your mouth
[1:32:20] that's that's it as far as it goes
[1:32:25] because actions speak louder than words
[1:32:26] and reactions absolutely not there
[1:32:29] the only sincere thing is that word that
[1:32:32] you spoke that's it
[1:32:37] sorry i gotta get out of politics man
[1:32:41] it's bad out there
[1:32:43] but it's the truth isn't it
[1:32:46] oh my isn't it sad we're living in a
[1:32:48] world if somebody says something you
[1:32:50] better believe it it's just the other
[1:32:52] way around
[1:32:53] because if you ain't you're in for a
[1:32:54] shock
[1:32:56] you're in for a rude awakening
[1:32:58] but it's not so with him
[1:33:01] when he says something you can hang your
[1:33:03] soul on it every last word of god that
[1:33:06] he speaks amen
[1:33:10] praise be to god that's right
[1:33:14] if i will glory of the things which
[1:33:15] concern my infirmities
[1:33:18] listen
[1:33:18] then chapter 12 and verse 4 says of such
[1:33:21] a one one that was caught up in the
[1:33:22] glory of such a one will i glory yet of
[1:33:24] myself i will not glory but in mine
[1:33:27] informities for though i would desire to
[1:33:30] glory i shall not be a fool
[1:33:32] for i will say the truth but now i
[1:33:35] at least any man should think of me
[1:33:36] above that which he seeth me to be
[1:33:39] or that which he hears of me
[1:33:41] at least i should be exalted above
[1:33:43] measure
[1:33:44] through the abundance of the revelations
[1:33:46] that god gives me
[1:33:48] that was given unto me a thorn in the
[1:33:50] flesh
[1:33:52] but bam says it was probably his eyes
[1:33:55] he couldn't read and he had to write
[1:33:57] large letters
[1:33:59] right
[1:34:00] a messenger of satan to buffet me at
[1:34:02] least i should be exalted above measure
[1:34:07] for this thing i besought the lord three
[1:34:09] times
[1:34:11] that it might depart from me
[1:34:13] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:34:15] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:34:17] made perfect in weakness
[1:34:21] imagine the lord paul eating this
[1:34:23] healing he needed this healing real bad
[1:34:25] they asked him for that god god's in
[1:34:27] there
[1:34:29] i can use that weakness you got
[1:34:31] that weakness
[1:34:32] is where i'm using my strength
[1:34:35] huh
[1:34:37] that's where my strength comes from
[1:34:38] that's how i live my life through you is
[1:34:40] that weakness
[1:34:42] you may just
[1:34:43] because god knew exactly he may just get
[1:34:45] a little higher than what he should have
[1:34:47] been
[1:34:49] my grace is sufficient for me my
[1:34:51] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:34:52] most gladly therefore
[1:34:54] i will rather glory in mine infirmities
[1:34:58] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:35:01] me
[1:35:03] praise be to god
[1:35:07] let me tell you something we in this
[1:35:09] generation evening like tabernacle you
[1:35:11] have got to be careful because we have
[1:35:13] got it so
[1:35:14] nice
[1:35:17] huh
[1:35:19] so nice i think it was david said you
[1:35:20] know even though the everything is like
[1:35:22] it is most of us have it pretty good
[1:35:25] we still have it better than most people
[1:35:27] huh
[1:35:28] we're still in america we still enjoy
[1:35:30] this country huh
[1:35:34] and if you aren't careful it'll make you
[1:35:37] soft spiritually
[1:35:41] i was thinking about this match and i
[1:35:42] thought about how that sometimes
[1:35:44] blessings become a curse
[1:35:47] having it too nice and having zion at
[1:35:49] ease
[1:35:50] a lot of the time she gets lazy and
[1:35:52] sleepy
[1:35:53] israel remember they got blessed they
[1:35:54] were in a waste howling wilderness
[1:35:56] bleeding and so forth god picked up and
[1:35:58] they were nothing but when they got
[1:35:59] plenty they got fat
[1:36:02] and they forgot god
[1:36:04] they turned to other things
[1:36:06] we have to be careful in this generation
[1:36:08] that all these little gizmos these all
[1:36:10] these things
[1:36:12] don't zap the life of god out of us
[1:36:16] the sweetness of the holy spirit
[1:36:19] amen
[1:36:21] praise be to god
[1:36:28] that power of christ may rest upon me
[1:36:31] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:36:34] in reproaches
[1:36:35] in necessities in persecutions
[1:36:39] pleasure
[1:36:41] wow paul
[1:36:47] let me not finish but jump back for just
[1:36:49] a minute if i can if i can find this
[1:36:56] he said
[1:36:58] we are fools for christ's sakes and you
[1:37:00] are wise in christ we are weak we are
[1:37:02] strong we are honorable
[1:37:04] we are despised even at this present
[1:37:07] hour we both hunger and thirst and are
[1:37:09] naked buffeted
[1:37:11] our naked buffett and have no certain
[1:37:13] dwelling place
[1:37:15] wow
[1:37:16] labor working with our hands being
[1:37:18] reviled we bless being persecuted we
[1:37:20] suffer it being defamed we entreat
[1:37:23] we are made as the filth of the world
[1:37:26] called a bunch of holy rotors fanatics
[1:37:29] crazy
[1:37:31] huh
[1:37:33] the all-scouring of the world whereas of
[1:37:35] the off-scoring of all things unto this
[1:37:37] day and then i chap
[1:37:39] i go through about three three
[1:37:41] scriptures three quotes there he says
[1:37:43] wherefore i beseech you be followers of
[1:37:46] me
[1:37:49] be followers of me in the midst of all
[1:37:51] of that
[1:37:52] take pleasure in your infirmities
[1:37:55] how many of us could say that when
[1:37:56] something really goes south for us
[1:37:59] we say lord
[1:38:00] jesus this is a good time for you to
[1:38:03] come on the scene
[1:38:04] i know you can handle this lord praise
[1:38:07] be to god
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:12] let's be like paul
[1:38:14] let's
[1:38:15] in closing let me just finish this
[1:38:16] scripture
[1:38:18] i take therefore pleasure in infirmities
[1:38:20] reproaches necessities and persecutions
[1:38:22] distresses for christ's sake i like that
[1:38:24] for christ's sake for when i am weak
[1:38:26] then am i strong and i am become a fool
[1:38:29] in glory
[1:38:30] and ye have compelled me for i ought to
[1:38:33] have been commended of you
[1:38:34] for nothing i am behind in the very
[1:38:37] chiefest apostle though
[1:38:39] i be
[1:38:41] nothing
[1:38:43] paul never thought of himself as
[1:38:44] anything
[1:38:46] but yet he knew as far as it really came
[1:38:47] down to it he was to one of the chief
[1:38:50] apostles
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:55] my closing thought is this no matter
[1:38:57] if you're in the darkness dungeon of
[1:38:59] where it might be remember
[1:39:01] the greatest thing that we have
[1:39:03] is to have a lord
[1:39:05] just to have the lord
[1:39:07] you ought to give us joy unspeakable and
[1:39:09] full of glory
[1:39:12] keep a loose hand on the things of this
[1:39:14] world because we're not going to stay
[1:39:15] here much longer
[1:39:17] i know about you but i'm looking for the
[1:39:19] rapture to take place i'm looking to get
[1:39:22] out of here
[1:39:24] any
[1:39:25] time that rapture can happen anytime
[1:39:28] going down to clarksville today seeing
[1:39:30] the big old all of that huge building
[1:39:32] and factories going up on the left side
[1:39:34] you know went up to indiana they're
[1:39:36] building big factories and everything
[1:39:38] else and this economy they're building
[1:39:39] big factories and everything building
[1:39:41] houses everywhere
[1:39:45] and i thought about it
[1:39:46] and i thought what the scripture says
[1:39:48] you know
[1:39:49] in the days of noah they built it they
[1:39:51] did that they did all married they gave
[1:39:53] him they were doing all of that until
[1:39:55] the day the rain came
[1:39:56] that's the way it's going to be
[1:39:58] the rapture takes place people are still
[1:40:00] going to be busy building this and
[1:40:02] building that and having their
[1:40:03] achievements and everything else but
[1:40:05] god's going to come and take
[1:40:07] us home
[1:40:09] that's what i'm not looking to build
[1:40:11] this evening thank you for
[1:40:13] being such a wonderful
[1:40:15] easy crowd to preach to amen
