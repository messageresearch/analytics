[41:32] in Colossians 3 and verse 17.
[41:48] and whatsoever he'd do in word or deed
[41:50] do all things in the name of what Jesus
[41:52] Christ giving thanks to God and the
[41:55] father by him
[42:02] and and then I got one more uh First
[42:05] Corinthians 10 and verse 31.
[42:10] foreign
[42:20] eat or drink or what whatsoever you do
[42:23] do all for the glory of God
[42:26] amen may God ask blessing to read
[42:27] another word you can be seated
[42:31] now I would like to read what brother
[42:33] Branham said on this this is is it sums
[42:36] up the entire message that I'm preaching
[42:38] tonight I'm preaching on on this uh
[42:41] quote by brother Brandon
[42:44] it says God is not an idol God is a
[42:47] spirit and we we prostrate ourselves
[42:50] before that in the spirit don't don't
[42:52] come unto some Idol son as some
[42:55] so-called Christians would have us to
[42:57] believe but the spirit comes into you
[42:59] and you are God's house living oracles
[43:02] walking around not manifesting the
[43:05] Living God for God to Wells not in
[43:08] temples made with hands
[43:11] but a body has stopped preparing me see
[43:14] you are God's letter a written epistle
[43:18] God is in you manifesting himself
[43:20] through if you could prostrate your
[43:23] yourself before God and say God I'm a
[43:25] sinner come into me and then the Holy
[43:27] Spirit comes in and then you are a
[43:29] living representative of God
[43:33] did you catch it say that with me living
[43:36] representative of God walking around
[43:39] with God speaking through your lips to
[43:43] others
[43:48] let's take a look at what's the
[43:50] definition of Representative a person
[43:53] chosen or appointed to act or speak for
[43:56] another or others
[44:01] if if you could just grasp that for a
[44:03] second think of that God chose us and
[44:07] God chose you before the foundation of
[44:09] the world to represent him
[44:13] now I would I have a story I would like
[44:15] to read in
[44:17] um this is It's I don't think it's a
[44:19] true story but
[44:21] it's it's
[44:22] um
[44:23] it's a it's a story of what I'm trying
[44:26] to speak on tonight once upon a time
[44:28] there was a young woman named Rachel who
[44:31] was a devout Christian she believed in
[44:33] the power of prayer and had a deep
[44:35] desire to share the love of God with
[44:36] those around her
[44:37] one day Rachel was walking through a
[44:40] crowded Street in the city when she saw
[44:42] an older when an older man sitting on a
[44:45] bench looking lost and confused Rachel
[44:49] felt
[44:50] a nudge in in her heart and and she knew
[44:54] that God was calling her to speak to the
[44:56] man she she approached the man and
[44:58] greeted him warmly as they began to talk
[45:00] Rachel about the Holy Spirit speaking
[45:02] through her guiding her words giving her
[45:05] the right things to say the man shared
[45:08] and that he had recently lost his wife
[45:10] and was struggling to find meaning in
[45:13] life Rachel listened with compassion and
[45:17] then and then she she began to share the
[45:19] good news of Jesus Christ she spoke of
[45:22] God's love and grace and how he could he
[45:25] could give the man a comfort and peace
[45:27] that he was seeking as Rachel spoke the
[45:30] man's face lit up and he began to weep
[45:32] tears of joy
[45:36] he told her that her words had touched
[45:39] his heart and that he felt like God was
[45:41] speaking directly to him through her
[45:43] from that day forward Rachel knew that
[45:46] she was a living representative of God
[45:48] walking around with God speaking through
[45:50] her lips to others she felt a deep sense
[45:53] of purpose and joy and she shared the
[45:55] love of God with everyone she met over
[45:58] time Rachel became known in her
[46:00] committee as a woman of faith and many
[46:03] people came to her for guidance and
[46:05] prayer she she continued to allow God to
[46:07] speak through her and she saw many lives
[46:09] transformed by the power of his love
[46:12] Rachel's story is a powerful reminder
[46:15] that we are all living representatives
[46:17] of God and that he can use us to touch
[46:20] the heart of others when we allow the
[46:22] holy spirit to guide our words and
[46:24] actions we become vessels of God's love
[46:27] and grace and we can make a real
[46:29] difference in the lives of those around
[46:31] us
[46:33] amen amen
[46:35] some some of us think that it's only
[46:38] it's only preachers that God uses to
[46:40] speak through us but it you anyone can
[46:43] witness to those around you it just just
[46:45] as this woman had done and and you think
[46:48] that it's it's not just a preacher that
[46:51] God can use to speak to someone else God
[46:53] can use anyone uh even even a child God
[46:57] God can use don't don't limit God by
[47:00] saying only I'm not saying of course I'm
[47:03] not saying a woman can can preach In a
[47:05] Pulpit but I'm saying that that even and
[47:08] a woman can can speak a power p and
[47:12] speak love speak awake what God wants
[47:15] them to say to someone else to
[47:17] to show them and God's love and touch
[47:20] their hearts and and God can use them to
[47:23] do that just as this example I had shown
[47:25] you
[47:27] when we receive the Holy Spirit we
[47:29] become vessels for God's message walking
[47:32] around with God speaking through our
[47:33] lips to others with his great with with
[47:36] it
[47:38] this is a great privilege and
[47:40] responsibility and it is something that
[47:43] we should never take for
[47:45] granted and we see examples of this
[47:48] throughout the Bible in in the book of
[47:49] Acts we read about how the disciples
[47:51] receive the Holy Experience at Pentecost
[47:53] suddenly they were empowered to speak in
[47:55] different languages to proclaim the
[47:57] gospel message to people from all over
[48:00] the world they were no longer just
[48:02] ordinary men but living representatives
[48:04] of God filled with the power of the Holy
[48:06] Spirit
[48:07] and acts for me and we see Peter and
[48:09] John being brought before the religious
[48:10] leaders for for preaching about Jesus
[48:14] despite the threat of persecution they
[48:16] boldly proclaim the truth and the power
[48:18] of the Holy Spirit was with them they
[48:20] said for we cannot help speaking about
[48:22] what we have seen and heard
[48:27] after the the death and resurrections of
[48:29] Jesus
[48:32] disciples were filled with the Holy
[48:33] Ghost and began preaching the gospel
[48:35] with boldness and power Peter and John
[48:38] were two of the most prominent Apostles
[48:40] they had performed many signs and
[48:42] wonders in the name of Jesus in Acts 3
[48:44] we read about
[48:46] um miraculous healing that took place
[48:48] though Peter and John they encountered a
[48:50] lame man who had been sitting at the
[48:52] temple gate for many years begging for
[48:54] alms Peter and John did not have any
[48:56] money to get a given but there's
[48:58] something much more powerful the name of
[49:00] Jesus Peter said to the man silver and
[49:02] gold hadn't done have I not but what I
[49:05] do have that I give you in the name of
[49:08] Jesus Christ of Nazareth walk and the
[49:11] man was healed instantly walking leaping
[49:13] and praising in God amen if God doesn't
[49:16] show oh oh the the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:19] represented in and man I don't know what
[49:22] does the mirror the miraculous healing
[49:24] was a powerful death demonstration
[49:27] and the holy spirit's power and the work
[49:30] of the lives of Peter and John they were
[49:31] living representatives of God walking
[49:33] around with God speaking to the lips to
[49:35] others and and they were feeling they
[49:37] were filled with the Holy Spirit and as
[49:39] a result they were able to perform
[49:40] Miracles and share the gospel with
[49:42] boldness and Power
[49:44] my brothers and sisters we can we can
[49:46] too be filled with the Holy Spirit
[49:48] become living representatives of God we
[49:50] too can walk around with God not
[49:54] speaking through our lips to others but
[49:56] it requires a surrender of ourselves to
[49:58] God and a willingness to be filled with
[50:00] his spirit
[50:02] when we are filled with the Holy Spirit
[50:03] we become new creatures in Christ we are
[50:05] empowered to live a life of Holiness and
[50:07] obedience that we are able to share the
[50:10] love of Christ with others in powerful
[50:12] ways we become instruments of God's
[50:14] grace and mercy we are able to perform
[50:16] Miracles and signs that point to the
[50:19] glory of God
[50:20] so let us follow the example of Peter
[50:22] and John and be filled with the holy
[50:24] spirit let us surrender ourselves to God
[50:26] and allow him to use us as living
[50:28] representatives of his love and Power
[50:31] and let us boldly proclaim the gospel to
[50:34] a world that desperately needs to hear
[50:35] the message of Salvation and Hope
[50:39] Matthew 5
[50:41] 14 and into 16 says
[50:45] excuse me ye are the light of the world
[50:47] a city that is set on on a hill cannot
[50:52] be and be hit neither do men light a
[50:55] candle but put it and put it under a bus
[50:59] shell but on a Candlestick and it giveth
[51:01] light into unto all that are in the
[51:04] house let let uh let your light
[51:08] so shine before men that they may see
[51:11] good work your good works and glorify
[51:13] your father which is in heaven
[51:16] amen I I hear if if um so many people
[51:19] they say they look at at us Christians
[51:23] and they say they look at the whole
[51:24] Christian Church in general they're not
[51:27] denominations and so forth they look at
[51:28] us and they say
[51:30] well this isn't what Christ is like this
[51:33] isn't what Christ looks like they look
[51:36] at us and think what a bunch
[51:40] where's that apart from the rest of the
[51:42] Christian in the world but they look at
[51:45] them and say what a bunch of Hypocrites
[51:47] they say that they're they're following
[51:49] Christ but yet look at everything that
[51:50] they're doing
[51:51] I I heard a a
[51:55] um a uh an example that someone had had
[51:58] was talking about that
[52:01] that it's like going into the gym and
[52:05] and looking at all the overweight people
[52:07] all the people that this is a place of
[52:09] fitness and everyone's supposed to be
[52:11] super fit everyone's supposed to be all
[52:13] muscular and everything look at all
[52:14] these overweight people going in
[52:17] it's the same same thing they're a bunch
[52:20] of Hypocrites and then you look at they
[52:23] take you the same way with church they
[52:25] see a bunch of people that are coming to
[52:28] church that that are are so flawed
[52:30] they're so that are just completely
[52:33] different from the example of Christ and
[52:35] and our Hypocrites are in the church and
[52:38] they look at them and they say this
[52:40] isn't what what it's supposed to be and
[52:42] and there's there's certain people just
[52:44] like at the the gym that were that are
[52:46] that actually are fit that actually our
[52:49] arm our muscular and uh and
[52:52] and in church and Earth you also find in
[52:55] it the same the same way you find people
[52:58] that are standing on God's word that are
[53:00] aren't truly devout Christians and then
[53:03] you see the ones that are hypocrites
[53:04] that come in because that's how it is
[53:07] but
[53:08] it says here and ye are the light of the
[53:11] world as a city that is set on a hill
[53:15] that cannot be hit and and this is what
[53:17] brother panel is speaking and we tonight
[53:21] ought to be ashamed of ourselves and
[53:23] honestly and humble humbly confess our
[53:26] uh unbelief before God and ask him to
[53:28] forgive us of how we represent him in
[53:30] this life he's depending on us
[53:33] that's exactly what I would uh it goes
[53:36] along with with what I was saying
[53:39] we we're not perfect and you'll see
[53:42] flaws in each and every one of us none
[53:43] of us are actually going to be the full
[53:45] full uh perfect representation of Christ
[53:47] like we want to be like we desire to be
[53:51] but but still
[53:53] God has chosen us to be representatives
[53:56] of him in this life this is what it
[53:59] means to be a living representative God
[54:01] it means to be so filled with the holy
[54:03] spirit that you cannot help but speak
[54:06] about the things of God and it means
[54:07] being a vessel for God's message and
[54:10] allowing him to speak through you to
[54:12] others
[54:15] it's not it's not just about being
[54:17] perfect in the incumbent and so Godly
[54:20] that you never fall that you never make
[54:22] a mistake because we're human beings God
[54:24] made us to be human beings and we've
[54:26] Fallen we fail all the time but the
[54:28] difference between us and the people
[54:30] that
[54:30] the difference between us and and the
[54:34] Christians that fall by the wayside and
[54:35] and and give up is we keep on going we
[54:38] get back up again and we we say a devil
[54:41] you may have caused me to fall but I'm
[54:43] gonna bounce right back up again and
[54:44] that's what the devil hates to see
[54:45] because he wants to see you down he
[54:47] wants to see you thinking I made all
[54:50] these mistakes I made all the I've done
[54:52] all these things
[54:55] and and Satan and puts those things in
[54:58] your mind of the past and so forth
[55:00] bringing back over and over again you've
[55:01] done it yes you've done that look at you
[55:04] that's what Satan's job is the Bible
[55:06] says that that Satan's up there accusing
[55:09] us look at what they've done look at
[55:10] this look at that picking apart
[55:12] everything and they're not perfect
[55:13] they're not perfect representative you
[55:15] chose them to be a representative of you
[55:17] look at him look at at her there they
[55:20] they fed they fell the other day they
[55:22] they sin the other day
[55:24] and and
[55:27] then and she says I'll say
[55:31] I don't remember
[55:32] oh my
[55:37] God we might remember but Jesus doesn't
[55:39] remember because it started the blood
[55:40] and that's how we it must be striving
[55:43] every day today to be perfect and
[55:44] putting those things to this forgiving
[55:46] ourselves for the past mistakes that
[55:48] we've made
[55:49] that's the hardest thing to do as a
[55:52] Christian I'll tell you
[55:54] you because because those past things
[55:56] the the things that you've done will try
[55:59] to creep back up over and over again
[56:02] okay I'll keep on trying to come come
[56:04] back up again this past thing you've
[56:06] done because that's the devil's job the
[56:08] devil cannot
[56:10] the devil cannot destroy us the devil
[56:13] cannot uh
[56:17] blah our name out of the book of life
[56:20] you cannot do it and the the devil's job
[56:23] is it is not to get you you keep you
[56:28] from going to heaven but to discourage
[56:29] you but to to discourage you from
[56:32] sharing the gospel to discourage you
[56:34] from being a light in this world to
[56:36] discourage you from being represented
[56:38] for Christ to try to put you down to try
[56:41] to tell you your uh
[56:43] uh remind you of the mistakes you made
[56:45] and how that you'll never be become a
[56:48] perfect representative of Jesus Christ
[56:49] that's what the devil is trying to do
[56:52] that's his only time he cannot he cannot
[56:55] pluck you from his hand he cannot pluck
[56:58] you
[56:59] I used to think that that if I if I fell
[57:03] back and said that then my name would
[57:06] get blotted out of the The Book of Life
[57:08] and then I wouldn't want many more about
[57:10] that cannot happen
[57:12] even if I decided to walk out out of the
[57:14] door right now and then decide I ca I'm
[57:17] I can't do this anymore and give up and
[57:19] go out into the world God's Gonna reach
[57:21] down pull me back and say no you don't
[57:24] you're one of mine you can't do that
[57:27] because why
[57:29] God shows us before the foundation of
[57:32] the world
[57:33] God chose us to be representatives of
[57:36] him we're Sons and Daughters of God well
[57:38] when I see people that I know that that
[57:41] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:43] and when I see people that I know were
[57:45] saved
[57:47] follow me and go on to the world I I
[57:50] believe and trust that God's gonna pull
[57:52] them back one of these days and I I know
[57:54] it's going to happen if there are chosen
[57:57] of God it's got to happen because
[58:00] because there's only two scenes to
[58:01] serpent seed and you're either
[58:04] God or you're not and and
[58:07] so if they're of God they're going to
[58:08] come back and and that's just being lost
[58:10] and one of God's sheep wandering off and
[58:14] and
[58:15] and getting lost somewhere but but
[58:17] that's when Jesus will go down and and
[58:19] find that lost sheep leave them 99 and
[58:22] go find out
[58:23] I won that's lost
[58:28] we also see see this in in the life of
[58:33] Paul in his letters to the Corinthians
[58:35] Paul writes about the power of the holy
[58:38] spirit in his own life he says my
[58:40] message and my preaching were not with
[58:43] with wise and persuasive words but with
[58:47] a demonstration of his spirit's power so
[58:50] that your faith might not not rest in
[58:54] human wisdom but on on on God's power
[58:58] Paul understood that it was not his own
[59:01] wisdom or Echo eloquence
[59:06] that made his message powerful it was
[59:10] the power of the Holy Spirit working
[59:12] through him when he preached the gospel
[59:14] people were not just hearing his words
[59:16] they were hearing God's words spoken
[59:19] through him and as a result many people
[59:22] came to it to Faith in Jesus Christ amen
[59:25] it takes God to speak through you to
[59:27] speak to other people not just you
[59:29] speaking that's what that's the way that
[59:32] people come to crisis God using you as a
[59:34] vessel to speak to those those in need
[59:37] of him in the in need of in need of
[59:40] Jesus Christ God will use you to bring
[59:44] them here or sometimes it it it takes
[59:50] you know it'll it'll be God's using you
[59:54] to speak to other one to encourage
[59:56] someone to to lift someone up
[59:59] but the the power of the holy spirit in
[1:00:01] Paul's life was not limited to his
[1:00:03] preaching the Holy Spirit also empowered
[1:00:05] him to live a life of faith and
[1:00:08] obedience to God despite the many
[1:00:10] challenges he faced including
[1:00:11] persecution imprisonment and even
[1:00:13] Shipwrecked Paul remains steadfast in
[1:00:16] his faith he knew that the Holy Spirit
[1:00:19] was with him guiding him and
[1:00:21] strengthening him every step of the way
[1:00:23] amen God is with you tonight saying
[1:00:26] speaking Inc
[1:00:28] through you God is speaking to you he's
[1:00:30] using you
[1:00:33] fill up with the Holy Ghost tonight God
[1:00:35] has been using you who left up to this
[1:00:37] point if you ever felt at some point
[1:00:39] that God has told you to speak to
[1:00:41] someone that God has told you to to do
[1:00:45] this or do that and you're filled with
[1:00:46] the Holy Ghost God has been using you've
[1:00:48] been speaking through you don't ever
[1:00:50] think it's just yourself that it's just
[1:00:52] you doing it because God is using us as
[1:00:54] representatives of him
[1:00:56] thank you
[1:01:00] in fact Paul were all writes that the
[1:01:02] Holy Spirit not only gave him strength
[1:01:05] but also gave him the words to pray when
[1:01:08] he did and did not know what what to say
[1:01:10] he says in the same way the spirit helps
[1:01:12] us in our weakness we do not know well
[1:01:15] what we ought to pray for but the spirit
[1:01:17] himself intercedes for us through
[1:01:20] through
[1:01:24] it says here enters his Forest through
[1:01:26] wordless groans
[1:01:28] so sometimes aims even and when you just
[1:01:33] just meditating on God and you're just
[1:01:35] praying in your mind God is as pouring
[1:01:38] ain't things into your mind to pray
[1:01:41] because God can even hear your thoughts
[1:01:43] so when you're praying to yourself and
[1:01:45] you're you're just thinking
[1:01:49] you're just praying and you just feel
[1:01:51] feel the Holy Spirit the presence of the
[1:01:53] Lord
[1:01:54] laughs
[1:01:55] that's the Lord speaking into you that's
[1:01:58] the Lord's air telling you what to pray
[1:02:00] what to speak what what to think the the
[1:02:04] the same holy spirit that worked through
[1:02:06] Paul is available to us today when we
[1:02:09] receive the Holy Spirit we too become
[1:02:11] living representatives of God become
[1:02:13] vessels through which God can speak to
[1:02:16] others and work through us to accomplish
[1:02:17] his purposes
[1:02:19] so let us open our hearts and Minds to
[1:02:22] the holy spirit let us invite him to
[1:02:25] work in through and through US
[1:02:27] empowering us to be faithful and
[1:02:28] obedient to God let us allow him to
[1:02:30] speak through us to others so that they
[1:02:34] too may come in faith in in Jesus Christ
[1:02:37] and let us trust that the the same Holy
[1:02:40] Spirit who worked through Paul is at
[1:02:42] work in us today guiding us and
[1:02:44] strengthening us every step of the way
[1:02:46] when we receive the Holy Spirit we are
[1:02:49] no longer living for ourselves but for
[1:02:52] Christ who lives in us we become living
[1:02:54] representatives of God with the power of
[1:02:56] the Holy Spirit within us
[1:02:59] let's never forget the privilege and
[1:03:01] responsibility that comes with the
[1:03:03] living representative of God let us be
[1:03:05] filled with all a experience said so
[1:03:09] that we can be vessels for God's message
[1:03:11] let us speak boldly and courageously
[1:03:14] about the things of God knowing that the
[1:03:18] power of the holy spirit is with us
[1:03:22] says this therefore I think even
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:28] has failed to represent the real thing
[1:03:31] that Christ has set forth for us to
[1:03:34] represent the Holy Spirit and the life
[1:03:36] of the spirit see we represent sometimes
[1:03:40] Sensations and we represent Joy but in
[1:03:43] and that's good but there is
[1:03:46] there's more to it than that there is a
[1:03:49] fruit that goes with it that the hungry
[1:03:51] man is looking for aim for this fruit of
[1:03:53] the spirit and this is the quality that
[1:03:55] was in Jesus
[1:03:59] amen as Christians we believe that we
[1:04:01] are called to be the hands and feet of
[1:04:03] Jesus and to share his message of love
[1:04:05] and salvation with the world
[1:04:08] well the most powerful ways we can do
[1:04:10] this is by allowing God to speak through
[1:04:12] us to those around us when we speak
[1:04:15] words of encouragement Comfort or Our
[1:04:17] Truth we are not just speaking on our
[1:04:19] own behalf we are speaking on
[1:04:22] behalf of God he is using our voices to
[1:04:26] speak to the lives of others
[1:04:29] to offer them hope and healing and to
[1:04:32] draw them closer to him
[1:04:35] that is a purpose of our Our Lives is uh
[1:04:39] to allow ourselves to be vessels of him
[1:04:42] to allow him to speak through us and in
[1:04:45] us the the
[1:04:47] that's what we are called to do that is
[1:04:49] our calling if you're looking for
[1:04:51] foreign
[1:04:53] that's a good start right there uh just
[1:04:56] allow God to speak through you
[1:04:59] to others allow God to speak
[1:05:03] through you it's not it's not just me as
[1:05:05] a preacher that's the most challenging
[1:05:08] thing that ain't for me is allow God to
[1:05:09] speak through me and and what I'm doing
[1:05:11] and preaching the in this message is is
[1:05:15] difficult to uh to but all it takes is
[1:05:19] just yielding to the Holy Spirit just
[1:05:21] just saying just getting on your knees
[1:05:24] and saying Lord I yield myself to you I
[1:05:26] commit everything to you I Surrender
[1:05:28] everything to you
[1:05:30] use me as a vessel use me to speak
[1:05:34] through me Lord take thy mate
[1:05:38] help those around me that I may help
[1:05:40] those that work them and help those
[1:05:41] those my brothers and sisters that might
[1:05:46] help
[1:05:47] everyone one around me that you may use
[1:05:50] me in a powerful way doesn't matter who
[1:05:52] you are it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:05:54] male female child it doesn't matter
[1:05:57] God is willing to use you in a powerful
[1:06:00] way
[1:06:03] I believe I spoke to me well well uh
[1:06:06] back and it was it's on my it's on my
[1:06:09] notes Here
[1:06:10] all right
[1:06:12] it is it's really such a powerful
[1:06:16] message it touched my heart I I didn't
[1:06:19] prepare for this but let me just find it
[1:06:21] here real quick
[1:06:25] it's
[1:06:28] yeah I I was just amazed when the Lord
[1:06:31] was just speaking this to me
[1:06:35] let's see here this song
[1:06:40] okay here it is God is ready to use you
[1:06:43] in a powerful way but you're not ready
[1:06:46] to be used in a powerful way that hit me
[1:06:48] that that I hit deep God is ready to use
[1:06:51] you in a powerful way but are you ready
[1:06:54] to be used in a powerful way
[1:06:58] are you ready to be used in a powerful
[1:07:00] way
[1:07:02] that's that's where that word surrender
[1:07:04] comes in again are are things things of
[1:07:07] Life coming in the way of God using you
[1:07:10] in that powerful way
[1:07:18] that that just hit me that this way this
[1:07:21] was
[1:07:22] This was um
[1:07:25] 11 to 20. this was last last year
[1:07:30] this was November of last year that that
[1:07:32] the Lord spoke to me telling me that I
[1:07:35] was I was at the gym as well I was just
[1:07:36] thinking about the Lord and the Lord or
[1:07:39] told me that
[1:07:41] God is ready to use you in a powerful
[1:07:43] way
[1:07:44] are you but you're not ready to be used
[1:07:47] in a powerful way and I realized at that
[1:07:50] time that that I wasn't because because
[1:07:53] at that time I I wasn't and it was but
[1:07:57] this wasn't very long ago but at the
[1:07:59] time I was in a place where where I was
[1:08:02] as kind of you know not like super on
[1:08:06] power on fire for God but it was it was
[1:08:09] I was really wanting the Lord to just
[1:08:11] use me in a powerful way and then and
[1:08:13] that spoke to me that spoke to me
[1:08:16] because
[1:08:18] it takes surrender to allow God to use
[1:08:22] you in a powerful way it takes
[1:08:23] surrendering and those thoughts that
[1:08:26] that kind of come by you to try to tell
[1:08:28] you the the most challenging thing for
[1:08:30] me Satan's doing and all he can he he
[1:08:34] was trying all he could to prevent me
[1:08:36] from speaking from preaching this
[1:08:39] message from preaching the last message
[1:08:41] the person that got attacked the most is
[1:08:44] a preacher remember that because he's
[1:08:45] the one that feeds it in the she that
[1:08:47] he's the one uh one that brings the word
[1:08:49] of God to the Sheep
[1:08:51] and so God's always trying to I mean
[1:08:54] right Satan rather is always trying to
[1:08:56] uh attack me try to tell me this trying
[1:08:59] to put things in my mind even when I'm
[1:09:01] up here preaching trying to distract me
[1:09:03] trying to if he can just get me off on
[1:09:06] what I'm trying to preach on and if he
[1:09:07] can just get me off on on fully
[1:09:10] surrounding myself and yielding myself
[1:09:11] to God then Satan will have
[1:09:14] uh one over on me and and he that's his
[1:09:18] job is to try to block me from being a
[1:09:21] perfect representative of Christ that's
[1:09:24] what he's trying to do to each and every
[1:09:25] one of us where God told you to to speak
[1:09:29] to that person when God told you to to
[1:09:31] spread the gospel Satan and put that
[1:09:34] thing in you and said ah you said that
[1:09:36] it's too scary it's too
[1:09:38] That's what Satan always tries to do he
[1:09:41] uses
[1:09:42] our own Common Sense against us because
[1:09:45] God does not go by our feelings or
[1:09:48] common sense
[1:09:50] God oh God often times make us go
[1:09:54] against our uh exactly he'll make us go
[1:09:57] against our own flesh you'll make us go
[1:09:59] against the very nature of the things
[1:10:01] that we want to do and Satan will use
[1:10:04] our own what we want against us well our
[1:10:08] flesh wants against us and tell us you
[1:10:10] don't need to do that you don't need to
[1:10:11] do that yeah I know you feel it's
[1:10:14] probably just yourself telling you that
[1:10:15] that you should do this it's probably
[1:10:17] just yourself telling you
[1:10:19] it's not
[1:10:21] and you know it's it it's a devil trying
[1:10:23] to put put that in in your mind to tell
[1:10:25] you that that's not God that's something
[1:10:27] else that that's just yourself
[1:10:31] I I believe when that happens and you're
[1:10:33] just thinking to yourself oh that was
[1:10:35] just me
[1:10:36] that's probably that's probably the
[1:10:38] devil telling you that
[1:10:39] there's probably the devil telling you
[1:10:42] that because
[1:10:43] why would you want to convince yourself
[1:10:44] that that wasn't God that was telling
[1:10:46] you that
[1:10:48] Moses was a man who was called by God to
[1:10:52] lead the Israelites out of slavery in
[1:10:54] Egypt he was hesitant at first unsure of
[1:10:57] his ability to carry out such a great
[1:11:00] task
[1:11:02] but God reassured him saying in Exodus 4
[1:11:05] 12
[1:11:06] . now go I I will help you and speak and
[1:11:10] will teach you what to say
[1:11:13] exactly it's excuse I'm not a good
[1:11:15] public speaker I can't hardly speak to
[1:11:17] we make excuses excuses
[1:11:20] but but when God chose you you're
[1:11:22] calling was without repentance
[1:11:28] Moses went before pharaoh and with God
[1:11:30] speaking through his lips he demanded
[1:11:32] the release of Israelites he performed
[1:11:34] miraculous signs and wonders
[1:11:36] demonstrating the power of God to the
[1:11:38] people of Egypt and Indian Israelites
[1:11:41] were set free and Moses was redeemed as
[1:11:44] one of the greatest leaders in history
[1:11:45] of God's people
[1:11:47] imagine I got called uh someone that was
[1:11:50] shy someone that that would that
[1:11:52] couldn't hardly speak the public
[1:11:54] speaking
[1:11:55] I just thinking that God called me to be
[1:11:59] a preacher and I I couldn't hardly see
[1:12:01] pray in the Sunday school class and
[1:12:04] never mind come up here and preach
[1:12:07] but Moses was not a great leader because
[1:12:10] of his own strength or ability he was a
[1:12:12] great leader because he allowed God to
[1:12:14] speak through him to to use him as a
[1:12:17] vessel for his message and his will and
[1:12:19] in the same way we too are called to be
[1:12:22] vessels of God's message
[1:12:24] and well
[1:12:26] and just thinking that put your your
[1:12:29] name in it in this book put your name in
[1:12:33] there but but Daniel was not not a great
[1:12:36] leader because of his own strength or
[1:12:37] ability Daniel was not a great preacher
[1:12:40] because of his own strength and ability
[1:12:47] but because of uh but he was a great a
[1:12:52] great preacher because he allowed God to
[1:12:55] speak through him he to use him as a
[1:12:58] vessel for his message and his will in
[1:13:01] the same way we two are called to be a
[1:13:03] vessels for God's Masters and will
[1:13:07] in second Corinthians 5 20 Paul writes
[1:13:12] now now then we are ambassadors for
[1:13:15] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[1:13:18] us we pray you
[1:13:21] in other words as though God were making
[1:13:23] his appeal through us
[1:13:28] we and pour you on Christ's behalf be
[1:13:32] reconciled to God
[1:13:34] this process reminds us that we are
[1:13:37] chosen by God to represent him to the
[1:13:39] world
[1:13:40] and that we have been given the
[1:13:42] privilege of sharing this message of
[1:13:44] Salvation with others it's a privilege
[1:13:46] to share this this message of Salvation
[1:13:49] to others it's a privilege that God has
[1:13:52] given us and commanded us to to share
[1:13:55] this message with others and I believe
[1:13:58] it is our calling to share it with
[1:14:01] others because if we're not sharing this
[1:14:03] with others
[1:14:06] who else is God gonna use
[1:14:09] who else has gotten God gone into
[1:14:11] someone else will do it someone else
[1:14:13] will all do that
[1:14:16] someone else will preach this message
[1:14:18] somebody else well
[1:14:21] no no God has chosen us to do it no one
[1:14:26] else can do it but us
[1:14:31] we always make up excuses on why we
[1:14:34] don't want to do this we all want to do
[1:14:36] and do that for for God but but
[1:14:40] his his calling is without repentance as
[1:14:43] as we go through about our daily lives
[1:14:46] let us remember that we are walking
[1:14:48] around with God speaking through our
[1:14:50] lips to others let us be vessels for his
[1:14:53] message of love and grace and let us
[1:14:56] allow him to you and use us to teach the
[1:14:59] lives of those around us let us be like
[1:15:01] Moses trusting in God's strength and
[1:15:04] guidance and allowing him to work soon
[1:15:07] through us for his glory and his
[1:15:10] purposes
[1:15:11] now now I want to talk about this
[1:15:15] scripture in the Book of Judges we read
[1:15:17] about how Deborah served as a prophetess
[1:15:19] and judge over Israel she was a woman of
[1:15:23] great faith and wisdom and she she used
[1:15:27] her position of influence to lead the
[1:15:29] people of Israel back to God in judges
[1:15:32] four four to five it is we read and and
[1:15:35] Deborah A prophetess the wife of lapida
[1:15:41] she she judged Israel at that time and
[1:15:45] she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah
[1:15:49] between irama and and Bethel in Mount
[1:15:52] Ephraim and the children of Israel came
[1:15:54] up to her for judgment Deborah was not
[1:15:57] only a spiritual leader but also a
[1:15:59] political one she provided wise counsel
[1:16:02] and guidance to the people and her words
[1:16:04] were seen as coming directly from God
[1:16:09] in in judges four four six to seven and
[1:16:12] we read
[1:16:14] the pronunciations there's a lot of
[1:16:16] words here that are hard to read and she
[1:16:19] sent and called Barack the son of uh out
[1:16:23] of Kardashian and naphtali and and said
[1:16:27] unto him hath not the Lord God of Israel
[1:16:29] commanded saying go and draw toward
[1:16:32] Mount Tabor
[1:16:35] and take with the ten thousand men of
[1:16:38] the children of naphthali and of the
[1:16:40] children of zebulun
[1:16:42] and I will draw unto thee to the river
[1:16:46] of kitchen to Sarah the captain of
[1:16:49] jaben's army with his chariots and his
[1:16:52] multitude and I will deliver him unto
[1:16:55] thine hand
[1:16:56] through her prophetic gift Deborah was
[1:16:58] able to discern God's Will and speak it
[1:17:00] to their people she was a living
[1:17:03] representative of God walking around
[1:17:05] with his messes on her lips her
[1:17:07] faithfulness and obedience inspired
[1:17:10] others to turn back to God and to follow
[1:17:12] his ways my brothers and sisters we too
[1:17:15] are called to be representatives of God
[1:17:17] to walk around with this message on our
[1:17:19] lips just and just as Deborah was
[1:17:22] faithful and obedient and so too must we
[1:17:26] and so too wasn't must we be we must
[1:17:30] seek God's Will and discern his voice so
[1:17:32] that we can share his message with
[1:17:34] others
[1:17:36] in second Corinthians 5 20 Paul writes
[1:17:39] not now then we are ambassadors for
[1:17:41] Christ as though God we're pleading
[1:17:43] through us we implore you on Christ's
[1:17:46] behalf be reconciled to God and this
[1:17:49] passage reminds us that we have been
[1:17:51] chosen by God to be his ambassador to
[1:17:53] represent him in this world and to share
[1:17:55] his method message of love and salvation
[1:17:58] with others so my friends let us embrace
[1:18:01] our role as living Representatives with
[1:18:02] God let us seek his will discern his
[1:18:04] voice and fully Proclaim his message to
[1:18:07] the world may we be faithful and
[1:18:09] obedient like Deborah and may we live
[1:18:11] May Our Lives be a reflection of God's
[1:18:15] love and grace
[1:18:20] amen Deborah wasn't a perfect example of
[1:18:23] of someone who was surrendered to god a
[1:18:26] woman in the Bible a prophet test so uh
[1:18:30] so God can use even even though and
[1:18:33] though
[1:18:34] you know God can use a woman as a
[1:18:37] prophetess I I don't see anywhere where
[1:18:39] it says a woman can't be a prophetess in
[1:18:41] this last day
[1:18:43] not a preacher but but I believe me you
[1:18:47] might you can correct me if I'm wrong on
[1:18:49] that but
[1:18:51] but but I believe that that she was a
[1:18:55] perfect representation and of of God
[1:18:58] speaking and through someone speaking
[1:19:01] through a woman not just a man speaking
[1:19:04] through a woman
[1:19:05] a perfect representation of God that's
[1:19:07] what we're called to be
[1:19:10] in Acts six and seven we see an
[1:19:12] incredible example of this in the life
[1:19:14] of Stephen Stephen was a man full of
[1:19:16] faith in the Holy Spirit and he was
[1:19:19] chosen to serve as one of the seven
[1:19:22] deacons in the early church but he
[1:19:24] didn't just serve tables and take care
[1:19:26] of practical matters he also preached
[1:19:28] the gospel and perform miracles in the
[1:19:30] name of Jesus one day Stefan found
[1:19:33] himself standing before the Santa hadron
[1:19:36] accused of blasphemy but instead of
[1:19:39] cowering in fear stuff and boldly
[1:19:41] proclaim the truth about Jesus Christ
[1:19:43] and he spoke with such power and
[1:19:47] conviction
[1:19:48] that his accusers were enraged in Acts 7
[1:19:52] and 54 there to 60 we read that as
[1:19:54] Stefan was being stoned to death he
[1:19:57] looked up to heaven and saw the glory of
[1:19:59] God and Jesus standing on the right hand
[1:20:01] of God and then as he was dying he
[1:20:03] prayed for the persecutors saying Lord
[1:20:06] do not hold the sin against them
[1:20:09] amen if that isn't a perfect
[1:20:10] representative
[1:20:12] Lord Jesus Christ I don't know what what
[1:20:15] is Lord did not hold their sin against
[1:20:17] them
[1:20:18] just as Jesus said on the cross Lord I
[1:20:20] forgive them we are to we are to to take
[1:20:23] up our cross and follow Christ that is
[1:20:25] the definition of being representative
[1:20:27] of Jesus Christ picking up our cross and
[1:20:30] following him in his footsteps uh at
[1:20:32] some point in my my life I was praying
[1:20:35] Lord Lord help me to fall on you and
[1:20:38] fall in your footsteps and after a while
[1:20:41] I began to start thinking maybe after
[1:20:44] things start getting hard and I say and
[1:20:47] trials and
[1:20:48] thanks
[1:20:49] are coming in I started thinking now
[1:20:52] wait a minute what am I praying for I'm
[1:20:55] praying for that if I'm walking exactly
[1:20:58] in Jesus footsteps what did Jesus do he
[1:21:00] died on the cross didn't he he he
[1:21:02] suffered and
[1:21:04] he and and same as Peter same as all
[1:21:07] these Apostles follow in my footsteps
[1:21:09] and I'm thinking now wait a minute what
[1:21:11] am I asking for I started realizing
[1:21:13] without I'm I'm asking for trials I'm
[1:21:16] asking for God to test me I'm asking God
[1:21:18] uh to to
[1:21:20] purify me to to
[1:21:22] to
[1:21:24] walk in his footsteps and also walk in
[1:21:27] the suffering that he had suffered for
[1:21:29] us on and I started realizing now wait a
[1:21:31] minute that sounded a bit scary and then
[1:21:35] I kind of of uh laid back on on praying
[1:21:39] that because as I started realizing what
[1:21:41] I was asking for because I'm asking
[1:21:44] God uses his his strongest soldiers for
[1:21:49] the strongest battles he if God puts you
[1:21:52] on the front line it's because you're
[1:21:54] because you God knows you're strong
[1:21:56] enough to withstand the trials the
[1:21:58] tribulations that are coming your way
[1:22:01] and following Christ in his footsteps
[1:22:05] exactly in his footsteps a lot of us
[1:22:07] don't really want to do that once we
[1:22:09] realize exactly what comes with that not
[1:22:13] it's not just it's not just
[1:22:15] um I'm gonna have a a big house
[1:22:18] um a wife and family that that doesn't
[1:22:21] sound like what Jesus went through
[1:22:24] exactly in his footsteps is a bit
[1:22:26] different
[1:22:27] than what we're thinking
[1:22:30] and when I start realizing that I
[1:22:32] started thinking uh started praying Lord
[1:22:35] you let your will be done in my life not
[1:22:36] it's not exactly exactly in his
[1:22:39] footsteps exactly as he as he walked but
[1:22:41] we're called to be living
[1:22:42] representatives of him and walk in his
[1:22:45] footsteps and do it and do what he wants
[1:22:47] us to do it's not always exactly the
[1:22:49] same as someone else it's not always
[1:22:50] exactly the same as as what Jesus done
[1:22:53] dying on the cross and what what Peter
[1:22:54] done dying upside down on a cross and
[1:22:57] and the different Apostles that died and
[1:22:59] were crucified because of uh of this
[1:23:02] they were they were living represent
[1:23:04] representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] and that calling is the heart it's such
[1:23:10] a hard calling
[1:23:12] but yet it is our calling each and every
[1:23:14] one of us is to follow Christ fall in
[1:23:17] his footsteps
[1:23:18] then we got it easy we got it it's so
[1:23:22] good in this last day
[1:23:24] you know we got it so good and in
[1:23:27] America things are getting worse and
[1:23:28] worse but but we're still here aren't we
[1:23:31] we're still in church we're still you
[1:23:33] know going home and we're still uh we
[1:23:36] still got all the pleasures and things
[1:23:39] that that we have nowadays our phones
[1:23:41] our our TV our uh whatever
[1:23:45] we got it good and nice and while over
[1:23:48] in other countries
[1:23:50] just like what brother
[1:23:52] um what uh what your sweater says
[1:23:55] brother Tommy
[1:23:57] it says this message is illegal uh in
[1:24:01] how many countries
[1:24:03] 53 countries
[1:24:05] this message is illegal in 53 countries
[1:24:09] that's what is his father says
[1:24:11] it is and but it's still legal in this
[1:24:14] country we got so good but yet in in
[1:24:17] China
[1:24:18] what they'll do is they'll memorize
[1:24:21] entire screen their entire chapters in
[1:24:25] The Bible even some memorizing
[1:24:27] the entire Bible
[1:24:30] because why it's illegal in that country
[1:24:33] it's illegal to have this and we have it
[1:24:35] so nice but yet we can hardly remember a
[1:24:37] few few verses in this Bible never mind
[1:24:40] entire chapters
[1:24:44] and and following in Christ's footsteps
[1:24:48] and what they were called to do the
[1:24:50] apostles were called to do is they were
[1:24:52] called to
[1:24:53] to preach the gospel preach this gospel
[1:24:56] each and every one of them and and and
[1:24:58] they would had preached exactly what
[1:25:00] Jesus Christ preached exactly what he'd
[1:25:02] done and sure they would have they were
[1:25:05] persecuted just as he was
[1:25:08] and we will be persecuted there will
[1:25:10] come a time when when we will be right
[1:25:13] now we have it good and we must take
[1:25:14] advantage of this time and and instead
[1:25:17] of just let us laying back and relaxing
[1:25:19] and thinking oh everything's all nice
[1:25:21] wait till it gets bad wait till things
[1:25:23] say things start cracking down wait till
[1:25:25] that final squeeze happens
[1:25:37] just before the Rapture and takes place
[1:25:40] I believe that it's going to be it's
[1:25:42] going to get to the worst just as bad as
[1:25:44] it is and then the D3 countries just as
[1:25:47] illegal they'll hunt us down like dogs
[1:25:49] and and work hard to be living
[1:25:52] representatives of Christ and sometimes
[1:25:54] it takes
[1:25:55] it takes hard times it takes persecution
[1:25:59] to really drive us to our knees to is
[1:26:02] and to to make us to to follow in his
[1:26:05] footsteps because that's how it was back
[1:26:07] in that time
[1:26:13] God calls us to be living
[1:26:14] representatives of him
[1:26:18] not not living not necessarily living in
[1:26:22] in a life of luxury like and and not not
[1:26:26] living for for Christ it's good good to
[1:26:29] be blessed and God does blessing each
[1:26:32] and every one of us
[1:26:33] financially and so forth but they'll
[1:26:36] come a time when when and it'll be
[1:26:40] illegal and to spread this message and
[1:26:43] right now we we must take the advantage
[1:26:46] as we got to preach the message as much
[1:26:49] as we can because as the time is running
[1:26:52] out time is running out
[1:26:55] and it's
[1:26:57] dire
[1:26:58] it's it's necessary to do that that in
[1:27:02] in this day and God calls us to be
[1:27:04] living example what did Christ do in
[1:27:06] that time he
[1:27:07] pretty preached he preached
[1:27:12] he preached to them he called them to
[1:27:15] repent what did Peter do what he
[1:27:18] preached he was the living
[1:27:19] representative of Christ he preached and
[1:27:23] and was as in Acts 2 38 repent and be
[1:27:26] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:27:27] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:29] what what are we to do well as as Christ
[1:27:34] didn't being living representative of
[1:27:35] God speaking
[1:27:38] to speak his his truth and love to those
[1:27:41] around you and to bring hope and healing
[1:27:44] to a hurting World
[1:27:46] let us be like Stefan filled with the
[1:27:50] holy
[1:27:51] Holy Spirit and boldness let us be
[1:27:54] faithful to our calling as ambassadors
[1:27:55] of Christ
[1:27:58] foreign
[1:27:59] God has always got this is what brother
[1:28:02] and preach this is a really powerful God
[1:28:05] has always got a People somewhere that
[1:28:07] he could point to and say that's it oh I
[1:28:10] want to be among that in that number I'm
[1:28:12] sure we all want to be there it's the
[1:28:14] desire of every heart we want to be
[1:28:16] among that number that God can say this
[1:28:19] is my people look at them they are an
[1:28:21] example of what I am they are reflecting
[1:28:23] my life in their in theirs they have
[1:28:25] surrendered their life and I'm
[1:28:27] reflecting my life through theirs what a
[1:28:31] beautiful thing
[1:28:33] how it must make God feel good to know
[1:28:36] that he has got somebody he can put his
[1:28:38] trust in
[1:28:41] hey man that's us this morning if that's
[1:28:44] not us we better get it we better make
[1:28:47] it right now God help me to not be so
[1:28:52] so afraid and say of what people think
[1:28:55] to and spreading his gospel I can't I
[1:28:58] can't preach this enough
[1:29:00] it's it's scary it's fearful but it
[1:29:03] doesn't really matter what people think
[1:29:05] of you does it really matter if you lose
[1:29:07] friends and because of this message does
[1:29:09] it really matter what people think of
[1:29:12] you if you if you if
[1:29:14] we're all guilty of this uh I'm I'm
[1:29:18] afraid of doing this or that because I'm
[1:29:20] scared of what they might think I I I
[1:29:22] and then we do things because because
[1:29:25] we're scared of of what they might think
[1:29:27] and what what my brother might think in
[1:29:29] in this that the other but in reality
[1:29:32] the only way thought that actually
[1:29:34] matters is what Jesus Christ thinks of
[1:29:36] us that's the
[1:29:39] eternal
[1:29:40] in the Eternal mind of Christ what does
[1:29:42] he think about us we are one of his we
[1:29:46] are Sons and Daughters of him
[1:29:49] I can't stress this enough God wants us
[1:29:53] to be living representatives of him
[1:29:56] we and we are living representatives of
[1:29:58] him and sometimes we we take that for
[1:30:01] granted and we we go on In Living for
[1:30:03] ourselves and doing what what our flesh
[1:30:05] wants to do and we put we put the Holy
[1:30:07] Ghost to the side and we say I'm gonna
[1:30:09] do this I'm going to do that and and I'm
[1:30:11] busy today and I and I don't got time
[1:30:13] for this and I don't got time for that
[1:30:16] yeah God called us to be representatives
[1:30:18] of him to walk in his footsteps to do
[1:30:20] what he wants us to do not necessarily
[1:30:24] exactly what he'd done as in dying on
[1:30:26] the cross or and being crucified like he
[1:30:28] was but if it comes down to that be
[1:30:30] willing to
[1:30:31] foreign
[1:30:33] to die for him well I I hear so many
[1:30:37] people say I'm willing and to die for
[1:30:40] for Christ I'm willing to
[1:30:42] um to but are you willing to live for
[1:30:44] him that that's what truly matters
[1:30:48] especially say since we don't
[1:30:50] necessarily have that hanging on the
[1:30:53] line in in this country in other
[1:30:55] countries they have that but in this
[1:30:57] country we don't have to deal with that
[1:30:58] and
[1:31:02] oh my
[1:31:05] please please stand musicians if you'll
[1:31:07] come
[1:31:11] living representatives of God that's
[1:31:15] that that's my message this evening if
[1:31:17] we can just be a living representative
[1:31:21] of God each and every one of us
