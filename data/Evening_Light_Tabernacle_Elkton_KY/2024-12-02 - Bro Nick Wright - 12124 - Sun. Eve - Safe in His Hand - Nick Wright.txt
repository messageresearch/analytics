afternoon friend it's good to be here again uh telling brother berer I like that you have back home afterwards we we normally kind of just go off to the restaurants and things I I really like that that's uh that's awesome you get the opportunity to together and and Talk Amongst yourselves and and just talk about how the Lord's blessed you it's such such a great opportunity um tonight I've had a couple people I talk to actually request that I give my testimony so it's going to be a little bit of a different pace tonight and I hope that's okay with everyone um and sorry brother um you asked for a scripture and it just one just came and I was back there so I didn't give you you the scripture but uh I do want to read the scripture before we go into that uh but before we do that let just go ahead and pray Jesus we just we thank you uh you're just you're such a wonderful Mighty God and and as as we heard this morning we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony Lord so so tonight might be a little bit of a different pace but we still Lord ask that everything said be said that glorifies you Lord uh nothing added that would detour the people from realizing that you honor and all the glory Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord God for bringing us where we are today each and every one of us thank you for being a kind loving close father we just ask you bless the reading of the word and we ask these things in Jesus name amen so I I I would like to read John 10 uh 28 John 10:28 and it says and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them my hand and I've never thought to put a title to my testimony but if I would tonight and this may become a sermon someday but I would call it safe in his hand thank you Lord for the reading of your word y all may have your seat um so again we just thank the opportunity um definitely uh definitely appreciate the fellowship here in um such a great lovely a bunch of people really enjoyed the fellowship I got with uh the berer family um they cut out a little early but uh really look forward to spending some time with them in the future um and I've made some friends along the way some of you I didn't get to speak to and I do apologize just trying to make my rounds but um so we want to start off and we want to we want to just talk about how we got here how I got here where I am today um because I did not grow up in the message I did not grow up in church um and so to think where I am today sometimes I feel a lot like blind bmus and you know you just you cry out and the Lord answers and so we'll start off and I'll talk about my childhood and how I got here where I am so um won't keep you long I will set my timer this time so I don't go too long this is something I could talk about for quite a while the Lord has definitely done a lot of things to to bless me and my family um and uh praise the Lord so so when I was young um I I did like I said I did not grow up in a Christian Home whatsoever um I grew up in a rough environment a rough family um my parents divorced when I was young um there's some things there you know they they battled with they went through but they split when I was very young and uh so you know those types of things some of the the first memories I've had to deal with one thing I like to add um when I was about 6 years old six or seven right before my mom uh left uh we had a neighbor and they had a love swing and if you can kind of Envision those like a frame style love swings uh those neighbors left for vacation and so they took the swing off the love they knew the little boy next door would probably jump on it and break it or something this was the little boy so what did the little boy do I climbed it anyway um so I climbed this A-frame love swing with no swing on it and I was sitting on the top bar there was someone across the street and I was yelling something back and I was sitting on top eating a sandwich and I remember thinking in my head I'm going to jump off I'm gonna swing on this I'm gonna bite my sandwich I'm cool I remember thinking that so I tried it just went to grab it missed completely the chain the hook actually went into my neck and a little six-year-old me was just hanging there by a chain in my neck and I was swinging and just watching cars go by and uh honestly I don't know how long I was swinging there the neighbor from down the road happened to be walking their dog around the block and they saw me and they came up and looked real close I think they thought that the hook was in my shirt like Tangled in my shirt or something but when they saw it in my neck they ran and started pounding on the door to try to get somebody's attention and it seemed like forever nobody answered the door we come to find out my mom was in the shower so she wasn't answering she ended up coming out um in a towel seeing me hanging by my neck by this chain and ripped me off without a thought threw me in the car and rushed me to the hospital so the doctor said how it didn't hit your jugular vein especially when she ripped you off is an absolute miracle I always tell people it wasn't it wasn't gravity that was holding me up right it was it was definitely not gravity that was helping me there was the Lord's hand that was helping me there and I add that because a little bit later there's something somewhat significant um to this testimony um because actually there was some Deliverance that happened in in in these churches um that I found much later in life because when I became a Christian that message churches existed so you know I grew up like I said in a rough home it was a rough environment my dad was abusive um physically mentally um he tried to get me to fight him he'd come in drunk and and punch me and stuff like that you know it's just not a great home and he cared more about women you know things like that so as a little kid I'm sitting here thinking if you can imagine why did my mom leave and why did my mom leave me with this guy we just didn't have a good relationship it was it was uh and so you know I leave a lot of that when I was about we'll say 15 years old one night I was actually at a party of all places and I was what you call babysitting I was making sure the the people there weren't you know sticking forks and lockets and stuff like that and burning the house down or whatever so I was in charge of making sure all the people got thrown into bed when you know the time came for pass out so I did that I was pretty violently throwing them into bed I was just yipping them here and throwing them and I remember I sat down on the couch and I started crying and I just said God if you exist just show me because up to that point I didn't believe in a God I said if a God exists if a God exists I want nothing to do with him because he gave me this life like why would he do that and so the fact that something broke in me we know when I say the Deep calleth to the Deep we know what that means but that's what was going on with me broke something in me was calling out and uh slamer things in my testimony they're a little bit they're a little bit out there um the Lord dealt with me very not that he hasn't dealt with everybody supernaturally so I'm not undermining when I say that but the Lord dealt with me very supernaturally in a lot of ways so um just disclaimer some of it's pretty pretty out there but so I I cried out and he immediately started to show me who assisted um I started I started feeling like I was being pulled in two different directions right away and from that moment on things just started to change little bit by little bit he would do things to show me there is a God something exists you know out there and uh one of those things happened uh again when I was about 15 years old I'd go to school I'd come home and I'd have that you know that rough relationship ship with my dad one day he just randomly seemingly asks me he's like why are you always walking around here so depressed and I looked at him I'm like you you actually you want to know like I I I wanted to actually talk to the man and I thought that that was opportunity to do so and I said honestly Dad I think about death a lot and he said oh you want to kill yourself huh I don't want to do that that's not what I meant I just think about that a lot that's what's depressing me and so he goes in his room and he grabs a shotgun and he hands me the shotgun he says go ahead do it kill yourself and I'm just shocked cuz like I did not expect this at all I expected yeah we're going to have a heart to heart and we're going to work some stuff no he hands me a shotgun and says go ahead and kill yourself so I look at him I'm like are are you serious he's like actually go outside yourself because I don't want to clean up a mess I'm just like so I handed it back to him and I gave him some not so nice words again not a Christian at the time not so nice words were in my vocabulary so I went upstairs and uh uh again this is a little touchy so disclaimer okay but uh I went upstairs and I wrote a note to my dad and I said I'm up here hanging around don't send the kids after me and uh so what he'd normally do is he'd send my brothers and sisters up to say hey it's dinner time you know so don't send the kids after me I threw the note at the bottom of the stairs and uh I went upstairs and I grabbed uh a long sweater a long sweatshirt and in my room uh there was an attic access you know those ones where you push up out of the way I don't know if you've got them in your home or whatever but you know I pushed it out of the way and I got up on a chair and I looked and I tied the one end of the shirt to the rafter to the truss and uh pulled it real tight and shut the put the other end around my neck and I kicked the chair out from under me and I woke up on the ground like okay so I pick up end of the shirt and it's still tied and my first thought was great I broke the truss now he's really going to kill me and so I get up on the chair and I go to push the attic axis out of the way and the first thing I notice is there's no big hole in the wall I would have thought that if it pulled through it would just decimate the wall you know or the the ceiling there's no big hole I get up there and I look and the truss is perfectly intact and so I look at the one behind it thinking like oh maybe I tied it to that one and it's perfectly intact and I cannot explain it but it was God and and even at the time is as odd as this might sound I didn't ATT attribute it to to God I took it off and I looked at it I'm like well I'm not doing that again and I just moved on with my day I didn't take into consideration that it was God supernaturally preserving me for for a reason and so when when I would go back to school there would be things that would occur where I I would be walking and suddenly I'd see something that you know maybe you call it a vision or something I would see something and things were like that were happening quite a bit and I would come home and I would just I would talk you know to myself we'll say quote unquote I would talk to myself thinking like what in the world is going on and I'd be asking these questions and I would be getting answers and one day when I got home from school I sat down on my bed I had a little Houton for a bed and I heard this noise and this noise sounded like I was like what is that noise and so I look out the window and I think in my head if Leaf is moving on the tree I'm going to say it's just the wind blowing through the screen and it was The Bluest skies and not a single leaf was moving and I sat and I watched nothing was moving I went and I sat back down and then I heard it again and I got up and I'm like maybe maybe someone's vacuuming and I went downstairs and I looked and nobody was even in the living room so I go back upstairs to my room and and I sit back down and I hear that noise again and this time it doesn't go away it just gets louder and louder and the presence gets greater and greater and I'm on the futon ing up cuz I have never experienced anything like this before and it felt like the presence hit me it I'm sure you've all felt it in a church service where that presence just hits you the Lord just makes himself real to you so I stand up and I'm like I'm just going to go take a nap I'm just take a nap something's wrong so I went to go jump on my bed to take a nap and again like I said you got to you got to pretty well believe in natural here with me for a moment I never put this together before I was always like why did this happen but I did get an answer and it's pretty it's pretty interesting to jump on my bed and I never hit the bed something stood me back up and walked me to the mirror and I always wondered like that seems extremely odd extremely far-fetched but I was reading one time in one of brother brandom's meetings talked about someone sitting in the back that started floating because because the conditions were so right for the Rapture but the man ended up coming back down because it wasn't time so I was like wow that's pretty awesome I learned that much later but what what was what was going on is I would be receiving these experiences and then as I was seeking God I'd find those experiences in the Bible okay and then later I would find brother brandom talked about him we'll get to that so I go and I look in the mirror and I'm just I'm like I just want to go lay down I just I I want I want to I want to just go to sleep but then I hear this voice and it says son look at your life I started receiving again I'm going to call them Visions because I don't know I'm not a prophet I don't I don't know what they were but I'm the Lord was just speaking to me he was showing me things he was showing me things in my past and he was showing me how his hand had had been on me my whole life and then I snap out of these Visions all them and something else would speak through me and it would say but you're cool you're school you got this you got that you got all these things and I would snap out of that and I'd be like I don't I don't want those things I and realized was going on is is one was coaxing one was coaxing me the other one was just speaking seeking out of love and I recognized that love and then again I'd hear son look at your life and then it would be you know the Visions would happen again it would be current current state where he' show that were going on and how his hand was on life and I'd snap out of that something would speak through me yeah but this yeah but that yeah but you know trying to coax me and it was just a back and forth and that happened three times the last time son your life I didn't realize it at the time but I was beginning to see things that were going to happen and uh when it was done I sarcastically said can I go lay down now and I went and I hopped on the bed this time and when my head hit the bed Vision started again and I he I heard that voice speaking through those Visions telling me that I would be a preacher and I laughed I sat up from that and I laughed I'm like there's no way not not this guy that's funny that's funny right there no way let alone a preacher yeah no no way I just denied it well he didn't let me go he he kept dealing with me in the same manner uh for quite a while keep in mind I'm about 15 going on 16ish at this time um coming up to graduation so while all these things are happening to me I've got you know established friends at school it was kind of the kids who were Outcast we'll say they dressed in all black and you know they they acted certain ways they saw what was going on with me and they began to change I didn't even tell them about Jesus because I didn't know who Jesus was at the time I just I I tell people here to me shake my hand and say hi I'm Jesus but experiences that solidified his scriptures in my heart and so they just see this change and they're like what's going on and I said well I believe a God exists and I believe he's doing something in my life and I would begin to tell them in much greater detail again I'm sparing so many details but in much greater detail I begin to tell them a God exists there's some God that exists and at that point I just wanted to know who that God was that just did that stuff to me and so I began seeking and what is the first thing anybody that believes in God does what do they do they go to church so I just started going to churches I begin to tell people about what was going on with me and they would they would actually make me people and testify it was just any random churches I couldn't tell you what denomination or anything today but just any random churches I was going to and I was just testifying to everybody not even realizing like haha I made you a preacher in fact so they'd put me in front of people and I'd just speak what I was being showed and speak you know what was on my heart and some people after the services would approach me and they would say hey the things that you said really struck a chord they really rang true with me um and that would happen quite a bit and so what ended up happening was there was a bunch of people that kind of were like gravitated to me in a way and so I'd go to these churches and they would follow me these different churches it was it was interesting how it was all working out so after one of the times I was speaking to someone you know speaking to a crowd and someone came up to me and they say my grandpa says a lot of similar things that you say you need to talk to him like absolutely I would love to talk to somebody who isn't you know Doctrine down my throat or whatever and tell me I'm wrong in any way shape or form or every every way you know this belief's right that belief's right you know I kind of had a mini Church age session all to myself before I really realized what it was you know um but I ended up meeting this man his name was Dale and when I went to shake his hand um he stepped back and and I'm sure any of you have heard testimony so like I I I almost get a little nervous saying these things because I don't want people to think anything odd but but the man stepped back and he said the pillar of fire is standing on your head he said the angel of the Lord is is with you and I didn't know what that meant but I just started crying because I knew it had to be a good thing and he just started speaking to me about Jesus and he was speaking about things that were actually happening in my life and he was he kept quoting this man named William brandom and and so I'm just listening and I'm just taking it in that was one of the first times that had happened to me so as the Lord was changing me he was using me to do that to other people that was the first time that had happened to me so I would go home or I would go to school or whatever and funny enough I would Google what is the pillar of fire or what is the Angel of the Lord and one of the first things that popped up was Angel of the Lord and how he commissioned me William brandom I recognized both of those phrases of the Lord and William brandom like yeah I'll listen to that so I listen to it and I'm hooked I listen to a specific sermon where brother Brandon's talking about where he first heard the angel of the Lord appear in a whirlwind and he made the noise and he made the noise and I sat tension because I had never ever ever heard anybody else talk that way so immediately I'm like this man has truth and it's funny how it ended up working out but I ended up just reading the Bible praying to God listen to brother brandom reading the Bible praying to God listen brother brandom and that's how I was getting my answers so I would go around and I would tell people what I believed was the truth and so effectively I was preaching the message and at this point had no idea that there was message churches so I thought I was the only one besides some old dude that I met that believed what I believed and so I believe what I believe because I experienced the Lord and he showed from the Bible and from the prophet that that this this is reality so the things I spoke of this morning things I'm speaking of now are things that I do believe with all of my heart they are reality they're real they're reality to me this message is real people people sometimes make it an intellectual thing you know especially now that we have the table app and we can just go and memorize not and do this and do that but it it's about relationship people do it with the Bible you know it's no knock on on any any technology or anything you know people do it with the Bible that's how we have you know 60,000 plus denominations because people intellectually conceive things but this is about a relationship it's so different and so so I I basically you know I'm I'm 17 we'll say 17 18 I'm graduating you know I'm basically spending my life praying listen to the message studying praying listen to the message and going to church going to all these different churches and I felt at the time that my life's mission was to convert all these churches so I would go and I would I would preach the message and a lot of people just stopped talking to me they stopped liking me and I'm like I don't get how you guys don't see this this is this is the truth I don't I not grasp how you can't see it and so IID pray about things like that like God why don't they see it you know brother Brandon would talk about there's three in a church and so on so forth and so I was settled with that there must just be a lot of unbelievers in these churches or something I don't know so but what was still happening is there would still be people that would listen they would come out and they would believe and so today those people are in churches than the lord they're established in differentes and we'll kind of get to that too but along the way I met my wife obviously she wasn't my wife at the time but Nick was very very content living in a car sleeping outside going around preaching uh baptizing people in bathtubs I mean that was my life and I was so happy doing that but then I meet this girl and I'm like well she probably wouldn't like that so I should probably get a better job I was a at the time I was making like four bucks an hour or something it was it was pretty bad but I'm like yeah she probably probably wants a house and wants all these things so so things kind of shifted for me but she believed the things I was telling her and and basically basically followed me along the way I mean that's what it boils down to so I ended up getting a job I ended up getting into maintenance I was a maintenance technician I ended up getting hurt I ended up hurting my hand and I had to have Sur surgery had to have hip surgery they took bone from my hip to rebuild my hand and just all these crazy things and so all the money I was saving went out the window I was living paycheck to paycheck because I had you know the medical side of things they didn't cover much we'll just put it that way I I got half for workers comp and then less than half and then I just been hardly paying rent like it was really bad at the time and so go figure at that time the Lord speaks and says now is the time to buy a house and I kind of just laughed and I'm like okay so I download the realtor.com app and I open it I hear that voice again say that's the house and so the first house that popped up I didn't even scroll it was the first house that popped up clicked it hit contact seller threw my phone down and forgot about it well the next day I hear uh I hear back from the the real realtor and we set up a meeting we go and we meet and I look at the house and it's a very nice house no idea I'm going to afford this thing I'm pretty much bluffing the whole time like yeah yeah we're we're definitely going to buy this house uh you and I'm not leading this real t on to believe that I have zero money like negative money at this point and so of course I'm witnessing to this lady I'm telling her all about Jesus and all about what I believe and my test and everything else again in much more detail you know we don't have a whole whole lot of and I don't want to keep you late um but she says you know the owner of this house is a Christian she said you should meet him and I'm like yeah I'd be glad to meet him that'd be cool you know cuz in my head all Christians on the earth at this point need converted they need to believe message because everybody I've met so far doesn't and it doesn't make sense so so I ended up borrowing $250 again no I'm going to pay that back but ended up borrowing $250 to get a home inspector and so I went with the home inspector to to this home and owner happened to be there I'm like sweet I'm G to get a chance to talk to this guy and so I start talking to him and and at this point I'm a sheepish about how I share things I'm not so open about these experiences as I'm having or like for the brandom I don't throw that name right out there cuz time I do that people would react pretty rough you know and so I throw little things out there and this man was biting he was he was agreeing with things and he was amening things and I'm like man he's really a Christian all right so I'd throw some certain things out there i' get to the point where I was going to all these different churches and I was doing all these different things and I said I I I believe that there's three different types of believers make Believers unbelievers Believers he looked at me he's like yeah I know someone who says that I'm like who cuz I knew who said that and he's like oh uh this someone named uh William brandom and I'm like what and I grab this guy and I pick him up and I start spinning around and he's kicking his feet going what and if you know who it is it's all the funnier um I'm not going to say the name we can talk about that privately just because this is on you know tape or whatever but uh if you know who it is it's all the more funnier because he's about this tall and so it's just funny to tell that and to think about it think back on it but I was like you have no idea I thought I was the only other one besides this old guy who even knew who that was he's like are you kidding like no he's like there's churches all around you I'm like what do you mean churches all around me me he's like yeah there's message churches here there's message churches there there's message churches here so the funny thing about this this whole thing you know I I did have a very Supernatural uh coming into the message right the Lord dealt with me a very specific way to get me to believe and to really solidify in my heart but then here's where he really began to show up in terms of the message making it a reality because there's often times where people will have experiences you know we hear about it in the Pentecostal church we hear about it all the time you know people have experiences but then they can't they can't place those properly so without placing your experiences in the message that they're going to be wrong you're going to interpret them wrong you're going to go the wrong direction there has to be a foundation and so the Lord really really gave me a foundation there and so I'm talking to this guy and he invites to church and um I just blown away I'm so unbelievably excited y'all because I now know many people who believe what I believe and so I'm I'm very excited you know the first church I go to truer Tabernacle yeah this is awesome the first guest speaker I here Ron Spencer yeah I'm connecting was great so I'm real excited people are real excited to hear about me cuz I just show up out of nowhere you know and so we go to AR and we start talking and I'm telling my testimony again in much more detail um because we had time and I get to this one point where I talk about that old guy right and someone pops up from the crowd and says hey I know him I'm like what do you mean you know him he's like yeah his son is a preacher down here down the way or whatever I'm like well I got to meet him and so this is where Nick made a mistake so sons of God are LED of the amen but that doesn't mean that sons of God can't get very overzealous and excited and make wrong decisions so I should not have went to that church um I'm not going to say the church I'm not they not going to go there but there's times where well you can encounter religious Spirits right so you got to understand I am so new and just so excited and so just happy of all the things that the Lord is doing just telling everybody all the things that the Lord has done for me and believe it or not there's people out there that will that will throw a wet blanket flames and they'll say oh oh that's wrong you should just sit down and you should listen to my teaching and my preaching and just stay there and you know that position and so that really confused me um that threw me off a little bit because my first experience was yes this is awesome and then my my latter experience is wait a minute so so you're telling me that all of the things I experienced in the past are wrong and then so in my mind I'm thinking well if that's wrong then this is wrong and that's wrong and this is wrong of course you get to the point sometimes where you you elevate a man above where he should be right and so that's what I mistake is I elevated a man way above where he should have been and I let religious Spirits in to hurt me and so but back to the house we'll talk about that for a minute I had no money like how am I going to pay for this thing well I'm praying about it I'm like Lord if you want me to have this house then I'll have this house no problem um along the lines along the the the way there I propose to my wife uh I propose her name you know her name's Phoebe I propose and uh we're we're getting really serious we're getting really close to the time where we need a house cuz we're going to get married here soon so the Lord ended up providing the down payment so what ended up happening there I had a buddy who worked at uh a factory and he didn't realize he had a 401k that he was saving because he he opted out of it but I guess the company was putting into it anyway and so when he quit there he actually had exactly and he offered it to me and so I was able to get the down payment for the house and so of course he'll be blessed and he was paid back but I got the down payment for the house right so we got the house we got married all within a month and now we're going to these new churches so all of that all happened and then we get hurt by this Rel spirit so we actually start to back out I pull back from churches and I'm like well I I was happy BAS basically just being tape only I was happy there I was safe about all that I'm just going to go back and do that just going to go do I sat at home and listen to tapes and believe it or not got more depressed than I was when I was a kid when I was a kid it it was it was bad it was really bad but to to see God move kid I never saw God move to see God move and then to have that all come crashing down imagine that imagine the depression on that and so I got very very depressed very down and I started doing this when God spoke and I started walking the other direction I'm not going to do this stuff anymore I'm not going to go to church I'm not going to do nothing I'm just going to walk away so I tried with everything in me to walk away and all along the way the Lord would nudge me he'd move me in directions and I'd basically tell him stop I want to go this way well he'd let me go that way and then he'd Circle me back around and I'd end up exactly where he told me to be in the first place he wouldn't let me go and just as any Son of God he wouldn't let you go he wouldn't let you go he will not let you go like the scripture I read we're safe in his and that's our assurance that no matter where you go no matter what you go through no matter condition he will keep you and so that's to me that's an encouragement because there's many people who have walked away there's many people you've probably seen that's walked away um I can I can under I can relate I can understand but the Lord will keep them the Lord will bring them back I'm speaking that the Lord back I'm back so we go my wife and I we go about a year and a half I think it was without going to church and the llies actually um were a Saving Grace to me because they spent time with me they spent you know they they made themselves available so that so that I had someone that I could I could I could fellowship with and be with and uh they really really me in a in a good mind mind mindset and so you know bless brother Matt for that um we ended up I I can't put into words how bad it was guys it it got really really dark for for a really long time there was a lot of those visions that I had in the past that had come to pass but there was a lot of them that didn't happen yet right and so I just disregarded all of that I said I want nothing to do with this I'm walking away one day the Lord put it on my heart to go back to True Word and realistically I should have never left true word I should have stayed there I should I should have I should have prayed before I left if I were to leave you know sometimes people get up and leave because you know who knows why they by this person or that person says this or whatever and they're making decisions on their own and and we really do need to just pray seek God for the answers and follow him um otherwise we're going to find ourselves in some some bad spots but the Lord spoke to my heart didn't ignore it we went back to True Word and interesting interestingly enough um when I was going there the first time you know because we went there for a little while back and forth um I never met my my current Pastor uh brother Wayne I never met him maybe a few times you know a handful of times like handshakes or whatever because he was an evangelist he was always gone you know and uh and so when I went you know he was he was home a lot more so I had the opportunity to really meet him and we had moments where uh brother Wayne he's uh you all know brother Wayne probably he's a very Gifted Man and there'd be moments where we'd have a connection and he'd uh you know he would be used to fulfill a lot of those things that I right those those Visions I had I'm not getting into them for reason again time and and also um some of them are just they're a little personal and you know uh a testimony is it's personal to some to some extent right so some of those things we need to keep to ourselves because it's not you know like brother brandham had had visions that meant something to the bride as a body and and my things meant something for me so that's why I'm not elaborating on some of them but he would directly fulfill some of the visions that I had years and years ago and so what the Lord was showing me because what wasn't connecting for me for a very long time so it's one of them things like I spoke of earlier a tree can be cut down dead but when the water comes it Springs back to life so that's the condition I was in I was cut down dead very dead religious Spirits did that to me and so when I went back to where I should have been in the first place the waters there help me spring back okay and and so what the Lord began to show me was he was dealing with me very personally in the past and I come back to church and now he's dealing with me very personally through the body so he began to show me the reality of the body of Christ it's him in us moving it's him in us moving just using the preachers and he's not just using you know the pastors the Evangelist he's not just using you know everybody is the body collectively just because somebody stands here and you guys sit down there doesn't mean anything it's not the voice behind the pulpit it's it's the voice in the body and so that's what he began to tell me that that that how he was dealing with me in the past he's now doing it in a body and it took such a long time for it to connect and click with me that that I am a son I am a Son of God it took so long for me to for it to connect and me to realize things like this like Adam was blessed or Eve was blessed while in Adam and so we're blessed in the Beloved Jesus was blessed Jesus was said this is my beloved we were blessed just the same those types of blessings we have and and just how the Lord led me in it was uh it was it's it's hard to condense this it's really hard to condense this in such a short time it was it was in such a way that he he really solidified that what brother brandham spoke over the bride would can to anybody not just people sitting in these churches right he he can he can reach out to the to the depths of the world he can reach out anywhere to grab anybody from any condition I was in a bad bad condition like I I was like blind bamus I just cried out have mercy on me I cried out if you exist just show me and he did he began to he began to really move in my life and brought me here and solidified me in the message and we all have a testimony we all have something we can speak on and I don't know what yours is you know some of mine you know maybe we'll have the opportunity in the future to talk a little bit more in detail about it I don't know but we all have something that we can testify about we all have something that we can praise the Lord about what we have to realize though and what we really have to hold in our heart is that the message isn't just a bunch of stuff written down on a piece of paper and it's not just some recordings it's not all it is it is a reality it is a spoken word that is manifesting it is a relationship that's what this message is amen so thank you for your time hopefully you understand me or you know me a little bit better that's my testimony um in a nutshell that is such a nutshell um again there's like tons more detail so much more detail um just just the Lord dealing with me uh very supernaturally and you know reserving my life many times and and uh he's just he's a good good god um he's a great God and he's he's just blessed us beyond measure and I look forward to Future Fellowship um really appreciate you bearing with me here tonight I hope you were blessed by the service this morning and I hope I hope I did say some things here even in my testimony that you know maybe encouraged you um maybe maybe if you do have some loved ones out in the world an example of of somebody that if if you're Gods you're Gods plain and simple there's nothing that the devil can do to to to stop God's word from coming to pass we were talking at the lunch um about the Pond Lily when that light strikes it it begins to come up right away and there might be some seaweed or some fish or something that comes and tries to prevent it
