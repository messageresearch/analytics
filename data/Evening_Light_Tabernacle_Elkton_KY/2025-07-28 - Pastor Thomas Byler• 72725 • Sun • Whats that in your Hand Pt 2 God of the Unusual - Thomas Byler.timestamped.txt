[18:25] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[18:28] If we'll just stand this morning,
[18:31] maybe brother John Wade will open us in
[18:33] prayer this morning.
[19:58] Amen. The children can be dismissed for
[20:00] Sunday school if you'll just go with me
[20:02] in the Psalms. We're going to go to
[20:03] Psalms 103 today.
[20:06] Sure is good to be in the house of the
[20:08] Lord.
[20:10] Brother Brenham said, "You can't leave
[20:11] the same." He said, "You'll either leave
[20:13] better or you'll leave worse." And I
[20:14] prayed that we all leave better this
[20:16] morning.
[20:18] Psalms 103.
[20:27] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[20:30] is within me, bless his holy name.
[20:37] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[20:40] healeth all thy diseases,
[20:50] &gt;&gt; who satisfy the mouth with good things,
[20:53] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[20:55] eagles.
[21:02] He made known his ways unto Moses his
[21:04] acts unto the children of Israel.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; He will not always chide, neither will
[21:14] he keep his anger forever.
[21:23] For as the heaven is high above the
[21:25] earth, so great is his mercy toward them
[21:28] that fear him.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Like as a father pityth his children, so
[21:39] the Lord pityth them that fear him.
[21:46] As for man, his days are as grass, and
[21:49] as a flower of the field, so he
[21:50] flourisheth.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; The mercy of the Lord is from
[22:00] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[22:03] that fear him, and his righteousness is
[22:05] unto a children's children.
[22:14] The Lord hath prepared his throne in the
[22:16] heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over
[22:19] all.
[22:30] the Lord, all ye his host, ye ministers
[22:32] of his that do his pleasure. Bless the
[22:35] Lord, all his works in all his places of
[22:38] his dominion. Bless the Lord, oh my
[22:41] soul. God bless. You may be seated,
[22:43] Brother Brian.
[22:59] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; You know, after reading a chapter like
[23:04] that, God cares about you that much. If
[23:07] you would turn with me to
[23:11] uh the Gospel of John, the the 15th
[23:15] chapter. I have to do it this way. the
[23:19] middle of my Bible is those from
[23:22] chapters like 14 to 17 and they're
[23:24] destroyed. But
[23:28] I was uh thinking this morning all all
[23:33] the
[23:35] messages that we've listened to, all the
[23:37] word of God that we've read in our
[23:39] lives. I was thinking are
[23:42] is it grounded in you this morning? Is
[23:44] the word of God completely
[23:47] taken over your heart this morning? Your
[23:49] very spirit, your soul, your flesh is
[23:52] everything possessed by the word of God
[23:54] and the spirit of Jesus Christ this
[23:56] morning. And I was thinking of the age
[23:58] that we're in this morning and the
[24:00] circumstances in the world, everything
[24:03] that goes on in our families, in our
[24:05] lives this morning. Are you grounded in
[24:08] Jesus Christ this morning? And
[24:12] are you so grounded no matter what the
[24:14] circumstances are in your family or in
[24:16] the world, no matter what they say, are
[24:20] you going to fall on your knees and
[24:22] believe Christ or are you going to
[24:24] believe the world? And I was I was I was
[24:27] just thinking this morning, I'm one of
[24:29] my
[24:31] uh a historical thing on from I seen a
[24:34] truth social post this morning. They
[24:36] were talking about this this object
[24:39] headed to the earth. And you know, I'm
[24:42] not trying to be funny this morning, but
[24:45] the reality of Jesus Christ is what I'm
[24:47] trying to say. If if an alien spaceship
[24:50] landed on the earth tomorrow morning and
[24:53] started killing human beings, would you
[24:55] still believe Jesus Christ this morning?
[24:58] If a asteroid was about to destroy, what
[25:00] would you believe? And what and not
[25:03] trying to be funny, but what I was
[25:05] really thinking about is we all have
[25:08] people in our lives that we interreact
[25:11] with every day of our lives. I'm
[25:14] thinking more in that circumstances. If
[25:16] a brother that you knew for 50 years or
[25:19] 40 years all of a sudden renounced Jesus
[25:22] Christ and walk the other way, where
[25:24] would your soul and where would your
[25:26] foundation? Would that unsettle your
[25:28] foundation? Would that unsettle your
[25:30] soul this morning? If a pastor that you
[25:33] trusted and believed all your life
[25:36] suddenly turned away from the gospel of
[25:38] Jesus Christ, would that leave you
[25:40] ungrounded? Would you have problem going
[25:44] the next day believing that Jesus It's
[25:47] to the point in the world this morning
[25:49] that you we have to be totally rooted in
[25:53] the word of God. no matter what the
[25:55] circumstances are in your family, in the
[25:58] world, or in the church that you know
[26:00] that you know that Jesus Christ is alive
[26:02] this morning. I I can't say it any other
[26:05] way that it's a late hour that we live
[26:08] in. And you know, Steve gave me this
[26:10] this morning. This is a fuel bill for
[26:12] the start of the year. Just lets me know
[26:14] something. My mind can only go back to
[26:16] the word of God is just like in Hebrews,
[26:20] we have no continuing cities here on
[26:23] this world. We have none. We look for
[26:25] one to come. So none of us this morning,
[26:28] no matter what the circumstances, we're
[26:30] each getting closer every hour, well,
[26:33] every second, every minute, every hour,
[26:35] every day, every year to that
[26:37] appointment one time. And that as I read
[26:40] the word of God and I listen to the
[26:42] message of the hour, I know that only
[26:44] thing one thing matters is is my
[26:48] relationship with Jesus Christ closer
[26:50] this morning than it was yesterday. And
[26:53] um
[26:55] it really struck me that the world is um
[26:58] falling apart. And and I know one thing
[27:01] in my own life, whatever you put before
[27:04] God, I I can tell you right now that
[27:07] he's going to pull the rug out from
[27:09] underneath it. I know in my own
[27:11] experiences in my life, if I've ever
[27:14] emphasized something so much in my life
[27:17] that I'm putting everything into it, all
[27:18] of a sudden, I know that God will pull
[27:20] the rug out for to get my attention. And
[27:23] we don't want to be that way in this
[27:24] late hour. We want our total focus this
[27:27] morning to be on the word of God and on
[27:30] Jesus Christ. We're we're unwavering in
[27:32] our faith, believing the word of God
[27:34] this morning.
[27:36] And I hadn't even read the scripture,
[27:38] but I was thinking of u the devotional
[27:40] from yesterday and and I'm not trying to
[27:44] be a comedian here this morning, but I
[27:46] was listening to the message
[27:48] from that devotional and when brother
[27:51] Brandham was talking to all the people
[27:54] in the service. Now, you know, I'm not
[27:56] an ed I'm not an educated man. Uh I have
[28:00] I don't have a degree in divinity. I
[28:02] don't have a PhD in something. But just
[28:05] think of it. Brother Brandham's talking
[28:07] to these people and he's saying is and I
[28:10] thought it was pretty. You got to
[28:12] realize when you build yourself up so
[28:14] much or you think your education gives
[28:17] you what you need to have and all of a
[28:19] sudden he says things like this. I just
[28:21] think of all those preachers that were
[28:22] in that service and he's talking like
[28:25] this. I I was just I'm not giggling. I'm
[28:28] just thinking he was talking about
[28:30] there's two types of chickens. One
[28:32] that's brooded and raised by its mother
[28:34] and one that's incubated. And brother
[28:37] Brandham was telling all these people
[28:39] just imagine you're a doctor of divinity
[28:41] out there. And he's saying that you've
[28:43] been raised in an incubator and
[28:45] everything that you've been taught is
[28:46] wrong and that you need to come God's
[28:49] way. You would say that would be a
[28:51] humiliating thing. That would rock your
[28:54] foundation. You're either going to do
[28:55] two things. you're going to get angry or
[28:58] your mind's going to open. And I thought
[29:00] it was funny, but I'll just read what
[29:01] his quote was this morning. Uh not going
[29:05] to things I always refer. I'll just read
[29:08] to what he had to say. And um he said
[29:12] Jesus would not permit his disciples to
[29:14] preach the gospel and until they receive
[29:17] the Holy Ghost. So that's really
[29:20] important. He wouldn't let them preach
[29:21] the gospel. He told them to go away
[29:24] until you're endued with power. That's
[29:26] no different in our own lives. We really
[29:28] can't be successful as Christians until
[29:31] the very presence of Jesus Christ
[29:33] possesses your heart and soul this
[29:35] morning. You're going to wind up go,
[29:37] like I say, running into circumstances
[29:40] where you can continue to fail until you
[29:43] go back to the correct foundation. He
[29:46] says, yet they have been honored to walk
[29:48] with him three and a half years. So he's
[29:50] saying
[29:52] you can be in a church for 10, 15 years,
[29:55] the same thing. Think you know it all
[29:57] that you know it, but if you ain't got
[29:59] the Holy Ghost when you need it, you
[30:01] won't have it. So they they thought they
[30:03] were holy men accepted in his sight. But
[30:06] he would not let them go preach until he
[30:08] waited up there and got all the
[30:10] differences out of them and the Holy
[30:12] Spirit came. And if you have that human
[30:16] nature, that natural nature, you're
[30:18] going to want you're going to find
[30:19] differences. You're going to have
[30:20] differences. But once you got God's
[30:23] nature, the only thing you're going to
[30:24] project to people is the true will of
[30:26] Jesus Christ. And he goes on to say
[30:29] here, what the world needs today is the
[30:31] same filling when the dumping outcomes.
[30:35] And that's what the brothers have been
[30:37] talking about a lot lately is you got to
[30:40] be completely empty to be filled. You
[30:42] know, you can't fill an old vessel with
[30:44] with something new or it's not going to
[30:46] work. And it's so important this morning
[30:49] that I know in my own life, you got to
[30:51] be totally empty so God can possess it
[30:54] this morning. If it needs a filling,
[30:56] what does the filling do when it comes
[30:58] in where you have doubt? And that's the
[31:02] problem with the world this morning.
[31:03] There's so much out there to give you
[31:04] doubt. It brings faith. Where you have
[31:07] indifference, it brings love. And that
[31:09] really speaks to the age that we live
[31:11] this morning. There's so much
[31:12] indifference out there in the world this
[31:15] morning. It's hard for people to be to
[31:18] show love anymore. There's so much
[31:20] indifference, so much hate, so much, you
[31:23] know, people just the wrong spirit. It
[31:25] brings love where you had hatred. It
[31:28] brings fellowship. You know, that's a
[31:30] Christian, those are Christian virtues
[31:32] there. Those should be coming, you know,
[31:35] out of us every day of our lives. love
[31:38] fellowship and when the church of the
[31:40] living God someday will be united under
[31:43] one great head that that will be the
[31:46] head of God. God in you in a unity of
[31:49] the body of Christ and we will we will
[31:53] be the governor and the king and the
[31:57] and king and lord over the entire church
[31:59] under his control and she will be
[32:01] received up and I'll just sit down here
[32:04] in a few minutes. I didn't want to be up
[32:07] here and not read a few scriptures this
[32:09] morning out of God's word. Yeah. And I
[32:12] you all know I spent a lot of time I I
[32:15] love the Gospel of John. I I read it all
[32:17] the time. I But I'll just read what
[32:20] Jesus said in the 15th chapter. A few
[32:22] verses here.
[32:24] Um but I was just thinking what I said
[32:28] in the beginning. No matter what
[32:30] happened out there in the world this
[32:31] morning,
[32:33] whatever circumstances are out there in
[32:35] the world, if it's totally opposite of
[32:38] what you been told in the world, are you
[32:41] going to believe the word of God or are
[32:43] you going to believe the circumstances?
[32:45] So, I'm all I can do is speak for
[32:47] myself. No matter what happens out
[32:49] there, I'm going to believe God's word
[32:51] over everything.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; And that that's our obligation as
[32:54] Christians. I'll just read what Jesus
[32:57] had to say. And we all know this 15th
[32:59] chapter. I am the true vine and my
[33:02] father is the husbandman. I have to do
[33:04] it this way nowadays too because when I
[33:06] try to read it up here I lo I lose the
[33:09] words sometimes.
[33:11] Every branch in me that beareth not
[33:12] fruit he taketh away. Every branch that
[33:15] beareth fruit he purge it. So God's
[33:17] going to purge you. You know God's going
[33:20] to make you better than tomorrow than
[33:22] you were today. God should have an o
[33:25] over his hand completely over your life
[33:28] making you better. He'll purge it. He'll
[33:31] bring forth more fruit. As God deals
[33:33] with you, he'll bring more fruit out of
[33:35] your life. Now you are clean through the
[33:38] word which I have spoken on you. And my
[33:40] own thought comes out of reading that
[33:42] third verse. If you're not in the word,
[33:45] you're not going to be clean by the
[33:46] word. So you can't have one with the
[33:48] other. You can't stay clean in this
[33:50] world or clean in this life unless
[33:52] you're abiding in the word of God. Abide
[33:55] in me and I in you and the branch cannot
[33:57] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[33:59] the vine. No more can you except you
[34:01] abide in me. So everything's based on
[34:04] that relationship this morning. And I am
[34:07] the vine and you are the branches. He
[34:09] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[34:11] bringeth forth much fruit. Without me
[34:14] you can do nothing. And I'll read a
[34:17] couple more. And if a man abideth not in
[34:20] me, he is cast forth as a branch and is
[34:22] withered and men gather him and cast him
[34:24] into the fire and they are burned. If
[34:27] you abide in me and my words abide in
[34:29] you, you shall ask what you will and it
[34:31] shall be done unto you. And I know there
[34:33] are many people here that have needs
[34:36] this morning. And this scriptures is in
[34:39] just as real right now as it was 2,000
[34:41] years ago. Here is my father glorified.
[34:45] And this is God's desire for all of us.
[34:47] He wants you to bear fruit. He wants you
[34:50] to be a
[34:53] what what's the best you know the
[34:55] example brother Brham gave about the two
[34:57] calves one was fed good and the other
[34:59] one wasn't. Well, he wants you to be the
[35:01] one that's fed good this morning. Here
[35:04] in my father is glorified that you bear
[35:06] much fruit. So you shall be my
[35:08] disciples. And he go and I'll finish
[35:10] with this. As the father have loved me
[35:13] so I have loved you. Continue in my
[35:16] love. And this is really I I won't read
[35:18] that 10th verse. I keep saying I'm going
[35:20] to stop and I don't. But I do know one
[35:23] thing.
[35:25] God's commandments aren't grievious for
[35:28] us to do. He's just simply asking us to
[35:31] perform his word, love his word, and do
[35:33] his word. And like I started this
[35:35] morning, the really the only way you can
[35:38] do it with love and understanding is you
[35:40] got to have that baptism of the Holy
[35:42] Ghost. You have to have that experience
[35:45] in Jesus Christ this morning. Brother
[35:47] David,
[36:04] &gt;&gt; man, it's good to be here this morning.
[36:06] Let's stand and let's sing I'm redeemed.
[36:08] Bought with a price.
[36:11] [Music]
[36:13] Well, I am redeemed.
[36:18] I'm bought with a price.
[36:23] And Jesus
[36:26] has changed my whole life.
[36:33] If anybody
[36:35] asks you
[36:38] just who I am,
[36:42] oh tell them
[36:45] I am redeemed.
[36:49] [Music]
[36:51] And where there was hate,
[36:56] love now abides.
[37:01] Where there was confusion,
[37:05] peace now reigns.
[37:07] [Music]
[37:10] I'm walking
[37:12] with Jesus.
[37:15] I'm a child of the King.
[37:19] And it's all because
[37:22] I am redeemed.
[37:28] For I am redeemed.
[37:33] I've been bought with a price.
[37:39] Jesus
[37:40] has changed my whole life.
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] If anybody
[37:50] asks you
[37:52] just who I am,
[37:57] you tell them
[37:59] I am redeemed.
[38:05] And all tell of
[38:08] his favor.
[38:10] All tell of his love.
[38:15] I'll tell of his goodness to me.
[38:21] [Music]
[38:24] He purchased
[38:26] my redemption
[38:29] with his preious
[38:32] blood
[38:33] and from sin
[38:36] he set me free.
[38:42] Oh, I am redeemed.
[38:47] I've been bought with a price.
[38:52] Jesus
[38:54] has changed my whole life.
[39:04] And he asks you
[39:06] just who I am.
[39:11] Tell them
[39:13] I am redeemed
[39:20] and my God is awesome.
[39:25] He can move mountains,
[39:29] keep me in the valley
[39:34] and hide me from the rain.
[39:39] My God is awesome.

[43:46] on history,
[43:48] see the mighty God
[43:51] unveiled,
[43:54] proving
[43:55] over and over
[43:58] that his words can never fail.

[44:38] too many
[44:40] to tell.
[44:43] The same God
[44:45] who parted
[44:48] the raging
[44:50] red sea.
[44:54] Oh, he's the same God
[44:57] who's living
[44:59] in me.
[45:02] [Music]
[45:04] And the same God who created
[45:09] all the heavens and all the earth
[45:14] and came back living in Jesus.
[45:18] There was power
[45:21] in his word.
[45:23] But now in these last days, I'm
[45:28] beginning
[45:30] to see.
[45:34] Oh, he's the same God
[45:37] who's living in me.
[45:42] [Music]
[45:43] Oh, the same God who spoke to
[45:49] the woman at
[45:51] the well.
[45:54] The same God whose wonders
[45:58] too many
[46:00] to tell.
[46:03] The same God
[46:05] who parted
[46:08] the raging
[46:10] red sea.

[47:19] of strength when I am weak.
[47:27] That takes me through.
[47:31] When life is pressing me,
[47:39] I have a source
[47:43] of power
[47:45] from above.
[47:50] Oh, I'm covered
[47:53] over
[47:56] by a shield of blood.
[48:02] Oh, I claim the blood
[48:07] Jesus shed on Calary.

[48:31] my sickness,
[48:34] and my pain.
[48:39] When I need healing,

[48:56] how others
[48:58] make it through.
[49:03] who never go
[49:07] to Calary
[49:10] as I do.
[49:15] For there's a clay
[49:19] seen healing stream which flows
[49:27] with peace that only
[49:32] his redeemed can do.
[49:39] I claim the blood
[49:43] Jesus shed on Calary.
[49:51] Those precious blood stains
[49:55] were made there just for me.
[50:03] for all my sins,
[50:07] my sickness,

[59:38] continue our series this morning. Amen.
[59:40] What is that in your hand? Amen. This
[59:43] morning, um,
[59:46] and I think I had a I had a uh little
[59:50] subtitle, I think, fire starters
[59:54] Wednesday. And I certainly didn't get
[59:56] through my sermon, but Amen.
[1:00:00] We're going to title give it a subtitle.
[1:00:02] Fire starter starters. God of the
[1:00:04] unusual. God of the unusual. Amen.
[1:00:10] Amen. Let's go before the author.
[1:00:13] Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord,
[1:00:15] knowing God that all scripture is given
[1:00:18] by inspiration of you. is for do
[1:00:21] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[1:00:23] instruction in righteousness Lord and we
[1:00:25] just ask God that you'll just bless the
[1:00:27] reading of the word this morning the
[1:00:28] meditation of our heart father and most
[1:00:31] of all we ask God that you'd help me
[1:00:32] just to get it out of the way that
[1:00:34] you'll use the gift Lord Jesus and just
[1:00:36] speak to your people what you once said
[1:00:38] this morning Lord my heart's desire
[1:00:41] father is Lord Jesus that this word that
[1:00:43] we speak Lord that it would be a word
[1:00:46] that is in time and for we know that
[1:00:49] that is precious, Lord Jesus, when we
[1:00:51] have a word that is in time, Lord. And
[1:00:54] Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for
[1:00:56] each one, Father, that is feeling well
[1:00:58] today, Lord. Those that haven't been
[1:01:00] feeling well, that are feeling better,
[1:01:01] Lord. We thank you so much. Amen. For
[1:01:04] Sister Parish this morning. Thank you,
[1:01:06] Lord, that she's feeling better, doing a
[1:01:08] little better, Lord. And we just ask,
[1:01:09] God, that you just continue to help her
[1:01:11] to scale that height of health again,
[1:01:14] Lord. And Lord, we want to just thank
[1:01:16] you for the healing that you provide for
[1:01:17] each and every one of us, both
[1:01:19] physically and spiritually, Lord. And if
[1:01:21] there's any spiritually sick this
[1:01:22] morning, we ask, God, that you would
[1:01:25] heal that sickness, Lord. For we know
[1:01:27] that that would be more important than
[1:01:29] physical healing, Lord. So we come
[1:01:31] before you, Lord. Our hearts are open,
[1:01:33] our minds are open, and Lord, and we
[1:01:35] sing yes, yes, Lord, to your will and to
[1:01:38] your way. And Father, that'll certainly
[1:01:40] come into our message this morning. for
[1:01:42] sometimes it's easier for us to say no
[1:01:44] and to doubt than it is to say yes. So
[1:01:47] we ask God that you'll bless the reading
[1:01:49] of the word, Lord. And we thank you,
[1:01:50] Lord Jesus, for Wednesday night service,
[1:01:52] God. And we ask now, Father, that you'll
[1:01:55] give us a fresh outpouring this morning
[1:01:57] of your word in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:02:00] Amen. And amen. Amen. Turn your Bibles
[1:02:03] if you will, and we'll read the
[1:02:04] scripture once again. Amen. In Numbers
[1:02:08] 16. Numbers 16
[1:02:11] and verse 29.
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:18] No, it's not numbers. I'm sorry. Not.
[1:02:21] It's Exodus 4.
[1:02:24] Exodus 4.
[1:02:27] And I don't know just how long I'll go.
[1:02:31] Amen. On this little series of what is
[1:02:33] that in your hand? But basically the my
[1:02:36] thought is what is that in our hand?
[1:02:40] Amen. What have we got in our hand?
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows? We could talk
[1:02:45] about that for a while. Ain't that
[1:02:47] right? What has the Lord given us in our
[1:02:50] hands?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. To whom much is given, much will
[1:02:55] be required. And how many knows we've
[1:02:56] been given a lot?
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, yeah. I mean, we're
[1:03:02] talking about more than anybody has ever
[1:03:04] been given.
[1:03:06] Amen. Sure, Paul had the revelation of
[1:03:09] Christ and he brought that revelation,
[1:03:10] but he didn't have the revelation of the
[1:03:12] book of Revelations.
[1:03:14] Nobody knew that. Not until the opening
[1:03:17] of the seals. Isn't that right? Took
[1:03:19] seven angels coming down. Even brother
[1:03:21] Brandham had it wrong in his room. Amen.
[1:03:24] That angel turned his mind and showed
[1:03:26] him. So, Amen. That's what you and I
[1:03:28] have in our hands. Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Well, well, well. We could just go on
[1:03:34] and on and on. Amen. I believe that we
[1:03:36] have in our hand what it's going to take
[1:03:38] to get us out of here. Amen. I believe
[1:03:41] that we have in our hand the ability to
[1:03:43] believe every word. Amen. To take us
[1:03:45] back where Eve took us from by doubting
[1:03:48] one word. Amen.
[1:03:51] Oh my. Amen. I was on the road. on the
[1:03:54] road.
[1:04:02] On the road, I was thinking how that
[1:04:05] we're blessed people because every
[1:04:07] church age fell into a cycle of death.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Every age. So, we're going to break that
[1:04:15] president, right?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to uh break that president
[1:04:20] and we're not going to fall. We have a
[1:04:22] scriptures quotes that says she's not
[1:04:25] going to fall. Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Talk about fire starters.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; How many believe we got a fire started
[1:04:32] in in Malachi 4. Amen. The pillar of
[1:04:36] fire started. Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Through the prophet of God. He was a God
[1:04:40] used him to start a fire. Went around
[1:04:43] the world seven times with that fire.
[1:04:47] And did that fire burn out?
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Is it still burning? Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, that's right. It's still
[1:04:54] burning right here. And it's going to
[1:04:56] burn. It's going to burn all the way to
[1:04:58] the end. Amen. I'm thankful for that.
[1:05:00] So, you talk about starting a fire. We
[1:05:02] know that even Billy uh Graham, I think
[1:05:05] or Roberts and those great men, they all
[1:05:07] admitted that brother Brandham's
[1:05:09] ministry spearheaded to revival of the
[1:05:12] 19th century. That was the spearhead.
[1:05:14] It's the one that led the revival of
[1:05:17] Tommy Hicks and all these other
[1:05:18] brothers. Amen.
[1:05:21] So you talk about getting the fire
[1:05:22] started. I'm thankful for to be a part
[1:05:24] of it. Amen.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's read in Exodus 4 and
[1:05:29] uh verse one and a couple of I think one
[1:05:32] and two. And Moses answered and said,
[1:05:35] "But behold, they will not believe me,
[1:05:38] nor hearken unto my voice, for they will
[1:05:40] say, the Lord hath not appeared unto
[1:05:43] thee." And the Lord said unto him, "What
[1:05:45] is that in thine hand?" And he said, "A
[1:05:48] rod." Amen. And of course, we know what
[1:05:50] God did to uh with that. Ain't that
[1:05:52] right? But what is that in your hand?
[1:05:53] Amen. And we know that David, all he had
[1:05:56] in his hand was a sling and five smooth
[1:05:59] stones. But when God got in it,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will use stones. He'll use
[1:06:04] sticks. It just Brother Ram says, it was
[1:06:07] just some stick that he picked up out
[1:06:09] there in the desert somewhere. It was
[1:06:10] nothing special. But Amen. But after he
[1:06:14] met the pillar of fire, Amen. God
[1:06:17] ordained that. Then it became a special
[1:06:18] stick. But Abraham said it became the
[1:06:20] actual judgment rod for Egypt. That's
[1:06:23] right. God's judgment rod. Amen. And of
[1:06:26] course, we know that that sling became a
[1:06:28] judgment rod to the giant. Ain't that
[1:06:30] right? Amen. Shear the ox goat. Little
[1:06:33] old ox goat. Something sticking in the
[1:06:35] corner of the building there. Amen.
[1:06:38] Amen. Mix that with a little faith.
[1:06:40] Ain't that right? And he grabbed a hold
[1:06:41] of that. Went out there and killed 600
[1:06:43] Philistines. Amen.
[1:06:46] Amen. God will take little things, does
[1:06:50] things in unusual ways. Bring this down
[1:06:52] a little bit. Amen. Ma uh Matthew, one
[1:06:55] more scripture. Matthew
[1:06:58] 9.
[1:07:01] Maybe I'll go ahead and read my third
[1:07:03] scriptures. I only have three or four of
[1:07:05] them today. Don't have very many. I
[1:07:06] thought I was just going to have this
[1:07:07] one one scripture here and that was it.
[1:07:10] But I wanted to read what we started out
[1:07:12] with just in case I mean somebody
[1:07:15] perhaps out there hasn't seen where we
[1:07:17] were coming from or where we're going.
[1:07:19] Amen. Matthew 9:17 says, "Neither do men
[1:07:23] put new wine into old bottles, else
[1:07:26] those bottles break, and the wine runth
[1:07:29] out, and the bottles perish, but they
[1:07:32] put new wine into new bottles, and both
[1:07:35] are preserved." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:39] First Corinthians 1 Corinthians I want
[1:07:41] to read that one yet and then we'll
[1:07:46] go on. 1 Corinthians 1
[1:07:49] and verse
[1:07:52] 25
[1:07:54] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[1:07:57] than men and the w the the weakness of
[1:07:59] God is stronger than men. For we see
[1:08:02] your calling, brethren, how that not
[1:08:04] many wise men after the flesh. Not many
[1:08:06] mighty, not many noble are called. But
[1:08:09] God has chosen the foolish things of the
[1:08:11] world to confound the wise. And God has
[1:08:13] chosen the weak things of the world to
[1:08:15] confound the things which are mighty.
[1:08:18] And the base things of the world, and
[1:08:21] things which are despised, has God
[1:08:23] chosen, yay, the things which are not,
[1:08:25] to bring to not things that are. Amen.
[1:08:29] So we see here how that God has chosen
[1:08:31] the foolish things of the world to
[1:08:32] confound a wise. Back up in verse 18 of
[1:08:36] the same chapter there it says, "For the
[1:08:40] preaching of the cross is to them that
[1:08:42] perish foolishness."
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But unto us which are saved, it is
[1:08:48] the power of God. Amen. Somebody's glad
[1:08:50] for preaching.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. To the world it
[1:08:53] might seem foolish, but to us it's the
[1:08:55] very power of God. God takes the
[1:08:57] foolishness of preaching to save those
[1:08:59] that believe. May God add his blessings
[1:09:01] to the reading. You can be seated this
[1:09:03] morning.
[1:09:07] Amen. Amen. I will say that this has
[1:09:10] probably been the shortest study I've
[1:09:12] done. Amen. On for a while. Amen. So,
[1:09:16] thank you for your prayers. I sat down
[1:09:18] yesterday not knowing just where I was
[1:09:20] going to go really and and and uh I
[1:09:23] started looking over my notes of what I
[1:09:25] where I had been and so forth and the
[1:09:27] Lord just began to pour it out. Amen.
[1:09:29] And I did a did a little uh I don't know
[1:09:33] what you call it little notes on the
[1:09:35] side, you know, before I get my main
[1:09:37] notes before I knew I had a whole page.
[1:09:39] And I said, "Well, I don't want to
[1:09:40] rewrite all that. I'll just bring my
[1:09:42] yellow tablet out and we'll do it the
[1:09:44] oldfashioned way." Amen. But anyway, so
[1:09:47] I like that when the Lord just begins to
[1:09:49] pour it out and just Amen. just uh gives
[1:09:51] us something to preach. Amen. So, praise
[1:09:54] the Lord. Certainly enjoyed Wednesday
[1:09:56] night. Amen. Brother Brad does a
[1:09:57] wonderful job, don't he? Amen. With the
[1:09:59] help of course of God, just as I need it
[1:10:01] also. Amen. Now, we want to start and
[1:10:04] just by God's with God's help and grace
[1:10:06] and want to Amen. and just see what the
[1:10:09] Lord will what the Lord will really
[1:10:10] where he'll all go with us. But we know
[1:10:12] that God does things in unusual ways.
[1:10:16] Amen. Uh I didn't pull the quote up, but
[1:10:19] brother B said one place he he was
[1:10:21] saying he says, you know, people will
[1:10:22] make the statement. He says, "Well,
[1:10:24] that's unusual."
[1:10:26] And he says, "Well, that's where God
[1:10:28] is."
[1:10:30] That's where God is. God is in the
[1:10:32] unusual or uh uh I want to use the worst
[1:10:36] pres unprecedented. I and I've learned
[1:10:39] this word I guess because of our uh
[1:10:41] justice systems and everything else they
[1:10:43] have a president they have a set ways if
[1:10:45] they they do things and when you do
[1:10:47] something different than that's
[1:10:49] unprecedented and amen it's not the
[1:10:52] usual it's not what you usually do.
[1:10:55] Amen. And God is that way. Amen. So as
[1:10:59] we begin to look at this we want to look
[1:11:01] Amen. First, let me just read the quote.
[1:11:03] Brother Bam says, "Now, we think of how
[1:11:05] God does things in unusual ways."
[1:11:10] Amen. And I want to say also that he
[1:11:11] does things in new ways or different
[1:11:15] ways.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I also want to say that uh
[1:11:22] that humanity, we as as as people,
[1:11:28] it's so important that we understand a
[1:11:31] little bit of how God operates,
[1:11:33] what he's like. Ain't that right? Uh and
[1:11:37] what he requires.
[1:11:39] Amen. And I believe that this message
[1:11:42] that God has sent in our day has really
[1:11:44] given us a real understanding. It's been
[1:11:46] a real in book of instruction. It's been
[1:11:49] instructions on our life.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; How many believes that
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; it is instruction? And if you don't
[1:11:56] follow those instructions, how many
[1:11:58] knows most of the times when you don't
[1:12:00] follow the instructions, what happens?
[1:12:03] Chaos ensues.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the
[1:12:08] people's lives are in chaos is because
[1:12:10] they don't read the instructions. When
[1:12:13] they get it together, the back wheels on
[1:12:15] the front, the handlebars are upside
[1:12:17] down. The chain won't fit. Hello. You
[1:12:20] forgot the sprockets. There's no
[1:12:22] sprockets for the chain. And oh my, you
[1:12:24] can't go nowhere. The only thing you can
[1:12:26] do is push the thing around. That's
[1:12:28] about the way people's lives are. You're
[1:12:30] pushing here and pushing there. It's a
[1:12:32] sweat. It's terrible.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; But God expects his people, God expects
[1:12:39] humanity to have faith. Amen. He don't
[1:12:42] expect you to be smart. He don't expect
[1:12:44] you to be educated.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He don't expect you to be intellectual.
[1:12:49] You don't have to have the college
[1:12:51] degree. He's not expecting any of that.
[1:12:53] When he chose his disciples, he chose
[1:12:56] people that couldn't sign their own
[1:12:58] name. He took the foolish things of the
[1:13:01] world to confound the wise. Amen. When
[1:13:04] that lame man walked, when Peter prayed
[1:13:06] for him, they had to take note that they
[1:13:08] had been with Jesus.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they know somebody. They're in
[1:13:13] contact with somebody. And I believe
[1:13:15] that's the way it is with the believer
[1:13:17] this morning. That's the way we are
[1:13:18] supposed to be in contact with somebody.
[1:13:21] And that is the maker. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:25] Amen. So he says God does things in
[1:13:29] unusual ways
[1:13:33] because he is unusual himself.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is unusual.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the supernatural infinite.
[1:13:52] So anything he does is unusual. God is
[1:13:55] so great till he takes the unad
[1:13:58] identified things of the earth to
[1:14:00] identify himself by
[1:14:03] why he was preaching on why little
[1:14:05] Bethlehem. He says that's what we want
[1:14:07] to talk on God taking the things of the
[1:14:09] world because the scripture says by the
[1:14:11] foolishness of preaching it's please God
[1:14:14] to save them that believe. Ain't that
[1:14:16] right? Oh my. Now notice here. And we
[1:14:21] think it's good. God glorifies it. Now
[1:14:23] you pardon me. Amen. So is it today the
[1:14:26] story of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] today upon the earth
[1:14:31] in the church is so unusual to the
[1:14:34] organization and the denominational
[1:14:36] mind. They don't want to believe it.
[1:14:41] It's too unusual.
[1:14:43] It's too fantastic. Amen. The Bible said
[1:14:46] that it would be that way. He says,
[1:14:48] "Many man has been tied up in some
[1:14:51] creed. Really wants to believe that, but
[1:14:53] it's so unusual. He just can't hardly
[1:14:56] tell it." Amen. He don't know what to
[1:14:59] do. He's in a predicament like Joseph
[1:15:01] was. And we'll get into that later. But
[1:15:03] let's talk about this unusual and how
[1:15:05] that God is in the unusual.
[1:15:09] Amen.
[1:15:14] Down further. One more. One more quote
[1:15:15] here. I know I had another one. He says
[1:15:17] that's where God dwells and that's where
[1:15:20] God dwells in the unusual to the carnal
[1:15:24] mind.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:29] It's the unusual things that make him
[1:15:32] God. He goes to the unusual. He makes
[1:15:35] things unusual to the people. Yes, sir.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:41] So, get ready.
[1:15:44] One thing we learned as message
[1:15:45] believers is God dwells in simplicity.
[1:15:48] Aren't you glad?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because people are always looking
[1:15:51] for great things. It's got to be great,
[1:15:53] great, great, great, great. No, God is
[1:15:54] in humility and he is in simplicity.
[1:15:58] Amen. Hides himself in simplicity.
[1:16:05] Brother Brandham preached a message and
[1:16:06] I didn't do you any study on it or get
[1:16:08] any pull quotes from it but you remember
[1:16:11] in the junction of time brother Brandham
[1:16:13] says it's at the junction of time that
[1:16:15] God always does the supernatural.
[1:16:18] Amen. He talked about a mason and how
[1:16:21] that anybody perhaps can lo lay block
[1:16:23] down that straight wall but when you
[1:16:26] come to a corner and you have to turn a
[1:16:28] corner that's a different story.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many know God turns a lot
[1:16:34] of corners?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not all just a straight wall.
[1:16:39] No. How many knows the first one, Amen,
[1:16:42] that we want to talk about for just a
[1:16:43] minute was Noah.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:16:49] God did something very unusual.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Very unusual. The life was just going
[1:16:56] on. People were living their lives. They
[1:16:58] were building. They were marrying and
[1:17:00] giving in marriage, eating and drinking
[1:17:03] and everything was going like usual.
[1:17:07] Everything was so usual. There was no
[1:17:10] man the dew would come down so heavy at
[1:17:12] night and that it would water they
[1:17:15] needed. They never had a thunderstorm.
[1:17:18] They never had a tornado. They never had
[1:17:20] rain to come down out of the sky.
[1:17:23] I can't imagine that. Can you? That
[1:17:25] would be unprecedented.
[1:17:28] That's right. But guess what? One day,
[1:17:31] God come down and talked to Noah and
[1:17:33] said, "Noah, I want you to build an ark
[1:17:36] because the people have gotten wicked."
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there for a minute.
[1:17:43] Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Wouldn't we be a
[1:17:46] bunch of smart humans if we could just
[1:17:48] learn from history?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; But we stupid, we are stupid humans.
[1:18:00] Let me tell you something. Humanity is
[1:18:02] the most ignorant, stupid thing that
[1:18:04] I've ever met.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; They can be given warning.
[1:18:12] They can see the thunderstor clouds
[1:18:13] come, but they won't take any action.
[1:18:16] They can be told. They can be
[1:18:17] vindicated. It can be proven, and they
[1:18:19] still won't believe it. How dumb is
[1:18:21] that?
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; You say stupid. Yeah, I mean it.
[1:18:27] blind. Isn't that right? I mean, Jesus
[1:18:31] can raise Lazarus from the dead.
[1:18:33] Nicodemus says, "We know that you're
[1:18:35] cleansed from God because of nobody but
[1:18:37] God. Somebody somebody from God could do
[1:18:39] that, but we still don't believe."
[1:18:43] In other words, if you go to hell,
[1:18:45] you're going to go stupid because you
[1:18:47] jumped over every barricade, every stop
[1:18:49] sign, everything God put there to stop
[1:18:51] you and you crawled your way to hell.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And you ain't going to get over there
[1:18:57] and say, "Well, God, you're to blame."
[1:18:58] No, he says it's your stupidity. It's
[1:19:00] your ignorance. It's your own
[1:19:02] selfishness that got you there.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:12] See, the fear of the Lord is the
[1:19:15] beginning of getting smart.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're stupid. You're dumb.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to put it that way.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz even God himself said a fool. A fool
[1:19:30] called you a not stupid. You're a fool.
[1:19:34] A fool says in his heart there is no
[1:19:36] God.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. My
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; hello.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; So Lord help us.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] Hallelujah. How many believes? Where is
[1:19:50] the wise? Where is the disputer of the
[1:19:52] world? Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; God is the only one that's wise and he
[1:19:56] gives you wisdom.
[1:20:02] Young fellas, stay on the right course
[1:20:05] because I'm here to tell you this man
[1:20:07] probably here would be dead in the grave
[1:20:09] if God didn't give me a little bit of
[1:20:10] wisdom.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; If he didn't save my soul and help me to
[1:20:14] think, right, Tommy back there, right?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't no telling. It's It's a miracle
[1:20:19] we're here, right? Especially him.
[1:20:24] That's right.
[1:20:26] Do things come close to death. wrecks
[1:20:28] and drugs and everything else.
[1:20:32] But that's the grace of God.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You got to jump a little. Say, "Thank
[1:20:36] you, Jesus. I'm glad I'm here. It was
[1:20:39] you that watched out for me."
[1:20:43] Anyway, that was not on the script at
[1:20:45] all. Maybe somebody needed that, but I
[1:20:47] just felt like saying that. Humanity. I
[1:20:49] don't have too much confidence in
[1:20:50] humanity. They don't even listen to
[1:20:52] their maker. They even don't even
[1:20:54] acknowledge they have a maker. Anybody
[1:20:57] that can look at the world and should
[1:20:58] know, hey, there's got to be somebody
[1:21:00] doing that.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And then you want to say,
[1:21:03] "No, nobody's doing that. It was just by
[1:21:06] chance." There's only one word for you,
[1:21:08] and I'm not going to say it again.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:21:20] How many wants to be smart?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Then read this. This will make you
[1:21:25] smart. Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; This will give you wisdom.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. This will keep you alive.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Young people. Amen. Oh, obey your
[1:21:35] parents in the Lord for this is right
[1:21:37] that you may live long upon the earth
[1:21:39] there. That's some good instructions
[1:21:40] right there. That's right. Go the other
[1:21:42] way and see how long you last. Not a
[1:21:45] good road.
[1:21:47] Amen. Praise the Lord, Noah. That's
[1:21:51] right. Something never happened. He
[1:21:53] said, "It's going to rain this whole
[1:21:55] place. It's going to rain till it's
[1:21:56] going to go beyond the highest mountain.
[1:21:58] It's going to rain."
[1:22:01] It seemed foolish to the carnal mind.
[1:22:05] It's unusual. Now, it had never happened
[1:22:07] before.
[1:22:10] I don't know that anybody had ever
[1:22:11] walked on water before, but Jesus did.
[1:22:15] He does things that's unusual.
[1:22:18] He can do anything.
[1:22:20] Ain't nobody that I know of ever created
[1:22:23] squirrels before, but I believe it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Stop the bull. Stop the horn and stop
[1:22:29] the storm.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hello. It was unusual. People have a
[1:22:33] hard time believing it.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; But told the story of, "Hey, I seen my
[1:22:39] dog there. The one that got poisoned. I
[1:22:41] seen my horse come up with nicker and
[1:22:43] give me some sugar. My dog come up by my
[1:22:46] side. Oh my, I hear my horse." Now,
[1:22:48] somebody said, "Brother B, I believe
[1:22:49] you're sorry until you talk about a
[1:22:50] horse being in heaven. Heaven ain't for
[1:22:51] no horses."
[1:22:53] Huh?
[1:22:55] Somebody stupid.
[1:23:00] [Laughter]
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, "Okay, well, what about
[1:23:06] what those horses that came and got
[1:23:08] Elijah? What about the Bible that says
[1:23:10] when he comes from the heavens of
[1:23:11] heaven, him and all the hosts of heaven
[1:23:13] are going to come on white horses?" Shut
[1:23:15] up. Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Blew him away, didn't he?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Bible talks about all
[1:23:25] kinds of horses.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; But what is it? Let me tell you
[1:23:29] something. Our preconceived ideas
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; will not allow us to accept the unusual.
[1:23:38] We are so usual and such a trend until
[1:23:41] we can't accept when God does something
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; off the books, so to speak,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; out of the our regular. Oh, God, help
[1:23:50] us. Help something unusual to happen
[1:23:53] here this morning.
[1:23:57] Why? Cuz if God is here, there's no
[1:23:59] telling what might happen.
[1:24:10] I like to just look around, man. Be
[1:24:12] expecting something unusual to happen. I
[1:24:15] mean, we got God here, you know. Ain't
[1:24:16] no telling what might happen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Sinners might come to God. People might
[1:24:23] repent and get baptized in the name of
[1:24:25] Jesus Christ. Hello. You never know.
[1:24:27] Somebody might come to the altar. Oh
[1:24:29] God, fill me with your spirit.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; This place might become smoky. Who
[1:24:34] knows? We might see a pillar of fire.
[1:24:36] There just ain't no telling what might
[1:24:38] happen.
[1:24:42] [Applause]
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] Oh my.
[1:24:56] I'm thankful
[1:25:02] that so many men God has brought along
[1:25:06] that have what we phrase as paved the
[1:25:09] way for us.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; In other words, like paving a road. They
[1:25:13] paved the way for you.
[1:25:16] Brother Bams call it, you know, those
[1:25:18] people that was even before him, maybe
[1:25:21] Luther and Wesley and Pentecost, they
[1:25:24] all come did things that hadn't been
[1:25:26] done before.
[1:25:28] The restoration of the gifts, they
[1:25:30] hadn't been done before, but it
[1:25:31] happened.
[1:25:33] Amen. Even the baptism in Jesus' name,
[1:25:36] Acts 2:38, everything with father, son,
[1:25:39] the holy ghost before then. Amen. and
[1:25:42] pave the way.
[1:25:45] Amen. But I want to say that we're still
[1:25:48] we're still in uncharted territory.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; In other words, it hasn't been mapped
[1:25:54] out.
[1:25:56] Uncharted.
[1:25:58] We're still in new places.
[1:26:03] I believe it. Solomon said that there's
[1:26:05] nothing that hadn't been before and so
[1:26:07] forth. And I thought, well, how can we
[1:26:08] be uncharted territory if there's
[1:26:11] nothing happening hasn't happened
[1:26:12] before? We're at the end of the world.
[1:26:14] Yeah, Noah was at the end of the world.
[1:26:15] Sure, but it was different. Why? Because
[1:26:18] then God just overflowed the earth with
[1:26:21] water.
[1:26:22] He just washed it off with water. You
[1:26:24] and I are not at that place.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We're at the place, Amen, better call it
[1:26:30] the end times. We're at the end of the
[1:26:32] end when God is going to take this whole
[1:26:34] thing and he's going to change it. He's
[1:26:37] going to lift the curse this time. The
[1:26:39] curse wasn't lifted last time. He's
[1:26:41] going to lift the curse. Amen. We're
[1:26:42] going to go out into a millennium.
[1:26:44] There's going to be an ushering in of
[1:26:46] the millennium.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; We're going to go out on a new heaven
[1:26:51] and a new earth. We're going to We're
[1:26:52] here at the end of the world
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; as we know it.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Living in a Satan's Eden, most evil age
[1:27:00] that there ever was. And yet at the same
[1:27:03] time, living in the most brightest hour
[1:27:05] there ever was.
[1:27:11] Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Unusual. We're in an unusual place.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; This is not where we are usually.
[1:27:20] Sure, it was wicked. Sure, it's a lot
[1:27:22] the same, but yet it's a little
[1:27:24] different.
[1:27:26] Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me. I'm going to try this
[1:27:29] fan a little bit. Would that be all
[1:27:31] right? If it don't make you too too if
[1:27:34] it's not too much noise. Amen.
[1:27:39] We'll see if we can do that right there.
[1:27:43] Thank you, Jesus, for our fan.
[1:27:46] Amen. Last Sunday, I was just drenched
[1:27:48] in sweat and kind of running down. I
[1:27:50] says, "Well, why do you want to do that
[1:27:51] when they make perfectly good batteries
[1:27:53] and fans?" You know, it just isn't quite
[1:27:55] hot cold enough up here for me. Amen.
[1:27:58] Amen. But anyway, so praise the Lord. So
[1:28:01] look, there's one Noah
[1:28:04] unusual.
[1:28:08] And like brother Bram said, talking
[1:28:11] about the power of the Holy Ghost upon
[1:28:12] the earth is so unusual that the
[1:28:15] organizations can't comprehend it.
[1:28:20] They just can't grasp it.
[1:28:23] And I've thought about different times
[1:28:25] that I've tried to witness to people and
[1:28:27] you'll talk and you'll give them and
[1:28:29] you'll tell them about the acts of the
[1:28:31] prophet. Hello. You tell them about the
[1:28:34] pillar of fire and how that that's the
[1:28:37] only picture that was taken.
[1:28:40] Hello. And you begin to testify the
[1:28:42] power of God and people shrug back.
[1:28:44] What?
[1:28:46] Cuz how many know people have a hard
[1:28:47] time believing that God sent a prophet.
[1:28:51] It's so unusual
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; and it really blows them their mind when
[1:28:56] he says organization and denomination he
[1:28:59] condemned all of it. He brought us back
[1:29:00] to the word. He had thus said the Lord
[1:29:04] and you tell them story after story.
[1:29:07] Amen. Or a prophet visits South Africa
[1:29:11] and a lot of Amish a lot of folks will
[1:29:12] just look at the man and oh he's got a
[1:29:14] necktie on. That ain't no God man of
[1:29:15] God.
[1:29:17] Is that right Woody? You got a neck tie
[1:29:20] on that ain't no man of God. Get it away
[1:29:22] from me. Why? Because I'm talking about
[1:29:25] they're so blinded in their mind. They
[1:29:27] have such preconceived ideas that when
[1:29:30] something like that comes and you tell
[1:29:32] them about the crowds that he had in
[1:29:34] Africa and India and 30,000 and
[1:29:36] challenging the Hindu and the Buddha and
[1:29:38] the Muslim and all of them and saying,
[1:29:40] "Let them come up any of your gods."
[1:29:43] Amen. Buddha or any of them come up here
[1:29:45] and open this blind man's eyes and I'll
[1:29:48] serve your God. But in my Jesus will
[1:29:50] come who I proclaim, who I represent, if
[1:29:53] he'll come and do it, will you serve
[1:29:54] him? Hey, below. You try to tell people
[1:29:58] that try to tack people's attention. Try
[1:30:00] to open up their minds so they'll say
[1:30:03] yes. Yes, Lord. Yes.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we need.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; It's so unusual
[1:30:10] to hear of a prophet. It's been nearly
[1:30:13] 2,000 years since we had one. Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; How many knows, brother Bram said that
[1:30:18] those were reformers? He called those
[1:30:20] reformers. Luther, Wesley, and all of
[1:30:21] them reformers, but we hadn't had a
[1:30:24] prophet for about this long if I'm not
[1:30:26] sure if I I'm if I'm right. I think he
[1:30:28] said like right since the time of Paul.
[1:30:32] That's a long time. Not 400 years like
[1:30:35] Israel. Almost 2,000. Why do you think
[1:30:38] you're so blessed?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Why do you think I'm so blessed that
[1:30:42] you've got thus sayeth the Lord? You've
[1:30:44] got a vindicated word of God.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's what's in your hand. That's
[1:30:49] what's in my hand.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And it gives us a weapon against the
[1:30:55] devil.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's our weapon against It's an atomic
[1:30:58] bomb. It's what gives you faith.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says the opening of the eyes
[1:31:04] of the blind and all these things ought
[1:31:06] to give you rapturing faith.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] I'm going to read you something. I was
[1:31:17] back there reading when brother Steve
[1:31:18] come back there and got me and I was
[1:31:19] just looking at a little bit just opened
[1:31:22] the the book and somebody had said
[1:31:23] something about this
[1:31:26] and in just one of the cases he says
[1:31:29] those born blind receive their sight.
[1:31:32] After praying for one totally blind man,
[1:31:35] brother Brandham said to him walk up
[1:31:36] there to the pulpit and put your finger
[1:31:38] on that preacher's nose. He walked
[1:31:41] straight up to the minister, then pulled
[1:31:43] his nose, causing the audience to laugh.
[1:31:49] Hello. That's the kind of miracles that
[1:31:51] happened.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. No such a thing
[1:31:56] as a hard case with God. A lady from
[1:31:59] Greece who had no opening uh in her
[1:32:02] throat entered the prayer line. She
[1:32:05] could not swallow a single drop of water
[1:32:07] or any kind of food. As soon as brother
[1:32:08] Brandham prayed for her, she drank a
[1:32:11] glass of water and ate candy. A candy
[1:32:14] bar. Amen.
[1:32:20] A night or two later in the same
[1:32:22] meetings, nine deaf and dumb mutes came
[1:32:24] into prayer line and all nine were
[1:32:27] healed. Amen. You can tell them about
[1:32:29] the power of God and they just can't
[1:32:31] fathom it. Well, it didn't come to our
[1:32:34] church. It didn't come the way we
[1:32:35] thought it ought to come. I mean know
[1:32:37] that that was the scribes and Pharisees
[1:32:39] problems. They were the old bottles and
[1:32:41] that Jesus just could not put new wine,
[1:32:44] no new stimulation cuz their hearts have
[1:32:47] been hardened. Ain't that right? They
[1:32:49] had hard hearts. God has to make you a
[1:32:51] new bottle. Amen. And put that
[1:32:53] stimulation of new revelation in your
[1:32:56] heart.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it expands.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Never put a period behind what you
[1:33:03] believe. They put a period behind what
[1:33:04] they believe. Amen. That was what their
[1:33:07] problem was.
[1:33:10] It was too unusual. Amen.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So many so many cases. Amen. In all
[1:33:19] these different junctions of time, can
[1:33:22] you imagine when Samson come with a
[1:33:24] jawbone of a mule when he begin to beat
[1:33:26] him down? I imagine them Philistines,
[1:33:28] they were pretty surprised,
[1:33:31] huh?
[1:33:35] After about 400 of them got killed and
[1:33:37] the word got back to their captain, hey,
[1:33:39] we have lost 400 and we can't beat these
[1:33:42] Israelites. The captain says, well, how
[1:33:45] many is there? Uh, there's just one.
[1:33:52] Just what? I didn't hear you right.
[1:33:55] 1,000 100,000. What is it? No, one.
[1:33:58] There's just one manise.
[1:34:03] And after about a thousand dying, they
[1:34:05] said, "Hey, we can't beat this man."
[1:34:10] Hallelujah. Unprecedented, unusual.
[1:34:13] That's what God loves to do. He loves
[1:34:16] when you have faith in him for the
[1:34:18] unusual.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Now, most of the time, we want things to
[1:34:25] be in the Bible, right? Sure. But how
[1:34:28] many things did God do that he hadn't
[1:34:31] done before?
[1:34:33] Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; He can do anything.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Expect it in your life.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Expect it. Hallelujah.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Think about this. Remember
[1:34:47] when Nathan and Kora when they rose up
[1:34:50] and did what they did, Amen. And Moses
[1:34:52] begin to tell them what's going to
[1:34:54] happen. He says, "Hereby know, ye shall
[1:34:57] know that the Lord has sent me to do all
[1:34:59] these works, for I have not done them of
[1:35:01] my own hand. If these men die the common
[1:35:04] death of all men, or if they be visited
[1:35:06] after the visitation of all men, then
[1:35:09] the Lord has not sent me." In other
[1:35:11] words, if you die an old man, but if the
[1:35:13] Lord shall make a new thing, Amen. and
[1:35:17] the earth opened her mouth and swallow
[1:35:19] them up and all that that pertains unto
[1:35:21] them and they go down quick into the
[1:35:22] pit.
[1:35:26] I have a question. I maybe maybe the
[1:35:29] answer's in there, but how did po how
[1:35:31] did uh Moses know
[1:35:34] or was he just prophetically speaking?
[1:35:38] Huh? Because how many knows? He says,
[1:35:41] "If the earth opens it up and they go
[1:35:44] down quick into the pit, then shall ye
[1:35:46] understand that these men have provoked
[1:35:48] the Lord." And it came to pass as he has
[1:35:50] made an end of speaking all these words
[1:35:53] that the ground claims under.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:35:58] That was under them. and the earth
[1:36:00] opened her mouth and swallowed them up.
[1:36:03] Their houses and all the men that are
[1:36:05] pertained to Kora and all their goods.
[1:36:09] They and all that pertain to them went
[1:36:11] down alive into the pit and the earth
[1:36:14] closed upon them and they perished from
[1:36:16] among the congregation.
[1:36:19] Hello. God did a new thing.
[1:36:22] I don't know if there ever had been a
[1:36:24] time before Sodom and Gomorrah that God
[1:36:27] rained fire out of heaven and destroyed
[1:36:30] those cities.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says in the tribulation
[1:36:34] period when God destroys that great
[1:36:35] harlot with fire and so forth, he says
[1:36:37] it'll be a weight of a 100 pounds. I
[1:36:40] believe a fire come down.
[1:36:44] Imagine something traveling at 100
[1:36:46] something 100 pounds. Amen. Traveling at
[1:36:48] a great speed. Don't think you're gonna
[1:36:50] hide.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Things that he had never judgment that
[1:36:55] hadn't come before. It was water before
[1:36:57] fire.
[1:36:59] God does new things sometimes even with
[1:37:02] judgment.
[1:37:05] God did a new thing when he uh called
[1:37:06] Abraham to come and follow him. Isn't
[1:37:08] that right? Something new, something
[1:37:10] different. All in the all the nations of
[1:37:13] the earth shall be blessed. There
[1:37:16] Abraham was out there. Isn't that right?
[1:37:18] God come down and showed himself to
[1:37:20] Abraham when he when they visited the
[1:37:23] wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah and Lot
[1:37:25] was down there.
[1:37:29] It was something people hadn't expected
[1:37:33] when Jesus, let's go all the way to
[1:37:34] Jesus. When Jesus came,
[1:37:37] think about when Christ came.
[1:37:48] Let me just read it the way that the
[1:37:49] Bible says it.
[1:37:56] He was in the world.
[1:37:58] The world was made by him,
[1:38:02] and the world knew him not.
[1:38:08] He came to his own and his own received
[1:38:12] him not.
[1:38:14] What a terrible picture.
[1:38:16] But as many as received him, to them
[1:38:19] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[1:38:22] even to them to them that believe on his
[1:38:25] name.
[1:38:27] the very God of heaven come to the
[1:38:29] earth,
[1:38:31] the one that made them and they couldn't
[1:38:33] receive him
[1:38:35] because they had their own ideas.
[1:38:38] They were in such a form,
[1:38:42] brother Bam said, a preconceived idea.
[1:38:45] How many believes it's important to have
[1:38:47] your heart open?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes we think we might
[1:38:52] have it all figured out, but be careful.
[1:38:55] Oh, God is unusual.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Why do we think so? Why do we look so
[1:39:00] close at at that woman in purple? Cuz
[1:39:04] it's easy to miss it.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; It's not hard to miss it.
[1:39:09] The Pope going to Rome out of America.
[1:39:11] That That's pretty pretty plain there,
[1:39:13] isn't it?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pope right out of America. Right
[1:39:16] there you are.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you aren't watchful, you'll
[1:39:21] miss it. Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; How many wants to say, "Lord, I don't
[1:39:24] want to miss the rapture.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be ready. I believe God has
[1:39:29] provided us the means to be ready."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour.
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And his own received him not.
[1:39:44] Okay.
[1:39:46] Now, you no wonder when you carry the
[1:39:48] flat gospel and see the Holy Ghost come
[1:39:51] in and make it manifest amongst an
[1:39:53] old-fashioned bunch of people, it's
[1:39:55] foreign to you. It's hard for you to
[1:39:58] believe it.
[1:40:01] Amen.
[1:40:03] As I said the other night about Joseph,
[1:40:06] it was hard for him to think that Mary
[1:40:08] being pregnant, how could she be that, a
[1:40:10] holy woman like that? and she said that
[1:40:13] Gabriel had visited her.
[1:40:17] How many know Joseph had a hard time
[1:40:20] believing Mary's story?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he had a little bit
[1:40:26] of a question about whether an Gabriel
[1:40:28] Gabriel who
[1:40:31] right
[1:40:33] Gabriel who he was mind it he had it in
[1:40:37] his mind to put her away.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? He doubted it.
[1:40:44] He had a hard time believing that
[1:40:47] because why it was so unusual, Brother
[1:40:49] Ram says
[1:40:51] it wasn't usual at all.
[1:40:54] And even though perhaps there's a
[1:40:56] scripture pointing to it, a virgin shall
[1:40:58] conceive.
[1:41:00] Perhaps he knew that, but nah, it just
[1:41:03] wouldn't happen to my wife. It wouldn't
[1:41:05] happen to my virgin.
[1:41:09] Amen.
[1:41:11] about like the devil tries to tell you
[1:41:13] and I sometimes ah you aren't going to
[1:41:15] make that rapture.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; There's only two of them that ever went
[1:41:18] into the rapture. Ain't that right? That
[1:41:20] were ever translated. So it won't be
[1:41:22] unprecedented. It has been done before.
[1:41:25] But folks, I don't know about God's
[1:41:27] going to do it again. How many believe
[1:41:28] God is going to do it again? And I plan
[1:41:30] on being one of them. And I plan on you
[1:41:32] being one of them.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; He had a hard time with it. Joseph did.
[1:41:38] As a matter of fact, he took an angel
[1:41:41] took an angel to come
[1:41:44] to Joseph's and say, "Don't be afraid to
[1:41:47] take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that
[1:41:50] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:41:52] Ghost."
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Then he was okay with it. Kind of like
[1:41:57] we are. Oh, it might have a hard time
[1:41:59] with, oh, there's no eternal hell or
[1:42:01] this, that, or the other, but it's thus
[1:42:03] saith the Lord.
[1:42:06] So, I accept it. People
[1:42:08] have a hard time with doctrines, but
[1:42:10] Jesus comes and vindicates it. That
[1:42:12] should take care of your doubt. But it's
[1:42:14] hard. It's hard for people to believe
[1:42:17] that God came and did what he did. That
[1:42:19] he actually sent Malachi 4 to turn the
[1:42:21] hearts of the children back to the
[1:42:23] fathers
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; to restore us back to the faith in the
[1:42:27] most evil, the most wicked age of all.
[1:42:30] The miracle is what I'm looking at right
[1:42:33] there.
[1:42:34] I'm looking at a miracle.
[1:42:38] Every one of us is a miracle.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know where Devin and Jana are,
[1:42:47] but them and Glenn and Sherry and them
[1:42:50] that's just recently come to the message
[1:42:51] now. It's awful long. How many believe
[1:42:53] it's a miracle that they can believe?
[1:42:55] Even Sherry has testified there for a
[1:42:56] while. She was a little bit questioned,
[1:42:58] you know, whatever, but she finally got
[1:43:00] the revelation
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; and she testified. I finally got it.
[1:43:04] Yeah, I believe God has sent us a
[1:43:05] prophet. We needed it.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It takes a opening of God take it takes
[1:43:10] God to open up the mind, the heart to
[1:43:13] able to accept something so unusual.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Man is so duped in their tradition with
[1:43:20] the God. Every last Amish menite and all
[1:43:23] of them could hear this this morning.
[1:43:25] God don't ask nobody what to do. He does
[1:43:28] it who he wants, where he wants, how he
[1:43:30] wants. And he don't come to fit the way
[1:43:33] you think he ought to do it. You have to
[1:43:35] come to thinking and understanding and
[1:43:37] believing the way that God does it.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; That's important. That's an important
[1:43:42] thing to humanity,
[1:43:45] to church religions, is don't think that
[1:43:47] God has to do it the way you think he
[1:43:49] has to do it.
[1:43:52] Amen.
[1:43:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:58] Hallelujah. It was so unusual. It was so
[1:44:01] unusual for a thing like that. It never
[1:44:03] had happened before.
[1:44:06] But brother Bam says that's where God
[1:44:08] dwells.
[1:44:09] He takes the unusual things,
[1:44:12] the unthought of things.
[1:44:16] Amen.
[1:44:18] Praise the Lord. Now the resurrection,
[1:44:22] he says, was unusual to many of his
[1:44:25] people that loved him.
[1:44:28] Yet it was the promised word, but too
[1:44:32] too unusual
[1:44:34] to believe. I think brother Brad may
[1:44:37] have wr uh read this Wednesday
[1:44:41] and it's found in Mark. I believe it is.
[1:44:45] Let me find this. Matthew Mark.
[1:44:52] Now when Jesus was risen early, the
[1:44:54] first day of the week, he appeared first
[1:44:55] to Mary Magdalene. out of whom he had
[1:44:58] cast seven devils.
[1:45:01] And she went and told them
[1:45:04] that had been with him. So as they
[1:45:08] mourned and wept,
[1:45:11] Amen. What'd you tell them? He's risen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; He's risen.
[1:45:16] And they when they heard it that he was
[1:45:19] alive and had been seen of her, believed
[1:45:22] not.
[1:45:27] In Luke, he puts it this way.
[1:45:30] It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, Mary
[1:45:34] the mother of James, and other women
[1:45:35] that were with them, which told these
[1:45:39] things unto the apostles, and their
[1:45:41] words seemed to them as idol tales,
[1:45:46] and they believed them not.
[1:45:49] Then Jesus says, "I'm going to rise
[1:45:51] again the third day." He even told him
[1:45:55] that right?
[1:45:58] Sometimes it's hard to say yes Lord.
[1:46:00] Yes.
[1:46:03] Sometimes God will tell you no and you
[1:46:06] have a hard time saying yes.
[1:46:09] Amen.
[1:46:15] All right.
[1:46:17] And afterwards
[1:46:18] that he appeared in another form unto
[1:46:21] two of them that was Cleopus I believe
[1:46:23] it was that was going to as they walked
[1:46:26] and went into the country and they went
[1:46:28] and told it to the residue neither
[1:46:31] believe they them.
[1:46:34] Amen. And afterwards he appeared unto
[1:46:37] the 11 as they sat at meat and upraded
[1:46:41] them with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:46:44] heart because beloved they believed not
[1:46:46] them which had been seen of him after he
[1:46:50] was risen. See the resurrection brother
[1:46:53] Bam says the people that loved him could
[1:46:55] not believe it
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; because he was unusual.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; You mean he rose from the dead?
[1:47:07] And this is where my name gets a little
[1:47:10] black mark.
[1:47:13] Thomas.
[1:47:16] Yeah. I hate that. Every time you say
[1:47:19] Thomas, especially preaching you, we
[1:47:22] know where you going there.
[1:47:25] That's right. Thomas, he was man
[1:47:27] stubborn. He was like, "No, I'm not
[1:47:31] believing it. It ain't true. ain't so
[1:47:35] I'll have to put my fingers in his side
[1:47:37] and I'll have to fing feel his hands.
[1:47:39] Amen. Before I believe
[1:47:43] there's some good things said about
[1:47:45] Thomas. I when one of the disciples or
[1:47:48] when somebody was dying, he said, "Let's
[1:47:49] go down and die with him." But in this
[1:47:52] case, he just would not believe.
[1:47:55] I don't know if brother Brad said it or
[1:47:57] not, but Thomas wasn't Yeah, I think he
[1:47:59] did. I remember. He said, "Thomas wasn't
[1:48:01] the only one that wasn't believing the
[1:48:02] air, right?"
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; He wasn't the only one not believing. We
[1:48:07] just read it.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't believe and wouldn't believe.
[1:48:10] They just had a hard time believing it.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Thomas is just, "Hey, this just comes
[1:48:15] fresh. Comes fresh." Thomas, he's just
[1:48:18] got he just got a little bit more
[1:48:19] vehement about it. I'm going to have to
[1:48:21] put my fingers in his eye. The rest of
[1:48:23] them didn't believe it. He says, "I'm
[1:48:24] gonna have to touch him. I'm gonna have
[1:48:25] to feel him." And remember when Jesus
[1:48:27] appeared and he says, "Come here,
[1:48:29] Thomas. Put your hands here. Feel me
[1:48:32] here."
[1:48:35] And Thomas fell down and he can preach
[1:48:37] to a lot of trinitarians.
[1:48:40] He preached the sermon. Thomas did when
[1:48:42] he fell down on his he says, "My Lord
[1:48:45] and my God."
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, he's called him God.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; You don't believe he was God. Jesus
[1:48:55] never disputed it. He was right in line.
[1:49:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. So unusual.
[1:49:04] God does things in unusual ways. Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Remember, never before had a mule talked
[1:49:16] to what was his name?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Balum.
[1:49:23] Balum.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Balum.
[1:49:27] Stubborn old guy. I mean,
[1:49:37] stubborn. I said that word stubborn. He
[1:49:38] was stubborn. He wouldn't listen to God,
[1:49:40] right? He wanted to curse Israel and all
[1:49:42] these other things. And I just want to
[1:49:44] say this that
[1:49:47] I I I'll call call it some brother Danny
[1:49:50] Steven had a lot of trouble in his
[1:49:52] church one time and there was some
[1:49:55] somebody
[1:49:58] that said that you've got witches in
[1:50:00] your church. You've got witches in your
[1:50:02] church.
[1:50:04] and he can figure out just well I don't
[1:50:06] see him practicing witchcraft or
[1:50:08] anything but you know but the Bible says
[1:50:11] that stubbornness
[1:50:14] stubbornness is as the sin of
[1:50:16] witchcraft.
[1:50:17] Hello. How many knows? Don't ever be
[1:50:20] stubborn. Be careful not to be stubborn.
[1:50:22] Oh, he ain't going to tell me. Watch
[1:50:25] out.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; God hates his stubborn spirit.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible sin.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; No wonder you got trouble when you've
[1:50:32] got a bunch of stubborn people in.
[1:50:35] They they back up on you. They'll lock
[1:50:37] up on you. They won't amen. They're
[1:50:38] nothing but a wet rag in the church.
[1:50:40] You're going to have problems.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; How many believes when somebody comes in
[1:50:44] here, Amen, with a critical attitude,
[1:50:46] stubborn spirit, you're going to have
[1:50:47] problems.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Off that little rabbit
[1:50:52] trail. Maybe somebody needed that. Lord,
[1:50:54] help us never to be stubborn.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But baam, he was woo. I'll tell
[1:51:01] you what, he ought to have gotten down
[1:51:02] on his knees and prayed. Ain't that
[1:51:04] right? Cuz that mule talked to him. He
[1:51:06] says, "Haven't I served you all these
[1:51:07] days?" Then why you beat me? Huh?
[1:51:12] That's right. God didn't have to animate
[1:51:14] it. Brother Troy didn't have to animate
[1:51:16] that little opening his lips moving. God
[1:51:19] moved his lips and he spoke out of his
[1:51:21] mouth talking to him.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; God can use whatever he wants to use.
[1:51:27] Amen.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says God will use whatever
[1:51:30] part of you give him. If you give him
[1:51:32] his heart, your mind, your soul, your
[1:51:34] singing, he says your voice, whatever
[1:51:36] you give to God, God can use.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; On and on and on. It was unexpected. The
[1:51:48] coming of Christ was so different than
[1:51:50] what the scribes and Pharisees had. Him
[1:51:53] coming down on a red carpet. Isn't that
[1:51:55] right? and embracing KF as hey you are
[1:51:58] my guys. Guess what? I have come down
[1:52:00] and we're going to wipe these Romans up
[1:52:02] off of here. That's kind of what they
[1:52:04] thought. They was going to come back as
[1:52:06] a warrior and clean them off and then
[1:52:08] restore them. But no, he didn't come
[1:52:09] that way at all.
[1:52:12] No red carpet come under a bad name. A
[1:52:15] woman that got pregnant before she was
[1:52:18] married.
[1:52:20] Amen. They called him illegitimate.
[1:52:24] born. We be not born of fornication
[1:52:28] is what they said.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; How many knows? Can you imagine the
[1:52:34] Pharisees being so proud until they
[1:52:37] thought themselves better than Jesus?
[1:52:40] They thought they were better than
[1:52:42] Jesus. They had no problem disputing
[1:52:44] him.
[1:52:47] That's why when I hear preachers in this
[1:52:49] message, Amen. trying to talk, oh,
[1:52:50] brother Brennan was wrong on this, that,
[1:52:52] or the other, and he hadn't have a
[1:52:53] right. Who in the world do you think you
[1:52:55] are?
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; You sure don't have my confidence, cuz
[1:53:00] you sure ain't got no vindication. He
[1:53:02] had vindication.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And you'd be in a different ball of wax
[1:53:08] if he was still here.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I'd like to drag their sorry hides up in
[1:53:15] front of the prophet. Say, "Here, you
[1:53:16] tell him what you told me. You tell him
[1:53:19] about those wrong dates. Here he is.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; No, they'd be scratching, clawing,
[1:53:24] getting back out of there. They wouldn't
[1:53:26] have the nerve.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; They might. They might be dumb enough.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; To do it because Brother Bam says those
[1:53:34] folks, those 90 70 ministers were
[1:53:37] smarter than I thought
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; then to come up there.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it'd have been stupid.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Yep. to come on up there.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And so is it stupid to refute the
[1:53:50] prophet after he's gone.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I can't help but think that God's going
[1:53:57] to turn it up a little bit for you.
[1:54:00] That's right.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to be bad. It's going to be
[1:54:04] bad. Praise the Lord.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Unusual.
[1:54:09] That's right. Luther was unusual to the
[1:54:12] Catholic Church.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. the boldness that he
[1:54:16] had to pack noses up and start a
[1:54:18] reformation.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Wesley was unusual to the Lutheran.
[1:54:25] Huh? No, you can't just live by faith,
[1:54:27] but you've got to be sanctified. You got
[1:54:29] to live a holy life. You can't drink
[1:54:31] that beer, smoke that cigarette,
[1:54:35] huh? Can't dip that snuff.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? We're way down
[1:54:42] the road from that church.
[1:54:44] You can't just speak in tongues and live
[1:54:46] out and live on out there.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; We can't live like the Pentecostals
[1:54:51] lived. We've come further than that.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; You can't just go to church and be a
[1:54:57] good church member. You won't make it
[1:54:59] unless the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:55:01] is living in you every day.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; You'll miss the rapture shares the
[1:55:07] world. Glory's required of us
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; then it was of them.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Live a holy life. Live pure for him.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; I like what Matthew preached here the
[1:55:28] other night about that justification.
[1:55:31] Never done it in the first place. Never
[1:55:34] done it.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we are.
[1:55:38] I love what brother Brad says. You are
[1:55:40] the pure, virtuous, sinless, spotless
[1:55:44] bride of Jesus Christ. If you have shand
[1:55:46] those denomination, if you are believing
[1:55:48] every word, you are spotless. You're
[1:55:51] sinless. You're virtuous.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Turn the corner.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; God keeps turning corners.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:10] All right.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:17] God takes us higher and higher
[1:56:20] and higher.
[1:56:28] Brother Bam says, "Now the devil fights
[1:56:30] this wonderful truth of divine healing.
[1:56:33] Someday the church is going to wake up
[1:56:35] to the fact and realize that the very
[1:56:39] greatest things that he they had the
[1:56:43] greatest blessings outside of salvation
[1:56:46] that they've turned it down. How many
[1:56:49] know a lot of them believed that in in
[1:56:51] salvation, but they said the days of
[1:56:53] miracles is passed. God don't fil with
[1:56:56] the Holy Ghost anymore. God don't do
[1:56:58] miracles anymore. God don't heal
[1:56:59] anymore. They turn it down. Many times I
[1:57:03] found the heathens over there in Africa.
[1:57:07] Amen. Because the missionary told them
[1:57:09] the days of miracles is passed. And the
[1:57:10] poor fellow is walking around packing
[1:57:12] mud idols trying to get healing through
[1:57:14] mud idols
[1:57:16] because they know that their fathers got
[1:57:18] winked at their ignorance had healed
[1:57:21] them through believing in the God of the
[1:57:23] mud idol.
[1:57:26] Amen.
[1:57:29] Don't even ask me. But these folks, they
[1:57:33] could just go out there and they would
[1:57:34] believe and God honored their faith.
[1:57:44] God might give you some I mean not God
[1:57:46] but the doctor might give you some kind
[1:57:48] of a just a water pill of some kind and
[1:57:50] you believe that you're going to get
[1:57:51] better. You take it and you believe it.
[1:57:53] You probably get better. Why? Not
[1:57:54] because of that, but because you
[1:57:56] believe.
[1:57:58] But anyway, brother Bam saying here that
[1:57:59] they got I healed through their mud
[1:58:01] lles. But the theology of preachers
[1:58:04] today, the churches and things that deny
[1:58:06] the power of God. Now notice, friend,
[1:58:09] now it's strange that brother Brandon
[1:58:11] would go into this.
[1:58:13] Now I'm going to I'm going to take this
[1:58:14] for the next 15 minutes if I could.
[1:58:18] He goes into notice, friend, one day,
[1:58:20] for instance,
[1:58:21] he says the like the electric lights.
[1:58:24] There was a time when a man
[1:58:27] would have thought that if if they'd
[1:58:29] have told somebody 500 years ago that
[1:58:32] they'd have electric light like that,
[1:58:35] that person would have said that
[1:58:36] person's crazy.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:58:41] 500 years ago. Then he said, "Look," and
[1:58:44] I don't know, buddy, but I'm here to
[1:58:46] tell you I thank God for Thomas Edison.
[1:58:50] Is
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; that right?
[1:58:55] crazy.
[1:58:57] Listen, but they have electric lights.
[1:59:00] And that person would have said, "All
[1:59:01] right, but there was a man one time way
[1:59:03] down in his heart
[1:59:05] that he could reach electricity."
[1:59:08] And talking about Benjamin from
[1:59:09] Franklin, he says he got a kite and a
[1:59:11] key and fished it out of disguise.
[1:59:15] Benjamin did. He says, "And it hit into
[1:59:18] that bottle and he stopped it up."
[1:59:21] What good did it do to stop up the
[1:59:22] bottle? He thought he had it. He began
[1:59:26] to scream, "I got it. I got it." He had
[1:59:29] it, but he didn't know what he had. And
[1:59:31] that's what's the church is. The matter
[1:59:33] with the church today, they've got some,
[1:59:36] but they don't know what they got.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; How many would say, and and another
[1:59:42] quote he says, "But Bram says, that's
[1:59:43] all they know really is that they got
[1:59:45] it." Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; You don't know a whole lot if all you
[1:59:49] know is you got it.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; It's good to have it, but I want to know
[1:59:52] what I got.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to talk that I'm going to
[1:59:56] preach that probably for the next
[1:59:57] several times. And if you know talking
[2:00:00] about what we got, what do you got in
[2:00:02] your hand?
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; What do you got, people?
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't know what he had. That's
[2:00:11] where the church is
[2:00:14] now. As long as he had it, he could
[2:00:17] rejoice and say, "I know it's there. I
[2:00:19] feel it. I know I got it. It's there."
[2:00:23] What was the concept? The concept with
[2:00:25] Bjamin Franklin is is I know that
[2:00:28] somehow you can take that power and run
[2:00:31] it through something. Isn't that right?
[2:00:34] He got it in a bottle and he thought he
[2:00:35] had a little electricity. I doubt there
[2:00:36] was any electricity in there, do you?
[2:00:38] But he thought he had it. But that was
[2:00:41] his concept. Another man come along by
[2:00:43] the name of Thomas Edison come along
[2:00:45] after Benjamin Franklin and said that he
[2:00:48] could make it light up. There was
[2:00:50] something in him that told him that he
[2:00:53] could make make it light up to help
[2:00:56] mankind.
[2:00:58] Wow.
[2:01:00] Think of the electric every portion of
[2:01:02] electric motors, electric engines, jet
[2:01:05] engines, whatever it might be. All
[2:01:08] because of that man. Isn't that right?
[2:01:11] Believing that it could be.
[2:01:15] Amen. I hope you're reading between the
[2:01:18] lines.
[2:01:19] Amen. One of these days when we have a
[2:01:22] new body,
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; when we're over there, we're going to
[2:01:26] say, you know, I knew it. I just knew it
[2:01:28] was there.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; We held on. We kept going. We kept
[2:01:33] searching. We kept saying, God, purify
[2:01:35] my heart. Had me ready for that time. I
[2:01:38] know it's possible. I know the body
[2:01:41] change is possible.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; I know we can change in the atoms
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; because we can change our character by
[2:01:49] the power of God.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[2:01:53] Amen.
[2:01:55] So he says he could make it light up. So
[2:01:58] he sat at his desk for tens of thousands
[2:02:01] of wires tried to make that electric
[2:02:04] current flow
[2:02:06] and on and on. tireless hours, nights,
[2:02:09] and people calling them crazy and
[2:02:10] everything else. But there's something
[2:02:12] on the inside of him told him that that
[2:02:14] electric would light up.
[2:02:17] Amen.
[2:02:25] Amen.
[2:02:31] See, Brother Bam says, "When I first
[2:02:32] started out in this ministry, he was
[2:02:34] reading about something about a little
[2:02:36] baby to eat erasers off of a pencil or a
[2:02:39] pedal off of a bicycle. When it took the
[2:02:41] little fella in to examine him to found
[2:02:43] out that that little boy needed sulfur,
[2:02:45] see, he's made out of the elements of
[2:02:48] the earth. That baby's body originally
[2:02:50] come from the earth where sulfur is, and
[2:02:52] there's something in there calling for
[2:02:54] that sulfur." He says there's got to be
[2:02:56] a sulfur out there to respond to that
[2:02:58] call. If there's a deep calling, there's
[2:03:00] got to be a deep to respond. Amen. Now
[2:03:04] again, he talks about Edison rather. He
[2:03:06] tried wire after wire and finally he
[2:03:08] found the right wire that would light
[2:03:10] up. It's got to be there. If something
[2:03:14] inside of him told him it would be
[2:03:15] there, it's got to be there. How many
[2:03:18] believes, amen, before we take a
[2:03:20] translation, before we get to that place
[2:03:22] to be pleasing to the Lord and Amen and
[2:03:25] walk like Enoch walked, have you gotten
[2:03:28] that hunger this morning? Have you
[2:03:30] gotten that deep? Do you believe that we
[2:03:32] can go further than anybody else has
[2:03:35] ever went?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; How many believe that the saints that
[2:03:38] have gone on are waiting for you and I
[2:03:41] to come to that place
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; ready for the rapture? I believe it's
[2:03:47] there. We're longing for it.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; We're hungering for it, for that body
[2:03:53] change.
[2:03:57] But there's got to be a longing for it,
[2:03:59] a call for it first. Now, notice what
[2:04:02] brother Bam says. First of all, we
[2:04:05] realize, Brother Bam says, you know,
[2:04:06] just like television, television was
[2:04:09] here since Adam and Eve. Electricity was
[2:04:11] here since Adam and Eve. the cell phones
[2:04:13] were here.
[2:04:16] I don't know. I don't know how they have
[2:04:18] all these millions and millions and
[2:04:19] millions of peoples and everybody has a
[2:04:21] different number and they can make that
[2:04:22] all work. I don't know. But it's magic.
[2:04:27] It's pretty phenomenal. And it goes up
[2:04:30] to satellite, right?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe you know more about it than I do.
[2:04:35] I don't know much about it, but I ain't
[2:04:37] got no line land line anymore. So, it's
[2:04:39] got to go shooting, bouncing off of
[2:04:41] something. That's a lot of signals
[2:04:43] bouncing off of stuff.
[2:04:45] But that was always here. It's just that
[2:04:48] somebody discovered it and somebody now
[2:04:50] look, oh my.
[2:04:52] You don't need no
[2:04:56] uh library with world history. What is
[2:04:59] it called? Like
[2:05:01] encyclopedia.
[2:05:02] That's right. I don't have my phone
[2:05:04] here, but just say the word. There's
[2:05:07] your encyclopedia
[2:05:10] is right in your hands.
[2:05:14] I guess the whole w everything they put
[2:05:16] on the internet. I don't know if it's
[2:05:17] all the wisdom of the world or not, but
[2:05:19] all of that stuff is right there. Amen.
[2:05:23] And it always was.
[2:05:27] Amen.
[2:05:29] I I'm sure glad brother Bennett picked
[2:05:30] up. He says, you know, how that
[2:05:32] television uh you know, like Marilyn
[2:05:34] Monroe, those those hero voice is still
[2:05:36] going through there. Those and the
[2:05:38] pictures are still going there. He says,
[2:05:40] "That's the way that God records our
[2:05:42] every action.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Our every action." He records and it's
[2:05:46] put it on a record. It's still there.
[2:05:48] It's never going to be erased.
[2:05:50] That's always going to be there. That's
[2:05:52] recorded. Every emotion you have. Amen.
[2:05:59] Lord Jesus, forgive me of all my sins
[2:06:01] and shortcomings.
[2:06:03] Lord, fill me with your spirit. Lord,
[2:06:05] cleanse my heart from all unbelief. I
[2:06:08] accept what you did for me on Calvary.
[2:06:10] Let that be recorded. Ain't that right?
[2:06:14] Because brother Bam did talk about an
[2:06:16] eraser. Something that stops that
[2:06:18] record. And that's the blood of Jesus
[2:06:19] Christ.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Erases all that, erases your past.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:28] So, in in closing here and friends, for
[2:06:32] 20 years since I've been a Christian, I
[2:06:35] believe that there was a God that's just
[2:06:37] as real as the light is on my hand.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; There's a power of God in this room
[2:06:43] tonight to heal every sick person in
[2:06:46] here.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Open every blinded eye. Unstop every
[2:06:51] deaf ear. Make every lame man leap with
[2:06:55] a heart. saved a sinner, sanctified and
[2:06:59] filled with the Holy Ghost. Every
[2:07:01] believe he's here,
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; just as real as can be.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, I think any
[2:07:11] preacher that's worth any dime, Amen,
[2:07:13] believes in tries to get the people. I
[2:07:16] know just a couple weeks ago, I felt
[2:07:18] like the Holy Spirit fell on me. Amen.
[2:07:20] It just said, "Anybody that really
[2:07:22] believes it, receive your healing now."
[2:07:25] He's right here right now.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; How many believe that doesn't change
[2:07:29] from two weeks ago? He's still right
[2:07:31] here right now.
[2:07:35] That presence is here.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:48] when that
[2:07:51] chaplain went to that
[2:07:54] I'm not sure if he was a he was some
[2:07:56] kind of a captain. I read it about a
[2:07:57] week ago when he was dying. He was
[2:07:59] wounded. He had been shot across the
[2:08:01] chest. He was dying, bleeding out. He
[2:08:03] says, "Remember where you left him.
[2:08:06] Remember where you left him." I want to
[2:08:08] make a point
[2:08:11] this morning.
[2:08:13] I didn't really finish that, but we'll
[2:08:15] leave that alone.
[2:08:19] But and there at the end, he finally
[2:08:23] remembered where he left him and a smile
[2:08:27] came over him.
[2:08:29] Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray thee,
[2:08:32] Lord, my soul to keep. If I should die
[2:08:34] before I wake, I pray thee, Lord, my
[2:08:36] soul to take.
[2:08:39] this morning, just in the last week, I
[2:08:41] feel like the Lord's given me a little
[2:08:43] revelation that you don't realize, you
[2:08:47] don't realize how powerful your words of
[2:08:50] repentance are.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; When you say, "Lord Jesus, I haven't
[2:08:55] lived the way that I should. I've done
[2:08:56] wrong. I ask you to forgive me." You
[2:08:59] might not feel anything. You might not.
[2:09:00] But if that's coming from your heart,
[2:09:02] let me tell you something. That's
[2:09:04] powerful. Don't think that it doesn't
[2:09:07] make a difference. It does make a
[2:09:09] difference.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I want to be filled with the
[2:09:11] Holy Ghost." If you truly do, go before
[2:09:13] the Lord.
[2:09:15] Say the words. Repent. Speak those words
[2:09:18] of confession. Amen.
[2:09:21] Heal me, Lord. I believe that you by
[2:09:23] your stripes, I am healed.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Give me faith to believe it, Lord.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; They're powerful.
[2:09:32] And I guess the thought that came to me
[2:09:34] was Jesus went to Calvary. He s those
[2:09:39] stripes was put on his back. And when
[2:09:42] one sinner
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; needs some of that, he's listening,
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; young people, he's listening.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:53] Hallelujah.
[2:09:55] Praise the Lord.
[2:09:58] Just comes to mind seeing Courtney
[2:10:00] there. I don't think she'll mind, but we
[2:10:03] know that we had a little scare with
[2:10:05] her. Isn't that right?
[2:10:07] was a little scare about the C-word
[2:10:12] and we were all praying Lord don't let
[2:10:14] it be that Lord just and and guess what
[2:10:16] the report came back
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; that it's not Praise the Lord.
[2:10:20] Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] We thank God for that. That's great
[2:10:26] news.
[2:10:28] That's something to give God praise
[2:10:29] about.
[2:10:32] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:41] Amen.
[2:10:43] Every day I thank God for my wife back
[2:10:45] there. Amen.
[2:10:47] You know, we we we sometimes say say it
[2:10:50] a lot. Talk about it. But Tommy sitting
[2:10:53] there, doctor said, "You'd never lift
[2:10:55] over what, five, 10 pounds. Never get
[2:10:57] off of that." That's a miracle sitting
[2:11:00] there.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, I believe that God
[2:11:04] deserves the glory.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; And I believe the devil deserves the
[2:11:08] black eye. Hallelujah. Say, "Thank you,
[2:11:11] Lord Jesus." That's right, devil. You
[2:11:14] ain't got no rights here. Faith up in
[2:11:17] this house. We believe Jesus in this
[2:11:20] house.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. The devil, we'll just rub
[2:11:24] it in his face. will keep mentioning it
[2:11:27] because we like to rub it in the devil's
[2:11:29] face that he is not stronger than our
[2:11:31] God.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear him.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be afraid of him
[2:11:37] because if we have been taught by the
[2:11:41] messenger of this hour and brother Bham
[2:11:45] says don't bring no new don't bring no
[2:11:47] 22 to the fight.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Don't bring your ARs. Don't bring your
[2:11:53] cannons.
[2:11:55] Hello.
[2:11:57] Don't bring your bunker busters.
[2:12:02] They're powerful.
[2:12:04] Most powerful weapon, I guess, outside
[2:12:06] of a nuke. I still can't imagine that
[2:12:09] bunker buster that we blew up over there
[2:12:11] just the other day.
[2:12:16] Enormous amount of weight going 170 200
[2:12:20] feet into ground. I can't imagine
[2:12:22] anything going 200 feet in the ground
[2:12:25] through whatever it is, steel,
[2:12:27] concrete, reinforced, it's going down
[2:12:30] and then it's blown up.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Oh man, don't get me going. Then the
[2:12:36] critic said, "But he didn't do
[2:12:38] anything." Yeah, right. Something's
[2:12:41] going to happen. Whole thing's going to
[2:12:43] come down.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; But what is out? What am I trying to say
[2:12:47] this morning? Don't bring your bunk.
[2:12:48] Don't bring your little weapons. What is
[2:12:51] it that you have in your hand? Evening
[2:12:53] light tabernacle. What is it that we
[2:12:55] have in our hand? I'll tell you what's
[2:12:57] been given to our hand. The vindicated
[2:12:59] word of God of thus sayaith the Lord
[2:13:02] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13:06] forever. Boom.
[2:13:10] Nuke that devil
[2:13:13] says you've got a nuclear bomb.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53-6.
[2:13:20] Amen.
[2:13:21] He was wounded for our transgression,
[2:13:23] bruised for our iniquities. The
[2:13:25] chastisement of our peace is upon him
[2:13:27] and by his strip we are boom healed.
[2:13:32] Blow him away. You got a nuclear bomb.
[2:13:38] That's what we have in our hands.
[2:13:43] a God that came down and said ma Hebrews
[2:13:47] 13:8 that he is not dead.
[2:13:51] He's not in an age gone by.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; He is alive
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; and he's the same.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it means to me when
[2:14:01] you say the same. That means he's alive
[2:14:04] and well and waiting for your
[2:14:07] confession.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:10] Praise be to God.
[2:14:22] How many believe this morning that
[2:14:25] there's something in the making?
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; We're turning a corner.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; We're turning another corner.
[2:14:35] I'll tell you what I see. You know what
[2:14:36] I see?
[2:14:44] I see an army rising up.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Young people rising up.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That believe the word of God.
[2:14:59] I see
[2:15:01] an invincible army rising up.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; That's what I see.
[2:15:09] Because I'll tell you this right now,
[2:15:11] he's given us an invincible word.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; How many believe the word is invincible?
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; He brought us back to the pure word of
[2:15:21] God.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Why do you think that it's so important
[2:15:27] to not believe in three different gods?
[2:15:29] Because as long as you believe in three
[2:15:30] different gods, you're still messed up.
[2:15:34] If you believe in a triune baptism,
[2:15:36] you're still messed up.
[2:15:39] But he came and restored the word.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; If you want to be invincible, Gideon,
[2:15:46] God has given you what you need. The
[2:15:48] Bible and the message of the hour.
[2:15:51] You know, I call it the message, but I
[2:15:52] believe that when God give us the
[2:15:54] messages, all the messages
[2:15:58] came from God to give you the power to
[2:16:01] live a victorious life.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:16:13] [Applause]
[2:16:20] Amen.
[2:16:23] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:28] [Music]
[2:16:31] Land,
[2:16:34] I'm longing for
[2:16:38] you. There's a deep calling. We don't
[2:16:41] want to be tied to this earth. How
[2:16:43] many's looking for that ber long?
[2:16:46] And someday
[2:16:50] on thee I'll stand
[2:16:54] [Applause]
[2:16:57] there. My hope
[2:17:02] shall be
[2:17:05] eternal.
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:11] la land.
[2:17:15] Sweet bula
[2:17:19] land.
[2:17:22] Amen. Stand with me this morning.
[2:17:25] Bow your heads. Search your hearts. Ask
[2:17:29] yourself, are you ready to meet the Lord
[2:17:31] this afternoon? If this afternoon is
[2:17:33] when he comes.
[2:17:35] If he comes by 2:00, are you ready?
[2:17:40] If you're not ready, come up here and
[2:17:42] we'll pray with you. You can confess
[2:17:45] your sins to say, "God, I want to be
[2:17:47] right. I'm not right and I want to be
[2:17:49] right. I want to be right right now."
[2:17:52] Jesus will hear your prayer. He'll
[2:17:54] forgive you of your sins and your
[2:17:56] shortcomings.
[2:17:58] He'll do it.
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:05] Amen. I'm glad I'm glad that all of you
[2:18:09] feel like you're ready to go if he
[2:18:11] comes. Amen. But if you're not, as your
[2:18:14] pastor, I just want to make sure. Amen.
[2:18:17] How many wants to be that? No. Every day
[2:18:20] you want to be ready if he was to come
[2:18:22] in the next minute. God bless you, Lord
[2:18:25] Jesus. We bow our heads to you today.
[2:18:27] And we thank you, Lord, for what you do.
[2:18:30] Lord, when you saved each one of us,
[2:18:33] when we think back of what you did,
[2:18:35] Lord, it was unusual. But God, we thank
[2:18:37] you for being such an unusual God. Lord,
[2:18:41] Father, things that we didn't expect to
[2:18:43] happen, yet it did. You came and saved a
[2:18:46] wretch like me. Didn't deserve it.
[2:18:48] Wasn't worthy of it. Nothing that I did.
[2:18:52] Nothing that any of us did to merit
[2:18:54] salvation. But yet, you saved us. And we
[2:18:58] want you to know that. We thank you,
[2:18:59] Father, for that, Lord. And we ask, God,
[2:19:02] that you would bless each and every one
[2:19:04] under the sound of my voice, Lord, to be
[2:19:06] ready for that rapture that lays ahead,
[2:19:09] God. This world is damned. This world is
[2:19:13] doomed. But God, we have another world
[2:19:16] that we're going going to go into, Lord,
[2:19:18] that is not damned, that is not doomed,
[2:19:20] but it's heaven.
[2:19:23] We'll have a house not made with hands,
[2:19:25] eternal into heavens, a new body,
[2:19:30] Father, a body like unto your own
[2:19:32] glorious body, Lord. And we're longing
[2:19:34] for it. We're groaning for it. There's a
[2:19:37] deep calling for it. And that's why we
[2:19:40] sing that song, Bula Land. I'm longing
[2:19:43] for you, Lord. Prepare every heart,
[2:19:46] every hand that's raised. Go down to
[2:19:49] that heart. forgive any transgressions,
[2:19:51] any sins. Wash us white in the blood of
[2:19:54] the lamb. Let us go out these doors.
[2:19:56] Father, though our sins be red like
[2:19:59] crimson, when we leave this place, Lord,
[2:20:01] they'll be white as snow because we
[2:20:03] confess, Lord, we are faulty. We have
[2:20:06] our failures, Lord. And we ask
[2:20:08] forgiveness.
[2:20:09] And Lord, we thank you for the infilling
[2:20:11] of your spirit that convicts us, Lord,
[2:20:13] and that speaks to our hearts, Lord. We
[2:20:15] thank you for this morning's service,
[2:20:17] Lord, and for your Holy Spirit that
[2:20:19] comes and speaks to us, Lord, and
[2:20:21] teaches us your ways and the ways that
[2:20:24] you are. That we are not to try to mold
[2:20:26] you into what we think, but we are to
[2:20:28] mold our minds to what you say and the
[2:20:31] way that you think. Lord,
[2:20:33] bless every heart now this morning in a
[2:20:36] special way. All of our young people,
[2:20:39] Lord, hold them in the palm of your
[2:20:40] hand. Lord, with all that's out there,
[2:20:43] Lord, we ask God that you give them
[2:20:45] strength of the Holy Spirit to walk
[2:20:47] daily. Lord Jesus, let there be no evil
[2:20:50] among them, no wickedness among them, no
[2:20:53] bad spirit, Lord, but a spirit of
[2:20:56] Christianity and love and
[2:20:59] gentleness, meekness
[2:21:02] and humility.
[2:21:04] For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And
[2:21:07] amen.
