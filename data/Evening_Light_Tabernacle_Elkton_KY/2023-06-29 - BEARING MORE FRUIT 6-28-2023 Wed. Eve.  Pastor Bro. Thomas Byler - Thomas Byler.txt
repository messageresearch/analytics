========================================

amen certainly was kind of I used to see the different ones that we had amen and so but um and we prayed just before we went up there I said Lord help us somehow just to be a witness and a testimony for you amen and just Desiring that God had used us in a greater way amen man I feel like you know if we're ever going to do something for the Lord you know it's now is the time to do it amen amen so I think but at Brandon one time he was when he went beyond the curtain of time you know he was sitting on the bed and he talks if boy you better if you if you I don't know what he was how old was he 53 something like that and he said boy if you're ever going to do something for the Lord you better do it and so amen well I'll tell you what the hours late I mean how many leaves the hours late but anyway we uh and we did we really did but the help of the lord we I mean got to amen just start off right off the go get the first night we got there we probably sat two two and a half hours or so just witnessing and talking about the Lord so I really like that you know because I mean the time before it just didn't seem to open up amen and you know and whenever you're witnessing to to people you know it's always good amen I always like for that anointing to come there amen because if you're going to preach the gospel to the poor the Brokenhearted and all that you know I believe it says uh how does it say something about the Lord has anointed me to preach the gospel he was anointed to preach I mean I don't believe you have to be anointed and it makes such a difference amen and it's quite something out of that uh just the wrong person in the room or just the wrong person yeah talking to her and and cutting in or whatever it might be can just kind of mess things up but I like it when it really flows amen and so we just really got to share more and and talk more but it wasn't really until I got back amen that I found out that for probably five miles uh five miles maybe somewhere in there very far from the very farm that I was raised I found out that there's a message search being built amen and so I always got pretty excited about that and so I found out who he was that's kind of in charge of it and today I got on the phone with him and probably talked close to half an hour just talking to him and kind of get the feel of it you know because you know you never know what in the world is going to be going on and I still don't know just the depth of it but I do want to find out I mean just what is what all is going on Amen but I found out enough to know that uh the man that's building it um I guess and he and his brother requested church prayer for all us to pray for his Brethren the person I talked to was Levi Yoder and his brother Ben amen he hasn't even really left the Amish yet but he doesn't believe the message Amy believes the message and and so I don't know I don't know how a man can do that but he he was just I guess laid on his heart to start building and I'm going to show you a few slides of that building amen and so and I'm really really really I had been praying him and I I've tried to get my brother my first cousin David just I just to have some Home Services right there I've never really got got him inspired to do it while we're up there you know and so I never could get inspired which this Sunday morning I think he did say well we should have just had you preach and have a service here you know so he finally opened the door that much and I says well I'd be glad to you know but of course not that not today because we was fixing to go and all but um and so anyway but he kind of kind of opened that up but when I heard that uh there's actually a message Church being built and so now to finish the story on Ben his brother Levi's brother it is and brother Ben and I like I said 20 30 minutes of talk isn't enough I need to do a lot of investigating yet and and everything's preliminary yet here but but he talked like he wasn't you know his ministry he didn't feel like his ministry was for that area or that church or whatever uh he don't know where the Lord wants him yet you know uh but um but anyway so you know and so I don't know about Levi I mean but Ben I don't know you know if this brother that's leaving I don't know if he's a minister or not uh you know but anyway so we still have to find a lot of that out but pray for him because his wife is really kind of against it amen his wife is kind of against it and uh he stands to lose his business which you know a prosperous business he stands loses family amen and so he's trying to take it slow not just to rush out of there uh and just to take off leave it all amen so he is trying to be patient which I think that's wise amen amen if you possibly can you want to run it want to try to do that but do remember uh brother must be Benjamin but his name he called him Ben you're to pray for him and so anyway bye I talked to Levi I told him that I'd like to come back up there amen maybe help a little bit with the construction I certainly want to get hands on with that whole church amen to get my hands on it and help out a little bit and find out more details so amen if if we go with what we're feeling now probably about end up next week going back up there for two three days and I told him that I would help perhaps frame out some windows and things like that but I mostly want to go amen for fellowship and finding out amen different things but I found out and even he said there's a lot of different churches around the area of people who have left the Amish so you can imagine the the door you know and he was telling me about some of them in a different different directions they go and you know of course there was I guess um uh brother Chad Lamb and I don't know I need to find out just who Chad Lamb is he I think baptized about 17 Amish at a time and they're just south of where this is I guess and so I want to get into that group and find out where they are this brother here I think he goes to whether he claimed by the Chad Lamb as his pastor but he said the Lord revealed to him that that wasn't his search home amen but uh that he's going there for now when he can and so forth and I think he's the one that baptized him and so forth but there's just a lot that he told me about different ones that are coming out now uh there's different things that different ones do and and brother Levi expressed that to me and I also expressed that I saw that same thing that most Amish people well leave the Amish really don't want a bunch of the do's and don'ts and and you got to do this and you got to do that and so for a lot of times they they either most of them are a lot of them just want Grace everything's Grace you know and of course the grace I saw was pretty disgraceful but anyway uh anyway you know it's just not all Grace amen and but anyway and then there's others that come out that really want the truth but there's a lot of people that are really wanting and Desiring the truth amen and so there's a whole world there there's a I feel like there's a big work there that could be done amen and so if if the Lord wants me to help in any way I'm open for it amen amen not the pastor their church or anything like that but just to go and try to be a help on the benefit and you know help build it up and help establish you know something up there so that uh there can be I would I told them I was ecstatic because I've been praying and every time I go up there I say Lord Jesus I certainly love to see a message church right in the middle of all this hey man I mean we're talking about uh grow in the midst of gross Darkness because I'm going to tell you right now that trying to get a word edgewise into an Amish person or whatever amen those folks are in about as Darkness as you can get because once people break away from that or even Mennonite or higher Amish or sour Amish or go any hip step higher they can believe more of the Bible but they're not even supposed to talk to you pretty much about scriptures or whatever and they'll think you crazy if we taste stuff you know and so that's they're they're in very gross darkness and so forth and and so it's you know I would love to have seen a delight come in the middle all that I mean because I mean it's a big world folks it's that big world when you're talking about the Amish and and so forth you know we had like 180 I guess showed up to my uh the home the reunion about 180 you know and I I'm thinking I may have told you all the wrong number last time but just like I told you my one Uncle amen that had one wife had 16 children and I think 150 grandchildren and about 300 great grandchildren I think that was closer to the right number so you can imagine that's just one Uncle hey man can you imagine if they'd all come to the reunion if just one of them it had been 500 people almost at least at 450 something like that you know but of course you know my uncle my one Uncle uh yoss you know and he was he he had me to say a prayer over the food so that was kind of an honor but um anyway you know he he worded it he says we're not having a reunion we're just having a get-together because Sports Central Paramus could go to a get-together but they can't go to a reunion and so but anyway I went to my friend and I went to school with Jacob I haven't had to go see him again you know and he's a real staunch Amish man anyway and I went over there and and and pulled in and there's a lot of Amish people there you know at his house I said what's going on in his house well I don't care I'm gonna pull in here anyway so I pulled in there and and there was a bunch of Amish guys standing there and I said hey can y'all is check it out here you know and they looked around and went and called for Jacob Jacob come out there and he seen me you know and and uh he was having an auction I guess for for for some reason anyway some some something that had to do with kin folks and the cousins kind of like I guess when my aunt Katie died we had a cousin's auction where only just a family comes and it was kind of that but that Jacob said well your brother David's here so he went over there David David your brothers here so I see my one I have one Amish brother and one I'm a sister David of course lives in Missouri and so it was just coincidence there was my brother you know and he come out and said I got out of the truck of course and we talked around with those Amish guys for a little bit chatting and cutting up a little bit and whatnot but anyway but let me just go on I I want to be all night here but um talking about that but that was I'm really excited and it was I've been praying that God would do something in that area so I hope that this is that work if it is I certainly am excited about it and and so forth so that there are people that do look for the truth and want light they can have the light amen amen so we're going to show you a couple pictures of that church I guess that is being built if you want to do that Micah amen I'm going to hit the light up here amen and so kind of show it like from the start I guess this is and this is uh in Wilmot Ohio amen and so they've I think they have like 50 000 or something to go with and so they don't have a whole lot they won't be able to finish it but gun they're going to take it as far as they can so I think the property on the left hand side and this building I don't know if it's on the same property but go on to the next one I can't wait to go there and see of course they have some big equipment there and I think they need a little more than that but they've got a bulldozer there to kind of level things up and uh anyway go to the next one there's some pictures of all right go on the next one and there of course you see and I asked him how big it was I don't know just how big it was but he didn't he didn't get a chance to tell me that but anyway so that's what it's looking like amen and I think they're gonna have radiant heat in the floor and uh go ahead come on all right boy those are some wide anyway those windows there's a there's a bunch of Windows that need framed in and I told him well save me the window framing in job he says he would if I come up there he did and nobody else comes and offers to do it I'll get to try to get in there and frame out some windows go to the next one all right now you can't see it I guess but uh he said over here on the left side now I know what he's got in mind but he said this here's the Buggy Barn over here you can't zoom it in I don't think but I stairs I believe there's a lot of Windows in that Barn all right and he told me the story about those windows yeah you can see some of them Lord of Mercy I don't know what I got myself into probably real big but anyway uh he said that uh they got it was going to have to spend ten thousand dollars on Windows and they went on Facebook what is it Marketplace yeah and they found some you know for a lot cheaper like 150 each or whatever and they went to pick them up and when they got went to pick them up they knew this guy and they ended up knowing each other and they were friends with this guy and this driver and and at the end of it he said just to show that it was the Lord working he said at the end of it he says just take a thousand dollars for all of them you know and so he gave them they're cheap so he got all those windows they're cheap amen so praise the Lord he was very glad for that but anyway um I asked him I said if we come up I said do we have a midweek service somewhere do you have a midweek service well he said well there's a church in Akron Ohio he says about an hour away I mean I had been told about that before so if I go he says he wants he would certainly want to take you know go along with us up there amen and go to that church so I don't know where he's at I don't know if he even got a vehicle or what but I do know that he offered me a room to stay and so forth he says but now we don't have any power or electric we don't have any air conditioner it's still fans and battery so you know anyway so that's kind of where he is and that and I think you know they're just they're real hungry they you know real hungry for the word but that's what's going on and and like I said you know they're just building building it and so that's right in five miles from what I was raised amen and the closest one would be Akron so we plan on going up there um so anyway that's that's what we found out and that's where it is and I'm gonna go before we would even help with that financially I certainly want to find out just how legit how how I feel about the whole thing you know but I do want to go up and you know meet some people and I from what I understand there's different groups there's different Church groups that are you know have come out of the Amish that you know you have a chance there they had Revival Services down there and so forth that he was telling about I don't want to get into all of that but amen and it's where a lot of people and different ones were even baptized and so forth but anyway all right is that the only one I think that may be about the last one but that's that's what I found out and praise the Lord I was pretty excited I said Lord I just hope uh you know and so I don't know you know what will all happen but I certainly hope that um the Lord does a real work there and praise the Lord amen and so any time you're doing something like that for the Lord and and I just pray that God will establish a real Rock Solid Message Church there amen praise the Lord it would be really good to see amen stand with me we'll get into the word of God tonight amen all right as he was trying something different aren't we all right well we'll see how that works amen praise the Lord God is good isn't he good to see y'all it's good to be back amen amen praise the Lord amen so I just wanna I felt like this last message that I preached again I just I mean there's a certain direction of it that I didn't go to that I want to just go tonight if that's okay amen so we'll just kind of pick up amen where we left off once again and and so forth me praying for Brother Brad he's going to take this Sunday Services amen amen and so amen God bless you I I listen to brother amen uh brother Jonathan Jones amen he was real fired up Sunday wasn't him in that was good I really enjoyed that that was real good good to have him and so forth I mean let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we just come before you humbly before you once again Lord thanking you Lord Jesus that we have such a rock in that age Lord Jesus when everything being around us is Shifting sounds Lord to know that we know that we know father that we're on the Rock Lord Jesus and that we know you on a personal basis father Lord we thank you Father for your goodness and your mercy to us Lord Jesus and we certainly pray for that work in Ohio God that you would blessed Lord Jesus and father that you would just be with each and every one Lord that is putting forth their effort Lord Jesus to let there be a light in the midst of Darkness father we ask God tonight that you'll bless the meditation of our heart Lord Jesus bless your word anoint us to preach tonight father your word and bless each one that has come out on this hot day to hear more of your word and to dedicate themselves more fervently to you Lord Jesus we ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen I want to speak on the fruit of our nature the fruit of our nature bearing more fruit amen the fruit of our nature I think last time we spoke on Amen our nature and how that that's what the power of God does is to change our very desires our nature that's something that you can't fight a lot of times it's nature amen and so uh other than a transformation and so praise the Lord if you will turn your Bibles I have a lot of scriptures but I'll just amen I think we will perhaps start with um let's just go to Galatians we'll start with Galatians five Galatians 5. Satan powerless isn't that right rendering him powerless I mean making it so that he has or tying him or binding him with a chain of circumstances because amen if he doesn't have anything to work through he can't do anything amen oh my uh when you just think about how many knows Eve just opened up her mind isn't that right and the devil got one word in there that he shouldn't have got in there just one word that he slipped in and he changed everything amen how many knows that's why we have to guard our mind and our thoughts that come into our hearts into my mind because just one word because Spirits goes with words one word One thought whatever it can change your whole entire being amen praise the Lord good to see you tonight brother wood amen praise the Lord amen so now let's read in the Galatians 5. and verse 16. notice I want to speak about the nature amen or the fruit of our nature praise the Lord this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusts us against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led by the spirit and you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatic tree witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath strife seditions heresies and beings and murderers and drunkenness and revelings and such like up to which I tell you before as I have told you in times past the day which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit amen that's why I called amen how many notes this is your first nature what we just read about was is your first nature it's the fruit of your first nature amen here is the fruit of your second nature but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace and long-suffering and gentleness and goodness and faith and meekness and Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts and if you live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit God bless the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen we want to talk a little bit about the black dog and the white dog with the help of the lord we want to talk about amen when we talk about our flesh and we want to talk about the spirit is that okay it is certainly something that all through the Bible all down through was much spoken of and I think I will probably conclude with a man Paul all in Romans 7 where he talks about aiming the Flesh and the power of the Flesh and what it does but I wrote down here talking about our nature now the first nature that we have it gives the devil a open door isn't that right amen he gives him complete an Open Door amen an Open Season so to speak amen first we know that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking the truth no speaking lies so we know our first nature is devilish it's oh my um I think it was Paul that said you know in Romans 7 he says that I know that in my flesh in me and then in parentheses they put in there that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing amen talk about the flesh we don't want to talk about the flesh for a little while before we talk about the other amen and I believe it is over in in John 6 63 says it is the spirit that quickness the flesh prophetth nothing amen Hallelujah the flash don't like that too much first you are just worthless wouldn't it be nice when you got born again when you got saved that this flesh also got converted wouldn't it have been nice but the flesh never did get converted did it amen I made this statement the other day about the flesh anybody remembers what I said probably said so much you can't pick out which one it is I said you are actually living in your greatest enemy's house you lived there Paul talked much about it that which I would that I do not and so forth they're not right for to will is with me amen that flesh brother man said it was the biggest enemy that you had the biggest enemy I had not God or the devil is this your flesh he said that is your biggest enemy amen oh my so we see here the first birth gives the Devil complete Liberty and it starts with and I just want to go down through here would that be okay let's take some of these in Galatians 5. now the first things now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery the very first thing and the foremost is adultery let me ask you a question what was the original sin adultery was the original sin God gave adam his wife remember he built her and made her and gave it to Adam and brother bam says before he could get to her the devil the serpent got to her amen and beguiled her she spear she committed first of all spiritual fornication by believing what the devil said that how many knows when you believe what the devil tells you over God you're committing spiritual fornication amen then before that then that the natural Act of course we happened you know it was adultery amen so one of the one of the one of the strongest forces in the world is the world of adultery and so forth I believe the Bible said that a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after the sign and their man said that he was talking about this generation wasn't he I mean he knows remember that he said he was talking about this generation Domino that's the world we're living in oh my it's terrible it's such an adulterous generation until the prophet of God said that women were becoming so common the women didn't even want them anymore and they become homosexuals that's pretty low isn't it that is real low and of course we know I mean you think about it you know and Jesus says you know you ain't got to go out there amen you ain't got to go out there and commit adultery with the woman to commit adultery with a woman how many knows that a woman can be as pure to her husband as she can possibly be but when she goes out there and dresses in an immoral way and causes a man to lust after her brother bam said on the day of judgment she would answer for committing adultery with the men that looked at her and lusted after her can you wow huh never unfaithful to her husband never unfaithful to her a boyfriend amen amen the disc goes this should go everywhere amen and any man that looks upon a woman now how many knows and and you talk about the things that are out there and and so forth it's terrible isn't it you better you better have the second nature you better have the second nature it is the power of the Sun and Lord I will give you the power to be able to turn your heads nowadays because for a man brother bam says the way to the Dress he almost can't blame a man for ravishing women did he say it or not he said you almost can't you almost why because if he ain't born again if he don't have that power and that woman advertises herself getting a little plain tonight amen that all mine does the way to shoot and act the way that she does y'all remember the story of of uh the man that had his daughter out of gas station she was totally dressed immoral and so forth and somebody whistled at her and the dad got all mad wanted to whoop him better bam says that man don't need a whooping the dad needed a whooping for allowing his daughter to go out there in their first place amen so we're living in a very very adulterous generation and they said that they would seek after a sign and there would be no sign given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet what was the sign of Jonah the prophet brother bam said it was the sign of the Resurrection he was in the belly of the whale for three days so to speak dead and come forth again amen he was assigned to the resurrection this generation was given to sign of the resurrected Jesus Christ they got their signs amen so that's the first thing brother bam also said one place he says you know all the beard joints and the liquor and everything else he says it'll never send as many souls to hell as an immoral dress woman the immoral dress woman sends more souls to Hell than all of the beer joints why because it's a powerful thing amen I know it's very very powerful tool in the hands of the devil so that's the first thing he mentions that's the flesh if you ain't got the Holy Ghost amen you won't have the power to resist hardly amen with the internet and everything that's going on just remember this when you look at a woman to lust after her in your heart you're guilty huh of cheating on your wife huh you look at the wrong your justice of committing adultery with her Lord help us hello we need the spirit amen need that second nature amen that's your first it's just a natural thing amen that's right but it's sinful right adultery fornication we're brother bam says fornication is unclean living amen same act as an adult or married person just not married yet it's fornication I mean remembers that amen and certainly have that going on today don't we look at the open door there's even brother bam said look at your schools hardly any of them you can't find a school uh school girl Harley that's a virgin anymore coming out of schools amen somebody wants a virgin you've got to find some country country church somewhere somewhere where they really kept a close eye on their daughters like strict hand on them amen why so easy I mean no it's very easy he meant to slip to slide amen and amen and fornication is on the ram page Amen on the Rampage amen totally and now notice the third one is uncleanness amen how many knows we were born with a dirty nature to begin with never have to teach that child to steal you never have to teach Child Alive no the cookie try to Candy you know it doesn't matter that's just something in their nature it just do it amen born in the shapening world it's iniquity come into this world speaking lies aren't you glad for the second birth how many thought for the second part that's why we have to be born again amen praise the Lord adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness amen lasciviousness hahaha lasciviousness means to hold on a second I took pictures of these interpretations and uh well it's lust basically lust or the passion of lust the height of passion of lust is lasciviousness is what the interpretation was amen lasciviousness idolatry idolatry Idol worshipers Amen Let me see if I can find that one I think I have one here that I want to certainly uh the worship of Idols extreme admiration or love or reverence something or someone but a bam says not one might ask me to retrace what I have just said that it was very likely picture today we may not think that we are idle worshipers but we are and the government endorses people today are Idol worshipers because they worship Bibles some of them were movie stars some of them money isn't that right some televisions but all that you put before God is an idol Hallelujah then he goes to talking about evenly sometimes he'll put your church as an idol you know how many people that will not leave a church not leave this Saturday other one to hear the truth then their church is idle movie stars are idols basketball stars or idols amen I hate to drive on Sunday but I drove home Sunday and as I went down through Cincinnati man I come across this place where there was just cars everywhere and I come down through the bypass and I says boy that's your car auction this is a big car auction down here on the left as I went it just kept going more and more and more and then all of a sudden I got to look at it it was a bunch of baseball fields I thought wow you know didn't that the way it is nowadays nowadays they geared off for Sunday uh you know when you could be in church to play baseball and so forth but remember brothers and sisters now I'm on this very long but whatever you could be your wife your children could be your job could be my certainly could be money where people love money than me more than they love God be careful that money don't become your Idol amen God help us not to put anything else before god let's not be idolater how many believe the Holy Spirit oh my the Holy Spirit if you really got the Holy Spirit he's first in your life I don't know about you but let me tell you about this me I'm a busy man I'm too busy still too busy I ain't hardly doing nothing I'm still too busy about a job so many things that need to be done but I have to still tell myself look put God first here put God first he's going on that trip I wasn't on my knees extra much to see God I really want you to do so I want you to use me if you can learn for something and I found out my trip was much much prosperous by putting God first and asking and praying amen you know we was getting ready for church tonight and I thought we'd be going to be half hour today 45 minutes early and I said you know we were supposed to come to church so that we're ready so there amen and we're we're preparing amen for what's coming and support us is you know we're supposed to according to the uh the the

I didn't look what that is I think all of us know what which is amen something about I I thought about somebody that just lies she'll be wishing you isn't that right dishonest and so forth amen next

out of there hatred so that's one of the fruits of our nature that's a carnal fruit of our carnal nature not only believe that fruit is important fruit is important um maybe uh maybe uh I'll read it after we get through these before we get into the Fruit of the Spirit all right hatred variance variance let me see if I can pull variants up here amen variance means the fact or quality of being different Divergent inconsistent the state or fact of disagreeing or quarreling amen now didn't Jesus say I uh I am come to bring a man or a wife a son or daughter to bring a variance yeah even Jesus came to bring variance well how's let me explain that now that's with Darkness how many knows light is very variant from Darkness in other words there will be a difference between your wife your husband your mom your dad anybody that doesn't believe the truth there's gonna be variance there amen I got into a discussion with my sister amen with about marriage and divorce and amen and we got to talking about whether a man can remarry a woman nobody can ever be married I says Ah Jesus said accept it'd be for fornication yeah I know but none of you she's better not to do and I says well you know we was there at the table with everybody I wasn't going to have a big fuss we just have to agree to disagree but that you know I I said you know there was except when there's an accept in there that means there is an exception except there's an exception amen aren't you glad that Prophet that brought us the truth amen of all the people that were married and two or three times amen I remember brother Alan sister and I think when they first come to church to not preach on marriage and divorce and I said man if you're in this shape man you're lost and all these other stuff but at the end I could brought it in whoever the prophet of God says now God forgive you for that just don't ever do it again you're all messed up the churches don't know for sure what the truth was and this Saturday and I got all messed up but God straightened it up and they were like oh my God that's right and so Richard scripture talks about that isn't that right all right now how did I get on that I don't know for sure but anyway so praise the Lord variance that's what it was talking about variance amen now how many knows that Paul variance is is to have an argument to have these differences right or Paul talked about I I can't hardly believe it but I hear there is divisions among you how many knows what if it causes divisions people that are variants that have uh you know that are disagreement or one wants it this way one wants it that way and so forth and you have parents you but in the house how many know that we're not supposed to have variants amongst believers Paul said that you'd be of the same mind of the same thought with the same goal One Faith one Lord one baptism all positions are it's the same goal we don't need somebody in the front of the car pushing it backwards and two people on the front back are pushing it Forward you're not gonna get very far we all got to push it the same direction I believe he's trying to push a little bit hey man an evening like Tabernacle talk the wrong direction see God bring this together and make us all one the one mind one Accord not variance differences amen differences in other words that differences I mean comes into play also amen oh yeah praise the Lord oh my all right now that's right variance emulation I'm not sure if I picked that one up or not come on open now for me emulation sounds like Pride to me huh trying to pass somebody up or be better than somebody else that ain't no place in the house of God aren't you glad that the greatest man of all time brother Branham outside of Jesus Christ and Paul and them oh my how great a man he was and he says just call me brother don't call me Dr Mr you know isn't it's something that he didn't even say call me Reverend Brian to call me brother he could humble himself in such a way amen not trying to make himself something else or and so forth uh emulation Wrath anger right I mean those boy I'll tell you what and if you don't think you have anger just hang on give it a little time we'll find out if you've got anger or not because God tests you in those things amen he'll throw you a curveball somebody will do something you don't like at all that you didn't expect and it just there it goes you lost your cool lost your temper bam says when you do what did he say the Holy Ghost takes its flat amen because the holy trust Holy Ghost simply don't lose his temper no the Holy Ghost I like this keeps his cool the Holy Ghost keeps its cool that's right it don't get all hot no it keeps its cool that's all right Laurel take care of it amen praise be to God so be expecting it tomorrow somebody'll run over your foot or something you know or you know call your name you don't like whatever it might be we'll find out if there's wrath but in our carnal nature there was Wrath is that right Wrath all right look at look at that the next one is strife where there's strife and contention is the Bible said there's every evil work amen did you get did you ever get into our Judo fashioned argument with your wife or somebody just a good old-fashioned argument and fuss and stew and strife and oh my they scream because she ain't listening or you ain't listening and you raise your voice huh was that the Holy Ghost no that was just your natural the fruit of your first nature isn't that right amen I'm guilty Lord help us we think that we'll get our point across despite being getting louder most of the time we think now I'll tell you this there's a lot of people that have that think that by getting angry and getting out of the car over the club or something doesn't make it any better it really don't the next guy's gotta eat a bigger club or whatever amen my I told I was told stories about my dad now I shouldn't tell but anyway they were telling stories about the buyers with one of my second cousins and his girlfriend there well let's not say too much our second or his girlfriend's here you know to talk too much and they went to talk about my dad being on top of a guy with a knife fixed to the stab him foreign [Music] but anyway you talk about wrath isn't that right strife that's all not something Amy and we want I like what brother Brian I listened to his Sunday school lessons about always stay gentle I mean no it's the Holy Ghost is always gentle it's Meek it's quiet amen I like that quote that was really good amen that's what the holy spirit is be kind gentle amen loving forgiving one another amen okay variance immolation wrath strife seditions seditions I won't go into it but it says that it meant somebody perhaps like what Trump did he got on the radio and I go stop that go and stop we need to stop it huh he was causing a sedition yeah everybody let's stop this election fraud and this that or the other when you cause a division basically or somebody to rise up against the rule of law or whatever it might be amen seditions amen so that's a carnal way carnally immense additions and heresies heresies amen I think I've got heresies here um heresy means a belief or opinion contrary to Orthodox religion amen especially Christian doctrine amen so I like that an opinion that's contrary to what we call the truth how much heresy do we have going on out there amen even around the ranks of the message anything that doesn't stay with what the prophet said it's heresy heresy something contrary to the religious Orthodox Doctrine or the real truth anything contrary to that real truth amen and you know they did call Paul they say that he was a heretic because he was preaching the gospel in Jesus Christ contract to what they thought was right amen but Paul said the way after the way that they call heresy they call it they made a terracy to them I said why do they call her and she's so worthy by the god of my fathers amen that's right we're a heretic to all untruth Amen to their Doctrine their original Doctrine we're here at ticks but the true heretic is somebody that goes contrary to the Bible amen heresies and the yings amen I just thought about this verse when I've come across that did not mean to do it but here it is verse 26 the last verse of the chapter says let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another ending one another or being jealous amen amen let's hear it if I can um Envy means the feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions or qualities or being jealous of what somebody else has Envy is that right green with is it Green Envy or is it green jealousy I think it's green jealousy or something like that but Envy it's about green too amen Envy don't and how many knows man you hear somebody oh somebody got this got that or oh got a new house got a new car and this that or the other don't envy no I wish I had I deserved that they didn't no praise be to God hallelujah do a little jig for him glory I'm happy for you man I hope the next one is a Lamborghini we go from Chevy to Ford or should we say Ford Chevy you're really getting a lot of trouble right there it meant to all the way up amen don't envy one another provoking one another don't be envious but the carnal nature is the envy it's part of that carnal nature that fruit of that first nature amen murder whoa wow that's the truth isn't it boy my mama if we would do what we have thought we'd all be murderers wouldn't we well I hope you don't have to raise your hand but if you actually manifest it would have happened the way that you thought you'd be a murderer because let's be honest our first Nature has murder in it it's in the DNA of our first nature is to murder people amen why do you think it's out there like it is didn't I tell you there's an open door for the devil and being Strife you see our divided nation you see this Strife between the right the left Democrats and Republicans oh my The Strife amongst the world and the Bible says there'll be Strife Wars and all of these things amongst the Nations amongst the people among everybody amen except the bride let there be no Strife Among Us amen let's not strife amen praise the Lord amen murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in times past that they would do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God amen praise be to God amen in Corinthians let me see here First Corinthians 9. First Corinthians 9 I believe it is let me see if this is the one I'm looking for yeah 9 and 27. now we have come to the conclusion of the first nature Nate first nature and you know as Paul said that this first nature is of all is always right their bias trying to resurrect how many believes that that nature has to be brought into subjection amen it has to be brought into subjection I thought about Paul when he said when he was talking about running a race in chapter 9 of First Corinthians he says no ye not the day which run all run in a race all but one receiveth to buy so run that you may obtain for every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain the corruptable crown but we had Incorruptible dad therefore I therefore so run not as uncertainly so if I die not as one that beat a fear but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection oh my brother bam says when your body is coming subject to the word coming obedient to the word it shows that there is a resurrection for you because one of these days his body's gonna come so subject amen Until It's Gonna Change in the very Adams how many beliefs we're going to do a disappearing act one of these days I'm gonna do a disappearing act and I thought this back here I thought this fellow I was back in the office I said we're all running the race huh all the message churches around were all running a race my question is who's going to win who's going to win because that body change is the win who's going to go in that Rapture is the big question isn't that right and I like what Paul said there I'll tell you what you're not going to go until you got this under control this has to come into subjection it brings this body into subjection praise be to God aren't you glad that there's something that brings it under control because out there it's out of control but the end in control Amen Let me hurry up through here just a little bit amen Paul said much about this about this battle that you and I are in amen I don't like too much we're not here to preach my thought amen the only time I'm going to give me my thought is one I'm going to let you know it's my thoughts is that right is that okay even brother Brandon would say now this is me amen but remember in the age just previous he says I will keep you from the hour of Temptation I wonder if we ain't in the hour of Temptation the hour of trying being tried being tempted to the fullest amen amen he meant something bad but I'll tell you this we are certainly in an hour of trying and you have to keep under my body you got to keep it in control and bring it into subjection at least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway praise be to God we can't quit tonight without finishing our thought on the other side of this is that okay y'all got plenty of time praise the Lord I think uh Jonathan went to one close to one Sunday didn't he man so if we go to nine that'll be about balancing things out fruit of the spirit next praise be to God amen let's look at this first I want to look at another one amen and that is what Jesus said about fruit you want to hear what Jesus said about fruit and bearing fruit Jesus said in John 15 he says I am the vine my father is the husbandman every branch and me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every Bear Branch that bear fruit he purges it that it might break forth more fruit oh my remember my message tonight is bearing more fruit amen not this other food we don't need none of this other I'm going to say it before I forget if I possibly can let me see where it is three I mean before I forget if I I can do it um what you sow you will reap that would be James okay James let me see all right nope I can't remember where it is but it talks about how he said that uh what you sow you shall reap how many believe that and when you sow to these things especially the carnal flesh he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption and he that soweth to the spirit shall receive your life amen so these things they were talking about this fruit of our nature each and every one of them amen there's a it's like a seed that we sow amen and it produces fruit isn't that right so we got to be careful of what we plan back to our thoughts Saint John 15 back to what we were reading purges it that may bring forth more fruit now you are expensive the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I and you accept the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept ye abide in me praise be to God Amen I am the vine you're the branches he didn't abide that's been me and I in the him the same bringeth forth much fruit boy if there's just one thing in my heart tonight that I can see it and long for more is I long for more of the fruit of God how many wants more we see some but I want to see more we see some of the power of God but we wanna see more I want to see more more and God wants to see more God wants to see a bunch all right speaking of it it just comes to my brain that is a a uh peach or a let's just say a orange tree sitting out there amen half the branches are kind of withered and dry and just not they have a whole lot of leaves a lot the leaves are a little shriveled up and out of the whole big tree you can find about four oranges huh maybe that's where some of us are I hope not but just a little fruit is coming forth amen now that's not how God wants us to look does he no notice he said every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it brings forth more fruit God is it just tonight in this and seeing in our lives the fruit of the spirit in a greater way more praise the Lord I am the viney of the branches heated the abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do go ahead you can do again you can do nothing you could absolutely that's why I said if you're gonna do anything you've got to get in the spirit first in the church says well you know we gotta get in the spirit he says don't go through the motions that's what the world is doing that's what a lot of us a lot of times are doing we're going through the motions I had somebody tell me he says I'm just going through the motions I didn't like the statement I didn't know why but I really didn't like the statement I was like I'm going through the mode I don't like to just go through the motions I like for it to be real hey man when you get in the spirit brother Bob's in Church's book I even brought it out here to read to him he says get in the spirit first then the works will manifest themselves then it'll just fall out to you well I'd sure like to have a lot of more Worship in my life to get more the holy ghost in your life you'll have more worship you want more love you gotta get in this if that's the only way you'll ever get it Paul said many times we are not in the flesh that which I would I do let you know under the law you're not in the flesh he says but you're in the spirit amen praise the Lord amen got a little excited there is that okay hope it didn't disturb anybody how many believes we need more how many wants more I want more without him you can do nothing you're just a branches he's divine Divine doesn't bring forth the fruit the branches bear the fruit but huh Hallelujah the branches have to be connected to the Vine oh there's no lights coming out but when that life comes out you can't help but do what your nature does God speed the day up that we won't try to act like somebody else but we'll just be who we are when we worship God oh my I like the sweet songs when they all were singing when you come on here as soon as we come in them doors folks put everything else aside when that song leader comes up here and he begins to open his mouth and sing a song Everybody begin to remember this now it's time to worship God not time to think about anything else but worshiping God the songs that she's sing everywhere did you say Amazing Grace I don't care what it is let it come from the bottom of your heart or it'll be a state in God's nose it's got to be real only be real by the spirit Hallelujah oh I love this that's right now notice without me you can do once again nothing the flesh prophetth nothing Jesus said it is the spirit that gives life folks I'm here to tell you again if you've heard it a thousand times you and I are to live in that spirit live by the spirit not the flesh how many knows we take so good care of this flesh we take cozy wait man we just baby it and Pat it and take care of it and put the nicest clothes on it do our hair just rotten well come on keep yeah Lady it's quite trim them eyebrows your little Bob's got driven up too everything but ask her to go up my nose and give me those chairs out I pulled up myself by the way we do everything about this body It's gotta be just right amen but let me tell you something how many believe we need to work on the spirit a little bit and then morning and doing the night and every moment say God how is my spirit I am in my spirit Lord how are you doing in there we wouldn't be happier people if we lived to taking care of our spirit as much as we do to our flesh so determine after tonight if you don't get nothing else determine tomorrow morning you're going to cater not so much to deflect amen if you're resident with Christy No things that are from above not the things that dominate the Bible says where Christ sitters on the right hand of God set your affections on things above and not on the things that the bar he'd allowed the world of the things of the world the love of God ain't in it you love this world God's loving in you amen praise be to God you love him where's my belief where did my Galatians go come on back here now laughs back to Galatians Galatians just before Ephesians and so forth but the fruit of spirit is love I like that amen how many knows Paul said man if I have knowledge him and all knowledge and wisdom and Faith to move mountains if you ain't got the love of God in you you ain't got nothing God's got to have God's love in your heart not hate not variance not Strife but love that's the first fruit of the spirit that's the first thing that happens is you've got love for your enemy got love for everybody out there amen if there's anything I could say to anybody out there is this I just want you to have what I have I remember my brother moaning when I brought the gospel he says he didn't understand he says but I want what you got I want what you got what's his words you can have it because if you ain't got something that you want to give to everybody else you probably ain't got something worth giving anybody else amen and that something is Jesus Christ I mean that's the Holy Ghost praise be to God amen all right love next one are you with me what is it Joy oh I have found his grace is all complete he supplies everything well I sit and learned at Jesus feet I am free as free ended well it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full come on people are you happy amen the next fruit is joy

good I'd buy it again when you give me have enough serving you that right there that makes you feel I'm good how many knows it's good oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen mother David say David knew all about the joy of the Lord he did the joy of the Lord is my strength amen praise be to God Joy Hallelujah long suffering oh seems like we've taken a little turn here folks somebody's suffering huh foreign it said long suffering how many knows that when you are carnal you have a short fuse huh you can say to somebody sometimes maybe your wife or husband huh say just one little thing boy your fuse yourself short what what because maybe there's carnality or irritation we get to the end of our rope so to speak the volcano is fixing the blow so to speak amen it just takes a little bit the straw that broke the camel's back why because we get them to carnality and so forth but when you've got the Holy Ghost you can be long suffering Jesus was long-suffering on the cross wasn't he he was beat he was spit on and on and on and on and on and on goes you know I I uh boy I wish I would remember I think I do remember I was reading that the other day and it said that don't you realize that presently I could call for 12 was it 12 Legions of angels or 12 Legions of Angels were 72 000. I mean those Heavens gonna be full of angels just there is 72 000 he could more is it more than 72 000 angels and he could have changed the whole scene but then how did he say with the scriptures be fulfilled amen Hallelujah long suffering how many dollars you got to be long-suffering as a Christian God is long-suffering with this generation brother Bannon was ready to blow it up way back in his day didn't he why don't you just wipe this thing off boy oh boy if we could ever think in that way we would think that way God it's about time to wipe this thing off but God is long suffering there's still people out there that need to come to the light there's still some that needs salvation how many folks let me tell you something it's time to work you're gonna do something for the Lord you better do it amen praise the Lord okay long suffering and gentleness amen gentleness sweetness oh my most of the time our sisters have it already isn't that right they're gentle they don't talk loud and boisterous like we do huh you're gentle but yet for us Brothers it tests we have to be gentleness amen goodness and faith praise be to God meekness oh my meekness not to be better than somebody else bigger than somebody else we gotta have the best Church the biggest church the most glamorous Church huh it has to be better than somebody else no just stay and be happy with what God gave us amen be thankful for what God gave us and work with that meek temperance self-control against such there is no law and they that our Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections at lust I mean I believe that if we live in the spirit let us let us all walk in the spirit how many beliefs how many say God that's me I need to walk more in the spirit whatever I do needs to be done in the spirit Paul said it this way amen he said um for a thing verse 8 verse 5 of chapter 8 of Romans I'm saying it backwards Romans 8 and 5. all right all right for that or after the flesh to mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit oh my God oh my the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death that's right I mean he knows that you let that carnal mind think and you let it run it's so contrary where you want to kill somebody now you want to try to do something good to them boy if I had a chance I would help that person how many has had that thought I have I asked God if I if I were saying they mean whatever it be if man if I could I would I would you know lay my life down for him it was them to be alive or me or whatever that's the kind of that's the kind of love that you're supposed to have amen how many believe that not to have carnally we're not to be carnally minded but to be spiritually minded now that is life and peace praise be to God I don't know about you but I I'm just thankful to be alive and I'm talking about a spiritual life because there's a lot of people that are dead while they live there's a lot of people to walk around with Doom and Gloom yeah they have no happiness but you you and me how many leaves we ought to be the happiest people on the face of ours God help us to take me out out of there did you get it Steve got it God I said we ought to be no God let us be the happiest people not the honor be I wanna be oh Glory I was just going to have some teaching tonight but I'm this is really doing me

this is God's book this is absolutely the truth you can rely on it there's a lot of a lot of confusion out there people don't know what to believe what to follow what is absolute folks they don't know and you can be thankful let me tell you something we can be thankful that we have the message of the hour that we have a church like we had to do that stands on the word of God we take it for granted don't there's a lot out there that man you'd have to question you'd have to wonder huh oh my praise the Lord all right we're running into that overtime now we got to win this game we're in overtime but yeah we're going to stay we ain't gonna leave early right game but the Christian ought to be just enthusiastic about what he believes as those are out there at the ball games to read the code I was going to read hello they boy they get in the spirit don't they man they get they're at it they can bring their baseball caps they bring their but they bring their chairs they bring their drink they come prepare that's why I thought Ernie man when we come we ought to come prepared hey we're gonna get in the spirit here that's why and that's what it all happens everything Paul said if I pray I pray in the spirit amen if I uh whatever I do I do in the spirit miracles happen mother Bible says if you need prayer and then if you need healing get in the spirit that's where it's at get in the spirit because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not subject to God and not in the law of God neither in thee can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh how many ain't in the flesh that's right preaching I'm Not In the Flesh anymore I don't live by the flesh I don't want to Bear any fruit to the flesh I only want to Bear the Fruit of the Spirit I want to pair more of it I want more the love of God how many fit me I want more bear more fruit Jesus said so that the father may be glorified oh Hallelujah if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear a little fruit no that you bear much fruit let's go from the church tonight never be the same let's go from the church tonight and say God have me to have twice the love twice a piece the law twice the long suffering twice the prayer life twice the reading life huh twice the spirit a whole lot more than what I've had before let's not go out the same determining your hearts I'm gonna live in the spirit I know I got to take care of things but God is first and everything I do because

disciples I'm sure everybody here tonight say God I want to be your disciple I want to Bear much fruit for I am stand if you will with me tonight musicians if you'll come I want to sing that song if
