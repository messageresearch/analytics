TRANSCRIPT
========================================
probably he's got the newest truck probably of anybody. Amen. And can you put it on autopilot? &gt;&gt; He won't run an edge. You can take your hand off your gas. Can you take your hand off your brakes? Can you take your hand off the steering wheel? Wow. So, all you got to do is push your butt and it's on autopilot. It won't WRECKING THE OTHER GUY, WON'T RACKING the nets. I mean, at least that's the way YOU AND I WANT TO BE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD. AMEN. LET'S JUST LET HIM BE THE PILOT. Let him be THE PILOT. OH, NO. NO. A lot of us older folks say, "I don't trust it. My wife says that. I wouldn't want that autopilot. Let me have that steering wheel. You give me that brakes and YOU LET ME HAVE THAT GAS." THAT'S THE way we are IN THE CHRISTIAN WALK. HELLO. I LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE CONTROL OF THINGS. But how many believes THIS PILOT? AMEN. CHRIST IS OUR PILOT. HE WON'T WRECK YOU. JUST LET GO OF THE WILL AND ENJOY THE RIDE. ENJOY BEING A CHRISTIAN. ENJOY GOING TO CHURCH. ENJOY THE THINGS OF GOD AUTOPILOT. That's what we need.
