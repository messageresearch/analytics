TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen let's all stand if we could good to be in the house of the lord this morning happy to be a christian happy that god still cares about us loves us and and provides for us and gives us a good place to come and worship this morning and if you would turn with me into the book of psalms 27 children you can be dismissed for sunday school book of psalms 27 we may have read this recently but it's been on my heart and brother branham used psalms 27 when he preached the rapture uh one of the last messages he preached there and so it's it's a beautiful scripture and and it holds it holds dear to us so we'll read psalms 27 and we'll just read it all so the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid though on who should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident for in thy time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock hero lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me i had not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation teach me thy ways o lord and lead me in the in a plain path because of my enemies i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living altogether wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen my heart wait i say on the lord let's just pray over the scripture heavenly father we're just grateful to be in your house this morning lord and we're thankful for the word as the word's been placed before us lord jesus and lord we just come to hear from what you would have in store for us this morning we asked your blessings upon the this reading that was just read into our hearts lord we asked your blessings upon the sunday school uh the lessons that will be taught and lord upon the minister of the word and the the singing of our voice and the musicians this morning we asked your blessings and favors lord and as the word says in the scripture we just read we wait on you lord for we can do nothing in ourself but we trust in you in jesus name amen brother lebron you can be seated morning brothers and sisters you know we were reading that psalm everything about psalm tells you one thing uh your example everything you're looking to is not the circumstances around you or what's going on in the world but your example the thing you should be looking to the thing that's providing you light and comfort is the lord himself jesus christ so what should you worry about you know if it's already been settled if you would turn with me to if you want to hold two places ephesians the fifth chapter and then back in joshua everyone knows that joshua is a great man of god if anyone i think of when i think of joshua the thought that comes to my mind when i think of him and his example you know there's a saying among you know always faithful if you think of joshua or any man like joshua that's mentioned in the bible he was always faithful in his office he never wavered from what god destined him to do or told him to do he was always faithful in the things of the lord i mean that's that's a true example for any of us to follow whether it's in a natural sense when you're dealing with people or in an experience or in a religious experience that you're always faithful in the service that god puts you in but i was just thinking of something that's in these chapters if you would go to the fourth chapter you know we have a foundation in our lives we we have the word of god we have the experience that god gives us in the word the foundation that he builds with and i'm just going to read if i read too much you'll have to forgive me i i say that a lot but i do it i'll start at this fourth verse and this goes they were just about to cross over the jordan river joshua allows the people to prepare themselves and i'll read in here if my pronunciations are wrong i ask you forgive me and this is the fourth chapter of the book of joshua and said and it came to pass when all the people were clean and passed over jordan that the lord spoke unto joshua saying take you twelve men out of the people of the tribe amen and command ye them saying take your hands out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm fall of stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in a lodging place where you shall lodge this night joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe of man so every man was told to take a stone out of the river and then joshua said unto them over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of the jordan and take you up every man you as stone upon his shoulders so these weren't small stones they had to put them on their shoulders so they were substantial in size upon his shoulders according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel this may be a sign among you that your children ask their fathers in a time saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan and the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be a memorial unto the children of israel forever so joshua was setting up a memorial he the lord knew there would come a day when joshua wouldn't be here the children that cross over the jordan wouldn't be here but god left an example for the children in the land that they could look back on to know that god had done something for him and there was an example for him and uh if you jump with me to uh ephesians the fifth chapter if i don't get ahead of myself i i was sitting there this morning and i was just thinking about the world we live in this morning and both in our in a christian perspective and in a worldly perspective the the devil and society is trying to remove all them stones all those examples from us as people whether it's in a governmental sense or in a christian set all the examples they're tearing down for you as an individual that you had trust in they're trying to put everything in a place that's worse in the church than it is out there in the world because you don't have no confidence in what's out there in the world but when you see people in this message or people that you thought were christians and you start seeing people like that fall but they have no foundation anymore you know those are those that is tearing at the very fabric of society of church and the people and i'll just i was just thinking about it what it is is unless you have that foundation you have that experience in your heart and in your life this morning you're going to be you're not going to be able to stand in the age that we live in and i just wrote here there was numerous examples that we're supposed to follow but uh i was just wrote you have joshua and the 12 stones where god actually instructed a man to leave a physical example for the children of israel to know that what god had done for him and then he goes on you can think of jesus chose 12 disciples that when he knew he was going to leave the earth he chose 12 disciples that after he ascended and came back in the form of the holy ghost that he had 12 people on the face of the earth that could spread the message of god and then you go then you think of paul's ministry and his miracles and his teachings all these principles and you can see it going through the last 2000 years through the church where we all know from the message of the hour god raises up a messenger raises up a message for that time that we live in and people follow it but what i'm thinking about this morning is the devil your enemy your adversary is trying to tear down every foundation around you so that you have no confidence in the things that you believe and you're going to choose yourself or as an individual you've got to choose what you're going to believe and what you're going to hold firm to and i'll just read here in ephesians the fifth chapter uh some scriptures here this is what paul had the syrian he says be you there follow followers of god as dear children it goes back to that psalm we read you know that light that's in you as an individual is the life that god showed for you and he goes on be there followers of god as dear children and walk in the love as christ also had loved us and had given himself as an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet-smelling savior so we have this is paul's teaching the people here are the examples that are laid out before him and i'm what i'm saying is everything around us in the world today is trying to tear these foundations away from you and he goes on sweets but fornication and uncleanness covenantness let it not once be named among you has become the saints neither filthiness or foolishness talking or jesting which is not convenient but rather giving thanks for this you know the no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater or have any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god you know i think i look at these scriptures and when you look at the church world you know you desire for everyone to be saved you desire mercy for everyone but if they don't have good strong teaching and good strong examples they're not going to be able to stand and he goes on to say here let no man deceive you with vain words because of these things which cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience and be you not therefore partakers with them and that's really important in the age that we live in finding yourself not partaking in the same things that they're doing and be you there for some for you that were sometimes sometimes darkness but now you are the light in the world walk as children of the light and for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth proving what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with on fruitful works of darkness you know sometimes do i get off on a tangent you know in a day at work or when i'm home not doing anything do i just do i find myself not being fruitful in the things that maybe god wants me to do or am i spending too much time doing things that really god aren't fruitful that things that god doesn't want me to do and then he goes on to say i lost my place proving what is acceptable on the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them i know i read a lot but when i'm reading is not what my opinion is it's what god's word has to say i know i say that a lot but i can't say it enough you know i'm just a man but god's word is the truth and you know if we can't take what we're doing and put it bring it through the word of god and come out on the other side still doing it then there's something wrong with it and it then says here for it is a shame even to speak those things which are done and of them in secret when i think of it i'm not trying to be funny but with everything that you possess nowadays it's not done in secret anymore it's just out there in the open the sin that's out there in the open right now whether it's on the airwaves or on your phone or whatever it's just unbelievable things that we would that we know today still are wrong and people shouldn't be doing these things are a common thing among the people we live within the day that we live right now and to say something about it you're the mean person or you're the reactionary nowadays that's how bad it's got to say the proper thing the loving thing and the thing that's right would make you an enemy of most people and he goes on to say for it is a shame even to speak those things which have done of them in secret but all things that are reproved or made manifest by the light and whatsoever doeth make manifest that goes back to that song you know that light that god god gives us you know no one's getting out of here without that light being in your heart and life wherefore he saith awake thou this sleepless and that really speaks to the age that we're living people have just fallen asleep in their sins in their own belief or in their complacency and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee lies seeing now that we walk circumcised me not as fools but as the wise redeeming the time because they are the these are the because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding on the will of the lord is and i i mean i'm i'm not going to read keep reading i don't want but as i was thinking this i was reading that the one of the devotionals one of the other devotionals i had and it goes world war two one and it was talking about examples and it was talking about this man that his mother was a great example this guy wrote this paragraph about this one soldier whose mother was a great example that when he left to go to war the things that the other men were doing he couldn't do because of his the honor of his mother he wasn't able to do it and i was just thinking you know that's the same for us those examples that you had as young men or as young women you know that there's more than that that'll hold you but the examples if you walk over all the barriers that god has been put in front of you in your life you're going to find out on the other side of that wall it might not be the place that you want to be and i was just thinking we have examples in the day that we live in right now you have the message of the hour you i mean you have it on you have a video you have it on tape you have any way you want it you can have it this morning and we find ourselves getting further away from the truth i can't i'm just speaking in generalities i'm not looking at you as individuals but you find the world just getting further and further and further away from the true gospel and it just lets you know the lateness that we're living this morning but there is a hope i always say if you're in christ this morning then none of these things will ever affect you on that day brother david amen if we could man it's good to see each and everyone out and we have i would say several gone but we got a lot gone this morning so amen but god bless you it's good to have you that are here this morning and and man just looking forward to what god has for us by the way of his word this morning and hey man i just i mean he's happy to be a christian this morning amen let's sing that little course he has made me glad this morning amen well i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter this

the truman and sister carol are up in their 70s and they go to brother nathan bryant's church outside of there in indiana there was five people about four years ago that was diagnosed with cancer in their church and by god's grace every one of them testified of god's healing and uh this has been about two years since sister carol's been clean and she went back to the doctor and the the doctor told him that it was trying to come back and he called me the other day and he said we're just believing the lord it's going to work a miracle once again and she starts radiation tomorrow morning so they desire your prayers and that god will just give him strength he's got to go for five days a week for five weeks so just pray for them this morning and i just you know these old bodies they get tired and things happen but amen one of these days we're going to a land where we'll never grow old and we won't be sick anymore and amen and i i don't know about you but i have a longing in my heart

thankful that we have a hope this morning amen i'm so glad for that hope this point so if you have need on your heart you might let me know my uplifted hand we're gonna ask for the brad if he'd pray

believe it'll be worth it all and i was thinking about that when you see your brother down in the valley you know brother tommy you sent me that video about why does the devil fight you so much when you pray i was praying in the morning everything in the world from buying a car to stuff that didn't matter and i i began to laugh i said yo devil we ain't much but your prophet said when the weakest of us gets down to pray you're scared and you're scared this morning because i'm praying for god's people and we believe that all is well and you know i got thinking about that i thought why should i worry it's in his hands as long as i keep praying and pressing on what the prophet tell us read your bible pray every day pretty simple what's the hardest two things you ever do in your life for me it's praying and reading my bible i could i could watch a western that was 20 hours long and never get sleepy but i guarantee you if i go to listen to the word of god or read five pages my eyes they want to close because he's not happy with something that'll give us strength and encourage us and give us power to keep pressing on i mean if your baseball team wins fine but tomato tomorrow they're going to lose but if that word of god anchors in your heart it don't matter what comes or goes hell or high water you're standing upon the rock of god's word this morning amen i don't know about you but i'm glad i'm one of them this morning amen let's stand this morning and ask for the thomas to come this morning and just pray that god will anoint him and touch him this morning and give him what we have need of and and brother thomas don't know but you know the our heavenly father knows this morning amen let's sing that song as he comes i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them this morning are you glad you're one of them this morning amen well i'm one of the i'm one of them [Music] oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them i'm one of them oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them although these people may not learn to be lord boast of worldly fame they have all received their pentecost baptized in jesus name and our telling now both far and wide is powering [Music] buddy [Music] so glad that i can say i'm one of them amen let's give the lord a hand say thank you lord jesus hallelujah bless your name lord thank you jesus amen i am glad that i can say i'm one of them thank you musicians appreciate it good morning good to be announced the lord amen brother danny wasn't feeling well different things i guess came upon him and so amen and ear infection and sore throat

we pray that god will raise him up quickly amen i think there are several quite a few different ones in men sickness seems to be going around right now some reason and so the lord will keep pressing the battle of all me amen so amen i can't think of any other special announcements do you want to have that meeting after service amen with the board um praise the lord let's just powerheads and heavenly father we come before you lord thank the lord to be able to assemble ourselves together one more time lord on this side of eternity the lord to open your word father and i have you speak to our hearts along the way and that we might go from here lord being able to say did not our hearts burn within us as we he spoke to us along the way we ask god that you just bless the meditation of our heart lord jesus and the thoughts of our heart father we ask god you'll bless that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak this morning speak to your people lord and we just ask god that you'd have your way into service be with each one of those that's not this morning we ask god that you raise them up quickly lord in jesus name amen and thank the lord for those that are feeling better amen praise the lord amen god bless you this morning amen if you will turn your bibles this morning we'll go to the book of romans romans romans 8 verse 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called and he also justified and whom he justified demi also glorified me god had his blessings to reading the word you can be seated this morning amen i thought about this and i want to speak on uh speak on the gospel according to paul amen i know that it said in each one of the mark luke john matthew mark look in john those gospels all said the gospel according to uh you know those brothers there but i don't know that the bible ever said anything about the gospel according to paul but we know that paul did have a version of the gospel didn't he amen i believe in galatians he says a dispensation of the gospel was it was administered to him to bring to the gentiles amen and so forth amen another place i believe he talked and said about the gospel and in the ministering of the word you know he said but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and as we said before so i say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you other than that which we have received let him be a curse so we know that paul got the gospel and whatever paul taught is what we believe amen we remember and think about uh uh brother bam going beyond the curtain of time and and how that the angel said that he'd have to be judged you know uh for what he taught for what he preached and so he asked if paul would have to be to do the same amen and the angel said yes and brother branham kind of shouted he was kind of like happy he says well then praise be to god you know if his goes in he says mine will too because i thought just what he did amen so praise the lord this morning amen aren't you glad to have a gospel today man i want to talk about in the basically of my my my i titled it more than conquers but i want to talk about staying positive staying positive amen amen more than conquers but staying positive we're living the world brothers and sister that everything about the world the outside world the world that we see everything about it is negative not one negative thing i mean not one positive thing about it i mean i say that based on what the prophet said the bible talks about heaven and earth shall pass away with a great noise and so forth so and the prophet saying i think wednesday i read it where he says there's not even a hope amen to make it in this world amen i mean knows that even as in these bodies naturally speaking you are not promised survival you are not going to survive this amen now i understand i'm talking about carnally amen we know there's only one escape that's through the rapture in that right only one way that you're not going to die and that is through the rapture if the rapture takes place if god has for ordained you to be in that rapture you're going to escape death but that's the only ones other than that amen we're so to speak we're going to die i mean everybody's going to die amen and so you look you look at first of all you look uh on a national scale you know talking about the nations and so forth uh actually talk about the whole world we know that the whole world amen is also going to die amen it's going to pass the way the bible says amen heavens and earth are going to die you know and and and brother branham taught us that that passed away where amen comes you know from the word of dying and death so forth it's passing from one form to another we passed away while he passed away she passed away while the world is promised that it's going to pass away amen so there's no hope there there's nothing positive about it at all amen and then we find there's other things that's many many things and uh that's not positive we know that this flesh this flesh that we live in the brotherhood said this is the the what the negative is that right your body is the negative of you the real use inside but this is just a negative and he said it has to go through the dark room to get developed so to speak amen has to get developed in the door of death he may go by the way the grave and so forth it has a good developments that way amen and then we come forth as a new man amen the world the same way it has to die it has to get developed and we're looking forward to that development aren't we amen amen but the process in which you are going through and and of course it's never pleasant never any good things so to speak amen because we know that the whole world is dying amen the whole world is dying amen you and i are dying and death is never a pleasant thing amen and so uh but you know i'm so glad tonight this this morning that there is hope amen and i appreciate it sunday school class brother brian gave about you know about room removing them landmarks and so forth and how that and now people previously maybe talk touching on what and they're talking about removing the landmarks and removing those places they want to take abraham lincoln sat you down in that right destroying the statues and saying bad things about him and so forth it destroys the very fabric amen and seeing people fall event he makes a statement something about seeing people fall amen amen tears at the very core of fabric and i thought that's the way it is with us as parents when uh parents preachers churches or anybody when somebody falls i mean it tears at the fact it shall shake your foundation you're like wow if they could fall then what really is solid amen amen so the atmosphere that we're living in is a negative atmosphere amen it's a negative atmosphere amen we know that money and all of those things will pass away one of these days and the atmosphere is that of that which is to perish but you know the bible says that when we gather together and so forth we gather in heavenly places in christ jesus when you come to church it's the one place that's positive the one place that's not negative amen the only hope that we have is in christ jesus there's not a hope for anybody or anything outside of jesus christ in his return no amen so we know that when you say no hope that's a lot of negative amen that's totally negative think there's no hope but it's positive because you have that word in there except i like that word except except for jesus christ there is hope very negative because i believe that most of the people out there almost all of the people out there most of the people out there they do not have comfort they're in misery that right they're in there they're they're stressed people are stressed are living under stress and living in that way is not positive it's not good at all amen so we want to talk about being positive and i'm thankful that god has made for us to be able to be positive amen let me first of first start with this well let's talk about uh people who has gone before us amen people that's gone before us i mean it reminded me about the brian sunday school class of how that it was told to take stones along so the next generation could look at that it's kind of like footprints on the sands of time look this is what god did gives you faith isn't that right this is what's solid this is what's sure is this is your absolute you know amen and they went on and i want to say that there's many uh uh you know many people many of men that have suffered and went through very hard times so that you could have a good time so that you can have it better isn't that right amen better bannon says it this way he says you know and many of you old timers here tonight was back yonder preaching you old baptist and methodists and pentecostal nazarene you were back yonder preaching when i was a little boy i respect you my brother you've made the way you hewed out the stumps and things all right so that when things come along they could run clear i respect you and so does god if there's any credit to be given at that day i want to stand to see you get it god bless then again he says help us lord now remember help us lord as we're working the row cutting down the briars moving back the rocks amen pulling out the stumps the front line give us courage lord big strong hearts buckle up the armor give us great strength and the power of thy spirit amen so he talked about different ones the preachers that's going on before when i want to look at paul i want to look at paul and some of his life and his attitude and and the way that paul looked at things amen but first of all talking about just different ones that went on and and cut all these things down we know that even the prophet of god had great adversity right he had great adversity people would women and say they don't believe things and so forth and he says well right here's the evidence that proves otherwise they couldn't say anything about it and we know brother branham greatly preached on the the goliath and so forth the goliath that was called the days of miracles his past you know and and so so forth oddity ain't no telling what they would have gotten away with teaching if it wouldn't have been for god sending uh they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and all the miracles that did happen they could then probably instill that in all the world but yeah the days of miracles his path yeah there's no such a thing as the holy ghost but he went through great suffering how many was the prophet suffered a lot he suffered a lot he says you'll never know you you'll never know the scours that's on this heart he's got cut deep he said many times he went through some hard places so that you could have confidence where you stand amen and amen and i appreciate that about people that's done that paul did that i mean know that paul suffered greatly he suffered amen and cutting these buyers back and removing these stumps and he had to straighten out all circumcision they had a minute to spring things and made the road clear paul made the road clear didn't he so that you could understand hey this is the right road and anybody that tries to show you any other path remember that it's the wrong path this is the right path boy what would you do if you went by what our our liberals and the people are saying nowadays if you believe what they would say you wouldn't know for sure if you're a man or a woman even why don't they come up with next they got they got you know can you imagine that i don't want to bring this up again can you imagine your children saying what what bathroom is that but what does that mean mom you know confusion if what's next you know and all of that but man aren't you glad you don't have to listen to that you'd be in a heap of trouble but here we have something that's so solid for sure amen so solid and so sure and men that have gone on to make a way and now how many knows that chief one of all amen that has made the way was jesus christ he's the chief one sure others did sure moses god used moses back in the old testament amen to take the big stump of pharaoh out of the way so that the people of god could be free when they went rejoicing out of egypt and so forth that was because moses had to endure a lot of things god took him on the backside of the desert and let him sit there for 40 years to get his mind right then called him to go down there and he went out there and he stumped he cleared all of that out he meant so that they could have joy jesus the same way think about what he did he didn't just do one but he conquered every enemy every devil he conquered didn't he he made it clear all the way i believe paul said we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen amen one place he says you know talking about he says oh death where is i sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but be the god which gives us the victory through jesus christ our lord i mean you didn't have to go you didn't have to go to the cross you didn't have to get nailed to the cross because that's what we deserve to die he went and took your punishment for you he took that stump of guilt he took the gut the sump of your sin away he removed that [Music] and all you have to do is accept it you have to believe it just believe it why because he went and he cleared the path think about all the different things and now no matter what you face in life it doesn't matter what it is it's already been conquered it's already been whooped all you have to accept is the victory lord just give me the victory that's all i need is the victory you already purchased it for me and that comes by surrendering to god and believing god's word that's how you get the victory is by believing god's word amen god oh thank you jesus for all the things let me say this just while i'm on it and thinking about it but you know there is still a lot of stumps for us to remove isn't there there is still a path for us to clear huh in these ages that we're living with all that they have claimed all that they have done for us in the past that they have made for us but this still we faiths face laodicea we face lukewarmness we face the media we face all those things that the devil is throwing at us and now it's up to us it's not up to us amen to clear the path and to show those that are coming behind us look this is how you do this is how you overcome this let me tell you this if parents are overcome by evil what stan what chance do your children stand the fabric of that family is completely torn apart whenever the parents don't stand when they don't show the way huh when they don't clear out the stuff and say this is the path we take and it may be rough it may be hard the things that you go through the trials that you endure the things that you go through and you come out the other side in victorious it's important that you come out victorious so those following and looking at you can come out victorious amen we've got stumps to clear we've got giants to bring down we've got goliaths to kill amen the goliath of lukewarmness the goliath of a halfway christian life amen a lot of things that we have to do amen one more quote let's not notice lord now we lord god here's christian people here's people who have literally would literally lay down their life freely tonight for you they love you they've come through great toils troubles and tribulations amen praise be to god you know the great thing about heaven is there's not going to be any troubles there's not going to be any trials there's not going to be any tribulations there's not going to be anything negative everything's going to be positive all right and they've tried through years they've contended for the faith that was once delivered to the saint they believed that they lived to see that day coming many of their fathers and mothers have fallen asleep waiting for this day but father they've blazed the road they've taken the stumps they've pulled back the briars now their children are running happily down the highway enjoying these blessings amen how many is enjoying the blessings oh my how we could just take our projector and just go all down through all the blessings that they brought to us amen you know luther he didn't have a whole lot he didn't have a whole lot but the catholic church was trying to make them pay for every blessing they get from god it was a time that they were trying to pay for it and you had to do this and you had to do that or you weren't going to make it to heaven and luther caught the revelation the just shall live by faith in other words you are just if you live by faith in the word of god that's all he has asked for you can't ask that of me you can't tell me i have to pay for this not in the other it's already been paid for and the judge shall oh they didn't like it huh but he began to open up the way up and up the way and that's what he had and then the next comes wesley come along and he says you know you can't just be justified by but you've got to have you got to lay that cigarette down you got to get clean you got to have sanctification you got to be right and clean without holiness no man shall see god amen and another move come on out isn't that right and then pentecost come on pave the way boy they really got happy after a while didn't they amen sanctification justification sure we have both of those but now they have the gifts of the holy spirit speaking in tongues and the baptism the spirit coming back upon them isn't that right my they had a good time but they had to fight their way didn't they all those souls just had to fight their way they had to be persecuted they had to be mocked they had to be called the offscouring holy rollers fanatics fools amen i was looking somewhere about billy graham and he reached a message i believe he says be a fool for christ he even got the revelation amen but you know the thing of it is you're just a fool to those who think you're foolish but you're actually a wise guy you're the wisest there is you're actually amen but just to them because they're on opposite sides they think you're a fool but that's okay amen we think about it pentecost come along it paved the way speaking in tongues now i want you to ask you the main theme that they have of course is stress very much and we do too acts 2 the baptism of the holy ghost the pentecostal experience of the baptism of the holy ghost you know that you gotta have and then they kind of went on you know that was wonderful that was correct but the devil tried to push him over aboard a little bit and they had speaking in tongues if you don't speak in tongues you ain't got it and if you speak in tongues that means you got it that's their that's where they got a little bit the devil just pushed them off a little bit i don't know about you but i'm glad that i have a whole lot more than just to think that because i speak in tongues i've got no legal i got a whole lot more realize the bible jesus said that by their fruit you shall know them the way that you live and your passion and your desire that's how you know whether you got it or not by their fruits you're going to know them amen come along and amen to think about all that was opened up to us on this road of of how that he went back before the foundation of the world and how that god had you in his mind he knew your name and he actually wrote your name down amen what redemption man we didn't really know what redemption man it's mean to bring back which what was long if he was never lost you can't never be brought back only those who were lost he brings back praise the lord we found the uh found what it would really like to be justified we found that justified means that you've never done it in the first place you were trapped in it i heard brother brown saying it was kind of a real kind of tricky but he says god will never condemn you for being a sinner he will never dab for being a sinner he was born that way you can't help it he was born that way but he says what he'll condemn you for is not taking the way out huh for not accepting the way out we're not accepting forgiveness for sins huh that's the condemnation amen people love darkness than life amen praise the lord my they've contented for the faith many have fallen asleep waiting for what waiting for the coming of the lord that's our hope isn't it praise the lord now let's think about this let's talk about in the world that we're living in and let me just say this before we read this also and as we get older as you get older amen it's much easier to become negative and let me say this also you have a whole lot more to be negative about huh oh my knee hurts arm hurts i'm not as strong i'm feeble i'm weak huh all kinds of things that you have to be negative about amen because as i was thinking back in the offices after all dying isn't fun dying isn't easy it's a slow long process and it starts with your hair turning great it starts with turning 40. you're over the hill yep over the hill praise be to god i wish i was 40. but it starts going downhill he goes worse worse worse more and more things to be negative about amen negative think about the things around us the economy look at the economy how depressing it is how perplexing how distressing it is to have to live in this world amen of negativity but you know that's why i believe probably god said lord help me never let the devil crown my life at being a crabby old fussy old man because somebody knows when you are negative you become fuzzy fuss about this fuss about that you murmur about this remember about that easy to become this way amen and you need more of god and old people will usually be real sweet or real grumpy one way or the other because they'll have learned not to complain about it thank the lord anyway amen all right let me read the course quote that come to my mind brother makes a statement he says you know it's a strange thing that there's so much thought of the people people will think well i'm weak and my faith isn't very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say huh oh my knee hurts and it's not getting any better don't say that oh my back hurts and i don't think it's gonna no don't say that stay positive huh that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you mustn't never say that he says don't never let your testimony be negative praise the lord [Music] why do you think that looking at the news too much is depressing and it'll depress you because it's negative huh it's negative all right you must never say that let your neck never be let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time praise be to god oh i may not be what i want to be but i know god's going to get me there that kind of language i only believe that's the way we got to be i mean it was paul was that way wasn't he paul he always he he would mention the negative he would talk about the negative but he'd always have the positive side there's nobody suffered more than paul did outside of christ amen now notice he says let your testimony always in your thoughts every time he says always never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it he talked about the birds it fly over it i mean no every one of us gets us those negative thoughts and we all know that nobody wants to be around a negative person there's too much negative but there's too much positive for the christian to live on to have to be negative amen always i like that always be positive because guess what even when we're at death's door even when we're dying we should be positive huh when i come to beth's door which i hope i won't i'm trusting in the rapture but if it is i want to be able to say boy oh boy guess what in just a little bit when i draw that last breath it's adios amigo i'm going to a place in a beautiful land not ever looking back amen oh my it's so there's things to be positive about as you get weaker as you get older as you get feebler stay positive because if you don't you're gonna find yourself fussing at your wife wife fussing at your husband murmuring and complaining that's what negativity is all about that's pretty good right we fuss at one another we fuss and we bicker and everything else when you get negative amen another place brother bam says he's just the holy spirit is never negative he's always positive i think i have a quote on one more quote on that a man that is in christ with the holy ghost can bear with a man when he's wrong he's long suffering he's gentle he's patient he's sweet he's humble should i stop for just a minute i go so fast he can bear with a man when he's wrong he's long suffering he's he's sweet he's humble he's faithful filled with the spirit never negative huh brother i tell you what i just don't know what i'm going to do anymore and i'm so discouraged well if you wouldn't be doing this that any other maybe you wouldn't be that way is that positive no brother you're gonna make it through this i'm praying for you i believe it you can do it huh i'm with you i got your back positive the holy ghost-filled person is always positive never negative he says always positive why because he's a different person let's look at paul you want to look at paul with me in second corinthians the fourth chapter and verse six he says for god who hath commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ now he said that kind of a different subject but he's talking about the god of this world has blinded the minds of those that don't accept the gospel amen and no light can come here it's nothing but negative in there when light comes into your heart amen joy comes in your heart but we have verse seven but we have this earthen this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us praise be to god hallelujah how many in here and out there has learned that it's not about you living your life it's not about you taking care of the problem it's about god living in your life it's about god taking care of the problem that's the treasure the treasure is amen that the power is of god not of you will never be positive outside of the holy ghost you'll be negative in one way or the other now paul says one side on one side he says the very next word he says we are troubled on every side we got some trouble everywhere now what paul's saying we got trouble everywhere paul knew what it was like to have trouble all around him yet i like that i like his yet not distressed [Music] praise be to god we are perplexed amen how many know when you look at this world you see all of this it perplexes you it distresses you i'm distressed with it but we're not in despair hey we still got the joy of the lord because even though these things bother us you still got the hope you still got you don't despair we are persecuted praise be to god people might make fun of you despise you whatever but we're not forsaken no god didn't forsake us does he we are cast down made fun of the elf sky powering the earth but we're not destroyed you might get cast down but you're not destroyed amen the thought comes to my mind where jesus said they might destroy your body but don't fear them that can destroy your body fear him that can destroy both your body and your soul in hell amen because when they kill you there's nothing else they can do you're in the presence of almighty god yet not this destroyed always bearing out in the body of jesus might be made manifest in our body so god allows our trials he allows tribulation he allows persecutions he allows your name to be cast out as evil inaudible all so that the life of christ can be displayed he'll allow somebody to smack you on the right cheek by saying something bad about you and you can go back and say lord help me to say something good about that person huh for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake wow that the life of that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal body amen another place paul talked about how to death you know they always had it nice and so forth and we were like the off-screen and so forth he was the four on it so the rest could have it a lot nicer so death workers than us but life in you we have the same spirit we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believe therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up jesus christ shall raise us up also by jesus christ and shall present us with you for all are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many abound to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day all of us older folks can say amen to that the outward man perish hit the inman it's renewed day by day you get strength to go on keep pressing on amen for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory for we look not at the things which are seen but that the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal praise the lord how many is looking to the unseen i'm looking to the unseen that is for sure back to romans 8 this was my chapter that came to me when i got to thinking on this and meditating on the lord let's go back to romans 8 and i want to read the rest of it the rest of that chapter i stopped i believe in verse 30. moreover who he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now remember paul talking here many different places and especially what we just read where he talked about being cast down and so forth but not forsaken and talking about the tribulation the different things that he goes through and another place he said i have suffered the loss of all things amen sure that was negative that he saw some positive thing and in all of it if everything that paul would tell you he says in verse 28 again that everything works together for good to them to love god i mean if paul continued always to have a positive attitude and look he says if he predestinated us and so forth then he also called us if he called us then he also justified us and if he justified us then he also has glorified us it took a profit of god to be able to uh to make that a present thing he noticed half already done it right he hath also just then he also justified glorified and that was saying that we already have a glorified body waiting for us how many beliefs be believers have a glorified body waiting on already right now if this earthly tabernacle of this house be dissolved we have one already waiting paul said amen paul was so positive he says oh death where is your sting oh great varies where's your victory you don't have any victory amen now what shall we say to thee things if god be for us who can be against us faith to god aren't you glad for that that no matter what if god is with you you don't have to be scared of anything who can be against you why are you worried about anybody or anything let me tell you something this helps when it comes to having fear if you have fear a lot of times fear will come upon us fear this no if god's with you you're taken care of god's going to take care of it he spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things and who shall slay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies amen who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again and is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercessions for us how many believe that christ is there making intercessions for you now like this who shall separate us from the love of christ in other words what's going to make you negative what's going to make you turn you back on god what shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation huh shall lay odyssea or distress nope persecution a whole lot of negative going on there folks because there's all of these things comes to the believer all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution the bible says amen and all that comes to god shall be tried god will try out god will put you through things he'll allow tribulation to come upon you he'll allow distress didn't he paul paul was boy he was really um those of you who know the message well know that brother branham taught that most of the time the people that god uses the most go through the most suffering amen paul was such a man because he says i'll show you the things that you must suffer that's what he that's what jesus told him at the beginning i'm gonna show you some stuff that you're gonna you're gonna suffer bro you're gonna suffer amen oh my paul he could say distress shall persecution shall famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all day long wow that sounds pretty bad to be killed all day long how many knows that that literally was true those those christians down through the dark ages 68 they would slaughter them all day long they'd slaughter them day after day week after week month after they were counted as sheep to the slaughter sounds real bad don't it but yet in it all paul says we're more than conquerors we thank god for the victory that comes through the lord jesus christ folks i don't know i'm going to die i would rather die for the lord anyway wouldn't you amen it's okay brother branham he says you know he's willing to take a bull of any time for the lord he said they had guns trained at him did he fear did he get negative did he get scared no let me tell you something when you touch the lord so when you're dealing with god's people you know you'll get your reward you'll get your reward whichever way you go with it all right okay so persecution famine how many knows paul knew what it was like to be hungry huh or distress perilous pearl or sword peril or sword killed all the lay long we're kind of the sheep for the slaughter [Laughter] now and a y i'm going to pronounce it that way nay or nah nah [Applause] he says in all these things we are say it with me more than conquers we are conquerors through him that loved us praise be to god let's thank the lord thank you jesus no matter what comes better what goes lord help us we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen praise the lord because i am paul says for i am persuaded convinced i'm sure of that not death not life let me just stop there a little bit killing them isn't going to work letting them live isn't going to work because sometimes letting them live is more dangerous than killing them because you know even at the cares of life sometimes choke out the word so if you just go along people just go along living and living and living and living and they kind of drift away from god because it carries her life but even life isn't going to keep you away from him amen nor angels nor principalities principles amen and that's let me tell you some principles is like the you know what's going on right now they're making other principles and what we're uh the principles that this nation was founded upon they're changing the principles but it ain't going to separate us from the love of god is it nor powers nor are things present nor things to come boy brother paul was really inspired wasn't he he had the inspiration he covered it all life death sickness health press things present or things to come oh my praise the lord i want to claim that promise this morning the things that are to come yet huh we don't know what's going to come we don't know the future we don't know what how much of a squeeze we're going to be squeezed do we but paul thinks the things that are to come even that isn't going to separate us from the love of god praise god for faithful people praise god for rock steady people that are anchored in christ let me tell you something i believe there's only one kind that's really anchored that's the predestinated everything else these floods that are coming in is just washing people away amen that predeterminated seed in there is what's doing it for you amen praise the lord nor things to come not height night not depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus thank you lord amen it is you don't matter how hard no matter how negative the world gets we're always going to be positive we're going to take the word of god and believe it amen with all of our heart you love him this morning amen lord help me lord help you no matter what comes no matter what goes the anchor holds the anchor holds amen it did for paul one more final scripture i want to read in philippians 4 verse 6. let's go to verse 4 i like verse 4 rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice let your moderation or self-control be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding it will keep your hearts and minds amen how many believes that the peace of god is to keep you hard and your mind how many beliefs those three places are very important your heart is very important your mind is very important amen heart mind i guess it's two places through jesus christ finally brethren whatsoever things are true not the lies they're telling huh whatsoever things are true i mean no there's only one true that's the bible so keep your mind on the bible okay whatsoever things are honest that's honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report amen praise the lord don't listen to the news you're not going to get a good report listen to the bible that's a good report let me know this is the good report right here everything good jesus made the way for us when he went to calvary amen if there be any virtue or strength if there be any praise think on the things paul knew where to keep his mind he knew to keep it on the word of god always think positive don't never let a negative thought go through your mind now notice also as i wanted to take paul for an example notice what he says about himself those things which she have both learned and received and heard well i could say it backwards those things which you have heard that you've received and you've learned and seen in me too amen hallelujah hallelujah how many want to be that kind of an example let me show you how this is done let me show you how this is done amen and seeing in me do and the god of peace shall be with you but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me has flourished again wherein you were all so careful but he lacked opportunity not that i speak in respect of one for i have learned what did paul learn well he says whatever you've learned in me do right so this is what he learned for i have learned in whatsoever state i am i'm happy i'm happy i'm gonna be that way this morning whether you have or whether you have or not or whether things are going good or whether things are going bad stay positive be content there with for i know both how to be a based and i know how to abound everywhere in all things i am instructed to be full both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need as long as you're in this world how many knows you're not going to get away from the negative you're not going to get away from bad things happening you're not going to get away from getting sick you're not going to get away from all these things but thank god that you have got a god that helps you through them both to be hungry how to abound and to suffer need wow paul says i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me god bless you this morning stand with me thank you lord jesus how many that is so glad for what jesus has provided for you i'm so glad for what he made available to us that no matter where we are here we are at the very end of the world and the world is absolutely going downhill very fast but yet we're going uphill very fast we're getting closer to christ we're thinking on things that are right honest pure and good how many this morning would you say lord help me to get away from some of the negative attitudes that i have sometimes my negativity and my complaining my murmuring and so forth let me get away from that and realize lord no matter what state i am or where i am and no matter you know what it is to be thankful and to keep him in your heart not to get a negative attitude because this is the world that we're living in now it's so easy to get negative it's so easy to complain and begin to fuss or murmur and because of all the negative that's around us lord jesus you see the hands you see each and every one of our hands saw a god that went up they said lord jesus keep me away from negativity lord don't let me think on the bad things and cast down or sickness or feeble lord but to say god you're my healer you're the one that gives me strength thank you lord for seeing me through it lord lord even when this world is over you've already father you've got a place prepared for me i don't have to fear death like paul didn't because guess what you've got a home for me over there and that is what we're looking forward to not to the things of this world but that which is to come lord jesus we're not looking to the things that are visible but to the invisible things for we know all that we see around us is temporal lord but it's the things that we can't see that's eternal the joy the salvation the holy spirit in our hearts lord is not something you can see with your eye but we know it's real father we ask god that you'll help this church and those on the radio waves tonight this morning lord that they'll be less negative lord jesus more dedicated to you and every every problem every situation every stage they find themselves lord that they'll be like paul that he has both learned not to complain but to
