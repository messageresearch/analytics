so that's good amen praise the lord brother brad everybody just good to see everybody again going to be back in the house of the lord amen notice it's a little dark back there but that's okay and then it's weird how you notice if there's certain lights hanging on or something you know amen but that's all right god's good isn't he amen all right uh we want to do one thing and that is uh give the lord some praise tonight amen i know how many knows that we had a couple tornadoes going down through here the other day one went right across the highway right over here amen went down across behind the veterinarian clinic and amen went right past joshua and elia amen and so that was real it had to be real close to me and i think they it was close enough to make them jump into the tub so you know it had to be closed so let's thank the lord for watching over amen that's just a great god amen thank you jesus amen and for watching over all of us amen so amen we take things like that for granted sometimes you know don't realize that that could come right over top of this good time i'm gonna do a lot of damage and whatever you know and so it's just god that keeps his hand over us we're very thankful for that amen let's bow our heads and we'll just get into the service tonight lord jesus now we come solemnly before you lord thank the lord jesus to have a great god like you to serve lord jesus our hearts are overjoyed flooded with peace and joy and father thankfulness father for all that you are what you mean to us on a daily basis lord in this world when everybody and seems like everything's getting wickeder all the time we're trying to go the other way lord we're trying to get closer to you lord and become better christians and better people to serve you lord and father we come before you this evening lord presenting ourselves before you to stand before the word and just see what the reflection is how we're looking lord and we ask god that you just show us what we're looking like and what we really are father we just ask god did you best the meditation of my heart and that which i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to speak we ask your guidance and your leadership tonight into speaking and also with the hearers lord we ask oh god that you would open up that second set of ears lord that they might be able to hear for we know that some heavy ears but they hear not lord help us to have ears that can hear lord but the spirit saith to your people blessed your word now for we ask in jesus name amen and amen amen turn your bibles and we want to continue our series amen again this will be a thought coming off our series and uh it's going to be on uh his title or his word another one of his names all right another something that he's called i think i'll read one scripture because i want to let's just go read the whole thing while we're at it over in revelations we'll go to it first let's go to revelations and see what the name is that we want to deal with tonight the title is that we want to deal with with the help of the lord and now we understand that in the 19th chapter of revelations is when the bride comes back to earth again with christ how many believes that that's right she goes up in the third chapter comes back in the 19th chapter according to the prophet of god and so uh you know it and i want to skip on a lot of that you know about that but it talks about a great multitude of people saying hallelujah and so forth but i want to go and jump over to verse 11 and if you want to understand this 19th chapter of revelations a little better and the battle that partakes that we're going to be a part of after the marriage supper you'll have to look under i believe it's the fifth seal i'm thinking it's the fifth or sixth it might be the sixth seal anyway i'd have to go back to say for sure but it's one of those ladder seals brother branham explains the 19th chapter and how it is how do we come back with christ to fight that battle of armageddon with him and so just imagine this now as we read this uh you'll find several names several titles that god has here but we want to focus on one of them tonight and that's verse 11 of chapter 19 of revelations and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was faithful and true was called faithful and true so there's one title already and in righteousness does he judge and make war well i'd like to stop there a little bit but i don't get people too much but can you imagine there's going to be some problems my friend when god declare war god is going to declare war when he declares war folks you ain't seen nothing amen it it's going to be quite a sight and i'm going to tell you right now i'm going to be one of his soldiers don't you i want to be on his side because this is where the prophet of god talked about they'll the ones that fought the word of god will one day find the word fighting them amen all right his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns amen amen so he has he's a champion right of many things right so he's got the crowns of many things many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was closed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called say it with me the word of god amen so you can imagine coming from the heavens of heavens with all of the armies of heaven and on his vesting on his thighs name called the word of god that's what we want to speak on tonight with the help of the lord and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon horses clothed in fine linen white and clean i wanted to stop there and ask you a question tonight how did they get their clothes white and clean okay we read it just a couple scriptures back what was he dipped in blood that's right we were made white blood by the blood of the lamb amen that's why his bestie was dipped in blood because it represented that that is what he cleaned the saints with every how many knows that's where it all hinges on amen without dense shedding of blood there is no remissions there have been no salvation outside of that shed blood amen everything's significant and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword how many knows you got a word you got to watch these a little bit because a lot of these are symbols like many crowns i don't see that it's going to have a stack of them huh maybe i don't know i'm not saying that it isn't but a lot of times it's symbolic he's a champion of much just like here he's this sharp sword coming out of his mouth it's not going to have a sharp sword sticking out there i don't believe because a little bit later it explains what it is that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty god you know the world just hasn't had a taste of that yet have they but when those volcanoes erupt when the earth shakes all the cities of the earth get shaken down they'll feel the wrath of god uh all the mambo jumbo the bragging the big talk it's all gonna shut up amen and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written maybe it's the other side of the horse i don't know but here's another name on his vegetarian thigh right it says king of kings and lord of lords amen and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying unto all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourself together unto the supper of the great god they may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men the flesh of horses and them that sit upon them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and i saw the beasts and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with him that sat on the horse and against his army and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with him he deceived with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and then which worshipped his mark these boats were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse whose sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen you love him tonight you know i want to just say a couple things maybe that come to my mind because most of us we've been church goers probably for i don't know all our life perhaps some of us and service after service after service one place brother bam says american people they've just been preached to death preached to death huh i thought about that you know preaching so much until you know they get tired of it perhaps or you know they get cold perhaps or just i thought of it as being preached a lot too you know and you think well you know and if you aren't careful you come to church and you think well he's just going to say a lot of words it's going to be a lot of lot sad a lot of things going to be sad again and just a lot of talk huh you know and i thought you know i hope we never get like that i hope it's never that for you i hope it's never that for me because it isn't just a bunch of talk isn't just a bunch of philosophy but the bible says that by the foolishness of preaching god you know has chosen to save those that are lost it's not just for empty words it's not just coming together for another service no it's coming to worship the lord in spirit and in truth i mean he believes that to come to give honor and glory and it's not something that we just hear externally or tantalize our brain intellectually but it's our soul giving glory back to god praising god and watching god work in our lives amen and transforming amen transforming if y'all have a pen remember this i'd like for everybody here and on uh out there on what am i going to call it i don't know what internet world or whatever facebook or whatever anybody that's listening to this i'd like at least our congregation for the most part i heard a tape that i really liked maybe it won't affect you like it did me but brother branham had a real good perspective on life i think it was after his mother died and so forth but it's a message either in 61 or 60 60 or 61 i don't know that there was more than one of these sermons preached but it's called the testimony of a true witness the testimony of a true witness amen it's a very very good tape and so if you can try to listen to that maybe before sunday amen but i don't want i just say lord help us that you know of all that we hear how many knows it's easy to allow things to become too common to us amen coming to church too coming to us wednesday night gets bored well yeah you know it's [Music] it's wanna go and your spirit says go how many know it it has to be down in our soul this needs to come from amen all right so now let's look at this now i want to speak about something that would really really take when i was looking up some quotes of brother ben and he was talking about if god just says one thing you could actually preach on that or speak that for that for millions of years just perhaps one thing that god would say so when we talk about the word of god we realize that in another place he says it just continues on and on and on in some words a lot of the word has a compound meaning and i kind of get the idea of what it means for that word for taking perhaps one thought one word you could just take you could take this word that's the word of god just that phrase and and and i begin to think you know how that and now i go to the scripture it says that there was not anything created that wasn't created by the word of god so you can start there and think about that everything that was ever made or ever will be made was made by god's word amen so much so until the one riding on that horse and so forth called the word of god all the way to talking about uh you know how that a a word we all understand that before a word before it's a word what is it it's a thong and i was back there in the study and i was thinking you know is there anybody in here that can speak faster than you can think and i thought the answer was no but it's actually yes what happens when you speak faster than you think no your foot ends up in your mouth [Applause] we all experienced that right we we smoked while we called before we thought we should have thought a little more before we said it now that foot end up in our mouth so that's the only way i know of that we could actually think faster than what we speak is sometimes we're so quick to but the bible says slow to speak be slow to speak swift to what to hear be slow to speak swift to here be careful what you say and half the time and now we got to watch it up here brother brad don't we sometimes we gotta you know sometimes we'll just say things perhaps and and say oh why did i say that i should have thought twice can i give you an example and i did this at another church and i ain't been back so i don't know if this is why but i talked about people that are still having eight track takes or kind of the horse and buggy age you know that's it's you know and i think before i said i said does anybody have eight tracks yet you know somebody raised their hand you know this but that's so you know nowadays you don't have to do that you can have it on your phone and just push the button there it is i thought later as is that could have offended him how why i have to i think you're sitting here on my bed why didn't you have to say that first year getting them to find out who they are and then you say they're in the horse and buggy age you know i'm like my my point was is with the technology and so forth you know you can have it right at your fingertips you can have it going down the road you can have it everywhere and that's good and how many believes that's good but you know when it comes to technology and this is going away and off the course but is that all right maybe somebody needs it but when it comes to technology i heard the prophet say sometimes all of this modern stuff is as good as for us is what we think huh sometimes it's not as good as what we think amen so anyway all right so yeah sometimes we can think generally speaking generally speaking generally speaking i cannot say it until i think it right first it goes through here every word you think everything you're going to say comes in here first and that's the way it is with god i mean that's how it was with god before he ever spoke the first word you know i was glad that i heard prophet god say it the other day because all the time all the times i've preached to you about god being infinite and how that you can't figure it out god be an omniscient you can't figure it out i even heard the prophecy man if you tried to figure that out you just can't of him being infinite knowing all things it's just too much for your mind i have another one for you to stretch your mind with are you ready how [Applause] can god think the perfect thoughts the first time because you know on me you know like me and you we we we're not we're not able to do that a lot of times we can't think of it perfect at the same time you know i i'm in construction and i've been doing certain things a certain way and my son if they'd want to do it a different way man that is wrong that will never work huh but yet they'll do it it works just fine and i'm like wow if i just realized you know not my first thoughts aren't always perfect they can always be gotten better things you can do things better but with god when he thinks it is absolutely he never has to negotiate he never have to figure it out so i don't know about you but i can't figure god thinking out it's just too perfect for me but he is perfect and they think he never thinks the wrong thought amen and we find out brothers and sisters how many knows we found out through malachi 4 that if you wasn't in that thinking before the first stardust was ever made if he was not in his thinking then you never will be why do i say that where is my authority to say that in revelations i believe it's uh 13 8 somewhere in there it says all wondered after the beast whose names were not written in the lamp book of life from the foundation of the world if you was chosen you was chosen before the world ever began churches will have an altar call and people will go to the altar amen oh my did y'all find it all right 13 80. i think i had it right and they'll say well there's well look at there he we got somebody giving the heart to the lord there's another name written in heaven tonight he says that ain't right no that name was written and he's just being redeemed tonight just the same as when christ your salvation amen how many knows you're already saved you know the map said you were saved from the foundation world you saved when he gave his blood on calvary he was saved 2 000 years ago it's already done it's just that you recognize it at a certain time in a certain hour he even said you're not per mourn on a certain day amen he was born again before the foundation of the world in god's mind i'm getting a little loud here is that okay are they cranking me up so you can hear me all right i can hear myself better now all right before the foundation of the world he thought of you and wrote your name down and that's where he chose you long before you chose him amen long before but he knew who you would be what you would be my y'all are making it easy for me to preach i haven't even started my subjects i got about four or five thoughts with the help of the lord all right let's start with creation verse shall we let's go to first john not first john john the first chapter john and then also hebrews the 4th not the 4th the 11th hebrews 11 after that we'll read the first couple of verses in the beginning was the word and the word was with god huh i don't know was it in his thoughts was the word still in his thoughts it was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen down in verse 14 it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so we see that when christ how many knows that in one place the scripture talks about it i'm thinking it was saint john the last one on the 16th or 17th chapter where he talks about that even his christ was crucified before the foundation of the world even though the works were done before the foundation of the world but here he was made manifest the word became flesh amen you know the more i got to thinking about this tonight the more i realized that sometimes we perhaps don't appreciate the word the way that we should i do know the prophet god said you know no true christian is any stronger than his adherence to the true world so when you see somebody that is not strongly adhered to the word of god remember they're going to be a weak christian not really important not really adhere the way that it's supposed to be but when you oh my because listen i want to say this this is the only truth there is in the world everything else is a lie even his word to let man's word be a lie and mind the truth this here we my how that we could just have a whole pages of what this word really is how did it so infallible it's so perfect now not one flaw in it it is so flawless until jesus when he talked about the infallibility of the word said the heavens are going to pass away the earth is going to pass away that's a lot that's cataclysmic the heavens and the earth are going to pass away but my word will never pass away again back on the unendingness of god the unendingness of of god's word and what he said and his testimonies as a preacher of 30 years i've learned and you've heard it how that you could take david shaddock meshach nabindigo one of our favorite characters daniel and and israel at the red sea and we have taken all kinds of different things that we've pulled out of there not just one we'll think well you know the trials were set to test them and try their faith you know but there was so many other things that we've pulled out of there if time goes on maybe we'll even pull more out of there because it's unending infallible now let me go to another part because as we talk about the infallibility of the word it's infallible not even the problem of god said and it's true that if one if god god a man is only as good as his word god is only as good as his word if he doesn't keep his word then he's not god if he lies he's not god amen and he keeps his word god keeps his word and let me ask you one more let me ask one more thing in class you should know what is the bible what is the word of god think about it what is this uh it's not really fair because i got in my mind and you don't have it yours it's god in letter form it's god in letter form that's right so i'm holding god in letter form praise god can you imagine the responsibility i want to get to the new birth in a minute but let me just say one more thing because there has to be some absolute there has to be something that the world is going to be judged by right the world has to be judged by something and as the prophet put it he says he can't be the baptist because there's so many different kinds of baptist huh methodist presbyterian can't be one church or the other all the others will be lost right so it has to be one place the bible says he's going to judge the world by jesus christ that's what the bible says and jesus christ is the word right is it okay to just have a little class on wednesday what else what else is the word of god what can you think of else that would be the word of god this just come to me and so i i know that you know a lot but and you'll know exactly what it is whenever i say it but it is god's pardon right the word of god is god's pardon to every person in the world everybody god pardoned everybody how did he do this when people come up to heaven and they come on the day of judgment and say well i didn't know oh wouldn't that sound like a good ignorance is a good excuse do you know the one quote the one scripture that jesus can test them with to find out whether they're really guilty or not what's the one scripture that jesus can repeat and say do you know this scripture if they know that scripture it'll have been their pardon this should be easier for you now very good john 3 16. all he has to do is say did you ever hear of the scripture john 3 16. oh you mean the one for god said love the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever should believe in him should not perish but i remember that's it see you didn't know that was your pardon i pardoned you um and it'll be exactly like that story the prophet told about the uh person in a civil war that was had the young guys and he left his post of duty he was so scared he ran left his post of duty amen and they were going to shoot him for it and his buddy went to abraham lincoln got a pardon got a piece of paper and he signed that and said i pardoned so and so he took it to the boy and the boy says no you're just fooling with me you're just kidding me and mocking me i don't know what i would do if i was in that situation maybe i'd be so riled up i wouldn't want to accept it either but i'd grasp for every straw i could you would think i'd at least try wouldn't you take them show that to the warden go show that to the warden all the boy would've had to do is go and show it to the warden right and after they read it huh after they read it and they kill him they're in trouble they better check it out make sure that this is legit right but the boy didn't believe him so get out of here you're mocking me and the boy left next they they shot that man dead they went to the courts we had a good supreme court back then huh they didn't okay homosexuality oh brother bali you shouldn't say that yes you should that is wrong in every form fashion but anyway went to the supreme court and they said what are we going to do what's your what's your outcome the outcome is a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon amen and when jesus christ says that to whoever if you've ever heard just and that's a popular scripture isn't it i'm glad god made it that popular so if you don't know any other scripture if you know just that scripture you'll be held accountable i didn't say for the jews only or for the gentiles or for the arabs or for the indian or whatever it might be i said whosoever will let him come amen i believe the prophet god said one place he says i glad that he put it didn't put it that way you know put your name in there like there's a lot of thomas pylers might have not been me oh my i miss it nobody said whosoever i am whosoever that's how one is one of them he opened it up to all amen and so this here is what's going to judge folks at the judgment day amen i can't get off of it but i just can't imagine what it's going to be like on that day can you when he looks at everyone says i died on calvary i gave my life so that you could go afraid why didn't you accept it why didn't you receive it even i'm loving god said that's going to be a major question god has for people why why why didn't he amen same way with cain why didn't he accept that when i came right up to your face and said do yours see your brother but he didn't want it something down here was wrong how many knows that's what the problem is something down here is wrong with people amen amen the importance of the new birth the importance of the new birth let's talk about that for a few minutes shall we let's go to st john three there was a name of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that our teach should come from from god for no man amen jesus answers and said unto him verily verily i say unto you except a man be born again he he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said on to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's room and be born jesus answers verily verily i say unto you except the man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god now notice this is what i want to get to here because i want to read over in first peter also that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit amen i believe that tonight if you haven't got the holy ghost i don't care how much you try to act like you're still just flesh amen so our birth has to be of what the word amen over in first peter 1 verse 22 seeing that you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unframed love of the brethren see that he loved one another with a pure heart fervently being borned again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible now he knows our first birth was corruptible carnal fleshly oh my when you look at glaciers about the lust of the flesh and the attributes of the flesh with all kinds of horrible terrible things now look at this even your birth it says being born again verse 23 not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god come on y'all hang on to your seats think about it what is it that can't pass away the word of god and if you are born by the word of god can you pass away did the prophet what the prophet god he says you can no more pass away than god can pass away because you have been born by the word of god your very birth is the word of god amen oh my four ever do you realize that if you joined the amish church they claimed to have the they claimed to be nyan village see dengue and highly hashed they think they're born again they think they got the holy ghost huh but what are they really let me just make a statement anybody that will take their church idea when it's contrary to the word uh is not born of the word they're born of their church they're born on amish a mennonite the presbyterian whatever it is you're not born by the word of god you are born by that church because you esteem that higher than the word of god this is what the prophet taught us this is what the bible teaches there is nothing higher than the word of god and jesus he said this this way that man not to live by man's tradition they he said do my man tradition have made the word of god of none effect to the people oh my but he said man shall not live by bread alone but by once in a while a word some of the word no jesus said you've got to live by every word of god no word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god shall men live by i'm sure we're all in a hearts mind saying lord that's my heart's desire i want to live by every one of your words every word that proceedeth out of the mouth god if you expect to go into rapture here or wherever you are out there you better be getting more and more like the word [Music] adhering more and more to the word of god because one of these days we're going to meet him face to face and in order to be united with him we have to be just like him that's quite something folks how many know jesus said you know any man that doesn't have the spirit of god is none of his if you are born again and if you have received the baptism of the holy ghost then the works that jesus did the attitude that jesus had the way that he talked the way that he walked the way did he conduct himself on an everyday basis is how you act how you talk how you walk come on folks think about it if you all be honest we all could use a little bit of down on me time for that so much so that the people see the love of god in you remember the quote she is him remember the quote where he says you know the bride is the word of god you are the word for the hour the god's word is alive and living in you and in me in this generation whenever they see you they should see christ how many's got room to grow if you don't let me come down and shake your hand real good and hug up on you because whatever you got i need more of that's right because we were born again to be trained to be conformed to the image of christ you know i really hate my faults i hate seeing my faults and yet i'm very very thankful for it are you with me you don't like your faults but if you can't see your faults you're not going to feel bad about your faults you're going to stay like you are but if you got enough of christ in you the holy ghost will show you your faults you'll hate your faults but you're glad that god chose you your fault because you know where you're at and you know what you need to do to get rid of the old man and let the new man live then your words will be fewer but they'll be saltier they'll have more weight they'll mean a lot more amen you love him that's right how many believes that god made it so that through the womb of our mind let me just stop there and give you another test what else is this what else is the word of god well i believe it's over matthew he says the word is like a seed right that is sower sowed the word is like a seed the word of god is a seed it has to be planted it has to be watered because isn't it something how that well if the word of god is true why don't everybody be a christian huh why because it has to be taken in it has to have the spirit come and water that seed it has to what we call quicken that seed brother 10 percently spoke on it brother ben norad talked about it how that the prophecy coming to pass that's where the real power is the word of god quickened is the real power when the holy spirit comes down there and anoints it waters it cause it to sprout not only does that word have to be here but here's a really heavy meat thought there has you have to be a seed of god let me believe that you have to be a seed of god god has come down in your soul and quicken your soul that has to be a seed and then the word comes down there the spirit comes down makes it live makes john 3 16. makes you smile because that's right that's me amen i know that he gave his life for me it's a reality amen if you ever expect to be saved if you ever expect to be healed if you ever expect to overcome the enemy [Music] what do you take in what do you accept what do you receive this here this is what you receive you have to accept what god said amen but god said by his stripes i am healed let that go down into your heart but the venom was so determined to make that seed sprout so determined to plant that seed down that he went in 80s puke through that boy he was going to die in it but he believed with all of his heart he said that's what god said y'all can call the funeral home if you want to i may be there but i have confidence i won't be but today i'm going to live or die but i'm going to eat some of that cornbread i'm gonna eat some of them beans because by his stripes i am healed i believe if you ever overcome if you ever want to promise god take that word in amen praise the lord can we go with a couple more let's go to hebrews and let me see let's go to another one first saint john 6 63 and we'll find out how powerful the word is and what the words really are now i like this i like this say john 6 and 6 let's start with uh 62 why didn't if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before amen all right it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing and here's where the punchline is the words that i speak to you they are spirit let me just ask it we so say so much about the word without the spirit is dead you know well the word is never dead it's only dead to certain people don't receive it right it never never does the bible say the word is dead huh more than just words or actually spirit how many believe that there's their spirit there's their spirit in words just call your son or your daughter tell them they're worthless tell them you're worthless and see if that doesn't penetrate down into their soul huh folks can i just say something so bad and make him man everything i ever heard was you're no good you'll never amount to hillary you'll never mind that never boy never did prison today huh in prison today largely because somebody they continuously run them down don't do that most of us ain't got that problem i hope i'm sure we don't but that's the wrong thing to do why because spirits go on those words you can do it son huh you got to watch how much you break them up he'll be walking around and and getting too proud huh yeah why because spirits are on words that's why jesus said my words are spirit and what else did he say that they are and they are life my words are spirit and they are life amen how many times did david say thou art my buckler and my shield you are my strong tower huh man if you could take those words into your heart and say if thou god was that for him i believe god is that for me watch how god will protect that take the same shield he did amen praise be to god over in hebrews another thing that it says about the word of god in hebrews 4 and 12. for the word of god is very fast okay that doesn't sound quite right does it really do not not quite i don't think it says that brother violet no it says quick what does that quick mean alive he quickeneth he's a quickening spirit amen it's quick not necessarily fast but it's quick and powerful oh my how many believes is powerful the world is powerful i think i missed a scripture so this is a good place to pick it up through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god how many knows that we could go back to genesis in the beginning god said let there be let there be let there be let there be god's word framed the worlds together how many believes tonight that your marriage your home your life your everything about you all of your world it's framed by something it's either framed by unbelief i don't believe it or it's framed together by i believe god's word i believe i know my world my world brother david get up in the morning and you just something the ending you just can't explain it i hope every last i hope that you have that in your heart that you've got a peace that passes understanding i don't know if that kid's song justly does it right i've got the piece that passes understanding down in my heart right peace that passes understanding it's powerful it forms your thursday morning it forms your attitude on the job tomorrow it forms how you act and react towards people it frames every form of you it frames your mind huh what is the mind frame that you got what is the word how has the word framed your mind can anybody tell me the bible says let this mind be in you that was also in christ that's how it frames your mind if you aren't of the mindset that you're willing and want to be a servant like jesus was you humble like jesus was ready to wash the disciples feet ready to be meek gentle patient long-suffering huh let people spit on you let people smack you don't disturb you you're on the rock they can hit you all you want to you're on a rock but you're not afraid to tell people the truth jesus wasn't afraid to tell the pharisees the truth he wasn't afraid to correct love is corrective how many believes that frame it's so powerful that it framed the worlds together how many beliefs when jesus comes on a white horse and you and i come riding on white horses why will it be i'll tell you why it will be it'll be because god thought it already if god saved you tonight and then anything how many is glad for that you can't miss that event if he's gonna be gonna work in you he might be able to perform it no he is able to perform it and all that come unto me i will in some ways cast no wise cast out neither can any man pluck him out of my hand or my father's hand huh no i love i love the security that jesus gives all right i know it's wednesday and i thought about telling you i'm going to leave it short tonight but i don't want to lie like the other preacher says don't lie and if i don't say it you know i'm not committed right amen love him you don't have to sit on a rock you got a nice comfortable seat warm place amen god is good oh reminds me of brother glenn and sherry and them i guess november was one year y'all been coming to church right let's give them a hand okay god bless you amen we appreciate them well praise the lord [Laughter] i was gonna say i'm glad they can put up with us amen that's all right i'm glad to see the work lord's doing amen sure am praise the lord how many wants god just to keep working on you see lord keep framing keep taking that word in keep speaking to my heart lord amen because that's the only thing that matters like like i said listen to that tape i told you about but everyone says this is the only thing that matters is what we do for christ that's really the only thing that matters amen we know that it's powerful quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing of sunder and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and we've seen that manifested through the prophet of god when he could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart he could look at the audience and of course he had to wait till he came he said now you know who i'm waiting for because without him coming and doing it i can't see nothing but he come and he tell you where he was what you were thinking huh a lot of times people think bad stuff he says now don't think that i know what you're thinking amen but that was what that was god he can look down the word of god it looks down in your heart you know it's something how that people can say stuff one thing i've learned is people's actions speak louder than their words doesn't matter what you say but why are you doing what you're doing what is your intent what is your motive you wouldn't do this if it wasn't the motive amen there's a motive behind it and he this word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the motive the intent of what knows nobody's getting away with anything so let's keep our hearts pure so here i am lord look at my heart see where i am forgive me of all my sins how may rise with me raise my hand say lord forgive me of all my sins and failures lord let that word be formed in me because you are folks i'm here to tell you if we are the christians of this hour you are the word manifested for this day you are the light of this world you are the light of this hour in this age and that is a well it's hardly any word to speak it grave responsibility you better be real sincere about it that we make sure that our lives are reflecting christ lord jesus our hands are up our heads are bowed and we say lord jesus cleanse us from all unrighteousness lord you know what's in our hearts each and every one of our heart you know the intent you know how we really are down inside and father we just open before you father we say god we want nothing but jew in there we want to become the word we want to be the word of god we want to be a saved and sanctified and holy ghost-filled person that's living the life of christ manifesting this word to the world manifesting what the grace of god can do what this what the forgiveness that lord that you had that same forgiveness comes out of us to others lord jesus we can say when people do us wrong we can say i forgive you because he forgave me as your word has said forgiving others even as christ has forgiven you lord jesus tonight we ask god as we raise our hands and say lord let your word be formed in the manger of my heart lord let it go from the page to my heart father for with the heart man believeth unto salvation lord we realize the word we want the word nigh us even in our mouth so lord when we go and we're brought before certain situations as your scripture has said don't take no thought of what you're going to say because the holy spirit is what's in you that will do the speaking that's how we want to be lord then now the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth the word of life which we preach paul said we ask god that you draw us ever closer to you lord give us peace in this world of absolutely no peace lord jesus we can't even have christmas anymore hardly for the atheists and people that hate god and religion lord jesus but father i thank you lord jesus for those people that still love you that serve you with all their heart god and want to come to the house of god and want to serve you with all of their heart soul and mind and strength we ask god that you take our hearts now and build nothing but the word frame nothing but the word of god in us take out all everything that is unlike you tonight and we want to thank you for the work that you're doing and then for you showing us where we're still got bad places where we're still not what we ought to be lord thank you for showing us that even though it's ugly and we don't like to see it but we need to see it so we can get on our knees and say god take this character from me lord get this unkindness out of my life make me more gentle he help me to speak slower swifter to hear lord and to think only the thoughts that god would think live only your life lord jesus is what we desire tonight in jesus christ's name amen and amen you love the lord let's give the lord a handset thank you lord jesus thank you lord we come to praise you god in jesus name amen and amen you love one another ain't god good hey
