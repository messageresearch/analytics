[48:15] just bow our heads
[48:18] gracious and kind Heavenly Father we
[48:20] once again come before your throne of
[48:22] grace Lord thanking you father for your
[48:24] goodness to us Lord Jesus and for all
[48:26] that you mean to us Lord
[48:28] for all that you do Lord Jesus and have
[48:30] done Lord and will do it for your word
[48:32] that you have sent us Lord that's a rock
[48:34] to our lives father Lord we just ask God
[48:37] that you'd come again Lord Jesus and
[48:39] help me just to get out of the way that
[48:40] you might speak to your people what you
[48:42] once said Lord
[48:43] and father we ask Lord you bless the
[48:45] meditation of our heart father in that

[48:55] in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen
[49:00] amen turn your bibles if you will let's
[49:03] go to the
[49:04] uh to the Book of Psalms I think we'll
[49:07] go Psalms 34.
[49:19] amen
[49:21] I think tonight we have a brand new
[49:23] message even kind of something I don't
[49:25] remember speaking on before amen that's
[49:28] kind of hard for me to do amen
[49:31] but uh anyway so I'm sure I've covered
[49:35] it it covered it in one way or the other
[49:38] but amen perhaps just a different way
[49:41] so Psalm 34 I Will Bless The Lord at all
[49:46] times his praise shall continually be in
[49:50] my mouth my soul shall make her boast in
[49:53] the Lord to Humble shall hear thereof
[49:55] and be glad o magnify the Lord with me
[49:58] and let us exalt his name together
[50:00] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[50:03] delivered me from all of my fears
[50:05] they looked unto him and were lightened
[50:08] and their faces were not ashamed this
[50:11] man this poor man cried and the Lord
[50:13] heard him and saved him out of all of
[50:15] his troubles
[50:16] the angel of the Lord encampeth around
[50:18] about them that fear Him fear
[50:22] fear Him and delivereth them
[50:25] oh taste and see that the Lord is good
[50:27] blessed is the man that trusts in the
[50:30] Lord
[50:31] amen
[50:34] amen Psalms 81 Psalms 81
[50:40] and I want to read just one verse and
[50:42] perhaps we'll come back and pick up some
[50:44] of the other scriptures that I'd like to
[50:46] touch on but for now we'll just lead
[50:48] read uh
[50:51] um the last verse because I'll get my
[50:53] title from this
[50:55] verse 16 81 and 16 says he should have
[50:59] fed them also with the finest of the
[51:02] wheat and with honey out of the rock
[51:04] should I have satisfied thee amen God
[51:08] bless the reading of the words you can
[51:10] be seated I want to title this honey out
[51:12] of the Rock Amen
[51:15] honey out of the rock praise be to God
[51:18] amen and I want to really speak about
[51:21] healing amen healing
[51:24] amen
[51:26] I got to thinking about healing you know
[51:28] because you know most of the time we
[51:29] think about healing we think about
[51:31] perhaps just our physical body you know
[51:34] but healing uh if you have need of
[51:36] healing it means that you are not in the
[51:39] state that you once was and you need to
[51:42] be redeemed back to what you was once
[51:45] amen back to a a a perfect condition not
[51:49] a fallen condition but a a perfect
[51:51] condition and we realize that the whole
[51:53] world needs healing
[51:56] isn't that right everybody every even
[51:58] though we were all in a big hole and and
[52:01] wounded and and dying so to speak and
[52:04] everybody needs healing tonight and I
[52:06] got to thinking about uh and I'm just
[52:08] gonna go here for now in Hebrews 12.
[52:11] this scripture God come to me when I
[52:13] thought about healing amen and how that
[52:16] uh uh you know we we needed so much in
[52:20] the age that we live in and something
[52:22] that prophet of God said that I want to
[52:23] amen just start with
[52:26] amen and it's in Hebrews the 12th
[52:29] chapter amen Hebrews the 12th chapter
[52:32] and we're gonna read
[52:36] from 11 to 13. amen
[52:42] not no chastening of for the present
[52:44] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[52:47] nevertheless afterwards it yield us the
[52:50] Peaceable fruit of rightness unto them
[52:52] which are exercise
[52:55] thereby
[52:56] amen wherefore lift up the hands which
[52:59] hang down and the feeble knees makes and
[53:04] makes straight paths for your feet at
[53:07] least at least that which is be turned
[53:09] out of the way but let it rather be
[53:13] healed amen so Paul talking about here
[53:17] and I ran across is looking for it and
[53:19] of course Jesus doesn't have a reference
[53:21] but I couldn't help but think that
[53:24] perhaps Paul amen must have read the
[53:26] book of Isaiah and over in Isaiah 35
[53:30] I'll just go quickly go to it 35 and 3
[53:33] it says strengthen ye the weak hands and
[53:37] confirm the feeble knees amen so perhaps
[53:41] Paul Paul picked this up you know
[53:43] because he got the talking about
[53:44] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[53:47] down and the feeble knees in other words
[53:49] somebody that's down somebody that's
[53:52] weak isn't that right and the Bible
[53:54] encourages to to build that up and to
[53:58] strengthen it but abandon makes a
[54:00] statement I'm sure that you've heard it
[54:01] before he says if your brother's in air
[54:03] don't push him down
[54:07] amen so you know because honey knows
[54:11] that it's so easy to do when somebody is
[54:14] in air or somebody does something wrong
[54:16] what is the first thing that we do as
[54:19] human beings see we become judgmental
[54:24] right we first of all we want to condemn
[54:27] them you know instead of finding out
[54:29] perhaps wise in that state or what it is
[54:31] you know and trying to you know pick him
[54:34] back up and and so forth and probably
[54:36] God puts it on this way he's as far as
[54:38] he wants to be now further down he don't
[54:41] want to be any further down help him up
[54:42] give him a hand lift him up amen he
[54:45] lived there love him no matter if you
[54:47] can't agree with him love him anyhow
[54:49] amen and so you see when somebody's sick
[54:52] somebody's feeble somebody a man that
[54:54] needs strength in the Bible encourages
[54:56] you know to to strengthen the people and
[54:59] so forth but we uh then I got to
[55:02] thinking about Jesus you know because
[55:03] we're so quick to condemn rather than to
[55:06] have the right words to say to somebody
[55:09] like that
[55:10] are you with me to encourage him to pick
[55:14] him back up and say no come on now you
[55:16] know let's go you can do it and so forth
[55:18] amen and I was in the I was in my
[55:21] devotions I think it was yesterday
[55:22] morning or this morning and and I was
[55:25] just opened my Bible on my lap my iPad
[55:28] and my it popped up there and this this
[55:31] scripture
[55:33] uh it was right there in front of me and
[55:35] I thought wow that that's really neat
[55:37] and so in job job 16 1-5 he says job
[55:42] then answered and said I have heard many
[55:45] such things miserable comforters are
[55:49] y'all
[55:50] hahaha
[55:52] I mean no job didn't have a lot of real
[55:55] comforters
[55:56] what did they do they accused him of
[55:59] having secrets in or he ain't right with
[56:02] God or something wrong with him
[56:04] amen we've heard different preachers and
[56:07] we've said it here before that it's so
[56:09] easy whenever you know we're going down
[56:11] through them we need we need to be
[56:12] patient and love me but when somebody
[56:14] else says a lot of times we're
[56:16] judgmental
[56:17] and so job's saying here you're
[56:19] miserable comforters shall mean words
[56:23] have an end have you ever y'all remember
[56:25] uh the phrase you know putting yourself
[56:27] in somebody else's shoes right
[56:30] well I got a new one for you all right
[56:33] it's right here
[56:36] and it says or what emboldeth boldness
[56:39] thee that thou answer us I also could
[56:42] speak as ye do if your soul were in my
[56:48] soul Stitch
[56:49] all right so job's saying look if you're
[56:52] about you were in here
[56:54] if your soul wasn't here you know then I
[56:58] and I could Heap up words against you
[57:00] and shake my head at you but all right
[57:04] listen he says he wouldn't shake his
[57:06] head into a lot but I would strengthen
[57:08] you with my mouth
[57:11] uh I would strengthen you with my mouth
[57:13] and the moving up my lips would assume
[57:17] your grief in other words I do not say
[57:20] something
[57:21] to try to comfort you
[57:24] amen so I think it's true that you know
[57:28] we have to be careful that we say the
[57:30] right thing to somebody that's down
[57:33] are you with me no matter if they're
[57:35] straying a little whatever it is being
[57:38] judgmental is never going to do it
[57:39] remember the first words that Jesus said
[57:42] when he come to the world John 3 16 I
[57:44] believe it was amen and I know if I can
[57:46] quote it just perfect like but Jesus
[57:47] says I came not to condemn the world
[57:51] that was not his purpose of coming was
[57:54] to condemn everybody now we know there's
[57:57] going to come at a time now condemnation
[58:00] I'm in those to condemn are to judge I'm
[58:03] not here to
[58:04] judge you now but I'm here to save you
[58:07] I'm not here to condemn you but he's
[58:10] here to save and that's God's purpose
[58:12] today and I believe it will be to uh
[58:14] until the last Christian and say we're
[58:17] going out of here because even Jesus
[58:19] said blessed are the merciful
[58:22] for they shall obtain Mercy why do you
[58:24] think that he didn't condemn the woman
[58:26] caught in a very active adultery
[58:29] isn't that right he didn't condemn her
[58:31] even the Pharisees they had picked up
[58:32] Souls isn't that right they were ready
[58:35] they were ready to get down
[58:38] but Jesus come along and says you know
[58:40] he that he's without sin cast the first
[58:43] stone I imagine we had a holy ghost
[58:46] service right there don't you
[58:48] I imagine the atmosphere was there so
[58:51] strong that it condemned everybody
[58:55] huh I don't know I don't care if there
[58:58] was Paul in there I don't care for
[59:00] somebody that was dogmatic in there that
[59:02] would like to just go ahead and throw
[59:04] the first stone there was such a
[59:06] presence nobody could throw us through
[59:11] huh what an atmosphere that must have
[59:15] been that he had created and that was
[59:17] there and he went riding on the fan you
[59:20] know what I don't know what he wrote but
[59:21] anyway he was writing on the sand and
[59:23] everybody what did they do went back to
[59:25] the house
[59:29] hopefully to repent to think about their
[59:31] own faults
[59:34] now this just comes to me is this okay
[59:36] but wouldn't that be probably the way
[59:39] that it would be for a lot of us if we
[59:40] see somebody within the air whatever if
[59:42] you begin to think about your own faults
[59:44] a little bit you realize hey you know I
[59:47] need to keep my mouth shut maybe I need
[59:50] to go a little show a little kind and
[59:51] show a little Grace have a little Mercy
[59:55] and realize you know I'm not just here
[59:57] to condemn because that's not the
[59:58] purpose the purpose is to lift somebody
[1:00:00] up a Healer to make
[1:00:02] how many knows that the whole purpose of
[1:00:04] Calgary was to save the world to heal
[1:00:07] everybody because everybody needs
[1:00:08] healing
[1:00:10] everybody needs to get honey from The
[1:00:13] Rock
[1:00:14] oh my don't you just love that Honey in
[1:00:17] the Rock
[1:00:18] oh praise the Lord
[1:00:20] all right now notice
[1:00:23] that better man he makes a statement he
[1:00:25] says listen he says that's what's the
[1:00:27] matter with a lot of our Pentecostal
[1:00:28] experiences
[1:00:30] we're lying on something that happened
[1:00:33] way back Yonder and it gets wiggle tails
[1:00:36] in it
[1:00:38] all right can I stop there for a minute
[1:00:41] that's where you that applies to you
[1:00:44] that applies to me that we can't just go
[1:00:46] by our experience of yesterday with the
[1:00:49] Lord you need a daily experience with
[1:00:52] the Lord
[1:00:54] if you don't have a daily walk of daily
[1:00:56] things that happen to delay the things
[1:00:58] that God does the daily drinks from the
[1:01:00] fountain
[1:01:01] huh you're going to get stale
[1:01:05] you're gonna get stagnant
[1:01:08] listen we're going to say he says and
[1:01:11] they get stale what about today he says
[1:01:14] today is the time like David says oh
[1:01:17] taste the honey that's in the Rock David
[1:01:20] said oh how sweet it was there's
[1:01:22] something about honey that God likes
[1:01:25] praise the Lord
[1:01:27] amen let's read the scripture on on this
[1:01:31] now we already uh I'm going too fast
[1:01:33] here
[1:01:35] now notice
[1:01:37] let me finish this here
[1:01:39] all right so he says listen David said
[1:01:42] it was sweet there's something about
[1:01:43] honey and I noticed David being a
[1:01:45] shepherd and that Shepherd used and
[1:01:48] carried a script bag by their side now
[1:01:51] that's what I want to get to that script
[1:01:52] back and in his script back they put
[1:01:55] honey and when their sheep got sick they
[1:01:58] would take some of this honey and they
[1:02:00] would rub it on a rock I'm gonna move
[1:02:02] this down a little bit
[1:02:03] rub it on the Rock and the six sheep
[1:02:06] would go over and get the licking on
[1:02:08] this rock and while licking the honey
[1:02:10] off he got Limestone out for the Rock
[1:02:13] and the Limestone heal the sick sheep
[1:02:18] praise the Lord
[1:02:20] amen what a beautiful type today listen
[1:02:23] friends I got a whole script back here
[1:02:26] honey
[1:02:27] and I'm gonna put it on Christ
[1:02:30] amen put it on Christ I'm gonna put it
[1:02:33] on Christ on the Rock Christ Jesus and
[1:02:36] you six sheep you go to licking now and
[1:02:39] you're sure to get well
[1:02:42] just as certain as anything lick from
[1:02:44] Calvary don't look from some Baptist
[1:02:47] Church in method or some man-made idea
[1:02:49] you can lick on the wrong kind of things
[1:02:51] you'll never get well let me know how
[1:02:53] many know you can go and you can read
[1:02:55] whatever book you want but you'll never
[1:02:57] get the satisfaction that you get from
[1:03:00] reading your Bible
[1:03:02] this is where you lick from if you're
[1:03:04] sick it's there I'll make that for that
[1:03:07] praise be to God
[1:03:09] began to lick from the lick the honey
[1:03:12] off of The Rock
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] you know
[1:03:17] David said it this way
[1:03:19] he says how sweet are thy words unto my
[1:03:23] taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:36] foreign
[1:03:41] and then in Psalms 34 and verse 8
[1:03:45] this is where we read just a minute ago
[1:03:47] but it says oh taste and see that the
[1:03:51] Lord is good
[1:03:54] amen better man talking about the
[1:03:56] Pentecostals how uh the way it sounds
[1:03:58] they would have a service that so Holy
[1:04:00] Ghost filled and they were just licking
[1:04:02] from The Rock and he says people would
[1:04:03] just stand around
[1:04:05] and go
[1:04:11] I thought that's kind of strange but I
[1:04:13] don't want to say anything you get the
[1:04:14] Holy Ghost or anything anybody does you
[1:04:16] know that new inspiration but I got to
[1:04:19] thinking of what does this really mean
[1:04:22] what does it really mean to taste the
[1:04:25] Lord
[1:04:26] no taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:04:31] David said he's sweeter than the honey
[1:04:33] and sweet it on the honeycomb our Lord's
[1:04:36] sweeter than that
[1:04:38] because in this life we know that we all
[1:04:41] love good tasting things things that
[1:04:43] taste good things that are good
[1:04:46] a good ribeye hello good salad amen all
[1:04:49] good things and so he begins to bring
[1:04:51] that over to us and talk about how to
[1:04:53] taste the Lord and see how good it is
[1:04:56] but about in many places and talking
[1:04:57] about Honey in the Rock and he says oh
[1:04:59] have you tasted it
[1:05:01] have you ever tasted how good the Lord
[1:05:03] is
[1:05:05] well
[1:05:07] David explains this here he's when he's
[1:05:10] talking about I Will Bless The Lord at
[1:05:12] all times I will praise praise continue
[1:05:14] his praise shall continually be in my
[1:05:17] mouth why how do you taste it the Lord
[1:05:20] is good well he said he said look this
[1:05:23] poor man cried and the Lord heard how
[1:05:25] many times David cried to the Lord isn't
[1:05:27] that right
[1:05:29] up in verse 4 he says I sought the Lord
[1:05:32] and he heard me and he delivered me out
[1:05:34] of all my fears
[1:05:37] amen when God delivers you when you
[1:05:39] actually are delivered up something just
[1:05:41] like Israel when they were delivered of
[1:05:43] the Egyptians when they come over to the
[1:05:45] other side oh my they've got so good
[1:05:48] that Miriam just beginner oh man she
[1:05:50] couldn't stand good couldn't stand it
[1:05:52] come on sisters let's go dancing
[1:05:55] how many never heard the Sweet Taste of
[1:05:57] victory
[1:05:58] the harder to battle the
[1:06:02] sweeter the victory
[1:06:04] amen and so that's how you taste the
[1:06:06] Lord the way I see it that's how you
[1:06:08] taste how good God is in your life Amen
[1:06:11] brother man I knew what it was like to
[1:06:13] get a real taste listen when we talk
[1:06:15] about this get this because the how many
[1:06:17] knows that Jesus Christ God he is the
[1:06:20] Holy Ghost
[1:06:22] so it doesn't matter how much Bible you
[1:06:23] read or whatever you've got to get the
[1:06:25] spirit not just the word
[1:06:27] but the spirit drink from the spirit
[1:06:29] link from the spirit so to speak
[1:06:33] that's what's sweet otherwise
[1:06:37] yeah he tastes nothing
[1:06:40] I mean it's just as you draw
[1:06:43] amen

[1:06:49] knows whatever you have need of whatever
[1:06:52] the sickness is
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] there's healing in Licking that rock
[1:06:58] licking the honey and getting the and
[1:07:00] and getting the Limestone that you need
[1:07:03] praise be the god
[1:07:05] oh don't you just love that
[1:07:08] all right this poor man cried and the
[1:07:10] Lord heard him and saved him out of all
[1:07:12] his troubles now I don't know maybe he
[1:07:15] was talking about somebody else but I
[1:07:17] know that I happen to know that David
[1:07:18] got into a lot of trouble
[1:07:21] isn't that right he got into a lot of
[1:07:22] trouble a bear a lion
[1:07:26] everybody what did God do deliver him

[1:07:38] that air life
[1:07:39] Oh I thought about this thinking about
[1:07:41] this I thought about this thinking
[1:07:43] about this that's a new one amen and how
[1:07:46] does it say you don't you just can't you
[1:07:48] can't just let the devil run you over
[1:07:51] you can't yield to Temptation and still
[1:07:54] keep you going there's nothing sweet
[1:07:57] about losing the battle
[1:08:00] it's the agony of defeat you'll feed an
[1:08:03] egg in the end oh my downhearted
[1:08:06] driver

[1:08:44] the only chance they have is to go to
[1:08:46] The Rock
[1:08:47] and look
[1:08:50] oh why do you think that we need church
[1:08:52] so much that's where you get the water

[1:09:01] Brother Brad me to anywhere not point to
[1:09:03] him

[1:09:35] they used to what they had their uh what
[1:09:38] they called a mad Stone y'all remember
[1:09:40] the story a person got mad dog bit in
[1:09:44] other words I believe rabies because I
[1:09:45] believe it was when one of these quotes
[1:09:47] you talked about you know they didn't
[1:09:48] have the rabies medicines or Raby shots
[1:09:50] anymore back then
[1:09:52] but the Mad Dog bit and that person was
[1:09:54] a a got mad dog but they take them to
[1:09:57] the Mad Stone and if they got stuck if
[1:09:59] they stuck to the stone they got well
[1:10:02] but if they didn't stay they died
[1:10:07] reminds me of the story of uh an eagle
[1:10:10] going through moping period isn't that
[1:10:12] right as long as he keeps licking as
[1:10:14] long as he keeps eating he'll beat them
[1:10:17] scales off

[1:10:24] brother man said every Christian has to
[1:10:27] be tried
[1:10:28] we all have to get way down to that
[1:10:30] place to where you find out whether
[1:10:32] you're gonna go on or whether you're not
[1:10:36] whether you're gonna give up
[1:10:39] job was there

[1:10:58] through

[1:12:04] home and drinking his whiskey and
[1:12:06] smoking his cigarette and all of this we
[1:12:08] could say doing his pot
[1:12:12] don't contend him for that that's the
[1:12:15] only pleasure that he has
[1:12:18] but he says show him that what you got
[1:12:20] is so much better than that how many

[1:13:24] said it's better to me than honey and
[1:13:26] the honeycomb does the Lord speak into
[1:13:28] his heart

[1:13:35] how many of those remember when he was
[1:13:37] going down a certain way and a lion come
[1:13:39] up you know that's brother bam says he
[1:13:42] says this line looked at him a little
[1:13:43] running little fella I'm gonna have me a
[1:13:45] good meal
[1:13:46] well brother Brandon says you know that
[1:13:48] he wasn't Samson deciding that I'm gonna
[1:13:51] kill this thing he said but the
[1:13:52] difference and what made the difference
[1:13:53] was the spirit of the Lord came upon him
[1:13:56] how many blades that's what we need more
[1:13:58] we need the spirit of the Lord come on
[1:14:01] but the spirit of the Lord comes on you
[1:14:03] to make all the difference in the world
[1:14:04] he slew that diet
[1:14:07] after a few days he was going back by
[1:14:09] that way and he decided to go over to
[1:14:11] visit the lion
[1:14:13] remember that
[1:14:15] he went and visited the line and he
[1:14:17] looked and there was a big old beehive
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:25] sweet honey
[1:14:28] I thought that's the Sweet Taste of
[1:14:30] victory
[1:14:31] and what did he do he went and took it
[1:14:33] home for his mom and dad and mom and dad
[1:14:35] ate it
[1:14:36] but the Bible says he didn't tell his
[1:14:38] parents where it was out of
[1:14:40] you probably wouldn't hate it either if
[1:14:41] you come from an old rotten wine huh
[1:14:45] said it said you can tell him where he
[1:14:48] come from
[1:14:52] reminds me of the bear story right
[1:14:53] remember brother bam talked about it yes
[1:14:55] that molasses in his tent there was him
[1:14:57] bears and he shoot him away and so forth
[1:14:59] and but the one wouldn't leave he just
[1:15:01] would not leave it had no asses all over
[1:15:04] it and it was just enjoying that sweet
[1:15:06] love
[1:15:08] Hallelujah
[1:15:10] like some of us sometimes getting in the
[1:15:12] spirit not just enjoying it
[1:15:15] I'm gonna believe that's what we're
[1:15:16] going to do to enjoy
[1:15:19] it praise be to God
[1:15:21] Lord help us we don't have always have
[1:15:24] to get beat after this when we come to
[1:15:25] church
[1:15:27] we shouldn't always need a whooping no
[1:15:29] we should be there and say Lord just
[1:15:31] talk to me some more father
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:34] that's right
[1:15:36] Hallelujah healing healing in the Rock
[1:15:40] Amen that honey that's in the rock
[1:15:44] oh my there's Honey in the Rock tonight
[1:15:46] how many believe it
[1:15:48] praise God
[1:15:50] all right so now notice you know I've
[1:15:52] often wondered when Moses let the
[1:15:54] children of Israel through the
[1:15:55] Wilderness and when he brought him out
[1:15:57] there was about two million people
[1:15:59] young old all together he led them for
[1:16:02] 40 years now just think of that
[1:16:04] without a sanitation that we have today
[1:16:08] they had young a lot of young people
[1:16:10] there how many babies you think were
[1:16:11] born in a night out of 2 million and
[1:16:13] then besides that old people and
[1:16:15] cripples and things and he left in 40
[1:16:17] years under the leadership of God in the
[1:16:19] wilderness 40 years and when they come
[1:16:22] out it said that it wasn't the feeble
[1:16:24] one among them
[1:16:27] oh my wouldn't you like to look at Dr
[1:16:30] Moses medicine Satchel tonight
[1:16:35] how many knows that
[1:16:37] you just think about it now looking in
[1:16:40] your medicine cabinet
[1:16:41] folks I go in my medicine cabinet and my
[1:16:43] vitamin cabinet and they fall out when I
[1:16:46] open the door there's so many of them
[1:16:49] I don't know about you look at your boy
[1:16:51] there's this and there and the other you
[1:16:52] know not so much the medicine now as it
[1:16:55] is vitamins
[1:16:57] but you have your medicine cabinet isn't
[1:16:59] that right and then if man you know can
[1:17:02] you imagine I was just thinking about
[1:17:03] this trying to uh think with Bill
[1:17:05] abandon here of two million people out
[1:17:07] there in the wilderness no doctor's
[1:17:10] offices
[1:17:12] I don't remember any doctors other than
[1:17:14] Dr Moses
[1:17:16] brother Brandon called him Dr Moses
[1:17:18] right
[1:17:20] amen and what it had to do listen
[1:17:23] now so notice he says look at his
[1:17:26] Satchel to see what he had to keep them
[1:17:28] well would you like to look at it he
[1:17:30] says I can show it to you over in the
[1:17:33] book of Exodus I show you this is his
[1:17:35] medicine's chest and it sat back there
[1:17:38] I'll look right into that medicine sack
[1:17:40] and see what it says
[1:17:41] and then what did he say it says he says
[1:17:43] listen it was
[1:17:44] I am the Lord that healeth all thy
[1:17:48] diseases
[1:17:50] that's all he had to go by
[1:17:53] I may believe he's our healer
[1:17:57] praise be to God he's our Healer not not
[1:17:59] just not just for physical healing but
[1:18:02] for everything
[1:18:04] praise God
[1:18:06] when there was a baby boy he said
[1:18:08] somebody had perhaps appendicitis or
[1:18:10] broke out with TB or anything like that
[1:18:13] here's first of all this prescription
[1:18:15] I'm the Lord that healeth thee that's
[1:18:17] the only thing that he had I am the Lord
[1:18:19] that healeth it that's the only thing he
[1:18:21] had and that is good enough
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] every one of them they just prayed for
[1:18:27] him and he got well and you know another
[1:18:29] thing happened during the time in the
[1:18:30] wilderness is they didn't even
[1:18:33] need any new shoes when they came out
[1:18:36] and their clothes never got threatened
[1:18:43] haha
[1:18:46] can you imagine I imagine somebody just
[1:18:48] had a little jump and fit once in a
[1:18:49] while you know the pants is as good as
[1:18:51] what they were
[1:18:53] huh my shirt's as good as it was my
[1:18:56] shoes are good what
[1:18:59] they were a walking Miracle every day
[1:19:05] we don't see it so much but you're a
[1:19:08] walking Miracle every day
[1:19:10] why because God is supplying all your
[1:19:14] needs
[1:19:15] how maybe that's why it's so good that's
[1:19:17] what tastes so good about the Lord he
[1:19:20] has promised he would take care of me
[1:19:22] now and in my future when I come to the
[1:19:25] door of death if I would in that going
[1:19:26] to Rapture hopefully I'll go in the rap
[1:19:28] but he's going to take care of all of it
[1:19:30] how many believe that
[1:19:32] the good things what is it that makes
[1:19:34] the Lord taste so good all of his
[1:19:36] precious promises said he gives us
[1:19:38] I'll never leave thee I'll never forsake
[1:19:41] thee my God shall supply all your need
[1:19:43] according to his riches in Christ Jesus
[1:19:47] he supplies all our needs how many knows
[1:19:49] that to see him do it he delivers us out
[1:19:53] of all our troubles
[1:20:00] oh my a lot of us should think back
[1:20:02] think back a little bit and look at the
[1:20:04] trouble that you've had in your life
[1:20:07] aren't you glad you're past that
[1:20:09] aren't you glad you don't have to go
[1:20:11] through that not that there won't be
[1:20:13] more troubles but God delivered you out
[1:20:15] of that wasn't that sweet wasn't that
[1:20:17] wonderful let me know she's delivered
[1:20:19] you out of your sin he's forgiven you of
[1:20:21] all your transgressions watched you why
[1:20:24] does snow that's what's so good about
[1:20:26] the Lord
[1:20:27] that's what tastes so good
[1:20:30] folks it's sweeter than any kind of a
[1:20:32] honey it's the sweetest thing in this
[1:20:34] world
[1:20:35] but not as sweet as God God is sweeter
[1:20:38] than honey he's sweeter than a honeycomb
[1:20:41] he's Pace better than anything else in
[1:20:43] the world
[1:20:47] and you can think about many things the
[1:20:50] devil would try to offer people and he
[1:20:51] gives people
[1:20:52] popularity Fame
[1:20:55] money wealth
[1:20:57] houses lands more money they know what
[1:20:59] to spend with
[1:21:01] that has been
[1:21:03] hey let me tell you something you got
[1:21:05] something more precious than that
[1:21:08] that's sweeter than all the riches of
[1:21:10] the world
[1:21:13] to have him
[1:21:15] he is that sweet honey
[1:21:18] the cleft of the rock remember that
[1:21:21] honey that came out of the cleft of the
[1:21:23] rock that's out of Jesus's side
[1:21:25] came honey
[1:21:27] sweeter than honey
[1:21:29] amen
[1:21:31] praise be to God Abraham how many knows
[1:21:34] Abraham needed some healing Abraham and
[1:21:36] Sarah
[1:21:37] they needed it
[1:21:39] what did God do
[1:21:41] that's at
[1:21:43] 100 years old
[1:21:46] Abraham a hundred years or 99 something
[1:21:48] went there and Sarah at 65 or was it 75.
[1:21:52] it's 25 years apart
[1:21:54] been 75 years old it was
[1:22:01] see they gave it the promise at 65 I
[1:22:04] believe it was 75 to 85
[1:22:07] 95.30 it's 25 years anyway
[1:22:10] but it was so many years and God had to
[1:22:12] do what heal their bodies change them
[1:22:14] back
[1:22:15] just to be able to receive the promise
[1:22:17] that he had given him
[1:22:21] I don't know about you brother Glenn but
[1:22:23] if I got changed back to a young man
[1:22:26] again
[1:22:27] remember Sarah and the King down there
[1:22:29] said come on here I want you to possibly
[1:22:31] be my wife
[1:22:33] that's where brother Brandon made the
[1:22:34] case that she had to be turned back
[1:22:35] because she wouldn't be 75 years old him
[1:22:38] and him wanting a grand great grandma
[1:22:42] but he had changed her back I believe it
[1:22:44] takes a profit to know those things
[1:22:45] don't you you and I could probably never
[1:22:48] pick that out or know that or couldn't
[1:22:49] say it for sure but he's the prophet of
[1:22:51] God he that's the one that the word of
[1:22:53] the Lord comes to
[1:22:55] that's why he could tell you the color
[1:22:56] of Eve's higher isn't that right
[1:22:58] but he seen that once again young how do
[1:23:01] you end the Rock
[1:23:03] Honey in the Rock David
[1:23:05] how it was Honey in the Rock the victory
[1:23:07] that he had over Goliath and over the
[1:23:09] Bears
[1:23:10] how many beliefs I can see him doing a
[1:23:13] jig I believe he can hippie dance and
[1:23:15] eat behind it is he's good
[1:23:18] amen isn't that what you say when you
[1:23:20] eat something good at this is good
[1:23:22] that's the way it is with the Lord this
[1:23:24] is good God is good
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:28] praise be to God we need to drink more
[1:23:31] of the spirit
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] you talk about a mad dog bit by the
[1:23:37] devil people have gone completely mad
[1:23:40] completely not completely crazy
[1:23:44] there's only one rock there's only one
[1:23:46] cure
[1:23:50] maybe Donald Trump or maybe Nancy Pelosi
[1:23:52] will have the answer do you reckon
[1:23:55] you Reckoning politicians are going to
[1:23:57] have the right answer
[1:23:59] no they'll never have the right answer
[1:24:01] well we're going to come up with a
[1:24:03] solution we're going to get on the
[1:24:04] soapbox and we're going to run and I'm
[1:24:05] going to run for Congress and I'm gonna
[1:24:07] run on this and we're going to fix it no
[1:24:10] the only way you'll fix it there's only
[1:24:12] one way they can fix it that's to point
[1:24:14] him to this
[1:24:16] when they took prayer out of school they
[1:24:19] messed up
[1:24:20] when they took correction out of school

[1:24:25] them now what did they got a sour
[1:24:27] terrible taste horrible because they did
[1:24:30] not stay with The Rock
[1:24:32] I mean there's only one solution for
[1:24:33] this Mad World
[1:24:35] the only solution for anybody has any
[1:24:37] troubles is coming to the Rock come to
[1:24:39] the word

[1:29:20] Lord and magnify the Lord by raising
