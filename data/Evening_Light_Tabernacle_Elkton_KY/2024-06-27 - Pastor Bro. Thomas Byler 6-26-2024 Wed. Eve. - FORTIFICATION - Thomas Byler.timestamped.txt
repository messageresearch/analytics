[28:47] midst Lord and father truly may we be
[28:49] able to say father when we leave here
[28:51] that not our hearts burn within us as
[28:53] you spoke to us along the way we ask God
[28:57] that you'll bless the medit ation of a
[28:58] heart that which we feel you've laid
[29:00] upon a heart to minister Lord we ask God
[29:02] that you would just give us the ability
[29:04] and the anointing and the anointing
[29:06] father that only can come from you Lord
[29:08] and for those streaming tonight Lord we
[29:11] ask God that you would just be with them
[29:13] in a special way and help us to learn
[29:15] Lord from this lesson God that I feel
[29:17] you have brought to my attention and
[29:19] laid on my heart to speak tonight for we
[29:21] ask it in Jesus name amen and amen
[29:26] praise the Lord
[29:28] amen if you will turn your Bibles to
[29:33] Ephesians the book of
[29:35] Ephesians this will be again this will
[29:37] go along with our series Amen on
[29:40] releasing the power of God and you know
[29:44] I've been thinking about that but and it
[29:46] has to do it really has to do with that
[29:49] and so uh that's why I kind of connected
[29:51] in there amen learning how to be a
[29:54] better Christian how many wants to learn
[29:55] to be a better Christian there's some
[29:57] questions questions that I'd like to
[29:58] kind of answer with the help of the Lord
[30:01] a kind of a question that I have had in
[30:03] my mind a little bit going uh some of
[30:06] the things the prophet of God said amen
[30:08] and then perhaps we'll have a better
[30:11] understanding it of it it's always good
[30:13] when you have a question when you ask
[30:15] God a question amen it's nice if you
[30:18] catch it when he answers you is't it
[30:21] amen because he'll answer you amen God
[30:24] always answers we're just not always
[30:26] listening amen
[30:28] sometimes maybe it's not the answer we
[30:30] want but there was just a little
[30:33] question that I had amen and uh so we're
[30:37] just GNA continue I think where we was
[30:40] at last time we talked about when we was
[30:43] ministering we was into the land of the
[30:45] promised land amen being placed in the
[30:47] promised land amen and uh not wanting to
[30:51] go out there outside of the promised
[30:54] land get getting off uh Mount zir I
[30:57] guess it was getting off the mountain
[30:58] away from the mountain and quit circling
[31:00] around things and so forth and go on
[31:03] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:05] because that's our promised land is it
[31:07] right amen and we found out there that
[31:10] even though uh you are in the promised
[31:13] land we know that um that doesn't mean
[31:17] that you're free from Wars isn't that
[31:19] right doesn't mean that you're free from
[31:21] war now after you're in that don't mean
[31:23] that you're free from war you still have
[31:25] to fight for every inch of ground amen
[31:28] that you stand on amen amen so you know
[31:32] and we want to try to with the help of
[31:34] the Lord look at that tonight because my
[31:35] head question you know uh we're we're in
[31:38] a battle we're in a constant battle and
[31:40] there's another scripture where brother
[31:42] Bram says you know that real genuine
[31:44] faith is completely based upon rest and
[31:47] God fights your battles for you amen so
[31:51] are we resting or are we fighting which
[31:53] one are we doing amen amen and so uh you
[31:57] know I just had that question I said how
[31:59] why would we have to fight for every
[32:01] inch of ground amen that we get one
[32:04] place I was seeing where where uh
[32:06] brother Brandon was talking about um
[32:08] Moses and those uh Israelites he says
[32:12] now I've given you the land now go get
[32:14] it now go take it now go fight for it
[32:17] I've given it to you but you're going to
[32:19] have to fight for every inch you get am
[32:22] man and I don't really understand that
[32:24] to give me a little detail about that
[32:26] right just kind of broad right there you
[32:29] know but I like I like I like detail I
[32:32] like detail and amen maybe tonight we
[32:35] can go in there a little bit more
[32:36] detailed about what this battle really
[32:39] is amen how many wants to learn about
[32:42] what this battle is really all about
[32:44] what in the world are we fighting you
[32:45] know what do we got to fight amen amen
[32:48] and so what is our land that we want to
[32:50] go possess and what we want to go take
[32:53] amen well it's not as far away as what
[32:56] you might think amen so in Ephesians
[33:01] 4 no it's not four Ephesians
[33:05] 6 amen I don't know if you got that to
[33:07] put up there in Carson or not brother
[33:09] Carson all right finally Brethren be
[33:12] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[33:15] His might and put on the whole armor of
[33:18] God that you may be able to stand
[33:20] against the Ws of the Devils amen so
[33:23] Paul's certainly saying here that if
[33:25] you're going to be strong in the power
[33:26] of the might amen man you better put on
[33:28] the whole armor of God so you'll be able
[33:30] to stand against what the Devil comes at
[33:33] you with so the devil's going to come at
[33:35] you isn't he no he's not just going to
[33:38] take a break he's going to keep coming
[33:39] at you am me I unfortunately I hate to
[33:43] tell you this but this battle is going
[33:45] to take place and it's going to keep on
[33:47] going amen until we get out of here amen
[33:51] till you get out of here you're going to
[33:52] be fighting this battle for we wrestle
[33:56] not against flesh and blood now first of
[33:58] all we realize here that we're not
[34:00] having a fist fight here no anybody that
[34:03] takes it and does like Peter said and
[34:05] I'm cut his ear off you know mean this
[34:08] is not a physical
[34:09] fight no it's not a natural fight it's a
[34:13] spiritual fight in this in the spiritual
[34:16] realm anytime somebody takes it into the
[34:20] natural
[34:22] amen something about the Bible says you
[34:24] know know this that the wrath of man
[34:27] does not work the righteousness of God
[34:31] Amen that's
[34:33] right so it's not flesh and blood it's
[34:36] not a flesh and blood battle it's a
[34:39] principalities it's Powers against the
[34:42] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[34:44] spiritual wickedness in high places for
[34:47] for take unto you the whole armor of God
[34:49] that you be able to withstand in the
[34:52] evil day and having done all to stand
[34:55] stand therefore having your lawy about
[34:58] with truth and having on the breastplate
[35:01] of righteousness your feet shot with the
[35:03] preparation of the gospel and above all
[35:06] take the shield of Faith wherewith ye
[35:08] shall be able to quench all the fiery
[35:11] darts of the wicked may God add His
[35:14] blessings to the reading of the word you
[35:15] can be seated tonight I really like that
[35:19] last verse don't you amen what is it
[35:22] that's going to quench all the fiery
[35:26] darts of that Wicked one it's
[35:29] Faith amen so the battle is between
[35:33] faith and doubt amen faith and
[35:38] doubt
[35:41] amen so my question kind of was Lord
[35:44] what what is this battle what do we
[35:46] fight where's our real battle at
[35:50] amen
[35:56] amen and I want to
[35:58] parallel parallel two thing two things I
[36:01] want to try to bring to a parallel one
[36:03] of them is that when the children of
[36:06] Israel went into the promised land
[36:10] brother brandham says it this way they
[36:12] slayed amorites and Hittites he says and
[36:15] there wasn't one hurt among them among
[36:19] any of them until sin came into the camp
[36:22] when aen took that Babylonian garment
[36:24] and that gold wedge and hid it on under
[36:28] his Camp amen and the next day they lost
[36:32] 36 men ain't that right amen and and
[36:36] Joshua said wait a minute stop there's
[36:39] something wrong here is't that right
[36:41] they all went on a fast you that right
[36:44] God made us a promise there will be
[36:46] nothing heard among us nobody will be
[36:49] able to stand before you is that right
[36:52] is that a promise of the believer that
[36:54] your enemy is not supposed to be able to
[36:56] stand before you
[36:59] n it's got to go whatever that enemy is
[37:03] it's got to go if you're in the place
[37:05] that you're supposed to
[37:06] be now why did they die brother B say
[37:10] why did these innocent men die because
[37:12] one man stepped out of
[37:16] line amen praise the Lord the reason
[37:20] that this needs to be taught tonight the
[37:21] church lining up lining up with the word
[37:23] of God lining up with God and lining up
[37:25] with each other walking perfect
[37:27] perfectly up upright soberly before all
[37:30] men fearing amen and fearing God so we
[37:35] want to look at that we want to look
[37:36] first of all that they all had to stay
[37:39] in line they all had to stay in order
[37:42] aen did not but he got out of order
[37:44] isn't that right he got out of line amen
[37:48] now before I go to the other side I want
[37:50] to take you to a message brother the
[37:51] brand and preach and this is what I feel
[37:53] like the Holy Spirit took me it's
[37:55] something that I've preached many times
[37:57] here so don't think that it's something
[37:58] new but we'll just see what the Lord
[38:00] will do with it all right but I I think
[38:03] by by the end of the service you'll see
[38:05] why it's so
[38:06] important but uh anyway so first we
[38:11] realize that why I wrote down here why
[38:14] does man always why do we need why do we
[38:17] look for
[38:19] fortification why do we look for
[38:22] security amen why do we build things
[38:24] amen like uh the first thing that we can
[38:28] think of how that man amen the reason
[38:30] that we uh built fortifications and and
[38:34] places of shelter is because we realize
[38:36] we're living in a dangerous
[38:41] world a world of
[38:45] mortality
[38:47] amen you know I was sitting there on
[38:50] my chair on the front porch and I've
[38:54] been shooting some sparrows because
[38:56] they're take trying to take over my
[38:58] Martin
[38:59] box and I said well Lord you wrote in
[39:02] the Bible I guess he said you knew I was
[39:04] going to shoot some Martins because you
[39:05] know the fall of every
[39:07] Sparrow he know it's the fall of a
[39:09] sparrow ain't that right but I thought
[39:12] you know isn't it something how did man
[39:14] I could just turn that gun on my horse
[39:16] my cow my dog my cat I could turn my gun
[39:19] on any of them and shoot him and kill
[39:24] him and I thought what a terrible thing
[39:27] isin't that right and I thought you know
[39:29] because we're living in a world of
[39:31] mortality isin't that right and that's
[39:34] why evil people that's why Hitler did
[39:36] what he did ain't that right because
[39:38] we're living in a Mor a world of
[39:41] mortality I thought aren't you looking
[39:43] forward to the time that no people can
[39:46] try to shoot you no there won't be
[39:48] nobody shooting you if it did it' just
[39:50] go through you ain't that right
[39:53] immortality no no you can't be killed
[39:56] I'm looking for a world where you can't
[39:58] be
[40:00] killed
[40:02] amen and so it's really a terrible world
[40:05] to live in De trying to cross the road
[40:07] and everything you get hit all the
[40:10] animals I always hate to see all of that
[40:13] now how many believes you are looking
[40:14] and were longing for a place of
[40:19] immortality I heard brother bam talking
[40:21] in adoption series I've been listening
[40:22] to that he was talking about you know
[40:24] how that he was C caught up in that
[40:26] other dimension and he said says since
[40:27] that he says I don't have one lick of
[40:30] fear one bit of fear of
[40:33] death and he said you don't have to
[40:36] either amen you don't have to fear
[40:38] because over there he was transported
[40:40] over there and then he got to talking
[40:42] about he said Paul he said that he was
[40:45] that was the maybe a first Heaven he
[40:47] said that he was caught up into the
[40:48] third heaven and couldn't even speak of
[40:52] it how many Heavens are out there
[40:55] brother Tommy what's it going to be
[40:57] life we can't
[41:00] imagine then that just comes to my mind
[41:02] having listened to it he says you know
[41:04] this world and where we're living in he
[41:07] says it's like a burning City down that
[41:09] has all of the smell of the rats and all
[41:12] the garbage and that smoke in that vapor
[41:14] and he says man when you go when he went
[41:16] to a certain place and he had to get a
[41:17] whiff of that he says oh man it would be
[41:19] terrible he says now we're not of the
[41:22] Cesspool we're not of that debauchery of
[41:24] the world but we're still living in that
[41:26] type of Bacher world that type of a
[41:30] stinking
[41:32] World we're looking for a better place
[41:34] aren't
[41:35] we amen now it's kind of what brought me
[41:39] to this my my thought of it it looks
[41:41] like I'm jumping around here because
[41:42] amen but I want to talk basically I was
[41:45] thinking on the Warfare that we're in
[41:49] amen and I was thinking of it in a in a
[41:52] uh sense of defense is that right
[41:56] something to Amen to where it it stops
[41:59] the enemy from coming in ain't that
[42:03] right cuz Satan like a roaring lion
[42:07] Peter said goes about seeking whom he
[42:10] may
[42:10] devour so he's going to attack and we're
[42:13] going to have to have a defense we're
[42:16] going to have to have a shield we're
[42:18] going to have to have
[42:20] protection we're going to have to have
[42:23] fortification ain't that right amen and
[42:26] man fortification I want talk about for
[42:29] just a minute amen even it doesn't uh
[42:32] all the way back you go all the way back
[42:33] all the way to perhaps uh nimrod's time
[42:36] after the flood how many knows that
[42:38] Nimrod tried to build a tower so high
[42:41] that God could flood the Earth and they
[42:43] could climb that
[42:48] Tower can I say
[42:50] something imagine Humanity being so dumb
[42:55] that they think they can outsmart God
[43:00] God they thought they were smart but
[43:02] they were pretty dumb weren't
[43:06] they I mean didn't it come into their
[43:09] minds that you know there is such a
[43:10] thing as earthquakes it might just shake
[43:13] it over a little bit you
[43:15] know there's uh what do you call those
[43:19] sink
[43:20] holes God can take that Tower down
[43:24] with with his fingernails
[43:27] you know just
[43:28] nothing but they wanted security because
[43:31] they didn't want to be able to be
[43:32] destroyed
[43:34] again amen how many believes we Flee for
[43:37] our life amen flee amen we have fled for
[43:42] Refuge the Bible says we have fled for
[43:44] Refuge amen and that Refuge is never in
[43:49] anything
[43:50] manmade
[43:52] nope Amen brother Braham talked about
[43:55] fortification when he talked about the
[43:57] French after the first world war built
[43:59] the magnet line I believe it was amen
[44:01] the magnet line they had all these
[44:03] cannons turned TOS Germany but Germany
[44:06] went right around them amen is that
[44:09] right and then Germany built the seek
[44:11] free line 630 some miles of
[44:13] fortification concrete and that didn't
[44:16] work either didn't it no it didn't
[44:19] work us Americans we think we're so
[44:22] secure we got all these nuclear
[44:25] bombs we got these nule Subs where oh
[44:28] man we're the top of the food chain when
[44:30] it comes to
[44:31] military but how many knows we're going
[44:33] to think different whenever those bombs
[44:35] are going through disguise that's fixing
[44:36] the fry our
[44:38] hide that's right there's a fire coming
[44:41] no no you're not secure only place
[44:43] you're secure is in Christ
[44:46] Nebuchadnezzar and ab belti Shazer if
[44:48] you remember they thought they were
[44:49] secure behind their walls the superpower
[44:53] of that time amen getting the vessels so
[44:56] that came from the the temple and having
[44:57] a drinking wine and having a party
[45:00] brother said a rock and roll party with
[45:02] all of these beatnicks and twists and
[45:04] all of the man to Wine women and all of
[45:06] that he says y to think that God don't
[45:09] see you you aren't never so fortified
[45:12] and that's a lot of times when people
[45:14] amen get slacked and everything else
[45:16] when they think they're so fortified and
[45:18] so
[45:19] secure amen after tonight you'll find
[45:21] out that you have to be on your toes all
[45:24] the time
[45:27] you have to be on guard I think it was
[45:29] Paul said let him that thinketh that he
[45:31] standeth take heat least he fall so even
[45:34] when you're standing having done all to
[45:36] stand stand therefore even when you are
[45:38] standing you still have to be on
[45:41] guard CU if you are not on guard
[45:45] tomorrow something's going to
[45:50] happen amen every day you have to be on
[45:54] guard every hour of every day hey the
[45:57] enemy cries to come in and he has lots
[46:01] of doors to come in at lots of ways to
[46:04] come in
[46:05] at lots of different things that happen
[46:07] to us sometimes that causes the enemy to
[46:10] come in and to be able to come in we
[46:13] want to look at some of those things is
[46:14] that okay praise the
[46:17] Lord all right praise the Lord
[46:21] Colossians
[46:23] said I didn't put a sticker in there did
[46:26] I
[46:32] Philippians Colossians 3 says for ye are
[46:35] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[46:37] God Amen how many believes that our life
[46:40] is hid with God let me read you a couple
[46:43] Psalms before we get get going here
[46:45] Psalms 57 it's uh David said it this way
[46:48] he said be merciful unto me oh God be
[46:51] merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in
[46:54] thee y in the shadow of of thy Wings
[46:57] will I make my
[47:00] refuge amen until these calamities be

[52:50] kinds of tribulation shelters and food

[53:00] disappointment all right so there you go

[53:30] bit amen praise the
[53:34] Lord
[53:36] amen praise the Lord you love
[53:39] him that's right so he is Christ is our
[53:44] shelter Shelter From what Shelter From
[53:49] what so let's first of all look what is
[53:52] our
[53:55] enemy what's the greatest
[53:59] enemy yeah it's not so much the
[54:04] devil the greatest battle ever fought is
[54:06] what we're going to teach out of tonight
[54:08] that okay the greatest battle that ever
[54:11] fought and it's been
[54:14] raging it's been raging I wrote down on
[54:17] my paper since the beginning of
[54:21] time and I scribbled out that
[54:25] beginning and I said since before
[54:31] time yeah this battle has been raging
[54:34] long before time ever
[54:36] began how many believe
[54:40] that amen it's your ass all right let's
[54:44] start I don't
[54:48] know if you can get the first quote up
[54:50] or not I sent him some quotes we're
[54:52] going to try it if not I've got it on my
[54:54] iPad amen
[54:58] one thing I don't have brother Bram said
[55:00] in be as he began he says you know how
[55:02] that he says uh the devil really is
[55:06] harmless unless he's got somebody to
[55:09] work
[55:10] through how many believes that the devil
[55:13] is pretty much harmless unless he's got
[55:16] somebody to work
[55:17] through and he says God is kind of the
[55:20] same way not that he can't but he also
[55:23] has to have somebody to work through
[55:27] so that's where the battle is it's a
[55:29] battle for
[55:31] control
[55:33] amen and we want to look at this battle
[55:36] that we talk about what are we fighting
[55:38] for where are we
[55:41] fighting
[55:44] amen all right first one goes like this
[55:47] I went to bed and I begin to think of
[55:50] those one of those that get out of place
[55:52] and if yall remember brother bam was out
[55:54] in the open and he looked at the stars
[55:58] the
[55:58] galaxy the whole creation isin't that
[56:01] right and he thoughted about them as
[56:03] being the Heavenly
[56:05] hosts is that right and he talked about
[56:08] how that if one of
[56:10] those they all set in their place and if
[56:14] there's a moving anywhere of them it's
[56:16] for a cause and it will affect this
[56:19] Earth and we just see the results of it
[56:22] now from some of them moving out of
[56:23] their spots it's effective it affects
[56:26] every everything and I thought that if
[56:28] that great Heavenly Host like that has
[56:30] to keep its place to make everything in
[56:34] order what about the disorder of the he
[56:37] Earthly host how when one gets out of
[56:41] order a that right kind of like
[56:44] aen when one gets out of order if the
[56:47] moon would shift from what I understand
[56:49] if the moon would move butram says the
[56:52] tidle waves that come on in that Moon
[56:55] controls the the
[56:59] waves now this comes fresh in other
[57:02] words I think what he meant by that was
[57:04] I don't have it wrote
[57:06] down but you think about the Moon that
[57:09] it keeps its place it keeps the waters
[57:12] from overflowing us and the church is a
[57:16] type of that
[57:18] Moon ain't that right and how many knows
[57:20] the church got out of her
[57:23] place why do you think that we've got
[57:25] the flood of sin he says you watch sin
[57:28] coming now you watch you just come swim
[57:32] and get in and go all the way Plum to
[57:34] the
[57:35] core that's right because the
[57:37] Pentecostal Baptist all of them they
[57:39] should have got in
[57:41] line think of the Millennium we could
[57:44] have had amen if all of those churches
[57:46] would have got in line with the revealed
[57:48] word of the hour but now they rejected
[57:51] the reveal word of the
[57:53] hour they got out of place and now what
[57:56] we got assess pull of
[57:59] in like you've never
[58:01] seen he looks at those and says
[58:09] my amen when get one gets out of order
[58:13] how it throws the whole thing out of
[58:15] cater the whole program of God is upset
[58:17] when one member gets out of order we
[58:20] should continually to strive to keep the
[58:24] order of the
[58:28] spirit and I would to God this morning
[58:31] that we would bring this to a real
[58:33] healing service that we could keep this
[58:36] group that we have gathered under this
[58:37] roof this morning in such a Harmony that
[58:40] the Holy Spirit would place every member
[58:42] of the body that's here this morning in
[58:45] such Harmony till there would be such a
[58:48] spontaneous healing of the body and soul
[58:52] if we'll just hold our possessions
[59:02] amen hold our
[59:05] positions adoption series brother bam
[59:07] says you know I'm looking at some older
[59:10] sisters in their 60s pretty faed mothers
[59:14] that would say well what have I ever
[59:16] done you know what have I ever done for
[59:18] God he said you have done what God
[59:19] wanted you to do you've raised your
[59:22] children God has a place for you ain't

[1:03:04] leaving a scar don't you know that that
[1:03:06] same God is here the only thing that
[1:03:09] he's waiting for is for his army to get
[1:03:12] in position like the stars get in
[1:03:20] position how many times have we been
[1:03:23] told if anybody ever got healed if
[1:03:25] you'll meet the same same conditions
[1:03:26] that they met you'll get your
[1:03:31] healing
[1:03:32] amen but you got to meet those same
[1:03:35] conditions you got to come to that same
[1:03:38] place well what is that well for one
[1:03:41] thing but for brother brandham it was
[1:03:43] eating the puke that he threw up because
[1:03:44] he believed by his stripes I'm Healed in
[1:03:47] three days from now I'm going to be
[1:03:49] better or perhaps from three days from
[1:03:51] now they're going to have to bury me cuz

[1:04:09] it is't that
[1:04:13] right that's
[1:04:15] right waiting for them to get into
[1:04:18] positions and I won't go through this we
[1:04:20] already know that there's only two
[1:04:21] Powers ain't that right two kingdoms
[1:04:24] every disorder everything that comes
[1:04:26] along it's either God's power or Satan's
[1:04:29] power there's only two Powers there is
[1:04:32] and I want to tell you this that
[1:04:33] everything that comes into your mind
[1:04:36] every thought that goes into your mind
[1:04:38] is either God's
[1:04:40] thought the devil's
[1:04:42] thought
[1:04:45] amen praise the Lord and so a army first
[1:04:50] in getting ready for a battle first
[1:04:52] there's got to be a select some soldiers
[1:04:55] they've got to be dressed for fighting
[1:04:57] and they've got to be trained for
[1:05:01] fighting now how many knows I believe
[1:05:03] that's why brother bandam preaching this
[1:05:05] now so think about this in this greatest
[1:05:07] battle ever fought brother bandam

[1:05:12] recognized and brought in about some of
[1:05:14] these things about the order of things
[1:05:17] ain't that right and how that first it
[1:05:19] has to be trained that's what we want to

[1:05:54] wo my my
[1:05:57] goodness well let me tell you let me see
[1:06:00] here I've got Thomas's book of theology
[1:06:04] his version of what a battle's all about
[1:06:07] are you ready to hear
[1:06:11] it doesn't sound good at all no even I
[1:06:15] throw it away get rid of that
[1:06:18] thing no but what do we got a Vindicated
[1:06:22] Prophet anointed by God himself that

[1:06:27] those scriptures you can count on
[1:06:30] that amen you're going to get the proper
[1:06:33] training it's going to be accurate it's

[1:06:57] amen that's right you're going to have
[1:06:59] to be dressed for fighting they've got
[1:07:00] to be trained for fighting and I believe
[1:07:02] that the greatest battle that was ever
[1:07:04] fought he now ready to go into action
[1:07:06] and he took the scripture from Daniel
[1:07:08] there will be a time such as there never
[1:07:10] was before but Abram says you're living
[1:07:12] in that time that such as never was
[1:07:14] before like never before
[1:07:18] amen amen the greatest battle that was
[1:07:20] ever for is now ready to go into action
[1:07:23] I believe that God is selecting his
[1:07:25] solders ERS I believe that he's dressing
[1:07:27] them training them and the Battlefront
[1:07:31] is now set getting ready to
[1:07:34] start
[1:07:38] amen the great this great first battle
[1:07:41] that was ever fought beginning
[1:07:44] Heaven Before
[1:07:46] Time this battle has been raging since
[1:07:50] before
[1:07:52] time been going on a long time
[1:07:58] amen and we know that this battle that
[1:08:00] started in heaven brother B says then it
[1:08:02] was thrown down from heaven cast out of
[1:08:05] Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[1:08:08] beings then the battle from Angels
[1:08:11] become human
[1:08:13] battles and Satan come to destroy God's
[1:08:16] creation and God that God created to be
[1:08:18] for himself the Devil comes to destroy
[1:08:21] it that's what is his purpose is is to
[1:08:24] destroy it and then that battle begin
[1:08:26] here on Earth it begin in us and has
[1:08:28] been raging ever
[1:08:32] since amen where is the battle what do
[1:08:34] we got to fight for what are we fighting
[1:08:37] for before any battle can be put in
[1:08:40] Array they first must have a choosing
[1:08:42] place a choosing ground where this
[1:08:44] battle is going to be fought with this
[1:08:47] elected PE place is't that
[1:08:49] right Amen Let me
[1:08:52] see now in the first World War they
[1:08:56] selected a place it was a no man's
[1:09:00] land is where they fought in the world
[1:09:02] first world war so the place that it's
[1:09:06] fought is in no man's
[1:09:14] land no man's land I'm going to call it
[1:09:19] the land of
[1:09:21] choice the land of
[1:09:24] choosing and brother bam
[1:09:26] did in the mind where decisions are made
[1:09:30] is that right in other words it can go
[1:09:33] either
[1:09:34] way it can go either way this battle
[1:09:37] that we're fighting is in a place called
[1:09:40] Choice amen and it's in the
[1:09:45] mind my my
[1:09:48] my that's right a mutual place no man's
[1:09:51] land and they fight there at this place
[1:09:54] they don't just fight here and there
[1:09:57] amen that's where the Battlefront is
[1:09:59] where they test their powers where each
[1:10:03] Army tests its strength against the
[1:10:05] other Army a
[1:10:08] mutual meeting place listen to what he
[1:10:11] says here this is kind of off the
[1:10:13] subject but listen to what it is if this
[1:10:15] church right now could be put together
[1:10:17] knit together with such love that every
[1:10:19] person would be in one Accord with not
[1:10:21] one shadow of a doubt nowhere there
[1:10:23] wouldn't be a feeble person in our mid
[1:10:25] in the next five five minutes there'll
[1:10:27] be nobody Desiring the Holy Ghost but
[1:10:29] would receive it if you could just get
[1:10:31] that certain thing fixed now there is
[1:10:33] where the battle begins right in your
[1:10:37] mind whether you
[1:10:42] will whether you

[1:13:22] senses and grab a hold of something amen
[1:13:25] how many knows now don't you can't grab
[1:13:27] things through your senses it has to

[1:13:55] and so
[1:13:57] forth how many knows that those are all
[1:13:59] channels and
[1:14:01] avenues that the Devil comes and works
[1:14:04] in that's
[1:14:06] right I don't know about you but
[1:14:09] sometimes I hate my
[1:14:11] feelings don't you hate the way you feel

[1:14:58] and every one of those things conscience
[1:15:00] memory reason
[1:15:03] affection my especially
[1:15:08] feeling I wrote down here that life is
[1:15:11] like a Mountain Railroad that song says
[1:15:13] there's ups and there's
[1:15:17] Downs there's Rivers there's valleys
[1:15:19] there's deserts you go to seem to go
[1:15:21] through Lord I'm supposed to be a
[1:15:23] Christian but I don't feel like I'm a
[1:15:25] Christian I don't feel like I got the
[1:15:27] Holy
[1:15:29] Ghost huh boy the devil will come right
[1:15:32] in there and try to get you to disbelief
[1:15:35] and if he can get you to disbelief he's
[1:15:37] got
[1:15:39] you
[1:15:41] woo Glory what I'm trying to say is all
[1:15:44] of those Avenues and channels these
[1:15:46] places where the devil tries to get
[1:15:50] in that's
[1:15:52] right he tries to get in as many times
[1:15:55] many places he can do it brother Braham
[1:15:58] talked about you know you let somebody
[1:16:00] hurt you a bruise first of all a bruise
[1:16:02] on the body he says in the natural and
[1:16:04] mean a lot of times a cancer will come
[1:16:06] from a bruise because those cells are
[1:16:08] bruised he says in the spirit so
[1:16:10] somebody does you
[1:16:13] wrong that's a good place for the devil
[1:16:15] to come in bitterness to come in hatred
[1:16:19] to come
[1:16:19] in torment to come in unforgiveness to
[1:16:24] come in
[1:16:26] and with that comes worry how many knows
[1:16:28] even worry is a terrible
[1:16:30] thing we're not made to worry and fret
[1:16:33] like my brother said BR cross Bridges
[1:16:35] before the bridges are ever built we
[1:16:37] built the bridges in our mind amen and
[1:16:41] guess what we never do get to that place
[1:16:43] it never does
[1:16:45] happen but worry and fret that's all
[1:16:48] things that the devil casts on
[1:16:52] us I wrote down here that from 1 to 12
[1:16:56] we go to different changes and I know
[1:16:58] don't know if you've ever watched on two
[1:17:00] YouTube where these people going in
[1:17:01] these
[1:17:03] slingshots right they'll go in these
[1:17:05] slingshots and in the chair and they're
[1:17:07] screaming oh no I can't do it and man
[1:17:10] they they get so freaked out when he
[1:17:12] goes up they they pass
[1:17:15] out they wake up and they pass
[1:17:19] out if they could just get in their mind
[1:17:23] they're not going to get hurt they're
[1:17:25] going to be all
[1:17:26] right but in their mind it's so
[1:17:29] catastrophic they want off of there get
[1:17:31] me off of
[1:17:34] there
[1:17:36] amen about about like the time I went
[1:17:38] off Pilot Rock me and my boys were
[1:17:41] younger and there was people repelling
[1:17:44] off that rock over there and we were
[1:17:46] saying yeah boy be nice we could do that
[1:17:49] sometime yeah we could do that sometime
[1:17:51] didn't you remember that Caleb now we
[1:17:53] went over there to him I asked asking me
[1:17:55] if I could do it boy they got on to me
[1:17:57] Dad don't you dare but I thought we
[1:17:59] wanted to do this they put the harness
[1:18:02] on me I come up back over there right
[1:18:03] over to the edge and just as I got back
[1:18:06] there I said is there any way to get
[1:18:08] back
[1:18:15] no cuz see when you get around this edge
[1:18:18] here the hardest part of the whole thing
[1:18:20] is going over this Edge cuz you got to
[1:18:22] use the power of all of your leg to go
[1:18:24] down over and then get your legs against
[1:18:26] the side once you're on the side you're
[1:18:27] just dangling but that transition is
[1:18:30] what's
[1:18:31] scary and people doing that bungee and
[1:18:34] all of that it mean it scares the liver
[1:18:36] out of them man others are over looking
[1:18:39] over don't bother them a
[1:18:41] bit they having the time of their life
[1:18:44] why because in their minds they're saved
[1:18:46] the others think it's a Calamity to pass
[1:18:48] out you know that's the way it is a lot
[1:18:50] of times with God he'll let you go
[1:18:51] through a great big mountains big
[1:18:53] changes in your life will freak you out
[1:18:56] people will pass out that
[1:19:00] right Bible says not to
[1:19:03] faint that we faint not why because we
[1:19:06] don't know sometimes God allows this to
[1:19:08] happen changes in our
[1:19:11] life are Avenues where the devil can
[1:19:13] come
