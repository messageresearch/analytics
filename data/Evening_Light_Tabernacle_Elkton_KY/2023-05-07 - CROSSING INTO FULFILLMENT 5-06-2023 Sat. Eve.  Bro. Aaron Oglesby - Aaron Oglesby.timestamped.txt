[33:37] half the tribe of Manassas aside they
[33:40] don't want to go in and the reason they
[33:43] don't want to go in is they see the land
[33:45] on this side of the Jordan and they say
[33:46] it is more suitable for cattle and we
[33:49] have cattle and if you do a little bit
[33:52] of research what you'll find is that
[33:53] accumulated these flocks in the journey
[33:56] so what I want to make a point we're
[33:57] here before we move on is listen we may
[33:59] accumulate a lot of things in the
[34:01] journey we may be blessed in a lot of
[34:03] ways here on this Earth but don't let
[34:05] that hinder you from crossing over don't
[34:07] let that stop you from going on into
[34:09] what you've been called to possess
[34:11] tonight you will understand amen so then
[34:14] we're going to look at one more place
[34:15] and it's just one scripture it's Matthew
[34:17] 1 22 and it says this
[34:20] now all of this was done that it might
[34:24] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[34:27] Lord by the prophet saying now I know
[34:31] that seems like an odd place to stop so
[34:33] saying what but but the point of that is
[34:36] a phrase right there in the middle of
[34:37] the verse there in Matthew and it's and
[34:39] it really strikes me and it says that it
[34:42] might be fulfilled
[34:45] that it might be fulfilled it says this
[34:47] phrase 11 times in the Bible in
[34:49] reference to events taking place and um
[34:52] whether it be Kings rising up or very
[34:54] specific things happening on the cross
[34:56] or Joseph and Mary going down to Egypt
[34:59] it's a phrase that says all of this
[35:02] happened that it might be fulfilled in
[35:05] other words no matter what God's word is
[35:07] going to be fulfilled this circumstance
[35:10] and this circumstance and this
[35:11] circumstance all of those things were
[35:13] happening leading to a fulfillment of
[35:15] God's word don't let it get out get you
[35:17] out of cater today God's word is going
[35:20] to be fulfilled amen you believe that
[35:22] and that's what we're going to preach to
[35:24] you a bit tonight Crossing into
[35:26] fulfillment Crossing into fulfillment
[35:29] because nothing is out of God's hand
[35:30] tonight nothing is out of hater nothing
[35:33] is out of order brother Bradham said God
[35:35] spoke it it's got to be so that
[35:39] settled in heaven forever it's already
[35:42] said he says they don't argue about it
[35:45] up there amen it's already settled we
[35:48] argue about it but in glory it's settled
[35:51] When God says anything it's got to be
[35:53] well is it that wonderful hey man I'm
[35:56] thankful tonight that he's not a Fickle
[35:58] God that thinks this way one day and
[36:00] this way another and he said by my
[36:02] stripes you're healed that still stands
[36:04] tonight if he says that the promise is
[36:06] unto you and to your children and as
[36:08] many as the Lord Our God should call
[36:10] that still stands yes
[36:13] tonight and forever
[36:15] amen we know that that fulfillment
[36:19] brings faith in other words the more
[36:21] things you see fulfilled it builds your
[36:23] faith up when when you see by my stripes
[36:26] you are healed fulfilled in somebody's
[36:28] life it gives you Faith to believe it
[36:31] for your life when you see that the
[36:33] promise is unto you under your children
[36:35] you see someone's child receive the
[36:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost it builds up
[36:39] Faith to hold on for your children when
[36:42] we see fulfillment it builds up Faith
[36:46] amen it elevates our faith to believe
[36:48] for more not only in the sense of
[36:52] believing for things like like healing
[36:54] and victory but but but looking
[36:57] at world events through a different lens
[37:02] looking at world events through the word
[37:04] and looking through faith in his word it
[37:07] will completely stabilize you as a
[37:10] Christian
[37:10] if we'll take what's going on around us
[37:13] and look at it through the word tonight
[37:14] it'll bring it'll bring a stabilization
[37:17] people get so shook up and so shook by
[37:20] the things going on in the world they
[37:22] get so shook up by Russia or so shook up
[37:25] by the economy or so shook up by the
[37:27] evil of the politics all around us so
[37:30] shook up by the Sodom condition and then
[37:33] I want to ask like what is it that you
[37:34] were expecting I look at those things
[37:37] and I say it's exactly what the prophet
[37:39] said was going to be it's exactly what
[37:41] the word said it was gonna be it was
[37:43] foretold right here in the Bible it
[37:45] shouldn't Shake us it should make us
[37:46] recognize it's been fulfilled and if
[37:49] that's being fulfilled then there's a
[37:51] bride on the Earth today that part's
[37:53] gonna be fulfilled don't let it shake
[37:55] you make it let you look up and say I
[37:58] know that my Redemption draweth now
[38:01] don't let these things shake you
[38:04] look at them through the word tonight
[38:06] and you see something and it may be evil
[38:08] but you go yep knew that was coming
[38:10] yeah I didn't know that was coming that
[38:12] didn't shake me that just confirmed to
[38:14] me once again that this message is the
[38:16] truth hallelujah the word foretold it
[38:20] listen even for us as Believers the end
[38:22] times aren't going to be Rosy
[38:26] end times aren't going to be easy
[38:28] but we don't have to be scared of them
[38:30] we don't have to be worried about it
[38:32] because I'm looking for their
[38:34] fulfillment so when I see these horrible
[38:37] events I can take them and place them in
[38:39] their proper place I can place them
[38:42] where they're supposed to be what is it
[38:44] what does that event mean brother Aaron
[38:46] what's it mean Russia's doing this and
[38:48] the Sodom conditioning in this lgbtq and
[38:51] then what what does it all mean it means
[38:53] I'm one step closer to going home it
[38:55] means I'm one step closer to getting out
[38:57] of here it doesn't shake doesn't ground
[39:00] to say it's happening in church we're
[39:02] right there at the crossing over
[39:05] Hallelujah someone is going to cross
[39:07] into fulfillment in this day
[39:10] the world has to be in an end time
[39:12] condition
[39:14] we thought a few years ago where 10
[39:16] years ago we're 20 years ago however
[39:18] long you've been following this and man
[39:20] and I believe in Christian that we just
[39:23] we thought we knew how evil it was going
[39:25] to get
[39:27] yeah 20 years ago we thought it was
[39:30] going to get evil but I don't think I
[39:32] didn't see how quick it would happen
[39:36] y'all was telling somebody the other day
[39:38] I said when I was a kid we had a
[39:39] president by the name of Bill Clinton
[39:42] who at the time was considered the
[39:45] liberal of liberals
[39:46] it didn't get no more liberal than Bill
[39:49] Clinton and Bill Clinton's time the
[39:51] Defense of Marriage Act that said
[39:53] marriage had to be between them
[39:55] a man and a woman
[39:58] and he was the most liberal president
[39:59] we'd ever had
[40:01] that guy would be like a right-wing
[40:03] conservative nut now
[40:06] do you realize how far things have come
[40:08] just in the last 10 or 15 years if we're
[40:11] here another 10 or 15 years oh God help
[40:13] us but you know what if we are that's
[40:15] okay because you said I'll never leave
[40:17] you I'll never forsake you I'll be with
[40:19] you and I'll be in you even till the end
[40:22] of the world we're still here so so is
[40:25] he he's still fighting for us he's still
[40:27] going before us he's still safe and he's
[40:30] still healing he's still delivering he's
[40:32] still making a way through the
[40:33] Wilderness we have not been left alone
[40:36] church but he's gonna make sure somebody
[40:38] crosses into fulfillment Hallelujah
[40:42] brother Brown says look at all the
[40:44] televisions and things getting these
[40:46] fictitious things in order it'll come a
[40:49] time
[40:50] I predict that people will be completely
[40:52] totally insane the world will be
[40:56] fulfilled
[40:57] [Applause]
[41:00] he says the Bible speaks of such hideous
[41:02] sights as they show in movies today of
[41:05] some prehistoric creatures eggs that
[41:07] lived in the Earth for so many thousands
[41:09] and millions of years hatch and come
[41:11] forth he said that's just a minor thing
[41:13] that's what's going to happen
[41:15] and when hell is open and the Devil
[41:18] comes out with all these mysterious
[41:19] things locusts with hair like women
[41:22] teeth like lines while the world will be
[41:24] completely and totally insane it's not
[41:28] just but about one degree from it now
[41:32] that was in 1965.
[41:36] I'm afraid sometimes we become too
[41:38] conditioned to our surroundings
[41:41] because we'll look back to 1965 and go
[41:44] man I wish it could be like it was then
[41:47] and he looked at and said it's insane
[41:49] now
[41:50] we get two conditions sometimes
[41:53] we get two conditions but listen it's
[41:55] not a message of Doom and Gloom brother
[41:57] Brown would say to us he said too many
[41:59] times we point to how evil the world is
[42:01] getting he said and we're failing to see
[42:03] all the time how powerful the church is
[42:06] getting at the same time listen if
[42:07] there's a world in the end time
[42:09] condition if the tree of knowledge has
[42:11] reached its apex if there's a people
[42:13] sitting there ready to be Atomic fodder
[42:15] then there's got to be a people on the
[42:17] Earth a bride of Jesus Christ in the end
[42:20] time condition ready for a Rapture Ready
[42:22] for a body change ready to cross into
[42:25] fulfillment it's not just them in an end
[42:27] time condition you are in the end time
[42:30] condition I am in an intight condition
[42:32] oh but what about the anointed ones at
[42:34] the end time that's me
[42:37] it's not just a falsely anointed ones at
[42:40] the end time but what about the true
[42:42] anointed ones at the end time anointed
[42:44] to take a body change in this day
[42:46] Hallelujah
[42:52] but we look too many times through
[42:53] Earthly eyes
[42:55] oh I see this one struggling
[42:57] I see that one falling away I see this
[42:59] church splitting that one preaching
[43:01] false and and I see this one attacking
[43:04] this one you're looking at the Through
[43:05] The Eyes of circumstance
[43:08] who look at Through The Eyes of
[43:09] circumstances look through the eyes of
[43:11] the one that said I will have a church
[43:14] without spot or wrinkle I say it all the
[43:17] time but I look at that scripture and I
[43:19] go brother brother I'd mess that
[43:21] scripture up by myself
[43:25] but guess what it's not up to me to
[43:27] fulfill it it's not up to me to make it
[43:29] come to pass he said I'll have a church
[43:31] he said I'll have a bride he said
[43:33] there'd be a Rapture it's up to him to
[43:35] keep his word all I gotta do is trust in
[43:38] it tonight believe in it tonight it's
[43:40] his word it's his promise you're his
[43:43] people he's gonna bring it to pass in
[43:46] this day hallelujah
[43:48] hallelujah I didn't make the promise
[43:52] I didn't say it he made the promise
[43:56] he made the promise and someone is going
[43:58] to fulfill it
[43:59] too many times we look at these events
[44:02] and we want to see the Fulfillment of
[44:05] them
[44:05] but they're not characterless events
[44:09] in other words it's not just an event
[44:12] someone
[44:15] has to fulfill it someone it's not a
[44:19] kiss not just an event it's an event
[44:21] with a people
[44:23] for the event
[44:24] it's not a characterless event
[44:27] somebody's got to do it
[44:29] somebody's got to look away from
[44:30] circumstance
[44:32] Abraham looked away from circumstance
[44:34] and he looked away from his body now
[44:36] dead and he began to look to fulfillment
[44:39] there had been a word given Abraham and
[44:41] he knew this will be fulfilled
[44:44] because he looked at it through the
[44:45] promises of God let's take our eyes off
[44:48] the circumstances of the world tonight
[44:49] and bring them back to the word of God
[44:52] let the word be your filter
[44:55] don't don't allow yourself to to miss
[44:57] God because we view him through our
[45:00] circumstances
[45:01] don't allow ourselves to miss God
[45:03] because we look at him through hours of
[45:05] Flesh you know brother Branham says and
[45:06] I'm not quoting here you can go find it
[45:09] though he says that that Sarah was in a
[45:11] foul mood that day
[45:13] he said she was really in a bad mood but
[45:15] listen he was determined that she's the
[45:18] one that's going to bring forth the
[45:19] promise son and I don't care how bad a
[45:21] moose she is I'm not gonna let her miss
[45:23] it and he's telling you tonight you may
[45:25] have had a bad day you may have had a
[45:27] bad week you may have
[45:29] had a bad month but who is it that's
[45:31] gonna bring the promise son back to this
[45:33] Earth this Brown's gonna do it and he
[45:35] says I'm not gonna let you miss it but I
[45:38] have come down Hallelujah to wake you
[45:41] from your doldrums to pull you from your
[45:43] bad mood to pull your eyes back to the
[45:45] promises tonight
[45:49] brother Brown says if we don't watch
[45:51] Friends the church is going to fail to
[45:53] see it
[45:54] let's not look he said let's not look
[45:57] for church hairdos and new dresses let's
[46:00] look for the Holy Spirit to come in the
[46:02] Supernatural and raise some things
[46:05] he says the church don't need a facelift
[46:07] it needs a verse the Holy Ghost to come
[46:09] into the church and bring back people
[46:11] that believes in the Supernatural and
[46:14] holds on waiting for the coming of the
[46:16] Lord
[46:18] Hallelujah
[46:25] because many times God is in things and
[46:28] we fail to see it
[46:29] because of the eyes we're looking
[46:31] through
[46:32] you know we look through herd eyes
[46:34] sometimes
[46:36] we look through scored eyes
[46:39] we look through eyes with complexes
[46:43] come on we we look through eyes of doubt
[46:47] eyes of fear
[46:49] you know and sometimes let's be honest
[46:50] sometimes it's just tired eyes
[46:53] you ever try to read something late at
[46:54] night
[46:56] y'all just keep you're just tired
[46:58] it's hard to focus look I understand
[47:01] I understand the battle's hard we get
[47:03] worn down we get tired but they that
[47:06] wait
[47:07] they that wait upon the Lord maybe
[47:09] you're in a waiting period maybe you're
[47:11] wondering when's it gonna happen when's
[47:12] my turn Lord I've been struggling I'm
[47:14] like listen don't waste the waiting
[47:16] don't waste the waiting the waiting is
[47:18] for a purpose in your waiting talk
[47:20] holster in your waiting seek God in your
[47:23] way and get ditches in the valley I'm
[47:25] telling you there's water in your Valley
[47:27] there's blessings in your Valley your
[47:29] strength's gonna be renewed your
[47:30] blessings are going to be poured out but
[47:32] in the waiting don't waste the waiting
[47:34] but seek God like never before
[47:37] Hallelujah we look through the wrong
[47:40] guys
[47:41] but tonight let's begin looking with the
[47:43] eyes of I know it's going to be
[47:44] fulfilled I don't know when but I know I
[47:47] know it's going to be fulfilled and as
[47:49] the Royal seat of it
[47:51] Abraham it's going to be fulfilled in
[47:53] who it's going to be fulfilled in me
[47:56] quit putting it off on others Sarah
[47:58] because it's not it's not the slave
[48:00] girl's job to bring forth the promise
[48:01] son quit pushing it down the road on
[48:03] somebody else they can be blessed they
[48:05] can have the Holy Ghost their kids can
[48:07] come back these blessings these promises
[48:09] this Rapture it's for you Sarah it's
[48:13] yours tonight Sarah look who has a faith
[48:15] it's my Rapture it's my promise it's my
[48:19] Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[48:21] Hallelujah
[48:23] we got to start looking at these
[48:24] situations in our lives as opportunities
[48:26] for fulfillment
[48:29] come on we don't welcome trials I'm not
[48:32] like another one yes
[48:37] but when it comes it's the opportunity
[48:39] that Wayward son's an opportunity for
[48:41] you to kill the fatted calf
[48:44] sickness is an opportunity for you to
[48:46] experience healing and for this Satan
[48:48] Satan that's attachable body to be cast
[48:50] down no
[48:52] I don't want to be sick but when that
[48:54] comes my way this is my opportunity for
[48:56] God to rise up in my life for God to
[48:59] rise up and for his enemies to be
[49:00] shattered it's my opportunity to face a
[49:02] Goliath in my life
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:05] I'll never forget when I found out
[49:07] brother Ron Spencer had cancer and I
[49:08] just texted him a little thing Tim I was
[49:10] praying for him
[49:12] and he writes back and he says
[49:14] Goliath has showed up
[49:16] so now we fight
[49:20] come on now those are those 20 people
[49:22] hiding in the tents there's plenty of
[49:24] people like Saul I don't want to come
[49:25] into the valley but when Goliath shows
[49:28] up for your promise when Goliath shows
[49:30] up for your children when Goliath shows
[49:32] up for your health
[49:33] it's time to go down in the valley and
[49:36] say this is my land these are my
[49:38] children these are my promises and I'm
[49:40] here to take them back get off my land
[49:43] get out of my Valley Hallelujah Goliath
[49:46] shows up it's time we fight Hallelujah
[49:54] we got a good looking at it just as I
[49:56] want to see it fulfilled but I want to
[49:59] fulfill

[52:32] him put a thousand demons ten thousand
[52:34] demons a million demons let's come out
[52:36] of the river Euphrates it's time and
[52:38] when the time is here nothing or nobody
[52:41] or no devil in hell can stop it
[52:44] it's time for fulfillment
[52:49] [Music]
[52:51] looking here at the beginning Genesis 3
[52:53] and 3.
[52:54] and we are going to read
[52:56] a lot of scriptures tonight so just bear
[52:57] with me
[53:01] he says put up the fruit of the tree
[53:03] which is in the midst of the garden
[53:06] God has said You shall not eat of it
[53:08] neither shall you touch it lest ye die
[53:11] and the serpent said unto the woman
[53:13] you shall not
[53:16] surely die
[53:18] no notice
[53:20] the attack here is actually on
[53:22] fulfillment
[53:24] that the word wouldn't be fulfilled the
[53:26] way God said it would be fulfilled
[53:30] the attack here is that it is possible
[53:32] for one word not to be fulfilled
[53:36] or for one word to fail
[53:38] because if one word can fail then what
[53:40] about this word
[53:42] and if this word can contradict this
[53:44] word then what about this one over here
[53:46] and pretty soon it becomes a very
[53:48] slippery slope
[53:50] and then you have nowhere to stand
[53:52] because well this one failed and I don't
[53:54] know if this is true and this and then
[53:55] all of a sudden your anchors not holding
[53:57] anymore amen hey man you have no place
[54:00] to rest but brother Brown says to the
[54:01] believer if God said it that settles it
[54:05] see there is your resting place
[54:09] listen you can hang your soul on every
[54:11] word of God tonight
[54:13] every word of God you can hang your soul
[54:16] that it's going to be fulfilled you
[54:17] believe that tonight amen Jeremiah 1 and
[54:20] 12 then said the Lord unto me thou Hast
[54:23] well seen for I will hasten my word to
[54:27] perform it
[54:28] now I'm gonna go through these next
[54:29] scriptures quickly so you may not have
[54:31] the opportunity to turn with me if you
[54:32] want to try that's fine but it's just a
[54:34] few examples to drive this point home
[54:36] about When God Says something
[54:38] he brings it to pass
[54:41] Matthew 2 15.
[54:44] and was there until the death of Herod
[54:46] that it might be fulfilled which was
[54:49] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[54:51] out of Egypt have I called my son
[54:53] Matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in a
[54:57] city called Nazareth that it might be
[54:59] fulfilled which is spoken by the
[55:01] prophets he shall be called a Nazarene
[55:04] Matthew 8 16.
[55:07] when the evening would come they brought
[55:08] onto him many that were possessed with
[55:10] devils and he cast out the spirits with
[55:12] his word and healed all that were sick
[55:14] that it might be fulfilled which was
[55:16] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[55:18] himself took our infirmities and bear
[55:20] our sickness
[55:22] listen this here Micah 5-2 but thou
[55:26] Bethlehem you freighter though thou be
[55:29] little among the thousands of Judah
[55:31] [Music]
[55:33] that is to be ruler in Israel who's
[55:35] going forth have
[55:37] from Everlasting now we're going to jump
[55:39] all the way over into the New Testament
[55:41] here in Luke 2. and it came to pass in
[55:43] those days that there went out of decree
[55:45] from Caesar Augustus that all the world
[55:47] should be taxed
[55:49] can you imagine the griping that went on
[55:52] I can't because I'd have been one of
[55:54] them
[55:56] yeah
[55:57] they're always just trying to get our
[55:59] money they're taxing us here they're
[56:00] taxing us there they're going to make a
[56:01] cashless Society they're going to do
[56:03] this they're going to make it and the
[56:05] whole time God's going calm down
[56:08] I got this
[56:11] I'm doing this for a purpose
[56:16] down to verse three Luke two and three
[56:18] and it all went to be taxed everyone
[56:20] into his own City and Joseph also went
[56:23] up From Galilee out of the city of
[56:25] Nazareth into Judea under the city of
[56:27] David
[56:28] him because he was at the house of the
[56:30] lineage of Maven to be taxed with Mary
[56:32] his espoused wife being great with child
[56:35] why the taxation of an entire nation why
[56:39] the hardship
[56:40] because he had to be born in Bethlehem
[56:43] no matter what God's gonna make sure his
[56:46] word is fulfilled
[56:49] brother Brown says another thing we want
[56:51] to know this is just at the very time
[56:52] that he had to raise taxes on the people
[56:55] and in doing that it forced Joseph and
[56:58] his wife to be or he says as a spouse
[57:00] wife married be forced back into
[57:02] Bethlehem God knows how to do things
[57:06] come on somebody God knows how to do
[57:09] things where are you standing at tonight
[57:11] what is your situation
[57:14] what are you facing God knows how to do
[57:17] things let me give you a testimony real
[57:19] quick this is off off course for a
[57:21] minute but I just feel to testify

[57:30] y'all for a minute I feel comfortable
[57:31] here

[57:53] by the time I was 19 my parents my dad
[57:56] divorced my mom
[57:59] a few years later by the grace of God
[58:02] got a hold of my Dad's life and brought
[58:04] him back to the Lord so for the next 20
[58:06] years this wasn't awkward at all my dad
[58:10] said on that side of the church and my
[58:11] mom sat on that side of the church
[58:20] and dad started to
[58:23] to hate it
[58:26] he'd come to me he's on my porch and
[58:28] he'd say son talk to me I know God hates
[58:30] divorce
[58:31] I know God hates divorce I want to fix

[58:36] don't want to go meet God with this
[58:37] hanging over me what do I do and I would
[58:39] just be honest with him I said Dad
[58:42] if you've made it right in your heart
[58:45] the only way it can get fixed like here
[58:47] is if she's got a warrant fixed too
[58:52] I've got to work on both ends
[58:54] let me admit something to y'all
[58:57] I say this in shame you don't know how
[59:00] impossible this was
[59:03] to the point that I didn't even pray for

[59:11] so I just had I just know I forgot about
[59:13] it because I didn't forget about it I'd

[59:50] would get sick for some reason mom would
[59:52] go see him and bring him stuff and
[59:54] they treated each other cordially enough
[59:56] you know what I'm saying but but she was
[59:57] sitting on the bed holding his hand now
[1:00:00] that was different

[1:00:44] don't look at something that's hopeless
[1:00:48] God can still do it
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:00:54] Psalms 22 18 they parked my garments
[1:00:57] among them and cast lots upon my best
[1:00:59] Year Matthew 27 35 and they crucified
[1:01:02] him and parted his garments casting lots
[1:01:04] that it might be
[1:01:05] fulfilled
[1:01:07] which was spoken by the prophet they
[1:01:09] parted my garments among them and upon
[1:01:11] my master did they cast lots what are we
[1:01:13] reading these four just a reminder that
[1:01:15] God knows what he's doing
[1:01:17] God knows what he's doing tonight
[1:01:19] circumstances are not in control
[1:01:22] every scripture every word everything he
[1:01:24] ever spoke about you and about this
[1:01:25] bride is going to come to pass
[1:01:27] but you got to keep your eyes on that
[1:01:29] because somebody
[1:01:31] is going to fulfill it Others May stop
[1:01:33] short Others May find a good place to
[1:01:36] stop like Reuben and Gad did
[1:01:38] but somebody's going to cross over
[1:01:40] somebody's going to go all the way back
[1:01:42] into fulfillment listen Malachi 4 was
[1:01:44] sent to turn us back to the faith
[1:01:47] back to the original it didn't turn us
[1:01:49] to go halfway back
[1:01:51] it in turn us to give us some correct
[1:01:52] doctor come on now it turned us to go
[1:01:55] all the way back you can trace it back
[1:01:58] to the book of Acts you can trace it
[1:02:00] back into the upper room listen God
[1:02:02] started his church the way he wanted it
[1:02:04] and now he wants his church the way he
[1:02:07] started it back to the original not
[1:02:09] halfway back not cold and dead and dry
[1:02:13] and formal but he wants a church alive
[1:02:15] spring it up on the inside Hallelujah he
[1:02:19] called us to go oh
[1:02:22] the way back
[1:02:24] somebody's gonna go
[1:02:26] somebody's gonna go
[1:02:30] back to the works that I do shall you do
[1:02:33] also
[1:02:34] somebody's gonna fulfill that
[1:02:36] somebody's gonna overcome my Odyssey
[1:02:39] somebody's gonna take it go back and
[1:02:41] take the land of the Holy Ghost take the
[1:02:44] land it's her you're taken
[1:02:48] the words already said it was going to
[1:02:50] be fulfilled I say it might as well be
[1:02:52] us somebody's gonna do it who it might
[1:02:55] as well be me and
[1:02:57] it'll be you
[1:02:58] take your position tonight take the land
[1:03:00] that God's called you to take
[1:03:08] we know that God had told Abraham in
[1:03:09] Genesis
[1:03:11] 15 and 13.
[1:03:15] that his seed would be a stranger in the
[1:03:17] land and
[1:03:18] be afflicted 400 years
[1:03:21] and we know that was fulfilled
[1:03:24] and then in verse 14 God tells Abraham
[1:03:26] that the nation that does this to them
[1:03:29] is going to be judged
[1:03:31] and then God comes and he fulfills that
[1:03:33] we know the plagues just begin to fall
[1:03:35] out as he begins to judge
[1:03:38] the second part of verse 14 says
[1:03:41] and afterwards shall they come out
[1:03:44] great substance
[1:03:50] this was also repeated to Moses in
[1:03:52] Exodus 3 21 and I will give this people
[1:03:55] favor in the sight of the Egyptians and
[1:03:56] it shall come to pass that when you go
[1:03:58] you shall not go empty
[1:04:01] now you know sometimes we look at things
[1:04:04] and we look at situations and we say
[1:04:07] how Lord
[1:04:09] you're not that I'm not I know you got
[1:04:11] but how
[1:04:13] right right you're married didn't ask
[1:04:14] that in doubt she just said how will
[1:04:16] these things be in other words I believe
[1:04:17] you you mind sharing with me how we're
[1:04:19] gonna do this
[1:04:22] sometimes we say how
[1:04:24] if you was one of the slaves who had
[1:04:26] been there with absolutely nothing
[1:04:29] who had everything you ever known
[1:04:31] Stripped Away from you from Generations
[1:04:33] after Generations you've been beaten
[1:04:35] you've been told you were worthless
[1:04:37] you've been told you can't fulfill the
[1:04:39] promise you've been told that you can't
[1:04:40] leave you might have looked at the same
[1:04:43] promise and went
[1:04:44] you know slaves and great substance
[1:04:47] don't exactly go hand in hand
[1:04:50] how is this going to be
[1:04:52] how is this going to be but tonight I
[1:04:55] want us to never forget how quickly

[1:05:02] moment all it takes is one moment in the
[1:05:04] presence of God all it takes is One
[1:05:06] Moment In His presence for everything to

[1:11:11] the Egyptians
[1:11:13] tried to sue the Jews in the 4th Century
[1:11:16] in the court of Alexander
[1:11:20] demanding that the Jews pay restitution
[1:11:23] for all the Egyptian gold and silver
[1:11:25] that they took along with them when they
[1:11:27] left in The Exodus
[1:11:31] says gavia
[1:11:34] the son of
[1:11:35] Pacifica a simple but wise Jew who
[1:11:38] requested the Sage's permission to
[1:11:42] present a defense on behalf of the Jews
[1:11:45] all right if he asked the Egyptians for
[1:11:48] evidence
[1:11:48] demo devil
[1:11:50] that the Jews absconded with their
[1:11:53] wealth the crime they said is clearly
[1:11:57] recorded in your Torah the Egyptians
[1:12:00] gleefully responded
[1:12:03] in that case kevia said the Torah also
[1:12:05] says that 600
[1:12:08] 000 Jews were unjustly enslaved by the
[1:12:11] Egyptians for many many years let's
[1:12:14] calculate how much you owe us
[1:12:17] [Applause]
[1:12:20] the Egyptian asked for three days in
[1:12:22] which they could come back and with a
[1:12:24] counter uh response and what they use
[1:12:26] those three days for was the high tell
[1:12:28] it out of town because they knew it was
[1:12:30] the truth he says you've done this and
[1:12:32] you've sinned and this is the true
[1:12:34] listen oh come on now come on now listen
[1:12:37] he likes to stack the facts up against
[1:12:38] you we're gonna go there for a minute
[1:12:40] and he likes to tell you listen listen
[1:12:42] the facts don't always represent the
[1:12:44] truth the fact is I was a sinner
[1:12:47] because I did a lot of things that
[1:12:48] should have sent me straight to Hell the
[1:12:50] fact is I was no good I was nobody I was
[1:12:53] from a broken home I backslit on God
[1:12:56] those are all the facts but the truth is
[1:12:59] he said I could go free the truth is it
[1:13:02] came and sacrificed his body and I could
[1:13:05] live eternally the truth is tonight
[1:13:07] regardless of what the facts say you're
[1:13:10] healed you're free you're delivered in
[1:13:13] the name of Jesus that is the true
[1:13:16] tonight in the house of God
[1:13:21] we don't owe the devil one thing
[1:13:25] I gotta try to gear down them and I got
[1:13:27] two more foreign
[1:13:36] they came out blessed
[1:13:38] they came out Victorious
[1:13:41] and all along the word was being
[1:13:42] fulfilled
[1:13:45] every step of the way they were walking
[1:13:47] in fulfillment
[1:13:49] yes there was a great stumble at kadish
[1:13:51] we know that
[1:13:52] but that didn't stop the word from being
[1:13:54] fulfilled
[1:13:56] God had to use a different generation
[1:13:58] but he still fulfilled it with Seed of
[1:14:00] Abraham
[1:14:01] it didn't stop the word from being
[1:14:03] fulfilled God was going to have the Seed
[1:14:06] of Abraham possess the land
[1:14:09] seated Abraham
[1:14:11] he's going to have seated Abraham
[1:14:12] possess the land
[1:14:15] Genesis 15 18 says in the same day the
[1:14:18] Lord made a covenant with Abram saying
[1:14:21] unto that said
[1:14:22] have I given this land
[1:14:24] from the river of Egypt under the Great
[1:14:26] River of the river Euphrates
[1:14:28] this was going to be fulfilled it didn't
[1:14:30] matter how many times man messed up
[1:14:34] look at our mess up
[1:14:36] don't hinder the Fulfillment
[1:14:40] I understand that your name was on the
[1:14:43] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:14:45] foundation of the world you're gonna be
[1:14:48] there he may have to you may have to go
[1:14:50] through some stuff because we can be
[1:14:52] we're pretty ignorant sometimes
[1:14:54] but God don't go
[1:14:57] I knew I should have picked him
[1:14:59] look at that and the devil's going I
[1:15:01] told you
[1:15:02] I told you he was not how it works
[1:15:04] that's how it works the devil goes look
[1:15:06] look how much he messed up look at that
[1:15:09] stone look at that failure and God's
[1:15:10] going
[1:15:12] can't see through the blood I don't even
[1:15:14] know what you're talking about I can't
[1:15:16] see his message I can't see his stuff
[1:15:18] but what are you what are you even
[1:15:19] talking about he doesn't change his mind
[1:15:21] he's not going to get to the marriage
[1:15:23] supper and go I had one too many plates
[1:15:25] out
[1:15:29] oh he's gonna get you there
[1:15:31] you've been called to it you've been
[1:15:33] called for it you're gonna get there
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:40] take our eyes away just for a moment
[1:15:42] from the children of Israel
[1:15:43] but following the same type
[1:15:46] God once again had a people
[1:15:48] Royal Seed of Abraham that down through
[1:15:51] the church ages had become enslaved
[1:15:55] they become slaves to a Catholic system
[1:15:57] that held them down with kriegs and
[1:16:00] dogma's a man
[1:16:01] it held them the way they held the
[1:16:04] people was by withholding the word from
[1:16:06] them
[1:16:08] so they held the People by withholding
[1:16:10] the word but but God began to move and
[1:16:12] Luther comes on the scene and the
[1:16:14] Reformation begins
[1:16:15] and it wasn't a Reformation just for the
[1:16:17] sake of reformation
[1:16:19] it wasn't just to do it just to say oh
[1:16:21] we reformed the church but it was a
[1:16:23] Reformation to start a journey
[1:16:26] it was a Reformation to start the
[1:16:28] journey to return back to the original
[1:16:31] and brother Brown says it comes back to
[1:16:32] the original grain is that right
[1:16:34] and his ministry comes from them
[1:16:37] reformations back to the original word
[1:16:39] again the word comes to a prophet and he
[1:16:42] promised it Malachi 4 and to restore the
[1:16:45] faith of the people back to the original
[1:16:46] grain what went in the ground is here
[1:16:51] the same listen somebody's going all the
[1:16:54] way back to the original somebody's not
[1:16:56] gonna be just something different
[1:16:58] they're gonna go all the way back
[1:16:59] they're not going to stop short of
[1:17:01] people that's going to come to the river
[1:17:02] and the water don't scare them on they
[1:17:04] say I like the water I'm getting in the
[1:17:06] water I will listen let the water
[1:17:07] cleanse you come on through to the other
[1:17:09] side cross on over to the other side
[1:17:12] tonight you may have come a long way and
[1:17:15] I'm proud of that I'm thankful for that
[1:17:17] but I'm telling you come on across into
[1:17:19] fulfillment you don't gotta stay on that
[1:17:22] side of the river
[1:17:23] [Applause]
[1:17:24] Joel 2 25 and I will restore to you the
[1:17:28] years that the Locust has eaten the
[1:17:29] canker worm and the caterpillar and the
[1:17:31] Palmer worm my great Army which I said
[1:17:33] among you and you shall eat in plenty
[1:17:35] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[1:17:37] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[1:17:39] wondrously with you and my people
[1:17:41] shall never be ashamed
[1:17:44] there's going to be a people restored
[1:17:46] back to what it was before the Locust
[1:17:49] but before the canker worm before the
[1:17:51] the caterpillar before the Palmer worm
[1:17:53] or let's just put it like this in a
[1:17:54] historical sense before the Nicene
[1:17:57] Council
[1:17:58] before the church began to Fall Away
[1:18:01] back to that place somebody's going to
[1:18:03] be willing to cross back over to listen
[1:18:05] let's go ahead and say it or in some
[1:18:06] places it's a dirty word but I feel
[1:18:08] freedom here somebody's going back to
[1:18:10] original Pentecost
[1:18:12] somebody's going all the way back listen
[1:18:14] the fact that a denomination came and
[1:18:17] robbed the name Pentecost don't scare me
[1:18:19] none that don't scare me not I know what
[1:18:21] Pentecost is it's not a denomination
[1:18:23] it's an experience it's the outpouring
[1:18:26] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:18:28] want it tonight you can call me a Holy
[1:18:31] Roller you can call me a fanatic you can
[1:18:33] call me what you want but you're gonna
[1:18:35] have to call me an original because I'm
[1:18:38] going back oh I'm not a same to my
[1:18:41] family I'm not ashamed of my Kinfolk
[1:18:43] Paul and Peter and Stephen those are my
[1:18:46] people
[1:18:48] and I'm going back to that Hallelujah
[1:18:51] back to the grain again
[1:18:53] because it's only in that place that we
[1:18:55] can fulfill what God has called us to
[1:18:58] fulfill in this day
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:01] Reuben
[1:19:04] and God and half the tribe of Manassas
[1:19:07] stopped short of crossing over
[1:19:09] but this is crossing over time
[1:19:12] today is the day we can't stop sure we
[1:19:14] can't perpetuate the ages
[1:19:16] you know
[1:19:19] it didn't matter on any other day
[1:19:23] that Reuben and Gad and half the tribe
[1:19:25] of Manasseh didn't cross the river
[1:19:26] because it wasn't crossing over day
[1:19:29] it didn't matter
[1:19:30] they was just doing what their boss was
[1:19:32] doing that's a long for the journey they
[1:19:33] was following the pillar of Fire they'd
[1:19:35] been called out by a message
[1:19:40] too many people fall in love with and
[1:19:42] you should don't get me wrong anything I
[1:19:44] say don't think I'm knocking it I'm just
[1:19:45] telling you there's more for you
[1:19:47] too many people fall in love with the
[1:19:49] calling out portion
[1:19:51] but the same message that called you out
[1:19:53] takes you in it doesn't call you out to
[1:19:57] leave you it calls you out to take you
[1:19:59] in
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:01] listen let me make a little point right
[1:20:03] here and I know we're we're running on
[1:20:06] time
[1:20:07] but you know you could have went out
[1:20:08] there and followed the message to a T
[1:20:10] and put Blood on the doorpost and on the
[1:20:12] matter
[1:20:13] and the Death Angel passing what a
[1:20:15] victory that was what a thing to
[1:20:17] celebrate what a place
[1:20:19] but the very next day as Israel left
[1:20:22] if you were sitting on your front porch
[1:20:24] underneath that blood going what are
[1:20:26] y'all doing
[1:20:28] you bunch of fanatics
[1:20:30] the prophet said put Blood on the
[1:20:32] doorpost
[1:20:33] the problem I'm gonna stick with what
[1:20:36] the prophet said
[1:20:37] you realize how many people have been
[1:20:39] snared by a truth
[1:20:43] it's exactly what happened to the
[1:20:45] denominations they got a truth and they
[1:20:47] wouldn't move from it
[1:20:48] it was true that you had to put Blood on
[1:20:51] the door post but it is also true that
[1:20:53] you better go
[1:20:55] and it would listen let me tell you what
[1:20:56] what a place to be when the Red Sea
[1:20:58] opened and your enemies were drowned but
[1:21:00] if you're still there six days later
[1:21:02] dancing on the banks of the Red Sea you
[1:21:04] just left behind
[1:21:05] too many of us are stuck at the last
[1:21:08] place we had a great Victory I said come
[1:21:10] on come on it's time for some more
[1:21:12] Victory it's time for some more wins
[1:21:15] it's time to take some more land move
[1:21:17] over where you were I'm not seeing a new
[1:21:20] message it was the same message but the
[1:21:22] pillar of fire was leading them that
[1:21:25] meant they were going somewhere we gotta
[1:21:28] cross over into fulfillment Hallelujah
[1:21:36] We Can't Stop
[1:21:38] I'm having to skip some of this but we
[1:21:40] can't stop short of where we're called
[1:21:42] to be no matter how good the land looks
[1:21:45] listen the land we're Roofing and get
[1:21:47] stopped was good-looking land
[1:21:51] but we can't stop there
[1:21:52] We Can't Stop in that in that place we
[1:21:55] got to press forward brother Brown says
[1:21:57] we've adopted today we've adopted other
[1:21:59] things we've adopted church membership
[1:22:01] instead of an upper room
[1:22:03] we've adopted theology instead of the
[1:22:05] baptism
[1:22:07] we've adopted everything else instead of
[1:22:10] this thing that God told us to do
[1:22:11] because we've listened to the rules and
[1:22:13] Orders of men but when God shared that
[1:22:16] Gospel Light Shine in the morning over
[1:22:17] Yonder on the Eastern country he said
[1:22:20] it's been a day that wasn't dark nor
[1:22:21] light it's been a day hazy the Sun and
[1:22:24] power cannot be seen a mixed light a
[1:22:26] hazy day he said they know the Sun was
[1:22:28] shining but the clouds has put it out of
[1:22:30] their sight people had enough Faith to
[1:22:32] say yes Jesus was the son of God
[1:22:35] he's gone away
[1:22:36] we can see enough to believe salvation
[1:22:39] but you can't believe all of it and they
[1:22:42] stop
[1:22:43] short
[1:22:45] he says that he goes on to talk about
[1:22:47] when the king come to the prophet asking
[1:22:49] for a victory over Syria and he put the
[1:22:51] arrow of Deliverance in his hand and
[1:22:53] told him to go strike it
[1:22:55] and he only Struck it a few times he
[1:22:57] said why'd you do that
[1:22:58] why'd you do that strike for more
[1:23:02] strike for more tonight
[1:23:04] strive for more wherever you're at I'm
[1:23:05] I'm happy you're there but strike for
[1:23:07] more than justification
[1:23:09] strike for more than sanctification
[1:23:12] strike for a full and filling of the
[1:23:14] baptism of the ghost
[1:23:16] s once you get that strike for a
[1:23:18] refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:20] the prophet of God said that the
[1:23:22] Dynamics of this church would be a
[1:23:24] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:27] Ghost I say Lord I need it God pour it
[1:23:30] out I'm striking for it tonight I'm
[1:23:32] striking for the power of God I'm
[1:23:34] striking for healing in our midst I'm
[1:23:36] striking for the gifts I'm striking for
[1:23:38] as anointing I'm striking for a
[1:23:40] refilling of the Holy Ghost I'm striking
[1:23:42] for all of it tonight and I will not
[1:23:45] stop short
[1:23:47] yeah
[1:23:49] we got a strike for the dividends
[1:23:53] he says I'll tell you what's the matter
[1:23:55] with Christians tonight you're not
[1:23:56] drawing dividends on your baptism of the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost
[1:24:02] he says draw in and drink and drink and
[1:24:06] drink and drink
[1:24:11] and drink
[1:24:13] until you push out salvation push out
[1:24:16] Divine Healing push out the baptism of
[1:24:18] the Holy Ghost and drink and drink and
[1:24:21] drink
[1:24:22] it's time to take another drink tonight
[1:24:25] telling you you ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:24:27] I'm telling you why not take another
[1:24:29] drink tonight the rock followed them
[1:24:31] they're right here tonight the Rocks now
[1:24:33] just take another drink
[1:24:35] get refreshed tonight when's the last
[1:24:37] time you were refreshed in the presence
[1:24:39] of the Lord
[1:24:43] listen justification was a good land
[1:24:46] sanctification was good land the gifts
[1:24:49] was good land
[1:24:52] listen
[1:24:55] Pentecost never made an error now I'm
[1:24:58] talking about denominational Azusa
[1:24:59] Street
[1:25:00] by accepting the gifts
[1:25:03] their error was rejecting the word
[1:25:09] do we understand
[1:25:11] so when you get excited and the holy
[1:25:13] spirit moves and people run and shout
[1:25:16] and jump and dance and speak in tongues
[1:25:18] and people go you bunch of Pentecostals
[1:25:21] uh I don't identify with that because
[1:25:23] I'm not a word rejector I haven't
[1:25:25] rejected the word I've accepted the word
[1:25:28] why am I excited because of the word the
[1:25:31] word is open I'm excited because of the
[1:25:33] word tonight it's been restored I don't
[1:25:37] identify with that and if you say well
[1:25:39] it's word word and reject all the gifts
[1:25:41] and the movement of the spirit and the
[1:25:43] supernatural you're making the same
[1:25:45] error they they may just in a different
[1:25:46] ditch
[1:25:49] come on
[1:25:52] but we can have all of it
[1:25:54] we can have all of it
[1:25:57] you don't gotta pick and choose and say
[1:25:59] well I better not take too much
[1:26:01] you can have all of it tonight
[1:26:05] let me move on a little bit
[1:26:09] Hallelujah
[1:26:10] Reuben and dad had followed the pillar
[1:26:13] of Fire
[1:26:14] these weren't people that weren't
[1:26:15] accustomed to the moving of the spirit
[1:26:17] these weren't people that didn't believe
[1:26:19] the message they'd followed it all the
[1:26:21] way up to the River Jordan but then when
[1:26:23] it came time to cross over
[1:26:26] when it came time listen they'd followed
[1:26:28] the message through through
[1:26:29] sanctification they'd followed
[1:26:32] through justification recognize the era
[1:26:35] of denominations
[1:26:36] they had followed it long enough to
[1:26:38] recognize this is a Vindicated prophet
[1:26:41] they followed it that long they followed
[1:26:43] it far enough to stay under its
[1:26:44] protection stay under its blessings even
[1:26:46] so far they'll go as far as to say we've
[1:26:50] got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] but on our condition
[1:26:57] we've got the Holy Ghost but only on
[1:26:59] terms that we're comfortable with
[1:27:01] we've got the Holy Ghost because we
[1:27:03] believe
[1:27:07] yes
[1:27:08] I'm not arguing with you you better
[1:27:10] believe
[1:27:12] and you can't get the Holy Ghost without
[1:27:14] believing
[1:27:17] but this isn't some denominational
[1:27:18] philosophy where you walk up and say
[1:27:20] well I believe the message so I'm okay
[1:27:22] no no no no listen brother Brown made it
[1:27:25] very very very very very very clear that
[1:27:27] you can't Rob The Experience out of it
[1:27:29] he said they all want to dodge the new
[1:27:31] birth they want to dodge the new birth
[1:27:33] they don't want that experience because
[1:27:34] it's messy he said it's messy whether
[1:27:37] it's in a hospital room or whether it's
[1:27:39] in a pig pen a birth is always messy
[1:27:42] they want the Holy Ghost without the
[1:27:45] experience well listen that's not how it
[1:27:46] happened originally if we're going to go
[1:27:48] back to the original we've got to go
[1:27:49] back to the original of the original
[1:27:51] like I said I don't want to walk up the
[1:27:53] staircase to the upper room and get to
[1:27:55] the door and go Ah that's enough no I'm
[1:27:57] going on in I gotta have my own backside
[1:28:00] of the desert burning bush experience
[1:28:02] and you gotta have that tonight we can't
[1:28:05] be afraid or scared of the new birth at
[1:28:08] the original they staggered like drunk
[1:28:11] people
[1:28:13] and they spoke in tongues how it
[1:28:16] happened prophet of God says the mother
[1:28:18] of Jesus Christ had to go up there and
[1:28:21] be included in that bunch of people so
[1:28:24] drunk on the spirit till she staggered
[1:28:26] like she was drunk on whiskey or
[1:28:28] something
[1:28:30] and you think you'll get to Heaven by
[1:28:33] slipping over the church and putting
[1:28:34] your songbook under your arm and walking
[1:28:36] over every Sunday and the Bell Tolls and
[1:28:39] you sit and listen and walk back you'll
[1:28:41] never do it
[1:28:44] you have to come that route because
[1:28:46] that's the only route God ever laid down
[1:28:49] and ever has you'll walk it or you won't
[1:28:53] be there listen here's the deal if you
[1:28:56] don't like this portion you just
[1:28:59] um
[1:29:01] I'm leaving my opinion out of this
[1:29:03] completely this is this is your Prophet
[1:29:05] speaking
[1:29:06] he says I'm not your judge but I'm
[1:29:09] preaching the gospel that's exactly the
[1:29:12] truth the Blessed Virgin was right there
[1:29:14] acting
[1:29:16] yes just as idiotic as the rest of them
[1:29:21] did just as drunk as the rest of them
[1:29:24] these men and women every one of them
[1:29:26] was full of new wine if God ever changed
[1:29:29] that program put your finger on it on
[1:29:31] the scripture for me it isn't there no
[1:29:35] sir it was plumbed to the end of the age
[1:29:37] that way come to the end of the Bible
[1:29:39] and it'll be that way till Jesus comes
[1:29:43] Hallelujah that I say pour it out there
[1:29:47] whatever it takes
[1:29:50] gotta get it I ain't ashamed I just want
[1:29:53] it I want to be there my children are
[1:29:56] gonna be there and I'm hoping to receive
[1:29:58] it however you want to give it tonight
[1:30:00] time for fulfillment but if you're gonna
[1:30:03] fulfill it you gotta get filled
[1:30:05] Hallelujah
[1:30:11] gotta go back to the original
[1:30:15] we're gonna begin to wind this down
[1:30:18] we're gonna cross into the land of the
[1:30:20] Fulfillment
[1:30:21] you'll not fulfill everything
[1:30:25] unless you come all
[1:30:27] all the way back to the original furnace
[1:30:33] it's a land of the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:30:35] land of the supernatural let me tell you
[1:30:37] the devil hates the supernatural so much
[1:30:40] he attacks it
[1:30:42] so much and he tries to bring doubts
[1:30:44] about supernatural events and he wants
[1:30:46] to keep you out of it he'll bring he'll
[1:30:48] bring doubts and he'll bring uh um he'll
[1:30:51] question the authentic authenticity of
[1:30:53] certain events it's his tactic to
[1:30:56] undermine the Supernatural and seem like
[1:30:59] it's merely a
[1:31:02] coincidence that it was just entirely
[1:31:05] made up
[1:31:09] because what happens is he did the same
[1:31:11] thing with Janice and jambres the way
[1:31:13] they withstood Moses and tried to act
[1:31:15] like what was the point of Denison
[1:31:17] jambrief to try to act like that the
[1:31:20] Miracles in the Supernatural was nothing
[1:31:22] more than a mere magician's trick
[1:31:25] to make the supernatural seem like not
[1:31:28] that big of a deal
[1:31:33] to take away from the power what was its
[1:31:36] intent was to discredit it to remove
[1:31:38] faith in the power of God why because
[1:31:41] that was the power
[1:31:42] in that state yes that was that's why
[1:31:45] God said he showed them this for that
[1:31:48] was the power that was going to take
[1:31:49] them out of Egypt
[1:31:51] and so if I can get Jim this is Janice
[1:31:53] and jam Brees if I can get them to
[1:31:54] disbelieve in the Supernatural if I can
[1:31:57] discredit the Supernatural and say it's
[1:32:00] all emotion
[1:32:03] discredit the Supernatural and and and
[1:32:05] and point to the failures of Azusa
[1:32:07] Street Pentecost
[1:32:09] point to their failures say oh well they
[1:32:11] jump and they shout and they do those
[1:32:12] things too but it's only emotion it's
[1:32:15] only a magician's trick
[1:32:18] and it gets you to where you're afraid
[1:32:20] of the supernatural listen I'll say it
[1:32:23] like this
[1:32:25] we're not afraid of a little bit of
[1:32:27] Wildfire because there's plenty of wet
[1:32:30] blankets around here to put it out
[1:32:34] listen we got way too many people that
[1:32:37] are spiritual fire extinguishers
[1:32:39] and all of a sudden something right
[1:32:40] there whoa no no no no no
[1:32:43] they almost shouted
[1:32:48] they almost got excited they almost ran
[1:32:51] around what would have happened if
[1:32:53] they'd ride around this building I don't
[1:32:55] know what would have happened maybe
[1:32:56] somebody got loose maybe somebody got
[1:32:58] free hey I'm just the opposite I see a
[1:33:01] little smart and say Where's that
[1:33:02] gasoline
[1:33:04] I say pour some gasoline on it I say
[1:33:07] when a supernatural starts to break free
[1:33:09] embrace it enjoy it realize it hey you
[1:33:13] want to know what I'm shouting about you
[1:33:15] want to know what I'm excited about join
[1:33:17] me one time get loose one time get free
[1:33:21] one time oh come on there was some
[1:33:23] Fanatics one day that was running from
[1:33:25] the battle and they threw their dead
[1:33:28] friend on some bones that had life in it
[1:33:30] I wish some of y'all get on something
[1:33:31] with some life in it tonight and all of
[1:33:34] a sudden the dead guy got up went to run
[1:33:36] and they said that guy's been dead 25
[1:33:38] years on the front row what happened he
[1:33:41] came in contact with some lies and that
[1:33:45] life got on and all of a sudden he was
[1:33:47] running and he was shouting and praising
[1:33:50] God
[1:33:51] tonight
[1:33:54] foreign
[1:34:00] that's the power that heals our sick
[1:34:03] that's the power that sets people free
[1:34:04] from addiction that's the power that
[1:34:07] breaks depression and it's the power
[1:34:09] that's gonna take me home it's the power
[1:34:10] that's going to change my body it's the
[1:34:13] power I feel it drawing me even now and
[1:34:15] the draw from that world is getting
[1:34:17] stronger than the draw from this world

[1:34:21] better get to looking for something soon
[1:34:23] because any day now any day now they're

[1:34:27] draw and I'm saying Lord just take us
[1:34:30] take us home Lord we're ready I'm ready
[1:34:33] to fulfill the greatest event in the
[1:34:36] history of humankind the Rapture of the
[1:34:38] church I'm ready for fulfillment I'm
[1:34:41] ready for the body change I'm ready for
[1:34:43] total victory tonight
[1:34:45] Hallelujah
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:55] back to Genesis 49. and we're not going
[1:34:58] to go through all these that was a long
[1:35:00] reading
[1:35:01] but we read what we were reading there
[1:35:04] was the prophecies and the blessings
[1:35:06] that Jacob was speaking this was our
[1:35:07] opening scripture
[1:35:09] over his sons
[1:35:12] and in these it helps us to understand
[1:35:15] why they made the choices that they made
[1:35:19] and even the conduct of the tribes
[1:35:21] and the Fulfillment that comes through
[1:35:23] each one of those tribes you can trace
[1:35:25] it back to these blessings that he puts
[1:35:26] upon
[1:35:32] we know that Jesus was the
[1:35:34] is the line of the tribe of Judah and
[1:35:36] the root and The Offspring of David he's
[1:35:38] the firstborn of any Brethren he is the
[1:35:40] firstborn of every creature according to
[1:35:42] Colossians
[1:35:43] now nothing is by accident
[1:35:46] and we've established that God works
[1:35:48] every situation to come to pass the way
[1:35:50] he wants it to
[1:35:51] Judah is the trial
[1:35:55] by assignment
[1:35:57] Rubin lost the birthright
[1:36:01] okay listen to me Reuben was technically
[1:36:04] Jacob's firstborn son
[1:36:06] he says so in the scripture reading but
[1:36:09] he forfeited the firstborn rights of
[1:36:11] inheritance through misconduct
[1:36:13] and he lost them to Judah we see that in
[1:36:15] Genesis 49 3 and 4 First Chronicles five
[1:36:19] one and it's for that reason that the
[1:36:22] ruler belongs to Judah
[1:36:24] we saw that in Genesis 49 and 10 it says
[1:36:27] the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[1:36:28] nor a law Giver from between his feet
[1:36:30] until Shiloh come
[1:36:32] now when we think of Jacob's blessings
[1:36:33] upon his sons
[1:36:35] we have to realize that that each
[1:36:37] prophetic blessing was not so much upon
[1:36:39] an individual son
[1:36:42] as it was upon that son's future
[1:36:44] descendants
[1:36:45] and it was for that sub it would also be
[1:36:48] what each one of those ascendants would
[1:36:50] have to walk under that was the thing
[1:36:52] that was pronounced over them it was
[1:36:53] more intended as a prophecy upon those
[1:36:56] thousands of descendants who would later
[1:36:58] be born into that tribe and
[1:37:00] Not only was it pronouncing the
[1:37:02] Destinies as it were of these tribes
[1:37:05] he was pronounced
[1:37:07] in the characteristics that each of
[1:37:09] these tribes would develop
[1:37:12] and those characteristics were but
[1:37:14] extensions
[1:37:17] of the already developed and displayed
[1:37:19] characteristics of his sons
[1:37:21] so Genesis 49 and 3 he says Reuben Thou
[1:37:23] Art my firstborn my might in the
[1:37:25] beginning of my strength the Excellency
[1:37:28] of dignity and the Excellency of power
[1:37:30] unstable us
[1:37:32] [Applause]
[1:37:35] that was he was unstable he made bad
[1:37:37] decisions he's never going to excel
[1:37:39] because of this and we see that when it
[1:37:41] comes time to cross over he would not
[1:37:42] cross over he made a bad decision
[1:37:45] but family Cycles have been something
[1:37:48] that humans have had to battle from the
[1:37:49] very beginning of time
[1:37:52] when it comes to your natural family
[1:37:54] you have to be a cycle breaker
[1:37:58] we can't lean into into the crutch so
[1:38:00] this is how my daddy was this is how my
[1:38:03] mama was this is just how my family is
[1:38:06] temper runs in my family lust problems
[1:38:09] running my family that's why we get a
[1:38:11] new birth
[1:38:13] we understand we can't lean back into
[1:38:16] the crutch of this we have to be cycle
[1:38:18] cycle Breakers and 4919 says God a troop
[1:38:22] shall overcome him but he shall overcome
[1:38:25] at the last
[1:38:27] now this is a very very brief blessing
[1:38:29] on on God about God's future as a
[1:38:32] military force and they were but the
[1:38:34] reason it speaks this way where it says
[1:38:37] a troop shall overcome him it is
[1:38:39] actually talking about all the battles
[1:38:41] and Wars he's going to have to fight
[1:38:42] more than any other tribe because of
[1:38:45] where he chose to settle
[1:38:47] he settled closest to the enemy he
[1:38:50] settled in enemy territory without his
[1:38:52] brothers and sisters around him for
[1:38:54] strength and reinforcement oh I can
[1:38:56] serve God and not come to the house of
[1:38:58] God okay but prepare for a lot of
[1:38:59] battles prepare for a lot of hardships
[1:39:01] prepare for a lot of things that you
[1:39:03] wouldn't have had to go through if you'd
[1:39:05] have just assembled yourself with your
[1:39:07] fellow brothers and sisters that have
[1:39:09] been there to help you fight your
[1:39:10] battles it says yeah you're gonna
[1:39:12] overcome at the end I'm not telling you
[1:39:14] you're not gonna make it I'm telling
[1:39:15] there's lots of things you're going to
[1:39:16] deal with because you didn't do it the
[1:39:18] way the word said to when he said
[1:39:19] assemble yourselves together
[1:39:24] but they were constantly attacked
[1:39:26] because they settled short and it says
[1:39:28] in the end they're going to win and most
[1:39:29] of the time they did but notice that
[1:39:32] they're fighting battles and enduring
[1:39:33] trials that they didn't have to
[1:39:35] they were attacked on all sides because
[1:39:37] of where they chose to settle and the
[1:39:40] prophecy had seen them there
[1:39:42] the prophecy had saw that Reuben would
[1:39:44] not Excel
[1:39:46] now listen as we bring this down
[1:39:49] and generation after generation would
[1:39:52] walk on
[1:39:54] think about it that was the blessing
[1:39:56] that you had to walk on her every day of
[1:39:57] your life
[1:39:58] every generation has the characteristics
[1:40:00] of the patriarch of their tribe would
[1:40:03] play out in the Fulfillment of their
[1:40:05] lives they didn't even really have a say
[1:40:08] in the matter this is how it's going to
[1:40:11] be this is prophecy the characteristics
[1:40:14] of the sons of Jacob were passed down
[1:40:16] into
[1:40:17] the tribes and the prophecies would
[1:40:19] prove true time and time again and then
[1:40:21] once again as they failed to fulfill all
[1:40:24] that they were called to do when they
[1:40:26] failed to cross over once again it was a
[1:40:28] fulfillment of this prophecy that had
[1:40:30] been put upon their lives
[1:40:32] but what I'm telling you is is that as
[1:40:35] the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:40:38] we don't carry the characteristics of
[1:40:42] just some patriarch over our head come
[1:40:45] on now we don't care that we carry the
[1:40:47] characteristics of the Lion of the tribe
[1:40:50] of Judah so when I look and say am I
[1:40:53] going to overcome I ask you a question
[1:40:54] did he overcome am I gonna make it did
[1:40:58] he make it am I going to tear Satan's
[1:41:00] kingdom down did he tear Satan's kingdom
[1:41:02] down yes he did yes he did yes he did
[1:41:06] and I'm walking underneath the
[1:41:08] characteristics of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:10] or we are bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:41:13] flesh the same word that speaks of the
[1:41:15] groom speaks of the Bride so what are we
[1:41:18] gonna do we are gonna fulfill all that
[1:41:21] has been spoken about the bride in this
[1:41:23] day we're gonna cast Satan down we're
[1:41:25] gonna heal the sick cast out Devils
[1:41:27] Jacob body change Jacob rapture we can't
[1:41:30] help it it's what Papa John is going to
[1:41:33] do through us we carry his genetic oh

[1:42:01] shall you do us because you've got his
[1:42:04] characteristics
[1:42:06] Satan says no you're mine huh
[1:42:08] now the prophecy claims me
[1:42:11] the prophecy claims me there's been a
[1:42:14] vision scene of you
[1:42:15] the church is fulfilling her part
[1:42:18] As She Goes Down
