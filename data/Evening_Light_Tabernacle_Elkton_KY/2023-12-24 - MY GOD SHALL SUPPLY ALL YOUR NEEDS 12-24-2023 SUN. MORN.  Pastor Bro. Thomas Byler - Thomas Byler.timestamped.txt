[40:40] christianer
[40:43] military the people that work for you
[40:46] people that you surround you
[40:49] withr they
[40:55] have your whe
[41:00] Brother
[41:08] people
[41:12] whatever you're to do the same thing you
[41:15] did seven days ago you're do the same
[41:18] morning and that's what a real chran
[41:25] bring
[41:34] everyone will know do right thing
[41:37] because right to pretty simple but it's
[41:41] the truth you whe it's truth
[41:46] 4 same truth and I'll just read uh about
[41:52] starting at the 14th verse you'll have
[41:54] to sometimes words go dark
[42:00] on but I'll start about about 13th verse
[42:05] of first Thessalonians 4th chapter this
[42:09] morning I would not have you be ignorant
[42:12] brother
[42:13] conc that even others have
[42:19] no place this morning you have that hope
[42:23] you have that desire you have that you
[42:25] have that
[42:29] your
[42:33] side you believe that Jesus died and
[42:36] again even so them also sleep in Jesus
[42:40] God for this sayto you by the word of
[42:43] the Lord that we which are alive and
[42:46] remain the coming of the Lord not them
[42:49] which are sweet for the Lord himself
[42:53] from with SH the voice of the archangel
[42:57] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[42:59] chrise first and together with them in
[43:03] the cloud to meet the Lord so shall you
[43:06] ever be with the
[43:08] Lord I was just thinking this 18 read
[43:12] all these but I'm thinking of this verse
[43:14] right
[43:16] here and as we go the
[43:20] 2024 the next
[43:25] days right there you have
[43:28] to know
[43:33] end and I thinking Paul you know he
[43:35] brings those truths in this
[43:38] chapter and then he he starts here in
[43:40] the fth chapter
[43:49] and you can see what preach in mess you
[43:54] can see the word of God
[43:56] you can
[43:59] seey a lot of times we have a hard time
[44:11] seeing the whole world to fall asleep
[44:15] real fall asleep when they shall say
[44:18] peace and that's the world right now all
[44:24] H and
[44:29] upon
[44:32] not more here are not that day should
[44:37] not you and the preach that come
[44:49] behind the only that's to be
[44:54] responsible
[44:56] the choose not to obey the word and you
[44:59] only have one person blame that's you
[45:03] all the children of light and Children
[45:04] of the day we are not of the night nor
[45:08] Darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[45:11] do others
[45:12] but
[45:22] goep of the world just can't see outside
[45:29] things finish a here

[1:19:27] are ain't that right cuz they're
[1:19:29] certainly crazy as far as I'm concerned
[1:19:31] amen amen and so we just thank God for
[1:19:35] his grace amen amen praise the Lord so
[1:19:38] this morning amen I I didn't pull a
[1:19:41] quote up but brother bam was fixing the
[1:19:43] preach and he says you know not just be
[1:19:45] calm he says and don't get excited he
[1:19:48] says faith doesn't get excited Jesus
[1:19:50] never got excited I heard him saying
[1:19:53] about just you know don't get all
[1:19:54] excited and I'm like wow I like to get
[1:19:56] excited but maybe some sometimes we need
[1:19:58] just just take it calmly and let the
[1:20:00] Holy Spirit just move in a calm amen
[1:20:04] realm amen now don't let me say that too
[1:20:06] much and everybody be all quiet and
[1:20:08] sleeping on me this morning but amen God
[1:20:11] bless you amen praise the Lord amen so I
[1:20:14] want to read a few scriptures before I
[1:20:16] actually tell you my title amen it is
[1:20:18] certainly a simple one but we've prayed
[1:20:21] so let me get my Bible here and we will
[1:20:26] amen um turn if you will with me and
[1:20:29] we'll go to the Book of
[1:20:30] Revelations amen I I wanted to kind of
[1:20:33] get away from this thought am mean this
[1:20:35] thought kind of come to me and I begin
[1:20:36] to think about it I said no I've
[1:20:38] preached on that before where am I going
[1:20:39] to go with that you know and and you
[1:20:42] know my flesh perhaps but the Lord just
[1:20:45] brought it back amen and so how many
[1:20:47] knows whatever the Lord wants that's
[1:20:48] what we want amen whatever the Holy
[1:20:50] Spirit wants to bring to us amen and so
[1:20:53] amen I and and certainly don't feel I'm
[1:20:55] a deep preacher but amen if I can just
[1:20:58] preach the simple things God lays on my
[1:21:00] heart amen I think it'll be a blessing
[1:21:02] to us amen Revelations
[1:21:07] 3 amen I just want to say that our heart
[1:21:10] really goes out to Sister Mildred I
[1:21:12] think everybody understands you know uh
[1:21:15] you know they didn't want to suppose
[1:21:17] some things but I will say that um what
[1:21:20] did H say her pelvis I think was broken
[1:21:22] you know and a couple she needs surgery
[1:21:25] on some vertebraes in the back of her
[1:21:26] neck amen but they haven't take haven't
[1:21:29] done it because uh of her age amen and
[1:21:32] so they they're just kind of looking at
[1:21:34] things and watching things right now
[1:21:36] amen and then of course they bleeding on
[1:21:37] the brain and so we know that it's I
[1:21:40] mean it's serious so we just pray that
[1:21:43] amen uh the great God the great
[1:21:45] physician would come on the scene amen
[1:21:47] and touch our sister amen it's quite
[1:21:49] something I thought you know how
[1:21:50] Wednesday I talked about how unrel ible
[1:21:53] life is that we have no promise of even
[1:21:54] making it home and you know you know she
[1:21:57] could have been taken amen and and and
[1:21:59] it's just so true isn't it and it could
[1:22:01] have been her or any one of us if uh if
[1:22:03] God call you home amen we're going to go
[1:22:06] home amen but you know I trust that you
[1:22:09] know I think as far as I know most of
[1:22:10] her body and her heart and blood
[1:22:12] pressure and everything is in good shape
[1:22:14] amen her eyesight may not be the best
[1:22:17] amen amen she was pulled out in front of
[1:22:19] a few people here the last couple of
[1:22:21] weeks amen but just pray if it's not her
[1:22:23] time that God will spare her and give
[1:22:25] her good life amen amen they did say
[1:22:27] that she was moving her hands and her
[1:22:29] feet amen so it doesn't look from what
[1:22:33] my point of view from what I understand
[1:22:34] she's not paralyzed like from the neck
[1:22:36] down or anything so but they're keeping
[1:22:38] her sedated you know because they're
[1:22:40] watching the bleeding on the brain and
[1:22:41] see where it goes and see if they'll
[1:22:43] have to release pressure or kind of
[1:22:45] watching it amen but our heart goes out
[1:22:48] to her amen and we know that God is with
[1:22:51] her amen
[1:22:53] Revelations 3 a very familiar scripture
[1:22:56] this morning amen and uh we'll begin
[1:23:00] with verse
[1:23:03] 17 because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:23:08] increase with goods and have need of
[1:23:11] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[1:23:13] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:23:15] blind and naked I consel Thee to buy of
[1:23:18] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:23:20] mayest be rich in white rment that thou
[1:23:22] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:23:25] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:23:27] and eyes with eyes have that thou mayest
[1:23:30] see you can be seated may God add His
[1:23:32] blessings to the reading of the
[1:23:35] word
[1:23:39] amen amen in
[1:23:42] Philippians the last chapter I think
[1:23:44] it's verse chapter five I think
[1:23:47] maybe chapter only has four chapters
[1:23:51] four and verse 9 19 Paul says it this
[1:23:54] way he says but my God shall supply all
[1:23:57] your need according to his riches in
[1:24:01] Glory by Jesus Christ amen and the word
[1:24:06] that came to me amen was that simple
[1:24:09] little
[1:24:10] word of need amen
[1:24:14] need amen so I going to talk about being
[1:24:18] needy and I titled it amen my God shall
[1:24:21] supply all all your needs amen how many
[1:24:25] believe that God has promised to do that
[1:24:27] amen and we are certainly a needy people
[1:24:30] amen amen and
[1:24:32] so um a needy people says it this way he
[1:24:36] says you know you said before you're
[1:24:39] going away whatever that two or three
[1:24:42] Whenever two or three are gathered in my
[1:24:44] name there you'd be in their midst and
[1:24:46] if they shall agree on any single thing
[1:24:48] as touching one thing ask and you shall
[1:24:51] receive Lord to bring your promise to
[1:24:53] this the purchase of thy blood man woman
[1:24:57] or child that rais their hands tonight
[1:25:00] that you know their heart may they
[1:25:03] receive what they're asking for granted

[1:25:33] from the very start God allowed us to

[1:25:58] believing and number three we're acting
[1:26:01] in faith that he'll go before us and
[1:26:03] make the way clearer amen amen I like

[1:27:17] that the animals don't have Amen brother
[1:27:20] brandom said that's the place of the
[1:27:21] Soul the place amen of the control tower

[1:31:06] by an uplifted hand God's ease now you
[1:31:10] see whether we're needy in a needy world
[1:31:14] or not Brethren I guess 95 or 98% of the
[1:31:19] audience lifted their hands
[1:31:22] confess they were
[1:31:25] needy they had
[1:31:31] needs
[1:31:32] amen and will also will always be needy
[1:31:36] now I like and I've preached a me

[1:32:10] knows you may have you may be perfectly
[1:32:12] in fellowship with the
[1:32:14] father Spirit ain't that right amen this

[1:32:29] needs you'll always be needy until you
[1:32:33] get over the other side what I read
[1:32:34] reason that I read that over in
[1:32:36] Revelations the third chapter is because
[1:32:37] he that group remember they said they
[1:32:40] said they had need
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:44] of nothing that's right they had need of
[1:32:49] nothing and I want to say I want to say
[1:32:52] this that I believe the day will come
[1:32:55] when you and I will be able to see say I
[1:32:58] ain't got no needing
[1:33:02] nothing thank you hard to understand
[1:33:05] ain't it sah where in the
[1:33:08] world now let me ask one question and
[1:33:11] you'll be able to answer it where will
[1:33:13] that
[1:33:14] be on the other
[1:33:16] side you won't be need the over you
[1:33:19] won't need healing you won't need
[1:33:20] salvation you w't
[1:33:22] woo come on people think about it when
[1:33:25] we get over there we'll be able to say I
[1:33:27] don't need nothing I've got everything
[1:33:32] out but not until over there so they had
[1:33:35] a I believe I didn't go back and search
[1:33:37] it but the BR I believe one of the
[1:33:38] church agees somewhere he says you know
[1:33:40] when they said they had need of nothing
[1:33:41] in other words they're saying that we
[1:33:42] have
[1:33:44] arrived we've got what we need we don't
[1:33:47] need anymore they have
[1:33:50] arrived well uh that's not the way God
[1:33:53] saw it was
[1:33:54] it that's certainly not the way God saw
[1:33:57] it and tonight we come again Lord as a
[1:34:00] needy people for we are ever in need of
[1:34:04] thee as long as we're here on Earth we
[1:34:08] know that'll be the cry for we are in a
[1:34:12] battle that battle is Raging as long as
[1:34:15] we are in Earth there'll be the cry Lord
[1:34:18] I have need cuz tomorrow you'll have
[1:34:20] another battle come tomorrow you'll have
[1:34:22] more sickness come tomorrow you'll have
[1:34:24] more mind battles tomorrow you'll have
[1:34:25] something else am man oh my think about
[1:34:29] it you'll have need of Victory all the
[1:34:34] way to the
[1:34:35] end so needs amen it's okay to be
[1:34:43] needy amen why God made us that way why
[1:34:50] he could Supply
[1:34:52] our
[1:34:54] need why would a why would a Shepherd go
[1:34:57] and break the Little Lamb's
[1:35:00] leg why in the world would you be so
[1:35:02] cruel as to break the Little Lamb's
[1:35:06] leg well maybe it kept
[1:35:10] straying maybe it kept straying and it
[1:35:12] just wouldn't stay home and so he broke
[1:35:15] its leg so that he could give it some
[1:35:17] special attention more time there and it
[1:35:20] would clean closer to the master he has
[1:35:24] a purpose in it all don't he amen and
[1:35:28] god let's getting great needs he let
[1:35:32] Israel get into a need when he put him
[1:35:34] down there on the Red Sea amen trap
[1:35:36] couldn't go
[1:35:38] nowhere we got a
[1:35:40] need they had a bad need but how many
[1:35:43] know if God wanted to make way how many
[1:35:47] believe that we have got the greatest
[1:35:49] way maker that ever was
[1:35:53] I don't care what it is he is our way
[1:35:57] maker he is our supplier he is our
[1:36:01] provider and he didn't come and he
[1:36:04] didn't he's not going to leave you amen
[1:36:06] with
[1:36:07] 95% of your needs supplied no Paul said
[1:36:13] I he
[1:36:15] will all your
[1:36:20] needs we have untapped resources but let
[1:36:23] me tell you something we are tapped into
[1:36:25] the uh The Fountain the inexhaustible
[1:36:28] Fountain of Life that's what you and I
[1:36:31] are tapped
[1:36:35] into Lord help us to
[1:36:38] comprehended he promised anything that
[1:36:41] you
[1:36:43] need
[1:36:45] anything and boy have we got some
[1:36:48] need
[1:36:50] man where would we start
[1:36:53] right
[1:36:55] amen sure be nice to be able to say I
[1:36:58] don't need nothing but we can't say that
[1:37:00] until we get over there but these lay
[1:37:03] out of sins they thought they didn't
[1:37:06] need anything now how can you help a
[1:37:11] person that doesn't need
[1:37:14] anything can you help a person that
[1:37:16] don't need
[1:37:18] nothing no
[1:37:22] huh well you give me let me give you
[1:37:25] some advice shut up I don't want your
[1:37:27] advice I don't need you your advice can
[1:37:30] you give a person advice like that no
[1:37:33] you can't give them advice you can't
[1:37:36] give them anything when they feel like
[1:37:38] they've already got it they've already
[1:37:40] arrived but God thought a little bit
[1:37:43] different the Bible says that they were
[1:37:44] wretched no it's not you were lukewarm
[1:37:48] the Bible said they were
[1:37:50] lukewarm
[1:37:52] can we tie something together does
[1:37:55] lukewarmness come with you thinking
[1:37:58] you're
[1:38:01] okay I'm not lukewarm I'm just fine the
[1:38:04] way I am that's a good lukewarm attitude
[1:38:07] a but a real genuine Holy Ghost person
[1:38:10] realize that I got God but I still need
[1:38:13] more of God there's a deep calling and
[1:38:16] if that's a deep calling there's a deep
[1:38:18] to respond if you have a walk desire for
[1:38:21] a deeper walk with God there's a deeper
[1:38:23] walk with God to be had if you want to
[1:38:24] be more like Christ there's a closer
[1:38:26] walk to be
[1:38:28] had but if you're
[1:38:30] fine you stay like you
[1:38:35] are and I don't know about you but I
[1:38:39] don't want to stay like I
[1:38:41] am why because I'm still not in the
[1:38:44] stature of the perfect image of Christ
[1:38:46] are you how many know we still have need
[1:38:50] of patience
[1:38:51] we still have need of temperance we
[1:38:53] still have need of these
[1:38:55] things amen we can't say well I'm live
[1:38:59] no we're going to be growing until the
[1:39:01] day that we leave this

[1:56:16] want to over run over
[1:56:18] here huh Never Satisfied because of the
[1:56:22] conscience The Emptiness that's in
[1:56:27] here the emptiness because they haven't
[1:56:31] filled that void in their
[1:56:33] heart by giving their life unreservedly
[1:56:36] to Jesus Christ he comes and he FS that
[1:56:40] and
[1:56:41] you don't have to bother with those

[1:57:06] we'll have time to visit each other hang
[1:57:08] out worship
[1:57:11] together can I just say what comes to
[1:57:13] mind I really think that this morning
[1:57:16] Wednesday nights when we come together I
[1:57:19] think this is some of the most precious
[1:57:20] times that we ever have on the face of
[1:57:22] the Earth the most precious times that
[1:57:25] we have and when we breathe there these
[1:57:28] are the most precious times when we
[1:57:31] assemble ourselves together and we have
[1:57:33] a heaven it's called Heavenly places in
[1:57:37] Christ
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:39] Jesus can you understand why a church is
[1:57:42] not meant to be full of stress bickering
[1:57:45] and back but it's not it's poisons of
[1:57:47] the devil
[1:57:50] I thank God brother Glenn one of the
[1:57:53] reasons that I can preach like I do is
[1:57:54] because that's not
[1:57:59] be thank you
[1:58:04] Lord cuz you got to realize when there
[1:58:06] is stress when there is all of that it
[1:58:08] weighs on this
[1:58:10] guy it weighs on him because he's
[1:58:13] responsible
[1:58:15] amen amen and so it's oh my I thank God
[1:58:20] for a mature C

[2:13:55] things that God came and he supplies
[2:13:58] that's right aren't you glad that he
[2:14:01] supplies forgiveness so that we don't
[2:14:03] have a condemned
[2:14:05] conscience one of the greatest things
[2:14:07] that he has supplied is
[2:14:10] forgiveness and Grace he supplied Grace
[2:14:14] that's how we got forgiveness was by him
[2:14:16] coming to the Earth the Christmas story
[2:14:19] amen praise the
[2:14:22] Lord
[2:14:24] amen see the leay out ofans they didn't
[2:14:28] think they needed saving they didn't
[2:14:30] need
[2:14:32] anything but Jesus said blessed are they
[2:14:35] which
[2:14:36] hunger and
[2:14:39] thirst can I put it a little bit
[2:14:42] different after more
[2:14:44] righteousness cuz I'm trusting you're a
[2:14:46] Christian but I want a more more
[2:14:49] righteousness for they shall be filled
[2:14:52] blessed are they that Hunger for More Of
[2:14:54] God for they shall have it because our
[2:14:56] Prophet said when the Deep calls to the
[2:14:58] Deep there's got to be a deep to
[2:15:02] respond amen amen and I
[2:15:06] believe and that there is a
[2:15:11] deep young
[2:15:16] people
[2:15:19] just think about it what's coming
[2:15:24] up oh my brother Braham said his son to
[2:15:26] man if you knew what was coming you
[2:15:27] wouldn't sleep at day hardly amen hardly
[2:15:30] sleep at night just scare you but to
[2:15:34] think that whatever is
[2:15:36] coming he is in
[2:15:38] control he is in control for the
[2:15:42] Christian he is in
[2:15:45] control for his children
[2:15:48] why because we are completely reliant on
[2:15:52] him supplying what we have need
[2:15:55] of all we have to do is completely
[2:15:58] surrender to him see God I'm yours my
[2:16:02] mind is yours my heart is
[2:16:07] yours we had Need of Love perfect love
[2:16:10] that casts out scare and fear I I heard
[2:16:15] brother I was listening to him yesterday
[2:16:17] says what do we care about atomic bombs
[2:16:19] what we care about what all these things
[2:16:21] are he says we ain't got to worry about
[2:16:22] that he says before the first one is
[2:16:24] we'll be gone the believer ain't got to
[2:16:26] worry about
[2:16:29] it oh
[2:16:31] my isn't it weird how China and America
[2:16:34] Russia I guess China and America now
[2:16:37] talking about they want to kind of see
[2:16:39] who has some more Superior
[2:16:41] Fighters I had to think God says man if
[2:16:43] you're relying on the strength of a
[2:16:45] horse to deliver you you're not too
[2:16:47] smart don't rely on the SE strength
[2:16:49] they're relying on their own strength
[2:16:51] Bel Jer and them remember they were the
[2:16:53] strongest of the Nations they thought
[2:16:55] they couldn't be
[2:16:57] conquered that doesn't mean nothing
[2:17:00] don't rely on the strength of your own
[2:17:01] self I'm not relying on my own ability
[2:17:04] today I'm just relying on God to lead
[2:17:06] you to guide
[2:17:08] you amen thank you Lord Jesus the
[2:17:13] Lord amen but I just want to say this
[2:17:16] again amen I really like this what he
[2:17:19] said he said many times talking about
[2:17:21] when you have the Holy
[2:17:23] Ghost when you've got the spirit of God
[2:17:26] on the ins everything that you have need
[2:17:29] of is in you then oh wow well but
[2:17:35] remember he didn't say it was just in
[2:17:36] you but it was like a tree that's
[2:17:38] planted you have to water it you have to
[2:17:41] push out healing you have to push out
[2:17:44] Deliverance you have to push it out by
[2:17:47] by what by watering it I mean those our
[2:17:50] spiritual walk with God I mean it's kind
[2:17:52] of like our natural if you don't eat
[2:17:54] you're going to die don't turn the
[2:17:56] corner you're going to wre if you don't
[2:17:58] Milk The Cow by the B say if you neglect
[2:18:00] to do it she'll go
[2:18:03] dry amen and if you neglect to pray and
[2:18:06] say close to God Amen your'll backslide
[2:18:09] sure as the world you go back how many
[2:18:13] knows God's not going to lose you but
[2:18:16] you can backslide you can get
[2:18:19] decrepit come on folks we can go pretty
[2:18:22] far back until we're like how did I get
[2:18:27] here somebody knows what I'm talking
[2:18:29] about how did they get so
[2:18:31] backslid how did they get so far away
[2:18:33] from
[2:18:36] God but let me tell you something if you
[2:18:39] have that question if you say that to
[2:18:40] yourself you thank God that you're
[2:18:42] saying that to
[2:18:46] yourself
[2:18:50] cuz if you wasn't one of his you'd say
[2:18:52] I'm just fine leave me
[2:18:55] alone don't bother me I like how I
[2:18:58] am huh I'm just fine don't bother me oh
[2:19:03] boy that's a real bad state to be in but
[2:19:05] when the
[2:19:06] Holy Ghost convicts you and says look at
[2:19:09] where you're at look how far you've
[2:19:12] gotten away from God look how cold you
[2:19:14] are W then all it takes is the dropping
[2:19:17] of the knees and saying God forgive me
[2:19:20] Lord bring me back to yourself Lord amen
