[20:36] I went through this evening I'm not I
[20:39] don't want to take a lot of your time
[20:40] but I announced it this morning
[20:42] at the Lord willing I wanna
[20:45] give this testimony of my wife's healing
[20:49] or her cancer
[20:51] and the purpose for something like this
[20:54] is all to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:58] because without him it would have would
[21:00] not have been possible
[21:02] amen so I want to give him all the all
[21:05] the glory for it but I want to thank you
[21:07] all for that
[21:08] I knew I don't know who else I know
[21:10] brother Paul was saying this morning to
[21:12] you and your wife you're saying and
[21:13] somebody else saying I don't know who it
[21:15] was but I enjoyed all the specials and
[21:17] the
[21:17] is the the singing the worship you know
[21:20] wherever the spirit of the Lord is their
[21:22] Liberty
[21:23] amen and so we're just glad that we can
[21:26] be a part of you
[21:28] amen so
[21:30] I'm just going to share some of this
[21:32] before we read the scripture that's all
[21:33] right and uh
[21:35] I hope it it means something to you I
[21:38] hope it'll maybe you know maybe we'll
[21:39] build somebody or somebody sick or have
[21:42] a need here maybe it'll build Faith uh
[21:45] for your healing because I believe that
[21:46] what God does for one he'll do for
[21:49] anybody
[21:50] amen so I think most of you probably
[21:54] know that my wife uh had cancer in 2020
[21:59] August 6 of 2020 she was diagnosed with
[22:03] a tumor and uh
[22:06] uh so you know it's it you know it
[22:11] cancers that that c word that nobody
[22:13] wants to say and and nobody wants to
[22:15] believe it would ever come to your own
[22:17] family right and uh
[22:19] so uh she had told me that she had
[22:22] little uh some some blood in her stool
[22:25] which I'm not sure how long it was
[22:27] before she told me she's I guess like
[22:29] most of us be just kind of keep passing
[22:31] it on and say well it's going to be all
[22:33] right and and finally she told me so I
[22:36] said well go see your family doctor and
[22:38] of course they ordered a uh
[22:40] colonoscopy and so that was during the
[22:44] Cobra thing so you know of course you
[22:45] can't go in the office and all that
[22:48] well whatever I'll keep my thoughts to
[22:49] myself on that but but uh we had to drop
[22:52] her off and then go pick her up and so
[22:54] and uh we were a little bit late getting
[22:56] back to pick her up and
[22:57] and uh she's a you didn't know her she
[23:01] was a very quiet woman uh doesn't want
[23:05] to be in any kind of uh Spotlight at all
[23:08] and uh
[23:10] so we picked her up and uh you know got
[23:13] her the car and I got back over the
[23:16] driver's side and and uh so you know
[23:19] curious husband says you know
[23:22] so what did they say
[23:25] and uh she started crying
[23:28] and this and she's like just go go don't
[23:31] don't sit here in the car let's just get
[23:33] out of here somebody might see me you
[23:35] know and of course I knew what the
[23:37] answer was I knew what the audience she
[23:39] didn't have to say anything you know so
[23:41] we just left and uh
[23:43] well you know it it and it's it's
[23:45] strange how the Lord works I I about a
[23:48] week before that I preached at home and
[23:50] I titled it uh no weapon shall prosper
[23:54] against you
[23:55] and uh so we found that out on August
[23:58] the 6th and so you know of course it's
[24:00] just like a
[24:01] I I'm just going to speak to you as a
[24:03] man right is that okay just like a like
[24:06] a cloud comes on you you know like a
[24:08] heavy pressure like instantly you know
[24:10] it's like your life has changed you know
[24:13] and Satan had you know automatically
[24:14] builds up all this fear right as soon as
[24:17] you hear cancer
[24:18] you know Satan's about yours said well
[24:21] it's over you know it's over but I'm
[24:23] here to tell you it's not over just
[24:24] because it's cancer and I remember
[24:27] talking about Danny and he said well he
[24:28] said just because it's cancer doesn't
[24:31] mean it's the end of it and so you know
[24:34] so you start with all that process and
[24:36] uh uh you know they did the CAT scan to
[24:40] see if it had spread anywhere else which
[24:42] it hadn't praise the Lord and uh and uh
[24:45] so we pray for her in church laid out
[24:47] laid hands on and pray for her and and
[24:50] uh through all this process for the next
[24:52] couple weeks after that we were all you
[24:55] know meet the doctors and the
[24:57] Specialists and all that and that was
[24:59] about as for me about as bad as the
[25:02] cancer itself just the the pressure of
[25:05] dealing with those people and not
[25:06] knowing where to go and what route to
[25:08] take and and then on that on August 26th
[25:11] brother Danny preached the message at
[25:13] home uh title what what are the benefits
[25:18] and it just seemed like when he preached
[25:19] that that something something it kind of
[25:22] lifted that cloud a little bit I mean
[25:24] the reality was still there and we still
[25:26] had to deal with it you know but it's
[25:28] like the the oppression that I I guess I
[25:31] should say come over be kind of just
[25:32] kind of lifted you know and uh so we
[25:35] made all the you know met with all the
[25:38] Specialists and all these things and of
[25:39] course by that time we had settled what
[25:41] kind of treatment she was going to get
[25:42] and I'll never I always thought it was
[25:45] in because it just it you know as I said
[25:48] we couldn't really go in
[25:51] although her her chemo doctor
[25:55] um when we went there because we made
[25:57] the appointment they said well your
[25:58] husband cannot come in
[26:00] so I said well I'll sit in the car I'll
[26:02] FaceTime the doctor or I'll FaceTime you
[26:04] and you you know I can I can speak with
[26:06] him so she goes in the office and she
[26:08] tells him you know my husband's in the
[26:10] car you know by FaceTiming he said oh he
[26:13] said would you like him to come in
[26:15] she said well yes but the front desk
[26:17] said he can't he says I can take care of
[26:20] that
[26:20] so I said all right he's our doctor now
[26:24] so as long as we're short I went in and
[26:27] then uh
[26:29] when that was all over we went we went
[26:32] to the uh radiation
[26:34] doctor and uh and the same thing there
[26:37] they allowed me to come in with her for
[26:40] the unusual consultation and so we go in
[26:43] you know and everybody's wearing masks
[26:45] you know they're all and they put you on
[26:46] the doctor's offices are and you put
[26:48] your you know you got these hallways and
[26:49] office here and all of us here so they
[26:50] put us in put me and my wife in the
[26:53] office and we waited for the doctor and
[26:55] after a while the doctor and the nurse
[26:57] came and uh
[27:00] it wouldn't even come in the room they
[27:03] said at the doorway they put the chairs
[27:05] at the doorway in the hallway and talked
[27:07] to us
[27:09] I guess I shouldn't laugh but it's just
[27:11] I I feel left I told my wife is this do
[27:13] you feel like you got leprosy
[27:16] are we contagious or something about
[27:18] what in the world man I never saw such a
[27:20] fear you know I just I said this is
[27:23] crazy and uh but anyhow you know praise
[27:25] the Lord that is what it is you know and
[27:27] you kind of just go with the flow and
[27:29] and do do the best you can but
[27:31] then uh she started her treatments on
[27:34] September the 1st of 2020s he had the
[27:38] six six chemo treatments it was one
[27:39] every two weeks and they would send it
[27:41] home with the pump you know and she had
[27:43] that pump on for a couple days and then
[27:45] they would go back and take it off and
[27:46] then the the week in between was usually
[27:48] pretty good you know she felt pretty
[27:50] good but the week off the treatment
[27:51] itself was was pretty rough at times
[27:56] and uh because they gave her y'all
[28:00] medication for nauseous and uh she did
[28:04] she don't like bad occasions you know
[28:05] which I'm glad she don't but but so she
[28:07] didn't take that when she had the first
[28:09] chemo treatment and uh but that was the
[28:11] only time she didn't take she got so
[28:13] sick that night and uh so so from that
[28:16] from then on she would always take the
[28:18] other medication with that with the
[28:20] chemo treatment and so on and as long as
[28:23] she did that it wasn't too bad I mean
[28:24] she got weak you know of course I was
[28:25] pretty weak and all that but uh but uh
[28:28] she went through that every every two
[28:30] weeks up until November 11th uh it was
[28:34] the last treatment and uh and so on and
[28:36] uh you know and through through it all
[28:39] she stayed very strong she really never
[28:42] complained uh and you know sometimes you
[28:45] don't really know what actually
[28:47] sometimes you don't really know what
[28:48] you're made of until you go through
[28:51] through something
[28:52] some kind of pressure you know and then
[28:54] you find out what's in you and and
[28:57] sometimes your spouse
[29:00] them as well as you think you do
[29:03] you know until something happens you
[29:05] know and I found out that she's
[29:08] a pretty strong woman so praise the Lord
[29:10] for that but but she uh
[29:13] so after the uh after the the chemo
[29:17] um
[29:18] they they did say that because they
[29:20] wanted to shrink the tumor so they can
[29:22] take it out it'll be easier to take it
[29:24] out with less you know Scar and
[29:25] everything else and so so they kept
[29:27] saying you know we want to shrink it as
[29:29] much as possible and so after the chemo
[29:31] was done they they they did say because
[29:34] they scanned again you know all that and
[29:35] they said it it say it it responded very
[29:38] well to the treatment
[29:40] so I said praise the Lord and so you
[29:43] know from the beginning they never they
[29:45] never
[29:46] they never talked about the tumor
[29:48] disappearing it was all every time you
[29:51] asked well anything was done it was
[29:52] always we we want to shrink it as much
[29:55] as possible
[29:57] and so after the the chemo was done you
[30:00] know and they said it responded to well
[30:01] I my question to them was you know well
[30:03] why do we need to do radiation uh if
[30:06] you're going to do a surgery anyhow to
[30:07] cut it out let's just you know let's go
[30:09] right to the
[30:11] Source let's just cut it out and skip
[30:13] the radiation and well the answer was
[30:15] always the same we want to shrink it as
[30:16] much as possible of course you know I
[30:19] I'm thinking you know I
[30:22] you know everybody's lying some
[30:24] everybody else's Pockets you know and
[30:27] you know money is involved a lot of
[30:30] money I might say it is involved and I'm
[30:32] thinking you know I
[30:33] I don't know does she really need the
[30:35] radiation they're just you know making
[30:37] money whatever but you know one thing I
[30:39] learned that one thing I want to say if
[30:40] you if you have a spouse or you know
[30:42] somebody that's dealing with something
[30:43] like that just be a support
[30:46] just be there as your support yo and I I
[30:49] I made up my mind uh from the very
[30:52] beginning of us that you know it's it's
[30:54] her body
[30:55] uh I I think I know what I would do but
[30:58] again I don't really know until you go
[31:00] through it yourself but I said you know
[31:02] and I knew her I knew if the doctor
[31:05] recommends radiation she's she's going
[31:06] to do the radiation you know so I I
[31:09] never I never bucked your butt as a
[31:10] whatever you want honey well I'll just
[31:12] here to support you and do whatever you
[31:14] know and so
[31:16] they did the radiation and uh
[31:22] I had I think I
[31:29] oh yeah on the when when one day she was
[31:32] done with done with the chemo
[31:35] um
[31:38] even after they came or not right
[31:40] doctor used the words there's nothing
[31:42] there
[31:44] so that's why I was saying well that's
[31:45] whatever you think is there let's cut
[31:47] her just forget the radiation right
[31:50] and so well they went through the
[31:52] radiation five weeks of radiation uh
[31:55] five five days a week every day
[31:58] go over that radiation and uh
[32:00] so after after the every every report
[32:05] was always you know is
[32:08] was it responded so well or there's
[32:11] nothing there or there's this there's
[32:12] this you know and so uh so what we did
[32:16] the scan after the radiation it was kind
[32:19] of the same thing again you know and uh
[32:23] but the doctor wanted to surgeon I said
[32:26] man I just
[32:27] I do surgery just I'm already convinced
[32:29] there's nothing there
[32:32] right tiny little I don't know was
[32:37] and uh I remember calling brother Danny
[32:39] I said man I said I don't want to go to
[32:42] this surgery I mean it's they already
[32:44] said that nothing there and we believe
[32:46] the Lord anyhow I said oh why why go
[32:51] through that you know I didn't tell I I
[32:53] didn't tell her nothing about I just
[32:54] called Danny you know and he said well
[32:58] he said I'll tell you what he says let
[32:59] him do surgery let them testify again
[33:02] that there's nothing there
[33:04] all right you know whatever you
[33:07] recommend I'll I'll take your advice you
[33:10] know and so we did these schedules the
[33:13] surgery let me back up a little bit just
[33:15] you know which after she was diagnosed
[33:16] and she told me some of this later
[33:19] uh it's actually never from the
[33:21] beginning through the whole thing she
[33:23] never once asked the Lord why
[33:26] you know why her and the other thing she
[33:29] said was she says she told me one day
[33:31] she goes she says I'm glad it was
[33:35] it was me and not one of my sisters
[33:38] and I thought well
[33:40] that's more than I expected to hear out
[33:42] of out of hurry I didn't expect her to
[33:43] be strong but you know she's the older
[33:45] sister and so I guess she feels like
[33:47] she's protecting The Young Ones Still
[33:49] you know and she said she was glad it
[33:52] was her not not her her uh one of her
[33:55] sisters and so
[33:56] yeah so we plan for the surgery and all
[34:00] that and and her doctor was a young
[34:04] Venezuelan man
[34:06] very nice man a super just a a super
[34:11] positive
[34:12] personality and individual I mean you
[34:15] just kind of fell in love with him right
[34:16] off the bat but the only problem was you
[34:18] couldn't understand him he started
[34:20] speaking so fast and that in his in his
[34:22] accent that is like slowed down dog how
[34:25] can you harm to hear what you're saying
[34:27] you know but very positive all the time
[34:30] you know nothing negative ever and and
[34:33] uh so and one of our sister Sandy Klein
[34:36] I think some of you know her uh she
[34:38] works at the hospital as a scrub tech I
[34:40] think they call him and so when she
[34:42] found out is who had cancer the first
[34:43] thing she said was if she needs surgery
[34:47] um this is the doctor you want because
[34:50] he's done like thousands of them and is
[34:52] very good at it and and so we went with
[34:55] him we were very very happy and so you
[34:59] know of course the question of her
[35:00] questions were always is there was
[35:02] always two questions
[35:03] will I get sick
[35:06] I will I'll lose my hair
[35:08] you know as a for a woman that's a big
[35:10] thing
[35:11] will I get sick will I lose my hair and
[35:14] the answer was always just saying well
[35:16] you might get sick
[35:19] we don't know you may not you know you
[35:21] might lose your hair or you say we don't
[35:23] really think you will but you might lose
[35:24] some and she didn't lose quite a bit but
[35:26] most of the people in the church never
[35:27] knew because you know the ladies have
[35:30] long hair so they
[35:31] proof it up and do different things to
[35:33] it and most of the people never knew how
[35:36] much hair she lost but now she has a new
[35:38] crop of hair underneath
[35:41] she wouldn't want me to say this but
[35:42] underneath her gray hair there's some
[35:45] there's some young looking hair coming
[35:47] in so so uh you know praise Lord hope
[35:50] that would grow along she was she always
[35:52] kind of complained about her hair being
[35:53] so thin on the bottom I think this is
[35:55] probably know what you know what she's
[35:57] talking about because you know we don't
[35:59] cut it and so on so you know according
[36:02] to World standards it does not healthy
[36:04] hair right well I think God knows what
[36:07] he's doing is I'm not very worried about
[36:08] that part but she always gonna complain
[36:10] about that so maybe she'll get her a
[36:11] full thick hair now I don't know but uh
[36:13] but anyhow that was always her her
[36:16] questions and so and uh then when we did
[36:20] uh plan to do the surgery
[36:23] and uh
[36:25] uh you know she her the doctor said
[36:28] you'll probably have a colostomy I think
[36:31] that's what he called right
[36:32] a bag for like a better word
[36:35] colostomy so which is something nobody
[36:38] wants
[36:39] and so
[36:40] uh he said well you you might have one
[36:43] for a couple months two or three months
[36:45] or whatever and so we go over to the
[36:47] surgery course again I could go in the
[36:49] hospital I could go to the waiting room
[36:51] but I had to stay there I couldn't even
[36:52] go back to the prep room or nothing
[36:54] and but thankfully this sister Sandra
[36:56] was what made sure she was working at
[36:59] the hospital that day so that way she
[37:01] could go back you know be with her and
[37:03] send messages out to me and so on and so
[37:04] and so the last thing when the doctor
[37:07] come in uh one of the last things he
[37:10] said again he says when you wake up
[37:12] you'll probably have a bag
[37:15] she said okay whatever
[37:16] and so they did the surgery because I'm
[37:19] downstairs waiting you know when you're
[37:20] waiting on air it's forever no matter if
[37:22] it's not great alone you know it was a
[37:24] while but but uh uh you know and so
[37:27] finally
[37:29] finally
[37:30] um
[37:32] the doctor come down and
[37:35] let me see if I can just find
[37:37] he's all right
[37:39] praise the Lord
[37:42] I kind of lost my spot here
[37:48] but again I want to say that they all
[37:50] to the whole thing it was always we want
[37:52] to shrink it
[37:53] as much as possible and none of the
[37:55] doctors ever said
[37:57] we expect it to be gone
[38:00] but when it did the scans that was the
[38:02] words they used there's nothing there
[38:06] hallelujah
[38:07] hallelujah there is nothing there
[38:13] so
[38:14] they did the surgery in the document Dr
[38:16] cabani he said uh you know told me how
[38:19] to serve Joanne he says an ego and this
[38:21] is some of the word she said she was
[38:23] amazing says she is pristine
[38:27] pristine if I understand right means
[38:29] something never been touched
[38:30] right like brand new she's pristine it's
[38:33] just a little bitty scar there and said
[38:36] she didn't need the colostomy
[38:38] and uh he said his words to me where you
[38:41] can call me crazy if you want he said
[38:43] but he said when we got in there she
[38:45] looked so good
[38:47] he said I just put her back together
[38:50] [Applause]
[38:54] so I kind of I I kind of teased her I
[38:56] said honey I knew you were beautiful
[38:58] outside
[38:59] now I know you're beautiful inside
[39:03] you look so good inside so it's kind of
[39:06] a joke now almost just put in yeah so so
[39:09] uh is it I I just put her back together
[39:12] and uh and uh so I said well how much
[39:15] how much did you take out he wanted to
[39:17] take out somewhere the lymph nodes you
[39:18] know and uh and uh he didn't give like
[39:20] an exact measurement he said we took
[39:21] about this much out
[39:24] that's about a foot and a half that's a
[39:25] lot of colon to take out you know but he
[39:28] said we just wanted to make sure and so
[39:31] so this is what the this is this is what
[39:34] the scroll tag that was in with her
[39:36] because sister Sandy couldn't go in
[39:38] because she knew her right their friend
[39:40] so she couldn't go in as the script so
[39:43] the scrub tech that went in kept you
[39:46] know sending her messages and so after
[39:47] it was done this is what she wrote to
[39:49] Sister Sandy she said everything went
[39:52] perfect
[39:53] the tumor responded so well to treatment
[39:55] they were able to remove it robotic
[39:59] quickly
[40:00] and reconnect the bowel without any
[40:03] colostomy very small incisions when they
[40:06] opened the tissue that was removed
[40:07] because it took a little bit that was a
[40:09] little scar just to double check it
[40:11] uh when they open the tissue
[40:14] that was removed complete
[40:18] completely gone
[40:20] I told them there was a lot of prayer
[40:23] and they were also happy with the
[40:25] outcome as well and the scrub said
[40:28] it gave her chills
[40:31] when there was no tumor in the tissue it
[40:34] was unusual to look so good
[40:37] so I want to say praise the Lord
[40:40] I'll tell you when God does something he
[40:42] does it right
[40:43] and they didn't expect it we want to
[40:46] shrink it as much as possible they never
[40:49] said we expect it to be gone
[40:51] and you know
[40:53] but when God does it
[40:56] I I know I I kept telling the telling
[40:58] the the surgeon several times and says
[41:00] you know I said well we're just trusting
[41:02] the Lord we believe you know and he
[41:04] would never really you could tell you
[41:06] without really a religious man he
[41:08] wouldn't never really like yeah we we
[41:10] sure believe with you nothing he just
[41:12] kept kind of going to something else and
[41:13] talk about it you know very upbeat and
[41:15] positive but he would never acknowledge
[41:16] you know listen I don't care you know
[41:19] God will use a doctor God will use
[41:22] whatever he has to use but the end
[41:24] result was there was nothing there
[41:27] Hallelujah
[41:29] amen so I I want to thank the Lord
[41:32] tonight amen that that he have mercy on
[41:35] her and uh you know it was the prayers
[41:37] of the Saints I I believe with all my
[41:39] heart that that allowed this deal
[41:41] alright just holding on and you know
[41:43] what what do you do you know when you're
[41:44] in that situation you know is you know I
[41:47] you know you feel helpless but you you
[41:49] just keep praying you just and yeah I
[41:52] kept just kept saying Lord the word says
[41:54] I you know I sent my word I healed their
[41:57] disease greater is he that's in you than
[41:59] he that's in the world no because here's
[42:02] the thing
[42:03] we can lose
[42:06] yeah well I didn't know what the outcome
[42:08] would be right I mean you don't know I I
[42:11] had no word from the Lord that says
[42:13] there's not going to be a tumor there
[42:14] but but you hold on to the word and here
[42:17] here is the key in all of it when you
[42:20] know who you are
[42:23] it doesn't really matter what the
[42:25] outcome is
[42:26] Hallelujah that's why I say we can't
[42:29] lose
[42:30] you know if the Lord would have chose to
[42:32] take her home I'm still a winner she's
[42:35] still a winner because I'm going to meet
[42:38] her again on the other side well there
[42:40] is no sickness but you know what I will
[42:42] I I I do want to thank the Lord amen and
[42:46] to know that there is healing right now
[42:50] we don't have to wait for the Millennium
[42:53] party he didn't like that man told
[42:54] Brother Branham he said what in the
[42:56] world do we need Divine Healing for in
[42:58] the millennium we need it now
[43:01] right so I'm thankful that weekend that
[43:03] we have a God we know a God and then
[43:06] that
[43:07] is still the same yesterday the day and
[43:09] forever and you might say well that was
[43:11] just you know she went into the process
[43:13] and the treatments and and that's what
[43:15] did it no I I mean thank God for the
[43:18] doctors I'm glad there are doctors but
[43:20] Joe my faith is in the great position
[43:24] you know and and God will you know the
[43:28] prophet God said to God will heal with
[43:30] medicine he'll heal with singing you
[43:33] know uh uh he'll heal my love heal by
[43:36] his word he'll heal my Miracles Whatever
[43:39] It Is God is the Healer and so I would
[43:42] say you're here tonight no matter what
[43:44] you have a knee dog never put it off to
[43:48] somebody else and just say well that's
[43:49] for somebody else but not for me it is
[43:52] for you it is for all of us you know and
[43:56] so and that's that's why you know when
[43:58] this when this Cobra thing come around
[43:59] you know and people begin to fear people
[44:03] that claim to be Christians and become
[44:05] so fearful and you know I I don't mind
[44:08] you know it was like it's like the other
[44:11] c word
[44:12] cancer covert yes it's the other c word
[44:15] like cold but oh you know I said you
[44:19] heard somebody had called me like oh
[44:20] they're gonna die
[44:22] who told you that the devil told you
[44:25] that because listen listen we preach
[44:27] that Jesus Christ is the Healer right
[44:29] he's not just the Healer of a headache a
[44:33] cold heart disease cancer he's a Healer
[44:36] if it's cold but he's a Healer of covet
[44:39] so why do we want to fear the biggest
[44:41] thing is don't fear that's why when
[44:44] Jesus come along always he always said
[44:46] one of the first things he said to his
[44:48] disciples when they were in trouble fear
[44:50] not it is I and and that's what we try
[44:54] to remind the people of in our church
[44:55] when Colbert came and said look it's
[44:58] just a devil
[45:00] it's just another name I'm the Lord to
[45:03] heal us all that is Jesus so I I told
[45:06] the church God beat him to the punch he
[45:09] covered every sickness that could ever
[45:11] happen with a three-letter word oh
[45:14] I heal all your diseases so scientists
[45:17] can name it what they want to name it it
[45:19] doesn't matter what it is God is still
[45:22] the Healer and I think that's the main
[45:24] thing that we should keep our focus on
[45:26] is that no matter what the sickness is
[45:28] God is still the Healer
[45:30] amen you love the Lord let's stand
[45:33] together I'm going to read it if I I
[45:35] don't want I know it's Sunday afternoon
[45:36] but I I wanna
[45:39] put you just a little bit
[45:42] amen and I titled it I'm gonna tie the
[45:45] little sermon there is nothing there
[45:48] so what the doctor said when I applied a
[45:50] little bit to the spiritual part so
[45:52] let's bow our kids the word of prayer
[45:53] before we read the Bible Heavenly Father
[45:55] we come before you tonight Lord I just
[45:57] want to lift up my hand and say thank
[45:59] you Jesus
[46:00] thank you Lord for healing my wife Lord
[46:02] and thank you for every testimony here
[46:04] in this building tonight every testimony
[46:07] of your healing powers Lord and Lord not
[46:10] just your healing power for our body but
[46:12] Lord what you've done for our souls
[46:14] you've healed our souls you gave us
[46:17] salvation we want to say thank you Lord
[46:20] Jesus I pray tonight Lord you will bless
[46:22] the word now let me read a couple of
[46:24] verses may you be glorified in the name
[46:26] of Jesus Christ
[46:28] amen amen if you have your Bible let's
[46:31] turn to Luke chapter 5.
[46:40] praise the Lord
[46:41] [Music]
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:44] let me tell you something else if you
[46:46] are ideally if you if if you have a
[46:48] spouse or somebody going through that
[46:49] the best thing you can do and this is
[46:51] what this is what I learned to uh
[46:53] through through this one of the things I
[46:55] learned I guess is is uh just build a
[46:59] positive atmosphere just try to keep
[47:01] everything as positive as you can don't
[47:04] talk negative
[47:05] don't talk about the doctor's bills
[47:08] because I'll tell you you know I it was
[47:11] funny uh
[47:13] I I just I I felt like the Lord just
[47:16] told me before any treatment ever took
[47:19] place is don't ever don't never say
[47:22] nothing don't complain
[47:24] about the doctor's pills
[47:26] and I'd say I I told this brother Danny
[47:29] I said you know I said I think I think
[47:30] one thing to do that we should never
[47:32] complain about about about the money
[47:34] part and you go you know but Danny he
[47:36] don't miss nothing so he says so are you
[47:38] speaking from the experience
[47:40] hahaha
[47:44] I said no nothing we dealt with you know
[47:46] I just don't play a very that could play
[47:47] a very negative thing on your spouse
[47:49] because she would think or vice versa he
[47:52] would ever would think that well you
[47:54] know you're more worried about about the
[47:56] bills than her
[47:58] it's not a good thing so I was glad that
[47:59] the Lord uh kind of dropped that in my
[48:02] heart before this happened because I'm
[48:03] the kind of person that would have
[48:04] probably said something like that
[48:06] but thank the Lord for his Mercy you
[48:08] know amen because God takes care of all
[48:11] those things
[48:12] Luke Chapter 5 it came to pass first
[48:16] verse
[48:18] it came to pass that as the people
[48:20] pressed upon him to hear the word of God
[48:21] he stood by
[48:23] uh to hear the word of God he stood by
[48:26] the leg of Janessa red and saw two ships
[48:29] standing by the lake but the fishermen
[48:31] were going out of them and were washing
[48:33] their Nets in other words they'd given
[48:35] up
[48:36] enter into one of the ships which was
[48:38] Simon's and prayed him that he would
[48:40] Thrust out a little from the land and he
[48:42] sat down and taught the people out of
[48:45] the ship and were not when he had left
[48:47] speaking he said unto Simon launch out
[48:49] into the deep and let down your nets for
[48:51] a drawing what a positive statement and
[48:54] Simon answering said unto him Master we
[48:56] have toil all night and have taken
[48:58] nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will
[49:01] let down the net I went there
[49:04] and when they had this done they
[49:06] enclosed a great multitude of fishes
[49:10] and their net break
[49:13] God bless you you can be seated I'm
[49:14] gonna read two verses out of Jeremiah
[49:16] chapter 15.
[49:17] while you're seated I will bring Israel
[49:19] again to his habitation and he shall
[49:21] feed on Carmel and Bichon and his soul
[49:24] shall be satisfied about Mount Ephraim
[49:26] and Gilead in those days and in that
[49:29] time saith the Lord the iniquity
[49:31] shall be sought for and there shall be
[49:34] none and the sins of Judah and they
[49:37] shall not be found for I will pardon
[49:39] them whom I reserve in other words there
[49:41] is nothing there amen so that's why I
[49:44] wanted to kind of uh turn this over to
[49:46] the spiritual side of it and
[49:49] um
[49:50] just to kind of draw a little picture of
[49:52] the night amen because you know as a as
[49:55] a man when when uh when a man says your
[49:58] man could say something right and it
[49:59] doesn't mean it's so because we can say
[50:01] there's nothing there but there still
[50:04] could be something there right and so yo
[50:07] even like when even when the doctor says
[50:09] there's nothing there you know uh he's
[50:11] looking at the scans and he's looking at
[50:13] all that and he's trained for that and
[50:14] then you know as far as we know they
[50:16] know what they're talking about but but
[50:17] even though they said there's nothing
[50:19] there there could still be something
[50:20] there right and so but yet no no not
[50:24] casting down now because I'll be because
[50:26] I already believed I was like praise the
[50:28] lord it's over honey there is nothing
[50:31] there right but but man can say things
[50:34] and doesn't mean
[50:36] that is so but when God says there is
[50:39] nothing there
[50:41] you will find nothing
[50:43] amen that's why he says he said the
[50:46] iniquity of Israel shall be sought for
[50:48] and there shall be none
[50:51] and the sins of Judah and there shall
[50:53] not be found boy because God said I will
[50:56] pardon them
[50:57] right I will put their sins as far as
[51:00] the East is from the West there is
[51:02] nothing there so you know I would say
[51:04] denied amen that when when God forgives
[51:07] you of your sins it says there's nothing
[51:09] there listen I don't care what the devil
[51:12] says is there when God says it's not
[51:14] there it's not there
[51:16] When God says you are free from sin you
[51:19] are free from sin if you've come is from
[51:21] right away that is right right you've
[51:23] come and done what God told you to do
[51:25] there is nothing there
[51:28] amen amen so I'm gonna let's turn over
[51:32] to Psalms chapter 103 just for a little
[51:34] bit a few verses there
[51:36] or I can just read to you the Bible says
[51:38] Psalms 103 verse 1 does bless the Lord O
[51:42] my soul and all that's within me bless
[51:45] this Holy Name yo I was thinking about
[51:47] this and I thought you know and somehow
[51:49] we always want to be blessed but the
[51:52] scriptures has blessed the Lord O My
[51:55] Soul those bless the Lord was your life
[51:57] give your life then bless the Lord
[51:59] praise and worship Him bless the Lord O
[52:02] My Soul how do you bless him by
[52:04] surrendering to him is that right it is
[52:07] oh bless the Lord O my soul and all
[52:09] that's within me bless His holy name
[52:12] bless the Lord it says the twice O my
[52:14] soul and forget not all of his benefits
[52:18] Hallelujah he has benefits that are out
[52:21] of this world Amen forget not all of his
[52:23] benefits who forgive us all thine
[52:27] iniquity who heal us all thy diseases
[52:31] including coven
[52:34] Hallelujah and who forgive us all day in
[52:37] English who heal us all die diseases I
[52:40] believe we need to take
[52:42] the word at face value when Jesus when
[52:46] when the Bible says that he forgives all
[52:48] of our iniquity what is Iniquity in
[52:50] order to do good
[52:52] and not doing it right it's iniquity God
[52:55] forgives all of that if you recognize
[52:57] what you've done
[52:59] and you come to him for forgiveness is
[53:01] that right and so who forgives all your
[53:05] iniquities like I said this morning his
[53:07] the fountain is inexhaustible
[53:10] you can exhaust his healing His
[53:12] blessings his Joy he's full of joy
[53:16] amen oh what a wonderful God we serve
[53:20] tonight
[53:21] amen that he has more to give you than
[53:24] what we can probably handle
[53:27] Hallelujah bless the Lord O my soul and
[53:29] all it's within me
[53:33] how do you bless the Lord you do what he
[53:36] says to do and we always say Lord bless
[53:38] me but why don't we bless him
[53:41] how do we bless him brother Peter be
[53:43] blessing by Praise
[53:45] we praise him we surrender our life to
[53:48] him
[53:49] amen bless the Lord amen
[53:52] I know this is hard for us to realize
[53:54] that we can actually bless the Lord
[53:55] unless God is blessed by your presence
[53:58] God is blessed by your surrendering to
[54:01] him
[54:02] bless the Lord O My Soul you know you
[54:05] can say as I said before you can say
[54:07] that your sins are gone
[54:09] but if you ever come the way God has
[54:12] laid off for you to come it doesn't mean
[54:14] you're going just because you saved
[54:15] you're gone but when God says you're
[54:17] gone they are gone yeah but but listen
[54:21] in in this scripture I'm trying to hurry
[54:23] Luke chapter 5.
[54:25] I'm
[54:26] hurrying too much
[54:30] either I'm just getting older I don't
[54:32] know what it is
[54:34] Luke chapter five where we read the
[54:36] scripture there we have Peter and them
[54:39] all out there fishing and official nine
[54:40] couldn't fight couldn't
[54:42] catch nothing now Peter knew there was
[54:46] nothing there right
[54:49] I love this he knew there was nothing
[54:51] there
[54:52] he was a trained fisherman and anybody
[54:54] that knows about fishing or hunting or
[54:57] whatever it might be you know where the
[54:59] fish are you know what a deer are you
[55:01] know where it is and when you've toil
[55:03] all night you have taken nothing you are
[55:06] convincing your mind there are no fish
[55:08] there
[55:09] but here comes a fell along and says hey
[55:13] guys have you caught anything no no
[55:16] we've tiled all night and struggled in
[55:18] it's so depressing I know they're
[55:21] usually fish here and the moon is right
[55:24] the tide is right everything's right but
[55:26] there's nothing there and this stranger
[55:28] says he says cast it on the other side
[55:30] of the boat now
[55:32] yo think about it if you were in that
[55:34] boat
[55:35] you're probably thinking what difference
[55:37] does it make
[55:39] this side or that side
[55:42] because look I've been here all night
[55:44] and there's no fish there I don't care
[55:46] if I throw in decided mode on that side
[55:48] of all there are no fish
[55:50] but there was something about it that
[55:52] you know Peter Peter said nevertheless
[55:56] you know Peter's knowledge and
[55:59] understanding is what made him doubt and
[56:02] made him believe that there are no fish
[56:04] there right you're understanding your
[56:06] knowledge can be your biggest hindrance
[56:09] amen Peter's knowledge told him there
[56:12] are no fish there and he's convinced in
[56:15] his mind that there's nothing there
[56:17] [Music]
[56:18] now this is the opposite of what I
[56:19] testify right Peter was convinced
[56:22] there's nothing there
[56:24] but Jesus said throw down the net and
[56:28] Peter finds out all right whatever oh
[56:32] yeah I guess meant nothing to lose we've
[56:34] been throwing down all night we've taken
[56:36] nothing but nevertheless at your word
[56:40] you know I wonder how skeptic he really
[56:42] was playing that over I want to be
[56:44] really through it like a trained
[56:46] fisherman Army just kind of like okay
[56:48] whatever
[56:50] you know the human attitude you know the
[56:53] other way we do right okay whatever I'll
[56:56] throw it on the net again come on boys
[56:57] let's throw the net
[56:59] and lo and behold I said it shows to you
[57:03] that even sometimes in your
[57:07] in your skeptical conditions
[57:09] maybe even doubtful God can work
[57:12] miracles
[57:13] he'll do things sometimes and at times
[57:15] when you are not expecting it and there
[57:17] were I'm pretty sure they will not
[57:19] expecting fish
[57:21] remember when the net went down there
[57:23] amen they had so much that the net break
[57:28] Hallelujah why because God said there's
[57:30] something there Peter said that nothing
[57:33] there God said it is something there
[57:34] throw it on the net for a big catch
[57:39] Hallelujah hey man listen why what is it
[57:42] if God says there's fish there he can
[57:45] put them there
[57:47] might not have been a fish there all
[57:49] night yeah and probably wasn't no Peter
[57:52] or they would have called them they
[57:54] would have netted them right because
[57:56] there were trains on their public was no
[57:58] fish there but when Jesus said Put it
[58:00] Down for a great catch
[58:04] but at that moment there was a bunch of
[58:07] fish there
[58:08] why because Jesus said Put it Down for a
[58:10] great draw
[58:12] right put it down for a great catch and
[58:15] Jesus was not upset that if he knew
[58:18] there would be no fish there
[58:20] but he knew if he said that there was
[58:22] going to be fishtail by the time that
[58:24] net comes down oh listen I want to tell
[58:27] you tonight amen God will ask you to do
[58:30] things that just absolutely make no
[58:32] sense to your carnal mind but listen
[58:35] just do what he says
[58:37] just throw the net drop the net whatever
[58:40] he asks you to do say yes Lord it don't
[58:42] make any sense to me bro if that what
[58:44] you want me to do I'll do it right
[58:46] that's a real believer because if God
[58:49] said so he'll put the fish there amen
[58:54] Hallelujah you know there was a time in
[58:57] the Bible
[58:59] amen
[59:02] Elijah II Kings chapter six you remember
[59:05] the Serie dog was trying to catch him
[59:08] and uh
[59:10] they're surrounded the house where he
[59:12] was at
[59:13] and uh
[59:14] Elijah got a good night's sleep
[59:18] I guess the servant did too because he
[59:20] didn't know anybody was there yet
[59:24] next boy in the sermon gets up
[59:27] what's on the coffee pot
[59:28] that's we Americans would do
[59:31] you know and
[59:32] says oh it's a nice day you know maybe
[59:34] maybe he walked over the window he
[59:37] pulled back the chain and ah so you want
[59:39] to relax a little bit and drink my
[59:41] coffee on the balcony
[59:42] Heaven Isaiah and he pulls up the
[59:45] shading
[59:47] there they were
[59:50] the syrians have surrounded them
[59:54] and he goes the last
[59:56] Master yo what will we do
[59:59] right you remember the story
[1:00:02] it goes in there it gets Elijah your
[1:00:05] Elijah's probably still sleeping this
[1:00:07] master master the syrians all around us
[1:00:11] ah
[1:00:13] oh what did you say your hair's eye
[1:00:17] the syrians damn surrounded us
[1:00:20] ah
[1:00:22] don't worry guys I there's more with us
[1:00:26] and there's with them
[1:00:31] I can imagine you Haze eye
[1:00:33] hmm
[1:00:34] us
[1:00:37] one two
[1:00:40] one two
[1:00:42] one two
[1:00:45] Elijah what did you call him Elijah
[1:00:49] yo Elijah probably said they're too
[1:00:51] numerous to come okay here's our
[1:00:54] what are you talking about
[1:00:57] oh Hallelujah he said Lord open his eyes
[1:01:03] Amen in this case it was there
[1:01:07] there was Chariots of Fire horses all
[1:01:10] around that old Prophet brother random
[1:01:12] said around Elijah is it more with us
[1:01:16] than there are with them
[1:01:19] Hallelujah and When God says that you're
[1:01:22] losing interesting Elijah didn't have to
[1:01:24] see them to know they're there
[1:01:28] Hallelujah he knew they were there why
[1:01:32] because he knew that God was going to
[1:01:33] take care of him
[1:01:35] he knew God would protect him he knew
[1:01:37] that the Angels were there he didn't
[1:01:40] have to see them and you don't have to
[1:01:42] see Christ
[1:01:44] to know he's here
[1:01:45] the Bible says when there's two or three
[1:01:47] Gallery in my name I'll be in there I
[1:01:50] don't have to even see him tonight
[1:01:53] but I know he's here why because the
[1:01:57] word said he's here and God wants us to
[1:02:00] believe the word
[1:02:01] I know I came in the name of Jesus I
[1:02:04] hope at least one other person did right
[1:02:06] so that there's two here in the name of
[1:02:08] Jesus Christ then Christ himself is here
[1:02:12] because he said I'll be there I don't
[1:02:15] have to see him oh it would be nice to
[1:02:17] see the pillow fire it'd be nice to see
[1:02:19] him but as the bride of Christ you don't
[1:02:22] have to see him to know he's here
[1:02:25] oh my like they said the Brother Band
[1:02:28] the old Heidi or or he said about the
[1:02:30] how do you know that he loves you
[1:02:32] because he said so
[1:02:36] oh what a theological explanation right
[1:02:38] how do you know God loves you because he
[1:02:40] said so how you know Christ is here
[1:02:43] tonight cause he said so
[1:02:45] Hallelujah therefore our needs can be
[1:02:48] met tonight our healing can take place
[1:02:50] tonight because he promised I am with
[1:02:54] you
[1:02:55] even to the end of the world and that's
[1:02:58] why Elijah knew that they would be
[1:03:00] surrounded by those angels they knew
[1:03:03] they'd be there but the servant didn't
[1:03:05] know he had he had to see
[1:03:09] he was a little bit like Thomas
[1:03:12] you know I often wonder where was Thomas
[1:03:16] on that on that first yo where was he
[1:03:19] the disciples that got together and she
[1:03:23] you know there it is again
[1:03:25] where'd you get my name I'll be there
[1:03:27] missed
[1:03:28] the disciples were together here comes
[1:03:31] Jesus standing in the midst of them
[1:03:33] it says peace
[1:03:35] unto you
[1:03:36] might be paraphrasing a little bit but
[1:03:38] peace
[1:03:40] well
[1:03:42] somehow Thomas didn't get there
[1:03:45] he didn't he didn't get the Instagram
[1:03:47] message
[1:03:50] maybe he had his phone off or maybe his
[1:03:52] Badger was dead or I don't know what it
[1:03:53] was or maybe he was just depressed and
[1:03:55] said I go fishing
[1:03:57] I I don't know what he did but Thomas
[1:03:59] was not in church
[1:04:01] and when when it was over the ones that
[1:04:04] were there listen and you can't you
[1:04:07] can't be in a church in a meeting where
[1:04:09] Jesus is
[1:04:11] and not do something for you
[1:04:14] and when they left church they were
[1:04:16] enthused
[1:04:18] and they went and told Thomas
[1:04:21] the Lord met with us
[1:04:24] we saw him
[1:04:25] and you know this is the problem with
[1:04:27] people that sit on a church
[1:04:29] sorry this is the problems people are
[1:04:32] sitting on a church when they when you
[1:04:34] sit out of church
[1:04:36] and then something said that happened in
[1:04:38] in the church in the service or
[1:04:40] something the Lord that you know you're
[1:04:42] just you're already
[1:04:45] you're already at odds
[1:04:47] kind of right you already have something
[1:04:50] built up in your mind
[1:04:52] so Tom was like
[1:04:55] I don't
[1:04:56] I don't believe it I don't care what you
[1:04:59] guys say I won't believe it unless I see
[1:05:02] him myself
[1:05:05] another way you know if we are not the
[1:05:09] ones
[1:05:10] see it
[1:05:11] I'm not going to believe you
[1:05:14] you told me Christ yeah I don't I don't
[1:05:18] know I'm not gonna believe it I don't
[1:05:20] care
[1:05:21] that was Thomas
[1:05:23] not your pastor now but
[1:05:25] not him all right he's been delivered
[1:05:29] amen but Thomas he was known as
[1:05:39] I love the dog but uh I know it doesn't
[1:05:42] apply to you and it didn't apply to this
[1:05:44] Thomas
[1:05:45] following the next Sabbath
[1:05:48] Hallelujah
[1:05:50] I don't believe but you know what no
[1:05:53] matter how much time I say I don't
[1:05:54] believe it I have to see it I will not
[1:05:57] believe it no matter how much he said
[1:05:59] that the next time they assembled he was
[1:06:01] there
[1:06:03] oh there must have been a little
[1:06:06] something in there
[1:06:07] did come or yo they might have been
[1:06:11] right what they said about the service
[1:06:13] something there was something that he
[1:06:15] said I'm gonna be there next time you
[1:06:18] know the Lord is so gracious he knows
[1:06:20] how to meet everyone no matter what your
[1:06:22] circumstance no matter if you're in
[1:06:24] doubtful whatever frame of mind or
[1:06:28] whatever he knows how to resolve the
[1:06:31] issue
[1:06:32] and just as Jesus Christ is always
[1:06:35] faithful guess what the next step was
[1:06:38] when Thomas was there Jesus showed up
[1:06:41] and he said the same words he did the
[1:06:43] week before peace
[1:06:48] and he knew Thomas
[1:06:51] what they say Thomas
[1:06:54] thrust your hands on my side while he
[1:06:57] knew what because some people just have
[1:06:59] to see it
[1:07:00] right some people are made up in such a
[1:07:03] way they have to see it to believe it
[1:07:07] but listen we're not from Missouri
[1:07:10] show me
[1:07:12] yo that that statement ain't true anyhow
[1:07:16] show me and I'll believe it that's a lie
[1:07:19] many people have been shown and they
[1:07:21] still don't believe
[1:07:23] so that's not true
[1:07:27] oh what did the Bible say blessed our
[1:07:30] lady have not seen and yet believe
[1:07:33] I would love to be in the meetings of
[1:07:35] brother Bradham would you love the
[1:07:37] medium
[1:07:38] when you've loved to see the healing
[1:07:40] campaigns to see all those great things
[1:07:43] but how much greater what you have
[1:07:46] because you know what there's thousands
[1:07:48] of people that were in those meetings
[1:07:49] and saw those things and they're
[1:07:51] nowheres around today and they don't
[1:07:54] they don't even know that there is a
[1:07:55] message but you know there's a message
[1:07:59] Creator is it for you to have not seen
[1:08:01] those things yet you believe
[1:08:04] and the Bible says that some of them
[1:08:06] believed on their word listen listen
[1:08:09] let's just be honest there are some
[1:08:11] people that never may never see the
[1:08:14] supernatural in that magnitude
[1:08:18] no doubt we won't
[1:08:21] but God is still a supernatural God he's
[1:08:24] still he still works the Miracles but
[1:08:26] just because I don't see those things
[1:08:28] like you think we should sometimes
[1:08:31] I listen the Bible says I'm with you
[1:08:33] always even at the end
[1:08:35] that's my promise
[1:08:38] greater he that's in me to he that's in
[1:08:40] the world is that right
[1:08:41] so I don't have to see Yo the properly
[1:08:44] God made a statement he said he said if
[1:08:46] God would never do nothing else for you
[1:08:52] it you still
[1:08:55] will love him and believe him
[1:08:58] that's a Believer and Christ never if
[1:09:01] you never saw a supernatural
[1:09:03] even that God never healed you God never
[1:09:06] did anything for you you still serve him
[1:09:09] that's a real believer
[1:09:11] Hallelujah but oh let me say that I know
[1:09:14] how wonderful it is when you can see him
[1:09:17] do things when he does something for you
[1:09:19] listen when Christ does something for
[1:09:21] you it will mean more to you
[1:09:25] amen when those words are spoken there
[1:09:27] is nothing there just like sister meaty
[1:09:31] you remember
[1:09:32] there's no tuber there
[1:09:35] the doctor said there's no tumor there
[1:09:38] now that statement means a whole lot
[1:09:40] more to say to meter than it does to me
[1:09:44] Hallelujah that's why when you're safe
[1:09:46] from your sins and the Bible says you
[1:09:49] are forgiven of your sins if that is you
[1:09:51] personally it means more to you than
[1:09:54] anybody else
[1:09:55] and you cannot explain it to them but
[1:09:58] you know
[1:10:00] you know there's nothing there
[1:10:02] Hallelujah
[1:10:04] oh my Lord open his eyes
[1:10:08] have his eyes opened the hills were
[1:10:12] covered
[1:10:13] and Elijah walks out there amen he says
[1:10:16] who are you looking for is fellas oh
[1:10:19] we're looking for Elijah come here I'll
[1:10:21] show you about where he's at
[1:10:24] Elijah leading them to Elijah
[1:10:28] he got it right there into the camp
[1:10:32] right right down there to camp and daddy
[1:10:36] they opened their eyes and then he goes

[1:11:23] that means you're thinking
[1:11:25] I hope
[1:11:26] hope you're not sleeping
[1:11:30] I could be like the story Paul told
[1:11:32] before servers
[1:11:34] zombies preacher
[1:11:36] and if you you don't know anything about
[1:11:38] the obviously don't mean much but over
[1:11:40] half the congregation is sleeping by the
[1:11:42] time the service is over
[1:11:44] so he was preaching against him and a
[1:11:46] lot of them were sleeping
[1:11:48] so the preacher just decided to stop
[1:11:51] preaching
[1:11:52] and he just still didn't say nothing
[1:11:56] and one by one the head started coming
[1:11:58] up
[1:11:59] there was nothing to wake up
[1:12:02] wonder why he's in preaching so I guess

[1:16:11] probably going to reduce the point of
[1:16:13] every day because you will not always be
[1:16:16] on the mountain dog
[1:16:18] oh but remember that song the god of the
[1:16:22] mountain is still God of alley
[1:16:24] the god of the good times is still the
[1:16:27] god of the bad times you know that's one
[1:16:30] thing I found out through the cancer
[1:16:31] thing with my wife I said Yo God is
[1:16:33] still God it doesn't matter what comes
[1:16:36] goes it don't matter what the outcome is
[1:16:38] if the Lord choose to take her home amen
[1:16:41] he still got overall it really doesn't
[1:16:45] matter but I thank God today she's with
[1:16:47] me Hallelujah I thank God for what he's
[1:16:50] done but it's not based on what we feel
[1:16:53] what we see because what you see is very
[1:16:56] disappointing
[1:16:59] come on folks very disappointing even
[1:17:03] can I say this
[1:17:06] we are very disappointed even many times
[1:17:08] in one another
[1:17:11] right we think we know one another and
[1:17:13] then you know a brother or sister will
[1:17:16] do something like oh my goodness how
[1:17:18] could they do that they claim to be
[1:17:20] Christians and you know yeah you get
[1:17:22] disappointed
[1:17:24] is that right
[1:17:25] life is full of disappointments you see
[1:17:29] brother Bill I come to get encouraged
[1:17:33] I'm sorry I just feel at home
[1:17:36] you gotta it gets dangerous when the
[1:17:37] preacher feels at home but but yeah I I
[1:17:41] want to be a girl life is full of
[1:17:43] disappointments oh no I'm discouraged it
[1:17:46] is listen you might as well know reality
[1:17:51] and know that it is full of
[1:17:52] disappointments but those
[1:17:54] disappointments
[1:17:56] are nothing
[1:17:58] in light of the promise of God
[1:18:01] are nothing in the light of what God
[1:18:03] Said
[1:18:04] I
[1:18:05] have given you the victory
[1:18:09] Hallelujah disappointments come and go
[1:18:11] with the problems of God stays forever
[1:18:14] I'll be with you always even in you to
[1:18:17] the end of the world
[1:18:18] he had Believers and baptized shall be
[1:18:21] saved
[1:18:22] these are promises so we don't look at
[1:18:25] those things that happen that's just
[1:18:27] part of our life and this is part of our
[1:18:29] our the the moment of our character you
[1:18:33] must go through things the whole
[1:18:35] character in you
[1:18:37] you'll never have character about having
[1:18:39] everything is the life of ease and just
[1:18:41] flowed through no you gotta have
[1:18:44] opposition sometimes you gotta have
[1:18:46] something that will press against you
[1:18:49] and cause you to make hard decisions
[1:18:54] some of you know what we're talking
[1:18:55] about you got to go through it but when
[1:18:58] you come out the other side that's why I
[1:19:00] always say oh devil you're so dumb devil
[1:19:03] the devil sense all these things on you
[1:19:05] and all these troubles and all these
[1:19:07] trials every time you come out on the
[1:19:09] other side you're stronger than you were
[1:19:10] before
[1:19:12] so he's he's only working against
[1:19:16] himself
[1:19:17] oh that's why you know that song God
[1:19:21] will make this child a blessing though
[1:19:23] he sends me to my knees Hallelujah you
[1:19:27] might look at it as a child but why
[1:19:28] don't you we shouldn't look at our
[1:19:30] trials as a blessing
[1:19:32] I I know I know we don't but I know
[1:19:35] we're gonna get down our knees oh God
[1:19:37] send me a trial
[1:19:39] how many have ever prayed that
[1:19:43] he's honest
[1:19:46] but you know he ain't good exactly what
[1:19:48] all the rest of us but say I don't
[1:19:49] either you know there's some things in
[1:19:51] life you don't have to pray for
[1:19:55] Charles is one of them they are promised
[1:20:00] you know trials are promised to the
[1:20:02] believer
[1:20:03] so I don't have to pray Lord send the
[1:20:06] child it's going to come in the right
[1:20:07] time
[1:20:08] and it'll come in a way that you did not
[1:20:10] expect
[1:20:11] so we'll get the oh God send the trial I
[1:20:14] just want to prove the devil I'm a
[1:20:16] Christian
[1:20:17] nah we're not that foolish
[1:20:20] no no we wanted to sometimes I want to
[1:20:23] keep our mouth shut right
[1:20:25] yo I've thought about Joe think about it
[1:20:29] this is just being as a man now what was
[1:20:32] God thinking
[1:20:34] yo here you have a man according to the
[1:20:37] Bible is perfect job was perfect
[1:20:40] the Bible says in all his ways
[1:20:42] he ate evil he was perfect he offered
[1:20:45] sacrifices everything perfect
[1:20:48] Yo God had a man right where he wanted
[1:20:50] him
[1:20:51] and then
[1:20:53] he points enough to the devil
[1:20:56] you know if it was me if I was God I
[1:20:58] would hide him away right well I got one
[1:21:01] perfect now I'm gonna make sure I don't
[1:21:03] want to get a hold of him
[1:21:07] but not God
[1:21:10] says
[1:21:12] have you
[1:21:14] have you considered
[1:21:16] my servant job
[1:21:19] uh
[1:21:20] I wonder you know job
[1:21:24] I I don't know if Joe heard that
[1:21:26] conversation or not
[1:21:28] you consider myself I don't know if he
[1:21:30] did or not but if he would have heard it
[1:21:31] Joe would have probably says oh no
[1:21:35] Lord don't say that
[1:21:39] but I don't know if you heard or not
[1:21:40] have you considered my servant job
[1:21:44] you know what the answer was yeah
[1:21:47] I've considered him
[1:21:50] but
[1:21:52] there's a hedge around him
[1:21:54] I wonder how many times the devil
[1:21:57] consider you
[1:21:59] I wonder how many times you wanted to
[1:22:01] attack you but he could
[1:22:02] because there was a pillow fire around
[1:22:05] you
[1:22:07] Hallelujah you remember Daniel in the
[1:22:10] wise then
[1:22:11] think about it
[1:22:13] those lions were they were they would
[1:22:15] not feed them for days
[1:22:18] for the the reason of capital punishment
[1:22:21] of throwing somebody in there they want
[1:22:23] them to be hungry so when they throw a
[1:22:25] man in there he that would just tear
[1:22:28] them apart eat them up in no time
[1:22:30] and so you know here are these Lions
[1:22:32] they're hungry and you bring Daniel and
[1:22:35] the Bible said that they listen they
[1:22:37] hated Daniels or they were gentle
[1:22:40] they were like you know let them down
[1:22:42] easy so they don't get hurt
[1:22:44] you think they were worried about that
[1:22:45] when they were going to want to kill
[1:22:46] them
[1:22:47] you're worried about him getting hurt
[1:22:49] the Bible said they threw him in
[1:22:52] other words you know they just open like
[1:22:54] a like but say the hatch or whatever yo
[1:22:57] you pulled back the gate the lines in
[1:23:00] the Daniel and they know
[1:23:02] they know when that door opens up
[1:23:04] brother Paul they know food is coming
[1:23:07] Uber is at the door
[1:23:09] Hallelujah and that door opens up and
[1:23:12] all the lines like
[1:23:14] you know and they take Daniel
[1:23:17] they throw them in there
[1:23:20] and for whatever reason
[1:23:23] it never bothered him
[1:23:26] I believe when they threw Daniel I
[1:23:29] believe there was a fire
[1:23:31] a pillar of light that went before him
[1:23:33] and you know animals are scared of Fire
[1:23:36] right
[1:23:38] so when they saw this fire
[1:23:40] they just backed up
[1:23:44] and the Bible said they said there all
[1:23:46] night
[1:23:47] Daniel's in there all night
[1:23:51] and the Lions never come close to him
[1:23:54] oh that's Daniel but how many times did
[1:23:57] it happen for you that you don't even
[1:23:59] know yo Daniel probably I don't know
[1:24:01] maybe he didn't even know the pillar of
[1:24:03] fire was there I have no idea I don't
[1:24:05] know what he seen but you know perhaps
[1:24:07] he had a good night's rest I don't know
[1:24:10] I don't think you have a good night's
[1:24:12] rest in a dance like that or not but but
[1:24:14] you know maybe you had a good night's
[1:24:16] rest but I know one person that didn't
[1:24:17] that was the king
[1:24:20] he loved Daniel he really didn't want to
[1:24:23] do that but he was trapped into that
[1:24:25] right and so he couldn't sleep all night
[1:24:28] so and you know what people do when he
[1:24:29] can't sleep all night to get up early
[1:24:32] oh might as well get up I can't sleep so
[1:24:35] he goes out and you know it's amazing he
[1:24:38] goes out there and he said and he he
[1:24:41] says oh Daniel
[1:24:45] was your god listen to these words
[1:24:47] here's the key
[1:24:49] was your God whom you serve continually
[1:24:55] not once in a while the God who you
[1:24:59] serve continually was he able to keep
[1:25:02] you
[1:25:03] and he waited
[1:25:06] can you imagine the
[1:25:08] suspense
[1:25:09] he wanted to hear the voice of Daniel
[1:25:13] but I don't know if he expected to hear
[1:25:14] it or not but
[1:25:17] something drove him out there to say oh
[1:25:19] yo Daniel was your God able
[1:25:24] your God
[1:25:26] your God your God was he able to keep
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:31] who you served continually
[1:25:34] and Daniel says
[1:25:37] oh King
[1:25:40] live forever
[1:25:42] my God who I serve continually has kept
[1:25:46] me all night
[1:25:48] I don't know
[1:25:52] I don't I don't know that King ever
[1:25:55] danced in the spirit or not but he
[1:25:56] probably did then
[1:25:58] Glory I love to hear Daniel's voice
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:06] what
[1:26:08] listen
[1:26:11] it kept Daniel all night
[1:26:16] one person
[1:26:18] ah
[1:26:20] so this shows you the difference between
[1:26:21] Believers and unbelievers
[1:26:23] so they brought Daniel out
[1:26:26] and so what did the king do he commanded
[1:26:29] that those that threw him in
[1:26:33] their family
[1:26:37] that they throw them in the den
[1:26:40] and you know what the Bible says
[1:26:43] that
[1:26:45] um obviously paraphrasing but like every
[1:26:47] bone was broken they were consumed
[1:26:49] before they hit the ground
[1:26:51] and I don't know how many family members
[1:26:53] it was but it was you know a numerous
[1:26:55] obviously you know the families the ones
[1:26:58] and their families so it was a number of
[1:27:00] people and these Lions devoured them all
[1:27:03] before they hit the ground when they
[1:27:05] couldn't get one man
[1:27:08] Hallelujah because that one man had a
[1:27:11] pillar of Fire
[1:27:13] that was protecting him
[1:27:15] oh I tell you it pays to be a believer
[1:27:18] it pays to believe just like the three
[1:27:21] Hebrew children he said we will not bow
[1:27:23] we will not bear we will not burn
[1:27:26] we will not bow down the God of this age
[1:27:29] and they had the furnace he said seven
[1:27:32] times hotter threw him in there
[1:27:38] but there was room for four people
[1:27:44] hallelujah oh let me tell you something
[1:27:46] that far the Bible says it the ones that
[1:27:49] that threw him in they even it couldn't
[1:27:52] yo
[1:27:54] they killed them
[1:27:55] it was so hot
[1:27:57] where was
[1:28:00] that Fourth Man
[1:28:02] he had to be there before he ever
[1:28:04] entered the furnace
[1:28:06] because the others parents and
[1:28:10] the three were thrown in
[1:28:14] and the King looked in there
[1:28:18] and he rubbed his eyes
[1:28:21] he thought he was seeing things
[1:28:24] this is bye he says hey he says I'm a
[1:28:27] little confused here
[1:28:29] didn't we throw people at three people
[1:28:31] in there
[1:28:33] that's what yes oh King we did we threw
[1:28:35] three of those Fanatics in there
[1:28:38] he said well I don't know
[1:28:42] you might have thrown three in there but
[1:28:44] I see four
[1:28:47] I see four and the fourth one looks like
[1:28:50] the son of God
[1:28:52] how did that King know what the Son of
[1:28:55] God looks like
[1:28:57] God must have revealed it to him the
[1:29:00] Fourth Man it looked like the Son of God
[1:29:03] oh listen I want to tell you tonight no
[1:29:06] matter where you go what you go through
[1:29:07] you just remember
[1:29:09] that Fourth Man will always be there
[1:29:12] you might not sin they might not have
[1:29:14] saw him amen but they knew he was there
[1:29:17] not only were they in there but they
[1:29:19] were loosed and they were walking around
[1:29:21] I want to know that all the fire of the
[1:29:25] enemy can do is lose your chains
[1:29:28] oh that the trials of Life can do to
[1:29:31] lose your chains that fire only set them
[1:29:34] free
[1:29:36] Hallelujah and then he said now I know
[1:29:40] there's no God but Jehovah
[1:29:42] hallelujah oh listen brothers and
[1:29:45] sisters
[1:29:46] hey man let me just go I'll go close

[1:34:22] Hallelujah and to know that amen God
[1:34:26] sent me a message
[1:34:28] to say Bill you are free
[1:34:33] so this girl
[1:34:35] you know got into the classical grouping
[1:34:38] they
[1:34:39] wanted to get together she wanted to get
[1:34:41] give to all the ladies at church and uh
[1:34:44] you know how the sisters do and come
[1:34:46] together and they talk when they chatter
[1:34:48] and you know gets a little noisy
[1:34:49] sometimes right sisters and so and so uh
[1:34:53] she thought well you know I can't you
[1:34:55] know what I'm gonna do with Dad
[1:34:58] you know he's that old type of Believers
[1:35:00] you know he gets excited when he reads
[1:35:02] the Bible he shouts and prays with the
[1:35:04] Lord and ah you know we're Christians
[1:35:06] but we don't want that
[1:35:08] something wrong
[1:35:10] Sergio what am I going to do with that
[1:35:11] she said well
[1:35:13] so I said oh I I know what I'll do I'll
[1:35:15] fix him a place up in the attic
[1:35:18] it's quite a place to put your dad isn't
[1:35:20] it here Dad I'm gonna put your daddy
[1:35:24] as soon as you fix the place up there
[1:35:25] clear the other place and set him a
[1:35:27] place up there where you could sit down
[1:35:29] and
[1:35:30] then she thought you know
[1:35:32] I can't give him a Bible
[1:35:34] because if you read the Bible there if
[1:35:36] you like to see me up there as he does
[1:35:38] here
[1:35:39] yeah hello that's a lesson for uh no
[1:35:43] matter where you are you read the Bible
[1:35:44] the God Church wherever it has the same
[1:35:47] effect so he's so well I can't give him
[1:35:49] the Bible
[1:35:51] so she said I'll give him an old
[1:35:53] geography or whatever it was book and he
[1:35:56] can read that and I said so here Dad
[1:35:58] here you know the day finally came to
[1:36:01] hear the book you know I know and you
[1:36:03] know she made it sound like it was for
[1:36:05] his good you know yeah you know I know
[1:36:08] that you don't want to be around all
[1:36:09] these ladies
[1:36:10] so I fixed your plays in the attic and
[1:36:12] here's a geography book and you can you
[1:36:14] can read that while you sit up there
[1:36:15] okay no problem you know he didn't care
[1:36:18] right and so he comes up there and all
[1:36:21] the the sisters came over you know they
[1:36:23] started drinking their lemonade and just
[1:36:25] having a good old time and they're in
[1:36:26] the middle of all their discussions or
[1:36:28] whatever they're talking about you know
[1:36:29] and uh and uh all of a sudden the
[1:36:32] Raptors started shaking it was a noise
[1:36:34] from up top just going on
[1:36:37] and she thought
[1:36:38] what in the world happened to him you
[1:36:40] know he just carried on you know if you
[1:36:43] ever been on the second floor of a house
[1:36:45] and somebody gets excited or something
[1:36:46] falls on the floor you downstairs boom
[1:36:49] you know and so here he is you'll
[1:36:52] probably dance around up there in the
[1:36:54] Attic Lord hallelujah
[1:36:57] oh oh so embarrassed so she goes up
[1:37:01] there you know Dad Dad what's the matter
[1:37:04] he said oh I I'm just reading here and
[1:37:07] she says well that's not the Bible
[1:37:08] you're reading
[1:37:11] he said I know it I know it
[1:37:15] [Laughter]
[1:37:16] but listen brother and sister he had the
[1:37:18] Bible here
[1:37:20] he didn't have to have the Bible had the
[1:37:22] same results she he said I know it's not
[1:37:25] I know it's not but he said but you know
[1:37:27] what oh I like this I was reading in the
[1:37:30] Bible the other day
[1:37:32] that's why it pays to read the Bible
[1:37:34] because at the right time God will bring
[1:37:36] him back to you Hallelujah as I was
[1:37:40] reading in the Bible the other day where
[1:37:41] where it says that God put our sins in
[1:37:44] the sea of forgetfulness
[1:37:47] and he says you know what he said I was
[1:37:50] reading here in this book you gave me
[1:37:51] that they can't pass the bottom of the
[1:37:53] ocean
[1:37:56] and he said just think wherever they are
[1:37:59] they're still going and he got excited
[1:38:03] right oh listen he what he had a
[1:38:06] revelation that his sins were gone I
[1:38:09] think that's the revelation we need
[1:38:10] sometimes and then to realize that our
[1:38:13] sins are gone and it made him happy
[1:38:15] whether the attic the living room
[1:38:17] wherever he was whether he had the Bible
[1:38:19] or not it made him happy because he knew
[1:38:22] they were gone just think I was reading
[1:38:25] in the Bible the other day
[1:38:26] they can't find the bottom of the ocean
[1:38:29] wherever they are they're still going
[1:38:33] to God there is nothing there
[1:38:38] have you confessed your sins
[1:38:41] have you confessed your sins I can tell
[1:38:43] you tonight there's nothing there
[1:38:46] I don't care what your brother says or
[1:38:48] his sister oh yeah I saw what they did
[1:38:50] there's nothing there
[1:38:53] I'm not talking about just covering up
[1:38:54] sitting going on I'm not talking about
[1:38:56] that but you've confessed your sins
[1:38:59] truly confess them we can say there is
[1:39:02] nothing there
[1:39:04] Hallelujah
[1:39:06] oh my that means more to me than if I
[1:39:09] had a tumor in his edge of nothing there
[1:39:11] why because the tumor could come back
[1:39:14] but when my sins are gone
[1:39:18] they're not coming back
[1:39:21] Hallelujah there is nothing there I want
[1:39:25] to say to you tonight let's Stand
[1:39:27] Together
[1:39:30] oh like Jesus told the woman
[1:39:33] your sins
[1:39:35] which are many
[1:39:37] are all forgiven
[1:39:40] if you've confessed your sins you've
[1:39:42] come God's way
[1:39:44] your sins which are made are all
[1:39:47] forgiven
[1:39:49] oh
[1:39:51] my brother my sister that's the most
[1:39:54] beautiful words you can ever hear
[1:39:56] I don't care we can talk about the seals
[1:39:58] and we can talk about this and we all
[1:40:00] like those things that I I believe
[1:40:02] that's our word that is our it's the
[1:40:05] Seven Seals but it really comes down to
[1:40:07] even the seals comes down to a
[1:40:09] revelation that it's like like the like
[1:40:13] you ain't dropping into bleach
[1:40:16] yes there's nothing there look at that
[1:40:19] bleach and find that drop of ink
[1:40:22] you cannot find it because it's not
[1:40:23] there the ink becomes part of the bleach

[1:40:38] righteousness of God the Bible says
