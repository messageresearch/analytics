[41:32] yourselves and and just talk about how
[41:34] the Lord's blessed you it's such such a
[41:36] great
[41:37] opportunity um tonight I've had a couple
[41:41] people I talk to actually request that I
[41:44] give my testimony so it's going to be a
[41:46] little bit of a different pace tonight
[41:48] and I hope that's okay with everyone um
[41:51] and sorry brother um you asked for a
[41:53] scripture and it just one just came and
[41:55] I was back there so I didn't give you
[41:57] you the scripture but uh I do want to
[42:00] read the scripture before we go into
[42:02] that uh but before we do that let just
[42:05] go ahead and
[42:07] pray Jesus we just we thank you uh
[42:11] you're just you're such a wonderful
[42:12] Mighty God and and as as we heard this
[42:16] morning we overcome by the blood of the
[42:19] lamb and the word of Our Testimony Lord
[42:21] so so tonight might be a little bit of a
[42:24] different pace but we still Lord ask
[42:26] that everything said be said that
[42:29] glorifies you Lord uh nothing added that
[42:36] would detour the people from realizing
[42:39] that you honor and all the glory Lord
[42:42] Jesus we just thank you Lord God for
[42:45] bringing us where we are today each and
[42:47] every one of us thank you for being a
[42:49] kind loving close
[42:52] father we just ask you bless the reading
[42:55] of the word and we ask these things in
[42:57] Jesus name
[42:59] amen so I I I would like to read John
[43:03] 10 uh 28 John
[43:15] 10:28 and it says and I give unto them
[43:18] eternal
[43:20] life and they shall never
[43:22] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[43:26] my hand
[43:27] and I've never thought to put a title to
[43:29] my testimony but if I would tonight and
[43:33] this may become a sermon someday but I
[43:35] would call it safe in his
[43:39] hand thank you Lord for the reading of
[43:42] your word y all may have your seat
[43:46] um so again we just thank the
[43:48] opportunity um
[43:50] definitely uh definitely appreciate the
[43:53] fellowship here
[43:54] in um such a great lovely a bunch of
[43:57] people really enjoyed the fellowship I
[43:59] got with uh the berer family um they cut
[44:03] out a little early but uh really look
[44:05] forward to spending some time with them
[44:07] in the future um and I've made some
[44:09] friends along the way some of you I
[44:11] didn't get to speak to and I do
[44:13] apologize just trying to make my rounds
[44:16] but um so we want to start off and we
[44:18] want to we want to just talk about how
[44:21] we got here how I got here where I am
[44:24] today um because I did not grow up in
[44:27] the message I did not grow up in church
[44:31] um and so to think where I am today
[44:34] sometimes I feel a lot like blind bmus
[44:37] and you know you just you cry out and
[44:40] the Lord answers and so we'll start off
[44:43] and I'll talk about my childhood and how
[44:45] I got here where I am so um won't keep
[44:49] you long I will set my timer this time
[44:51] so I don't go too long this is something
[44:52] I could talk about for quite a while the
[44:54] Lord has definitely done a lot of things
[44:57] to to bless me and my family um and uh
[45:02] praise the Lord so so when I was young
[45:06] um I I did like I said I did not grow up
[45:09] in a Christian Home whatsoever um I grew
[45:11] up in a rough environment a rough family
[45:16] um my parents divorced when I was young
[45:20] um there's some things there you know
[45:23] they they battled with they went through
[45:25] but they split when I was very young and
[45:28] uh so you know those types of things
[45:30] some of the the first memories I've had
[45:31] to deal with one thing I like to add um
[45:36] when I was about 6 years old six or
[45:38] seven right before my mom uh left uh we
[45:43] had a neighbor and they had a love swing
[45:47] and if you can kind of Envision those
[45:48] like a frame style love
[45:51] swings uh those neighbors left for
[45:54] vacation and so they took the swing off
[45:57] the love they knew the little boy next
[46:00] door would probably jump on it and break
[46:01] it or something this was the little boy
[46:04] so what did the little boy do I climbed
[46:06] it anyway um so I climbed this A-frame
[46:09] love swing with no swing on it and I was
[46:12] sitting on the top bar there was someone
[46:14] across the
[46:17] street and I was yelling something back
[46:20] and I was sitting on top eating a
[46:21] sandwich and I remember thinking in my
[46:24] head I'm going to jump off I'm gonna
[46:27] swing on this I'm gonna bite my sandwich
[46:30] I'm cool I remember thinking that so I
[46:33] tried it just went to grab it missed
[46:38] completely the chain the hook actually
[46:40] went into my neck and a little
[46:43] six-year-old me was just hanging there
[46:45] by a chain in my neck and I was swinging
[46:49] and just watching cars go by and uh
[46:51] honestly I don't know how long I was
[46:53] swinging there the neighbor from down
[46:56] the road happened to be walking their
[46:58] dog around the block and they saw me and
[47:02] they came up and looked real close I
[47:04] think they thought that the hook was in
[47:06] my shirt like Tangled in my shirt or
[47:08] something but when they saw it in my
[47:10] neck they ran and started pounding on
[47:12] the door to try to get somebody's
[47:14] attention and it seemed like forever
[47:16] nobody answered the door we come to find
[47:19] out my mom was in the shower so she
[47:21] wasn't answering she ended up coming out
[47:24] um in a towel seeing me hanging by my
[47:27] neck by this chain and ripped me off
[47:29] without a thought threw me in the car
[47:31] and rushed me to the hospital so the
[47:34] doctor said how it didn't hit your
[47:37] jugular vein especially when she ripped
[47:39] you off is an absolute miracle I always
[47:42] tell people it wasn't it wasn't gravity
[47:44] that was holding me up right it was it
[47:47] was definitely not gravity that was
[47:48] helping me there was the Lord's hand
[47:50] that was helping me there and I add that
[47:52] because a little bit later there's
[47:54] something somewhat significant um to
[47:57] this testimony um because actually there
[48:00] was some Deliverance that happened in in
[48:02] in these churches um that I found much
[48:05] later in life because when I became a
[48:08] Christian that message churches existed
[48:11] so you know I grew up like I said in a
[48:14] rough home it was a rough environment my
[48:16] dad was abusive um physically mentally
[48:19] um he tried to get me to fight him he'd
[48:21] come in drunk and and punch me and stuff
[48:24] like that you know it's just not a great
[48:26] home and he cared more about women you
[48:29] know things like that so as a little kid
[48:32] I'm sitting here thinking if you can
[48:34] imagine why did my mom leave and why did
[48:37] my mom leave me with this guy we just
[48:39] didn't have a good relationship it was
[48:41] it was
[48:42] uh and so you know I leave a lot of that
[48:46] when I was about we'll say 15 years
[48:51] old one
[48:53] night I was actually at a party of all
[48:57] places and I was what you call
[48:59] babysitting I was making sure the the
[49:01] people there weren't you know sticking
[49:03] forks and lockets and stuff like that
[49:05] and burning the house down or whatever
[49:07] so I was in charge of making sure all
[49:10] the people got thrown into bed when you
[49:13] know the time came for pass out so I did
[49:16] that I was pretty violently throwing
[49:17] them into bed I was just yipping them
[49:19] here and throwing them and I remember I
[49:23] sat down on the couch and I started
[49:25] crying and I just said God if you exist
[49:29] just show me because up to that point I
[49:32] didn't believe in a God I said if a God
[49:35] exists if a God exists I want nothing to
[49:38] do with him because he gave me this life
[49:40] like why would he do that and so the
[49:44] fact that something broke in me we know
[49:48] when I say the Deep calleth to the Deep
[49:50] we know what that means but that's what
[49:52] was going on with me broke something in
[49:55] me was calling out
[49:57] and uh
[50:00] slamer things in my testimony they're a
[50:03] little bit they're a little bit out
[50:05] there um the Lord dealt with
[50:08] me very not that he hasn't dealt with
[50:11] everybody supernaturally so I'm not
[50:13] undermining when I say that but the Lord
[50:15] dealt with me very supernaturally in a
[50:17] lot of ways so um just disclaimer some
[50:20] of it's pretty pretty out there
[50:23] but so I I cried out and he immediately
[50:26] started to show me who assisted um I
[50:30] started I started feeling like I was
[50:31] being pulled in two different directions
[50:33] right away and from that moment on
[50:36] things just started to change little bit
[50:38] by little bit he would do things to show
[50:40] me there is a God something exists you
[50:45] know out there and uh one of those
[50:48] things happened uh again when I was
[50:51] about 15 years old I'd go to school I'd
[50:54] come home and I'd have that you know
[50:55] that rough relationship ship with my dad
[50:58] one day he just randomly seemingly asks
[51:01] me he's like why are you always walking
[51:03] around here so depressed and I looked at
[51:05] him I'm like you you actually you want
[51:08] to know like I I I wanted to actually
[51:11] talk to the man and I thought that that
[51:13] was opportunity to do so and I said
[51:15] honestly Dad I think about death a lot
[51:19] and he said oh you want to kill yourself
[51:22] huh I don't want to do that that's not
[51:25] what I meant I just think about that a
[51:26] lot that's what's depressing me and so
[51:29] he goes in his room and he grabs a
[51:32] shotgun and he hands me the shotgun he
[51:34] says go ahead do it kill yourself and
[51:37] I'm just shocked cuz like I did not
[51:39] expect this at all I expected yeah we're
[51:41] going to have a heart to heart and we're
[51:43] going to work some stuff no he hands me
[51:45] a shotgun and says go ahead and kill
[51:47] yourself so I look at him I'm like are
[51:50] are you serious he's like actually go
[51:53] outside yourself because I don't want to
[51:55] clean up a mess I'm just
[51:57] like so I handed it back to him and I
[52:00] gave him some not so nice words again
[52:02] not a Christian at the time not so nice
[52:04] words were in my vocabulary so I went
[52:07] upstairs and uh uh again this is a
[52:11] little touchy so disclaimer okay but uh
[52:15] I went upstairs and I wrote a note to my
[52:17] dad and I said I'm up here hanging
[52:19] around don't send the kids after me and
[52:23] uh so what he'd normally do is he'd send
[52:24] my brothers and sisters up to say hey
[52:26] it's dinner time you know so don't send
[52:29] the kids after me I threw the note at
[52:31] the bottom of the
[52:32] stairs and uh I went upstairs and I
[52:35] grabbed uh a long sweater a long
[52:40] sweatshirt and in my room uh there was
[52:42] an attic access you know those ones
[52:45] where you push up out of the way I don't
[52:47] know if you've got them in your home or
[52:49] whatever but you know I pushed it out of
[52:51] the way and I got up on a chair and I
[52:53] looked and I tied the one end of the
[52:55] shirt to the rafter to the truss and uh
[52:59] pulled it real tight and shut
[53:01] the put the other end around my neck and
[53:04] I kicked the chair out from under me and
[53:07] I woke up on the ground like okay so I
[53:11] pick up end of the shirt and it's still
[53:14] tied and my first thought was great I
[53:17] broke the truss now he's really going to
[53:20] kill me and so I get up on the chair and
[53:23] I go to push the attic axis out of the
[53:25] way and the first thing I notice is
[53:27] there's no big hole in the wall I would
[53:28] have thought that if it pulled through
[53:30] it would just decimate the wall you know
[53:32] or the the ceiling there's no big hole I
[53:35] get up there and I look and the truss is
[53:38] perfectly intact and so I look at the
[53:41] one behind it thinking like oh maybe I
[53:42] tied it to that one and it's perfectly
[53:44] intact and I cannot explain it but it
[53:47] was God and and even at the time is as
[53:52] odd as this might sound I didn't ATT
[53:55] attribute it to to God I took it off and
[53:58] I looked at it I'm like well I'm not
[53:59] doing that again and I just moved on
[54:01] with my day I didn't take into
[54:05] consideration that it was God
[54:07] supernaturally preserving me for for a
[54:10] reason and so
[54:14] when when I would go back to
[54:20] school there would be things that would
[54:22] occur where I I would be walking and
[54:25] suddenly I'd see something that you know
[54:27] maybe you call it a vision or something
[54:29] I would see something and things were
[54:31] like that were happening quite a bit and
[54:34] I would come home and I would just I
[54:36] would talk you know to myself we'll say
[54:38] quote unquote I would talk to myself
[54:40] thinking like what in the world is going
[54:43] on and I'd be asking these questions and
[54:45] I would be getting answers
[54:48] and one day when I got home from school
[54:53] I sat down on my bed I had a little
[54:56] Houton for a bed and I heard this
[54:59] noise and this noise sounded
[55:05] like I was like what is that noise and
[55:08] so I look out the window and I think in
[55:12] my head if Leaf is moving on the tree
[55:16] I'm going to say it's just the wind
[55:17] blowing through the screen and it was
[55:19] The Bluest skies and not a single leaf
[55:22] was moving and I sat and I watched
[55:25] nothing was moving I went and I sat back
[55:27] down and then I heard it
[55:31] again and I got up and I'm like maybe
[55:34] maybe someone's vacuuming and I went
[55:36] downstairs and I looked and nobody was
[55:39] even in the living room so I go back
[55:40] upstairs to my room and and I sit back
[55:44] down and I hear that noise
[55:46] again and this time it doesn't go away
[55:49] it just gets louder and louder and the
[55:51] presence gets greater and greater and
[55:54] I'm on the futon ing up cuz I have never
[55:58] experienced anything like this before
[56:01] and it felt like the presence hit me it
[56:04] I'm sure you've all felt it in a church
[56:06] service where that presence just hits
[56:08] you the Lord just makes himself real to
[56:11] you so I stand up and I'm like I'm just
[56:14] going to go take a nap I'm just take a
[56:16] nap something's wrong so I went to go
[56:19] jump on my bed to take a nap and again
[56:22] like I said you got to you got to pretty
[56:25] well believe in natural here with me for
[56:28] a moment I never put this together
[56:30] before I was always like why did this
[56:32] happen but I did get an answer and it's
[56:34] pretty it's pretty interesting to jump
[56:36] on my bed and I never hit the bed
[56:39] something stood me back up and walked me
[56:41] to the mirror and I always wondered like
[56:44] that seems extremely odd extremely
[56:48] far-fetched but I was reading one time
[56:51] in one of brother brandom's meetings
[56:53] talked about someone sitting in the back
[56:54] that started floating because because
[56:56] the conditions were so right for the
[56:58] Rapture but the man ended up coming back
[57:01] down because it wasn't time so I was
[57:04] like wow that's pretty awesome I learned
[57:06] that much later but what what was what
[57:08] was going on is I would be receiving
[57:10] these experiences and then as I was
[57:13] seeking God I'd find those experiences
[57:16] in the Bible okay and then later I would
[57:19] find brother brandom talked about him
[57:21] we'll get to
[57:22] that so I go and I look in the mirror
[57:26] and I'm just I'm like I just want to go
[57:30] lay down I just I I want I want to I
[57:32] want to just go to sleep but then I hear
[57:35] this voice and it says son look at your
[57:39] life I started receiving again I'm going
[57:42] to call them Visions because I don't
[57:44] know I'm not a prophet I don't I don't
[57:46] know what they were but I'm the Lord was
[57:48] just speaking to me he was showing me
[57:50] things he was showing me things in my
[57:52] past and he was showing me how his hand
[57:55] had had been on me my whole
[57:58] life and then I snap out of these
[58:01] Visions all them and something else
[58:04] would speak through me and it would say
[58:08] but you're cool you're school you got
[58:11] this you got that you got all these
[58:13] things and I would snap out of that and
[58:15] I'd be like I don't I don't want those
[58:17] things I and realized was going on is is
[58:22] one was coaxing one was coaxing me the
[58:25] other one was just speaking seeking out
[58:26] of love and I recognized that love and
[58:29] then again I'd hear son look at your
[58:31] life and then it would be you know the
[58:33] Visions would happen again it would be
[58:35] current current state where he' show
[58:38] that were going on and how his hand was
[58:40] on life and I'd snap out of that
[58:44] something would speak through me yeah
[58:46] but this yeah but that yeah but you know
[58:48] trying to coax me and it was just a back
[58:50] and forth and that happened three times
[58:53] the last time son your life I didn't
[58:55] realize it at the time but I was
[58:57] beginning to see things that were going
[58:58] to happen and uh when it was
[59:02] done I sarcastically said can I go lay
[59:05] down now and I went and I hopped on the
[59:09] bed this time and when my head hit the
[59:12] bed Vision started again and I he I
[59:15] heard that voice speaking through those
[59:17] Visions telling me that I would be a
[59:20] preacher and I laughed I sat up from
[59:22] that and I laughed I'm like there's no
[59:24] way not not this guy
[59:26] that's funny that's funny right there no
[59:28] way let alone a preacher yeah no no way
[59:33] I just denied
[59:34] it well he didn't let me go he he kept
[59:38] dealing with me in the same manner uh
[59:42] for quite a while keep in mind I'm about
[59:45] 15 going on 16ish at this time um coming
[59:50] up to graduation so while all these
[59:53] things are happening to me I've got you
[59:55] know established friends at school it
[59:58] was kind of the kids who were Outcast
[1:00:01] we'll say they dressed in all black and
[1:00:04] you know they they acted certain ways
[1:00:06] they saw what was going on with me and
[1:00:08] they began to change I didn't even tell
[1:00:10] them about Jesus because I didn't know
[1:00:12] who Jesus was at the time I just I I
[1:00:15] tell people here to me shake my hand and
[1:00:18] say hi I'm Jesus but experiences that
[1:00:22] solidified his scriptures in my heart
[1:00:25] and so
[1:00:27] they just see this change and they're
[1:00:28] like what's going on and I said well I
[1:00:31] believe a God exists and I believe he's
[1:00:34] doing something in my life and I would
[1:00:36] begin to tell them in much greater
[1:00:38] detail again I'm sparing so many details
[1:00:41] but in much greater detail I begin to
[1:00:43] tell them a God exists there's some God
[1:00:45] that exists and at that point I just
[1:00:48] wanted to know who that God was that
[1:00:50] just did that stuff to me and so I began
[1:00:53] seeking and what is the first thing
[1:00:56] anybody that believes in God does what
[1:00:59] do they do they go to church so I just
[1:01:01] started going to churches I begin to
[1:01:04] tell people about what was going on with
[1:01:06] me and they would they would actually
[1:01:09] make me people and testify it was just
[1:01:12] any random churches I couldn't tell you
[1:01:13] what denomination or anything today but
[1:01:16] just any random churches I was going to
[1:01:19] and I was just testifying to everybody
[1:01:20] not even realizing like haha I made you
[1:01:22] a preacher in fact so they'd put me in
[1:01:26] front of people and I'd just speak what
[1:01:28] I was being showed and speak you know
[1:01:30] what was on my
[1:01:31] heart and some people after the services
[1:01:34] would approach me and they would say hey
[1:01:37] the things that you said really struck a
[1:01:39] chord they really rang true with me um
[1:01:42] and that would happen quite a bit and so
[1:01:43] what ended up happening was there was a
[1:01:45] bunch of people that kind of were like
[1:01:47] gravitated to me in a way and so I'd go
[1:01:50] to these churches and they would follow
[1:01:51] me these different churches it was it
[1:01:53] was interesting how it was all working
[1:01:55] out so after one of the times I was
[1:01:58] speaking to someone you know speaking to
[1:01:59] a crowd and someone came up to me and
[1:02:01] they say my grandpa says a lot of
[1:02:04] similar things that you say you need to
[1:02:07] talk to him like absolutely I would love
[1:02:09] to talk to somebody who isn't you
[1:02:13] know Doctrine down my throat or whatever
[1:02:15] and tell me I'm wrong in any way shape
[1:02:17] or form or every every way you know this
[1:02:19] belief's right that belief's right you
[1:02:21] know I kind of had a mini Church age
[1:02:23] session all to myself before I really
[1:02:26] realized what it was you know um but I
[1:02:29] ended up meeting this man his name was
[1:02:32] Dale and when I went to shake his hand
[1:02:37] um he stepped back and
[1:02:40] and I'm sure any of you have heard
[1:02:43] testimony so like I I I almost get a
[1:02:46] little nervous saying these things
[1:02:47] because I don't want people to think
[1:02:48] anything odd but but the man stepped
[1:02:51] back and he said the pillar of fire is
[1:02:53] standing on your head he said the angel
[1:02:55] of the Lord is is with you and I didn't
[1:02:57] know what that meant but I just started
[1:02:58] crying because I knew it had to be a
[1:03:00] good thing and he just started speaking
[1:03:02] to me about Jesus and he was speaking
[1:03:06] about things that were actually
[1:03:07] happening in my life and he was he kept
[1:03:10] quoting this man named William
[1:03:13] brandom
[1:03:14] and and so I'm just listening and I'm
[1:03:17] just taking it in that was one of the
[1:03:19] first times that had happened to me so
[1:03:23] as the Lord was changing me he was using
[1:03:25] me to do that to other people that was
[1:03:27] the first time that had happened to me
[1:03:30] so I would go home or I would go to
[1:03:33] school or whatever and funny enough I
[1:03:35] would Google what is the pillar of fire
[1:03:38] or what is the Angel of the Lord and one
[1:03:41] of the first things that popped up was
[1:03:43] Angel of the Lord and how he
[1:03:44] commissioned me William brandom I
[1:03:46] recognized both of those phrases of the
[1:03:48] Lord and William brandom like yeah I'll
[1:03:50] listen to that so I listen to it and I'm
[1:03:54] hooked I listen to a specific sermon
[1:03:57] where brother Brandon's talking about
[1:03:58] where he first heard the angel of the
[1:04:01] Lord appear in a whirlwind and he made
[1:04:04] the noise and he made the noise and I
[1:04:07] sat tension because I had never ever
[1:04:10] ever heard anybody else talk that way so
[1:04:14] immediately I'm like this man has truth
[1:04:17] and it's funny how it ended up working
[1:04:19] out but I ended up just reading the
[1:04:22] Bible praying to God listen to brother
[1:04:24] brandom reading the Bible praying to God
[1:04:27] listen brother brandom and that's how I
[1:04:29] was getting my answers so I would go
[1:04:31] around and I would tell people what I
[1:04:33] believed was the truth and so
[1:04:36] effectively I was preaching the message
[1:04:38] and at this point had no idea that there
[1:04:40] was message
[1:04:42] churches so I thought I was the only one
[1:04:45] besides some old dude that I met that
[1:04:47] believed what I believed and so I
[1:04:49] believe what I believe because I
[1:04:52] experienced the Lord and he showed from
[1:04:54] the Bible and from the prophet that that
[1:04:57] this this is reality so the things I
[1:05:00] spoke of this morning things I'm
[1:05:02] speaking of now are things that I do
[1:05:04] believe with all of my heart they are
[1:05:06] reality they're real they're reality to
[1:05:09] me this message is
[1:05:11] real people people sometimes make it an
[1:05:13] intellectual thing you know especially
[1:05:15] now that we have the table app and we
[1:05:16] can just go and memorize not and do this
[1:05:19] and do that but it it's about
[1:05:20] relationship people do it with the Bible
[1:05:22] you know it's no knock on on any any
[1:05:25] technology or anything you know people
[1:05:27] do it with the Bible that's how we have
[1:05:29] you know 60,000 plus denominations
[1:05:31] because people intellectually conceive
[1:05:34] things but this is about a relationship
[1:05:36] it's so different and so so I I
[1:05:41] basically you know I'm I'm 17 we'll say
[1:05:44] 17 18 I'm graduating you know I'm
[1:05:47] basically spending my life praying
[1:05:51] listen to the message studying praying
[1:05:53] listen to the
[1:05:54] message and going to church going to all
[1:05:56] these different churches and I felt at
[1:05:59] the time that my life's mission was to
[1:06:01] convert all these churches so I would go
[1:06:03] and I would I would preach the message
[1:06:05] and a lot of people just stopped talking
[1:06:08] to me they stopped liking me and I'm
[1:06:10] like I don't get how you guys don't see
[1:06:11] this this is this is the truth I don't I
[1:06:14] not grasp how you can't see it and so
[1:06:17] IID pray about things like that like God
[1:06:19] why don't they see it you know brother
[1:06:21] Brandon would talk about there's three
[1:06:23] in a church
[1:06:25] and so on so forth and so I was settled
[1:06:27] with that there must just be a lot of
[1:06:29] unbelievers in these churches or
[1:06:30] something I don't know so but what was
[1:06:33] still happening is there would still be
[1:06:35] people that
[1:06:37] would listen they would come out and
[1:06:40] they would believe and so today those
[1:06:42] people are in churches than the lord
[1:06:44] they're established in differentes and
[1:06:47] we'll kind of get to that too but along
[1:06:49] the way I met my wife obviously she
[1:06:51] wasn't my wife at the time but Nick was
[1:06:55] very very content living in a car
[1:06:59] sleeping outside going around preaching
[1:07:02] uh baptizing people in bathtubs I mean
[1:07:04] that was my life and I was so happy
[1:07:07] doing that but then I meet this girl and
[1:07:10] I'm like well she probably wouldn't like
[1:07:13] that so I should probably get a better
[1:07:17] job I was a at the time I was making
[1:07:19] like four bucks an hour or something it
[1:07:21] was it was pretty bad but I'm like yeah
[1:07:24] she probably probably wants a house and
[1:07:27] wants all these things so so things kind
[1:07:28] of shifted for me but she believed the
[1:07:32] things I was telling her
[1:07:35] and
[1:07:37] and
[1:07:39] basically basically followed me along
[1:07:42] the way I mean that's what it boils down
[1:07:44] to so I ended up getting a job I ended
[1:07:48] up getting into maintenance I was a
[1:07:50] maintenance technician I ended up
[1:07:52] getting hurt I ended up hurting my hand
[1:07:54] and I had to have Sur surgery had to
[1:07:56] have hip surgery they took bone from my
[1:07:58] hip to rebuild my hand and just all
[1:07:59] these crazy things and so all the money
[1:08:02] I was saving went out the window I was
[1:08:05] living paycheck to paycheck because I
[1:08:08] had you
[1:08:10] know the medical side of things they
[1:08:13] didn't cover much we'll just put it that
[1:08:15] way I I got half for workers comp and
[1:08:18] then less than half and then I just been
[1:08:20] hardly paying rent like it was really
[1:08:22] bad at the time and so go figure at that
[1:08:27] time the Lord speaks and says now is the
[1:08:30] time to buy a
[1:08:31] house and I kind of just laughed and I'm
[1:08:34] like okay so I download the realtor.com
[1:08:37] app and I open it I hear that voice
[1:08:39] again say that's the house and so the
[1:08:42] first house that popped up I didn't even
[1:08:44] scroll it was the first house that
[1:08:45] popped up clicked it hit contact seller
[1:08:48] threw my phone down and forgot about it
[1:08:51] well the next day I hear uh I hear back
[1:08:53] from the the real realtor and we set up
[1:08:58] a meeting we go and we meet and I look
[1:09:01] at the house and it's a very nice house
[1:09:04] no idea I'm going to afford this thing
[1:09:06] I'm pretty much bluffing the whole time
[1:09:08] like yeah yeah we're we're definitely
[1:09:10] going to buy this house uh you and I'm
[1:09:12] not leading this real t on to believe
[1:09:14] that I have zero money like negative
[1:09:16] money at this point and so of course I'm
[1:09:20] witnessing to this lady I'm telling her
[1:09:22] all about Jesus and all about what I
[1:09:24] believe and my test and everything else
[1:09:27] again in much more detail you know we
[1:09:28] don't have a whole whole lot of and I
[1:09:30] don't want to keep you late um but she
[1:09:33] says you know the owner of this house is
[1:09:36] a Christian she said you should meet him
[1:09:39] and I'm like yeah I'd be glad to meet
[1:09:41] him that'd be cool you know cuz in my
[1:09:43] head all Christians on the earth at this
[1:09:45] point need converted they need to
[1:09:47] believe message because everybody I've
[1:09:49] met so far doesn't and it doesn't make
[1:09:51] sense so so I ended up borrowing
[1:09:56] $250 again no I'm going to pay that back
[1:10:00] but ended up borrowing $250 to get a
[1:10:03] home inspector and so I went with the
[1:10:05] home inspector to to this home and owner
[1:10:10] happened to be there I'm like sweet I'm
[1:10:12] G to get a chance to talk to this guy
[1:10:14] and so I start talking to him and and at
[1:10:17] this point I'm a sheepish about how I
[1:10:19] share things I'm not so open about these
[1:10:22] experiences as I'm having or like for
[1:10:25] the brandom I don't throw that name
[1:10:26] right out there cuz time I do that
[1:10:29] people would react pretty rough you know
[1:10:33] and so I throw little things out there
[1:10:35] and this man was biting he was he was
[1:10:38] agreeing with things and he was amening
[1:10:41] things and I'm like man he's really a
[1:10:43] Christian all right so I'd throw some
[1:10:45] certain things out there i' get to the
[1:10:47] point where I was going to all these
[1:10:48] different churches and I was doing all
[1:10:50] these different things and I said I I I
[1:10:52] believe that there's three different
[1:10:54] types of believers make Believers
[1:10:55] unbelievers Believers he looked at me
[1:10:58] he's like yeah I know someone who says
[1:10:59] that I'm like who cuz I knew who said
[1:11:03] that and he's like oh uh this someone
[1:11:07] named uh William brandom and I'm like
[1:11:10] what and I grab this guy and I pick him
[1:11:13] up and I start spinning around and he's
[1:11:15] kicking his feet going
[1:11:17] what and if you know who it is it's all
[1:11:21] the funnier um I'm not going to say the
[1:11:24] name we can talk about that privately
[1:11:26] just because this is on you know tape or
[1:11:27] whatever but uh if you know who it is
[1:11:30] it's all the more funnier because he's
[1:11:31] about this tall and so it's just funny
[1:11:35] to tell that and to think about it think
[1:11:37] back on it but I was like you have no
[1:11:40] idea I thought I was the only other one
[1:11:43] besides this old guy who even knew who
[1:11:45] that was he's like are you kidding like
[1:11:49] no he's like there's churches all around
[1:11:53] you I'm like what do you mean churches
[1:11:54] all around me me he's like yeah there's
[1:11:57] message churches here there's message
[1:11:59] churches there there's message churches
[1:12:01] here so the funny thing about this this
[1:12:05] whole thing you know I I did have a very
[1:12:09] Supernatural uh coming into the message
[1:12:12] right the Lord dealt with me a very
[1:12:13] specific way to get me to believe and to
[1:12:16] really solidify in my heart but then
[1:12:18] here's where he really began to show up
[1:12:22] in terms of the message making it a
[1:12:25] reality because there's often times
[1:12:27] where people will have experiences you
[1:12:29] know we hear about it in the Pentecostal
[1:12:31] church we hear about it all the time you
[1:12:32] know people have experiences but then
[1:12:34] they can't they can't place those
[1:12:37] properly so without placing your
[1:12:39] experiences in the message that they're
[1:12:43] going to be wrong you're going to
[1:12:44] interpret them wrong you're going to go
[1:12:46] the wrong direction there has to be a
[1:12:48] foundation and so the Lord really really
[1:12:51] gave me a foundation there and so I'm
[1:12:54] talking to this guy and he invites to
[1:12:56] church and um I just blown away I'm so
[1:13:00] unbelievably excited y'all because I now
[1:13:05] know many people who believe what I
[1:13:07] believe and so I'm I'm very excited you
[1:13:10] know the first church I go to truer
[1:13:12] Tabernacle yeah this is awesome the
[1:13:14] first guest speaker I here Ron Spencer
[1:13:17] yeah I'm
[1:13:18] connecting was great so I'm real excited
[1:13:22] people are real excited to hear about me
[1:13:24] cuz I just show up out of nowhere you
[1:13:26] know and so we go to AR and we start
[1:13:28] talking and I'm telling my testimony
[1:13:31] again in much more
[1:13:33] detail um because we had time and I get
[1:13:38] to this one point where I talk about
[1:13:40] that old guy right and someone pops up
[1:13:43] from the crowd and says hey I know him
[1:13:46] I'm like what do you mean you know him
[1:13:48] he's like yeah his son is a preacher
[1:13:50] down here down the way or whatever I'm
[1:13:52] like well I got to meet him and so this
[1:13:55] is where Nick made a mistake so sons of
[1:13:59] God are LED of the amen but that doesn't
[1:14:02] mean that sons of God can't get very
[1:14:05] overzealous and excited and make wrong
[1:14:07] decisions so I should not have went to
[1:14:10] that church um I'm not going to say the
[1:14:12] church I'm not they not going to go
[1:14:15] there
[1:14:16] but there's times
[1:14:19] where well you can encounter religious
[1:14:22] Spirits right so
[1:14:25] you got to understand I am so new and
[1:14:27] just so excited and so just happy of all
[1:14:30] the things that the Lord is doing just
[1:14:32] telling everybody all the things that
[1:14:34] the Lord has done for me and believe it
[1:14:36] or not there's people out there that
[1:14:39] will that will throw a wet blanket
[1:14:42] flames and they'll say oh oh that's
[1:14:44] wrong you should just sit down and you
[1:14:45] should listen to my teaching and my
[1:14:47] preaching and just stay there and you
[1:14:50] know that position and so that really
[1:14:53] confused me um that threw me off a
[1:14:55] little bit
[1:14:56] because my first experience was yes this
[1:15:00] is awesome and then my my latter
[1:15:02] experience is wait a minute so so you're
[1:15:04] telling me that all of the things I
[1:15:06] experienced in the past are wrong and
[1:15:09] then so in my mind I'm thinking well if
[1:15:11] that's wrong then this is wrong and
[1:15:13] that's wrong and this is wrong of course
[1:15:14] you get to the point sometimes where you
[1:15:16] you elevate a man above where he should
[1:15:19] be right and so that's what I mistake is
[1:15:23] I elevated a man way above where he
[1:15:25] should have been and I let religious
[1:15:27] Spirits in to hurt me and so but back to
[1:15:30] the house we'll talk about that for a
[1:15:32] minute I had no money like how am I
[1:15:35] going to pay for this
[1:15:36] thing well I'm praying about it I'm like
[1:15:39] Lord if you want me to have this house
[1:15:40] then I'll have this house no problem um
[1:15:44] along the lines along the the the way
[1:15:47] there I propose to my wife uh I propose
[1:15:50] her name you know her name's Phoebe I
[1:15:52] propose and uh we're we're getting
[1:15:56] really serious we're getting really
[1:15:57] close to the time where we need a house
[1:15:59] cuz we're going to get married here soon
[1:16:01] so the Lord ended up providing the down
[1:16:05] payment so what ended up happening there
[1:16:08] I had a buddy who worked at uh a factory
[1:16:12] and he didn't realize he had a 401k that
[1:16:14] he was saving because he he opted out of
[1:16:17] it but I guess the company was putting
[1:16:19] into it anyway and so when he quit there
[1:16:22] he actually had exactly and he offered
[1:16:25] it to me and so I was able to get the
[1:16:29] down payment for the house and so of
[1:16:33] course he'll be blessed and he was paid
[1:16:35] back but I got the down payment for the
[1:16:37] house right so we got the house we got
[1:16:39] married all within a month and now we're
[1:16:41] going to these new churches so all of
[1:16:43] that all happened and then we get hurt
[1:16:45] by this Rel spirit so we actually start
[1:16:49] to back out I pull back from churches
[1:16:52] and I'm like well I I was happy BAS
[1:16:54] basically just being tape only I was
[1:16:56] happy there I was safe about all that
[1:16:59] I'm just going to go back and do that
[1:17:01] just going to go do I sat at home and
[1:17:05] listen to
[1:17:07] tapes and believe it or not got more
[1:17:11] depressed than I was when I was a kid
[1:17:15] when I was a kid it it was it was bad it
[1:17:17] was really
[1:17:18] bad but to to see God move
[1:17:25] kid I never saw God move to see God move
[1:17:28] and then to have that all come crashing
[1:17:30] down imagine that imagine the depression
[1:17:32] on that and so I got very very depressed
[1:17:37] very down and I started doing this when
[1:17:40] God spoke and I started walking the
[1:17:42] other direction I'm not going to do this
[1:17:44] stuff anymore I'm not going to go to
[1:17:46] church I'm not going to do nothing I'm
[1:17:47] just going to walk away so I tried with
[1:17:50] everything in me to walk
[1:17:52] away and all along the way
[1:17:55] the Lord would nudge me he'd move me in
[1:17:57] directions and I'd basically tell him
[1:17:59] stop I want to go this way well he'd let
[1:18:02] me go that way and then he'd Circle me
[1:18:04] back around and I'd end up exactly where
[1:18:06] he told me to be in the first place he
[1:18:07] wouldn't let me go and just as any Son
[1:18:11] of God he wouldn't let you go he
[1:18:12] wouldn't let you go he will not let you
[1:18:15] go like the scripture I read we're safe
[1:18:17] in
[1:18:18] his and that's our assurance that no
[1:18:21] matter where you go no matter what you
[1:18:22] go through no matter condition
[1:18:25] he will keep you and so that's to me
[1:18:29] that's an encouragement because there's
[1:18:31] many people who have walked away there's
[1:18:33] many people you've probably seen that's
[1:18:35] walked away um I can I can under I can
[1:18:39] relate I can understand but the Lord
[1:18:43] will keep them the Lord will bring them
[1:18:45] back I'm speaking that the Lord back I'm
[1:18:50] back
[1:18:52] so we go my wife and I we
[1:18:56] go about a year and a half I think it
[1:18:59] was without going to
[1:19:00] church and the llies actually um were a
[1:19:06] Saving Grace to me
[1:19:08] because they spent time with me they
[1:19:12] spent you know they they made themselves
[1:19:15] available so that so that I had someone
[1:19:17] that I could I could I could fellowship
[1:19:19] with and be with and uh they really
[1:19:21] really me in a in a good mind mind
[1:19:24] mindset and so you know bless brother
[1:19:27] Matt for that um we ended
[1:19:31] up I I can't put into words how bad it
[1:19:34] was guys it it got really really dark
[1:19:36] for for a really long time there was a
[1:19:39] lot of those visions that I had in the
[1:19:42] past that had come to pass but there was
[1:19:45] a lot of them that didn't happen yet
[1:19:48] right and so I just disregarded all of
[1:19:51] that I said I want nothing to do with
[1:19:53] this I'm walking away
[1:19:56] one day the Lord put it on my heart to
[1:19:58] go back to True Word and realistically I
[1:20:01] should have never left true word I
[1:20:03] should have stayed there I should I
[1:20:04] should have I should have prayed before
[1:20:06] I left if I were to leave you know
[1:20:08] sometimes people get up and leave
[1:20:10] because you know who knows why they by
[1:20:12] this person or that person says this or
[1:20:14] whatever and they're making decisions on
[1:20:16] their own and and we really do need to
[1:20:19] just pray seek God for the answers and
[1:20:22] follow him um otherwise we're going to
[1:20:25] find ourselves in some some bad spots
[1:20:28] but the Lord spoke to my heart didn't
[1:20:30] ignore it we went back to True
[1:20:33] Word and interesting interestingly
[1:20:36] enough um when I was going there the
[1:20:39] first time you know because we went
[1:20:41] there for a little while back and forth
[1:20:43] um I never met my my current Pastor uh
[1:20:47] brother Wayne I never met him maybe a
[1:20:49] few times you know a handful of times
[1:20:50] like handshakes or whatever because he
[1:20:52] was an evangelist he was always gone you
[1:20:54] know and uh and so when I went you know
[1:20:58] he was he was home a lot more so I had
[1:21:00] the opportunity to really meet
[1:21:02] him and we had moments where uh brother
[1:21:06] Wayne he's uh you all know brother Wayne
[1:21:09] probably he's a very Gifted Man and
[1:21:12] there'd be moments where we'd have a
[1:21:13] connection and he'd uh you know he would
[1:21:16] be used to fulfill a lot of those things
[1:21:19] that
[1:21:20] I right those those Visions I had I'm
[1:21:23] not getting into them for reason again
[1:21:25] time and and also um some of them are
[1:21:28] just they're a little personal and you
[1:21:29] know uh a testimony is it's personal to
[1:21:34] some to some extent right so some of
[1:21:35] those things we need to keep to
[1:21:37] ourselves because it's not you know like
[1:21:40] brother brandham had had visions that
[1:21:42] meant something to the bride as a body
[1:21:44] and and my things meant something for me
[1:21:46] so that's why I'm not elaborating on
[1:21:48] some of them but he would directly
[1:21:51] fulfill some of the visions that I had
[1:21:54] years and years ago and so what the Lord
[1:21:57] was showing me because what wasn't
[1:21:58] connecting for me for a very long time
[1:22:01] so it's one of them things like I spoke
[1:22:03] of earlier a tree can be cut down dead
[1:22:06] but when the water comes it Springs back
[1:22:08] to life so that's the condition I was in
[1:22:11] I was cut down dead very dead religious
[1:22:14] Spirits did that to me and so when I
[1:22:17] went back to where I should have been in
[1:22:18] the first
[1:22:19] place the waters there help me spring
[1:22:22] back okay and
[1:22:25] and so what the Lord began to show me
[1:22:29] was he was dealing with me very
[1:22:32] personally in the past and I come back
[1:22:34] to church and now he's dealing with me
[1:22:36] very personally through the body so he
[1:22:39] began to show me the reality of the body
[1:22:42] of Christ it's him in us moving it's him
[1:22:46] in us moving just using the preachers
[1:22:49] and he's not just using you know the
[1:22:51] pastors the Evangelist he's not just
[1:22:53] using you know everybody is the body
[1:22:55] collectively just because somebody
[1:22:57] stands here and you guys sit down there
[1:23:00] doesn't mean anything it's not the voice
[1:23:02] behind the pulpit it's it's the voice in
[1:23:04] the body and so that's what he began to
[1:23:06] tell me that that that how he was
[1:23:08] dealing with me in the past he's now
[1:23:10] doing it in a body and it took such a
[1:23:13] long time for it to connect and click
[1:23:15] with me that that I am a son I am a Son
[1:23:19] of God it took so long for me to for it
[1:23:21] to connect and me to realize things like
[1:23:24] this like Adam was blessed or Eve was
[1:23:29] blessed while in Adam and so we're
[1:23:31] blessed in the Beloved Jesus was blessed
[1:23:34] Jesus was said this is my beloved we
[1:23:36] were blessed just the same those types
[1:23:39] of blessings we have and and just how
[1:23:42] the Lord led me in it was uh it
[1:23:46] was it's it's hard to condense this it's
[1:23:49] really hard to condense this in such a
[1:23:51] short time it was it was in such a way
[1:23:54] that he he really
[1:23:57] solidified that what brother brandham
[1:24:00] spoke over the
[1:24:02] bride would can to anybody not just
[1:24:06] people sitting in these churches right
[1:24:08] he he can he can reach out to the to the
[1:24:10] depths of the world he can reach out
[1:24:12] anywhere to grab anybody from any
[1:24:14] condition I was in a bad bad condition
