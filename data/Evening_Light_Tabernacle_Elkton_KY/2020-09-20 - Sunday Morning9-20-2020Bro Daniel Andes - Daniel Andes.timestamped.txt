[32:57] a picture of william branham which is a
[33:00] nice picture there it's good to see it's
[33:01] still hanging in the church still
[33:03] believing a message that god sent
[33:05] amen it's most vindicated ministry that
[33:07] ever came to the face of the earth
[33:09] outside of jesus christ
[33:11] i'm not ashamed to be identified with it
[33:12] i'm glad to be identified with brother
[33:14] byler who's not ashamed of it as well
[33:16] i was listening to a message in the last
[33:19] couple days
[33:20] accepting god's provided way for the end
[33:22] time
[33:24] in 1963 brother graham's given the sign
[33:26] of the discernment
[33:27] and he said now this ought to produce
[33:29] rapturing faith
[33:30] he goes through the discernment at the
[33:32] end he said now that will produce
[33:34] rapturing faith so amen it's something
[33:36] that god sent in the last day to restore
[33:38] our hearts back to the faith of our
[33:40] fathers to believe
[33:40] jesus christ is the same yesterday today

[35:06] you come up here and
[35:07] sing for us we had a little song
[35:09] together i was reading something we were
[35:10] listening actually coming down this
[35:12] morning
[35:13] i was listening message trying to do god
[35:15] a service without his will
[35:17] i heard yesterday i was listening the
[35:19] first part of it brother ann was talking
[35:20] about the california earthquake
[35:22] talking about sister simpson said she
[35:24] went and got a prophecy that i made
[35:26] around 1935 or something like that
[35:29] said the time would come that's written
[35:30] in a book somewhere that the
[35:32] the sea would weep its way into the
[35:34] desert look what will take place
[35:36] he said if that thousands of square
[35:39] miles falls down into the lava
[35:41] of the earth and slides in there will be
[35:44] millions die at one time
[35:46] and that'll cause a tidal wave remember
[35:49] come up into the sultan sea is 100 or
[35:51] 200 feet
[35:52] lower than a sea level that water will
[35:54] probably come almost to tucson with that
[35:56] tidal wave coming across
[35:58] there he said the sea will weep its way
[36:00] into the desert
[36:02] that's been a prophecy amen that god's
[36:04] prophet made
[36:06] i was out in arizona here a few years
[36:07] ago in phoenix and i drove i'd never
[36:09] been to
[36:10] los angeles and i drove to los angeles
[36:12] it's a huge
[36:14] valley that goes all the way from
[36:16] phoenix all the way to
[36:18] los angeles and so i went to the salton
[36:20] sea it's just a dead
[36:21] just the thing but it's below sea level
[36:23] there brother adam's telling us when
[36:25] that california
[36:26] goes in the ocean he said there'll be a
[36:27] wave a tidal wave that'll come all the
[36:29] way back
[36:29] through there into phoenix he said
[36:31] almost to tucson so i believe it's a
[36:34] prophecy it's going to come
[36:35] to come to pass noah prophesied for 120
[36:38] years it's gonna rain
[36:40] and one day it rained amen california
[36:42] will go into the ocean and then everyone
[36:44] will know and everyone will be a
[36:46] believer that god sent a prophet in this
[36:48] day
[36:49] but then it'll be too late i want to be
[36:50] a believer this morning amen

[41:15] winning side father
[41:17] just pray lord as we read your word

[41:20] us lord

[41:33] book in a moment lord that we'll be
[41:35] blessed more
[41:36] strengthen us today lord and help us we
[41:38] ask in the name of jesus christ
[41:40] amen saint matthew chapter 27
[41:44] i want to start with verse 27.
[41:49] and the bible says then the soldiers of
[41:51] the governor took jesus into the common
[41:53] hall
[41:53] and gathered unto him the whole band of
[41:55] soldiers and i want to watch you with
[41:57] what he what they did to my savior first
[42:00] they stripped him
[42:02] and put on him a scarlet robe when they
[42:04] had platted a crown of thorns they put
[42:05] it upon his head
[42:07] and a reed in his right hand and they
[42:08] bowed the knee before him
[42:10] and mocked him saying hail king of the
[42:13] jews
[42:14] now we know there's coming a time when
[42:15] the bible says every knee will bow
[42:17] and every tongue will confess but these
[42:20] people are kneeling but they're mocking
[42:22] jesus christ
[42:23] verse number 30 and they spit upon him
[42:26] and took a reed and smote him on the
[42:27] head and after that they had mocked him
[42:29] they took the robe off of him and
[42:31] put on his own raiment on him and led
[42:33] him away to crucify him
[42:35] and as they came out they found a man of
[42:38] cyrene simon by name
[42:40] and they compelled him to bear his cross
[42:42] brother ram tells us he was a colored
[42:44] man
[42:45] amen was a colored man that helped the
[42:47] lord jesus bear his cross
[42:49] a man may god take all racism out of the
[42:51] body of christ there should be
[42:53] no racism in god's body verse number 33
[42:57] and when they were come unto a place
[42:59] called gal goth
[43:00] that is to say the place of the skull
[43:02] they gave him vinegar to drink
[43:04] mingled with gall and he and when he had
[43:07] tasted thereof he did
[43:09] he would not drink and they crucified
[43:12] him and parted his garments casting lots
[43:14] that it might be fulfilled which was
[43:15] spoken by the prophet
[43:17] they had parted my garments among them
[43:20] and upon my vesture did they cast lots
[43:22] and sitting down they watched him there
[43:26] i can't read all that without going to
[43:28] the 28th chapter
[43:29] reading a couple verses we know a lot of
[43:32] the rest of the story but 28 chapter
[43:35] verse number 5 and the angel answered
[43:38] and said unto the woman fear fear not ye
[43:40] for
[43:41] i know that you seek jesus which was
[43:43] crucified he is not here
[43:45] for he has risen as he said come see the
[43:48] place where he
[43:49] lay amen may god add his blessing to the
[43:51] word you may be seated
[43:54] i want to go back to that take my text
[43:55] out of matthew chapter 27 verse 35.
[44:00] amen and the verse 36 actually the bible
[44:03] says and sitting down
[44:04] they watched him there and sitting down
[44:07] they watched him there
[44:09] and if we can just go in our minds for a
[44:10] few minutes and want us to go back to
[44:13] gethsemane i think sometimes we have
[44:15] forgotten
[44:16] what it costs to bring our redemption
[44:19] the bible says in ephesians the
[44:21] the first chapter the second chapter and
[44:23] also colossians that we are made nigh by
[44:25] the blood of jesus christ
[44:27] so there was no redemption outside of
[44:29] the blood of jesus christ it took
[44:31] the cross of christ there was only one
[44:33] person that could do that
[44:34] and that was jesus christ no man no
[44:37] prophet no woman no child was able to
[44:39] redeem us
[44:40] it took a virgin born son of god which
[44:42] was jesus christ can you say amen
[44:44] how many believers we have in the house
[44:46] today amen so christ had to come and die
[44:49] so it
[44:50] doesn't matter uh you know how we tell
[44:52] the story and how many miracles were
[44:54] done
[44:54] there came a time there had to be a
[44:56] savior and as
[44:58] we enter into this story i want us to
[44:59] just enter into what has just happened
[45:02] judas has betrayed jesus with a kiss all
[45:04] the disciples have fled away
[45:07] they led jesus to k ephesus the high
[45:09] priest and they sought false witnesses
[45:11] they didn't find any
[45:13] true witnesses and so they sent him over
[45:16] to pontius pilate
[45:17] so then judas came back and he returns
[45:19] with the money he
[45:20] he realizes he's made a mistake and he
[45:23] brings the 30 pieces of silver back you
[45:25] see so many people are betraying christ
[45:27] the word today
[45:28] and there'll be a time they'll be a
[45:29] believer again but it'll be too late
[45:31] just like it was with judas
[45:33] so he brings the money back judas goes
[45:35] and he hangs himself
[45:37] and then barabbas was chosen to be
[45:39] released over jesus
[45:40] and pilate begins to wash his hands and
[45:42] says i find no fault in him
[45:45] the jews the jews cried out and said let
[45:48] his blood be upon
[45:49] us and our children it's amazing so many
[45:51] things are happening brother tom
[45:53] so fast right here and and a lot of
[45:55] prophecies are being fulfilled just in
[45:57] a few hours of time just like the jew
[45:59] saying let his
[46:00] blood be on us and our children and two
[46:03] thousand years later
[46:04] hitler rises up and there's a great
[46:06] holocaust and their
[46:07] the blood was now being poured out on
[46:10] their children
[46:11] because they rejected christ and 6
[46:13] million jews lost their life because
[46:16] they said let his blood be upon our
[46:18] children
[46:19] oh brothers and sisters we must remember
[46:20] the things that we do today will affect
[46:22] our children
[46:24] the things that we do today will affect
[46:26] our children
[46:27] so they stripped him and they crowned
[46:29] him with thorns and they whipped him and
[46:30] they spit on him and they pulled his
[46:32] beard and they mocked him and they led
[46:34] him
[46:34] and they crucified him and then they
[46:36] nailed him to a cross
[46:38] they fixed him there with nails now no
[46:40] man how jesus say
[46:42] he said no man takes my life he said i
[46:44] lay my life down
[46:46] so now they have this man who's laid on
[46:49] a cross and they fix him with nails in
[46:50] his feet
[46:52] and they they secure him and they they
[46:54] actually guard him
[46:56] and it's really amazing because i would
[46:57] imagine any other man brother tom they'd
[46:59] just walk back and go have a meal and
[47:01] they've
[47:01] executed another malfactor but the bible
[47:04] says in this verse
[47:05] and sitting down they watched him
[47:09] they watched him this man the bible says
[47:12] in isaiah that his visage was marred
[47:14] beyond any other man and
[47:16] if he ever studied roman cruelty it was
[47:18] very cruel
[47:19] and so now they get him and they fix him
[47:21] on a cross but the bible says they sat
[47:23] down
[47:24] and they watched him and i began to i
[47:27] was reading this in my study the other
[47:28] day i thought why
[47:29] did they sit down and they watched this
[47:31] man that was
[47:32] no more than just flesh hanging on a
[47:34] cross
[47:35] and i began to think about that and i
[47:38] thought about this because where jesus
[47:40] is there's hope wherever jesus
[47:44] is there's life wherever there jesus is
[47:48] there's victory
[47:49] wherever jesus is there's deliverance
[47:52] wherever jesus is there's power can you
[47:54] say amen
[47:56] i believe he's here today in the house
[47:58] do you believe it
[47:59] amen he said i have power to lay my life
[48:01] down and i have power to
[48:03] take it up again and these people were
[48:05] so afraid because they
[48:07] physically they fixed him and they sat
[48:09] and they began to watch him
[48:11] oh because where jesus is the
[48:12] supernatural is
[48:14] where jesus is the supernatural happens
[48:17] amen and i tell you his last words when
[48:19] he's crying there
[48:20] he cries it is finished
[48:24] and his last words that's been 2 000
[48:26] years ago
[48:27] and even though it was 2 000 years ago
[48:29] it still echoes through the halls of
[48:32] eternity
[48:33] it is finished it is finished this
[48:35] morning your salvation is paid for
[48:38] your healing is paid for do you believe
[48:41] it today
[48:41] he's our healer he's our deliverer it
[48:44] was paid for on
[48:46] calvary oh blessed be the name of the
[48:48] lord
[48:49] i tell you wherever he was amen when he
[48:52] he died there the sun
[48:53] refused to shine they were so ashamed of
[48:56] what the creation had done to the
[48:58] creator
[48:58] the sun hit his face amen the earth had
[49:02] a nervous breakdown and began to shake
[49:05] amen the bible says amen if you turn in
[49:07] your bibles just the next
[49:08] couple of chapters there the bible says
[49:10] when the earthquake happened the dead
[49:12] amen that believed in christ they began
[49:14] to raise out of the grave
[49:16] why because something was happening a
[49:18] supernatural god
[49:19] amen that was in the midst wherever
[49:22] christ
[49:22] is the supernatural happens amen he's in
[49:26] the house so i expect the supernatural
[49:28] today
[49:29] i expect things that are not natural to
[49:31] happen today
[49:32] i would expect people that are downcast
[49:34] to be uplifted
[49:35] i expected the to walk
[49:39] said bro daniel i don't see any crippled
[49:41] i see more people that are crippled in
[49:43] their spirit
[49:44] than i do in their body can you say man
[49:46] some people don't even feel like getting
[49:48] out of bed
[49:48] some don't get out of bed they just stay
[49:50] in bed or they get up and they take
[49:52] their pills and they go back to bed
[49:53] oh but he's here today amen to deliver a
[49:56] people
[49:56] to give them hope to give them life
[50:00] blessed be the name of the lord he's so
[50:03] wonderful
[50:04] he's a prince of peace he's a mighty god
[50:07] i was thinking about that our nation
[50:09] we've entered into some difficult times
[50:11] this
[50:12] uh you know the covered times and then
[50:14] now the
[50:15] the riots and they came to louisville
[50:16] and they said they were going to burn
[50:17] our city down and
[50:19] you know racism there has been some
[50:21] problems stains on our flag brother ram
[50:23] said the civil war was a stain on the
[50:25] american flag brothers fighting
[50:26] brothers i think the line even went
[50:28] through was it kentucky and tennessee
[50:30] where
[50:30] brothers if the line went through and
[50:32] your family's farm was spent and
[50:34] split some was on the north and the
[50:35] south you fought during the day
[50:37] and they had pictures we went into a
[50:38] museum and at night they showed these
[50:39] people snuck out of their camps and went
[50:41] from the opposite forces armies and went
[50:44] sat and built a fire and we sang and was
[50:46] around a fire together and by day they
[50:47] had to go back and fight it's a stain on
[50:49] the american flag
[50:51] you know and i tell you if we remove all
[50:54] the things that were there
[50:55] as christians if we had to go back in
[50:57] the bible and take all the stains that
[50:58] were on
[50:59] christianity and judaism i would have to
[51:01] throw abraham out we'd have to throw
[51:03] isaac out and jacob in fact
[51:05] every one of the patriarchs we'd have to
[51:06] throw them out we'd have to throw peter
[51:08] out we'd have to throw paul out are you
[51:10] with me today
[51:11] i mean we have stains that were back
[51:13] there but the blood of jesus christ
[51:15] cleanses us from all sin amen and that's
[51:18] what i love about the book it's honesty
[51:20] it tells
[51:21] hey we're not perfect people i believe
[51:23] the bible says i believe it's in in
[51:25] in psalms there it says if god would
[51:27] mark the perfect man
[51:28] who would stand if god
[51:31] should mark the perfect man who would
[51:33] stand
[51:35] oh i tell you but i'm thankful for the
[51:37] blood of christ
[51:39] amen that washes away every stain
[51:42] are you thankful for the blood of christ
[51:44] we need a blood
[51:46] not just to cover remember the old
[51:48] testament bible says that the blood of
[51:49] goes covered sin but it never
[51:51] took it away
[51:53] it was always there amen that's why john
[51:55] over in the book of revelation no man
[51:57] was found worthy and john wept because
[51:59] all the blood and all the thousands and
[52:01] millions of lambs that were
[52:02] sacrificed that were just a symbol of
[52:04] christ coming it was all in vain and
[52:06] john weeps oh but he heard the voice
[52:09] amen said don't weep john for the lion
[52:12] of the tribe of judah has prevailed
[52:15] and he looked to see a lion but what he
[52:17] saw was a lamb
[52:19] as it had been slaying from the
[52:21] foundation of the world
[52:23] amen how's the bible say in revelation
[52:25] 13 that there were names written on the
[52:27] lamb's book of life before the
[52:28] foundation of the world
[52:30] so before this thing ever started before
[52:32] god said let there be light
[52:34] and then before that the bible says
[52:35] christ was slain before the foundation
[52:37] of the world
[52:38] in the mind of god he had this whole
[52:40] thing planned out brother tom
[52:41] he had it all planned out he had it
[52:44] planned that you would be here this
[52:45] morning
[52:46] you would hear that screaming guy from
[52:47] indiana
[52:49] probably a hundred decibels trying to
[52:52] get your attention say hey
[52:54] as brother bam said nothing's wrong he
[52:55] said the wheels are turning just right
[52:57] you just need to get in the turn you
[53:00] just need to get in that turn
[53:01] oh blessed be the name of the lord you
[53:04] believe that today it's turning just
[53:06] right say oh brother brother daniel you
[53:07] don't know what's going on in my family
[53:09] you don't know what's going on my
[53:10] children you don't know what's going on
[53:11] in our church i'm here to tell you the
[53:12] wheels are turning just
[53:14] right and if that thing causes you to
[53:17] get down and pray a little more
[53:18] then it isn't all bad is it
[53:21] i said if it causes you to get down and
[53:24] pray a little more
[53:25] it isn't all bad is it amen the bible
[53:28] says as many as he loves he chastens in
[53:30] rebuke be zealous therefore and repent
[53:33] sometimes god has to get our attention i
[53:36] don't know of
[53:37] any more greater attention getter than
[53:39] pain
[53:40] and you might be laying in the hospital
[53:42] looking at the at the ceiling
[53:44] and say lord what is it
[53:48] lord search me and try man you know i
[53:50] don't know i haven't had to covet and i
[53:52] don't know if it'll come my way i
[53:53] you know people say well i'm not gonna
[53:55] get us have you ever had a cold you ever
[53:57] had the flu
[53:58] yeah yeah well they say it's just the
[54:00] same strain so i'm not going to say it
[54:01] here and say i'm going to be
[54:02] invincible but i know this the bible
[54:04] says i am the lord that heals all of
[54:06] your sicknesses
[54:08] and all of your diseases so i know i
[54:09] have a healer amen that will not leave
[54:12] me
[54:12] amen he said i'll never leave you daniel
[54:14] i'll never forsake you
[54:16] i tell you well i don't know what it is
[54:17] 10 days whatever it puts me down say my
[54:20] we'll have a lot of prayer time we'll be
[54:21] listening to a lot of tapes of god's
[54:23] prophet oh my hallelujah
[54:25] the devil's probably afraid to give it
[54:26] to some believers because they're just
[54:28] going to go
[54:29] in their room and listen to the prophet
[54:31] and pray and
[54:32] just take their arse wrong put all these
[54:34] weapons of the word of god and hide it
[54:37] in their heart
[54:38] the devil's like no don't give it to
[54:40] them i know what they're going to do
[54:41] they're not going to go watch tv all the
[54:43] time they're going to listen to god's
[54:44] prophet
[54:45] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[54:48] find that these things have come to our
[54:50] nation i was thinking about this brother
[54:51] ram said in 1951 he said remember church
[54:54] you're living in the best days you'll
[54:55] ever
[54:56] will live in right now until jesus comes
[55:00] he said it shall gradually not gradually
[55:03] but rapidly get worse and worse
[55:06] have we seen that yes brother bam goes
[55:09] on to this talking about racism give me
[55:11] just a few minutes to talk about the
[55:13] events of our day
[55:14] brother ram said i've told you here in
[55:15] the park the pulpit martin luther king
[55:17] is the greatest endeavour at the
[55:19] colored people ever had right he said
[55:21] that man's
[55:22] going to lead thousands of them to
[55:25] slaughter that's right
[55:26] inspired by communism
[55:29] now you say well martin luther's gone
[55:32] yes but we realize that every man
[55:34] has a legacy that carries on behind him
[55:37] it was a judas did something that could
[55:39] not be undone
[55:40] he opened the door that christ was
[55:42] crucified so we see that martin luther
[55:44] king was inspired by the communism and
[55:45] he opened the door
[55:47] streets and highways are named after
[55:49] this man and people go back into those
[55:51] so he goes on to say look at in
[55:52] california look at the riots look at
[55:54] nine 19 people being killed radical he
[55:57] said i
[55:58] didn't i tell you here not long back
[56:00] that martin luther king would lead his
[56:01] people to massacre
[56:03] how many remembers that he said isn't
[56:05] them colored people he said
[56:06] he said it isn't those colored people he
[56:08] said it's them leaders stirring them up
[56:10] it's integr
[56:11] it isn't integration listen it isn't
[56:13] segregation
[56:14] or whatever you want to call it it's the
[56:16] devil
[56:18] that's right not only to the
[56:19] white-colored this
[56:21] this is to all of them it's the devil he
[56:23] goes on talking about martin luther king
[56:25] he said this man if i could only speak
[56:27] to him
[56:27] he's leading those precious people under
[56:29] the name of religion into a death trap
[56:31] where he's going to kill
[56:33] thousands times thousands of them he
[56:35] said just like hitler did over in
[56:37] germany he led them right into a death
[56:38] trap them precious germans
[56:40] and and and laid by the the millions
[56:43] piled up
[56:43] they're on the one another he said
[56:45] that's exactly the same thing remember
[56:47] i'm on tape you'll see it
[56:49] after maybe after i'm gone that's
[56:51] exactly what's going to happen
[56:52] and pressure people will die down there
[56:54] like flies start a revolution later
[56:56] start whites
[56:57] and colors will kill again and die like
[57:00] flies so
[57:01] it's been prophesied we see it beginning
[57:03] to come to pass we see the seeds of it
[57:06] coming here and i don't know back in
[57:07] louisville i forget what it was it was
[57:09] they have one policeman for every 700
[57:11] people and they threatened to come and
[57:13] burn our cities down
[57:14] amen we need jesus christ amen we were
[57:17] talking the other day our pastor was
[57:19] talking a couple years ago we showed a
[57:20] film about
[57:21] the the the revival in finney's time and
[57:23] they dismissed the whole police force
[57:26] because there was there's no reason for
[57:30] the
[57:30] people that's the way you defund the
[57:34] police you get the people born again
[57:36] you get the lamb nature in might cause
[57:40] them not to write it costs to be like a
[57:42] lamb
[57:43] oh blessed be the name so we have the
[57:45] answer we have the answer but they don't
[57:47] want the answer
[57:48] jesus was the answer to all pilate and k
[57:50] ephesus problems
[57:51] but they didn't want the answer they
[57:53] were crucifying the answer
[57:56] so if you still have your bibles matthew
[57:58] chapter 27 verse 50.
[58:00] i don't know where that water went here
[58:01] it is i found it by the way
[58:06] they tell me to slow down sometimes
[58:12] chapter 27 verse 50.
[58:15] now we find there's much in the story
[58:17] here jesus when he had cried again with
[58:19] a loud voice yielded up the ghost and
[58:22] behold the veil of the temple was ripped
[58:24] was rent and twain from the top to the
[58:26] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[58:28] rocks ran and the graves were open
[58:30] and many bodies of the saints which
[58:32] slept a rose
[58:35] and came out of the graves after his
[58:36] resurrection and went into the holy city
[58:38] and appeared unto many
[58:40] now when the centurion and they that
[58:42] were with him watching jesus
[58:43] now the so here we we're at the temple
[58:46] he takes us to the temple it's rent from
[58:47] top to the bottom
[58:48] now he takes us back to where christ is
[58:50] being crucified and there's a centurion
[58:52] sitting there watching this man that's
[58:53] fixed to the cross
[58:55] when this unbeliever saw the earthquake
[58:57] and those things that had happened they
[58:58] feared greatly saying
[59:00] truly this was the son of god
[59:04] so now they're watching brother tom
[59:07] they're watching a dead corpse so to
[59:08] speak on a cross
[59:10] and when this corpse cries it is
[59:12] finished
[59:13] then the earth has a nervous breakdown
[59:16] the sun refuses to shine the temple the
[59:18] veil is written from the top of the
[59:20] bottom and the unbelievers stand there
[59:22] and say
[59:22] truly truly the message of the hour was
[59:26] the truth
[59:27] truly it was rights but it never said he
[59:31] became
[59:32] a believer he just acknowledged that's
[59:34] the truth
[59:35] truly that was the son of god truly that
[59:37] was the creator
[59:39] of heavens and earth and they were
[59:40] watching him there and i tell you
[59:42] as we said before one day every knee
[59:44] will bow and every tongue will
[59:46] confess but that doesn't bring salvation
[59:48] amen it's just an acknowledgement
[59:53] on up here in verse 62 this story is so
[59:55] wonderful
[59:56] not having time to read it all and now
[59:58] the next day verse 62
[1:00:00] that followed the day of the preparation
[1:00:02] the chief priests and pharisees came
[1:00:04] together into pilate saying
[1:00:05] sir we remembered that this deceiver say
[1:00:08] while he was yet alive after three days
[1:00:10] i will rise again
[1:00:11] so now they they they've scourged him
[1:00:13] they've mocked him his vintage is marred
[1:00:15] beyond that of any man
[1:00:16] they've affixed him to a tree they
[1:00:18] acknowledge he's dead they put a spirit
[1:00:20] aside
[1:00:21] blooded water runs out he's totally
[1:00:23] extinguished and they take his body down
[1:00:25] they put it in a grave
[1:00:27] and then they're still worried why
[1:00:31] because wherever jesus is there's hope
[1:00:34] there's deliverance there's power in the
[1:00:37] name of jesus
[1:00:39] and so they they begin these are
[1:00:40] unbelievers said command therefore that
[1:00:43] the sepulcher be made sure until the
[1:00:44] third day
[1:00:45] lest his disciples come by night and
[1:00:47] steal him away and say unto the people
[1:00:49] he has risen from the dead
[1:00:50] so that the last air shall be worse than
[1:00:52] the first and pilate said unto them this
[1:00:54] is so amazing
[1:00:55] our that's our text this morning sitting
[1:00:57] down they watched him there
[1:00:59] he pilate says you have a watch
[1:01:02] go your way make it as sure as you can
[1:01:07] make it as sure as you can
[1:01:11] so they went and they made the sepulcher
[1:01:13] shure
[1:01:14] sealing the stone well surely they
[1:01:17] sealed it but no here we are again
[1:01:19] and set a watch outside of the stone
[1:01:23] so now they've done all of this he's
[1:01:25] totally dead he's in the grave they've
[1:01:27] sealed him
[1:01:29] but there's a promise of god that says
[1:01:31] after the third day
[1:01:32] i'm going to come out again so now the
[1:01:34] unbelievers have done all that they can
[1:01:36] to stop the oh blessed be the name of
[1:01:38] the lord
[1:01:39] everything that they can do to prevent
[1:01:41] the word of god from coming to pass
[1:01:42] and they seal the stone and then the
[1:01:44] bibles they said they set a watch
[1:01:47] to see if the word of god would come to
[1:01:48] pass or not come to pass
[1:01:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:01:53] hallelujah but on that third day
[1:01:55] how's it say in verse two there verse
[1:01:57] one it says at the end of the sabbath at
[1:01:59] the beginning of the dawn towards the
[1:02:01] first day of the week
[1:02:02] came mary magdalene and the other mary
[1:02:05] to see the sepulcher so not only were
[1:02:08] unbelievers there
[1:02:09] amen there were believers there as well
[1:02:11] are you believer here today
[1:02:13] amen when the devil comes and says
[1:02:14] there's no hope you'll never make it out
[1:02:17] of this but god said i am the waymaker i
[1:02:19] am the way i am the truth i am
[1:02:21] life and believers come to see jesus
[1:02:25] christ
[1:02:26] oh blessed be the name of the lord the
[1:02:28] next verse says and behold
[1:02:29] there was a great earthquake for the
[1:02:31] angel the lord descended from heaven and
[1:02:33] came
[1:02:34] down and rolled back the stone from the
[1:02:36] door
[1:02:37] and sat upon it oh it's so amazing
[1:02:41] amen when you see all the world i was
[1:02:43] thinking about that in verse 66 the
[1:02:45] bible says they made it sure
[1:02:47] that's what the world is trying to do
[1:02:48] they're trying to make it sure that the
[1:02:50] word of god
[1:02:51] amen doesn't come to pass they've got
[1:02:53] all kinds of popular opinions and
[1:02:55] and all kinds of social media i i i say
[1:02:58] this i'm going to put a little warning
[1:03:00] here against social media because social
[1:03:02] media is run by popularity
[1:03:04] popularity and whatever's popular with
[1:03:06] the world amen how's the bible saying
[1:03:08] james you can't be
[1:03:09] he that is a friend of the world is an
[1:03:11] enemy of god
[1:03:12] so whatever the world says is popular
[1:03:14] you better run from that
[1:03:16] thing you better get away from that
[1:03:17] thing because amen the
[1:03:19] how's it that people get in there and
[1:03:20] they begin to friend the world and the
[1:03:22] and things that don't and god forbid
[1:03:24] that any christian would see somebody
[1:03:25] dressed immoral and put like on their
[1:03:27] thing
[1:03:29] oh my goodness somewhere you've got to
[1:03:31] be a christian
[1:03:33] and remember the man brother ram talks i
[1:03:35] think it's the message respects he talks
[1:03:37] about
[1:03:37] being a man he went into the garage and
[1:03:40] the man went in there and he was brother
[1:03:41] man was talking about jesus christ
[1:03:43] and the man come out said look billy
[1:03:44] you're welcome here anytime but you come
[1:03:46] in but don't bring your jesus here
[1:03:48] and he said wherever jesus christ isn't
[1:03:51] welcome i'm not welcome
[1:03:53] and brother brandon walked out of the
[1:03:55] place he said just a couple of minutes
[1:03:56] that owner that
[1:03:57] that place was walking on the curb and
[1:03:59] he slipped off the curb and fell down
[1:04:00] and a truck just came across
[1:04:02] and mashed him and he died amen and
[1:04:04] brother banner begins to teach us amen
[1:04:06] wherever you go and you know let me just
[1:04:08] say this
[1:04:09] what's happened is people have lost
[1:04:11] their identity they've lost their
[1:04:13] purpose
[1:04:14] that's why we see suicide and anxiety
[1:04:16] people have lost
[1:04:17] their purpose but when you have a
[1:04:19] purpose jesus says
[1:04:21] because i live you can live also and you
[1:04:24] go into all the world and preach the
[1:04:26] gospel and now we have a purpose
[1:04:29] and wherever i go may god help us to
[1:04:32] have a purpose
[1:04:33] to carry on the works of jesus christ
[1:04:36] i don't know if we'll have time to get
[1:04:38] to i'm going to jump a little head
[1:04:39] because now
[1:04:40] they were watching christ but he said i
[1:04:41] go away i'm gonna send
[1:04:43] my spirit to you and now they're
[1:04:44] watching you
[1:04:46] they're watching your life they're
[1:04:47] watching my life
[1:04:50] when they say look they'll never go to
[1:04:51] church we've we've covered that so much
[1:04:54] of we've covered them we've made it sure
[1:04:56] we've got them in the grade we've sealed
[1:04:57] them with laws not only social media but
[1:04:59] now we've got laws and make it sure
[1:05:04] but they still want to sit and watch you
[1:05:06] you make a little mistake
[1:05:08] or something on the job and be like
[1:05:11] what are you watching me for amen
[1:05:13] because when you stand up that's what
[1:05:15] happens when you go back here and you
[1:05:16] get baptized in
[1:05:17] this pool you lay down your identity and
[1:05:20] you come up with a new identity
[1:05:22] that's why we call ourselves christians
[1:05:25] basically that's what you say you see
[1:05:26] how
[1:05:27] how brother man tells us not to uh we
[1:05:29] don't we don't deal on emotion
[1:05:31] on an altar call of those things don't
[1:05:32] you want to see grant your granny die
[1:05:34] you'll never ever see if you don't give
[1:05:36] your heart to jesus you know what you
[1:05:37] want you did you love your granny
[1:05:40] we don't do that lord what is the new
[1:05:43] birthright
[1:05:43] says the new birth is jesus christ
[1:05:45] personally revealed to you
[1:05:48] personally revealed that you are a
[1:05:50] sinner that were born into the world and
[1:05:52] didn't have a hope in the world
[1:05:53] didn't have a prayer as the song says
[1:05:56] we're destined to go to a devil's hell
[1:05:58] but god rich in mercy left the portals
[1:06:01] of heaven to come down to die
[1:06:04] for a sinner like daniel anders and the
[1:06:06] bible says wow we were yet sinners he
[1:06:08] loved us
[1:06:09] and he died for us hope blessed be the
[1:06:12] name of the lord amen brother preaches a
[1:06:14] message called that day on calvary said
[1:06:15] every one of us need
[1:06:16] a that day on calvary will we
[1:06:20] make a trip to calvary we lay our life
[1:06:22] down and say lord i give you
[1:06:23] back my life because you laid your life
[1:06:26] down i want to lay
[1:06:26] my life down as well amen and then let
[1:06:29] the holy spirit come back and fill your
[1:06:31] life
[1:06:32] i mean that's what water baptism is all
[1:06:33] about you say hey i'm i'm going to lay
[1:06:35] down my old man and i'm going to come in
[1:06:37] and i'm going to be baptizing and then
[1:06:39] everybody watch me watch me
[1:06:41] watch me watch me watch me
[1:06:45] because that went back and got water
[1:06:47] baptized
[1:06:48] see this thing is really serious it's
[1:06:50] just sitting
[1:06:51] joining the church hey i go to brother
[1:06:53] biola's church now this thing is serious
[1:06:55] if we could ever get shot in with god
[1:06:56] it's more than a song
[1:06:58] god you really left the portals of
[1:06:59] heaven and you came down to die for me
[1:07:01] and you want to forgive me of my sins
[1:07:02] and you want to put your holy spirit
[1:07:03] back in
[1:07:04] and you want me to go in the earth and
[1:07:06] be a billboard for you yes that's what
[1:07:08] this whole plan of salvation is about
[1:07:10] and the bible sitting down they watched
[1:07:12] him because god has people on earth and
[1:07:15] the world is watching them they think
[1:07:17] they've sealed them in and there's no
[1:07:19] hope and they'll never get out of that
[1:07:20] sickness or barium
[1:07:22] oh but there's a resurrection of the
[1:07:24] christian
[1:07:26] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:28] talking about the power of the holy
[1:07:30] spirit
[1:07:31] amen in christ came out of the grave the
[1:07:33] anointed one
[1:07:34] amen the third day he rose again it's so
[1:07:36] amazing
[1:07:37] how to say in romans 8 if that same
[1:07:39] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:07:41] dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal
[1:07:43] body it'll quicken you from sin and
[1:07:45] trespasses do you believe it today
[1:07:47] we just need to get deep enough in
[1:07:49] christ and shake away from the world and
[1:07:51] stop looking at the world and try to
[1:07:52] stop trying to be like the world and say
[1:07:55] to be like jesus i want to be like jesus
[1:07:57] i don't want to be like the world i want
[1:07:59] to be like jesus
[1:08:00] how's that little song we saying turn
[1:08:02] your eyes upon jesus
[1:08:04] and i tell you those people that have
[1:08:06] turned their eyes upon jesus
[1:08:08] amen they're going to stand tomorrow
[1:08:10] they're going to stand and the next day
[1:08:11] they're going to stand
[1:08:12] see people like sister langley brother
[1:08:15] langley there and they keep standing
[1:08:17] how's the bible says over in ephesians 6
[1:08:19] having done all to stand
[1:08:20] just stand just stand
[1:08:24] i told somebody the other day there
[1:08:25] won't be no question who has the holy
[1:08:27] spirit
[1:08:28] it'll be who those that are still
[1:08:29] standing amen because brother ram says
[1:08:32] everything that doesn't have
[1:08:33] the token of the holy spirit is dying
[1:08:35] and it will die
[1:08:37] so i say lord pour in the holy spirit
[1:08:39] lord pour it into my life god i want the
[1:08:41] holy spirit to bear preachers
[1:08:42] message how can i overcome he said
[1:08:44] you've got to keep life inside of you
[1:08:46] you've got to stay in the spirit of
[1:08:48] revival so if you see somebody raising
[1:08:50] their hands and shouting
[1:08:52] amen say what is the matter with you i'm
[1:08:54] trying to keep revival inside of me
[1:08:56] i'm trying to keep revived in my spirit
[1:09:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:01] that's what revival that's what bringing
[1:09:03] us
[1:09:03] a crazy guy from indiana it's down all
[1:09:05] about the brotherhood
[1:09:06] talked about michigan and all that water
[1:09:08] and the wind blowing on it said there
[1:09:09] wasn't one more drop of water
[1:09:11] in the lake it just got all the trash
[1:09:13] out
[1:09:14] got all the trash out as we go through
[1:09:16] the work and all the
[1:09:17] man it's all around the bumpers our
[1:09:19] phones and advertising and all this and
[1:09:20] we're like okay i'm kind of foggy and
[1:09:23] the bible says don't forsake the
[1:09:25] assembling of yourselves together
[1:09:27] because when you go back to the house of
[1:09:28] the lord and they open up the word of
[1:09:29] god it begins to tell you look you
[1:09:31] weren't of this world we are not of this
[1:09:33] world we're passing through
[1:09:34] where ambassadors of another kingdom
[1:09:36] stop trying to act like this world and
[1:09:38] look like this world and laying up
[1:09:39] treasures on this world we're most
[1:09:41] unrest that's corrupted where thieves
[1:09:43] break through and steal but lay up for
[1:09:44] yourselves treasures in heaven
[1:09:47] we're neither moth nor rust let's go up
[1:09:49] them where thieves don't break through
[1:09:50] and steal
[1:09:51] we need to get our eyes off of this
[1:09:52] world oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:56] brother daniel i don't like that i don't
[1:09:58] like all this clapping and
[1:10:00] praying and singing and shouting and i
[1:10:03] don't like his long hair
[1:10:04] and profit i don't like all that stuff
[1:10:06] well hey don't worry you don't have to
[1:10:08] worry about us much longer
[1:10:10] because amen we're going to be changed
[1:10:12] in a moment a twinkling of an eye
[1:10:14] there's a people that are going to be
[1:10:15] caught up to meet the lord
[1:10:17] oh in just a few more days amen just a
[1:10:20] few
[1:10:21] few more days and we're out of here amen
[1:10:24] god has got us here and there's a lot of
[1:10:25] pressure and then each one of us are
[1:10:27] under pressure like i had that brother
[1:10:28] over here
[1:10:29] but then god puts pressure on you and i
[1:10:30] think everyone that's what the little
[1:10:32] sign i got in my office says be kind to
[1:10:34] everyone
[1:10:34] because everyone is fighting a battle
[1:10:36] you know nothing about
[1:10:38] oh that girl look she cut her hair like
[1:10:40] that person they're fighting a battle
[1:10:42] you have no idea what they're fighting
[1:10:45] you have no idea what they're going to
[1:10:46] the other people you have no idea some
[1:10:48] of those older ones have no idea this
[1:10:50] lesbian and homosexual spirit and all
[1:10:52] those things that have come into
[1:10:54] the minds of the people i tell you we
[1:10:55] need to cast down reasoning listen to me
[1:10:58] cast down reasoning in everything that
[1:11:00] exalts itself above
[1:11:02] the word of god young people listen to
[1:11:03] me cast down anything that's
[1:11:05] contrary to the word of god
[1:11:11] you hear the name noah written in the
[1:11:14] bible because he was a man that took
[1:11:15] god's word
[1:11:16] i don't have any of the names of the
[1:11:18] rest of those people to die
[1:11:20] i hear moses name i don't know pharaoh
[1:11:23] and all those people that came again
[1:11:24] they died in the red sea
[1:11:26] i mean all those pop stars and all that
[1:11:28] nonsense of the world it's all going to
[1:11:30] burn one way
[1:11:31] the bible tells me that all will burn
[1:11:33] with fervent heat the earth will just be
[1:11:35] burned up but there's going to be a
[1:11:36] people are going to be raptured off the
[1:11:38] earth
[1:11:38] because they didn't fit in with all the
[1:11:41] people of the world
[1:11:42] you can't be popular with the world and
[1:11:44] popular with god
[1:11:46] oh may god help us today to get our
[1:11:48] identity back go to the house of god and
[1:11:50] realize we're strangers and pilgrims
[1:11:52] we're passing through this world this
[1:11:54] world is not my home
[1:11:56] can you say amen to that have you got
[1:11:58] your identity in a book
[1:11:59] amen in the word of god my identity is
[1:12:02] not in the world
[1:12:03] amen sisters listen to me if you try to
[1:12:05] get your identity in the world you will
[1:12:06] become depressed and backslide and go to
[1:12:08] the world but if
[1:12:09] you get your identity out of the book of
[1:12:11] god the bible says the meek and the
[1:12:13] quiet spirit is of great price in the
[1:12:15] sight of god
[1:12:16] the world thinks that's crazy but the
[1:12:18] bible says god says man
[1:12:19] that's a great value that's a great
[1:12:21] value that's like a hundred dollars if
[1:12:23] you have a hundred dollars in your
[1:12:24] wallet you don't wear it
[1:12:25] up here where people can steal it no you
[1:12:27] hide that away because it's precious and
[1:12:29] god said that's very precious you don't
[1:12:31] find that very much
[1:12:32] we were reading in devotions the other
[1:12:34] day the bible says he that findeth a
[1:12:36] wife hath found favor with god
[1:12:40] he that findeth the wife hath found
[1:12:42] favor with god it doesn't say he that
[1:12:43] finds a spouse or a companion
[1:12:45] but he that finds a wife somebody that
[1:12:48] cares about
[1:12:49] their husband and and his needs and
[1:12:51] realize the the bible pattern i know
[1:12:53] that's a whole nother
[1:12:54] sermon my wife there was a sister at the
[1:12:57] church i don't know she's got a thing
[1:12:58] where she doesn't eat certain
[1:13:00] kind of meat but she texts my wife said
[1:13:01] what is that certain recipe
[1:13:03] of chicken something said my husband
[1:13:05] really likes it
[1:13:06] so my wife texts her back the recipe and
[1:13:09] said you're a great wife
[1:13:11] why because she was trying to please her
[1:13:13] husband amen and take care of that man
[1:13:16] that's a whole nother sermon we better
[1:13:17] not go into that one
[1:13:19] brother ram said this i am now
[1:13:21] identified in the baptism of the holy
[1:13:22] ghost not something out here on the
[1:13:24] street
[1:13:25] something 40 years ago i have it right
[1:13:27] now the glory and the power of god of
[1:13:29] the forgiveness of sins
[1:13:30] amen i see him heal the sick open blind
[1:13:33] eyes see him foretell things
[1:13:35] he read the the hearts of the people he
[1:13:37] said i'm identified with him in his
[1:13:38] ministry in the last day
[1:13:40] are you identified in the ministry of
[1:13:42] god's prophet i want to be identified
[1:13:44] with that
[1:13:45] i was thinking about that over in the
[1:13:46] book of revelation the bible says i am
[1:13:48] the
[1:13:48] alpha and the omega the first and the
[1:13:51] last listen to me really close i
[1:13:53] probably said this before but if you
[1:13:54] know me you'll hear me say it again
[1:13:55] after this too
[1:13:56] when christ came he had a ministry that
[1:13:58] knew the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:14:01] people's heart we don't have time to go
[1:14:03] through it go get your husband i don't
[1:14:04] have a husband right the husband you
[1:14:05] have
[1:14:05] it's not yours but you've had five and
[1:14:07] the one you're living with now it's not
[1:14:08] yours a woman at the well everybody know
[1:14:09] that story brother bam tells it over and
[1:14:11] over again if you go back
[1:14:12] to where the brother met the angel in
[1:14:14] the little cabin in the message how
[1:14:17] the angel came numbers he
[1:14:20] showed me when brother brandon comes to
[1:14:22] discernment when they're lining up
[1:14:24] prayer lines he said i'm as helpless as
[1:14:25] the baby
[1:14:26] i don't know these people but he begins
[1:14:29] to tell those stories about the son of
[1:14:31] man coming in the bible and program
[1:14:33] tells those same stories because the
[1:14:34] same son of man
[1:14:35] came to william branham and began to do
[1:14:37] the same son of man ministry and
[1:14:39] identified the thoughts of their hearts
[1:14:42] he's the same son of man that's in the
[1:14:44] room today
[1:14:45] he still knows the thoughts of your
[1:14:47] hearts
[1:14:48] do you believe that the bible says that
[1:14:51] in hebrews the word of god is quick and
[1:14:53] sharp and is a discerner
[1:14:55] of the thoughts and the intents of your
[1:14:57] heart
[1:14:58] now once we we get in our minds that the
[1:15:00] word is this book and this is the
[1:15:02] expression of the
[1:15:03] word it's a part of god just like you
[1:15:05] see me but this isn't all of me i might
[1:15:07] write a song
[1:15:08] or i might do some work or brother tom's
[1:15:10] a carpenter and he'd build this
[1:15:12] and that is an ex fresh and whatever he
[1:15:15] builds that's an expression
[1:15:16] of brother tom so you say that is
[1:15:18] brother tom how many understand i'm
[1:15:19] saying the word of god is god in liberty
[1:15:21] letter form what is it peter he said
[1:15:22] the holy men of god were moved by the
[1:15:24] holy ghost all scripture is given by
[1:15:26] inspiration of god but is it saint john
[1:15:28] 1 1 in the beginning was where the word
[1:15:29] was with god and the word was god and so
[1:15:31] this is the expression of god
[1:15:32] but before it was written word it was
[1:15:34] the law goes the word of god
[1:15:36] is everybody with me i know we're a
[1:15:38] little deep in theology it's the logos
[1:15:40] of god
[1:15:42] and the bible says in peter it moved
[1:15:43] over man and they wrote it down and now
[1:15:45] we have an expression written
[1:15:46] but the logos of god this that came at
[1:15:48] his picture with brother branham brother
[1:15:50] braham just happened to be in the
[1:15:51] picture when that logos of god's picture
[1:15:53] was taken
[1:15:55] and that was called the word of god the
[1:15:57] son of man and it's in this room today
[1:16:00] and that son of man knows the thoughts
[1:16:02] of our hearts still
[1:16:03] william branham was just a channel that
[1:16:05] he would line him up and say now let's
[1:16:06] show that this logos can come to me and
[1:16:08] discern
[1:16:09] all of your thoughts and tell you and it
[1:16:10] raised the people's faith he said it
[1:16:12] won't heal you it just raises your faith
[1:16:14] to believe he's in the room
[1:16:16] but right now he's still in the
[1:16:19] the bible says he's a high priest it can
[1:16:21] be touched by the feeling of your
[1:16:23] infirmities
[1:16:24] so right now whatever you're going
[1:16:26] through if we had a prayer line line up
[1:16:27] here
[1:16:28] brother branham was here and you just
[1:16:29] wanted to go through to hear him say
[1:16:31] what you already had and need in your
[1:16:32] heart
[1:16:33] if you stand in the same presence of
[1:16:35] almighty god and believe that he's here
[1:16:36] and you will say lord this is my need
[1:16:38] today
[1:16:39] this is i'm sick of my body lord god i
[1:16:42] don't think i can go and press this
[1:16:43] battle anymore
[1:16:45] amen he's still here to meet your need
[1:16:47] to raise your faith to believe
[1:16:49] that all things are possible
[1:16:53] is it that simple brother dan yeah it's
[1:16:55] that simple he's not dead in the grave
[1:16:57] he rose from the dead
[1:16:58] he's alive he said where two or three
[1:17:00] are gathered in my name
[1:17:02] i'm gonna be right there daniel just go
[1:17:04] and preach the identification of jesus
[1:17:06] christ
[1:17:06] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:17:08] they're gonna recover
[1:17:10] do you believe that in my name they'll
[1:17:12] cast out devils things that
[1:17:14] haunt you and give you mind battles and
[1:17:16] all those things in your mind and tell
[1:17:17] you you're not saved
[1:17:18] you send away your day of christ you'll
[1:17:20] go to church and the gospel will be
[1:17:21] preached and those devils
[1:17:23] will leave their mind and they'll
[1:17:25] believe i am a son of god
[1:17:27] i am a daughter of god i've done wrong
[1:17:29] but the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[1:17:30] me from our sins
[1:17:31] if i confess my sins he's faithful and
[1:17:34] just to forgive us of our sins
[1:17:36] how many believe that would you raise
[1:17:37] your hand let the devil see your hand
[1:17:39] going up yeah you know because the bible
[1:17:41] says without faith it's impossible
[1:17:44] to please god he that cometh to god must
[1:17:47] believe
[1:17:48] it's impossible if you don't believe i
[1:17:51] don't have it here today
[1:17:52] brother bam said if you came to the
[1:17:54] altar he said i want to be saved you
[1:17:55] came to the altar he said you could lay
[1:17:56] there on your face
[1:17:58] the rest of your life he said we would
[1:18:00] bring you food and water and you lay
[1:18:02] there
[1:18:02] and you would die a sinner if you didn't
[1:18:05] believe
[1:18:07] somewhere you have to start believing
[1:18:09] and say i believe
[1:18:11] the blood of jesus christ atones for all
[1:18:13] of my sins
[1:18:15] amen and you know what happens is
[1:18:16] sometimes we don't come to a breaking
[1:18:18] point
[1:18:19] i don't know where this is coming from
[1:18:20] at the time but this is really good okay
[1:18:22] sometimes we don't come to a breaking
[1:18:24] point what we really have to
[1:18:26] how can i say it deal with things we
[1:18:28] have to really deal and we fight these
[1:18:30] battles and that i got in our minds and
[1:18:31] i don't know i don't know if i i said
[1:18:33] brother forgive me that says rather than
[1:18:34] just dealing it says sister come here
[1:18:36] let's sit down
[1:18:36] this has been bothering me i want to
[1:18:38] know that i've confessed
[1:18:40] everything to you and it's all under the
[1:18:41] blood and there's nothing between us
[1:18:43] and you go back and you write in your
[1:18:45] bible this is i you know sometimes
[1:18:46] preachers they preach from experience
[1:18:48] because that happened to me and i went
[1:18:49] back and said lord i can't fight these
[1:18:51] man vitals anymore
[1:18:52] i'm going to go right to the thing i'm
[1:18:53] going to deal with this i went to the
[1:18:54] brothers brother is there anything in my
[1:18:56] and he said brother we're good i i you
[1:18:58] forgive me i forgive you
[1:19:00] i went back i wrote in my bible devil
[1:19:02] you will never push me back
[1:19:03] past this date the bible says whatsoever
[1:19:06] is not a faith is sin and so many times
[1:19:08] we go and we fight mind bottles and we
[1:19:10] never can go forward
[1:19:11] because we're fighting these mind
[1:19:12] battles i believe it's time we draw a
[1:19:14] line in the sand
[1:19:16] i'm not talking about sweeping stuff
[1:19:18] under the carpet i'm talking about
[1:19:20] coming clean and say god here
[1:19:22] it is brother if i've done you wrong i'm
[1:19:23] going to tell you i'm done or wrong but
[1:19:24] i'm not fighting this battle in my mind
[1:19:26] amen again i'm going to be a son of god
[1:19:28] and the daughter of god
[1:19:30] well i don't know what the lord's doing
[1:19:31] today but i i pray that the god will
[1:19:33] help us paul sit in that one place let's
[1:19:35] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:19:39] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:19:41] now we're human because god throws the
[1:19:43] things into the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:19:44] but we're human
[1:19:45] we're not we have a fallacy in our human
[1:19:47] nature we don't forget
[1:19:51] oh jesus say if you don't forgive men
[1:19:53] from your heart neither will your father
[1:19:54] forgive you
[1:19:57] this whole story comes up about you know
[1:19:59] so somewhere we got to forgive from our
[1:20:01] hearts
[1:20:01] sometimes people like yeah i forgive you
[1:20:03] and then 20 years later they're still
[1:20:05] telling the story
[1:20:06] like look hey wait wait you can't tell
[1:20:09] the story if you forgave him
[1:20:12] 20 years ago you'll never he come to my
[1:20:14] house and then he did this and slam the
[1:20:16] truck door
[1:20:16] but he asked you to forgive him you
[1:20:18] can't tell the story
[1:20:20] you can't tell the story anymore
[1:20:25] or you never forgave him you just got
[1:20:28] past that conversation that's what elias
[1:20:30] really say whatever they got to get past
[1:20:32] the conversation but somewhere we got to
[1:20:33] come to the place and deal with it it's
[1:20:35] real men
[1:20:35] we're not babies anymore we're soldiers
[1:20:37] of the cross
[1:20:39] we need to be men brother this i said
[1:20:41] this and i was wrong please forgive me
[1:20:42] sister please forgive me
[1:20:44] i'm going to draw a line and say i'm
[1:20:45] going on and i'll never tell anybody
[1:20:46] that story again
[1:20:48] because you came to me and asked me to
[1:20:50] to forgive you
[1:20:52] this is deep isn't it these are those
[1:20:54] mysteries that are being revealed in the
[1:20:56] last day
[1:20:57] god is coming to get a bride ready so
[1:20:59] she's without spot or wrinkle
[1:21:01] and they're ironing all these things out
[1:21:03] of our nature and out of our personality
[1:21:05] getting all of it ironed out we don't
[1:21:07] we're not filled with bitterness
[1:21:08] sometimes people come to our church the
[1:21:10] time back they came from this other
[1:21:12] church and man they brought in this
[1:21:13] baggage
[1:21:14] of everything that the people over there
[1:21:16] had done wrong to them they came in and
[1:21:17] every time you got done they spewed it
[1:21:19] out
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:21:21] you know what what you need to do is get
[1:21:23] past wherever you came from
[1:21:26] get past wherever you came from i know
[1:21:27] that's a whole lot but the bible says be
[1:21:29] ye
[1:21:29] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:21:32] renewing so many people are in prison in
[1:21:35] their own mind
[1:21:37] and we have the key today if you're
[1:21:39] dealing with things from the past and
[1:21:40] believe me i don't believe in sweeping
[1:21:42] it under the carpet you deal with it if
[1:21:44] it's sin get it under the blood but
[1:21:45] forget those things that are behind us
[1:21:47] and let's
[1:21:48] walk on with god let's be christians
[1:21:50] let's be
[1:21:51] men and women of the cross of christ
[1:21:54] brother branham said i said in the
[1:21:55] backyard
[1:21:56] we branham's fight we fight and scrap it
[1:21:59] he said when we come out to the front
[1:22:00] yard
[1:22:01] we're brothers and sisters i'd like to
[1:22:03] have every preacher and a message here
[1:22:04] talking about that
[1:22:05] yeah we scrap in our emails and our
[1:22:08] phone conversations but when we come to
[1:22:09] public
[1:22:10] we're brothers and sisters in christ
[1:22:12] amen we're standing shoulder to shoulder
[1:22:14] with christ
[1:22:15] and the message of the hour is that okay
[1:22:17] that's what you all wanted to hear the
[1:22:18] preachers do anyway right it was
[1:22:20] somewhere be brothers they meant to love
[1:22:22] one another
[1:22:24] blessed be the name of the lord i gotta
[1:22:26] get back to my notes here
[1:22:28] so i was thinking i gained an hour when
[1:22:30] i come down here so
[1:22:33] i asked brother tom he gave me this
[1:22:34] battery i said that's good for 45
[1:22:36] minutes
[1:22:38] he said oh it's good for two hours and i
[1:22:40] think he said eight hours or something
[1:22:44] six hours we're not going to go that
[1:22:45] long my friend jeff jenkins said
[1:22:48] the seat cannot endure what the mind
[1:22:51] cannot contain
[1:22:52] what the seat cannot endure but i see
[1:22:55] you all have padded pews so
[1:22:56] that gives preacher another half an hour
[1:22:59] we don't have padded pews at our church
[1:23:01] and our every i don't know every service
[1:23:03] is three hours long or something like
[1:23:04] that and they're talking about padding
[1:23:05] them like
[1:23:06] man you're giving a preacher another
[1:23:07] half an hour another hour preaching i
[1:23:10] then probably never want to pad those
[1:23:11] pieces
[1:23:13] i just added a half an hour to your
[1:23:14] sermon i was thinking about that because
[1:23:17] brother man was talking about in the old
[1:23:19] testament
[1:23:21] in the orient they have they they would
[1:23:23] take a piece of paper when they made a
[1:23:25] contract they would take a piece of
[1:23:26] paper
[1:23:28] and they would pair it they had a
[1:23:30] contract they would take the piece of
[1:23:31] paper and they would tear it and then
[1:23:34] they would give one piece to one
[1:23:35] individual and they would give another
[1:23:37] piece to the another individual
[1:23:39] and then they would bring in order for
[1:23:42] the contract to be valid they would come
[1:23:44] back
[1:23:45] and they would try to match the contract
[1:23:49] so they would give one to one individual
[1:23:50] and they'd give one to the other
[1:23:52] then when they came back they had to
[1:23:54] match
[1:23:55] so that you would bring your part of the
[1:23:57] contract back
[1:23:59] then they would bring their part of the
[1:24:00] contract back
[1:24:03] and then they had to match and we say
[1:24:06] yeah that belongs there that
[1:24:08] you all have a contract and brother bran
[1:24:11] says that he said he said god almighty
[1:24:14] took jesus christ up to calvary and
[1:24:16] there he tore it in two he said he took
[1:24:18] the body up to glory
[1:24:20] amen on the sit on the right hand of the
[1:24:22] majesty and he sent the holy ghost back
[1:24:25] and somewhere our life has to match that
[1:24:27] torn half
[1:24:30] that's why everybody's got to make their
[1:24:31] have their day on calvary
[1:24:34] that's why there should never be
[1:24:36] arrogancy and pride and bitterness in
[1:24:38] the church of god
[1:24:40] our egos ought to stop at the door i
[1:24:43] would say we probably
[1:24:44] have some very strong willed people in
[1:24:46] this room just like our church we have a
[1:24:48] lot of
[1:24:48] successful strong but you know what that
[1:24:50] stops at the door
[1:24:52] because when we come in we're brothers
[1:24:54] and sisters in christ
[1:24:55] we are nothing that's what the wedding's
[1:24:57] garment was all about everyone got the
[1:24:59] same garment there were no poor there
[1:25:00] were no rich there were no smart there
[1:25:02] were no energy we're just all brothers
[1:25:04] and sisters in christ
[1:25:05] somewhere we need to be baptized into
[1:25:07] the body by one spirit
[1:25:09] that's how you say well i'll come and
[1:25:10] get baptized now brother bryan said that
[1:25:12] put you in a local body of believers but
[1:25:14] the holy spirit coming into you
[1:25:15] baptized you into the mystical body of
[1:25:17] jesus christ
[1:25:19] that's what we have that's the problem
[1:25:20] we have too many people get baptized
[1:25:22] into a body of local believers but they
[1:25:24] never get baptized with the holy ghost
[1:25:26] and they never get baptized into that
[1:25:28] body that spiritual body
[1:25:30] they never walk that road to calvary and
[1:25:32] lay all of their life down and
[1:25:33] their pride and arrogancy like a sheep
[1:25:35] and they shave all their wool off and i
[1:25:38] got my rights but then said america
[1:25:40] is the the spirit of lady you see is
[1:25:41] people's rights i got my rights i got my
[1:25:44] rights i'm i'm african-american you owe
[1:25:45] me reparations
[1:25:46] my grandparents then you owe me some
[1:25:49] money
[1:25:49] it's people's rights but he said the
[1:25:50] real christian willing to lay their
[1:25:52] rights down and just sheer it all off
[1:25:54] he said he was led as a lamb to the
[1:25:56] slaughter and yet
[1:25:57] he opened not his mouth oh
[1:26:00] maybe we ought to take that as the
[1:26:01] evidence of the holy spirit people that
[1:26:03] can
[1:26:05] keep their mouth shut and they got a lot
[1:26:08] to say
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:12] what are you doing expressing my
[1:26:14] evidence of the holy spirit
[1:26:20] and he opened not his mouth may god help
[1:26:23] us to
[1:26:24] know when to speak and when not to speak
[1:26:27] how does it say it over in ecclesiastes
[1:26:28] there's a time to be born and a time to
[1:26:30] die
[1:26:31] there's a time to speak and there's a
[1:26:34] time to be silenced
[1:26:36] say lord give us wisdom today lord to
[1:26:38] know when to speak
[1:26:40] when did not say all those things we
[1:26:41] know about the brother because if
[1:26:43] he confessed it and is under the blood
[1:26:45] and there's only one thing that can
[1:26:47] bring something out from under the blood
[1:26:48] and that's the devil
[1:26:50] whose agent are you whose agent are you
[1:26:54] you're an agent of the devil
[1:26:55] when god says i put it in the sea of my
[1:26:57] forgetfulness and put up a no fishing
[1:26:59] sign and then you come and fish it all
[1:27:01] back out
[1:27:01] and then show her that i know i'm bored
[1:27:03] he's a christian man look at this this
[1:27:05] this i got it in the paper it's on the
[1:27:06] internet
[1:27:08] but what about the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:09] that cleanses us from all sins and
[1:27:11] you're going and doing it to destroy a
[1:27:13] son of god or a daughter of god
[1:27:16] wow i don't know where all of that is
[1:27:18] coming from but maybe that
[1:27:19] maybe that's that's that's what the holy
[1:27:21] spirit is that's why people don't like
[1:27:23] the holy ghost in their church that's
[1:27:25] why they didn't want it in the book of
[1:27:26] acts
[1:27:26] because they commenced they say anything
[1:27:28] you want to say
[1:27:30] when brother tom comes into brother
[1:27:31] daniel just do it say whatever the holy
[1:27:33] spirit tells you to say
[1:27:34] oh brother darren don't you talk about
[1:27:35] this don't you talk about this don't you
[1:27:37] talk about this
[1:27:39] oh no it's not like it hey just we
[1:27:40] believe in the gifts of the holy spirit
[1:27:42] say and ananias the fire will come out
[1:27:44] like i sold the land for so much the
[1:27:45] holy spirit said you're not lying to men
[1:27:47] you're lying to the holy spirit we need
[1:27:49] the fear of god back in the church
[1:27:51] before we walk through the door we sit
[1:27:53] in our car and say god please
[1:27:54] forgive me of my sins lord i've done
[1:27:56] this and i've done that and we go in
[1:27:58] there and brother daniel calls it out
[1:27:59] lord i don't want to walk in the fear of
[1:28:00] god and certainly that's what the
[1:28:02] communion is all about
[1:28:04] when you come that separates the men
[1:28:05] from the boys the sinners from the
[1:28:07] saints when they come in that communion
[1:28:09] and then you know the bible says he that
[1:28:11] does it and worthily
[1:28:12] takes down nation to himself
[1:28:16] so it's a real showdown time brother and
[1:28:17] said it's the showdown time as a
[1:28:19] communion judas said i'm out of here
[1:28:21] but lord help us to not run out of here
[1:28:24] but just say lord help me lord
[1:28:26] lord forgive me lord jesus and amen if
[1:28:29] the bible says if he if he chastens and
[1:28:31] rebukes you he said be zealous in there
[1:28:33] repent because that means that god loves
[1:28:35] you and i tell you
[1:28:37] you know sometimes i just spend hours in
[1:28:40] prayer saying lord help me lord i don't
[1:28:42] know which way to turn i mean that's
[1:28:44] what walking by faith is all about
[1:28:46] if you know the answers and you can see
[1:28:48] it clearly is there's no longer faith
[1:28:51] you're walking by faith lord lead me
[1:28:52] today father
[1:28:54] david said the lord is my shepherd and
[1:28:56] he leads you today and
[1:28:58] leads you tomorrow we don't know what
[1:28:59] tomorrow holds we don't know
[1:29:01] what covet 21 is we don't know but lord
[1:29:04] you know what's coming
[1:29:06] lord you just help me i just want to be
[1:29:07] surrendered in your arms
[1:29:09] amen i want to walk close to him my i've
[1:29:11] got so much here that i
[1:29:13] in my notes here because the devil has
[1:29:16] put a watch over you too because he's he
[1:29:18] knows there's some names on the lamb's
[1:29:20] book of life
[1:29:21] brother branham says this he said the
[1:29:23] only thing that kept me from being saved
[1:29:24] when i was 12 years old was a spirit
[1:29:26] hanging over me
[1:29:27] a devil saying wait a little longer oh
[1:29:30] you don't think the devil has a watch on
[1:29:32] you too
[1:29:33] raised in a christian home brother bram
[1:29:34] said you got 90 percent better chance of
[1:29:36] going right raised in a christian home
[1:29:39] and that's why the devil and you see a
[1:29:40] little christian and those kids and the
[1:29:42] devils right on they're like right there
[1:29:43] he's watching me trying to
[1:29:44] slip him up and do sometimes things
[1:29:46] happen in the church like oh that kid i
[1:29:47] no the devil's got a watch on me trying
[1:29:49] to get him because he's testing to see
[1:29:50] if their names on that lamb's book of
[1:29:52] life
[1:29:53] doesn't mean we won't make mistakes but
[1:29:54] all i tell you there is a fountain
[1:29:56] that's so filled with blood drawn from
[1:29:59] emmanuel's veins
[1:30:00] and sinners plunged beneath that blood
[1:30:03] lose all their guilty states
[1:30:05] tell you our songs are not just things
[1:30:07] that fill the air entertainment but
[1:30:09] they're
[1:30:09] they're revelations from god there is a
[1:30:11] fountain listen to me here because i
[1:30:13] mentioned this the other day we were
[1:30:14] talking
[1:30:16] about a church because everything
[1:30:18] brother said this he said
[1:30:19] every weapon that the christian has is
[1:30:21] invisible
[1:30:22] it's invisible and it's by faith you
[1:30:25] believe in it
[1:30:26] so it just comes to my mind when i quote
[1:30:28] that song there is a fountain filled
[1:30:30] with blood
[1:30:32] now listen to me real close because the
[1:30:34] carnal mind says okay wait a minute
[1:30:36] you all have like a bird bath a fountain
[1:30:38] and you all fill it with blood
[1:30:40] and you all get in it and run around are
[1:30:43] you with me
[1:30:44] we don't even realize that we're singing
[1:30:46] songs that if you literally
[1:30:48] take them they were like you all are a
[1:30:50] bunch of wackos
[1:30:51] you all go and get in a fountain of
[1:30:53] blood and you get in it
[1:30:54] no you don't realize that everything we
[1:30:56] do is by faith
[1:30:58] we walk by faith and not by sight
[1:31:01] so there are believers that believe that
[1:31:03] christ died
[1:31:04] 2 000 years ago on the cross of jesus
[1:31:08] christ
[1:31:08] and by faith are you listen talk about
[1:31:10] time travel
[1:31:11] the believers have always always had it
[1:31:14] and they take a trip to the old rugged
[1:31:16] cross
[1:31:16] and the blood by faith they believe that
[1:31:19] blood i confess my sins and
[1:31:21] by faith place them in that blood and
[1:31:23] god forgives me and cleanses me from all
[1:31:26] sin
[1:31:27] i praise god brother it's so good
[1:31:31] to preach about something that's
[1:31:32] intangible the world is brother bran was
[1:31:34] trying to get us to look at the
[1:31:35] invisible all the time he's looking
[1:31:37] the invisible is so much greater and
[1:31:39] we're still trying to run
[1:31:40] you know higher fiber wires up to the
[1:31:43] house the foam wire
[1:31:44] and now if you brothers are in
[1:31:45] technology it's all wi-fi
[1:31:47] you know it's all and it's all invisible
[1:31:50] it's like this
[1:31:51] you know i'm way off my subject i hope
[1:31:53] this is okay
[1:31:55] brother man said when you're born he
[1:31:56] said god takes a card and he puts it in
[1:31:59] the
[1:31:59] player to record everything in your life
[1:32:02] he said there's not much
[1:32:03] said for a first little bit until you
[1:32:05] come to the age of accountability
[1:32:07] and then god starts making you
[1:32:08] accountable for everything that you say
[1:32:10] you do it's greater than the television
[1:32:12] because it has your thoughts
[1:32:14] your thoughts and it's all recorded and
[1:32:16] he said then when you die he said
[1:32:18] he puts the card in the rack brother he
[1:32:21] you know think about this is
[1:32:22] pre-technology and the prophet's calling
[1:32:24] it a card
[1:32:25] he said and now we got sd cards and you
[1:32:27] put your trail cams out you pull out
[1:32:28] hey what happened at that time you stick
[1:32:30] it in there some of you have
[1:32:31] you know you you you do this and you
[1:32:33] don't even realize it you all maybe you
[1:32:35] have the cloud like i'm into
[1:32:36] i have a business so we used to save
[1:32:38] everything on our hard drive now we save
[1:32:39] it in the
[1:32:40] cloud we save it out there and we if
[1:32:43] you're
[1:32:43] a computer person there's redundancy as
[1:32:45] a service you save it on this one if
[1:32:47] that one goes down
[1:32:48] we have it on another server and we just
[1:32:49] call it the cloud because we as
[1:32:51] little mortals we don't understand where
[1:32:52] it is but it's out there and i believe
[1:32:54] it because i have all my family pictures
[1:32:56] out there and whatever i just go to the
[1:32:57] cloud
[1:32:58] or i go right here i log in i put my
[1:33:00] name listen to me
[1:33:01] i put my identification and then i'm
[1:33:03] able to access everything that's up
[1:33:05] there
[1:33:06] and man is just catching up in
[1:33:08] technology to where god has already been
[1:33:10] he's already been there the bible says
[1:33:12] there will come a day when all the sun
[1:33:13] man will speak and all that were in the
[1:33:15] grave will come forth
[1:33:17] and the books john didn't he's seeing
[1:33:20] all this happen
[1:33:21] and saw the great video and all these
[1:33:22] people come to each other he didn't know
[1:33:23] i'll just call it a book it's the only
[1:33:25] thing i know to do that keeps a record
[1:33:26] is we keep
[1:33:27] stuff in there and there's a record he
[1:33:28] called it a book and the books were open
[1:33:30] and every man was judged according to
[1:33:32] his works
[1:33:34] see we do it every day we save our phone
[1:33:36] our pictures to the cloud and they go i
[1:33:38] don't know where it is i just go back in
[1:33:39] here and it comes back down i get it's
[1:33:40] in the cloud in other words
[1:33:42] it's there and it can be recalled at any
[1:33:45] time
[1:33:46] you see where the judgment will be at
[1:33:48] that day when god will just call on
[1:33:49] those people into the church service
[1:33:51] oh lord i never did that lord i what are
[1:33:54] you talking about god you sealed all
[1:33:56] right
[1:33:57] hey we got all the time in the world i
[1:33:59] made time we are eternity now everybody
[1:34:00] sit still for a minute we got some
[1:34:02] i want you to see this you go on
[1:34:04] remember that service back in
[1:34:06] 2020 when you were there you just plays
[1:34:08] the video maybe 15 or 20 seconds that
[1:34:10] person sitting in church god
[1:34:12] knocking at their heart ah i want to
[1:34:15] grow up i want to have a little fun and
[1:34:17] go on you wonder what hell will be
[1:34:19] playing that 15-second clip
[1:34:20] over and over and over i mean i had that
[1:34:24] opportunity to give my heart to christ
[1:34:26] to put my sins in the sea of god's
[1:34:28] forgetfulness
[1:34:29] imagine hell i was so close i was so
[1:34:32] close
[1:34:32] i was so close i missed it that's why
[1:34:35] the bible says today if you hear his
[1:34:36] voice don't harden your heart
[1:34:39] amen when i tell you when god puts my
[1:34:40] record in there's going to be all kinds
[1:34:42] of blank spots in it like oh you come up
[1:34:44] right here and then you see this blank
[1:34:45] spot
[1:34:46] and then you kind of and then there's
[1:34:47] all these blank spots you know what that
[1:34:49] is that's the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:51] that cleanses us from all sins
[1:34:55] oh hallelujah you can go back and watch
[1:34:57] my life because the blood i've confessed
[1:34:59] my sins
[1:35:00] oh praise be to god and there's blank
[1:35:02] spots on my tape because the blood of
[1:35:04] jesus christ cleanses us
[1:35:05] from all a double l all of our sins
[1:35:10] oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm
[1:35:12] so glad to preach about something that's
[1:35:14] more powerful than the internet
[1:35:16] oh the internet's really powerful and
[1:35:18] i've probably said this before but man
[1:35:19] you can go back to people's lives 20
[1:35:20] years
[1:35:21] that's what they say when you hire
[1:35:22] somebody they don't go and call your
[1:35:23] references because those all the people
[1:35:25] you ask to say good things about
[1:35:26] you they go straight to the internet and
[1:35:28] they type in who is daniel andrews and
[1:35:30] then you pull up all this stuff like
[1:35:31] yeah we don't need to hire that guy
[1:35:33] they say that i forget it is 80 of the
[1:35:35] people that hire people go to social
[1:35:36] media to see who is this person
[1:35:38] who what are they really all about oh
[1:35:40] blessed be the name of the lord so you
[1:35:42] can't hide from that
[1:35:43] but i tell you the blood of jesus christ
[1:35:44] that comes and cleanses
[1:35:46] the center it's more powerful than the
[1:35:48] internet
[1:35:49] and then the world goes back and tries
[1:35:51] to clean it up they pay thousands and
[1:35:52] thousands of dollars to clean up their
[1:35:54] past that's on the internet they pay
[1:35:56] people you go try to
[1:35:57] clean it up will you clean that up but
[1:35:58] we have an agent called the blood of
[1:36:00] christ
[1:36:01] and sinners plunged by faith into that
[1:36:04] blood they lose all their guilty stains
[1:36:07] well you say brother daniel they can
[1:36:08] still find it on the internet and the
[1:36:09] people our church still knows
[1:36:10] you know what i say to that who cares
[1:36:14] who cares if jesus christ has forgiven
[1:36:17] me of my sins
[1:36:18] then who cares who cares that's really
[1:36:21] i got a sign in my office and it says
[1:36:23] there is one man that i have to please
[1:36:26] jesus christ
[1:36:28] oh we need to get our identity back
[1:36:30] every day
[1:36:32] i wake up in the morning and i have well
[1:36:35] you should do this
[1:36:36] you should listen you know your critics
[1:36:38] for the time

[1:36:41] you'll never please them all
[1:36:43] there's just too many you can't you
[1:36:44] never and you know let me just say this
[1:36:47] i hope i'm not over time give me a few
[1:36:49] more minutes
[1:36:50] and the more you try to do the more you
[1:36:52] get yourself out there is the more
[1:36:54] people will criticize you
[1:36:55] if you just sit here and do nothing man
[1:36:58] he didn't
[1:36:59] scream he didn't wasn't long didn't

[1:37:14] years whatever you've been
[1:37:15] preaching and trying to do what's right

[1:37:18] the punctuation if the stamp
[1:37:20] matches and all that nonsense just send
[1:37:21] it do something for the lord
[1:37:26] every one of us have something we can do
[1:37:28] for god
[1:37:30] every one of you listen to me young
[1:37:31] people every one of you have something
[1:37:33] unique that god put in you that nobody
[1:37:36] else in the world has
[1:37:37] and god wants that to be used in his
[1:37:40] kingdom
[1:37:42] we have people in our church young boy
[1:37:44] 11 years old perfect pitch i think
[1:37:45] hey i like what what key is that in
[1:37:48] he'll tell you right boom boy he listens
[1:37:50] to me hey i just turned around
[1:37:51] what's up he tell you exactly it's
[1:37:52] perfect pitch it's a gift
[1:37:54] and god has put gifts in every one of
[1:37:56] the bodies let me challenge you what are
[1:37:57] you doing with your gift
[1:37:59] for jesus christ
[1:38:02] let me say this what are you doing with
[1:38:04] your gift for jesus christ
[1:38:07] and then i'll preach a whole story on
[1:38:09] the talents remember the man who got
[1:38:10] five
[1:38:10] he made ten man that got two he made
[1:38:13] four
[1:38:14] then there was a guy that had one and he
[1:38:15] went and buried it so we know the whole
[1:38:17] story going through it but when they
[1:38:18] asked a man that had one he said look i
[1:38:20] knew you was a steer man
[1:38:21] and listen to me real close right here
[1:38:23] he said i feared
[1:38:25] unless i would lose it so let me ask you
[1:38:28] today that gift that you have that
[1:38:29] nobody else has
[1:38:30] it might be beauty you might just be the
[1:38:31] most beautiful person in the world
[1:38:33] and people look at you and you can
[1:38:35] either use it to
[1:38:36] sway them and make take men in a
[1:38:38] perverted way or you can stand there and
[1:38:39] be dressed in whole he's like man look
[1:38:40] at that beautiful woman and she's
[1:38:42] dressed holy
[1:38:42] and she point people to jesus christ but
[1:38:45] the bible says because of
[1:38:46] fear this person wouldn't use their
[1:38:48] talent
[1:38:50] you might have a great talent to sing
[1:38:51] but you're afraid to sing in church
[1:38:53] because somebody else has told you when
[1:38:54] you were young and they scarred you
[1:38:56] and you live under that fear but the
[1:38:59] bible says perfect love
[1:39:00] cast out fear amen perfect love casa he
[1:39:04] said fear has torment and torment you i
[1:39:06] know i should use that for god but they
[1:39:07] said something like that but perfect
[1:39:08] lord lord i am unique
[1:39:11] you gave me this i have a lot of faults
[1:39:12] i have a lot of failures but lord you
[1:39:14] did give me this and i can use this for
[1:39:15] your glory
[1:39:16] i tell you i think you you see
[1:39:18] songwriters come out you'll see a few
[1:39:20] little children writing poems
[1:39:21] you see people that love god and maybe
[1:39:23] they all you got to smile
[1:39:25] use it there's so few people got them
[1:39:27] upside down
[1:39:28] they just turn it over be a smile so i
[1:39:30] challenge you today use whatever you
[1:39:31] have for the glory of god
[1:39:35] i don't know why you all are pulling all
[1:39:37] of this out of me
[1:39:38] but the bible says be ye transformed by
[1:39:41] the renewing of your mind
[1:39:43] if you've created your own prison then
[1:39:45] it's time to get out of the prison
[1:39:47] i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i
[1:39:50] don't have time to preach about
[1:39:51] complexes brother ram talks
[1:39:52] look in the computer looking up brother
[1:39:53] and talking about complex he said all of
[1:39:55] us have complexes
[1:39:56] every one of us do we have complex and
[1:39:58] so brandon how do i overcome a complex
[1:40:00] you know what he says so powerful he
[1:40:02] said do the opposite
[1:40:04] just do the opposite nobody loves me
[1:40:08] and we loved you just take the outfit
[1:40:10] man everybody loves me
[1:40:12] i can't believe it brother tom everybody
[1:40:15] loves me it's amazing everybody loves me
[1:40:18] that's just hey i love you all too
[1:40:20] hey god bless you everybody's hurting
[1:40:22] your own living this fear
[1:40:23] you've got an inferiority complex you
[1:40:25] know what i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:40:26] daughter of god god left all of heaven
[1:40:27] came down and died for me
[1:40:28] he thinks i'm great he thinks i'm worth
[1:40:30] something blessed to be the name of the
[1:40:32] lord and he gave me this union unique
[1:40:34] talent and i'm going to use that for god
[1:40:35] and you're not going to stop me i'm not
[1:40:36] going to let fear
[1:40:37] stop me blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:40] devil's got a watch set on you
[1:40:42] and when the angels come and roll away
[1:40:44] from the roll away the stone
[1:40:46] maybe that little stone that's been
[1:40:47] there on your life
[1:40:49] but the holy spirit maybe this morning
[1:40:51] is rolling away that stone
[1:40:53] maybe the devil said like i got them so
[1:40:55] seared in there man it was their dad
[1:40:57] when they were just little kid told them
[1:40:58] they were stupid and they always lived
[1:41:00] in this hole
[1:41:02] but the holy spirit is bringing you out
[1:41:04] of that
[1:41:06] you know people talk about predestinated
[1:41:08] seeds god never predestinated seeds to
[1:41:10] stay in a package
[1:41:11] he he predestinated those seeds to be
[1:41:14] planted and to grow and manifest
[1:41:16] whatever the seed was supposed to
[1:41:17] manifest
[1:41:19] i say today let's start growing let's
[1:41:21] start manifesting what god wants us to
[1:41:23] have
[1:41:24] so what will it be brother daniel i know
[1:41:25] it'll be love and joy
[1:41:28] and peace and long suffering and
[1:41:30] gentleness oh that's a really good one
[1:41:32] gentleness i wish everybody get a real
[1:41:35] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:41:36] and get real manifestation of gentleness
[1:41:40] wouldn't that be so nice in that hard
[1:41:42] nature like hey kid's getting out of
[1:41:44] here and whip y'all
[1:41:46] oh well daddy you need more of the holy
[1:41:48] ghost
[1:41:49] well brother daniel's talking about the
[1:41:51] gentleness daddy you need that
[1:41:54] brother man said sweeten your temper
[1:41:56] with prayer
[1:41:59] sweeten your temper oh this is okay the
[1:42:02] bible says as many as are led by the
[1:42:04] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[1:42:06] so you really have to be careful when
[1:42:07] you come to a real holy ghost field
[1:42:08] church and let the holy spirit say hey
[1:42:10] say anything you want to me
[1:42:11] lord i fall short i want to be the bride
[1:42:13] lord speak to me
[1:42:14] today i was in the hotel and we're in
[1:42:16] there i woke up really early and i heard
[1:42:18] these people on the hall and they were
[1:42:20] ah
[1:42:21] and you know what the holy spirit
[1:42:22] brought to my mind brother bram said
[1:42:24] don't
[1:42:24] fuss don't fuss he said if your family
[1:42:28] fusses he said don't you fuss
[1:42:30] he said the holy spirit doesn't fuss
[1:42:36] david said thy word i've hid in my heart
[1:42:39] that i might not sin when i get in a
[1:42:40] situation
[1:42:41] tomorrow something might come up and the
[1:42:43] believers and this in the holy spirit
[1:42:44] says don't fuss
[1:42:45] don't fuss remember temptation
[1:42:49] brother man tells his cure for
[1:42:50] temptation my brother danny man these
[1:42:52] women
[1:42:52] this pornography just said and there's a
[1:42:57] brother daniel fashion i can't even hold
[1:42:59] my tongue brother dan you wouldn't
[1:43:00] believe i'm so tempted i know that
[1:43:02] nobody knows about it and i could just
[1:43:03] tell him and it just really made me feel
[1:43:05] good
[1:43:06] and you're tempted you know what brother
[1:43:07] said how to overcome temptation
[1:43:10] this is branding when you get people
[1:43:12] right to that point and then
[1:43:14] he said just walk away from it
[1:43:17] just walk away from it said if a snake's
[1:43:19] right there a little bird flies
[1:43:21] snake come up and just cobra snake he
[1:43:23] just does this and you get meds
[1:43:25] and then the snake bites you i don't
[1:43:28] overcome that
[1:43:28] just walk away from it oh brother dana
[1:43:32] come on man that's so
[1:43:33] simple that's so oh that's childish
[1:43:37] i don't i don't want to walk away from
[1:43:39] it that's our problem right there
[1:43:42] that's it's not the temptation it's
[1:43:43] something in you
[1:43:45] that doesn't want to walk away from it
[1:43:48] so it's not that thing out there is you
[1:43:50] have a desire and you keep going to it
[1:43:54] because the solution is really easy just
[1:43:55] turn and get away from that girl
[1:43:57] get away from that boy get away from
[1:43:59] whatever is keeping you out of church
[1:44:03] and just say i'm going to get away from
[1:44:04] that thing because there's nothing more
[1:44:06] important than the kingdom of god in the
[1:44:07] church of god in the house of god
[1:44:10] that's really simple but the bible says
[1:44:12] you'll know the truth
[1:44:13] and the truth will make you free and so
[1:44:16] now it's not the temptation oh it's
[1:44:17] something in
[1:44:18] me that desires and now we can deal with
[1:44:20] the real problem is something in me
[1:44:22] lord there's something alive inside of
[1:44:24] me that shouldn't be there lord
[1:44:26] and if you come today i'm not going to
[1:44:27] go in a rapture i pray god that
[1:44:29] it would die inside of me lord take it
[1:44:33] out of me let me climb up on the altar
[1:44:35] and have my day on calvary let me be a
[1:44:38] living
[1:44:38] sacrifice that's what paul was talking
[1:44:40] about his desires
[1:44:42] a living sacrifice after six hours four
[1:44:44] thousand years of limbs and cut in their
[1:44:46] throats god said i
[1:44:47] i hate them i want some living
[1:44:49] sacrifices
[1:44:50] i want people who are willing to lay
[1:44:51] their life down and say lord not my will
[1:44:54] that sure will be done that's what our
[1:44:56] great master jesus christ said he said
[1:44:58] not my will lord
[1:44:59] let your will be done oh blessed be the
[1:45:02] name of the lord because people are
[1:45:03] watching you
[1:45:05] i've got a quote here a lot of preachers
[1:45:06] use it brother said that there'll be a
[1:45:08] in the last days it is again another
[1:45:10] people in the land who under their
[1:45:11] messenger will be the final voice
[1:45:13] to the final age my wife and i were
[1:45:16] talking about that together
[1:45:17] we're sitting in a restaurant it's
[1:45:19] amazing i said a few more minutes
[1:45:22] up in kentucky a few is a little
[1:45:26] thank you so we're sitting in a
[1:45:28] restaurant we're talking about this
[1:45:30] you believe the footsteps of the
[1:45:31] righteous are ordered by god
[1:45:33] everything you do is not my chance god
[1:45:35] has it all ordered in your life
[1:45:37] sometimes i preach to myself god you've
[1:45:39] got it all ordered you just have to take
[1:45:41] the next step lord i'm walking by faith
[1:45:43] every day you know as you get in a place
[1:45:46] god has you in a place and
[1:45:48] people come to you somebody come to me
[1:45:49] the other day said this is the will of
[1:45:50] god for your life and every day i'm just
[1:45:51] like okay whatever
[1:45:53] i can make that to happen in in enough
[1:45:55] in a two-minute conversation
[1:45:57] i can tear down everything that i've
[1:45:59] built for 50 years
[1:46:01] that's why we as you get older people
[1:46:03] walk softer and they're slower and young
[1:46:05] people like ah come on make a decision
[1:46:07] how are we going to go eating like who's
[1:46:09] going to be there is it going to be
[1:46:10] unbelievers going to be eating with
[1:46:12] us backslidden people going to influence
[1:46:13] my family and dad starts walking a
[1:46:15] little slower
[1:46:17] past or something oh we ought to just do
[1:46:18] this the pastor starts walking a little
[1:46:19] slower
[1:46:21] so my everybody's listening i don't see
[1:46:24] anybody sleeping this way
[1:46:26] hopefully the holy spirit will come down
[1:46:28] your aisle and speak to you
[1:46:31] that's why people walk away is because
[1:46:33] the holy spirit isn't given free reign
[1:46:35] that he can speak to every one of us
[1:46:36] right where we are
[1:46:37] each one of us mom holding a baby you're
[1:46:39] an individual and dad and
[1:46:40] young people they're going through
[1:46:41] trials but if we'll let the holy spirit
[1:46:43] just come say lord
[1:46:44] speak to us lord god help us lord i
[1:46:47] can't make it another day
[1:46:49] without you i need you father
[1:46:52] i've got another plaque on my wall at
[1:46:53] home one day i'll take a picture of all
[1:46:55] the things on my wall and just go preach
[1:46:56] a sermon on it
[1:46:57] another one that said god never intended
[1:46:59] his children to be self-sufficient
[1:47:03] he did he he raised them to be dependent
[1:47:06] on him
[1:47:08] i've got three sons and i raised them to
[1:47:10] be independent i don't want him coming
[1:47:12] to me to ask me how to change a tire
[1:47:14] look you're a big boy go do it i don't
[1:47:16] ever had girls i don't know hey you

[1:47:23] right there
[1:47:24] but a boy is like no get out there and
[1:47:26] get your hands dirty and get that
[1:47:28] i raised him to be independent but god
[1:47:29] didn't raise his children to be
[1:47:31] independent
[1:47:32] jesus said except you become as a little
[1:47:34] child you can't enter the kingdom of
[1:47:37] heaven
[1:47:38] i think some of us have just thought we
[1:47:39] growed up in a kingdom of god and god
[1:47:41] said you can't enter the kingdom of
[1:47:43] heaven as a grown-up
[1:47:44] you got to enter it as a little child
[1:47:46] lord i need you
[1:47:48] or will you please hold my hand i cannot
[1:47:50] make it
[1:47:51] we get in this routine oh we're just
[1:47:52] going to church and just another service
[1:47:54] like
[1:47:54] lord i can't make it i need you lord i
[1:47:57] don't know this covet they keep changing
[1:47:59] the rules in the lord what should we do
[1:48:00] lord give us
[1:48:02] wisdom they told us they're going to
[1:48:04] come and burn the city down there and
[1:48:05] our church is right there on the streets
[1:48:07] like lord what do we do we need you
[1:48:09] lord i need you i don't want to walk a
[1:48:10] day without you
[1:48:13] so my wife and i were sitting in the
[1:48:14] restaurant and we were talking
[1:48:17] about this quote the final voice to the
[1:48:20] final age i'm always like what are you i
[1:48:21] mean we're talking about it you think
[1:48:22] really think sisters are going to have a
[1:48:24] pulpit and a preaching land we're
[1:48:25] talking
[1:48:26] so we get up from there we drive to this
[1:48:27] place we're doing some landscaping and i
[1:48:28] i heard more flower names in
[1:48:30] the last couple months and i ever want
[1:48:32] to know in the rest of my life
[1:48:34] my wife wanted to know it and so the
[1:48:35] bible says dwell with him according to
[1:48:37] knowledge and if she wants to hear
[1:48:38] flower
[1:48:39] names i better learn flower names so we
[1:48:42] go to walnut ridge and we go in there
[1:48:43] and this african-american man comes out
[1:48:45] with my wife
[1:48:46] and she starts walking with her and he
[1:48:48] says you know what i know you
[1:48:49] she said i don't know you don't know me
[1:48:52] she said he said no i
[1:48:53] i've seen you in the mall i've seen you
[1:48:55] dress with your long hair and your dress
[1:48:57] he begins to talk to her about the lord
[1:48:59] and the things of god
[1:49:01] so all of a sudden we realize that a
[1:49:02] voice is maybe not the voice of your
[1:49:04] mouth but it might be the voice of your
[1:49:06] life
[1:49:07] remember abel was dead and he was in a
[1:49:08] grave and god comes to cain and said
[1:49:10] where's your brother i said i don't know
[1:49:11] where my brother is
[1:49:12] he said but his voice crieth the blood
[1:49:15] his blood
[1:49:16] crieth from the earth he was dead but
[1:49:18] his voice was
[1:49:19] crying through the earth and i believe
[1:49:21] the bride is going to have a voice
[1:49:23] and it won't be so much a spoken word as
[1:49:25] it will be the life that is
[1:49:27] lived out people are watching you
[1:49:31] oh they'll never make it they'll never
[1:49:32] make it they're watching you
[1:49:34] but there's a resurrected christ that's
[1:49:36] come out of the grave
[1:49:37] blessed be the name of the lord i'm
[1:49:39] gonna read this quote i'm gonna try to
[1:49:41] close
[1:49:42] brother ram said i think it's a very
[1:49:43] fine example for we parents today is to
[1:49:45] set an example before our children
[1:49:47] you'll live your best and worst at home
[1:49:50] i think our lives or our children might
[1:49:51] not exactly
[1:49:52] act like they're noticing it they are
[1:49:54] noticing it
[1:49:56] don't you ever think they're not because
[1:49:58] they're watching
[1:50:00] we were kidding we were some of the
[1:50:01] young people not long back and they went
[1:50:02] through
[1:50:03] all the people in the church the
[1:50:04] brothers and how they prayed and they
[1:50:06] mimicked them like
[1:50:08] they prayed just like this is how this
[1:50:09] brother prayed this this is how the ron
[1:50:11] spencer preaches how my brother john
[1:50:13] says
[1:50:13] amen hallelujah they went through all
[1:50:16] the brothers they're listening they're
[1:50:17] watching you
[1:50:18] we had a brother at our church called
[1:50:19] brother mills and here we go hey
[1:50:22] he said it on the tape brother and
[1:50:23] refers to him we when he prayed
[1:50:25] we never closed our eyes because he'd
[1:50:26] take his fingers and go hey
[1:50:28] hey we watch him do like that and it's
[1:50:31] been 50 years 40 years ago and i still
[1:50:33] remember his
[1:50:34] life is still speaking to me we're
[1:50:37] watching one another
[1:50:39] brother ram said not only the children
[1:50:41] are watching but our neighbors are
[1:50:42] watching not only the neighbors are
[1:50:43] watching but
[1:50:44] all of your you're associated with
[1:50:47] watching you
[1:50:48] the people at your church are watching
[1:50:49] you the people you do business with in
[1:50:51] the markets are watching you after your
[1:50:53] confession
[1:50:54] this is so amazing open up your heart
[1:50:56] right here brother i'm going to say this
[1:50:58] and we should always try to reflect
[1:51:00] christ
[1:51:01] in everything that we do
[1:51:06] should always try to reflect christ in
[1:51:08] what we do
[1:51:09] now that right there will cure road rage
[1:51:17] we should try to reflect christ in
[1:51:19] everything that we do
[1:51:21] may god help us that when we leave this
[1:51:24] service in a few minutes the word of god
[1:51:25] will still speak to us
[1:51:27] it's not a dead letter it's alive it's
[1:51:29] alive the word of god is quick and
[1:51:31] powerful and it's a discern and when we
[1:51:32] leave
[1:51:33] we hide that in our heart and it begins
[1:51:35] to speak to us and we get out there in
[1:51:37] school or something happened in the
[1:51:38] business deal
[1:51:39] probably god said don't fuss i don't
[1:51:41] know hey we'll work it out somehow and
[1:51:43] you begin to back away from it
[1:51:45] i can't control my mouth well if you
[1:51:47] stopped five minutes before
[1:51:49] all that happened you would have
[1:51:50] controlled your mouth so may god help us
[1:51:53] and sometimes you get in situations i
[1:51:55] don't know why the holy spirit's
[1:51:56] bringing us down this road sometimes you
[1:51:57] get in situations maybe church
[1:51:58] situations
[1:51:59] and this and that you could say a lot
[1:52:01] i've sat in rooms with people for i
[1:52:03] don't know maybe
[1:52:04] minutes with silence because you know
[1:52:08] the power of what you say in your word
[1:52:10] and
[1:52:10] we should walk softly and weigh our
[1:52:13] words
[1:52:14] and use wisdom and not say something
[1:52:17] that you have to come back
[1:52:18] two years later and say i'm sorry i
[1:52:20] shouldn't have said that may god help us
[1:52:21] to slow us down in this
[1:52:22] fast-paced world that he slows us down
[1:52:25] and say lord help me lord
[1:52:27] guard my lips david i think it was job
[1:52:29] said i put a
[1:52:30] i think one he said he put a gate on his
[1:52:32] eyes but put a guard on our lips
[1:52:36] lord help us i was thinking that
[1:52:37] ephesians 5
[1:52:39] 15 says see then you walk circumspectly
[1:52:43] not as fools but wise
[1:52:46] hey man a few musicians will come
[1:52:50] one time i was preaching i thought you
[1:52:52] know
[1:52:53] some of those brothers they preach those
[1:52:54] dynamic sermons and man you get the camp
[1:52:56] and everybody's running like
[1:52:57] i'm like lord i'll never be able to do
[1:52:59] that because it seems like every time i
[1:53:01] preach it just comes down and it's quiet
[1:53:03] and it's sober
[1:53:04] but you know that's the way the great
[1:53:06] judgment is the bible says judgment will
[1:53:08] become at the house of
[1:53:09] god and we're being judged by the word
[1:53:13] of god
[1:53:14] the bible says that the bride made
[1:53:16] herself ready and so we're sitting in
[1:53:17] the judgment
[1:53:18] house of god and god is saying there is
[1:53:20] mercy
[1:53:21] we need to accept it in our lives
[1:53:25] i was thinking about that little story
[1:53:26] you've probably heard it there was a man
[1:53:28] he was
[1:53:29] laying in bed or he was
[1:53:32] praying and he said lord i want to thank
[1:53:34] you i haven't lied today
[1:53:36] he said i haven't lost my temper with my
[1:53:39] wife
[1:53:41] i haven't chewed out my kids i haven't
[1:53:45] cheated on my taxes he said but i'm
[1:53:48] getting ready to get out of bed lord
[1:53:50] and i'm gonna need your help today
[1:53:54] you know that's where it needs i don't
[1:53:56] know if the pressure is that great in
[1:53:57] your life before i ever get out of bed
[1:53:59] the devil is right there and i'm saying
[1:54:01] lord i need you
[1:54:05] if you come in the pressure in my life
[1:54:07] you'll hear me say god help me
[1:54:09] at four or five o'clock in the morning
[1:54:11] and say god help me i need you
[1:54:13] because the devil is so powerful but i
[1:54:16] met a greater force which is jesus
[1:54:18] christ
[1:54:19] and i learned a long time ago that if
[1:54:21] you yield to this black dog
[1:54:23] he'll destroy you he'll destroy your
[1:54:25] life he'll destroy your testimony
[1:54:27] he'll destroy everything about you and
[1:54:29] we come to the house of the lord to
[1:54:30] learn wisdom
[1:54:31] and when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:54:34] the lord will raise up a standard
[1:54:35] against him
[1:54:37] you come to the house the lord said
[1:54:38] brother daniel i don't know but you may
[1:54:39] be facing something this week or next
[1:54:41] week and you come today and the holy
[1:54:43] spirit says
[1:54:43] hey put this in your arsenal put this
[1:54:45] and just we're sitting here maybe an
[1:54:46] hour and a half something like that
[1:54:48] you put all this like i was saying if
[1:54:49] you get covered you lay in bed and you
[1:54:51] load all that word up and now we slow
[1:54:53] down and lady will see it for an hour
[1:54:54] and a half
[1:54:55] and god puts all this word inside of us
[1:54:58] because he knows you're going to need
[1:55:00] those bullets when you're going to go
[1:55:01] out there and the enemy comes in like
[1:55:02] this and
[1:55:03] there's a scripture comes in like this
[1:55:05] oh we got wisdom in the body of christ a
[1:55:07] little wisdom yeah hey i'm not gonna
[1:55:08] fuss with you hey
[1:55:09] i'm sorry i don't fuss anymore i used to
[1:55:11] you used to be able to really get me but
[1:55:13] you don't get me anymore all that
[1:55:15] temptation you know the holy spirit came
[1:55:17] into me that sunday and
[1:55:19] filled my life and i just walk away from
[1:55:20] that thing now i just get away from it i
[1:55:22] know what it'll take me that snake will
[1:55:24] bite me
[1:55:24] it'll paralyze my my christian walk in
[1:55:27] five minutes everything that i've built
[1:55:28] in the testimony will be taken from me
[1:55:31] i'm not going to go down that road i'm
[1:55:32] going to stay close to christ
[1:55:34] can you feel that real gentle spirit how
[1:55:37] many can feel that you just
[1:55:39] out of my flesh i don't care about see
[1:55:40] taste there's a spiritual man
[1:55:44] and it feels that presence of god i
[1:55:46] think paul said it like this he said
[1:55:47] he said the love of god constrains me
[1:55:49] it's pulling at my heart
[1:55:51] the bible says it's not his will that
[1:55:53] any should perish it's not god's will
[1:55:54] that any would go to hell
[1:55:56] and you come in the presence of god and
[1:55:58] you just feel that pulling like go this
[1:55:59] way
[1:56:00] go this way go this way
[1:56:03] let's just bow our heads heavenly father
[1:56:08] lord i've done my best to be a vessel
[1:56:12] that you could speak through father
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:15] i know someday lord i will be in
[1:56:18] judgment for
[1:56:19] the words that i've said
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:22] and lord i've done my best to point
[1:56:24] these souls to calvary
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:27] they wouldn't get a plane tick getting
[1:56:30] fly
[1:56:31] to israel somewhere but by faith lord
[1:56:33] they would travel
[1:56:35] they would place their sins at the foot
[1:56:36] of the cross and say lord forgive me of
[1:56:39] my
[1:56:41] lord i tell them about a scripture that
[1:56:44] is greater than any
[1:56:46] thing of the world lord we cast down
[1:56:48] reasoning and anything that would tell
[1:56:50] us the word of god is not true and your
[1:56:51] word says if we confess our sins
[1:56:54] he's faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:56:56] our sins
[1:56:57] i wonder was every head bowed if there
[1:56:59] would be someone and say brother daniel
[1:57:00] god's dealing with me and i want to
[1:57:01] raise my hand
[1:57:02] and say god forgive me today god bless
[1:57:05] you god bless you

[1:57:22] god you say brother daniel today i'm
[1:57:24] coming back to jesus christ
[1:57:26] i'm going to surrender my heart
[1:57:27] completely back to maybe you've got
[1:57:29] tears in your eyes it's okay
[1:57:31] the bible says a broken and a contrite
[1:57:33] heart god will never despise it
[1:57:35] he'll never turn away a broken heart a
[1:57:37] contrite heart
[1:57:39] and say lord please forgive me lord
[1:57:40] jesus please help me
[1:57:42] maybe there's someone that says brother
[1:57:44] daniel i don't have the power to walk
[1:57:45] away from that temptation
[1:57:47] i need the holy ghost and i want god to
[1:57:50] fill me with the holy ghost and you'd

[2:02:52] had covenant and take him back to the
[2:02:53] home and they only looked through a
[2:02:54] window and see him
[2:02:55] talked to my friend yesterday his wife
[2:02:57] had a surgery she's in a place he said
[2:02:59] once a month
[2:03:00] he said i get to look to a window that's
[2:03:01] 60 feet away and see my wife sitting
[2:03:04] there for 15 minutes they put us on a
[2:03:06] phone that's time delayed
[2:03:07] and we just see each other maybe you got
[2:03:10] a sickness maybe you've got an
[2:03:11] illness in your body you're like i don't
[2:03:14] know how to get past this
[2:03:17] there's only one hope and that's jesus
[2:03:18] christ
[2:03:20] are we real people we don't live in a
[2:03:23] fairy tale
[2:03:24] we live in a real world and sometimes it
[2:03:26] brings tears to your heart
[2:03:27] sometimes there's things we've done in
[2:03:29] our past that affect us maybe little
[2:03:31] scars or disappointments and you have
[2:03:32] that little disappointment
[2:03:34] sometimes there's handicaps in your life
[2:03:38] and that little handicap is what keeps
[2:03:40] you close to christ
[2:03:42] paul said lord three times he said lord
[2:03:46] will you take away this handicap my eyes
[2:03:48] brother em said after the light blinded
[2:03:50] me come back he had to write in big
[2:03:51] letters he said
[2:03:52] thrice he said i besought the lord and
[2:03:54] god said my grace is sufficient for you
[2:03:57] that is a little thorn in your flesh
[2:03:58] that will keep you humble
[2:04:00] sometimes god puts things in our life to
[2:04:02] keep us humble
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:07] prophet angel meets him said i'll be
[2:04:10] with you he said no man will stand
[2:04:12] before you all the days of your life
[2:04:14] how a pride could come then he goes in
[2:04:17] he said i was getting my hair cut
[2:04:19] brother talking to a man about
[2:04:21] hunting he said he reached back and got
[2:04:22] a bottle dumped him
[2:04:23] sulfuric acid carbolic acid dumped it on
[2:04:26] his head and he lost his hair
[2:04:28] so now he's he's bald headed seventh
[2:04:30] grade education
[2:04:32] he goes into those brothers and he said
[2:04:34] we sit at a table
[2:04:35] and he has he has those brothers his
[2:04:37] friends who were educated said you sit
[2:04:38] behind me if they start talking theology
[2:04:40] in terms he said
[2:04:41] i'll kick you under the table and you
[2:04:42] say the word because i don't even know
[2:04:44] what they're talking about
[2:04:45] and god puts a little handicap in a
[2:04:47] prophet's life he sits there before the
[2:04:49] people crying
[2:04:50] i'm as helpless as a baby unless he
[2:04:52] comes
[2:04:54] and god puts those little handicaps in
[2:04:55] every one of our life so that you'll
[2:04:57] walk close to christ
[2:04:59] you won't get proud but you'll just walk
[2:05:01] real humble lord help us
[2:05:03] he puts that in ministers lives that
[2:05:05] make him walk real soft like lord i need
[2:05:07] you
[2:05:08] lord i need your help sometimes he puts
[2:05:10] sickness in our life
[2:05:12] to keep it like the little lamb that
[2:05:13] keeps going astray puts a little
[2:05:14] sickness
[2:05:15] actually broke his leg allowed him to
[2:05:17] hurt so that he would walk close to the
[2:05:19] shepherd
[2:05:21] so the shepherd would carry him somehow
[2:05:24] i just say this we need to walk close to
[2:05:25] the shepherd today
[2:05:27] it's the only thing that's going to get
[2:05:28] us out of here is jesus christ
[2:05:30] let me provoke you let me encourage you
[2:05:32] if you maybe you're a young person hey i
[2:05:34] got talents i got abilities let me tell
[2:05:36] you the word of god says the way of a
[2:05:37] transgressor it's hard
[2:05:39] it's a hard life out there that's why so
[2:05:41] many of those people that
[2:05:43] the world thinks is successful commit
[2:05:45] suicide and
[2:05:46] take this kanye west or whatever this
[2:05:48] guy's here somebody said he's a
[2:05:49] billionaire
[2:05:50] millions and millions of dollars and he
[2:05:52] thinks he's always great
[2:05:54] goes out there and tries to become a
[2:05:55] christian business christian rap out in
[2:05:57] joel steen's church and all this stuff
[2:05:58] and now he's he's losing his mind and
[2:06:00] just going through divorce
[2:06:02] the the kardashians and i don't know
[2:06:04] these people don't watch them just
[2:06:05] hearing their names and you watch
[2:06:06] because the bible says the way of a
[2:06:08] transgressor it's hard
[2:06:10] and you see michael jackson he gets on
[2:06:12] phenomenon and takes his own life
[2:06:15] uh elvis presley and all these guys and
[2:06:17] they it looks so good
[2:06:19] katy perry looks like she got a great
[2:06:20] career she started out singing christian
[2:06:22] songs
[2:06:23] she wanted to be the next amy grant of
[2:06:25] christianity
[2:06:26] and her album was a flop she goes on you
[2:06:28] see it on youtube she said i'll sell my
[2:06:30] she told the devil i'll sell my soul to
[2:06:32] you if you'll make me successful
[2:06:34] and satan has made her successful to the
[2:06:36] world but she's lost her mind
[2:06:40] you know what's greater than learning
[2:06:41] from your mistakes
[2:06:43] is learning from somebody else's
[2:06:44] mistakes so i don't want to go down that
[2:06:47] road
[2:06:47] i see what that does to a marriage i'm
[2:06:49] not going to do that i see what that
[2:06:51] does to a young person i'm not going to
[2:06:52] do that i'm going to stay close to
[2:06:54] christ
[2:06:55] amen because a christian has a hope in
[2:06:57] jesus christ
[2:06:58] oh don't you love the lord just feel
[2:07:01] that little holy spirit
[2:07:02] if you need a feeling of the holy spirit
[2:07:04] it's just that something that you feel
[2:07:06] outside it's coming and living on the
[2:07:08] inside of you
[2:07:10] and sealing you and never leaving you
[2:07:11] and it's always with you wherever you go
[2:07:13] you get close to somebody and the holy
[2:07:15] spirit will say don't do that
[2:07:17] get away from them be like okay and you
[2:07:19] learn to
[2:07:20] jesus the bible says that jesus learned
[2:07:22] obedience by the things that he suffered
[2:07:24] you just overcame i'm going to do it
[2:07:25] anyway
[2:07:27] little dove just steps back go ahead you
[2:07:29] can talk and be fussy but i'm not going
[2:07:31] to be with you
[2:07:31] and you go through a couple days
[2:07:33] grinding through that
[2:07:35] you know lord i need the holy spirit i
[2:07:37] need you back lord
[2:07:38] brother i said it didn't change you
[2:07:39] you're not a sheep he said just the dove
[2:07:41] took his flight he's up on the limb
[2:07:43] you repent and the dove will come back
[2:07:44] of the holy spirit
