amen I know Mike and grace are out of town they see different ones not here this morning we just trust everybody have safe travels wherever they are amen then this evening brother Brad will be bringing a message this evening so we're looking forward to that amen amen so if you will stand with to the word this morning let's bow our heads first Lord Jesus the prophet has taught us to always talk to Au of the word first ask for divine uh interpretation so to speak knowing god that it'll take your Holy Spirit to really open the word to our heart we can might know it in our minds it takes you to open it to our hearts so that we can really be changed and go from here different than what we come are goal and our mission is always to leave better than we came no matter father we just ask God that you'll just bless each one that has come this morning Father receive something special from you today as only you can give Lord Jesus for we know that when you speak Lord you make make a difference and you will maybe those coming from the road to us did not a heart burn within us as he spoke to us along the way Lord and we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever and I ask God you would just help me God to get out of the way step aside and let you operate Lord Jesus Through heart mind and lips Lord Jesus the things that you once said to your people keep me from saying anything in myself or that I shouldn't say name we ask amen and amen so I kind of feel like I've gone a on a little series anyway we'll just see how far it goes but amen I just I called it amen the gospel in the nutshell we want to just B kind of go over the whole scope of the whole Bible amen the whole thing amen and just kind of follow the inspiration of the Lord because we know that there's much there all right amen and so we just pray God will help us to uh you know to go and follow his way that he wants to go and amen and so I think amen talk a little bit about the power of knowledge knowledge being power ain't that right and so so we want to kind of pick up on that and maybe recap on it just a little bit but basically I felt like titling it Power by identification Power by identification amen so if you will let's go to our originales I guess over in First Corinthians First Corinthians I believe it is I don't have a ink pen or do I yeah I got an ink pen here I want to try to make these scriptures as I go through them amen First Corinthians and verse six how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen isn't that something that God said the hidden wisdom that he had stored up and kept secret was For Your Glory how many believe that that's For Your Glory it's yours not the world's it's yours and it's for you Amen in Ephesians also in Ephesians amen 1 and we'll be begin with verse n having having made known un unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him Amen in whom all Alo we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen I think we made it also clear um in in Wednesday 3 uh n it says and to make all men see what of The Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen that now unto Heavenly places and powers in Heavenly places might be made known by the church amen by the church to wisdom of God Amen praise the Lord amen amen so we see a hidden wisdom here amen that God has had kept secret for ages and ages and ages amen and with this wisdom or this knowledge uh and we might think of well what about Revelation brother berer what about Revelation it's more important to have Revelation than it is knowledge well Revelation is knowledge Revelation is knowledge because brother Bram said a revelation is something means something that was previously hid or covered but now it's uncovered and now you know now you have the knowledge of what's back there amen amen and so when that comes forth amen when that is made known it gives you power it gives you amen authority over the devil there's different aspects of that knowledge that knowledge can also be experienced amen because we learn through the School of Hard Knocks or amen Simply Having God come down away amen as every every son and daughter of God has to have a personal experience with almighty God Amen because if you don't have that personal experience you really don't have the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen amen we're living in quite an age aren't we quite an age it's quite something how to uh um I believe it was when John the Revelator had given the Book of Revelations and he wrote it isn't that right but he was told to seal it up amen and write it is that right there's a certain portion of it that he couldn't even right amen now how many knows what that was the seven SE ain't that right the Seven Seals he was forbidden to write just what it was amen and it was going to be revealed by the voice of the seventh angel so when we look at the knowledge of God begin to understand what uh what was in the mind of God Amen and uh and sometimes you think well this is something that we have learned and we're kind of past that sometimes when it comes to the church ages right there we think well the church ages that's something that's in the past you know or it's you know we're not into the church ages anymore we're in the bride age we've been called out of Leo but we know the prophet said the Leia age in the actual time goes all the way to the end it is the last age is that right amen but you know as I begin to study on this subject I begin to think of how much how much and really you could call this a uh uh Power being released through knowledge part two but I I named it something else because I want to kind of go in a different direction for a little while if I can with the help of the Lord amen I shouldn't have said that now I forgot my thought all right yes and I begin to think you know that's kind of in the past but you know uh there's this God it the seals in the church had to be something special it was something special for God to hide it and to keep it until the very end like what we have amen amen and it was only going to be opened hour now I've I think everybody here knows that taught that with the fullness of the word comes the fullness of the spirit right amen one place brother Dale Potter he said you know he thought he was born again he had a word birth but brother B one talked about you can't have a word full word birth until the full word comes know so even he was was kind of stifling cuz he thought you know until you have the full word come can't have a full birth amen and so like Luther sure you know he had a certain portion of the word but he had just shall walk by faith amen wednes T night we got touched on a have time to go into it I want to go into it just now even because it comes back to mind but we realize that as knowledge opens up power opens up there's power in understanding power uh in in in know knowledge power and that might begin to in my mind it got my mind went back to amen how that you know these these phones right here amen how they started out amen and how they used to communicate through what they called the telegraph system ain't that right amen they used to be able to lines and polls and everything and and and and they used to use Morris code right well I guess they did I wasn't sure so I asked Siri and this is what she told me okay she said developed in the beginning of the 1830s a telegraph line was a person-to-person textt message system consisted of multiple tele graph offices linked by an overhead wire supported to to Telegraph pulls to send the message an operator at an office would tap on a switch called a telegraph key creating pulses of electric current which spelled out a message in moris code amen so imagine that that that's the way they communicated and send the message was tap tap tap tap tap tap tap that's how this started out is that right and I thought that's kind of like Luther it was wonderful it was powerful that shall walk by faith they shall live by faith but how many know we've come so much further than that so much further but they ask if they could run those lines they didn't have to send mail anymore they could just Telegraph it you know and how many remembers that when you begin to actually get your uh phones and I don't know if it's brother Joe Adams Brother Brad or who it was but mention the old dialup phones you dial up and go wait until they come back wait till they come back wait till they come back and and at one time we remember how that in the to have a make a phone calls they would have operators right and the from what I understand seeing a picture somewhere in it I suppose it's right they would pull this wire out and this wire out and push it in here and you want to go over here or you want and they had to plug you in so that you can communicate with [Laughter] people folks I'm here to tell you about how it is with Catholicism and am me all the religions you know you got to go through me before you can get to CH man you got to go through this or do this in order to be in Christ no no not anymore Jesus is a mediator between God and man I don't care where you are you can talk to him anytime you don't have to have your pastor to talk to him amen thank the Lord ain't that right praise the Lord and so we think about that think about how that back in the old days you know we used to think that you know Mars Cod d d d you know try to get a message across it's almost like amen being Amish and they says boy I'll tell you what if you ain't Amish you going to hell well how that well tell me why I'm I'm going to hell or being menite or all this that or the other we've come much further than that we're much more precise than that but a brandham even said belonging to church ain't going to save you there ain't no church going to save you there's only one place to get saved that is in the Jesus Christ the son of the Living God there's no other name given under heaven whereby you must be saved I like that don't you praise the lord we think about all of those things all of the things that has been let loose and all the knowledge that has been increased we realize that there is a knowledge that has been increased in the natural world and brother brandham said the natural always types the spiritual Amen in power and everything what they can do and how they can how they can get around and so forth and is in the spiritual realm amen praise the Lord so we don't want to be in the horse and buggy age anymore is that right Amen brother bam if you'll remember most of you all understand the the message know that brother bam typed the uh the pro the progression of the Gospel amen as being in the type of a the fullness of Christ Christ in the form of a man coming back up that Luther was the feet Wesley was the chest area isn't that right y'all remember that wesle his chest magnification of the heart you know and they come along to speaking in tongues amen comes all the way up here and now we're way up Tong's age amen and then what was after Pentecost oh a prophet is here that could tell you what color hair Eve had that could tell you interpretation of the gospel of Christ amen no more than none of that but how many know that we're past even even mentioned being past that age that's not the last age that's not the last thing because what is above that what is above the eye the brain the mind what we call the Mind ain't that right and we're in the mind age amen now we're ready to preach we're in the mind age folks amen praise be to God Amen now let's look at this let's look at um and I want to look at with the help of the Lord and boy I feel like I just do a horrible job at it and my wife don't like when I demean myself up but I still when I realize how much better it could be we just do the best we can is that all right but as we think about this and we think about the the phrase that we say that with the fullness of the word comes the fullness of power isn't that right well you know that's just one phrase tell me brother B tell me how it is that with the fullness of the word power or it gives you amen the the the weapons to fight the devil withen and I want to try to take a couple of those things if I can this morning before communion and look at amen that actually gives us Authority ain't that right over the devil all right so before I go on the M I'm going to I'm going to jump back to something else that comes to my mind amen and and I'm going to go back another step because I think of something else that okay and amen and I want want if I can wow wow wow all right here we go must be right here when I started this series this is the quote that come to my mind when I thought about God in a nutshell and and the scope of it all amen so this is the quote that come to my mind amen think about God and what he had in his mind what his purpose was like we've read though what was the purpose of God that he uh does everything according to the counsel of his own will how many knows this is God's plan amen the thing about God in the mind of God is is we got to look at what God's plan is amen and what the what the whole thing is this is just a little fraction that I want to share it with you he says now here in is the love of God he desired in love a family of his own I mean know that's what God had in mind God wanted a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself amen we'll pull up on that like himself how many know we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son now when we go back into the identification in a little bit we'll talk about how that God puts a desire of in us to be be like somebody okay Amen to be like himself that Sons like himself therefore before him lies all of mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels of honor and the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones that are born of his spirit will be trained to conform to the image of uh in their walk amen how many it in the nutshell is that God wants you to be a son he wants you to be and he wants you to learn and he wants you to grow into the stature of Christ that's ambition that's his goal that's why troubles that's why trials that's why tests that's why all of these things are that's the main ambition was he wants children just like what sitting with your children with this morning that was what God had in mind now it wasn't luy and City it wasn't Adam and Steve it wasn't no he didn't have all of that message right no he had a family a man and his woman they shall be joined to each other and and the making of a home that's what he had in mind but this is the quote that came to me as this series amen he reproves with all longsuffering with gentleness and mercy who chastens with nails SC hands spotter must take the vessel that he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it just exactly as he desired but it is love that is love another way of Love there is not praise be to God Amen Hallelujah now let's talk about the opening God bringing us the seven Church ages God bringing us and showing us the seals what it really was I believe that it released a power in his church amen look what was once in God's what was once God's secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put into the hearts of believers woo aren't you glad that what he had in his mind what was in the back part brother B called it back part of God's mind is now and the Believers amen that is the body of Christ which was and he says it again what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made made manifest to think friends I'm sure that we don't get it I just can't see it we don't see it the way that we ought to I'm sure that we don't amen but God's mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and it was given down to his church to manifold wisdom of God once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ says it again he's making love to his church his bride whispering secrets to her I want say Whispering secrets to her but he is giving her the weapon that she needs the devil in this hour praise be to God very familiar quote that we know but I want to read it again when we think about the church as well we don't think we can't just look it at as well you know the church page I message some people don't even believe in the church age book but brother BR that just never disallowed it hello and I believe God Vindicated it amen so listen Satan knows assured that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claimed as his own praise the Lord I want to here's one of the weapons here's one of the things that I that because of the opening of the church age because of the opening of the seals amen the releasing of knowledge also releases power here's the first point I want to make you might not think so but I will bring it out let me show you another reason why Satan hates This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not how many knows that our messeng amen his theme was that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and when you take that and you don't believe that the days of Miracles has passed the Holy Ghost wasn't just for the book of Acts and then people back then no but he's the same that gives you power to know that God is with you where you are wherever you're working whatever is he's the same yesterday today and forever and the devil will be defeated because you believe that amen praise the Lord he knows it more than a lot of 90% of Theologian he knows that since God is immutable in his nature he is just as immutable in his ways amen then he says Satan knows assuredly that God is coming for a Mark 16 and amen this is the true church that she claims for all else is listen to this now he makes two points he says the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen Our foref Father wasn't Martin Luther John Wesley or that it was God all the way back to the bu acts we are continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist spirit and what he would do that he would come in amen and try to make the he would try to make defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless how many know to learn to T that once you've been given the instruction once you have been informed once you have the knowledge of how the devil works and how did he punch us amen when that punch comes you can counteract that punch and knock him out amen but you got to know how the devil works and that's what Revelation does that's what knowledge of God does add to your virtue knowledge amen knowing right from wrong knowing the scriptures how me Godly knowledge of the word of God is important that's right amen so this church ages isn't over it's still giving us the power amen just if you want to know how just read the instruction say that a lot would that be okay if you want to know how to overcome the greatest battle ever fought if you want to know what the battle really is and where it is read that book if you want more faith in God we read perfect Faith amen that's what it means whenever you talk about with the fullness of the word comes fullness of power amen when that message come and it reveals things it gives you power but you can't just leave it in the on the shelves or on the book on the tapes you've got to tap into it cuz there's rapturing faith in this message hello but the B said there's untapped resources amen and there's rapturing Faith so I believe believe that in this message lays rapturing faith on the way to church I was thinking you know if you want to be dressed if you want to get dressed for the Rapture if you want to be dressed as the bride the brother B said I am dressing the bride this message dresses the bride this message bring ready for the Rapture praise the Lord GL to God we thank him for that otherwise we would be in Sodom we would be made like a gamorra amen we would be committing the sins of that great Harlot but we heard The Voice come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues that you partake not of her sins I'm G say like Brother Brad let's just for time for a while it jumps at me you know you got communion you got to cut this short you'll never get through this get on back out of there devil we're going to take all day if he takes that amen we probably won't but we'll at have that mentality is all right all right amen all right praise the Lord God is good isn't he I like that exposes listen Revelation exposes the devil and he don't like that the word exposes the devil the seals exposed the devil and how he worked all and how he's working even today amen people will try to deceive the whole world but what gives us power amen is this this knowledge that God given to us first of all the Holy Ghost amen the need of the Holy Ghost it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people editing of God's word right down to the time that he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work I like that but I'm here to tell you if you got little Revelation amen knowledge that'll give you a little power that word says that you can do the Greater Works not brother not Ron Spencer not Donnie Reagan not no you can do the Greater Works everyone none of a Believer can do the Greater Works all things are possible in that believe that that's right oh my listen what she stands for she can do the work Greater Works she will be an invincible Army Invincible stoppable like culos it don't matter how many many them he chopped them all out should I say Samson would be a better example it don't matter how many was invincible what this church this is what this Revelation this is what the knowledge of God the opening of the seal so for the church ages does it makes it where you you really want to be you can be Invincible but I believe that we got to have a perfect strength by Perfect weakness where the B says well we forget our own abilities and we die to ourselves and realize that it's God you that he's more than able to do the work we've got to have a little bit of total Deliverance complete deliverance God gives complete Victory God gives complete deliverance to where you can be a complete Christian come on folks I don't care who you are I even me I'm still not what I want to be cuz I I have a passion in my life and that is to be like Jesus amen that's right every man woman that's really dedicated to God and is a Christian and called and elected wants to be like Jesus amen that no Thomas berer don't think that it's all in the past there are things revealed in here that's still good a matter of fact I believe it's all still good A lot of it may be of what happened in the history but there's a lot of it that's still real for you like yesterday today and forever amen if Moses butab said Moses was I I believe it was him when he says you know amen he Liv so to God he was God servant and Pharaoh didn't know what to do with him amen I'm glad that a man God better says the devil don't know what to do with him amen and the devil's not your biggest enemy The Devil's not your biggest enemy this guy right here yeah that's right look in the mirror that's your biggest enemy me it's this flesh it's the desires of this flesh that wants to Prevail it wants to have this it wants to have that amen that's what you got to watch for the greatest battle that ever was fought wasn't fought externally it was fight in the human mind amen what is where where is that battle at will you take the devil's doubt or you will take God's fa Faith amen how many believes there's a battle all the time the devil will try put doubt in your mind about this doubt about that and you have to say devil just get on out of here I believe what God Said Amen how many knows how do we get Victory how do we overcome By The Sword of the spirit amen the sword of the spirit I didn't a revelation of this until some time ago amen he was talking in Ephesians 5 talking about finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might put on the whole AR that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and so forth take the whole helmet of salvation and so forth and above all take the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to all the fiery dark of the flesh or the wicked ain't that right yeah by having the faith of God in your heart it Shields you from the fiery Darks of the enemy everything he throws at you how many knows that Shield of Faith really protects you from a lot of garbage a lot of mess but the point I want to make is in verse 17 and take helmet of and the sword of the spirit now in our minds we've been taught a lot about knowledge Faith or the word of God knowledge word of God letter by itself dead huh but it takes the spirit to Quicken it I mean is it two-part amen and sometimes we realize that perhaps it's like the mechanics and the Dynamics maybe you know all the Dynamics but you need I mean you know all the mechanics but don't have the Dynamics well what if you have all spirit all spirit and no mechanics now didn't brother say Jesus didn't try to defeat the Devil with speaking in tongues or using his gifts he didn't try to use him oh I feel it whenever the Devil Comes you and and you need to overcome this Lord I want to feel it is that what you use no you don't go by emotion what do you use mechanics the word is that right the spirit is the Dynamics the word it's the mechanics I'll tell you what you go out there throw a gallon of gasoline on the grass and light it and boom it just burns out and it it barely even Puffs huh but you take and you run that gas through a motor into a motor into a cylinder and just one little as you pick put the gas pedal down there one little squirt in that one in that uh piston chamber isn't that right from what I little I understand about mechanics and it pushes that piston up the compression of that gas push pissing up and all of six or 16 cylinders amen they putting gas not too much just enough to make that pop up and get your engine running that gas that just you know people huah praise the Lord I like all of that but put that but say sometimes we need to take some of that power and that that that Steam and then make the engine go instead of blowing it all out the whistle oh I like the whistle but we got to put it into action ain't that right put it into engine and the way that you live every day when you go to the job the way you treat your wife the way you treat your husband the way you treat your neighbors the way you treat your workers how faithful you are in church and how dedicated you are come on people how much you pray amen take some of the Dynamics and make it work with the mechanics amen and I'll tell you that's why the word of God that's been revealed is the mechanics and God gives all of this but if you don't know what to do you're still lost remember but says it's like one man has the money in the bank but he don't know how to write a check these said fundamentals they have money in the bank but they don't know how to write a check and the other one have all kinds of Mone because they got all kinds of money but they don't know how to ride it and me get them together get a bunch of money together and do that write out the check and know how to do it then you've got something it's it takes both amen ain't don't gas don't no good if you ain't got a car to driveing in Holy Spirit don't no good if you don't word to use on the devil it's also written amen Paul said in Ephesians say take the helmet of salvation of the spirit which is the sword of the spirit is the word of God that word is really cuts the word is what cuts hey amen so let's see if we can't just give a big old mouthful of this and let him choke on it all right amen so he says uh you know if we really get a true Revelation I I'm just G to go slow if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and with the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before here amen you got to watch a church I'm a pastor I know you got to watch people you got to watch backslid people you better be able to discern if somebody got a backslid spirit on them or a spirit of division begin to complain about this come on folks Ain told you better discern the Antichrist Spirit the wrong spirit and if you discern it you know it you'll be able to guard against it but if you don't know what's going on you'll be caught up in that big bunch of gossip and you'll get all poisoned up hello amen before you know you're defiled and everything else in the Frank of the church to be able to discern a natural believer and a spiritual believer amen you you got to be able to discern it because if you don't you get caught in it but if you get if you discern what it is you can only discern it by the word so glad we got the word aren you amen he will be as definitely thwarted when Christ withstood his every effort to gain amen thwarted as today as when Christ withstood his every effort as he tried to gain power over him in the desert all satan hates reev but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us but we will prevail against them this is my ambition this morning besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Patient Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge amen well I know him I have the knowledge of him let's not be unfruitful in that knowledge if you have these things then you won't be unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but he that liketh these things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins where therefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your and elections for if you do these things you shall never fall it's a gigantic word ain't it brother bad never fall never fall amen I'm glad you didn't say stumble huh how many knows as long as you're in this flesh you'll make mistakes brother Brown said you'll always make mistakes as long as you have because it's this flesh always trips you up causes you to stumble but if you do things you'll never fall how many believes you'll never fall because he won't let you fall amen Lord that's how we want to be stand Paul said having done done all to stand stand therefore having little annoyance G about with truth how many beli this is the hour evening light Tabernacle as your pastor I tell you this is the hour to walk softly before for the Lord on an everyday basis be ready at any time whether camela gets in or whe whether she doesn't I believe the scripture is going to be fulfilled either way amen it would almost be more scary if she didn't get in amen because perhaps that scripture then is already fulfilled and the next thing's a fire for the world but it's for you and I amen that's right living in very dangerous as brother brandham said scary and dangerous times but if you have you have nothing to fear we don't have amen praise the Lord amen God Bible is a mirror a book of identification how many believes that that's the one thing another thing it is in this shell so to speak is it identifies it's a book of identification Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit and by their fruits ye shall know them if a man loves a man he's a sodomite he's identified as a sodomite we used to call them perverts because that's what they are I'll still call them that perverted amen I want to say something else is that okay a little bit political but not so much I'm sure brother Brandon would say it because he set the whole world go insane anyway anybody that thinks that biological males ought to play with biological females and that that is fair has lost their mind that's right you're crazy and you ought to be put in the Looney Bin half of our congressmen congresswomen off the Looney Bin that's right cuz that's crazy how many know is that right they've proven it physically and everything else amen the world has gone insane identify praise the Lord even Jesus said to the Pharisees you know you say that God R is uh the sky red and L you can discern the time but you can't discern the signs of the time and you say that if we' have been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers no with them and killing and so forth but here you reject me and that right so you bear witness of yourselves that you're the children of them that the prophet Jesus identified them as being Hypocrites and anybody that says that they believe the Jesus of Calvary on Calvary and then rejects what he did today is also a hypocrite you can't reject him there I mean reject him here and say you accept him there Jesus plainly said what you do with him today is you to done with him back then it's a book of identification amen boy looking in that mirror he looked in the mirror and he didn't know who he was and going back and forth and doing same said Mama that's me how many pouth rock with her with our forefathers I had to I'm part of her I rode with Paul River to warn her of her dangers if I'm a real American citizen I landed on Plymouth Rock I wrote with Paul Riv to warn her of her dangers amen you know what I'm meaning I cross the icy Delaware with George Washington with his barefooted soldiers I was there for I'm identified with this nation amen I stood with Stonewall Jackson when the outs were against him when bullets were going through his goat amen he wouldn't Pudge amen when he was asked you know how can you stand like that and he replied I don't take a drink of water before thanking my God for it amen he had no fear he was Fearless no doubt but he was a Christian amen how many believes when you get oh my let me tell you something how many believes and when you get born again this is jumping ahead a little bit when you get born again you identify yourself with almighty God God by water baptism am mean by being baptized in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ you're not ashamed to be baptized and identified as a Christian oh I like this to be an American like Brother Brad was saying you know we have that uh patriotic spirit so to speak we hate it hurts us to see our country die because that's what it's doing dying try not to let any Pol politics bother me amen don't know whether I'll go down to the voting station or not everybody's welcome to do it if you want to no problem amen but it doesn't matter what I I voted for Christ brother Ram said I voted for him and I'm sure to win amen listen but to think that as an American I hoisted that flag in Guam I was with them when they hoed the flag and go oh my I don't know if I should say everything comes to my mind but when I think about all of those soldiers that gave their lives to take off Hitler and evil to keep evil out and now these younger people that'll go up and say well we were there too and we did it too I remember seeing it on YouTube where this World War II or or this vet you know and they smart mouthed him and and dissed him and everything said he said somebody give me a gun I want want to shoot them I was like whoa why because they fought and died for our freedom and then they spurn it they're not worthy of it amen aggravate people that give their lives blood hello and then to have others come and just squander it what they give their life for 20 years millions of 20 year olds that sacrific their lives so we could have freedom and then the others don't mind if people take it from them no wonder it would get the righteous or the indignation of somebody like that up a little bit amen oh my it sure does listen after thousands of Americans gave their lives when they amen hoisted that flag when that little group run up there and throw that flag up I was identified in raising that flag every one of us was all American citizens was identified with that flag hanging over Guam amen how many remembers that and all she is I am all her glory is my glory all her shame is my shame if it's done shameful shameful things I stand her reproach if she receives Glory I receive her glory with her amen praise be to God and then he goes on to begin to talking about the New Testament and how it how it is with God Amen how many believes that we're identified with Christ when we're are a Christian amen when you become a Christian you are identified with almighty god brother Bram says it this way you who are born again before the foundation of the world God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life Jesus died and sent the Holy Spirit here to call you to eternal life you have received it he sealed you you're there till the day of your Redemption you talk about hold them on that's not it do I hold on no it's him that did the holding on it isn't what I did it's what he did oh man praise the Lord how many believes that's how it is remember if you're born again I like that phrase if you have eternal life once you're born again that's when you recognize who you are how many believe that when that Holy Spirit comes in there and God consumes your sacrifice your repentance he fills you with the Holy Ghost and you've got the peace that passes understanding I've got the wonderful love of my Blessed Redeemer way down in the depths of my heart amen I've I've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory my sins all been washed away and I know oh I know yes I know I'm saved I feel the Holy Spirit deep inside how did Paul say he says by this you all know that you're his if you have his spirit and me then you begin to understand hey you know I'm not some beat down no good insignificant nobody anymore I am a son of God now I can H my head up a little bit and say devil where are you why because God is my father I realize who I am I've got Authority I've got more Authority than the angels in heaven W you come to the Revelation even brother B bring it out he says you know that when you get the Holy Ghost amen God hands you a checkbook amen with his name sign it don't have to be signed all you got to do is know how to fill it out if you need the Holy Ghost just know how to fill it out see I believe it's mine man that's right I like how that brother brandham took when he was identified as American you and I we were born I was born up in Worcester Ohio I was born in America and when you're born in America you're Auto automatically an American citizen when you're born of the Holy Ghost you're automatically a Heavenly citizens you're not an illegal immigrant you don't just shake hands with the preacher J join church that's an illegal immigrant not supposed to be at all you've got to be borned understand I love the immigrants I'm not saying anything bad about them but the the philosophy of it when you come to the spiritual realm of God hello you got to be borned again born in America makes you an American and he says I was there I was there with Paul Paul rever I wanted to call him Paul Raider I don't know what he was but anyway one of those forefathers rever Paul rever riding on that hard saying the British are coming the British are coming isin that right I was there at Guam I was there I went as a matter of fact I went all the way to Plymouth Rock where he landed amen all the way there come to America to be Americans praise the Lord all the way back now we want to give the devil a black eye this morning before changing the order service we want to take this power to it comes with the fullness of the word because the devil likes to try to tell us that we're not God's child that we're not going to make the Rapture that we're not good enough he tries to put fear and doubt in our hearts and Minds no doubt a lot of times amen but let's see what the word says about it amen blessed be to God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen in Us in him when you got born again when you repented when you had a certain Revival went to a certain meetings young people went to a certain place and you got the Holy Ghost that's when you was saved that when you was called you just recognize who you are amen you accepted what Christ did for you on Calvary that's all it was is you coming to yourself and spiritual Amnesia brother talked about spiritual Amnesia it's like we had spiritual Amnesia I was in the world didn't know who I was drinking beer and doing all the things that I shouldn't have done didn't know who I was I thought I was a rock and roller or this that or the other hello everybody wants to be something you want to be identified with something even brother brah said you know take Hopalong cassid and man when you watch Tarzan of the Apes and you want to be living in a tree but blessed be to God the day that Christ come into his heart and he wanted to be like Jesus if everybody would want to be like Jesus you could dismiss the police force you could truly defund the police if everybody be the kind of Christian that they supposed to be thank god brother Brad our deacons aren't too busy because deacons are policemen in the church everybody is the way they're supposed to be they don't have to do nothing they got no job to do nobody's disorderly huh that right we're glad to have him sitting there most of the time I remember a legalistic that you kids oh my you wouldn't have liked the deacons in years ago did you hear Brother Steve say that back there he knows man you just whisper or you just say one one thing another they come up and tap you on the shoulder they were strict my wife was telling me a story the other day it was crazy and and they were praying I guess everybody was praying and she whispered over to somebody else right in the middle of the prayer he made a loud no noise and stomp back there you know while they were praying and you can't do that and she was like he made a whole lot more serpents in her little Whispering I ever thought doing but he was one of those enthusiastic deons you know that just my my that's right she said made more noise coming back to oh boy here he comes because police that's right could dismiss the police force if everybody want to be identified in the right way amen let me stop there and let me just read you something here your brother Ram says remember amen like in the beginning God was not even God he was the great Eternal and then there was his attributes his thoughts and then it became a word like this it was expressed a thought expressed is a word a word expressed is a thought and then remember if you was ever in God's thinking then you'll always be there punch that devil devil don't try to talk to me okay my Prophet told me the Bible says that if I ever was in God's thinking I'll always be there so shut up Glory praise be to God you'll always be there if you've got eternal life talking about being born then you are the expression or the attribute of a thought for this age he went into detail later the way that you look your size your very name amen everything about you he knew all of that before the first star was made amen there's only one eternal life and it always existed and you in his mind existed before there was a world Amen that's the reason he chose you before the foundation of the world praise be to God let me com on down there now listen remember your statue your eyes your whatever you was you were in thinking at the beginning according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love how many can say amen that's me I am in him and I'm in love with him he predestinated you to be in love with God Amen having predestinated unto the adoption of children but Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen praise the Lord his thinking at the beginning the only thing that you are is an expressed word after he thought it he spoke it and here you are oh if that isn't if that doesn't if you wasn't oh boy here comes a are you ready for something real heavy this is real heavy and I want to I want to put a 360 what did I call that I wanted to do a uh I want to turn it over so to speak I want to turned this over for a minute and the only thing that you are is expressed word he's spoken here you are if it isn't if you wasn't in his thinking there's no way for at all for you to ever be there for he's the one that gives eternal life it's not him that willth nor him that runneth but God that shows Mercy all right so we said if you wasn't any thinking there's no way that you'll ever be there the flip side of it is if you wasn't if you was thinking there's no way for you to ever not be there [Applause] no way no way for you to ever not be [Applause] there but man one place he said that don't make you feel like shouting I know what will that's the truth that don't do something to you it gives you the Assurance it takes the fear of being lost away amen how do we identify ourselves by whether or not his life and we are matching this word is that right we find ourselves in here now brother berer you know there ought to be a scripture with such a powerful quote wouldn't don't you think you want one brother Sean want the scripture for it sister Patty let's get it Revelation is the scripture for this quote and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if your name ain't on that book you're going to worship the Beast oh brothers and sisters I can't tell you how much important it is how great a thing it is is if you have a desire for God if you have a desire to want to be one of his children that's the greatest thing that you could ever have whosoever will whoever wants to whoever has a desire to come come amen that's right show me your appetite and I'll identify you say you're a Christian me go to your garage with all kind of naked women pin up Pinups brother Bram says Ah your testimony ain't lining up you ought to have the cloud up there or the pillar of fire up there ain't that right some good gospel stuff amen you're identified by The Works you do people are identified by The Works that they do it's scary sometimes Lord help us I want my Works to match this right here the good part of it if you have oh so exciting that's why it takes the fear and doubt out that's why it crushes the devil when you realize that not only am mean now you realize who you are it gives you authority over the devil but you know where you come from you realize when Joshua spoke to the son I was there with him when they crossed the Red Sea I was there with him when Jesus died on Calvary I was there with him when he raised from the dead I was there with him when he ascended I am there with him W how do you know better because we had hasn't begun a good work in me Brother Brad we should have got mad long ago at people maybe each other quit huh quit she said quit but no no Brother Brad you me I'm GNA talk with by by Brother Brad sometime I appreciate how it's went with him so far amen when you put another minister in the mix with a congregation is a touchy thing is that right you don't know just how it'll go I'm gonna say it while I'm saying it but I appreciate Brother Brad amen when he knows there's a discontent or something like that he comes to me and talks to me don't think that you're going to go to Brother Brad and tell him little secrets and stuff you're not no because he's behind the pastor okay amen you got to and it's important I believe as a church to remember that amen I want him doing everything he possibly can but there's some things that need to be brought to the pastor going through the pastor ain't that right and I appreciate that amen and so I I really really appreciate amen his ministry and having him here amen and basically getting to know brother Brad ain't that right we're still getting to know each other how we are how we feel what we think do we think amen just an honor amen God bless you okay little cap yet a little bit and want me to cap it off let me cap it off that's right when David went to slinging I was there how many please that I can feel it that's right that's that giant one of you bring him down why and he's here with me saying take that lukewarm devil that the devil tries to put on you amen and slay that lukewarm devil that halfway devil that mediocre devil slay him be hot for God God Wants You hot in this hour he don't want you lukewarm hot on fire that's right he wants you praising him from the top of the mountain to the top of your voice he wants you to serve him with everything you got woo when you realize brother Glenn when God was all by himself there was nothing else but God there was no stars a moon no galaxies nothing eons of time before time ever began you and I and you were there with him if that don't do a little something to you knowing you were there if you're born again and you have eternal life you were there you were there when he spoke the first star out there hung the first star the Galaxy the first Galaxy out there somewhere you was right there with him hung the moon you was there created the sun you were there you're identified with him I love that quote if you wasn't in his thinking there there ain't no way that you'll ever be that's enough to scare the liver out of anybody that's not a Christian H because you realize you're not a part of God if you ain't part of his program and his thoughts man you are really doomed it thought to scar say God I hope if anybody would hear it out there and hear this said ask yourself if that voice in there in your heart says you know but I believe I'm one of his flee to the altar flee to God run as hard as you can I don't care who you got to run over so to speak but you get to God that's the greatest desire you could have is I want to be a Christian I want to serve God with all of my heart because that's God tugging him calling if you're elected how many beliefs if you're elected you'll come Thomas berer we don't stand and we aren't existing and continuing on simply because of our own power of our own ability know it was God that held us together brother Steve it was God that sustains us and I'm so happy that if I could shout louder than I ever have if I could scream louder than I ever have I want to say that when my savior calls I will answer when he calls for me I will hear when the Rapture happens I will be there when the roll is called up y I'll be there if I was there I'm going to be there W that's right if you're identified now with him then you was identified with him then and whatever comes I need a new body so that I can properly Praise Him amen isn't that glorious the thing you don't have to worry take a deep breath you'll be in the Rapture if you want to his amen let off the pressure amen missed that one let off the pressure how many know sometime you let off the pressure need to let it off the pressure just go read the book and say Lord this is what I need amen amen God bless you this morning amen I have delivered what I feel like the Lord's laid on my heart amen when the Savior calls I will answer when he calls for me I will hear I heard his voice said when he said come unto me come to me son let me give you the New Birth come and be baptized be buried with me come forth in newness like of life with me bear my spirit here bear my reproach bear my life be identified with me here and I'll be identified with you when I come with all the angels of heaven you'll be there by my side you'll be there by my side the whole world will see that the people of evening night Tabernacle that follow the prophet that they call false amen he'll be there he'll prove to the whole world who was and who wasn't amen you love him this morning God bless you God bless you amen we're going to stop right there oh go isn't God good daring a drug is good Tommy a't that right I don't care if it's meth I don't care what it is it ain't nothing as good as being free and clean and living for the Lord and to know who you are I literally badly feel bad for those folks who don't know what they are you know they're probably just trying to figure it out their teachers confused them told them they were a bunch of monkeys come from a bunch of Monk man you know it's just sad amen all right we we'll stop amen that's a little longer in anyway usual no hurry right Jesus was never in a hurry how many loves one another I how many believes we need to love one another let the bond of Love tie us together and bind us together amen stand with me let's bow our heads how many would say in their hearts that you want the weapons that God gave us in this hour you want the word that you have to have to combat the devil in this hour through the message of the hour say God help me give me wisdom give me knowledge give me understanding and how to use the word when I need to use it I've got the spirit but I need to be able to cut that devil's head off when he comes at me because in using the word of the Bible of course and then the revealed word of the hour that really brought it out plain Lord Jesus you see all of our hands God I ask for so much more wisdom than what I have Lord understanding and be able to make so that the devil amen doesn't know what to do with us so that truly we would become an invincible Unstoppable Army Lord and like Paul said having done all to stand help us to stand this this evil day against all that's out there trying to rob us of our happiness trying to rob us of our
