Ephesians 5 and we'll start with verse 15. see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the the days are evil wherefore being not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is amen may God add His blessings to be in the word you can be seated so what I want to speak on tonight is well the inspiration I had is it's kind of something that I struggle with a lot it's um being stuck on social media and just keep scrolling and not not focusing on something that's more important like even if it's like work or something like that and and I I believe that it's something that happens a lot in the world and it a lot of us Christians especially the younger ones that now the older people maybe not so much but but I've seen seen in this uh this picture of um and that we haven't changed much and it just shows a bunch of people read newspapers in in the um in a train everybody reading newspapers now now you see everybody looking at phones now I want to read this uh let's see this article that I read see it's called a drift in Godless media for decades most Christians have simply drifted into the Embrace of the patterns of the world in the way we spend our evenings and our weekends with the exception of a couple hours of church on Sunday at first this drift seems harmless because there was such an overlap between the supposedly Christian worldview and the products of the media and entertainment Empires now that that's why I was thinking about um it's it's so easily it's so easy to have access to anything sitting straight from your phone down um from let's see in my notes it says um well I was listening I heard this song Because be careful little eyes but you see be careful little ears while you hear I believe that that means a lot especially especially to the younger generation and that's what what has been going on in the world is the is that they're trying to bring up um they're trying trying to especially get hold of the younger generation because they're even more naive and more easily accept things yeah in this generation in a time that you can have any world view and make any search at your fingertips from a phone now this may say this sounds a little bit like my first sermon that I was preaching um foreign detached from the world's patterns of entertainment the overlap was not as great as we thought it was at least I I think I I really blew it but got hard sick or offended
