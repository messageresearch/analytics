dismissed to Sunday school we'll be turning to Proverbs three but before we do I'm just going to ask brother Glenn if you would open the service and word of Prayer [Music] tell us proverbs three and will and the adverse 14. my my son forget not my law and let thine heart keep my Commandments let not Mercy In Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil honor the Lord with thy substance and with the the first fruits of all thine increase my son despised not the chastening of the Lord neither be wary of his correction thank you happy is the man that findeth wisdom in the man that geteth understanding and this last one together for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver the game thereof and fine gold and you may be seated brother Brian brothers and sisters you know if you just read that Psalm every day and applied it to your life things would be I think I know in my own life be different if you would uh turn to uh Romans the 13th chapter you know the scriptures that were up there I think they were I'm not sure but that one quote brother Brian had they had up there of brother Branham I think I was just noticing the date it was uh 9 11 1965 well that was a long time ago and uh basically it's telling us that it's no different for us this morning you have to truly if you're truly predestinated and truly a son and daughter of God the word of God is the only thing that really matters in our lives that's the only thing that really matters nothing outside of that not to say that there aren't things important that you have to do as an individual in your life but outside the word of God everything else that doesn't seem important anymore whether you're young or old what feeble or sick or healthy it doesn't make a difference you have to project a word of God in everything that you do and every say and I was just thinking this morning I'll I'll just read this after I don't know if I have a lot to say this morning but I I take to heart the one thing that's in this age that we live in this morning you know the scripture they were reading there from Hebrews or the Hebrews also says that we have no continuing cities in this life but we look for one to come so we don't really not that we we don't enjoy the things we do in this life that we don't benefit from them but our desires and our hopes are I'm not on those things they're in the greater thing in Salvation and what we'll get on the other side but we don't do it to get something we do it because we love him and eat we care that he cares about us most of all um I'll just read this chapter here this morning but I I was I was reading in uh and Joshua I was at the later chapter you know where where God was telling Joshua you're getting old and feasible and they were as much land still to possess and um and that was where the children of Joshua went off I swear the children of Israel fell they didn't fully possess the land they didn't drive out all the amalekites and all all the amorites like they should have but I'll just read what this quote this quote is from this morning in the devotional and uh and then I'll read out of the 13th chapter of Romans and it's better set here than anything I could say let me just give you a little twister just for a minute and I'll say how many has the holy ghosts and of course everyone would raise their hand because they wouldn't want to be singled out all right I'll see you have the Bible said that they have the Holy Ghost Inside and cried day and night for the Abomination done in the city and this goes back to the chapter in Ezekiel 9. but I'm I'm really what I was thinking about was further down now how many hands would go up how many of you can't rest at night and he's talking about how many of you saw in the for the things that go on in the country and in the church in the world so the full joy and power of God so and so sad for people that are lost and that's just as true today as it was back in this day that I lost my place day and night You Weep and cry for the Abominations who would be in that City how many of that's in the church that's what the Bible said the Holy Spirit evidence was yeah basically you caring about your brother and sister the man next to you the woman next to you care about them you don't just put yourself first in everything you do you care about people and how many of that is the church and the Bible said holy spirit evidence was and he told the ceiling angels and that's Ezekiel 9 that's what I said go throughout the city instead of Mark upon those to sign cry for the Abominations did in the city and and rest and the rest of them let the destroying Angels destroy them no matter how much members they was and how many things they've done so he's saying it's it's not on how much money you've spent how much your church membership none of that counts is in your heart what do you care about what are the things you put first and a man with an ink horn I lost my you have to how much members was how many of those things done in men with an acorn dressed in white which represents the Holy Spirit came forth and put a mark upon it all all them that saw it and cried for the Abominations done in the city I watched he said there's also slay orderly little children old women babies kill them all little children yes and then this is what I was thinking about this morning about sometimes in our lives we don't destroy those things that are in our lives or in our family and before you know it they keep creeping up again and again the same old issues that we have in our life to keep creeping up creeping up in our lives and if you don't kill that Spirit to kill that devil who'll be fighting you until the day you die right this is what brother Brandon had to say here so when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't let one of them live if it's a cute little baby a little amalekite or a little Amorite killer you remember he grow up to be in a malachite and heal pollute your can so that little double you're playing with in your life the one that you don't kill one of these days is going to grow up and it's going to consume you he'll pollute the camp and those little things come back like the disagreeing with the word of God get rid of that thing I don't care what the nomination it belongs to you know you could take that in our day and age whatever it belongs to if it's contrary to the word of God you need to cast it off you say Well they're good I don't care how good people they are if they're contrary to the word that goes what that scripture was saying that brother Branham was talking about that predestinated seed oh we always puts the word first in everything it does get the thing out of you it's a growing little amalekite looks cute looks innocent looks like it's all right but you don't have anything to do with it you stay away from it well brother random I'll go down there because well I don't you just remember any amalekite anything that denies the word stay away from it and that's the world we're living it's a word denying world that we live in they don't believe the word of God they laugh at you when you talk about the word of God doesn't mean that you don't have to be around them you just don't have to receive what they're giving it denies words stay away from it have nothing to do with it at all how many beliefs that's the truth sure is see stay away from it who sang cry for the Abominations that did in the city where do you see that I can show you ten thousand speaking in tongues to one that's really burden for sin I gotta raise my hand sometimes I'm not like this in my own life I I cannot I can speak for myself here they can't even pray an hour you know and I notice the age of the spirit that we live in it it tries to get you to do everything else other than pray and read your Bible That's the age we're in right now and he goes truth uh lost my place who cry for an oblation that did in the city where you see that I can show you ten thousand and speak in tongues to one that really burdened for sin they can't even pray an hour but do you know the Bible said to Mark only those who sign and cry for the Abominations in the city how many have already sure that's what the Holy Spirit come forth to Mark people and said to this destroying Angel go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have the mark upon it the mark of God is the Holy Ghost and the Seal of God and I sure hope my desire this morning is to have that Mark on me but I'll just read a few of these scriptures this morning you know I was also looking at that scripture you know uh I was just I'm I'll stop there I was gonna say something but I'll just read what God's word has to say like I said what my opinion about anything doesn't mean anything it's what the prophet of the age says and what the God's word says that's the only thing that really you can have I could have an idea but that doesn't mean anything what what the word of God says that's the only idea we need to hold to and that's what a Believer will hold too is the word of God above all things whether your father will do it whether your mother will do it whether your wife will do whoever it is people you work with you'll hold to it no matter what pressure comes against you and I'll just read here and this 13th chapter let every soul be subject to the higher powers for there's no power but of God the powers that are ordained of God and you can take that scripture and run through the Bible and you'll know what it's talking about there I don't have time whoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of God they that resist them shall receive to themselves damnation for the rulers are not a charred to Good Works so if you've got the Holy Ghost and you're serving God when you know sometimes corrects when correction comes I got to raise my hand it's not always the easy thing to receive but it's good for your soul just like in that problem where we you know correct you it'll keep you straight on the way and it goes on for rulers are not Authority good works but the evil without them be afraid of the power to do that which is good then thou shall have Praise of the same for he's the minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he's a minister of God a Revengers to execute wrath upon them that that doeth evil and this is more for us now in our day and age this is really spiritual this morning wherefore you must need be subject not only for wrath but for also conscience sake for this cause pay ye tribute also for for their God's ministers attending continually upon the very things and I was I was just thinking this morning you know that's the thing about men you know everyone wants a opinion everyone wants to be able to tell everyone else what to do and where to be or whatever but actually the only thing that matters is what God is leading the church the Jew through the word of God that's my ideas I don't mean I know I've said this a lot this morning but my ideas my opinions they don't they don't mean anything the only thing that matters is what the prophet of the age that in the word of God says for us to do and I'll just finish reading rendered therefore to their views tribute to whom tribute is due accustomed to who custom Fear To whom fear honor to whomano oh no man anything but love one another for he that loveth another have fulfilled the law and that's what this age needs it there ain't very much love out there in the world I mean there's phony love I mean if you rub people just right they'll treat you right but soon as you say something they don't like then they're just like the cat for this Thou shalt not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shall not bear false living thy neighbor as thyself and love worketh no will to his neighbors therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and I know I need more of that in my life sometimes and and that knowing that the time that is now High time to awake out of sleep and that's really true for now is our Salvation there than we believe you know and by that quote come from 1965 we're in 2023 how much closer are we are I know people have said that for years we're closer today than we were tomorrow and then as you live your life you're 40 years further down the road but it doesn't change the truth of that fact that we're closer today than we were yesterday and you don't want to be slothful and he goes on to say the night is far spent day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in clamoring not wanting us not in strife and envying and that's that last sentence it's right there pastor.com and that's the age we're in it's trying to make you be at Strife make you envy it's that's its sole purpose to get you off the word of God and and this last verse here the 14th verse but put ye on Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ make no brush and fulfill the Lost thereof and then it goes further down but I would just say this morning that for myself like I said I can only speak for myself I'd want this pure in his word this morning he doesn't want any doubt in us we don't want any doubt or anything in our hearts and lives and the only way I've ever found to keep all that out is to stay with the word of God this morning brother not to say brother Dave but Brother John stand this morning and good to see everybody this morning got quite a number of people out I think at the Manchester meetings this morning but it's good to see everybody good to have our visitors Peter and Rudy

another part of our series on Higher Ground amen going higher in Christ how many wants to go higher in Christ go deeper amen than what we have keep pressing on not looking behind but looking into the future amen and so amen we're blessed people amen we blessed people we're privileged people amen and one day the world won't be so privileged anymore amen but while we are privileged we want to take full advantage of what God has given us so we greet you in the name of the Lord amen we'll bow our heads and just get right into the word of God lord Jesus we come before you Lord Jesus and we're so so grateful God that we know that we can have a Clear Channel between us and you Lord to speak to you to ask things Lord to tell you how much we love you and appreciate you and we know that you hear us Lord Jesus and you're right there because you're in our hearts Lord listening father thank you Father that you have said to the disciples if I don't go away the comforter can't come it was more necessary for you to go than for you to stay Lord because we were going to have a deeper relationship with you we're going to have a deeper walk than what even the disciples did when they walked with you in the natural realm Lord and we ask God that you'll just speak to us now be the speaker this morning speak to our hearts the words of eternal life Lord Jesus that we might be a better people to serve you Lord Jesus you know the needs of each one we know you're a God that these are in the thoughts and intents of the heart you already know what each one thinks what we have neither father and

Lord amen if you will open your Bibles and we'll go to the Book of Proverbs enjoy going down to Manchester Friday evening enjoy taking in that one service down there amen and so we got to see brother Andrew Glover and Amen brother Dwayne Lawson and chat with them a little bit brother uh Andrew Glover was supposed to be with us here this coming uh first Sunday of the month but amen he had something that he wanted to kind of do and I said well we can make adjustments for that and man his uh Child's first birthday amen and so the third weekend in August everybody might want to write this down hopefully everybody can be here I mean if you haven't got any plans brother Andrew Glover will be with us on a Saturday night the third weekend in August amen Saturday night and Sunday morning I mean we'll have two Services because he's coming A Long Way amen I don't think we'll have any food or anything like that we'll just have a service Saturday night and then again Sunday morning Saturday night at six o'clock amen so we're looking forward to having brother Andrew here we haven't had him for a while amen all right Proverbs one amen you know before I start you know we love to preach to the bride of Christ we love to preach to believers but sometimes we also preach to the unbelievers amen and so this here kind of is centered towards preaching to a non-believer not orders in probably verse 1 and verse 23 3 it says turn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make known my words unto you because I called and you refused I stretched I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but you have said it not all my counsel and with none of my reproof I also will laugh at your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh and when you fear cometh that's desolation I mean yeah desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for they that hate for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would none of my counsel to despise all my reproof therefore shall they eat of their fruit of their own way and to be filled with their own devices may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen I felt like there was just a real simple thought that the Lord laid on my heart I mean kind of quickened it to me this week Eminem as I was working as I was doing different things and and it came to me amen about the Power of Choice the power of choice amen praise the Lord amen and so it is of course something that we've heard a lot before but if you'll notice here that it says that they did not choose the fear of the Lord and I think in this scripture we find that there was a uh a lot of it he's talking about that they wouldn't isn't that right I called but he refused I stretched out my hand and none regarded it amen there's a lot of things actually that when we talk about choice of course when we know talk about toys we know that we're talking about something that God planned a day upon and that's free moral agency free moral agency the ability to choose and then you know I was just thinking about I was thinking about that you know because think about it if you if if you could only go One Direction in no other direction you would have no choice that right but choice choice is the ability to go in a different direction amen it's the ability to go into a different direction it's like the steering wheel on a car amen choice and now I want you to know we want to talk about it or not on on a small scale where there's just two choices then we want to also talk about how that we have multiple choices amen and and it's just like having a steer the choice is like a steering wheel whichever way you choose that's the way it goes whether you end up in a ditch or whether you stay on the road or whether you get over any other one's lane or whether you kind of keep a straight line it's totally by what you choose is the direction that you're gonna go amen it gives you your direction Choice does amen now this is a step down from predestination for the nation it is a step down from the revelation of uh uh the seed being in you and so forth because I want to try to bring in uh a few different thoughts amen with the help of the lord we want to just really dwell on choice because I want you to know that every day we don't realize that every day you make thousands of choices you make thousands of choices every day amen right from the time you get up and on but I want to first talk about I want to first talk about perhaps and I wanted to call this good choices and bad choices amen amen and we know through the prophet of God that that in heaven the first place that if we ever found free moral agency or that we found the ability to choose was in heaven in heaven was the first place that they had the ability to choose amen and I'm just going to throw something out there kind of a a presumption if that's okay if the question I should I put it this way it begs the question that when we get over there will we still be on free moral agency will there still be free moral agency question just a question I I don't know but I do know the first place they did have a choice was in heaven and the first bad real bad choice that was made was made in heaven now notice in Isaiah 14 and verse 12 it says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how about that cut down to the ground which did streak in the Nations for thou has said in thy heart now how may know Satan one time was God's right-hand man so to speak he was right there with God himself and it's hard to imagine but this guy here this is what he said in his heart I said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God do you see the stars the god Revelations of first three chapter God has seven stars and he's right in that he used for the last seven or two thousand years Martin Luther John Wesley Paul irenius and so forth and Samara he was going to exalt his throne above God's Messengers or God's Stars above the stars of God anything they teach you whatever is going to be on the word of God and he wants to get people to do something different than What God Says isn't that right so the devil and I also beg the question sometimes I wonder sometimes if the devil regrets his decision there's one thing we do know that he is a miserable creature he is miserable and misery loves company that's why he tries to get this many to go with him as he possibly can because misery loves company and I want you to know he can just stay in his little corner I have no interest in being miserable with the devil and these poor choices very bad vision can we say something else not only did he make it a bad choice but a third of the Angels me the bad choice the first place that there was gossip in the church was in heaven he whispered his little secrets and his lies and and his this that's the first place there was a discontent was in heaven he wasn't contented he wanted he wanted to be like God second Thessalonians he wanted to be like God he will represent himself as God isn't that right because he wanted to be a god amen and he took two-thirds he preached this gospel his discontent his gossip let me tell you something that's why you got to be careful who you listen to how many how that's why God hates discontent what does this content the first place that there was murmuring was in heaven well we don't like the way things are here better watch that word don't like the way things are here the devil didn't like the way things were there two-thirds of the Angels didn't like how things were and they took sides with the Devil isn't that right to think that that was that many don't you want to shake the Angel's hands when you get over to heaven the ones that did make the right choice the ones that said nah you just take your gossiping self and get away from me you just take your bright ideas and get away from me I'm happy where I'm at that one right there that's gone that way like that's God you're not God two-thirds of them stayed with God why do you think God puts you on me on female agency you don't like to just drive you to stuff and push you to stop even though sometimes he does but he wants you to make a choice based on what you want to do [Applause] God loves good choices I hate bad choices amen we've all made them too many amen so I got on here trying to express it in one of these days I'll get together on this be able to put this up on the board again but this is uh I put a why like a y it didn't sound like this why here all right it represents right here I got in the middle a crossroad all right and for two thousand four thousand years for four thousand years this straight line man didn't really have a choice foreign [Music] when it came to uh not uh to be free from sin is that right whether it was David whether it's Solomon they had that first nature and they couldn't get away from it in other words that they didn't have a different way they could go all they had was a substitute of killing goats and sheep and so forth that God would cover their sin and forgive them but their nature would never be changed no matter how much they wanted to be spiritual David or whatever you still end up messing up with special Sheba why do you think that if somebody that claims to be a Christian it isn't really born again you're still gonna mess up but it's like this wine for 4 000 years I want to say there's a lot of things that we don't have a choice in amen like our birth being born you really didn't have a choice did you I mean those kids nowadays are suing their parents because they didn't ask to be here now I gotta have a job now I gotta get up in the morning now I got a pay rent you put all this struggle on me huh don't work that way does it no he didn't have a choice in that matter but one thing's for sure you have to make some decisions now as a human being you're forced to make a decision you got to make a decision when the supernatural is done when the gospels preached to you folks you'll be making decisions right here this morning as you hear the word you're gonna have to decide whether you believe it or whether you don't I'm here to tell you there's absolutely uh it is unlimited to what you could do if you would just accepting believe it and choose to believe if you can choose to believe the Bible says we thought we've got nothing shall be impossible all things are possible to them that believe you see that was after the crossroad you couldn't say that before but now that we've reached the why we've reached the crossroad because that's what all decisions are they are at a Crossroads a decision is because you got to go this way or you got to go that way you gotta act like this or you gotta act like that you gotta think like this or you gotta think like that every thought that comes in your mind you have to decide whether you want to think that's odds or whether you want to cast that thought out when the cross came we came to a Crossroads things were gonna be different now you have a choice but whether you want to be a sinner or not now you have a choice of whether you want to be guilty or whether you want to be natural and carnal and amen hateful and mean and everything else you got a choice now man that's one of the greatest things that we can have this choice because if I didn't have a choice you'd have to go in whatever Direction you're going but you got the choice any look I'm telling you young people it'll make your whole world your whole world is going to be created by the choices that you make you're sitting here this morning because you made a chore but said I'm going to go to church this morning you're sitting because you decided hey this is where I want to miss it we make choices all the time now who knows how hard you had to fight whether you was going to go to church or not huh isn't that right we're filled with choices but praise be to God now notice how many knows in the Old Testament without the cross of Calvary we all kept going on the same road that we were on when we really didn't have a choice and that straight road that Broad Road keeps going right straight if you keep going straight that way and you don't bear off of that road you're gonna end up I rode up in here this road leads to hell it leads to destruction it leads to Everlasting punishment in the separation from the presence of almighty God it going straight I mean you got to make a change oh oh when I thought about the car hey you know what I can sit here and I could have a bad attitude I can be depressed or I can decide I'm not gonna be thank God that you have the ability to say I'm not gonna be my praise be to God let's talk more about bad choices people that made bad choices and they're people that make good choices people that made bad choices and that could actually be redeemed from those bad choices people who make bad choices and never was redeemed for making those choices I'll just say this right off the go get real quick like as long as you're in this world you have a choice but that when you take that last breath all that choice stuff's over there's no more Choice over on the other side you are what you are amen on this side and on that side you'll already judged on what you did with what God gave you amen see we want to talk a little more about the cross but see Jesus when he said he says whosoever will let him come who knows that at the Garden in the Garden of Eden they were turned out and says don't you come back get out of the garden don't you take up the tree of life and live forever they were refused they couldn't come take up that tree but when Jesus come along he says whosoever will let him come honey believe that that same spirit is still calling the people calm all you who are weary and heavy ladies that you want to come aren't you bad that you can make that choice to come that oh my just a simple preacher Italian in the Bible can determine where you'll spend eternity just a simple choice amen notice how he puts it on us God puts it on Humanity don't he because we know when he said it was finished at Calvary it was all done he had done his part now it's your turn now it's my turn did not choose to fear of the Lord well let me tell you something I mean those there are people who do Choose You know what I like about choosing Christ because I chose Christ that's what I remember I want to choose you God I choose you dumb take my heart take my life amen I realize that I chose him because he chose me before I chose him he had chosen me because he knew what I would do he knew what everybody would do that's how he could write people's name on the book before the foundation of the world because you knew what everybody would do he knew what they would do what their choice would be oh my aren't you glad that should cause us to almost have us a run thing fit to think that you're you want what God wants you want everything yes for you you choose him it shows you that he chose you because even Jesus says you've not chosen me I've chosen you praise be to God oh my God no that was the first place was in heaven murmuring complaining discontent division first in heaven that stress of division was first in heaven because Satan chose the wrong path the angel chose the wrong path they chose the wrong thing listen to the wrong thing amen the next time that we hear of this what's an Eden right Eve made a bad choice she really did and plunged us into heaven getting old having to get sick having to have funerals all the hospitals every ambulance every dead animal on the road everything was caused because Eve made a bad choice what is it that church Eve chose to do Eve chose to open up her mind she had to make a choice I've concluded that before you can get mad before you can have a temper before you can uh fuss before any adult thinks you have to choose that that's what you're going to do you come right up to it and say well I'm about to lose it and then you can either let go or you can say no that ain't gonna happen here first it has to happen in the minds and he had to open up the womb of her mind too well maybe he's right she should have never thought that she should have cut that thought out slapped him in the face good and large and said get away from me serpenters you're the most subtle Beast to the field you're a beast of the field you ain't no snake good looking no doubt handsome and all of that she said get away from me you're lying trying to give me this food off of the tree of knowledge of good and even telling me that I'm going to be like God's knowing good and evil God told me to stay away from you not even to touch you huh but you made a bad choice and where did it bring it into death isn't that right my bad choice that it was given amen and for four thousand years we've had to deal with that but thanks be to God amen that God chose to come and to redeem us and to pay the price at Calvary for our sins amen so that you wouldn't have to be under the bondage of guilt uh aren't you glad that you don't have to feel guilty anymore you can know that your heart is right and all sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ my my my praise be to God no coming back for the devil and his angels is there not even a hope no hope for him all those uh that he went that Jesus went to preaching the souls in prison amen he went down in the regions of the Lost in the days of Noah and all of them there was no hope he told him I am the one that he said that was to come and you didn't believe it believe us but I'm here but there's no hope for him I think that's what's going to make hell hell that's what's going to be so bad for her to regions of the laws is there is no hope amen no chance not even a chance of you getting out of it [Music] I mean those choices are privilege why do you think everybody wants to come to America you can choose what you want to do work and there's so much privilege here amen praise the Lord let's talk about David let's talk about a little bit uh actually let's talk about redeemable bad choices redeemable bad choices and I believe God's children we as God's children sometimes bad choices choose the wrong thing go the wrong path answer was an example of a man who could say a thousand Philistines and have all of the all of Israel platform oh that's our Samson our deliverer isn't that right and he was pretty smart for a good long while he would never tell Delilah the true Secret I mean those as long as he didn't tell her really what it was he could get up and tear those chains and whatever it is and keep on slaying them they couldn't do anything as long as they didn't do that but one day he opened up his mind because Delilah said it just that way well you don't love me honey you don't love me if you really love me huh is that slicker and God did you do you open his mouth okay all right amen and he made a big mistake he chose to tell her and he told her and guess what he ended up being in the pit of despair in the grinding wheel his eyes gouged out serving his Enemy being made fun of and he was at that grinding wheel of grinding and he was backsliding he was away from God and oh my the consequences of his mistake was unparable isn't that right but there was Redemption for him because his hair grew back he could feel the locks and he said just once more Lord let me feel it again just once more and he killed more on that day the big shots and the big up and ups and the whole clan hey man he got a hold of those pillars somebody showed me the video that's something I want to see them big old face crack almighty God come back on him how many batteries you as a child of God you might get away from God you might not you might make a bad decision but God is the only one that can get you out of it I'm thankful for that aren't you but he paid dearly I want you to understand something every time you make a bad decision you pay for it dearly maybe if I have time I want to talk to you about that we ought to do like Moses said he chose by faith of Moses amen chose not to be called Pharaoh's son choosing rather to accept the afflictions of Israel than to enjoy the pleasures of sin first season he chose by faith Faith be to God now just say this if I don't when you make a choice by faith it's always good by faith that's why you got to get down on your knees and say Lord what do you want me to do here what do you want not what I want every time let me kind of say something every time you make up she's decision on your carnality and flesh it's always a bad choice folks you don't never want to be led by your flesh you will lose every time amen David it was another one man after he saw Bathsheba and he opened up his mind hey you know what I'd like to have this girl I want this girl right there he made his mistake when he allowed that thought to come in he didn't have the power to turn his head and say it huh somebody go down there into the house down below my kingdom and tell Bathsheba not to bathe in the public not the base where I can see her all right make sure you have curtains as you're in private and in secret amen corrected or that would have been good the story would have been a lot different for David Absalom wouldn't have got killed oh he wouldn't have been running for his life and that oh my all kinds of chaotic mess that came because she disobeyed because he made the wrong choice amen his firstborn of of Bathsheba died amen no matter how much he cried and wept you have to wonder how much he really meant it because the second that he heard that he was dead he got up and cleaned himself up and he was done crying they asked him well why are you stopping crying now he says well while he was still living there was hope now it's dead now there's no hope well anyway but God had told him it would die isn't that right God don't change his mind how many of those choices are very powerful we talk about the power the spirit the power to all kinds of power but let me tell you something choice is one of the most powerful things there is in the universe amen it will determine your Eternal destination sure God chose you but you still have to make that choice of whether you're going to believe what he did on Kev on for you on Calvary you still have to believe whether you believe the truth or not you have to make a choice it's all a choice amen praise the Lord the Rich Young Ruler he made a bad choice didn't he amen he chose not to sell all that he had but ma'am said later in life you find hey man he found his soul down in Hell amen he called Abraham common hurt me let somebody bring a touch of water like that song says now a strip drop of water is all he'll ever need amen bad choice Choice stop forever in that place cause he made it bad choice the Pharisees I mean the Pharisees didn't mean about that the Jews they were forced to make a decision God has made himself folks that all of humanity is forced to make a decision you've got to decide what you're going to do with the word of God you must you must decide where you're going to spend eternity and let me let me tell you something on the small scale there's really when it comes to your destination there's only two choices only two places not a bunch that's not purgatory and this that or the other over here to the left you gotta Veer off another path that leads to destruction the one they had been going on for a long time and you got to get over here on Heaven's Highway amen you better get off that road amen only two Jesus said no man can serve two masters two masters either God or the devil that you'll serve one of them no glory aren't you glad this morning that you're not serving the devil that you're serving God God and you know you're serving God you want to do without which pleases the father amen you ought to be happy we ought to be happy Hallelujah all right let's talk about other other choices that are made sometimes we have to make choices when we're in the middle of things that we did not choose there's things that God allows to come on you that you have no power you know no power over it like job joke didn't bring that upon himself because he made a bad choice God allowed it to come upon job isn't that right he allowed it to come upon Joe but he got all the way down to where he was just all of the most miserable creature lost all of his finances and everything else and now he lost his health and he was so miserable until any one of them would have said man he would be better off dead like we say sometimes of our loved ones well there at least their suffering is over and his own wife come to him and says man why don't you just Curse God and die because that was the challenge that the devil had made to God first place he says you know you know he'll curse you to your face he'll curse you if you do this or that or the other he says no he won't go ahead and do what you want he come right down into that hard place that really hard he wipes it and job had to make a decision huh is she right do I listen to her what do I do I want to make a statement that is God forces these these things Upon Us makes us make a decision he said the prophet of God said is to show what's inside of you to show what's down in there I want to talk about what's down in there in a little bit but what's really down in there job said don't have to think about that too long you speak like a foolish man woman feel his man foolish woman the Lord the Lord taken away blessed be the damn it loud he worshiped him he made a choice to do it folks I'm here to tell you whether you're happy or whether you're sad it's all up to you whether you're saved or whether you're lost it's all up to you it's your choice what do you want you're on a free moral agency and God loves free more agency brother Brandon if you all remember he come down God took his wife took his child he wasn't understanding he come right down to it he said so you know if God's going to be like that the devil was trying to tell him God don't love you and if he's going to be like that and then thoughts were coming and they had to make a choice and no I rebuke that thoughts and I believe that God has given God takes away blessed be the name of the Lord I'm glad that us as Christians amen we love God so much that we can say even though he kills me I'll still love him though he slay me yet I'll trust him yeah that's right folks he's that good God is that good that even though he kills you you love him anyway 68 million Christians down through the Dark Ages because of Catholicism gave their lives they were burnt they were fed to Lions God allowed it amen they didn't mind dying for him even Jesus said Don't Fear the man that can kill your body but fear him that can destroy both body and soul in hell aren't you glad you chose the fear of the Lord you have to choose the fear of the Lord we humans I'll tell you what we make a lot of choices based on on uh survival circumstances come and we'll make this choice that choice in order to survive keep going man but God doesn't always want us to be it that way he wants you to make a choice like the Rich Young Ruler was he had everything he needed he wasn't hurting for nothing he just wanted eternal life and Jesus gave him the option just do this here and you'll have it and I guarantee you he is he's regretting it we know how he feels about it isn't that right we don't know whether the devil's regretting or not but we know that rich young ruler in Hell lifted up his eyes and he says can't get to somebody go tell my brothers this man got concerned in those realms he got concerned that he's about he's got to come there I always thought that's a perfect story for all of humanity look at what the Bible said and he's and Abraham says no they have the law all the prophets he says because they I believe it was him that Abraham said you know even though one would raise from the dead they still wouldn't believe because if they don't if you don't believe the Bible if you don't believe this story you just don't believe amen I don't know about you but I take that story to Heart I don't want to wait till I get down to the regions of losses hey maybe I should have done that this is your chance you still got plenty of money everything's still going good it won't be long and they'll put the squeeze on you on that money you won't buy or sell unless you belong to that left and all that wicked stuff hello but I want to make my choice this morning now Lord I want to serve you with all my heart you don't have to bring me to desperation you don't have to put me on the hospital before I begin to say God Amen bring me to a closer walk with you oh let me tell you something man you have to choose to take culture to God if you want to be closer to God but the Bible says he said draw an eye to God and God would all neither you Hallelujah you want more of God you gotta choose that we want more of God that's what he said Jesus God is waiting on you and I to do something he did his he's provided us with everything that we have need of how many believe that provided us with everything that we have need of David One More Story before I go on but David when he was in the in the in the tent of despair when when the enemy had come and got their children and their wives and so forth when David came back with all of his men his whole family and everything the enemy had taken away you remember that and his men sought to kill him his men sought to kill him damn it stare in the pit of despair no David said he strengthened himself in the Lord when you're down at the bottom of the bottom you gotta choose hey where do I go from here amen there's only one way to go and let's back up you gotta choose God loves those choices three Hebrew children we don't know whether God's Gonna Deliver us not but this one thing and we know we're gonna take a stand we're not bound I love it so much he loves he loved let an angel come down and flood that place with water there was no typhoon can you met just typhoon or the water that's seven times hotter he could have brought a rain cloud over top and dumped him up enough water to douse the whole thing wouldn't it have been nice Vindication to the three Hebrew children if something like that would have happened oh yeah there must be of God no them unbelievers wouldn't have believed it they said hey that's just a freak thief of nature get me another furnace build unbelievers just have a hard time to leave a note please but let me tell you the good part Believers have an easy time believing for a Believer believing's not so hard worship isn't all that are praising God ain't all that hard no because what it's on the inside here Glory you're blessed how many of those we are privileged we are a privileged people to be able to choose whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them to this island first choose it first I've got this way I thought that man when I was out there on the farm and I thought boy what a wonderful thing you can choose whether you want the joy of the Lord whether you're going to be depressed or whatever you're going to be whatever state you're going to be in you choose we gotta choose whether we're going to worship Lord You're Going To Worship it doesn't matter when you get up in the morning you gotta choose whether you're gonna pray you can have to decide whether you're going to listen to a preacher that day or read your Bible laughs you got to decide whether you want to be different next week than what you was that last week aren't you gonna take your privileged person to be able to change course choice is to change courses oh let me get this out of you this morning real good if you don't like the direction that you're going you don't have to it used to be you'd have to you could make hard you couldn't change yourself for nothing David couldn't change himself none of them could change themselves not until the Holy Ghost came on the day of Pentecost and the day of Pentecost the holy ghost man then the man's hard sword change and the desires were changed Peter took his life and cut off his ears said man I'm gonna stick for my Lord I'm gonna stand for my Lord but it is all of his natural causes abilities still ended up denying him three times foreign something more than his natural ability but on the day of Pentecost he come up out of there and said where is that devil at I'll give my life isn't that right praise be to God bad choices good choices best choice what's the best choice you'll ever make serving God giving your heart unreservedly to God best choice you'll ever make is to take up your cross and follow me sure he told Peter John fisherman hey put your nuts up come on

homosexuals and the lesbians and all of them about guys out there when the fire falls like it did in Sodom and gomor they'll realize hey it's what I heard yeah that was the truth if God if God don't punish this touch this generation for their sodomy he'll have to raise Autumn up and apologize but it'll be too late they'll make a choice they will choose but it won't do them any good they will keep going Direction they are because God ain't gonna be here amen says they'll call but I won't answer now this morning and peace just having a regular church service this is time to say raise I want to serve God how many wants to serve God I want to love him I want to worship him I want him to take complete control of my life Lord have you awake Lord have your way in me amen that's right praise be to God amen when you're at your lowest Deb T choose God the three leopards remember one time in Israel they were starving to death there was no food and they were bought to die and they said if we stay here we die and if we go into the enemy's camp we might die also but one thing for sure if we stay here we're gonna die don't take a genius to figure you need to do something different they were the first ones to come into the account and they put everything on their meals and backs taken care of folks they got the biggest golden pot whatever you might be able to find and then they went back to Angela hey you guys did all that over there go don't you just love God that's the way Jesus is he killed he overcome every enemy every devil of hell he says you're all dead go ahead and be free now you don't have to be bound by this and you don't have to be bound by that that's what Jesus did on Calvary let's talk a few minutes what's on the inside do you realize that every promise in the book is yours every verse every chapter every line that we have adapt resources whatsoever you will ask in my name is that will I do that's your untapped resources but you got to choose folks I'm here to tell you when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you get down the inside of you you have everything in you right then that you will ever need in this world or in death or in the world to come all you gotta do is choose to say God I want more of it Paul nothing out of you [Music] I don't know what it does to me but that's what it does to me I don't know what it does to you but that's what it does to me I'll get it straight sometime you have the Lord and he says you don't have to wait for the preacher to come up here and preach you don't have to wait some famous main brand evangelists to combine lay his hands on you and you've already ready all you gotta do is open up the womb of your mind and say I chose it I accept it that's right I'm not talking about five seconds from now I'm talking about five seconds ago you should have done it receive it right when it comes and I accept it Lord I receive it I choose your joy I choose your peace I choose your forgiveness your grace I choose your power [Music] right now not tomorrow the next thing right now [Music] [Applause] Higher Ground part five amen how many please we need to go over Higher Ground if you're ever going to get up in the highest because you're going to choose to if you don't get the Revelation this morning I hope this week God will reveal to you we've Quicken that to you that whatever it is that you don't like in your life that's contrary to work all you got to do is change your privilege to be able to say Jesus you're real you bought it you paid for it and all I have to do is accept it remember I can't do anything unto you or for you until you first accept that what he's done that he's done it for you already I was looking at this pulling up some quotes on it he says you know if you need healing whatever it is that you need just begin to confess it believe it with all of your heart he says I mark my words after 30 years of preaching he said if you'll receive it into your heart if you'll accept but he has already done and then leave it there and go and act as though it's already done he said act like it's already done God's going to come on the scene God honors faith [Music] praise be to God what did he say oh my they shall seek me early but they shall not find me right they'll knock and they're not gonna have it open that's what he come alive crossword he says shall find not and it shall be opened unto you ask and you shall receive I like that don't you all you gotta do is accept and receive it in the mind say I choose I am accepting it now choosing is to accept choosing to believe amen what he said is the truth praise be to God Paul he says you know I know how it is to suffer need and I know how it is to abound this one thing have I learned he says I know how to abound and I know how to suffer need but in him I can do all things through Christ with which strengthens me Paul was one of those people he believed that all things are possible I can go through anything you can go through anything if he's there doesn't matter what comes to go sometimes you can't control amen you're not you're not in control of your situation as far the things that God allows to come your way the trials that come your way you you have no power over it sometimes the only Power the only strength you have is the kind of attitude that you kind of have in the midst of them that is something that you can choose how many believe that what kind of attitude what kind of thought pattern because it forms us how many knows our choosing forms us the things that you allow to go into your mind we've heard the story that you can't keep the birds from flying over your head you can't keep you can't control the thoughts of entering into your mind amen yesterday at the gas station up in Elkton I pump my gas and somebody comes driving up there comes the woman out of the car right up there in front of me nothing but her underwear underwear it wasn't no big old fat lady either that you know wouldn't bother you but it was something blonde with a good figure in that everything and then some kind of a shawl that has nothing but holes everywhere and I'm like the world coming to they're so bold so bold to come out there in a hunter top or whatever and just nothing but her underwear like I'm like Lord of Mercy I thought later well maybe she didn't just intentionally go up like that maybe she came from that swimming pool or something over there but at any rate it's just terrible isn't it the devil's getting real bold isn't he I mean I was going around the square by the joke hey man here comes some weird looking woman and some other woman side by side and I knew what that was all about you could tell about the way that they were right there in our little city of Elkins folks I've always rejoiced because of our little city up there but well I call it my city yet because I lived there small but it's coming right down around us folks let me knows that but how many knowledge before shoot you have you first got to accept it first you gotta take that thought personally one of the last things I want to mention to you is that your whole atmosphere is going to be created because of the things that you allow your mind to think the Bible says you're here to bring every thought captive to the word of God the thought that comes in here amen you have to choose whether you want to dwell on it or you have to choose whether your cat's it out or not it has to be a choice amen you have to choose whether you're going to love or you're going to have to choose whether you're going to look the other way it's a choice the wrong thought of any kind comes into your mind you got to choose hey do I want to think this a lot of times we'll think well I don't really believe that I can or don't you ever think that you can by the grace of God you can do all things God has given us every spiritual blessing that we might dwell in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen you love the Lord amen everyday choices in closing it's all about opening this door choices are about opening this door choices open doors and they close doors when it comes to devil his thoughts I don't want to close the door I want to slam it shut don't you want to just slam it shut thee behind me Satan can a man do that well according to the script resist the devil and he'll flee from you how many believe that [Applause] [Music] resist the devil and he'll flee from me yeah I survive your joy he comes to rob you off your peace he comes to rob you off that Pleasant Holiness that's on the inside but just tell him to get on out of here devil I got no room for you and we're living in the hour folks that you have to guard every minute of every hour of every day you got to be on guard hey man you might never get on your phone and look at anything better on your iPad looking anything bad all you gotta do is go uptown and it's bad comes right in front of you you go to stores or wherever it is it's just everywhere so you better be protected by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will protect you amen praise be to God Lord help us aren't you glad to be privileged to be able to make a decision to decide and to decide by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost makes such great choices I mean he makes such great choices Peter and them no they had a terrible no Paul he had a terrible and guess what when he get over on the other side he says I I suppose that the spread the sufferings of this present time are not to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed all those who suffer for Christ gave their lives for Christ deem not their lives precious but give it to him give it to the Lord Jesus Christ to have reserved to themselves an ending unending life it's hard to Fathom sometimes that you when you have eternal life you are as Immortal as God is immortal you're as Eternal as God is eternal then Jesus comes and you might have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life that's God's own life people don't understand the godhead and how God can be up here and Jesus here and the dove come down into Christ if that's so how to understand how about trying to understand that God can replicate himself into many many many many many many many bodies bodies and then what he did on the day of Pentecostal the Bible says the Holy Spirit come down and it divided itself the Holy Ghost divided himself and 3 000 perhaps a thousand now all over the world God can divide himself off to however he wants to give us all a portion of
