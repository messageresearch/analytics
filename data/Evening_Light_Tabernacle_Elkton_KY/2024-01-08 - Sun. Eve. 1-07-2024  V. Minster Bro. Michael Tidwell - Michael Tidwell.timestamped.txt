[6:57] tonight just so good to be in the house
[6:59] of God again thank you for the
[7:02] fellowship today the wonderful meal I'm
[7:05] a little stuff so we'll see how this
[7:08] goes I don't know if there was a motive
[7:10] there or
[7:12] not but we'll just see how it goes amen
[7:15] it's good to be a Christian it's good to
[7:18] serve the Lord and just just love him
[7:21] can't say enough good things about the
[7:22] Lord that's right amen if you have your
[7:24] Bibles tonight we'll turn to Genesis the
[7:27] 2 chapter and we'll read verse 8
[7:30] just
[7:32] one small simple
[7:35] verse with a lot of
[7:39] meaning Genesis 2
[7:41] [Music]
[7:48] and8 and the Lord God said it is not
[7:51] good that the man should be alone I will
[7:54] make him a help meat for him let's pray
[7:58] dearly father we just thank you for a
[8:00] wonderful Sunday Lord and just the time
[8:02] that we've got to come together and have
[8:04] Fellowship around your word Lord you're
[8:07] always so good to us we pray tonight
[8:10] that you'll just bless what your word
[8:13] Lord and just help each family here and
[8:16] everyone in their challenges and
[8:18] situations in life may you just walk
[8:21] with them in Jesus name we pray amen you
[8:24] can be
[8:26] seated it is not good that the man
[8:29] should be alone I will make him a help
[8:32] meet for him you know Adam was
[8:35] surrounded by thousands of animals he
[8:38] was surrounded by beauty that was
[8:42] incomparable but God said it's not good
[8:44] that Adam to be
[8:46] alone he needed someone to share this
[8:49] Earthly Journey with someone he could
[8:51] talk to someone that even God wouldn't
[8:55] fulfill God wouldn't fulfill this role I
[8:58] mean here's God the omnipotent God and
[9:02] he said it's not good for man to be
[9:04] alone and that is what we want to talk
[9:06] about for a few minutes today tonight
[9:09] this evening this afternoon whatever
[9:11] time it is is we're not made to walk
[9:14] alone not made to walk alone god Set an
[9:19] example with the first human being that
[9:21] it was not good to walk alone because I
[9:24] don't know about you but when we get
[9:28] alone
[9:29] it especially if we're discouraged this
[9:32] kind of goes into the same vein uh I was
[9:34] speaking of this morning it's easier the
[9:37] discouragement becomes
[9:39] magnified the the despair becomes
[9:42] magnified the
[9:44] hopelessness becomes magnified now we
[9:47] don't need someone to walk with us that
[9:50] sympathizes with us to always but we
[9:54] need someone that will help us see
[9:57] things sometimes for how they really are
[9:59] and not how we've conceived them to be
[10:03] and and so God knew that Adam needed
[10:05] another human being that even he wasn't
[10:09] going to fulfill that that purpose that
[10:12] he needed another human being that would
[10:15] encourage him that would walk with him
[10:17] that would understand him another human
[10:20] being and the right relationships in our
[10:23] life our our family our church family uh
[10:28] the different ones the right Godly
[10:30] relationships is a gift from God it's a
[10:34] gift from God and we don't want to
[10:36] minimize that we don't want to think
[10:39] that we we you know this world teaches
[10:42] this kind of
[10:43] mentality especially young people listen
[10:45] to this they teach this world like I can
[10:47] do it on my own I don't need no help
[10:50] I'll just Google it YouTube it tick tock
[10:53] It Whatever more I can figure out
[10:56] everything but that is not how God
[10:59] wanted it to
[11:00] be he did never intended man woman to
[11:04] walk alone and that is why church is so
[11:08] important uh the local church is vital
[11:11] it's important to our walk and our walk
[11:14] with God and walk with each other yeah
[11:17] the easy thing in life is just to walk
[11:19] alone because well if they're not going
[11:22] to agree with me then I'll just do it
[11:24] myself yeah it's more challenging it's
[11:27] more harder when you get more than two
[11:30] people you got more than two opinions
[11:32] yeah and you have to work on things
[11:34] nobody gets their way
[11:37] 100% where if it's just
[11:39] you so God said it's not good for man to
[11:44] be
[11:45] alone and what he is doing he is sitting
[11:48] he's setting a principle for until
[11:53] eternity you know eternity just won't
[11:55] have one person there there will be many
[11:58] people there will be many of us so God
[12:01] said it's not good for man to walk alone
[12:04] and and he followed this principle
[12:06] through the life of Jesus in Mark the
[12:09] 6th chapter verse 7 this is Jesus
[12:12] calling the 12 and he called into him
[12:15] the 12 and begin to send them forth by
[12:18] two and two and gave them power over
[12:22] unclean spirits why didn't Jesus just
[12:25] say it would be more efficient we could
[12:28] cover more ground if I sent them one by
[12:32] one no he knew that when one got
[12:35] discouraged the other would be there to
[12:37] pick them up yeah he knew when they were
[12:40] sitting in an area area that had a lot
[12:43] of persecution that was very
[12:46] unfly that they could come back to the
[12:48] campfire at night and sit together and
[12:52] begin to encourage each other begin to
[12:55] talk about Jesus who had sent them
[12:59] and knew that they were on a eternal
[13:02] mission whereas if they had been alone
[13:05] they might have got discouraged and
[13:08] quit Jesus said I sent two by two there
[13:14] was no need for Jesus to tell us in the
[13:17] Bible how many how he sent them unless
[13:20] he wanted us to catch something from
[13:23] that he could have just said I sent the
[13:26] disciples out no but he said I sent them
[13:29] two by two you know the brother Brandon
[13:33] shares this little story there once was
[13:35] a little boy who was frightened by
[13:37] thunderstorms and maybe we all know this
[13:39] story but it's a good reminder and his
[13:41] mom comes into the room and it's late at
[13:44] night he's scared and she's holding his
[13:47] hand and and she thinks her little eight
[13:49] year or nine-year-old son is asleep and
[13:51] she begins to walk out of that room and
[13:54] he opens up his eyes wide and says mom
[13:56] where are you going and she's like well
[13:57] son I got to get some sleep you're fine
[14:00] you're safe God is with you and the boy
[14:03] replied I know God is with me but I want
[14:07] god with skin on
[14:09] it and and there's a there's a lesson
[14:12] there we know God is with us there's not
[14:16] a doubt in my mind that God is with us
[14:20] but sometimes because I'm human I want a
[14:25] god with skin on it yeah I a god send
[14:29] people in our life to encourage us yeah
[14:32] to give us strength right he could do it
[14:35] supernaturally but that is not his
[14:38] [Music]
[14:39] way he could have built the ark he
[14:42] didn't need
[14:43] Noah he didn't need
[14:46] Moses he didn't need
[14:48] Joshua he don't need me he don't need
[14:51] you in in in one sort of way we need
[14:54] him that's right but but that's not
[14:57] God's way
[14:59] God is not about the most efficient way
[15:02] the most logical way God sets the
[15:06] principles God sets the pattern and when
[15:09] Jesus walked here on Earth he said I'm
[15:11] not sending them one by one I'm sending
[15:14] them two by two and the only reason why
[15:17] I could think that Jesus would do that
[15:19] is because he knows Humanity gets
[15:22] discouraged he knows that Humanity
[15:25] sometimes fear and he knows that there's
[15:28] a power there's a power here tonight we
[15:31] all come together we all bring our Li of
[15:34] fires we all some of you might be
[15:36] discouraged some of you might be cold
[15:37] but there's enough here that are
[15:39] encouraged there's enough here that is
[15:42] on fire that what it does that
[15:44] atmosphere begins to change those that
[15:48] might not be on fire those that are
[15:50] feeling low those that are discouraged
[15:53] will by the power of a group of people
[15:57] that come to together that God has
[16:00] encouraged their heart they begin to
[16:03] encourage other people's
[16:06] heart
[16:07] amen
[16:09] hallelujah in Ecclesiastes
[16:12] 4:9 the Bible says two are better than
[16:16] one because they have a good reward for
[16:19] their labor now now listen I I love the
[16:23] Bible verse 10 for if they fall the one
[16:27] will lift up is fell not tear him down
[16:31] when a person
[16:33] falls will not to make it harder for
[16:35] them to stand again that's God's job but
[16:39] the Bible says when they fall the other
[16:41] one will lift him back up but woe the
[16:45] Bible says woe which means a heavy
[16:48] Calamity the word woe to him that is
[16:51] alone when he
[16:54] falleth for he have not yet another to
[16:57] help him up
[16:59] again if two lie together they have heat
[17:02] but how can one be warm alone and if one
[17:05] Prevail against him two shall withstand
[17:08] him and a threefold cord is not quickly
[17:13] broken a threefold cord is not quickly
[17:16] broken see there's power in unity
[17:20] there's strength in
[17:22] togetherness uh have you ever felt alone
[17:26] have you ever felt alone but as I said
[17:28] earlier have you ever felt alone and you
[17:30] just needed another human being another
[17:33] Christian another believer to tell you I
[17:36] know what you're going through but it
[17:39] will get better yeah I know exactly
[17:42] where you're at but God who is rich in
[17:46] Mercy you're going to see the sun shine
[17:49] again amen hallelujah prise amen
[17:54] hallelujah Adam had Eve Abraham had
[17:57] Sarah Moses had
[17:59] Aaron notice when God Called Moses he
[18:02] called Aaron
[18:04] too he told Moses Moses said I'm not an
[18:07] eloquent
[18:08] speaker he said I stutter I can't even
[18:11] say things right God said don't you
[18:13] worry your brother Aaron has a part to
[18:16] play and I will use him in this
[18:20] capacity amen see when we bring our
[18:23] gifts together then the body moves
[18:26] forward every one of us have different
[18:29] gifts every one of us have different
[18:31] burdens every one of us have different
[18:34] strengths and we come tonight under a
[18:36] local church and God is magnified
[18:40] because not just one came but two came
[18:43] three came four came and all these gifts
[18:46] all these strengths all these burdens
[18:49] begin to make the army of God and the
[18:52] army of God continues to move forward
[18:57] amen
[18:59] amen Timothy had Paul Paul had Timothy
[19:01] David had Jonathan if you ever want to
[19:04] read a story of
[19:07] someone that brought strength to another
[19:09] person read about
[19:11] Jonathan how much he helped David David
[19:14] couldn't do it
[19:15] alone David sinned when he was
[19:19] alone oh that's a different
[19:22] avenue the serpent got Eve when she was
[19:26] alone yeah
[19:28] see there's power and
[19:31] unity you know I be there's power and
[19:35] accountability I believe there's
[19:37] power I'm going get ready going on a
[19:40] tangent but I I just don't even think
[19:41] like young people and teenagers should
[19:44] have full control over their
[19:46] phone I don't think so I think they they
[19:49] need
[19:50] accountability because we're human
[19:52] beings my wife has all my passwords she
[19:57] has access to my phone any time she
[19:58] wants not there's a reason there because
[20:02] I'm a human being and there's power and
[20:05] accountability there's power and unity
[20:07] but when you get along is when the devil
[20:10] starts talking to
[20:12] you right most sin happens
[20:15] alone or the birth of sin happens alone
[20:19] amen even when Jesus was alone is when
[20:23] Satan begin to talk to him in the Garden
[20:26] of Gethsemane brother Brenham said that
[20:29] was the hardest time of his whole
[20:31] Ministry he's alone Satan begins to talk
[20:34] to him Jesus even went as far to say god
[20:37] father if you would allow let this cup
[20:40] pass but then he
[20:44] knew that the god in him he be he
[20:47] recognized that that is not my calling
[20:50] amen brothers and sisters we need each
[20:52] other we need each other don't discount
[20:55] the power of godly people in your life
[20:59] amen don't discount the the power of
[21:02] accountability of godly people in our
[21:05] life amen we're not we're not superum
[21:09] beings we're human beings that by the
[21:11] grace of God he lives within us but
[21:14] sometimes this flesh gets sticky and
[21:17] we're living in a very challenging time
[21:20] yeah addiction is on a rampage
[21:22] pornography is on a rampage all these
[21:25] other addictions that wasn't such a
[21:27] strong C 20 years ago are riid in the
[21:31] church and everybody's coming with a
[21:34] smile everybody looks good but the
[21:37] problem is when they're alone with their
[21:41] phone
[21:44] amen amen we we we need people that we
[21:47] can be honest with we can be straight up
[21:50] we need people in our life everybody
[21:52] does ministers included they say I
[21:54] failed I did
[21:56] wrong WR but by God's grace he has sent
[22:00] me here to hold me
[22:02] accountable
[22:03] amen that's where we're living brothers
[22:05] and sisters that that's the world we
[22:08] live in we're all facing it
[22:11] amen you know the Bible says iron
[22:14] sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the
[22:16] countenance of his
[22:17] friend now I don't know much about
[22:20] sharpening iron but I would say that it
[22:23] deals with tension FR
[22:26] friction that it that it's not easy so
[22:29] when you rub two sharp blades together
[22:31] they make each other sharper yeah amen
[22:36] when you bring two people together that
[22:37] really want to serve the Lord they begin
[22:40] to sharpen each other they begin to
[22:42] bring strength to each other believer
[22:44] walking with believer yeah there's a
[22:47] strength
[22:48] there think about this Jesus even Jesus
[22:52] didn't try to do it all himself he sent
[22:56] disciples he
[22:59] he said disciples two by two as we said
[23:02] earlier God didn't call one man to do
[23:04] everything or one woman he didn't do
[23:06] that he called that there's a body
[23:09] there's a mystical Body of Christ and
[23:12] some's here in Elon some's there in
[23:14] Murphysboro sons in Africa Hawaii
[23:16] wherever it may be there's a mystical
[23:19] Body of Christ amen and together we
[23:22] strengthen each
[23:23] other
[23:25] amen amen
[23:28] amen he you know Jesus think of all
[23:31] think of the disciples he called
[23:32] different
[23:34] personalities different backgrounds you
[23:36] had Max I almost said max you had ma
[23:40] Matthew the tax collector Peter was a
[23:43] little gun hole I mean Peter was ready
[23:46] to whip anybody that looked at Jesus
[23:48] wrong yeah I mean Jesus probably had to
[23:52] keep a close eye on Peter because
[23:53] Peter's probably about to mess up
[23:55] something he's always he he was just a
[23:58] courageous person
[24:00] yeah God called all these different
[24:05] personalties and said 12 of you you're
[24:08] going to work together yeah Matthew
[24:12] probably looked at Peter Matthew
[24:14] probably was a very logical
[24:16] person he was probably very anal with
[24:19] the numbers he was a tax collector and
[24:22] he probably looked at Peter and thought
[24:24] how in the world will I work with
[24:26] someone as wild as Peter
[24:29] and Peter probably looked at Matthew and
[24:32] thought how am I going to work with
[24:33] someone as closed-minded as
[24:37] Matthew but see Jesus's economy is so
[24:42] different so when you look at your
[24:44] brothers and sisters said they're just
[24:45] so different than me that's
[24:47] okay that is okay yeah God didn't call
[24:50] us to be Little Ant little robots yeah
[24:53] he has a Min member body but we can gain
[24:56] strength from each other because we were
[24:59] not made to walk
[25:01] alone
[25:02] amen you know Paul's in prison I want to
[25:05] read these scriptures acts 27 And1
[25:08] through3 Paul's in prison he's on a ship
[25:11] he's going to Italy with other prisoners
[25:14] they're all prisoners and they're
[25:16] selling to Italy verse one of the 27th
[25:19] chapter of Acts and when it was
[25:21] determined that we should sail into
[25:23] Italy they delivered Paul certain other
[25:26] prisoners prisoners unto one named
[25:28] Julius a satarian of Augustus band and
[25:32] entering into the ship of whatever that
[25:34] word is we launched meaning to sell by
[25:37] the coast of Asia one and all these
[25:40] different cities being with us or
[25:41] different people and the next day we
[25:44] touched at sidon and jul Julius courtly
[25:48] intreated Paul and gave him Liberty to
[25:51] go unto his friends to refresh himself
[25:55] so here's Paul he's a prisoner
[25:59] and he he he arrives to sodon the city
[26:02] and and Julius gives him the opportunity
[26:04] to go to his friends the Bible says to
[26:07] refresh himself refresh
[26:10] himself I just like to believe that it
[26:13] wasn't so much Paul needed a
[26:16] shower probably most his life he needed
[26:18] a shower showers W the main priority
[26:21] back then uh I think the refreshing
[26:24] would have been encouragement all right
[26:26] strength yeah think of that nothing in
[26:29] this Bible was put in there
[26:31] unintentionally there's a reason for
[26:35] everything Julius courtly verse three
[26:38] entreated Paul and gave him Liberty to
[26:41] go into his friends to refresh himself
[26:46] Paul's a prisoner and he goes to the
[26:49] city of
[26:50] sodon and Julius was so kind he let Paul
[26:54] go to his friends to get encouragement
[26:57] to get
[26:59] refreshing amen strength as a prisoner
[27:02] he's a
[27:03] prisoner there there's there's a lesson
[27:05] here sometimes circumstances won't
[27:08] change Paul was still a prisoner when he
[27:10] left his
[27:12] friends he was still in
[27:15] shackles he still had to was getting
[27:17] ready to go for for the court yeah it
[27:22] didn't change his
[27:24] journey everything about Paul was still
[27:27] the same except he was now refreshed
[27:31] praise the Lord so we're not talking
[27:33] about your situation always
[27:35] changing you're there's always going to
[27:37] be things in our life that is hard and
[27:40] challenging those things might not
[27:42] change you're going to have the same
[27:44] problems probably you walked into this
[27:46] church they'll still be there tomorrow
[27:49] morning but what is different is if you
[27:52] look at this as encouragement that God
[27:55] said I will never leave you or forsake
[27:57] you you that God has placed people in my
[28:00] life to encourage me to strengthen me
[28:04] Paul was
[28:06] refreshed yes nothing was said about his
[28:09] circumstance changing we always want our
[28:12] circumstance to change but sometimes
[28:15] it's not going to change but what can
[28:19] change is how we look at it how we see
[28:22] it and God can place people in our life
[28:24] that may be been on that same Journey
[28:28] and they can refresh you they can
[28:30] encourage you they can let you know that
[28:33] yeah the situation is bad and it's
[28:36] challenging but God is going to watch
[28:39] over you God is going to keep you the
[28:42] outcome might not be what you
[28:45] want but you still can be refreshed in
[28:48] the middle of a storm thank you Lord we
[28:51] have to get used if we think life is
[28:53] going to be Utopia here perfect
[28:58] we're lying to ourselves that's right
[29:01] because once you get done with one
[29:02] problem there's going to be another
[29:03] problem probably yeah there's going to
[29:05] be another situation there's going to be
[29:06] another challenge we're not getting rid
[29:08] of that until we get to heaven but what
[29:10] we can do is be refreshed right what we
[29:13] can do is come to church and be
[29:14] refreshed call and text and visit people
[29:17] and be refreshed have friendships in our
[29:19] life that refreshes us but what we don't
[29:22] want to do is isolate
[29:24] ourselves because remember those that
[29:27] isolate themselves will fall de deeper
[29:30] and deeper and deeper into
[29:33] despair
[29:35] amen so when he arrived Paul found
[29:38] refreshing we need godly people in our
[29:41] life not perfect people not people that
[29:45] agree with us on everything we live in
[29:47] such a polarized country with the only
[29:51] way people get along as if they agree it
[29:54] was never meant to be that way I mean
[29:56] brother br taught the principle that you
[29:58] should be able to hug someone's neck if
[30:00] you bitterly disagree right you should
[30:02] still love them and we don't want to
[30:04] bind to that secular view view we need
[30:07] to realize there's a secular View and
[30:09] there's a Godly view yeah a secular view
[30:12] tells you if someone does you wrong you
[30:13] do them wrong a Godly view tells us to
[30:16] turn another cheek a secular view says
[30:19] it's all about me a Godly view says no
[30:21] it's not all about me I'm here to
[30:23] refresh
[30:25] people amen
[30:27] man amen we need people in our life that
[30:31] are Godly Believers that want to see us
[30:33] grow in Christ the type that will call
[30:35] us if we don't show up at church two or
[30:37] three
[30:38] times a month that really have a concern
[30:42] about
[30:43] us amen that want to see us grow that
[30:47] want to see us raptured out of here that
[30:49] want to see us in heaven
[30:53] Amen brother Brandon once said this was
[30:56] in 1965 if that that means anything but
[30:59] he once said if I had a trustee on the
[31:01] board that had a different idea and
[31:03] wouldn't stand up and would Express his
[31:05] own views of it I throw him off the
[31:07] board though as contrary to my belief I
[31:10] want to express him to express what he
[31:12] thinks yeah amen don't you want an
[31:15] environment in your life like that where
[31:18] there's this freedom to be who God
[31:20] called us to
[31:21] be amen a lot of times we only want
[31:25] people in our life that make us feel
[31:26] comfortable
[31:27] right that are 100% agree I like people
[31:30] that make me feel comfortable I love
[31:32] people that are like little me
[31:34] m don't you you say the sky's green they
[31:38] say the sky's
[31:40] green if they say they if you say you
[31:42] love M&Ms they love M&M's which I do
[31:46] yeah I like people that are 100% agree
[31:49] with me but that isn't what I need and
[31:52] that's not what you
[31:54] need we don't need puppets in our life
[31:57] we need people that shoot straight with
[31:58] us yeah that's what helps us grow it
[32:01] hurts but that's what helps us grow in a
[32:03] loving way in a kind way that really
[32:05] have a motive really want to see us grow
[32:08] not a motive of tearing us down or
[32:09] hurting us but a really motive young
[32:12] people that's you probably won't find
[32:14] many people that have that motive other
[32:16] than your parents and you'll find people
[32:19] but parent to me parents usually have
[32:22] that motive it it's it's purely that you
[32:24] want to see your kids on the right track
[32:27] there's no other motive there's no money
[32:29] to gain there's no friendship there's
[32:31] nothing other than unconditional love
[32:33] that you just want to see them do good
[32:36] and that you see them serve the Lord so
[32:39] usually parents are going to shoot
[32:41] straight with you but that's not a bad
[32:43] thing because they want to see you grow
[32:45] in Christ amen I don't know of any other
[32:48] relationship that's like that uh that
[32:51] can be as pure as a relationship with a
[32:54] a parent and a child but see we want
[32:57] people in our life that just make us
[32:58] feel comfortable but God gives us
[33:00] friends God gives us a church family God
[33:03] gives us family that just doesn't always
[33:06] make us feel comfortable right for it's
[33:08] not good for man to be alone and though
[33:12] it's probably times where Adam didn't
[33:15] have a lot of confidence in that
[33:18] scripture but God knew what Adam needed
[33:22] more than what Adam knew he needed and
[33:25] sometimes we might not feel
[33:27] able with the people that were around
[33:30] but if they have our best interest in
[33:32] mind then they're sent from God if they
[33:35] want to see us grow in Christ and grow
[33:38] in God and be what God has called us to
[33:40] be they're a blessing to our
[33:43] life amen thank you Lord that's good but
[33:47] for relationships to have a foundation
[33:50] or to be effective in our
[33:53] life they're based on one
[33:55] thing and that's
[33:58] respect for relationships if we're not
[34:01] made to walk alone and there's going to
[34:04] be people in our life of all different
[34:06] types even in this church there's such a
[34:09] variety of
[34:10] personalities just by the Numbers alone
[34:12] there are some of you that are maybe
[34:14] quiet introverted there's some that are
[34:16] extroverted that are more like to be
[34:18] where of the party's at there there are
[34:20] some that a good night for them is just
[34:22] to be at home there's others that um
[34:26] would rather just be at Walmart 24/7
[34:28] just to be around people I mean they're
[34:30] just people people but so there's such a
[34:32] variety even here and if we don't watch
[34:35] it we get so we magnify that P the
[34:38] personality and don't realize that God
[34:41] can use all these different people to
[34:44] help us
[34:46] grow
[34:47] Amen in 1860 Lincoln was elected
[34:51] president and he did something that no
[34:54] other president had really ever done and
[34:56] not many presidents have done since the
[34:59] 13 men that he choose to be on his
[35:02] cabinet most of them were his
[35:05] enemies he now think of this this is one
[35:08] of the greatest president of all time
[35:11] and he chose
[35:13] third
[35:14] men to be on his cabinet and most of the
[35:18] men bitterly disagreed with him but he
[35:21] thought that was best cuz he thought
[35:23] that's how good ideas are birth where
[35:26] people come together to have different
[35:28] opinions and just just hash it
[35:31] out and one of his biggest enemies was a
[35:34] man by the name of Mr
[35:36] Seward and he was his biggest rival and
[35:40] Lincoln asked him to be on the board he
[35:42] actually had ran against Lincoln as
[35:43] president there had been so much mud
[35:45] slinging in the election this man had
[35:48] said all kinds of bad things about
[35:50] Lincoln and now Lincoln had asked him to
[35:52] be on his board his cabinet and he he
[35:55] accepted but when it's all said and done
[35:59] this is what Mr Seward wrote to his wife
[36:02] about Lincoln the president is the best
[36:05] of us it's a wonderful Arc of the
[36:09] story that Lincoln has became my
[36:14] friend his bitterly enemy became one of
[36:17] his good
[36:18] friends that now this is the thing they
[36:23] were still not always in
[36:25] agreement they didn't still didn't see a
[36:28] lot of things eye to eye but they
[36:30] learned to respect each other yeah and
[36:34] that is what we're missing a lot in
[36:36] society churches schools whatever you
[36:39] call we miss that level of respect for
[36:41] each
[36:42] other I've always liked this I might
[36:45] even said it here years ago but brother
[36:48] Brenham said this and I always thought
[36:49] this was so good he said the medical
[36:52] doctor condemns the
[36:55] chiropractor
[36:57] the chiropractor condemns the medical
[37:00] doctor the osteopath which I think is a
[37:03] natural doctor condemns them both and
[37:06] all of them cond condemn Divine Healing
[37:09] now he says the osteopath does a lot of
[37:11] good things the caropractor does a lot
[37:14] of good things the medicine does a lot
[37:17] of good things and then he goes on uh he
[37:20] says the surgery also does a lot of good
[37:22] things even the medical doctor sometimes
[37:24] condemns a surgeon the surgeon condemns
[37:28] a medical doctor he says we need he's
[37:31] talking about doctors we need you and we
[37:34] need one another now think of this
[37:37] brother Brenham has a Ministry of Divine
[37:40] Healing especially in this decade in the
[37:42] 50s when he said this and a lot of his
[37:46] other ministers like AA Allen a lot of
[37:48] them was hammering hard against
[37:50] doctors you don't need them and brother
[37:54] Brenham took a total different view of
[37:55] it he said no we need each other
[37:59] everybody brings something to the
[38:02] table he said we need he then he says
[38:05] this it looks to me like that anyone
[38:07] that would condemn anything that is
[38:11] helping someone it's a selfish
[38:14] motive there's something wrong with that
[38:17] person that would condemn someone that's
[38:19] trying to do something good he said if
[38:22] we all would just forget that the
[38:24] osteopath the car PR the medical doctor
[38:27] the surgeons he even said if the
[38:29] ministers would forget it and we all
[38:31] work together to try to help our fellow
[38:34] man to make life a little better to for
[38:38] them to make their Journey a
[38:42] little little more
[38:44] pleasant what a different way of looking
[38:47] at things so what it tells me we need to
[38:51] try to help everybody at work we need to
[38:54] try to help people we come in contact we
[38:56] we don't want to come so spiritual that
[38:58] we can't be any human good that's right
[39:00] we're still human
[39:02] beings and I like how he said this
[39:04] because they's such a great principle
[39:06] you know my my dad unfortunately he's
[39:08] been going through kidney stones and
[39:10] keep them in your prayers Thursday if it
[39:13] doesn't pass he'll be get having surgery
[39:15] I thank God for good
[39:17] doctors Because unless God decides
[39:20] otherwise they will be taken out that
[39:22] kidney stone and we would just pray God
[39:25] will lead the hands of that daughter I
[39:27] don't care how God does it I just want
[39:29] to see him do it see see see man was
[39:33] it's not good for man to walk alone
[39:37] amen respect is the key though we need
[39:41] people to speak into our
[39:45] life you know sometimes you might tell
[39:48] your kid or your teenager you might tell
[39:50] them something and they they might
[39:52] disagree with you but you give them a
[39:54] little time you know they're thinking
[39:55] about it and then they come back a
[39:57] couple days and they tell you they had
[39:59] this great idea and you're like that was
[40:02] my idea how did it turn into being your
[40:05] great idea I mean I still want to get
[40:08] some credit for it they're like Dad man
[40:10] I guess this good idea it's like that's
[40:13] the idea I gave you but we don't say
[40:15] that as parents we just let it go and
[40:18] they came out with another great idea
[40:20] that they plagiarized from us um anyway
[40:23] I better get off that
[40:25] subject
[40:27] I still I got some kids
[40:30] here but so you know we we we need each
[40:33] other to speak in each other's life but
[40:36] in order to have a
[40:37] relationship that God can use it takes
[40:40] respect now let's look what the Bible
[40:42] says Galatians 2:1 I won't keep you much
[40:44] longer th this is what Paul says he
[40:48] confronts Peter he says in verse
[40:50] Galatians 2:11 he says but when Peter
[40:53] was come to Antioch I withstood him to
[40:56] the the face because he was to BL blame
[40:59] Paul called out Peter he said I stood up
[41:02] in Peter's face because he was to blame
[41:05] now what what was he why did Paul think
[41:07] Peter does something so bad well verse
[41:09] 12 tells us why for before that certain
[41:12] came from James he's talking about Peter
[41:16] he did eat with the Gentiles but when
[41:19] they were come he withdrew and separated
[41:22] himself fearing them which were of the
[41:25] circumcision
[41:27] basically Peter was afraid of what
[41:29] people would think and the Bible says in
[41:31] verse 11 Paul said I stood up in his
[41:34] face and I told him Peter you are to
[41:37] blame now Peter is
[41:40] saved Paul is saved but they're having
[41:44] this bitter
[41:46] disagreement so so the issue is p Peter
[41:51] like Paul had here's was the fundamental
[41:53] issue Peter like Paul they came from a
[41:55] Jewish tradition and Paul had Stripped
[41:58] Away all that traditional Judaism but
[42:01] Peter was having a very difficult time
[42:03] with it he was hanging on to a lot of
[42:06] his Jewish Traditions while still being
[42:08] a follower of Christ he just couldn't
[42:11] help it it was still being kind of taken
[42:12] out of him he was still trying to grow
[42:15] but who was helping him grow Paul yeah
[42:20] God didn't supernaturally come down and
[42:21] say Peter I'm going to take it all out
[42:24] of you no God sent Paul to get up in
[42:28] Peter's face and said Peter you got to
[42:30] quit acting like a
[42:32] hypocrite who cares what the Jews
[42:35] think we're not Jewish
[42:38] anymore we're not Pentecostal
[42:41] anymore we're not whatever our tradition
[42:44] is anymore that's the thing of the past
[42:47] we're Believers we're Believers and that
[42:50] means we're not going to do what our
[42:52] traditions we sometimes need a PA to get
[42:55] in our face yeah and say quit being
[42:57] hypocrite quit hold on to the traditions
[43:00] and follow the lord Jesus Christ yeah
[43:03] amen where is
[43:07] Paul
[43:10] amen now I'm not sure why well I know
[43:12] why but I think I know why Peter did not
[43:15] want to eat with the Gentiles in front
[43:17] of the associations of James who were
[43:20] circumcised he was having a hard time
[43:22] letting go of all those Jewish
[43:23] Traditions Paul told him he's wrong
[43:26] they're both Servants of
[43:28] God he didn't send Peter to
[43:31] hell he just told him what he's doing
[43:33] wrong that's right cuz he wanted Peter
[43:35] to get better that's it wasn't a bad
[43:39] motive but he really wanted to see Peter
[43:41] be who Peter should be yeah amen and not
[43:46] everybody has a bad motive that corrects
[43:48] us
[43:49] sometimes they some people really want
[43:51] to see us be
[43:52] better amen want us grow us closer to
[43:55] God and you you know what you know how
[43:56] it works though someone might correct us
[44:00] but eight months later we might have to
[44:01] correct
[44:03] them yeah cuz none of us are 100%
[44:06] perfect some of us just in different
[44:09] seasons that's
[44:11] right that's good so Paul told me is
[44:13] wrong but I want you to catch this how
[44:16] Peter viewed Paul turn with me to Second
[44:18] Peter the thir chapter verse
[44:21] 14 now this is very important because
[44:24] all that there must have been some
[44:26] between Peter and Paul but this is what
[44:28] Peter said about Paul who had corrected
[44:30] him he said now Peter's talking he said
[44:33] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[44:35] for such things be diligent that ye may
[44:38] be found of him in peace without spot
[44:41] and
[44:41] blameless and verse
[44:44] 15 and account that the longsuffering of
[44:47] Our Lord is
[44:49] salvation even as our beloved brother
[44:54] Paul also Accord according to the wisdom
[44:57] given unto him hath written unto you he
[45:01] called Paul not only brother but beloved
[45:04] brother Paul and he ALS said also said
[45:08] Paul was a very wise
[45:12] man now wonder if you turn to Second
[45:14] Peter and Peter was telling off Paul
[45:18] wonder if second Peter was all about all
[45:21] the trash in Paul's life but that's not
[45:25] how it was they were
[45:27] brothers man's not good it's not good
[45:29] for man to walk alone they were there to
[45:31] help each other and Peter must have came
[45:33] to realization that Paul really did help
[45:36] him maybe part of it was Peter's
[45:39] personality he just had a real struggle
[45:41] of letting go of some of this
[45:44] Jewish tradition that he was still
[45:46] holding on I don't know the reason maybe
[45:49] Paul was just was able to burn the
[45:51] bridges a lot easier but what I do know
[45:54] is God used Paul to get into Peter's
[45:56] face and say you need to quit acting
[45:58] like you're Jewish cuz you're not
[46:01] Jewish amen and then Peter was
[46:05] able to grow was able to grow let me
[46:10] read you something brother Brandon said
[46:11] about Nixon he said Mr Nixon made the
[46:14] brightest remark this is when Nixon was
[46:16] President I've heard any president or a
[46:18] vice president making the last few years
[46:21] when he said the other day what's the
[46:22] matter with American people they've lost
[46:25] their love and respect for one another I
[46:27] think that's a bright statement I don't
[46:29] think we need to fight
[46:32] dirty I mean you see all this junk on
[46:35] the
[46:35] [Music]
[46:36] news remember remember this news is a
[46:42] business and the only way news makes
[46:45] money is
[46:46] eyeballs because news get paid by
[46:50] advertisement so they've always got to
[46:52] keep something going I don't care if
[46:54] it's Fox News CNN they always always got
[46:56] to keep something
[46:57] going because that is the only way they
[47:00] make money they're they're a profit
[47:03] organization they don't have your best
[47:05] interest in mind these people make
[47:07] millions and millions of dollars they're
[47:10] not out to help the little none of them
[47:11] are they're Catalyst I'm not saying all
[47:14] of them as bad I I like some of these
[47:16] commentators but I always keep in my
[47:18] mind can they just tell me the story
[47:20] without their
[47:21] opinion just give me the flat news and
[47:23] let me come up with my own opinion I
[47:25] don't need to tell me what I should
[47:27] think that's my soap box for tonight
[47:31] right so we had to have this respect
[47:34] give me about maybe five or 10 more
[47:36] minutes brother Brenham said about Oral
[47:38] Roberts he said
[47:40] oral is my brother I love him he's a
[47:44] real fellow a real guy and I love him he
[47:47] just thinks the world of me and I do to
[47:49] him he said the pro he said the only
[47:51] thing is we just don't agree on
[47:53] scripture well I thought we had to agree
[47:55] on scripture to get
[47:57] along no that is all
[48:01] man-made so brother brand said we love
[48:03] each other we're brothers we just don't
[48:04] agree on
[48:06] scripture there's so much to learn here
[48:09] just in our daily
[48:11] life brother Brenham said before he died
[48:14] less than a month I respect any man's
[48:16] message that he's given about God
[48:18] whatever it is I respect that with all
[48:21] my
[48:21] heart he didn't say it had to be a
[48:23] certain level he just said if they're
[48:25] giving a message about
[48:27] God see see respect opens the door for
[48:31] people to help us that's right yeah
[48:35] that's right but as long as we can't
[48:36] respect people unless they see it our
[48:38] eye our way then there's no room for
[48:41] growth that's right because all we're
[48:43] doing is going in circles because we're
[48:45] just we're just hanging around people
[48:47] that are yes people we're just hanging
[48:49] around people that doesn't challenge us
[48:51] in our Christian walk they just do
[48:53] everything we do they're little puppets
[48:55] but we don't need that in our life
[48:57] brother Bram had a lot of people in his
[48:59] life that disagreed with him and he was
[49:02] okay with that and we should be okay
[49:04] with that because that is what helps
[49:06] people
[49:08] grow oh God help us to realize the gift
[49:11] of other people in our life let's say
[49:13] you're listening to a minister I won't
[49:15] say tonight let's just say you're
[49:17] listening to a minister and he says
[49:19] something he's speaking to your heart
[49:21] and then all of a sudden he says
[49:22] something you disagree
[49:24] with you put on the
[49:27] brakes do you shut down I mean you've
[49:31] been enjoyed it you've been amen amen
[49:33] amen amen and then he said that one
[49:35] sentence and you're like no more amens
[49:38] it's
[49:39] over do you ignore the rest of
[49:43] it or do you do like Mary the Bible says
[49:47] Mary pondered it in her
[49:50] heart do you say maybe I don't
[49:52] understand quite what was just said I
[49:54] don't even know if I agree with it but
[49:56] God I'm going to write it down and you
[49:59] just deal with my heart that's I'm gonna
[50:02] go home and get out the Bible and
[50:04] different things and I'm just going to
[50:07] ask God you show
[50:09] me see when we close the door to our
[50:12] heart then we close the door for people
[50:15] to help us if we just shut the brakes
[50:18] because it goes against something we
[50:19] bleed for 40 years that's not good
[50:22] enough we never grow I don't care if
[50:25] you've been around 92
[50:27] years there's still room to grow in
[50:29] God's economy and God's kingdom cuz God
[50:32] is the almighty teacher we will never
[50:35] know God fully on this Earth that's
[50:37] right amen but the Bible says Mary
[50:41] pondered that in her heart she that
[50:43] didn't mean she understood that didn't
[50:45] even mean she liked what was going on in
[50:47] her body and the different changes but
[50:50] all she knew to do was be humble and
[50:54] Ponder
[50:56] sometimes God's talking to us because he
[50:58] wants us to change and the way he often
[51:01] we often change is through other people
[51:04] yeah God help me to be that way this can
[51:08] app this don't even have to apply Church
[51:10] it can apply to our spouse friends
[51:13] Brothers and Sisters in Christ believers
[51:16] do we shut down when people just say
[51:18] something that that totally we disagree
[51:21] with or do we say you know I disagree
[51:24] with you but I want to pray and think
[51:26] about it maybe I'm wrong yeah we can be
[51:31] wrong I know that's a
[51:33] revelation I know that blows us our
[51:37] almost blows our brain to Pieces but we
[51:39] can't be
[51:40] wrong amen so God I you know I want by
[51:45] God's help and Grace I pray that he
[51:48] helps me to be humble helps us all to be
[51:51] humble that when our thoughts our
[51:53] Traditions are challenged we say Lord
[51:56] here am I here am I open my heart maybe
[52:01] I've missed something but open my heart
[52:05] because you said it's not good for man
[52:06] to be alone maybe this man this woman or
[52:09] whomever it may be it could be a kid
[52:12] maybe they're teaching me something I
[52:14] need to
[52:15] learn I had a Godly friend as we stand I
[52:20] had a Godly friend named brother Stewart
[52:22] he's from Georgia he was from Georgia
[52:26] uh just saw his daughter and his his
[52:29] wife his uh a couple weeks
[52:33] ago brother Stewart was a godly man and
[52:37] he passed away in 2012 some of you might
[52:39] have known him uh and a few months ago
[52:42] we had dinner with his
[52:44] son-in-law and his daughter and had a
[52:47] wonderful time and we were just talking
[52:49] about brother
[52:50] Stewart in his early years he had had a
[52:53] very rough life he had walked out on his
[52:56] family I think we did a testimony in
[52:58] Eagles view about it many years ago he
[53:00] had walked out on his family he had some
[53:02] other issues going on in his life but
[53:04] then one day God got a hold of his heart
[53:07] and he changed he did like a
[53:10] 180 and he changed and then it came a
[53:13] priority in his life to tell everybody
[53:16] about the goodness of God if you worked
[53:18] with him you knew that he was a
[53:21] Christian if you worked with him you
[53:23] knew you saw the transformation his life
[53:26] and so in 2012 he passed away from
[53:29] cancer I had talked to him a few months
[53:32] prior and he was still in such a good
[53:34] mood he was uh still just believing God
[53:37] was going to heal
[53:39] him and uh but I was reading through his
[53:43] obituary in the comments and this is
[53:45] what one man wrote let me say this when
[53:49] at his funeral there was a wide array of
[53:52] people there there was believers there
[53:55] was unbelievers there was a there was
[53:57] just such a wide array of people there
[54:01] wasn't just all churchgoers but he had
[54:03] affected so many people's life in his
[54:05] community that he had grown up at he had
[54:07] been a star football player in high
[54:09] school and then then he got his life
[54:12] together in his mid late 20s but this
[54:15] man wrote this about
[54:17] Steward he said we both Eddie and myself
[54:20] worked with Stuart but I worked side by
[54:24] side with Stuart me many years closely
[54:27] it's because of him and the word of God
[54:29] that brought me to Calvary and I wanted
[54:32] you and his friends to know he lived the
[54:35] word of God and was a True Believer in
[54:38] the Lord Jesus Christ yeah see it's one
[54:41] thing for everybody in church to say
[54:45] that but it's another thing when the
[54:48] people that you work qu say that right
[54:51] or you go to school with yeah it's a
[54:53] different ball game that's right and he
[54:55] had affected this man's life to such a
[54:57] point that he gave his life to God now
[55:01] steuart didn't never worry about whether
[55:03] they became a message believer or
[55:04] anything like that all he was just
[55:06] worried about is they got to Calvary and
[55:08] let God do the
[55:10] rest and and and Stuart touched so many
[55:13] lies because he was just always there to
[55:18] help another human being amen God
[55:22] said when Adam walked on Earth the first
[55:25] human being it's not good for man to
[55:29] walk
[55:30] alone in a perfect place called Eden
[55:34] where everything looked great it was
[55:38] beautiful God sets forth in motion a
[55:42] principle if it wasn't good for man to
[55:45] walk alone in the Garden of Eden when
[55:47] everything was perfect what do you think
[55:50] about
[55:51] today when temptation is everywhere we
[55:54] don't even have to go out of this church
[55:56] for
[55:57] Temptation we all bring it in with our
[55:59] little
[56:00] phones temptation is everywhere trials
[56:04] and tribulations challenges and and and
[56:08] polarization and all these things
[56:10] especially young people are dealing
[56:13] with but my prayer is that we have
[56:16] people in our life that when we're down
[56:19] they pick us
[56:20] up when when we don't feel like going on
[56:24] they carry us for a little bit amen when
[56:27] when we feel that the whole world is on
[56:29] us they carry part of that world yeah
[56:34] may God just bless us with people in our
[56:36] life that's right may God bless this
[56:38] church tonight that we you all as a
[56:41] local body be that to each other be that
[56:44] to each other and that brings a strong
[56:46] church when there's that kind of unity
[56:49] may God just help us all do you love

[57:39] of Genesis with it's not good for man to
[57:41] walk
[57:42] alone when Jesus came to Earth he didn't
[57:44] do it himself he sent disciples two by
[57:48] two when Peter and Paul had a bitter
[57:52] disagreement Peter Still realized
