so all right let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you tonight Lord and we're so grateful father once again to be able to come together Lord Jesus father into your house Lord Jesus Lord they speak about you to magnify you to Worship You Lord and father we ask God lord as we just enter into the speaking of the word part now Lord we ask God that you just completely take me out Lord Jesus that you might speak by your spirit the things you want to say tonight Lord and we just pray God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart father in that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak tonight Lord we just ask for your guidance Lord Jesus and that you will say what you once said no matter what I would have thought or studied Lord and father we do thank you Lord Jesus for the many answered prayers that you have answered in the church Lord and there's still a lot of needs Lord that's represented here and we know the god that you're more than able to meet those also Father and we're trusting you for it Lord pray for those listening on by the way of internet tonight we ask God that you just be with him Lord in a special way and help us all just to be blessed because of your word father tonight we ask these blessings and favors in the name of Jesus Christ amen also there will Danny will not be doing an online service tomorrow night I've asked him to take Sunday evening service instead amen amen this Sunday is carry in if I'm not wrong amen and sister hand if y'all want to get the chicken let me know amen all right and so praise the Lord somebody got to get that good chicken anyway you know so that'd be good amen praise the Lord um so God bless you open your bibles if you will with me we want to go to part three of uh and I thought maybe this would be my last one and it might be but there may be another one more service that I might want to pull out of this but we'll see because as I was studying this I thought I had covered quite a few of them but I think there's one that I haven't yet but anyway we'll just pray about it and see what the Lord will have amen amen now uh Revelations if you will go to Revelations the seventh chapter revelation 7. verse 9 and after this I beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which setteth upon the throne in unto the lamb open Revelations 19 and I wanted to pick out that word amen salvation saying notice here the first word that it speaks of is salvation to our God Amen salvation to our god over in Revelations 19 when the Bride Comes Back in the first chapter I mean first 19th Chapter first verse amen it says and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation amen and glory and honor and power unto the Lord Our God Amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen so we see in both cases here that this word salvation was mentioned amen almost one of the first things that it was mentioned so amen I want to speak with the help of the Lord on the thought of Salvation amen salvation Heaven that pulled up in the meaning of it it says uh preservation and preservation or deliverance from harm ruin or loss amen ah and one salvation a source or a means of being saved from harm ruin or loss amen and then in the theology part it says the second part theology Deliverance Deliverance notice the word Deliverance amen so we can tie in Salvation to Deliverance amen so deliver salvation is Deliverance isn't it I mean it's being saved immense salvation to save you amen it's our Salvation something that delivers you from something that saves you from harm or in this part it says deliverance from sin and its consequences amen now that thought brought me to Revelations 18 I believe it was where it says come out of her my people that you partake not over sins amen that you receive not ever plagues because if you partake of our sins you'll read the consequences of having to deal with the plagues that is pronounced upon the sin isn't that right so that is salvation that we find Salvation in that and we know that that was part of uh the ministry of malachiophora Amen how many knows in this hour Malachi 4 was our salvation amen by turning Hearts back out to the children at least that common smart here for the curse people with me for that we'd all been cursed isn't that right so it was our salvation amen and I want to also talk for a little while with the help of Lord on uh the uh what did I call it The Spoils of War The Spoils of War amen but as we think about this uh so I think I've covered that it says all right uh and from its consequence sin and its consequences believed by Christian to be Christians to be brought about by faith in Christ amen and that's something how many knows is quite something how Christians are certainly coming out of persecution how many knows that Christian was just shot up the other day by a transgender person wasn't it amen and some of those people on the liberal side well that's what hate gets you because we're Christians are haters you know and so they kind of like you know you deserve it huh can you imagine that kind of an attitude but we know that that's the overall attitude now Tarts Christians and so forth amen and all I can say is yes I do Harbor a lot of hate I hate sin I hate the devil I hate evil God hates a lot of things how many knows that which I also hate the Deeds of the Nickelodeons but I love people I live all I love all people I just love the sin and the ugliness and the horrible uh devil that makes people do things like that boy did amen and the people that have that attitude that you know just because you differ with them amen you know they they think you're a hater or you can class me whatever you want as long as I don't hate you and I stand for the truth you want to class me as a hater that's just too bad I'm going to stand for the truth how are you with me amen amen but because people do stand for the truth stand up a little bit for what's right yet you know oh my this just comes who's really the hater huh who's really the hater huh yeah I think we saw who really the hater was all right that's enough said but anyways we think about this salvation the thing of Salvation amen is something we realize that all of humanity the only one person ever lived upon the Earth that doesn't need this amen and that was Jesus Christ is this only person ever lived I'm fading in and out in that Donna amen and that was Jesus Christ outside of that every person ever born ever will be born is in need of salvation in need of saving in from harm or ruin amen and aren't you glad for salvation how many sled for the Plan of Salvation very glad for somebody people all done through history he meant has been people who has loved salvation Brother Brad I mean not brother yeah it's over in uh Psalms I believe it was he was really bringing this out and he read it amen I believe it was and I thought wow that's just wonderful I'll take that thought amen and that scripture on on what he said in verse 8 of Psalms 3. Psalm 3 and verse 8 says salvation belongeth unto the Lord amen I notice here in Revelation he says if salvation be unto our Lord God is the only one notice here he says it belongs to him he's the only one that can say I didn't have time I just got got in my mind just a couple minutes before service come over and revelate not Revelation but Isaiah we're different it wasn't say Isaiah I don't I think it was yeah it was Isaiah somewhere it was just I am the Lord I am your savior besides me there is none how many knows he is the only savior there is praise be to God he's the only one that can save anybody amen that can bring Salvation to anybody and David knew understood one person we want to talk about first and that's David David understood that salvation was God's that was up to God to say it's his business amen he knew what I like how he knew it he never glorified himself he never talked about his own saving him his own hide with the bear or the lion what'd he say the god that delivered the bearing in my hand delivered the lion into my hand he'll deliver that guy in the mind he'll do it David always gave God the credit amen that's what we got to do that's what we do I believe that's what the bride us that's what we say when we come back from the heavens of Heavens all together amen I love to talk about the future amen I love to talk about the present but I also like to talk about it well I'll tell you if you're unbeliever but they better bam say it's the most horriblest time that you can imagine for the unbeliever that lays ahead but for the believer it's the most glorious time lays right here in front because the scriptures that we read we know is going to come to pass in other words that day is coming why are you laughing brother because I am seeing myself and believing that I am in that multitude do you believe that you're in that multitude saying Hallelujah salvation to the Lord amen is worthy to be praised you know that's one other word we should take and speak on sometime is the praise God is worthy of amen praise him praise him praise Him David said praise him on the instrument praise him praise him praise him he's worthy of Praise everybody else gets all this praise but let me tell you in this house he gets praised of praise why because what you do this uh somebody that's worthy of Praise You don't give people praise that aren't worthy of praise you've heard of P that's praiseworthy well he's praiseworthy amen we know he is praiseworthy and so that's why we praise him oh we praise him in the morning praise him in the noon tide praise him till the sun goes down Praise Him Praise Him amen praise him praise and praise Him praising praising Praise Him praising praise I could just do it for about a thousand years can you just let's take about an hour just praising praise him praise him that's what the hell they're doing praising all the holy holy holy singing all the time amen the only reason we have to quit is because we get tired or I've always gives out and then this time element is a horrible thing brother John I don't like this time element amen when you get the eternity remember what he said if you were just there you had just arrived it's just you're there it's no future no past you're there amen and in praise God it's like the best moment in your whole life locked in because I'll tell you no matter how much fun you are know what moment no matter what your best moment is it comes and it goes you know it really doesn't mean a whole lot you enjoy the time but it doesn't last when we get over there it's gonna last David knew that God was Worthy and I mean and that's another one in the Bible another example of how that the Lord that how that salvation Belongs to the Lord and it was found way back in second Chronicles when uh Jehoshaphat I believe joined up with um my goodness see it was uh Jay-Z Balin Ahab thank you Ahab he joined up with Ahab going and trying to get and take this land that they thought belonged to him remember and they called all these prophets up you know and as a prophet of God put it and as the Bible put it you know they had the scripture had be to be fulfilled where Ahab would be killed and Jezebel would be eaten by dogs and all this and uh you know up in heaven they were saying who's going to go down for us and make this happen and this one said something and that one said something finally it says a lying Spirit came up and says I know how I'll do it he says I'll get into all of them prophets and I'll cause them but to prophesy a lie that's how we'll get it done and God said go ahead and do it he sended lie aloud a slying spirit to get into those 500 prophets of Baal and so forth and they all prophesied and said go up it belongs to you go up go up and they joined up with Ahab jahaz the fact the king of Judah and uh Ahab the king of Israel and so forth you know and they got together that's going together and so forth and but I'm talked about how that you shouldn't join up with somebody like that unless you really want to get in trouble amen and Jehoshaphat just Escape because God spared him from that army war if you'll go back and look amen I believe it was uh out there were coming after to has about and they stopped and they realized that wasn't the king they were after and then they went after it happens he had disguised himself and they finally got him amen but after that battle and they all went home Jehoshaphat went back home and the children of Emin and the children of Moab I believe came up after the children of Judah and against Jehoshaphat and so forth and uh they came up against him we'll start with verse 10 of chapter second chronicles second chronicles 10 if you want to follow me and we'll get this story here amen and try to get started amen second chronicles 20 and verse uh let's go with 10. and now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seer whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade I guess way back when they were traveling through their land remember amen and they would not let him pass by you remember that and then God wouldn't let him touch him just go around and so forth you know but not you know we didn't do many evil because of it but now he says when they come out of the land of Egypt but they turn from them and destroyed them not behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of our possession which thou has given us to inherit Oh Our God will thou not judge them for we are not might we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee boys that ever a good example when you come against something that you don't know what to do with brothers and sisters get your eyes on Christ amen you don't have the might you don't have the power but God does so get your eyes on him amen and all Judah stood before the Lord with their little ones their wives and their little children he says then upon now forgive me something for some of the names that I can't pronounce then upon jeh Israel uh the son of Zechariah the son of banaya and then I'm gonna jump down to the ending of that verse came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken he all Judah and ye inhabit them to Jerusalem and Thou King of King Jehoshaphat the saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of his great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's how many believe that salvation is the Lord the Bible is Gods it's not yours sure as you try to fight your battle you are gonna lose amen oh boy I don't I hope we all have experienced that in life and when you try to fight it you don't let God fight it in your life you're going to lose amen but Gods tomorrow go ye down again some behold there come they come up by the eclipses this and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jerusalem ah you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still stand still and see the salvation of the Lord with you Hallelujah didn't you tell him whenever we come down to the Red Sea Israel said just hold still just be still amenities our Salvation watch God work no matter where Israel got in the bond just hold still don't get excited don't get Disturbed don't get frustrated just hang out just be still isn't that the hardest thing to do sometimes when trials and tribulations comes our way get all that get upset just don't get upset don't you deserve this hold still be still be still and know that I am God I am your salvation amen how many believe that amen I believe there's ever a time to be still amen it's now if you want to listen to a message it goes along with this listen to a message uh brother Brandon preach what do is thou here preached in 1959-0301 1959 what do is thou here he talks about the Pentecostals and man he says if we don't tongues and if we aren't jumping and if we aren't running the Allison screaming to the top of my voice well we just had no service he says he says and what's it done for us nothing but divided us made us one listen to this and the morphed on to emotionalism and everything else not that emotion and all that's wrong but just that in itself it's not enough they talk about when Elijah was up on the mountain remembering there was fire and there was Thunder and there was an earthquake all these grumblings and things great things and he says still the Lord wasn't there but after a while he heard a still small voice that's what the prophet was trying to tell us in that message be still and listen for that it's not the loud things he says man did you ever hear the sunrise it picks up more gallons of water millions of gallons of water look like water's the land and this Saturday you'll hear the thunder after after it picks it up but you don't hear it you don't hear the planets and going into the big thing he says you hear none of the big things it's all quiet he says that's a real believer he have to have that love that's down on the inside but Ram says though you move mountains and though you do all of that if you ain't got that in there a consecrated life that's what you're looking for amen then you're still nothing but shh be still folks I'm here to tell you that's what I do I have better Danny Brad the same way if you really know if you want to hear the Lord speak message to you listen for that still small voice amen amen a lot of times I don't get it down on my knees praying or sitting on my desk praying sometimes I do most of the time it's just meditating on the Lord and keeping my mind on him and then he'll drop it down I may be driving it I tell you it was driving the tractor a lot of this I got today driving the tractor I said man I gotta get my honey I get my phone I gotta write this down I gotta say I'll forget it so I better get it wrote down and then run after another you know and I got to thinking about Tommy he said you know I was thinking but man for the time you know what I'm thinking it's coming to me too today I know what I'm talking about you got to think and then all of a sudden God gets into thinking and he began to reel itself and be like wow praise be to God I mean your mind is the precious thing and if you'll get gotten that's right good thoughts think on God think on the things and my eyes no telling what God will reveal to you amen praise the Lord you love him tonight amen so back to Jehoshaphat here notice what he said be still and see the salvation of the Lord you will not have to fight this battle oh amen what a lesson isn't it it's quite a lesson with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord if you ever really want Victory when you're having a trial start praising God start worshiping the Lord watch him come on to see because why God loves when you worship Him amen he sure does and the Levites and the children of Koh hath theites and the children of the coal rights stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high and he rose up early in the morning and went towards the Wilderness of two Tico and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem oh my belief in the Lord your God wow wise man believe in the Lord Jesus Christ amen so shall ye be established believe His prophets as so shall ye prosper Hallelujah I mean those you don't want to believe God's prophet he won't prosper amen he that receiveth the Prophet receiveth The Prophet's reward amen how many believe that his prophet he's just a brother like we are with a very very special commission and a very very special position with almighty God a prophet is like God's right-hand man on Earth Miriam Miriam Aaron spoke a little something they didn't say shouldn't have said about Moses they were both stricken they were going to die God didn't take too kindly of it brother branham's own wife hello his wife now you think she'd get a pass but didn't when she said something and slammed the door in his face she began that little something began to grow and get worse and worse and it was brother banham's interceding amen Lord spammed my wife she didn't mean that so forth you guys better sure he spared Aaron and Miriam even though better bam says they didn't live very long afterwards amen believes you've got to respect God's prophets you've got to respect God's man amen so shall ye prosper and we had consultant with the people he appointed singers unto the unto the Lord I like that how many believe we ought to be singers ourselves but it's nice to have special singers we appreciate our special singers everybody sing specials thank you God bless you it's always a blessing they have some people that's appointed to be singers because when I try to sing well you might just have a little misery but anyway we still try to squeak the best we can amen all right singers unto the Lord and that ye should praise the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord hallelujah praise you that's what they went out and praised did they sang Praise You Lord For His mercy endureth forever and when they begin to sing into praise amen then God said ambushments against the children of Yemen and he goes to saying how the cheese chick be still different ones they fought against the other ones amen and they killed each other now notice in verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them let me go back up one let's let's watch him fall first and when Judah came towards the tower the Watchtower in the wilderness they look unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies Fallen to the ground and none escaped I mean those God turns their own sword against each other salvation is the Lord's and when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them listen you talk about taking the dead people's stuff these people believed in taking the dead folks stuff all right that's a nice pair of shoes let me have them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels and they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away listen to this and they were three days in gathering of spoil it was so much [Laughter] Hallelujah can you imagine the battle was alarmed they give it to God first of all what did they do to help themselves they called on God they said we aren't able to do it but God you're more than able to do it folks when you give God or your situation you trust him and you see him do it there's a reward that comes with God fighting your battles to every victor goes what say it louder this spoil right amen now we got to a point think about Jehoshaphat think about um Samson is that right when he killed that lion he came back a day later and he was full of honey Isn't that right he went into that line and ate all of that honey had him a good time what a reward victory victory was sweet how many beats Victory is sweet they had all this spoiled now how many knows that when Jesus Christ come oh my should we jump over in the New Testament right quick let's jump over to the New Testament right quick amen we'll leave Jehoshaphat there now enjoying himself with the spoil isn't that right and praising God for his goodness now over in Acts 4 if you want to go let's go for over into acts four and we're going to look at the Salvation in the New Testament part with the help of the Lord for a few minutes uh first of all can you imagine if there was about four ways five ways people think that it's about a hundred ways to get to heaven maybe thousands of ways to get to heaven wouldn't that be confusing now how many knows when he said come out of her which was Babylon right come out of her come out of Babylon which Babylon from what I understand means confusion come out of confusion I like when it's not a bunch of different salvations not a bunch of different ways to heaven but one I am the way the truth in the life no man comes unto the father but by he didn't even say us he said me is that right one there's one way Amen in that way I believe it was Peter and them after they uh had raised the impotent man from up if I'm not wrong but anyway there were any question about this in chapter 4 verse 9. if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he was made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye crucified whom God raised from the dead even by even by him does this man stand here before you hope well I like his preaching don't you this is just it's just the other Buddha Muhammad it doesn't matter what religion there is out there there's only one right that's Jesus Christ amen how many knows there's not any salvation in any church Baptist Methodist Presbyterians Amish Mennonite evening La Tabernacle I don't care what it is there's no salvation in a church there's only salvation in one place where he chose to put his name and that is the name of Jesus Christ it's not father son of the Holy Ghost he says use the name go and baptize in the name of the fathers on the Holy Ghost not the titles of Father's son he said give me the name because there's no other name given under heaven whereby you must be saved not two names not either that way or this but no one name amen there's only salvation in one name for there is none other name unto Heaven given among men whereby you

that's where true salvation came from was on Calvary Street he fought the devil all the way all the way down into rap parts of hell he went the Bible says indeed so to speak grab them and he began to amen begin to grab the squirrels of War so to speak he had overcome the devil he went down to the Nellis and my blood is fresh on the ground up there I have purchased everything that was ever lost for Humanity now I want you to know the Earth is mine my children are mine all the spoils are mine Abraham and Sarah and all the Old Testament they were stuck in a certain chamber so to speak and they couldn't rise higher not until the spoiled blood was filled but when he rose those went up into a higher place with him it was their salvation sorry amen The Spoils of that war The Spoils of the battle and he went into Bible says he spoiled principality and power he spoiled the devil's power spoil it and then and now we and you and I tonight are the beneficiaries of The Spoils of the battle that Jesus Christ Our great savior thought which is salvation which is our souls being saved from harm how many believe safe and secure from all alarms nothing can hurt you not even death can hurt you amen wow and he went into Glory went to heaven Jesus did since he's went into the heavens of Heaven what did he do gave you the spoils and he says here when I ascended and gave gifts unto men huh one of The Spoils of War never thought about it this way hope is right I believe it is but it says he was right he didn't begin to give us what we couldn't have before what he do you give us pastors and teachers evangelists and missionaries and so forth for what for the preventifying of the body of Christ so that nobody foolish foolish age she could have to Joy amen they come from The Spoils of War the love of God that comes from the spoil of his War amen that was a lion and knew he couldn't come across that line but the devil I mean Jesus Christ took that line away now he comes right into his presence we can have joy unspeakable before wow hey man we about Rejoice with Jehoshaphat didn't we what they took more stuff from gold and silver than they could carry I can just imagine the big old bundle of all and I said oh boy oh boy I almost said good for many years not only that but you're gonna go find a place to dump it and go three more days working and getting all that stuff what was

that's why he's worthy of blessing he's worthy of praise what a great savior you and I have tonight what a wonderful savior what a wonderful foreign salvation salvation to be kept from harm to be delivered from sin and its consequences that's salvation to be delivered from yourself amen I thought of another way you realize how hard a battle sometimes we fight with ourself is that right because we all know that the biggest and the hardest battle that you'll fight is yourself yeah this this doubt here the unbelief fight the unbelief fight the doubt fight that well I don't think I can huh I don't believe I can do it you got to fight all that say no on the can I could I don't I don't say that I can on my own ability I'm looking to that Calvary that he's giving me that I can dump it out let me tell you when you get thought when you get the victory when you get the victory over yourself you're gonna be every day you're gonna have a job you see every day hey man you're gonna have a shout with you every day you can have the Holy Ghost 24 7. you can walk with God 24 7. I feel like scrounge and oh my we have services for everybody [Music] I like it but why don't you live like that all the time she should listen to him yeah we do that in church but we go outside the doors by the time we get dark cards oh I'm so depressed already come on folks I mean it shouldn't be that way well we had a good service now have a good life I believe it ought to be consistent don't you praise the Lord I hope that was all right but isn't that the truth this flows the war The Spoils of salvation Amanda getting yourself whooped out by the ram says now you can have fellowship with almighty God you have peace in your heart mind up Dove sings just so pretty and when did birds fly over your head you say praise be to God you look at the Sunset and say thank you Lord Jesus I normally don't look up but I see how beautiful a picture you painted they're in an artist in the world could paint that picture you realize we go to art museums and art places and oh look at that wonderful picture of whoever and whatever sometimes I don't know how I don't know about you but some of that stuff I think my grandchildren got a hold of it and just didn't know what they were doing and they called it really really good you know what I'm talking about some of that Modern Art I I just have to I don't know where I gotta go to see that that's beautiful you know I better quit but anyway tell you who's Beautiful Jesus Christ is beautiful his his creation is beautiful then we think about the art that God paints out there how many is bad for the sunsets the Sun rises the beautiful clouds just everything that God makes is just beautiful minutes we take it for granted don't we we just don't think about it the world don't think about it let me tell you something the whole world was if they really grasp it you grasp they'd be worshiping God the way you worship God on a daily basis and you know what by the time I mean that's what we want for people that's what makes this one a witness to anybody is look you can have you can have joy unbeekable and full of Glory you don't have to be depressed what was it well I thought about you know not by my nor by power the Bible says but by my spirit saith the Lord how many believes that you're not saved even the Bible says you're not stray saved by horses or or strength or this out or the other you get saved if God Saves you but by my spirit saith the Lord what wonderful benefits of The Spoils of what Jesus Christ died for and that is his holy ghost His Holy Spirit I wrote down in my notes I says you know if you really don't enjoy it if you if you don't think it's great you know by the try the devil huh try try the devil try the devil's spirit see what he does for you can he deliver you no the Bible says he can can't set it right all he can do is put you in prison he can't bring you out amen the devil's spirit is depression oh that's right you know what it was like to live in sin how empty that was amen it doesn't give you no ambition you have no rules you have condemnation your heart you have emptiness it's just oh my folks I'm telling you what any of you that's Christians that's grieve the Holy Ghost listen the script the Holy Ghost the way you know how horrible it feels not to have the Holy Ghost how many is with me all the rest of you is really good Saints you haven't grieved him for that's wonderful but it's terrible and it feels terrible it's horrible folks I don't know about you but I don't like to stay that very long as a matter of fact every night before I go to sleep I see Lord Jesus if I've committed any sins Forgive Me Lord when I wake up in this morning I want to have a smile on my face and I want to be able to face today with the Holy Ghost amen yeah try his spirit it's not a spirit of salvation no sir it's a worthlessness it's meaningless it's future less no future no purpose it's purposeless amen it doesn't strengthens but it makes you weaker it's just a real weakness the devil has and the only pleasure if you'll notice the only pleasure people have in serving the devil is drugs alcohol and physical feeling only what they can make their body feel what do you think over in I said Pittsburgh or wherever it is those streets are lined with drugs druggies I don't know if you all ever seen it on YouTube but it looks like a zombie apocalypse people are literally standing in the streets like this just standing there understanding there or in all kinds of weird positions Philadelphia it was where we have the stature of Liberty the devil has just made an absolute hell hole out of that place hundreds and thousands of people die from overdosing and they come in there and they've got stations where you put your needles in and so forth and all of these other stuff well I'll tell you days of catching druggies and and people with a marijuana and so forth those days are over pretty much they did to help them out doing their drugs and stuff the only thing that they have is trying to get some kind of a physical pleasure why because they have no spiritual pleasure they have no joy in their soul at all anybody that's away from God has no joy in their soul are in their spirit it's a torment the kind of Torment that'll cause a kid to do what he did tormented so horrible that they want everybody else to be as dead as they feel there's your problem people you wonder what they know the problem is there's a problem people who feel dead hate people have no Jew I have no I have nothing to live for and just want to hurt other people because they're so miserable yourself by the Christian Spirit it encourages it strengthens isn't that wonderful what God gives you what salvation brought to you amen let me finish with the final salvation what I call Defiance out final salvation the final salvation of course we know that we've been bought we've been purchased he purchased our Salvation right we've already been bought we were ready Christ but we're still in this body we are still waiting for him to come and claim his purchased possession he's not coming to uh claim something that he hasn't purchased or that isn't his possession how many believes you have to be his possession and you have to be bought by him if he's going to come and take you away but the rap shot at the rapture he's going to come and claim hit that possession we're going to read one more scripture over in Revelations 12. Revelations 12. verse 7. and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed neither was their place found anymore in heaven now who knows that the devil according to prophet of God is up there and he is accusing us before God as long as he's on that Mercy Seat he's there accusing us amen all right and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is calm salvation ha [Applause] and strength oh my I mean those were just a weakling like a sheep and so forth and Christ is mistreated and everything else and you know even Christ he's not coming he's not in the in his glory right now no but he'll come in his glory and he'll come with him in his glory amen but here it says now it's come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down whoa I'm too glad for that one of these days you'll never he'll never be able to come into your mind again and try to accuse you how many have ever had him try to do that I remember what you did I remember what you did oh yeah I think there's just about hardly anybody in here probably that hasn't had bad in their pasts we've all had bad in our past we've done bad things as Christians in our past your pastor has sure I've done things I regret doing I've had as far as I know I've made them right you know and so forth I hope everybody has you want to make sure everything's right but you still think about them the devil still brings it up into your mind and you have to remind him that hey you know this is under the blood I remember it and you remember it but God don't remember it and let me remind you of your future since you're reminding me of my past amen he was cast down which accused them before our God day and night folks I am very strong at being careful I believe we ought to be careful about who we accused of stuff and this that or the other amen amen you have to sometimes you have to do that but just be careful in it make sure that your accusations and don't go by hearsay and rumors and everything else because a lot of times that's nothing but a slop of the devil going around and that's what the devil loves he loves to accuse people oh you did this and you did that and you this they said that and the other maybe they did but what about when it comes back to you you did this and you did that amen Lord have mercy on me right amen but listen so they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony for their love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice be Evans and ye that dwell in them praise be the god oh I'd like to stop there can I just stop a minute we've got a couple more minutes talks about Heavens rejoice his voice is saying Rejoice Evans I want you to be there how many wants to be there to hear that rejoicing I want to be there to hear that rejoicing when that takes place because I guarantee you when we realize we're there the accuser is cast down remember when the president said when the bride goes up he comes down the Devil comes down and then whoa well let's just read it woe to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you you think the shooting itself is bad it is bad but I am 100 confident that it's just minor to what's coming how many knows this is just seed seed form wait till Hard Times actually hit if they're loot in places when they Riot and looten places killing people under Good Times a good economy what are they going to do when there ain't no food this that or the other it's going to be a riot folks unlike the world has ever seen and I know something else and that is the government they'll be ruthless as they have ever been I don't know this just kind of comes as the Holy Spirit speaks but remember it was a very civilized educated person of Hitler and so forth and them guys were educated people that did all that horrible things but even brother bam said most of your serial killers and murders and a lot of those guys are very educated maybe even doctors or real smart people educated people a lot of times and think about just because of the people claiming to be educated and so forth look at where it is they're going to be Ruth it's going to be it's going to be ruthless I'll tell you what I'm just looking forward to getting out of here aren't you woe to them he has great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time amen praise the Lord stand with me tonight if you will musicians you can come if you will and I want to sing a song but before I do I would like to read my final scripture psalm 70. six okay psalm 70. okay my problem is I put my sticker down below amen and verse three let them be turned back for award of their shame that say aha aha now notice all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let all those that seek thee rejoice in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let God be magnified amen how many believe that how many loves his salvation and they continually say let God be magnified how many believes that's what we do we magnify the Lord he is worthy to be praised he is worthy to be magnified amen pull that song up if you would Donna it's uh Hosanna blessed
