[19:42] [Music]
[19:45] morning hope everyone's feeling well
[19:48] today
[19:49] so that's that's all stand
[19:53] and
[19:56] brother Brian would you open the Service
[19:58] in prayer
[20:22] University
[20:33] amen
[20:35] children can be dismissed at Sunday
[20:36] school
[20:41] and let's open our bibles if you will to
[20:44] Ecclesiastes chapter 5.
[21:01] keep thy foot we're now goes to the
[21:05] house of God and be more ready to hear
[21:07] than to give the sacrifice of fools for
[21:10] they consider not that they do evil
[21:25] thank you
[21:27] for a dream coming through the multitude
[21:30] of business and the full voice is known
[21:33] by multitude of words
[21:41] thank you
[21:46] that is it that thou shouldest not vow
[21:49] then that thou vow that thou shouldest
[21:53] vow and not pay
[22:10] when the multitude of dreams and many
[22:13] words there are also diverse vanities
[22:16] that fear thou God
[22:37] moreover the prophet of the earth is for
[22:39] all the king himself is served by the
[22:42] field
[22:53] when Goods increase they are increased
[22:56] that eat them and what good is there to
[22:59] the owners thereof saving the beholding
[23:02] of them with their eyes
[23:04] foreign
[23:19] ERS thereof to their heart
[23:30] as he came forth of his mother's womb
[23:33] naked shall he returned to go as he came
[23:36] and shall take nothing of his labor
[23:39] which he may carry away in his hand
[23:43] is
[23:53] all his days also he eateth in darkness
[23:57] and he hath much sorrow and wrath with
[24:00] his sickness
[24:14] all right
[24:19] every man also to whom God hath given
[24:22] riches and wealth and hath given him
[24:26] power to eat thereof and to take his
[24:28] portion and to rejoice in his labor this
[24:32] is the gift of God
[24:34] for he shall not much remember the days
[24:36] of his life because God answereth him in
[24:40] the joy of his heart
[24:42] amen
[24:44] and can be seated
[24:56] good morning
[24:58] thank you for all your prayers for
[25:00] Gideon's surgery wasn't a big surgery
[25:03] but the concern was that he had had a
[25:05] reaction to the anesthesia
[25:08] his last surgery and uh the saying is
[25:12] true uh if it makes a big difference if
[25:15] you have people praying and if you're
[25:18] the one being pushed back to surgery it
[25:20] may you want everybody to be praying so
[25:22] or if it's your loved one if it's your
[25:24] child
[25:25] it's a lot easier to put it off when
[25:27] it's somebody else but when you're the
[25:29] one being pushed back to surgery
[25:31] uh you want people praying
[25:34] God fearing people praying and
[25:37] um you know when things like that happen
[25:41] uh the devil tries to put all kinds of
[25:43] things in your mind before even small
[25:45] surgeries like his but everything went
[25:47] well he's doing good
[25:50] um he's recovering
[25:52] swiftly and we hope that it'll help him
[25:55] a lot
[25:56] okay
[25:58] um this thought just came
[26:00] um
[26:01] I was uh looking at just the uh
[26:05] brother Burnham had preached this but it
[26:07] came to my thought this week as uh
[26:09] I was doing some things there
[26:12] at the store and putting orders in or
[26:14] putting an order in for something and it
[26:17] was the the thought of identification
[26:19] and as the world gets darker you know
[26:22] everybody's seeing they identify
[26:24] something but as the world gets darker
[26:26] and uh drifts off more into chaos and it
[26:30] just makes me think more of you know how
[26:33] we're
[26:34] pilgrims and restrangers here
[26:37] seeking a city to come
[26:39] and Dave talks about hearing Chronicles
[26:42] we'll go there and read that just real
[26:43] quick
[26:45] it's in let's see Chronicles here I'm
[26:47] gonna
[26:58] Chronicles 29
[27:00] starting in verse 10.
[27:08] David had a grasp on things and he wrote
[27:10] about here he said wherefore David bless
[27:12] the Lord starting it's in first
[27:14] Chronicles
[27:16] 29 starting in verse 10.
[27:22] wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[27:24] all the congregation and David said
[27:25] blessed be the Lord of Israel Our Father
[27:28] forever and ever
[27:30] thine O Lord is the greatness and the
[27:32] power and the glory and the Victory and
[27:34] the Majesty for all that is in the
[27:36] heaven and in the earth is thine
[27:38] thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art
[27:41] exalted as head above all both riches
[27:44] and honor come of thee and thou reign as
[27:47] though overall and in thine hands his
[27:49] power and might in that hand it is to
[27:52] make great and to give strength strength
[27:55] all
[27:55] now therefore Our God we thank thee and
[27:58] praise the Glorious name but who am I
[28:00] and what is my people that we should be
[28:04] able to offer so willingly after this
[28:06] sword for all things come of thee and of
[28:09] thine own have we given thee for we are
[28:12] strangers before the answer journals as
[28:15] their as were all our fathers our days
[28:18] are on our days are on our days on the
[28:21] earth or as a shadow and there is none
[28:24] abiding
[28:25] if you're going
[28:27] talk about being a stranger and a
[28:29] Sojourner
[28:30] and then Hebrew is here
[28:34] Hebrews 11.
[28:37] and it's just
[28:38] a small uh Hebrews 11 starting in verse
[28:42] 13.
[28:44] Paul's talking here these all died in
[28:46] faith not having received the promises
[28:48] but having seen them afar off and were
[28:50] persuaded of them and embrace them and
[28:52] confess that they were strangers and
[28:54] pilgrims on the Earth
[28:56] for they that say such things declare
[28:58] plainly that they seek a country
[29:00] and truly if they had been mindful of
[29:02] that country from once they came out
[29:04] they might have had an opportunity to
[29:05] have returned but now they desire a
[29:08] better country that is in Heavenly
[29:10] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[29:13] called their God for he hath prepared
[29:15] for them a city
[29:17] and just thinking about that being
[29:20] pilgrims and strangers identifying as
[29:21] Pilgrim and a stranger in this earth as
[29:23] you see the world kind of slipping off
[29:25] into whatever they're slipping off into
[29:27] it's not good it's Darkness it's chaos
[29:30] I was putting an order in for uh uh a
[29:34] mixer
[29:35] and the person I was uh chatting with on
[29:38] online I think his name might have been
[29:40] Justin but it said Justin and then it
[29:44] said he him
[29:46] so it had whatever they call those I
[29:49] guess pronouns but it's an
[29:50] identification well that goes pretty
[29:52] good that rhymes he him it should be
[29:54] because his name's Justin
[29:56] but anymore it might not have been it
[29:58] might have been something else but as
[30:00] you see people identifying themselves as
[30:03] whatever they might be he him or
[30:05] whatever she or sometimes they might be
[30:08] an animal
[30:09] cat or chicken
[30:11] uh me and my wife were talking and they
[30:14] got all the letters you know uh for the
[30:16] lgbtq and we added some of our own which
[30:20] is LT lgbtq s-t-u-p-i-d
[30:23] so which it's funny but you know it's
[30:28] really sad they they're in a
[30:30] identification process of identifying
[30:32] themselves and they don't really know
[30:34] what they are
[30:35] but as they're doing that as the world's
[30:37] going off into that
[30:39] we should be identifying
[30:41] ourselves and where we find ourselves
[30:45] and brother Brenham uh preached
[30:47] identification
[30:49] but I got it I got notes here but
[30:52] they're kind of mixed up uh but we'll
[30:54] try to get through it
[30:56] so in identifying ourselves
[30:58] we must identify at some point our time
[31:02] where are we living in
[31:04] and uh and if we look in the Scriptures
[31:07] it says as it was in the days of Noah as
[31:09] it was in the days of Sodom and more so
[31:11] shall be in the days of the returning of
[31:13] the son of man so we're there so we can
[31:15] identify our time
[31:17] and then we have to identify
[31:20] our message
[31:22] well there are message when the message
[31:25] went forth
[31:27] I got some quotes in here let me
[31:29] pull these in here so identifying our
[31:32] time as for this is
[31:35] now notice in the coming of the Lord
[31:37] Jesus is so close at hand and tell the
[31:39] spirit from way down in here just barely
[31:42] justification sanctification baptism of
[31:44] the Holy Spirit now right into the time
[31:46] of the coming of The Headstone the
[31:48] church has got to be so perfectly like
[31:50] Christ until Christ and the church can
[31:51] unite together the same spirit and if
[31:54] the spirit of Christ is in you it makes
[31:56] you live the life of Christ
[31:58] act the Life of Christ do the works of
[32:01] Christ either believeth on me the works
[32:03] that I do shall he do also Jesus said
[32:06] that see and now we're going to have we
[32:08] got to have a Ministry coming that just
[32:09] exactly like the Life of Christ what
[32:11] does diminished identify the coming of
[32:14] the Lord he says look at the world today
[32:16] and watch what he says Krishna saying
[32:19] but we could say Putin's saying same
[32:21] country all these other great things
[32:23] worldwide conflicts right at hand at any
[32:25] time to go to powder in any second
[32:27] that's right and if that if that we know
[32:30] that that that's close any sensible
[32:32] person can read in the newspaper or
[32:34] listen to the radio and know that that
[32:36] is close well remember then Christ comes
[32:38] for his church before that happens so
[32:41] how close is the coming of Lord Jesus
[32:42] maybe before today maybe before the end
[32:45] of the meeting today we're at the end
[32:47] time certainly true
[32:49] it's her time identifying her time
[32:51] identifying her message but a man has
[32:54] got to be convinced first and only
[32:56] convincing thing is the manifestation or
[32:58] the identity of the Gospel being
[32:59] identified in you when you see
[33:03] a creature in Christ Jesus that's at any
[33:06] identity of the Holy Spirit that's
[33:08] exactly right how can the Holy Spirit
[33:10] write the Bible and turn around and deny
[33:12] what he wrote he cannot do it he is
[33:15] that's the
[33:17] identity of unbelief that's identity of
[33:20] unbelief but the identity of belief
[33:22] Jesus said these signs shall identify
[33:24] those who believe now we know that's
[33:26] God's Own word that's true uh today's
[33:29] age they say they
[33:31] got
[33:33] Jesus they say they got the Holy Ghost
[33:35] but they turn around and deny the very
[33:36] scripture that they
[33:38] uh supposed to be preaching out of are
[33:40] teaching out of
[33:42] so identifying the message remember how
[33:45] brother Brandon said people say well in
[33:47] Jesus day I would have been standing
[33:49] with Jesus well if you would have been
[33:51] sinning with Jesus in Jesus day you
[33:52] would have been standing with Jesus
[33:54] today and they don't do it they deny the
[33:56] word
[33:57] and then the next thing that we must
[34:00] identify is ourselves
[34:04] identifying ourselves and I got it all
[34:07] mixed up here but let's read this one
[34:08] this is goes with us
[34:10] and that's what we want to look at
[34:12] tonight but I'm sorry I want I want to
[34:14] look at me and I want you to look at
[34:16] yourself and as we look into God's Great
[34:18] mirror of his word then be able to
[34:20] identify ourselves with some that we're
[34:22] going to speak about some of the
[34:23] characters and the other times in the
[34:25] scriptures and I want to see myself in
[34:27] God's looking glass because if anything
[34:29] will show you where you're standing it's
[34:32] it's the Bible there's no book like it
[34:34] because it is all truth I don't say that
[34:37] other books are not true but I know this
[34:39] one is true it's all truth because it's
[34:41] the word of God
[34:43] now Jesus given us example of what we
[34:46] ought to be looking at when he reflected
[34:48] his life to us through the word what we
[34:50] should see when we look into God's
[34:52] mirror we should see ourselves
[34:54] identified with him that is a perfect
[34:56] example
[34:57] now but we find out that as we go along
[35:00] through life that our character molds
[35:01] image that we are each one knows that
[35:03] you as you live so your character molds
[35:06] you into what you are
[35:10] talking about this little boy that came
[35:12] from the country went into the city this
[35:14] was before everybody
[35:17] kind of got a bunch of stuff but he said
[35:20] this little ad must have been raised in
[35:22] in the country and raised in a home and
[35:23] when you come down to visit his
[35:24] grandmother she said
[35:26] um she had a door that on the back side
[35:28] of it was a mirror and the little ad was
[35:30] kind of Lonesome and he was looking all
[35:32] around the house and after a bit he
[35:33] happened to look through the door look
[35:35] back at the door and it had been closed
[35:37] since they come in and the mirror on
[35:40] and it had a mirror on this side and he
[35:42] saw a little boy and he stared to the
[35:45] little boy to make
[35:46] friends with him and as he began to look
[35:49] into the glass he got up close and he
[35:50] turned around and said why mama that's
[35:52] me
[35:53] and that's what we want to look at
[35:54] tonight I want to look at we want to
[35:57] look at me I want to look you want to
[35:59] look at yourself and we want to look
[36:00] into God's Great mirror which is his
[36:01] word and be able to identify herself
[36:04] with some that we're going to speak
[36:05] about some of the characters of our
[36:07] times of other times and I want to see
[36:09] myself in God's looking glass because if
[36:11] anything will show you where you're
[36:12] standing it's the Bible there is no book
[36:15] like it because it's the truth
[36:18] and Jesus gave a
[36:20] yeah so that goes on then I had that in
[36:23] there twice but about as an example of
[36:25] Jesus and how Jesus lived through lived
[36:27] his life and if we identify ourselves we
[36:31] must identify with the word with the
[36:33] scripture and with the word that was
[36:34] brought in our day a lot of people get
[36:36] it confusing they say they say lots of
[36:38] things but they say they always like to
[36:40] say you're you're following a man
[36:43] it's it's they're probably following
[36:45] more of a man than what we're following
[36:46] him in but the scripture brother
[36:48] Brandon's message takes and points back
[36:51] to the scripture always points back to
[36:53] scripture and it takes Revelation
[36:56] sometimes to see that
[36:58] but that's what brother Brandon's
[36:59] message was to do for the great Dreadful
[37:02] of the Lord Malachi 4. Malachi turned
[37:06] the heart to the to Elijah to send turn
[37:08] the hearts of the children back to the
[37:10] fathers
[37:11] well that's what his message was to do
[37:13] is turns our hearts back to the original
[37:16] Apostolic Faith so the seed the time
[37:19] we're in now the identification of the
[37:21] time
[37:22] identification identifying our
[37:25] time
[37:26] our message and Who We Are
[37:29] and the time is it's about Jesus like
[37:32] Jesus said the time is as it was in the
[37:34] days of Noah as it was in the Sodom it's
[37:35] about going home time
[37:37] uh how we're in the time now of the seed
[37:43] the original grain and it's pulling away
[37:46] from the shut so if we can identify
[37:48] those things I thought oh after seeing
[37:52] that and how he they identify everybody
[37:55] identifies themselves as that
[37:57] I want to identify with the word and I
[37:59] feel like we do identify with the word
[38:01] we want to line up with the word we want
[38:03] to line up we're in the stages of going
[38:06] home and and uh the seeds now pulling
[38:08] away from the shock
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] the combines coming and we want to be
[38:13] identified in the right place when he
[38:15] shows up
[38:17] Brother David
[38:23] amen loving this morning
[38:27] they identifies a lot of things but
[38:31] I was thinking as for the Troy was
[38:33] speaking this one let's stand and
[38:35] thought you know what we identify this
[38:37] morning as we identify as a child of the
[38:39] king this morning
[38:40] it may not just a king but the king the
[38:43] king of kings
[38:44] and let's sing that little course oh yes
[38:46] oh yes I'm a child of the king this
[38:48] morning and oh my
[38:51] one side was closed in the rain
[39:00] oh wretches
[39:04] lost that lonely
[39:09] but with
[39:11] wondrous compassion
[39:15] the key of all Kings
[39:19] in pity and great love he took me under
[39:26] his wings I know yes
[39:31] oh yes
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] offline
[39:46] my veins
[39:48] [Music]
[40:05] [Music]
[40:13] the head
[40:15] Heavenly home
[40:18] and my
[40:20] Holy Father well he has made me his own
[40:27] now

[40:34] in his love and someday I'm going to
[40:40] sing or with the angels
[40:45] above I know yes
[40:48] oh yes oh I'm a child
[41:00] Vietnam flows through

[1:16:34] day today amen I just felt like the Lord
[1:16:37] was going to move today Amen in the
[1:16:38] special way and then uh the Lord
[1:16:40] answered to prayer on the message to
[1:16:42] minister this morning so I certainly
[1:16:44] feel amen like even our message this

[1:19:21] and it certainly will have a little bit
[1:19:23] to do with identification amen
[1:19:26] amen the lights just come on I guess
[1:19:29] something got brighter didn't it
[1:19:31] amen all right well praise the Lord
[1:19:34] hey man what do you think one of these
[1:19:36] days things are really going to brighten

[1:19:59] that right amen and so praise the Lord
[1:20:02] amen said it'll digest but amen we do
[1:20:05] have uh quite a bit on the platter this
[1:20:07] morning but we just amen will do as a
[1:20:11] holy spirit leads Matthew 13 let's go to
[1:20:14] Matthew 13.
[1:20:17] thank you
[1:20:22] how many believes that we're in the hour
[1:20:25] of harvest
[1:20:26] we're living in the Harvest Time and
[1:20:30] this morning we want to try with the
[1:20:32] help of the Lord to get us to truly
[1:20:33] understand you know that the only real
[1:20:36] light amen uh and I forget just which
[1:20:39] message it was it was Taurus the last of
[1:20:41] brother Brown's message she talked about
[1:20:42] you know even when God spoke let there
[1:20:45] be light amen there was not light amen
[1:20:49] and that that word was not light until
[1:20:51] it manifested isn't that right it was as
[1:20:54] dark as it ever was until that happened
[1:20:57] isn't that right until the sun shined
[1:21:00] amen that was the manifestation and and
[1:21:03] he said you know that's the way it is
[1:21:05] with any portion of the word of God
[1:21:07] because it's a lot of to all different
[1:21:08] ages the word of this allotted and the
[1:21:11] only light that there truly is is to
[1:21:13] manifested word for the hour amen I mean
[1:21:18] I believe we're living in a certain now
[1:21:19] and it's important that we understand
[1:21:20] the hour where we're living in where
[1:21:23] we're at amen amen and where we are are
[1:21:26] and who we are to be a
[1:21:28] ble to identify ourselves amen amen
[1:21:31] because we're certainly living in a
[1:21:33] world that has an identity crisis
[1:21:36] amen but we we're living in a world but
[1:21:39] now you and I are not in an identity
[1:21:41] crisis isn't that right as a matter of
[1:21:43] fact we're the forest thing from an
[1:21:45] identity crisis we know who we are amen
[1:21:48] how many believes that it's important
[1:21:49] that you know that you know that you
[1:21:51] know amen that's knowing pretty knowing
[1:21:53] amen pretty sure when you know that you
[1:21:55] know that you know
[1:21:56] amen so that's how we want to be we want
[1:21:58] to look a little bit this morning with
[1:22:00] the help of the Lord amen and continuing
[1:22:02] on talking about uh uh backs basically
[1:22:06] the original sin but we want to talk
[1:22:07] about climax we want to talk about
[1:22:09] Harvest time and if you talk about
[1:22:11] Harvest time you're also talking about
[1:22:13] maturity time you're talking about
[1:22:15] fruition time isn't that right amen
[1:22:18] before you can Harvest something
[1:22:19] something has to come to fruition it has
[1:22:21] to be ready to be harvested isn't that
[1:22:24] right amen so let's go to uh now in the
[1:22:29] 13th chapter of Matthew as you know
[1:22:33] um uh Jesus talked about uh you know
[1:22:36] talking about
[1:22:38] the two different seeds that were sown
[1:22:40] and so forth but the uh
[1:22:46] they had again Jesus sent the the
[1:22:49] multitude away and went into the house
[1:22:51] and his disciples came unto him he's
[1:22:54] saying declare on
[1:22:56] to us the parable of the Terrors and and
[1:23:00] of the field so if you first first time
[1:23:03] he described that he just described it
[1:23:05] amen as being tweet and tears isn't that
[1:23:08] right now he's going to explain just
[1:23:10] what he meant and he answered and said
[1:23:12] unto them he that soweth the good seed
[1:23:14] is the son of man the field is the world
[1:23:17] the good seed are the children of the
[1:23:20] Kingdom but the tares are the children
[1:23:23] of the wicked one amen how do you like
[1:23:26] that how do you like when he just comes
[1:23:27] out and just really makes it plain
[1:23:30] hey man we're not just talking about
[1:23:31] wheat and tears but we're talking about
[1:23:33] children of God and we're talking about
[1:23:35] children of the devil isn't it right it
[1:23:38] certainly helps you understand things
[1:23:40] and it also helps you not to bite your
[1:23:43] teeth or your your fingernails off
[1:23:44] worrying about people isn't that right
[1:23:47] we know that God knows them that are his
[1:23:49] and he won't lose a one amen
[1:23:53] all right now notice the Terrors are the
[1:23:56] children of the wicked one the enemy
[1:23:58] that sowed them is the devil the Harvest
[1:24:01] is the end
[1:24:03] um
[1:24:03] the end of the world gathered and burned
[1:24:07] tires so shall it be at the end of this
[1:24:10] world and the son of man shall send
[1:24:12] forth his angels and they Shall Gather
[1:24:14] out of his kingdom all things that
[1:24:17] offend and them which do iniquity
[1:24:19] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[1:24:22] fire there shall be wailing and gnashing
[1:24:24] of tea
[1:24:25] then shall the righteous shine forth as
[1:24:28] the Son and the kingdom of their father
[1:24:30] who hath ears to hear Let Him hear amen
[1:24:34] may God add His blessings to the reading
[1:24:36] of the words you can be seated I just
[1:24:37] want to say you know really truly it is
[1:24:40] only those who have ears that will hear
[1:24:43] I may know is it because there's all
[1:24:45] those people out there they don't know
[1:24:47] who they are they don't know what they
[1:24:49] are Amen brother Joe was telling me that
[1:24:51] uh you know I I I I I yes
[1:24:55] um you know uh Jason and them had their
[1:24:58] neighbor just the other day I guess to
[1:24:59] kill himself out on the portion from
[1:25:01] anybody because you know the conditions
[1:25:02] are so bad people don't even want to
[1:25:04] live anymore they don't want to they
[1:25:06] don't know who they are they don't have
[1:25:07] anything to live for and can we say
[1:25:09] where he would you be wouldn't you be
[1:25:11] about the same condition but you know
[1:25:13] pretty much if if you didn't have the
[1:25:15] gospel if you didn't have Christ
[1:25:17] I mean life just wouldn't be worth
[1:25:19] living if it wasn't for God Amen it'd be
[1:25:22] a terrible thing amen but praise be to
[1:25:25] God we're glad this morning to know amen
[1:25:27] now first of all as we think about this
[1:25:30] now notice and I just want to take my
[1:25:32] time if that's okay
[1:25:34] so we see here that uh Jesus saying that
[1:25:38] you know that the the Terrors of course
[1:25:41] are the children of the wicked one and
[1:25:44] then over in first John uh first John in
[1:25:48] chapter 3 and verse 9 says whosoever is
[1:25:52] born of God does not commit sin for his
[1:25:54] seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:25:57] because he is born of God
[1:25:59] and there's the children of God are
[1:26:01] manifested and the children of the devil
[1:26:03] amen praise the Lord so we're talking
[1:26:06] about God's children again and we're
[1:26:08] talking about the devil's children again
[1:26:09] amen who's whoever does not righteous is
[1:26:13] not of God neither he that loveth not
[1:26:15] his brother for this is the message that
[1:26:17] you have heard from the beginning
[1:26:21] we
[1:26:24] look at that Wicked one praise the Lord
[1:26:28] Dominos man if he was of the wicked one
[1:26:30] every one of his children were of the
[1:26:32] wicked one
[1:26:33] if anybody can't understand serpent seed
[1:26:36] if everybody can't believe that there's
[1:26:37] actually Children of the devil on the
[1:26:40] earth you just have to absolutely uh
[1:26:43] I want to say intentionally be blind you
[1:26:47] don't want to most people do not want to
[1:26:49] believe it
[1:26:51] and therefore they try to excuse
[1:26:53] themselves and say any other way but
[1:26:55] Jesus clearly declared it isn't that
[1:26:58] right that the world is the seed the
[1:27:01] enemy came and sold the bad he sowed to
[1:27:03] tear
[1:27:05] he clearly said that the children of the
[1:27:07] wicked one of the tares the Bible
[1:27:09] clearly declares that came was of that
[1:27:12] Wicked one his nature
[1:27:14] this wicked is
[1:27:16] that abuse
[1:27:19] amen but praise be to God and then we
[1:27:22] want to talk this morning with the help
[1:27:23] of the Lord about the gods children and
[1:27:25] Satan's Children coming to a climax or
[1:27:28] coming to fruition because that my
[1:27:31] friend is the hour that you and I are
[1:27:33] living in how many believe that
[1:27:36] oh my brother bam says in the God of
[1:27:38] this evil age he says what is this he
[1:27:40] says the world's heading to a climax
[1:27:45] amen the whole world
[1:27:48] is coming
[1:27:49] to a climax
[1:27:51] that's right
[1:27:53] the whole thing amen the whole story of
[1:27:56] the whole thing between God's children
[1:27:58] amen and Satan's
[1:28:01] children is found all the way over in
[1:28:03] Genesis of how did the devil and it came
[1:28:06] to Eve as you all know isn't that right
[1:28:08] it's three and four it's the Dead the
[1:28:10] serpent became you know we know that
[1:28:12] Satan was uh inhabited or he was
[1:28:15] anointing the serpent all right which
[1:28:18] the most subtle beast of the field and
[1:28:20] that serpent could actually talk in the
[1:28:22] park the serpent said to the woman
[1:28:24] well let's talk about the uh the woman
[1:28:27] the woman first
[1:28:29] woman said in verse
[1:28:32] but if the fruit of the tree which is a
[1:28:34] the midst of God and God has said ye
[1:28:36] shall not eat it but neither shall you
[1:28:38] touch it at least ye die now how many
[1:28:41] knows she knew what the truth was
[1:28:44] she knew what the word of God was and so
[1:28:46] but you know the serpent said unto the
[1:28:48] woman ye shall not surely die amen oh my
[1:28:54] God all right so he added in there and
[1:28:55] let me tell you something the climb the
[1:28:57] action with all the fruition of that lie
[1:29:00] is what you and I are experiencing are
[1:29:02] seeing in our day
[1:29:04] and every one of you faces that lie
[1:29:07] every day because you have the power to
[1:29:09] reason as long as you have the power to
[1:29:11] reason the devil has a has a right to
[1:29:13] come in there and try to get you to
[1:29:15] reason
[1:29:16] amen if you aren't careful he will come
[1:29:18] into that reasoning power and he'll get
[1:29:21] you to amen just do like eat it and get
[1:29:24] you to stray off and let me tell you
[1:29:26] something people are stray off and and
[1:29:28] truly the ones that stray off all the
[1:29:29] way we know the child of God won't ever
[1:29:31] all the way because it's controlling God
[1:29:33] Amen but when they begin
[1:29:36] and to go off
[1:29:39] all right now let's look at another
[1:29:41] script
[1:29:42] scripture here right
[1:29:44] quick
[1:29:45] if we could
[1:29:48] I mean over in the book is sure but
[1:29:51] every time I think about Harvest Time
[1:29:53] and and so forth I think about
[1:29:55] description I think you just judge
[1:29:57] yourself of how well this goes along
[1:29:59] with what we have just read he's found
[1:30:01] in Revelations 14.
[1:30:07] I'm listening for leaves who also follow
[1:30:09] me this morning amen we'll take our time
[1:30:11] and take it as a lesson would that be
[1:30:13] all right
[1:30:14] Revelations 14.
[1:30:17] amen now in this what we're reading
[1:30:19] you'll find that there's two heart
[1:30:21] harvests okay two sickles and so forth
[1:30:24] now notice and and uh I think I want to
[1:30:26] go back to Matthew one more time after
[1:30:29] that
[1:30:32] now Revelations 14 and verse 14.
[1:30:38] look and behold it read it because I
[1:30:39] already started but I'd like to would
[1:30:41] have liked to pick that up a little bit
[1:30:43] before
[1:30:43] forehand but now look and I looked and
[1:30:46] behold a white cloud and upon the cloud
[1:30:48] one sat like unto the son of man having
[1:30:50] on his head a Golden Crown and in his
[1:30:53] hand a sharp sickle and another
[1:30:56] angel came out of the temple crying with
[1:30:59] a loud voice to him that's out on the
[1:31:01] cloud thrust in the
[1:31:04] icicle and reap for the time is come
[1:31:07] forth thee to reap how many believes
[1:31:11] that amen one of these days that which
[1:31:13] God has redeemed and purchased he's
[1:31:15] going to come and claim his purchase
[1:31:18] possession
[1:31:20] amen I like that scripture because he
[1:31:22] described the sense to God one of these
[1:31:24] days is Gonna Come and get what he has
[1:31:27] worked for what he has labored for
[1:31:29] what he has died for what he has done
[1:31:32] he's going to reap he's going to read
[1:31:33] the benefits of what he has done
[1:31:36] now I don't know about you but that
[1:31:38] ought to make you feel a little
[1:31:39] something in the church this morning
[1:31:41] because if you truly believe that you
[1:31:43] are part amen of what he's going to take
[1:31:46] to himself
[1:31:47] and amen when he comes back he comes to
[1:31:50] come to claim to purchase possession but
[1:31:53] you got to be bought not later on not in
[1:31:55] purgatory but he has to buy you now he
[1:31:58] has to pay for you now you have to be
[1:32:00] bought with a price now amen not let
[1:32:03] later on
[1:32:07] all right
[1:32:09] trust in thy sickle and reap for the
[1:32:12] time he's come for a deed to reap for
[1:32:15] the Harvest of the earth is ripe
[1:32:21] amen how many bleeds that's what we got
[1:32:23] to come to amen then we want to take and
[1:32:26] I want to I want to show you amen the
[1:32:29] terribleness of of one side and Satan's
[1:32:32] Children when they go in the Antichrist
[1:32:34] amen that which is so deceiving deceived
[1:32:37] very elective as possible and then on
[1:32:39] the other side of course you know and I
[1:32:41] will just show you both sides with the
[1:32:43] help of the Lord this morning if we can
[1:32:46] all right now notice
[1:32:48] for the earth now notice
[1:32:51] for the Harvest of the earth
[1:32:55] is right
[1:32:57] I mean those Jesus said be ye ready
[1:33:02] amen we are now basking in the presence
[1:33:06] of the sun according to the prophet of
[1:33:08] God what are we doing we're ripening
[1:33:15] what is the oh my aren't you glad folks
[1:33:19] I don't know about you but I'm here to
[1:33:20] tell you
[1:33:21] God didn't stop doing stuff when the
[1:33:24] prophet left the scene
[1:33:27] it wasn't all over
[1:33:29] no it's not all over we are almost we're
[1:33:32] you know wasn't it 40 years that Israel
[1:33:35] journeyed in the wilderness
[1:33:37] before they come up in the border and
[1:33:38] before they crossed I was trying to do
[1:33:40] the math and since 65 now not not even
[1:33:42] before
[1:33:43] 465 but I think we're like 57 years or
[1:33:47] something like that since 1965 almost
[1:33:50] coming up on 60 years a lot longer than
[1:33:53] Israel ever Journey Through the
[1:33:54] Wilderness this is how long you and I
[1:33:56] have been journeying
[1:33:58] amen how many beliefs it's about time
[1:34:00] for us to come to fruition I want you to
[1:34:02] understand something and that is that
[1:34:04] we're one we're one or the other we're
[1:34:06] either a sheep or a goat or we are a a
[1:34:09] wheat or a terror going One Direction or
[1:34:13] the other amen because the world is
[1:34:15] certainly hitting heading to the
[1:34:17] fullness of its ripeness coming to its
[1:34:20] head coming to as the prophet said it's
[1:34:22] climax
[1:34:24] oh my
[1:34:26] God praise the Lord now let's look at it
[1:34:27] look at it again here now notice how it
[1:34:30] says and he see that sat on the cloud
[1:34:32] thrust in his sickle on the Earth and
[1:34:35] the Earth was reaped
[1:34:37] compare that
[1:34:40] with and I'll I'll go read the other one
[1:34:42] here in a minute
[1:34:43] to uh Matthew 24 and verse 31 and he
[1:34:48] sent his angels with all with a great
[1:34:50] sound of a trumpet and they shall gather
[1:34:53] together his elect from the Four Winds
[1:34:56] from one end of Heaven to the other
[1:34:58] amen now notice this is after the sign
[1:35:02] of the sign of the son of man appears in
[1:35:04] heaven and so forth then shall all the
[1:35:06] Earth of the mind uh Earth mourn and so
[1:35:08] forth but there's another reaping there
[1:35:10] but now let's look at this other one in
[1:35:12] Revelations have you got your page still
[1:35:14] there
[1:35:15] verse 17 and another angel came out of
[1:35:18] the temple which is in heaven he also
[1:35:21] having a sharp sickle now notice this is
[1:35:25] not the son of man I'm not the one on
[1:35:28] the cloud this is just another angel
[1:35:33] isn't that right
[1:35:35] compare that with
[1:35:43] Matthew once again the one we just read
[1:35:47] he says the uh the field is the world
[1:35:50] you could see that the children of a
[1:35:52] kingdom but the tares are the children
[1:35:53] of the wicked one the enemy that showed
[1:35:55] them it's the devil to harvest it's the
[1:35:57] end of the world and the reapers are the
[1:36:00] Angels isn't that right the reapers are
[1:36:02] the Angels verse 17 and
[1:36:05] oh no
[1:36:08] and another angel came out of the altar
[1:36:11] which had power over fire and cried
[1:36:15] I was him that said that had the signal
[1:36:18] saying trust in now thy sharp sickle and
[1:36:20] gather the Clusters notice how that
[1:36:22] Gathering how many knows that the
[1:36:24] terrors in the Bible say the bond the
[1:36:26] tears will be bundled
[1:36:28] hey man what are they gonna do burnt
[1:36:31] notice an angel comes from the fire
[1:36:34] isn't that right trust in that seek them
[1:36:36] out and gather the clusters of the mind
[1:36:38] of the Earth how many knows better man
[1:36:41] preached two lines there's two vines on
[1:36:43] the earth here's another Vine and her
[1:36:45] for her grapes are fully ripei I'm
[1:36:49] telling you what if you can't see the
[1:36:51] devil and his children they're becoming
[1:36:53] fully ripe you got to be blind as a bat
[1:37:03] can't even hardly go out of his house
[1:37:05] but has to wear blinders or something
[1:37:07] because people are naked and lewd and
[1:37:09] everything else the way to the world is
[1:37:11] make it and don't know it
[1:37:15] just
[1:37:16] sickle it
[1:37:18] into the Earth and gathered the vine of
[1:37:20] the earth and cast the casted into the
[1:37:23] great wine grass now notice this is not
[1:37:26] taking this punch into heaven
[1:37:28] but it's taking him to the wine price of
[1:37:32] the wrath of Almighty Gods amen what is
[1:37:35] it the Great Tribulation period name and
[1:37:38] they'll be weeping and wailing and
[1:37:40] gnashing of teeth
[1:37:42] and the Wine Pass was trodden without
[1:37:44] the city and blood came out of the wine
[1:37:46] press even into the horse's bridles by
[1:37:48] the space of a thousand six hundred
[1:37:50] furlongs
[1:37:53] wow
[1:37:54] so we see folks how that we're living in
[1:37:56] the hour
[1:37:58] and it just inspires me does something
[1:38:00] to me to think that we are living in the
[1:38:02] age of climax where in the age of
[1:38:05] maturity
[1:38:06] both the True Vine and the false mind is
[1:38:10] coming to maturity
[1:38:13] think about it folks amen that's brother
[1:38:16] Troy read that and I don't like to know
[1:38:18] I'd look for it for it he says you know
[1:38:20] Amen to those children of God that God
[1:38:22] elections Lexi says yeah we will be
[1:38:24] trained to be conformed to the image of
[1:38:27] his son this is in order to be United
[1:38:30] with him how many believe that you've
[1:38:32] got to have to be some kind of some kind
[1:38:34] if you're gonna have changed from this
[1:38:36] body amen and you're gonna meet the Lord
[1:38:38] Jesus in the air what manner of persons
[1:38:41] want you to be in all holy conversation
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:48] praise the Lord
[1:38:49] my my
[1:38:52] all right praise be to God you love him
[1:38:57] so we see here
[1:38:59] it is ripening time this is fruition
[1:39:02] time
[1:39:03] praise the Lord
[1:39:05] amen
[1:39:07] now
[1:39:08] notice
[1:39:10] how that in
[1:39:12] how many knows that the devil's ambition
[1:39:13] the devil's ambition has been to be a
[1:39:17] god like God is
[1:39:20] to have to be worshiped
[1:39:22] that's been his ambition in the first
[1:39:24] place
[1:39:26] amen and he started out with a lie in
[1:39:29] the Garden of Eden and all of his
[1:39:31] followers also follow a lie
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:38] the whole world is following that lie
[1:39:44] Lord help us
[1:39:45] the Bible talks about how that it would
[1:39:47] be so deceiving that if it was possible
[1:39:49] it would deceive the very elected
[1:39:53] amen now let's look at let's look at
[1:39:56] let's look at the Loop here first of all
[1:39:58] amen I want to talk a look at the look
[1:40:01] at the devil's Church basically but
[1:40:03] let's just read a quote here out of God
[1:40:05] of this evil age now notice where the
[1:40:08] world's heading to a climax and he says
[1:40:10] and now notice why the spirit of
[1:40:13] lawlessness modern Decay moderate moral
[1:40:18] decay
[1:40:20] lawlessness tell me something when we've
[1:40:22] ever had
[1:40:24] oh my you and I probably laugh we scorn
[1:40:29] when people would talk about dismissing
[1:40:31] the police force
[1:40:33] is that right
[1:40:34] and not supporting the police force what
[1:40:37] kind of world are we going to have an
[1:40:39] authority thought they could do it and
[1:40:41] it would be better
[1:40:44] and it's bad enough as it is tell me
[1:40:47] what kind of a mentality is that
[1:40:54] flawlessness
[1:40:56] didn't want law anymore I mean they
[1:40:58] don't want the children of the devil
[1:41:00] they don't want any kind of law
[1:41:02] they don't want any kind of Moral Moral
[1:41:05] Decay lawlessness is what's going to
[1:41:07] proceed I mean these type of things for
[1:41:09] prophecy by the almighty by
[1:41:12] almighty God through the prophet
[1:41:15] one place he said you know I believe it
[1:41:17] was in the uh uh anointed ones in the
[1:41:20] end time he said you know I may go by
[1:41:22] the way of the grave but if I do you
[1:41:24] just remember my words one day you'll
[1:41:26] know that what I've told you is the
[1:41:28] truth
[1:41:29] and I'm here to tell you I can verify
[1:41:31] that's it's nothing but the truth
[1:41:33] prophet of God that it's exactly like
[1:41:35] what you said it was
[1:41:36] whenever he was still backing
[1:41:38] in the 1960s in the Pentecostals which
[1:41:41] are still shouting and speaking in
[1:41:43] tongues and everything on and all that
[1:41:44] they were doing he said they are dead
[1:41:50] that would be hard to say see brother
[1:41:52] banham when he preached he preached
[1:41:54] up-to-date messages
[1:41:56] go back and look at that tell you what
[1:41:58] the one one way to not be deceived if
[1:42:00] you don't want to be deceived and I
[1:42:03] thought about because let me see I like
[1:42:04] that in the Book of Revelations because
[1:42:05] you know how many beliefs that we are in
[1:42:07] the Book of Revelations
[1:42:09] we're living in the Buckle Revelations
[1:42:11] we're living in that hot
[1:42:15] Simon got it from all Amen to see the
[1:42:18] ocean in them
[1:42:19] Mary he's gonna call us all up
[1:42:24] you're looking in that book of
[1:42:26] Revelation
[1:42:29] oh my
[1:42:31] God but this Antichrist talk about the
[1:42:32] Antichrist if you don't want to be
[1:42:34] deceived because it says blessed over in
[1:42:36] Revelations there's blessed are they
[1:42:37] that hear and read the prophecy of this
[1:42:39] book I may believe you're a blessed
[1:42:42] person none of you just hear it with
[1:42:43] your ear but if you can understand what
[1:42:45] this is all about amen because it's your
[1:42:47] only chance of not being deceived
[1:42:49] because remember like certain teenagers
[1:42:50] and all who all wander after the Beast
[1:42:53] whose names are not written in the last
[1:42:54] book of life and the foundation of the
[1:42:56] world the whole world wanders after the
[1:42:59] Beast
[1:43:00] foreign
[1:43:02] except for those whose names are in the
[1:43:04] Book of Life
[1:43:05] of the Lamb saved from the foundation of
[1:43:08] the world and you don't want to be
[1:43:09] deceived and then I believe the anointed
[1:43:11] ones at the end time he does even the
[1:43:12] Pentecostals they would never amen go
[1:43:14] for somebody coming up and saying I'm
[1:43:16] Jesus
[1:43:18] I don't care if you have nail scars here
[1:43:20] here and in your side because you could
[1:43:23] do that
[1:43:25] they wouldn't fall for it because we
[1:43:26] know better
[1:43:28] they know better
[1:43:29] but in Matthew 4 24 24 24 says you know
[1:43:32] that they'll come and do signs and ones
[1:43:34] are in so much
[1:43:36] a bit more possible they would deceive
[1:43:37] them very elected so that this devil
[1:43:40] that we're dealing with this Satan that
[1:43:42] we're dealing with this deception is so
[1:43:43] deceiving that if it were possible and
[1:43:46] he says you know the Bible's you know
[1:43:47] and then whatever it's whatever saying
[1:43:48] was you know they wouldn't take a Jesus
[1:43:50] but the Bible says they are false
[1:43:52] christs shall rise
[1:43:54] false anointed once and he says man as
[1:43:57] far as the Pentecostals you they got
[1:43:58] them and makes a statement some old cold
[1:44:01] former church that's not going to
[1:44:03] deceive nobody but it's those that are
[1:44:05] under the anointing those the Holy Ghost
[1:44:07] they can speak and they can preach as
[1:44:09] much as what I am this morning amen and
[1:44:11] they can make it sound so ever so good
[1:44:12] but there's only one little bitty
[1:44:14] difference and that is is it according
[1:44:16] to the word of God or not
[1:44:18] you can't tell by oh they'll tell you oh
[1:44:21] I got healed I got this I got that
[1:44:22] they'll heal they'll do all of those
[1:44:24] things
[1:44:25] because they said they would come and do
[1:44:27] this out or the other but are they
[1:44:28] according to the word of God or not
[1:44:30] that's the only way you'll know
[1:44:33] he makes that statement in anointed once
[1:44:35] he says you know as far as the United
[1:44:37] you can't tell the only way you can tell
[1:44:40] is he said according to the word because
[1:44:41] they were having blood coming out of
[1:44:43] their hands and the oil and laid hands
[1:44:45] on the six and do all of that he says
[1:44:47] and look they've got
[1:44:50] brother Brandon
[1:44:52] he got right with him
[1:44:55] he got right with him
[1:44:57] he says and then you go near somebody
[1:44:59] teaches that no that you know you can
[1:45:02] listen to the prophet when he's Healing
[1:45:04] The Sick and so forth but don't listen
[1:45:05] to his Doctrine he said you go tell it
[1:45:07] to you and then you go teach the women
[1:45:10] they can cut their hair and they can do
[1:45:11] this out of the other and yes
[1:45:13] you have all these signs and wonders
[1:45:15] following he says you are deceived
[1:45:19] because our real spirit of God it would
[1:45:21] not go a contrary to the word of God
[1:45:25] amen and that's why he declared he says
[1:45:27] the most deceiving thing amen the last
[1:45:29] thing was the Pentecostals we know that
[1:45:31] you're the original we know there was
[1:45:32] God's move on to Susan Street
[1:45:34] I mean he says all 100 God nothing but
[1:45:37] God but it was the same black
[1:45:40] if the loser brought out in the same
[1:45:42] life that came up Wesley gave me in the
[1:45:43] same life the company Pentecost and made
[1:45:45] it all the way up to the shop all the
[1:45:47] way up to that seated looked like the
[1:45:49] city looked like the original Pentecost
[1:45:51] it looked like it but it was just the
[1:45:53] carrier
[1:45:54] now there's people in there saved but
[1:45:56] there's always that group that comes
[1:45:57] afterwards that the amen ends up dying
[1:45:59] isn't that right and that group
[1:46:01] afterwards they wouldn't accept Christ
[1:46:06] you talk about coming to fruition folks
[1:46:08] we can't blow my brother even better by
[1:46:10] himself loser's message won't work today
[1:46:12] Wesley's message won't work today
[1:46:13] Pentecost won't work today you've got to
[1:46:16] have a message come out of her my people
[1:46:22] that's the message and go into
[1:46:26] he says it's very deceiving when people
[1:46:29] can do signs and wonders they can have
[1:46:31] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[1:46:33] preachers preach the house now I have
[1:46:35] sat under preachers I could name their
[1:46:37] names probably could maybe this morning
[1:46:39] preachers that could preach man you're
[1:46:42] just man they just preach wow
[1:46:46] and be wrong
[1:46:48] and I could sit back there and I could
[1:46:49] say that man is wrong
[1:46:51] I don't care how much anointing is what
[1:46:52] he's saying is not according to what the
[1:46:54] prophet said
[1:46:56] when a few years later you're way off
[1:46:58] somewhere
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:01] that's right how many you got to have
[1:47:02] discernment I don't care how much the
[1:47:04] anointing is
[1:47:06] can be the genuine Holy Ghost the rain
[1:47:08] falls on the just and the on Dust both
[1:47:10] the wheat and the Bears they already
[1:47:12] dies yeah they can do all of those they
[1:47:14] can decide some wonders it's a deceiving
[1:47:16] hour brother sisters
[1:47:20] but aren't you glad to say with what
[1:47:22] that Prophet said say what he said
[1:47:24] see what the Bible says stay with the
[1:47:26] word
[1:47:29] when you think about it
[1:47:31] and you can do that
[1:47:34] oh you ought to be the happiest person
[1:47:37] in the world
[1:47:39] how many beliefs you got to know who you
[1:47:40] are
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:45] praise the Lord
[1:47:47] let's look at some first of all we're
[1:47:50] going to look at the bride and what
[1:47:52] she's going to have to have to be ready
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:56] yeah right but first we want to look
[1:47:59] at another category of people
[1:48:02] found in Matthew 25.
[1:48:08] then we want to go back again with the
[1:48:10] help of the Lord with go to Revelations
[1:48:12] 3.
[1:48:13] and look at this church
[1:48:15] of the laodiceans
[1:48:17] and the category that he put him in
[1:48:20] can I just stop and pick up a quote I
[1:48:22] wanted to read to you before we get
[1:48:23] going then we'll go back to Matthew 25.
[1:48:25] but a bam says I like a good
[1:48:27] old-fashioned Pentecostal singing where
[1:48:29] you forget the
[1:48:30] when you get you can have don't have
[1:48:32] that get into all that kind of music of
[1:48:34] ritualistic put on program where you
[1:48:36] raise up your hands with tears running
[1:48:38] down your cheeks I don't care whether
[1:48:41] you can sing
[1:48:45] or not
[1:48:48] and just sing from the spirit from the
[1:48:51] heart and give praise to God
[1:48:53] not all out of a program you got to get
[1:48:55] out of man's program just to get in
[1:48:57] God's programs just get out of that oh
[1:48:59] my deliver me from being an actor be
[1:49:02] what you are amen God will bless you how
[1:49:05] many knows another place he says you
[1:49:06] know it's time that the people of God be
[1:49:09] who they are godspeed the day that
[1:49:11] everybody will be who they are I thought
[1:49:14] that's what I want to be I want to be
[1:49:15] who I am oh some people might think it's
[1:49:18] so hard to read a message believer oh
[1:49:20] man the message is so strict I want you
[1:49:21] to know it's what I am I love it people
[1:49:23] don't like to come to church I like to
[1:49:25] come to church I like to worship God

[1:49:30] the worship the God of all a creation
[1:49:34] be who you are don't tell impersonate

[1:50:28] guess we're preaching this morning

[1:57:35] Angel come down from heaven having a
[1:57:36] great power
[1:57:37] and the Earth was lightened with his
[1:57:39] glory
[1:57:40] now I want you to understand brother
[1:57:41] Brandon was reading this in the God of
[1:57:43] this evil age and he's going to explain
[1:57:44] and identify this here
[1:57:47] all right and he cried mightily with his
[1:57:49] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[1:57:52] Fallen is fallen and it's become the
[1:57:54] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:57:56] every foul spirit
[1:57:58] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:58:01] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[1:58:04] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[1:58:07] the kings of the Earth have committed
[1:58:08] fornication with her remember just like
[1:58:10] Eve did
[1:58:12] let me know she committed fornications
[1:58:16] and the merchants of the Earth
[1:58:18] without wax Rich study abundance of her
[1:58:21] Delicacies

[1:58:24] another place where Amen to Rome and
[1:58:26] Catholicism has all the gold of the
[1:58:28] world the Jews have the bonds amen
[1:58:30] you'll realize that that all of that
[1:58:32] riches all of your money everything it
[1:58:34] all goes back to the Antichrist he goes
[1:58:36] back to that church
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:40] but the marches at wax Rich they all got
[1:58:43] drunk on the wine of the wrath of her
[1:58:45] fornication
[1:58:48] I want to read another one if I could
[1:58:51] revelation 17.
[1:58:53] and there came one of the Seven Angels
[1:58:56] which had the seven vials and talked
[1:58:57] with me seeing unto me come hither and I
[1:59:00] will show you the Judgment of the great
[1:59:02] that sitteth upon Mighty Waters

[1:59:09] not the Merit married or that Harlot
[1:59:12] that washed Jesus's feet and become
[1:59:14] clean isn't that right
[1:59:16] because she'd become a lady but this
[1:59:18] woman God still acknowledges her sir as
[1:59:21] a great
[1:59:23] oh my
[1:59:25] how many of those we could have never
[1:59:26] understood this if it would have been
[1:59:27] from Malachi 4.
[1:59:29] who this great was
[1:59:31] sinneth upon the many Waters with whom
[1:59:33] the kings of the Earth have committed
[1:59:34] fornication
[1:59:36] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[1:59:38] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:59:40] fornication
[1:59:41] look out there how many knows everybody
[1:59:43] out there they're all drunk
[1:59:46] with fornication

[1:59:53] oh my
[1:59:55] and the inhabitants of the Earth have
[1:59:57] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:59:59] fornication and he carried me away in
[2:00:01] the spirit and Wilderness I saw a woman
[2:00:02] sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of
[2:00:04] names of blasphemy
[2:00:06] amen
[2:00:09] having seven heads and ten horns and the

[2:01:24] Harlot the Bible calls them
[2:01:27] claiming to be married to Christ running
[2:01:29] around shorts but the man says you know
[2:01:31] shorts are a woman's undergarment
[2:01:34] and she said that the man she got so
[2:01:36] much
[2:01:37] attention then she got her Adam she got
[2:01:39] her man to put him on he put them on so
[2:01:41] he'd get abducted he says he belongs to
[2:01:43] the big sister Society but sexy Society
[2:01:49] it's an Abomination for man to put on a
[2:01:51] woman in pertains to a woman's
[2:01:53] undergarment
[2:01:54] and it's an Abomination for a woman to
[2:01:56] wear that we should change some man
[2:01:59] but they say it's okay
[2:02:01] she can even preach
[2:02:03] come up in them pants and preach with

[2:02:11] hello
[2:02:13] yes
[2:02:15] oh my but let me tell you something
[2:02:18] denominations some cold form of them
[2:02:19] they're not the ones they're gonna
[2:02:20] deceive you or try
[2:02:22] this
[2:02:24] is
[2:02:25] you let me before is this I've got the
[2:02:28] quote somewhere no I didn't I didn't
[2:02:29] actually print it out but the BAM says
[2:02:31] you know we're not going to be these
[2:02:32] cold former churches that deceived the
[2:02:34] bride I mean or even come close to me
[2:02:35] but it's that which is right up they're
[2:02:38] close beside it I believe it's right
[2:02:40] within the ranks of the message people
[2:02:42] anointed not everything else you know
[2:02:44] but if it's not according to the word
[2:02:45] you
[2:02:47] remember it's Antichrist
[2:02:56] right up there close you better be
[2:02:58] careful
[2:03:01] oh my how we have gone off
[2:03:04] amen
[2:03:06] now notice that's right mother of
[2:03:08] harlots and Abominations of the earth
[2:03:09] and I saw the woman drunk him with the
[2:03:11] blood of the martyrs and with the blood
[2:03:12] of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw
[2:03:14] her I wondered with great admiration
[2:03:17] amen and if you'll notice
[2:03:20] that was the mother
[2:03:23] but in verse chapter 18 and now now let
[2:03:26] me go back I know the spread of
[2:03:28] abandoned reads this
[2:03:30] Reach This in Revelations 18
[2:03:34] and verse 2
[2:03:37] and he goes through verse 5 but I'm
[2:03:38] going to read two again and he cried
[2:03:39] mightily with a strong boy saying
[2:03:42] Babylon the great is Fallen he's fallen
[2:03:44] to become the habitation of that devils
[2:03:46] and the whole of every foul spirit
[2:03:49] all right
[2:03:52] now notice
[2:03:54] but about him he says now
[2:03:56] what a warning but after saying that
[2:03:58] come out of her my people that should be
[2:04:00] not particulars ever since every you
[2:04:02] receive not to replace
[2:04:04] that told the church exactly into
[2:04:06] Revelations 3 14 to laodice
[2:04:09] Lawless real religious but lawlessness
[2:04:13] because thou says I am rich and increase
[2:04:15] with goods and have me of nothing
[2:04:19] huh
[2:04:21] no it's not that they were wretched and
[2:04:23] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[2:04:25] how many notes God did not have one good
[2:04:28] thing to say about the layout of their
[2:04:30] Church
[2:04:32] every other say other churches he says
[2:04:35] but this thou has thou hat is the Deeds
[2:04:37] of the Nickelodeon this that I have
[2:04:39] strengthened what you have inside of the
[2:04:40] other but in the last one he said I
[2:04:42] stand at the door I have been put out of
[2:04:45] my own shirt I'm standing at the door
[2:04:48] I'm knocking I ain't even in the church
[2:04:51] anymore I'm outside knocking on men's
[2:04:53] Hearts here come out of her
[2:04:57] the only thing he can do is get you out
[2:04:59] of there
[2:05:01] I'm gonna try to be called out
[2:05:04] come out of here my people
[2:05:07] come out of that leonis here come out of
[2:05:09] that lukewarm you are lukewarm and have
[2:05:11] needed nothing and what did he sound
[2:05:13] young thing he did to that lukewarm just

[2:05:17] laughs
[2:05:20] are you lukewarm this morning
[2:05:23] if you are you'll probably be left
[2:05:25] behind
[2:05:30] God wants you
[2:05:32] what
[2:05:33] are cold
[2:05:35] get on one side or the other
[2:05:37] I mean that's the good thing about the
[2:05:39] Scriptures it can identify Who You Are
[2:05:42] just identify Who You Are
[2:05:44] what does Troy say look in that mirror
[2:05:51] I don't know
[2:05:52] I guess that's the Holy Ghost
[2:05:54] stomp
[2:05:58] gotta do something
[2:06:01] whistle blow it out somewhere gotta
[2:06:03] vents on it there's too much pressure
[2:06:05] there too much fire burning Predator
[2:06:07] coming
[2:06:08] one right
[2:06:11] I ain't gonna say smoke I'm gonna say
[2:06:13] I'm calling steam which one I'm not
[2:06:15] steaming a little
[2:06:18] hey man you love the Lord
[2:06:21] folks I'd answer prayer last night I had
[2:06:24] nothing I says I don't know which way

[2:06:41] the message has come to me a lot easier
[2:06:42] than they used to I don't know why other
[2:06:43] than perhaps it's getting later
[2:06:46] God is trying to talk to us
[2:06:48] God is trying to talk to people out
[2:06:50] there streaming
[2:06:51] then if you're a lukewarm you better get

[2:07:23] you better be better than everybody else
[2:07:25] that's foolish virgin and The Sinner you
[2:07:28] better have to fire the holy ghost in
[2:07:29] your heart you better have God's life in
[2:07:31] your heart
[2:07:32] just as good as anybody else but that's
[2:07:34] not saying much is it

[2:07:54] to Revelation 3 and 14 the laodicea age
[2:07:57] they thought they had need of nothing
[2:08:00] the Bible said you know I said the queen
[2:08:03] amen
[2:08:04] and
[2:08:05] shall
[2:08:06] see no sorrow
[2:08:10] this is this your church with nothing
[2:08:13] less than the Pentecostals
[2:08:21] and the Pentecostals when they begin to
[2:08:23] leave the word it wasn't but a few
[2:08:25] different few short term to the Sun a 10
[2:08:27] year amen that drifted further than what
[2:08:29] the Catholic said
[2:08:31] whew
[2:08:33] let me tell you something drifting from
[2:08:35] God is a slippery slope
[2:08:39] you go rapidly
[2:08:41] hold on God
[2:08:43] that is use your relationship amen with
[2:08:45] almighty God and see how bad see how far

[2:08:49] your family it'll destroy your children
[2:08:52] he'll take you as far as he can possibly
[2:08:54] go take you
[2:08:55] the only hope you have is to be a child
[2:08:57] of God and God grab a hold of your
[2:08:58] backside and grab you and straighten you
[2:09:00] up

[2:13:03] left
[2:13:06] [Applause]
[2:13:08] there's still some left there's a
[2:13:11] Remnant left there's any lack left
[2:13:16] I still have joyous speak all and full
[2:13:18] of Glory that love God
[2:13:21] the fire's still burning
[2:13:24] when he got when God takes that out
[2:13:28] how many knows you are the blood of
[2:13:30] Christ
[2:13:31] the blood of Christ isn't us that's like
[2:13:34] keep it in from destroying if there's
[2:13:36] ten left I'm only shot three left I want
[2:13:38] this one one left I won't destroy it God
[2:13:40] is going to destroy the righteous with
[2:13:42] the wicked as long as we're here there's
[2:13:45] Ace
[2:13:47] can we say something to the world out
[2:13:49] there to the devil let's say this to the
[2:13:51] devil go ahead and push us out

[2:14:02] us out and see what happens God will
[2:14:06] destroy you
[2:14:07] 'll burn you burn you Constable fire
[2:14:10] they'll be whipping and wailing and
[2:14:12] gnashing of teeth
[2:14:13] because they're bundling right now
[2:14:16] angels are bundling them together for
[2:14:18] the burning
[2:14:24] but he's written ready to gather the
[2:14:27] wheat
[2:14:28] into the garden
[2:14:30] come on y'all don't get up so quick
[2:14:35] he's Gathering he's gonna gather the
[2:14:37] week that's right
[2:14:39] into the gardener we're about ready to
[2:14:41] go
[2:14:44] you and I have went through trials after
[2:14:46] trials after trials we've seen
[2:14:47] everything there is to be seen
[2:14:50] we've been hurt we've hurt each other
[2:14:52] and everything else in the book but it's
[2:14:53] time to put all wounds in the past it's
[2:14:55] time to put all sins in the past I mean
[2:14:57] have perfect love like I want you to
[2:14:59] have
[2:15:00] time to be a mature question
[2:15:02] I didn't go through all of that Tommy to
[2:15:04] be immature
[2:15:11] to be undone
[2:15:13] to be halfway finished
[2:15:16] to be halfway
[2:15:18] I mean says he says that God don't do
[2:15:20] halfway Christians
[2:15:23] no but people can't be halfway
[2:15:25] Christians can't be halfway why I taught
[2:15:27] you this enough that you should be able
[2:15:28] to answer me back why are people halfway
[2:15:33] and the correct answer is because the
[2:15:35] people have allowed their own ways to
[2:15:37] get in the way
[2:15:39] it's because of their own ways that are
[2:15:41] still mixed up
[2:15:42] in the plan of God
[2:15:44] that's why people are halfway
[2:15:46] but if I don't say nothing else to every
[2:15:48] one of us it's a checkpoint for us have
[2:15:50] you still got your some of your ways
[2:15:54] dependent plan of God and that's why
[2:15:56] you're still not seriously mature
[2:15:58] you're not the kind of fiery Christian
[2:16:00] that you ought to be because you still
[2:16:02] have some of your own ways
[2:16:06] speed limit too much
[2:16:08] I still do a little distance out of the
[2:16:10] other then I should come on folks you'll
[2:16:12] be honest you you know there's still
[2:16:15] things that you do
[2:16:17] we're not there yet Paul said I haven't
[2:16:19] arrived there yet but I press
[2:16:20] encountered it because he got that Mark
[2:16:25] Glory
[2:16:27] I don't want no part of her feel
[2:16:29] ings of fornication I don't want no part
[2:16:31] of her rich rich and increase with goods

[2:16:53] let God have his way in your life I need
[2:16:55] more
[2:16:56] perfect case I need more of the token
[2:17:00] hey man God Ephesians let me just go on

[2:17:05] church and then it's what she's supposed
[2:17:06] to be he gave us prophets and pastors
[2:17:08] and teachers for the perfecting of the
[2:17:10] Saints for the edifying of the body of
[2:17:11] Christ until we come to the fullness of
[2:17:13] the stature of Jesus Christ that you be
[2:17:15] no more children that's costume and
[2:17:17] throw heads for it
[2:17:19] but you maybe grow up in him it's all
[2:17:22] things and become the fullness of him
[2:17:24] that filleth all
[2:17:27] the kind of God who got the kind of
[2:17:28] church he's looking for
[2:17:32] that's what he's coming for
[2:17:34] let's talk about the bride for a minute
[2:17:36] that all right

[2:17:43] the perfecting of the Saints
[2:17:50] you love him
[2:17:51] Peter said it this way
[2:17:53] for this they are willingly ignorant of
[2:17:55] that by the word of God the heavens were
[2:17:56] of old and you're standing out of the
[2:17:58] water and in the water whereby the world
[2:18:00] that was then being overflowed with
[2:18:02] water perish but the heavens and the
[2:18:04] Earth which are now by the same word are
[2:18:06] kept in store reserved unto fire
[2:18:10] foreign

[2:18:17] the world or every one of us we could
[2:18:19] just get it in our hearts that heavens
[2:18:21] and earth shall pass away
[2:18:23] but there's one thing that will never
[2:18:25] pass away
[2:18:26] and that is God's word
[2:18:28] and you have to be part of that God's
[2:18:31] word you have to be identified on the
[2:18:33] right side and if you're identified on
[2:18:35] the right side you ought to run the odds
[2:18:38] you want to jump scream and holler to
[2:18:40] know that you're not on the left side
[2:18:41] but you're on the right side
[2:18:43] you're part of that word heavens and
[2:18:46] there's a part of the word what God said
[2:18:47] he's gonna do is Gonna Come to pass it's
[2:18:50] gonna happen if he said he's gonna have
[2:18:52] a spot in that blessed behind that's
[2:18:54] right
[2:18:55] husband love your eyes as your own self
[2:18:59] even as Christ loved the church that he
[2:19:01] might sanctify and die for it they might
[2:19:03] signify it and watch it by the watching
[2:19:04] of The Wanted by the word and you and I
[2:19:06] are being washed by The Wonder of the

[2:21:52] noise the elements should melt with firm
[2:21:53] and heat there's also in the work that
[2:21:55] therein shall be burned up
[2:21:58] saying that he seen them that all these
[2:22:01] things shall be dissolved what man or
[2:22:02] persons ought ye to be in a holy
[2:22:04] conversation and godliness looking for

[2:22:20] dissolved but not you and I we're not
[2:22:23] being these off Sinners I'll be
[2:22:25] dissolved sickness will be dissolved sin
[2:22:27] and those that do iniquity be bundled
[2:22:29] and burned in that fire billions and
[2:22:32] billions of other rapses are being
[2:22:33] deceived by the Antichrist
[2:22:36] and they're all pile
[2:22:39] being piled up and bundled up for the
[2:22:41] burning

[2:22:48] nevertheless
[2:22:50] somebody said nevertheless
[2:22:53] nevertheless we
[2:22:56] according to his promise look for a new
[2:22:59] heavens and a new Earth our Focus isn't
[2:23:03] on resolving all of this but our focus
[2:23:05] is on the new heavens and the newer
[2:23:09] where in dweller's righteousness there
[2:23:13] ain't gonna be none of this pollution
[2:23:14] there ain't gonna be nothing this
[2:23:15] hypocrisy none of this whoremongering
[2:23:17] fornication world that we're living in
[2:23:19] spiritual adultery not taking the word
[2:23:22] of God taking man's ideas taking man's
[2:23:24] Creeds taking schools of theology by the
[2:23:26] band set over the Vindicated and proven
[2:23:29] word of the God has punched his whole
[2:23:31] human race into death that's why they
[2:23:33] are where they are it's because they
[2:23:34] would not have the Vindicated word like
[2:23:36] Jesus was when he was here to rule over
[2:23:38] them we don't want them ruling over us
[2:23:42] anybody going to their meetings will
[2:23:43] excommunicate Pentecostals even though
[2:23:45] Jesus would come down and vindicate
[2:23:47] himself like never before let me tell
[2:23:49] you something when Jesus Christ would
[2:23:50] come down and do what he did when he was
[2:23:52] here on Earth discern the thoughts
[2:23:54] intents and heart nobody can do that
[2:23:56] only God can do that he proved himself
[2:23:58] and then everything he preached was
[2:23:59] right according to the word for people
[2:24:00] that believe that sent their souls to
[2:24:02] hell
[2:24:08] brother Byler
[2:24:10] I want a scripture for that
[2:24:16] with all deceivableness and
[2:24:18] unrighteousness them in them that perish
[2:24:20] because they receive not the love of the
[2:24:23] truth that they might be saved
[2:24:25] for this God's cause God shall
[2:24:27] strengthen them strongly illusions that
[2:24:29] they shall believe a lie and that they
[2:24:31] all might be damned to believe not the
[2:24:34] truth
[2:24:35] but have pleasure in unrighteousness
[2:24:38] hello
[2:24:40] you won't accept the truth there's only
[2:24:41] one way that you can go that's to accept
[2:24:43] the devil's lie the church world did it
[2:24:48] let me tell you something you can sit in
[2:24:50] those pews and the truth be told you
[2:24:52] and you can reject it
[2:24:55] according to the scriptures when you
[2:24:56] come into the message and then you turn
[2:24:58] on and turn on it you come to God and
[2:25:00] then turn on he says there's no more
[2:25:01] forgiveness for that kind of sin
[2:25:05] blasphemy amen
[2:25:08] Lord help us to believe every word every
[2:25:11] job every teller
[2:25:13] Hallelujah
[2:25:16] my
[2:25:17] world's heading to a climax
[2:25:21] let me go on
[2:25:22] has God lost control or is he just
[2:25:25] permitting another agency to control I
[2:25:26] wonder the true answer this question is
[2:25:28] to my opinion there's only two opposing
[2:25:30] spirits in the world today at work
[2:25:32] there can't be no more than two just two
[2:25:34] two heads the one of them is the holy
[2:25:36] spirit work and the other one is the
[2:25:38] spirit of the devil and in the last days
[2:25:40] of deception
[2:25:42] now I'm going to base my thoughts right
[2:25:43] on there for my text remember that's he
[2:25:45] went right back to Genesis I mean the
[2:25:47] very same line that he told the Eve is
[2:25:48] what he told to the church world
[2:25:50] huh you don't have to believe that
[2:25:53] I know Christ comes and vindicates it
[2:25:55] and he does Miracles and signs and he
[2:25:57] deserves up but you ain't got to believe
[2:25:59] what he preaches
[2:26:00] it's the word of God you better believe
[2:26:02] what he preaches
[2:26:04] and it was the word of God but they
[2:26:05] chose rather brother Bob said amen to
[2:26:08] believe man's theology that he had
[2:26:10] learned from some doctor of divinity in
[2:26:12] some Bible School that said the days of
[2:26:13] Miracle says this and the other and when
[2:26:15] they took that they damned themselves
[2:26:18] and they became the instrument by the
[2:26:19] band said they became the instrument the
[2:26:21] devil wanted to use and it is exalted
[2:26:23] the devil to the place that he wanted to
[2:26:24] be from the very start before the world
[2:26:26] ever begun
[2:26:27] when he kicked out of heaven he had a
[2:26:29] division that he had amen and it is to
[2:26:31] be exalted about the word of God right
[2:26:33] then Genesis he said Thou shalt not sure
[2:26:35] that I he wouldn't think oh my
[2:26:38] in Thessalonians there notice he opposes
[2:26:41] and exalted himself above all that is
[2:26:43] called the god or that is worship so
[2:26:45] that he has God's sinners in the temple
[2:26:47] God showing himself that he is God but
[2:26:49] the man says because of that amen
[2:26:51] millions and billions of people that's a
[2:26:53] big mouthful are worshiping God and
[2:26:55] don't know it not God the devil
[2:27:00] their God
[2:27:02] millions of people worshiping the devil
[2:27:05] and don't know it
[2:27:09] Jesus just didn't come and do this
[2:27:15] do all that he did
[2:27:17] so that people could say well I don't
[2:27:18] really need it
[2:27:20] no it discerned decided to Eternal
[2:27:23] destination but Abraham said one place
[2:27:24] he says people are now making their
[2:27:26] choice
[2:27:27] people on the Earth are now making their
[2:27:29] choice
[2:27:30] remember it was Mr best I believe it was
[2:27:32] that was wanting to debate with brother
[2:27:33] banham and he wouldn't and then or
[2:27:35] another Minister uh debated him and so
[2:27:38] forth and the the
[2:27:40] who was it
[2:27:42] remember what who the minister was that
[2:27:44] debated Mr best
[2:27:47] brother Bosworth
[2:27:49] you know I think it might have been
[2:27:50] Brothers he says I'll take him and he
[2:27:52] asked Mr best one question he said I
[2:27:54] want to ask you one question did the
[2:27:56] seven compound Redemptive names of
[2:27:58] Jehovah apply to Jesus
[2:28:01] because he was saying there is no more
[2:28:03] healing and so forth and so forth you
[2:28:04] know and and Mr best couldn't answer the
[2:28:07] first question
[2:28:10] isn't that right so finally at the end
[2:28:12] of it he couldn't even answer and he got
[2:28:14] up there and he says I challenge anybody
[2:28:15] to prove you know that you have been
[2:28:18] genuinely healed and the whole punch
[2:28:19] raised up
[2:28:21] he just shut him up
[2:28:22] that had been healed and so forth you
[2:28:24] know on this side of the other and he
[2:28:25] got all irate Amen in the head but about
[2:28:27] him did come off the angel said go out
[2:28:29] in the closing prayer he come up and
[2:28:31] close in prayer and Mr Ben had his
[2:28:33] photographers come up in his fingers and
[2:28:34] point the fingers and different things
[2:28:36] like that you know because he was going
[2:28:37] to make it look like he was a great one
[2:28:39] and then this is the only photograph
[2:28:41] that was developed the only one that
[2:28:42] ever came out was the one with the
[2:28:44] pillar of fire over his head
[2:28:50] that was not man that was Christ doing
[2:28:52] it that was almighty God doing it your
[2:28:55] attitude towards that man I'll tell you
[2:28:57] what people have had a bad attitude
[2:28:59] towards that and dropped dead and died
[2:29:00] in other words have believed and got
[2:29:02] healed just by believing the picture
[2:29:05] why because that's living that's God's
[2:29:07] testimony
[2:29:09] it was a terrible thing for the church
[2:29:11] world to reject Christ in this hour
[2:29:14] he said they have exalted the devil to
[2:29:17] the place anymore now you watch this no
[2:29:19] wonder he could call it lewd crew
[2:29:20] deceivableness filth and everything else
[2:29:23] you watch cold Core Go Plum to the core

[2:29:49] for Christ he's doing it by vindicating
[2:29:52] his Word of Promise to her for this age
[2:29:55] how many believe that oh one place he
[2:29:58] said because of the Vindication because
[2:29:59] of what Christ is doing that's what
[2:30:01] gives the bride rapturing faith to know
[2:30:04] that that's not just me it's not my
[2:30:06] homie fact I already got my minute I'm

[2:30:59] what's brought me to it is listen he's
[2:31:01] doing it by vindicating his Word of
[2:31:02] Promise to her for this age showing that
[2:31:05] it is Christ if the finger's supposed to
[2:31:08] move in this age the finger will move if
[2:31:10] the first supposed to move the foot will
[2:31:13] move into this age if the eye is

[2:31:33] about being in the age of the seals
[2:31:34] let me let me just read it to you here

[2:31:41] if the eyes see the spirit of God it's
[2:31:44] growed into the full stature of God the
[2:31:49] age that we're now living in the Holy
[2:31:51] Spirit is here indicating the message of
[2:31:53] the hour the Holy Spirit here is doing
[2:31:55] this so that the people that believe God
[2:31:57] will be called out of this chaos

[2:32:24] calling his church by the error
[2:32:27] that simple little air of believing the
[2:32:30] devil's lie
[2:32:31] he's calling his church as usual by
[2:32:34] perversion of the word of God like he
[2:32:36] did at the beginning see it coming right
[2:32:39] back again to that sea time again from
[2:32:41] Eden here it is again
[2:32:45] Eden was
[2:32:47] brought the whole human race into a
[2:32:49] fallen condition by disbelieving one
[2:32:52] word prophet of God well Jesus said when
[2:32:54] he was here man shall not live by bread
[2:32:56] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[2:32:59] out of the mouth of God
[2:33:02] I don't hurt me to do this uh
[2:33:05] bye off the hill you go
[2:33:08] it does if it's contrary to the word
[2:33:10] your soul brother bam said is hanging
[2:33:13] over Hell by every word
[2:33:15] you just leave one word off and you're
[2:33:17] gone
[2:33:20] just one word just just leave one word
[2:33:23] look at all the doors they disbelieved
[2:33:25] they won't even believe their own eyes
[2:33:28] I'm going to discernment Goes Forth and
[2:33:30] Jesus comes out and brother Brahm says
[2:33:31] I'm just your brother
[2:33:33] if you love me don't say I'm a great
[2:33:35] prophet or this Reverend Branham or this
[2:33:37] he didn't even ask for you to call him
[2:33:39] Reverend
[2:33:40] you just said call me brother
[2:33:44] but I'm waiting on who him
[2:33:47] and if you think you can do a better job
[2:33:49] and you want to be critical of this you
[2:33:51] come up here and then you do this
[2:33:54] remember that because he knew that
[2:33:56] they probably fall dead over quicker
[2:33:58] than God was going to vindicate them
[2:34:00] because he was they weren't there
[2:34:01] whenever brother Bannon was seven years
[2:34:03] old and the angel come in that tree and
[2:34:04] said don't drink or smoke or defy your
[2:34:06] body and forth for you I have a work for
[2:34:08] you when you get older
[2:34:10] ah that was God saying that
[2:34:14] by the time I look forward to the day of
[2:34:16] judgment
[2:34:17] all these doubters all these Apes will
[2:34:20] be played back God's going to show him
[2:34:22] yeah that was me doing that yeah that
[2:34:24] was me showing that you didn't believe
[2:34:25] this you didn't believe that you didn't
[2:34:26] believe that
[2:34:29] huh you won't believe the iPhone you
[2:34:31] couldn't believe your own eyes the
[2:34:33] prophet of God said man these people
[2:34:34] amen they're they're seeing they know
[2:34:36] the sun is shining but they're going in
[2:34:38] the basement closing up all the windows
[2:34:40] and they're saying The Sun Ain't Shining
[2:34:43] he said that's how blind they are
[2:34:45] that's how terrible The Human Condition
[2:34:47] was
[2:34:48] they're trying to say it ain't so rich
[2:34:50] absolutely so
[2:34:52] that's the patheticness of human beings
[2:34:54] folks and blindness of the devil
[2:35:02] amen
[2:35:04] praise the Lord
[2:35:05] if the Antichrist in the beginning there
[2:35:08] in its infancy infancy of Disobedience
[2:35:11] remember all of this happens in the
[2:35:13] children of Disobedience people don't
[2:35:15] want to do what God tells them to do
[2:35:17] so now they give it over to a a delusion
[2:35:24] how can I just stop for a minute can you
[2:35:25] imagine that
[2:35:27] a person hears the truth and says oh
[2:35:30] wow yeah
[2:35:33] but I don't want to believe that because
[2:35:34] my church don't teach that
[2:35:36] all right
[2:35:37] and then God goes in that man's mind or
[2:35:40] that woman's mind and he twists it
[2:35:42] to where he says no I don't really
[2:35:43] believe that he actually changes their
[2:35:45] minds the Bible says he sends gives him
[2:35:47] strong delusion that they would believe
[2:35:49] and lie
[2:35:51] okay you don't want to believe the truth
[2:35:52] I'm gonna live I'm gonna make you I'm
[2:35:54] gonna make you believe a lie and be
[2:35:56] damned by it

[2:36:10] think they're right I mean those
[2:36:12] Pentecostals no church World they
[2:36:13] thought it was right to have the women
[2:36:14] up here in pants and just cut hair and
[2:36:16] make up and everything else and preached
[2:36:17] in the gospel
[2:36:21] who did the methodists have back there
