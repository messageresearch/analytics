[17:30] gorgeous
[17:36] Brother Brad will open us a prayer this
[17:39] morning
[17:44] [Music]
[18:12] is
[18:23] also asked if there's
[18:26] an
[18:27] honesty Ministry
[18:33] appreciation
[18:40] amen the children can be dismissed for
[18:43] Sunday School
[18:44] and it will go in the Psalms
[18:49] we're still in Psalms 119 we're gonna be
[18:53] reading from
[18:54] verse 81.
[19:02] star in verse 81 and we'll read over to
[19:05] verse 96.
[19:09] my soul Finance for thy salvation but I
[19:12] hope in Thy Word
[19:15] though
[19:18] friend become like a bottle in the Smoke
[19:21] yet do I not forget thy statutes
[19:25] thank you
[19:31] proud have dig pits for me which are not
[19:34] after thy law
[19:42] they had almost consumed me upon Earth
[19:44] but I forsook not thy precepts
[19:54] forever O Lord Thy word is settled in
[19:57] heaven
[20:05] to continue this day according to thine
[20:07] ordinances for all or thy servants
[20:17] I will never forget thy precepts for
[20:20] with them thou has quickened me
[20:28] the wicked have waited for me to destroy
[20:30] me but I will consider thy testimonies
[20:34] I have seen an end of all priests
[20:36] friction but thy commandment is
[20:38] exceedingly Broad
[20:40] God bless you maybe see you brother
[20:42] Brian
[20:52] brothers and sisters
[20:55] one of those verses there his
[20:57] faithfulness is on to all generations
[20:59] and I'm sure we all believe that we're
[21:03] here this morning because of that if you
[21:05] would come with me to
[21:07] 2nd Thessalonians
[21:10] the third chapter
[21:12] I was
[21:15] meditating just thinking I was thinking
[21:17] there this morning I wrote down that
[21:20] I'm not to be funny brother Brian
[21:22] preached the message
[21:24] modern events made clear by prophecy and
[21:27] as we come to this uh day you know 2023
[21:32] the 24th of September
[21:36] as I find my place here
[21:40] who would ever thought I just wrote a
[21:42] note to myself where in our country in
[21:46] our world that we're in we're in the
[21:48] midst of a new Pagan age that we live in
[21:50] this morning everything outside of this
[21:52] church this morning outside the Jesus
[21:54] Christ is a pagan age it's just the way
[21:57] it is I mean you tell your friends that
[22:00] you mingle with in the world but they're
[22:01] living in a pagan age they probably
[22:03] laugh at you but it's the truth and I
[22:07] was thinking this morning
[22:08] you know we
[22:10] we live in a country that's totally off
[22:14] the precepts that it was founded on and
[22:17] I was just thinking it's just a horrible
[22:19] place that we are but it's a blessed
[22:22] place too because as the world gets
[22:24] worse you know you get closer I mean
[22:27] it's not comforting the world that we're
[22:28] living it's such a pagan world that
[22:31] we're living I I wouldn't even talk
[22:32] about the things behind the pulpit that
[22:35] they do out there in the world today
[22:36] thinking that they're right and there's
[22:38] nothing wrong with it you know and 20
[22:41] years ago or 15 years ago when they made
[22:45] homosexuality marriage legal you know
[22:48] that was a horrible thing back then for
[22:50] the world but look at what they're doing
[22:52] today it only gets worse it never gets
[22:54] better and I was thinking this morning
[22:56] I don't know if you all know but let me
[22:59] read the first finally brethrough and
[23:01] pray for us that the word of the Lord
[23:04] May 5 free course and be glorified even
[23:07] as it with you and we may be delivered
[23:10] from unreasonable and wicked men for all
[23:14] men have not faith and that's the age
[23:16] that we live in this morning this the
[23:18] last two chapters in first Thessalonians
[23:20] talk about the all the evil and Paul's
[23:23] age I know I say this a lot but it's
[23:25] true the very paganism that Paul was
[23:28] dealing with in Corinth and all the
[23:30] Greek states that he went to or whether
[23:33] it was in their states above Israel
[23:37] where I mean the things that they were
[23:39] doing then people out in the world are
[23:41] doing today they're I mean it's just a
[23:44] pagan age and he goes on to say here but
[23:46] the Lord is faithful who shall establish
[23:49] you and keep you from evil so it's not
[23:52] us that keep ourselves from Evil it's
[23:54] your relationship with Jesus Christ this
[23:56] morning and applying the word of God on
[23:59] yourself and your family that'll you
[24:02] can't do it in yourself you have to have
[24:04] Christ or you'll not be able to resist
[24:07] this evil age without Christ you won't
[24:09] be able to put away the things of this
[24:11] world and he goes on to say we have
[24:14] confidence in the Lord touching you that
[24:15] you both do and will do the things which
[24:18] we command you
[24:19] and that fourth scripture there speaks
[24:22] Paul gave us Commandments Paul the truth
[24:25] and we have to fulfill the truth as he
[24:28] gives us we all have a message of the
[24:30] hour now
[24:32] I only know if I live up to it and only
[24:34] you know if you live up to it but you
[24:36] can't be deceived you know whether
[24:38] you're living up to it and again I just
[24:40] said it earlier you can't do it in
[24:42] yourself you can only do it through
[24:44] Jesus Christ this morning and the Lord
[24:47] direct your hearts into the love of God
[24:49] and into the patient waiting for Christ
[24:52] and now we command you brethren in the
[24:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you
[24:57] withdraw yourself from every brother
[24:58] that walketh
[25:00] just overly and not at the Traditions
[25:03] which received of us but you know you
[25:07] could isolate that scripture there and
[25:08] you go further down Paul was saying that
[25:11] you need to watch who you fellowship
[25:13] with you need to watch who you commune
[25:15] with but later on I mean down at the end
[25:17] of the job three he gives some guidance
[25:20] too for yourself to know how we ought to
[25:22] follow us for we behave not ourselves
[25:25] disorderly among you
[25:27] you know it's totally opposite today
[25:30] than in the age that we're living
[25:33] you know Paul didn't owe no one anything
[25:36] after the flesh but the world we live in
[25:38] is looking for someone to provide for
[25:40] him without them working this morning
[25:42] but he goes on to say here Dean did we
[25:46] eat any man's bread for not brought with
[25:48] labor and Terrell night and day that we
[25:51] not might not be chargeable to any of
[25:54] you that's contrary to the welfare state
[25:57] that we live in this morning not because
[25:59] we have not power to make ourselves an
[26:02] example unto you to follow us
[26:04] or even when we were with you this we
[26:07] commanded to you that if any would not
[26:10] work neither should he uh
[26:12] for we hear that there are some I'm
[26:14] walking among you disorderly working not
[26:17] at all but are busy buddies that's the
[26:19] world we live in this morning everyone's
[26:22] trying to sell someone else how to live
[26:24] but they don't want to live the way
[26:25] they're telling people how to live now
[26:28] then
[26:29] then we shall excuse my pronunciation
[26:32] now then them that are such we command
[26:35] the exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that
[26:37] which quietness they work and eat with
[26:40] their own bread
[26:41] but you Brethren be not worrying well
[26:43] going and
[26:44] that scripture means a lot to me no
[26:47] matter how much you help people how much
[26:49] you try to encourage people how much you
[26:52] try to live for your brothers and
[26:53] sisters you can't let their bad behavior
[26:56] affect your relationship with Jesus
[26:58] Christ your enemies don't sell purpose
[27:01] this morning is to make you look at
[27:03] other people and see their faults so you
[27:06] can justify your own bad behavior
[27:08] everything that's exactly what he's
[27:10] trying to do he's you can only be
[27:12] responsible for yourself you know when
[27:14] you're doing wrong when you're doing
[27:16] right and you're only responsible for
[27:18] your actions but it doesn't mean because
[27:20] people are biting the hand that feeds
[27:22] them that you don't keep doing the right
[27:25] thing because it's the right thing to do
[27:27] and I lost my place but
[27:29] be not weary and well doing
[27:32] I almost I don't know why I just bit my
[27:34] tongue If any man obey not your words by
[27:37] this epistle know that man and have no
[27:40] company with them that he may be ashamed
[27:42] you know a lot of men tonight and honest
[27:44] churches use that scripture this morning
[27:46] yet account him as not an enemy but
[27:50] admonish him as a brother and then you
[27:52] cannot like I said you can take a word
[27:54] of God and isolate it and and make
[27:57] something out of it that it's not saying
[27:59] it as a brother now the Lord of Peace
[28:01] himself give you peace Always by all
[28:03] means the Lord be with you the
[28:06] salutation of all with my own hand which
[28:09] is spoken to every epistle so I write
[28:12] and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:14] be with you all amen and I I was just
[28:18] thinking this morning I don't
[28:20] the government we live in this morning
[28:22] is not a government that really likes
[28:24] people that are True Believers and true
[28:26] Christians this morning because the
[28:28] government we have this morning there's
[28:30] things that that you and I know that if
[28:32] you work I don't I'm self-employed so I
[28:35] can believe the things I want to believe
[28:37] and say the things I want to say and
[28:39] people can choose whether to use me or
[28:41] not to use me that's their right as a as
[28:44] an American but if if you're a person
[28:47] working for a company that's got a
[28:49] thousand employees you know where I'm
[28:51] going there's things you can and cannot
[28:54] say on the job this morning in the
[28:56] United States of America and have a job
[28:58] tomorrow you all know that you have to
[29:00] be careful about what you say but I was
[29:03] just thinking it didn't take too long
[29:05] for us to get here it's only been 10 or
[29:07] 15 years where we've got to where we're
[29:09] at this morning
[29:10] so it just lets me know as a Christian
[29:12] this morning you know people say there's
[29:15] a lot I I I'm 64 years old I heard
[29:19] people when I was in my 20s saying the
[29:21] Lord is coming he'll be here tomorrow
[29:23] does it does it mean that we don't live
[29:25] that way of course not we live each day
[29:28] knowing that the law could be here
[29:29] tomorrow but you realize that as you get
[29:33] to my age you realize the things that I
[29:36] thought were important when I was in the
[29:38] my 20s are not so important now that I'm
[29:40] in my 60s everyone has a life Journey
[29:43] they've taken but the only thing that
[29:45] matters as I got older I realized is my
[29:49] relationship of Jesus Christ this
[29:51] morning and the world that we live in
[29:53] this morning it's sole purpose this
[29:55] morning is to fill your mind and life
[29:58] with everything that takes you off of
[30:00] the word of God this morning and I can
[30:02] only speak for myself I I'll I'll admit
[30:04] myself no one was around me on Friday
[30:07] and I was working at this egg house and
[30:10] and you know if you're not careful
[30:12] you'll find yourself getting angry get
[30:15] mad for I I only can speak for myself
[30:18] getting mad for no reason at all and I
[30:21] go and he went back to my mind went back
[30:23] to Proverbs where it says if two walk
[30:25] together there's Comfort there's
[30:27] Security in that because if one falls
[30:30] into the ditch who's going to lift him
[30:32] up and I was thinking you know a second
[30:34] set of hands would be nice with what I'm
[30:37] doing this morning and it's everything
[30:39] in life we need to have a better
[30:41] perspective and I you know I lost my
[30:43] temper and I shouldn't lose my temper
[30:45] like I said before when you're yelling
[30:47] at a piece of Steel it isn't going to
[30:49] help you to yell at a piece of steel or
[30:51] get angry at a piece of Steel because it
[30:53] ain't going to help you but it what will
[30:55] help you is if you just stay quiet in
[30:58] your spirit and let God help you this
[31:00] morning and I find myself as I get older
[31:02] I realize
[31:04] I need to take that extra minute that
[31:07] extra second or that extra hour to think
[31:09] about something before I do it because
[31:11] that you'll find yourself doing things
[31:13] and saying things that you shouldn't say
[31:15] and as you get to the age that we're in
[31:18] this morning
[31:19] it's important that the only thing that
[31:21] we want to project the people out in the
[31:24] world is what Christ is to us what they
[31:26] see his experience in our hearts and
[31:29] lives this morning brother Dave
[31:32] thank you
[31:36] amen he loved the Lord this morning
[31:40] you love him this morning
[31:42] amen you know I was thinking of brother
[31:44] Brian honest confession is good for the
[31:46] soul and I work for myself and one day I
[31:49] fired myself three times I got so
[31:51] frustrated with this guy
[31:53] but you know what there's one thing I
[31:55] learned
[31:56] a few years ago
[31:59] that if I just sit down
[32:01] and I'd say Lord
[32:03] I need you right now
[32:06] and I begin to learn it took me a while
[32:09] believe me a long time as I began to
[32:13] learn to just stop
[32:14] just sit down and just pray
[32:18] I said Lord I need you I know I'm in a
[32:20] hurry and I need to get this done but
[32:22] Lord I Need You Now
[32:24] because I don't I don't want someone to
[32:27] see me acting that way even though it's
[32:29] just me and that car that's being
[32:31] stubborn
[32:32] but I want I want the Lord Jesus to be
[32:35] happy with me I wanted to be pleased
[32:37] with me this morning don't you and we
[32:39] send that little course pleasing to you
[32:41] let me be pleasing to you in everything

[45:29] you've been gone quite a bit here lately
[45:31] and made a couple trips to Arkansas and
[45:34] the first time I went to my daughters
[45:37] and
[45:38] and my son-in-law he's they go to a a
[45:42] big church and
[45:44] and he asked me if
[45:47] we'd been washing my Tahoe and I had a
[45:49] picture of the cloud on the back of my
[45:53] Tahoe and my son-in-law asked me he said
[45:56] dad what is that
[45:58] and I told him what had happened and
[46:00] explained to him what it was and he said
[46:02] who's that picture up there in y'all's
[46:04] church I said that's brother Branham in
[46:06] the pillar of Fire
[46:07] now we're getting to explain to him and
[46:09] I said you know when I went to you with
[46:11] you that night when we were on vacation
[46:13] I went to your men's meeting thing with
[46:15] your neighbor to talk about Malachi
[46:17] four and six
[46:19] he said yeah I said well he's five
[46:22] that came to do what they were trying to
[46:24] say that they were supposed to do
[46:26] he goes really and I said yeah he said
[46:28] so that's why there are so many
[46:30] denominations I said I said yes
[46:33] and so we go to church and I said that's
[46:36] why God had to send a prophet and I've
[46:38] been to this church two or three times
[46:40] and
[46:41] the first time I went there I watched
[46:43] Frozen
[46:44] and I wasn't very impressed and Janet
[46:47] asked me they came into church drinking
[46:49] coffee with their hats on and shorts and
[46:52] all kind of nonsense and I thought
[46:55] she said you think we'll get a crime
[46:57] this morning and
[46:58] tears was coming down her eyes and I
[47:00] said babe I don't know

[47:08] there that morning he wasn't the cool
[47:10] preacher that always preaches
[47:12] and this other guy comes out and they
[47:15] got this big screen and it pops up and
[47:18] guess what it says Jonah

[47:22] interesting
[47:23] and he begins to talk about God's sin
[47:25] and they
[47:26] Prophet to Jonah I said yes Lord a
[47:31] prophet and I told Tim I said see what I
[47:34] was talking about he began to tell if
[47:37] Nineveh didn't repent
[47:38] what was going to happen then and I've
[47:41] been there many times and they've never
[47:43] even said the first word about doing
[47:45] anything wrong this guy got down and
[47:47] stepped on everybody's toes
[47:50] and I said Lord
[47:52] told Jan I said we got a good loaf this
[47:54] morning
[47:55] because that same kind of witness to my
[47:57] son-in-law about the message and what
[47:59] God's done in this generation and then
[48:01] we go to his church
[48:03] and then his preacher talks about God
[48:05] sending the prophet and I and I said I'm
[48:08] trying to encourage you to listen to
[48:11] some of the tapes and just pray for Tim
[48:13] and he never knew nothing about church
[48:16] and uh

[1:05:23] I've been under the weather all week and

[1:05:27] I've got to preach Sunday and I feel
[1:05:29] better this morning it's the little
[1:05:31] things it's the big things it's all the
[1:05:33] things that he does for us and sometimes
[1:05:35] I I speak for me but I don't think I
[1:05:38] give him enough praise I don't think I
[1:05:41] thank him enough I don't think I get

[1:06:08] praise God Amen
[1:06:10] thank Jesus to get your Bibles we'll go

[1:06:14] appreciate the musicians the song
[1:06:16] service all the parts of the service
[1:06:19] amen God is truly good to us and y'all
[1:06:23] pray for me and we'll get through it
[1:06:25] this morning and we'll just turn it over
[1:06:27] to him and let him have control this
[1:06:29] morning and I'm still classified myself
[1:06:33] as a young man but I've come to figure
[1:06:35] out that I can't do it without him
[1:06:38] I sit back there in the back room and I
[1:06:40] just sit back there and pray and said
[1:06:42] God it's your time now and it isn't my
[1:06:45] time this is just a vessel that you've
[1:06:47] chosen it's your time now
[1:06:49] John chapter 3 I believe I preached a
[1:06:52] part of this uh probably back first of
[1:06:55] the year I want to try to continue on
[1:06:57] maybe you a little bit but conditions of
[1:07:00] Fellowship one will be part two this
[1:07:02] morning but in John chapter 3 verse 17
[1:07:05] right after for God so loved the word
[1:07:07] again he's only begotten son then Jesus
[1:07:09] goes on and he says for God sent not his
[1:07:12] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:07:15] but through the world that he might be
[1:07:17] saved that they might be saved he didn't
[1:07:20] believeth in him is not condemned but he
[1:07:22] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:07:25] because he has not believed in the name
[1:07:28] of the only begotten son of God and this
[1:07:31] is the condemnation that the light has
[1:07:33] come into the world and the men love
[1:07:35] Darkness rather than light
[1:07:37] because their deeds were evil and for
[1:07:40] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:07:42] light and neither cometh to the light
[1:07:45] lest his deeds should be reproved but he
[1:07:48] that doeth truth cometh to the light and
[1:07:52] his deeds may be made manifest that they
[1:07:54] are walked in God and I thought of that
[1:07:57] this morning as brother Brian was
[1:07:59] portraying would lay upon his heart and
[1:08:02] the evil age that we live in as we know
[1:08:04] brother Brennan would call it Satan's
[1:08:06] Eden as Satan is in control of it and
[1:08:09] they have denied the light for their day
[1:08:11] they have denied the word for their day
[1:08:13] and they've looked into the Antichrist
[1:08:16] they've looked under the corruption
[1:08:17] they've looked into all the world but
[1:08:19] but God said there's a group of people
[1:08:21] and that group of people is looking at
[1:08:24] the light and they're looking at the
[1:08:26] word and in the ten virgins in 1960 we
[1:08:28] existing we can have our seats but he
[1:08:30] says for the word of God is sharper or
[1:08:32] more powerful than any two-edged sword
[1:08:35] cutting even to asunder the bone and the
[1:08:37] desert of the thoughts of the intents of
[1:08:39] the mind he says oh there you are there
[1:08:42] you are he says when you see the light
[1:08:44] walk in it he said walk he says you
[1:08:48] don't know where you're going but keep
[1:08:50] walking walking towards Calvary looks at
[1:08:53] he's keeping a sensible look at Calvary
[1:08:55] walking walking he said oh God May
[1:08:59] someday the church which is the type of
[1:09:01] Enoch 500 years he walked before God
[1:09:04] walking Walking In The Light what a
[1:09:07] testimony that he had everything that
[1:09:09] God had said everything that he had did
[1:09:11] he didn't displease them and when the
[1:09:14] Lord said and they not had done it he
[1:09:16] said now he was a type of member of the
[1:09:18] Ark is a type of the Jews the 144 000
[1:09:20] that carried over which is Noah and his
[1:09:23] much but Enoch went home just a little
[1:09:25] bit before the flood come on church he
[1:09:28] says you know that he said so he not
[1:09:30] just kept walking in the light and so
[1:09:32] one day he felt his feet getting off the
[1:09:35] ground and he just kept walking and he
[1:09:38] walked into the glory without even dying
[1:09:40] that's right God took him away because
[1:09:43] he was walking in the light with a
[1:09:45] testimony that he had walked in the
[1:09:48] light of God just keep walking this
[1:09:50] morning amen Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:09:53] love you this morning Lord Lord we truly
[1:09:55] appreciate you Lord when we don't have
[1:09:58] words to explain what you mean to us and
[1:10:00] what you've done for us but Lord we love
[1:10:03] you with everything that we are and we
[1:10:05] ask you Lord to come on the scene this
[1:10:07] morning Lord we ask you to move man
[1:10:09] aside to myself aside the hearing side
[1:10:12] and you step into our presence Lord and
[1:10:14] you speak from your lips and let us hear
[1:10:17] with your ears that we may be drawn
[1:10:19] closer to you in the day that we're
[1:10:21] living Lord we love you Lord we thank
[1:10:23] you for all these things in your lovely
[1:10:26] name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen
[1:10:28] and you can be seated this morning and I
[1:10:31] appreciate whether Tom inviting us out
[1:10:33] it's uh it's uh
[1:10:35] truly we say it and we say it again but
[1:10:38] it's a home away from home we always
[1:10:39] love being up here and getting to know
[1:10:42] each and every one of you much more than
[1:10:44] we have and we make friendships and we
[1:10:47] make fellowship and one day we won't
[1:10:49] have to depart one day we're going to go
[1:10:51] home and we're going to celebrate for
[1:10:53] eternity and we won't have to get up
[1:10:55] Monday morning and go to work and we
[1:10:57] won't have to pay the bills and we won't
[1:10:59] have to worry about all that because God
[1:11:00] will be there forever with us and this
[1:11:03] morning is returned us the part two
[1:11:06] maybe of this condition is a fellowship
[1:11:08] of walking in the light and and I begin
[1:11:10] to you know look at it I begin to think
[1:11:12] in a in a dying generation in a dying
[1:11:14] world that's what's missing in our lives
[1:11:16] anymore is no one wants to stay
[1:11:19] concentrated to the word of God and
[1:11:20] everybody wants their own interpretation
[1:11:23] and everybody wants their own idea and
[1:11:25] everybody wants the new thing to come
[1:11:28] along everybody wants a new anointing
[1:11:30] the new spirit the new the new precious
[1:11:32] come along but we realize there's
[1:11:34] nothing new in the word of God the word
[1:11:37] of God is the same as it was before the
[1:11:39] foundation of the world to today to the
[1:11:41] end it's the same word that is guiding
[1:11:43] us here that it's going to guide us home
[1:11:45] and and when we're looking for a place
[1:11:47] that we can refuge in the word of God
[1:11:50] and the only way to do that is in the
[1:11:53] light of your day it is in the light of
[1:11:55] your day in the fellowship of your day
[1:11:57] it doesn't do any good to do what the
[1:11:59] old churches did it doesn't do any good
[1:12:01] to go build an ark that Noah would build
[1:12:03] that's looking in the word and looking
[1:12:05] in the light of your day that today's
[1:12:07] messenger brought us a word that there's
[1:12:10] a Rapture that is coming for a bride and
[1:12:12] to prepare for that Rapture is to get
[1:12:15] yourself ready and dress yourself with
[1:12:18] the word of God and and it's so easy in
[1:12:20] our times this we would listen to The
[1:12:22] Prophet preach time and time again that
[1:12:24] we would look that the world wants us to
[1:12:27] take a step back come on the world wants
[1:12:30] us to take a step back and start okaying
[1:12:33] everything that we've already shown that
[1:12:35] is wrong and we know the scripts you
[1:12:37] would say as a dog would be turned to
[1:12:39] his moment this nation as a dog has
[1:12:42] returned to her vomit she come out of
[1:12:44] that she come out of British school she
[1:12:47] come out of all of the organizers that
[1:12:49] britons had and raised upon the freedom
[1:12:53] of religion started a country but now
[1:12:56] she's going back to that to dictating
[1:12:58] what the people can do and what they
[1:13:01] can't do and this isn't political but
[1:13:03] this is a religious move in the country
[1:13:06] that is taking the rights of Christians
[1:13:08] away she has a dog that has returned
[1:13:10] back to her Obama and the enemy is
[1:13:13] trying to get you to do the same thing
[1:13:15] you realize through influence we're
[1:13:18] living in the day of influence we're
[1:13:20] living in the day of influences that and
[1:13:22] through influence they get you to do
[1:13:25] what they want you to do you realize
[1:13:27] people making millions of dollars
[1:13:29] influence you and what decisions to make
[1:13:31] they actually just call them influencers
[1:13:34] and that's all they do is kicked our
[1:13:36] videos and Facebook videos and Instagram
[1:13:38] videos to influence you to eat a certain
[1:13:42] food one of them the other day I saw she
[1:13:44] was getting paid one point something
[1:13:46] million dollars to eat a Burger King
[1:13:48] sandwich on camera come on Church
[1:13:50] they're trying to influence you but it's
[1:13:53] the evil one it's the anointing of this
[1:13:55] age it's Satan's eating trying to get
[1:13:58] you to walk outside the light of your
[1:14:00] day it's trying to get you it's not
[1:14:03] happy with a bride that is moving
[1:14:05] forward in the word of God it's not
[1:14:07] happy the enemy's not happy with you
[1:14:09] coming to church every time the church
[1:14:11] doors are open come on Judge he's not
[1:14:14] happy with you coming to church every
[1:14:16] time them doors are open they want to
[1:14:18] give you every excuse you have to miss
[1:14:20] church come on Judge come on I know this
[1:14:24] is going to be real this morning but
[1:14:26] y'all bear with me the enemy is
[1:14:28] attacking each and every one of us he
[1:14:30] said
[1:14:33] he's attacking us with their fellowship
[1:14:35] with one another come on Church come on
[1:14:39] look I know the scripture tells you to
[1:14:42] be aware of who you fellowship with
[1:14:43] brother Brian told us that this morning
[1:14:44] was looking in the scripture that's the
[1:14:46] scripture but yet our Prophet would also
[1:14:48] come and say there's a balance to that
[1:14:50] that if you draw yourself out of my
[1:14:52] circle I want to draw my circle Banger
[1:14:54] come on church we got people that
[1:14:56] believes the message of the Earth with
[1:14:58] churches five miles down the road that
[1:15:00] won't fellowship with one another look
[1:15:02] they could get off of their doctors I
[1:15:04] don't have to agree with all of the
[1:15:06] doctor that we need to be able to walk
[1:15:08] in the light of her day look I'll just
[1:15:10] tell you this is a as I come across this
[1:15:12] this week sometime in the church
[1:15:15] it's preaching in the message of course
[1:15:17] but the church ain't but written out and
[1:15:19] he makes these words he says God's love
[1:15:21] he says he's put you on God's love he
[1:15:23] states that the love of God has to have
[1:15:26] a family that he could share it with but
[1:15:29] what I'm saying is the love of God God
[1:15:31] wanted somebody to share that love with
[1:15:33] he wanted somebody to share that
[1:15:35] fellowship with he wanted somebody to
[1:15:37] share that Union with that he could be
[1:15:41] happy that he can Rejoice with that he
[1:15:43] can have Victory men that he can go over
[1:15:45] there have fish with and he says even
[1:15:48] though he said love corrects and
[1:15:51] chastens but it always gives Fellowship
[1:15:54] a communion come on Church come on think
[1:15:58] of your home is your as you adult your
[1:16:00] parents you've raised your children
[1:16:01] there's times that your children's does
[1:16:03] wrong that your kids didn't grow and you
[1:16:06] have to collect them either by
[1:16:07] punishment either by discipline even my
[1:16:10] whooping maybe but yet love is still
[1:16:12] there to bring them back to the supper
[1:16:15] table and say but you're my son you're
[1:16:18] my daughter love is still fair to
[1:16:20] fellowship and walk in the light that
[1:16:22] even though I had to correct you even
[1:16:24] though I had to tell you that you was
[1:16:26] wrong I'm not pushing you out I'm
[1:16:28] bringing you back to where you can see
[1:16:30] the word for your day
[1:16:32] come on church if every time I got a
[1:16:35] whooping on my parents today to push me
[1:16:37] out I'd have been a bastard son living
[1:16:39] on the streets but yet every time that I
[1:16:41] got a whooping my daddy would grab me in
[1:16:43] his arms and he would tell me how much
[1:16:45] he loved me how much he cared for me oh
[1:16:47] heavenly father that's how he does you
[1:16:49] in high today even though we missed step
[1:16:51] and get out of place get out of line
[1:16:53] with the word of God God always brings
[1:16:56] us back to his wisdom he says but I love
[1:16:58] you son but I love you daughter and if
[1:17:01] he's doing that for me shouldn't we do
[1:17:03] it to others come on Church oh look a
[1:17:06] place of Fellowship to put our
[1:17:08] difference in the side to say you know
[1:17:10] what there's one true God look it's
[1:17:12] men's interpretation it means the
[1:17:15] termination that brought all the
[1:17:16] denominations upon her look we're just
[1:17:19] going to get ahead of myself a little
[1:17:20] bit but let's just move on in John 8
[1:17:22] verse 12. he said this fake Jesus again
[1:17:25] unto them saying I am the light of the
[1:17:27] world and he that followeth me shall not
[1:17:30] walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:17:33] light of life
[1:17:35] in John chapter 12 verse 35 it says that
[1:17:38] Jesus said unto them yet there's a light
[1:17:41] with you and while he says wow he'd have
[1:17:44] light let Darkness come upon you that he
[1:17:47] walketh in darkness knoweth not whether
[1:17:49] he goes he said oh wow ye have light
[1:17:53] believe in that light that ye may be the
[1:17:57] children of light and these things speak
[1:17:59] to Jesus and departed and hid himself
[1:18:01] from them look first one and seven he
[1:18:04] says now he said there was from the
[1:18:05] beginning that when he had heard and
[1:18:08] what he had seen with our eyes that we
[1:18:10] have looked upon and our hands have
[1:18:12] handled the word of life so the light
[1:18:15] was manifested come Church there it is
[1:18:18] it's Walking In The Fellowship of the
[1:18:21] light of your day it's in the
[1:18:22] manifestation of the light of your day
[1:18:24] it's when Jesus come upon the Earth and
[1:18:27] Jesus would walk to and through welcome
[1:18:29] to see it golly they didn't understand
[1:18:31] who he was but he would point back to
[1:18:34] word and he says look if you don't
[1:18:36] believe me believe for the works that I
[1:18:38] do because the work's true who I am
[1:18:41] genital God that's what we're living
[1:18:43] today is in the manifestation of the
[1:18:46] voice of the seventh angel we're not
[1:18:48] living in a day that he was alive we're
[1:18:50] not living in the day that the ministry
[1:18:52] was going forward we're not living in
[1:18:54] the day that other brother said is good
[1:18:56] enough but we're living in the day of
[1:18:58] the manifestation of what that Prophet
[1:19:01] said that Prophet said there would be a
[1:19:04] pride that Prophet said that would be
[1:19:06] you and I that said that we
[1:19:08] would go into a Rapture we're living in
[1:19:10] that day now
[1:19:12] who are living in the manifestation time
[1:19:14] we're living in the fellowship of
[1:19:16] walking in the lifetime of not just
[1:19:19] seeing the word of God not just being
[1:19:20] able to read the word of God look
[1:19:22] technology has got it to the place that
[1:19:24] we have it on every device that we have
[1:19:26] I can look at my watch and I can read it
[1:19:29] quote I can look at my phone my iPad
[1:19:31] every document out there every time I
[1:19:33] can have it all accessible but has it
[1:19:36] become real to me has it become a
[1:19:38] manifestation to the world around me
[1:19:41] that it's more than just a written word
[1:19:44] Malachi four five and sixes John oh John
[1:19:47] and knock out three but 24 John four
[1:19:49] check back and forth it's whatever
[1:19:51] brother randoms quote whatever his
[1:19:53] scripture was for him to come and turn
[1:19:56] the hearts back to the fathers look
[1:19:58] that's already been fulfilled we're not
[1:20:00] living in the day of Malachi 4 we're
[1:20:03] living in the day of the Bride that the
[1:20:05] bride is living amongst us today that
[1:20:07] she's walking in the light of her name
[1:20:10] what is it is for the light that he was
[1:20:12] manifested for we have seated and bear
[1:20:14] witness to show you
[1:20:16] eternal life which was a father it was
[1:20:19] manifested in us for which we have seen
[1:20:21] and heard we declare that you that you
[1:20:24] also
[1:20:25] may have fellowship with us and truly
[1:20:28] our fellowship is with the father and
[1:20:30] with the son Jesus Christ and these
[1:20:33] things ain't right into you that your
[1:20:35] joy may be for church
[1:20:38] y'all know I'm simple but I don't
[1:20:40] understand why message Believers are sad
[1:20:42] come on Church
[1:20:44] come on church we need to run an enemy
[1:20:46] away from us we need to run the enemy of
[1:20:49] depression away from us it's real I'm
[1:20:51] not trying to throw off on it it's a
[1:20:52] real enemy but we need to run the
[1:20:54] depression away we need to run the enemy
[1:20:57] of anxiety away we need to run the enemy
[1:21:00] of bad attitudes away why because we
[1:21:02] realize who we are we're manifesting the
[1:21:05] word of God we're going into our passion
[1:21:07] we have everything promise to us there's
[1:21:10] nothing to fear
[1:21:12] there's nothing fears of the devil fear
[1:21:15] is trying to keep you from getting what
[1:21:17] is rightfully yours God has already
[1:21:19] given it his word is already pronounced
[1:21:21] it to you he's already told you in this
[1:21:24] day these signs when we manifested he
[1:21:26] said in this day even greater signs of
[1:21:29] the days that I would nobody do what
[1:21:31] that is your day that is the day that
[1:21:33] we're living in it is the condition of
[1:21:35] who we're living now it's to get behind
[1:21:37] the word of God it's I want to manifest
[1:21:39] that word I want to manifest the word
[1:21:42] through my day I want to be an example
[1:21:44] for the word for my day I want to be a
[1:21:47] leader for you Lord I want to be a
[1:21:49] general I want to be a soldier I want to
[1:21:52] be whatever you want me to be God
[1:21:55] he said oh and he said these things
[1:21:56] right unto you that your joy before
[1:21:59] see there's something about having
[1:22:01] friendship that makes you happy Come On
[1:22:03] Church
[1:22:04] come on
[1:22:06] you know I've been blessed and had a lot
[1:22:09] of good friends over my life and there's
[1:22:11] something about getting around good
[1:22:12] friends it puts a smile on your face
[1:22:15] come on Church you know I'm right you
[1:22:17] get around a good friend you can't wait
[1:22:19] to see him again he can't wait to get on
[1:22:22] the ball court and play ball with him
[1:22:23] again you can't wait to go hunting with
[1:22:25] them again you think right just sit
[1:22:27] there and watch your ball again whatever
[1:22:28] it is that you do there's something in
[1:22:31] you Desiring that fellowship and that
[1:22:34] friendship and you'll want to grow so
[1:22:36] that friendship goes the harder it is to
[1:22:39] leave that person if you don't visit and
[1:22:41] we wouldn't visit some friends a few
[1:22:43] weeks back and and when it got time to
[1:22:45] go home it gets quiet and bummer because
[1:22:48] you don't want to leave you just create
[1:22:50] a pond there that you want to be the
[1:22:52] dear God I want to create that bond with
[1:22:55] my heavenly father I want to create that
[1:22:57] body that I never want to leave this
[1:22:59] place that I never want to leave working
[1:23:01] for him that I would rather be Sunday in
[1:23:04] church than it work any day in the
[1:23:08] than doing something for me I'd rather
[1:23:11] be moving for him than doing something
[1:23:13] for somebody else
[1:23:15] I want to create
[1:23:17] that Fellowship
[1:23:19] and that friendship
[1:23:21] and you know what when you create it
[1:23:23] you're happy in doing it
[1:23:25] say for too many years too many people
[1:23:27] said on message views and they did it
[1:23:29] they did it in denial they did it just
[1:23:33] because mama said her daddy said come on
[1:23:35] Church
[1:23:36] they come to churches because the daddy
[1:23:37] was the pastor come on or the mama was
[1:23:40] the other Mama sung in the church choir
[1:23:42] or the day was taken or whatever it was
[1:23:45] and they come to church to make a good
[1:23:47] look but there was nothing nothing
[1:23:48] inside that it created fellowship with
[1:23:51] God and you could tell because you know
[1:23:54] as they come of age you could tell their
[1:23:56] actions and their conduct changed of who
[1:23:58] they was they wasn't that same happy
[1:24:00] person that was always sad there was
[1:24:02] always mad they was always upset but yet
[1:24:05] if they could get a fellowship with God
[1:24:07] like their parents did it changes the
[1:24:10] Outlook of the outside and you can tell
[1:24:12] something's changed
[1:24:15] he said and these things aren't in you
[1:24:16] that you're doing amazing for he said
[1:24:18] and then this is the message which we
[1:24:19] have heard of him and declaring to you
[1:24:22] that God is light and in him there's no
[1:24:25] Darkness at all if we say we have
[1:24:27] fellowship with him and walking Darkness
[1:24:29] we lie and we do not the truth but if we
[1:24:34] walk in the light as he isn't alive we
[1:24:36] have Fellowship one with another and the
[1:24:38] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:24:41] us
[1:24:42] Trump oh
[1:24:45] come on Church
[1:24:47] so there's so many wonderful things
[1:24:49] about giving our lives to God there's so
[1:24:52] many things that we need to praise him
[1:24:53] more for
[1:24:54] no church it's the little things that we
[1:24:57] Overlook in light in this Fellowship in
[1:24:59] this walk with God that we're so blessed
[1:25:01] about you know I told somebody the other
[1:25:04] day they was talking to me and they said
[1:25:05] you know you know you don't never seem
[1:25:07] to have car trouble well that's not
[1:25:09] always true I do but you know what if I
[1:25:11] have car trouble it's not the end of the
[1:25:13] life
[1:25:13] I thought the end of the day because I
[1:25:16] know my God is greater than my car
[1:25:18] don't judge I went to Indiana a couple
[1:25:20] months ago and we stopped to get
[1:25:22] something to eat and got back in the car
[1:25:24] and it was completely dead
[1:25:25] battery go
[1:25:28] the plane it's a seven eight Euro
[1:25:29] battery it did it's time but it wouldn't
[1:25:32] even turn the dash lights on if you know
[1:25:34] anything about cars just leaking is all
[1:25:36] electronic so you can put a car in and
[1:25:38] keep trying you push the button and wait
[1:25:40] for it it wouldn't do nothing
[1:25:42] I walked into KFC that's where we got
[1:25:45] through eating and I walked up into KFC
[1:25:47] and I look around there's two people in
[1:25:48] there eating and they're mid bite
[1:25:50] it in my mind the first thing I thought
[1:25:52] is the worst thing I hate being bothered
[1:25:54] is when I'm eating
[1:25:57] I got the truck open I got the hood open
[1:26:00] cable's out I just need somebody to let
[1:26:02] me borrow the car but I feel bad about
[1:26:04] asking these people that are eating and
[1:26:06] as soon as I heard that thought I'd
[1:26:08] heard that little still Small Voice why
[1:26:10] are you asking them for help when you
[1:26:12] have me
[1:26:14] oh God forgive me
[1:26:16] God forgive me I turn and walk
[1:26:20] back out and I walked out to the car and
[1:26:22] I laid the hand on the battery and I
[1:26:24] said Lord if you let it crank one time
[1:26:26] I'll stop at the next Parts come and put
[1:26:28] a battery in I got in hit the button it
[1:26:30] fired out to Life come on Church my God
[1:26:33] is greater than my car
[1:26:37] now I will tell you the next part store
[1:26:39] I saw I pulled in
[1:26:42] because I believe sometimes if we had
[1:26:44] specific things we better watch what we
[1:26:46] asked for
[1:26:47] but I pulled into the parts store and I
[1:26:49] turn it off and it wouldn't turn the
[1:26:50] dome light on
[1:26:51] completely dead I put a battery in it we
[1:26:53] made it to church God moved in a
[1:26:56] miraculous way it doesn't matter when
[1:26:58] you're walking in the Fellowship of the
[1:27:00] lord we shouldn't let these things
[1:27:02] change our attitudes come on Church
[1:27:04] we're going a little different direction
[1:27:06] somebody's pulling come on we shouldn't
[1:27:10] let circumstances in life we can let
[1:27:12] sicknesses in life we shouldn't set car
[1:27:15] trouble house trouble if I'm in trouble
[1:27:17] we shouldn't let that change who we are
[1:27:19] because we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:22] fellowshipping with the Eternal one
[1:27:24] tele-shipping with that promise of a
[1:27:26] Rapture that is coming in our life it's
[1:27:29] greater than anything that can happen
[1:27:30] here it's greater than any circumstance
[1:27:32] here it's greater than any trial it's
[1:27:35] greater than anything that can happen to
[1:27:37] us here
[1:27:39] has more plans than we can see come on
[1:27:43] Church Our God has more ability for us
[1:27:46] than we're willing to accept you know so
[1:27:49] many times we don't get what we have
[1:27:50] need of because we don't want to bother
[1:27:52] God wants to be bothered by you
[1:27:55] because it ain't a bother to him God
[1:27:58] cares for you God loves you God wants
[1:28:00] your fellowship God loves you so much he
[1:28:03] left his son on the cross so that you
[1:28:06] could be saved and you could be in each
[1:28:08] Fellowship all he's asking for all these
[1:28:11] things hiring it's you to turn to him
[1:28:13] it's like can I have some fellowship
[1:28:16] can I have a word today can I look look
[1:28:20] I'm not super spiritual just as human as
[1:28:22] human can be but I find myself asking
[1:28:24] more and more under my breath oh God
[1:28:27] help me come on Church
[1:28:30] oh God help me I said in an interview
[1:28:32] the other day at my job interviewing a
[1:28:35] guy for a pet for a mechanic position
[1:28:37] and I was on the fence of which way to
[1:28:39] go and under my breath I said God help
[1:28:41] me
[1:28:42] help me to say the right thing help me
[1:28:45] to ask the right thing help me to make
[1:28:47] the right decision because I can't do it
[1:28:50] without you and God you've done proven
[1:28:52] to me that's right here and you're
[1:28:55] waiting on me to fellowship with you
[1:28:57] you're reading your way to step into the
[1:29:00] light of your day to the light of your
[1:29:02] word and ask you to come into my
[1:29:04] presence
[1:29:06] ask you
[1:29:07] but we're living in a day now
[1:29:10] that everybody wants to turn around what
[1:29:12] is God there could only be more
[1:29:14] hypocrisy today than we ever have we're
[1:29:16] living in more a worldliness than we've
[1:29:19] ever had we're living in that Center of
[1:29:21] Satan's hidden but yet God has a bride
[1:29:24] and he has a bride that is choosing to
[1:29:27] walk in his life remember when brother
[1:29:28] Branham he threw the 70s he drew the
[1:29:30] seven churches up here and he began to
[1:29:33] fill them in and then this one is all
[1:29:35] dark you know they ought to see it and
[1:29:36] brother Brennan would make the statement
[1:29:38] when the Angels showed him it was some
[1:29:40] blacked out and there was no in this day
[1:29:43] he said but I left a little bit in there
[1:29:45] for the bride's sake I left a little bit
[1:29:48] in there for your sake why because as
[1:29:50] long as you're here the holy spirit is
[1:29:52] still here but we're living in Satan's
[1:29:54] Egypt where everybody has chosen to
[1:29:57] follow Darkness instead of falling to
[1:29:59] light everybody has chosen to follow the
[1:30:02] Antichrist to follow the world to follow
[1:30:04] men's ideals and men's Creed other than
[1:30:06] just follow the anointing of the Holy
[1:30:08] Spirit
[1:30:09] come on Church how did the day of
[1:30:11] Pentecost happen because men got
[1:30:14] together in fellowship and said but
[1:30:17] Jesus said this would happen we're going
[1:30:19] to go pray until it happens we're not
[1:30:22] worried about what the world says about
[1:30:24] it we're not worried about what the
[1:30:26] critics call us we're not worried about
[1:30:28] what denominations in churches around
[1:30:30] the land we heard what Jesus said and
[1:30:33] Jesus said I'm gonna leave but I will
[1:30:36] not leave the comforters I will send the
[1:30:38] Holy Spirit back to you and they said
[1:30:40] we're going to get it and they come
[1:30:42] together in fellowship and they begin to
[1:30:45] believe upon one Accord that the spirit
[1:30:47] of Christ the spirit of God would come
[1:30:50] back and what did it do it manifested
[1:30:53] exactly what the word City would do it
[1:30:56] come forth in power and demonstration in
[1:30:59] the form of the Holy Spirit holding in
[1:31:00] the upper room and anointed them in such
[1:31:03] a way they knew there was something
[1:31:05] different about them
[1:31:06] come on children
[1:31:08] what about you and I for living in a day
[1:31:12] that is darked out
[1:31:14] or living in L.A that there's no light
[1:31:16] left will it be in the lane that you
[1:31:18] know what it stand for what's right
[1:31:19] you're going to be condemned you're
[1:31:22] gonna be hated you stand against
[1:31:23] homosexuality you're going to have your
[1:31:25] name plotted out come on Church you
[1:31:28] stand for the truth of the word you're
[1:31:30] going to be criticized you're going to
[1:31:32] be bullied you're going to be pushed
[1:31:34] aside but yet God is looking very bad
[1:31:36] let's willing to forsake everything that
[1:31:39] they have and say I'll follow that word
[1:31:41] I'll follow what you have for me
[1:31:46] 1964 moving on
[1:31:48] 1964 recognizing your day in this
[1:31:51] message he said as the prophets Abode
[1:31:53] we're set to vindicate the promise word
[1:31:56] for that day so that the people
[1:31:58] protested it in the day they saw it he
[1:32:01] said don't like the woman of the world
[1:32:03] what did she saw let's remember what
[1:32:05] another we know scripture we know the
[1:32:07] stories she's at the well when Jesus
[1:32:09] walks in a presence they begin to have a
[1:32:12] conversation Jesus begins to tell if you
[1:32:14] knew who I was you now you wouldn't ask
[1:32:17] because I give you water come on what
[1:32:20] did he say she says I heard of these
[1:32:23] things come on he had heard the prophecy
[1:32:26] being spoken she had heard that there
[1:32:28] was a messiah coming but now she was
[1:32:30] living in the light of her day she was
[1:32:33] living in the fellowship of her faith
[1:32:35] and now she was recognizing this is that
[1:32:38] Prophet being fulfilled and it is it me
[1:32:41] come on church it's going to take a
[1:32:44] place that the pride Universal around
[1:32:46] the world her eyes are going to come
[1:32:48] open and she's going to see there's more
[1:32:51] to this than a man by the name of
[1:32:52] William random that part of this than
[1:32:55] the message him in her but there's a
[1:32:56] pride that's upon the sea that is
[1:32:58] manifesting what he said it's going to
[1:33:00] happen
[1:33:10] he was the word and the production
[1:33:14] he says oh he says if I do the works of
[1:33:17] that father I promise I would do he said
[1:33:19] then believe me not but if I do the
[1:33:21] works too
[1:33:22] don't he said that to you don't believe
[1:33:24] me believe them Works he said oh they
[1:33:28] tell you who I am he said you get it all
[1:33:30] right don't miss the day he said men and
[1:33:33] women and other days recognize it and
[1:33:36] they went in and they were saved
[1:33:38] see she recognized that the well
[1:33:41] Delight for her day
[1:33:43] she stood there that day and she had the
[1:33:45] opportunity
[1:33:47] to either recognize the light standing
[1:33:49] amongst her or deny it and walk back
[1:33:51] into darkness
[1:33:52] she was standing at a place in her life
[1:33:55] that it was now for her to decide do I
[1:33:58] follow the light
[1:33:59] or do I turn back to the darkness
[1:34:02] don't judge you know the five you've had
[1:34:04] huh the one you're living with is not
[1:34:06] yours huh she's living in a day she's
[1:34:08] living in utter Darkness her life is in
[1:34:11] ruins every decision she's made has
[1:34:14] turned out bad but now she's sticking in
[1:34:17] the light of her name and she has a
[1:34:19] choice of what's the future of her life
[1:34:22] is going to be and what did it find she
[1:34:24] runs back to the city and said let me
[1:34:26] tell you about a man come on church she
[1:34:29] recognized the light for her day she
[1:34:32] manifested what that light would say to
[1:34:34] her and she became an example for others
[1:34:37] to come to Christ
[1:34:38] come on Church the Bible can't contain
[1:34:40] all of the Miracles that was written
[1:34:41] just because it wasn't written don't
[1:34:43] mean it didn't happen come on George
[1:34:46] look her life persuaded others to look
[1:34:49] to the light and then they had a
[1:34:51] decision to follow the light of Follow
[1:34:53] The Darkness but as children of God
[1:34:55] you're going to follow the light he said
[1:34:58] oh he says oh Pentecostals he says Oh my
[1:35:01] he says why don't you recognize your day
[1:35:04] come on Church
[1:35:06] he said better gosters he said recognize
[1:35:09] the day of the evening time it is here
[1:35:11] it is here but to vindicate the coming
[1:35:14] of Christ to vindicate it for in the end
[1:35:17] recognize your day come on church we
[1:35:20] need to recognize our day our day is
[1:35:22] more than the days another seventh
[1:35:24] Prophet Came Upon the scene but the day
[1:35:26] that we're living in is the day the
[1:35:28] pride and manifesting the world that
[1:35:30] there is a living God and it's not
[1:35:32] living in a prophet of old it's not
[1:35:34] living in Jesus of Hope but it's living
[1:35:36] in a bride today walking amongst the
[1:35:39] world is now living in you and it's
[1:35:42] interesting to the world who God really
[1:35:44] is
[1:35:46] it's more than just a story
[1:35:49] bone Church it's more than just a good
[1:35:51] story it's more than just a feeling look
[1:35:54] I ain't got nothing wrong with feelings
[1:35:56] we live in this flesh we need feelings
[1:35:58] we wake up in the morning we need
[1:36:00] feelings for our life
[1:36:01] sometimes it's good to have a little
[1:36:03] pain to make sure you're not bad
[1:36:05] come on Trish
[1:36:08] we need families but it's more than
[1:36:10] feelings
[1:36:12] feelings feel good and get us in the
[1:36:14] direction but it's more than a good time
[1:36:16] come on Church
[1:36:19] say here's where I get in trouble
[1:36:24] people always condemn me and tell me
[1:36:26] that I don't like youth meetings because
[1:36:28] I always are bashing them I'm not
[1:36:30] bashing you Finnish but come on Church
[1:36:32] you need more than just a youth meeting
[1:36:35] experience
[1:36:37] you need a backside of the desert
[1:36:39] experience come on Church
[1:36:42] what's the problem with most of our
[1:36:44] youth today is all they have is a youth
[1:36:46] meeting experience
[1:36:48] look there's nothing wrong with you
[1:36:49] maybe I take my kids there I take the
[1:36:52] youth there I help with them on I am all
[1:36:55] about getting them where the anointing
[1:36:57] is to get them to the light of their day
[1:36:59] but once they get to that life they've
[1:37:02] got to make a decision what they're
[1:37:04] going
[1:37:04] I'm Gonna Do With It come on Church
[1:37:08] the woman at the well she stood there
[1:37:10] and talked to Jesus the light of her day
[1:37:13] she stood there and agreed they got
[1:37:15] you're right you are that one
[1:37:18] and she was in a careers she was in
[1:37:20] Revival she was in testimony she was in
[1:37:23] rejoicing in his presence
[1:37:25] but when she turned and went back to the
[1:37:27] town then that's when trial come come on
[1:37:31] church that's when she had to make the
[1:37:33] decision am I still going to worship or
[1:37:36] am I going back to the way I was come on
[1:37:38] Church
[1:37:39] come on You See It come on Judge that's
[1:37:43] what we have to make a decision when we
[1:37:45] go to a meeting when we go to a youth
[1:37:47] and we get in the worship service and
[1:37:49] it's wonderful but you can't come sit on
[1:37:51] this view like it never happened come on
[1:37:53] if God did something for you we need to
[1:37:55] be able to worship Our God even throw
[1:37:58] our answer and say God I'm the same here
[1:38:00] that I was there you're the same one
[1:38:03] they saved me from that you're the one
[1:38:05] that's leading me from here
[1:38:11] you the people operate the gift
[1:38:14] come on Church
[1:38:15] come on Church so if you've been in
[1:38:18] Revival Services there's no reason that
[1:38:20] you should ever be in another dead
[1:38:22] come on Church
[1:38:24] because you operated that gift
[1:38:27] that was that Revival come on Church
[1:38:31] oh Lord help us

[1:38:37] you are the mouthpiece of God
[1:38:40] look we still need Ministries I'm going
[1:38:42] to preach against ministers you're not
[1:38:43] going to catch because the word of God
[1:38:45] said there's a powerful Ministry come on

[1:38:55] one look there's people don't see that

[1:39:51] never have a bad day don't get in your
[1:39:53] minds but I tried my best to look at it

[1:40:12] brother makes to come he says he said I
[1:40:14] love God so much that if he put me in
[1:40:16] hell I'd love him anyway I struggled
[1:40:19] with that for years but as years went by
[1:40:22] God began to reveal more and more to me
[1:40:24] I understand what he's saying because
[1:40:27] I'm in love with him so much there's
[1:40:30] nothing he can put me in that would
[1:40:31] create me not to love him even more now
[1:40:35] when a joke could sit on the Ashy and
[1:40:37] lose everything that he had and said but
[1:40:39] I love you Lord you're more to me than

[1:43:17] mine the pastor's a church in another
[1:43:18] state God told him to go to church and
[1:43:21] people would come
[1:43:22] he started a church and a senior citizen
[1:43:24] building you know what happened he has
[1:43:26] 40 45 35 40 people 90 of them didn't

[1:43:50] than you have been up because then he
[1:43:52] can trust you to bless others come on
[1:43:55] Church
[1:43:56] what is it it's time for a Rapture to go
[1:43:59] it's time for a bread to go thinking
[1:44:02] Genesis 24 when he speaks to Rebecca
[1:44:05] right and Abraham wanted a wife
[1:44:08] for his son
[1:44:10] Abraham decides he needs a wife for his
[1:44:12] son that he don't want one in the land
[1:44:13] that are living in he wants one from his
[1:44:15] homeland
[1:44:16] and he sends a prophet to get a bride
[1:44:19] call Church don't just look at the story
[1:44:21] look at what God's doing look at what
[1:44:23] God's thing
[1:44:25] look he sees a joke right down there and
[1:44:28] he says I want to send my son them
[1:44:30] that'll scouted out come on church so he
[1:44:33] sent a prophet to the land the message
[1:44:35] for that day for the light of that day
[1:44:38] that Prophet goes into that land looking
[1:44:41] for a bride look he wasn't looking for a
[1:44:44] bride for himself from church brother
[1:44:46] Brandon wasn't looking for a pride for
[1:44:48] himself he was looking for a pride for
[1:44:51] Jesus Christ he was looking for a pride
[1:44:54] of the god almighty but he was sent into
[1:44:56] the land with a word for the day the
[1:44:58] light for his day to seek out a bride
[1:45:00] and to call her out of the denominator
[1:45:03] to call her out of the church to set
[1:45:05] herself aside
[1:45:07] what happens the easier goes down there
[1:45:10] and he's looking for one and he comes
[1:45:12] across Rebecca Rebecca tracks as a
[1:45:14] teacher why because Rebecca was
[1:45:15] different
[1:45:16] come on Church
[1:45:17] come on he walked up to the well we back
[1:45:19] and started waiting on him why because
[1:45:21] Rebecca had been raised right
[1:45:23] so there ain't nothing wrong with being
[1:45:24] raised right young people when Mom and
[1:45:27] Daddy tells you what to do you need to
[1:45:28] leave what they do
[1:45:30] because it's going to pay dividends for
[1:45:32] you later in life come on Church there's
[1:45:35] a reason why the scripture says honor
[1:45:37] thy mother my mother and father there's
[1:45:39] a reason our scripture says raise them
[1:45:41] up in the right and they won't
[1:45:43] Department because there's a way that
[1:45:46] God has planned for you and I to get us
[1:45:48] to a place that he can track our
[1:45:50] attention to the light of our day
[1:45:53] she had heard that there was a prophet
[1:45:55] in the land she had heard that Abraham
[1:45:58] had so churned away that she also knew
[1:46:00] that Abraham's seed was a blessed
[1:46:02] promise seed and when this man began to
[1:46:05] speak to her something we ignited in her
[1:46:07] that something about this Prophet no
[1:46:10] church oh it happened to you and I when
[1:46:13] we pushed pray and we listened to a tape
[1:46:15] the voice off of that take something we
[1:46:17] ate something inside of us there's
[1:46:19] something about what he's saying he's
[1:46:22] thinking to me and speaking to the
[1:46:24] others he ain't speaking to everybody
[1:46:26] else he's speaking to me the light of
[1:46:29] this day the word for my day is speaking
[1:46:32] to me
[1:46:34] oh
[1:46:35] Rebecca wasn't concerned with what her
[1:46:37] sisters for thought she wakes us up with
[1:46:40] what her mom and dad thought
[1:46:42] he heard the word for her day
[1:46:47] will you go I'll go
[1:46:50] come on come on church he began to take
[1:46:52] her back he began to take her back
[1:46:55] across that way he began to take her
[1:46:57] back but you know what when they come in
[1:46:59] the sight of Isaac Helly Angel Falls off
[1:47:02] the scene
[1:47:03] come on Church
[1:47:04] ain't about the prophet no more
[1:47:06] it's about the groom and the bride being
[1:47:10] joined together come on Church we're
[1:47:12] looking at the light of our day look I'm
[1:47:15] throwing off a prophet I'm not throwing
[1:47:16] off unless you they did what God called
[1:47:19] them to do but there's a pride now that
[1:47:22] must recognize she's the bride of Christ
[1:47:24] she's not marrying the prophet she's
[1:47:26] marrying cry come on church I'm living
[1:47:30] in a dead perversion with men's heart
[1:47:33] want you to follow a man instead of
[1:47:35] following Christ come on Church
[1:47:38] I'm talking about the spiritual this day
[1:47:40] you got to do exactly what he said well
[1:47:42] if you would do exactly what he said you
[1:47:44] would follow that man come on Church
[1:47:46] they don't listen to the tape they
[1:47:48] listen you know what they want to listen
[1:47:50] to Because if they would listen to every
[1:47:52] message that man drinks he pointed them
[1:47:55] to Christ Ellie he's a brought into
[1:47:57] Isaac and then he just said that's your
[1:48:00] group Isaac he's a man for you he's the
[1:48:02] one I've been telling you now here let
[1:48:04] me present you to him
[1:48:06] and then he left the scene come on
[1:48:09] Church
[1:48:10] call Church
[1:48:11] you know it's true and you know the
[1:48:14] spirits that we're fighting in this day
[1:48:15] it's the light of our day God isn't
[1:48:18] showing you it's more than God's in a
[1:48:20] prophet it's a pride that is manifesting
[1:48:23] what that Prophet said
[1:48:25] Rebecca I'm sure we'd like to love the
[1:48:29] stories of Elijah
[1:48:31] she loved to hear about Isaac she loved
[1:48:34] to hear how handsome he was
[1:48:36] she loved to hear how athletic he was
[1:48:38] how hard of a worker that he was she
[1:48:40] probably even loved to hear how much
[1:48:42] money he had
[1:48:43] all of these things made her happy
[1:48:46] but when her eyes be held Isaac
[1:48:49] she don't want to hear them boys
[1:48:51] come on charge
[1:48:52] come on Church well the bride and the
[1:48:55] day of a Rapture when the bride and a
[1:48:58] day of manifesting time it's time for
[1:49:01] stories not to be told but to be spoken
[1:49:03] of come on church it's time for us to be
[1:49:07] the storybook to be the new book of pets
[1:49:10] it's time for Pride to rise up manifest
[1:49:13] what that Prophet said she would be and
[1:49:16] we joined together with Christ
[1:49:18] time
[1:49:20] Psalms 36
[1:49:22] and God will I praise his word and the
[1:49:25] Lord when I praise his word and God have
[1:49:28] I put my trust I will not be afraid what
[1:49:31] man can do to me
[1:49:32] I have vows upon money upon me oh God I
[1:49:36] will render Praises unto thee but there
[1:49:38] has delivered my soul from Death will
[1:49:40] not deliver my feet from told him that I
[1:49:43] may walk
[1:49:45] before God
[1:49:47] in the light of the living
[1:49:49] look in 1964 in the message for all
[1:49:52] we'll try to move on in the age of every
[1:49:54] Seer every Prophet it's been the same we
[1:49:57] find people living in the glare of
[1:49:59] another light
[1:50:00] come on Church
[1:50:02] come on Church you garnish the walls of
[1:50:04] the tombs of the prophets you're the one
[1:50:06] that put them there see they build up
[1:50:08] something over a message come on church
[1:50:10] and they live in the glare of another
[1:50:12] light they refuse to walk in the light
[1:50:14] that is of this day come on Church
[1:50:17] what'd they do in Daniel's day brother
[1:50:20] William told us the golden image was an
[1:50:21] image
[1:50:23] come
[1:50:24] he told us that was the image of them
[1:50:26] and he also come back and he told us
[1:50:27] that the Gentile deposition would start
[1:50:30] unto men worship and it would end on
[1:50:32] demand worship come on
[1:50:34] the same thing of trying to worship a
[1:50:36] man and getting their eyes off of God
[1:50:38] when he says they build up something
[1:50:41] over a message look there ain't nothing
[1:50:43] over the message that Christ sent to you
[1:50:45] mean you come on Church the message that
[1:50:48] this Prophet brought us come out of this
[1:50:50] book you take this book in the message
[1:50:52] that he brought us it'll get you in a
[1:50:54] Rapture it'll get you in manifesting
[1:50:57] time it'll get you to a place that you
[1:50:59] begin to manifest where the Holy Spirit
[1:51:01] wants to manifest in you and you don't
[1:51:03] need somebody to hold your hand you
[1:51:05] don't need a pacifier to make you feel
[1:51:07] better why because you've got the light
[1:51:09] of your day
[1:51:11] foreign
[1:51:15] reason why they refused to know Jesus
[1:51:18] Christ when he came
[1:51:19] that's why Jesus exhorted them saying
[1:51:21] search the scripture for in them you how
[1:51:24] you think you have eternal life and they
[1:51:26] that testify me he said oh but they had
[1:51:30] so many Creeds and things in their
[1:51:32] traditions and Jesus says you've made
[1:51:34] the word of God of no effect
[1:51:37] by your tradition
[1:51:39] and that's the way it's been in every
[1:51:41] age look that's quote from your prophet
[1:51:44] in message 64 April 27 a trial he said
[1:51:47] and that's the way it's been in every
[1:51:49] age
[1:51:50] what in every age they do the same thing
[1:51:53] look if we had time this morning and I
[1:51:56] got a study in there in the book that we
[1:51:58] could turn to and we could fall down
[1:52:00] every denomination
[1:52:02] and we could fall how they come out of
[1:52:04] the organization Luther for that now the
[1:52:07] thesis to the wall of the Catholic
[1:52:08] church that's a Lutheran Church and
[1:52:10] they're Catholic come on Church
[1:52:13] they took 90 of what the Catholics did
[1:52:16] and they just changed a few things they
[1:52:18] called themselves lutherans come on
[1:52:19] Church
[1:52:21] and then you got the message and they
[1:52:23] follow this one and then you got the
[1:52:25] Baptist and they follow this way and
[1:52:27] then you got the Jehovah Witness and
[1:52:28] that part of this one and they quit
[1:52:30] moving on with God they quit moving with
[1:52:34] the light of their day and they begin to
[1:52:36] live in that light of a glare of another
[1:52:38] age and they live where they stayed
[1:52:40] where they're happy with their content
[1:52:42] where they don't get they they don't get
[1:52:45] challenged by the word of God and they
[1:52:47] can just go to church and have a good
[1:52:48] time
[1:52:50] maybe they go to church and watch Frozen
[1:52:53] come on Church
[1:52:55] or February they have Super Bowl party
[1:52:57] we can get everybody together and watch
[1:52:58] the Super Bowl and have a good time
[1:53:00] that's not church
[1:53:02] that ain't what the church was built for
[1:53:04] the church was built to show you the
[1:53:07] word of God to show you right for your
[1:53:09] day for you to rise up above all of this
[1:53:14] I said in many times everybody says
[1:53:16] anything and that's the way it's been in
[1:53:17] every age he said as many times you see
[1:53:19] he said what it is we the people try to
[1:53:23] have our own interpretation of the word
[1:53:25] that's exactly what scripture told us
[1:53:28] Ephesians 8
[1:53:31] divisions five verse 8 says for you
[1:53:34] sometimes dark
[1:53:35] but now
[1:53:37] are you light
[1:53:39] in the Lord
[1:53:41] now walk as children
[1:53:43] of light
[1:53:45] what is it 1959 what is the audio is
[1:53:47] given for
[1:53:48] he says and therefore now watch and that
[1:53:51] day you will know that I'm in the father
[1:53:53] and that you are in me and I am in you
[1:53:57] in that day that you know it for the
[1:53:59] whole thing is one Plan of Redemption
[1:54:01] coming down and God coming back to live
[1:54:04] in and dwell in a commune to his people
[1:54:06] as he did in the beginning
[1:54:10] he said now then
[1:54:12] as soon as he gets a church in speaking
[1:54:15] conditions
[1:54:17] it's Church took place that he can flow
[1:54:20] himself
[1:54:22] through them
[1:54:24] come on Church
[1:54:26] God's looking for a place
[1:54:28] God's looking for a people
[1:54:30] that have said their ideals aside
[1:54:32] come on church we used to stand up here
[1:54:35] in the Ministries before men and the
[1:54:37] elders before me that I stood for this
[1:54:39] word they used to stand up here and they
[1:54:41] used to mess up they said they used to
[1:54:42] bathroom us this they used to bash the
[1:54:45] Pentagon
[1:54:46] and all of these denominations but you
[1:54:49] know what we got to do today is we got
[1:54:50] past message believers better let Creeds
[1:54:54] get in the way of the spirit of God come
[1:54:57] on Church
[1:54:58] we're living in a day that is crept in
[1:55:00] amongst us in churches around the land
[1:55:02] that put your brother Brandon picture on
[1:55:04] the wall that don't mean everything that
[1:55:06] said and here's the truth that means
[1:55:08] that you need to take it back to the
[1:55:09] word and make sure that's what the truth
[1:55:12] isn't spoken he said as soon as he gets
[1:55:14] his people come on church as soon as he
[1:55:17] gets a church his people as soon as he
[1:55:20] gets his bride
[1:55:22] in a condition in speaking conditions
[1:55:25] and gets his to place that he can flow
[1:55:29] through them
[1:55:31] and love
[1:55:32] and persuade
[1:55:34] and fellowship then there will come an
[1:55:38] Eden
[1:55:39] come on Church
[1:55:41] look
[1:55:42] look it's wonderful I love to tell the
[1:55:44] stories I love to hear the stories
[1:55:46] but it's time for the bride to begin
[1:55:48] that's the stories come on Church you
[1:55:52] know it's attacked me so much because
[1:55:54] you say well I don't want to seem like
[1:55:56] I'm Eric and I'm not arrogant but my God
[1:55:58] is available my God is willing my God is
[1:56:02] available my God it has the ability to
[1:56:05] do anything you need him to do
[1:56:07] if it takes me telling stories about
[1:56:10] what God's did for you it's not about me
[1:56:12] it's about him
[1:56:13] it's about me being in a third world
[1:56:15] country and nobody's no place to go and
[1:56:18] God wakes somebody up on the U.S in
[1:56:20] order to pray for me to deliver me from
[1:56:22] an attacking Spirit come on this is
[1:56:24] modern day real life
[1:56:27] still moves the way that he used to move
[1:56:29] God is looking for a bride that she can
[1:56:32] help speaking conditions with come on
[1:56:34] Church how many of you is mad you want
[1:56:37] your wife to be able to talk to you come
[1:56:39] on Church it ain't much of a marriage if
[1:56:41] you can't talk to each other come on
[1:56:43] Church
[1:56:44] you take multiple marriage if if you've
[1:56:46] had a bad day at work and you come home
[1:56:48] and you ain't got somebody to lay your
[1:56:50] head on the shoulder
[1:56:52] I cry a little bit
[1:56:54] and played a little bit and ask for a
[1:56:57] little Mercy as for a little Grace ask
[1:57:00] for a little love my God's the same way
[1:57:02] he's the bride to be able to commune
[1:57:06] with
[1:57:07] he's running a bride be able to share
[1:57:09] his compassions with
[1:57:11] he's wanting a pride to be able to speak
[1:57:13] freely with and her to speak freely with
[1:57:15] him
[1:57:16] to love one another to walk together in
[1:57:19] the in the call of the heat of the
[1:57:21] garden and then before before the fall
[1:57:23] happiness and as Adam would be able to
[1:57:25] walk down through there and I think God
[1:57:27] would be able to just walk down of him
[1:57:30] and they could just talk about how
[1:57:31] beautiful the sons that was
[1:57:34] come on Church
[1:57:36] it's time
[1:57:37] it's time
[1:57:40] if he can get his church into speaking
[1:57:42] conditions
[1:57:43] get his church to a place that he can
[1:57:46] flow himself through
[1:57:48] and love and persuade and fellowship
[1:57:51] then that will come in Eden
[1:57:53] he'll take your church back to where it
[1:57:55] left him at
[1:57:57] Back to Eden again
[1:57:59] that's where it fell and he says oh now
[1:58:01] he said that's when they made its first
[1:58:03] start in fall and that's where to be
[1:58:05] taken right back with every clean state
[1:58:07] of redemption bringing them straight
[1:58:09] back
[1:58:10] to that place again
[1:58:12] Revelations 21 verse 22 reading that it
[1:58:15] says and I saw no Temple therein the
[1:58:17] Lord God Almighty and the Lamb of the
[1:58:19] Temple of it and the City of no need of
[1:58:22] sun neither a moon just shining it for
[1:58:24] the glory of God
[1:58:26] did lighten it
[1:58:28] and the lamp is the Lamb is the light
[1:58:31] thereof and the nations of them who say
[1:58:34] which are saved shall walk in the light
[1:58:37] of it and the kings of the urge to bring
[1:58:39] their Glory and Honor into it and the
[1:58:42] gates of it all shall be up shut At
[1:58:45] All by day for there shall be no night
[1:58:49] there
[1:58:50] oh what a promise and they shall bring
[1:58:53] the glory and honor the Nations
[1:58:54] otherwise Revelations 22. now he speaks
[1:58:57] of its manifesting
[1:58:59] come on Church we've read this so much
[1:59:01] we know it verbatim in our hearts
[1:59:05] when are we going to let it become so
[1:59:07] real
[1:59:08] that the bride can get
[1:59:10] come on
[1:59:11] he's not looking for an 18 Messenger to
[1:59:13] come and reveal to us the secrets of the
[1:59:16] message he did that through this prophet
[1:59:19] come on Church he tied all the loose
[1:59:22] ends up through this prophet
[1:59:24] this was the last they profit this was
[1:59:27] the prophet to bring a message to a
[1:59:29] bride of a Rapture to come this was the
[1:59:32] prophet that God chose that God
[1:59:34] Vindicated that that's why the world
[1:59:36] hates him
[1:59:38] you realize that the world and the
[1:59:40] religious critics hung Jesus because
[1:59:43] they hated him because of who he said he
[1:59:45] was
[1:59:46] you realize that the world and the
[1:59:48] religious critics that today hate him
[1:59:51] because of who he said he was
[1:59:54] because if they really believed was then
[1:59:57] they understand the only way in is
[1:59:59] through the message of the Hour come on
[2:00:01] Church
[2:00:02] but yet they can't live it they can't
[2:00:04] portray it because they ain't the
[2:00:06] backside of the desert experience
[2:00:08] and so what's the next best thing to do
[2:00:10] is to kill it
[2:00:12] come on church that's why they killed
[2:00:15] Jesus it's because Jesus was pointing
[2:00:17] them to the light of their day and they
[2:00:19] chose Darkness over light
[2:00:21] and it don't change in air day that the
[2:00:23] prophet comes showing us the light for
[2:00:26] our day to walk in the light of our day
[2:00:29] and they can't accept the light so they
[2:00:32] had to try to kill it
[2:00:34] with Darkness
[2:00:36] but there's a bride
[2:00:38] come on Church
[2:00:39] there's a God sitting here this morning
[2:00:41] they don't care what the religious
[2:00:43] critics say come on there's a bride
[2:00:46] sitting here this morning that stood on
[2:00:48] the Outsource of Golgotha here
[2:00:51] and they watched him crucify Christ and
[2:00:54] today they're watching them crucify the
[2:00:55] light of their day the messenger of
[2:00:57] their day they're seeing what's
[2:00:59] happening around the world but they're
[2:01:01] standing there on the hillside showing
[2:01:03] but he said this would happen come on
[2:01:06] church that's what that's what Peter
[2:01:09] would say that's what Paul would say
[2:01:10] that's what they would say they said but
[2:01:12] he said that they would destroy the
[2:01:14] temple but in three days they would
[2:01:17] raise it up and they was looking for the
[2:01:19] manifestation of that prophecy that was
[2:01:22] broken there was a bride today that is
[2:01:25] living in the height of her day that is
[2:01:27] looking at the message and the messenger
[2:01:29] because they can't be separated and
[2:01:31] they're looking in the word and they're
[2:01:33] saying oh it's come to pass that they're
[2:01:36] going to crucify the messenger
[2:01:39] crucify his character they're going to
[2:01:41] crucify his message but I'm the bride
[2:01:44] and I'm standing back watching
[2:01:46] manifestation take place at the
[2:01:49] manifestation take place and I'm about
[2:01:51] to go
[2:01:53] in a rapture
[2:01:57] and the spirit
[2:01:59] and the bride
[2:02:01] as they come
[2:02:04] and let him hear it say come
[2:02:07] and let him that is a thirst come
[2:02:10] and whosoever will let him take the
[2:02:13] water
[2:02:14] of life
[2:02:16] freely
[2:02:18] for I testify unto every man that Hearth
[2:02:21] the words of the prophecy of this book
[2:02:24] If any man shall add unto these things
[2:02:26] God shall add unto him the plagues of
[2:02:29] the written of this book
[2:02:30] If any man
[2:02:32] shall take away from the words of the
[2:02:34] book of this prophecy then God shall
[2:02:37] take away his part
[2:02:38] of The Book of Life
[2:02:40] and out of that Holy City and from the
[2:02:43] things that are written
[2:02:44] in this book
[2:02:46] in this book
[2:02:48] there's a lot of people
[2:02:50] gonna answer
[2:02:52] for a lot of things
[2:02:55] come on Church
[2:02:57] come on Church
[2:02:59] people comes and tries to take a
[2:03:00] five-fold Ministry out of this battle
[2:03:03] they're going to answer
[2:03:05] come on Church
[2:03:07] come on Church
[2:03:09] they come in and they start dictating
[2:03:11] and telling you what you can and can do
[2:03:12] they're going to answer
[2:03:14] come on Church I think I've told y'all
[2:03:17] this before y'all need to pay more
[2:03:19] attention to your social media
[2:03:21] because you know what I did I did I did
[2:03:23] a 30-day study back a year ago or so
[2:03:25] hopefully it's changed because hopefully
[2:03:27] people's heard me say it
[2:03:29] and about a 30-minute period I took
[2:03:31] every quote that was placed on Facebook
[2:03:34] that that is in my friend group or
[2:03:36] whatever
[2:03:39] and about 85 percent of them wasn't even
[2:03:41] what the prophet said
[2:03:43] come on Church
[2:03:45] come on Church adding to or taken away
[2:03:50] they're going to answer for it
[2:03:52] but there's a broad
[2:03:56] there's a pride this morning
[2:03:58] this bride is the one I'm speaking of
[2:04:00] sitting here this morning
[2:04:02] that she sees
[2:04:04] the the the the nonsense of this world
[2:04:07] she sees the nonsense of religious
[2:04:10] heresy even in her own ranks
[2:04:14] but when she sees a quote
[2:04:17] she's got technology so she goes types
[2:04:19] it in
[2:04:20] because oh that ain't exactly what he
[2:04:22] said
[2:04:23] it's kind of like the way that this all
[2:04:25] started in the Garden of Eden
[2:04:27] when the devil said everything right but
[2:04:29] one word
[2:04:30] come on Church
[2:04:33] but yet there's a bride
[2:04:35] and he which testifies of these things
[2:04:40] saith surely
