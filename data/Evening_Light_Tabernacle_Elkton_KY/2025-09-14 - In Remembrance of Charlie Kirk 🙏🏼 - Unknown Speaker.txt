========================================

Amen. We want to remember Charlie Kirk and their family this morning. Amen. We uh know enough about him that that uh he went right in the face of the devil. &gt;&gt; I mean, he faced the devil down. So much so that he'd have to wear a bulletproof vest. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because of the threats. Ain't that right? So, he wasn't afraid to get right out there and try to help them young people. That's right. &gt;&gt; Try to tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So, I have a lot of respect for the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're certainly living in Bible days. Yeah. Isn't that right? Where evil tries to destroy good. &gt;&gt; That's right. And so, from what I understand, the man was living with a a trans partner. So, that tells you much a whole lot about the trans person. Isn't that right? Or homosexual. If they'll do that, folks, if a man will live with a man or something like it, they'll do just about anything. I'll say this from the pulpit, they have no morality. You got no morality. Zero. I wouldn't trust you more than nothing. That's right. It's sad. But we do pray for the man that did it. We pray that God will bring conviction on him. Isn't that right? We pray for him. We pray that God will save his soul. That's right. Perhaps you'll see that this man was willing to give his life for what he believed. When you do that, you've got something worthwhile &gt;&gt; because I highly doubt he's got something worth giving his life for. Amen. So, we pray for him. We pray God save his soul. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Have mercy on him. Amen. But what he did was terrible. And so, we want to just think about in a modern age in our own country where a Christian because he's a Christian and stands for Christ, they took his life. Amen. So they have killed him, martyed him because of that. Because of that. Amen. Because of his stands against these type of lifestyles and simply just telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nowadays, telling the truth can get you killed. Ain't that right? But that's okay. We're going to tell the truth anyway. I I don't care who hears it. I don't care if you like it or not. It's the truth, and we're going to stand for it. &gt;&gt; That's right. We don't we don't give one bit one nothing one little care whether you don't like it. &gt;&gt; It's still the truth. It's always going to be the truth. &gt;&gt; And it ain't going to change. We ain't going to change for people's opinion. Is &gt;&gt; that right? &gt;&gt; We don't change for nobody. Amen. We stand with the Lord if it cost us our lives. &gt;&gt; We would much rather die. Hello. Than to give in to such scum and such such falseeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. And such perversion. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. No way we would ever want to uh taint our souls with such things. Amen. And it shows where the world is. So, let's have a moment of silence to remember Charlie Kirk. Lord Jesus, this morning we also remember his wife, his children, his family, Lord, that have to separate from him and suffer the loss and feel that emptiness and have to go through that, Lord. And we do pray for comfort for them, Lord, that they could believe that Charlie's over in heaven knowing he's given his life for the gospel and for the cause of Christ. And we just pray for them in a special way that you'll bring comfort to that family now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
