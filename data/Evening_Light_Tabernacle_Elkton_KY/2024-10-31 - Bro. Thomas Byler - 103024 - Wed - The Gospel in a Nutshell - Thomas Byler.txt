just real just a minute or two early then we'll turn the service to Brother David just want to give everybody a quick uh quick update and uh just want to take a minute to to brag on Jesus is it okay if we brag on him you know I I was just looking at the quote I know brother brandham somebody had said brother brandham uh you brag too much on Jesus he said what I don't brag enough about him you could never say too much in bragging about our lord Jesus cuz he's worthy of all pra so um just want to kind of update you with with what your efforts have went towards uh in the Carolinas and Johnson City area and brother Michael you know brother John and I took those uh generators up there uh last week on and took 53 so and and just to be honest brother Michael uh he wasn't there that day but he'd kind of conveyed to me and he said I I just don't know if we're going to need those or not and here we've just bought 53 generat and so and John he done got worried he we's coming home I I just feel bad I don't know if they're going to be used I said John don't worry about it the Lord wouldn't have laid it on your heart if they wasn't needed people wouldn't have give if it wasn't needed I said so don't don't worry about that they'll be used and then if you saw the post you saw that they they every one of them went out this week and they need more so every single one of them 50 50 well don't want to say every single one we had a couple that that turned up damage but we'll get those fixed and replaced and put back in circulation but all of ours and more went out to a place that they went to was 175 homes without power or electricity um without power listen to that without power or heat let's do it that way without power or heat U so I do know that uh they had also bought I think it was 500 buddy heaters that they had on pallets all of those went with generators cords went and so those people said we need every heater and every generator you got for our community so the Lord knew long before we did there don't do us any good to worry any any need to fret over over what the Lord lays on our heart just do it and let him take care of it so God's good I just want to kind of give you a just a quick uh value of what we've done because you know I'll just tell you how God Cooks in his kitchen we uh we thought we'd take a can of green beans beans well that can of green beans had has now turned into about if you if you were adding monetary and money and everything and like I said we're not bragging on ourselves we're not bragging on the church we're not we're just we're just bragging on what God has done by landing on people's hearts six oh right at 65,000 yesterday $65,000 worth of stuff yesterday today somebody handed Brother David a church in the community handed Brother David a check for $10,000 do to send so we're our little Community out of just because of what was on the this Church's heart has sent over $75,000 of relief you can be you can you can give

father standing at the door this world been will over us when I'm ready for deliverance Lord I've never been this home before amen praise the Lord this evening good to be in the house of the Lord amen I think this quote that I just printed out before coming out goes along with that with that quote so hang on everybody let me just read this people don't know what depressing times comes to this type of a Ministry brother Bram says I get real depressed and I said to the wife I wish could go on she says why do you say that bill oh I have troubles and things here I have troubles and things and then it seemed like the holy spirit said are you trying to bypass them are you trying to dodge them see no I said just let me stand right up in the face of all of it and face it out see it's so much better honestly truly I say this by eyewitnesses that just after this life is over we enter into a land that's beyond anything that anybody could think if there be any strangers here he saids I pray God that you'll not consider me a fanatic of anything I want to be honest and tell the truth what good would it do me if I was to tell something wrong when there's so much that's here that's the truth why would we have to tell anything wrong about it it's just a truth and no wonder I believe Paul was caught up into third heaven and he saw things that it wasn't expedient for him to speak of and one day he said Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not Heard nor has entered into the heart of man what God God has in store for them that love him oh it's just we're living in a dump pile down here just a rubbish sheap smoldering smoke of Filth even if we are not contaminated with it ourselves we are living in it where the smoke is just coming from smoking emils of of sin one of the most sickening things that I can think of is an old city dump of burning was you ever near one that horrible contaminated smell of smoke coming through all kinds of Filth and you get a breath of that and it just turns you around I remember having to go down to New Albany down when 8th street where the old used to be I have to collect down there for the electric meters and so forth I just dread it the day that I had to go down there when I had to take it down there because it was to smell that horrible smell yet laying out there was bodies of rats and dogs and everything you know and it was just smoldering and that old smoke coming up through and yet that life is compared to at its best just a smoldering sin smells from everywhere as it was spiritually speaking but oh the wind's just blowing free and everything else over there so lovely and peace and joy and eternal life just beyond the river but we're in a battle so let's just lay down and say let's hurry up and get over there let's bring everyone with us that we can bring amen that's about the truth isn't it amen you musicians thank you amen it's good to be back in the house of the Lord and amen I feel like I my if I was tell I guess it would show charg amen so recharge amen now if I won't be the Energizer Bunny tonight y'all will be all right amen but praise the lord it's just good to be in the house of the Lord always good to come together but you know I tell tell you what I think if you live here very long and and of course you know brother brandham going to hospitals all the time sick people all the time and the dealing with all the stuff that he had he realiz and I think we do realize that truly this is a low form of life it's a very low form of life this world Amen how many knows we are living in Satan's Eden where it's just sin on every hand people are so debauched until they don't even know what they are in amen and so it's a very very bad place to live and amen and we certainly know that there's a better land over Y and that's what we come out on a Wednesday night for amen amen to prepare ourselves for that land and to make sure that our soul will fit in amen into that place of Holiness and righteousness and peace and joy amen so we're preparing for it and you know if you're going to go into Rapture you have to have the Rapture Ready amen so that's what we come for amen let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father as we now approach your throne of grace once again coming into your house Gathering ourselves together according to your word and to your will to your plan father and that which we have asked us to do now Lord we ask God that you'll Speak Lord through my lips father the words of Life the things that you once spoken on this Wednesday night God we surrender ourselves to you Lord believing God that you will be the same yesterday today and forever Lord and you will speak the hearts father you know the thoughts and intents of each one and what we all have need of and I pray God that when people hear the thing God that that your voice speaking to them that they'll respond and receive it and accept it and that we might be able to go from here being able to say did not our hearts burn within us as the Holy Spirit spoke to us on this Wednesday night along the way from God you are the same yesterday today and forever we ask your blessing upon our meditation and that which we feel Lord that you've laid on our heart to speak help us Lord to do it as only the holy spirit gives and the ability that you give and thank you for each one God that has come out Lord to hear father your word tonight Lord we appreciate each one God blessing upon the word now in Jesus name amen amen my thought is just kind of a uh uh different one I've just kind of been praying about what to speak on and and uh the the thought that came to my mind amen is the gospel in a nutshell amen the gospel nutshell amen and I thought well Lord that's kind of a strange subject amen that's kind of different amen because I know that when you go to talking about God well the nutshell had better be pretty big and how are you gonna put God in a nutshell right amen but it was kind of a figure of speech as you know when you're talking about a subject well that's what I'm trying to talk or say in a nutshell amen amen and so amen it certainly won't be just that but you know there is a plan that God has is that right and we so tonight we want to talk about we want to begin on that plan I thought you know it just depends on how how this goes but this might be a miniseries I certainly am praying that God will give me a good series amen maybe we should ask big should we ask B all right let's ask God maybe to give us a a long very long series amen I like those long series amen so if it's it's all winter it's all right with me amen because Fall's about over with here pretty soon so pretty soon it'll be winter amen and we just want to see what the Lord has but we're going to amen certainly go just on the first part as we talk about the plan of God Amen uh God and God's wisdom amen so if you have your Bible amen we'll turn to First Corinthians if you will 1 Corinthians two First Corinthians 2 and I want to just review a little bit on Sunday yet before I get started but let's read chapter 2 and verse 6 but let's start with five that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God amen amen how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen I want to say Sunday morning I really enjoyed Brian's Sunday school lesson amen praise the Lord and you know I'm still well it just comes to me now but I'm still chewing on that amen amen still kind of eating on that because you know I like what he said you know he is he wants to make a strong finish amen how many believes it's a strong it's important to finish strong amen some folks many folks people start strong they have a strong strong start but a very weak finish amen amen and some people finish at all many are that way a't that right many don't finish at all amen and I like what he said he it's better start weak it's better to start weak you might say well that guy ain't never going to make it huh I just don't see how he's going to do it you know all the faltering all the fail all the doubt all the he's trying to you know struggle you know you might think that he's just starting weak but you know it's okay if he finishes strong amen I would rather do that than the opposite isin't that right amen and then brother Brad come along amen amen and I don't know about what you got out of it but what I really got out of it was amen that is that we are to keep walking keep walking on the King's Highway isn't that right if trouble keep walking amen how about you repeating after me I got wrote down here I want you to repeat you say keep walking sickness comes walk if troubles comes keep walk if Mama quits if Daddy quits if brother won't go if Sister won't go if Deacon won't go if preacher don't go keep on walking amen Give the Lord a hand that was good isin't that right that's right keep on walking just keep pressing on Amen because you know and a and a marathon you know if you get somebody in a marathon that just gives it all he's got right off to go get right watch out he's probably going to burn out now Marathon you got to pace yourself ain't that right about halfway through he'll be sitting on the side of the road huffing and puffing sitting there right I can't do it yeah why because he didn't Pace himself amen that's what you and I got to do is that right pace ourselves Amen brother Brian sister Jette we've been going this way now a lot of us here for 40 30 years now hello around 30 years you got to pace keep on pressing on Amen pace yourself amen you know we love people to be on fire we love people to run the aisle Shout Scream and holler and all of that and so forth you know but if after a while they're gone what good did it do I'd rather be a little more quiet amen and keep pressing the battle amen now I don't want you to be quiet but still you understand what I'm saying I want you to have a real anchor there it's not about your emotions amen I like something else but the Brad said he says you know just because troubles come don't lean On Emotion don't go by that emotion and that all of that don't go by that go by that down in Holy Spirit I'm pressing the battle amen so I appreciate that amen praise the Lord God is good so amen let's just look at God's plan for just a little bit and we going to talk about God's wisdom and his plan but uh and and amen let me just get Paul to explain it a little bit can I do that in Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 and we'll begin with verse one for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ to you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given unto me to you word how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery which I uh wrote a in a few words whereby when you read you may be may be that you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ amen which in other Ages was not made known to the sons of men but it is now revealed unto His Holy proph Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow Hees and of the same body and partakers of the his promise in Christ by the gospel amen verse eight unto me who am less than the least of the Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ amen and to make all men to see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities or principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God many times in brother br when he preaches the seals he talks about how that God has completely opened the Revelation the Revelation has been completely opened of God plan and what he had in his mind from the beginning amen and I like that word completely because if he says completely then we are understanding what the plan of God was so when we talk about a nutshell and we try to get comprehend amen what God's programmed what God's plan is the first thing we know is that for four Millennia for Millennia 4,000 years man would have to wonder what it's all about what is life all about what's it all about us coming living and having uh making a living and raising our families and going by the way of our fathers and generation after generation would come amen and go and what is the real purpose and what in the world was God thinking Wars and troubles and pestilence and diseases and all the pain and the anguish the sorrow that comes with it is that right man was wondering what it was all about is this nutshell what is this all about the plan of God Paul said that it was a mystery in other ages it was not made on to man amen the manifold wisdom of God the manifold knowledge of God Amen until we come to the knowledge of the truth amen I'm going to use the word knowledge a lot and wisdom a lot amen because Mo most of the time amen we uh talk more of you know may perhaps talk a little of Faith a little bit but we want to talk about the the wisdom of God the knowledge of God because and the Mystery of God now so he says that these things have been a mystery for all of this time but now through the gospel through the uh uh let me see where it says of course through Paul but he says that they these places that it might be made known by the church so where is this going to be opened up where are we going to find this out at is the church the understanding of what it was all about cuz we're living in a world folks that don't know what it's all about they still live in ignorance they still don't have the wisdom of God they don't have the knowledge of God the knowledge of God is the truth amen and it corrects the wrong amen the knowledge of God tells you as a whole churches and so forth that you got to repent turn around you're going the wrong way amen turn around praise the Lord amen now how many knows that knowledge is power you heard the word knowledge is power and it truly is it truly is there's a lot of things that I've done later on I thought boy if I had just know this it had been so much easier it had been so much better I wish I would have just know that before it would make it a whole lot better I still do because how many knows it takes knowledge it takes understanding to be able to run a home to be a husband to be a wife to raise children to have a church to operate a church you need knowledge you need the wisdom of God in all these things because if you don't you're going to mess up amen and we say well look you know experience is so much better than knowledge no experience gives you knowledge we go to the school of heart knocks most of the time and then we can say you know I know what that's all about because I experienced it you got the knowledge of that because you experienced it so experience gives you knowledge it gives you wisdom it gives you understanding unfortunately we got to go to that school most of us do amen and most of us don't pass fifth grade the first time sometimes the second time sometimes the third time come on folks we got to take it again and again but I like to look at the whole scope of it I am glad so glad understand the scope of it it gives you peace amen okay so um this was in in Ephesians now in Ephesians 1 Paul once again talks about this mystery that's been hid amen now in one uh place it talks about you know God takes the wisdom you know by wisdom man doesn't know God right we don't know God by wisdom and these other things yet yet Jesus said be wise as a serpent so he does want us to be wise worldly wisdom is what he's talking about Paul's talking about amen Ephesians 1 and verse4 as according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated of the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to good PL pleasure of his will Amen to the praise of the glory of his grace whereing hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom also we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded towards us all wisdom and prence God has directed towards you all wisdom and Prudence amen so there is a Prudence that you might not want because God hides it from the wise and prudent reveals it to babes such as it learned but here Paul says he has also given you a wisdom and a Prudence amen how many believe that you ought to be smart as attack so to speak sharp as attack smart God wants you smart amen we know the phrase you can't fix stupid but I want to declare to you that that there's something that ignorance can be fixed ignorance cuz we know ignorance is just because you don't know something you're ignorant of it and so that's what we need fixed sometimes amen you can learn you can fix that ignorance God winked at the ignorance of Luther and Wesley and Pentecost he winked at it but when he come and he Vindicated the word you ain't ignorant no more you see now your sins open amen got rid of that ignorance he don't wink that ignorance and anymore amen praise the Lord that's right now notice wherein he has uh abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will woo I'm going just say it while it comes to me knowledge do you realize brother said when the bride knows when she knows who she is the rapture take place amen wow she knows who she is but you know I wrote down on here I says you know but we better know a lot of whole lot of other St there's some bunch of stuff maybe we need to know amen before we even get to that God is trying to Enlighten us make known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times he might gather together in one things all things in Christ which are in heaven and which are in Earth amen even in him down in verse 18 the eyes of your [Music] understanding amen how many believes there's a mechanism in your mind that God has to open up amen he that believeth on me amen shall not perish he that heareth my words amen and believeth on him me shall never perish the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the same is and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us where believe according to the power working of his mighty power when he wrought which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places amen now in Colossians he's Paul tells the Ephesians folks this and it wasn't much different over in Colossians 1 and verse 25 where he says whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given unto me for for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generes but now it's made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen so he's saying there once again that this has been a that it been hid from Generations it's the hidden wisdom amen praise the Lord according to EP I mean First Corinthians 2 and 7 says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom wiom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory how many knows the world doesn't have this wisdom it says it says which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory so that they don't get the wisdom how many believes it's important to receive the wisdom of God receive the wisdom of God otherwise you're going to be in the dark amen praise the Lord I'm not going to have near enough time and that's okay we don't expect to get through but I'd like to get she through some of the good stuff but uh let's go I'll just I'll just say this the world don't know first of all the world don't know who made the world they might think so or whatever but if you remember that atheist that went around the country and spreading his atheist doctrines everywhere remember brother Braham said he went out west one time on vacation and he went up into the mountain somewhere is that right he was going by these rocks these rocks and and something come over him something come over and said now where did they come from where did they come from they spoke so loud that he be Christian because he believed they had that had to come from somewhere Bible said one place you know if they don't believe the gospel or You Don't Preach he said the rocks will cry out God can preach the go gopel with a bunch of rocks it's when he speaks to Your Heart Right There amen so he didn't want to believe it people don't people don't want to believe the first commandment or the first scripture in the Bible in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth if you can't believe that where are you going to go how dark is you're going to world going to be amen take the Bibles out of schools and teach them uh a Big Bang Theory right anything but to believe that but because if you really believe that the same as if you really get the knowledge of God and you hear that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son if you believe that knowledge if you believe that with all of your heart the Bible says that you'll be saved you'll actually be saved if you genuinely believe that that whosoever believeth me shall not perish now there's some real know of God there's some real wisdom of God that if you accept that into your heart it's going to be a sweet thing for you amen amen I'm going to say it because it comes to my mind but I've been thinking about this for the last few weeks there's so many people that say well I believe the cross I believe Jesus died on the cross amen and my question is why does the death of the cross mean so much more to us than it does most people why I'll tell you why is because we can truly believe that the whole world hinged and the great mystery of of of God was that he would come amen and that he would die on Calvary for your sins and he would redeem us back to himself amen it means so much more because you believe what Jesus is doing today if you believe that oh I believe what he did back then but you reject him today you Mar your testimony you Mar your experience it's not the same the story of the Cross means so much more to a Believer a real believer that believes it all than he that only believes part of it but won't accept what God is doing today because of his church or whatever it might be amen I hope somebody out there is listening to that that's right because you can't accept him of yesterday and deny him today and have the same feeling have the same consequences have the same rewards you got to believe all of him every bit of it amen and it just means so much it's such a reality that's why I believe that the preaching of the cross in the message you know it's so valid amen okay so speaking of wisdom let's talk about that for just a few minutes wisdom now how many knows that if you want to talk about wisdom you better go back and talk to solom a little bit Ain that right let's go talk to Solomon because he had a whole lot of wisdom amen the Proverbs of Solomon the son uh the son of David king of Israel to whom wisdom and instruction amen how many know that when you buy something and they give oh it's all complicated you don't know I have no idea you know just like brother Brian and and and looking at a schematics I guess is the word it's a little big for me but the schematics of the electral system and so forth and it's got all these lines and all of this other stuff folk you would never want Thomas berer to try to figure that out now now just too stupid yeah or or whatever you want to call it yeah too ignorant but let's let's say ignorant that's a better word don't know I learn it if I really studied I'm sure I probably could there's other things that I've done that I thought I've never could do you know but he knows just just how it is when you get something and and and read the instructions it gives you the knowledge to be able to put it together amen how many believes that that's what this is the Bible in the N shall you God's instruction manual man there's way too many people out there that are trying to do this without reading the instructions that's right they got the wheel on backwards they got this on backwards they put on all together and come to find out this part has to be put on first because you can't get it on if these other parts are put on and it's very aggravating tearing that thing all back down to put that one peace on so read the instructions that's the way with a Christian the whole bulk of it is that God wanted a family of his own here in and set forth the love of God brother bam said am mean if God wanted a family of his own fs and daughters like himself amen and he will chastise them and he will rebuke them and he'll give them troubles and all of those things are part of the nut a mean it's all a part of it amen so he'll chasen and sometime he'll thoroughly break him down how many knows you if a Christian and you still got this and you still got that amen yeah God can't put that all together he has to come and take you and thoroughly break you back down and start over I don't know about you but I don't want to be broke down and have to start over he's done that a few times I'm glad you never had to be broke down and Dead start would we got some time to do that amen instruction wisdom and instruction amen receive the instruction of wisdom Justice judgment and Equity to give subtility to the simple huh I many know that the serpent was the most subtile beast of the field and God said be wise is a serpent he wants you to be simple if you're a simple one God wants you to have some subtility thank you very much subtility about you Amen to the young man knowledge and discretion and wise man will hear it and will increase learning amen that's right in Matthew 28 he says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature baptizing them in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost them teaching them teaching them you learn something when you get taught teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I am have commanded [Applause] you amen that's right and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels amen a smart man will listen to instruction a proud man is too proud I don't need it I already know it a smart man will want to learn more man man will be happy with what he has already hello so many people well I've got my religion I already know what I believe I don't Christ can't come in there anymore but a wise man will say what now tell me something more most of the time A wise man will listen and keep his mouth shut but a foolish man will do all talking and none of the listening amen praise the Lord attain to wise counsels verse seven Proverbs 1 and 7 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction I mean those fools also refuse repentance they refuse to be corrected so the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge amen you open up your mind and know that there's a God and you reverence you begin to reference that God that's beginning of knowledge and wisdom amen they're stupid and then there's worse you know what what's worse than stupid a fool a fool Bible says a fool has said in his heart there's no God Amen how many thankful that you fear God we reverence God I'm going to wanted to tell you a story I'm going to go ahead and and and tap into this now in Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 13 He says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter let's hear his whole shall fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man man praise the Lord amen all right I want to talk to you a little bit about something I've experienced and something the Lord's kind of taught me here in the last few weeks through my deer hunting it's a deer hunting story so are you ready for a dear hunting story first opening day we've had a big buck on video and Camera com into our corn all the time and feed her I wanted the big one well come opening morning I got my shot but I shot that b in the leg bad place to hit him a't that right hit him in the leg the front shoulder right here I think it broke it from what I could tell after I got him but it killed me you know I just oh man I hate to wound anything I hate to hurt anything and then got him on camera a couple times after that but then he left for about a month and I was worried I ain't even going to have another shot at him but sure enough after a while when we was up there I think with uh brother Joe and brother Aaron up there and he come on video and come on camera and of course brother Aon could have tell told you he wonder what kind of a jubilee I was having and he's back back what's going on he's back my book's back oh my I don't know if I have it no I changed my picture I wish I had it I wanted to show you a picture of that buck after about a month and he was about half his weight maybe not but it was very scy looking and I was feeling bad I was like man look what you did you ain't you you need to just give up hunting if you're just going to hurt the animals and make them suffer and I B CED B had tears because of him suffering like that you know but I says you know and and in in the winter time and everything but he came back and he was back and so forth and we were just still entertaining air and them and and having a good time up there and um so that was on a Wednesday I think Tuesday day they left and and Wednesday I was going to go out I wanted to go out there in case he comes back that night I really wanted to get this deer so Wednesday night I went out there I told uh Joe brother Joe I said I'm gonna go out tonight I I said I I can squeeze the hunt in because it don't go get dark till like 6 6:30 and so if I can hunt till 6:30 I can get out of the tree I might miss the prayer meeting I may miss the song service but I'll get about at 7:30 in here I'll come dragging in here late pack sit back there or whatever you know and and so I told Jo and if I shoot him guess what it's hot out here it's 80 degrees and you can't let the meat spoil my Ox dear Ox it's going to be in the ditch that night and I won't tell you what Joe said that's confidential but [Laughter] anyway anyway that's what I was going to do you know so I went there and I got up in that tree in there and so forth and and I begin to think I says here you are you know I said then uh you're going to be way late for church and a voice begin to speak to me and it says you know you you teach everybody else that put God first put God first and here you are not you know come 30 minutes early folks you know and here you're going to be in the tree 30 minutes early and all these other stuff and I said man and this just don't feel right it just don't feel right I I can't do it so it be long before daylight I begin to come on back down I said no I'm I'm going to church just Buckle weight you know just Buckle weight put God first you know and and don't worry about it so we come down and boy I'll tell you what it felt so much better when when when you do the right thing coming down is a good feeling you know a and while you're sitting there it wasn't a good feeling you know I don't know about you but it's good whenever you feel like you're doing something you really ought and do everybody ask well where you at brother why are you so late well I was hunting there well you I thought y'all taught me to come to church and and put God first and everything you know and so I that's what's the voice that I heard you know I'm putting God first and so forth and I come down you know and come to church I was old enough for prayer meeting and everything praise the Lord had a good time and the next night okay I'm going to go up Thursday night I'm going to get him now you know he'll maybe come in he hadn't really come the daylight hours but I knew he would pretty soon and so Thursday I got to go and laye and them where they at anyway I there's oh there she is that's right you got your new spot appreciate our young people coming to the front appreciate all the folks and she says are you g to come to the game it's a championship game amen wanted to [Music] Champion all right I'll come amen this is what went through my mind I'm going be honest with you I thought man if I if I'm sitting there watching her and that thing comes on on my camera and I could have been there I'm going to go up there so he he's there you better hit that b and you better win this game cuz I sacrificed my heart but I said you know I said no let's sacrifice you know but uh anyway sometimes how's that many's ever felt and I'm sure everybody in here that sometimes when you sacrifice and you give amen and you feel like man I just can't give no more how many's ever felt like that amen well I believe when you feel like that that is when you're giving what you ought to give because for others is that right and I've learned patience you know there was a time I didn't even go out cuz he wasn't coming and so forth I says I'm just going to wait and me and Patience man to ask Caleb and mik me and Patience we do not agree we have serious Discord amongst each other you know and so I want to get out there and and so but in my my uh growing towards younger growing towards being younger I'm trying to come up with a different word right I'm growing TS getting young again amen and even in the last two three weeks I've told my wife I said I've noticed a change in myself that's right God is changing me a little bit at a time more patience and more dedicated to the Lord and just you know that's where I want to be amen anyway so that's right Thursday night was out amen and so that's right and went to the Ball Game and they ended up losing but anyway that was all right enjoyed my grandchildren you know enjoyed the game and all and then went out Friday there was nothing and then guess what Saturday night the Lord brought him in and I shot him that's right so praise the Lord so I thought you know that's God get put God first don't worry about it it doesn't matter just put God first whatever you do amen fear the lord reverence God Amen praise the Lord but fools despise instruction amen now this is kind of a different thing there I want to go to but let's look at what wisdom does and I think I'll go over to amen my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments this just comes to mind I think I'm something that I felt like I missed on this on putting the Lord first it was when I was there in that tree and in that case I felt like I wasn't putting God first I got to think other things maybe that I was doing maybe that wasn't put in God first and then I wanted to tell you all I wonder if we don't do that more than what we realize I wonder sometimes if we do that more than what we realize because there's so many areas in our life that God has told us to do certain things a certain way and when you don't when you do something contrary to what the Bible says how many knows that you're putting him second amen put God first in everything all right now in verse 13 of Proverbs it says happy is the man that findeth wisdom the man that GTH understanding for the merchandise of it is is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold amen it's kind of like character that Peter talked about through the fiery furnace of Affliction he says there's a knowledge and experience and character that's molded that's much better than any gold that perishes it'll ever be true wisdom is worth more than gold and silver and diamonds amen think of all the people that are billionaires that don't get the real wisdom of God don't get the real understanding of their eyes being enlightened don't accept God's wisdom of accepting his grace for their lives amen my she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou C desire are not to be compared unto her Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace amen how many beli that Jesus is of all wisdom and when you get Jesus in your heart you have that Fountain of all wisdom in your heart there's one thing I wanted to say with that and that is even though you have all of that wisdom and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a lot of times that God has to still teach you the things that he wants you to know you still have to be taught though you have the Holy Ghost and I think we can all say boy but the Lord is working hard and trying to teach me this trying to teach me that amen because he has to teach you the Holy Spirit teaches us things only that's right happy is every one that retaineth her the Lord by wisdom hath founded the Earth by understanding Heath established the heavens by his knowledge the depth are broken up and the clouds drop down do amen how many knows every part of what you're looking at now out there is God's wisdom God's knowledge put it all together how does rain how do forms Cloud uh form clouds form over the ocean pick up the water Ain that right turn it from Salt Water to fresh water and drop it down on the land I don't know but God's wisdom does and I'm here to tell you when God's wisdom is operating in your life it's peace amen being justified by faith we have peace with God amen brings peace he under he made the Earth the depth the clouds amen my son let them not depart from that eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion amen praise the Lord so shall there be life unto thy soul and Grace unto thy neck then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not humble amen how many know second Peter he says you know add to your uh Faith virtue and knowledge and Temperance and add all these things to you and if you am mean do these things they make so that you never fall amen praise the Lord all right folks times up amen 20 after that's when I you close sometimes but amen now notice Thou shalt walk listen then shalt thou walk in thy way safely thy foot shall not stumble when thou liest down Thou shalt not be afraid when thou shalt light thy then thy sleep shall be sweet true wisdom true understanding true smartness is to accept what the Lord Jesus did for us on Calvary amen it's to understand that this book this book here remember in the seals brother bham over and over and overall this book A book of redemption a book of redemption to redeem something is to bring it back from its Fallen state or dropped state to take that thing back up where it was before now how many knows that is Jesus Christ in the mind of God was crucified before the foundation of the world Amen and he redeemed back so this book here in a nutshell is a book of redemption to bring back the Lost Sons and Daughters of God Amen praise the Lord book of redemption ion amen knowledge is power whether it be by experience and it needs to be with a Christian it needs to be by experience is that right because that experience according to the scripture is a revelation that God has given you personally is that right by revealing himself and making himself real to you amen now you say I know what it's like to be saved I know because I experienced it I now know I now have the knowledge of what it's like I was once lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see I didn't know who I was but I am I don't didn't know what I was here for but now I know what I'm here for amen man praise the Lord jumping around a little bit we'll talk back about power for just a minute but let's talk a little bit more about what the world don't know because we're talking about now you know now you know how much better is when you can say now I know now I know to me those are precious words I didn't know brother Braham says you can talk to people you can say something and and you know it's sometimes you're saying something complicated and all of a sudden everything you said just makes sense and falls together and you say oh I understand you catch it amen but I I wrote down here the world the things that the world don't know the world don't even believe Genesis was one that God created the heavens and the Earth they wanted to talk about a Big Bang Theory and they don't even know where we come from Darkness to not know where we come from trying to say that we evolve from a tadpole teach Evolution Darwin Theory you see how you can't have peace like that there's no power in being confused there no strength in it there's no virtue in it when it's all virtue when it's all strength when you do know who you are when you realize that you're a son and a daughter of God devil look out look out devil why because you recognize you're a son of God you're a daughter of God all of a sudden now the devil will become powerless to you amen amen praise the Lord don't know where they come from amen they don't understand how the creation and all of that that came amen they think the serpent was the snake perhaps but how many knows the snake didn't move its lips Now Eve you got to take a take a bite of this apple that's very very nice you know how they animate it and all how many knows the serpent it had been freaky hello it had been freaky if I'd have been balum and that donkey begin to talk to me yeah that donkey and that big lips I can't imagine what it was like but he blabbered he said you know I've served you all these years this other and the other is that right and he talked to him and so forth gkey can talk it's weird when an animal talks and God called this serpent the most subtle Beast he didn't call him human how many knows his serpent was a beast but he was also upright man we know that it was a missing link amen he was a missing link the world don't know that but you know that amen aren't you glad to to know what the serpent seed's all about the serpent that had a seed the serpent that beguiled Eve that's right he could talk and I think he had said he had his place for a soul but he didn't have a soul huh that's right so this Beast he was handsome from what brother Ram says he was good-look he was a good-look beast well let's call him a good-look monkey that was the best looking monkey in in the jungle cuz Eve was infatuated with him and this Beast could talk that would be weird wouldn't it brother Joe hear an animal talking but that's what he was he was a beast he wasn't human but yet he could talk I mean it's one of those mysteries in the nutshell the world understand doesn't know amen praise the Lord without God's knowledge without knowing where people come from what they're here for they don't know who they are even that's why you have the confusion that you have out there now not only do they not know where they come from but they don't even know for sure what they are gross on the people it's sad Brother Brad but we got to be glad that we can say hey I know I'm a man I am a man they ask one of our Supreme Court Justices what is a woman can you say what a woman is didn't even know what a woman was couldn't describe what a woman was yeah that's right would have been a real simple answer but that's on our Supreme Court of justices amen my what a shame not to know where you who you are be glad that you have parents to tell you what you are who you are amen slap you upside the head when you talk funny be appreciative at it amen with knowledge comes power how many knows when Thomas uh not Thomas Benjamin Franklin when he had put that kite out and he felt like there's a power somewhere there that there that there that lightning it's got power now I think he felt the did he feel the shock or something right or or put it in a bottle somewhere and he says and he felt and he says I got it I got it he was like boy there's a power surging through here but it wasn't until Thomas Edison I believe it was that did the light bulb right he come in and here worked and worked and worked and worked and work until he finally channeled that wo how you like how you like the light knowledge is power when they enel when they developed an engine they created the engine well guess what it wasn't long until you had a 454 uh 357 and all these powerful engines and Roar and everything else knowledge was power oh my what if knowledge is power in the natural and that can send this man to space I'm here to tell you tonight knowledge in the spiritual realm is power amen we've had a Prophet come along and said you know I don't know how to just to say this but I want to say that I was born C Day a certain time that I was born again a prophet comes along and lets me know that guess what because you did have a birth if you are a son of God if you have got the Holy Ghost then that doesn't that means you was with God from the very beginning you wasn't saved on any certain day you was always saved so when the Devil comes and tells you why you ain't to make it you're going to make it I say guess what the power of the word the knowledge of the word says if I ever was I already am the knowledge of that kind of power says amen if I ever made it he says you've already made it you can no more be lost than God can be lost the spiritual world of wisdom and knowledge just like the natural opened up up they come with the atomic bomb amen all the way from a horse and buggy in the realm of travel to a spaceship oh the same way with us from the time of Luther oh I feel a little tin I feel a little tug Thomas Edison lighted up and lit up huh still had a lot of ignorance in them what they don't use electricity for now and it was the same way Church oh we got speaking in tongues it's on and off sometimes Pentecostal has speaking in tongues but you and I have something greater because the great mystery of it all it's Christ is in you amen and it's surging through this body and it's telling you what to do and what not to do what to say and what not to say that power is surging I know because it's surging in me yeah that's right it'll do something for you it'll Quicken this old formal this old dying body Quicken it make it come to life amen praise the Lord don't you just love it in this age we find out and I got a new revelation on untapped resources amen it's not that it isn't discovered how many believes these un these untapped resources it's not that they haven't been discovered yet it just means that you haven't tapped into them yet huh the word is there how many believes rapturing Faith lays in the message of the hour all you got to do is get yourself right amen tap into that source to where all things are possible them to believe how many believe that's the word of God nothing shall be impossible for you we're in the Space Age folk we can fly higher than anybody else we got more power than anybody does and it isn't distributed by can any it's not in speaking in tongues no but it's living their life daily amen speaking in tongues is great that's wonderful but when you go out there and cheat and lie and steal that's a different story you really haven't about it but the Holy Ghost is the literal life of Jesus Christ himself in you living out his life you talk about power amen you believe it tonight Lord teach us thy ways hey amen when you're truly Born Again amen when you repent and you get God's knowledge then you realize that you're a son and daughter of God amen amen people want to get saved they want their soul saved but they don't want to be saved from sin they want to sin but they want their souls saved but when Christ comes in that power takes out the desire for sin changes the nature of a person gives you a different desire amen I don't care if it's 160 class book God said do this do this amen turn when the Holy SP turns you praise the Lord all right praise the Lord I I want to finish this part anyway would that be okay amen got a whole page yet here we'll go through it real quick amen oh my maybe I should stop let's stop there we'll teach some morning man perhaps on identification am me when you truly come to the knowledge the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ you begin to recognize who you are and where you come from what you here for I was thinking when I thought about what you're here for brother Thomas you shouldn't have to wonder what you're here for you've been doing it for about 30 years you're about done doing what you're here for or will be whenever the Lord's done amen you know when that is but it's nice to know that you're doing what God wants you to do I don't care what it is what trade you are and and so forth amen when God blesses you in something you say Lord I believe that what God called me to do this right here amen amen praise be to God but I thought about that you know theel of the knowledge shall be increased power shall be increased it was is that right and it was the same way with the Church of the Living God Amen he opened up the seals the Mysteries that would had been hid and it released power power amen stand with me tonight David Brother David if you will come musicians with our heads bowed how many would just raise your hand I want that power to Surge through me on a daily basis I want that power that's comes from above me to do what I'm supposed to do keeps me from Evil helps me to do what's right helps me to think the way that I'm supposed to think act the way that I'm supposed to act Lord you see the hands and our hands are all up Lord Jesus saying father we want more of you we want more of the knowledge of God we want more of your wisdom we want more of your instructions father
