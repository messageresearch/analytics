[22:12] day is coming God bless you you may be
[22:15] seated brother Brian
[22:34] Lord bless you
[22:36] all if you would uh turn with me to I'll
[22:40] try to get this mic right uh to the
[22:43] Gospel of John the first
[22:46] chapter I you know you could just spend
[22:49] U hours just in this 37th Psalm here and
[22:53] as you read this first verse here as you
[22:55] turn to
[22:57] the uh first chapter of the Gospel of
[22:59] John it says threaten not thyself
[23:01] because the
[23:02] evildoers neither be thou evance against
[23:05] the workers of iniquity and you know we
[23:08] we're in an age now where after several
[23:12] generations of given out participation
[23:15] trophies to people and not holding
[23:17] people accountable for their actions and
[23:19] the way they treat other people we're at
[23:21] where we're at this morning you know and
[23:23] I was just thinking and it's it's it's
[23:26] simple
[23:28] but you can't it's really
[23:31] simple out what's going on out there in
[23:33] the world they refuse to accept truth
[23:36] when it's presented to them and they've
[23:38] gone on for Generations not accepting
[23:41] the simple truth of the Gospel of Jesus
[23:43] Christ and that's where we're at this
[23:46] morning that's where we're at today you
[23:48] know those people that are fussing with
[23:50] you you tell them the truth and I I'm
[23:53] not trying to be funny you you express
[23:55] the truth out of God's word to them what
[23:57] do they say to you well that's your
[23:59] truth I have my own truth that's exact
[24:02] that's exactly what they're going to say
[24:04] to you and to a point that they'll laugh
[24:07] at you they mock you they don't believe
[24:09] it and you can't force people to believe
[24:11] the word of God and
[24:14] um I never I I know I say that I won't
[24:17] say it but can it get worse yes it can
[24:20] get worse can it get better no it's not
[24:22] going to get any better out there it's
[24:24] only going to get worse the prophet of
[24:27] the age told you that as they
[24:29] continually to turn their backs on the
[24:31] Living God and refuse to do what the
[24:34] word of God tells them to do it only
[24:36] gets worse so where we're at this
[24:38] morning it's only going to get 10 times
[24:41] worse or
[24:42] fast than it was yesterday or today so
[24:46] it's not going to get any better but it
[24:48] should drive us as Christians and as
[24:50] Believers to want to get closer to the
[24:53] word of God and get closer to Jesus
[24:56] Christ and it's really simple they want
[24:58] a savior but they don't want a lord it's
[25:01] the Lord Jesus Christ it's not just the
[25:04] Savior but he has to be the Lord of your
[25:06] heart and of your life and that's why
[25:08] the world isn't the way it is this
[25:10] morning because they just want the
[25:12] Savior part they don't want anything
[25:14] telling them what they can and cannot do
[25:17] now is it legalism or is it law no it's
[25:21] love but to them it's legalism it's not
[25:24] love and it's a crazy place this morning
[25:27] but it going to the Gospel of
[25:29] John I was just going to read this is
[25:32] I've read this out of this before I'm
[25:35] not used to holding a mic but this is a
[25:37] World War II devotional that I I read
[25:40] every
[25:41] morning and this was an Evangelical
[25:44] Church preacher this is what they had
[25:47] for a devotional the men during World
[25:49] War II so this is 80 plus years old and
[25:53] I was Wren reading this what this man
[25:56] had their wife for this day for these
[25:59] and the uh scripture was Philippians the
[26:02] 4th chapter which is a really important
[26:04] chapter but I'll just read what he had
[26:06] to say and this was in 1940
[26:09] 1941 so brother and this is before
[26:13] brother Brandon preached that final
[26:15] message so we're several years before
[26:17] that in the 1950s but this is what this
[26:20] man had to say Christianity is the power
[26:23] of God in the soul of man and that's the
[26:25] truth the word of God Christianity is
[26:27] your power it's what needs to abide in
[26:30] your soul and your life this morning and
[26:32] then a personal experience of the
[26:34] Christian it ought to provide an inner
[26:36] resource of spiritual power for daily
[26:39] living and that all f is in one simple
[26:43] thought you have to be baptized in the
[26:45] Holy Ghost that's the only way this true
[26:48] Christianity is going to express itself
[26:50] through you and your life and he goes on
[26:52] to say hoping I don't lose my place for
[26:55] daily
[26:56] living it if it it doeses not do this
[26:59] for us our Christianity is not
[27:01] functioning properly and we have failed
[27:04] to respond with adequate Faith to what
[27:06] God in Christ has freely offered to us
[27:10] that that's just as true this morning as
[27:12] it was in
[27:14] 1941 and down the centuries multitudes
[27:17] of folks of every condition and every
[27:20] station found through Christian faith
[27:23] resources for the Triumph of daily
[27:25] living and we're no different this
[27:27] morning it's through the word of God
[27:29] this morning that you'll be successful
[27:31] that you'll have Triumph in the world
[27:33] this morning not in the world itself but
[27:36] in what God does for you in it and um I
[27:39] lost my place again I hope I don't keep
[27:41] Brea beset with difficult suffering
[27:43] trials desasters toss hither Yonder by
[27:46] life's changing
[27:48] circumstances that could not be beaten
[27:50] in every situation they endured as
[27:53] seeing him who was invincible and this
[27:55] goes back to you can take this right
[27:57] back to uh Hebrews the 11th chapter what
[27:59] he's saying here listen to one of these
[28:02] Heroes of Faith I have learned in
[28:05] whatsoever State I am and he's talking
[28:07] about Philippians the fourth chapter
[28:09] here I've learned in whatsoever State I
[28:11] am therein debound in everything in all
[28:14] things have I learned the secret both to
[28:17] be filled and to hungry and both to
[28:19] abound to be in want I can do all things
[28:21] in him who strengthened me so completely
[28:24] that the great Apostle learned the
[28:26] secret at the close of the s looking
[28:28] back he could say I have fought the good
[28:31] fight and this goes back to Timothy in
[28:34] the in the go in Timothy good fight and
[28:36] I have finished the course and I have
[28:39] kept the faith what Christianity meant
[28:41] for Paul it mean it means for us in
[28:44] increasing measure if by faith trust and
[28:48] prayer and communion with Christ will
[28:50] they hold upon the manifold grace of God
[28:52] so he wrote this for soldiers going in
[28:55] to battle in
[28:56] 19441 and 42 well it's no different as
[29:00] you as a as a Christian shoulder this
[29:02] morning that's the same thing that'll
[29:04] make you successful tomorrow or today is
[29:07] putting everything that you are every
[29:09] little bit of yourself into the word of
[29:12] God and into Jesus Christ this morning
[29:15] will make you successful can you do it
[29:17] in yourself no I can't do it in myself
[29:20] but as long as I have Christ abiding in
[29:22] me I can do it through him be successful
[29:25] and I was um I'll just read
[29:28] and I was I'm not it's just a crazy
[29:32] world out
[29:33] there but it's a serious time but I I
[29:37] was noticing if you're not careful
[29:39] there's a spirit that'll put you asleep
[29:41] in the age that we're in it'll put you
[29:44] totally asleep and the things that are
[29:46] going on won't mean anything to you but
[29:49] I'll just read what uh in the I'll try
[29:51] not to read this whole chapter I know I
[29:53] read a lot in the beginning was the word
[29:55] and the Word was with God and the Word
[29:57] was God God and the same in the
[29:59] beginning with God all things were made
[30:01] by him and without him was not anything
[30:04] made that was made and it's no different
[30:06] today for us everything that we are is
[30:09] in him this
[30:11] morning and I I'll promise not to reread
[30:14] the same verses time and time again in
[30:16] him was life and the life was the light
[30:18] of men and that's no different for us
[30:20] this morning 2 years ago when John wrote
[30:23] this gospel it's just as effective for
[30:25] us this morning as it was all the way
[30:27] back you have to believe that though I
[30:29] can say that a minister can say that
[30:32] anyone can say that but it has to be
[30:34] made real to you and your heart and life
[30:36] or it doesn't mean anything and uh there
[30:39] was a man sent from God whose name was
[30:42] John and the same came for a witness to
[30:45] Bear witness of the light that all men
[30:47] through him might believe and he was not
[30:49] the light but was sent to Bear witness
[30:51] of the light and that was the true life
[30:54] which lith every man that cometh into
[30:56] the world for he was in the world and
[30:59] the world was made by him and the world
[31:01] knew him not excuse me and that's no
[31:04] different today we have the word of God
[31:05] this morning we have this the very Holy
[31:08] Ghost the presence of God living in
[31:11] hearts of men and women this morning and
[31:14] they still don't see it this morning
[31:15] like they didn't see it 2,000 years ago
[31:18] and I was thinking I was reading I'm I
[31:20] won't read all this I I was in this uh
[31:25] listening to a message this morning but
[31:26] I'll just read a few few more verses and
[31:29] then read what I had in here and then
[31:32] I'll sit down but as I was thinking of
[31:35] everything gone on in the last week in
[31:37] the last months you know I was thinking
[31:40] I was sitting there this morning and I
[31:42] was thinking of when Christ was talking
[31:44] to the Sadducees and the Pharisees and
[31:46] the lawyers and they really couldn't see
[31:49] who he was their religion their thoughts
[31:53] their ideas had so bound them that they
[31:56] couldn't see the truth or the hour that
[31:58] they were in 2,000 years ago and it's no
[32:01] different this morning in our day and
[32:03] age they people are just Bound by their
[32:06] ideas by their thoughts that they can't
[32:09] break through and they can break through
[32:11] but the only way that you can break
[32:13] through is by Jesus Christ getting in
[32:15] your heart and life and making the
[32:17] difference but I'll just I'll uh I lost
[32:20] my place I don't mean to re read all
[32:22] this again and he was the light but the
[32:24] light was sent to Bear witness of the
[32:26] light that was the True Light which lith
[32:28] every man that cometh into the world and
[32:31] he was in the world and the world was
[32:33] made by him and the world knew him he
[32:35] came onto his own and his own received
[32:37] him not and same thing in our day and
[32:39] age he came again and the world didn't
[32:42] receive him again and you see what's
[32:44] going on out there in the world it's the
[32:46] same it's no different you know it
[32:48] wasn't 40 years after this gospel was
[32:52] preached that the second temple was
[32:54] destroyed and the Romans totally
[32:55] destroyed the Jewish Nation
[32:58] and in the 12th verse but as many as
[33:01] received him he gave power to become the
[33:03] sons of God even to them that believe on
[33:06] his name which are not which were born
[33:08] not of blood nor will but of the or of
[33:12] the flesh but of the will of man but of
[33:14] gods and the Word was made flesh and
[33:17] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[33:20] as the glory of the only begotten of the
[33:22] father full of grace but we have it a
[33:24] little bit different this morning you
[33:25] can actually have the presence this
[33:28] morning in your heart and life and I'll
[33:30] just read this quote and then I'll sit
[33:34] down I I promise not to go another 10
[33:36] minutes after what I just said and and I
[33:38] was just listen this is um this there is
[33:41] only one
[33:42] provided only um I'm not reading there's
[33:47] only one way provided by God for
[33:49] anything and that's true this morning
[33:52] there's only one way God has provided
[33:54] for us this morning to be successful and
[33:56] be there on that day and I'll just I'll
[33:59] just read uh there's these three quotes
[34:02] it's 142 in this message down to 144
[34:05] these are one of these old spoken word
[34:07] books that have a concordance at the end
[34:10] at the back of it but I'll just read
[34:12] these three and sit down the accepted
[34:16] they accepted God's provided way he kept
[34:18] the fire off of them there wasn't even a
[34:21] smell of fire on them they went God's in
[34:24] up talking about the Hebrew children
[34:25] there provided way and the wise men that
[34:29] needed accompass to guide them to the
[34:31] newborn babe but God provided a star see
[34:34] they took the star that's all they
[34:36] needed and we have a way we have a star
[34:38] this morning we have guidance this
[34:40] morning and it's the word of God and the
[34:42] message for the hour this
[34:45] morning excuse me here and the world
[34:48] needed a savior God provided a son amen
[34:51] and this this is the quote I was
[34:53] thinking about talking about this
[34:55] morning the church needed power and God
[34:57] provided the Holy Ghost and that's
[34:59] really important this morning it's not a
[35:01] man's idea it's not a man pushing a
[35:05] program or a away the way the Church of
[35:08] God is successful was by the power of
[35:10] the Holy Ghost this
[35:12] morning he didn't provide a book of
[35:14] Ethics he didn't provide a Christian
[35:16] government he provided the holy ghost
[35:19] that was God's provided that's what God
[35:21] provided he never said go up there and
[35:24] study at
[35:26] Jerusalem up there until I get a certain
[35:28] amount of Education in you until you're
[35:30] indoctrinate indoctrinate you and so and
[35:33] so and it's the same way you can you can
[35:36] study all the message books you can
[35:38] study all the books in the Bible but if
[35:41] you don't get that Holy Ghost in you it
[35:43] won't profit you any on that day and so
[35:47] M to you and document and so he said
[35:50] waiting to you and DED with power on
[35:52] high after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[35:54] you and then you shall be my Witnesses
[35:57] in Jerusalem M Samaria in Chicago
[36:00] Illinois and so forth and see all the
[36:02] world that's God's provided witness is
[36:04] the Holy Ghost God didn't provide a book
[36:07] of Ethics he didn't provide a
[36:09] denomination I was thinking this morning
[36:12] and that's true this morning a
[36:14] denomination won't save you an idea
[36:17] won't save you but the Holy Ghost and
[36:19] Jesus Christ will save you this morning
[36:22] brother David or oh brother Josh
[36:38] and let's stand this morning we just
[36:41] have one announcement this morning

[1:15:08] one it says for the law having a shadow
[1:15:11] of good things to come and not the very

[1:15:15] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:15:17] year continually make the comers there
[1:15:19] unto perfect so what we're seeing here
[1:15:22] is God gave him the law he gave him the
[1:15:24] sacrifices
[1:15:26] but there is a fault with them because
[1:15:27] they could not eradicate sin they could
[1:15:30] only cover sin for then would they not
[1:15:33] have ceased to be offered because that
[1:15:35] the worshippers once purged should have
[1:15:37] no more conscience of sin what happens
[1:15:40] friend is when you once purged from your
[1:15:42] evil desires your nature is changed and
[1:15:45] all of a sudden you find out that these
[1:15:47] things you used to desire you don't
[1:15:49] desire them anymore it's an amazing
[1:15:52] thing to go through it is the greatest
[1:15:54] miracle God ever
[1:15:56] performed to take you and I in this
[1:15:59] frail weak Fallen
[1:16:03] condition thank you Jesus and he says I
[1:16:06] want to be one with you I'm going to
[1:16:08] change your nature so I can indwell you
[1:16:12] and you say but I am so weak you know
[1:16:16] what you're doing stumbling over a body
[1:16:19] you're very own I just preach my whole
[1:16:22] Ser go that's the whole
[1:16:26] Point verse three but in those
[1:16:28] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:16:30] made of sins every year for it is not
[1:16:33] possible that the blood of bulls and
[1:16:34] goat should take away sin it only
[1:16:36] covered it it only covered sin that's
[1:16:38] very important he said wherefore when it
[1:16:40] cometh into the world he saith sacrifice
[1:16:43] and offerings thou wouldest not but a
[1:16:45] body hast thou prepared me why because
[1:16:49] those sacrifices weren't enough he had
[1:16:51] to have a body to do what to restore the
[1:16:53] fellowship that had been lost at Eden
[1:16:56] brother and sister the one the main
[1:16:58] purpose God has of everything he's done
[1:17:01] since back before time all the way down
[1:17:04] to this time like the brother said we've
[1:17:05] been hearing about the end time our
[1:17:07] whole life and here we
[1:17:10] are the whole purpose friends was just
[1:17:13] to have fellowship with his
[1:17:16] kids that's the whole thing anytime you
[1:17:18] get your focus off of that you are
[1:17:21] focusing on the wrong thing all he wants
[1:17:24] is your heart that's all don't give him
[1:17:26] anything else don't offer him anything
[1:17:30] else just your heart a body hast thou
[1:17:34] prepared me in burnt offerings and
[1:17:36] sacrifices for sin thou had no pleasure
[1:17:39] he did not have pleasure he said but
[1:17:41] it's what he gave yes he gave him it it
[1:17:43] was to a space fer it to restore a a
[1:17:46] level of Fellowship because sin is what
[1:17:48] what sin is what separates us from God
[1:17:51] it's the only thing sin nothing else all
[1:17:55] right and so what he had to do he had a
[1:17:57] whole plan all the way back from Eden
[1:17:58] all the way up to now he had a whole
[1:18:00] plan and that whole plan is's going to
[1:18:01] go through time and he's going to show
[1:18:03] himself and reveal himself reveal his
[1:18:05] attributes until all the way down at the
[1:18:06] end so we know exactly who he is but
[1:18:09] back during that time he said now I'm
[1:18:10] only going to cover sin the the the
[1:18:12] animal blood is only going to cover sin
[1:18:14] so I can Fellowship you but from a
[1:18:17] distance from a distance it's got to be
[1:18:19] a distance but I had no pleasure in that
[1:18:21] he had to put up with it and we put up
[1:18:23] with it but but but what it was brother
[1:18:25] and sisters he was saying we're going to
[1:18:26] do this for a while that's that
[1:18:27] dispensation but the thing is there's a
[1:18:29] body coming there got a body that I no
[1:18:32] longer have the you cover sin I'm going
[1:18:34] to eradicate sin so I can be one with
[1:18:36] you like you've never had all the way
[1:18:38] back to the time of
[1:18:41] Eden friends if that would drop into our
[1:18:44] hearts right now we would literally go
[1:18:45] through this
[1:18:47] roof oh my just the reality of that and
[1:18:50] not saying you don't know this you don't
[1:18:51] realize it but there's so much layers
[1:18:53] there's so much depth to that Revelation
[1:18:55] that what God wants for you as an
[1:19:00] individual in burnt offerings and
[1:19:02] sacrifices for sin that thou had no
[1:19:04] pleasure then said I lo I come in the
[1:19:09] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:19:11] what he saying it's God's word that I'm
[1:19:13] going to come he said to do thy will oh
[1:19:15] God what is this to do thy will it's
[1:19:17] because he is not going to be he's going
[1:19:19] to be the sinless sacrifice to do his
[1:19:21] will is not to be sin it's not to be
[1:19:24] sinful so brother and sister the way he
[1:19:26] could be our sacrifice because he did
[1:19:27] the will and it's talking about his
[1:19:29] sinlessness and brother and sister when
[1:19:30] you leave that on him you're stumbling
[1:19:33] over your
[1:19:34] body don't you do
[1:19:36] it don't say well he was a sinless one
[1:19:39] so now here I am I'm good to go brother
[1:19:41] and sister you must recognize that you
[1:19:44] also are sinless amen praise the Lord
[1:19:47] that's the trth I tell you what brother
[1:19:49] and sister that just gets all over my
[1:19:53] flesh because I said but I make mistakes
[1:19:56] every day I've been up for what I got
[1:19:57] about five or six or whatever and that's
[1:19:59] what 10 five hours how many how many bad
[1:20:02] thoughts have I had in the last five
[1:20:04] hours how many things have I like
[1:20:06] thought the wrong thing or and I don't
[1:20:08] think I've said too much bad things yet
[1:20:10] but I probably will before the end of
[1:20:11] the day maybe if I'm by myself I
[1:20:18] won't but it's just the
[1:20:21] truth we're going to find out if you can
[1:20:23] if you can conf conf this by the time we
[1:20:25] get done today Lord willing above when
[1:20:27] he said sacrifice and offerings and
[1:20:29] burnt offerings and offering for sin
[1:20:31] thou wouldest not neither had pleasure
[1:20:33] the him which are offered by the law
[1:20:35] then said he lo I come to do thy will oh
[1:20:38] oh God he taketh away the first that he
[1:20:41] may establish the second by the which
[1:20:44] will we are Sanctified through the
[1:20:45] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:48] once for
[1:20:50] all my that's enough friends it's once
[1:20:53] for all that's all it takes you have one
[1:20:56] sacrifice and that blood has never lost
[1:20:58] its power it will never lose its power
[1:21:01] it will put you in a Rapture it will
[1:21:03] take care of every problem that you have
[1:21:05] if you will accept
[1:21:08] it if you will accept it well I accept
[1:21:11] the blood then why are we trying to be
[1:21:13] so legalistic and trying to live such a
[1:21:15] holy life if we think the blood of Jesus
[1:21:17] Christ is what cleanses us and then we
[1:21:19] offer the blood plus our own Holiness
[1:21:21] like the brother said this isn't
[1:21:22] legalism it's love
[1:21:25] and when we can get past all that
[1:21:27] legalistic aspect and realize that it's
[1:21:29] God's completed work on Calvary we can
[1:21:32] walk free from a lot of the stuff that
[1:21:34] kind of binds us
[1:21:36] down amen that's my Foundation now we're
[1:21:39] going to read out of Acts we're going to
[1:21:41] start preaching acts 7 and verse 45 this
[1:21:45] is Stephen right before he got stoned
[1:21:47] he's preaching and he's making him so
[1:21:49] mad he knows he's making him mad he
[1:21:50] probably knows he's about to get killed
[1:21:52] but you know what he did he did it
[1:21:53] anyways because he was called for this
[1:21:56] job this purpose and how we how many
[1:21:58] times has this this this sermon he
[1:22:00] preached how many times has been used
[1:22:02] down through the
[1:22:03] centuries just for us God put it in
[1:22:07] there what a sacrifice he gave so we can
[1:22:08] have this today so he's talking about
[1:22:10] he's talking about Israel he said verse
[1:22:12] 45 which also our fathers that came
[1:22:15] after brought in with Jesus that's
[1:22:16] Joshua into the possession of the
[1:22:18] Gentiles who God dve out before the face
[1:22:21] of our fathers unto the days of David
[1:22:24] and David who found favor before God
[1:22:26] desired to find a tabernacle for the god
[1:22:28] of Jacob but Solomon built him his house
[1:22:31] so what is it was David said you know
[1:22:33] what here he is I got this beautiful
[1:22:35] palace I'm living in we got all this
[1:22:37] going on but he's got his his Temple is
[1:22:40] his tabernac still attend he says let's
[1:22:41] build a house for him and God said okay
[1:22:43] he said but you can't do it you got too
[1:22:45] much blood we'll have Salomon build it
[1:22:46] there's so many types in there we're not
[1:22:48] going to get into all that but Solomon
[1:22:49] buil a magnificent place to live it's
[1:22:52] just one of the most amazing buildings
[1:22:54] of his ever built literally it's just
[1:22:57] because of spirituality that went into
[1:22:58] it how be it now he built him his great
[1:23:01] big wonderful what we call it church
[1:23:04] today right he said how be it the most
[1:23:06] high dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:23:08] hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my
[1:23:11] Throne Earth is my foot still what house
[1:23:14] will you build me sayith the Lord and
[1:23:15] what is the place of my rest so what we
[1:23:18] see here brother and sister is just like
[1:23:20] the law the sacrifices God said yeah go
[1:23:23] ahead and build me this house but let me
[1:23:25] tell you something that ain't my final
[1:23:28] resting place that is not what gives me
[1:23:30] pleasure he could send the same thing he
[1:23:32] did about the sacrifice he said I like
[1:23:35] it Solomon thanks but it gives me no
[1:23:37] pleasure because it just tells me that
[1:23:39] I'm not reached the end what I'm looking
[1:23:40] for yet I'm going to find a place of
[1:23:43] rest not built with hands no man can
[1:23:45] build me a church for living no one can
[1:23:47] give me a religion I can live in I want
[1:23:48] your heart and that's the only thing I'm
[1:23:51] ever going to find pleasure in is when I
[1:23:53] have you your heart individual not as a
[1:23:56] group he don't come in oh I got all you
[1:23:58] no it's you as an individual that he
[1:24:00] wants fellowship with that's all he's
[1:24:03] ever looked
[1:24:05] for that's why we get so discouraged
[1:24:07] because we see well I I'm just not
[1:24:09] worthy to
[1:24:11] be to Fellowship God I'm not worthy of
[1:24:13] this of course you're not worthy get
[1:24:16] over your bad self you're never going to
[1:24:18] be worthy he didn't ask you to be worthy
[1:24:22] he said I am the worthy one I'm the son
[1:24:24] one I'm the one who did God's will now
[1:24:27] you just accept what I did for you and
[1:24:28] quit getting so discouraged when you
[1:24:30] make
[1:24:34] mistakes Heaven is my throne and Earth
[1:24:36] is my foot stol what house will you
[1:24:38] build me sayith the Lord what is the
[1:24:39] place of my rest hath not my hand made
[1:24:42] all these
[1:24:46] things it it's sort of like this it's
[1:24:48] sort of like this uh birthday right and
[1:24:52] so dad has a birthday so
[1:24:55] little Susie wants to get him a birthday
[1:24:57] present but she ain't got no money Daddy
[1:25:00] can I have some money okay here Daddy I
[1:25:03] bought you the birthday present well
[1:25:05] yeah but I gave you the money for
[1:25:09] it that's what we have to offer god well
[1:25:12] we build you as a beautiful Church by
[1:25:13] the way I love this church it's
[1:25:15] beautiful God loves that you did this
[1:25:17] but he gave you to you to build give it
[1:25:19] back to him see what I'm saying so when
[1:25:21] we think we've done something cuz oh we
[1:25:24] go go to church all the time oh
[1:25:27] wow
[1:25:29] let's focus on your purpose Fellowship
[1:25:34] that's what he wants from you now we use
[1:25:37] the church we use all this stuff we do
[1:25:39] to get that Fellowship but recognize
[1:25:40] that he whatever you give back to him he
[1:25:42] already gave it to you right so it's not
[1:25:45] like we're doing some great thing or
[1:25:47] something we're just accepting what he's
[1:25:52] done hath not my hand made all these
[1:25:54] things verse 51 this what we want to get
[1:25:56] to he really tore into him that he said
[1:25:58] ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart
[1:26:01] and ears you do always resist the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost as your fathers did so do
[1:26:10] ye resisting headship why do they resist
[1:26:14] headship headship for their preferred
[1:26:16] religion you can go all the way back
[1:26:19] look what look what Adam did he fell and
[1:26:22] what did he do he offered God a
[1:26:25] religion Cain and Abel Cain comes along
[1:26:28] offers God religion Abel was accepted
[1:26:30] because he offered God blood he offered
[1:26:32] by Revelation he knew what God would
[1:26:34] accept Cain didn't have that Revelation
[1:26:36] he offered the wrong thing but he got
[1:26:37] mad when God wouldn't accept
[1:26:39] it resisting the Holy Ghost all the way
[1:26:43] down through time God has always given
[1:26:45] the word for that day do this do this
[1:26:47] and people some will do it the Believers
[1:26:49] do it but how many people resist it
[1:26:51] because it's not what they want why did
[1:26:53] Cain not do what Abel said what Abel did
[1:26:55] he could have been accepted but he said
[1:26:57] no I am not going to have that kind of
[1:26:58] religion I have my own religion I'm
[1:27:00] going to take my religion and that's the
[1:27:02] same the same attitude people have ever
[1:27:04] since then all the way down to now
[1:27:06] that's why this church is not packed out
[1:27:08] with more people there's plenty of
[1:27:10] people out in church today all around
[1:27:12] this area but you know what they have
[1:27:14] their own religion because they refused
[1:27:15] God's provided way for Fellowship they
[1:27:17] said no God we're going to worship you
[1:27:19] the way I want
[1:27:21] to now let's not go too far out these
[1:27:23] doors cuz there's a lot of us in here
[1:27:25] still have some of those same
[1:27:27] ideas that's why we keep coming to
[1:27:29] church CU this is God provided way to
[1:27:31] expose that devil to expose that false
[1:27:34] religion that hybrid religion and get
[1:27:36] rid of it so you can have what a closer
[1:27:38] relationship with Jesus Christ which is
[1:27:40] all he ever
[1:27:45] wanted what are we doing we want to
[1:27:47] cover our sin you know that's why that's
[1:27:49] why when Jesus came I'm so ahead of
[1:27:50] myself that's why when Jesus came they
[1:27:52] didn't want to accept him because they
[1:27:54] had had the law and that law with those
[1:27:56] sacrifice could cover their sin but it
[1:27:58] didn't have to change their
[1:28:00] nature that's why so many message
[1:28:03] Believers sit in the pews and they
[1:28:04] preach and they sing and they worship
[1:28:06] and they're the most wonderful people in
[1:28:08] the world but they don't want the new
[1:28:10] birth because you got to die to yourself
[1:28:12] and it's got to change your nature and
[1:28:14] so you can sit in a Pew and pretend like
[1:28:16] you're a Believer and really be sincere
[1:28:18] about it but you know what you're just
[1:28:20] never going to come to that place of
[1:28:22] death to yourself because not b I like
[1:28:24] the way I
[1:28:27] am I don't want to change change is very
[1:28:31] difficult for human
[1:28:33] beings well I'm I'm popular with the
[1:28:35] kids I hang out with I'm popular at
[1:28:37] school I don't want to be one of those
[1:28:39] Fanatics and people look at me like I'm
[1:28:40] some crazy person they're not going to
[1:28:42] like me as
[1:28:44] well praise the Lord but I went to The
[1:28:48] Altar and I prayed and I shouted and I
[1:28:50] danced and you didn't change a
[1:28:52] bit that's right that don't change you
[1:28:55] friends your change is when you humble
[1:28:57] yourself and you accept what God said
[1:28:59] about you and you allow him to burn all
[1:29:01] that stuff out of you and you go ahead
[1:29:03] and walk like one of these weird
[1:29:05] Fanatics around
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:09] here that's what God's looking
[1:29:12] for God provided a way for Fellowship
[1:29:15] it's a sacrifice it's that body he
[1:29:17] prepared and that body is still in
[1:29:20] account it's still uh uh what's what I'm
[1:29:22] looking for it still is a effective
[1:29:25] today but Satan causes us to lose focus
[1:29:30] he says focus on your religion focus on
[1:29:32] your Holiness focus on your mistakes
[1:29:34] focus on your ministry focus on all this
[1:29:36] other stuff focus on how many people
[1:29:38] come to church focus on what you're
[1:29:39] doing for the body focus on all these
[1:29:41] other things but don't focus on your
[1:29:43] relationship with
[1:29:44] Christ that scares him when you will
[1:29:48] when you will get rid of all the
[1:29:50] distractions oh my get rid of all the
[1:29:53] distraction actions and all you see all
[1:29:56] you say I just want to see you Jesus
[1:29:58] Christ you're all I need and brother and
[1:30:00] sister you say oh he is all I need and
[1:30:03] when that becomes more than a song but
[1:30:06] your very life you know you're getting
[1:30:08] somewhere with God because nothing else
[1:30:10] matters besides that and you do all the
[1:30:12] rest of the stuff you have to do but
[1:30:14] there's one thing I have desired and
[1:30:16] that's to dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:30:18] not in this church in his
[1:30:21] presence yeah then do everything else
[1:30:24] you want to do enjoy this life but make
[1:30:26] sure Christ is
[1:30:29] first amen cuz Satan will do all he can
[1:30:33] to persuade you to alter God's sacrifice
[1:30:36] to alter his word to alter anything to
[1:30:39] get you distracted on the main
[1:30:42] thing that's all he's trying to do just
[1:30:44] get you to to be on the m and just take
[1:30:46] a little time just stretch I got a
[1:30:48] little bit more time I can enjoy this a
[1:30:50] little bit
[1:30:52] longer okay but do you look around
[1:30:54] lately do you see the signs of their
[1:30:57] tribulation you see the people out there
[1:30:59] they're they're chanting gas to Jews gas
[1:31:02] the Jews death to America these are
[1:31:06] Americans that's the very thing that the
[1:31:08] tribulation period is going to be
[1:31:10] killing everybody off that spirit so if
[1:31:13] you all want to not get born again stick
[1:31:15] around for the tribulation period look
[1:31:16] around you're going to be the
[1:31:20] target you will be the target of those
[1:31:23] people they w't be saying gas the Jews
[1:31:24] are going to say gas those message
[1:31:27] Believers I ain't playing and neither is
[1:31:43] God I'm gonna I'm gonna get way out of
[1:31:45] order here not out of order about what I
[1:31:48] was going to preach let's talk about
[1:31:51] David
[1:31:55] David was a man after God's Own
[1:31:59] Heart and I've heard it said many times
[1:32:02] it's because David could
[1:32:05] repent and I I go along with that to an
[1:32:08] extent and let me explain why when he
[1:32:10] says David is a man after God's Own
[1:32:12] Heart that means he is a heart like God
[1:32:15] according to God's heart God did not
[1:32:17] have to
[1:32:19] repent and so you say well God didn't
[1:32:21] David's heart to repent wasn't like
[1:32:23] God's to repent so there got to be
[1:32:25] something a little deeper than that
[1:32:27] making sense Adam when he made a mistake
[1:32:29] when he fell what did he do he covered
[1:32:31] his sin when David did something wrong
[1:32:34] what did he do he
[1:32:37] repented
[1:32:39] why why did David repent why was such in
[1:32:42] his heart to repent no matter what it
[1:32:44] was he'd humble himself he let the whole
[1:32:46] Kingdom know what the mistakes he made
[1:32:47] Saul didn't have that approach when Saul
[1:32:50] made a mistake he went he he made
[1:32:52] excuses he blamed other people he did
[1:32:55] not repent why
[1:32:56] not because David's heart was like God's
[1:33:00] heart as the as the the heart panth
[1:33:03] after the Waterberg so panth my heart
[1:33:05] after thee Oh Lord when will I appear
[1:33:07] before you why because David his his
[1:33:09] desire was to be in God's presence he
[1:33:11] had that fellowship with God and nothing
[1:33:14] else mattered and he knew when he made a
[1:33:16] mistake when he sinned he was separated
[1:33:18] from God's presence and he had to get
[1:33:20] back in there and it didn't matter how
[1:33:22] humble he had to get he said I've got to
[1:33:25] be in your
[1:33:26] presence that's why he had a heart a
[1:33:29] heart after God the same kind of heart
[1:33:31] why because nothing's going to keep him
[1:33:32] out of God's presence look at Jacob and
[1:33:35] Esau Esau was a good guy he took care of
[1:33:37] his dad he was a a deacon in the church
[1:33:40] he was very sincere you look at him say
[1:33:42] what a wonderful person he
[1:33:44] was but he didn't have a lot of care of
[1:33:47] respect for the god of his his
[1:33:49] grandfather
[1:33:51] Abraham he really didn't care too much
[1:33:54] about that yeah I'm religious that's
[1:33:55] enough for me but what is Jacob's
[1:33:58] approach Jacob said I will lie I will
[1:34:01] cheat I will steal I will do whatever it
[1:34:04] takes but I'm going to know this God of
[1:34:06] my grandfather
[1:34:08] Abraham God had respect to that he said
[1:34:11] that's just like me I will do anything I
[1:34:15] have to to be in your
[1:34:17] presence I will I will humble myself I
[1:34:21] will come to Earth in the body of a man
[1:34:23] I will be tortured I will be beat I will
[1:34:26] die I will become sinned I will go to
[1:34:28] hell but nothing is GNA keep you out of
[1:34:31] my presence little
[1:34:34] bride you know what he's saying to you
[1:34:37] right now he's saying as a heart pth out
[1:34:39] of the waterbrook so pth my soul after
[1:34:41] my little bride he has the same attitude
[1:34:44] David had he has the same attitude you
[1:34:46] Believers had is that nothing is going
[1:34:48] to stop me from fellowshipping with
[1:34:52] you think about
[1:34:54] that you think oh I'm seeking God I'm
[1:34:56] just I'm just praying I'm just
[1:34:59] hoping you're not giving anything back
[1:35:01] to him he ain't give to you if you have
[1:35:03] a desire for him it's cuz he put that
[1:35:05] desire in there if you have a longing
[1:35:08] for God he put that longing in there and
[1:35:10] nothing can take it out of there if it's
[1:35:12] anchored in there because it comes from
[1:35:14] the seed that was put in there before
[1:35:16] the foundation of the world
[1:35:24] that's his attitude towards
[1:35:26] you then what are you going to offer him
[1:35:29] oh well God I prayed 30 minutes
[1:35:31] yesterday and I read my Bible for two
[1:35:34] chapters you see where religion gets
[1:35:37] really
[1:35:38] lame empty it's no wonder so many people
[1:35:42] are just looking for this and looking
[1:35:44] for some kind of entertainment running
[1:35:46] here and running into that because all
[1:35:48] we have so much is just not all we have
[1:35:50] but so much we offer is just
[1:35:52] religion it's just
[1:35:55] religion God said I have no pleasure in
[1:35:57] your
[1:35:58] religion why are you living that way
[1:36:02] what's the purpose well I'm doing
[1:36:04] right friend is oh my
[1:36:07] goodness friend if you're only doing
[1:36:09] right just because it's the right thing
[1:36:11] to do you need to fall in love with
[1:36:12] Jesus
[1:36:14] Christ because all you have is an empty
[1:36:17] legalist
[1:36:21] religion my
[1:36:25] look at look what God does he sends
[1:36:27] preachers he sends your mom and dad to
[1:36:29] raise your he sends preach and what's he
[1:36:30] doing he's almost begging you he
[1:36:33] repent repent and what happens we have
[1:36:36] besetting sins we have addiction we have
[1:36:38] things we can't get over and we go and
[1:36:40] we repent and we pray you know get back
[1:36:41] in the presence of God and then we do it
[1:36:43] again and we do it again and and three
[1:36:44] years later we're still having this
[1:36:46] problem and we get to the point like I
[1:36:47] just I just feel like such a hypocrite I
[1:36:50] just feel like SE I I just don't know
[1:36:51] what to do I trying to overcome this I'm
[1:36:53] trying to overcome I just can't get over
[1:36:55] I have this bad attitude I I keep doing
[1:36:57] this I keep doing that and God is saying
[1:37:00] repent but I just repented yesterday of
[1:37:03] this I feel like a hypocrite repent
[1:37:04] again please he's begging you repent why
[1:37:07] because he wants to be in your presence
[1:37:10] he wants to have fellowship with you and
[1:37:12] he can't do that over sin so all he's
[1:37:14] saying is just keep repenting keep
[1:37:16] coming back to The Well of Grace my
[1:37:19] Mercy endures forever it will not run
[1:37:21] out all I need you to do is just keep
[1:37:24] repenting until you get it
[1:37:33] right what keeps bringing you back
[1:37:36] because you have to be in his presence
[1:37:38] because there's something about it that
[1:37:39] just keeps drawing you back but I feel
[1:37:41] so bad I have this weakness brother and
[1:37:44] sister can let me just give you
[1:37:45] something this is some how you overcome
[1:37:47] it when it becomes love when your love
[1:37:49] for God is so strong that it's stronger
[1:37:52] than that Temptation say is throwing at
[1:37:54] you when your love your need to be in
[1:37:55] his presence is so great that when Satan
[1:37:57] comes and knocks on your door hey would
[1:37:59] you like this you like no I don't want
[1:38:01] that anymore lock the go away I have no
[1:38:03] need for you anymore because I have
[1:38:05] found a greater satisfaction something
[1:38:07] that you and your worldly attractions
[1:38:09] can't even
[1:38:12] touch brother and sister I hope you know
[1:38:15] what I'm talking about because if not
[1:38:17] you got to get there friends that
[1:38:18] presence is your satisfaction that
[1:38:21] presence is so amazing that when when
[1:38:23] Satan comes to off you this off you that
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:25] say no you say I'm not there yet well
[1:38:30] this is what you do
[1:38:32] friends you fall on this Stone we're
[1:38:35] going to talk about we'll get there you
[1:38:38] humble yourself you know how you be
[1:38:40] humble oh I'm trying to be so humble God
[1:38:42] I'm so weak I'm I'm so weak I'm I'm just
[1:38:45] just a miserable Sinner and I that's not
[1:38:50] humble the way you be humble is to be
[1:38:52] honest
[1:38:54] you know what we pray so many times God
[1:38:56] I'm trying so hard to overcome this I'm
[1:38:58] just trying so hard and I'm doing all he
[1:39:00] said that's not what I ask
[1:39:02] for first of all just accept what I did
[1:39:04] for
[1:39:07] you and then be honest with
[1:39:10] him I'm G get really a little bit kick
[1:39:14] in the gut
[1:39:18] here the reason we have these besetting
[1:39:22] sins that things the addictions whatever
[1:39:24] you want to call them the things we
[1:39:25] stumble over our weaknesses is because
[1:39:28] we don't love God enough
[1:39:34] yet there's your
[1:39:36] humility instead of God I'm trying so
[1:39:38] hard to overcome God I don't love you
[1:39:42] enough
[1:39:46] yet try that on for
[1:39:49] size that hurts but I love God I love it
[1:39:52] with all my heart heart then why are we
[1:39:54] still going to this thing and going to
[1:39:56] that thing and going to that it's your
[1:39:58] choice it's your choice he said but the
[1:40:01] Temptation is so strong yeah because you
[1:40:05] don't love him enough otherwise all
[1:40:07] you're doing is dos and don'ts and I
[1:40:10] quit doing this brother Phil I feel so
[1:40:12] much better that's wonderful I'm glad
[1:40:14] you quit that but why why did you quit
[1:40:17] it so you can live holy enough so you
[1:40:20] don't feel like a hypocrite coming to
[1:40:21] church or because you love Jesus Christ
[1:40:23] chist so much that that thing lost its
[1:40:25] attraction to
[1:40:28] you there is the difference between
[1:40:30] going in the bride and stay in here for
[1:40:32] the tribulation
[1:40:38] period let's let's pretend I'm going to
[1:40:40] pretend a little
[1:40:41] bit I get
[1:40:44] married and I come home from work and my
[1:40:47] wife's not there she left me a note she
[1:40:50] said I'm hanging out with Bob
[1:40:54] Bob he's your old
[1:40:57] boyfriend well you know we're just going
[1:40:59] to do dinner not going to do anything I
[1:41:01] me I'm not going to kiss him
[1:41:04] probably what kind of a husband what am
[1:41:08] I going to be thinking about my
[1:41:12] wife and yet when we go and do these
[1:41:16] things we know we're shouldn't be doing
[1:41:18] it's exactly what we're doing to Jesus
[1:41:21] Christ we claim him as our husband but
[1:41:24] we're still out here flirting around
[1:41:26] with our old
[1:41:31] boyfriends but you know what kind of
[1:41:33] husband he is he gets on the phone he
[1:41:36] says honey please come home I'll forgive
[1:41:41] you I'll forgive you come
[1:41:45] home I'm longing for you I can never
[1:41:49] quit loving you come home friends can't
[1:41:53] you trust a guy like
[1:41:55] that can't you trust can't you love a
[1:41:58] guy like that he'll do anything for you
[1:42:00] hasn't he proved himself he hasn't he
[1:42:01] proven that he will do anything look
[1:42:03] what he's brought you
[1:42:05] through what we need friend is our love
[1:42:08] perfected not our
[1:42:10] Holiness not our Doctrine not our church
[1:42:13] going not our tithe pan we don't need
[1:42:15] those things perfected we need our love
[1:42:18] perfected how does that happen brother
[1:42:20] and sister because he takes through
[1:42:22] hardships and through every hardship if
[1:42:24] you have the right attitude you come out
[1:42:26] on the other side and your love is
[1:42:27] greater than it was Hallelujah every
[1:42:30] time that he puts you through something
[1:42:32] he allows something to happen is so that
[1:42:35] afterwards he will have a closer
[1:42:37] relationship with you than you did
[1:42:38] before that's what every trial is about
[1:42:41] every time you've been sick every grief
[1:42:43] every sorrow every loss every stumble
[1:42:45] that you did is so that he could prove
[1:42:47] to you how much he loves
[1:42:50] you he's wooing you come to me can't you
[1:42:53] see how much I love you can't you see
[1:42:54] that I'm faithful I have never failed
[1:42:56] you you can find no fault in me find
[1:42:59] fault in him if you can but you can't
[1:43:03] he's talking taking you through
[1:43:05] everything that you've been through
[1:43:07] every hardship every fear all the trauma
[1:43:09] you've experienced all the abuse you've
[1:43:11] experienced God is bringing you to a
[1:43:13] place that said hav not I taken care of
[1:43:16] you through it
[1:43:17] all show me where I've been unfaithful
[1:43:20] show me where I haven't taken care of
[1:43:22] your situation
[1:43:26] oh man oh Lord Jesus let me tell you
[1:43:30] what Jesus the the whole purpose of
[1:43:34] Jesus
[1:43:35] existence is to restore Fellowship
[1:43:38] between God and man you give him a
[1:43:41] purpose for
[1:43:44] being without us he had no purpose he
[1:43:47] had no reason to come he had no reason
[1:43:48] to die on the cross he has no purpose of
[1:43:51] coming in that body that body prepared
[1:43:53] except for you thank you Lord that's the
[1:43:57] only thing that's the only thing that
[1:43:58] gives him purpose he did not come just
[1:43:59] to enjoy the the beautiful Outdoors he
[1:44:01] didn't come just to walk the mountains
[1:44:03] he didn't come just to hang out and eat
[1:44:04] and drink and be married he came because
[1:44:06] he said I need a fellowship with you the
[1:44:09] individual
[1:44:11] person don't try to hide in the Pew in a
[1:44:13] group don't try to well I'm just part of
[1:44:15] the group here I just kind of listen to
[1:44:17] that no no no no you got to have it
[1:44:20] individually friend it's not an emotion
[1:44:27] it's not an
[1:44:29] emotion this world has taught us that
[1:44:33] emotions are our
[1:44:37] truth what the brother was talking about
[1:44:40] your emotions are not the
[1:44:42] truth you could say well brother Phil I
[1:44:45] really want this relationship I'm going
[1:44:46] to really get sincere I'm just really
[1:44:49] no no you don't I mean you might try
[1:44:53] but that ain't going to get it that's
[1:44:54] just more
[1:44:56] religion all the effort look how sincere
[1:44:58] you've been some of I the sincerity
[1:45:01] sometime amazing I've seen the most
[1:45:03] sincere people and they're completely
[1:45:07] wrong sincerely wrong those people who
[1:45:10] are protesting against Israel they're
[1:45:12] very sincere they're willing to go to
[1:45:18] jail God don't care about that sincerity
[1:45:21] that don't mean anything to him
[1:45:23] you know how you get sincere is you fall
[1:45:25] in love with him that brings
[1:45:28] sincerity that's how you do
[1:45:30] it all right let me move
[1:45:33] on now we see brother brand speaking he
[1:45:35] now we see we are building a building
[1:45:38] not a wall the builders want to take a
[1:45:41] line of blocks and just go straight down
[1:45:44] any Builder can build that it takes a
[1:45:46] real matched mechanic to turn the corner
[1:45:49] when you got to cut the corner that's
[1:45:50] the time it shows whether you're really
[1:45:52] a stonem or not when you can turn the
[1:45:54] corner with it and keep the continuity
[1:45:57] of the rest of the building but turn the
[1:45:59] corner now it's on these Corners is when
[1:46:02] troubles come the builders want to keep
[1:46:05] building on down but we're not building
[1:46:06] a building but I'm building a wall but a
[1:46:10] building so what we have here brother
[1:46:12] and sister is down through time and we
[1:46:14] can see it through the the Bible we see
[1:46:16] it uh in the church ages when God gives
[1:46:19] a word for an a day for that age and
[1:46:21] they walk down there and they're going
[1:46:23] along and you know it's a new word and
[1:46:24] they're fine and then what happens it
[1:46:26] starts becoming conventional wisdom
[1:46:29] conventional conventional religion and
[1:46:31] they get relaxed and they say well yeah
[1:46:33] let's go down and offer our sheep for
[1:46:35] sacrifice and what happens it just
[1:46:37] becomes a dos and don'ts instead of a
[1:46:39] relationship with God and so what God
[1:46:41] does he comes he says it's time to turn
[1:46:43] a
[1:46:44] corner and they
[1:46:47] resist and that's where the Trouble
[1:46:49] Comes because we get comfortable we
[1:46:51] don't like change
[1:46:53] amen we're comfortable in our religion
[1:46:57] and God said anytime you get comfortable
[1:46:59] in your religion you're lukewarm your
[1:47:03] backslid and you don't love me the way
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:07] should that's what happened down we we
[1:47:10] can look at the church ages the you know
[1:47:12] the the word came to Paul and all those
[1:47:14] people back there but then it went off
[1:47:15] into the first church age and they
[1:47:17] started hybriding the word and they're
[1:47:18] going down building the church and then
[1:47:20] God says Let's Make a Difference here we
[1:47:21] got to make a move and so Luther comes
[1:47:23] along and they take a left turn a right
[1:47:25] turn whatever and they turn and go this
[1:47:27] way but all those people who refused to
[1:47:29] walk with Luther they kept on building
[1:47:30] the wall and that wall goes all the way
[1:47:33] down they fall into the pit they're
[1:47:34] Blinded By the Light that was in Luther
[1:47:37] and so what happens lutherans are going
[1:47:39] along and they're the Bride of the age
[1:47:40] they're walking in all the light they
[1:47:42] see and then all of a sudden God comes
[1:47:43] along says okay now you got two you're
[1:47:46] so backslid you don't you're you're you
[1:47:48] lost your heart you don't love me
[1:47:50] anymore the way you should so I got to
[1:47:52] show more light I got to turn the corner
[1:47:53] and so the next Reformation come along
[1:47:55] and there's Wesley and the Methodist and
[1:47:57] they turn the corner but the Lutheran
[1:47:58] keep on going down straight and then
[1:48:00] Pentecost comes the same way and they
[1:48:02] keep going like and they got
[1:48:06] light and they think this is it they
[1:48:08] think this is the last move because they
[1:48:10] had the restoration of the gifts they
[1:48:11] think it's the Total Restoration but
[1:48:13] then God sends us a prophet he got a
[1:48:15] message and the Pentecost will say no
[1:48:17] I'm going to keep going this way because
[1:48:18] I don't like what you're doing
[1:48:25] Psalms 118 it says the stone which the
[1:48:27] builders refuse to become The Headstone
[1:48:29] of the corner this is the Lord's doing
[1:48:31] it is marvelous in our eyes that word
[1:48:33] marvelous means wonderful surpassing be
[1:48:36] to be Beyond one's power be difficult to
[1:48:39] do difficult to understand why because
[1:48:43] we got to the place we start leaning to
[1:48:45] our own understanding we have our own
[1:48:47] religion and God said I'm doing
[1:48:48] something different he said that don't
[1:48:50] make sense according to my religion
[1:48:51] that's not making according to what I
[1:48:53] believe he said yeah I know that's why
[1:48:55] it's marvelous it's my doing and it's
[1:48:57] not yours it's a body that no handmade
[1:49:00] it's my body and I'm the Constructor of
[1:49:02] this thing my building I'm building
[1:49:06] it Isaiah said therefore thus sayith the
[1:49:09] Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a
[1:49:11] foundation a stone a tried Stone oh it's
[1:49:14] been proven a precious Cornerstone a
[1:49:18] sure Foundation what is it it's the word
[1:49:20] for the day made manifest and you can
[1:49:23] rest your soul on
[1:49:25] it he that believeth shall not make
[1:49:28] haste oh my you you can rest on it you
[1:49:32] you you he's he's faithful to his word
[1:49:35] friends that's what he's
[1:49:41] saying every corner friends God turns
[1:49:45] Corners is for a place to increase
[1:49:48] Fellowship to get get closer to his
[1:49:51] people he doesn't just turn a COR just
[1:49:53] for the fun of it he's building a
[1:49:54] building where he can rest and every
[1:49:56] time he turns the corner it's so that
[1:49:58] the people can have a closer walk with
[1:50:00] him so he can have a closer walk with
[1:50:02] them and people love their religion more
[1:50:04] than they love him and so they stay in
[1:50:05] their own wall and keep going said I
[1:50:07] don't need to
[1:50:08] change I don't need to change it's just
[1:50:11] human nature instead of an opportunity
[1:50:13] to increase Fellowship they just
[1:50:16] stay in their old religion
[1:50:24] we're going to look at this how this
[1:50:26] played out in John
[1:50:29] 1522 Jesus is speaking to these
[1:50:33] folks if I had not come and spoken unto
[1:50:36] them they had not had
[1:50:40] sin but now they have no cloak for their
[1:50:43] sin what's he saying he's saying there's
[1:50:47] Pharisees the Levites the priests all
[1:50:49] these folks and they were walking in the
[1:50:51] light that they had and they were just
[1:50:54] fine they were Believers if they would
[1:50:57] have died in that they would have gone
[1:50:59] to heaven but he said then I come along
[1:51:02] and I spoke the word for their day for
[1:51:05] the new age to turn the corner getting
[1:51:07] them out of Law and into
[1:51:09] Grace that's exactly what he said and I
[1:51:12] came and I told him the right word the
[1:51:14] word for the day but they refused to
[1:51:16] walk in it now they have no excuse for
[1:51:19] their sin anymore if I had not come they
[1:51:22] would have had no sin but because he
[1:51:25] came now they had sin but then he
[1:51:28] doesn't go on he that hateth me hateth
[1:51:30] my father
[1:51:33] also wait a minute he said they hated
[1:51:36] him because they didn't follow his
[1:51:40] religion he said well that's kind of
[1:51:43] strong isn't it I mean just because you
[1:51:44] don't follow that religion no it's hate
[1:51:48] we're going to see more about that then
[1:51:49] he goes on to say this verse 24 if I had
[1:51:52] not done among them The Works which none
[1:51:54] other man did they had not had sin now
[1:51:57] they have both seen and hated both me
[1:51:59] and my father so he said I came and I
[1:52:00] spoke to them and then the works I did
[1:52:03] backed up and witnessed that I was
[1:52:05] telling them the truth and they still
[1:52:07] hated me because they love their
[1:52:08] religion more than they love the
[1:52:11] light they wanted to walk on in darkness
[1:52:14] instead of turning the corner into more
[1:52:16] light if you go to John 3 it says this
[1:52:19] for God so loved the world he gave his
[1:52:21] only begotten son that whosoever whoever
[1:52:22] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:52:23] have everlasting life for God sent not
[1:52:26] his son into the world to condemn the
[1:52:27] world but that the world through him
[1:52:29] might be saved he said I'm giving you an
[1:52:31] opportunity to be saved he didn't come
[1:52:33] to condemn he didn't come to send people
[1:52:35] to hell he came to say it's time to turn
[1:52:37] the corner it's time to have a close
[1:52:38] relationship with me come with me follow
[1:52:41] the new light turn the
[1:52:45] corner and this is the condemnation that
[1:52:48] light is comeing to the world and Men
[1:52:50] loved Darkness rather than light
[1:52:54] because they are fornicators and
[1:52:55] drunkers and murderers no no no they
[1:52:59] were holy
[1:53:01] people because their deeds were
[1:53:05] evil now there's your
[1:53:08] Holiness those priests and all sudden
[1:53:10] run out and start sleeping around and
[1:53:13] and doing all kinds of horrible stuff
[1:53:15] stealing and all that no they still live
[1:53:17] that very holy life but they refus to
[1:53:19] walk in the new light why because they
[1:53:22] Deeds were evil and that darkness that
[1:53:24] light exposed the deadness of their
[1:53:27] religion it exposed the deadness it's
[1:53:30] time for more light it's time for more
[1:53:32] word to be manifest and he proved that
[1:53:35] by his words his his his deeds backed up
[1:53:37] witnessed his true and yet they love
[1:53:39] Darkness rather than they love light for
[1:53:43] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[1:53:44] light neither cometh to the light L his
[1:53:46] deeds should be reproved but he that
[1:53:48] doeth truth come to the light that his
[1:53:50] needs may be made manifest that they are
[1:53:51] wrought in God god brother and sister
[1:53:53] that's why we come to church that's why
[1:53:54] we Fellowship that's why we do the
[1:53:56] things we do to serve God because we
[1:53:58] want to see we want the light to witness
[1:54:00] that it's it's in me that word is living
[1:54:03] through me I need that witness in myself
[1:54:05] I need that light because I can sit on a
[1:54:07] Pew I can say Amen at everything the
[1:54:09] preacher preaches I can shout I can sing
[1:54:11] I can worship I can live a good life but
[1:54:13] I need a
[1:54:15] witness I need the word to be proven
[1:54:17] it's got to be more than just the words
[1:54:19] I say it's so important what you say but
[1:54:21] the holy Spirit has to witness that what
[1:54:24] I'm saying is actually happening cuz I
[1:54:26] have come to the light and if it's not
[1:54:28] there I need that exposed so I can get
[1:54:30] rid of all that
[1:54:31] Darkness I need to get rid of all the
[1:54:33] darkness I got to get rid of everything
[1:54:35] in there that's not light especially in
[1:54:37] this age because you have no excuse in
[1:54:39] this age to keep any of that false
[1:54:41] religion in fact if you keep it and you
[1:54:43] keep HB reading the word you will not go
[1:54:45] into Rapture cuz he will only marry a
[1:54:48] virgin
[1:54:50] bride Hallelujah and this is your
[1:54:52] privilege to be in the the bride in this
[1:54:54] age when all the culmination of
[1:54:56] everything comes together and you have
[1:54:58] the opportunity to be one with him like
[1:55:01] no other age has
[1:55:08] had the pentec example Pentecost they
[1:55:13] had they had camped down on that that
[1:55:16] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:55:18] the Holy Ghost you're born again right
[1:55:21] well the prophet came WR and said that's
[1:55:22] not
[1:55:23] true what did he do he show light the
[1:55:26] word it wasn't the prophet it was the
[1:55:27] word show light on the error of that
[1:55:31] Doctrine what did they do brother Bram
[1:55:34] is a false
[1:55:36] prophet we're not going to listen to
[1:55:38] that we got all these people we have the
[1:55:40] sins we have our our assembly our
[1:55:42] Council come together and we agree
[1:55:44] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:55:46] the baptis Holy
[1:55:49] Ghost building their wall
[1:55:53] fall into the pit blinded by that light
[1:55:55] because they love their religion more
[1:55:57] than they love the
[1:55:59] light and Jesus said they hated the
[1:56:03] light right well we don't hate you we
[1:56:05] just disagree with you no it's
[1:56:08] hatred that's a strong word but I didn't
[1:56:11] say it see because when the new light
[1:56:13] comes the old light goes
[1:56:16] out and they prioritize their religion
[1:56:19] over Fellowship
[1:56:24] it's so much easier to
[1:56:25] do so much easier than to die to
[1:56:29] yourself than to humble yourself every
[1:56:31] day I'm a good person brother Phil I
[1:56:34] follow the
[1:56:35] rules so did
[1:56:40] Esau all right I'm getting I'm gonna get
[1:56:43] done here in a second so he said well
[1:56:45] how does this apply to us what's this
[1:56:47] all about stumbling over a body well
[1:56:50] they stumbled over the body of Christ
[1:56:52] because because they could not accept
[1:56:53] that he was their sacrifice because they
[1:56:54] love their animal sacrifices they
[1:56:56] stumble over that you as a you as a man
[1:56:59] make yourself God let me just read this
[1:57:02] again I and my father are one then the
[1:57:04] Jews took up stones again to Stone him
[1:57:06] why because you make yourself equal God
[1:57:08] he said they said for good works we
[1:57:10] Stone thee not but for blasphemy because
[1:57:12] that thou being a man makest thyself God
[1:57:15] Jesus didn't make himself God God made
[1:57:16] him
[1:57:18] God right
[1:57:22] John 17:11 Jesus said now I am no more
[1:57:25] in the world but these are in the world
[1:57:27] I come to thee Holy Father keep through
[1:57:30] thine own name Those whom thou Hast
[1:57:32] given me that they may be one as we
[1:57:36] are so Jesus is not only saying I and my
[1:57:39] father are one he says I and my kids are
[1:57:42] one I and my bride are one make us one
[1:57:45] like we are like I and the the father
[1:57:48] and him are one make us one the same way
[1:57:51] can you keep going me on
[1:57:53] this John 17:20 says neither pray I for
[1:57:56] these alone but also for them which
[1:57:58] Shall Believe on them through their word
[1:58:00] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:58:02] art in me and I in thee that they also
[1:58:05] may be one in us that the world may
[1:58:08] believe that thou has sent
[1:58:10] me you hear what he's praying he said I
[1:58:13] want to be one with them the way I'm one
[1:58:16] with the
[1:58:17] father and if you're one with him the
[1:58:19] way he is with the father and he said I
[1:58:21] am my father are one what's your
[1:58:26] testimony do you dare say
[1:58:28] it I and my father are
[1:58:32] one you make yourself God you make
[1:58:35] yourself equal with Jesus Stone
[1:58:39] me that's the thing that wanted to Stone
[1:58:42] Jesus over and yet the revealed word for
[1:58:45] this day has restored us to that very
[1:58:48] thing that he was praying for and yet we
[1:58:50] want to sit around and conf we're some
[1:58:52] kind of Sinners or something no you're
[1:58:56] not I'm not talking about this old flesh
[1:58:58] of course this old flesh is but the real
[1:59:00] you the real you that's been born again
[1:59:03] is in eternity right now it's already
[1:59:06] been raptured it's just waiting for the
[1:59:08] rest of this to catch up with it it's
[1:59:11] sinless your soul is sinless before God
[1:59:14] right now because he has married with
[1:59:16] you he's one with you and you and that
[1:59:19] and the the Holy Spirit and you and that
[1:59:20] Soul have become one one and your
[1:59:22] testimony is I and my father are
[1:59:25] one if you dare confess
[1:59:28] it I have a hard
[1:59:31] time when I look at myself when I
[1:59:34] Stumble over this
[1:59:37] body how dare you say you're equal with
[1:59:40] Jesus Christ I'm not talking about him
[1:59:41] being God and all that I'm talking about
[1:59:44] him and I are
[1:59:45] brothers and he's not ashamed to call me
[1:59:47] his brother because we're the same
[1:59:50] family I'm just as Eternal as as he is
[1:59:52] I'm just as much a Son of God as Jesus
[1:59:54] Christ
[1:59:56] is brother Phil that's really strong who
[1:59:59] do you think you are why did the message
[2:00:01] come in this day is to produce this kind
[2:00:04] of a
[2:00:05] bride Hallelujah this is what it's for
[2:00:09] not just so we can have a good bunch of
[2:00:10] people sitting in church just being a
[2:00:12] nice bunch of people we've had that all
[2:00:14] the way down through time he said no
[2:00:16] this great in this day in this age this
[2:00:18] word is going to come to such a
[2:00:20] fulfillment that I am going to be so one
[2:00:22] with them I'm actually going to Rapture
[2:00:24] them off the earth now how do you think
[2:00:26] you're going in a Rapture if you don't
[2:00:27] confess who you
[2:00:29] are you confess it you say the word and
[2:00:32] you watch him back it up you say the
[2:00:35] word and you watch that light shine out
[2:00:36] from you and you're going to look at
[2:00:38] yourself and say I cannot believe look
[2:00:40] what's happening to me that's not my
[2:00:42] attitude those are not my words that's
[2:00:44] not my love that's not my Mercy that
[2:00:47] must be someone else inside of me that's
[2:00:49] not fil Bond treger and it's taking
[2:00:51] control
[2:00:52] [Applause]
[2:00:55] oh taking control you said brother Phil
[2:00:58] I need something back let me tell you
[2:00:59] what the prophet said he's talking about
[2:01:01] he's talking about the denominations
[2:01:02] they want to become one all the
[2:01:04] denominations gathered together right he
[2:01:06] said well Jesus pray that we all should
[2:01:08] be one brother Bram says then he also
[2:01:12] said how can you walk together how can
[2:01:14] two walk together L they be
[2:01:17] agreed he said one like he and the
[2:01:20] father are one and the father was the
[2:01:23] word and he was the word made manifest
[2:01:26] he was one with the father
[2:01:29] because he was a manifestation of God's
[2:01:32] promised
[2:01:35] word you are one with the father one you
[2:01:38] are the manifestation of God's promised
[2:01:40] word for the age you live in he said as
[2:01:43] so it is today or any other day yes sir
[2:01:48] that God is one he wants us to be one
[2:01:52] the same way he was one with the father
[2:01:54] he wants to be one with you and that's
[2:01:56] why when you say I and my father are one
[2:01:58] you are not blaspheming you're
[2:02:00] confessing who you
[2:02:03] are a lot of people can say that and
[2:02:06] it's just a Doctrine they believe it's
[2:02:08] just up here you got to get it here so
[2:02:11] you know what you're talking about
[2:02:13] because you say it from your mouth you
[2:02:15] say it from up here and you're going to
[2:02:17] be shown to be a hypocrite because
[2:02:18] people see right through that the life
[2:02:20] you're living is not the life life of
[2:02:22] Jesus
[2:02:23] Christ oh I know it's because I make
[2:02:25] mistakes have you been listening to me
[2:02:28] not because you make mistakes how do you
[2:02:30] react to
[2:02:37] mistakes well if I am the father one I
[2:02:39] don't need to repent okay
[2:02:42] Pharisee yes you do you will be the one
[2:02:45] who repents more than anybody else
[2:02:47] because you cannot stand to be out of
[2:02:49] his presence you cannot stand to allow
[2:02:51] sin to separate you from that present he
[2:02:54] said I am so sorry I am so sorry have
[2:02:56] you ever repented someone they didn't
[2:02:57] even know you did anything wrong I I'll
[2:02:59] just telling myself a little bit I was
[2:03:00] at some restaurant and there without a
[2:03:03] lot of detail I just kind of smart out
[2:03:05] to the person the the worker there she
[2:03:08] never thought about it she's so used to
[2:03:10] being smart I like to I went back to Hey
[2:03:12] listen I'm sorry what you said she's
[2:03:13] looking at me
[2:03:15] what I don't care I knew I was supposed
[2:03:17] to do that right because that was
[2:03:18] grieving
[2:03:19] me he say is that it is that all it
[2:03:22] takes well it's a
[2:03:26] start it's a start you got to you got to
[2:03:29] get rid of that sin and those those all
[2:03:31] that junk out of the way so God and you
[2:03:32] can have that fellowship and then you
[2:03:34] start growing in love that's the thing
[2:03:36] to grow in friends grow grow everything
[2:03:39] grow everything but make sure love is
[2:03:41] the main thing that's the core to the
[2:03:44] whole thing because it's going to take
[2:03:45] perfect love to go into
[2:03:47] Rapture well how do you do that just
[2:03:50] surrender yourself to God and let him do
[2:03:51] it
[2:03:52] you can't you can't do it well I'm going
[2:03:54] to start loving everybody brother Phil
[2:03:55] well you should have been doing that
[2:03:56] anyways but that's not what I'm talking
[2:03:58] about it ain't human love it's the love
[2:04:00] of God projecting through you and you
[2:04:02] cannot control that you cannot do that
[2:04:04] you cannot express it you cannot control
[2:04:06] it it's him doing it through you but he
[2:04:08] needs a surrendered
[2:04:11] vessel surrendered vessel and it's
[2:04:15] today do you stumble over this
[2:04:19] body because what he can say we can read
[2:04:21] that that same scripture we read he said
[2:04:24] sacrifices and offerings had no pleasure
[2:04:28] denominations and organized religion I
[2:04:30] had no pleasure I put up with it that's
[2:04:32] all they had but a body I have
[2:04:36] prepared a body I prepared you know
[2:04:38] where that body is I'm looking at that's
[2:04:41] right the body he has prepared in this
[2:04:44] day is
[2:04:47] you it's you can you accept that's who
[2:04:50] you are he said that's talking about
[2:04:52] Jesus exactly that's what I'm telling
[2:04:54] you you and him have become one the
[2:04:57] Christ and bride she has become him you
[2:05:00] have become so Christ in this day you're
[2:05:02] not Jesus Christ the one who died on the
[2:05:04] cross but that same spirit in you is
[2:05:06] fulfilling the word for your day
[2:05:07] manifesting the word for your day it
[2:05:09] manifests the word through that body and
[2:05:11] his day and that made him one with the
[2:05:13] father it's manifesting the word for
[2:05:15] this day that makes you one with the
[2:05:16] father he that was the alpha expression
[2:05:19] of Jesus Christ in that body this is is
[2:05:21] the Omega expression in this
[2:05:24] body these are the people who are going
[2:05:27] in the
[2:05:29] Rapture these are the
[2:05:31] people brother Ram said this I think in
[2:05:34] the building today of the spiritual
[2:05:35] house that God worships in I think
[2:05:37] that's been a great big failure today
[2:05:39] among the Bel the builders we try to
[2:05:41] build it out of man-made material
[2:05:43] education seminaries scholarship we try
[2:05:46] to build upon education denominations
[2:05:49] all these things will not work as long
[2:05:50] as we have not accepted that Odd Stone
[2:05:53] that peculiar
[2:05:58] Stone as the building begin to
[2:06:00] materialize they realize that the hole
[2:06:02] that was left the Odd Stone fit it to
[2:06:05] the dot that's where the spiritual
[2:06:07] Builders today that's why the bride
[2:06:09] building of Christ is not ready for the
[2:06:12] bridegroom the bride building of Christ
[2:06:15] his place of rest the place were not
[2:06:17] made with hands the bride building he's
[2:06:19] putting this together but the builders
[2:06:21] are taking the word and building a
[2:06:24] wall God sent a prophet we believe what
[2:06:27] he said God sent a prophet we believe
[2:06:29] what he said God sent a prophet and fall
[2:06:31] into the ditch because they didn't keep
[2:06:33] turning corners and brother and sister
[2:06:34] this is you personally turning Corners
[2:06:36] in your life because every time God
[2:06:38] comes and reveals something to you
[2:06:39] recognize hey there's a new brick
[2:06:41] there's a new corner I got to walk more
[2:06:43] here I got to walk more here because
[2:06:44] he's not doing this as a group anymore
[2:06:46] he's doing this as an individual in your
[2:06:48] life and you can see more Christ and
[2:06:50] more Christ and you just keep turning
[2:06:52] corners and you're coming closer and
[2:06:54] closer and those corners getting quicker
[2:06:55] and quicker and you're getting dead and
[2:06:57] dead and all of a sudden you're going to
[2:06:59] realize hey I'm not even on the earth
[2:07:00] anymore I've taken off out of here why
[2:07:02] cuz you kept walking in the light as it
[2:07:04] was shown to
[2:07:05] you he said well my family doesn't see
[2:07:10] it okay so you love your family more
[2:07:14] than
[2:07:14] God there's an
[2:07:17] idol well people in my church think I'm
[2:07:20] I've gone off The Rocker they think I'm
[2:07:22] wrong okay there's your
[2:07:26] idol are you willing to stand by
[2:07:29] yourself on what God told
[2:07:31] you
[2:07:36] personally it's it's an individual
[2:07:44] individual that's why the bride building
[2:07:45] of Christ is not ready for the
[2:07:47] bridegroom is because the builders has
[2:07:48] rejected the Chief Cornerstone listen to
[2:07:51] this
[2:07:51] that was laid on the DAT of pentec day
[2:07:53] of Pentecost which is the baptism of the
[2:07:56] holy
[2:07:57] spirit it's the new birth friends that's
[2:08:00] what they're rejecting because you got
[2:08:02] to
[2:08:03] change and you can't do it
[2:08:06] yourself you can't change on your own
[2:08:09] all you can do is hear the word of God
[2:08:12] let that thing listen for the voice of
[2:08:14] God and he speaks to you he drops it in
[2:08:16] there this is for
[2:08:17] you and believe that and if you would
[2:08:20] just believe that why watch him start
[2:08:22] changing your life in ways that blows
[2:08:24] your little
[2:08:26] mind it will but what we try to do is
[2:08:29] well I want to be born again so I'm
[2:08:30] going go try to be born
[2:08:33] again go go offer your sheep and goats
[2:08:36] on the sacrifice that's all you're
[2:08:39] doing well I'm gonna go to a a meeting
[2:08:42] I'm gonna go to youth camp I'm going to
[2:08:44] do this that's wonderful I love I wish
[2:08:45] we all could be in that meeting in
[2:08:46] Virginia this
[2:08:50] morning but you can you can go to a
[2:08:51] thousand meetings and it's just you
[2:08:55] might as well go to Mecca with the
[2:08:57] Muslims I know that's pretty rough isn't
[2:08:59] it but if you go with the wrong approach
[2:09:02] you are wasting your time and you're
[2:09:04] hurting your faith that you do have well
[2:09:06] I try to I tried went to the altar
[2:09:08] didn't get it went to the altar I didn't
[2:09:09] get it went to the altar didn't get it
[2:09:11] that's not Faith you don't run around
[2:09:13] with a hope
[2:09:15] so you listen for the voice of God to
[2:09:18] speak to you and he tell you I am
[2:09:20] talking to you you and then you have
[2:09:23] something to stand on then when you go
[2:09:24] to prayer you say God I know you talk to
[2:09:26] me and I'm just going to wait here until
[2:09:29] you tell me what to do
[2:09:30] next and he
[2:09:32] will just keep your hands off of his
[2:09:35] salvation well I'm going try to do this
[2:09:36] now God I'm gonna try to do this I'm
[2:09:38] gonna try to do this how about
[2:09:40] confessing God I want to love
[2:09:42] you I want to love you the way you love
[2:09:44] me but I can't I don't have the
[2:09:48] capability of loving you the way I want
[2:09:50] to but there's a desire in my heart to
[2:09:52] love you that way and I know if there's
[2:09:54] a deep calling there's got to be a deep
[2:09:56] to respond
[2:09:59] hallelujah oh that thirst in your life
[2:10:02] there can't be a thirst if there's not
[2:10:04] something to to to satisfy that and if
[2:10:06] you have a desire for God that's not
[2:10:08] being satisfied recognize there is a
[2:10:11] satisfying portion somewhere for
[2:10:14] you that deep is calling the heart of
[2:10:17] God is calling to hear and it's got to
[2:10:19] match they match it's the same Des
[2:10:21] desire his desire for you matches your
[2:10:23] desire for him and those two have got to
[2:10:25] come together or else his word is
[2:10:33] alive he said it's been odd people act
[2:10:35] funny they don't come into the order of
[2:10:37] our psychology our education our
[2:10:39] learning our Creeds that don't fit in
[2:10:41] there and they kicked it out because it
[2:10:42] was too odd too peculiar too
[2:10:44] disagreeable with the plans that we as
[2:10:46] men and ideas of what the church had the
[2:10:49] church should be
[2:10:52] it doesn't line up with our
[2:10:55] religion it doesn't line up because we
[2:10:57] got the prophet we got the message y
[2:10:59] we're living a holy life we have the
[2:11:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost falling on our
[2:11:03] on our services and we just all ready to
[2:11:06] go it don't work that
[2:11:08] way it doesn't
[2:11:11] friends there's got to be a
[2:11:13] manifestation of the word for this hour
[2:11:15] in your life and you say what are you
[2:11:17] talking about you keep saying the word
[2:11:18] for this age what is that about
[2:11:21] I don't know for
[2:11:24] you I know what it is for
[2:11:26] me you want to know what it is for you
[2:11:29] go to the one who can tell
[2:11:32] you no one can tell you what you're
[2:11:34] supposed to be doing what your purpose
[2:11:35] is except for
[2:11:37] God you got to know for yourself it's an
[2:11:40] individual thing it's not we all got
[2:11:42] together and had a great big service
[2:11:44] that's not what God's looking for he's
[2:11:45] looking for a heart a place of
[2:11:49] rest that's all he's ever wanted
[2:11:52] he said what I had with Adam and Eve
[2:11:54] before the fall I so long for that I've
[2:11:57] got to have it
[2:11:59] back you know what he's saying now I got
[2:12:03] it it's
[2:12:05] back the only thing he's waiting for is
[2:12:08] these old bodies to be
[2:12:11] changed if you stumble over the
[2:12:14] body it's easy to people you know all
[2:12:16] kinds of Christians they recognize yeah
[2:12:18] that was Jesus Christ the son of God
[2:12:20] back there people don't don't stumble
[2:12:21] with that body
[2:12:24] anymore but he's the same
[2:12:35] today if he's oh God if he's the same
[2:12:40] today they got to stumble over a body
[2:12:43] today they've got to reject a body today
[2:12:46] they've got to crucify the body today
[2:12:49] theyve got to crucify the word made
[2:12:51] flesh
[2:12:53] today and I'm not talking about the
[2:12:55] denominations they have clueless they
[2:12:56] don't know what's going on at all
[2:12:58] brother and sister let's go ahead and
[2:12:59] bring it home this is message believers
[2:13:02] who are crucifying Christ aesh but not
[2:13:04] allowing that word to manifest the word
[2:13:06] for this age that is supposed to be
[2:13:08] happening but they're just good message
[2:13:12] Believers listen to tapes all day
[2:13:16] long but twist a little word here and
[2:13:18] twist a little word there and do a
[2:13:20] little bit different here and do a
[2:13:21] little bit different
[2:13:24] there to follow what they want the
[2:13:26] religion they want they hate the
[2:13:31] light oh I don't hate anything you hate
[2:13:34] the light if you refuse to walk in it
[2:13:36] it's because you hate it because it
[2:13:38] exposes the deadness of your
[2:13:42] religion you always resist you stiff
[2:13:45] neck and heart and ears always resisting
[2:13:47] the Holy
[2:13:48] Ghost I'm not talking to you you're not
[2:13:50] doing that are
[2:13:53] you that's good question yes sir God's
[2:13:57] asking you he's he's talking to each
[2:13:59] individual he's not just oh this is for
[2:14:01] everyone in the church I'll just sit in
[2:14:02] and hide in my Pew and just let it go
[2:14:04] over my head you'll answer for that
[2:14:06] that's right that's right this is real
[2:14:09] God don't play do you realize what he
[2:14:11] did I am done let me just get done here
[2:14:14] do you realize what he did for
[2:14:16] you anything it took he'll destroy
[2:14:20] Kingdom
[2:14:21] he would turn the waves of river he
[2:14:23] would did all that he did because he
[2:14:25] don't play church he allowed all those
[2:14:29] horrible things to happen to the martyrs
[2:14:31] down Through the Ages look what he did
[2:14:32] with Israel and the Holocaust the
[2:14:34] Jews he allowed that why because he had
[2:14:38] to get them back to the Homeland so he
[2:14:39] let those people be horribly tortured
[2:14:43] murdered all this things so they could
[2:14:45] have a
[2:14:46] Homeland because it had to come to pass
[2:14:49] to bring forth his word if he's going to
[2:14:50] allow that that to them to get their
[2:14:52] attention what's he going to do to
[2:14:55] you how's he going to treat you if he
[2:14:57] needs your your
[2:15:01] fellowship he will chew you up and do
[2:15:04] whatever he has to because I am G to get
[2:15:06] all mine all the father had given me are
[2:15:08] mine I got them written here right on my
[2:15:10] hand and they're not I'm not going to
[2:15:11] lose a single one of
[2:15:14] these That's how much he cares and then

[2:15:34] I think brother Phil preaches too long I
[2:15:36] don't like the way brother Thomas
[2:15:37] screams and shouts well I think I should
[2:15:39] do this right you're playing
[2:15:42] church because all you're offering to
[2:15:44] God all you're offering to God is some
[2:15:46] religious idea that you thought you was
[2:15:48] going to have to run the church that's
[2:15:50] right
[2:15:51] there are people in offices to do these
[2:15:53] things they're elected and God anoints
[2:15:55] them for that job if you have a problem
[2:15:57] with something go talk to them in the
[2:15:59] right
[2:16:00] Spirit but if you want to sit at the
[2:16:02] dinner table and trash somebody or

[2:16:47] my point let me keep
[2:16:49] going flirting with old
[2:16:52] boyfriends what do we want to do let me
[2:16:55] finish with this this quote this
[2:16:57] scripture Jesus said Matthew 21 Jesus
[2:16:59] saith unto them did you never read in
[2:17:00] the scriptures the stone which the
[2:17:02] builders rejected the same as become the
[2:17:04] head of the corner this is the Lord's
[2:17:06] doing is marvelous in our eyes therefore
[2:17:09] say I unto you the kingdom of God shall
[2:17:11] be taken from you and given to a nation
[2:17:13] bringing forth the fruits
[2:17:15] thereof and whosoever shall fall on the
[2:17:17] stone shall be broken but on whosoever
[2:17:19] it shall fall it will grind to powder
[2:17:22] you have two choices you're either going
[2:17:25] to fall on the stone in Repentance or
[2:17:27] it's going to fall on you and grind you
[2:17:28] to powder and destroy you you have two
[2:17:31] choices there's the only two choices you
[2:17:33] have how do you fall on that stone
[2:17:37] repent repentance is how you fall on
[2:17:39] that stone and be broken and be honest
[2:17:41] with God be honest with God God I still
[2:17:45] love this thing of the world I still
[2:17:47] this is sin and yet it has such an
[2:17:49] enticement it's something that I still
[2:17:51] can't give up it's still something that
[2:17:52] I want that I want I want my own nature
[2:17:55] is too strong I can't get get over it
[2:17:58] don't go in there say God I'm trying so
[2:18:00] hard I'm praying I'm reading why are you
[2:18:02] not keeping your end of the bargain
[2:18:03] you're supposed to set me free from this
[2:18:05] oh
[2:18:07] quit you calling him a
[2:18:09] liar you find him fault in the way he's
[2:18:12] handling
[2:18:13] you he's looking for true repentance
[2:18:16] that only comes to
[2:18:19] honesty I love this thing I don't want
[2:18:21] to give it up but I need to because I
[2:18:23] know it's separating my fellowship with
[2:18:25] you I need you to step up this is your
[2:18:27] promise to me I'm holding you to this
[2:18:29] promise I know you're going to do
[2:18:32] it I need to love you more than I
[2:18:37] do I said that was the last scripture I
[2:18:39] lied to you I'm sorry Romans 9:30 what
[2:18:41] shall we say then that the Gentiles
[2:18:43] which followed not after righteousness
[2:18:45] have attained to righteousness even the
[2:18:46] righteousness which is of Faith but
[2:18:48] Israel which followed after the law of
[2:18:51] righteousness has not attained to the
[2:18:53] law of righteousness so here is Israel
[2:18:55] with the law and God is saying you know
[2:18:57] they're good they're walking in the
[2:18:58] light but it was time to turn the corner
[2:19:00] and they refused to turn the corner but
[2:19:02] the Gentiles he came to the Gentiles
[2:19:04] said now I'm going to offer you Grace
[2:19:05] they said I'll take
[2:19:07] it it's just by faith I'll take it but
[2:19:11] they so loved their religion the Jews
[2:19:13] did they could not turn and follow after
[2:19:15] Grace after faith and so the Gentiles
[2:19:17] got it and the Jews have gone off when
[2:19:19] we see the last 2,000 years here's
[2:19:20] what's become of them but they're
[2:19:23] back they're back wherefore why did they
[2:19:27] not attain to it because they sought it
[2:19:29] not by faith but that were the works of
[2:19:31] as it were the works of the law for they
[2:19:33] stumbled at that stumbling Stone behold
[2:19:35] I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock
[2:19:37] of offense whosoever believeth on him
[2:19:39] shall not be
[2:19:42] ashamed all God is asking for is belief
[2:19:47] when I speak to you recognize my voice
[2:19:51] and believe it and if you believe it
[2:19:52] you'll do
[2:19:55] it you see see God still wants a
[2:19:59] sacrifice tell you what we are going to
[2:20:01] quit go ahead and stand I got one more
[2:20:02] scripture if you stand I'll have to quit
[2:20:07] soon you've been a great group this
[2:20:10] morning very I appreciate
[2:20:12] it God does have a sacrifice he wants
[2:20:15] from us he absolutely does so in 1 Peter
[2:20:19] 2 and4 it says to whom coming
[2:20:21] as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed
[2:20:24] of men but chosen of God and precious so
[2:20:25] we're coming to this living Stone ye
[2:20:28] also as Lively stones that means you're
[2:20:31] a living Stone you're not just a dead
[2:20:33] Church sitter are built up a spiritual
[2:20:37] house a house built without hands God
[2:20:39] has built you up a house not a wall a
[2:20:42] holy
[2:20:43] priesthood you're a holy priesthood God
[2:20:46] does not accept sacrifices from a
[2:20:48] sinning hands it's got to be a holy
[2:20:52] priesthood to offer up spiritual
[2:20:55] sacrifices accepted to God by Jesus
[2:20:59] Christ what is your spiritual
[2:21:02] sacrifice your heart you say well how do
[2:21:05] I offer my heart you offering the

[2:21:16] matter how much loss no matter how
[2:21:17] things are falling apart your whole life
[2:21:19] is just shambling and yet the only thing
[2:21:22] coming out of your mouth is praise to
[2:21:24] the faultless God who did all he has for
[2:21:26] you already that's all's looking for can
[2:21:29] you give me that sacrifice of praise
[2:21:31] Phil I'm tired I don't feel like it I
[2:21:33] don't want to go to church go ahead and
[2:21:35] offer that sacrifice at praise because
[2:21:37] all the rest of your sacrifices mean
[2:21:39] nothing if you don't start with
[2:21:42] that it
[2:21:43] doesn't he's looking for a spiritual
[2:21:46] sacrifice that that sacrif sacrifice
