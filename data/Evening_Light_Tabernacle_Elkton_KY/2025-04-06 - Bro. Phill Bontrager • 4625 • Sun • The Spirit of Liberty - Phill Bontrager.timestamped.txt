[24:23] Precious and kind heavenly father, as we
[24:25] approach your throne of grace once
[24:27] again, Lord. And father, we want to give
[24:29] you a special invite, Father, that you
[24:31] would come speak through our brother
[24:33] Phil this morning, Lord Jesus, the words
[24:35] of life to us, God. Father, help him
[24:38] just to surrender in such a way that the
[24:39] Holy Spirit could speak to the church
[24:42] this morning, Father, what you want to
[24:43] say, Lord. And Father, we pray, God,
[24:45] that it wouldn't be just for one person,
[24:48] Lord, but it would be for every person,
[24:50] Lord. We come with expectations, Lord
[24:52] Jesus, that you'll speak to every heart
[24:55] this morning, Lord. Come and move in a
[24:57] mighty way today into both the service
[25:00] this morning and also this evening,
[25:02] Father. And then our fellowship between
[25:04] the service. May it be sweet, Father.
[25:06] And we ask, God, that you'll just
[25:08] receive our thanks and appreciation,
[25:09] Lord, for the healing that you give our
[25:11] bodies, Lord, when we're sick, Lord
[25:13] Jesus. Father, we know that nothing can
[25:17] come upon us, Lord, unless you allow it,
[25:19] Lord. But we do ask God these sicknesses
[25:21] that's been going around, Father, that
[25:23] you would certainly keep thwarting them
[25:25] off, Lord, and put a hedge around us,
[25:26] Lord, protect us and continue to lead us
[25:29] and guide us, Father. We want to thank
[25:31] you, Lord, for the during these storms,
[25:32] Lord Jesus, that Father, we Lord Jesus,
[25:35] you watched over us. You protected us
[25:37] from tornadoes, from flooding, and
[25:39] things. And we appreciate that
[25:40] protection that we have, Lord, when the
[25:43] wind is howling and the metal's flying,
[25:45] so to speak. Sometimes we can sit
[25:46] comfortably in knowing that you have
[25:48] your palm of your hand over top of us,
[25:50] Lord Jesus, and that you watch over us,
[25:53] Father. And Lord, this morning we ask
[25:55] God that you would just come down each
[25:57] aisle, Lord, and speak to our hearts
[25:58] this morning in Jesus Christ's name we
[26:01] ask it. Amen and amen. And everybody

[26:35] for everybody." Amen. God bless you.
[26:40] If we'll just go in the Psalms this
[26:42] morning, we're going to Psalms
[26:51] 37. Psalms 37. And we're just going to
[26:54] read up to verse uh
[26:59] 19. Fret not thyself because of
[27:02] evildoers, neither be thou envious
[27:05] against the workers of iniquity.
[27:13] Trust in the Lord and do good. So shalt
[27:15] thou dwell in the land and verily verily
[27:18] thou shalt be
[27:28] fed. Trust also in him and he shall
[27:31] bring it to pass.
[27:39] Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for
[27:41] him. For it not thyself because of him
[27:44] who prosperth in his way, because of the
[27:46] man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
[27:56] For evildoers shall be cut off, but
[27:58] those that wait upon the Lord, they
[28:00] shall inherit the earth.
[28:11] The meek shall inherit the earth and
[28:13] shall delight themselves in the
[28:15] abundance of peace.
[28:22] The Lord shall laugh at him, for he
[28:24] seeth that his day is coming.
[28:36] Their sword shall enter into their own
[28:39] heart, and their bow shall be broken.
[28:47] For the arms of the wicked shall be
[28:48] broken, but the Lord upholdeth the
[28:51] righteous.
[28:57] This one together. They shall not be
[28:59] ashamed in the evil time and in the days
[29:02] of famine they shall be satisfied. God
[29:05] bless you, brother David.
[29:20] Amen. And I, you know, we've been
[29:23] through it a lot. And I was telling them
[29:26] a little testimony out in the prayer
[29:28] room this morning. And which where we
[29:30] used to live at in Arkansas, they got
[29:33] they had a a flood there really bad. And
[29:36] only one of the believers, the water got
[29:38] right up to the back of their house and
[29:40] that was as far as got. And nobody was
[29:42] bothered. Of course, they lost some
[29:44] power, but God's been good to us this
[29:47] morning. And I thought, you know,
[29:50] Lord, you keep your hand up on us and
[29:53] you do so much for us and sometimes we
[29:55] don't even realize what all and how good
[29:57] he's been to us this morning. And we're
[30:00] going to sing this song. Brother Parish
[30:02] used to sing this song. I've got so much
[30:05] to thank him for. Amen. And and

[30:12] good he's done been for us and what all,
[30:15] we'd be here all day.

[30:20] we could. And I've got so much to thank
[30:26] him
[30:27] for. So much to praise him for. You see,

[30:41] lose of what he's done and
[30:45] all he's brought me from, I've got so
[30:49] much to
[30:51] thank him for.
[30:56] And when I
[30:57] look around and see all the good
[31:02] things he's done for me, I
[31:05] know I'm unworthy of them
[31:11] all. For his

[31:54] much to
[31:56] thank him
[32:00] for. And
[32:02] sometimes while on this way I'll
[32:07] need to stop and say thank you Lord for
[32:12] all you've done for me.

[32:18] One

[48:30] hope is in the Lord.
[48:34] from this time
[48:37] on and so much
[48:44] more. Is in the
[48:47] Lord forever more. Let's sing it again
[48:52] if we could. Oh yes. My hope, oh my
[48:57] hope is in the Lord.
[49:05] and ever
[49:07] more. Oh my
[49:11] hope is in the
[49:15] Lord forever more. Could we sing that
[49:18] second verse again? Brother Micah, could
[49:20] you pull it up,
[49:21] please? His tender mercies come with a
[49:26] ever rising sun.
[49:30] Yes, sinners in his
[49:35] rightness to offer healing and
[49:42] forgiveness to those that trust in him
[49:47] will find their hearts at rest. Oh, my
[49:53] hope is in the Lord.
[49:58] I'm
[50:00] on and ever
[50:03] more. Oh, my
[50:07] hope is in the
[50:10] Lord
[50:12] forever
[50:14] more. Amen. How many's thankful for his
[50:18] tender mercies? Amen. You may be seated.
[50:20] and and uh brother Steve asked me to
[50:24] sing a special this morning and I
[50:26] already sang it but this song has been
[50:28] burning on my heart and I thought well
[50:30] he asked me so it just worked out to
[50:33] sing that other song of brother parishes
[50:35] but this song's been on my heart and
[50:38] he's in the midst it says
[50:43] uh E or D I don't know if that's right
[50:46] or not you just figure it out we'll go
[50:49] from
[50:51] there as you travel down life's road.
[50:57] Oh, he is with you every day. With every
[51:03] step you take, he's walked ahead of you.
[51:10] Oh, and every night as you lay down, oh,
[51:15] angels are camping all around. I'll
[51:20] never be alone, for he is in the
[51:27] midst. Oh, he's in the midst of our
[51:32] storm. He's in the valley we walk
[51:37] through.
[51:38] Where two or three are gathered in his
[51:43] name, he'll be there too. And when you
[51:48] feel so all alone, he is standing next
[51:54] to you. He's with us
[51:58] now. Our Lord, he's in the midst.
[52:04] And into the prison they were thrown.
[52:09] Paul and Silas were alone. They knew
[52:14] their God was there and he would see
[52:19] them through.
[52:22] So when the walls began to shake and all
[52:28] their chains just fell away, they cried,
[52:32] "Behold our God, for he is in the
[52:37] midst." You believe it this morning?
[52:40] He's in the midst of our storm. He's in
[52:45] the valley we walk
[52:48] through. there. Two or three are
[52:52] gathered in his name, he'll be there,
[52:57] too. And when you feel so all alone, he
[53:03] is standing next to you. He's with us
[53:08] now. Our Lord, he's in the
[53:14] midst. Oh, he's with us now.
[53:18] our Lord. He's in the
[53:23] midst. Amen. You believe he's in our
[53:26] midst this morning? Let's give him a
[53:27] hand of praise this morning.
[53:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Thomas asked
[53:34] me to do the birthdays. Anyone that has
[53:36] a birthday in the month of April, you
[53:39] want to stand and come up this
[53:41] morning? Anybody that has a birthday?

[54:39] this morning, but by the grace of God,
[54:42] the 25th of April, she has put up with
[54:44] me for 44 years.
[54:46] So give her a hand of praise this
[54:50] morning.
[54:51] Amen. And I tell you, since she's been
[54:56] sick, you look back and you think of all
[55:00] the wonderful
[55:02] times. And then when you go through
[55:04] times like this and she's never been
[55:07] sick and she was in the hospital for 15
[55:09] days and you know I I didn't know what
[55:12] to
[55:13] think but she's like her mom. She's a
[55:17] little stubborn. They told her she was
[55:19] she had this. She said no I don't. I
[55:22] said babe you've got some problems or we
[55:24] wouldn't be here. But the Lord is he's
[55:27] been a miracle worker and she's doing
[55:29] really really good and and uh I'm just
[55:32] thankful for her and I'm I thank you for
[55:35] your
[55:36] prayers and thank you for those that
[55:38] sent food and we appreciate that very
[55:40] much. And I told Sister Grace, I'm going
[55:42] to brag on Sister Grace, she made her
[55:45] chicken spaghetti the other day and and
[55:47] she finished it off last night and she
[55:49] said that was really good. So I told
[55:52] Grace, I said, "You hit a grand slam on
[55:54] that." So, but we appreciate your
[55:56] prayers most of all. God bless you.
[55:57] Let's stand this morning and it's a
[55:59] privilege to have brother Phil here this
[56:01] morning and really appreciate brother
[56:03] Phil and Amen. Let's just sing a little
[56:05] course of amazing grace as brother Phil
[56:07] comes this morning and give him your
[56:09] undivided attention this morning and
[56:11] pull from the gift that God's given this
[56:13] morning. Oh, it's
[56:16] amazing. Sing
[56:19] grace, how
[56:22] sweet the
[56:24] sound. Oh, that
[56:27] save a
[56:30] red like me.
[56:36] I
[56:37] once was
[56:40] lost, but
[56:43] now I'm
[56:45] found. God bless you. I'll put your
[56:49] water down there. I got to go get
[56:50] it. I'll get it for
[56:54] you. Let's sing that again.
[56:56] [Music]
[56:59] Amazing
[57:01] grace, how
[57:04] sweet the
[57:07] star that
[57:10] [Music]
[57:12] save like me.
[57:18] I
[57:20] once was
[57:22] lost, but
[57:25] now I
[57:28] find. I was
[57:30] blind, but
[57:33] now I
[57:38] see. Lord Jesus, we're going to pray
[57:40] once more, Lord, as we approach you now,
[57:43] Father, that we can hear from your from
[57:45] your voice, Lord, from your heart this
[57:48] morning. I pray that each person would
[57:52] just get alone with you this morning.
[57:54] Ignore everyone around them. Ignore me.
[57:56] Ignore everything going on, but that we
[57:58] could enter into that secret place with
[58:00] just you and us as an individual. That's
[58:03] where you long to fellowship with us.
[58:05] That's where you long to touch our
[58:06] hearts and to hear back from us, Lord.
[58:09] So many times we we want to hear from
[58:11] you. But but Lord, you want to hear from
[58:13] us. And so when when we are when we are
[58:15] hear your word and we just reach out and
[58:17] even if it doesn't come from our lips,
[58:19] from our heart, Lord, we say, "I believe
[58:21] you, Lord." And you want to respond back
[58:23] and I say, "I believe you."
[58:26] We say, "I love you, Lord." You want to
[58:28] say, "I love you." But oh, how you long
[58:30] for those times of fellowship. And
[58:32] father, this is an opportunity we have
[58:34] this morning to enter into that secret
[58:36] place, Lord. I ask that each one that
[58:38] that's where we find deliverance. It's
[58:40] where we find healing. It's where we
[58:43] find strength, faith to press on, Lord.
[58:46] And this morning, we want to talk about
[58:48] your love was that's where we find your
[58:50] love. So, we just expect you, Lord, to
[58:52] come and speak. Father, we're so
[58:54] grateful to be here this morning. Won't
[58:57] you just have your way this morning,
[58:58] Lord? We ask this in your precious name.
[59:00] Amen. I'm going to read a scripture out
[59:03] of 2 Corinthians
[59:05] 3:17 before we have a seat. It's good to
[59:08] see everybody. It's always such a I'd
[59:10] enjoy coming up here and seeing y'all
[59:12] and just a wonderful group of people. I
[59:15] appreciate you very
[59:16] much. 2 Corinthians
[59:22] 3:17. Now the Lord is that
[59:25] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[59:28] is, there is liberty. Why don't you have
[59:31] a seat this morning? We're going to get
[59:33] started here. Now, I want to speak on
[59:35] the thought of the spirit of liberty.
[59:37] Um, and it's it's just I'm supposed to
[59:40] preach, too. So, I'm just going to go
[59:42] for a while this morning. Go about an
[59:43] hour or so, then we'll stop and come
[59:45] back and finish this afternoon. So, this
[59:48] morning might be a little heavy. So, if
[59:49] you come this afternoon, it might make
[59:51] you feel a little bit better,
[59:53] but I don't know. We'll see how it goes.
[59:55] Okay.
[59:58] So, we want to talk about the spirit of
[1:00:00] liberty, especially how it expresses
[1:00:02] itself through love. And there's two
[1:00:05] types of love we talk about. One is
[1:00:06] filio or fileo, however you pronounce
[1:00:08] it. I don't care. I'm going to say filio
[1:00:09] this morning. And then we have agape.
[1:00:11] And we know filio is what we call human
[1:00:13] love. And this is a lower form of love.
[1:00:15] Agape is what we consider God's love
[1:00:17] when the Holy Spirit is in you loving
[1:00:19] through you. And it's got a nobler
[1:00:21] purpose, a human love. It's got a lesser
[1:00:24] purpose because human love is
[1:00:26] inherently selfish.
[1:00:29] It's inherently built partially on fear.
[1:00:33] Don't don't get me wrong. Human love is
[1:00:34] very important. This is where we live
[1:00:36] most of our life maybe. Um a and we have
[1:00:39] to have it and it can accomplish amazing
[1:00:41] things. And so I'm not just throwing it
[1:00:43] all away. But here's the problem that
[1:00:45] human love can do. It can interfere with
[1:00:48] your relationship with Christ. And as
[1:00:50] long as it doesn't interfere with your
[1:00:52] relationship with Christ, living in it,
[1:00:53] it's wonderful. It can do noble things.
[1:00:55] But human love can do some really
[1:00:57] horrible things, too. Let me give you an
[1:00:59] example. Let me give you an example.
[1:01:01] Let's say this man and woman, they love
[1:01:02] each other. They're just living. He just
[1:01:04] I love her so much. And he finds out she
[1:01:05] cheated on him, he goes home and shoots
[1:01:07] her. It's called a crime of passion. You
[1:01:10] know what caused that? Human love.
[1:01:12] Human love can do some horrible things.
[1:01:14] And so, we need to make sure that we are
[1:01:17] we are keeping it in check. We are
[1:01:19] watching what's what's motivating us.
[1:01:21] And and if we're just moving by our
[1:01:23] human love and not agape love, we're
[1:01:25] going to find ourselves in a lot of bad
[1:01:27] places, things we don't want to
[1:01:30] do. It's going to interfere with our
[1:01:33] relationship with Christ. And Satan
[1:01:35] likes to bind us through religion,
[1:01:37] through human love. It's it's about
[1:01:40] control and about force. Like I said,
[1:01:41] we're going to talk about the spirit of
[1:01:43] liberty. And we're going to find out
[1:01:44] that human love is not about liberty.
[1:01:46] It's about control and about force and
[1:01:48] getting what I want because that's what
[1:01:50] human love does. It can it it influences
[1:01:53] other people to get what I want from
[1:01:55] you.
[1:01:58] Agape love don't do that.
[1:02:01] Agape love is a spirit of freedom. It
[1:02:04] sets you free.
[1:02:08] That's this afternoon. We're going to
[1:02:09] stay. All right. So, let's let's let's
[1:02:12] look how Satan uses his human love to
[1:02:14] influence us through religion. All
[1:02:16] right, we're talking about false
[1:02:17] religion. And now when I'm talking about
[1:02:18] this, I I know you know this, but let's
[1:02:20] not be looking at the people out there.
[1:02:22] Let's let's keep it down here, right
[1:02:24] among us, right? Because I'm not
[1:02:26] preaching to them out there. The Holy
[1:02:28] Spirit's here to talk to you personally.
[1:02:30] Now, when I was studying this, I was
[1:02:31] driving up here on the road. I was
[1:02:33] meditating on this and I was getting a
[1:02:35] whooping. All right? So, this is if you
[1:02:37] don't get anything from it, I know he's
[1:02:38] whooping me this morning. So, just
[1:02:40] putting that out there. Brother Bram
[1:02:42] says this. Now a woman now was when you
[1:02:44] talk about woman think church right? So
[1:02:46] a church is not meant to have an iron
[1:02:49] disposition. She is according to the
[1:02:51] holy scripture to be submissive to the
[1:02:54] male.
[1:02:56] That means that us as a church as a
[1:02:59] minister whatever your job is we are to
[1:03:02] be submissive to the male the word.
[1:03:06] Amen. Right? Whenever we get out of the
[1:03:08] word, whenever we get off the word,
[1:03:09] whenever we we make an exception for the
[1:03:11] word, we're no longer submissive.
[1:03:16] She says that is commanded of her. Woman
[1:03:19] who is truly female, all female, will be
[1:03:21] that disposition, not a doormat. No real
[1:03:24] male makes a female a doormat.
[1:03:27] You want to know if you're treating your
[1:03:29] wife right? How does Christ treat you?
[1:03:32] There's your example. Yeah. That's the
[1:03:34] way you're supposed to treat each other.
[1:03:36] or the way Christ treats you. And
[1:03:38] brother says, that's the way the church
[1:03:39] has to be, our relationship with Christ.
[1:03:41] And what gets in the way of that is
[1:03:43] human love, especially when it exerts
[1:03:45] itself as a selfishness. I want
[1:03:47] something for myself.
[1:03:52] She will want, listen to this, no real
[1:03:54] male makes a female a doormat, but she
[1:03:56] will want to be under authority and not
[1:03:59] rule over the male.
[1:04:03] Thank you, Lord. That's the church we're
[1:04:05] talking about. Do we want to be
[1:04:07] submissive to the word or do we want to
[1:04:10] have our own say in this? And it can
[1:04:13] manifest itself a lot of ways. Brother
[1:04:16] Thomas, I need to have a a conference
[1:04:18] with you after church. Uh I think you
[1:04:20] need to start doing something about this
[1:04:21] brother over here. He I just can't stand
[1:04:23] him sitting in the front row. You know,
[1:04:25] if we could do something about him,
[1:04:26] maybe sit someplace else from now on.
[1:04:28] Can you can you take care of that for
[1:04:31] me? I know I'm being silly.
[1:04:34] But it's that attitude. Well, I want to
[1:04:36] run the church. Because here's the
[1:04:38] thing, brother and sister. Even brother
[1:04:40] Thomas going to have that attitude. He
[1:04:42] don't run this church and no other
[1:04:44] minister runs this church. It's the
[1:04:46] great shepherd runs this church. And all
[1:04:48] he is a minor shepherd to make sure that
[1:04:50] you hear the great shepherd. Cuz if all
[1:04:52] you ever hear is brother Thomas, you're
[1:04:54] in a bad place.
[1:05:00] Ain't it great to have that confidence
[1:05:02] that you know who's running the place?
[1:05:04] You say, "Well, how do you know?" Look
[1:05:06] at the effect that the word has on you
[1:05:08] when you know who's running the show.
[1:05:11] My It sets you free.
[1:05:16] My
[1:05:17] I can't stay off this afternoon. Let me
[1:05:19] keep going here.
[1:05:22] If she breaks that image that God made
[1:05:24] for her, she has perverted. Any male
[1:05:26] that lets the woman take authority has
[1:05:27] also broken the image and he is
[1:05:29] perverted. Let me just be blunt. There's
[1:05:31] a lot of message preachers around who
[1:05:33] are perverted because they have not
[1:05:35] allowed the word to run the show.
[1:05:37] They're trying to run it themselves.
[1:05:40] And you've seen it and you see the
[1:05:42] effect it has. You see pastors, you see
[1:05:44] preachers in in churches and
[1:05:46] evangelists, everyone going around and
[1:05:48] they're trying to establish their own
[1:05:49] self. They're establishing their own
[1:05:51] ministry, their own little kingdom, so
[1:05:53] people look at them a certain way.
[1:05:54] Brother and sister, you and I have
[1:05:56] nothing to prove. All we have to do is
[1:05:58] be subject to the word and let him
[1:06:00] vindicate exactly who you
[1:06:04] are. I don't come up here with anything
[1:06:06] to prove. You don't have anything to
[1:06:08] prove. Well, I got to show what a
[1:06:09] Christian I am. You need to show that
[1:06:11] you're subject to the word and let that
[1:06:13] freedom that comes through the word have
[1:06:15] that effect in your life and watch
[1:06:16] people look at you and say, "You know
[1:06:18] what? There's something really genuine
[1:06:20] about that brother. That sister, there's
[1:06:22] something real about her. I don't know
[1:06:23] what it is, but I like being around
[1:06:25] them.
[1:06:28] Unless you have that controlling
[1:06:30] religious spirit and say, "None, I hate
[1:06:31] her.
[1:06:33] I don't like that person." Why? Because
[1:06:35] they can't control you. Oh my.
[1:06:39] When you won't be controlled by someone
[1:06:40] else's religion, you're a threat to
[1:06:42] them, friends. And they're going to find
[1:06:44] a reason to dislike you.
[1:06:50] That hurt. That hurts me a little bit
[1:06:52] because I know I've been guilty of that.
[1:06:55] I told you it's going to hurt.
[1:06:58] What is that iron dis? It's the iron
[1:07:00] disposition. You see the spirit of the
[1:07:02] the the church today, the the the last
[1:07:04] day is Rome's iron disposition. We know
[1:07:07] the Daniel's vision with the with the
[1:07:09] the legs of iron and they stamped
[1:07:11] everything out. It's forcing. It's
[1:07:12] controlling. And when the when when the
[1:07:14] the image to the beast takes complete
[1:07:17] control, it's going to shut you down.
[1:07:19] Either you take the the mark of the
[1:07:20] beast or they're going to kill you. It's
[1:07:22] about force. It's about control. And
[1:07:25] this is that spirit. Like I said, we're
[1:07:27] not looking out there. How is that
[1:07:29] spirit attempting to control you and us
[1:07:32] as we're sitting here in church this
[1:07:33] morning? As we go about our lives, as we
[1:07:35] do what we're trying to do to be a
[1:07:37] Christian, but that controlling,
[1:07:39] dominating spirit is always trying to
[1:07:42] get you to do something this way. And we
[1:07:45] influence each other with that same kind
[1:07:47] of thing. and it looks so good. We don't
[1:07:49] even realize it sometime what we're
[1:07:51] doing. But yet, it's that that's that
[1:07:53] that uh uh spirit to try to control
[1:07:56] others to make me happy.
[1:08:03] And remember, you are Satan's number one
[1:08:06] target.
[1:08:08] He hates you more than anyone else
[1:08:10] because he's got everybody else, but he
[1:08:12] don't have you. That's right. And he
[1:08:15] can't control you. that terrifies him.
[1:08:18] And the more you die to that's what
[1:08:20] death to self is. You're you're not
[1:08:22] allowing yourself to control yourself.
[1:08:24] You're dying to yourself. You're dying
[1:08:25] to that old bad part of that human love.
[1:08:30] And when you won't be controlled by your
[1:08:32] emotions, when you control your emotions
[1:08:34] instead, Satan can't control you.
[1:08:37] Think about it. Satan can't control you
[1:08:40] if you will just keep your emotions
[1:08:41] under control.
[1:08:46] What
[1:08:49] what is it so hard to die to? What do we
[1:08:51] struggle dying to? The things we love
[1:08:55] me. Absolutely. This old boy here, my
[1:08:58] biggest enemy, right? Cuz I don't like
[1:08:59] to die. Why? Because the things I like
[1:09:02] get in my way.
[1:09:04] Let me give you a silly example. If you
[1:09:07] came up to me and said, 'Brother Phil,
[1:09:09] God spoke to me and he said, 'You
[1:09:11] rapture ready if you would just die out
[1:09:13] to eating
[1:09:15] sushi, I'm I'm going I'm done. I'm out
[1:09:18] of here. I mean, my body change is right
[1:09:20] there because I couldn't care less if I
[1:09:22] have another have another bite of
[1:09:25] sushi. I mean, I can eat it, but you
[1:09:27] know, why would you?
[1:09:29] But if you came to me and said, "Brother
[1:09:31] Phil, to go in the rapture, you need to
[1:09:33] eat no more ribeye steak." Woo!
[1:09:37] That's my favorite meal. Now we got a
[1:09:39] problem.
[1:09:41] I'm being ridiculous. But do you see
[1:09:42] what I'm What do we struggle dying to is
[1:09:45] what we like. Our human love protecting
[1:09:49] this old boy, getting what this guy
[1:09:50] likes, doing what I want for myself, and
[1:09:53] getting you to comply with my wishes for
[1:09:55] you. That's all operated by human love.
[1:10:00] It can be a good thing and it can be
[1:10:02] horrible.
[1:10:05] So what do we do? We try to force others
[1:10:09] through manipulation, emotional
[1:10:10] manipulation. We try to get them to do
[1:10:12] what we
[1:10:14] want. We build our denominational walls
[1:10:17] if they don't.
[1:10:23] Someone comes to the church and they
[1:10:25] don't believe the way we believe and
[1:10:27] they're visiting and afterwards you just
[1:10:30] feel you got to just set them straight.
[1:10:33] You
[1:10:37] say get in trouble,
[1:10:40] brother Brad. God talked to you about
[1:10:42] something. You preached something that I
[1:10:44] just don't agree with. And this is what
[1:10:46] the prophet said. This is what the
[1:10:47] prophet said. And he said, "And I'm
[1:10:48] right and you're
[1:10:50] wrong." You know what? It don't matter
[1:10:53] how right I am and how wrong he is. He's
[1:10:56] still in a better place than I am if my
[1:10:57] attitude is wrong.
[1:11:07] I'm not talking about a compromising,
[1:11:08] well, we just everyone's just fine. We
[1:11:10] believe everybody is great. No, I'm not
[1:11:12] talking about that. Not compromising,
[1:11:13] but what is my attitude? Is a judgmental
[1:11:16] attitude because I know something that
[1:11:18] you don't and it puffs me up. How many
[1:11:21] times we talk to people who are not
[1:11:22] message believers and we get an
[1:11:24] attitude. I know you don't do this. I'm
[1:11:25] talking to myself. We get an attitude
[1:11:27] sometime, well, I know more than you and
[1:11:30] you're just a dumb Baptist or you're
[1:11:31] just a dumb Amish man or whatever and I
[1:11:34] got some light to show it to you and my
[1:11:36] attitude comes across that I'm superior
[1:11:38] to you. And who wants that kind of
[1:11:40] religion?
[1:11:42] I don't. I mean, before I was a
[1:11:45] Christian, before I gave my heart to the
[1:11:46] Lord, I ran into certain situations like
[1:11:48] that from message believers. And my
[1:11:50] attitude, I remember one time I I they
[1:11:52] were treating me a certain way. I said,
[1:11:54] "I don't want nothing to do with the
[1:11:55] message if that's what it produces."
[1:11:58] Who wants that?
[1:12:01] Then I found someone real and I said,
[1:12:02] "Oh, I do want that."
[1:12:05] Absolutely.
[1:12:11] So what we do, we spiritually speaking,
[1:12:16] someone comes in, we want to cloak them
[1:12:18] with
[1:12:19] flatteries. We be nice to them. Don't
[1:12:21] you want to join our church? Look how
[1:12:22] much love we have. Look how we agree
[1:12:24] with each other and we just love each
[1:12:26] other. We have great picnics and and we
[1:12:28] listen to the word and we worship and
[1:12:30] the Holy Spirit falls and isn't just a
[1:12:32] wonderful place to be. Yeah. I kind of
[1:12:35] like this. By the way, do you know the
[1:12:38] serpent seed? H you believe the serpent
[1:12:40] seed? Huh? How were you baptized? Huh?
[1:12:42] How long is your hair?
[1:12:45] And all of a sudden that old dominating
[1:12:48] female spirit rises up and tries to
[1:12:50] force them into our idea how they're
[1:12:52] supposed to be living instead of letting
[1:12:54] it come through the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:02] Everyone wants to be loved. Everyone
[1:13:05] wants to be love. And so and so when we
[1:13:06] we create an atmosphere of love which is
[1:13:09] based on human
[1:13:10] love. It's just based on human love
[1:13:13] instead of God. When you run against
[1:13:15] him, what happens? You get in an
[1:13:16] argument. You get division. You got a
[1:13:17] church split and this person's going
[1:13:19] there and talking about you and I'm
[1:13:20] going there and talking back about them.
[1:13:22] And why? Why? Because we're operating on
[1:13:24] that emotional human love that has to
[1:13:26] protect itself. That's why people say
[1:13:29] never argue about politics or religion.
[1:13:31] Why? Because you're going to get in an
[1:13:32] argument, right? And you're going to
[1:13:34] have division. People going to get mad
[1:13:36] because if you don't see it my way, then
[1:13:37] you're wrong. And I feel justified in
[1:13:39] condemning you to hell.
[1:13:42] That's what human love will produce.
[1:13:47] Oh, this is this hurts me.
[1:13:54] So, what do we do? We recognize that
[1:13:57] someone resists this or we resist that
[1:13:59] and we get this this contention among
[1:14:01] ourselves and we're struggling with each
[1:14:02] other and oh, Sister Becky, sure glad to
[1:14:05] see you.
[1:14:09] Why? Because there's something in our
[1:14:12] spirits is not connecting anymore.
[1:14:15] What got Oh, that's just the devil. It
[1:14:17] is the devil. You know how he did it?
[1:14:19] Through your human love. He got your
[1:14:21] human love. Protecting yourself. We love
[1:14:24] oursel. We protect ourselves. If we
[1:14:26] would die to ourselves, we would get
[1:14:29] along with everybody.
[1:14:34] Let me say that again. If you would quit
[1:14:36] protecting yourself, you will get along
[1:14:37] with everybody. Whether they hate you or
[1:14:40] not has nothing to do with it.
[1:14:43] And when I say get along, I'm not saying
[1:14:45] you're going to be best pal, someone
[1:14:46] trying to kill you, but you're going to
[1:14:48] love them. And you're going to have no
[1:14:49] animosity towards that person. You talk
[1:14:52] about freedom. Oh, you talk about being
[1:14:55] free when you're no longer controlled by
[1:14:57] my fears and my doubts and my antagonism
[1:14:59] and all this stuff. And I can just open
[1:15:01] up my heart and just love you no matter
[1:15:03] how you treat me. That's the epitome of
[1:15:05] being free, friends. That's the spirit
[1:15:08] of freedom.
[1:15:11] But what do we do when someone disagrees
[1:15:13] with us? We're ready to crush them under
[1:15:15] food. We trample them. We take our
[1:15:16] quotes and our scriptures and we crush
[1:15:18] them down and we prove that they're
[1:15:20] wrong and we get wrong. Get in their
[1:15:21] face. Or maybe we just ignore them. But
[1:15:23] we just prove to ourselves, look how
[1:15:25] wrong that person is.
[1:15:32] Have you ever changed someone's mind by
[1:15:35] arguing with them?
[1:15:37] You know that that should have sunk into
[1:15:39] my head long long ago, way before it
[1:15:42] did.
[1:15:46] Maybe it's starting to sink in this
[1:15:48] morning. I hope so,
[1:15:51] cuz my goodness, what a waste of time
[1:15:54] and energy and emotion and all this kind
[1:15:56] of stuff. Well, I'm going to prove
[1:15:57] you're wrong and I'm
[1:16:02] right. Your doctrine might be right, but
[1:16:05] if it comes with the wrong spirit,
[1:16:08] you're wrong.
[1:16:11] We've heard it preached or quoted many
[1:16:13] times. Brother Brandham said, "Don't
[1:16:14] care how right you are on your doctrine.
[1:16:15] If your if your life isn't there, you're
[1:16:18] not coming up anyways. I'd rather be
[1:16:20] right in my spirit than right in my
[1:16:22] doctrine because the spirit will bring
[1:16:24] you to the right doctrine.
[1:16:30] We can look around and see how the whole
[1:16:32] world is chasing after their feelings.
[1:16:34] People will literally tell you their
[1:16:36] feelings mean more to them than the
[1:16:37] truth. They will change the facts.
[1:16:39] They'll believe what they want to fact.
[1:16:40] The fact can be right in front of them,
[1:16:41] but they will believe their feelings
[1:16:43] because they've been taught your
[1:16:44] feelings are your truth.
[1:16:47] That'll send you to hell.
[1:16:50] That's a horrible place to live because
[1:16:53] you become your own god. You set your
[1:16:56] own standards, your own moral standards.
[1:16:58] You what you believe is right, no matter
[1:17:00] what anyone says.
[1:17:02] It's all about selflove. Amen. That's
[1:17:05] all that is. That's right.
[1:17:15] I'm gonna read out of James. I really
[1:17:16] like James 3
[1:17:19] 13-18. Let's see what time I got.
[1:17:24] This is going to kind of put everything
[1:17:25] in perspective of what we've talked
[1:17:27] about so
[1:17:30] far. Hang on one second.
[1:17:36] Sorry. James 13, I'm sorry.
[1:17:41] 3:13. Who is a wise man and endued with
[1:17:45] knowledge among you? Who is a message
[1:17:49] believer?
[1:17:51] That's what he's asking right here,
[1:17:53] right? Who of you are message believer?
[1:17:54] Y'all are message believers.
[1:17:57] Let that person show out of a good
[1:17:59] conversation his works with meekness of
[1:18:04] wisdom.
[1:18:06] That means a mild disposition a gentle
[1:18:09] spirit.
[1:18:11] When you disagree with a message
[1:18:13] believer, how many times do you get a
[1:18:15] gentle spirit in response?
[1:18:18] Go talk to a preacher sometime.
[1:18:21] disagree with them sometime.
[1:18:24] See how gentle their disposition is, how
[1:18:26] gentle their spirit is.
[1:18:31] He said, "But if you have bitter envying
[1:18:33] and strife in your hearts," you know
[1:18:36] what that means? That bitter envying,
[1:18:38] it's harsh
[1:18:40] zeal. Very zealous for what we believe.
[1:18:44] I'm very zealous for I believe, but does
[1:18:45] it come across as a gentle spirit or a
[1:18:48] harsh spirit?
[1:18:50] True. And a contentious
[1:18:53] spirit. Can you talk to someone without
[1:18:56] becoming contentious? Can you let your
[1:18:59] old self die and just let Christ come
[1:19:01] and manifest through you and express his
[1:19:03] love through you? Or do you have to
[1:19:04] prove you're right and they're
[1:19:08] wrong? It's a lack. You know, you know
[1:19:10] when you when you argue have to argue
[1:19:12] about something, you know what it comes
[1:19:13] down to? You have a lack of confidence
[1:19:15] in what you believe.
[1:19:18] Because why do I have to prove something
[1:19:19] if I already know it? My last name is
[1:19:22] bond trigger. Argue with me and try to
[1:19:25] prove that's not
[1:19:26] true. I will laugh in your face and walk
[1:19:31] away. You're stupid, man. I know I'm a
[1:19:33] bond track. I was born. I got a birth
[1:19:34] certificate.
[1:19:37] But if I'm not sure about something that
[1:19:39] I have to prove it, that's when you
[1:19:40] start getting content. Well, I'm not
[1:19:42] really positive that I really know who I
[1:19:44] say I am. I'm a message believer and I'm
[1:19:45] going to prove it to you.
[1:19:48] There's something wrong with that
[1:19:49] attitude. There's a lack of confidence.
[1:19:52] You need more revelation of who you
[1:19:53] really are because otherwise you don't
[1:19:55] have to prove it.
[1:19:58] If someone wants to disagree and say,
[1:19:59] "I'm wrong on my diet." Okay. Someone
[1:20:01] come up to me after I preach say,
[1:20:02] "Brother Phil, I disagree with you."
[1:20:03] Okay. I didn't make it up myself. God
[1:20:06] gave it to me. Go talk to him. Amen.
[1:20:11] There's nothing to prove. God vindicates
[1:20:13] who you
[1:20:15] are. Amen. If you are or not, he still
[1:20:18] vindicates it.
[1:20:22] He said, "But if you have bitter envy
[1:20:24] and strife in your hearts, glory not and
[1:20:27] lie not against the truth." What does it
[1:20:29] mean glory not? Don't boast about your
[1:20:30] will. Well, I'm a mess believer. I know
[1:20:32] this. I can tell you about the serpent
[1:20:33] seed. I can tell you about the seven
[1:20:35] seals. I can tell you about the godhead.
[1:20:36] I can tell you about all these
[1:20:39] things with that attitude. Who cares?
[1:20:43] Who cares what you know?
[1:20:47] He said, "Lie not against the truth."
[1:20:48] What does that mean to lie against the
[1:20:50] truth? You're bearing a false witness
[1:20:52] because truth does not produce that kind
[1:20:54] of spirit. You might say, "I'm a message
[1:20:56] believer, but your spirit is producing
[1:20:58] something besides what the message
[1:21:00] produces. You are lying against the
[1:21:01] truth." Because your spirit is
[1:21:03] expressing something that's not truth.
[1:21:11] That spirit that spirit that that that
[1:21:14] born again Christ that spirit of Christ
[1:21:15] it is a spirit of liberty. It's not
[1:21:17] about force. It's not about a control.
[1:21:19] It's not about forcing you to believe
[1:21:21] what I believe. You need to do this. You
[1:21:23] need to do this. You need to follow my
[1:21:25] rules. That is not what the spirit of
[1:21:27] liberty does. That's right.
[1:21:31] And when we have the wrong spirit, the
[1:21:33] wrong attitude, we're calling that
[1:21:35] spirit a lie because it's not a spirit
[1:21:37] of
[1:21:39] liberty. Verse 15, this this wisdom
[1:21:42] descendeth not from
[1:21:44] above, but is earthly, sensual, and
[1:21:49] devilish.
[1:21:51] Let's look at those three words. What
[1:21:53] does it mean when it's earthly? It means
[1:21:55] that it's just something that you've
[1:21:57] been educated into. It's not been
[1:21:59] revealed to you. It's up here in your
[1:22:01] mind. It has not come into your heart.
[1:22:03] Because when it comes into your heart,
[1:22:05] it produces something different. But
[1:22:06] when it's in your mind, then you got to
[1:22:08] argue and force and control and prove,
[1:22:10] prove, prove. It's just an education.
[1:22:14] And I've heard a lot, you have too,
[1:22:16] we've heard a lot of educated preachers
[1:22:17] get in the pulpit and preach some really
[1:22:19] amazing things. And yet it was nothing
[1:22:21] more than an education because their
[1:22:23] attitude that went with it was not the
[1:22:25] spirit of Christ.
[1:22:30] It's an education. Sensual. It means
[1:22:32] it's just emotional. It reacts
[1:22:35] emotionally.
[1:22:36] Go. You know, Brother Bram talking about
[1:22:38] that Pentecostal cat. As long as you're
[1:22:40] ping it the right rubbing it the right
[1:22:41] way. Oh, it's just purring away. Rub it
[1:22:43] the wrong way and watch it scratch you.
[1:22:49] It's getting uncomfortable for
[1:22:51] me. Watch it react. Watch the emotional
[1:22:55] reaction because like, oh my goodness,
[1:22:57] we don't agree with each other. I can't
[1:22:59] fellowship with you. We're going to
[1:23:01] split off. I'm going to start another
[1:23:02] church over here. I'm going to do this.
[1:23:03] I'm going to do that because we can't
[1:23:04] get along.
[1:23:10] It also reacts emotionally the other
[1:23:13] way. another way because you're happy
[1:23:16] and you have this education of what the
[1:23:19] message is and you believe these
[1:23:20] doctrines and you following the rules
[1:23:22] and you go to church and everyone's
[1:23:24] having a good time, the spirit's flowing
[1:23:25] and you're happy and you're singing and
[1:23:27] you're preaching and you're shouting and
[1:23:28] whatever and everything's
[1:23:30] wonderful, but it's just up here.
[1:23:34] And how many people are being deceived
[1:23:36] and they sit in messy pews and as long
[1:23:38] as they're happy, they're a good message
[1:23:40] believer. Amen. But when the happiness
[1:23:42] goes away, then they just react until
[1:23:45] that emotional that downness, that
[1:23:46] depression, and then they sit in the in
[1:23:48] the pew just kind of staring at you.
[1:23:50] Why? Because the happiness went away.
[1:23:51] What is it? It's just an emotion.
[1:23:58] Some of you remember uh Jerry Bell. He
[1:24:00] used to be the pastor down in Dixon. And
[1:24:02] I remember when I started going to
[1:24:03] church there, I was an emotional roller
[1:24:05] coaster. Oh my goodness. I couldn't
[1:24:07] stand myself. And sometime I come to
[1:24:08] church, I was happy and shouting, you
[1:24:10] know, and praising God. And sometime I
[1:24:12] come there and I was so miserable and
[1:24:14] depressed looking. I just kind of sit
[1:24:16] there. And one time he said to me,
[1:24:17] "Brother Phil," he said, "Sometime when
[1:24:18] you come to church, you look so
[1:24:20] miserable. I just want to eat a can of
[1:24:23] worms." I'm thinking I would have joined
[1:24:26] you. Why? Because I was just an emotion.
[1:24:30] My religion was an emotion. There was
[1:24:32] something in my mind and I had an idea
[1:24:34] what it meant to be a mo a message
[1:24:36] believer, but I couldn't produce it. And
[1:24:37] so I was up and down and in and out and
[1:24:39] up and down and in and out.
[1:24:42] That's all that human love can produce.
[1:24:48] And then the last word is
[1:24:50] devilish. You know what that means? It
[1:24:52] means resembling an evil spirit or
[1:24:53] proceeding from an evil spirit. Even
[1:24:56] though you're quoting the scriptures,
[1:24:58] you're quoting the prophet, your hair is
[1:25:00] right, your clothes is right, you're
[1:25:01] saying the right things, but with that
[1:25:04] wrong spirit.
[1:25:06] Devilish means you're resembling a demon
[1:25:09] spirit. That's exactly right.
[1:25:12] Amen. That's hardcore, friends, but that
[1:25:14] is so true.
[1:25:16] And how many times do you fellowship
[1:25:18] with believers and you can see there's
[1:25:20] something wrong? there's something
[1:25:21] that's not quite right there and they're
[1:25:23] holding a grudge or they're holding
[1:25:25] something against him and they talking
[1:25:26] about this and they're always
[1:25:27] complaining about something and you
[1:25:29] recognize that they're being influenced
[1:25:30] by an evil spirit no matter how holy
[1:25:33] they look.
[1:25:41] Verse 16, for where envying and strife
[1:25:43] is, there is confusion, which means
[1:25:45] instability and disorder, and every evil
[1:25:49] work. Exactly right. Every evil work.
[1:25:54] That's why you see so many times when
[1:25:56] the pastor is in the wrong spirit. You
[1:25:57] see the whole church just doing all
[1:25:59] kinds of crazy stuff. Religious as can
[1:26:01] be. Divisions clicks here. These people
[1:26:04] don't recognize though or don't
[1:26:05] fellowship with those whatever. It's
[1:26:07] every evil work. But when you see unity
[1:26:10] among the body, you know something's
[1:26:12] going right, man. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:16] Praise the Lord. Oh, you love to see
[1:26:18] that. You know who else loves to see
[1:26:20] that? Jesus Christ loves that. He hates
[1:26:23] the spirit of division. He hates someone
[1:26:25] who brings division among the body, but
[1:26:27] he loves a spirit of unity.
[1:26:30] And you got to get with yourself and him
[1:26:32] first. And when you get it right with
[1:26:34] him, then you're going to have it with
[1:26:35] the people around you, too.
[1:26:38] So then, what does this real look like?
[1:26:41] If you have real wisdom, the revelation
[1:26:43] from above, verse
[1:26:44] 17, but the wisdom that is from above is
[1:26:47] first
[1:26:48] pure. That means it's not mixing seed.
[1:26:51] It's not taking my quote and my idea
[1:26:53] along with brother Brandham's quote
[1:26:54] along with this preacher's quote, but
[1:26:56] it's the word that's been revealed to
[1:26:58] you.
[1:27:00] You're not mixing with your own idea. He
[1:27:02] says, "First pure, then
[1:27:04] peaceable,
[1:27:06] gentle." Oh my. Get a ministers meeting
[1:27:09] and let everyone be peaceable and
[1:27:11] gentle.
[1:27:15] Get get people together where they're
[1:27:17] peaceable and gentle with you. Not just
[1:27:19] on church day,
[1:27:22] but when you go home, does that same
[1:27:24] spirit dominate your house? Is it the
[1:27:26] same spirit that's going on in your
[1:27:28] home? Or do we treat each other, you
[1:27:30] know, though? This is my brother here at
[1:27:31] church. I'm going to treat him
[1:27:32] wonderful. But my wife, my goodness
[1:27:34] sake, she just irritates me.
[1:27:39] Are you peaceable and gentle about it?
[1:27:41] Now I I know I have no clue what I'm
[1:27:42] talking about, so just ignore that.
[1:27:50] And then I love this one. Easy to be
[1:27:55] entreated. That
[1:27:57] means
[1:28:00] submissive. I want to talk to brother
[1:28:02] Joe. Brother Joe, this is something, you
[1:28:04] know, you you did something, you know,
[1:28:06] last last time I was here, you walked by
[1:28:08] me and and and you never shook my hand.
[1:28:10] Sorry. No, you know, I I'm I know you
[1:28:13] might be sorry, but I just I just I'm
[1:28:14] just holding a
[1:28:19] grudge. Easily to be in, easy to talk
[1:28:22] to. Have you ever seen a message
[1:28:24] preacher who is submissive? You have.
[1:28:25] You got one right back there. But
[1:28:27] someone who's submissive, like you can
[1:28:28] go to them and talk to them. I know I
[1:28:31] keep bringing up preachers, but this is
[1:28:32] where it starts. It starts from the
[1:28:34] pulpit.
[1:28:36] It's easy to talk to that person say, I
[1:28:39] I you said something I don't agree. I
[1:28:41] don't I don't I don't see it that way.
[1:28:43] You know what brother Thomas says? Well,
[1:28:45] you're just wrong. I'm the pastor. Who
[1:28:47] do you think you are? I'm going to pray
[1:28:49] for you to cast that demon out of
[1:28:52] you. Never happened.
[1:28:56] He said he'll say, and he's not he's not
[1:28:58] going to compromise. He said, "Well, if
[1:29:00] you believe it that way, that's fine."
[1:29:01] No, it's not. He's going to take you to
[1:29:04] the word. He might be very firm about
[1:29:07] it. He said, "Now, this is the way I see
[1:29:09] it. This is why I preached it. This is
[1:29:10] why I do. And what we're going to do is
[1:29:11] going to we're going to pray and let God
[1:29:13] come and if I'm wrong, then God open my
[1:29:15] eyes. If you're wrong, God open your
[1:29:16] eyes."
[1:29:19] And you know what happens? You walk out
[1:29:21] of there knowing one thing for sure.
[1:29:22] Whether you're right or wrong, that man
[1:29:24] loves you.
[1:29:26] Because easy to be entreated. He didn't
[1:29:29] chop you off at the knees just because
[1:29:31] you didn't agree with him. That's right.
[1:29:33] Ain't that powerful?
[1:29:38] But what's the problem is so many times
[1:29:39] we take things personally. It hurt my
[1:29:41] feelings. You didn't agree with what I
[1:29:43] preached. So it hurt my feelings. Well,
[1:29:45] see if I come back
[1:29:46] here. What a little cry, baby.
[1:29:50] I'm gonna hold a grudge now.
[1:29:53] I'm not going to forgive you, brother
[1:29:54] Joe.
[1:29:56] You know what happens if I don't forgive
[1:29:58] brother Joe? First of all, why would I
[1:30:00] hold it? He has nothing to be forgiven
[1:30:02] for. That's right. That's just my own
[1:30:04] idea.
[1:30:06] My own selfish, well, well, I need to be
[1:30:08] treated a certain way. Well, if you
[1:30:10] don't treat me the way I want to be
[1:30:11] treated, then I got my poor little
[1:30:12] feeling hurt.
[1:30:17] Now, I know that's hurting me, but I
[1:30:19] know it's hurting some of you, too. So,
[1:30:20] go ahead and smile.
[1:30:24] And if you're not there, God bless you.
[1:30:26] You are further alone than me.
[1:30:30] Why is it hard to let things go? Because
[1:30:33] we makes us vulnerable. Because if I
[1:30:37] don't hold that grudge against brother
[1:30:38] Joe, you know what he might do to me?
[1:30:41] The same thing. Then I get my feeling
[1:30:43] hurt again. Oh my goodness. Then I feel
[1:30:46] twice as bad towards him. But why don't
[1:30:48] I just let it go and never get the
[1:30:50] grudge to begin with? He don't want to
[1:30:52] shake my hand. Who am I? Who am I that I
[1:30:54] have to be respected? Who am I that you
[1:30:56] have to treat me a certain way? Who am I
[1:30:58] that Oh my goodness, look how you
[1:30:59] treated poor me.
[1:31:05] I'm going to go sit down.
[1:31:12] Easy to beat and treated. Full of
[1:31:14] mercy. Have mercy for the poor guy.
[1:31:17] Maybe he had something on his mind.
[1:31:19] Maybe your wife did something that
[1:31:20] whatever it's just have mercy. Goodness
[1:31:24] sakes. Do do you know when we do
[1:31:26] something wrong, don't we cry for mercy?
[1:31:30] How about giving mercy then?
[1:31:33] Who are we to to ask mercy from God and
[1:31:36] then turn and hold a grudge against
[1:31:38] someone else?
[1:31:44] Human love.
[1:31:46] It's not a spirit of liberty.
[1:31:48] It can be, but a lot of time it's not.
[1:31:51] Don't trust
[1:31:53] it. Full of mercy and good fruits
[1:31:56] without
[1:31:57] partiality. Without partiality. I don't
[1:32:00] care who you are. You I'm going to treat
[1:32:02] you the same. This is why he's saying I
[1:32:04] don't care if you're the biggest name
[1:32:05] preacher in the in the message or you
[1:32:07] just walked through the door the first
[1:32:08] time. You treat them the same.
[1:32:13] Can I get worse than that? You might be
[1:32:14] the most holy preacher and that person
[1:32:17] might walk through that door looking
[1:32:18] like a prostitute.
[1:32:20] Do you still treat them the same?
[1:32:24] Ain't that amazing? See, if you're
[1:32:26] legalistic, you don't. That's right.
[1:32:30] Legalism is what Satan uses. Uses your
[1:32:33] human love to make you legalistic.
[1:32:37] put my ideas, my standard, and if you
[1:32:40] don't meet my standard because I'm so
[1:32:42] important, then you're just wrong
[1:32:46] and you're not holy enough to hang
[1:32:47] around with me. So, you go sit somewhere
[1:32:52] else without
[1:32:54] hypocrisy. You're genuine.
[1:32:57] And that is one of the most telling
[1:32:59] things that I have noticed about
[1:33:01] believers is you can tell a lot of times
[1:33:04] who's
[1:33:05] genuine. And people who are not
[1:33:07] believers can tell who's genuine.
[1:33:10] That's powerful.
[1:33:12] Because you know you sisters, you go to
[1:33:14] Walmart and people can tell that you're
[1:33:16] odd.
[1:33:19] You're different. You were your you were
[1:33:22] your difference. I shouldn't have said
[1:33:23] odd, but to the world you are.
[1:33:25] The prophet said you were okay. So you
[1:33:29] wear your holiness. It's right out
[1:33:30] there. Everybody can see you're
[1:33:31] different. See, for us brothers, it's
[1:33:34] different because we have to show that
[1:33:36] by the spirit on us. It's way more
[1:33:39] difficult sometime because I can walk
[1:33:41] through Walmart right now and no one
[1:33:42] looks at me
[1:33:44] twice. But if I am in contact with
[1:33:47] someone, can they see there's something
[1:33:49] different about me? Come on.
[1:33:51] Can they see that that brother that you
[1:33:53] know the people you work with, you might
[1:33:55] never preach a sermon, you might never
[1:33:57] say you're a Christian, but they can see
[1:33:58] there's something different about that.
[1:34:01] Because if they don't see that, there's
[1:34:02] something wrong with you. Amen.
[1:34:05] If they can't tell you have a different
[1:34:06] spirit than the spirit of the world,
[1:34:08] there's something you need more Christ.
[1:34:11] I'm not saying I'm not decing anybody.
[1:34:13] I'm not saying you're not born again.
[1:34:15] But what you have to do is die to this
[1:34:16] old flesh a little bit more so Christ
[1:34:18] can express himself, which is the whole
[1:34:20] purpose of being born again.
[1:34:24] You ever have someone say something like
[1:34:26] that? It's one of the greatest
[1:34:27] compliments I can think of. You know,
[1:34:29] you you walking, you know, you're
[1:34:30] talking to a stranger or something, they
[1:34:31] say, "You're a man of God, aren't
[1:34:34] you?" Never talked about Christ or
[1:34:36] religion or anything. Someone said to
[1:34:39] one of your sister, "You got a really
[1:34:40] great spirit because just because you
[1:34:41] wear long hair doesn't mean you have a
[1:34:43] good spirit about you." You've seen
[1:34:44] plenty of that. But someone says
[1:34:46] something about you, there's something
[1:34:47] different about you. It's way goes way
[1:34:50] way more than your hair and your dress.
[1:34:53] There's something genuine. It's not
[1:34:56] hypocrisy. You're not just a Christian
[1:34:58] on Sunday morning.
[1:35:02] You go home and you die to yourself.
[1:35:04] You're easily entreated by your kids.
[1:35:14] So what does godly this godly wisdom
[1:35:16] James talking about? What does it not
[1:35:17] try to do?
[1:35:19] It doesn't try to control someone else.
[1:35:24] When you're easily intreated, when you
[1:35:26] are submissive, you're not trying to
[1:35:28] control someone
[1:35:30] else. You're not trying to force them to
[1:35:33] see things your
[1:35:35] way. You're not trying to get them to do
[1:35:37] something that you want.
[1:35:40] God allows you to choose for yourself
[1:35:43] and that is freedom.
[1:35:46] We'll get that to this afternoon. Let me
[1:35:47] give you an example. Brother
[1:35:49] Brandham, what time did I start? Is it
[1:35:52] time to quit?
[1:35:57] See, I forgot to check what time I come
[1:35:58] out here.
[1:36:00] No, it's
[1:36:03] not. Prophet speaking. He said,
[1:36:06] "Sometime ago, I was in a dispute on
[1:36:08] income tax. They said to me, why your
[1:36:10] trustees are nothing but puppets, I
[1:36:13] suppose. I said, if I had a trustee on
[1:36:16] the board that had a different idea and
[1:36:18] wouldn't stand up and would express his
[1:36:20] own views of it, I'd throw him off the
[1:36:23] board."
[1:36:29] Yes, sir. though is contrary to my
[1:36:32] belief.
[1:36:33] I want him to express what he thinks is
[1:36:35] right. That's what I got him there for.
[1:36:37] See what see what he says about it. But
[1:36:40] we have
[1:36:42] that. How
[1:36:44] many Let me get blunt here. How many
[1:36:47] messaged pastors will say that's what I
[1:36:54] do? Can I keep going? How many how many
[1:36:59] husbands say that's what I do with my
[1:37:02] wife, with my
[1:37:05] kids when they have a different opinion?
[1:37:07] I know I'm in trouble here. I am so on
[1:37:10] thin
[1:37:10] ice. How many husbands treat their wife
[1:37:13] that God gave you that woman for a
[1:37:15] purpose? Not to say that you're right
[1:37:17] all the time.
[1:37:23] Quiet in here.
[1:37:27] She has a mind.
[1:37:29] This ain't in my notes. Okay. So,
[1:37:33] I don't know what I'm talking about. All
[1:37:35] right. Never experienced this. But
[1:37:38] there's a reason that God gave that
[1:37:39] person to you. There's a reason God
[1:37:41] gives God gave you kids and sometimes
[1:37:43] they have really good ideas.
[1:37:47] Are you easily
[1:37:50] entreated? Are you gentle? is your
[1:37:52] wisdom. You say your son comes say,
[1:37:54] "Dad, I really believe you should get me
[1:37:56] that 2026 Ford 150 out there. You're 12
[1:38:00] years old. I know, Dad, but I really
[1:38:02] need
[1:38:04] that." Are you gentle with your
[1:38:09] wisdom? Or is it go shut up, you dumb
[1:38:12] kid?
[1:38:14] I know you wouldn't do that, but I'm
[1:38:16] just asking.
[1:38:23] the prophet, the prophet of the
[1:38:26] age mentioned personally in the Bible.
[1:38:30] He did not run his church like I know
[1:38:32] everything and you know nothing.
[1:38:35] He said that trust is there for a
[1:38:36] purpose and if they disagree with me and
[1:38:39] they don't say it, they don't speak up
[1:38:40] and say it. And he could have told by
[1:38:42] the way. Oh, that's right, brother
[1:38:44] Brandham. I agree with you. He could
[1:38:45] have turned and say, "Phil, you don't
[1:38:46] agree with me.
[1:38:48] You're lying to me. That's right. I'm
[1:38:51] just trying to be popular with you.
[1:38:53] Yeah,
[1:38:54] exactly. Just want to go along with it.
[1:39:01] See, demon demons are not just about
[1:39:04] getting us to live evil life or get us
[1:39:05] to go out to to fall to our addictions
[1:39:07] or go out and get drunk or do get high
[1:39:10] or run around or something like that.
[1:39:11] That's not what it is because that's so
[1:39:13] easily seen. That's not dis that's not
[1:39:15] deceptive at all. But what demons like
[1:39:17] to do is get you to live a good holy
[1:39:19] life where where you're you're you're
[1:39:21] good, you're religious, you're loving,
[1:39:22] you're kindhearted, you're nice to
[1:39:23] everybody, you're always doing something
[1:39:25] for someone in the
[1:39:27] church. And you people look at, man,
[1:39:29] that a wonderful person, that sister,
[1:39:31] she's just so sweet and kind and nice.
[1:39:33] And then you get to know her a little
[1:39:34] bit and she's still got that dominating
[1:39:36] iron disposition.
[1:39:41] That's where it gets deceptive because
[1:39:43] you think we think because we do all
[1:39:45] these good things, we follow all these
[1:39:46] rules, then that makes in a good place,
[1:39:48] good standing with God, God's saying,
[1:39:50] God's looking and says, "You still are
[1:39:51] perverted because you are acting like a
[1:39:54] male." I'm not talking about male and
[1:39:56] female. I'm talking about as a church. I
[1:39:59] am talking about male and
[1:40:01] female. And
[1:40:05] if oh goodness sake brother if your wife
[1:40:08] has that
[1:40:09] disposition then what do you have
[1:40:15] because if you both have that male
[1:40:19] dispos disposition the the leadership
[1:40:22] you got
[1:40:23] chaos. And how many times, oh my, how
[1:40:28] many times have you looked at a couple
[1:40:30] and you
[1:40:31] recognize,
[1:40:33] yep, you folded, brother. You gave up.
[1:40:37] You quit the fight for peace. He said,
[1:40:40] but you're supposed to be easily
[1:40:41] intreated. I said, do not compromise,
[1:40:43] too. There's a difference.
[1:40:47] You got to stand for the truth. You got
[1:40:48] to stand for what's right. And you can
[1:40:50] do it from a gentle disposition.
[1:40:56] So, I don't know about that. Well, let
[1:40:57] me give you an example what the prophet
[1:40:58] gave. Remember the the brother came to
[1:41:00] the prophet said, "My wife is horrible
[1:41:02] and and I can't get her to act right,
[1:41:04] and I keep trying to cast the devil off
[1:41:06] of her."
[1:41:08] He said, "You're going about it the
[1:41:09] wrong way." Well, what should I do? What
[1:41:12] do you say? Buy her chocolate. You got
[1:41:14] me right there, boy. I'll come along.
[1:41:19] buy chocolate to cast off a
[1:41:22] devil. Easily intreated, gentle, kind,
[1:41:28] love. Look what that brother had to do.
[1:41:32] Die to himself. He was not being
[1:41:35] submissive to his wife. He was being
[1:41:37] submissive to the Holy Spirit. That the
[1:41:38] Holy Spirit could come and work through
[1:41:40] him and bring that spirit, cast that
[1:41:43] spirit out and bring her to subjection.
[1:41:46] Because if you have iron disposition,
[1:41:48] fighting iron disposition, all you got
[1:41:50] are sparks.
[1:41:52] You're going to crush each other.
[1:41:54] Probably get divorced.
[1:42:03] So we manipulate people to meet our
[1:42:09] needs. Let me let me give you another
[1:42:12] example. A miracle happens. I meet an
[1:42:16] old lady and fall in
[1:42:22] love and I want to marry
[1:42:25] her. So what do I do? I start being
[1:42:28] really nice to her. I start being
[1:42:31] charming. I try to make her laugh. I be
[1:42:34] dishonest and let her think that I have
[1:42:36] a lot of money.
[1:42:40] I'm trying to manipulate her to get from
[1:42:42] her something that I I want to give her
[1:42:45] love, but I want her love
[1:42:47] back. And there's nothing wrong with
[1:42:49] that as long as you're not being
[1:42:51] dishonest. But the problem is a lot of
[1:42:53] times and our actions are dishonest and
[1:42:55] after you get married, she looks at you
[1:42:56] say, "Boy, I you you sure changed when
[1:42:59] we got married." Why? Because I was
[1:43:01] being hypocrite to begin with. Look how
[1:43:02] charming I am.
[1:43:05] Just be genuine. Be real. They're going
[1:43:07] to find out
[1:43:10] anyways. But what is it? I'm giving you
[1:43:12] something because I want something back.
[1:43:15] It's selfish.
[1:43:17] Remember what brother Brandon was
[1:43:18] talking to those young men one time? And
[1:43:20] I'm just going to chop this up. But he
[1:43:22] said, he said, "Now you all love your
[1:43:23] wives. You married your your wives." But
[1:43:25] he said, "What if before you got
[1:43:26] married, you went to that woman and and
[1:43:28] you said, "Honey, I'd like to marry
[1:43:29] you." She said, "Well, I will marry you,
[1:43:30] but I would be happy with this other
[1:43:33] brother." He said, "Do you love her
[1:43:35] right? Do you love her enough to say it
[1:43:36] will go go with her even though you love
[1:43:39] her with all your human hearted
[1:43:42] love? See, that's what agape does. It
[1:43:46] does what's best for the other person.
[1:43:49] Human love does what's best for me.
[1:43:52] That's what you die to,
[1:43:55] friends. You got to get something out.
[1:43:57] We're trying to control the outcome.
[1:43:59] See, this is you. You can't control
[1:44:02] Jesus like that. He won't be controlled
[1:44:03] by
[1:44:04] emotional
[1:44:06] appeal. Have you ever wasted your time
[1:44:10] praying, trying to appeal to God's
[1:44:12] emotions? Look how miserable I am. Look
[1:44:14] how I'm stumbled. Look how weak I am. Oh
[1:44:16] my goodness, I'm so sick. Oh, this stuff
[1:44:18] is Oh, God. Don't you feel sorry for
[1:44:21] me. He ain't moved.
[1:44:25] He ain't moved by that, friends.
[1:44:27] He's not moved by your self-pity, by
[1:44:29] your victimhood.
[1:44:31] He's moved by faith.
[1:44:41] Luke
[1:44:43] 7 31. And the Lord said, "Weren to then
[1:44:46] shall I liken the men of this gener
[1:44:48] generation?" What are they like? They're
[1:44:51] like unto children, sitting in the
[1:44:52] marketplace, and calling one to another,
[1:44:54] and saying, "We have piped unto you. You
[1:44:55] have not danced. We have mourned to you.
[1:44:57] You have not wept.
[1:45:01] Look how religious I am. Look what I'm
[1:45:03] doing. And you're not responding to me
[1:45:04] the way I want you to
[1:45:11] respond. Let me give you another
[1:45:15] example. I'm almost done here. I
[1:45:20] think this will get me in trouble again.
[1:45:22] Okay. So,
[1:45:24] sister husband's coming home a couple
[1:45:26] hours and you're just in a good mood and
[1:45:28] you just really appreciate your husband
[1:45:29] and you say, "I'm gonna do something
[1:45:31] special for dinner." So, you make his
[1:45:32] favorite meal and you go ahead and um
[1:45:36] you you bake some bread, homemade bread.
[1:45:38] He loves homemade bread. And so, you go
[1:45:40] a little out of the way and make this
[1:45:41] really great meal. He comes in, sits
[1:45:43] down to eat, and the whole house smells
[1:45:44] like baked bread. There's nothing better
[1:45:46] than that smell. And it's just amazing,
[1:45:47] right? He sits down, he eats about three
[1:45:49] servings, everything. He said, "I got to
[1:45:50] go more of the grass." Gets up and walks
[1:45:52] out.
[1:45:55] Never the first thing, a thank you. That
[1:45:58] was good. Any appreciation at
[1:46:00] all? Now, before I go any further,
[1:46:03] brother, if you do that, you're a
[1:46:05] jerk. I'm not justifying that
[1:46:11] behavior. But here's my point. And I
[1:46:14] know you sisters don't do this, but what
[1:46:16] happens as a a
[1:46:18] typical woman
[1:46:22] after all I
[1:46:24] done and not even a simple thank
[1:46:27] you. What? Oh my goodness, I am so
[1:46:31] underappreciated. I slave all the time
[1:46:33] here. I raise the kids. I take care of
[1:46:35] that and no one ever appreciates
[1:46:37] me because of one missed thank you.
[1:46:41] And we dive down that rabbit hole into
[1:46:44] wallowing in our self-pity and our
[1:46:45] victimhood and oh woe is
[1:46:48] me protecting myself because I got my
[1:46:51] feelings
[1:46:54] hurt. So an hour later husband comes in
[1:46:58] got the got the lawn mode and sister
[1:47:01] she's on her tablet and she's on her
[1:47:04] Facebook. Oh
[1:47:07] good. You have a good day honey?
[1:47:11] Yeah. Anything you want to talk about?
[1:47:13] No, everything's fine. You seem like
[1:47:15] something's bothering you. No, I'm
[1:47:18] fine.
[1:47:20] Okay. And it's just chilly the whole
[1:47:23] night. It's time to go to bed. Again,
[1:47:26] friends, I have no idea what I'm talking
[1:47:28] about. Don't take this serious. I don't
[1:47:29] I've never experienced
[1:47:31] this. Time to go to bed. They get in
[1:47:34] bed. She lays down. She looks over him.
[1:47:36] said, "Oh, by the way, you're welcome
[1:47:38] for dinner." And rolls over and turns
[1:47:40] off the
[1:47:42] light. Huh? What do you mean? And the
[1:47:45] reality is that poor dumb guy probably
[1:47:47] has no clue what's going on, but he's
[1:47:49] supposed to read her
[1:47:52] mind. He said, "What do you mean? I I
[1:47:56] don't want to talk about it. I don't
[1:47:57] want to talk about it." But you did not
[1:47:59] even say, "I I made bread for you. I did
[1:48:00] this and you never appreciate me. I
[1:48:02] don't want to talk about it." Rolls back
[1:48:03] over.
[1:48:06] And the poor guy, he's laying there. I'm
[1:48:08] sorry. I didn't even think I I my my
[1:48:10] mind was busy about something.
[1:48:14] I What if she would have stopped
[1:48:16] protecting herself long enough when he
[1:48:18] comes in, she could have said something
[1:48:20] like, "Honey, did you like dinner?" "Oh,
[1:48:22] yeah. It was wonderful. I just I just
[1:48:24] You didn't say anything. I just wanted
[1:48:25] to make sure that it was okay with you."
[1:48:27] You know what would have happened? He'd
[1:48:28] have been growling at her feet. Honey, I
[1:48:30] am so sorry. I appreciate what you do
[1:48:33] for me. I I would never do that on
[1:48:35] purpose. I love you so much. And my mind
[1:48:36] was just busy. I never thought about
[1:48:38] that. I appreciate you so
[1:48:40] much. Think of the atmosphere in the
[1:48:42] home the rest of that evening instead of
[1:48:44] that ice
[1:48:46] box. You know why she doesn't do it or
[1:48:49] why he doesn't do it? Because you had to
[1:48:51] humble yourself. You got to die to
[1:48:53] yourself and make yourself vulnerable
[1:48:54] and maybe get hurt again.
[1:48:58] That's what human love will do for
[1:49:01] you. All
[1:49:14] right, let me let me w wind this down.
[1:49:18] You know, Brother Bram said, "Living for
[1:49:19] others is eternal
[1:49:21] life." And so, how many
[1:49:23] times do we decide we're going to start
[1:49:26] living for
[1:49:27] others and we go about doing good deeds
[1:49:29] for other people?
[1:49:31] And we make sure people know that we're
[1:49:33] living for others.
[1:49:37] You ain't living for others. That's
[1:49:39] right. You're living for yourself.
[1:49:41] That's right.
[1:49:44] I know. We took up a collection for that
[1:49:46] that church over in in uh Africa that we
[1:49:48] needed. I Boy, not not bragging, but I
[1:49:51] dug pretty deep on that one.
[1:49:58] so concerned with people's opinions of
[1:50:00] us. What are you thinking of me?
[1:50:04] What is what is my reputation right
[1:50:08] now? Demanding respect, seeking self-
[1:50:13] advancement. It's selfishness,
[1:50:16] friends. And spirit of liberty will not
[1:50:20] do that in you.
[1:50:30] Let me say this one more thing. We try
[1:50:32] to
[1:50:33] quit. When we make a
[1:50:37] sacrifice and we make
[1:50:40] sure that people know my
[1:50:43] sacrifice. Look how hard I worked to do
[1:50:46] this. Look what I've done for you. Look
[1:50:47] at the meal I cooked for you. Look at
[1:50:49] whatever you know whatever I studied and
[1:50:51] studied to get come up with this message
[1:50:53] for
[1:50:54] you and you're acknowledging your
[1:50:57] sacrifice. What you are doing is you're
[1:51:00] walking up to Calvary. Say, "Jesus, come
[1:51:02] on down. Come on
[1:51:03] down. My turn for my sacrifice to be
[1:51:08] worshiped. Let me hang from the cross
[1:51:10] for a while so everyone can look at
[1:51:12] me. Look at my sacrifice. Ain't I a
[1:51:15] wonderful person?
[1:51:22] That is what human love can
[1:51:27] produce. So, we're going to stop there
[1:51:30] and I think it gets a little happier
[1:51:32] this
[1:51:33] afternoon. Can't promise you. I
[1:51:36] appreciate you. You guys listen great
[1:51:38] this morning. Go ahead and stand.
[1:51:51] Isn't God good to us?
[1:51:54] He He You say, "Well, what was this all
[1:51:56] about this morning?" Is he does not want
[1:51:59] us to be deceived into some kind of
[1:52:01] false worship, some kind of hybrid
[1:52:04] religion where we are worshiping oursel
[1:52:06] and worshiping Christ at the same time.
[1:52:07] He And here's the thing. Here's the
[1:52:09] thing, friends. Oh, this is exciting.
[1:52:12] If you're born
[1:52:14] again, everything you have need is in
[1:52:17] that C gene of God because it is part of
[1:52:20] God. The rapture is in there. Rapturing
[1:52:23] faith, perfect love, agape love,
[1:52:26] everything you need. The faith for
[1:52:27] everything you need is in
[1:52:30] there. It's all in there. And all he's
[1:52:33] saying is, "Let me express it. Get out
[1:52:36] of the way so I can express myself and
[1:52:38] show that I'm a mighty healer. I'm a
[1:52:40] mighty deliverer. I'm a mighty savior. I
[1:52:43] am a comforter. I am everything you have
[1:52:45] need of. But the only thing that's
[1:52:47] keeping it is because your human love is
[1:52:49] still getting in my way. Die daily to
[1:52:52] that old nasty nature, that old nasty
[1:52:54] self. And when your human love can
[1:52:56] express itself and it doesn't interfere
[1:52:58] with the with with the presence of God
[1:53:00] in your life, that's wonderful. But as
[1:53:02] soon as it starts interfering with your
[1:53:04] relationship with Christ, recognize it
[1:53:06] for what it is and die to that old nasty
[1:53:08] thing. Amen. He just wants to express
[1:53:12] himself through you. That's his whole
[1:53:14] purpose of having you here. Express
[1:53:16] himself. And your biggest enemy is
[1:53:18] yourself. Is that all right? Amen. Lord
[1:53:21] Jesus, we're so grateful, Father, that
[1:53:23] you would come and show your purpose for
[1:53:24] us to to just put this out there so we
[1:53:27] can recognize how Satan works through
[1:53:28] us, trying to get us to to to interfere,
[1:53:31] trying to get us to do something that
[1:53:32] grieves away the Holy Spirit. But
[1:53:34] Father, you give us the word and you
[1:53:36] say, "I am setting you free. I'm setting
[1:53:38] you free from this so that you know that
[1:53:40] that that what it takes to die to
[1:53:42] yourself. You know what it takes to let
[1:53:44] my spirit live through you that you can
[1:53:46] be free to express all that I have to
[1:53:48] express. Lord Jesus, I pray that this
[1:53:50] word that would come out this morning
[1:53:52] that has the effect that you want it to
[1:53:53] have. Father, bring us back this
[1:53:55] afternoon because I believe you have
[1:53:56] something to just really pick us up and
[1:53:58] send us soaring. And so, Father, won't
[1:54:00] you come and do that for us? Bless us
[1:54:02] this this as we go to lunch here in a
[1:54:04] little bit, Lord. And just bless our
[1:54:06] fellowship. And father, let your spirit
[1:54:08] of unity just just prevail and just
[1:54:10] reign in all our lives. We ask this Lord
[1:54:12] in your name. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[1:54:15] brother and sister. You guys have been
[1:54:16] great this morning.
[1:54:29] I think every one of us hopefully will
[1:54:31] be able to understand a little bit
[1:54:32] better about that border right there.
[1:54:34] Isn't that right? of having natural
[1:54:37] affections is good. Ain't that right?
[1:54:39] But sometimes, amen, there's there's
[1:54:41] that barrier there between your natural
[1:54:43] affections and agape love. Amen. And we
[1:54:46] want all of us want that agape love to
[1:54:49] predom to be predominant. Amen. That's
[1:54:52] the one that dominates us even though we
[1:54:53] do need to be able to have feelings for
[1:54:55] each other. Amen. And so, and feelings
[1:54:58] in every aspect. Amen. And so I like
[1:55:01] what he said about, you know, as long as
[1:55:02] all of your emotions and feelings and
[1:55:04] things like that are checked by the Holy
[1:55:06] Ghost, it's okay. But if not, Amen. You
[1:55:08] got to watch out. Amen. That's where the
[1:55:10] devil comes in. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:13] Um, once like a bird in prison, I dwelt.
[1:55:17] Amen. Well, once like a bird in prison,
[1:55:23] I dwelt.
[1:55:25] No freom from my sorrow I
[1:55:31] felt. Then Jesus came and he listened to
[1:55:37] me and glory to God.
[1:55:41] [Music]
[1:55:47] Yes, he set me free and he broke the
[1:55:53] bond of prison for me. Well, I'm glory
[1:55:59] bound. My Jesus to see for glory to God.
[1:56:06] He set me free. And now I am
[1:56:13] climbing higher each day. Oh darkness of
[1:56:18] night has
[1:56:23] drifted. Our
[1:56:25] planet on higher ground. And glory to
[1:56:31] God I'm
[1:56:33] homeward bound where he set me free.
[1:56:38] Yes, he set me free and he broke the
[1:56:44] bond of prison for me. Well, I'm glory
[1:56:50] bound, my Jesus to see for glory to God.
[1:56:58] He set me free. Well, goodbye to sin and
[1:57:05] things that confound. Oh, not of this
[1:57:09] world shall turn me around. Well, daily
[1:57:15] I'm working. I'm praying to. And glory
[1:57:22] to God. Well, I'm
[1:57:24] going through. Well, he set me free.
[1:57:29] Yes, he set me free. And he broke the
[1:57:35] bond of prison for me. Well, I'm glory
[1:57:41] bound my Jesus to see for glory to God.
[1:57:48] He set me free. Amen. Are you happy to
[1:57:53] be free this morning?
[1:57:56] Amen.
[1:57:59] Amen. Amen. And I told Brother Phil, he
[1:58:02] could have just stayed on one foot
[1:58:03] instead of getting on both of them. He's
[1:58:06] supposed to be my friend. Amen. But
[1:58:10] God's good to us, isn't he? You know, I
[1:58:12] I told someone the other day, they asked
[1:58:14] me if I was mean when I was a kid. I
[1:58:16] said, "Yeah, my dad tore me up." But I
[1:58:19] said, "You know, I never felt that my
[1:58:22] dad didn't love
[1:58:23] me." That's why our heavenly father
[1:58:26] loves us this morning. Say, "Well, he
[1:58:28] tore us up." No, he just showed you. He
[1:58:31] just said, "Brother David, wait, I love
[1:58:33] you a whole bunch this morning." Amen.
[1:58:36] God bless you as you go. Well, glory to
[1:58:40] God. He set me free. Well, and he set me
[1:58:47] free. Yes, he set me free. Well, he
[1:58:52] broke the bond of prison for me. Well,
[1:58:58] I'm glory bound. My Jesus to see for
[1:59:04] glory to God. He set me free. Oh, and he
[1:59:11] set me free. Yes, he set me free. And he
[1:59:17] broke the bonds of prison for me when
[1:59:23] I'm glow. Reap my Jesus to see and glory
[1:59:31] to God. He set me free.
