[11:47] so
[18:42] foreign
[19:07] uh
[19:12] my brothers and sisters
[19:51] the
[20:46] um
[21:04] i don't want
[21:06] to ever
[21:25] jesus
[21:31] foreign
[21:55] no
[22:10] don't think about
[22:24] anything else he built anything else on
[22:27] that foundation
[22:30] so it's really important what we build
[22:32] our foundation on i was thinking this
[22:34] morning
[22:37] i was thinking i was
[22:44] one thing that struck me this morning
[22:48] if you're one telling me the romans
[22:50] created the chapter
[22:58] [Music]
[23:26] [Music]
[23:40] [Music]
[24:03] where the ability to record a person's
[24:05] voice
[24:06] where you can hear it later
[24:09] 100 years around 15 60 almost 80 years
[24:13] you know the quantum happens for
[24:15] non-terms
[24:30] and there's numerous other inventions
[24:33] but with any infection it can be used
[24:36] for good
[24:36] and it can be used for that but i was
[24:38] just thinking this morning
[24:40] where would we be if we didn't have the
[24:42] written word and he didn't have
[24:55] [Music]
[24:58] is
[24:59] [Music]
[25:08] what you see in video form can be
[25:10] propaganda but what you read in god's
[25:12] word
[26:07] [Applause]
[26:15] [Music]
[26:20] and he's going to take care of you and
[26:22] provide for
[26:51] are going to want to accept what god
[26:52] wants to do for you this morning it
[26:54] doesn't mean that you're any better than
[26:56] anyone else this means that god loves
[26:58] you and you will love your person to
[27:00] that call but let me uh
[27:03] read from this
[27:04] uh first and uh in the devotionals this
[27:07] morning
[27:08] in the old devotional
[27:10] there's chief options coming out of it
[27:12] from them today and for today but
[27:14] i mean out of reading i have no job
[27:17] world war two devotional army
[27:20] devotionals and world cartooning
[27:22] i think that
[27:24] lasted for the year before
[27:26] i i read a little bit out of that but i
[27:28] agree with the one this morning and it
[27:29] covers that in the description here
[27:32] i'll start started the 30th
[27:34] as the 29th first everyone knows 20 days
[27:38] before though he hit the destination
[27:40] he beat the mississippi
[27:42] alone
[27:43] starting at the 29th first
[27:59] god
[28:02] [Music]
[28:28] [Music]
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:50] how shall we not with him also freely
[28:53] give us all things but
[28:55] who shall lay anything in
[29:15] [Music]
[29:24] speaking to you is the individual these
[29:27] words right here
[29:28] and who shall lay in the charge of god's
[29:31] way is god's justified who is he that is
[29:35] christ that god gave his prison again
[29:39] who is even at the right hand of god who
[29:42] also makes his decision for
[29:44] who should separate us from the love of
[29:46] christ so appropriations distress
[29:49] perfection profession our nation for
[29:52] pearl assortment
[30:03] [Music]
[30:10] [Music]
[30:20] [Music]
[30:49] but like i said the most important thing
[30:51] is when you look at these words and you
[30:53] look at these persons you got to see
[30:55] yourself
[30:56] you're going to see yourself and what
[30:58] god is doing for you as an individual
[31:00] you know how are you doing for other
[31:02] people

[31:23] that other preachers lately have been

[31:27] but the one that was from yesterday
[31:44] when he
[31:58] the world is pretty dark out there the
[32:00] only life that's out there this morning
[32:02] with your heart it means you're like
[32:04] that's where the light is
[32:10] not even in
[32:12] books right
[32:26] to be based upon one decision that you
[32:29] make
[32:30] and that decision is just you're going
[32:32] to achieve
[32:33] jesus

[1:02:20] communion this morning
[1:02:22] amen philippians 3
[1:02:25] philippians 3.
[1:02:39] and we'll begin with
[1:02:50] verse
[1:02:51] 6
[1:02:53] concerning seal persecuting the church
[1:02:56] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:02:58] the law i was blameless
[1:03:00] but paul says what things were gained to
[1:03:03] me those i counted loss for christ
[1:03:08] yea doubtless i count all things but
[1:03:10] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[1:03:12] of christ jesus my lord
[1:03:15] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:03:17] things and count them and do count them
[1:03:20] but down that i may win christ
[1:03:23] and be found in him not having my own
[1:03:26] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:03:28] that which is through faith
[1:03:30] in christ
[1:03:32] the righteousness which is of god by
[1:03:34] faith
[1:03:36] that i may know him and the power of his
[1:03:38] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:03:41] sufferings being made conformable
[1:03:43] conformable unto his death
[1:03:45] if by any means i might attain unto the
[1:03:48] resurrection of the dead
[1:03:50] not as though i had already attained
[1:03:52] either were already perfect
[1:03:55] but i follow after
[1:03:57] if that i may apprehend that
[1:03:59] for which i also i am apprehended of
[1:04:03] christ jesus brethren i count not myself
[1:04:05] to have apprehended but there's one
[1:04:08] thing i do forgetting those things which
[1:04:10] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:04:13] things which are before
[1:04:15] i press towers to mark
[1:04:18] for the prize and notice how he spells
[1:04:20] that p-r-i-z-e
[1:04:23] all right of the high calling of god in
[1:04:26] christ jesus let us therefore as many as
[1:04:29] be perfect be thus minded and if
[1:04:32] and if in anything ye be otherwise
[1:04:35] minded god will shall reveal given this
[1:04:37] to us unto you this unto you may god had
[1:04:40] his blessings to the reading of the
[1:04:41] words you can be seated this morning
[1:04:44] amen this morning i want to speak on
[1:04:48] precision
[1:04:51] precision
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:53] something i don't believe i've ever
[1:04:54] spoke on before amen but
[1:04:56] uh and i was just meditating and you
[1:04:58] know it's funny i i always try to keep
[1:05:00] the lord on my mind and
[1:05:02] and somewhere along the lines sometimes
[1:05:05] the lord will just
[1:05:06] of course you know that's just usually i
[1:05:08] get my messages but he'll just quicken
[1:05:10] something to my mind
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:15] and i was meditating on on and thinking
[1:05:17] about
[1:05:18] uh
[1:05:19] the prophet of god brother abraham
[1:05:21] having went beyond the curtain of time
[1:05:23] that one morning y'all remember he was
[1:05:25] caught up
[1:05:27] and he's seen all of uh
[1:05:29] he's seen all these people right he's
[1:05:31] seen all these people
[1:05:32] dressed in robes and so forth and now
[1:05:35] all uh everybody was imperfection he was
[1:05:38] so beautiful and
[1:05:40] and he describes of course how everybody
[1:05:43] was
[1:05:44] you know and how beautiful it was
[1:05:47] and
[1:05:48] you know he began to wonder who these
[1:05:51] people were and so forth and he because
[1:05:53] the angel that was there with me says
[1:05:55] these are your people
[1:05:58] these are your people he says these are
[1:05:59] all branhams
[1:06:02] you're thinking perhaps his family
[1:06:04] and there was millions
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:07] there was millions of them and he says
[1:06:09] no these are not branhams these are your
[1:06:12] converts
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] now how many knows that in the prophetic
[1:06:18] age in the old testament different ones
[1:06:20] it always talks about that group that
[1:06:23] like joseph and them being gathered with
[1:06:25] his people and he was gathered with his
[1:06:28] free people amen and so we know that he
[1:06:31] had a vision and so forth and he says
[1:06:33] you know that
[1:06:34] before he was told that before
[1:06:37] he would meet the lord he'd have to be
[1:06:38] judged so forth for what he has preached
[1:06:40] and so forth and he says well will paul
[1:06:43] have to
[1:06:45] have to do the same thing well paul be
[1:06:47] judged with his group but before he said
[1:06:49] that if you'll notice what i want to say
[1:06:51] was he says no these are not brandons
[1:06:53] but they're your converts right so they
[1:06:56] were actually converts of brother
[1:06:57] branham's and they were gathered with
[1:06:59] him and he said it says well we'll you
[1:07:01] know he says you'll be judged for what
[1:07:02] you have preached he says well will paul
[1:07:04] have to be judged for what he preached
[1:07:07] he says he sure will
[1:07:08] you know and he says
[1:07:10] and
[1:07:11] startling startling to me when i first
[1:07:13] heard it
[1:07:15] brother branham said well praise be to
[1:07:16] god
[1:07:18] brother branham was happy
[1:07:20] because he says well if paul's going to
[1:07:22] have to he says and if paul's group make
[1:07:24] it i will too because i preached just
[1:07:28] what paul preached
[1:07:32] amen and what did those millions cry out
[1:07:36] he says we are resting on that
[1:07:40] now and and
[1:07:41] if you'll notice that paul here
[1:07:44] in philippians i believe it was
[1:07:48] no not philippians galatians i believe
[1:07:50] it is hold on a second let me go back
[1:07:52] here
[1:07:53] just a few pages back this is what paul
[1:07:56] taught he said this paul said in
[1:07:58] galatians 1 he says
[1:08:00] he says i marvel that ye are so soon
[1:08:02] removed from him that called you into
[1:08:04] the grace of christ
[1:08:06] unto another gospel which is not another
[1:08:09] but there be some that trouble you
[1:08:11] and would pervert the gospel of christ
[1:08:13] but though we
[1:08:15] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:08:17] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:08:20] preached unto you
[1:08:22] let him be a curse
[1:08:25] as we said before he says it again
[1:08:28] so
[1:08:29] say i now again
[1:08:31] if any man preach any of the gospel unto
[1:08:34] you then that which ye have received let
[1:08:37] him be accursed
[1:08:39] first he said an angel but though we are
[1:08:41] an angel next he says though if any man
[1:08:44] preach a gospel which you have not
[1:08:47] received let him be accursed for i do or
[1:08:50] do i now persuade men or god or do i
[1:08:52] seek to please men for if i yet please
[1:08:54] men i should not be the servant of god i
[1:08:56] certify to you brethren that the gospel
[1:08:59] was preached of me
[1:09:01] is that that was preached of me was not
[1:09:03] after man
[1:09:05] neither received i i ate of men neither
[1:09:08] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[1:09:11] jesus christ
[1:09:12] how many know that the word of the lord
[1:09:15] always comes to a prophet
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] and that's why different places in
[1:09:22] different times in brother branham's
[1:09:23] ministry amen different when we say well
[1:09:25] brother branham you are a prophet of god
[1:09:27] don't you aren't you in the place to
[1:09:30] where you could add to the bible
[1:09:33] he says well that may be true i may be
[1:09:35] in that position but the word has
[1:09:38] already been established and if anybody
[1:09:40] anything other than let it be a curse so
[1:09:43] you could never preach something other
[1:09:45] than what has been preached
[1:09:46] according to the word or you'd have a
[1:09:48] contradiction
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:52] so having established that and talking
[1:09:54] about how that we know that he was he
[1:09:57] was seeing millions of people that's
[1:09:59] what
[1:10:01] this morning i'm not ashamed to say that
[1:10:03] i'm a convert of the problem of god
[1:10:05] brother branham
[1:10:07] because paul said follow me as i follow
[1:10:09] christ paul will be gathered with his
[1:10:11] group
[1:10:12] arenas will be gathered with his group
[1:10:14] martin will be gathered with his group
[1:10:16] every age has a group that they're
[1:10:17] gathered with
[1:10:19] how many knows that
[1:10:21] amen the seven stars that god had in his
[1:10:23] right hand
[1:10:25] and remember jesus said that as they do
[1:10:27] to you they do unto me right so amen now
[1:10:31] notice but i want to i want to go to a
[1:10:33] thought that i had okay and the thought
[1:10:35] was this
[1:10:37] and i just want to read this to you okay
[1:10:39] would that be all right brother bam says
[1:10:40] the other day at the christian
[1:10:43] in los
[1:10:45] angeles i was preaching at their
[1:10:47] breakfast
[1:10:48] which went on in national or nationwide
[1:10:51] broadcast and i was just tearing the
[1:10:53] thing just up as hard as i could
[1:10:56] i couldn't do nothing else because i may
[1:10:59] know that abandoned would preach against
[1:11:01] everything that was wrong
[1:11:03] let me tell you something denominations
[1:11:05] don't stand much of a chance
[1:11:08] a church that's not based on the word of
[1:11:10] god don't stand much of a chance the
[1:11:12] bible in the o in revelation calls her
[1:11:15] harlots prostitutes
[1:11:18] she's the mother of harlots and
[1:11:20] abominations of the earth
[1:11:23] amen
[1:11:24] and he was just tearing the nomination
[1:11:26] and so forth up he says because how many
[1:11:28] knows that during brother bannon's time
[1:11:30] when he was preaching and so forth you
[1:11:32] wouldn't believe the adversity that he
[1:11:34] had
[1:11:35] isn't that right
[1:11:36] we could go on to turn 63 65 when most
[1:11:40] churches put him out
[1:11:42] even though jesus would still come down
[1:11:44] to the platform and do the very same
[1:11:47] things that he did with the woman and
[1:11:48] i'll discern the thoughts and intents of
[1:11:50] the heart and come and prove
[1:11:52] that it was jesus christ resurrected
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:55] and i'm not ashamed of the testimonies
[1:11:57] of what god has done in this generation
[1:11:59] because listen to all the times that uh
[1:12:02] the old testament and
[1:12:04] david all says he said that we ought to
[1:12:06] repeat the testimonies of god
[1:12:08] think about the testimonies before god
[1:12:10] teach your children the testimonies of
[1:12:12] god tell your children's children what
[1:12:14] god has did and we're not just here to
[1:12:16] say what he did like that but we're here
[1:12:18] to say what god did today
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:24] all right so there he was and he was
[1:12:25] just doing all that
[1:12:27] and of course at the time that wasn't
[1:12:29] too popular
[1:12:31] right
[1:12:32] but he said that
[1:12:33] he said there was a danny henry there
[1:12:36] was a danny henry that came up you know
[1:12:39] after he was done preaching this is jane
[1:12:42] russell i guess she's some movie star or
[1:12:43] something jane russell uh his first
[1:12:45] cousin that's right he says her cousin a
[1:12:48] baptist note not one word of it but was
[1:12:52] a so stern and he walked up and he says
[1:12:54] brother madam them words that you said
[1:12:58] could be easily put be put to the book
[1:13:00] of revelations
[1:13:02] now another place brother bam says he
[1:13:04] insulted him
[1:13:06] by saying that that's an addition to the
[1:13:08] word of god
[1:13:10] huh
[1:13:11] because you can't add to or take away
[1:13:13] because if you do
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:16] you'd be out of the program of god
[1:13:19] he says that could be added to the bible
[1:13:21] right there
[1:13:22] listen
[1:13:24] and he threw his arms around me and
[1:13:26] started speaking in french and he didn't
[1:13:28] know one word of french he didn't know
[1:13:30] how to speak in french
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:36] listen
[1:13:36] up here he re
[1:13:38] phrases it against up here and when he
[1:13:40] did he began he began to speak in with
[1:13:42] tongues
[1:13:43] he says and then there was a lady from
[1:13:45] louisiana sitting there out there a
[1:13:47] french woman raised up and she says that
[1:13:49] isn't unknown tongues i'm a frenchman
[1:13:53] here is what he said
[1:13:55] notice she wrote it on a paper
[1:13:57] right
[1:13:58] because she heard exactly
[1:14:00] what he said and another man came up
[1:14:03] from down through there and woke up a
[1:14:05] young fellow walking down through there
[1:14:07] was the interpreter of french for the
[1:14:10] u.n the united nations he had just
[1:14:12] drifted into the meeting and he said
[1:14:15] what's uh here's what she said he said
[1:14:17] exactly the same thing
[1:14:20] and this boy danny henry he didn't know
[1:14:22] any any french amen but yet he spoke
[1:14:26] in tongues
[1:14:28] and there was three witnesses let every
[1:14:30] word be established
[1:14:32] and they wrote this down
[1:14:34] all right
[1:14:35] he says this is what this is what he had
[1:14:38] prophesied or said he says because thou
[1:14:41] has chosen
[1:14:42] the narrow path
[1:14:45] the harder way
[1:14:46] that is what of thine own choosing
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] that's what i want to talk a little bit
[1:14:54] about notice how did he did this of his
[1:14:56] own choosing brother bannon was offered
[1:14:58] airplanes and uh preachers would come up
[1:15:00] to him uh you know the leaders of the
[1:15:03] big denominational groups they come up
[1:15:05] and say look better venom you know we
[1:15:07] want to be part of this and we want to
[1:15:09] sponsor you and
[1:15:11] and we'll have an airplane and we'll fly
[1:15:13] you everywhere and so forth and and pay
[1:15:16] you a salary and all
[1:15:18] these things and and so forth
[1:15:21] right very good friend of his
[1:15:24] he would be made offers he says yeah
[1:15:27] well what is the catch
[1:15:29] well you know just this about uh
[1:15:32] you know you about this water baptism
[1:15:34] the godhead maybe the serpent seed you
[1:15:37] know and always bawling the women out
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:41] he said well that's what god's called me
[1:15:43] to do yet you know but it was always a
[1:15:45] catch and he turned that down flat isn't
[1:15:48] that right
[1:15:49] and he chose the harder way he didn't
[1:15:51] choose the easy way
[1:15:53] he chose the hard way because the hard
[1:15:56] way we know that christ
[1:15:58] is always in every age to be a christian
[1:16:01] you'll be persecuted
[1:16:03] amen they'll cast you out and their name
[1:16:05] out as evil and everything else
[1:16:08] it's the hard way and it because he
[1:16:10] chose notice he says thou has chosen the
[1:16:14] narrow path the harder way
[1:16:16] now notice he says this is where i
[1:16:17] picked it up thou has picked
[1:16:20] the correct
[1:16:21] and precise decision
[1:16:29] oh my
[1:16:30] the precise and the correct and precise
[1:16:34] decision and this is my way
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:39] because in because of this momentous
[1:16:42] decision a huge portion of heaven awaits
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:49] hey man how many remembers the old lady
[1:16:52] uh the young lady that came up and shook
[1:16:54] his hand and so forth and she was young
[1:16:56] and absolutely beautiful long hair
[1:16:59] everything it's the angels
[1:17:02] who said don't you remember her she said
[1:17:04] our precious brother our precious
[1:17:06] brother amen
[1:17:07] and and he says dude i don't remember
[1:17:09] her no and he said you she was past 80
[1:17:13] years old
[1:17:14] i don't think it was 90 i think this is
[1:17:16] what past 80 years old when you led her
[1:17:18] to christ
[1:17:20] and there was millions there
[1:17:24] you know why there was millions there
[1:17:26] because you didn't compromise on the
[1:17:28] word of god
[1:17:30] aren't you glad that for that it didn't
[1:17:32] compromise
[1:17:34] he didn't take it easy on the people he
[1:17:36] tore the people's eyes up he told the
[1:17:39] truth
[1:17:43] oh my
[1:17:45] but that position that word position is
[1:17:47] what caught my attention in my mind that
[1:17:50] i said i was pretty sure he said the
[1:17:51] precise and correct decision how many
[1:17:54] knows any correct decision is precise
[1:18:01] i like that
[1:18:03] oh my gosh the thinking i want to take
[1:18:05] some words with the help of the lord as
[1:18:06] we might think about what position means
[1:18:09] to be prison position means to be
[1:18:12] precise
[1:18:14] or accurate
[1:18:16] or perfect
[1:18:20] dead on
[1:18:22] right
[1:18:22] it's a precise decision and he made the
[1:18:25] right choice
[1:18:29] oh my
[1:18:30] and i like what he said one place he
[1:18:31] says now this was your choosing you
[1:18:34] chose it
[1:18:36] you chose the right choice oh how many
[1:18:38] knows that whether you go to heaven or
[1:18:40] whether you end up in hell at the end of
[1:18:43] this life depends on what choice that
[1:18:45] you make
[1:18:47] but brandon brother brian mentioned
[1:18:49] about making that choice for christ it's
[1:18:51] the most important choice that you'll
[1:18:53] ever make in life
[1:18:54] it was the most important
[1:18:56] choice i made amen when i was like 20
[1:18:58] years old so if i learned right there
[1:19:01] brothers and sisters i'm so glad for the
[1:19:02] grace of god
[1:19:04] that was something down in my heart said
[1:19:06] there's got to be more to rock and roll
[1:19:09] and smoking dope and heaven drugs and
[1:19:11] everything else there's got to be
[1:19:12] something up to life
[1:19:16] i said lord here i am whatever you want
[1:19:18] to do with my life i made a choice
[1:19:21] twice with the god's help in that right
[1:19:23] it was him that planted something that
[1:19:25] and because of that my whole entire life
[1:19:27] has been different
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:32] oh my
[1:19:33] you gotta make that right choice
[1:19:36] your whole world
[1:19:38] every individual you are going to create
[1:19:41] your world
[1:19:42] by the choice that you
[1:19:47] and you know when god came and did what
[1:19:48] he did the signs and the wonders that he
[1:19:50] performed
[1:19:52] remember when he came and he preferred
[1:19:53] those signs and wonders of god says now
[1:19:55] you know what
[1:19:56] now the choice is forced upon people you
[1:19:59] have to make a choice
[1:20:02] you got to make this decision
[1:20:05] is it of god or isn't of god
[1:20:08] huh
[1:20:09] you got to
[1:20:10] can't walk away from it praise be to god
[1:20:14] oh my
[1:20:17] now notice what he said he says a huge
[1:20:19] portion and i really didn't know for
[1:20:21] sure in the past perhaps what that meant
[1:20:23] but he always almost in every search of
[1:20:26] these quotes he mentions he says and
[1:20:28] that's in the vision here that you all
[1:20:30] have heard about that i had just a
[1:20:32] little while ago isn't that right the
[1:20:34] vision of what you had of that other
[1:20:36] side it was a huge portion of the people
[1:20:40] that are gonna be in heaven they await
[1:20:42] you
[1:20:45] aren't you glad for that
[1:20:46] oh my
[1:20:48] let me uh
[1:20:50] and let me just say this as it comes to
[1:20:52] mind there's something about precision
[1:20:56] i love precision
[1:21:04] precision is the opposite of
[1:21:07] sloppy
[1:21:12] being sloppy
[1:21:14] i just want to make a statement if you
[1:21:16] could get this in your head young people
[1:21:18] you'd get somewhere in life
[1:21:20] if you are sloppy about your decisions
[1:21:22] you are sloppy about the choices that
[1:21:24] you make
[1:21:25] you will not go very far in this life
[1:21:29] you could easily end up in jail prison
[1:21:31] or a drug addict or whatnot
[1:21:34] huh
[1:21:35] young ladies you could end up having
[1:21:37] babies and children and not having a
[1:21:39] husband that cares whether it's taken
[1:21:40] care of not your life could be a
[1:21:42] nightmare because of chis decisions you
[1:21:44] need to be precise about what choices
[1:21:46] you make
[1:21:50] amen
[1:21:51] hasn't it always irritated you a little
[1:21:53] bit with rich people people who have
[1:21:55] gotten somewhere in life and then the
[1:21:57] little things they're completely
[1:22:00] fanatical about
[1:22:04] you say why do they have to be so picky
[1:22:06] about the little things that's where
[1:22:07] they got where they are because
[1:22:10] they know that if they're slopping those
[1:22:12] little things they'll be slapping the
[1:22:13] big things every little little thing
[1:22:15] matters if you're going to get anywhere
[1:22:22] why are they so tight
[1:22:25] the reason they're so tight is why they
[1:22:27] have so much money
[1:22:29] they're not sloppy you just spend it and
[1:22:31] it goes out their pocket as fast as it
[1:22:33] comes in
[1:22:36] got your attention now
[1:22:38] but think about it i thought that he
[1:22:40] cries spiritually
[1:22:43] i believe that god wants us to be
[1:22:45] precise he wants to be he wants us to be
[1:22:48] correct he wants us to hit the mall
[1:22:54] somebody tells me what sin means
[1:23:00] raise your hand so i don't have a bunch
[1:23:02] answering but a glenn
[1:23:06] disobedient disobedience that's one
[1:23:09] anybody else
[1:23:11] sister hannah
[1:23:13] unbelief that's another one how about
[1:23:15] another one
[1:23:17] that's what i'm looking for
[1:23:23] all right
[1:23:27] brother ben key to the door says sin
[1:23:31] means
[1:23:32] sin means
[1:23:34] to miss
[1:23:35] the mark
[1:23:37] like you're shooting you miss
[1:23:40] the mark
[1:23:42] you better adjust your gun or your
[1:23:43] sights
[1:23:45] oh my
[1:23:47] hallelujah
[1:23:49] didn't jesus say that if you will
[1:23:51] believe
[1:23:53] all things are possible
[1:23:56] if you say that this mountain move
[1:23:59] and believe with all your it'll be moved
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] what for him think whatsoever desire
[1:24:06] when you pray believe and you shall have
[1:24:09] have them
[1:24:11] remember the one man who was one of his
[1:24:13] daughter i believe healed this who first
[1:24:14] believe is thou that i can do it he says
[1:24:17] lord help my unbelief
[1:24:20] amen he says you know if a man believes
[1:24:22] he says nothing is impossible
[1:24:26] to a man that believes
[1:24:30] yes
[1:24:31] sin is unbelief
[1:24:34] and it means to miss the mark
[1:24:39] let me just come to the very foundation
[1:24:42] of the gospel
[1:24:57] go ye
[1:24:58] jesus said when he was
[1:25:00] risen from the dead and talked to his
[1:25:02] disciples going into all the world and
[1:25:04] preached the gospel he that believeth
[1:25:06] and is baptized shall be saved
[1:25:09] he that believeth not
[1:25:11] shall be damned
[1:25:15] pretty straight shot ain't it
[1:25:18] just a straight shot he that believeth
[1:25:20] and his baptized shall be saved
[1:25:24] in other words you're going to get to
[1:25:26] live eternally
[1:25:31] but if that believeth not
[1:25:34] shall be
[1:25:36] damned
[1:25:39] now you see why the world is so damned
[1:25:42] because they don't believe what god did
[1:25:43] that's right
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:47] so that's the very foundation you have
[1:25:48] to believe
[1:25:51] it's semester mark
[1:25:55] listen because there's something wrong
[1:25:57] like shooting in a gun you miss the mark
[1:25:59] see you come back and try over it means
[1:26:01] to turn around you've missed the mark
[1:26:03] when you're a christian you want to join
[1:26:05] a church you miss the mark you want to
[1:26:07] be a christian and be sprinkled in the
[1:26:09] name of the father son holy you missed
[1:26:11] the mark you better come back
[1:26:16] amen i'll tell you right now
[1:26:19] anytime you're practicing any time of
[1:26:21] shooting
[1:26:22] me and
[1:26:24] brother tommy had his
[1:26:27] bow and arrow shoot you know and
[1:26:30] i love it caleb remembers back in the
[1:26:33] day
[1:26:34] when we was man you know if it was if
[1:26:37] it's a uh if it get out of that bull's
[1:26:39] eye we were unhappy
[1:26:41] i mean you just got the rhythm of you
[1:26:43] could put still it in there drill it in
[1:26:45] there drill it in there
[1:26:46] but years have went by
[1:26:49] and i tried to you know do a pretty good
[1:26:51] job and so forth trying to you know come
[1:26:53] up in maybe third or fourth place and
[1:26:55] hey you know i better go practice i
[1:26:57] remember john michael you know wanted to
[1:26:59] go to them shoots and so forth and
[1:27:01] i would get a day or two and just go out
[1:27:03] there and get that rhythm again but it's
[1:27:05] hard to do in just a time or two
[1:27:07] and they're right you got to get you got
[1:27:09] to keep practicing keep working on it
[1:27:13] isn't that what paul said i'm pressing i
[1:27:15] haven't got it yet but i'm working on it
[1:27:17] and i'm working on it
[1:27:19] to come to that resurrection to come to
[1:27:21] that place of perfection
[1:27:23] paul said i have
[1:27:25] account everything i ever had but done
[1:27:29] that i might know him that i might zero
[1:27:31] in on him
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] because that's the only way you can
[1:27:36] serve god
[1:27:38] it's all
[1:27:40] or nothing
[1:27:42] how many believe
[1:27:44] that oh my
[1:27:54] amen how many loves the lord
[1:27:58] jesus said it this way when he says
[1:27:59] about you
[1:28:01] wanting to
[1:28:02] be precise
[1:28:06] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[1:28:08] before men him will i confess before my
[1:28:10] father which is in heaven how many know
[1:28:12] another place he said draw nigh unto god
[1:28:14] and god will draw an eye unto you
[1:28:18] in other words if you want to aim to get
[1:28:19] closer to god you better start drawing
[1:28:21] closer to him if you want him to come
[1:28:23] closer to you you better start drawing
[1:28:25] closer to him but whosoever will deny me
[1:28:29] before men
[1:28:31] one other place he says him will i deny
[1:28:33] before all the holy angels in heaven
[1:28:36] i don't know you
[1:28:38] if in this world you're ashamed to
[1:28:40] confess jesus christ there come a day
[1:28:42] when he'll be ashamed of you
[1:28:48] think not that i am
[1:28:49] condescend peace on the earth i didn't
[1:28:51] come to send peace by the sower
[1:28:56] oh my because why he says for i am i'm
[1:28:59] come to set a man at variance against
[1:29:01] his father and daughter and against her
[1:29:03] mother and daughter-in-law against her
[1:29:05] mother-in-law a man's foes shall be they
[1:29:08] of his own household
[1:29:11] he that loveth father and mother more
[1:29:12] than me is not worthy of me he that
[1:29:14] loveth son or daughter more than me is
[1:29:16] not worthy of me he that taketh not up
[1:29:19] his cross and follows me is not worthy
[1:29:21] of me he that findeth his life shall
[1:29:23] lose it and he that loses his life for
[1:29:25] my sake shall find it
[1:29:28] what is he saying that you can't have
[1:29:30] your focus on any family member you've
[1:29:33] got to have your focus 100 on christ
[1:29:39] he ain't got to fill you with the holy
[1:29:40] ghost he ain't going to change your life
[1:29:44] unless you completely surrender to him
[1:29:49] amen
[1:29:50] amen how many likes that that was the
[1:29:54] way that jesus said you better focus on
[1:29:56] it amen
[1:29:58] all right
[1:30:00] we want to talk about focusing for just
[1:30:01] a few minutes but
[1:30:05] there's another story brother bran said
[1:30:07] that i really liked
[1:30:08] as you know brother bannon was a hunter
[1:30:10] he loved the outdoors
[1:30:11] amen
[1:30:14] and he was a squirrel hunter
[1:30:18] and he went out one day and he started
[1:30:20] to shoot a squirrel
[1:30:21] and i find out now brother bannon wanted
[1:30:24] to hit
[1:30:24] he would wait for a squirrel to go to a
[1:30:26] certain place
[1:30:28] at a certain distance
[1:30:30] before he would shoot that squirrel
[1:30:33] whenever he would shoot that squirrel he
[1:30:35] didn't want to hit him in the hips he
[1:30:36] didn't want to gut shoot that he didn't
[1:30:38] want to hit him in the chest he wanted
[1:30:39] to hit him right in the head right in
[1:30:41] the eye
[1:30:42] that's why he wanted to hit him he was
[1:30:43] just that way
[1:30:47] and i hit him somewhere else besides the
[1:30:50] eye and i got nervous i tried again on
[1:30:52] the paper in other words he began to
[1:30:53] shoot on paper and it wouldn't hit the
[1:30:55] squirrel i wouldn't hit the target
[1:30:57] it would hit somewhere within a quarter
[1:30:59] of an inch or so
[1:31:01] an inch something at 50 yards
[1:31:03] now no it would do better than it i done
[1:31:05] everything to the gun that i know to do
[1:31:07] seemed like to fix it and i wrapped it
[1:31:09] up in the box and sent it back to the
[1:31:10] winchester company for examination for
[1:31:13] re-betting it wrote me a nice letter
[1:31:16] and i have my rifle file at home he says
[1:31:18] and it says reverend branham that rifle
[1:31:20] was grouped it was made to group an inch
[1:31:23] at every 25 yards
[1:31:26] it's just a model 75 it's not a target
[1:31:30] good gun it's just a plinker
[1:31:32] you'll never get any better than that
[1:31:34] now that was the winchester company made
[1:31:36] the gun said an inch at 25 yards
[1:31:39] i drove nine straight
[1:31:42] holes at 50 yards
[1:31:46] now here's my thought my wife said not
[1:31:48] bill she said
[1:31:49] if that company who made the rifle will
[1:31:51] tell you that
[1:31:53] then it uh why won't you it won't do no
[1:31:55] better than that then who are you say
[1:31:57] that it will
[1:32:01] i say honey
[1:32:03] little husband and wife here honey
[1:32:05] here's what it is i don't care what the
[1:32:07] company said
[1:32:10] i've seen it do it
[1:32:16] how many knows i'll tell you you ever
[1:32:18] get a good taste of the baptism the holy
[1:32:20] ghost don't you tell me there ain't no
[1:32:22] really sweet loving and wonderful
[1:32:24] feeling that comes with the baptism of
[1:32:26] the holy ghost
[1:32:27] i've seen it do it
[1:32:29] man
[1:32:32] that's the important part
[1:32:34] is that experience works hope
[1:32:38] experience brings hope and he knew that
[1:32:40] he would do it
[1:32:41] he would drove 10 attacks straight one
[1:32:43] hole after another 10 times he knew he
[1:32:45] would do it and then let him tore up
[1:32:50] huh
[1:32:52] in other words he loved precision
[1:32:55] he wanted it dead on
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:02] how many is that way spiritual lord i
[1:33:03] want it
[1:33:04] right on
[1:33:07] i don't want it almost
[1:33:09] i don't want to take a shotgun
[1:33:12] only take time i take a shotgun to a
[1:33:14] test to set gun shotgun i'm going to
[1:33:16] ever try to shotgun see if it shoots
[1:33:18] straight michael
[1:33:21] he's a turkey hunter so he knows that
[1:33:23] you want that shotgun even to shoot a
[1:33:26] turkey you want those the the compound
[1:33:29] of those many bullets to be a certain
[1:33:31] place and you want to know where that's
[1:33:32] going but that's the only time you want
[1:33:34] to use a unless unless you want to go
[1:33:36] squirrel hunting with a shotgun you can
[1:33:37] do that too
[1:33:39] but listen when it comes to a rifle
[1:33:42] you want it dead on
[1:33:45] caleb back there he he know he knows
[1:33:47] we've spent time together and you know
[1:33:50] it's just not good enough unless it's
[1:33:52] right there in the bullseye
[1:33:55] especially a certain distance because we
[1:33:57] know that when it gets way out there
[1:33:59] it'll miss the whole target
[1:34:03] huh if you're a deer hunter and you go
[1:34:05] out there and you see a big old monster
[1:34:07] book
[1:34:09] well i tell you what there's one thing
[1:34:10] i've always wanted to do that if i see
[1:34:12] that book i want to let you see him i
[1:34:14] want to bring him home
[1:34:16] and i don't want to hear no
[1:34:19] excuses well i missed him
[1:34:22] not when you got a weapon like a rifle
[1:34:24] in your hand that reaches way out there
[1:34:26] because i'll tell you what if you shoot
[1:34:28] and you miss that deer you absolutely
[1:34:30] sinned you have missed the mark
[1:34:33] it didn't do you no good to hunt him all
[1:34:35] that time and all that effort that you
[1:34:37] put into it and all the court you put
[1:34:39] out it didn't do you a billy good
[1:34:40] because you failed when it come right
[1:34:42] down to the time
[1:34:44] because she wasn't precise
[1:34:47] and everything else has to be in order
[1:34:49] isn't that right you can't flinch
[1:34:51] i mean those flinching you can't jerk
[1:34:54] you got to watch for twigs and branches
[1:34:56] use all kinds of obstacles you got to
[1:34:58] watch for and so always in our christian
[1:35:00] life you got to watch for those
[1:35:01] obstacles in your life that want to trip
[1:35:03] you up
[1:35:05] in your christian walk with god
[1:35:08] you got to be precise about it
[1:35:11] oh my how we could think of daniel
[1:35:15] daniel and lion said how many knows that
[1:35:16] he was precise
[1:35:18] they said you can't pray and they said
[1:35:20] they can't pray right well he kept right
[1:35:22] on praying how many times a day
[1:35:24] hey
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:25] three times a day he was precise about
[1:35:28] his prayer life
[1:35:31] and when it comes down to him being
[1:35:33] thrown in the lions then
[1:35:35] god didn't spare him he let him throw
[1:35:38] him in the lungs then
[1:35:42] we expect to be saved long before then
[1:35:45] but god don't always save you before the
[1:35:47] lines he lets you fall into the lion's
[1:35:49] den
[1:35:53] but guess what how many knows god was
[1:35:56] precise on time
[1:35:59] because those lions didn't want to even
[1:36:01] come close to daniel
[1:36:03] they don't like fire
[1:36:05] there was a pillar of fire with daniel
[1:36:08] and it kept them away from daniel
[1:36:11] huh
[1:36:13] daniel made the right choice
[1:36:16] i don't care what the world says i'm
[1:36:18] going to pray anyway
[1:36:20] christianity nowadays is at an all-time
[1:36:24] low so to speak
[1:36:25] it's looked down upon
[1:36:28] amen
[1:36:30] they call them conservatives huh
[1:36:33] look down upon
[1:36:38] i don't care how much it's looked down
[1:36:39] upon
[1:36:42] still the only way
[1:36:45] still the greatest way
[1:36:47] it's the thing that will triumph over
[1:36:49] everything else
[1:36:53] and no matter how much they did that
[1:36:54] daniel didn't care what the
[1:36:56] local government
[1:36:58] did they were he was gonna pray to his
[1:37:00] god
[1:37:01] same way with the three hebrew children
[1:37:04] what were the three hebrew children's
[1:37:06] name
[1:37:08] somebody say it out loud
[1:37:12] i'm wondering why there ain't no more
[1:37:13] shad racks around brother john where's
[1:37:16] our b shots where's our vietnamese
[1:37:19] amen
[1:37:22] a bit shadrach good names right
[1:37:27] not kane
[1:37:30] not dathan
[1:37:32] even saul not really
[1:37:35] huh
[1:37:36] saul in the old testament he was not
[1:37:38] much count saul in the new testament
[1:37:40] needed a new name before he was worth
[1:37:42] the time
[1:37:45] to be called paul
[1:37:48] that's why we have so many pulse johns
[1:37:50] peters
[1:37:52] huh
[1:37:53] anyway
[1:37:55] let's get back on on thought here
[1:37:59] oh my
[1:38:01] now notice
[1:38:04] he said you know i've seen it do it
[1:38:07] and i sat down there when the other
[1:38:10] brethren they were shooting at squirrels
[1:38:13] they anywhere they wanted to hit him it
[1:38:14] was all right mid center back anywhere
[1:38:17] and i was under the tree crying
[1:38:20] why can't i get my gun right
[1:38:23] can you imagine a man so nervous over a
[1:38:25] gun
[1:38:26] it bothered brother adam
[1:38:28] he was crying about i just can't get it
[1:38:30] right
[1:38:32] the other brethren that's the way listen
[1:38:35] with denominations churches out there
[1:38:37] well if you're a little bit of a lesbian
[1:38:39] or a homosexual or this side or the
[1:38:41] other you know god loves us all
[1:38:45] or maybe uh my god don't care about how
[1:38:47] the sister's dress or if he cuts his
[1:38:49] hair or not when paul said it's a shame
[1:38:51] for her to do it
[1:38:53] wear pants it's an abomination in the
[1:38:55] sight of god
[1:38:57] for a woman to wear the garment pertains
[1:38:59] to a man it was never accepted years ago
[1:39:04] think about it just shoot here splatter
[1:39:06] there
[1:39:07] you don't have to doesn't matter how you
[1:39:09] baptize it doesn't matter if you believe
[1:39:11] in one god yeah it does
[1:39:14] how many believes are god's group god's
[1:39:16] children they want to be precise upon i
[1:39:19] want the right way
[1:39:21] i want god's way that's the only way is
[1:39:24] god's way
[1:39:26] every other way is wrong my thinking's
[1:39:28] wrong you're thinking i have to forget
[1:39:30] all my thinking let the bible do my
[1:39:31] thinking for me
[1:39:33] let this might be in you which was also
[1:39:35] in christ jesus
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:38] give me a whole new mind
[1:39:41] and you talk about brave you talk about
[1:39:44] a christian and then when you get the
[1:39:46] baptism of the holy ghost before they
[1:39:49] got the holy ghost on the day of
[1:39:50] pentecost remember peter in them they
[1:39:52] were scared in the upper room they were
[1:39:54] afraid that more soldiers were gonna
[1:39:55] come and drag them away and crucify them
[1:39:58] but they were in that upper room but
[1:39:59] after they got the holy ghost
[1:40:02] oh my they wouldn't come out from that
[1:40:04] upper room and they went out into the
[1:40:05] coke home place and and begin to preach
[1:40:08] to the whole group
[1:40:11] they were not afraid to get into the
[1:40:13] middle of a crowd and say hey y'all
[1:40:18] god give us more courage like hey y'all
[1:40:24] i'd give a thousand dollars so one
[1:40:26] senator would get up there and just
[1:40:27] blast him the way that it is when he's
[1:40:29] got his voice in congress
[1:40:31] just tell them how it is
[1:40:34] tell him the reason that the world's
[1:40:36] falling apart and there you can't find
[1:40:38] god no worries because you put him out
[1:40:41] how's it going how is that working out
[1:40:43] for you
[1:40:45] not so good right
[1:40:48] this country was based upon christianity
[1:40:51] upon belief in god and you have put him
[1:40:53] out
[1:40:55] now you'll get the fruit of your own way
[1:40:58] yeah that's right you better be scared
[1:41:00] of those bombs that russia's got waiting
[1:41:02] for you because these gave god the one
[1:41:03] waiting on us
[1:41:06] brother brown to say last thing he seen

[1:41:24] have to be more precise about your life
[1:41:26] you're gonna have to be more precise
[1:41:28] about your prayer life
[1:41:32] i believe it's the holy spirit calling
[1:41:34] us amen jesus said man shall not live by
[1:41:36] by the law but by every word that
[1:41:39] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:41:41] shall man live by
[1:41:43] you'll never be victorious unless you
[1:41:45] get rid of all unbelief
[1:41:47] separate yourself from all of your
[1:41:49] unbelief
[1:41:50] all of your own ways
[1:41:53] we got too much of our own ways too much
[1:41:56] of our own thinking left yet
[1:41:58] we got to be precise about how we live
[1:42:00] well i don't know if i'll go to church
[1:42:02] tonight you sloppy
[1:42:05] you are so sloppy
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:09] i don't know if i'll read my bible i
[1:42:11] don't know if i'll pray you sloppy
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:17] i don't know about you but i'm not
[1:42:18] satisfied until i get the baptism of the
[1:42:21] holy ghost and he's leading me and
[1:42:23] guiding me and directing me
[1:42:26] i'm not happy in this church until we
[1:42:27] have the same kind of services that they
[1:42:29] used to have if you used to hit zero it
[1:42:32] can hit zero again
[1:42:39] think about it
[1:42:40] god's bull's-eye
[1:42:43] is hebrews 13 8
[1:42:46] he don't never change he's the same
[1:42:48] yesterday today and forever he don't die
[1:42:51] he don't get old he don't forget
[1:42:54] he's alive today as he was when david
[1:42:56] drew goliath
[1:42:58] he's alive today as he went and killed
[1:43:00] the lion
[1:43:03] oh aren't you no aren't you glad that
[1:43:04] god is real god is alive
[1:43:06] he's dead up my word has gone forth and
[1:43:09] it will not return void god says heaven
[1:43:13] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:43:14] it's gonna hit its mark
[1:43:23] we used to be better men and women
[1:43:26] we used to be that if we said something
[1:43:28] that was a bond
[1:43:30] that was the bull's eye you could
[1:43:32] rely on it
[1:43:34] but look at where it's gotten to today
[1:43:36] huh
[1:43:39] lord help us
[1:43:41] we better get zeroed in
[1:43:43] says you know here i am in a pulpit here
[1:43:45] and i know i've got the answer today of
[1:43:47] judgment
[1:43:48] but he says the voice came back when he
[1:43:49] was crying about that he says i made you
[1:43:52] that way
[1:43:55] i made you that way that you would be
[1:43:56] irritated if it doesn't hit the bullseye
[1:44:00] that's why oh the prophet of god that's
[1:44:02] why everything he taught it was exactly
[1:44:04] according to the bible he says don't you
[1:44:07] just put your name on the book and be
[1:44:08] thinking that you're a part of the
[1:44:09] church of god the bible says by one
[1:44:11] spirit are we all baptized
[1:44:14] to one body
[1:44:16] that's how you come into christ that's
[1:44:18] the real joining of church
[1:44:20] it's be by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:23] you are joined into the body of christ
[1:44:25] and members in particular
[1:44:27] that's how you become a member
[1:44:31] not just by
[1:44:33] shaking the preacher's hand or
[1:44:35] showing up in church or
[1:44:37] being regular in church said don't do it
[1:44:39] you got to be born by the spirit of god
[1:44:42] jesus says unless a man is born again
[1:44:45] he'll never see the kingdom of heaven
[1:44:47] all you have is a mental conception of
[1:44:49] it
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:54] you love the lord
[1:44:56] let's not miss the mark
[1:44:59] let's be
[1:45:00] more precise
[1:45:03] it's got to be that on
[1:45:06] we have to be zeroed
[1:45:08] amen zeroed on what
[1:45:12] the road on what
[1:45:14] zeroed
[1:45:15] on christ
[1:45:17] how many remembers christ's mystery of
[1:45:19] god revealed by the band talks about how
[1:45:20] that in the bible says you know the
[1:45:22] mystery of christ is christ in you the
[1:45:24] hope of glory
[1:45:26] christ is the center of the revelation
[1:45:28] of the whole thing he says therefore our
[1:45:31] conversation in our life it all ought to
[1:45:33] be centered around christ
[1:45:37] everything we do everything we say our
[1:45:39] reaction has to be centered
[1:45:42] in christ
[1:45:43] it has to be like christ
[1:45:47] huh
[1:45:52] how about let's make a deal this morning
[1:45:55] i'll look at my life and see if every
[1:45:56] portion of it is centered
[1:45:58] you look at yours
[1:46:00] look at your life really good and see if
[1:46:02] everything you do everything you say
[1:46:04] every action that you have it's focused
[1:46:06] on christ
[1:46:08] how much we have heard in the last
[1:46:10] couple months of uh having god's
[1:46:13] morning when you get up having him
[1:46:14] wearing the middle of the day telling
[1:46:16] your children about it tying up on your
[1:46:18] bedpost day and night meditated on a day
[1:46:20] and night heaven centered on him
[1:46:23] because how many knows you get that
[1:46:24] vision you got that
[1:46:26] vision of him in the center of your life
[1:46:28] off and it ain't long
[1:46:30] before you're doing things way off
[1:46:35] and you get a little off
[1:46:38] how about way out there
[1:46:40] huh
[1:46:42] people not these pews are a lot of pews
[1:46:44] are empty folks
[1:46:46] from people who have gotten off
[1:46:49] got their focus off
[1:46:52] their vision off of the center and that
[1:46:54] is christ
[1:46:56] in you
[1:46:57] the hope of glory
[1:46:59] remember when the power of god come back
[1:47:01] from beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:47:02] there's nothing but perfect love there
[1:47:06] there wasn't anybody there remembering
[1:47:09] what somebody else had done to them
[1:47:14] nobody there like that
[1:47:16] there was nobody there with bitterness
[1:47:19] no hatred or variance none whatsoever
[1:47:23] and he began to zero it down and i say
[1:47:25] you know and it'll take perfect love to
[1:47:28] put you in there
[1:47:34] i'm here to tell you christ wants us
[1:47:37] perfectly
[1:47:39] in him
[1:47:47] he wants us
[1:47:49] perfectly
[1:47:50] in him
[1:47:53] i'll go a little further
[1:47:56] he wants you
[1:47:58] to be
[1:47:59] perfect
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:07] is that a mouse can i hear a mouse
[1:48:10] we're getting quiet now aren't we
[1:48:12] it's quiet when the preacher says we
[1:48:14] gotta be perfect
[1:48:24] i say unto you jesus matthew 5 41 44 but
[1:48:28] i say unto you
[1:48:30] well let me go back one you have heard
[1:48:32] that it has been said thou shalt love
[1:48:34] thy neighbor
[1:48:35] and hate that enemy
[1:48:37] but i say until you love your enemies
[1:48:39] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:48:41] them that hate you
[1:48:43] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:48:45] and persecute you
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:51] can i take my time
[1:48:54] folks i want you to know that god does
[1:48:55] not want a fair weather friend
[1:48:59] i want to tell you right now i don't
[1:49:01] like a fair weather friend when i say
[1:49:03] i'm your friend i try to be that through
[1:49:05] the
[1:49:06] thick and the thin
[1:49:08] through the good and the bad no matter
[1:49:09] what i'm gonna be your friend
[1:49:11] hello
[1:49:15] some friends the first time somebody
[1:49:16] does a little something against ain't no
[1:49:18] friends no more i'm gonna defriend him
[1:49:20] you never was much of a friend in the
[1:49:22] first place go ahead and befriend me if
[1:49:24] you please would
[1:49:25] i don't want a friend like you
[1:49:31] amen
[1:49:34] how about god oh my remember he says and
[1:49:38] it was my way he chose my way brother
[1:49:41] chose god's way
[1:49:43] that's a smart choice that's a that's a
[1:49:45] precise choice
[1:49:46] to choose god's way
[1:49:50] remember another scripture that comes to
[1:49:51] my mind is where uh over in
[1:49:55] hebrews that i believe it was hebrews he
[1:49:57] says you know i won't let them come i
[1:50:00] won't let them enter into my rest
[1:50:02] because you know they stumbled they fell
[1:50:04] at this side or the other and he says
[1:50:05] and they have not known
[1:50:08] my ways
[1:50:11] people don't know god's way god's way
[1:50:14] is for you to go through some really
[1:50:16] hard times as a christian
[1:50:18] and still love god anyway
[1:50:21] i ain't quitting for nothing
[1:50:24] that's god's way
[1:50:26] god allowed all kinds of hardships to
[1:50:28] befall israel
[1:50:30] huh
[1:50:31] he let him get thirsty he let him get
[1:50:33] hungry he let him get trapped and
[1:50:35] nowhere to go
[1:50:38] running in circles down there by the red
[1:50:40] sea what are we going to do what are we
[1:50:41] going to do what we're going to do i'd
[1:50:42] love to get you to say what am i going
[1:50:44] to do what am i going to do
[1:50:46] because then you're going to make a
[1:50:48] choice
[1:50:51] well god well i'll tell you what god
[1:50:53] gonna be like that right
[1:50:55] or just stand still
[1:50:58] and watch god bring us through the thing
[1:51:00] that's what he's looking for he was
[1:51:02] looking for that in daniel he was
[1:51:04] looking for the rack and we never
[1:51:05] finished my side dragon we shot him
[1:51:07] indigo shadrach meshach and
[1:51:09] abednego they didn't know for sure
[1:51:10] whether god was going to do it or not
[1:51:12] but they made a right and correct and
[1:51:13] precise choice and they got in the
[1:51:16] king's face and said we are not very
[1:51:17] careful about how we tell you this but
[1:51:19] we're not dying
[1:51:24] and it made that king so mad because
[1:51:26] they were disrespectful to him
[1:51:29] you know
[1:51:30] we are not bound to that image
[1:51:33] he got that furnace seven times hotter
[1:51:37] i will fry the
[1:51:39] boys
[1:51:42] god didn't stop it
[1:51:44] didn't deliver him he let him fall in
[1:51:46] the very soldiers that pushed him in
[1:51:48] that fiery furnace
[1:51:49] died because of the heat
[1:51:52] but when the king went to looking at him
[1:51:54] all
[1:51:55] burnt to a crisp he says didn't we throw
[1:51:57] three in there
[1:51:59] yeah there's four and the fourth man
[1:52:02] looks like the son of god
[1:52:04] hello
[1:52:05] lord
[1:52:07] they made the right choice they made the
[1:52:10] precise choice
[1:52:12] and god was there precisely on time
[1:52:18] if you will be precise about your
[1:52:20] choices god will be precise about you
[1:52:26] oh man that ought to get us running
[1:52:27] around this church it ought to make us
[1:52:30] so we can't hardly stand ourselves to
[1:52:32] know that if you will give oh
[1:52:35] i want more of jesus more and more and
[1:52:37] more i want more of jesus so i give him
[1:52:40] more of me
[1:52:44] make a choice to serve god see what
[1:52:46] happens
[1:52:49] reject him and see what happens
[1:52:54] aren't you glad
[1:52:56] make the right make the choice not be
[1:52:58] let me just say this a lot of times
[1:53:02] we have to get another job you know why
[1:53:05] because we got fired
[1:53:07] i know about you but i don't like to get
[1:53:09] fired
[1:53:12] it forces you to have to go out there
[1:53:13] and look for another job
[1:53:15] huh
[1:53:16] you might have a car wreck and you
[1:53:18] really like that car
[1:53:20] but guess what now you're forced to get
[1:53:21] another car
[1:53:23] there's a lot of problems a lot of
[1:53:24] issues sometimes trials that we have
[1:53:26] that force us into things
[1:53:30] and we adjust accordingly don't we
[1:53:32] we are survivors
[1:53:35] the human beings two are survivors
[1:53:38] but that's not the kind i'm talking
[1:53:39] about you know what i'm talking about
[1:53:40] when brother ben made a choice
[1:53:42] he wasn't forced into it he wasn't
[1:53:44] coerced into it it was his choosing that
[1:53:46] angel said it was you just something you
[1:53:48] chose to do
[1:53:52] [Applause]
[1:53:53] not because he was pushed god can push
[1:53:55] us into anything is that right
[1:53:59] but when you make a choice
[1:54:04] let me tell you this
[1:54:06] the atomic bombs aren't flying
[1:54:09] the economy hasn't crashed crashed we
[1:54:11] all got food in our fridge in our
[1:54:13] freezers and everything
[1:54:14] is going good
[1:54:17] huh
[1:54:20] i would dare say
[1:54:21] most of us are doing better than
[1:54:23] probably ever have
[1:54:25] maybe not all
[1:54:27] maybe not all
[1:54:29] but think about it
[1:54:31] and it's not a catastrophe that's
[1:54:33] pushing us into something but i'm here
[1:54:36] to tell you god is looking at what you
[1:54:38] will do and how you will serve him in
[1:54:41] the good times
[1:54:43] even israel he says you know you were
[1:54:45] skinny and all alone and everything but
[1:54:46] now you've gotten fat and you have
[1:54:48] forsaken me and you have forgotten where
[1:54:51] you was huge from
[1:54:52] people forget that hey it's when it's
[1:54:54] going good that's when you need to
[1:54:56] remember god
[1:55:00] when you need to get even more closer to
[1:55:02] god
[1:55:03] not just the bad times don't make god
[1:55:04] have to throw you on your back in some
[1:55:06] hospital to get you to get closer to him
[1:55:10] i don't want him to have to do that to
[1:55:12] me
[1:55:13] amen
[1:55:16] god is good isn't he
[1:55:18] all right i got another ten minutes is
[1:55:20] that all right
[1:55:22] i love the lord don't you
[1:55:25] don't
[1:55:26] be
[1:55:28] sloppy
[1:55:36] because i don't know about you but i
[1:55:37] have been many times in my life
[1:55:39] too sloppy with things i don't know
[1:55:41] about if you're anything like me or not
[1:55:42] but you're too sloppy with things
[1:55:47] but in my old age
[1:55:49] i'm sure everyone reminds me no as you
[1:55:51] get older you're less sloppy about
[1:55:53] things
[1:55:54] folks how about if you have a job how
[1:55:55] many knows you're not sloppy if you want
[1:55:57] that job you better be there at seven
[1:55:58] o'clock
[1:55:59] you're not better not be sloppy or
[1:56:00] you'll lose your job
[1:56:02] you sisters you can't be too sloppy or
[1:56:04] your house is gonna look really terrible
[1:56:07] them dishes are gonna stink in that tank

[1:56:11] it done
[1:56:13] you got to do something with it you got
[1:56:15] to make a choice
[1:56:19] amen and then you've got the extremists
[1:56:21] right to where it's just got to be
[1:56:24] perfect
[1:56:26] the carpet in that certain room you go
[1:56:29] back and forth a certain way and you
[1:56:30] want to see all those lines just
[1:56:32] perfectly don't just go wrong in a
[1:56:34] circle vacuum back you know extremists
[1:56:40] maybe we need to be that about our life
[1:56:42] be an extremist about your life
[1:56:45] because if you're sloppy folks you're
[1:56:46] going to have a rough life it's not
[1:56:47] going to be good
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:51] lord help us
[1:56:53] amen you love him this morning praise
[1:56:56] the lord
[1:56:57] many scriptures we could go to
[1:56:59] but we're not perfect paul said we're
[1:57:01] not perfect i haven't quite gotten there
[1:57:02] yet but i'm working on it i'm forgetting
[1:57:05] no things behind
[1:57:07] and i'm pressing on
[1:57:09] i'm pressing for the mark for the prize
[1:57:11] of the high calling even paul said you
[1:57:13] know though that run in a race run all
[1:57:16] but he said one receives the prize
[1:57:19] i mean those are churches churches
[1:57:21] churches churches brides to all kind of
[1:57:23] people but there's one that's going to
[1:57:25] be there with him
[1:57:28] he's going to have a church that's
[1:57:29] without spot without wrinkle
[1:57:34] amen
[1:57:36] thank you lord hold on a minute i didn't
[1:57:38] finish my scripture he brought me back
[1:57:39] to it
[1:57:42] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:57:44] that you may be the children of your
[1:57:46] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:57:48] the sun to rise on the evil and the good
[1:57:50] and send us reign on the just and the
[1:57:51] unjust and if you love them which love
[1:57:54] you what what reward have you do not
[1:57:56] even republicans the same and if you
[1:57:58] sleep you salute your brother only
[1:58:00] do not others also
[1:58:03] do not even republicans that way isn't
[1:58:06] that the way that it is
[1:58:08] every clan i don't care what it is every
[1:58:10] group of people they love their own
[1:58:14] and they make fun of the others
[1:58:16] huh
[1:58:17] they don't care so much about the others
[1:58:23] let me just say this
[1:58:24] imagine a world
[1:58:27] where everybody
[1:58:29] did this
[1:58:33] it would be a perfect world
[1:58:36] everybody would love everybody
[1:58:38] he'd have perfect love with everybody
[1:58:42] there would be no racial things
[1:58:45] there would be no
[1:58:46] barriers between rich or poor or or
[1:58:49] whatever it might be
[1:58:50] everybody would love everybody
[1:58:53] and isn't it strange isn't it something
[1:58:55] that brother i mean not brother but
[1:58:57] jesus himself stopped and used the
[1:59:00] illustration of loving your enemies and
[1:59:03] the very last words he used be
[1:59:06] ye
[1:59:07] therefore
[1:59:09] perfect
[1:59:11] even as your daddy
[1:59:14] is perfect to put it in
[1:59:16] the new
[1:59:17] version
[1:59:21] even as your
[1:59:23] father which is in heaven
[1:59:26] is perfect
[1:59:29] amen
[1:59:32] the way that i have been taught
[1:59:35] of what perfection is
[1:59:37] is that if you are in christ
[1:59:40] as long as you're still in this flesh
[1:59:41] this flesh will still make mistakes
[1:59:45] but if instantly when you make that
[1:59:47] mistake you say god forgive me
[1:59:50] god still sees you as perfect
[1:59:54] he sees you as perfect because you're
[1:59:56] being cleansed as you go
[2:00:00] because you know i know both know that
[2:00:01] this flesh will always strip you up

[2:00:06] but you know we as preachers we got to
[2:00:08] be careful when it comes to this subject
[2:00:10] it's a touchy subject because easily we
[2:00:13] can say well you'll never be perfect now
[2:00:15] be careful
[2:00:16] because if you lean too much that way
[2:00:18] all you're telling people is you don't
[2:00:20] got to worry about being perfect
[2:00:22] you ain't gotta worry about the mistake
[2:00:24] and those failures that you have hey if
[2:00:25] it's sin and if it's against the word of
[2:00:27] god you'd ought to hurt you when you do
[2:00:30] it

[2:00:39] of the mistakes that you've made in the
[2:00:40] past i say that because of personal
[2:00:42] experience when you look back at those
[2:00:44] mistakes you really still regret him
[2:00:49] you still
[2:00:50] regret him oh if i just wouldn't have
[2:00:52] done that
