[0:00] amen certainly was kind of
[0:03] I
[0:04] used to see the different ones that we
[0:06] had amen and so
[0:09] but um and we prayed just before we went
[0:12] up there I said Lord help us somehow
[0:13] just to be a witness and a testimony for
[0:15] you amen and just Desiring that God had
[0:18] used us in a greater way amen
[0:20] man I feel like you know if we're ever
[0:23] going to do something for the Lord you
[0:25] know it's now is the time to do it amen
[0:27] amen so I think but at Brandon one time
[0:30] he was when he went beyond the curtain
[0:32] of time you know he was sitting on the
[0:34] bed and he talks if boy you better if
[0:36] you if you I don't know what he was how
[0:38] old was he 53
[0:40] something like that and he said boy if
[0:42] you're ever going to do something for
[0:43] the Lord you better do it and so amen
[0:45] well I'll tell you what the hours late I
[0:47] mean how many leaves the hours late but
[0:50] anyway we uh and we did we really did
[0:52] but the help of the lord we I mean got
[0:54] to amen just start off right off the go
[0:57] get the first night we got there we
[0:58] probably sat two two and a half hours or
[1:01] so just witnessing and talking about the
[1:03] Lord so I really like that you know
[1:04] because I mean the time before it just
[1:07] didn't seem to open up amen and you know
[1:09] and whenever you're witnessing to to
[1:11] people you know it's always good amen I
[1:14] always like for that anointing to come
[1:16] there amen because if you're going to
[1:18] preach the gospel to the poor the
[1:20] Brokenhearted and all that you know I
[1:22] believe it says uh how does it say
[1:25] something about the Lord has anointed me
[1:28] to preach the gospel he was anointed to
[1:30] preach I mean I don't believe you have
[1:31] to be anointed and it makes such a
[1:33] difference amen and it's quite something
[1:35] out of that uh just the wrong person in
[1:37] the room or just the wrong person yeah
[1:39] talking to her and and cutting in or
[1:42] whatever it might be can just kind of
[1:43] mess things up but I like it when it
[1:46] really flows amen and so we just really
[1:49] got to share more and and talk more but
[1:51] it wasn't really until I got back amen
[1:53] that I found out that for probably five
[1:57] miles
[1:57] uh five miles maybe somewhere in there
[2:01] very far from the very farm that I was
[2:03] raised I found out that there's a
[2:05] message search being built amen and so I
[2:08] always got pretty excited about that and
[2:10] so I found out who he was
[2:13] that's kind of in charge of it and today
[2:16] I got on the phone with him and probably
[2:18] talked close to half an hour just
[2:20] talking to him and kind of get the feel
[2:22] of it you know because you know you
[2:23] never know what in the world is going to
[2:24] be going on and I still don't know just
[2:26] the depth of it but I do want to find
[2:28] out I mean just what
[2:31] is what all is going on Amen but I found
[2:33] out enough to know that uh the man
[2:36] that's building it
[2:38] um I guess
[2:39] and he and his brother requested church
[2:42] prayer for all us to pray for his
[2:43] Brethren the person I talked to was Levi
[2:46] Yoder and his brother Ben amen he hasn't
[2:49] even really left the Amish yet but he
[2:51] doesn't believe the message Amy believes
[2:54] the message and and so I don't know I
[2:56] don't know how a man can do that but he
[2:59] he was just I guess laid on his heart to
[3:01] start building and I'm going to show you
[3:03] a few slides of that building amen and
[3:05] so and I'm really really really I had
[3:08] been praying him and I I've tried to get
[3:10] my brother my first cousin David just I
[3:13] just to have some Home Services right
[3:15] there I've never really got got him
[3:17] inspired to do it while we're up there
[3:19] you know and so I never could get
[3:21] inspired which this Sunday morning I
[3:23] think he did say well we should have
[3:24] just had you preach and have a service
[3:25] here
[3:27] you know so he finally opened the door
[3:29] that much and I says well I'd be glad to
[3:30] you know but of course not that not
[3:32] today because we was fixing to go and
[3:35] all but
[3:36] um and so anyway but he kind of kind of
[3:38] opened that up but when I heard that uh
[3:41] there's actually a message Church being
[3:42] built and so now to finish the story on
[3:45] Ben his brother Levi's brother it is and
[3:50] brother Ben and I like I said 20 30
[3:52] minutes of talk isn't enough I need to
[3:54] do a lot of investigating yet and and
[3:56] everything's preliminary yet here but
[3:59] but he talked like he wasn't you know
[4:01] his ministry he didn't feel like his
[4:03] ministry was for that area or that
[4:06] church or whatever uh he don't know
[4:08] where the Lord wants him yet you know uh
[4:10] but um but anyway so you know and so I
[4:13] don't know about Levi I mean but Ben I
[4:16] don't know you know if this brother
[4:17] that's leaving I don't know if he's a
[4:19] minister or not
[4:21] uh you know but anyway so we still have
[4:23] to find a lot of that out but pray for
[4:25] him because his wife is really kind of
[4:27] against it amen his wife is kind of
[4:29] against it and uh he stands to lose his
[4:32] business which you know a prosperous
[4:34] business he stands loses family amen and
[4:38] so he's trying to take it slow not just
[4:40] to rush out of there uh and just to take
[4:42] off leave it all amen so he is trying to
[4:45] be patient which I think that's wise
[4:47] amen amen if you possibly can you want
[4:50] to run it want to try to do that but do
[4:52] remember uh brother must be Benjamin but
[4:55] his name he called him Ben you're to
[4:57] pray for him and so anyway
[4:59] bye I talked to Levi I told him that I'd
[5:03] like to come back up there amen maybe
[5:05] help a little bit with the construction
[5:06] I certainly want to get hands on with
[5:09] that whole church amen to get my hands
[5:11] on it and help out a little bit and find
[5:13] out more details so amen if if we go
[5:17] with what we're feeling now probably
[5:18] about end up next week going back up
[5:21] there for two three days and I told him
[5:23] that I would help perhaps frame out some
[5:25] windows and things like that but I
[5:27] mostly want to go amen for fellowship
[5:30] and finding out amen different things
[5:32] but I found out and even he said there's
[5:35] a lot of different churches around the
[5:38] area of people who have left the Amish
[5:41] so you can imagine the the door you know
[5:43] and he was telling me about some of them
[5:45] in a different different directions they
[5:47] go and you know of course there was I
[5:50] guess um
[5:51] uh brother Chad Lamb and I don't know I
[5:54] need to find out just who Chad Lamb is
[5:57] he I think baptized about 17 Amish at a
[5:59] time and they're just south of where
[6:01] this is I guess and so I want to get
[6:03] into that group and find out where they
[6:05] are this brother here I think he goes to
[6:07] whether he claimed by the Chad Lamb as
[6:09] his pastor but he said the Lord revealed
[6:11] to him that that wasn't his search home
[6:13] amen but uh that he's going there for
[6:16] now when he can and so forth and I think
[6:18] he's the one that baptized him and so
[6:20] forth but there's just a lot that he
[6:21] told me about different ones that are
[6:23] coming out now uh there's different
[6:25] things that different ones do and and
[6:27] brother Levi expressed that to me and I
[6:30] also expressed that I saw that same
[6:32] thing that most Amish people
[6:34] well
[6:35] leave the Amish really don't want a
[6:37] bunch of the do's and don'ts and and you
[6:40] got to do this and you got to do that
[6:41] and so for a lot of times they they
[6:44] either most of them are a lot of them
[6:45] just want Grace everything's Grace
[6:48] you know and of course the grace I saw
[6:49] was pretty disgraceful
[6:52] but anyway uh anyway you know it's just
[6:56] not all Grace amen and but anyway and
[6:59] then there's others that come out that
[7:01] really want the truth but there's a lot
[7:02] of people that are really wanting and
[7:04] Desiring the truth amen and so there's a
[7:07] whole world there there's a I feel like
[7:09] there's a big work there that could be
[7:11] done amen and so if if the Lord wants me
[7:15] to help in any way I'm open for it amen
[7:17] amen not the pastor their church or
[7:19] anything like that but just to go and
[7:20] try to be a help on the benefit and you
[7:23] know help build it up and help establish
[7:25] you know something up there so that uh
[7:27] there can be I would I told them I was
[7:30] ecstatic because I've been praying and
[7:32] every time I go up there I say Lord
[7:33] Jesus I certainly love to see a message
[7:36] church right in the middle of all this
[7:38] hey man I mean we're talking about
[7:40] uh grow in the midst of gross Darkness
[7:43] because I'm going to tell you right now
[7:45] that trying to get a word edgewise into
[7:47] an Amish person or whatever amen those
[7:50] folks are in about as Darkness as you
[7:53] can get because once people break away
[7:55] from that or even Mennonite or higher
[7:58] Amish or sour Amish or go any hip step
[8:00] higher they can believe more of the
[8:02] Bible but they're not even supposed to
[8:04] talk to you pretty much about scriptures
[8:06] or whatever and they'll think you crazy
[8:07] if we taste stuff you know and so that's
[8:10] they're they're in very gross darkness
[8:12] and so forth and and so it's you know I
[8:15] would love to have seen a delight come
[8:17] in the middle all that I mean because I
[8:19] mean it's a big world folks it's that
[8:21] big world when you're talking about the
[8:23] Amish and and so forth you know we had
[8:25] like 180 I guess showed up to my uh the
[8:28] home the reunion about 180 you know and
[8:31] I I'm thinking I may have told you all
[8:33] the wrong number last time but just like
[8:35] I told you my one Uncle amen that had
[8:37] one wife had 16 children and I think 150
[8:40] grandchildren and about 300 great
[8:42] grandchildren I think that was closer to
[8:44] the right number so you can imagine
[8:45] that's just one Uncle hey man can you
[8:47] imagine if they'd all come to the
[8:49] reunion if just one of them it had been
[8:51] 500 people almost
[8:54] at least at 450 something like that you
[8:57] know but of course you know my uncle my
[8:59] one Uncle uh yoss you know and he was he
[9:03] he had me to say a prayer over the food
[9:05] so that was kind of an honor but
[9:07] um anyway you know he he worded it he
[9:10] says we're not having a reunion we're
[9:11] just having a get-together because
[9:14] Sports Central Paramus could go to a
[9:16] get-together but they can't go to
[9:18] a reunion and so but anyway I went to my
[9:22] friend and I went to school with Jacob I
[9:24] haven't had to go see him again you know
[9:25] and he's a real staunch Amish man anyway
[9:27] and I went over there and and and pulled
[9:29] in and there's a lot of Amish people
[9:31] there you know at his house I said
[9:32] what's going on in his house well I
[9:33] don't care I'm gonna pull in here anyway
[9:35] so I pulled in there and and there was a
[9:38] bunch of Amish guys standing there and I
[9:39] said hey can y'all is check it out here
[9:42] you know and they looked around and went
[9:44] and called for Jacob Jacob come out
[9:46] there and he seen me you know and and uh
[9:49] he was having an auction I guess for for
[9:51] for some reason anyway some some
[9:54] something that had to do with kin folks
[9:56] and the cousins kind of like I guess
[9:58] when my aunt Katie died we had a
[10:00] cousin's auction where only just a
[10:02] family comes and it was kind of that but
[10:04] that Jacob said well your brother
[10:06] David's here so he went over there David
[10:07] David your brothers here so I see my one
[10:10] I have one Amish brother and one I'm a
[10:12] sister David of course lives in Missouri
[10:13] and so it was just coincidence there was
[10:15] my brother you know and he come out and
[10:18] said I got out of the truck of course
[10:19] and we talked around with those Amish
[10:21] guys for a little bit chatting and
[10:22] cutting up a little bit and whatnot but
[10:24] anyway but let me just go on I I want to
[10:27] be all night here but
[10:29] um talking about that but that was I'm
[10:30] really excited and it was I've been
[10:32] praying that God would do something in
[10:34] that area so I hope that this is that
[10:36] work if it is I certainly am excited
[10:38] about it and and so forth so that there
[10:40] are people that do look for the truth
[10:43] and want light they can have the light
[10:45] amen
[10:46] amen so we're going to show you a couple
[10:48] pictures of that church I guess that is
[10:50] being built if you want to do that Micah
[10:51] amen I'm going to hit the light up here
[10:54] amen and so kind of show it like from
[10:57] the start I guess this is and this is uh
[10:59] in Wilmot Ohio amen and
[11:03] so they've I think they have like 50 000
[11:05] or something to go with and so they
[11:07] don't have a whole lot they won't be
[11:09] able to finish it but gun they're going
[11:10] to take it as far as they can so I think
[11:12] the property on the left hand side and
[11:14] this building I don't know if it's on
[11:15] the same property but go on to the next
[11:17] one
[11:19] I can't wait to go there and see of
[11:21] course they have some big equipment
[11:22] there and I think they need a little
[11:24] more than that but they've got a
[11:25] bulldozer there to kind of level things
[11:27] up
[11:28] and uh anyway go to the next one
[11:31] there's some pictures of all right go on
[11:35] the next one and there of course you see
[11:37] and I asked him how big it was I don't
[11:38] know just how big it was but he didn't
[11:41] he didn't get a chance to tell me that
[11:42] but anyway so that's what it's looking
[11:44] like amen and I think they're gonna have
[11:46] radiant heat in the floor and uh go
[11:50] ahead come on
[11:51] all right boy those are some wide anyway
[11:55] those windows there's a there's a bunch
[11:57] of Windows that need framed in and I
[11:59] told him well save me the window framing
[12:01] in job he says he would if I come up
[12:03] there he did and nobody else comes and
[12:05] offers to do it I'll get to try to get
[12:07] in there and frame out some windows go
[12:09] to the next one
[12:11] all right now you can't see it I guess
[12:13] but uh he said over here on the left
[12:16] side now I know what he's got in mind
[12:17] but he said this here's the Buggy Barn
[12:19] over here
[12:24] you can't zoom it in I don't think but I
[12:27] stairs I believe there's a lot of
[12:28] Windows in that Barn all right and he
[12:31] told me the story about those windows
[12:33] yeah you can see some of them Lord of
[12:35] Mercy I don't know what I got myself
[12:36] into probably real big but
[12:38] anyway uh he said that uh they got it
[12:42] was going to have to spend ten thousand
[12:43] dollars on Windows and they went on
[12:45] Facebook
[12:47] what is it
[12:48] Marketplace yeah and they found some you
[12:51] know for a lot cheaper like 150 each or
[12:53] whatever and they went to pick them up
[12:55] and when they got went to pick them up
[12:57] they knew this guy and they ended up
[12:59] knowing each other and they were friends
[13:01] with this guy and this driver and and at
[13:04] the end of it he said just to show that
[13:05] it was the Lord working he said at the
[13:07] end of it he says just take a thousand
[13:09] dollars for all of them you know and so
[13:11] he gave them they're cheap so he got all
[13:13] those windows they're cheap amen so
[13:15] praise the Lord he was very glad for
[13:17] that but anyway
[13:19] um I asked him I said if we come up I
[13:21] said do we have a midweek service
[13:22] somewhere do you have a midweek service
[13:24] well he said well there's a church in
[13:26] Akron Ohio he says about an hour away I
[13:29] mean I had been told about that before
[13:31] so if I go he says he wants he would
[13:33] certainly want to take you know go along
[13:34] with us up there amen and go to that
[13:37] church so I don't know where he's at I
[13:38] don't know if he even got a vehicle or
[13:39] what but I do know that he offered me a
[13:41] room to stay and so forth he says but
[13:44] now we don't have any power or electric
[13:45] we don't have any air conditioner it's
[13:47] still fans and battery so you know
[13:50] anyway so that's kind of where he is and
[13:52] that and I think you know they're just
[13:54] they're real hungry they you know real
[13:56] hungry for the word but that's what's
[13:57] going on and and like I said you know
[14:00] they're just building building it and so
[14:02] that's right in five miles from what I
[14:04] was raised amen and the closest one
[14:06] would be Akron so we plan on going up
[14:08] there
[14:10] um so anyway that's that's what we found
[14:12] out and that's where it is and I'm gonna
[14:14] go before we would even help with that
[14:17] financially I certainly want to find out
[14:19] just how legit how how I feel about the
[14:22] whole thing you know but I do want to go
[14:24] up and you know meet some people and I
[14:27] from what I understand there's different
[14:28] groups there's different Church groups
[14:30] that are you know have come out of the
[14:32] Amish that you know you have a chance
[14:34] there they had Revival Services down
[14:36] there and so forth that he was telling
[14:37] about I don't want to get into all of
[14:39] that but amen and it's where a lot of
[14:41] people and different ones were even
[14:42] baptized and so forth but anyway all
[14:45] right is that the only one I think that
[14:46] may be about the last one
[14:48] but that's that's what I found out and
[14:50] praise the Lord I was pretty excited I
[14:52] said Lord I just hope uh you know and so
[14:55] I don't know you know what will all
[14:56] happen but I certainly hope that
[14:58] um
[14:59] the Lord does a real work there and
[15:01] praise the Lord amen and so any time
[15:05] you're doing something like that for the
[15:06] Lord and and I just pray that God will
[15:09] establish a real Rock Solid Message
[15:11] Church there amen praise the Lord it
[15:13] would be really good to see amen stand
[15:15] with me we'll get into the word of God
[15:16] tonight amen
[15:19] all right as he was trying something
[15:21] different aren't we all right well we'll
[15:23] see how that works amen praise the Lord
[15:25] God is good isn't he good to see y'all
[15:28] it's good to be back amen
[15:31] amen praise the Lord amen so I just
[15:35] wanna I felt like this last message that
[15:37] I preached again I just I mean there's a
[15:39] certain direction of it that I didn't go
[15:41] to that I want to just go tonight if
[15:43] that's okay amen so we'll just kind of
[15:45] pick up amen where we left off once
[15:47] again and and so forth me praying for
[15:49] Brother Brad he's going to take this
[15:51] Sunday Services amen amen and so amen
[15:55] God bless you I I listen to brother amen
[15:59] uh
[16:00] brother Jonathan Jones amen he was real
[16:04] fired up Sunday wasn't him in that was
[16:06] good I really enjoyed that that was real
[16:09] good good to have him and so forth I
[16:13] mean let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we
[16:15] just come before you humbly before you
[16:16] once again Lord thanking you Lord Jesus

[17:03] Jesus Christ's name
[17:04] amen I want to speak on the fruit of our
[17:08] nature
[17:10] the fruit of our nature bearing more
[17:13] fruit amen
[17:16] the fruit of our nature I think last
[17:18] time we spoke on Amen our nature and how
[17:22] that that's what the power of God does
[17:25] is to change our very desires our nature
[17:28] that's something that you can't fight a
[17:30] lot of times it's nature amen and so uh
[17:34] other than a transformation and so
[17:37] praise the Lord if you will turn your
[17:39] Bibles I have a lot of scriptures but
[17:40] I'll just amen I think we will perhaps
[17:44] start with
[17:46] um let's just go to Galatians we'll
[17:48] start with Galatians
[17:51] five Galatians 5.
[18:04] Satan powerless isn't that right
[18:06] rendering him powerless I mean making it
[18:10] so that he has or tying him or binding
[18:13] him with a chain of circumstances
[18:16] because amen if he doesn't have anything
[18:19] to work through he can't do anything
[18:21] amen oh my uh when you just think about
[18:26] how many knows Eve just opened up her
[18:28] mind isn't that right and the devil got
[18:31] one word in there that he shouldn't have
[18:33] got in there
[18:35] just one word that he slipped in and he
[18:38] changed everything amen how many knows
[18:42] that's why we have to guard our mind and
[18:44] our thoughts that come into our hearts
[18:46] into my mind because just one word
[18:50] because Spirits goes with words one word
[18:53] One thought whatever it can change your
[18:56] whole entire being
[18:58] amen praise the Lord good to see you
[19:01] tonight brother wood amen praise the
[19:04] Lord amen so now let's read in the
[19:07] Galatians 5.
[19:09] and verse 16. notice I want to speak
[19:13] about the nature amen or the fruit of
[19:17] our nature praise the Lord
[19:20] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[19:22] ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[19:24] flesh for the flesh lusts us against the
[19:26] spirit and the spirit against the Flesh
[19:28] and these are contrary one to another so
[19:31] that you cannot do the things that you
[19:33] would but if you be led by the spirit
[19:35] and you are not under the law now the
[19:38] works of the flesh are manifest which
[19:40] are these adultery fornication
[19:41] uncleanness
[19:42] lasciviousness idolatic
[19:45] tree
[19:46] witchcraft hatred variance emulation
[19:49] wrath strife seditions heresies and
[19:52] beings and murderers and drunkenness and
[19:55] revelings and such like up to which I
[19:57] tell you before as I have told you in
[19:59] times past the day which do such things
[20:01] shall not inherit the kingdom of God
[20:04] but the fruit of the spirit amen that's
[20:07] why I called amen how many notes this is
[20:09] your first nature what we just read
[20:12] about was is your first nature it's the
[20:14] fruit of your first nature amen here is
[20:18] the fruit of your second nature but the
[20:21] fruit of the spirit is love and joy and
[20:23] peace and long-suffering and gentleness
[20:25] and goodness and faith and meekness and
[20:28] Temperance against such there is no law
[20:31] and they that are Christ have crucified
[20:34] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[20:37] and if you live in the spirit let us
[20:40] also walk in the spirit God bless the
[20:42] reading of the word you can be seated
[20:44] tonight amen we want to talk a little
[20:47] bit about the black dog and the white
[20:49] dog with the help of the lord we want to
[20:50] talk about amen when we talk about our
[20:52] flesh and we want to talk about the
[20:54] spirit is that okay it is certainly
[20:57] something that all through the Bible all
[20:59] down through was much spoken of and I
[21:01] think I will probably conclude with a
[21:04] man Paul all in Romans 7 where he talks
[21:06] about aiming the Flesh and the power of
[21:08] the Flesh and what it does but I wrote
[21:10] down here talking about our nature now
[21:12] the first nature that we have it gives
[21:15] the devil a open door
[21:19] isn't that right amen he gives him
[21:21] complete an Open Door amen an Open
[21:24] Season so to speak
[21:26] amen first we know that we were born in
[21:30] sin shaped in iniquity come into this
[21:33] world
[21:35] speaking the truth
[21:37] no speaking lies so we know our first
[21:41] nature is devilish it's oh my
[21:46] um I think it was Paul that said you
[21:49] know in Romans 7 he says that I know
[21:52] that in my flesh in me and then in
[21:55] parentheses they put in there that is in
[21:57] my flesh dwelleth
[22:00] no good thing
[22:04] amen
[22:06] talk about the flesh we don't want to
[22:08] talk about the flesh for a little while
[22:09] before we talk about the other amen
[22:12] and I believe it is over in in John 6 63
[22:16] says it is the spirit that quickness the
[22:19] flesh prophetth
[22:22] nothing
[22:24] amen
[22:27] Hallelujah the flash don't like that too
[22:29] much
[22:30] first you are just worthless
[22:34] wouldn't it be nice when you got born
[22:37] again when you got saved that this flesh
[22:40] also got converted
[22:43] wouldn't it have been nice but the flesh
[22:45] never did get converted did it
[22:47] amen I made this statement the other day
[22:50] about the flesh anybody remembers what I
[22:52] said
[22:54] probably said so much you can't pick out
[22:56] which one it is I said you are actually
[22:59] living in your greatest enemy's house
[23:05] you lived there
[23:07] Paul talked much about it that which I
[23:09] would that I do not and so forth they're
[23:11] not right for to will is with me
[23:14] amen that flesh brother man said it was
[23:17] the biggest enemy that you had the
[23:19] biggest enemy I had not God or the devil
[23:22] is this your flesh he said that is your
[23:24] biggest enemy
[23:27] amen
[23:29] oh my
[23:30] so we see here the first birth gives the
[23:34] Devil complete Liberty
[23:36] and it starts with and I just want to go
[23:38] down through here would that be okay
[23:39] let's take some of these in Galatians 5.
[23:43] now the first things now the works of
[23:45] the flesh are manifest which are these
[23:49] adultery
[23:52] the very first thing and the foremost
[23:56] is adultery
[23:59] let me ask you a question what was the
[24:01] original sin
[24:03] adultery
[24:05] was the original sin
[24:07] God gave adam his wife remember he built
[24:11] her and made her and gave it to Adam and
[24:13] brother bam says before he could get to
[24:15] her the devil the serpent got to her
[24:19] amen and beguiled her she spear she
[24:23] committed first of all spiritual
[24:25] fornication by believing what
[24:28] the devil said that how many knows when
[24:30] you believe what the devil tells you
[24:32] over God you're committing spiritual
[24:35] fornication
[24:38] amen
[24:39] then before that then that the natural
[24:41] Act of course we happened you know it
[24:43] was adultery amen so one of the one of
[24:47] the one of the strongest forces in the
[24:49] world is the world of adultery and so
[24:52] forth I believe the Bible said that a
[24:54] wicked and adulterous generation seeks
[24:56] after the sign and their man said that
[24:58] he was talking about this generation
[25:00] wasn't he I mean he knows remember that
[25:03] he said he was talking about this
[25:05] generation Domino that's the world we're
[25:07] living in oh my it's terrible
[25:11] it's such an adulterous generation until
[25:14] the prophet of God said that women were
[25:17] becoming so common the women didn't even
[25:19] want them anymore
[25:21] and they become homosexuals
[25:24] that's pretty low isn't it
[25:28] that is real low
[25:31] and of course we know I mean you think
[25:34] about it you know and Jesus says you
[25:36] know you ain't got to go out there amen
[25:39] you ain't got to go out there and commit
[25:41] adultery with the woman to commit
[25:43] adultery with a woman
[25:48] how many knows that
[25:50] a woman can be as pure to her husband as
[25:54] she can possibly be but when she goes
[25:57] out there and dresses in an immoral way
[26:00] and causes a man to lust after her
[26:02] brother bam said on the day of judgment
[26:04] she would answer for committing adultery
[26:07] with the men that looked at her and
[26:09] lusted after her
[26:13] can you
[26:15] wow
[26:16] huh
[26:18] never unfaithful to her husband never
[26:20] unfaithful to her a boyfriend
[26:22] amen
[26:25] amen the disc goes this should go
[26:27] everywhere amen and any man that looks
[26:30] upon a woman now how many knows and and
[26:32] you talk about the things that are out
[26:34] there and and so forth it's terrible
[26:36] isn't it
[26:38] you better you better have the second
[26:41] nature
[26:43] you better have the second nature it is
[26:46] the power of the Sun and Lord I will
[26:49] give you the power to be able to turn
[26:51] your heads nowadays because for a man
[26:53] brother bam says the way to the Dress he
[26:55] almost can't blame a man
[26:58] for ravishing women
[27:01] did he say it or not he said you almost
[27:04] can't you almost
[27:08] why because if he ain't born again if he
[27:11] don't have that power and that woman
[27:12] advertises herself getting a little
[27:14] plain tonight amen that all mine does
[27:17] the way to shoot and act the way that
[27:19] she does y'all remember the story of of
[27:22] uh the man that had his daughter out of
[27:24] gas station she was totally dressed
[27:26] immoral and so forth and somebody
[27:28] whistled at her and the dad got all mad
[27:30] wanted to whoop him
[27:34] better bam says that man don't need a
[27:36] whooping the dad needed a whooping for
[27:39] allowing his daughter to go out there in
[27:40] their first place
[27:43] amen
[27:45] so we're living in a very very
[27:46] adulterous generation
[27:49] and they said that they would seek after
[27:51] a sign
[27:52] and there would be no sign given to it
[27:54] but the sign of Jonah the prophet
[27:58] what was the sign of Jonah the prophet
[28:00] brother bam said it was the sign of the
[28:01] Resurrection
[28:03] he was in the belly of the whale for
[28:04] three days so to speak dead and come
[28:07] forth again amen he was assigned to the
[28:10] resurrection this generation was given
[28:11] to sign of the resurrected Jesus Christ
[28:14] they got their signs
[28:16] amen
[28:18] so that's the first thing brother bam
[28:20] also said one place he says you know all
[28:21] the beard joints and the liquor and
[28:23] everything else he says it'll never send
[28:25] as many souls to hell as an immoral
[28:28] dress woman
[28:30] the immoral dress woman sends more souls
[28:32] to Hell than all of the beer joints why
[28:34] because it's a powerful thing amen I
[28:37] know it's very very
[28:39] powerful tool in the hands of the devil
[28:44] so that's the first thing he mentions
[28:46] that's the flesh if you ain't got the
[28:48] Holy Ghost amen you won't have the power
[28:52] to resist hardly amen
[28:54] with the internet and everything that's
[28:56] going on just remember this
[28:59] when you look at a woman to lust after
[29:01] her in your heart you're guilty
[29:03] huh of cheating on your wife
[29:07] huh you look at the wrong your justice
[29:09] of committing adultery with her
[29:12] Lord help us hello
[29:14] we need the spirit amen need that second
[29:18] nature amen that's your first it's just
[29:21] a natural thing amen
[29:23] that's right but it's sinful
[29:26] right
[29:27] adultery fornication we're brother bam
[29:30] says fornication is unclean living
[29:34] amen
[29:35] same act as an adult or married person
[29:38] just not married yet
[29:40] it's fornication I mean remembers that
[29:43] amen and certainly have that going on
[29:45] today don't we look at the open door
[29:47] there's even brother bam said look at
[29:50] your schools hardly any of them you
[29:51] can't find a school uh school girl
[29:53] Harley that's a virgin anymore coming
[29:55] out of schools
[29:57] amen somebody wants a virgin you've got
[29:59] to find some country country church
[30:01] somewhere somewhere where they really
[30:03] kept a close eye on their daughters
[30:05] like strict hand on them amen why so
[30:08] easy I mean no it's very easy he meant
[30:11] to slip to slide amen and amen and
[30:14] fornication is on the ram page Amen on
[30:18] the Rampage

[30:22] one is uncleanness amen how many knows

[32:21] think that we are idle worshipers but we
[32:24] are and the government endorses people

[38:59] it'll show
[39:01] aren't you glad that we've got God to

[39:08] hatred you need to get that out of there
[39:11] hatred so that's one of the fruits of
[39:14] our nature

[39:18] nature

[39:47] of being different Divergent
[39:50] inconsistent the state or fact of
[39:53] disagreeing or quarreling

[40:17] that's with Darkness how many knows
[40:20] light is very
[40:21] variant from Darkness

[40:26] difference between your wife your
[40:28] husband your mom your dad anybody that
[40:31] doesn't believe the truth there's gonna
[40:33] be variance there

[40:41] and divorce and amen and we got to
[40:43] talking about whether a man can remarry

[40:46] says Ah Jesus said accept
[40:49] it'd be for fornication
[40:52] yeah I know but none of you she's
[40:54] better not to do and I says well you
[40:55] know we was there at the table with
[40:57] everybody I wasn't going to have a big
[40:58] fuss we just have to agree to disagree
[41:00] but that you know I I said you know
[41:02] there was except when there's an accept
[41:05] in there that means there is an
[41:07] exception
[41:09] except there's an exception amen aren't
[41:12] you glad that Prophet that brought us
[41:14] the truth
[41:15] amen of all the people that were married
[41:18] and two or three times amen I remember
[41:21] brother Alan sister and I think when
[41:22] they first come to church to not preach
[41:24] on marriage and divorce and I said man
[41:25] if you're in this shape man you're lost
[41:27] and all these other stuff but at the end
[41:29] I could brought it in whoever the
[41:31] prophet of God says now God forgive you
[41:33] for that just don't ever do it again
[41:35] you're all messed up the churches don't
[41:38] know for sure what the truth was and
[41:39] this Saturday and I got all messed up

[42:00] it was talking about variance

[42:05] Paul
[42:08] variance is is to have an argument to
[42:10] have these differences right or Paul
[42:13] talked about I I can't hardly believe it
[42:16] but I hear there is divisions among you
[42:19] how many knows what if it causes
[42:21] divisions
[42:22] people that are variants that have uh
[42:24] you know that are disagreement or one
[42:26] wants it this way one wants it that way
[42:28] and so forth and you have parents you
[42:30] but in the house how many know that
[42:31] we're not supposed to have variants
[42:33] amongst believers
[42:36] Paul said that you'd be of the same mind
[42:38] of the same thought with the same goal
[42:41] One Faith one Lord one baptism all
[42:43] positions are it's the same goal
[42:46] we don't need somebody in the front of
[42:48] the car pushing it backwards and two
[42:50] people on the front back are pushing it
[42:52] Forward you're not gonna get very far we
[42:55] all got to push it the same direction I

[48:59] um
[49:01] heresy means a belief or opinion
[49:04] contrary to Orthodox religion amen
[49:09] especially Christian doctrine amen so I
[49:13] like that an opinion that's contrary to
[49:16] what we call the truth
[49:21] how much heresy do we have going on out
[49:24] there
[49:25] amen even around the ranks of the
[49:27] message anything that doesn't stay with
[49:29] what the prophet said it's heresy
[49:32] heresy something contrary
[49:35] to the religious Orthodox Doctrine or
[49:38] the real truth anything contrary to that
[49:40] real truth amen
[49:42] and you know they did call Paul they say
[49:45] that he was a heretic because he was
[49:47] preaching the gospel in Jesus Christ
[49:49] contract to what they thought was right
[49:52] amen but Paul said the way after the way
[49:55] that they call heresy they call it they
[49:58] made a terracy to them
[50:00] I said why do they call her and she's so
[50:01] worthy by the god of my fathers amen
[50:06] that's right we're a heretic to all
[50:08] untruth
[50:11] Amen to their Doctrine their original
[50:13] Doctrine we're here at ticks but the
[50:16] true heretic is somebody that goes
[50:18] contrary to the Bible amen heresies
[50:22] and the yings
[50:24] amen
[50:27] I just thought about this verse when
[50:29] I've come across that did not mean to do
[50:31] it but here it is verse 26 the last
[50:33] verse of the chapter says let us not be
[50:35] desirous of vain Glory provoking one
[50:39] another ending one another or being
[50:42] jealous
[50:43] amen
[50:47] amen
[50:49] let's hear it if I can
[50:51] um
[50:52] Envy means the feeling of discontented
[50:55] or resentful longing aroused by someone
[50:59] else's possessions or qualities
[51:03] or being jealous of what somebody else
[51:05] has Envy is that right
[51:09] green with is it Green Envy or is it
[51:12] green jealousy

[51:22] Envy don't and how many knows man you

[51:40] little jig for him glory I'm happy for

[51:51] say Ford Chevy you're really getting a
[51:53] lot of trouble right there
[51:55] it meant to all the way up amen
[51:58] don't envy one another provoking one
[52:00] another don't be envious but the carnal
[52:03] nature is the envy it's part of that
[52:05] carnal nature that fruit of that first
[52:07] nature amen
[52:10] murder whoa wow that's the truth isn't
[52:14] it boy
[52:16] my mama
[52:21] if we would do what we have thought we'd
[52:24] all be murderers wouldn't we
[52:27] well I hope you don't have to raise your
[52:29] hand but if you actually manifest it
[52:32] would have happened the way that you
[52:33] thought you'd be a murderer
[52:37] because let's be honest our first Nature
[52:39] has murder in it it's in the DNA of our
[52:43] first nature is to murder people
[52:46] amen why do you think it's out there
[52:49] like it is didn't I tell you there's an
[52:51] open door for the devil and being Strife
[52:55] you see our divided nation you see this
[52:58] Strife between the right the left
[53:00] Democrats and Republicans
[53:04] oh my The Strife amongst the world and
[53:07] the Bible says there'll be Strife Wars
[53:09] and all of these things
[53:12] amongst the Nations amongst the people
[53:13] among everybody amen except the bride
[53:18] let there be no Strife Among Us amen
[53:22] let's not strife
[53:24] amen
[53:26] praise the Lord
[53:32] amen
[53:34] murders drunkenness
[53:38] revelings
[53:40] and such like of the which I tell you
[53:44] before as I have also told you in times
[53:47] past that they would do such things
[53:49] shall not inherit the kingdom of God
[53:53] amen
[53:56] praise be to God
[53:59] amen
[54:06] in Corinthians let me see here
[54:11] First Corinthians 9.
[54:14] First Corinthians 9 I believe it is
[54:17] let me see if this is the one I'm
[54:18] looking for yeah 9 and 27.
[54:23] now we have come to the conclusion of
[54:26] the first nature Nate first nature
[54:29] and you know as Paul said that this
[54:31] first nature is of all is always right
[54:34] their bias trying to resurrect how many
[54:37] believes that that nature has to be
[54:39] brought into subjection
[54:42] amen it has to be brought into
[54:44] subjection I thought about Paul when he
[54:46] said when he was talking about running a
[54:48] race in chapter 9 of First Corinthians
[54:51] he says no ye not the day which run all
[54:53] run in a race all but one receiveth to
[54:55] buy so run that you may obtain for every
[54:58] man that striveth for the Mastery is
[55:00] tempered in all things now they do it to
[55:02] obtain the corruptable crown but we had
[55:04] Incorruptible dad therefore I therefore
[55:07] so run not as uncertainly so if I die
[55:10] not as one that beat a fear but I keep
[55:13] under my body and bring it into
[55:17] subjection
[55:21] oh my brother bam says when your body is
[55:23] coming subject to the word coming
[55:25] obedient to the word it shows that there
[55:27] is a resurrection for you
[55:30] because one of these days his body's
[55:31] gonna come so subject amen Until It's
[55:34] Gonna Change in the very Adams
[55:38] how many beliefs we're going to do a
[55:39] disappearing act one of these days
[55:42] I'm gonna do a disappearing act
[55:45] and I thought this back here I thought
[55:47] this fellow I was back in the office I
[55:48] said we're all running the race
[55:51] huh
[55:52] all the message churches around were all
[55:55] running a race
[55:56] my question is who's going to win
[56:00] who's going to win
[56:01] because that body change is the win
[56:06] who's going to go in that Rapture is the
[56:08] big question
[56:09] isn't that right
[56:11] and I like what Paul said there I'll
[56:12] tell you what you're not going to go
[56:13] until you got this under control
[56:16] this has to come into subjection it
[56:19] brings this body into subjection
[56:21] praise be to God aren't you glad that
[56:24] there's something that brings it under
[56:26] control
[56:28] because out there it's out of control
[56:30] but the end
[56:32] in control
[56:34] Amen Let me hurry up through here just a
[56:37] little bit
[56:38] amen
[56:39] Paul said much about this about this
[56:43] battle that you and I are in
[56:45] amen
[56:48] I don't like
[56:49] too much we're not here to preach my
[56:52] thought
[56:54] amen
[56:55] the only time I'm going to give me my
[56:57] thought is
[56:58] one I'm going to let you know it's my
[56:59] thoughts
[57:01] is that right is that okay even brother
[57:03] Brandon would say now this is me
[57:05] amen but remember in the age just
[57:08] previous he says I will keep you from
[57:10] the hour of Temptation
[57:12] I wonder if we ain't in the hour of
[57:15] Temptation
[57:16] the hour of trying being tried being
[57:20] tempted to the fullest amen
[57:24] amen he meant something bad but I'll
[57:26] tell you this we are certainly in an
[57:28] hour of trying and you have to keep
[57:30] under my body you got to keep it in
[57:32] control and bring it into subjection at
[57:35] least that by any means when I have
[57:37] preached to others I myself should be a
[57:41] Castaway
[57:42] praise be to God we can't quit tonight
[57:46] without finishing our thought on the
[57:48] other side of this is that okay
[57:49] y'all got plenty of time
[57:53] praise the Lord I think uh Jonathan went
[57:55] to one close to one Sunday didn't he man
[57:59] so if we go to nine that'll be about
[58:02] balancing things out
[58:05] fruit of the spirit next praise be to
[58:09] God
[58:10] amen let's look at this first I want to
[58:13] look at another one amen and that is
[58:15] what Jesus said about fruit you want to
[58:18] hear what Jesus said about fruit and
[58:20] bearing fruit Jesus said in John 15 he
[58:23] says I am the vine my father is the
[58:26] husbandman every branch and me that
[58:28] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[58:31] every Bear Branch that bear fruit he
[58:33] purges it that it might break forth more
[58:35] fruit
[58:37] oh my remember my message tonight is
[58:40] bearing more fruit
[58:41] amen not this other food we don't need
[58:45] none of this other
[58:57] I'm going to say it before
[58:59] I forget if I possibly can
[59:05] let me see where it is three
[59:08] I mean before I forget if I I can do it
[59:13] um
[59:18] what you sow you will reap that would be
[59:21] James
[59:23] okay James
[59:26] let me see
[59:37] all right
[59:43] nope I can't remember where it is
[59:47] but it talks about how he said that uh
[59:51] what you sow
[59:53] you shall reap how many believe that
[59:56] and when you sow to these things
[59:58] especially the carnal flesh he that
[1:00:01] soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh
[1:00:03] reap corruption
[1:00:06] and he that soweth to the spirit shall
[1:00:08] receive your life amen
[1:00:10] so these things they were talking about
[1:00:11] this fruit of our nature each and every
[1:00:13] one of them
[1:00:14] amen there's a it's like a seed that we
[1:00:17] sow amen and it produces fruit isn't
[1:00:21] that right so we got to be careful of
[1:00:22] what we plan back to our thoughts Saint
[1:00:24] John 15 back to what we were reading
[1:00:26] purges it that may bring forth more
[1:00:28] fruit now you are expensive the word
[1:00:31] which I have spoken unto you abide in me
[1:00:33] and I and you accept the branch cannot
[1:00:34] bear fruit of itself except it abide in
[1:00:37] the vine no more can ye accept ye abide
[1:00:40] in me praise be to God Amen I am the
[1:00:44] vine you're the branches he didn't abide
[1:00:47] that's been me and I in the him the same
[1:00:50] bringeth forth
[1:00:51] much fruit
[1:00:53] boy if there's just one thing in my
[1:00:57] heart tonight that I can see it and long

[1:01:40] withered and dry and just not they have
[1:01:42] a whole lot of leaves a lot the leaves

[1:01:45] whole big tree you can find about four
[1:01:47] oranges

[1:01:52] maybe that's where some of us are I hope
[1:01:54] not
[1:01:56] but just a little fruit is coming forth
[1:02:00] amen now that's not how God wants us to
[1:02:03] look does he no

[1:15:28] meek
[1:15:29] temperance
[1:15:30] self-control against such there is no
[1:15:34] law and they that our Christ have
[1:15:36] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:15:40] at lust I mean I believe that if we live
[1:15:43] in the spirit let us
[1:15:45] let us all walk in the spirit
[1:15:49] how many beliefs how many say God that's
[1:15:51] me I need to walk more in the spirit
[1:15:53] whatever I do needs to be done in the
[1:15:57] spirit
[1:15:58] Paul said it this way amen he said
[1:16:02] um for a thing verse 8 verse 5 of
[1:16:05] chapter 8 of Romans I'm saying it
[1:16:07] backwards Romans 8 and 5. all right all
[1:16:10] right for that or after the flesh to
[1:16:13] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:16:15] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:16:17] the spirit
[1:16:19] oh my
[1:16:24] God oh my
[1:16:28] the things of the spirit
[1:16:31] for to be carnally minded is death
[1:16:34] that's right I mean he knows that you
[1:16:36] let that carnal mind think and you let
[1:16:39] it run it's so contrary where you want
[1:16:42] to kill somebody now you want to try to

[1:17:05] whatever that's the kind of that's the
[1:17:07] kind of love that you're supposed to
[1:17:08] have amen how many believe that not to
[1:17:11] have carnally we're not to be carnally
[1:17:14] minded but to be spiritually minded now
[1:17:16] that is life
[1:17:18] and peace praise be to God
[1:17:22] I don't know about you but I I'm just
[1:17:24] thankful to be alive
[1:17:27] and I'm talking about a spiritual life
[1:17:29] because there's a lot of people that are
[1:17:31] dead while they live
[1:17:33] there's a lot of people to walk around
[1:17:35] with Doom and Gloom yeah
[1:17:37] they have no happiness
[1:17:40] but you
[1:17:41] you and me how many leaves we ought to

[1:18:12] tonight but I'm this is really doing me
[1:18:15] good
[1:18:16] I hope you go from this place feeling as
[1:18:18] good as I do
[1:18:20] spirit is life and peace Joy
[1:18:27] oh my I'm sure glad that you're not
[1:18:30] reading out of well this is Thomas
[1:18:32] myler's book this is what he says
[1:18:34] no no this is God's book
[1:18:37] this is absolutely the truth
[1:18:40] you can rely on it
[1:18:45] there's a lot of a lot of confusion out
[1:18:47] there people don't know what to believe
[1:18:48] what to follow
[1:18:50] what is absolute folks they don't know
[1:18:54] and you can be thankful let me tell you
[1:18:55] something we can be thankful that we
[1:18:57] have the message of the hour that we
[1:18:59] have a church like we had to do that
[1:19:00] stands on the word of God
[1:19:03] we take it for granted don't there's a
[1:19:05] lot out there that man you'd have to
[1:19:07] question you'd have to wonder
[1:19:09] huh
[1:19:12] oh my
[1:19:14] praise the Lord
[1:19:16] all right we're running into that
[1:19:17] overtime now
[1:19:23] we got to win this game we're in
[1:19:25] overtime but yeah we're going to stay we
[1:19:27] ain't gonna leave early right
[1:19:29] game
[1:19:33] but the Christian ought to be just
[1:19:34] enthusiastic about what he believes as
[1:19:36] those are out there at the ball games to
[1:19:38] read the code I was going to read hello
[1:19:40] they boy they get in the spirit don't
[1:19:42] they
[1:19:43] man they get they're at it they can
[1:19:45] bring their baseball caps they bring
[1:19:47] their but they bring their chairs they
[1:19:48] bring their drink they come prepare
[1:19:51] that's why I thought Ernie man when we
[1:19:52] come we ought to come prepared hey we're
[1:19:55] gonna get in the spirit here
[1:19:58] that's why and that's what it all
[1:20:00] happens
[1:20:01] everything Paul said if I pray I pray in
[1:20:03] the spirit amen if I uh whatever I do I
[1:20:06] do in the spirit
[1:20:07] miracles happen mother Bible says if you
[1:20:10] need prayer and then if you need healing
[1:20:11] get in the spirit that's where it's at
[1:20:14] get in the spirit
[1:20:17] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:20:18] against God it is not subject to God and
[1:20:21] not in the law of God neither in thee
[1:20:23] can be so then they that are in the
[1:20:25] flesh cannot please God but ye are not
[1:20:29] in the flesh
[1:20:34] how many ain't in the flesh
