god is good enough amen brother aaron and brother brian would you come pick up the offering this morning and brother steven would you say this tomorrow you go for a full hospital that's remember the stephen in prayer also continuing member of the daryl ward and sister cheryl and i know i'm from terry tedwell and sister vicky and all those at by the danny stevens church that have the uh coven 19 want to remember all them in prayer this morning and yes sister hannah she also requested a prayer for the nursing home the residents there we've got eight cases i guess there and so i've asked her to stay out since she's been around him so let's remember all of it okay hey man i had heard that and and you know that's just like the devil sister adriana had just posted here while back how the lord had blessed them he don't like it but i believe greater is he that's in us this morning than he that's in the world and then you know there's a lot of people have a desire this morning to come to church and they can't come so let's pray for them this morning also too amen remember brother parrish and sister parish this morning and also sister peggy smith our shut-ins this morning and like i said there's so many on vacation i'd miss somebody but remember all those that are gone this morning and if you have needle in your heart you might let it be known by that hand we're gonna ask for the brian if you pray over these knees this morning foreign amen my god is real this morning amen well there are some things oh i may not know there are some places i can't go but i am sure [Music] of this one thing that god is real for [Music] he's [Music] my god [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man you believe he's real this morning amen good to have like i said but russell in here that we're going to ask him if he'll sing for us this morning come ahead brother russell also i just noticed that's ashton right yeah i'm good i don't know her husband's name but god bless you it's good to have you all here with us this morning good morning saints sanctified ones this little song he leadeth me and hold him but it was on my heart a few months ago really quite a lot because my son had taken a study with the young people on the monarch butterfly and it's the first time i'd kind of heard a little bit about it but i didn't you all may already know all about it but it's quite striking that how god leads that little monarch butterfly and if you don't know all i can tell you really briefly here but they leave mexico in the spring in the uh spring and head to canada it's 3 000 miles and it takes them i think four generations going to canada from mexico along the way they stop and the butterfly lays eggs and then she dies off and then those eggs become caterpillars right and then they cocoon and come into the butterfly and then they continue their journey and then along the way they stop again and that happens four times i believe so now the fifth generation which is the great great grandchildren of that original butterfly are the ones that arrive in canada and then in the fall that fifth generation that great great grandchildren of that original leaves canada and goes back to mexico in one flight it's three thousand miles and goes all the way and goes back to the same they say it's the same 40 acres and oftentimes the same tree that their great great grandparent was cocooned in go back to that very same tree and there's no explanation for it and but i always i look at it like the scripture says the fool has said in his heart there's no god just that little example of that butterfly four generations later that can find its way back to the very same tree it's supernatural and that's why they say it's a mystery it's not a mystery it's supernatural it's it's just god there's no other way to explain it but then we look at it like this so this is just the animal kingdom right these are butterflies like the scripture says five sparrows fall to the ground but it's just the animal kingdom not created in god's own image but now we as sons and daughters of god created in the very image of god if god will lead that little butterfly then how much confidence can we have that god would lead us as sons and daughters with eternal life created in the image of god that he'll lead us and it's not always mountaintops and you look at king david he he didn't he was anointed he didn't god didn't take him straight to the throne if you look he was 10 years running for his life and hiding in caves and living like a dog with saul trying to kill him before he ever went to a throne but yet god was leading him amen he leadeth me what a beautiful thing to be led of god i think it's evil just try and see [Music] he leadeth me o blessed thought o words with heavenly comfort fought whatever i do wherever i be still tis god's hand that leadeth me he leadeth me leadeth me by his own hand he leadeth me his faithful followers would be for by his hand he leadeth me sometimes mid scenes of deep gloom sometimes where eden's flowers bloom by waters calm over troubled sea still tis god's hand that leadeth me he leadeth me as he leadeth me by his own hand he leadeth me and he is faithful a follower i would be for by his hand he leadeth me lord i would clasp thy hand in mine nor ever murmur nor complain content whatever lot i see since tis my god that leadeth me and when my task on earth is done when by thy grace the victories won even death's cold wave i will not flee since god through jordan leadeth me he leadeth me [Music] leadeth me by his own hand he leadeth me his faithful follower i would be for [Music] me man appreciate that song russell god bless you appreciate them being here today and appreciate sister elizabeth helping us out and playing the song service been a blessing to you and we're going to turn this with thomas this morning god bless you hey amen praise the lord stand with me this morning amen we're glad to have brother thaddeus burgess i think everybody knows his dad brother brad real well amen so he said good upbringing i don't think i've ever heard brother that he has preached before so this is the first and so we just trust that the lord will help brothers out of us just to have freedom to get out of the way that the lord will use the gift at the end amen amen so praise the lord how many is looking forward to it and how many will pull from the gift of god this morning so we want to welcome him this morning and we hope that have this been the first time of perhaps many times amen so let's welcome him out as we sing amazing grace how sweet the sound [Music] amazing grace how sweet [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] grace my fears [Music] the when we've been there ten thousand years [Applause] [Music] [Music] can you praise god this morning to see god's praise [Music] praise god praise god oh

knows his wife better than i do and i don't know that i can i can uh get all together today but uh god bless you it's good to be together this morning you can be seated for a moment um it's it's been a long time since i was down here in elkton i think it's probably been 16 years ago i don't i don't remember i know we've had different ones from the church come down i think brother william you probably know him he's ministered and sing for you brother daniel and he's probably been down this way so uh um i just want to greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ from our church back home and in louisville and i see some familiar faces god bless your brother and different ones um from my dad their brother brad pastor and uh i guess brother west uh yeah we know you you've been up you've married the daughter brother russell okay god bless you brother and um so we just we just want you to know that uh that um that we're in the battle together with you um several months ago i was actually i'm in i'm in sales i work for a company and we we sell nuts and bolts for manufacturing companies and and i had a i have a customer down here i think it's in glasgow or somewhere close to maybe close to bowling green and i was driving down from the meeting and and uh it just seemed like the lord impressed something on my heart about maybe getting in touch with a few different churches in kentucky and i thought about brother tom and i don't know all the different places i talked to brother daniel andy's he was telling me different ones and i was writing down the names and addresses and and uh some time went by against several months maybe six or so months and just couldn't get away from it just kept feeling something my heart the lord pressed me to to god bless you brother john is that right hey god bless you brother john and so i'm just pressing my heart but i needed to get in touch with uh brother tom and and i normally wouldn't do that to call somebody but i just felt in my heart that the lord wanted me to to come here and i don't believe it's it's it's a person but i believe that the lord cares as the brother was um speaking in the song service about that message he cares do you care it's just really really impressing that message on my heart last night i was praying and listening to that message on the road coming down here today he cares he cares for each and every one of us he cares for you this morning he's a real god he's the god that created the world he's the god that created the trees the streams the rivers the birds the butterflies but he's the god that created you and me the bible says he didn't come in the form of the angels he didn't come in the in the form of an animal or something like that but he came like his brothers that he could be one of us that he could go through the things that we go through he could go through the trials and the temptations and the hardships of life that we go through that he could be a faithful high priest that he could help us in this road of life so i just want to preach along those things this morning just to be that the lord would speak to you and encourage you the things that god's laid on my heart i pray that i can communicate it in a way that that it would be effective to your life this morning let's stand together i would like to read over in first corinthians chapter nine and um i don't i don't travel a lot a lot preaching normally helped my dad out at home leading the songs there brother william helps out and with the song service and we kind of work together and and minister at home but when the lord lays it in my heart i i know i have to be obedient to that and i feel i know i get in trouble if i want if i won't do that so but by god's grace we just want to make it don't we amen first corinthians chapter 9 and i want to start reading on verse 24 know ye not that they which run in the race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and everyone every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be cast away i would like to take my thought this morning run that she may obtain i want to read also in hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 2 and 3. we're foreseeing we are also we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and they set down at the right hand of the throne of god can we say these three words together for consider him can we say that for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest we be wearied and faint in our minds amen you can be seated my dad's been preaching a series he just finished back home on galatians chapter six about not not fainting and and not being weary and well doing and uh this morning the lord laid in my heart about this thought run that she may obtain and uh i haven't haven't preached anywhere else that i know of specifically this this title but i just felt it impressed in my heart to speak with you this morning about running the race that we may obtain and we sing a song that says uh many have started in the race but with the light refused to keep pace others accepted it because it was new but not very many expect to go through but i'm going through i'm going through how many feel that way this morning you say many have started the race but i am determined to go through that paul said for we know in whom we have believed and we are persuaded that he is able to keep that which we've committed to him against that day for we know who we have believed and here in hebrews 12 1 he said consider him consider jesus christ the one who has gone before us our elder brother amen we know who we have put our trust in we know who we believed in and i might refer to several scriptures or a few things in the message of brother branham this morning and uh i just want to kind of i don't want to get going too fast i want to go kind of a little bit slower if i can to get started and then we see how the lord leads but here we read here he said let us run with patience and i've been thinking on that late in the last several months about weeks and even running with patience what does he mean to run with patience you know and uh i i looked up this word what about patience and and what he's saying is to run with as an endurance that's not this race there's different types of racism when i was young i used to run a a mile race and it was about how fast could you run a mile and it was more of a sprint type race but this race of life that we're in it's the race to to to the rapture and the race to see jesus it's a race that it's an endurance race it's something that you're in for the long run it's not you get up one day in one month and then and then you just you put everything into it and then you fall by the wayside and you're right you're out of breath and and you can't catch your breath and you fall down it's like lord you know i got started good but then i've lost track no it's it's an endurance race it's something that it's every day like brother brown said it's an everyday rugged life living for god in the message man run from the prince lord remember he talked about responsibilities and he said christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god every day getting up sometimes you don't feel like getting up out of bed every how many ever feel that way sometimes you don't feel like getting out of bed you know but sometimes you don't feel like going to work you don't feel like taking care of your kids or taking care of the farm or whatever you got to do sometimes you just don't feel like it you feel weary in your body you feel weary in your mind and your spirit and you go through trials and you go through troubles in life and it and it puts pressure on you and you just sometimes you feel like giving up but we have to keep our eyes on jesus because the bible teaches us that he endured all things like a man he was tempted in every way that we are tempted he was tempted with giving up he was tempted at the guard and he said father that not my will the lord if it could be possible may i not have to go through this life he didn't want to go through it he didn't want to go through those things and brother branham he came through these trials in his life where we felt like lord if i could just if you just take my life but god wouldn't allow it to be i think of elijah after he had gone through a great victory on mount carmel and then he was he was running from the lord and running into a place of hiding and he said lord just take my life how many have ever felt like that lord and you don't have to be afraid to say just open confessions lord sometimes i feel like i wish i wasn't alive but that's a natural p that's the next this whole natural body but but we serve a god that is supernatural and we need supernatural strength to make it through this hour we need the reality the power of god we it's a god that they they can change the situation a god that that opened the red sea the god that that brought the pillar of fire into the lion's den the god that appeared in the in the when the hebrews and the fourth man we need that in our life we need prayer in our life we need consecration to a supernatural god amen we're living in dark trying evil times and we need the lord to make himself real to us the bible teaches us in the book of ezekiel he said i'll be your god that's a personal god brother sister we need that personal god like the brother sing the song lord lead me he said the holy spirit would be a guide he would be a leader he would be somebody that could lead us and guide us he said i'll go away i'll send the comforter john chapter 14 15 16 you read it he said i'll be a comforter to you i'll be a guide to you i'll bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've commanded you we need that hallelujah lord bring to my remembrance bring to my remembrance the things that you have done for me the testimonies that god has done for us oh i'm all over the place but in the book of psalms david said lord he said i'll turn my feet to thy testimonies he said i'll turn my feet to that testimonies that's what we need sometimes saying to god when we get down for prayer it's so easy to say lord please help me with this please help me with that but when you begin to turn your feet your eyes your direction to the testimonies of god and look back and say lord god you did this for me and you did this for me and you did this for me and you come to a place like david did in psalm 124 he said if it had not been for the lord it was on my side he said then the enemies would have come and overtaken me but if it had not been forgotten it was on my side where would i be saints of god we could say that this morning if it wasn't for god brother that picked you up in your lowest place then the devil would have overtaken your life but you're here this morning because god the bible says god is for me the bible says in the book of psalms he had given commandment to save me he said you're my rod and your staff they comfort me hallelujah he said you prepare a table for me when there's nothing to eat lord god prepares a table for you in the presence of your enemies he said i'll anoint your head with oil he said your couple run over and the greatest party said surely surely how many can sit with me surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life and you'll dwell in the house of the lord forever oh praise be to god can you say thank you lord this morning if it had not been to the lord brother rand preaching a message god rich and mercy he said what if it had not been for the mercy of god what if it had not been for god oh we could say thank the lord this morning and when you turn your feet to the testimonies of god and you see you look back and you see god you did that and that was supernatural god you did that and that was supernatural hallelujah this is how joshua and caleb felt when they came up to the jordan river and they looked back and they had been traveling there with the children of israel 40 years in the wilderness and people complaining and people falling away and you had core and data and you had different ones that they they began to doubt and they began to to be afraid and they began to spread these things throughout the camp oh what a day of fear that we live in everywhere you walk there's just fear all around you said you look at your fellow americans you would have thought how could it be that americans would be in such fear in such terror and would just bend down their knee to anything everybody tells them put a mask on do this do that god forgive us there is a virus we know that but but but there's we're not given a spirit of fear but yet we live in this time the bible teaches us that in the last days men's hearts are failing them for fear and because iniquity abounded the love of many wax cold but oh my if we could just keep our eyes on the christ keep our eyes on the testimonies of god and look to what god has done for us then we can see like joshua and caleb now they look back and they could say look he's brought us through the red sea he did the mighty miracles he did all these things and when god spoke to joshua what did he say he said joshua he said moses my servant is dead in joshua chapter one he said but be thou strong and very courageous for the lord god is with you wheresoever you go oh my that's all we need to hear god speak to us this morning brother sister be strong and be very courageous for god is with you for he has said i will never leave thee and never forsake thee hebrews chapter 13 that you may boldly say the lord is my helper hallelujah can you say that this morning lord you're my helper this morning you're my high priest this morning you're the friend that's that's been called along to help me hallelujah we need that oh what a friend we have in jesus this song says oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to god in prayer oh my that's the place where god takes your burdens at calvary we must meet him in calvary every day and say lord i cast my burdens on you today i cast my cares on you today we're carrying so many weights and burdens and cares because we willingly do this we should play them at the feet of jesus and say lord you were tempted like i was tempted today father you were tempted to give up father you were tempted with depression he went through sicknesses he he took on him the iniquity of us all oh that's when we know to do good and we're honoring we don't do it oh he he carried those iniquities he carried those sorrows he carried everything for us hallelujah saints of god he was manifested in this last day the bible says for us peter said he was manifested for us hallelujah god was made flesh for me and you hallelujah i don't know but i choose to believe it i choose to believe that i was in god's mind before the world was ever made the bible said in revelation that he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world open your bible to isaiah 53 and read the bible says i don't know a whole lot about english but i know when it says he was wounded that's a past tense word he was wounded for our transgressions in god's mind here's the prophet isaiah hundreds of thousands years before christ ever came and is saying that he was already wounded for our transgressions he was already bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him because in god's mind he was a lamb already slain a sacrifice away brother away already prepared for you to make it through this evil time god's already made the way god's already prepared the way god's already made a way of escape that you can be able to bear it he said i won't put you on put on you anything more than you can bear but with the temptation he will make a way of escape oh we must look to god we must pray to him we must look to christ for the answer we sing the song christ is the answer for all i need christ is the answer he's the savior baptizer hallelujah he's everything we have need of oh praise god so they look back they're saying god you brought us through these many temptations in the wilderness you brought us through the red sea brought us through all these things and now here we are and god speak to joshua and he said joshua as i was with moses so will i be with you and as i was with the prophet brother branham so will i be with you you tell me what kind of god can have the brother quote that message he cared do you care and have me listen to it on the road coming down here this morning that's a supernatural god that's not just a god of brother branham 50 60 years ago preaching that sermon but that's a god here this morning who cares about you and me he cares about every one of us hallelujah brother sister from the youngest to the oldest i was listening to a message here yesterday and brother brown talk about the little dog a one dog hi two dogs long hell no i mean know that story right got ran over by the old mobile car he said well we just take it and put it to sleep somebody said take it to the vet you know and put it to sleep he said don't do that just wait a minute he got everybody away he went and prayed for the little dog he said it followed him up on the porch i said elias my little son he's three years old i said i want you to hear this story god cares about a little dog if god cares about a little dog god cares about you and me the bible said that he each cares about the spell he said about the lilies of the field they don't toil they'll spend but yet your heavenly father careth about every one of them how much more does he care about you this morning hallelujah oh god cares he understands in the book of psalms 139 the bible says that he knows our downsetting and he knows our uprising he understandeth hallelujah my bible says thou understandeth my thought afar off oh we sing a song back home hide thou me o rock of ages hide thou me when life's dark veil i wonder far far from thee then i cry o rock of ages hide thou me the bible says when the righteous cry the lord heareth and delivereth him out of all of his troubles do you believe it this morning that when you cry out to god it doesn't matter if you're possessed of a demon spirit because there was a man that was possessed by a demon spirit one day and god said i gotta go over this this this waterway i gotta go find that man and there was a man crying out in the tombs he was crying what he was bound and chased but crying out to god and the bible says if the righteous cry the lord heareth and delivereth and out of all their troubles are you willing to cry out it's not necessarily yes with your voice you cry you speak but with your heart the heart also cries the bible says that the lord is nine to them that are of a broken savior such as be of a contrite spirit oh that's the problem today we get so lifted up in pride that we think we can do it we think we can make it but the song says that i can't even walk without him holding my hand jesus said in john chapter 15 he said without me you can do nothing without him we can do nothing hallelujah oh we need god don't we we need to look to him hallelujah i have a source of strength when i am weak brother sister do you know what that source is look to the hill whence cometh your help david said my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth look to calvary this morning look to the place where he said he is finished where he said it's all finished for you today hallelujah i want to keep my eyes focused on the one who has the keys who has the keys who has the keys of death hell in the grave [Music] my mother-in-law she's from new zealand and my wife comes from new zealand and she was telling us a testimony the other day they were down at the beach in new zealand and uh they were with my sister-in-law and they were getting ready to leave and they had the keys to the car and they'd been running up and down the beach with the kids and and the keys that they lost the keys they couldn't find them anywhere and they went all up and down that beach can you imagine being at a beach and the keys they were just running all up and down the beach with the kids and the keys were anywhere in the sand trillions and trillions of particles of fine sand where are the keys she prayed she believed that god could do something that god could show her where the keys were she said she started walking she went over to the place and she just she just pushed her foot like that and exposed the keys underneath the sand underneath the sand buried but let me tell you friends that god knows where we are god knows exactly where we are he came in this day to show us to tell us that he knows our name he knows our address he knows our condition he knows the very thought and the intents of our heart the very thought and the very intent of your heart before you think the god he knows the intent of your heart hallelujah i was listening to a message recently brother brandon told the brother he said think something and then and then i let god reveal what he thought and he thought something that god revealed what he thought god knows god cares god understands he knows you're down sitting he knows your uprising hallelujah oh my david said if i take the wings of the morning if i go to the the sea he said even there shall they hand lead me he said my substance was not hid from thee jeremiah he said before i formed you in the belly i knew you brother do you believe that this morning that god knew you in your mother's belly he knew you that as david said i was conceived in sin i was born in sin hallelujah lord help us he told joshua be strong of good courage that's what we need to hear this morning we're in race now we've got to look at the race and say what part of the race are we in there's been seven church ages that's come all the way down now that we're now we're at the end of the race brother sister this is the end of the race this is the last mile this is the last little bit of the race we see all these things happening we see everything happening in the world and brother i don't know if we've ever had something like this that's gone completely over the entire world everybody stay at home everybody turn off non-essential all over the world i got a friend off the coast of africa i got friends in new zealand we got friends all over the world that everywhere and every part of the earth this is been affected by such a thing what is it brother brown said that god's nature is to always warn man before judgment message warning and judgment to warn a nation before judgment and so forth he always gives his warning and notice this he said he always gives his warning a reminder to we of a responsibility the warning that god has given is a reminder of a responsibility to god's people he said we are responsible and god has put us here on the earth for a reason and that reason that he has put us here for and we are responsible to him for that reason now that comes down to each and every one of us this morning that god has put us on earth for a reason and the warning the warning that we've had this morning called coughing or whatever it is called that god has created and allowed this warning to go over the whole world and what is it the prophet said the warning is a reminder to us of a responsibility that god puts you on this earth for hallelujah he said and you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do hallelujah and then if our life is on earth here then we should go to the one who put us here lord what would you have me to do what must i do why am i here if it's a housewife a dishwasher whatever god wants you to do then you do it the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little you must do it we sing a song little as much little that a righteous man hath it it's greater than the treasures of many wicked friends we live in an hour where the devil's putting all all force is on us amen trying to get people sidetracked to go here to go there why because we're at the end of the race it can simply get somebody to divert their attention this way or that way brothers many of you go hunting the lord made a little thought in my heart you know you go out hunting you'll find your tree stand you're gonna shoot a big buck or something you get up early in the morning you walk to your trees and you get up in the tree and you before daylight you can't even can't even see anything about the tongue right yo you can just hear it and your senses are so height you can hear every little sound in the woods you can hear the crackles of the of the as the sun begins to rise you can you can hear the crack of the leaves where the frost begin to defrost you can hear every little bird you can hear every little thing oh my but what if you're sitting there and and you hear the sound you know it's like you just hear some of the rustle in the leaves you say oh my that's a deer i gotta go get you climb down the tree stand you run over to the rock and you turn it over in you you find the acorn oh just a squirrel run back into the tree stand next little sound run over here run over there you're not gonna catch anything you're not gonna get anything right because you're just going after a little every little thing and that's the way the devil tries to do us especially in this last day he says he's trying to catch us here catch us there every little thing trouble in the home trouble in the church trouble on the job trouble everywhere the devil's trying to catch us somewhere the bible says first peter he said he said you're not saved by silver and gold but by the precious blood of christ hallelujah saints of god there's nothing in this world that can redeem us but there's one thing and that's the precious blood of jesus christ for as much first peter chapter 1 verse 18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold and from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemishes without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you amen brother sister there's no job that can redeem us there's no promotion there's no demotion there's nothing paul said there is neither height nor depth nor any other creature that can separate you from the love of god jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me that's what we need we need to lift up christ he was already lifted up on calvary and the bible says that we must always bear in our body the dying of the lord jesus for i am crucified with christ that not i not i but christ who live within me by whom though the world is crucified unto me and i am crucified unto the world paul said i died daily all saints that's what we need because every day now every day now that with this time that we live in this last moment of the race the devil's trying to throw everything he can every roadblock could trip you up every little thing it may be some sickness trying to keep you out of church whatever it is stay with the word of god prophet said in christ revealing his own word he said stay with the word stay stable put the stabilizer on your ship because we're we're seeing great big clouds around us we're seeing communism the prophet told us that uniting time and sign communism it's uniting what is it's the spirits of this world the spirits of politics the spirits of of the finance and everything they're all uniting what is a united oh my spoke about world council of churches you know we have a council of churches in the state of kentucky and they've they have they have gotten together with the governor of the state and they've talked about what they're going to do everything he spoke about it's true everything brother brahm taught us is true he said in this message warning then judgment when god warned he doesn't always strike when he warned he said a prophet lifted real high he said he sees real far off he sees what's coming down the road and now we see it now we're living in the fulfillment these messages is more up to date than reading our own news this is it right here saints of god god has sent us a prophet he sent us a vindicated word of god for this day hallelujah he said the warning is a reminder of irresponsibility that god has put each and every one of us here for responsibility it doesn't matter if you're single it doesn't matter if you're married it doesn't matter if you're young it doesn't matter if you're old it doesn't matter if you're living if you're breathing and you're hearing the sound and the voice of god and trying to follow god god as you're here for a purpose god had pharaoh for a purpose and he fulfilled his purpose god has a president for a purpose he's fulfilling his purpose everybody they're all recognizing their position brother brown said that that russia is recognizing its position and this country's recognizing but what about god's people recognizing their position brother baron said recognize they failed to recognize the awakening of the bride of christ why because he said i'll send a shout the shout is a message it's a message to get ready because the bridegroom is coming jesus said in luke 21 he said well you see all these things come begin to come to pass what'd he say he said look up lift up your fence for your redemption is coming down here it comes and first he sent a shout what we should be so in tune with the word of god in this day that our hearts are being united psalms 86 lord unite my heart to fear thy name what does he take a young man getting ready to get married some of you recently maybe been getting getting married and you know what it's like but when you're getting down to that final stage and you're about to go to that wedding day there's nothing else on your mind that's all you think about that's all you care about i've been married four years now but i understand that i've been through that now but you understand brother sister you've been married that's all you think about and what is it we're about to to to be at a wedding supper there'll be a wedding supper in the sky i'll be at home with jesus by and by oh praise god that's where we're going sings we our hearts must be uniting with his word this is god's letter to us this is god's word to us amen we got we get messages in many forms these days we get emails we get text messages we get voicemails but here it is right here god's letter to you and me says of god we ought to be more in the bible than ever before we ought to be hearing the vindicated word of god ever before more in this time we're at the end of the race if you're going to run this race and you're at the end if there's ever going to be a moment for you to catch up if there's ever going to be a moment for you to make up for lost time if there's ever going to be a moment you have this day the bible says this is the day that the lord hath made paul preached he was about to go off about to go off the earth in second timothy chapter four he told timothy he said timothy he said look i've finished my course i've written my race he said but timothy be instant in season out of the season what does the word insane means preach he said preach the word be incidencies and incident means don't lose your sense of urgency don't lose your urgency saints of god we're done at the end we're at the last mile hallelujah when you get to that last mile that last lap of the race there's a reaction in the body there's a chemical called epinephrine it's called adrenaline how many have you ever heard of it many people when they get in urgent situations they're able to lift vehicles off of off of crushed bodies and they're able to do all kinds of things why because this chemical that's released in their body what does it do it shuts down all non-essential functions and drives the blood flow to the essential muscles and and the essential awareness of the body so your keen eyesight you may not have your peripheral but you got your you can see you can see straight you may not have uh all different non-essentials but but you got more blood flow to those core muscle groups why because you're at the you're in a sense you're in a place of urgency that's what we need we need to lay aside every way brother sister we need to lay aside every weight every trouble everything that would weight you down in this last mile it's paul said lay aside every weight think about what this colbit has done stay at home stay at home there's never been a time that we could ever remember we can search through history books that they said stay at home but all over the world but all over the world what did god tell hezekiah he said hezekiah set your house in order set your house in order what does it mean stay at home maybe set your house in order oh if we can't see that the blind man could hit that ball out of the park as the brother said stay at home i mean set your house in order if there was ever a time that we should be setting our house in orders now but lebron said i'm gonna let i'm gonna take the church to a higher place in 1963 breaks the token he said the tokeny sigmund kicked the trash out if there's ever a time to set the house in order now is the day brother sister if there's ever a time for you to lay aside the non-essential things that have taken your time the bible's in the book of ephesians redeem redeem it means take back your time can you say that with me this morning take back the time for the days are evil hallelujah [Music] set your house in order for the coming of the lord hallelujah oh my we ought to be setting our house in order he said lay aside every weight i prepared a little illustration for you this morning i remember the very first sermon the lord inspired my heart to preach i was 19 years old used to cut grass out neighborhood and i was out cutting grass one day and this scripture kept coming to me over and over again hebrews 12 1 lay aside every wave lay aside every way how many remember the story of elijah when he went to elisha and he threw the mental on him didn't say anything just put the mantle on him right but then elijah he went back and he burned the ox he burned the card he burned it all and he followed he just laid it aside he just laid it aside peter and andrew they were down by the by the sea one day fishing and jesus came by and said follow me the bible said and immediately they left their nets immediately they left their nets and jesus said in the book of i believe it's in matthew chapter 16 he said if you're going to follow me he said you got to take up your cross and follow me matthew chapter 16. he says here if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up the cross and follow me brother sister there is no other way there is no other way we don't have to be emotional about it we just read it say lord you said take up the cross and follow you he told nicodemus he said nicodemus he said you must be born again if you're going to enter into the kingdom of god he said you must be born again why because he goes on to explain in john 3 he said that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit he said in galatians chapter 6 what did he say if you sow to the flesh of the flesh you'll reap corruption if you sow to the spirit of the spirit you'll reap life everlasting galatians 6 how can you sow to the spirit unless you be of the spirit amen he said you must be born again you must have the spirit of christ you must have something supernatural romans 8 he said romans 8 said if if the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwelling you it will make you alive paul said that there's nothing that matters but a new creature old things passed away behold all things become new saints of god that's the problem with the church today we have too many flesh born children sitting in the pew and very few spirit born children sitting in the pew because he'd never been born again brother brown said in the message you must be born again i don't have it here this morning but he said there's an approach to this birth what is the approach john chapter 12 verse 24 jesus said accept something die it cannot live again right i mean if anybody a farmer here except that corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone in the bag on the shelf at the supermarket but if it falls into the ground and that that old corruptable thing dies around it and the seed is exposed to the power of god to the spirit to the word of god then something is quickened something comes to life hallelujah praise be to god when i was 18 years old i was laying there raised in church slept underneath the pews growing up but i remember being in the presence of god i remember being in services where where god was making the stone and speaking of one brother came he uh and another brother a preacher come and they didn't even know the man two brothers two preachers and this other man came they didn't even know him and that morning that sunday morning spoke out in tongues once spoke out in tongues the other interpreting told exactly that man's life from the top to the bottom exactly what he was doing coming against the ministry and everything else god exposed it directly we had one brother that that came and and he was living in some committed some act and and that he shouldn't have committed and his sister spoke out in tongues interpreting called out his name praise be to god one day we the angel came in a man dressed in in blue jeans and a flannel shirt came back sat in the back and listened to the whole service we played a message of brother branham he walked out we had the picture of the pillow fire he pointed at it he said is this man a prophet my dad couldn't tell he was asking a question or making a statement he tried to put money in his pocket he said where you living he said oh just here there he went out of the threshold of the door he stepped out and completely disappeared just like that we had an angel visitation i grew up under this was supernatural you have grown up seeing hearing about the supernatural power of god brother baron said the message why christ speak he said muslim good enough for moses to be taught moses had to meet the reality that light that brought the word of god to reality and unless you met god and had your own personal experience with god or not just you praying to god but god speaks back to you when god speaks back to you paul said to be known of god to know god or rather to be known of god when god knows you brother when god places his seal of circumcision upon your life then the womb is conceived and there's no room for anything else to come in brother said the womb is closed by predestination it's shut off nothing can come in hallelujah why because the bible says the holy ghost overshadowed mary and he was conceived of the holy ghost and you must be conceived of the holy ghost and that old life must die it's very simple the gospel is very simple in first corinthians 15 paul said he said i showed you the gospel where christ had died and is buried and rose again first corinthians 15 he said in another place there's no other gospel he said moreover i preach i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand we stand in this gospel praise god the gospel is the good news what we were all born and said the bible said the soul that sinneth it will die forgive me if i'm talking too fast this morning oh my i can't even have time to turn to the scriptures i trust you can catch it this one is something you can catch but it's very simple jesus died he was buried and he rose again and brother sister paul said he said you've received this gospel you stand in this gospel he said by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what i have preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures it was according to the scripture see that he died he was sent for a purpose he came to do what god told him to do hallelujah and that he was buried in the third and rose again the third day according to the scriptures he said this is the gospel he said keep it in memory oh we must die with him there at calvary peter said repent of death to self he said be buried you must be buried in the name of jesus christ he said for the removal of your sins and not take your name jacob what is your name oh we are deceivers we are shysters paul said what is paul what is apollos he said paul he said i'm the least of them all he says i was a pharisee i was a rascal i was this it was that oh but i am what i am by the grace the grace of almighty god for by grace are you saved through faith and and it's not of yourself it's the gift of god hallelujah saints of god we gotta remember who we have believed we gotta remember who we have believed and we gotta be persuaded that he is able hallelujah paul wrote to the hebrews he said he that cometh to god you must believe jesus said if you believe you can be passed from death unto life oh there's so much doubt there's so much unbelief in this world that we live people run to the doctor they run to their wallet they run everywhere but jesus christ why because it's rich increased with goods but one of these days there's going to come a reckoning there's coming reckoning since god we're receiving a warning now set your house in order be ready for the coming of the lord oh my it's a time to lay aside every weight as i'm mowing the grass and this this verse could come to me lay aside lay aside lay aside so i'd do this little illustration for you this morning i trust that you'll never forget it i don't know maybe something has seen it well the bottle would be all right if i go down there okay well maybe you can't see it there we tried oh okay we'll try so i have some water here i have some cups and i have some rocks and we're gonna take this water and we're just gonna pour it into this cup and you know this is like a good revival meeting you go somewhere and you feel the presence of god like you felt god here this morning and you get all filled up you get all filled up you feel really good brother you feel like you could just take a drink of that water you feel like you could give it to somebody else the next day you say brother and sister look what god done for me god does something supernatural for you all you just want to tell somebody oh my what peter when he raised that lame man from the gate what did he do the bible says he went walking and leaping and praising god i'm afraid that that's the problem these days i'm afraid the problem is we haven't seen and witnessed the supernatural of god in our life that we have no testimony but saints of god let me tell you the bible says that while you was yet a sinner christ died for you that in your lowest place is when god came to you oh you may look at the situation you may look at somebody look at your family and say oh i'm not going to talk to them anymore they've done this they've done that i'm not going to talk to them anymore but let me tell you something my god is full of compassion my god is gracious attend to mercy the bible's still in lamentation his mercies they fail not his compassions they fail not great is thy faithfulness hallelujah that in our lowest place is when god came looking for us oh jesus gave a parable one day about a shepherd he said he had a hundred sheep but one of them was lost let me tell you about this little lost lamb how many know have many ever seen little lamb my wife said there's more sheep than people in new zealand we went up to my my grandparents farm the other day and one of my nephews had these little bitty layers brother byler you know the lamb you're looking you look in the they were in the barn and they put the fence up there they said if that was a goat he'd jump over the fence and get out he said but these sheep they won't do that these sheep they huddle against the wall they're just looking for something to tell them what to do why because they're helpless there's a character of a sheep it's helpless let me tell you about us today sometime brother sister we feel helpless we feel like we lost all hope we feel like we don't know the way out we feel like we don't know what the next step is we may not know you know the doctor tell you you got cancer you might fear might strike your heart but let me tell you something brother be of good cheer oh hallelujah be a good cheer this morning for god is your helper that you may boldly say the lord is my helper i will not fear what man can do unto me david said in psalm 27 i will not fear for the lord is my light the lord is my salvation we need to turn our eyes to the testimonies to the promises of god in the message how can i overcome brother branham was teaching us how to overcome how to win the race the title of the message today is run that you might may obtain revelation 3 he said it that the reward to the overcomer brother sister there's a reward to the overcomer we've talked about many things this morning but let's set our eyes on jesus christ this morning let's put our eyes on him let's put our focus on him not on this not on that turn off the non-essential put your eyes on calvary put your eyes on the promises of god brother branson in this message overcome he talked about overcoming and standing the test he said we've received the word of promise the brother quoted it in the song service this morning the word of promise is first john chapter four verse four greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this is a word of promise for you to overcome that god is greater oh my in the message christ sinister god revealed oh my so many things that the prophet pride out on this day that would just be an encouragement to help you overcome what is he said god has a threefold purpose he said it was god above us he came down he came down to then and to be god in us he said he came in the likeness of his brethren but brother there was one more step on the book of acts he came into his people let me tell you there's a power of god that can come into you come inside of you and be greater be greater than the boss can you in the eyes be greater than this one telling you that you know job the bible says the patience of job right his wife said curse god didn't die oh what an encouragement what an encouragement right hey brother just curse god die i mean that was in the church there was somebody in the church that said hey curse god and die i don't know who god's speaking to this morning he said curse god and die he said just give up oh what a what a word of encouragement right oh my job said for i know for i know who my redeemer i know he liveth and though the skin worms destroy this body he said yeti he had such a revelation he had such a revelation for the rest of faith is the revelation what is it it's a revelation that the word of god is true christ of 2000 years ago but it's a god that's alive today hallelujah and it's a revelation that he died for you that he was buried for you oh will he prove what brother baron say will it put your name there for he was wounded for tumbler transgression he was bruised for us wallace iniquity and by his stripe brother you are healed sister you are healed he told the woman he said that you'll be healed now both the soul and body hallelujah god is able to transform your body and god is able to transform your soul god's able to transform the situation back to the illustration but you get all filled up but you know the devil brother branham said in the message overcome he said overcoming means you also have to recognize the devil you have to recognize your adversary you got to recognize that he's against you or sometimes we just laugh and all the we just make fun you know we just make fun of this or make fun of that that's the age we live in that's the age we live in the bible said that moses had respect moses had respect to the recompense of the reward we need to have respect to god in this hour forgive the rebuke but we have to respect to god that he died for you do you respect the fact that god gave up all glory and came in flesh and died for you brother do you have respect that god said i have borne your iniquities do you have respect for god that he said if you confess your sins i am faithful and just to forgive you or your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness you have respect to god that there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus do you have respect to his holy spirit just to that there's no other way for you to get in christ but to be baptized by one spirit into one body i wonder if we have respect for god i wonder if we have respect for the prophet of god do we have respect for the bible do we have respect for the church do we have respect for the gifts of god the evangelist the prophet the pastor the teacher do we have respect for god in this hour do we take time for god brother brown said if you god will take what you give him the bible says if you have opportunity do good unto those of the household of faith but we don't take the opportunity but we have the opportunity oh my we got brothers this morning that are over in china locked up in jail locked up in jail or distributing this bible you know what they didn't have any respect for paul either paul was locked up in jail he said he said this man's forsaking me and demons forsaken me and this man's forsaken me but god bless this man because he hasn't forsaken me he's not ashamed of my bonds are you ashamed of christ he said if you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you i'm not ashamed of one who hang naked on a cross and hung there and died and bled around the world first took him the sun went black the soldiers forsook him the disciples were so come everybody forsook him and very hung and he said hanging on that cross he said my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and he gave up the ghost brother abraham said he died as a man god forsook his own son his own flesh his spirit left the body oh but let me tell you something when that spirit was being torn out of that body there was something else being torn and there was a veil in the temple it said only the high priest could go back there he said only this man only once a year he can go back there you can't go back there brother sister you can't oh but my with that that day when that happened and he hung on the cross and and the rocks and the graves were opened there was a from the top of that curtain all the way to the bottom there was a great tear he said i've torn down the middle wall of partition i've torn down the sin barrier that separated you from the fellowship of god oh my this morning you may feel so far so distant from god but god has sent you a gift this morning the gift of god the holy spirit is among you this morning to prove that he's real oh you may feel out of fellowship this morning but that little lamb let me let me finish this to the what i was talking about the little lamb let's talk about the little lamb he's way over here he's in the cleft of the rock and his leg is stuck and he's pulling and he's pulling and he's bleeding he's crying out feels like there's no hope let me tell you something this shepherd the bible said my sheep know my voice and my my the shepherd knows the sheep and the shepherds sought out for that little lamb oh he was crying he was beaten but let me tell you something we said like this help was already on the way hallelujah you may feel distant from god let's get back to this illustration so here you have the cup full of water as symbolized as a human being you and me filled up with the presence and the power of god and you feel really good brother oh we've all been those meetings but let me tell you something those meetings are past we're living in a dark and evil day now and you know you wake up monday morning and there's this little rock there's this little burden right we sing a song casting all my chairs on you and it may be temptation oh you feel great other than you see something that takes your mind so far from the things of god the nakedness of this world there's never been a day let me remind you there's never been a day like this day before you said as it was yes as it was in the days of sodom but let me tell you we're seven church ages from where we're 2 000 years worth 6 000 years we're all the way at the end and brother brown told us in the feast of trump and he said there's 200 200 million demons that have been released they've been released and they're trampling everything that's called god they're tearing down statues they're tearing down every every script of god pulling it out of the courthouses they pulled it out of our of our courthouses they pulled it out of our schools and they pulled god out of the family to where there's no basis of family anymore all this we can mention the name and god for to forgive even mention the name of this group but you look at what they stand for and transgender this homosexual this nothing of the family but yet a year ago one man knelt and now everybody bows to the image what is it no respect for god no respect for the word of god but brother sister we are different we are called to run a race we are soldiers the bible paul told timothy he said no man that wareth entangleth himself with affairs of this life to please him who has called you to be a soldier oh we are called we are called we have a reminder of our purpose we are with brother brother like tom brother you're like daniel in babylon you're called to be in babylon you're called to be in babylon you called to preach the gospel he called and lead your home you're called to do what god told you to do a bishop must be a mother uh the bible says younger woman mary bear the house keep children and so forth brother you're called to be a father you're called to raise the children you're called that when they disobey your call just to not spare the rods full of child you're called to spank them what is it it's your calling it's a calling it's a word of god it's the word of god brother baron said you might be a housewife he a farmer whatever you are he should do it with all you if you're ever going to do it if you're ever going to do it this is the hour mordecai i told his his knees he said esther for such who but no but for such a time as this that you have been brought into the kingdom i want to tell your sister brother for such a time as this i believe i was raised for this time i was raised for this purpose god put me on earth for this purpose god put you on earth for the services oh brother sister run the race be strong joshua be of courage caleb you're more than able greater is he that is in you this is the word of promise when the devil brings these old weights monday morning he drops that weight in tuesday he drops the weight in wednesday he drops all the cares in he drops all the troubles and you get all the way up to sunday and you feel so weighted down you feel so weighted down and that water that was so clear and clean now it's overtaken by all these burdens and troubles and cares and if i was to dump this water out into the other cup you'd realize this thing's about half full but the bible says we come unto him all that are weary and heavy laden the bible said cast your cares on him brother sister you got to empty out you got to empty out your cares this is the key to an overcoming life brother branham said that you've got to cast your cares on him for he careth for you oh the bible said they that wait upon the lord that's the weight that we need in our life we need to wait upon the lord hope we get done praying and it's only been us praying lord this lord that lord this lord that jesus says lord help me hear me and god can't get a word in edgewise yeah the bible says wait brother i'm preaching a message about about to hear his voice he said get in a quiet place oh we have to make the time brother so you said i don't have time we have to make time we have to make time the bible teaches us to pray without ceasing the bible teaches us to run the race with patience brother you've got to pace yourself we're living in an hour that you're going to have to pace yourself you're going to have to say sunday morning i'm going to church job can wait wednesday night i'm going to church job can wait brother braham said you can miss work but don't wish church why because the bible says the bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourself together even the more so as you see the day approaching but we see people forsaking the assembling of because they're forsaken they're walking away from the weary word of god brother and said to overcome he said jesus how did jesus overcome three wild attacks the word the bible says the bible says this the bible said man should not live by bread alone the bible said this the bible says this the bible said forsake not the assembling of yourself together i don't care if i make the job or i don't make the job i don't care if i make the deal or i don't get the deal i don't care if the wife gets angry job said i'm going to serve god [Music] jesus said it like this he said in luke chapter 14 he said and accept you can forsake your father except you can forsake your mother except you can forsake your sister and your brother and your own life also you cannot be my disciple brother brandon taught us in the message that you're a perfect man he said that there's a first step the first step is to have faith and be born again he said this is the problem that we see so many who run the race and then you look alongside the road and you see like you drive down the road you see a car parked there maybe something you like what's going on i don't know just keep going brother what is that to you follow thou me what is that to you followed thou me he said we these scrap peeps now i'm not telling you to not be the good samaritan i'm not telling you that because the bible says that you gotta bear one another's burdens that's another problem we don't we don't look for out for the other man we don't bear the burdens of others because he said it's an automatic thing if the life of christ in you it's an automatic thing we don't have the life of christ and it's not automatic that's why but may we get the life of christ and it's not hard brother sister just say lord here i am lord i'm i'm full of weights i'm full of burdens i come here this morning you prepared a place he's prepared a place this morning he prepared an altar the altar is in your heart take that big old cup of burdens that you got down inside of you and jump it out at the feet of jesus this morning i don't care how old you are i don't care what you've been through we've all been through it brother sister young oh we all got across to gary jesus said oh but i know one i know one who has never never forsaken you who has never done you any wrong oh you might be able to punch your finger and say that man did me wrong but jesus never did you any wrong where are you looking this morning are you looking to the man are you looking to christ [Applause] hallelujah look at balaam the donkey smoked the pound god can you use a donkey god can use an unredeemed donkey to speak his word it doesn't matter who it is but god can speak to you god can make himself real to you don't lose sight of the power of almighty god hallelujah is there somebody here this morning we're coming down to close let's bow our heads i believe god wants to make himself real to us the bible said in peter he said casting all your cares on him for he careth for you is there someone here this morning oh you say i don't move like they move up in that city i don't talk as fast as they talking brother forgive me for talking fast this morning i know i quoted a lot of scriptures and maybe you don't even have it written down you but but something god has spoken to your heart this morning just some little thing and you know it was god and you know only god can know that about you the bible says that his word deserves as your sister maybe you could just play about the ice withdrawal and you would say to the lord this morning you would not be ashamed oh my sometimes we afraid that somebody's gonna see us or or or maybe somebody gonna say oh that hypocrite let me tell you something bartimaeus was not ashamed he he seen that guard was coming down the road he cried out jesus jesus our son have mercy have mercy is there somebody this morning you would just with your eyes closed and your head bowed you say lord great is thy mercy great is i mercy hallelujah lamentation 322 [Music] it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed [Music] it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions they fail not hallelujah said they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness [Music] great is thy faithfulness the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore i hope in him the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord for the lord will not cast off forever but though he calls grief oh sometimes he puts rocks in our bed brother what is it it's the mercy of god some god sometimes god will put you down on your back so that you get down on your knees what is it it's the mercy of god sometimes god will cause you to lose your job so you'll run to the one who's the provider he'll get you sick he'll allow you to get sick so you'll run to the healer and sometimes he'll cause everything to fall apart [Music] so that you realize you can do nothing without him [Music] we must humble ourselves but abraham said this is how you overcome by the word of god humility this is how we overcome we said lord i am nothing isaiah you saw the great king uzziah lifted up on his throne but then he died god had to take him out of the way to where everything that he had put his hope in come crashing down oh we've put our we put our sights on this one or that one and god has we've seen like like we've seen a little nursery rhyme humpty dumpty had a great fall we've seen a lot of great falls around us saints we've seen great fall in a way we've seen people that we thought brother brandon said the kernel of sincerity but they're not the colonel anymore but let me help you this morning just to put your eyes on jesus look to the reward look to the marriage supper look to the to the millennium look to what's coming don't look to corona don't look to this don't put your eyes on the fearful waves look at the hand that's reached down to help you walk on the water oh he's pulling you up this morning he's saying brother sister come unto me hallelujah the lord will not cast off forever though he calls grief yet he have compassion according to the multitude of his tender mercies he has a multitude of tender mercies this morning hallelujah just with our heads bowed i wonder has this has this resonated with you something in your soul today as god spoke to you and you lift your hand this morning saying lord god you're speaking to me [Music] i want to run this race lord if i've ever run it before now i got to run it lord i gotta run and i gotta pace myself i gotta go to church i gotta read the word of god i gotta get in the bible lord it's time to confess my sins it's time you've been holding grudges against somebody it's time to go to that person why because you've been praying and you've been praying and you've been praying you've been hitting a brick wall because the bible teaches you if you have art in your heart leave the altar go get the art out and come back to the altar brother we've been taught these things the bible speaks the bible says look continue in the things you have heard and been assured of the holy scriptures they're able to make you wise they're able to save you that are able to inspire you that we've left it we've somehow we've gotten off the path we've gotten up we've taken a detour but it's time to get back in the race tonight oh my john chapter one verse john he says he said if you confess your sins he is faithful and just to forgive you your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness he said we have an advocate a high priest oh praise be to god he's a faithful high priest he's touched by your feeling this morning i wonder you're going through a trouble you're going through trial it touches it touches god would you have faith to stand on your feet and say lord god whatever i'm going through i'm going to stand on my feet and i'm going to look to calvary that paid for it this morning i'm going to look to calvary that paid for my encouragement and paid for my strength that paid for everything i have need of and you'd stand on your feet as a symbolism that you're gonna dump out those burdens brother you're not gonna carry that no more you're gonna leave this place this morning free of that burden free of that care oh just take that little cup and dump it upside down and say lord take it from me he said cast your gears on me he said i care for you oh brother he he cornered in the song service this morning he had me listening to it on the way down here and now we've preached it again that's three witnesses that god cares but do you care [Music] foreign i am the lord i speak to thee this morning i have given my witness my word is true three places have i told me now i care for thee i care for thee will thou cast thy cares upon me now and i will prove to thee that i care and i will show you i will make a way hallelujah thus saith the lord you say god can't speak god can speak he can speak through prophecy he can speak through his word but let me tell you something this morning god is here he cares for you brother sister you say oh lord i can see now i can see that you care for me lord [Music] you know jesus prayed for blind men one day and he said lord i can see i see ministries walking jesus prayed for him again and when he prayed for him again he could see clearly that's what the problem is sometimes we come into church we get a little touch from god we get a little something and we think that's it but brother sister we need to lay it all down at the feet of jesus that we can see clearly there's a place where you can walk that you're free in the spirit of god [Music] is there someone this morning you're saying lord i just want to be free if two or three agree as touching anything the bible says we can have what we ask if you're willing and you care this morning i'm gonna challenge you to take the promise of god and say brother let's agree let's pray together is there someone they said no don't lay hands on me the bible said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover oh my so many were sick and spirit we're sick in body just invite you now if you want prayer brother come forward we're going to pray for you look don't take the word of a man take the word of god take this bible right here this book his book right here he said he cares for you do you believe that this morning oh my hallelujah hallelujah i don't know how much more plain it could be by the time but god wants to tell somebody this morning and he cares about you i believe that christ was hearing a flesh body this morning he would say brother this brother sister this your name is this your name is that i care for you [Music] catch the curse catch your cares you have an opportunity to catch scares this morning this is somebody you come forward today you said i don't have to come forward then don't come forward but cast your cares on christ oh i believe that god is a prayer answering god i believe there's somebody in this church that's been praying somebody's been praying because the bible says he hears the cries of the righteous his eyes are upon you his ears are open to your cry and when that man cried god came he was already on the way across the water he was already coming oh he's already prepared to wait for you brother sister you've been going through trial you've been feeling down and out you've been feeling like you didn't have any strength but god is already on the way and god's already prepared away god's had this brother preaching like noah he preached for 120 years he's had his brother here he's had him preaching that god sent many gifts he's sent many he sent many opportunities and here's another opportunity this morning will we take advantage of god's opportunity this morning paul told timothy said don't lose the urgency we may not have another opportunity but by god's grace don't walk out of here this morning burning down oh my laid at the feet of jesus we're
