[0:14] we will read till um verse
[0:19] 20 a false balance is abomination to the
[0:22] Lord but a just weight is his Delight
[0:33] the Integrity of the upright shall guide
[0:35] them but the perverseness of
[0:38] transgressors shall destroy
[0:47] them the righteousness of the perfect
[0:50] shall direct his way but the wicked
[0:52] shall fall by his own wickedness
[1:04] when a wicked man dieth his expectation
[1:07] Shall Perish and the hope of unjust men
[1:17] perisheth an hypocrite with his mouth
[1:20] destroyeth his neighbor but through
[1:22] knowledge shall the just be delivered
[1:34] by the blessing of the upright the city
[1:36] is exalted but it is overthrown by the
[1:39] mouth of the
[1:49] wicked a tail Bearer reveal Secrets but
[1:53] he that is a a faithful Spirit conceal
[1:56] the matter
[2:05] he that is charity for a stranger shall
[2:08] smart for it and he that hateth ship is
[2:19] sure the merciful man doeth good to his
[2:23] own soul but he that is cruel troubleth
[2:26] his own flesh
[2:35] as righteousness tendeth to life so he
[2:39] that pursueth evil pursueth it to his
[2:41] own death this one together they that
[2:44] are of a frowed heart are Abomination to
[2:47] the Lord but such as are upright in
[2:49] their way are his Delight
[3:12] morning brothers and sisters I'll try
[3:15] not to move this around a whole bunch I
[3:17] was just uh thinking about what they had
[3:19] on the board back there about
[3:21] Nebuchadnezzar you know just a a gentile
[3:25] King that God was working with sometimes
[3:28] when you when you read his whole life
[3:30] and all that he went through that God
[3:33] put him through and what he did to other
[3:35] nations but he still worked with a
[3:37] gentile King it's amazing what God can
[3:40] do if whether you're a vessel of Wrath
[3:42] or a vessel of Grace God's still going
[3:45] to use you our hope as Christians is
[3:48] that we stay as Christians and God uses
[3:51] us as a vessel of Grace uh I was and
[3:54] reading in that that Psalm I mean after
[3:57] reading those 20 verses
[4:00] if that's exactly what we need as
[4:03] Believers this morning we have to
[4:05] have these verses have to be in our
[4:08] hearts and lives this morning if these
[4:09] aren't working the way out of you and
[4:13] this isn't how you're dealing with the
[4:14] people that surround you then there's
[4:16] something wrong but I was uh listening
[4:19] to a message this morning and this
[4:22] wasn't the scripture but I
[4:24] was if you turn with me to Deuteronomy
[4:28] the 29th chapter
[4:31] but I was also listening and uh this
[4:34] last verse in this chapter speaks
[4:36] volumes for where we're at you
[4:38] know the world is coming to an end here
[4:41] quicker than we thought it would you
[4:44] know ministers will come up and they'll
[4:47] tell you it's a late hour and there's
[4:50] something that's going to happen in our
[4:52] hearts and lives when you hear that
[4:53] you're either going to get worse or
[4:55] you're going to get better you're either
[4:56] going to believe it or you're not going
[4:58] to believe it either you're going to act
[5:00] on it or you're not going to act there's
[5:02] and you know and that's what Deuteronomy
[5:05] is there's a negative and a positive to
[5:08] everything we choose to do or everything
[5:10] we choose not to do in our hearts and
[5:12] lives but I'll I'm going to jump around
[5:15] until I get to the 29th verse and we
[5:18] know that it's a the Deuteronomy is a
[5:20] book of contrast a b Book of Life or a
[5:23] book of death and as an individual as a
[5:27] as a tribes and as a nation Israel had
[5:30] to either choose the right way or the
[5:32] Long Way well it's no different for us
[5:34] this morning you either have to choose
[5:35] the right way or the wrong way I I hope
[5:39] I don't read this whole chapter but um
[5:43] but starting at the ninth verse of the
[5:45] 29th chapter of
[5:47] Deuteronomy I find myself if I just read
[5:50] God's word then I'll only say what God's
[5:52] word has to say I used to listen to a
[5:55] preacher every morning when I used to
[5:57] drive on post uh and he was one of the
[6:01] one of those people that would read a
[6:03] verse and then talk about that verse but
[6:06] not change the verse he would just say
[6:07] what the verse has to say and I find
[6:10] that if you read a verse and you study
[6:12] the verse and move to the next one
[6:14] you'll find yourself being grounded in
[6:16] the word of God but I'll read the ninth
[6:18] verse keep therefore the words of the
[6:21] Covenant and do them that you may
[6:23] prosper and all that you do and I mean
[6:26] that's pretty simple there he goes on to
[6:28] say ye stand this day all of you before
[6:31] the Lord your God your captains your
[6:33] tribes your elders your officers with
[6:36] all the man of Israel so it's you're
[6:39] just as important as a father of a
[6:41] family as the preacher of the church you
[6:43] all stand before the god responsible for
[6:46] who God gives you care of and he goes on
[6:48] to say here your little ones and your
[6:51] wives The Strangers that is in thy Camp
[6:54] from the ureer of the wood onto the
[6:56] drawer of thy
[6:58] water that thou th should US enter into
[7:00] a covenant with the Lord thy God into
[7:03] his oath which the Lord thy God maketh
[7:06] with thee this day that he may establish
[7:09] thee to a day for a people unto himself
[7:12] that he may be unto thee a God he ha
[7:14] sent unto thee as he has sworn unto thy
[7:17] fathers Abraham and to Isaac and to
[7:20] Jacob and then I'm going to stop there
[7:23] I'll wind up reading the whole chapter
[7:25] then I'm going to jump into the uh about
[7:28] the 22nd verse and finish at this last
[7:30] verse and it says here so that at the
[7:33] 22nd verse it says here so that the
[7:35] generations to come of you children that
[7:38] shall rise up after you and the
[7:40] strangers that shall come from AAR land
[7:43] shall say when they see the plagues so
[7:45] this is they' chose if they choose the
[7:47] opposite this is what it's saying here
[7:50] they shall see the plagues of the land
[7:52] and the sickness which the Lord hath
[7:53] laid upon it and and that the whole land
[7:57] thereof is brimstone and salt and
[7:59] burning
[8:00] that is not sewn nor bre or any grass
[8:03] that groweth therein like overthrow of
[8:06] Sodom and gomorra forgive my
[8:08] pronunciations of these words Adema and
[8:12] zeum which the Lord overthrew in his
[8:14] anger and his wrath so this is another
[8:17] contrast this is a bad cont a dark
[8:19] contrast here even all the in nation
[8:22] shall say wherefore hath the Lord done
[8:24] this onto this land what meanthis heat
[8:27] of this great anger and we know what
[8:29] this means that they chose the wrong way
[8:32] that man shall say because they have
[8:34] forsake and this is what's really and
[8:36] this this speaks to our nation it speaks
[8:39] to you as an indiv or me as an
[8:42] individual or any country or any place
[8:45] in the world this it's no different you
[8:48] know um God dealt with the children of
[8:51] Israel for so many years he's dealt with
[8:53] the Gentile church so many years but you
[8:56] reap and you sell you can't get you
[8:58] can't get away from those Prin
[8:59] principles they're going to apply to you
[9:01] as an individual they're going to apply
[9:03] to you as a family they're going to
[9:05] apply to you as a church or as a nation
[9:07] you can't get away from those simple
[9:09] principles and I lost my place but I'll
[9:12] and it's the 24th verse even all these
[9:15] nations shall say wherefore hath the
[9:17] Lord done this unto this land what
[9:20] meaneth the heat of this great anger
[9:22] then men shall say because they have
[9:24] forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God
[9:27] their fathers which he had made with
[9:29] them
[9:29] he brought them forth out of the land of
[9:32] Egypt well I can take I'm not going to
[9:34] take you can look at this scripture and
[9:36] it's no different for us you have the
[9:39] whole gospel presented before you and
[9:41] it's no different for us this morning
[9:43] you it's got to change your heart in
[9:45] your life just like it had to do theirs
[9:48] and he goes on to say for they went and
[9:50] served other gods and worshiped them
[9:52] Gods whom they need not and whom they
[9:55] have not given unto them and it's no
[9:57] different than our what you know they
[10:00] were worshiping they didn't have the
[10:02] information age that we have this
[10:03] morning but where they were just
[10:06] worshiping dead dumb Idols well it's no
[10:08] different today whatever you spend the
[10:11] most time
[10:12] doing I I found in my own life whatever
[10:15] you find yourself defaulting to what you
[10:18] want to do the most when no one's
[10:20] looking that pretty much gives you a
[10:22] good sign or a good example of who you
[10:25] really are and I don't know anyone here
[10:28] but I just know know for myself if I
[10:30] find myself doing something too much
[10:33] then I know that I'm off the mark and I
[10:35] need to come back to the center line and
[10:38] he goes on to say here and the anger of
[10:41] the Lord was kindled against the land to
[10:43] bring upon it all the curses that are
[10:45] written in this book and the Lord rooted
[10:48] them out of their land in anger and in
[10:50] Wrath and in great indignation and cast
[10:52] them into another land as it is of this
[10:55] day but I was just thinking about this
[10:57] scripture this morning as I read it and
[11:00] brother brandham preached about this
[11:02] scripture right the secret things belong
[11:04] unto the Lord Our God but those things
[11:06] which are revealed belong unto us I'm be
[11:10] stop there that's no different for us
[11:12] this morning this message of the hour we
[11:14] all truly believe and trust it's no
[11:17] different for us this morning I know I
[11:19] try not to repeat myself that secret
[11:21] things belong unto the Lord Our God but
[11:24] those things which are revealed belong
[11:25] unto us to our children forever that you
[11:29] may do all the words of the law well I I
[11:31] don't I was thinking this morning it's
[11:34] no different for us the whole message of
[11:35] the hour is before you all the secret
[11:38] things that have been revealed all
[11:40] you're responsible for this morning or
[11:42] all I'm responsible for is the word of
[11:45] God that's been presented to me in the
[11:48] age that I live in this morning and all
[11:50] I'm responsible for is fulfilling that
[11:52] word in my life and in my heart this
[11:55] morning and that's the only thing that
[11:57] matters and it's the same thing that
[11:59] Moses told the children of Israel this
[12:03] that I'm reading right here these things
[12:05] these blessings that come from the
[12:07] message of the hour that come from the
[12:08] word of God they're yours this morning
[12:10] anything that you have need of this
[12:12] morning any word I was listening to that
[12:15] message this morning and he was you know
[12:18] he was going from the end of I'm trying
[12:21] not to drop this mic closes
[12:25] up I was about to say something I say it
[12:27] a lot I wasn't going to say it but
[12:29] that's I was listening to to that
[12:32] message this morning and as he finished
[12:36] presenting the word of God I forget what
[12:38] message it was he got done and then he
[12:40] took and then you you used to you'll
[12:43] hear this a lot where he says he where
[12:45] brother Bram as a minister prays and
[12:48] takes full control over every Spirit
[12:51] everything that's going on in that
[12:52] assembly so that he can exercise that
[12:56] gift on the hearts of the people and I
[12:58] and what was
[13:00] striking is that soon as he does that he
[13:03] starts revealing the what lays in the
[13:05] hearts of the people and I was saying to
[13:08] myself that's what we need this morning
[13:10] where the spirit of God can speak to our
[13:12] hearts and this morning that we take
[13:14] full control over our families over our
[13:17] our group together where God can deal
[13:20] with us as individuals this morning you
[13:23] know that presence is here for us this
[13:25] morning I I'm just going to stop with
[13:28] this simple point the world out there is
[13:30] just a crazy place I I don't even like
[13:32] talking about it a whole bunch because
[13:34] it's just crazy it's it has totally gone
[13:36] off the edge and it's like I said before
[13:41] it's just like a rocket shooting in the
[13:42] air you know it just it accelerates and
[13:45] accelerates and accelerates and once it
[13:48] gets in space there's no resistance
[13:50] there's no no gravity anymore so it just
[13:53] accelerates and that's where we're at
[13:55] this morning it's just accelerating and
[13:57] there's no stopping it so it just lets
[14:00] me know as a Believer instead of going
[14:03] that way I need to go the other way and
[14:05] I need to get closer to him I need to
[14:07] get closer to Jesus Christ this morning
[14:09] so I'm ready on that day I
[14:12] hope that the only thing I have a hope
[14:15] for in this life is that God will come
[14:19] touch my heart make me a better
[14:21] Christian tomorrow than I was today
[14:23] that's the only thing that matters in
[14:25] this life that we live Brother David

[14:37] morning I guess my mic's not on do you

[14:55] crazy but we're the only sane one in the

[44:17] um the last time I thank you musicians
[44:21] the last time I was here he uh he kind
[44:24] of gave me what I would call a
[44:25] backhanded compliment I believe that's
[44:27] the the right word I think he said uh he
[44:30] wasn't expecting it to be that
[44:33] good and uh you know what was really
[44:36] funny about that brother B I don't know
[44:37] if I told you this but the first time I
[44:39] ministered at our church our pastor
[44:41] brother Nathan got up and he said uh I
[44:45] was expecting it to be good but not that
[44:48] good so I was the second backhanded
[44:50] compliment that I've gotten but uh but
[44:53] that's okay um if you have your bibles
[44:55] if we could turn to uh we're going to
[44:58] turn to John uh one we're going to read
[45:01] John 1 through three we're going to read
[45:05] a little bit of scripture here so you
[45:07] might be standing for just a few minutes
[45:09] and um so get comfortable for a minute
[45:15] here all right I like
[45:21] that so John John 1 we're going to read
[45:25] one to three
[45:27] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:30] Word was with God and the Word was God
[45:34] the same was in the beginning with God
[45:36] all things were made by him and without
[45:38] him was not anything made that was
[45:42] made all things were made or created by
[45:46] God everything yeah there's never been
[45:49] anything put on this Earth or put in
[45:52] this atmosphere anything ever that was
[45:55] not created by by God things have been
[45:58] perverted but nothing has been created
[46:01] unless it was by God life was only given
[46:05] by God everything that lives was because
[46:09] God gave it life even Cain the the the
[46:13] one from the evil one brother Brown said
[46:15] even Cain life came from
[46:18] God all things were created all things
[46:22] that live were made by god let's turn to
[46:26] Genesis 1 we're going to read
[46:30] 27-31 and then we're going to jump right
[46:32] on into Genesis 2 and we're going to
[46:33] read 1:
[46:44] 3 if you're there say
[46:46] Amen all
[46:48] right so God created man in his own
[46:51] image in the image of God created he him
[46:54] male and female created he them and God
[46:57] blessed them and God said unto them be
[46:59] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[47:01] Earth and subdue
[47:04] it and have dominion over the fish of
[47:06] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[47:08] over every living thing that moveth upon
[47:10] the Earth and God said behold I have
[47:12] given you every herb bearing seed which
[47:15] which is upon the face of all the Earth
[47:17] and every tree in the which is the fruit
[47:21] of the tree yielding seed to you it
[47:23] shall be for meat and every beast of the
[47:26] earth and every foul of the air and
[47:28] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[47:30] where wherein there is life I have given
[47:32] every green herb for meat and it was so
[47:36] and God saw everything that he had made
[47:38] and behold it was very good and the
[47:41] evening and the morning were the sixth
[47:43] day keep going right on over into two 1
[47:46] to three thus the heavens and the Earth
[47:48] were finished and all the host of them
[47:51] and on the seventh day God ended his
[47:54] work which he had made and he rested on
[47:57] the seventh day from all his work which
[47:58] he had made and God blessed the seventh
[48:01] day and Sanctified it because that in
[48:04] because that in it he had rested from
[48:06] all his work which God created and made
[48:10] now think about this for a
[48:12] minute God created
[48:16] everything on the earth in this time
[48:19] this was not easy this was this was hard
[48:21] work I mean I I don't know how this was
[48:23] for God but I know he rested after he
[48:26] got done
[48:27] do you think about what he did here the
[48:31] details in which he has just performed
[48:35] he didn't just put a tree I don't
[48:36] believe that there was ever a time where
[48:38] God put a tree over here and said now I
[48:40] like it better over here he put that
[48:43] tree specifically there for a reason
[48:47] that may been thousands of years from
[48:49] the time that he put that tree there but
[48:52] that tree was there for a reason maybe
[48:54] that tree is going to fall over
[48:57] and it's going to
[48:58] rot and some ants are going to start
[49:02] building a colony in that tree because
[49:04] there's going to be a an animal brother
[49:06] Tommy that I don't even know what it's
[49:07] for but an ante eater is going to come
[49:10] along and it's going to need something
[49:11] to
[49:12] eat and those little litty bitty ants
[49:15] that this ante eater eats are going to
[49:17] be there because that tree was
[49:21] there he doesn't miss a
[49:24] detail all the way down through your
[49:26] life every person that you were ever
[49:28] going to need to come in contact with
[49:30] every this church right here was in the
[49:33] mind of God before the foundation of the
[49:35] Earth every detail he doesn't miss a
[49:43] one let's go to Joshua 10 we're going to
[49:46] read 12 to 14
[50:08] we
[50:09] there okay Joshua 10 we're going to read
[50:12] 12-4 then spake Joshua to the Lord in
[50:15] the day when the Lord delivered up the
[50:17] amorites before the children of Israel
[50:19] and he said in the sight of Israel son
[50:22] stand thou still upon gibian and thou
[50:25] moon in the valley of aelon
[50:27] and the sun Stood Still and the moon
[50:29] stayed until the people had Avenged
[50:32] themselves upon their enemies is not
[50:34] this written in the book of jasher so
[50:37] the sun Stood Still in the midst of
[50:39] heaven and hasted not to go down about a
[50:42] whole day and there was no day like that
[50:45] before before it or after it that the
[50:48] Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man
[50:51] the Lord fought for
[50:54] Israel what's going on right here here
[50:57] is that gibian is under attack from five
[51:02] other countries five other kings have
[51:04] come together to attack this
[51:07] Ally of the children of
[51:10] Israel and the sun's starting to go down
[51:13] it's get starting to get
[51:14] dark and they know that if the sun goes
[51:17] down these men are going to have the
[51:18] opportunity to regroup they're going to
[51:20] be able to retreat they're going to
[51:21] regroup this battle is going to continue
[51:25] to the next day if something something
[51:26] doesn't
[51:28] happen this wasn't just a little
[51:30] Skirmish this was a battle and they
[51:33] needed it to end then so Joshua commands
[51:38] the sun to stand still the moon to stop
[51:42] moving and
[51:44] God the creator of everything hearkened
[51:49] hearkened means he listened he listened
[51:52] to the voice of a
[51:54] man and he stopped everything from
[51:57] moving for almost a
[52:03] day let's
[52:05] pray dear heavenly father Lord It's
[52:08] always such a wonderful and an awesome
[52:11] opportunity father to come into your

[53:16] would like for you if you if you have
[53:19] something on your
[53:22] heart to hold it on your heart this
[53:25] morning and and and think about this as
[53:28] we're as we're as we're going through
[53:30] this
[53:31] little this little
[53:33] text the uh titled to my
[53:36] sermon is little
[53:39] Lazarus and I'm going to tell you right
[53:42] now we're going to take a few left turns
[53:44] and a few right turns okay so you're
[53:49] probably going to be wondering here in a
[53:50] little bit where in the world I'm going
[53:52] with this but with the help of the Lord
[53:53] this is all going to make sense um so if
[53:56] anybody gets confused at any point raise
[53:58] your hand and we'll we'll back up and
[54:01] figure it out but I'm going to start off
[54:04] by telling you guys a
[54:05] story and
[54:08] uh this has been a little while back I
[54:10] was on a um a trip with a a good friend
[54:13] of mine and uh it was a a trip he was
[54:17] preaching um at another church and I
[54:19] went with him and as I'm sitting there
[54:22] and I'm listening to him preach and he's
[54:25] he's more of a teacher
[54:26] but as I'm as I'm listening to this and
[54:30] uh man he's he's just taking he's just
[54:33] taking the the the Bible and he's just
[54:35] diving deep into it and he's he's he's
[54:39] he's saying things that just like I mean
[54:41] me sitting there I mean they're just
[54:42] like wow I've never thought of this that
[54:44] way I've never I've never thought of
[54:45] this and this and and I mean he's just
[54:48] really just doing a great job and I
[54:51] start sitting there and the devil he
[54:54] starts tapping me on the shoulder
[54:57] saying what does he need you
[54:59] for if he's got men like this what does
[55:03] he need you
[55:04] for and so I start
[55:06] questioning my
[55:08] Ministry because I'm wondering the same
[55:11] thing if he's got men that can preach
[55:14] like this this man's a teacher I'm an
[55:16] evangelist you know Lord if if you're
[55:19] gonna you're G to lay a thought on my
[55:21] heart and you're wanting me to express
[55:22] it well don't just lay it on his heart
[55:24] and let him express it cuz he's better
[55:26] at than me and then I can just sit out
[55:28] here this whole Ministry thing can go
[55:31] away and my wife said
[55:34] yes so I'm just
[55:38] thinking what do you need me
[55:41] for
[55:42] and so I'm I I start dealing with
[55:46] this
[55:50] and I feel that he's called me to preach
[55:54] but I'm trying to figure out you know
[55:56] why does he need me and as a Son of God
[56:00] and I do believe that I'm a Son of
[56:04] God what can you use me for what can
[56:07] what can I do for you and so I did
[56:11] something here and I started I started
[56:12] seeking after a sign now before
[56:16] everybody panics because we're not
[56:17] supposed to seek after signs right we're
[56:20] gonna we're gonna kind of talk about
[56:22] this for just a minute because there's
[56:25] there's two two different types of
[56:27] people that seek after a sign I was at
[56:30] at lunch with another Minister that I
[56:32] didn't know that well not too long ago
[56:34] and I started telling him about this and
[56:36] I I didn't know if he was going to kill
[56:37] over you know from a heart attack or if
[56:39] he was going to choke to death on his
[56:41] food because all of a sudden I'm not a
[56:43] Believer because I'm seeking a sign you
[56:45] know that's that's a big problem but
[56:47] there's two different types of people
[56:50] that seek after a sign see there's an a
[56:54] non-believer somebody that will say
[56:57] if you'll do this for me Lord show me a
[57:01] miracle show me if you'll if you'll take
[57:03] my my mother that's dying of cancer and
[57:06] you'll heal her then I'll believe this
[57:10] that's a non-believer see they don't
[57:11] believe they're looking for something to
[57:14] make them to believe this but a
[57:17] Believer that's looking for a sign a
[57:20] Believer if you're a Believer you
[57:22] already believe this and if you believe
[57:26] this what you're looking
[57:28] for is the
[57:30] Vindication I already believe this I'm
[57:34] not I'm not asking you to do this so I
[57:36] will believe it I'm asking you to do it
[57:37] because I do believe it I want to see
[57:41] this in my life I want to see this in
[57:44] action that's the difference between a
[57:46] Believer and a non-believer somebody
[57:48] looking for a sign I'm going dig into
[57:50] this just a little bit deeper here and
[57:53] we're going to go into uh uh I'm going
[57:55] to look at Matthew 16 I'm going to read
[57:57] 1 to4 the Pharisees also with the
[57:59] Sadducees came and tempting desired him
[58:02] that he would show them a sign from
[58:05] Heaven he answered and said unto them
[58:07] when it is evening ye say it will be
[58:09] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[58:12] the morning it will be foul weather uh
[58:15] foul weather today for the sky is red
[58:17] and lowering oh ye
[58:19] Hypocrites ye can discern the face of
[58:21] the
[58:23] sky but cannot but can ye not discern
[58:26] the signs of the time a wicked and
[58:28] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[58:30] sign and there shall no sign be given to
[58:33] it but the sign of prophet Jonas and he
[58:37] left him and
[58:39] departed they were asking him for a sign
[58:42] to prove who he
[58:44] was he'd given so he'd given multiple
[58:48] signs to them but they were
[58:51] non-believers it did not matter what
[58:53] sign or how many signs he gave them they
[58:55] were never going to believe they were
[58:59] nonbelievers so a wicked and evil people
[59:03] you are seeking after his sign and I
[59:06] love I really liked his answer too
[59:07] because he he talks about you can
[59:10] walk catch this you can walk out of your
[59:13] house in the morning and you can look up
[59:16] in the sky and ju you've got the
[59:18] knowledge up here to look up here and go
[59:23] today' be a great day for a picnic
[59:26] or no today I'm going to stay home
[59:29] because I can see the way this looks
[59:31] there's there's rain
[59:33] coming you've got something up here but
[59:36] when it comes Discerning the time the
[59:39] the the times of of of now Discerning
[59:41] the times there's nothing in
[59:44] here for you to discern so you're
[59:47] constantly asking let me see a sign let
[59:49] me see a
[59:50] sign but he wasn't going to show them
[59:52] any more signs I'm going to read Matthew
[59:54] 12:
[59:55] 38-42 then certain of the scribes and
[59:57] the Pharisees answered saying Master we
[59:58] would we would see a sign from thee but
[1:00:01] he answered and said unto them an evil
[1:00:02] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:00:04] a sign and there shall no sign be given
[1:00:07] to it given to it but the sign of the
[1:00:10] Prophet
[1:00:12] Jonas so again I'm not giving you any
[1:00:15] more
[1:00:16] signs you I've given you signs you don't
[1:00:19] believe you're never going to believe
[1:00:21] I'm not going to just I'm not going to
[1:00:22] be a clown for you I believe is the way
[1:00:24] brother brandham put it not God's not a
[1:00:27] clown I'm going to keep reading for as
[1:00:30] Jonas was three days and three nights in
[1:00:32] the Well's belly so shall the son of man
[1:00:34] be three days and three nights in the
[1:00:36] heart of the Earth the men of Nineveh
[1:00:39] shall rise in judgment with this
[1:00:41] generation and shall condemn it because
[1:00:44] they repented at the preaching of Jonas
[1:00:48] and behold a greater than Jonas's here
[1:00:51] the queen of the South shall rise up in
[1:00:53] judgment with this generation and shall
[1:00:55] condemn it for she came from the
[1:00:57] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[1:01:00] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[1:01:03] than Solomon is
[1:01:07] here
[1:01:18] so so my question would be is why are
[1:01:20] these people going to rise up with this
[1:01:23] generation and judge them
[1:01:27] Jonah and the queen of the
[1:01:29] South or I'm sorry the men of Nineveh
[1:01:33] and the queen of the South why are they
[1:01:34] going to rise up in judgment well it's
[1:01:37] because they saw a sign one sign and
[1:01:40] they believed brother Bram talks about
[1:01:42] this fish swims up to the the the banks
[1:01:46] of this this this of the the the beach
[1:01:49] there opens its mouth out and this
[1:01:51] Prophet walks out of this
[1:01:53] fish the men of Nineveh they look at
[1:01:55] this
[1:01:58] this that was one
[1:02:00] sign but then it says he preached to
[1:02:03] them and they
[1:02:06] believed it didn't say that he performed
[1:02:09] Miracles there was not another sign
[1:02:12] given one sign but they believed because
[1:02:16] they were
[1:02:17] Believers the queen of the South brother
[1:02:20] Brown I believe said that she rode for
[1:02:21] three months on a camel to get to
[1:02:23] Solomon because she'd heard something
[1:02:26] that was going on there and then when
[1:02:28] she gets to him and brother Brown talks
[1:02:29] about the gift that Solon have the gift
[1:02:31] of discernment when she saw this gift
[1:02:34] one
[1:02:35] time she
[1:02:38] believed it changed her life
[1:02:41] forever one sign she didn't need to stay
[1:02:44] there and and and keep asking let me see
[1:02:46] another one let me see you do that again
[1:02:48] heal this one heal this one let me see
[1:02:49] another one no one because she was a
[1:02:54] Believer the difference between a
[1:02:56] Believer wanting to see a sign and a
[1:02:59] non-believer there's a big difference
[1:03:02] there so there I was as a
[1:03:08] Believer looking for a
[1:03:11] sign I believed this word I believ this
[1:03:16] and I believe this with all of my heart
[1:03:18] I know this is the
[1:03:20] truth and I wanted to see I wanted
[1:03:24] something that nobody could explain away
[1:03:27] that's what I was looking for you guys
[1:03:30] have heard my
[1:03:32] testimony I know that that was him that
[1:03:35] intervened in my life for me there is no
[1:03:38] other explanation for that and I think
[1:03:41] that you guys believe the same thing
[1:03:42] because I believe you're
[1:03:44] Believers but if I'm sitting in front of
[1:03:47] a atheist
[1:03:49] psychologist could he explain that
[1:03:52] away sure he could
[1:03:55] he could explain using some sort of
[1:03:58] psychology as to why I did this or that
[1:04:00] or whatever he could explain it
[1:04:02] away I was healed of migraines that I
[1:04:05] had for 30 years I know that I was
[1:04:10] healed by
[1:04:12] him of migraines that I had for 30
[1:04:16] years I know that because I'm I'm a
[1:04:18] Believer because I believe what's what's
[1:04:22] here but if I'm sitting in front of a a
[1:04:25] aist doctor could he explain it away of
[1:04:30] course he could he could come up with
[1:04:32] some sort of a reason why that
[1:04:35] happened I wanted something that nobody
[1:04:38] could
[1:04:39] explain and why did I want it it wasn't
[1:04:42] just for my sake it was for your
[1:04:45] sake Jesus standing in front at at the
[1:04:48] at the tomb of Lazarus when he's praying
[1:04:50] Lord I know that you hear me and I know
[1:04:51] that you always hear me but for their
[1:04:55] sake
[1:04:56] so that they will know that you sent
[1:05:00] me I wanted
[1:05:03] something just you can't explain it let
[1:05:07] me see let give me something so that
[1:05:09] that I know that I'm I'm I'm in your
[1:05:12] will here I I'm doing what you're
[1:05:13] wanting me to
[1:05:17] do so here I
[1:05:20] am looking for this sign
[1:05:26] whether you'll give it to me or not Lord
[1:05:29] I'm still going to believe this word
[1:05:31] because I'm a Believer so it doesn't
[1:05:33] matter whether you give this sign to me
[1:05:35] or not I'm still going to be a believer
[1:05:36] because I'm a
[1:05:38] Believer but you called me to the
[1:05:41] ministry I didn't ask for this you
[1:05:44] called
[1:05:45] me and I'm looking for something I'm
[1:05:48] looking for something that you can give
[1:05:50] me that I know without a doubt
[1:05:57] so as I'm dealing with
[1:06:02] this and Satan's really starting to beat
[1:06:05] me up about this brother was you able to
[1:06:07] get that
[1:06:13] picture this little guy comes along as
[1:06:15] I'm dealing with
[1:06:17] this if we can get it up
[1:06:20] there I don't know if we can or not
[1:06:26] if not I can get it up on here and I
[1:06:29] can give them just a minute so this
[1:06:32] little guy that I'm talking about is a
[1:06:33] little
[1:06:35] bunny
[1:06:37] and I got to give a little backstory
[1:06:41] to where I'm going with this because
[1:06:44] we're taking a a detour
[1:06:47] here so this little bunny comes along
[1:06:50] and we're getting close it's
[1:06:54] flashing uh this little bunny comes
[1:06:56] along and and previously to this bunny
[1:06:58] that that that they're they're trying to
[1:06:59] get the picture up um I was uh building
[1:07:04] a deck I think I told you guys I'm I'm a
[1:07:07] contractor and I was building a deck and
[1:07:09] while we were building this deck we
[1:07:11] uncovered a nest of
[1:07:13] bunnies and this little um Nest had had
[1:07:18] four bunnies in it
[1:07:20] and I took a board and I laid it across
[1:07:23] the nest because I didn't want anything
[1:07:24] to happen to him I thought well maybe
[1:07:25] mom's still around whatever she'll come
[1:07:27] back so um we work all day long on the
[1:07:32] deck I don't see mom anywhere the whole
[1:07:35] time so I had taken a little video of it
[1:07:38] and I kind of was petting one of the the
[1:07:39] little bunnies and and my youngest
[1:07:41] daughter she flips out man she wants the
[1:07:43] bunnies and so I'm sitting there
[1:07:45] thinking well I got you know a couple
[1:07:46] choices here really I can either leave
[1:07:48] them here and it was still cold outside
[1:07:50] and I was like I can leave them here and
[1:07:51] they're they're probably either going to
[1:07:53] starve to death or they're going to die
[1:07:55] you know of from freezing to death um or
[1:07:58] I could put them in a box and I mean
[1:08:00] they were little bitty guys or I can put
[1:08:02] them in a box and I can take them home
[1:08:04] and you know take their we can take the
[1:08:07] chances of of she can actually keep them
[1:08:09] alive so there's like a you take a a
[1:08:12] little bunny out of its its nest um it
[1:08:16] has about a 10% chance of
[1:08:18] survival so I took them I put them in a
[1:08:21] little box that I had and I took them
[1:08:22] home with me my daughter's flipping out
[1:08:25] and so my daughter uh she names them and
[1:08:29] she starts feeding these little bunnies
[1:08:32] and she went and the the the the pet
[1:08:35] people said hey get cat formula so she
[1:08:38] was literally putting the the formula in
[1:08:40] her hand and letting them eat out of her
[1:08:43] hand and she would have to bring them
[1:08:44] over there and she got them to the point
[1:08:46] where they were doing that good and then
[1:08:48] she started bottle feeding them and they
[1:08:51] started thriving all four of them which
[1:08:55] was was
[1:08:56] amazing and two weeks later now they're
[1:09:00] eating
[1:09:01] grass uh I mean they're running around
[1:09:04] they're just having a good time
[1:09:08] and two weeks later this bunny here that
[1:09:11] they're trying to get up on the
[1:09:13] screen shows up and and how this one
[1:09:16] came about was a friend of my daughters
[1:09:20] uh they live kind of on a farm and I
[1:09:22] guess the lawnmower had run over a nest
[1:09:24] and this was the only only one that
[1:09:26] survived so she called my my my daughter
[1:09:29] because she knew she had some other
[1:09:31] bunnies and was like Hey you want
[1:09:32] another one and Lena of course was like
[1:09:34] yeah I'll take it you know and so she
[1:09:36] takes this one and well she names this
[1:09:38] bunny
[1:09:39] Lazarus and uh um and so
[1:09:45] as she starts to basically do the same
[1:09:48] thing with this one that she had with
[1:09:50] the with the other four and uh
[1:09:55] it starts doing pretty good it
[1:09:58] starts eating a little bit and it's it's
[1:10:01] it's doing good and it's you know much
[1:10:03] smaller than the other
[1:10:05] ones but one day it it starts getting
[1:10:09] sick and we didn't know why couldn't
[1:10:12] figure out what was going on with this
[1:10:14] thing
[1:10:15] so I just took the little guy I'm
[1:10:19] already dealing with this whole Ministry
[1:10:21] thing and I took the little guy put him
[1:10:23] in my hands and I just
[1:10:26] prayed and my prayer was more than
[1:10:28] anything of Lord this thing does not
[1:10:31] have a
[1:10:33] soul it does not matter if this thing
[1:10:35] lives or dies it makes no difference
[1:10:38] whatsoever from what I can tell the only
[1:10:40] reason that bunnies exist are food for
[1:10:43] other animals they have no reason
[1:10:46] there's I mean what what what do they do
[1:10:49] for you nothing other than food that's
[1:10:50] what they you know they have babies
[1:10:54] constantly you know they they they they
[1:10:56] they just there's tons of them you know
[1:10:59] if something's not eating them you're
[1:11:00] going to get overran by bunnies so it's
[1:11:03] like will you let this thing live just
[1:11:08] because I'm asking you to do
[1:11:10] it going back to because I believe this
[1:11:15] and your word says because I care you
[1:11:20] care ask anything in my name and you'll
[1:11:24] have it so I'm asking you will you let
[1:11:28] this little guy live just because I'm
[1:11:32] asking you
[1:11:34] to
[1:11:37] well a few days later he
[1:11:41] dies there he
[1:11:44] is few days later he dies now he was
[1:11:46] only about this
[1:11:50] big and I'm
[1:11:53] thinking why
[1:11:56] what difference did it make
[1:11:59] Lord I've I I've got enough Faith to
[1:12:02] where I've been healed of migraines I've
[1:12:03] been healed of back pain instantly more
[1:12:06] than once you know I I know I have faith
[1:12:11] why couldn't this little guy
[1:12:13] live when he's he's meaningless it was
[1:12:16] just because a son of yours was asking
[1:12:19] you will you let him live and then he
[1:12:22] dies
[1:12:25] and I found out that he
[1:12:27] died because my wife had text me and it
[1:12:29] was on a Thursday I was actually at
[1:12:32] work and so I'm she text me this and I'm
[1:12:35] like man you got to be kidding me and it
[1:12:38] was just like you know things were just
[1:12:39] kind of starting to pile up on me a
[1:12:41] little bit I'm questioning my Ministry
[1:12:43] Satan just beating me up over that I'm
[1:12:46] asking Lord will you let me see
[1:12:48] something here hoping maybe it would you
[1:12:49] know maybe this right here well and then
[1:12:51] this guy dies and I it's just it's a
[1:12:54] it's a a bunny that means nothing why
[1:12:58] and so so I'm starting to to these
[1:13:01] things I mean he's he's you know Satan's
[1:13:03] now he's beating up on me good then I
[1:13:06] start to
[1:13:07] think this bunny right here the other
[1:13:11] four that my daughter got and named she
[1:13:14] named them Thumper Peter common name for
[1:13:19] money uh Theo and Jack nothing biblical
[1:13:24] why did did this one get named
[1:13:28] Lazarus and she calls me on a Thursday
[1:13:31] when he died he died on a Thursday and I
[1:13:34] start thinking
[1:13:36] Thursday how many days was it in the
[1:13:38] Bible that Lazarus was raised from the
[1:13:41] dead four
[1:13:43] days what's four days from Sunday four
[1:13:46] days from
[1:13:47] Thursday Sunday right Resurrection
[1:13:51] Day and then I kid you not that same day
[1:13:54] I'm listening to a tape and brother
[1:13:56] brandham starts talking
[1:13:58] about preach the gospel to Every
[1:14:03] Creature it didn't say every person it
[1:14:06] didn't say every man it said preach the
[1:14:08] gospel to every creature and I'm going
[1:14:10] to read that quote here in a few minutes
[1:14:12] but brother brandham said the word of
[1:14:15] God will take effect upon every
[1:14:19] creature so I just hear this quote and
[1:14:23] I'm
[1:14:23] thinking May maybe this is what I'm
[1:14:25] looking
[1:14:26] for I'm starting to get
[1:14:29] excited so I come home and I take little
[1:14:32] Lazarus and I put him in a little
[1:14:35] box and I take my prayer cloth that I
[1:14:38] keep in this Bible and I laid it over
[1:14:39] top of little
[1:14:41] Lazarus and this is on a Thursday
[1:14:43] evening Sarah's asking you know what
[1:14:46] what are you going to do with him I said
[1:14:47] just I'm GNA put him down here in my
[1:14:48] office leave him
[1:14:50] there and I start preparing now you guys
[1:14:53] have heard my testimony in thought I was
[1:14:55] nuts now you're really going to think
[1:14:56] I'm crazy I start preparing a sermon to
[1:15:01] preach on Sunday morning to a dead
[1:15:05] bunny because his word says preach the
[1:15:09] gospel to Every
[1:15:12] Creature so I start preparing this
[1:15:14] sermon sermon Sunday morning rolls
[1:15:17] around something wakes me up earlier
[1:15:21] than normal I look over at the clock and
[1:15:24] I mean I'm an hour and a half earlier
[1:15:26] than what I even need to get up or what
[1:15:27] I would even normally get up brother
[1:15:29] Tommy I go ahead and I get up I get
[1:15:32] ready I put on my suit I'm ready for
[1:15:35] church and I go and I get little Lazarus
[1:15:38] and I take my Bible I get my iPad I go

[1:15:44] our house and I go

[1:15:48] him on a little stand I open my bible on
[1:15:50] my
[1:15:51] iPad and I start preaching a c it was a
[1:15:55] beautiful day out Sun was shining nice
[1:15:57] breeze blowing I mean it was
[1:16:00] perfect and I was
[1:16:02] excited because this was the moment that
[1:16:05] I was looking
[1:16:07] for I'm not going to go through the
[1:16:09] whole sermon I am going to read you
[1:16:11] though the scriptures and the quotes
[1:16:14] that I read during that sermon and I
[1:16:16] titled titled that sermon Lazarus which
[1:16:19] just so happens to mean God has
[1:16:23] helped so I went to Philippians 4:6 be
[1:16:27] careful for not be careful for nothing

[1:17:30] the life of of his beast but The Tender
[1:17:33] Mercies of the wicked are cruel Luke 126

[1:18:04] together for good to them that love God
[1:18:06] to them who are the called according to
[1:18:09] his purpose John 14:6 Jesus saith unto
[1:18:13] him I am the way the truth and the life

[1:18:19] me
[1:18:21] 1965 definitive identifications of the
[1:18:23] Church the true church chur of the
[1:18:25] Living God here's the quote how many
[1:18:28] knows what the gospel is not the word
[1:18:31] Paul said the go Paul said the gospel
[1:18:34] come to us not in word only but through
[1:18:36] the power and manifestation of the Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost the gospel is the power of God to
[1:18:41] make the word act what it is what it
[1:18:45] says it'll do preach the gospel all the
[1:18:48] word all the world preach the gospel to
[1:18:50] just the white people or just the brown
[1:18:52] yellow black to every creature amen
[1:18:56] Every Creature you believe that means
[1:18:58] that I seen G God baffle a bull one day
[1:19:02] I seen him cause Hornets not to sting I
[1:19:04] seen him raise up
[1:19:06] AUM that has been laying dead all night
[1:19:09] every creature the gospel will take
[1:19:11] effect upon anything that you ask you
[1:19:14] say that's wrong brother Bram it's not
[1:19:17] wrong Church age book program of church
[1:19:20] age there it is he is spirit and he is
[1:19:25] life that is exactly what the word is
[1:19:28] that is exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:19:31] word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:19:34] man in faith takes that word into his
[1:19:37] heart and places it upon his lips why
[1:19:40] that is the same as deity speaking Every
[1:19:44] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[1:19:46] before that
[1:19:47] man John 11:11 these things said he and
[1:19:51] after that he saith unto them our friend
[1:19:54] Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may
[1:19:57] awake him out of sleep John 11:23 Jesus
[1:20:01] saith unto her thy brother shall rise
[1:20:03] again John 11:25 and 26 Jesus said unto
[1:20:07] her I am the resurrection and the life
[1:20:10] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:20:13] dead yet shall he live and
[1:20:15] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:20:18] shall never die believest thou
[1:20:20] this John 11:40 Jesus saith unto her
[1:20:24] said I said I not unto thee that if thou
[1:20:27] wouldest believe thou should us see the
[1:20:30] glory of
[1:20:31] God John 11:41 and44 in closing on this
[1:20:36] little sermon that I I did then they
[1:20:39] took away the Stone from the place where
[1:20:40] the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up
[1:20:42] his eyes and said father I thank thee
[1:20:46] that thou Hast heard me and I knew that
[1:20:48] thou hearest me always but because of
[1:20:51] the people which stand by I said it that
[1:20:54] they may believe that thou Hast sent me
[1:20:57] and when he thus had spoke he cried with
[1:21:00] a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he
[1:21:02] that was dead came forth bound hand and
[1:21:05] foot with grave cloth and his face was
[1:21:07] bound about with a napkin Jesus saith
[1:21:09] unto them loose him and let him
[1:21:13] go I preached that sermon to a dead
[1:21:18] Bunny and then I took my Bible I put it
[1:21:21] in my hand I took little Lazarus out of
[1:21:24] the box and I laid him right here on my
[1:21:27] Bible and I took the prayer cloth and
[1:21:30] laid it on top of
[1:21:31] him I wasn't playing a
[1:21:34] game I believe this word I believe he
[1:21:39] sent us a prophet and I believe the
[1:21:41] words of that Prophet I laid little
[1:21:44] Lazarus right here on the Bible and I
[1:21:45] put my hand over him and I started to
[1:21:47] sincerely
[1:21:49] pray and as I
[1:21:51] prayed with all expectation
[1:21:55] because this was the moment I was
[1:21:57] looking
[1:21:59] for and as I ended my prayer and I
[1:22:03] pulled my hand
[1:22:05] away and I want you guys to hold on to
[1:22:07] that thought remember where we're at in
[1:22:10] that story we're going to come back to
[1:22:12] that we're going to take a little turn
[1:22:16] here you guys still with me everybody's
[1:22:19] still with me
[1:22:21] okay so about eight years ago or so
[1:22:25] me and my wife we took a vacation to
[1:22:28] Jamaica this was before this was right
[1:22:32] before we started coming back to
[1:22:34] church while we were on this vacation in
[1:22:38] Jamaica we were staying at a
[1:22:41] resort and we were going to take an an
[1:22:44] Excursion that day where they take you
[1:22:45] out and show you some sites or whatever
[1:22:48] so us and all these other people get on
[1:22:49] this
[1:22:50] bus and this lady uh Jamaican lady real
[1:22:55] heavy Jamaican accent she's kind of like
[1:22:57] the guide that she starts to talk and
[1:23:00] tell us where we're going to go and all
[1:23:01] these things as the bus starts to pull
[1:23:03] away a lady in the back from our Resorts
[1:23:06] yells up and says wait wait wait I got a
[1:23:08] problem she's like I left something in
[1:23:10] the room I have to have it I don't
[1:23:11] remember it was medication I don't know
[1:23:13] what it was they stopped the bus she
[1:23:15] gets off she runs she grabs whatever it
[1:23:16] needs she gets back on the bus this
[1:23:18] Jamaican lady decides to take this
[1:23:21] opportunity to tell us a little
[1:23:23] something about the island is saying
[1:23:25] that they
[1:23:26] have she said here on the island we
[1:23:29] don't have problems we only have
[1:23:34] situations and I don't know why that
[1:23:36] struck me the way it did I mean I hadn't
[1:23:38] even started coming back to church yet
[1:23:40] but for some reason that little phrase
[1:23:42] stuck with me we don't have problems we
[1:23:46] only have
[1:23:49] situations so a little while
[1:23:52] back because this thing has just stuck
[1:23:54] with me I thought I'm going to look this
[1:23:56] up so I look up the definition of a
[1:24:00] problem I look up the definition of a
[1:24:03] situation I even Googled what's the
[1:24:05] difference between a problem and a
[1:24:09] situation what I could come up with is a
[1:24:14] problem is something that may or may not
[1:24:18] have an
[1:24:19] answer a problem might not have an
[1:24:22] answer to it there may not be a way of
[1:24:24] solving this
[1:24:26] problem there might be a way to solve
[1:24:28] the problem but the answer might not be
[1:24:31] what you're wanting it might not be a
[1:24:33] good outcome but that's the answer a
[1:24:35] problem could have more than one answer
[1:24:37] and it's hey take the lesser of the two
[1:24:41] evils it might not be this this might
[1:24:44] not be what you want to do and this
[1:24:45] might not but be what you want to do but
[1:24:48] these are the answers to the
[1:24:50] problem but a
[1:24:52] situation is something that can be
[1:24:57] changed and now you ask me what in the
[1:25:00] world does this have to do with me
[1:25:02] preaching to a dead bunny what does this
[1:25:05] have to do with the scriptures I was
[1:25:08] reading at the
[1:25:09] beginning and I'm going to tell you so
[1:25:13] there was a man by the name of
[1:25:15] Joshua that was in a
[1:25:18] battle and the sun started going
[1:25:22] down and this wasn't just a little
[1:25:24] scrimmage like I said this was a battle
[1:25:26] that they needed to end that
[1:25:28] today and as all the men start gathering
[1:25:31] around Joshua and they're saying the
[1:25:34] sun's going down Joshua these men are
[1:25:36] going to get away we're going to have to
[1:25:37] fight this battle tomorrow it might last
[1:25:40] another gay because they're going to
[1:25:41] regroup we got a big problem
[1:25:45] here but because
[1:25:47] Joshua knew the
[1:25:50] Creator he knew the one that created the
[1:25:54] son
[1:25:55] he knew the one that created the Earth
[1:25:57] he knew the one that created the moon he
[1:26:00] was able to look at those men and say no
[1:26:03] we don't have a problem we only have a
[1:26:07] situation that the Creator is able to
[1:26:11] change so I say to you son stand still
[1:26:16] I'm saying Moon don't move because I
[1:26:20] have a situation on my hand I cannot let
[1:26:23] the get dark I need to finish the battle
[1:26:26] today so God the creator of the heavens
[1:26:30] and earth that listened to the voice of
[1:26:33] a
[1:26:33] man changed the situation in a moment's
[1:26:40] time there was a story of a young man
[1:26:43] named
[1:26:44] David that was bringing food to his
[1:26:47] brothers and they were in a
[1:26:49] fight and as David walks up on this
[1:26:53] scene he he sees the children of
[1:26:57] Israel God's
[1:27:00] Army
[1:27:02] scared shaking in their
[1:27:05] sandals that's what he sees and he's
[1:27:08] wondering what is going
[1:27:10] on puts his stuff down and he hears this
[1:27:14] giant out
[1:27:16] here yelling threats to this Army and
[1:27:19] these men are scared to
[1:27:22] death and even Saul is telling him we've
[1:27:26] got a
[1:27:28] problem and David's
[1:27:30] like I'll go out
[1:27:32] there
[1:27:34] why he knew the
[1:27:37] Creator and as Saul tries to arm him
[1:27:40] with all this armor and all this stuff
[1:27:42] he get all this stuff off of me he takes
[1:27:44] a
[1:27:45] slingshot he walks over to a little
[1:27:48] creek to pick down pick up some
[1:27:52] Stones because the Creator that never
[1:27:56] misses a
[1:27:57] detail had put a boulder there years and
[1:28:01] years and years before knowing that the
[1:28:05] water from that Creek was going to keep
[1:28:07] pounding up against that Boulder and
[1:28:09] pounding up against that Boulder and
[1:28:12] hundreds of years later the water would
[1:28:14] break that Boulder down into five little
[1:28:18] smooth rocks that this young man David
[1:28:21] was going to need and as he picked those
[1:28:23] rocks up and he puts him in his pouch
[1:28:25] and he walks out onto the battlefield
[1:28:28] and Goliath is looking at this little
[1:28:30] guy like you've got to be kidding me
[1:28:31] right now this is what they sent out
[1:28:34] here I will put you on the end of my
[1:28:36] Spear and I will let the birds eat you
[1:28:39] you've got a problem little
[1:28:41] boy but because David knew the Creator
[1:28:46] he was able to look at Goliath and say
[1:28:48] no I don't have a problem I've only got
[1:28:52] a situation
[1:28:54] that he is more than able to change
[1:28:58] you're coming at me with a sword and a
[1:29:00] shield I come at you in the name of the
[1:29:02] host of the Lord and in a moment's time
[1:29:06] the situation changed because he was
[1:29:09] able to call on the
[1:29:15] Creator there's a story of a man named
[1:29:20] Lazarus that was
[1:29:22] dying his sister
[1:29:25] sent word to the
[1:29:28] Healer to Jesus
[1:29:30] Christ we need you to come this man your
[1:29:35] friend is
[1:29:37] dying and Jesus
[1:29:40] waits he waits a couple days and as he
[1:29:44] comes into the
[1:29:45] city Martha comes running to him if you
[1:29:49] would have only been
[1:29:51] here it's too late now but if you would
[1:29:55] have only been
[1:29:59] there you could have healed him the
[1:30:02] people standing around they know the
[1:30:05] Miracles that this man has performed
[1:30:07] this was his friend if he would have
[1:30:10] only been
[1:30:14] here I am the resurrection and
[1:30:17] life and he says believest Thou
[1:30:21] this believest thou this
[1:30:25] this is something that the ministers in
[1:30:28] the message those three words maybe they
[1:30:31] should get a hold of because there's a
[1:30:33] move in the message
[1:30:36] that's it's all about
[1:30:38] emotion if you jump up and down if you
[1:30:41] scream if you speak in tongues that's
[1:30:43] your evidence it's not the
[1:30:46] evidence he never ever said did you feel
[1:30:48] it he's never ever said did you feel it
[1:30:52] he said Do you believe it believest thou
[1:30:56] this the woman that touched the Hem of
[1:30:58] His Garment all those people touching
[1:31:01] him he's walking but all of a sudden he
[1:31:04] stopped he turned he didn't say because
[1:31:07] you felt it he said you are Faith
[1:31:11] because you believe
[1:31:14] it it's not about a feeling it's not
[1:31:17] about
[1:31:19] emotion I can feel the power of God
[1:31:21] right now I can feel I can feel him in
[1:31:24] this building right now but if I didn't
[1:31:27] feel one thing I would still know he was
[1:31:30] here because I believe this where two or
[1:31:34] three are gathered because I'm a
[1:31:38] Believer it's not about emotions and
[1:31:40] don't get me wrong I don't have a
[1:31:41] problem with emotions I'm getting
[1:31:42] emotional right
[1:31:45] now I don't have a problem with emotions
[1:31:47] but don't
[1:31:49] base everything on emotion don't base
[1:31:52] your experience on emotion
[1:31:55] it's not emotion do you
[1:31:59] believe so as Jesus stands there
[1:32:01] believest thou
[1:32:03] this moments after he says
[1:32:07] this he's found over
[1:32:10] weeping he's
[1:32:14] crying and the people are watching
[1:32:18] this he's got himself in a mess now he's
[1:32:21] never going to be able to forgive
[1:32:22] himself because he didn't
[1:32:25] come when they called
[1:32:30] him he didn't get here in
[1:32:32] time he's got a big problem now he's
[1:32:35] gonna have to live with this for the
[1:32:36] rest of his
[1:32:38] life but I love the way brother Bram
[1:32:41] talks about
[1:32:43] this as a man he was standing there his
[1:32:45] shoulders stooped over he was nothing to
[1:32:48] look at a little bitty man but when he
[1:32:51] stepped up to the tomb of
[1:32:54] and he squared up them shoulders all of
[1:32:57] a sudden he squared up CU he was ready
[1:32:59] to fight it didn't matter how long
[1:33:02] Lazarus had been dead it was not a
[1:33:05] problem it was only a situation that the
[1:33:09] Creator the one that created that man
[1:33:11] the one that gave that man life it was
[1:33:14] only a situation that he could change
[1:33:17] and give life back to that man
[1:33:24] it wasn't a problem it was just a
[1:33:29] situation so there I
[1:33:33] was little
[1:33:35] Lazarus laying on my
[1:33:41] Bible I just sincerely prayed for that
[1:33:44] little bunny a little Dead Bunny I
[1:33:48] picked him up out of that box he was
[1:33:49] still just as limp as he was the first
[1:33:54] day hadn't stiffened up his little eyes
[1:33:57] were
[1:33:58] closed all I could keep thinking about
[1:34:00] was he's just
[1:34:03] sleeping so I laid him there and I
[1:34:07] prayed and when I moved my hand
[1:34:10] back not one thing
[1:34:13] happened little Lazarus was still laying
[1:34:16] there just as dead as he
[1:34:18] was nothing
[1:34:21] happened I didn't understand that
[1:34:24] this and just being honest with you I
[1:34:27] got
[1:34:29] mad I got mad at this
[1:34:32] situation everything was piling up on
[1:34:36] me and I believe this I believe this
[1:34:40] with everything in
[1:34:42] me so why
[1:34:46] God why not let me have this little this
[1:34:50] little why not let me have this little
[1:34:51] moment why not let me have this little
[1:34:54] bunny the life of this little bunny that
[1:34:55] means nothing why
[1:34:58] not so I got angry and now it's time to
[1:35:01] go to
[1:35:02] church because it's Sunday
[1:35:05] morning so we get in the
[1:35:09] car my wife she can
[1:35:12] tell
[1:35:14] that I'm not good not saying
[1:35:19] anything Satan is in the back seat he's
[1:35:22] pulled himself right up got his hands on
[1:35:24] both my shoulders and he's just
[1:35:26] whispering in my
[1:35:28] ear is the word
[1:35:31] true because you just did everything it
[1:35:34] said to do and nothing
[1:35:37] happened or maybe you don't have the
[1:35:40] Holy Ghost maybe that's where the
[1:35:41] problem is or maybe it's
[1:35:44] both but he's talking to
[1:35:48] me and he's telling me it's a beautiful
[1:35:52] day out
[1:35:54] perfect day to go play
[1:35:56] golf and I'm driving to
[1:36:00] church and I
[1:36:02] mean everything he's
[1:36:05] saying it's
[1:36:07] right nothing he has said Is A
[1:36:13] Lie something took
[1:36:15] over in
[1:36:18] me something started driving that car
[1:36:21] and it wasn't
[1:36:22] me because something inside of me was
[1:36:26] going to go to
[1:36:27] church it was in that moment right there
[1:36:30] it was when I was at the end of my
[1:36:34] road but he stepped
[1:36:37] in I I couldn't go I Jonathan howchin
[1:36:41] couldn't go any further but he stepped
[1:36:45] in he said I'll carry you for a little
[1:36:48] bit he knew he had a servant that was in
[1:36:51] trouble
[1:36:54] he said 'i'll carry you for a little bit
[1:36:57] so we get to
[1:36:59] church I'm still
[1:37:03] mad I'm standing in the back back there
[1:37:06] not even inside the sanctuary back there
[1:37:09] back out in the entryway I'm standing
[1:37:12] back there the song service has started
[1:37:15] I'm talking to the deacons I looked at
[1:37:17] one of the deacons and said well I
[1:37:19] should probably go on in
[1:37:23] I sit
[1:37:25] down not singing any
[1:37:27] songs I'm really and truly sitting there
[1:37:30] thinking probably shouldn't even be in
[1:37:35] here sister gets up and sings a special
[1:37:38] one of my favorite
[1:37:41] songs
[1:37:43] nothing nothing I wouldn't give anything
[1:37:46] was
[1:37:47] upset was
[1:37:49] mad this did not work out the way I
[1:37:51] wanted it to
[1:37:54] brother Nathan comes out and he starts
[1:37:57] preaching his opening sermon opening
[1:38:02] scripture my wife looks over at
[1:38:05] me almost to say is like did you just
[1:38:08] hear what he
[1:38:09] said because it was Taylor Made For Me
[1:38:12] right then in that
[1:38:15] moment his title to his sermon was hope
[1:38:19] never heard a preach I've never heard a
[1:38:21] preacher preach on Hope before
[1:38:24] Faith yes not hope but as he starts to
[1:38:28] preach even his opening
[1:38:31] prayer it was as if he was praying for
[1:38:35] me right then in that
[1:38:37] moment as he starts to preach I've been
[1:38:40] in sermons and I'm sure you have too
[1:38:42] where the preacher says something and
[1:38:44] you're like wow man get out of my living
[1:38:46] room because that's what we were just
[1:38:48] talking
[1:38:49] about that might go on for five or 10
[1:38:52] minutes this was every every single line
[1:38:55] every word he was
[1:38:57] saying everything that he was saying
[1:39:01] pertain to my situation right then you
[1:39:04] can call me a liar if you
[1:39:06] want that's you're entitled to that I've
[1:39:11] never seen that before every single line
[1:39:14] everything he said was exactly
[1:39:17] pertaining to my
[1:39:20] situation the whole sermon and he ends
[1:39:23] his sermon and he begins to close in
[1:39:25] prayer and in his closing prayer it's as
[1:39:29] if he was praying for
[1:39:30] me he hadn't got done praying and I was
[1:39:33] already on my way to the altar because I
[1:39:36] knew I had messed
[1:39:39] up he just took an hour of his time
[1:39:41] eight billion people on this planet he
[1:39:43] just took an hour of his time to talk
[1:39:45] directly to me for an hour straight
[1:39:49] without stopping I'm heading to the
[1:39:51] altar I'm at the altar for like 45
[1:39:56] minutes I get
[1:39:58] up I turn around I see brother Nathan
[1:40:01] never seen this happen before he's
[1:40:03] sitting all the way in the back corner
[1:40:04] where this sister with the blonde hair
[1:40:06] is he's sitting back there he looks as
[1:40:08] discouraged as anybody I've ever seen in
[1:40:10] my
[1:40:11] life I walk back there he say I've never
[1:40:15] felt so much push back on a sermon in
[1:40:17] all my
[1:40:18] life the man suffered through a sermon
[1:40:21] and I mean he suffered
[1:40:23] for
[1:40:24] me wasn't nothing he could do about it
[1:40:28] because there was a
[1:40:31] creator that had a servant that wasn't
[1:40:34] doing too good and he needed to talk to
[1:40:37] that servant for a little
[1:40:40] while later on that
[1:40:43] evening we had a guest minister in
[1:40:46] brother
[1:40:47] Diego brother Diego comes in he starts
[1:40:49] preaching on a
[1:40:52] moment a moment in time that you will
[1:40:56] have but that you need to have the Holy
[1:40:59] Ghost to understand when that moment
[1:41:05] is so in that course of that day brother
[1:41:09] Nathan's sermon he gets up he starts
[1:41:14] preaching and where Satan was saying his
[1:41:17] word's not
[1:41:18] true brother Nathan's Sermon Just
[1:41:21] obliterated that brother Diego gets up
[1:41:24] behind him starts talking about when
[1:41:27] that moment comes you need the Holy
[1:41:29] Ghost to know when that moment
[1:41:32] is Satan telling me maybe you don't have
[1:41:34] the Holy Ghost let's get rid of
[1:41:40] that he
[1:41:42] used the very thing I was questioning to
[1:41:46] answer my
[1:41:48] question as those two brothers were
[1:41:50] preaching the one thing that kept coming
[1:41:51] to my mind was 1 Corinthians
[1:41:55] 1:21 for after that in the wisdom of God
[1:41:59] the World by wisdom knew not God it
[1:42:02] pleased God by the foolishness of
[1:42:06] preaching to save them that
[1:42:10] believe he used the thing I was
[1:42:13] questioning he said here you go I'm
[1:42:16] right here I'm right here with you you
[1:42:20] want something that nobody can explain
[1:42:22] away somebody explained that to
[1:42:25] me he gave me the very thing that I was
[1:42:28] looking for if I would have just waited
[1:42:30] on
[1:42:32] him but because it didn't happen the way
[1:42:34] I wanted it to happen I got
[1:42:38] angry but he had a
[1:42:41] servant he knows he knew and he knows
[1:42:45] that I'm a Believer it didn't matter
[1:42:48] what happened I'm a Believer in this
[1:42:54] yeah but he was stepped in and he
[1:42:58] carried me for a little
[1:43:02] bit my vocabulary is not big enough to
[1:43:05] tell you guys how important Having the
[1:43:07] Holy Ghost
[1:43:08] is in those moments when you get when
[1:43:11] you get in those moments right there
[1:43:13] where you're at the end of your
[1:43:16] rope the pastor is not going to carry
[1:43:19] you an evangelist
[1:43:23] it won't
[1:43:24] matter you need
[1:43:28] him he's the only one in those moments
[1:43:32] right there you better be anchored into
[1:43:33] something more than just a church you
[1:43:36] better be anchored into something more
[1:43:38] than just a message or more than a
[1:43:39] prophet you better be anchored into the
[1:43:42] Rock Jesus Christ because I'm telling
[1:43:44] you when those moments come when those
[1:43:46] Storms Come they will knock you down and
[1:43:50] if you're not anchored into something
[1:43:52] more than just your
[1:43:55] church you won't get back
[1:43:58] up that Holy Ghost is so
[1:44:01] important so many people in would have
[1:44:04] looked at that in that situation and
[1:44:07] they would have thought I had a real
[1:44:09] problem but for him it was only a
[1:44:13] situation it was only a situation that
[1:44:16] he could
[1:44:18] change in a moment
[1:44:23] out by the name of Daniel in the
[1:44:26] Bible he gotten himself into a the the
[1:44:30] the the some men had come to the king
[1:44:32] you guys know the
[1:44:34] story they
[1:44:36] had tricked the king into declaring a a
[1:44:40] proclamation That Couldn't pray and
[1:44:42] Daniel gets caught praying and they
[1:44:44] throw him in the Lion's Den and they
[1:44:46] were good friends the king and Daniel
[1:44:48] were good
[1:44:49] friends even the king thought
[1:44:54] I've got a problem here I got a real
[1:44:57] problem
[1:44:58] here but the next
[1:45:00] morning when he yelled down to Daniel
[1:45:03] are you still
[1:45:05] there
[1:45:07] yes this was only a
[1:45:10] situation that my God was able to shut
[1:45:13] the mouths of the Lions was just a
[1:45:16] situation that was able that he was able
[1:45:18] to change
[1:45:23] yes Lord story of the the three the
[1:45:26] three children of Israel that are about
[1:45:29] to be thrown into a
[1:45:30] fire how often does this happen with
[1:45:34] us he's always in that
[1:45:38] fire everybody was looking at that
[1:45:40] situation thinking what a problem but it
[1:45:43] wasn't a problem it was only a situation
[1:45:46] it was just a situation that could be
[1:45:48] changed there was a man by the name of
[1:45:50] Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] he came and he lived a life of
[1:45:56] misery he could have had a wife he could
[1:46:00] have had a house he could have had nice
[1:46:03] clothes but he said I sanctify them
[1:46:06] myself for their sake he lived a life of
[1:46:10] misery and then he died on a cross for
[1:46:17] us and as Satan looking at that
[1:46:20] situation thinking I've got him now now
[1:46:24] he's got a problem but we're talking
