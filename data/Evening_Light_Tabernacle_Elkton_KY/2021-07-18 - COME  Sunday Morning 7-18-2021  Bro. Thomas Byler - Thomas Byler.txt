========================================

so foreign you thank good morning brothers we'll just all stand this morning maybe brother brad will open us in prayer foreign and the children can be dismissed for sunday school and if we'll go to the psalms here psalms 143. psalms 143 hear my prayer oh lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works a muse on the work of my hands hear me speedily oh lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for their righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant amen god bless you may be seated brother brian good morning brothers and sisters i can't read it that way if you would turn with me to the 44th song you know that second verse that's the previous psalm we read you kind of goes with what brother thomas was talking about on wednesday and the other ministers that have been coming through knowing yourself you can't justify yourself and when god looks at you he knows you can't justify yourself in anything it's only by god's grace through salvation through his son that any man or any woman or any child could ever be justified before god so it's nothing i do or you do it's what god does for us and uh i'll read the this 44th psalm here i was going through my notes out at the in my office and i think it was like in the middle 2007 to that i was actually looking through my notes and i was i had that psalm book here and for a year or two i was going for all the different psalms you know i was going through my notes and somehow i had the 43rd psalm in my notes and i had the 45th psalm i didn't have this 44th but i was just thinking this morning uh this psalm actually speaks for the day that we're in right now and it's not a very long psalm as i read it and this is what uh this is what it has to say we heard with our ears oh god our fathers have told us what works thou didst in their days in the times of old so you all no different here this morning you have the message of the hour you have all the books from the time of christ until this day that we live in right now you have all the histories you have the foxes book of martyrs you have all the writings from the last two thousand plus years so this affects us just as much as it did to children of israel you have examples you have stories you have all the truth as that's been revealed that you can go back to and he goes on to say here how did this thou drive out the heathen with our hand and planets them that how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out for they got not the land in possession by their own sword needed their their own arm save them but by thy right hand and thy arm and the light of thy continents because thou had his favor onto them so the psalmist was saying here that it wasn't the strength of the israelis that conquered the land it was god through the israelis that conquered the land for him and it's the same way with everyone sitting here this morning you know you don't conquer any anything in yourself and and uh in the world we live in that's i was writing this down this morning there's always a negative and a positive in anything in life whatever you do there's always gonna in in relationships when you're dealing with people or in governments or in anything there's always going to be a positive and negative and i just wrote some examples you know the first example that the children of israel were given is positive and a negative you know they were in deuteronomy they were given that law there was a law a life and a law of death and you have to choose this morning which law you're going to follow whether you're going to follow the law of life or you're going to spurn that law and live under death every man woman and child has to make that decision this morning which law are you going to put first in your life and it comes into the day that we live and are you going to put god's word first or are you going to put what other people tell you first and another law you know it it we faces we have uh we have the new testament and it's a law to ourselves too it gives you principles to live by and principles not to live by and yet again this morning all of us have to make a choice on what principles we're going to live by you know i can't make them for you i can't make i can only make them for myself and you're gonna everyone sitting here this morning is either living under a negative light or living under a positive light that's your choice though this morning no one put you in that place you chose to be in that place yourself and uh there and then brother branham always talked about you know there's a false vine and a and a true vine there's twins there's an evil twin and there's a good twin and everyone you know you deal with people in life you know you you'll come across a good family that has had all kinds of good things in their life and that's that good family you'll get that one guy that you wonder where he came from that bad that bad apple in the bunch that's just the way life is and then also you know there's a true vine in the bat bad vine there's a false church and there's a real church you know and then and it's simply there's honest men and there's evil men i mean that's just the way life and i lost my place as i was talking here but uh it's the fourth verse thou art my king oh god command deliverance for jacob through thee will we push down our enemies and through thy name we will tread them under that rise up against us for i will put not trust in my bow neither my sword save me so we can't trust them our own strength you know i i say this a lot i'm one of them guys if i'm not careful i'll just trust in my own strength and my own abilities to get something done instead of just waiting on god to do it for me and i'll go on to saying seventh verse but thou has saved us from our enemies and thou has put them to shame that hated us and god we boast all day long and praise thy name for sailor now in any psalm or in any scriptures there's always a good and a bad there's a negative and a positive and he as we're going to start switching here to the negative side and he goes on to say in the night first but that was cast off and put us to shame goes not forth with our armies and i was thinking that's where we're at this morning and you know there's a very that picture back there i've said it before in in the age that we live in right if you look back on that circle there you don't see no light at all and that's where we're at the only light like i said a couple of weeks ago is the light that you reflect that god gives you to reflect in the world that we live this morning and that's the only light that they're going to see is your light as you reflect and get around other people they see what god's done for you and where you're at this morning and he goes on to say thou makes us to turn back from the enemy and they which had a spoil for themselves thou has given us like sheep appointed for meat and hath scattered us among the heathen you know when the church went through this and you go through the seventh church age book you go through the seven seals where brother brown talks about you know the church started good it had a place where it fell and then come back and now we're in a place where the church has fallen again if you're not in this word and for this hour out there there's no hope there's just blackness out there there's just darkness so to leave this what are you going to when you leave this what is out there to leave for there there's really nothing to leave for and he goes on to say uh i lost my place here it is thou has given us like the sheep appointed for meat and that scattered us among the heathen thou sell us thy people for not does not increase their wealth by their price thou makes us a reproach to our neighbors a scorn and an aversion to them that are around the battles thou makes us a byword among the heathen and a shaking of the head among the people well that's what the mainline church i mean the heathen they just laugh at the mainline church there's no power in those churches out there i mean they talk a good talk but they have nothing to back it up so he just make fun of him out there nowadays and he goes you go my confusion is continually before me the shame of my face hath covered me for the voice of him that reproaches and blessed femeth by the reason of the enemy and the avenger and that really i mean there's just blasting me all over the world nowadays but they unless they see the power of jesus christ in you there's it's nothing going to change people unless they see christ in you this morning and it goes on all this has come upon us yet we have not forgotten me neither have we dealt falsely in the covenant and it's switching here it's even in that in the days of israel there was always a remnant that worshipped the living god the way he wanted to be worse in the age that we're in this morning there's that remnant among us that knows the true god and is worshiping the true god the correct way and and he goes on to say our heart has not turned back neither of our steps declined from their way though thou has so broken us in places of dragons and covered us with shadow of death if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god you know and you know many ministers come in and talk about this you know you can make anything in your life god you can say you're a christian and worship something else if you're not careful so i mean it's real you can you know i have to be careful you can make your job your god you can make your entertainment your god you can make you can make anything of god that you put before christ every day that you'll choose to do this before you do that and he goes on to say we have forgotten the name of our god and stretch our hands to a strange god shall not god churches search this out for he knows the secrets of of the heart gave for thy sake are we killed all the day long and we are counted as sheep for the slaughter awake thou sleepers thou o lord arise stress out us not off forever wherefore hit us thou thy face and forget us to our inflictions and our oppressions for our souls is bowed down to the dust our body cleaveth upon the earth arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercy's sake it's just really simple this morning you know i say that everyone here came here for whatever purpose you came here for this morning don't don't leave until you know that god has spoke to you if he hasn't spoke to you in the last couple days uh you know i as i see the world out there you know and and people it just lets me know that their only hope i have i'm i can never say this you know the only hope i have is in christ outside of that there's you know there's no hope the only joy that you can have i can see in the world if you listen to the news out there or you listen to people out there they'll steal your joy they only you need to just listen to what god's urge you to do and do what he tells you to do and just keep that in your heart brother david hey man you love him with all your heart this morning let's stand and sing that little course all my hope is in jesus this morning if we could all my hope is in jesus well thank god my yesterday's gone [Music] all my sins are [Applause] [Music] forgiven aren't you thankful for that this morning and all my hope is in jesus well thank god yesterday's gone [Music] my sins are forever oh i been washed by the blood

with jesus oh i gave him all of my heart and i thought i couldn't love him more then i did right from the start as i look back over the mountains and the valleys where i've been and it makes me know why i love [Music] falling in love with him over and over and over and over again oh he gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by oh what a love between my lord and i i keep falling in love with him

internet god bless you this morning and just appreciate the lord this morning and uh just loving with all the heart and it's good to have sister elizabeth here with us and i don't see anyone else visiting it looks like all home folks this morning but god bless you this morning and and i don't know why this song oh i want to see him i wrote down three different numbers on that and i still didn't get it right but i knew the song and uh this morning brother steve he always kids me when i have this tie on he said well we're going to have a good song service this morning and i i began to think as the battle raged this morning my computer didn't want to cooperate and and if there's anyone that's they printed that book for computer book for dummies that they did it for me and i thought you know i'm not going to get frustrated this morning just if it works it works if not i still know how to write i'll write it out we're good everything's okay so it did it again so then i hit a button and it started erasing everything so i just closed it out went over and i thought well lord you know and then some other things happened this morning i thought wow we're going to have an awesome service this morning because it's just been nothing but a battle how many knows when it's a battle when you're trying to go to church sometimes you think i'm going to a good place why would there be a battle that's the reason the devil doesn't want you to get what god has in store for you today amen so if you've had a battle this morning say well satan i'm here and i'm ready to fight amen oh i want to see him this morning amen well as i journey through the land singing as i go and pointing souls to calvary to that crimson floor where many arrows pitch my soul from without with but my lord leads me on and through him i must wait i know i wanna see him just look [Music] [Music] [Music] but i cling more close to him [Music] [Music] just look up on his face [Music] [Music] facts i'll be home at last ever to rejoice and win this highly slow i love sorting them out let me hold [Music] [Music] [Music] forever [Music] oh my [Music] and my lord directs my [Music] oh he's a real friend to me i know [Music] grace and on the streets of glory won't let me lift my bones will care i'll be home my last [Music] saving grace on the streets let me live [Music] never pray at your heart's desire to sing this morning brother brian brother brad brother jeff would you come take up the offering this morning and we have some prayer requests this morning brother joe texted me that sister hannah had heard her back and asked that we'd remember her in prayer this morning and also uh brother jeff asked that we remember keith o'donnell oh daniel excuse me he's possibly going to have to have open heart surgery and i know brother jeff and brother john and myself and i think brother brad probably knows him rusty jackson he's also logs and his wife jessica jackson's in the hospital and she needs a touch from the lord this morning so they asked that we'd remember her in prayer this morning so if you if you have any on your heart you might let it be known but up left hand and remember our shout-outs this morning sister peggy the different ones this morning that god will move on their behalf brother brian would you pray with offering these needs this morning oh amen amen higher ground this morning amen man are you pressing on this morning i'm pressing on the upward waves new high time days every day [Music] lord plant my feet lord lift me up and let me stand my faith on lord my heart has no [Music] desires these [Music] [Applause] [Music] and let me stand by faith on head the unstable land to a higher place [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want to scale they are no sign and catch a gleam a glory bride but still i'll pray to heaven [Applause] [Music] too high [Applause] [Applause] [Music] than i had amen is that your heart's desire this morning i know that's the way you're singing this morning and the little folks are gonna sing or the young folks i should say i don't know how little some of them are but anyways amen let's sing that the first verse of that jesus hold my hand as they come this morning well as i travel through this field from land there is with me [Music] [Music] blessed jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] here [Music] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] just [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] this is [Music] let it shine [Applause] sorry now he was patting that foot i thought maybe that'll help me stay in rhythm so i learned something this morning from brother jonathan this morning maybe i can stay in amen amen we're going to have a testimony this morning brother thomas said brother aaron had something in his heart so we'll ask him come this morning goodbye in the house of lord this morning so so before i start i would like to just go ahead and give the lord a round of applause because you know i've not been trying to get a truck for probably a month now and it's been a little bit but you know the lord stepped in and gave me i was supposed to get a ten thousand dollar loan from the bank but instead of ten thousand they gave me the full amount for the truck so i'm just gonna go ahead and give the lawyer a rental [Applause] so on my last testimony i said that i overcame a battle i've been going through which i didn't and so but this is a battle that i went through probably two to three years uh it's been pretty much war with it and you know i'm a little nervous this morning my legs shaking so i guess i'm a little nervous but uh it's been a war and i forgot i forgot my phone i was going to show you a video that it's a place that it led me to it's i used to have tick tock and this video it is a place that it led me to but it's on tech talk i don't know if i can find it let me see if i can find it so it's got music playing in the background but i guess just ignore that part but this is a place that it led me to i need prayers i don't know if i'm i'm good enough to make it in the rapture not i've done so many things wrong you know i just won't let y'all know that no i mean i haven't always been the best of a christian i know i've been acting like a christian haven't been i just want to ask that maybe like this video to let me know that you're listening um and pray for me probably become the pray that i can be willing more willing to be a christian and more proud that i can be more willing to let go of the things that that i have not been able to let go before me it means a lot so that was one of the videos that i made i started in that video because you know i felt like i was so low and felt like i was so uh not a christian that it just made me feel so bad and this led me to places to where i felt like i was going to leave the message and if it wasn't for the grace of god i would have but you know today you know i went to byc i think it was not this week last week but last week and i think i pre one of the preachers so we had brother uh which is andrew glover preaching for us he said you know when you give a testimony it uh breaks the date as devil's back so i'm breaking his back this morning but oh well so i don't really care if he likes it or not i'm gonna give a testimony whether he likes it or not so when i went to byc and now i'm free i'm a free man this morning even though i'm unworthy and undeserving i know that i've done things but i'm free this morning [Applause] let's stand well thank god i am free free free from this world of sin for i've been washed in the blood of jesus i've been born again [Music] i'm so glad that i found out he would bring me out show me the way like a bird out of prison [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] he oh thank god i am free free free from this world [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he would bring me [Music] amen are you happy you're free this morning amen appreciate with aaron's testimony and you know it's not just his but it's all of us no matter how long you've been serving the lord it's still your heart's desire to grow closer to him and to be better and you know i always i was chuckling the other day and i thought you know if brother branham's worst enemy was him wow what about me i've really got problems brother joe big problems think lord a prophet would stand there and say when he gets up in the morning his worst enemy is himself lord help me i need help today amen i don't know about you but i do and i know i know one thing we live in a very fast-moving world everything's in a hurry and i have found out that every time i let the enemy convince me that i don't have time to pray or time to read guess what i had plenty of time because i'm gonna have troubles but they just multiply and i think all you you just had to be in a hurry you had to be here no we have to be here in god's presence that way no matter what comes our way good bad indifferent he's in control i want him in control of my life this morning amen let's sing that course is brother thomas comes this morning shut in with god in a secret place is that your heart's desire this morning not an evening light tabernacle to shut in with god this morning amen with god [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] to run in [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time [Music] in the spirit [Music] hey [Music] hallelujah does that make you feel good amen god bless you this morning good morning good to be back in the house of the lord thank you musicians appreciate it greatly amen your work for the lord amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord this morning amen we still have a few of them that i'd like to see coming back and i think it'll happen so amen we just thank for each and everybody this morning sister elizabeth god bless you amen good to see you serenity and amen say love this morning in the house of the lord that's good to you amen praise god say amen well god is just good how many loves you let's bow our heads this morning lord jesus we come before you this morning lord with the one purpose in our heart father and that is to glorify you lord to lift your name up to brag about you lord and father to just honor you and respect you lord jesus for the respect and honor that's due to your name we ask god that you once again bless our gathering together in your name we know father that we believe with all of our heart wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst and we thank you lord jesus so much for that father for if we didn't have you we would be of all men most miserable and lord we ask god that you'll just take the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak on and say what you once said father help me just to get out of the way and help me not to say anything that would be in myself but just what the spirit would say father bless every effort of every person here this morning god lord jesus of coming into your house lord prepare their hearts their prayers and lord their preparation father to hear from you lord and now god as we change the order of service from singing and so forth to your word we ask god that you would just bless us lord with what you want to say in jesus name amen and amen so just trying to follow the leading of the spirit trying to listen to his voice amen um uh we want to go this morning amen and let's turn our bibles i think we'll go to luke if you will luke 14. and this is certainly something that i've preached on before but perhaps we can just get a little bit further or a little bit more enlightenment from it i mean that's usually what i appreciate about the lord it's not about whether you know something it's about whether the lord can take you a little bit deeper in what you have already amen so let's go to luke 14 and we'll begin with verse 16. then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come all for all things are ready now and my title this morning is just going to be that word come amen that all right come for all things are ready now and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i've bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excuse and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant came and showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servants go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in thither the poor the mane the halt and the blind and the servants said lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the lord said to the servant go into the highways and to the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bitten shall taste of my supper amen may god of his blessings to reading your word you can be seen seated i want to also turn to john i'm going to go and read this over here in john saint john 19 and verse 30. when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost this is the only book out of the four books where he's where it says that he said this all the others were pretty much my god without forsaking me or it is different things that they said but this is the only place where he said it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave up the ghost here it says that it was the very last words jesus said before dying amen and it might seem kind of simple to us but i believe it had a great bearing don't you i think it had to mean a lot for him to say it's finished what's finished and that right we would ask ourselves well what is finished what's finished amen in the old testament we know that humanity and man as a whole whether it was david or whether it's solomon or whoever it was how many knows they were born with a natural sinful nature right and there was never no way to escape that never any way to get away from that right man was so to speak condemned isn't that right uh they were without hope in the world there was no way for them to get back to god you know and uh in order after adam finley in order for man to actually ever be united with god again it was going to have to be up to god to make a way for man to come back into relationship with him again isn't that right so there was a great responsibility up to this point there was a responsibility that god had of making a way for us now right he was going to make a way now uh we know that through the preaching of the gospel perhaps we'll detail some things this morning but it doesn't matter whether it was calvin knox mooney it doesn't matter who it is and our redemption and our way back and everything goes and it points back to what the cross right at the cross at the cross it's all about that cross it was about what happened on the cross because without that happening nothing was ever going to be possible for any of us [Music] it's just not going to be happening you know but here something was happening and jesus of course we know that he struggled he labored and so forth amen and he took uh upon his our sin upon him and he went through the battle the greatest battle he ever went through in the garden of gethsemane of whether he was going to go through with this or not and if it be possible let this cup pass from me and and so when you think about uh the king of glory coming into humanity coming and becoming a man amen and and you know you just find that you know when when you have a rich person when you have a rich person they don't tolerate very much is that right because they think of themselves way too highly to put up with much of your mess they'll take you to court i don't know what all they'll do but they tend not to put up with too much all right because they think they're a somebody but when we think about almighty god the king of glory becoming humanity amen and getting spit upon in that rock getting false accused getting his beard plucked out getting mocked getting scorched all of these things that he did right when you think about what he did for you and for me amen that's the thing that he would be able to do is be the very king of all glory could humble himself to calvary and to death and we'll never know we'll never know you'll never know outside of somehow god divinely when we perhaps go over there allow you to see i don't know that he ever will this is total presumption pre-ops to let you know what kind of suffering that he suffered how bad he suffered as a man amen because i think brother he taught that uh you know that even signs from what i understand that when you suffer so much your water separates from your blood your blood and water separate amen i don't understand all of that that had to be some severe excruciating suffering that he did we know it was disappointment beyond comprehension he came to his own his own received him not not only did they not receive him not only those who he had chosen so forth and not we understand that his own children are the one that crucified him i don't know about how you would feel of you as a dad and your own children to crucify you you know we can't like i said we can't comprehend perhaps the suffering that he went through but he suffered and he had to go through a big battle a great battle for you and i amen and so when we think about that the king of glory coming down becoming man king of kings humbling himself to the cross when he could have spoken to many legions of angels and changed the whole thing amen but he went through great battles he did many things and taught us and so forth but there the very end their last words that come out of his mouth were that it was finished it's done praise be to god all right it's done what's done the price is paid the work for god is finished his part is accomplished no doubt jesus knew what this meant he knew what it meant it meant that we're going to be able to have a service like this 2 000 years later us way here at the end of laodicea are still going to love the lord god more than anything else in the world amen it meant so much that it is finished it just comes to mind compare it is finished to verse 17 of luke 14 where it says and he sent his servant at supper time to say unto them that were red that were bitten come for all things are now ready it's finished and it's ready hallelujah so the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that made a supper and the cry went out whosoever will let him come is that right you know and the thing of it is here i want to just rephrase it whosoever wants to whosoever whoever wants to let him come i like that god opens his arm says look the work's done now anybody that wants to come on come on compare that with revelations 22. and 17 says the spirit and the bride say come let him to hear us say and let him that is the thirst come amen brother brennan makes a statement he says you know if jesus was standing tonight here in my suit that he gave me amen he couldn't heal you scripturally speaking he couldn't heal you why because he's already done it you might say why he says he would tell you i did it at calvary hallelujah you say well he could heal me no he could not unless you believed it for many works he could not do in his hometown because of their unbelief so there are things that god cannot do why because it's hinged upon his law and upon his word already that you have to accept it just the other day i wanted to pull it up didn't have time to but brother man talks about he says you can come to the altar and you can repent of your sin and you can call upon god till you're 90 years old and you'll never get nowhere unless you accept what he done amen you have to accept what he already did that's what jesus said basically in my words my part is finished this part is finished he has supplied what we have need of he has made the supper boy there are a lot of illustrations we can pull from this for one thing is people don't want to come you know what he was having trouble with all of the good folks all the pharisees all the scribes all of those people he invited them first first he went to the house of israel and tried to get them to come but they would not they were too busy with their churches they were too busy with their doctrine they were too busy with their uh creeds of man and everything else and i wanted to say this because i want to say it later but i'm going to say it now on the day of judgment all people will have is excuses they'll only have an excuse that's all they'll have why because he supplied everything so they can't say it wasn't there huh it was there amen and all they can offer well and it'll be an excuse amen so you think about that it'll be just an excuse so the first his children his friends and relatives first he invited them they could not come they had an excuse and then the second he says men go out there in the highways in the streets and compel people to come on compel them to come in compel them to come to me [Music] amen i'm gonna read you over there's one more time that jesus says it's finished he called it it is done revelation 16 and verse 15 it says be called as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth his garments least he walked naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel paul poured out his vial upon the air and there were great voices out of the temple and out of heaven and from the throne saying it is not amen it's not the only time that god's going to say it is done i like that it's finished it's over listen to this and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since man were upon the earth so mighty and earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities plural i guess it's called more than one and the cities of the nations fell folks this little condo apartment place falling in florida is not going to be nothing compared to the cities that are going to fall all of those big scrap scrapers are coming down yeah all the glory of man all those beautiful cities is all going to be shaken all going to die like rats why because they didn't come they refused to come can i make another statement this morning you are this is really the subject this morning is to find out what condition we're in huh don't you think it's good for us to ask ourselves what condition are you in a doctor on looking at anybody to find out what your condition is i believe the holy spirit's doing that this morning what is your condition now i want to make this statement that whatever condition you're in is the condition that you want to be [Music] don't give me no excuses he's made a way whosoever will you want to if you want to you can come amen can cast all your cares upon him come unto me you who are weary and heavy lady i will give you rest so if you're in a condition of no rest it's because you want to be amen pretty strong but it's the truth in other words it's a place where you can't blame god because he did his part up to it is finished he had a responsibility it was our god but now it's not on god anymore why because he finished it he got this up already he made a way now it's on us it's on humanity praise be to god amen there's a whole lot there for all of us is that right don't blame me i'm not jesus amen you can't come and say brother bible heal me of this help me no you got to get on your knees and you got to ask jesus to help you well it's not your church no it's not the people around you it's not your wife it's not your husband no it ain't nobody's fault don't blame nobody but yourself you're your biggest enemy it's your relationship with god not you and your wives you're your husbands or your brothers or your sisters or your preachers amen so he turned the corner he was turning a corner amen now jesus was going to come into a new place into a place where he begins to say blessed are they that want to come blessed are they that do hunger and thirst am i right after righteousness for thee that's awful quiet they shall be filled now you're at the place that you can't get filled brother mother i'm just about a quarter field i got an eighth of a tank i better get to the gas station huh can i say something brother tommy you know if you've only got an eighth of a gas tank only eight you're eight full you know what that means you're full of hot air more than you are gas the rest of your tank is filled with air emptiness are you with me that's right that you're more empty than you are full that's the problem with christians this morning come on folks praise the lord i how many wants to be full i don't want to be i don't want to be a court i don't want to pay i want to be full because our prophet taught us what he says you're going to be full of something you're going to be filled with something and if the gas goes out air comes in i don't want to be filled with nothingness i want to be filled with god now let me ask you this how many knows that god himself told brother ben put these messages on tape make tapes record this because people down the road are going to need it so that when brother thomas comes along brother brad comes along or some other preacher comes along you'll know whether they're telling the truth or not you'll have food to eat and what did he see he saw cabbage and lettuce and tomato oh ribeye steak i don't care if it's a team of all kinds of good meat all kinds of good food i'll tell you church evening light tabernacle we're in bad shape if every time a preacher comes by he's got to come and preach you to repent and get filled with the holy ghost is that the state you're in empty places place that you always gotta get right whatever happened walk with god whatever happened with the daily walking with thee i know we got us we got little things you know but i'm talking about i'm not those little things that you do you make that right the second you do it isn't that right oh my i don't want us brandon we talked about he said you know i don't see nothing hindering the coming of the lord outside of the readiness of the bride well guess how many guess what we somebody got to be getting ready we're pretty late here down the road how many this morning will believe that you are the one that is going to be ready he was talking about you you talking about me being ready all right so let's think about this he begin to say things like blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled oh my now it's on us now it's on humanity and aren't you glad god put something down in there to first with if you're not happy when you get away from the lord and all you get miserable you ought to dance a jig why because there's something in there telling you you ain't right you need to get right the rest are happy not being right they don't ever want to be right so this morning if you're not filled with peace that passes understanding it's not god's fault he's got it on the table for you if you can't run around the tree once in a while i like mowing my lawn i get a lot of my messages mowing the lawn and just thinking about the lord is where i got my message to think about the lord i want to pull that little break on and put that little button down and hallelujah my wife i got that boy hooked up with this went down crazy he didn't dig around the lawnmower why just the presence of god amen just to think about these things to think about how that he has said it is done and how did he said peter says you know draw nigh to god and god will not die to you there you are now it's time and god is waiting now for you make your move he made his move make your move oh he's drawn neither us now we have to draw an eye to him praise the lord god cared and he stretched out his arm he cared for us [Applause] nice oh my listen god cares he said he showed us he showed the world that he cares god cares oh my god cared for daniel when daniel cared for god's word enough to pray sincerely no matter what the king said praise be to god that's right that you cared then god cared the three hebrew children cared and god care if you care god will care more hallelujah aren't you glad for that [Applause] god loves when you do something for him we want god to do everything god do this and god do that we pray and say god i need this and god need that a lot of times we just make him a servant boy he's not your servant he's your lord he's your savior he's your god how about coming and saying oh how about entering his gates with thanksgiving in our heart enter his courts with praise amen so this is what he says god cares but you've got to care first is it okay to say this god cared now he's done until he says you care he wants to see what you'll do he did something nice look at how you respond oh my we are a privileged people this morning we are a blessed people this morning [Music] because why because of what god has made available at the table we are blessed because of what god has made available at the table and there ain't a thing that he has not made available to us he fixed the full course meal for us there's no no way that we have to live below our privileges as a christian i don't care if you're paul and you ain't got but a coat to wear and you're in the inner prison somewhere on a cold dark stormy night amen as long as you've got god you have got a prison buster and then those those walls of shake god get you out of there you're blessed joy unspeakable joy unspeakable and full of glory most of us got joy not speakable joy what's joy is that some kind of a dish liquid or something but it says that joy unspeakable and full of glory not half full but paul it's there for us just stay seated now don't get too happy about this but it's there for you it's right here you can have it right now from what i understand jesus is sitting on the throne on his intercessory box he's interceding for everybody the chinese on the other side of the world the russians and it doesn't matter who he's on the intercessor box you need something i'm here for you but you can have joy on spiegel every one of these things are made accessible but one of these ways when he gets up when he leaves that box it's done people will come to the altar or they'll come to church on sunday the preacher will preach he'll preach that they're still there they'll come to the altar but they won't get a thing they will not get a thing huh wouldn't be a terrible place to be amen even as a sinner you cry come up here and you pray and you don't get it isn't that terrible a terrible feeling like you didn't get a thing it'll be terrible but then no matter how much they try it won't be available anymore can we say he'll say supper is now being ended this summer is over and he'll say who came let's see who is who come other thing i draw from this parable is that there's always room there's still and yet he said there's room get people to come in i want my place full that got me into thinking about the parish i wonder how many peop how many million christians are going to be in heaven how many is going to be there you don't know do you that's a wise ques i mean that's written because nobody knows but it'll be a hundred 200 300 million will it be a billion i don't know but god says there's still plenty of room and i'll tell you this right now i don't know about you but i want to be one let me be one of them let you be another one there's still more room but in this case with the supper table amen there's still more aren't you glad that you don't have to do like you did with the ten brothers and ten sisters and quickly grab for that piece of meat loaf quickly grab for that last dish of mashed potatoes because it's just about no huh you ain't got to do that at god's table it's always full it's all you want hallelujah comes to mind i shouldn't remember the scripture as much as i quoted where he says come unto me all ye that thirst come to me and buy a food and so forth and drink and let your soul enlighten itself in yeah we know the word well don't we fatness let your soul delight itself in fatness we need more fat people around here brother farage hey we're on the scriptural side of things spiritually right brother don't put that us on us so natural we're working hard to get rid of some of that that's right fatness amen let your soul delight itself come no money no price just come and eat it amen aren't you glad that we're living in that era of grace that time of grace amen the service this morning is good as what you want it to be [Applause] the preacher is as good as you want him to be just depends on how hungry you really are there may be people here this morning say brother i really gots a lot of that was so good somebody else might go say well it was just brother balor preaching to people happy again huh well i'll tell you what you can't give what you ain't got so if i'm a little happy and you get a little that's all right isn't it because we got a lot to be happy about [Music] a quote comes to my brain right now is that okay what did brother branham say about happiness we ought to be there let's give the lord a hand thank you jesus we ought to be the happiest people in the universe in the world the happiest people why because of what happened on calvary amen i'm glad for what happened on calvary i'm glad oh my don't get me going this is better than a big old horse just slobber on that alfalfa i'm about to spit everywhere more i think about it why just think about it i mean if you want to change your life just start thinking on the right things what i say wednesday show me what you think about it all the time and i'll show you who you are as a man thinks in his heart so easy start thinking on the right thing think on god just a little revelation on this think about this talking about when we eat something how many knows when you eat them it becomes a part of your dna how do we eat spiritually we eat spiritually through our eyes and through our ears blessed is he that heareth blessed are your eyes if you can see blessed he that readeth in that right you read it goes into your through your eyes and then the things that you hear it goes into your and so guess what that's why we read our bible not right we listen to we think about hear the word of god and jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you brother baptized the end of his ministry said he says you're not eating on a man but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of jesus christ i mean please that when you read the word you're eating jesus and it becomes a part of your dna it becomes a part of you what you think about what you take in becomes part of your body amen that's helped me even in the last few weeks just to think about it more meditating money more amen it does you good all right praise the lord god provided for us at this table a spring of water a spring of water cold cold water i mean like the water that comes from the word of god it doesn't matter if you're on your lawn mower it don't matter if you're driving down the road i don't care if you're driving your truck i don't care if you're whatever it is you're doing when that meditation is upon the world and you begin to let that flow in oh my it takes all of the bugs out it's good clean fresh water amen it springs up into the in your innermost it says into everlasting life but people don't want fresh water they don't want preaching like this because it goes right down to where you live your toes might get stepped on you'll find out you're really not what you ought to be you're not where you want to be but praise god for that i am not there you go where i used to be unfortunately there's so many that have excuses well i've made a wi-fi they've got interest somewhere else their interests are in other places why are there interests in other places well because they're not a god didn't jesus say that men love darkness rather than life aaron watch that roach under your foot right there you don't think there's a roach right there why huh it's a clean bill no there's probably not a roach what about a mouse what's that rat huh you see any running around here why why not men love what darkness they love darkness you have a bunch of i lived in florida and i'll tell you what my landlady should have had a little like more extermination going on because when i turned the light on the counter just swoo all over the counter well we got to watch that back down roaches scatter everywhere they find underneath there every eye get out of here get underneath somewhere huh rats might they all love the darkness they're creatures of darkness there's very few that are of the light because it says that a child of god those are those who that have come to god they love for their deeds to be made manifest now brother brian you got a problem brother you got a problem i do please tell me i want to know what my problem is so we can take care of the problem i don't want the problem uh we want our deeds to be manifest and brought to light so that we could be right others you know oh i never going back to that church again i don't want him to preach on me like i ain't gonna never hear that again huh go back out into the darkness feed on man you sisters can cut your hair it doesn't really matter and a little makeup won't hurt you huh pretty soon your eyelids you know they'll have little what there'll be about 12 of them in one you know a bunch of little different ones isn't that right well i don't know about the rest but all you know you'll look like you're born with red that's trim red trim right around there huh when you come into the church you you know wear pants well now god don't look on the outward appearance you men now that's man feed on man you'll get to looking like a hate instead of a saint let me tell you some honor god and god will honor you how many believes that honor god and god will honor you dishonor god and god will dishonor you be ashamed of him and he'll be ashamed of you seek him and find them knock oh god wants you to knock god i want you to seek how many please yeah see ye shall find not and it shall be opened unto you amen thirst and you shall be satisfied unsatisfied are you satisfied oh my hunger and your hunger shall be quenched first and your thirst shall be quenched [Music] name in a new era from the time that it is finished i did my part he was here this morning he couldn't do any more for you than he did already he could try to find ways to get you to what believe it that's right find ways to get you to believe god is a merciful god amen praise the lord draw my god and god will draw an eye to you care about god and god will care about you love god and god will love you because it don't matter how much god loves you that ain't going to matter a bit there's going to be a lot of people burning hell that god loved that's a little hard explain this brother butler can i give me a minute well give me about five seconds the rich man he loved the young man the bible says he loves the rich young ruler jesus loved him jesus loved cain he god was so caring for cain that he led him to water he said just drink this water and you'll live you know right just do what i day to do and you'll live i thought about the children of cain sons of cain sons of the devil which this world is filled with you can take the water by the parish and you can take them to the trough you can grab them by the head and you can stick their head down in the puff break this water down under water and you know all will come up is all you're going to get ice bubbles little air going out but they sure ain't going to suck it in they would rather almost die of a lack of oxygen than to drink this water they don't want it because that's how merciful god was huh let me tell you something the signs the wonders the miracles that god in this generation was so generous to show this world what was really truth and they still don't want it oh yeah brother brahms tapes will be played back at judgment he says this tape will be played back because this is not me this is god doing and the works that god did in this generation will be played back to them and like brother brian says we've got all the prophets all the sages all the examples you know it's going to be more tolerable for sodom and gomor than for this city because if they stood if they had the miracles done in that city they'd repent that's what he said become more tolerable amen than for these who had these miracles done proving amen what was really truth and then still denying it we have an unbelieving bunch of world today amen living in satan's eden praise be to god so he's prepared a table for us and he's prepared a doctor's office how many is glad for the doctor's office he's prepared for us medicine aren't you glad for medicine how many goes to the doctor none of y'all go to the doctor yeah come on be honest yeah real honest i go to the doctor i go as little as i have to is that right but we all go to the doctor why because you need help because sometimes antibiotics give a little more than what your body you know can hardly produce and you'll get over it quicker very smart yay sometimes you need a little help they can give you they got medicine for it how many goes to the doctor's office and you sit at the doorstep and he comes out there says look here's the medicine you need i got some penicillin it'll kill that infection but i see a line going up through your arm here and when they go to your heart you're dead come all the way up you better take it quick and you sit at the doctor says no i don't believe you i ain't gonna take it huh no none of us do that do we no we go in and we say well we get ill with the doctor if he sends us home with a uh you know some kind of a water pill just some kind of a you know we want to be thoroughly checked out find the problem we want good how many likes good health care how many believe jesus has good health care he's got a good health care for you in jeremiah 8 22 says is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered oh my the pastor i want to say the evening light tabernacle i hope every one of us is spiritually healthy spiritually amen recovered of anything is that your state yes i have recovered i was sick i was sinful i wasn't what i ought to be but i have recovered that's where we ought to be how many believe that that's the state that's the condition that you and i should be in that's right a smile on your face joy in your heart peace in love for one another having perfect love in your heart having perfect faith in your soul walking every day joyful well boy oh boy is that okay to say in church boy oh boy i sure hope that if i get you anywhere it's in that place that's your pastor that's where i want to get you recovered healthy happy because that's how god wants you to be amen the joy of the lord in your heart but i realize it's all not how many please it's on us he cared now do you care how much do you care how much do you honor god how much do you respect god because however much you do that that's how much god will respect you back that's how much god will you back amen we're living in an age when everything that's wrong is wrong is being called right the right is being called wrong and people are getting their minds on everything else except god and i'll tell you what when you keep your mind on god god rewards you for even that fear god reverence god respect god and god respect you [Applause] that's the new deal that's the new deal i loved you but now i'm gonna see if you love me i had enough respect to cross my hands and die for you i crossed but stretch them out for you isn't that right now what kind of stretching out are you gonna do for what will you do he cares do you care malachi says in now we call the proud happy yea that work witness i mean wickedness are set up amen they that work wickedness are set up amen yay they are set up yeah they that tempt god are even delivered then there was a group that feared the lord and spake often one to another amen and the lord hearken god was listening and he heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name your thoughts your speech not ashamed to be a light in this generation amen and they shall be mine can i save theory in the dust of the earth somewhere two thousand years later and there isn't even any bone dust hardly left but the day will come then i'm going to make them mine they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him amen then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked didn't the bible say the saints shall judge the world he will come with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon the earth i'll say look we got a situation here i believe i know a man that can handle this that can judge brian baldwin please come forth judge this situation for me huh they'll present all the evidence and he'll be able to turn between right and wrong amen you shall re return and you will discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that service him not sounds like somebody's been going to church for a while somebody that's been studying their bible that knows right from wrong how many believe we need to know right from wrong amen now notice this right into chapter 4 of malachi behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven put this under loudspeakers put this on every radio station put this on every tv channel that there is in the world and let's read it the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up just like it did sodom and gomorrah for thus saith the lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root nor branch amen that's a sad ending isn't it that's a sad ending next verse has something in it i really like it says but let's give the lord a hand bye but unto you that are reverent you that fear you that respect my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings amen and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked and there shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in the day that i do this saith the lord of hosts amen that's the scripture i want to be found in a person that fears and reverences the lord the one that allows the holy spirit to lead and to guide to convict you your mom might not see it your dad might not see it in my case the people might not see it but god sees it he knows your heart and he has to bring the conviction in your heart saying look you did this little something you said something you shouldn't have said or you didn't do something simply that sin of neglect you didn't do something that you should have done amen all right let me come to a close so we see that god has supplied everything isn't that right is there no balm and gideon is there no healing is there no medicine you go to the doctor's office and he's got no medicine where are you going to go the next doctor's office is that right go where there's medicine that's why you got to watch what church you go to nowadays make sure you've got medicine in there make sure the holy ghost is there make sure they got something that they can give you that'll help you amen so god has supplied the medicine is there no vaccine remember brother message many times on the message call why amen so here we are a changing of dispensation god's responsibility has been taken care of it's finished now it's up to you whosoever will let him come come seek ask not if you're hungry if you're thirsty come the spirit says come the bride say come we say come how many believe you like tabernacle we say to the world come to christ come come come come come come come come come god's been saying come for 2 000 years this is your time this is your chance to come not later now is your time this is the time to come come and drink of the water of life freely let everyone that wants to whosoever will let him come aren't you glad scripture makes sense come if you want to if you don't want to well you'll have to answer for that you'll have to answer for not coming but abram says god's going to ask us at the day of judgment why why i've said different times i believe that's one of the main questions that god's going to ask the world is why didn't you come when i invited you it wasn't just my kin folks not just israel but it was the gentiles it was the russians it was the chinese huh it was the north koreans it was the arabs it's all of them he didn't say everybody but this nation anybody but this race never said it he said who's whoever will anybody wants to let him come amen praise be to god my when i get to thinking better perish if god haven't put that in your heart that's right you want to come god puts that in your heart i want to come i want to how many wants to i want it i want that joy i want that peace i want to be full of god i want to be spiritually fat say it with me now that's scriptural it's really not it's you're okay it's safe to say i want to be spiritually fat say it that's right i want to be spiritually fat because the bible says come unto you come up to me and let your soul delight itself in fatness yeah just gets spiritually fat and sassy faith being a god that's right how many knows usually you take dogs you take puppies you take any little creature that just get a little on the fat side they get all jumpy and stuff don't they they just get the feeling really good quiet because they're packed full of vitamins and nutrition and oh my they're not like the starving calf that the farmer never fed all winter isn't that right that starving cam calf went outside of the fence and made it on the green and couldn't barely walk no it can't barely all go miserable there was another preacher that fed his church i mean another pastor that fed his little uh you know calf and when he got out there he got no he got to jumping around kicking his heels back up you know they make some crazy sound they don't know what sound to make so they just bellow out they can't help themselves and as the prophet of god put it that little starved calf says ah that person thinks they're so spiritual the amens they say in church and hallelujahs and little screams huh such fanaticism amen i don't know about you but that's where i want to be with my heart full of the love of god now let me ask you another question in closing in a orchard with fruit trees what fruit ripens first where is it located top of the tree right by the way the coons ate all our peaches the first year i had a bunch of good peaches and the coons came and robbed me you were just about ripe i got one good pump juicy one that was ready i ate it my wife come back out there and say somebody was hungry we've got some bum down with somewhere that is hungry because somebody came and ate all our peaches i don't know anything you could do that because we found some of them little nuts down on the bottom i said something i believe it was or something hey let me tell you something if the devil has robbed you of your fruit of love and joy and peace and long-suffering gentleness get the old shotgun out say devil you get off my property you get off my territory you ain't got no right to be here my tree's gonna be full of fruit top of the tree is where it ripens first why yes it's the one that gets the most sunlight who this church is the most spiritually mature the one that basks in the word of god the one that just stays in the light of the word the sun isn't that right you're going to ripen so much quicker you're not going to ripen real quick down in the basement in some dark place is that right and it's about time he believes it's about time to be right brother troy it is time to be ripe it is time to be ready to be a fully matured christian it's time amen stand with me musicians if you'll come play something softly if you would sister becky let's bow our heads what i like about church it's kind of like what the song says i like that preaching praying shouting glory hallelujah amen preaching praying i mean i was praying because it's good preaching does is good and praying does us good i'm just kind of feeling the spirit this morning i want you to get serious now and think about what state you're in where are you at with the lord i'll tell you this right now i thank god for where i am but i'm still not where i want to be i still want to get closer yet to him there's probably a lot of things that i don't have yet that i'm still living below my privileges [Music] because i'm not where i should be with the lord i haven't fully come to the table like i should the cares of life have still got too much of a grip on me can't come the way that i should i've still got a pair of horses i still got a wife i got some land or whatever it might be that keeping you from the full presence of god in your life [Music] i want to pray this morning with our heads bowed i want to pray and i want to be prayed for let's take five to ten minutes is that okay let's take about five to ten minutes now and pray to god i wonder this morning if you need to come a little closer to christ and you'd want to pray with me here at the altar would you want to step out of your seat and say this morning my altar is the heart but i just want to step out and i want to pray with brother byler because i want you to pray for me and i will pray with you that god will bring you to that place that place where you're eating of all the fruit and all the vegetables that you should have that you be a fat christian that you will be a spiritually male nutrition christian this morning not just another sermon but a time for you to pray and say god here i am i want to take at least five or ten minutes just to call out to god and say god i'm not
