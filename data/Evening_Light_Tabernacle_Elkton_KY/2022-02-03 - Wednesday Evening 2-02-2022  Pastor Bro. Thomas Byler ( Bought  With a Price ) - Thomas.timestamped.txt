[21:36] done for us amen wonderful wonderful
[21:39] jesus is to me and
[21:41] amen
[21:47] you excuse me i
[21:49] i was thinking you know and every good
[21:51] thing
[21:52] everything you go through with something
[21:53] good comes out of it
[21:55] a few years ago you know when i had
[21:57] those stints put in my heart
[21:59] my doctor my heart doctor told me i need
[22:01] to drink a lot of water
[22:03] and i i tried and i failed miserably and
[22:06] because i'm pretty well addicted to diet
[22:08] cokes well when i got covered this last
[22:10] time it changed everything i can't
[22:13] hardly live without water now so
[22:15] i guess the lord knew i needed to listen
[22:17] to the doctor so he gave me covet again
[22:19] for it now i drink it all the time but
[22:22] i'm just thankful for his grace you know
[22:24] i was thinking about that and i got some
[22:26] friends of mine in arkansas and my
[22:28] brother was telling me that
[22:29] they'd had colvin they'd been in the
[22:31] hospital and i thought you know we've
[22:32] been blessed as a church
[22:34] just about everyone's had it but none of
[22:36] us has been serious enough that we've
[22:38] had to go to the hospital and i think
[22:40] that's something we would be very
[22:41] thankful for that god has kept his hand
[22:44] upon us and i'm just really i just
[22:46] really appreciate the lord and you know
[22:48] they always say when we get on the other
[22:50] side we'll really see what god has
[22:52] really done for us all throughout our
[22:54] lives and you know and i i i reminisce
[22:56] sometimes and
[22:58] and
[22:59] the when i was young i didn't have a lot
[23:02] of common sense when it come to driving
[23:04] i would raise anything or anybody and i
[23:05] lost most of the time because i had a
[23:07] slow car but the thrill was was racing
[23:10] but i began to think you know i thought
[23:12] lord
[23:13] one of these days we'll begin to see all
[23:15] the goodness and mercy you really have
[23:17] done in our hearts and lives and that's

[32:36] oh in that city where they've come
[32:52] i am going where the lamb is the light
[32:57] god bless
[32:59] [Music]
[33:05] you everybody
[33:15] hey man we uh kind of watch the radar i
[33:17] know some of you is probably a little
[33:19] concerned about the ice storm just west
[33:20] of us here
[33:22] and it's uh not too far from us but
[33:25] it's 50 degrees so maybe it'll melt when
[33:27] it hit the road by the time you know
[33:28] you've got a long way to go so
[33:30] uh
[33:31] yeah you know we don't want anybody
[33:32] stranded so
[33:34] anyway but i think we'll be all right i
[33:35] think we can squeeze it in i hate to
[33:37] miss church don't you
[33:39] so if we can squeeze it in we'll squeeze
[33:40] it in amen
[33:42] praise the lord god is good isn't he i
[33:44] hope you haven't having a good week
[33:45] everybody having a good week
[33:48] amen praise the lord i'll tell you what
[33:50] um
[33:52] it's been good amen i'll tell you what i
[33:54] just
[33:55] after sunday the lord coming down just
[33:57] at an anointing and
[33:58] amen re-surrendering ourselves i don't
[34:01] know if it made a difference for you but
[34:02] it's made a difference for me
[34:04] i mean this week's been a lot better
[34:05] amen
[34:07] and just the closer walk with god amen
[34:09] that's what we desire right a closer
[34:11] walk with god
[34:13] and so amen i just hope that it's amen
[34:16] it may change your life
[34:18] you know the prophet says that and we
[34:20] say it a lot but i mean it's got to be a
[34:22] reality that we either go out there
[34:24] better or we don't right
[34:26] and if we go out there better then let's
[34:29] stay that way amen
[34:30] and that's always a battle because we're
[34:32] in the human body the human body is one
[34:34] of the terrible things to have to fight
[34:36] we have to fight with against it all the
[34:38] way until we get out of it but we just
[34:41] thank god for his mercy
[34:43] amen let's bow our heads kind heavenly
[34:46] father we come before you one more time
[34:47] lord grateful lord jesus that the
[34:50] weather permits this lord to be able to
[34:51] have the service this evening and we
[34:53] just ask god that once again you just
[34:56] come and speak to us along the way and
[34:58] may our hearts burn within his father as
[35:00] you speak to us lord jesus and help me
[35:02] just to be completely surrendered to you
[35:04] lord jesus that i wouldn't say
[35:06] anything that would be human or carnal
[35:08] or something that would be displeasing
[35:11] to you lord so i just ask god help me to
[35:13] get completely out of the way that your
[35:15] spirit would speak to your people father
[35:18] lord you know just how to do it you're
[35:20] so fantastic at it we asked god that you
[35:22] would just speak to our hearts tonight
[35:24] lord and lord you just know to go down
[35:26] avenues and channels and say things lord
[35:29] that i haven't thought of and haven't
[35:31] premeditated and and just to say what we
[35:33] need to hear father we ask god that the
[35:36] audience the congregation lord would be
[35:38] prayed up lord and be ready to hear from
[35:40] the spirit and receive what you have for
[35:43] us we just bless your name we praise you
[35:45] father and give thanks and honor and
[35:47] glory to you for what you have done for
[35:49] us tonight lord and we just ask your
[35:51] blessings upon the reading of the word
[35:53] the meditation of our heart in jesus
[35:55] name amen and amen
[35:58] so i've just been meditating and i've
[36:00] just
[36:00] been thinking about sunday and and and
[36:03] so
[36:05] i have i guess we'll try to put it all
[36:07] together but the lord's just given me
[36:09] several different thoughts a little bit
[36:11] and so we'll just
[36:13] see what the lord will have but it
[36:15] certainly again
[36:16] towards a closer walk with god amen
[36:19] and
[36:21] so if you will turn your bibles go to
[36:24] um i believe it's
[36:27] let me see korean first corinthians
[36:30] first corinthians
[36:36] amen and i know brother steve he'd
[36:37] probably not be tonight but we greet him
[36:40] amen
[36:41] and we miss him amen
[36:43] and pray god's blessing upon him way up
[36:45] there and amen all those out there in
[36:48] radio land may god bless you richly amen
[36:50] god is good
[36:52] amen uh first corinthians six
[36:58] first corinthians six
[37:09] and we'll begin verse 19.
[37:14] what
[37:15] know ye not that your body is the temple
[37:18] of the holy ghost which is in you
[37:21] which you have of god
[37:23] and ye are not your own
[37:26] you are bought with a price
[37:29] therefore glorify god in your body and
[37:32] in your spirit
[37:34] which are gods begotten is blessing to
[37:36] the green word
[37:38] you can be seated
[37:40] my thought meditation was that i just
[37:42] wanted to speak a little bit
[37:44] of what it's like
[37:47] when you truly are completely
[37:49] surrendered to god amen
[37:52] what it's like to be completely
[37:53] surrendered
[37:54] to god
[37:56] and i got to thinking about how that you
[37:58] know
[37:59] the bible we know that the bible is our
[38:01] map
[38:02] right it's like a map it's like a
[38:04] direction book
[38:07] and we all know that most of the time
[38:09] whenever you're doing anything
[38:12] it's really the best to read the
[38:14] directions
[38:18] and it's probably very very few times
[38:21] that you're going to have directions
[38:23] that mislead you
[38:25] right
[38:25] [Music]
[38:28] very few times you're going to say now
[38:29] those directions are wrong right i mean
[38:32] come from the manufacturer when they put
[38:34] it together they want to make sure that
[38:36] you know
[38:37] you can get it put together right
[38:39] amen and that's the way it is with our
[38:41] lives this bible is a road map it is a
[38:44] book of directions
[38:46] and it is uh you know they have those
[38:49] those maps that are written out but we
[38:52] unfolded for a road map right remember
[38:54] those
[38:56] yeah and because we want to laugh at
[38:58] those now right but you know sometimes
[39:01] our dps will mess us up won't we
[39:05] sometimes you're messing your gps and
[39:07] you kind of wish you had the road map
[39:09] here back to the old way because when
[39:11] they lay those out those aren't supposed
[39:13] to be wrong either right
[39:15] they get those pretty precise but when
[39:17] you're relying on
[39:18] gps and then there ain't no re i don't
[39:20] know why in the world but there will be
[39:22] different reasons why it'll take you the
[39:24] wrong way
[39:25] i get frustrated
[39:27] brother sean whenever i'm going
[39:28] somewhere
[39:30] and i pre-look at where it's directing
[39:32] me on the gps right and then all of a
[39:35] sudden it takes tells me take a left up
[39:38] here
[39:39] okay i'll pull off the road and now look
[39:41] where it goes and i've had him take me
[39:43] over here up and then back on my road
[39:45] and i'm like why would i want to do a
[39:46] little thing like that what in the
[39:48] world's going on here no i'm going to
[39:50] keep going straight
[39:52] right
[39:53] and then and i do that and keep going
[39:55] straight and then all of a sudden it'll
[39:57] self-correct i'll check it again and say
[39:59] okay now that's what you're supposed to
[40:00] do
[40:02] in other words when you get me a certain
[40:03] road the closest route the straightest
[40:05] route keep me on that route
[40:09] and that's where it is with the bible
[40:11] amen i want you to know that there is
[40:12] never i am are you glad there is never
[40:16] a fault in god's direction his gps is
[40:20] right on every time
[40:23] and if we desire to get closer to god
[40:26] how many believes that if we will do
[40:28] what the bible says it will not mislead
[40:30] us
[40:33] i am so glad brother sisters that we
[40:35] have the directions that we know
[40:38] uh through the message of the hour that
[40:40] we can be told exactly what give us more
[40:43] power to live a victorious christian
[40:46] life
[40:49] like brother brad i believe he preached
[40:50] about a week ago talking about stability
[40:52] that you can't find stability anymore
[40:54] it's hard to be stable
[40:57] and not just to have a victorious life
[40:59] but to have a consistent victorious
[41:02] stable life
[41:05] come on folks are you with me
[41:07] because we all know what it's like to
[41:08] get up in the morning and not feel like
[41:10] we did the day before
[41:12] or go halfway through the day
[41:15] and everything that can go wrong will go
[41:17] wrong
[41:19] hello
[41:21] i'ma share a little personal thing here
[41:23] my wife i hope she won't mind
[41:25] but
[41:26] i'm sure that you have experienced it
[41:27] perhaps when you're close to the lord
[41:29] and everything's going good and you know
[41:32] you're gonna let nothing upset you today
[41:33] and just just come
[41:35] to go on and so on and so on all of a
[41:37] sudden your mate something will disturb
[41:39] them and they'll be all upset
[41:42] right that kind of happened to us this
[41:44] week and i talked to my wife look that's
[41:46] you know if the devil can't get to you
[41:48] he'll get to me if he can't get to me
[41:49] he'll get to you
[41:52] amen because he wants to get to you to
[41:53] get to me
[41:55] and the devil will always work on you
[41:57] won't he
[41:58] and so how many has ever experienced
[41:59] that if you've been married very long
[42:01] you know that sometimes both of them
[42:04] aren't pulling together at the same time
[42:07] come on folks that's a big hallelujah
[42:09] amen right there
[42:11] that's the truth ain't it that's right
[42:12] because but you know it's just the devil
[42:14] and you got to encourage each other in
[42:16] those times to speak to each other
[42:18] person at a time let's just kind of
[42:19] encourage them and so forth amen and to
[42:21] get it all pulling together to keep the
[42:23] devil out
[42:24] to keep things going free and good
[42:27] amen
[42:29] praise be to god so we look at this here
[42:32] amen when you are completely surrendered
[42:35] to god that means that you have been
[42:38] bought in other words to commit yourself
[42:40] to god to come to jesus the way he said
[42:42] for you to come love don't love mama
[42:45] daddy better sister no family member to
[42:47] hate hey nobody that you love more than
[42:49] him
[42:50] how he believes you got to surrender all
[42:52] your family got to surrender all your
[42:54] acquaintances you got to surrender your
[42:56] wife
[42:57] or your heart you can't love them more
[42:59] than you love god
[43:03] see folks i thought about this stuff i
[43:05] thought about that i thought about why
[43:06] we don't have fullness of
[43:08] why we don't have fullness of victory
[43:10] but i believe it's there for us
[43:13] are you with me but if there's any fault
[43:15] it's because we're not coming according
[43:17] to the bible
[43:21] we're not coming we're not completely
[43:23] like sunday was so good because he was
[43:25] talking about how that we want to
[43:26] completely surrender ourselves almighty
[43:29] god
[43:31] amen
[43:37] oh god is good isn't he
[43:40] and
[43:41] so that you come so you come completely
[43:44] surrendered to christ
[43:46] you give yourself to christ he's got the
[43:47] directions on how to how to uh how to
[43:50] have a new birth how to really be born
[43:52] again how to really be a christian
[43:59] and i believe it's got to work
[44:02] now this just comes to mind didn't
[44:04] haven't
[44:05] pre-meditated this one but remember when
[44:07] brother ben preached a message called
[44:08] choir to people so toss it out
[44:11] he says you find people that just seem
[44:13] to be on top of the mountain all the
[44:14] time every day
[44:16] then you find people that are just up
[44:18] and down in and out for one day to
[44:19] hallelujah glory to god and maybe run
[44:21] into pews and the next day i just don't
[44:24] think i'm a christian
[44:26] huh
[44:27] and brandon explains it in that message
[44:29] so if you've got that problem go back to
[44:31] that message and listen to why
[44:33] right
[44:34] and then find out the reason why and
[44:36] then repent
[44:37] get right and i tell you what i believe
[44:39] this you can be like that other person
[44:42] amen because if it's good for one it's
[44:43] good for the other it's good for
[44:45] everybody but it's still just our ways
[44:48] that gets messed up into it
[44:51] oh my
[44:54] i like it
[44:56] so i got thinking you know
[44:58] when you come that way you've got to
[44:59] come the right way you've got to come
[45:01] according to the instructions
[45:03] and that is what that is repent turn
[45:05] around
[45:06] 360. you're going to be happy we'll be
[45:08] willing to forsake all to follow him
[45:18] amen and if you do
[45:21] if you come the right way
[45:23] let me say this
[45:25] i don't care if you got cancer
[45:28] i don't care what what your problem is
[45:33] if you come the right way
[45:35] right
[45:36] i mean please it's gonna happen
[45:39] you're going to get to your destination
[45:42] if you come the right way
[45:44] it has to
[45:48] fail
[45:51] it cannot
[45:52] does not fail if there's any failure who
[45:55] is it on
[45:58] you
[46:01] well my pastor just don't preach it
[46:02] right
[46:03] so it's not his fault it's surely your
[46:05] fault
[46:06] maybe you got a revelation that he don't
[46:08] now you got the right path and you got
[46:09] to get what you want
[46:11] i don't care what it is
[46:12] my my husband don't blame nobody else
[46:15] just blame yourself i mean that's all we
[46:17] got to blame is ourself
[46:20] because i believe with all of my heart
[46:22] that when you come with everything on
[46:24] the line and you're willing to give up
[46:27] everything
[46:29] i believe that
[46:31] you've got to be willing to give up
[46:32] everything
[46:35] for the
[46:37] sake of christ and let him have the
[46:39] preeminence
[46:41] long as you hold to one thing you're not
[46:44] gonna be a complete christian
[46:47] now i'm here to tell you because i know
[46:49] it happened to me
[46:51] huh
[46:52] i know when i came to god i don't care
[46:54] if you want me to decline to try to
[46:56] climb to the moon i don't care what god
[46:58] wanted me to do i said i am here
[47:01] whatever you want me to do whatever you
[47:03] want me to be whatever it is lord i am
[47:05] yours
[47:09] how many knows that has to do
[47:12] with that that heifer that they had that
[47:14] could not have a spot or a wrinkle on it
[47:16] right that sacrifice had to be perfect
[47:19] or god would not accept it that's the
[47:21] way with your sacrifice you've got to
[47:24] come and it cannot be with spot or
[47:26] wrinkle or a little bit of this or a
[47:28] little bit it's got to be acceptable by
[47:31] god
[47:34] because when you come the right way you
[47:36] don't even have to wait for it
[47:40] uh people want to tarry and do this out
[47:42] of the other you might have to tarry and
[47:44] labor just to die to yourself
[47:46] but the minute that you accept it and
[47:48] you receive it and you believe it with
[47:50] all of your heart just like cornelius
[47:52] amen in the ninth chapter i believe it
[47:54] is of acts amen they received it when
[47:57] the word was preached they received it
[47:58] immediately the holy ghost fell upon
[48:01] them
[48:02] amen
[48:04] god will consume your sacrifice you'll
[48:07] accept your sacrifice by and how do you
[48:10] know you've got the holy ghost how do
[48:11] you know that god accepts your sacrifice
[48:18] when he fills you with the holy ghost
[48:21] that's the only way that you know that
[48:23] he ex
[48:24] accepted your sacrifice
[48:27] he consumed it and filled you with the
[48:29] holy ghost
[48:31] amen
[48:33] i was thinking also just meditating
[48:37] and i thought you know we get so wrapped
[48:38] up in the things of this world
[48:43] you know
[48:45] i've got a chevy truck i like my chevy
[48:47] truck it's the best nicest chevy truck
[48:49] i've had in a while
[48:51] and everybody likes a nice vehicle how
[48:53] many likes a nice vehicle well mike and
[48:55] i'm eagle
[48:56] and i was thinking you know right now
[48:59] the used trucks are pretty uh you know
[49:01] pretty high you can get a lot of money
[49:03] for them and and so forth and my my
[49:06] front hood is flaking off the paint's
[49:09] coming off i'm like oh man just when i
[49:11] thought i had and i took the paint just
[49:13] supposed to peel enough
[49:15] all the trade it in and buy me a nice
[49:17] forty thousand dollar truck
[49:20] like that come on get control of
[49:21] yourself you don't need no big old nice
[49:23] truck
[49:25] that one there will do you good for a
[49:26] long time
[49:27] huh
[49:29] your flesh always wants better
[49:31] i always want something nice and i'm
[49:32] thinking well i'd be riding one of them
[49:34] nice here i'm cheese you know
[49:36] nothing wrong with doing it if you can
[49:37] afford today oh pray praise be to god
[49:40] i'll dance around the truck with you if
[49:41] you can afford to know that god bless
[49:43] you with ain't nothing wrong with it
[49:46] but you make sure that you're led by the
[49:47] holy ghost and that you don't put
[49:49] yourself in such states you can't come
[49:50] to church huh
[49:54] put you on a bind and maybe all
[49:55] squirming
[49:57] but what i'm trying to say is we get sow
[50:00] our houses everything about it we get so
[50:02] earthly minded amen in our treasure we
[50:06] these things are our treasures right
[50:11] but you know the real tractor why come
[50:12] to find out the real truck and listen
[50:15] some people's treasure is money
[50:19] more money
[50:20] money money money money money
[50:22] become a millionaire
[50:25] do you realize that the millionaire
[50:27] isn't much happier than it was before he
[50:29] wants in another million or you want to
[50:30] be a donald trump and be a
[50:31] multi-billionaire
[50:33] huh
[50:35] and come to find out it doesn't really
[50:37] give him any more joy down in here at
[50:39] all it just gives them more headache and
[50:40] worry probably
[50:42] huh
[50:43] because people would pay billions of
[50:45] dollars
[50:46] they'd pay all kinds of money for just
[50:48] the one thing and that is to have peace
[50:51] of mind
[50:54] to have peace in their heart
[50:58] don't you realize that one of the
[50:59] greatest values in life is contentment
[51:04] to be happy with what you have
[51:07] paul's a godliness with contentment is
[51:10] great day
[51:14] jesus said where your treasure is there
[51:17] will your heart be also
[51:20] the greatest and the most
[51:22] greatest treasures in the world
[51:26] are the things that jesus paid for
[51:29] for you and me on calvary
[51:32] how many believes
[51:38] that's right
[51:39] that's the greatest thing even jesus
[51:41] said the news that labor not for the
[51:43] meat that perishes
[51:45] we labor so much
[51:48] for the things that are perishable
[51:51] that will perish
[51:55] everything gets old everything will
[51:57] perish
[51:58] but he said don't labor for that labor
[52:00] for the things that are eternal what's
[52:02] eternal salvation for one thing
[52:05] just to start
[52:08] amen
[52:10] to know
[52:13] like paul said
[52:15] through faith we have peace with god
[52:17] right
[52:19] we have peace with god
[52:22] what a valuable thing
[52:24] because you couldn't have peace with god
[52:27] unless you could have your sins
[52:28] forgetting forgiven how many believes
[52:30] that one of the greatest treasures is to
[52:32] have your sins forgiven
[52:37] he
[52:38] hath
[52:40] forgiven
[52:42] me
[52:43] my sins have been washed from his memory
[52:49] by the blood of the lamb
[52:53] oh that is so valuable
[52:56] and it's just such a value to know that
[52:58] your sins are gone
[53:01] and now you belong
[53:07] you belong to somebody
[53:24] let me write my notes down
[53:26] okay
[53:30] you belong to somebody
[53:33] now you're wearing this
[53:40] so
[53:42] [Laughter]
[53:45] so
[53:49] how many has heard the phrase sold out
[53:50] to god
[53:52] amen that means you belong to somebody
[53:56] that means you have been purchased
[54:00] somebody bought you nobody says you are
[54:03] bought with a price
[54:13] and you know what the devil don't like
[54:15] that he don't like that sign
[54:18] he don't want you to be sold
[54:21] because he's still trying to buy you
[54:24] you know he don't care how much of a
[54:25] soul sign on there you you have he's
[54:28] still gonna try to offer you stuff
[54:32] huh
[54:36] but we just gotta let the devil know
[54:37] we're sold we're not for sale
[54:41] that means that you're not for sale you
[54:44] can't have me
[54:46] somebody got me you are now god's
[54:49] property
[54:50] to be completely surrendered means that
[54:52] you are now god's property and the devil
[54:56] has no right on your property
[55:00] the devil can't touch you without god's
[55:03] permission remember that nothing can
[55:05] happen to you unless god allowed it
[55:11] if the devil tries to put something on
[55:13] you that's not yours like sickness or
[55:15] whatever it might be are ready to quote
[55:19] this afternoon where brother ram says
[55:21] you know you've got the token has been
[55:23] applied
[55:25] right
[55:28] amen to the devil has no right on your
[55:30] property if he comes and takes something
[55:32] sometimes to get something to take
[55:33] something take your health take your joy
[55:36] take whatever tell them get off this
[55:38] property
[55:39] you ain't got no right to be here
[55:42] another thing about being completely
[55:44] surrounded i want you to know it gives
[55:46] you a right to fill out god's checks
[55:52] you know he's already put his name down
[55:54] underneath them checks in the name of
[55:56] jesus christ he's already signed the
[55:58] checks you've got a whole checkbook full
[56:00] of side checks
[56:02] whatever you need
[56:04] you can have
[56:07] what so everything you ask in my name i
[56:10] will do it
[56:18] but you can't be
[56:19] and i want to go a different direction
[56:20] here
[56:22] you can't just be partially sold
[56:26] the problem is and
[56:28] the other thing is about it
[56:30] being completely surrendered means
[56:33] that you're not halfway anymore
[56:37] halfway you're not lukewarm anymore
[56:39] you're hot for god now
[56:41] it means you're prayed up
[56:44] come on folks how many we you know
[56:47] it's easy to get unprayed up and and to
[56:49] be lukewarm
[56:51] but when you're completely surrendered
[56:52] you surrender your day you get up and
[56:54] commit your day to the lord
[56:56] right every walk every step everything
[57:00] you completely surrendered means you're
[57:02] not lukewarm anymore
[57:11] you're not partial
[57:13] you're not a halfway christian
[57:16] anymore
[57:16] [Music]
[57:18] remember what he said
[57:20] me just people are halfway preachers are
[57:22] halfway
[57:24] folks i'm telling you
[57:27] i know what this flesh does and how that
[57:29] it can get you all droggy
[57:34] brother brad any any preacher knows
[57:37] that you can come up here and preach a
[57:40] good sermon
[57:42] by your intellects
[57:45] huh
[57:46] but when you really get in the spirit
[57:49] you realize
[57:50] i could be so much better
[57:53] huh i could do so much better
[57:57] if i'd just be more surrendered
[57:59] now was it lukewarm you're not going to
[58:01] preach you're too good being a priest or
[58:03] lukewarm
[58:04] yeah you're going to be halfway
[58:08] same way with a christian
[58:11] you're just going to be a halfway
[58:12] christian
[58:14] you could be so much more
[58:18] but it takes a full surrender
[58:20] i believe it was in 64 65 remember
[58:23] brother bam talk preach a message called
[58:25] god's word calls for a total separation
[58:27] from unbelief
[58:28] and why
[58:29] what did he use but abraham he used
[58:32] abraham as an illustration that though
[58:34] yet the covenant though he had an
[58:36] unconditional covenant that god was
[58:38] going to save him and so forth and he
[58:39] was going to have multitudes of people
[58:41] and that wasn't going to change
[58:44] that he's going to do all of this but
[58:46] yet
[58:47] god didn't bless him fully
[58:50] right
[58:51] because he still had a little unbelief
[58:53] in the way
[58:54] he took lot he took his daddy when god
[58:56] said separate
[58:59] himself from everything
[59:01] that's where brother baby says you know
[59:02] that a christian is not fully blessed
[59:05] until he has completely surrendered to
[59:07] god in complete obedience to the word of
[59:09] god
[59:12] i got to thinking today
[59:13] i thought you know it's kind of like
[59:15] somebody that works for you and man i'm
[59:18] telling you he doesn't do what you say
[59:21] he finally you find him sleep on the job
[59:24] he argues with you
[59:27] he fusses with you
[59:29] tries to tell you how to do it
[59:31] and then he don't even do what he's
[59:32] supposed to do
[59:38] huh
[59:40] are you going to promote him are you
[59:41] going to are you going to are you going
[59:42] to bless him and give him a bonus
[59:46] now
[59:47] well that's the same way with god
[59:49] even though he was god's child he did
[59:52] not fully bless abraham
[59:55] until he fully obeyed are you gonna are
[59:57] you gonna promote are you gonna be a
[59:59] blessing are you going to
[1:00:02] give a guy a bonus that man he does what
[1:00:04] she said plus more
[1:00:07] he says yes sir instead of well do i
[1:00:09] have to
[1:00:12] how long can i take to do it
[1:00:15] and then when he does the job it's half
[1:00:17] done and you have to tell them to do it
[1:00:18] again
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:22] well that's what's with god
[1:00:24] until you're fully blessed until you to
[1:00:26] fully obey
[1:00:28] he can't fully bless you
[1:00:31] he's not gonna fully bless you you're
[1:00:32] not gonna really know what it's like
[1:00:36] to have the full joy of god
[1:00:38] until you are completely surrendered to
[1:00:41] god and realize that you are bought with
[1:00:43] a price
[1:00:47] that joy let me tell you something that
[1:00:49] joy and that peace
[1:00:51] i like that peace because i'm telling
[1:00:52] you
[1:00:55] when you're fully surrendered you get
[1:00:56] the benefits of calvary
[1:00:59] you get everything you paid for
[1:01:04] everything that you have need of in this
[1:01:06] life's journey and when you come down to
[1:01:08] drawing your last breath you don't have
[1:01:10] to even be afraid
[1:01:13] he will take care of you through all of
[1:01:15] this life and when you come to the end
[1:01:17] of it and you come to the river and
[1:01:19] he'll come to the end of the road he'll
[1:01:20] take you across the river and he
[1:01:22] promised that over there i've got a
[1:01:24] place prepared for you already
[1:01:28] what a blessing
[1:01:32] we don't have to live below our
[1:01:33] god-given privileges anymore
[1:01:36] how many believes that we don't have you
[1:01:37] don't have to live below those
[1:01:39] privileges the prophet of god talk about
[1:01:41] he says christians everywhere are living
[1:01:42] a million miles below their god-given
[1:01:45] privileges
[1:01:47] i believe when you're fully surrendered
[1:01:48] you live up and you begin to be able to
[1:01:51] tap in on those resources god begin to
[1:01:53] give you those things
[1:01:55] give you that joy give me that power
[1:01:59] give me that love give me that peace
[1:02:01] give me that fire
[1:02:06] huh
[1:02:08] as long as you're halfway
[1:02:11] you're gonna be halfway
[1:02:13] it's gonna make everybody sick
[1:02:17] can i say that is that all right makes
[1:02:19] everybody sick when you're halfway not
[1:02:21] just god but people don't even like it
[1:02:24] your wife don't like it your husband
[1:02:26] don't like it
[1:02:27] your pastor don't like it your children
[1:02:29] won't like it
[1:02:39] i don't know if my son's listening
[1:02:40] tonight but
[1:02:43] i wouldn't help him out a little bit
[1:02:47] yesterday i believe it was not micah but
[1:02:51] i was helping him out
[1:02:54] you know what he was so worried about
[1:02:56] you know about me scratching his
[1:02:58] concrete a little scratch here and
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:01] doing this and ripping the cord out of
[1:03:02] the wall by tripping over it and he's
[1:03:05] getting on to me and getting on the
[1:03:06] music what's up i'll just go home
[1:03:09] he said dad you do that one now you're
[1:03:11] up at your house
[1:03:13] i'm like i'm not really particularly
[1:03:15] about anything but i have been lately
[1:03:17] from my house ripped out i want to be
[1:03:19] careful is that the other and i thought
[1:03:20] about i i left it alone i almost got a
[1:03:23] little upset i left it alone i said son
[1:03:25] you are exactly right you're a chip off
[1:03:27] the old block i said that's how exactly
[1:03:29] i am i'm sorry you know
[1:03:32] i'm particular you're predicting i
[1:03:34] should i should understand that
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:37] how many believes the holy ghost will
[1:03:38] make you aware of your own faults
[1:03:41] amen when it's your children you can't
[1:03:44] blame them for a while they are they got
[1:03:46] it
[1:03:47] oh they remind me of that sometimes
[1:03:49] about that do you know where i got it
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:55] praise the lord you love
[1:03:56] him oh my when i think about it
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:01] got to thinking that
[1:04:03] when you're christian
[1:04:10] when you're fully surrendered
[1:04:13] matthew
[1:04:15] 5
[1:04:16] matthew 6 and verse 31
[1:04:19] is yours
[1:04:21] matthew 6 31 therefore take no thought
[1:04:24] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[1:04:27] we drink or where with all shall we be
[1:04:29] clothed for after all these things to
[1:04:31] this gentile seek
[1:04:32] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:04:34] you have need of all these things but
[1:04:37] seek
[1:04:38] ye first to keep every
[1:04:42] thing
[1:04:43] all these things
[1:04:47] shall be added unto you
[1:04:50] let me believe that when you have a
[1:04:52] complete render light to god god takes
[1:04:55] care of you 100
[1:04:57] percent
[1:05:01] aren't you glad for that god takes care
[1:05:04] of you 100 percent
[1:05:11] he cares about what you get to eat
[1:05:13] whether you got clothes to wear whether
[1:05:15] you got a roof over your head whether
[1:05:16] you got shoes on your feet he cares
[1:05:18] about every bit of you
[1:05:20] if you're seeking the kingdom of god
[1:05:24] remember seek the kingdom first put him
[1:05:26] first in everything he'll take care of
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:29] other than that you don't really have
[1:05:31] that promise
[1:05:32] huh
[1:05:35] you don't really have that promise you
[1:05:37] have a promise really of being miserable
[1:05:41] huh
[1:05:42] poor blind
[1:05:44] naked
[1:05:46] lukewarm that's what laodicea was
[1:05:48] that's what a lukewarmness brought him
[1:05:52] oh my
[1:05:54] let's remember this also
[1:05:56] that we're hot not cold
[1:06:00] and even
[1:06:01] our prophet taught us that in the old
[1:06:03] testament with the children of israel
[1:06:05] they would come to church they would
[1:06:07] make the sacrifice they'd do their
[1:06:08] church thing all the time every time all
[1:06:10] the time every time
[1:06:11] until it becomes just nothing but a
[1:06:13] tradition to them
[1:06:15] and he said because he got stale because
[1:06:17] he got common to him god said it's a
[1:06:20] stench in my nose
[1:06:23] it really don't mean anything to him
[1:06:25] anymore
[1:06:26] we can come to church on wednesday we
[1:06:28] come on church on sunday we can do this
[1:06:30] back and forth until it doesn't really
[1:06:32] have the meaning
[1:06:35] and it becomes a stench in god's
[1:06:37] nostrils and it's lukewarmness god don't
[1:06:39] accept that lukewarmness
[1:06:44] i believe that it ought to make us like
[1:06:48] uh
[1:06:49] make us stable
[1:06:51] but many times many scripture talks
[1:06:53] about uh making god establish you and so
[1:06:56] forth and make you stable and intend for
[1:06:59] uh you know having done all to stand
[1:07:01] therefore stand having you learn loyal
[1:07:03] skirt about
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:07] when you are completely surrendered to
[1:07:09] god
[1:07:10] worship doesn't become common amazing
[1:07:14] grace doesn't become common
[1:07:17] you don't come in here one sunday and
[1:07:19] you join in for singing and oh
[1:07:21] praise be to god and tears flowing down
[1:07:23] and the next one you come and you're
[1:07:25] nothing but a spectator
[1:07:29] huh
[1:07:30] how many knows being in church is not a
[1:07:32] place for expectation
[1:07:35] it's participation
[1:07:38] in worship
[1:07:42] certainly makes it easier for the
[1:07:44] preacher when the people get into it
[1:07:47] what god what good does it do to have an
[1:07:50] inspired preacher
[1:07:52] when a congregation is not inspired
[1:07:56] an individual is not inspired
[1:07:58] how many plays he takes both parts
[1:08:01] amen if the preacher's inspired the
[1:08:03] congregation's inspired something's
[1:08:06] fixing to happen
[1:08:09] god come down and pray inhabits the
[1:08:11] praise of his people
[1:08:13] i believe our worship should come from
[1:08:14] the
[1:08:16] bottom of our heart
[1:08:18] all the time
[1:08:19] constantly consistently
[1:08:22] and the only way that'll happen folks
[1:08:23] how many knows and that is if you know
[1:08:26] how to do like daniel did
[1:08:28] and have a
[1:08:29] three times a day prayer life a constant
[1:08:32] relationship with christ
[1:08:34] a constant dying to yourself every day
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:41] i wrote down here that you'll be like
[1:08:44] stonewall jackson
[1:08:48] what happens when you're completely
[1:08:50] surrendered to god you become like
[1:08:52] stonewall jackson you become stable and
[1:08:55] unmovable
[1:08:57] hello
[1:08:59] not up and down and in and out but it
[1:09:01] becomes stable
[1:09:03] and not just stable but there's
[1:09:05] something
[1:09:06] else about stonewall jackson that made
[1:09:09] him that way
[1:09:10] i believe the bible says in everything
[1:09:13] give thanks
[1:09:17] now folks i'll be watering my horse
[1:09:19] trough up as i say thank
[1:09:21] you lord for this trough of water
[1:09:24] what just all kinds of different things
[1:09:26] thank you for this
[1:09:28] i was coming to town and coming through
[1:09:29] the red light and i looked and that says
[1:09:31] boy thank you lord for have a nice
[1:09:33] smooth road i know russia and some of
[1:09:35] them places they don't have a very good
[1:09:37] rose from what i understand
[1:09:39] the philippines you know it'll take your
[1:09:40] wheel off
[1:09:42] come on folks very good and i thank you
[1:09:44] thank you lord for this new intersection
[1:09:46] thank you for the turning lanes you know
[1:09:48] nicer roads
[1:09:51] and i thought well not just that energy
[1:09:52] i thank you for this far laying down
[1:09:54] through here
[1:09:55] thank you jesus
[1:09:57] i'm missing everything
[1:09:59] if you're really surrendered you'll be
[1:10:00] thankful for everything
[1:10:02] and you'll grumble about
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] nothing
[1:10:10] nothing to grumble about when you're
[1:10:12] completely in the hands of god you know
[1:10:13] that he's taking care of you he promised
[1:10:16] to supply all your needs all your life
[1:10:19] and he promised to take you through the
[1:10:21] hard places
[1:10:22] oh my
[1:10:24] it's just like a wedding when you take
[1:10:25] your vows it's for the better for the
[1:10:27] worse it's for richer or if you're poor
[1:10:29] it's for sickness or for health
[1:10:33] as long as you shall live
[1:10:36] i'm gonna believe that
[1:10:41] it is
[1:10:42] another thought
[1:10:44] what you receive when you completely
[1:10:46] surrender is
[1:10:48] those trips give it up
[1:10:51] for nothing
[1:10:53] let me just say this i believe you're
[1:10:55] genuinely born again
[1:10:59] the further away you get from god
[1:11:01] there's a serious backsliding in
[1:11:02] december eight how many of that people
[1:11:04] people backsliding
[1:11:09] and can you stop it how do you stop it
[1:11:12] preach harder explain it harder
[1:11:14] pray for him yeah
[1:11:16] but really the only thing that's going
[1:11:17] to stop him is
[1:11:19] god
[1:11:20] it's really the only thing that's going
[1:11:22] to stop it
[1:11:23] and whether that person is a child of
[1:11:25] god or not
[1:11:27] because if you're a child of god you're
[1:11:28] elected and god knew what you would do
[1:11:31] you'll be so miserable
[1:11:34] you'll be so miserable that you just got
[1:11:36] to get right
[1:11:40] no you're not gonna take your own life
[1:11:41] you should become
[1:11:43] i gotta get right with god
[1:11:46] folks and i i believe that most
[1:11:48] christians that's been a christian any
[1:11:50] time have gotten that way
[1:11:52] because it's part of learning it's part
[1:11:53] of learning to walk
[1:11:54] it's about learning what to abstain from
[1:11:56] and stay away from and and so forth even
[1:11:59] the thoughts that come to your mind you
[1:12:00] got to stay away from it and that right
[1:12:03] amen and you'll it'll take you down the
[1:12:05] road and make you completely miserable
[1:12:08] and you'll remember where he was if you
[1:12:09] was like i say if he was genuinely born
[1:12:12] again if you weren't genuinely born
[1:12:14] again you just had a taste of it anyway
[1:12:17] you won't mind going out into that and
[1:12:18] staying out in it
[1:12:21] but if you're a child of god you come
[1:12:23] back
[1:12:24] those treasures of having that peace of
[1:12:27] god that's more valuable than any money
[1:12:30] could ever get in this world
[1:12:34] it's more fun than any fun that you can
[1:12:36] ever have
[1:12:38] i want a resounding amen on that one
[1:12:41] amen it is more fun than any time you
[1:12:44] can ever have
[1:12:48] is to have
[1:12:49] jesus i'd rather have jesus
[1:12:52] than worldwide fame
[1:12:53] pleasure whatever it is i would rather
[1:12:56] have
[1:12:57] jesus
[1:12:58] you find out he's the greatest treasure
[1:13:00] there is
[1:13:01] there's nothing more valuable in your
[1:13:02] life
[1:13:03] than jesus christ working out his plan
[1:13:06] his will in your life
[1:13:10] and then no matter what comes your way
[1:13:13] most of all
[1:13:15] that love that you have with him
[1:13:23] that peace that you
[1:13:26] have
[1:13:27] that joy that you have
[1:13:31] i wrote down here
[1:13:33] all of our senses
[1:13:36] we got see taste feel hear
[1:13:38] smell
[1:13:39] we got memory
[1:13:41] we got conscience that can really bother
[1:13:43] us bad
[1:13:45] that's why most people coming back from
[1:13:47] wars and things you know especially if
[1:13:49] it's not just war and they've killed
[1:13:51] moms and babies and everything else they
[1:13:53] come back and it's it can mess you up
[1:13:57] huh
[1:13:59] i'm sure it takes the blood of jesus
[1:14:00] christ and complete forgiveness of god
[1:14:03] to get that cleared up
[1:14:05] don't help them with that
[1:14:07] because a lot of them just have to
[1:14:08] follow orders and do but
[1:14:10] there comes a place in time and place
[1:14:12] and war no doubt that you're gonna say
[1:14:13] look you're gonna have to shoot me
[1:14:14] because i'm gonna do that
[1:14:16] that right
[1:14:18] and if people aren't willing to die
[1:14:21] well they're gonna have to do what
[1:14:22] they're supposed to do
[1:14:25] your memory huh conscience memory
[1:14:28] reasoning
[1:14:31] all of these things all of these things
[1:14:32] that we have
[1:14:34] it has to be filled
[1:14:37] there has to be a satisfaction or
[1:14:39] doesn't it
[1:14:41] do you see how the world's trying to get
[1:14:42] satisfaction look at them
[1:14:44] they're trying to get satisfaction they
[1:14:46] want to feel good
[1:14:50] things bothers them
[1:14:53] so that's why they go to the bars and
[1:14:54] drink and smoke and all these other
[1:14:56] stuff hello
[1:14:57] things finally try to get their
[1:14:59] conscience clear to try to forget what
[1:15:01] they are really like
[1:15:04] huh
[1:15:06] all these places has to be filled with
[1:15:08] god
[1:15:10] and how many believes he can
[1:15:12] it can all be brought unto the holy
[1:15:14] spirit to where you have a free and
[1:15:16] happy conscience where you can sleep
[1:15:19] good at night
[1:15:24] my i don't know about you but i like to
[1:15:25] sleep good at night
[1:15:35] i like to feel good do you like to feel
[1:15:37] good
[1:15:38] none of us like to feel bad
[1:15:41] i mean we have feelings god made us with
[1:15:43] feelings and but those feelings were
[1:15:45] meant to be operated and felt we're
[1:15:47] meant to feel god
[1:15:49] we're meant to feel the holy spirit
[1:15:51] we're meant to feel peace and love and
[1:15:53] affection
[1:15:55] have affection and so forth that's why
[1:15:57] we were given those things
[1:16:01] and i treasure the fact that
[1:16:03] god takes care of all those things your
[1:16:06] memory
[1:16:07] when he brings back up your past
[1:16:10] oh look at my past look at that you can
[1:16:12] say that's under the blood i know
[1:16:14] because god has given me peace about it
[1:16:16] so don't remind me
[1:16:19] i'm sure everybody in here has to block
[1:16:20] out thoughts of your past
[1:16:24] sure
[1:16:26] so that you can operate you can have
[1:16:28] peace
[1:16:29] with god
[1:16:31] it's the one of the greatest treasures
[1:16:33] there is
[1:16:35] peace comes through forgiveness
[1:16:38] forgiveness comes through a complete
[1:16:40] surrendered life to god
[1:16:43] more power if you want more power
[1:16:47] how many wants more power
[1:16:49] can i tell you how
[1:16:51] let me
[1:16:52] tell you what the prophet said about
[1:17:00] having more power because i'm sure we
[1:17:02] all could use a little more holy ghost
[1:17:04] power right
[1:17:07] rabbi says and humble thyself i truly
[1:17:09] believe that brother unveil said what he
[1:17:11] said is the truth
[1:17:13] that god will never put his holy spirit
[1:17:15] in an unholy unrighteous disobedient
[1:17:18] temple
[1:17:19] no it's god come in the way of a
[1:17:21] cleansing of our hearts from all god and
[1:17:23] iniquity that we might be pure before
[1:17:26] god and then he might work his holy pure
[1:17:28] holy spirit through us
[1:17:30] to bring us to these things bring thee
[1:17:32] things to pass
[1:17:34] you know people want power
[1:17:36] and they don't really know what power is
[1:17:39] they don't really know what goes with it
[1:17:42] the way up
[1:17:45] now
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:48] how many places
[1:17:50] the way up is down if you really want
[1:17:51] power
[1:17:54] see how humble
[1:17:57] you can be
[1:17:59] how many knows it takes humility to even
[1:18:01] surrender
[1:18:06] when you're wrong
[1:18:07] it takes humility like i did with my son
[1:18:10] son you're right hey i'm your dad don't
[1:18:12] talk to me like that i could have said
[1:18:14] that
[1:18:15] i ain't putting up with no but i look
[1:18:17] that's the truth now i'm gonna humble
[1:18:18] myself and say look i apologize you're
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:22] huh
[1:18:23] takes humility
[1:18:26] see how humble you can get
[1:18:28] just get away from all your worldly
[1:18:30] thinking and thinking and humble
[1:18:32] yourselves before god
[1:18:33] and then you've got more power than the
[1:18:35] man that runs all over the building
[1:18:37] makes a lot of noise
[1:18:39] but during the week he just can't
[1:18:40] control his self
[1:18:42] huh i put that extra in there but that's
[1:18:45] basically what he's saying because
[1:18:47] people can run a little building and
[1:18:48] they can shout and scream and speak in
[1:18:50] tongues
[1:18:51] they still don't got power
[1:18:54] if they haven't done this next phrase
[1:18:58] see make a whole lot of noise
[1:19:00] because you've been able
[1:19:02] to conquer
[1:19:04] yourself
[1:19:08] oh praise the lord it's just never
[1:19:10] ending the word of god is just never
[1:19:11] ending
[1:19:16] what is the biggest battle you'll ever
[1:19:18] fight
[1:19:21] think about it that comes easy right the
[1:19:24] biggest battle you'll ever fight
[1:19:28] is fighting yourself
[1:19:32] and i say that because brother banham
[1:19:34] said your greatest enemy
[1:19:37] is yourself right
[1:19:39] if your greatest enemy is yourself and
[1:19:41] that's going to be your biggest battle
[1:19:44] and it will also be your biggest victory
[1:19:50] imagine have so much power by the time
[1:19:52] somebody comes up and up slaps you
[1:19:53] upside down
[1:19:56] huh
[1:19:58] and to actually let nothing in there
[1:20:01] riley
[1:20:04] because our flesh would want to jump
[1:20:06] real quick
[1:20:08] they would take the power of the holy
[1:20:09] ghost
[1:20:10] to ask one question
[1:20:13] why did you do that
[1:20:17] huh why did you do that
[1:20:25] because i don't like you
[1:20:27] could you say well i like you can i give
[1:20:29] you a hug
[1:20:38] here's the other one
[1:20:43] smacks your jaws over to the side
[1:20:48] now can i give you a hug i love you i'm
[1:20:49] praying for you
[1:20:51] he wouldn't know what to do with you
[1:20:53] what is wrong with that guy let me tell
[1:20:55] you that would be real
[1:20:58] power the easiest the easy thing must be
[1:21:02] gone
[1:21:08] that would be easy wouldn't it the flash
[1:21:10] should be so easy for the flesh to do
[1:21:11] that
[1:21:13] you want to smack me i do bigger stuff
[1:21:15] than that
[1:21:16] huh but the flesh always it wants to
[1:21:19] just rile up
[1:21:21] but listen
[1:21:22] wouldn't that be good
[1:21:23] do you know the lord jesus
[1:21:26] he would
[1:21:26] ask what gives you such power how can
[1:21:30] you contain yourself
[1:21:32] how can you control yourself what do you
[1:21:34] think road rage is
[1:21:37] people can't control their self
[1:21:40] they have no power
[1:21:42] over their flesh
[1:21:46] how many knows we need power over this
[1:21:48] flesh
[1:21:49] if you can conquer this listen to what
[1:21:50] the prophet said then you've got more
[1:21:52] power
[1:21:53] you've been able to conquer yourself and
[1:21:56] commit yourself to god
[1:22:00] you would say if you smack me jesus said
[1:22:02] if somebody smacks you turn the other
[1:22:04] cheek
[1:22:05] how many knows they smacked him they
[1:22:07] plucked his beard they spit on him
[1:22:10] did he ever have one little a little
[1:22:13] animosity against them no
[1:22:16] what did he say he says
[1:22:18] father
[1:22:20] forgive them
[1:22:22] he didn't even say look at them and say
[1:22:24] i forgive you for that
[1:22:26] because
[1:22:27] maybe they would think he would be doing
[1:22:29] something he says father forgive them
[1:22:32] for they don't know what to do in his
[1:22:34] heart he wanted them forgiven
[1:22:39] amen that's
[1:22:40] and remember after jesus said all these
[1:22:43] things go the extra mile do all these
[1:22:45] things the last thing he said be
[1:22:48] perfect
[1:22:49] even as your heavenly father is perfect
[1:22:53] i believe
[1:22:54] means
[1:22:55] be
[1:22:56] perfectly
[1:22:58] in christ
[1:23:00] completely in christ
[1:23:03] amen because if you're not completely in
[1:23:05] christ
[1:23:06] you won't be able to do some of those
[1:23:08] things
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:12] humble yourself before him that's really
[1:23:15] power
[1:23:17] you showed me a church that's humble
[1:23:18] real humble not arrogant
[1:23:21] folks i've lived long enough to know
[1:23:23] whether it's me you or anybody in the
[1:23:25] church you let somebody think they're
[1:23:28] better than somebody else you let
[1:23:29] somebody to think they know more about
[1:23:31] it than somebody else you got trouble on
[1:23:33] your hands
[1:23:35] immediate pride is immediate trouble
[1:23:40] and it's not of god
[1:23:45] not an arrogant
[1:23:46] just a sweet
[1:23:48] humble church
[1:23:50] and i'll show you a church that has
[1:23:52] favor and power
[1:23:54] of god in it
[1:23:56] that's right
[1:23:59] 2022
[1:24:03] how many would say that's we want that
[1:24:05] in our church
[1:24:06] let's have that in our church no pride
[1:24:10] just humble everybody else is better
[1:24:13] than you everybody else knows more about
[1:24:16] it than you
[1:24:19] and if you have to correct somebody do
[1:24:21] it in gentleness and in sweetness and in
[1:24:24] love
[1:24:25] how many believe that
[1:24:28] because we want i want the power of god
[1:24:31] in my life
[1:24:33] and then i want the power of god
[1:24:35] in your life
[1:24:38] we'll only achieve it by following the
[1:24:40] directions
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:46] so how many kept their foot off the gas
[1:24:49] pedal this week
[1:24:52] hey come on there we go
[1:24:55] tommy yeah
[1:24:58] one hand come on folks
[1:25:02] i have my hands up i kept it off
[1:25:06] you know i said this ain't so hard
[1:25:10] do you know what i had a sweet thought i
[1:25:12] had a good thought whenever i was doing
[1:25:14] it you had kept it off and i thought you
[1:25:15] know
[1:25:17] if god asks us you'll should like this
[1:25:20] if god asks us to do something for him
[1:25:24] why is it so hard
[1:25:28] the greatest honor that we can have or
[1:25:30] do
[1:25:30] have is to do something that god asks us
[1:25:33] to do
[1:25:36] i mean it's doing it for
[1:25:38] god because why
[1:25:41] not because that's going to get you to
[1:25:43] heaven
[1:25:44] we don't go to heaven by our works
[1:25:48] but if we say we love god and don't keep
[1:25:50] his commandments the bible calls us a
[1:25:52] liar
[1:25:54] we do it
[1:25:55] because
[1:25:56] because he saved us he's given the holy
[1:25:59] ghost
[1:26:00] and we want to be like enoch we want to
[1:26:02] be pleasing to god
[1:26:05] that's why i do it because i want to be
[1:26:07] pleasing to god
[1:26:09] another thought that the lord gave me he
[1:26:10] says you honor god and god will honor
[1:26:13] you
[1:26:14] you want to see god heal you when you're
[1:26:16] sick you want to do this
[1:26:18] how well have you got
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] because that's how much
[1:26:26] god's going to honor you
[1:26:29] then brother ban says above everything
[1:26:31] love god and love one another
[1:26:34] and be humble with god and around one
[1:26:36] another and god will bless it it's hard
[1:26:38] telling what he will do usually when a
[1:26:40] church begins to get in numbers and get
[1:26:42] a little bigger and something like that
[1:26:44] then they get away from that real thing
[1:26:48] the real
[1:26:49] thing
[1:26:51] not to think not necessarily just a
[1:26:53] church we got a big church we got a good
[1:26:55] group god's blessings with a good group
[1:26:56] of people i mean thankful for a good
[1:26:58] group of people
[1:26:59] folks i'm thankful for it
[1:27:02] and but the thing is that i think about
[1:27:04] it is god has prospered us how many has
[1:27:07] prospered god has prospered you he's
[1:27:09] blessed you
[1:27:11] god's good to you
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:15] but even those things if you aren't
[1:27:17] careful
[1:27:18] right
[1:27:20] can lead you away from god
[1:27:23] if you get the soft you begin dirty you
[1:27:26] get
[1:27:27] not having that real love anymore not
[1:27:29] that real zeal for god anymore
[1:27:34] got a nice warm home and
[1:27:36] so forth and you got a nice screen and
[1:27:39] you got a computer and you can just
[1:27:42] watch church at home
[1:27:45] now like i say we're in a pandemic in
[1:27:48] our elderly and so forth i'm not getting
[1:27:50] on people that should baby be home but
[1:27:52] anybody that is not sick you're doing
[1:27:55] just fine here's just lazy
[1:27:57] you deserve a rebuke
[1:28:00] it's not pleasing to the lord
[1:28:03] amen it's not
[1:28:06] you well you got a long way you're just
[1:28:08] out of the other but
[1:28:10] you know
[1:28:11] you're young and so forth and can do it
[1:28:14] amen and i'm not preaching to anybody
[1:28:16] but yet i'm preaching to everybody
[1:28:19] because i don't want it i don't want it
[1:28:20] to get that way in this church because
[1:28:21] it isn't a lot of churches for people
[1:28:23] just get too lazy and just stay home for
[1:28:25] no reason
[1:28:27] bible didn't say to do that come
[1:28:28] together
[1:28:30] assemble ourselves together but anyway
[1:28:32] listen so it talks about that get better
[1:28:34] things and everything else we get away
[1:28:36] from that real
[1:28:37] devotion that dedication that waiting
[1:28:40] for the lord to come let me just close
[1:28:42] with this
[1:28:48] you reap benefits of calvary
[1:28:51] when you completely surrender yourself
[1:28:53] to god
[1:28:54] and you possess
[1:28:56] the richest things
[1:28:58] that jesus died on calvary for
[1:29:02] that is peace
[1:29:03] it's love it's joy it's salvation it's
[1:29:07] fellowship
[1:29:09] protection i mean it's protection
[1:29:13] a lot of these
[1:29:14] people have uh you know they're there
[1:29:17] what do they call it it's private
[1:29:18] security
[1:29:20] to watch over them
[1:29:22] huh
[1:29:22] how many knows you got private security
[1:29:25] you got angels watching over you
[1:29:28] nothing can happen to you them angels
[1:29:30] protect you
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:34] and this best thing of all is that love
[1:29:37] of god that's in your heart
[1:29:40] that relationship and that
[1:29:42] fellowship
[1:29:46] that you have
[1:29:48] it is so precious
[1:29:50] that you wouldn't want to lose it for
[1:29:53] nothing
[1:29:55] now how many knows it was so precious in
[1:29:58] the dark ages
[1:30:02] that they
[1:30:04] would rather be fed to a lion than to
[1:30:06] give it up
[1:30:08] and his big
[1:30:10] claws and ripped me to wreck me apart
[1:30:13] until i'm dead but i
[1:30:16] don't want to lose this
[1:30:19] huh
[1:30:20] burn me at the stake whatever you want
[1:30:23] to do but i'm can't let go of this
[1:30:28] amen
[1:30:29] how many remember now remember in this
[1:30:31] laodicea people will forfeit your holy
[1:30:33] spirit for this
[1:30:35] little slightest little whim
[1:30:38] least little thing
[1:30:42] paul said it this way who shall separate
[1:30:44] us from the love of god
[1:30:47] shall tribulation
[1:30:49] huh
[1:30:52] shall bad times
[1:30:54] hard times is this going to separate you
[1:30:56] not if you're really completely
[1:30:58] surrendered
[1:31:00] you know job look at joe
[1:31:02] a lot what he lost
[1:31:05] and and and
[1:31:08] the other person that i i think about is
[1:31:10] the person that
[1:31:13] that song
[1:31:15] it is well with my soul
[1:31:18] i'm not sure if his two daughters his
[1:31:20] wife and a couple of his children right
[1:31:23] went down in the ocean the went
[1:31:25] down isn't that right
[1:31:27] from what i understand when he was going
[1:31:29] across that same spot
[1:31:32] he wrote that song
[1:31:34] it's a precious song
[1:31:36] it talks about when trials come my way
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:39] waves like
[1:31:40] trials like see billows roll
[1:31:43] amen whatever that was whatever my lot
[1:31:46] die has taught me to say it is well
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:55] that's family
[1:31:56] members people that you love so much and
[1:31:59] then you can still say it's well
[1:32:02] why because christ is there
[1:32:05] paul said distress persecution
[1:32:08] famine
[1:32:09] nakedness
[1:32:11] peril sword
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:13] and as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:32:15] killed all the way along we are counted
[1:32:17] as sheep to the slaughter but nay in all
[1:32:19] these things i am convinced
[1:32:24] through all these things we are more
[1:32:26] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:32:28] us if i persuaded that neither death
[1:32:32] life
[1:32:33] angels principalities powers
[1:32:37] things present things to come
[1:32:39] and aren't you glad for that kind of god
[1:32:42] for that kind of anchor in your life
[1:32:44] that
[1:32:45] all these lukewarmness layouts riches
[1:32:48] cares of life all these things
[1:32:51] it's not going to separate me from my
[1:32:53] love for god how many is with me
[1:32:55] none of these things
[1:32:57] are going to separate from me
[1:32:59] from the way that i love god
[1:33:02] not things present nor things to come
[1:33:05] not height not depth nor any creatures
[1:33:07] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:33:09] love of god
[1:33:11] which was in which is in christ jesus
[1:33:14] our
[1:33:15] lord
[1:33:17] amen god bless you let's stand musicians

[1:33:55] to the lord
[1:33:59] i hope you feel closer to him than you
[1:34:01] have in weeks past
[1:34:03] we must get closer to him
[1:34:06] there's only one way to do that and that
[1:34:08] is to dedicate ourselves more
[1:34:10] humble ourselves more
[1:34:13] commit ourselves more
[1:34:16] to the word of god
[1:34:18] and to please and to be pleasing to him
[1:34:24] how many would raise their hand and say

[1:34:49] closer to you lord jesus

[1:35:00] contrary to you and to your word lord
[1:35:03] father our prophet taught us that eve
[1:35:06] brought us into this condition by
[1:35:07] disbelieving one word
[1:35:09] and we have to believe all of the word
[1:35:11] if we're going to be restored again to
[1:35:13] the garden of eden
[1:35:14] and lord that's our desire is to take
