[35:34] amen as we continue our journey
[35:37] amen down this road that we get to
[35:39] finish one day
[35:41] and so uh i was listening brother
[35:44] branham's life story last evening and i
[35:46] was very tempted to play that
[35:48] uh life story this morning amen i said
[35:51] lord if you want me to play that i will
[35:52] but then he
[35:53] seemed to lay something on my heart so
[35:56] but i'll tell you i really
[35:57] enjoy that that life story this will be
[36:00] tying into that just a little bit
[36:02] but that was preached in 59 i know he
[36:04] preached he ministered life story many
[36:06] times but
[36:08] this one he preached in 59 and i enjoyed
[36:11] that uh
[36:12] some of the things that he said amen so
[36:14] praise the lord i may always
[36:15] enjoy his listening to brother branham
[36:17] amen i truly believe that he was the
[36:19] best preacher of this whole generation
[36:21] amen
[36:22] you won't listen to a better preacher
[36:23] than the prophet of god amen so
[36:26] joel 2
[36:30] and we'll begin with
[36:35] verse 23 joel 2 and verse
[36:39] 23
[36:42] be glad then ye children of zion and
[36:45] rejoice in the lord
[36:46] your god for he hath given you the
[36:49] former reign moderately
[36:51] and he will cause to come down to you
[36:54] the rain the former rain
[36:55] and the latter rain in the first month
[36:58] now brother banham taught
[37:00] a double portion of rain amen in that
[37:03] latter rain so
[37:05] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[37:08] the vats shall overflow with wine
[37:10] and oil and i will restore
[37:14] to you the years that the locust has
[37:16] eaten the canker worm the caterpillar
[37:18] the palmer worm my great army which i
[37:21] sent among you
[37:22] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[37:25] and praise the name of the lord your god
[37:28] that hath dealt wondrously with you
[37:31] and my people shall never be a shame
[37:35] amen may god
[37:36] add his blessings to the reading of the
[37:37] word you can be seated this morning
[37:39] i want to talk about restoration this
[37:41] morning restoration
[37:43] and i'll call it also going back
[37:48] going back amen now
[37:51] most of the time and when we ever we're
[37:54] we don't usually speak so much about
[37:57] going back we usually speak about
[37:59] going forward and not looking back and
[38:01] that right so
[38:03] i've come to the conclusion that there's
[38:06] a time to look back
[38:07] and there's a time not to look back amen
[38:11] just depends on which way you're going
[38:13] and we'll
[38:14] try to cover this for you just for a
[38:16] little bit but let's first of all talk
[38:17] about
[38:18] not looking back and not going back
[38:20] because there's an aspect that
[38:22] you know we as christians we don't look
[38:24] back we don't we don't go back amen
[38:27] but what we don't do is like lot's wife
[38:29] i believe it said
[38:31] over in luke the 17th chapter it says
[38:34] in verse 32 he says remember
[38:38] lot's wife amen remember lot's wife he
[38:42] said so
[38:43] jesus one place there was telling us you
[38:45] know and he was speaking about whosoever
[38:48] shall seek to save his life shall lose
[38:50] it
[38:50] and who whosoever shall lose his life
[38:52] shall preserve it
[38:54] amen so you can't look back at your old
[38:57] life
[38:57] and the way that you used to live and
[38:59] amen you can't look to that
[39:01] remember lot's wife she looked back she
[39:03] kind of desired
[39:04] sodom she likes adam and gamora isn't
[39:07] that right because
[39:09] it treated her good she could do
[39:11] whatever she wants she had all the fancy
[39:13] things she had
[39:14] life was good she had her way down there
[39:16] isn't that right
[39:17] you know people like their way people
[39:19] like to do what they want to do
[39:21] they like the deluxe things of life and
[39:24] so forth and the luxuries of life
[39:26] people like and sometimes you know if
[39:28] you aren't careful as a christian you
[39:30] tend to look back
[39:32] back and that's one thing jesus said
[39:34] that he needs to remember that when it
[39:35] comes to that that's not something that
[39:37] you want to do is to look back
[39:39] amen never look back amen look only
[39:41] forward
[39:42] amen only direction that you want to
[39:45] look is forward
[39:46] because we know that she because she did
[39:49] how many knows the angel that says you
[39:51] know
[39:51] leave this place and don't look back
[39:55] minute so they all left the place but
[39:56] she's the only one that turned
[39:59] to look back and because she looked back
[40:03] she was turned into a pillar of salt and
[40:05] is there i guess as a memorial
[40:08] even unto today not right
[40:11] so there's times and things that you
[40:13] want there's certainly things that you
[40:15] don't want to look back
[40:16] to that's your old life amen
[40:20] and so over and also in luke the
[40:24] ninth chapter and verse 59 he says and
[40:27] he said unto another follow me
[40:30] but he said suffer me first to go
[40:33] and bury my father jesus said unto him
[40:37] let the dead bury the dead but go thou
[40:41] and preach the kingdom of god
[40:44] amen wow
[40:47] that's quite something in it his own
[40:50] father
[40:52] jesus says i mean he believes it that's
[40:56] the kind of commitment that god is
[40:57] looking for
[40:58] amen you'll drop everything you'll leave
[41:01] everything
[41:04] even your own life also if you're not
[41:06] willing to forsake
[41:07] it to follow me you're not worthy of
[41:10] following me i mean he believes
[41:11] it takes a complete commitment to follow
[41:14] the lord
[41:15] don't try to drag the old thing we're
[41:16] taught in this hour that
[41:18] amen when you come to the message of
[41:20] this hour you got to forget what
[41:21] pentecost taught you
[41:23] you forget about methodist and baptist
[41:25] nominee you're going to forget all about
[41:27] what you always ever thought
[41:29] amen you can't put new wine in that
[41:31] right in old bottles say man
[41:33] it's got to be new bottles put in new
[41:35] wine and so forth and
[41:37] and then you try to drag that stuff in
[41:39] there it'll contaminate it it's not it
[41:41] won't work
[41:42] you got to forget everything that you
[41:44] was ever taught amen especially the
[41:46] things that's wrong because
[41:47] there's so many things that we were
[41:49] taught wrong in our past
[41:52] amen so looking back thinking about
[41:54] looking back
[41:55] there he says to this he let go and
[41:56] preach the gospel and another said also
[41:58] lord
[41:59] i will follow thee but let me first go
[42:01] bid them farewell
[42:03] which are at home at my house and jesus
[42:05] said unto him no man having put his hand
[42:07] to the power
[42:08] and looking back is fit for the kingdom
[42:11] of god amen so
[42:13] there are some instances and cases you
[42:14] know amen places where you don't need to
[42:17] look back you don't want to look back
[42:18] you're commanded
[42:20] not to look back amen
[42:24] you know and philippians paul he also
[42:26] said in philippians 3
[42:28] and verse 12 he says you know uh
[42:31] verse 13 brethren i count not myself to
[42:35] have
[42:35] apprehended but this one thing i do
[42:38] forgetting those things which are behind
[42:41] that right and reaching forth unto those
[42:43] things which i
[42:45] which are before amen so paul even he
[42:48] had learned not to
[42:50] look back to the old things and he
[42:52] looked forward
[42:54] amen to what's ahead of him and i
[42:55] believe that's what we do we look what's
[42:57] ahead
[42:57] but you know on the other aspect of
[42:59] things you know on the other side
[43:01] so the other side of the coin of looking
[43:03] back you know we realized that
[43:06] man as a whole amen after the fall
[43:09] amen and this is the thing of it and
[43:11] then after the fall
[43:13] he meant he became a fallen creature he
[43:15] and he was like in a hole
[43:17] and and we're like in a hole even
[43:19] tonight amber this morning we're like in
[43:21] hole
[43:22] and and we're groaning in paul said
[43:24] we're even groaning amen
[43:26] waiting for the manifestation of the
[43:28] sons of god we're you know we're
[43:29] somewhere we're scrolling we're still
[43:31] we want to get back to the place that we
[43:33] once was
[43:35] amen and that was in that place that we
[43:38] had fellowship with god
[43:40] amen the way that adam was before the
[43:42] fall but
[43:43] he makes a statement amen and believe it
[43:45] was god of this evil age or
[43:46] different places he mentions how that
[43:48] amen we are actually going
[43:50] back to eden as hard as we can
[43:54] amen how many looking forward to that
[43:57] amen and you know i'll tell you what i
[43:59] don't know a few people that live out in
[44:01] the country if you get to sit outside in
[44:02] the chair very much
[44:03] or if you get to go outside and you
[44:05] begin to able to see the beautiful
[44:07] clouds you begin to see the birds you
[44:09] hear the birds
[44:10] you see the beautiful sunset you perhaps
[44:12] you see the beautiful clouds around you
[44:14] know
[44:14] amen and begin to long you begin to long
[44:17] for a day that is eternal
[44:20] where the birds will be perfectly
[44:22] singing forever where their trees will
[44:23] be blooming and green forever
[44:25] there'll never be a fall there there'll
[44:27] never be a winter there
[44:30] amen i believe there's a longing amen
[44:33] and you know one of the things as i
[44:34] begin to think about this the lord begin
[44:36] to
[44:36] move on me about this message you know
[44:40] he says it this way he says you know
[44:43] they just come this was under the sixth
[44:45] seal he says they just come through one
[44:47] of those
[44:47] episodes amen brother maguire
[44:51] he says i think he's here now and they
[44:53] caught him downtown
[44:54] without his western clothes on remember
[44:57] how they have these episodes of
[44:59] how they'd have perhaps a day or so amen
[45:01] and everybody would dress
[45:03] western and then they'll go back the old
[45:05] western base
[45:07] isn't that right it may be long to go
[45:09] back to how it used to be in the western
[45:12] days
[45:12] amen he says without his western clothes
[45:15] and they throw him in jail
[45:17] put up a kangaroo court and made him pay
[45:20] for it and then they made him go out and
[45:21] west
[45:22] buy a western outfit i seen the rest of
[45:25] them walking around with guns about
[45:27] about that long hanging on them they
[45:30] just go negative out there they're
[45:31] trying
[45:32] to live in something in the back days
[45:34] gone by
[45:36] the bygone days
[45:39] amen see and then in kentucky he says
[45:42] you're trying to live in the bygone days
[45:44] of the out of the east here
[45:46] get back in the reno valley and so forth
[45:48] you like to go back
[45:50] to the old days
[45:53] there's some things causing that
[45:58] there's something causing that but when
[46:00] it comes to going back to a gospel
[46:03] back to the original people don't want
[46:06] that
[46:11] amen
[46:12] oh my he said when it comes back to the
[46:15] gospel going back that you want
[46:16] something modern then see
[46:18] but it goes to show he says he goes to
[46:20] show there's something in a man
[46:23] something in man amen that wants to go
[46:26] back to the old days
[46:28] amen how many of them have talked about
[46:30] it and i i tried to pull it up he talks
[46:32] about sometimes we'll get 40 we'll get
[46:34] about 50 years old and all of a sudden
[46:36] we'll get a flat top haircut
[46:38] amen we'll get us a convertible car or
[46:40] we'll get that old camaro we used to
[46:42] have or that
[46:43] firebird that we used to have when we're
[46:45] driving around
[46:47] and we'll go to thinking we're young
[46:48] again
[46:54] huh yeah he talks about people wanting
[46:58] to go back because why
[46:59] because those were the good old days
[47:03] amen the good old days
[47:06] you know and it's amazing how that you
[47:08] can go into stores
[47:10] and you look at a people a person
[47:11] certain people amen perhaps my age
[47:14] around and so forth and
[47:15] they'll be playing certain rock and roll
[47:18] or a certain classic
[47:19] uh uh rock or whatever it might be and i
[47:22] can pretty much tell you
[47:23] what time era those people were from
[47:26] because of the music that
[47:27] listened to amen because i don't know
[47:30] about you but that they're
[47:31] you know nowadays you know they do you
[47:33] know you go back to what you
[47:35] what you really liked and what she was
[47:37] raised up under and
[47:39] you know all of that new stuff that come
[47:41] out brother irvin i'll tell you right
[47:42] now
[47:43] you know whenever old michael jackson
[47:44] come out here he looks like a girl he
[47:46] squeals like a girl
[47:47] you know i just didn't have much for
[47:49] that kind of music
[47:51] or sings like a girl you know what all
[47:53] it is this is all of this new stuff that
[47:55] people are into and now
[47:56] i don't even know where it's at now i
[47:58] don't really care to know but it's so
[48:00] far out there no doubt
[48:02] is that right i think after that just
[48:04] comes to mind now they got into rap and
[48:06] all that other stuff you know
[48:08] and and whatnot you know since this is
[48:10] gone to the dog so if he was back when
[48:12] the dogs back then you know it wasn't no
[48:14] good rock and roll was never
[48:15] any good but you can tell people kind of
[48:17] go back to their roots you go back to
[48:19] what they once
[48:20] was because they'd like to be that again
[48:26] they want to be young again isn't that
[48:29] the truth
[48:31] all right so now listen let's yeah he
[48:34] talks about the western how they'd like
[48:35] to go back to the western day they want
[48:37] to go back to something
[48:39] and then you can take people that want
[48:41] to restore cars even i mean those people
[48:43] like to restore cars
[48:44] amen and whenever whatever time era you
[48:47] was you know
[48:48] and whether it was the old nova or
[48:50] whether it was a chevelle or whether
[48:51] it's a 56 chevy you know
[48:53] you know and people were young at that
[48:55] time and you know
[48:56] then they remember that and people
[48:58] actually go and restore
[49:00] things like that because there's
[49:01] something in
[49:03] them amen because they want to be in a
[49:05] place that they have fallen from
[49:09] that's what restoration and really how
[49:11] many knows the whole
[49:13] whole plan of humanity is about
[49:16] restoration
[49:18] it's all about going back
[49:21] sure it is because remember what
[49:23] redemption means
[49:25] he is our redeemer a redeemed means to
[49:28] bring back
[49:30] back to his original state
[49:33] that it once was amen and we were once
[49:36] with god in that right we were once a
[49:38] part of god
[49:39] amen adam throwed us into this hole amen
[49:42] and not a whole earth is groaning to be
[49:45] back again where they once was
[49:47] especially god's children
[49:50] amen they want to be they want to be
[49:52] restored they want to be brought
[49:54] back to what they once were
[49:58] all right brother even makes a statement
[50:00] about in his life story
[50:10] hmm
[50:15] maybe it's in here
[50:19] no right here it is in front of me i
[50:20] thought it was a life story but it's not
[50:22] it's trying to do god's services about
[50:23] it as well
[50:24] but he makes the statement now notice
[50:27] he says the good heavenly father
[50:29] permitted me to walk behind that curtain
[50:31] one day
[50:32] and see it he says talking about how
[50:34] many heard about that soul what it's
[50:36] under looking a past the curtain of time
[50:39] there it was just the same as i was
[50:41] preaching to y'all
[50:42] there they stood souls under the cry
[50:45] under the elder crying how long not just
[50:47] a myth
[50:48] somebody who had intelligence how long
[50:50] see why
[50:51] we feel that now as our
[50:54] age like brother doll is setting here
[50:58] 93 there's something longing
[51:02] for that young man again there's
[51:05] something uh
[51:06] you'd give anything how i would like to
[51:09] brother jack and all the rest of us go
[51:11] back
[51:13] amen he says here into that young
[51:16] manhood he says what do you want to do
[51:20] that for
[51:22] to be young again and run around no sir
[51:24] because we feel that we'd have more time
[51:27] to glorify god amen and this that we
[51:30] love
[51:31] the god that we love so even brother
[51:33] brandon was saying everybody doesn't
[51:34] matter even
[51:35] christians how many believes it that you
[51:38] have a longing i don't you know as you
[51:40] begin to get older and as you begin to
[51:42] use your strengths and this side or the
[51:44] other and
[51:45] amen and i was talking to sister john
[51:47] east and i was asking how she was doing
[51:49] and if her leg is getting a little
[51:50] better and she's about no not really
[51:52] just about the same i says boy it's sure
[51:54] nice
[51:55] when things get a little better you know
[51:58] you don't want to just
[51:59] stay the same and perhaps as the ogre
[52:02] you get you know that he's healed slower
[52:04] isn't that right
[52:05] amen and you wanna hey man you're you
[52:08] you
[52:08] you wanna be young again you wanna have
[52:11] that youth again you wanna be healed you
[52:12] wanna be restored
[52:14] how much a nice it is you know amen and
[52:17] brother venom you're saying you know it
[52:18] doesn't matter who each one of it
[52:21] us of it is amen we want to be that
[52:23] young again there's something
[52:24] pulling there's something longing amen
[52:26] and that something is in there because
[52:28] god has made us he didn't make us to be
[52:31] old he didn't make us to be feeble
[52:34] he didn't make us be broke down because
[52:36] how many knows that one time we were
[52:38] 20 years old we were strong we were like
[52:41] brother bam says you know he took a
[52:43] picture of you then he says and that's
[52:44] about what you're going to be in
[52:46] eternity for eternity
[52:48] he's right about 20 years old because
[52:49] after that you begin
[52:51] amen to fall and to fall and the fall
[52:54] and the fall
[52:54] isn't that right and there's a longing
[52:56] there amen it doesn't matter who it is
[52:58] in the world you'll see people in better
[53:00] maps that we even long to be young again
[53:03] amen because we are we're in a fallen
[53:06] place a fallen state we desire
[53:08] amen even as you might see a car and
[53:10] it's perhaps got rust and
[53:12] it's old and so forth and you see well i
[53:14] remember when that car was shining
[53:16] i remember when i drove that thing boy
[53:18] it had plenty of power and it drove nice
[53:20] and so forth and
[53:21] you might think i'm going to restore
[53:23] that thing amen that's what god feels
[53:25] about you and i hey man god is going to
[53:27] restore us
[53:29] i'm just glad that he's our true
[53:31] restorer
[53:33] he wants to restore and bring us back to
[53:36] what we once
[53:37] was praise be to god
[53:40] hallelujah oh my
[53:44] so that's what he says now dear brother
[53:46] he says i have this message this morning
[53:48] he says there is a land beyond the river
[53:51] that we call
[53:52] the sweet forever and he says in there
[53:55] we'll glorify him through the ages and
[53:57] all the ages and
[53:59] he roll why do we feel that because
[54:02] there is a deep
[54:03] calling to the deep
[54:08] amen and as long as there's a deep
[54:11] calling there's got to be a deep to
[54:13] respond to that call
[54:14] or there wouldn't be that call
[54:18] praise the lord praise the lord this
[54:20] morning
[54:21] we think about it how did god meant to
[54:23] it's about the cake worm the caterpillar
[54:25] and then we see that even the first
[54:27] church how many knows even the first
[54:29] church
[54:29] how that uh in the book of acts how they
[54:32] had they had
[54:33] so much of the power of god in their
[54:36] life
[54:37] until peter people would just get in the
[54:39] shadow of
[54:40] peter and be healed
[54:46] i guess it happened with jesus i can't
[54:48] think of an instant right now before
[54:49] they would just get in the shadow i know
[54:51] they touched that movie's garments but
[54:53] they just got in the shadow of peter
[54:55] amen and they'd raise up and praise be
[54:57] to god what kind of
[54:59] power that church had what kind of a
[55:02] power that church was amen
[55:07] and then we read over in revelations you
[55:09] know it wasn't long after
[55:11] amend the book of acts we find in the
[55:14] first church age the ephesus church age
[55:17] he says nevertheless he says i have
[55:19] somewhat against thee because that has
[55:21] left thy first love
[55:24] amen just begin to let down just begin
[55:27] to get oh
[55:28] just begin to get common huh
[55:32] amen begin to let down begin to fade
[55:34] away like everything that we ever know
[55:37] always wants to fade away and now only
[55:39] the holy spirit can restore us
[55:41] only you god can bring us back
[55:45] hallelujah remember therefore
[55:48] from whence thou art fallen
[55:52] [Music]
[55:53] and repent and do the first works amen
[55:56] how many believes that brother man went
[55:58] into great detail
[55:59] he was telling that church he says you
[56:01] know first you got to go back in your
[56:03] mind
[56:03] of where you fell from amen and then in
[56:07] action begin to go back to the place
[56:09] that you fell from
[56:12] that church age you begin to fall and
[56:14] they begin to fall down through their
[56:15] dark ages
[56:16] and that can't get worm it just begin to
[56:18] eat a way of
[56:19] first their first love was gone then the
[56:22] next time they began to get a little
[56:24] bitter isn't that right
[56:27] they got him bitter they got mirror in
[56:29] their lives they got embalming fluid
[56:32] and then they went into death amen all
[56:34] the way down through those dark ages
[56:36] until we're
[56:37] utterly in other darkness but the spirit
[56:40] said i
[56:41] will restore hallelujah how is that that
[56:45] the holy ghost is in the restoring
[56:47] business
[56:50] oh my i'm so glad for that
[56:53] that he restores like david said my soul
[56:58] amen praise the lord how many believes
[57:01] that and it happens to people
[57:03] a lot of times it happens to christians
[57:06] it happens to churches that you begin
[57:08] amen to fall you begin to
[57:10] get away from prayer you begin to get
[57:12] away from that fire that once
[57:14] burned amen that love that you had for
[57:18] everybody out there one time it begins
[57:21] to fade away
[57:22] and you're in need of a restoration
[57:27] praise the lord let me tell you
[57:29] something i believe that god is
[57:30] restoring the church
[57:32] remember this malachi says he'll turn
[57:35] the hearts of the children back to the
[57:37] faith of the fathers
[57:39] so even in malachi 4 the message of the
[57:43] hour
[57:43] is a restoration message
[57:47] for giving us back to what we once was
[57:49] so what the church one was
[57:51] what people once was with god
[57:54] this morning maybe well come right down
[57:58] home you maybe you have to ask yourself
[58:01] where you as your closest to the lord
[58:04] where was your closest to the lord
[58:08] and if you can't say that you're closer
[58:10] than you was you're in your closest
[58:12] back then then you're not as close to
[58:14] god as what you should be because
[58:16] you're going backwards not forwards
[58:18] maybe we need to go forward not
[58:20] backwards
[58:21] that's right so do you need a
[58:22] restoration if you're not just
[58:24] on fire ever what remember you need a
[58:26] restoration this morning you need to go
[58:28] back
[58:29] how many ways you need to go back to
[58:31] what you was
[58:34] as a question as to what you once was
[58:38] praise the lord i believe god can do it
[58:40] don't you
[58:41] absolutely praise the lord i believe
[58:43] there's a process
[58:45] how many of those there's a pro process
[58:47] that comes with restoration
[58:50] amen a process that comes with it god
[58:53] has to do a work
[58:54] whenever they take something and they
[58:55] begin to work on it amen they begin to
[58:58] do the saturn the other and how many
[59:00] knows that whenever god created the
[59:02] earth and amen and man
[59:04] fell in the garden of eden god already
[59:06] knew that he was going to flood the
[59:08] earth
[59:08] with water why didn't he burn it with
[59:12] fire
[59:13] he could have done it but no god knew
[59:15] that this earth
[59:16] needed a process of restoration
[59:20] and that press that process was that he
[59:23] was going to have to baptize it with
[59:25] water
[59:26] he's going to have to wash it by the
[59:28] water of the word and that right he's
[59:29] going to have to
[59:30] baptize it and he baptized the earth
[59:34] amen with water at that time and it was
[59:36] the first
[59:37] stage of the process was to wash it
[59:40] clean it up
[59:42] amen and then what was the next process
[59:44] the next stage of restoration just like
[59:47] he does the end of it
[59:48] how they believe that god's got to pick
[59:50] you up amen he's got to call you
[59:53] amen that's the first process is to call
[59:56] you amen to get you in this process of
[59:58] restoration
[1:00:01] amen to pick you up to wash it you up
[1:00:04] there's a cup in there right you pick
[1:00:06] the cup up next thing you begin to clean
[1:00:08] it
[1:00:09] the next process was the blood of jesus
[1:00:11] christ
[1:00:12] amen the very blood of god dropped upon
[1:00:15] the earth at calvary
[1:00:17] all of his blood came out and i'll tell
[1:00:18] you what how many believes that there
[1:00:20] was a redeeming work
[1:00:22] being done to this very planet that we
[1:00:25] stand on
[1:00:26] the very earth that we stand on
[1:00:30] hello and that has two meanings
[1:00:34] one meaning is this literal earth
[1:00:38] was sanctified isn't that right this
[1:00:41] literal earth was sanctified at that
[1:00:43] time
[1:00:44] the second meaning is is that you
[1:00:47] as an individual are married out of dirt
[1:00:51] it means this piece of earth also was
[1:00:53] sanctified through the blood
[1:00:56] how do you believe that that's why i
[1:00:58] didn't mean that this was done when you
[1:00:59] go through the process of the new birth
[1:01:02] amen you go by the way of the water you
[1:01:04] go by the way of the blood you can't not
[1:01:07] get sanctified without the blood of
[1:01:08] jesus christ
[1:01:10] dropping upon your heart
[1:01:13] amen and then you get all of those
[1:01:16] desires those things go by the wayside
[1:01:18] you become a pure vessel
[1:01:20] you become a clean vessel god forgives
[1:01:23] you of all your sins
[1:01:25] when the blood dropped on that cross
[1:01:27] amen on the earth all
[1:01:28] men sins were forgiven whosoever will
[1:01:32] let him come isn't that right
[1:01:34] and then that process came and he began
[1:01:36] to do a work
[1:01:38] praise be the god amen but
[1:01:42] from there it isn't enough to pick a cup
[1:01:45] up
[1:01:45] it isn't enough just to clean a cup out
[1:01:48] amen and get it sparkly clean
[1:01:52] how many knows there's another process
[1:01:54] that has to happen
[1:01:58] and that process is there has become a
[1:02:00] filling of that cup
[1:02:02] there has become a fiery baptism
[1:02:07] in other words the holy spirit has to
[1:02:09] come down there is
[1:02:11] something let's just admit it there is
[1:02:13] something special
[1:02:14] that has to happen if you are ever going
[1:02:17] to have the ability
[1:02:18] to be able to call yourself a christian
[1:02:22] because without that pillow fire without
[1:02:24] that personal experience feather man
[1:02:26] says you ain't fit to call yourself a
[1:02:28] christian
[1:02:28] you ain't fit to be behind the ball but
[1:02:30] you ain't seen the cake communion
[1:02:32] you ain't seen to call yourself a
[1:02:33] christian unless that baptism has taken
[1:02:36] place
[1:02:40] hallelujah how many know this world is
[1:02:43] in for a fire baptism
[1:02:45] unlike you have ever seen or can ever
[1:02:48] imagine it's gonna burn until the very
[1:02:52] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:02:54] the heavens are gonna be on fire the
[1:02:56] earth is gonna be on fire
[1:02:58] and god's gonna expand this thing i
[1:03:00] believe he said he's going to just
[1:03:02] bring it into ashes
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:05] new law will spew far from the center of
[1:03:08] the earth amen and when we come back
[1:03:10] friends for the new heavens and the new
[1:03:11] earth
[1:03:12] i'm killing you right now amen in the
[1:03:14] millennium we're going to walk out on
[1:03:15] the ashes of the wicked and it's going
[1:03:17] to be an
[1:03:18] eden unlike you have ever imagined
[1:03:24] praise be to almighty god you used to be
[1:03:26] out there in the world
[1:03:28] amen you used to live in sin and
[1:03:29] debauchery and misery and
[1:03:31] every devil could make its abode in your
[1:03:33] heart but after the baptism of the holy
[1:03:35] ghost comes in
[1:03:36] he washes all them devils out he burns
[1:03:39] every german every sister out of
[1:03:40] your heart hallelujah it becomes a new
[1:03:45] place
[1:03:46] amen and you can leap for joy amen if
[1:03:49] you had wings you'd fly
[1:03:53] why because there is such a peace there
[1:03:55] is such a joy
[1:03:56] there's such newness of life
[1:04:00] a new creature a new creature
[1:04:04] honey believes it's a process god takes
[1:04:06] us through that process
[1:04:08] and if we don't go through that whole
[1:04:09] process amen we're still somewhere
[1:04:12] stuck in the middle in the middle of
[1:04:14] restoration
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:29] praise be to god you love him this
[1:04:32] morning
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:35] how many needs more of that fire say
[1:04:38] hey lord i need more of that fire
[1:04:41] you need more of that than anything else
[1:04:43] in this world
[1:04:44] you need more of that fire how do you
[1:04:47] get that fire
[1:04:49] but how much you get rid of your old
[1:04:51] self
[1:04:52] leave your old self your old thinking
[1:04:54] your whole ways behind say i'm coming to
[1:04:57] follow you
[1:04:58] i ain't worried about what i got to do
[1:04:59] here my lord i'm just coming completely
[1:05:02] so you can do a work
[1:05:03] of restoration for me and that person
[1:05:06] has to be restored
[1:05:08] i mean it's in our hearts in the lives
[1:05:10] of each and every one
[1:05:12] amen we are to earnestly
[1:05:17] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:05:20] once delivered to the saints how many
[1:05:23] believe that that but
[1:05:24] i truly believe that malachi 4 that word
[1:05:28] is not going to return void
[1:05:32] it's going to accomplish what god said
[1:05:34] it was going to do
[1:05:35] it's going to take people back to the
[1:05:37] very faith that peter and paul and jesus
[1:05:40] and
[1:05:40] all of the disciples all that they had i
[1:05:42] believe it's going to bring a people to
[1:05:44] that place
[1:05:45] it's going to restore sooner or later
[1:05:49] it's going to happen amen
[1:05:53] and just as we can get ourselves out of
[1:05:55] the way and that we can die to ourself
[1:05:58] that faith can come in let me tell you
[1:06:01] something you won't
[1:06:02] get any more of god until you make more
[1:06:04] room for god
[1:06:05] how many believes you've got to make
[1:06:07] room for god god's got to have a little
[1:06:09] bit of room
[1:06:11] he's got to have some time he's got to
[1:06:13] have so you have your mind he's got to
[1:06:15] have your heart he's got to have your
[1:06:19] thinking but no we're thinking about
[1:06:20] everything else all the time no wonder
[1:06:22] god can't do nothing for us
[1:06:24] no wonder he can't bring a stimulation
[1:06:26] revelation
[1:06:30] bring our blind by lord bring our minds
[1:06:32] back and and then bring it back to the
[1:06:34] original place that we once had
[1:06:36] amen the joy that we once had the fire
[1:06:38] that we once had
[1:06:42] amen god is still
[1:06:46] doing it he's still in the business this
[1:06:48] morning
[1:06:49] god is going to bring it back if you're
[1:06:52] a child of god you're going to be in the
[1:06:53] restoring process amen
[1:06:58] oh we pray we pray lord give me this and
[1:07:01] give me the
[1:07:02] lord make life easy and god says man
[1:07:04] that's just the opposite
[1:07:05] of what i'm gonna give you we always
[1:07:08] want things
[1:07:08] easy when once he's comfortable and
[1:07:10] god's in the business of making things
[1:07:12] hard sometimes for us
[1:07:14] making things rough because he wants to
[1:07:17] see how we do when things not going so
[1:07:18] good see if we really have the faith
[1:07:20] because that is the goal that god wants
[1:07:22] to live with
[1:07:25] trials temptations hardships different
[1:07:27] things come our way
[1:07:30] because god's want to live with somebody
[1:07:32] that wants to love him and will serve
[1:07:34] him no matter
[1:07:35] what not just the good times
[1:07:39] but in the bad times not unjust the good
[1:07:42] things of life but in the bad things of
[1:07:44] life why do you think he let it get that
[1:07:46] way
[1:07:47] amen praise be to god i know about you
[1:07:50] but i'm going to be one happy camper
[1:07:52] when we get to the other side and there
[1:07:54] is no more
[1:07:54] trial there's no more tests there is no
[1:07:56] more sickness there is no more sorrow
[1:07:59] there is no more good days and bad days
[1:08:01] there's no ups and there's no downs
[1:08:04] there's no old age and no gray hair no
[1:08:06] getting feeble
[1:08:08] no sickness no coronavirus
[1:08:11] huh i was just thinking the other day
[1:08:14] isn't it gonna be nice when we can say
[1:08:16] hey
[1:08:16] the coroner's past man
[1:08:20] huh are we all gonna be glad things are
[1:08:22] a little bit back to normal
[1:08:24] a little bit now we know things are
[1:08:25] never going to be completely normal
[1:08:26] because this
[1:08:27] this this world's going downhill
[1:08:31] really really fast so i don't think it's
[1:08:33] going to go backwards so it's going to
[1:08:34] keep going getting worse
[1:08:36] we have thus saith the lord you watch
[1:08:38] you'll get worse and worse until the
[1:08:39] skies catch on fire
[1:08:41] is that right that's right but i'm
[1:08:44] looking forward to it i don't know about
[1:08:45] you but i'm looking forward to
[1:08:48] it when the lord amen restores the earth
[1:08:53] the bible that says one day you know the
[1:08:55] lord will come and he'll she'll
[1:08:57] bring these kingdoms amen and crush them
[1:09:01] the stone that was shown out of the
[1:09:03] mountain that says amen which is
[1:09:05] christ amen will come and he'll crush
[1:09:07] these nations
[1:09:08] to powder there's nothing left going to
[1:09:12] be left for ashes of these nations
[1:09:15] and then the bible says i'll give glory
[1:09:17] to god people
[1:09:18] for the kingdoms of this world have
[1:09:20] become the kingdom of our god
[1:09:22] and our savior and our lord
[1:09:25] how many believe god's going to restore
[1:09:27] this world
[1:09:28] the earth just as he has redeemed how
[1:09:30] many believe that redemption
[1:09:33] except for the physical body i believe
[1:09:36] that we are redeemed
[1:09:38] back to god according to the prophet of
[1:09:40] god amazing with me
[1:09:42] sure brother baby said it man has been
[1:09:44] redeemed we have the same rights as adam
[1:09:46] did now
[1:09:47] except we still have this carnal flesh
[1:09:50] that has to be dealt with amen
[1:09:54] god has done a redemptive work he has
[1:09:56] restored us
[1:09:58] if you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:59] this morning
[1:10:02] amen and god's going to do it to this
[1:10:04] world god's going to take it to this
[1:10:06] take this earth through the process of
[1:10:08] cleaning it up
[1:10:09] changing it purifying it just like he
[1:10:13] does you and i
[1:10:14] how many thankful for the work that god
[1:10:16] does in your life
[1:10:18] amen he has a way of catching our
[1:10:19] attention don't he
[1:10:21] sure he does praise be to god
[1:10:25] going home i'm just looking forward to
[1:10:28] going home
[1:10:30] being restored back to our home where we
[1:10:32] once was
[1:10:35] amen we sing that song going home i'm
[1:10:38] going home
[1:10:39] amen never more to rome if you're a
[1:10:43] sinner this morning
[1:10:44] what does that mean amen that means that
[1:10:47] the holy spirit is calling
[1:10:49] amen and you have been away from father
[1:10:52] for so long
[1:10:53] and that spirit begins to call come home
[1:10:55] son
[1:10:56] come home where are you son where are
[1:10:58] you
[1:11:01] amen and something in the inside begins
[1:11:03] to say i want to go home
[1:11:05] i want to be home again i'm not in my
[1:11:07] right place
[1:11:08] i'm not supposed to drink and party and
[1:11:10] live in the world that's not my place
[1:11:13] there's something else for me there's a
[1:11:16] better place
[1:11:17] and you begin to call and god calls you
[1:11:19] home to himself
[1:11:21] comes you back brings you back to the
[1:11:23] holy spirit
[1:11:25] getting us ready to take us home to our
[1:11:28] eternal home
[1:11:30] i believe as we come down towards the
[1:11:33] end of the world
[1:11:34] as we come down to where this is
[1:11:36] certainly needing
[1:11:38] a complete restoration and we feel it
[1:11:41] calling us
[1:11:42] we feel it calling us i hope you feel
[1:11:46] that call
[1:11:47] because i sure do i feel that call that
[1:11:49] god is coming close now he's gonna
[1:11:51] cook it's close to bring us back to
[1:11:53] himself to be united with him
[1:11:55] through all of eternity
[1:12:00] brother banham in life story he says
[1:12:02] this how many
[1:12:04] people here is away from home
[1:12:07] let's see he says this is not your
[1:12:09] native home he says let's see your hand
[1:12:11] you're from another city perhaps
[1:12:13] somewhere else oh my half of us
[1:12:16] more than half of us is away from home
[1:12:20] no matter what city we're from or where
[1:12:22] we come from
[1:12:23] it's just a little different as the
[1:12:25] minister said the other day the little
[1:12:27] church in the desert
[1:12:28] that he was pastoring no matter what it
[1:12:30] is or how humble
[1:12:32] it is like the old proverb says the old
[1:12:35] song says there's no place
[1:12:38] like home
[1:12:41] hey amen no place like home
[1:12:46] but martha they do a bit of world
[1:12:48] traveling
[1:12:49] they could probably tell us you know
[1:12:50] it's wonderful to see the world but
[1:12:52] no place like home right ah we're home
[1:12:56] again
[1:12:57] ah my bed my bedroom
[1:13:02] my kitchen huh isn't that what we do
[1:13:05] when we go on vacation sometimes and
[1:13:07] oh it's wonderful and it's great but
[1:13:09] still there's
[1:13:10] no place like home
[1:13:15] amen and folks i'm here to tell you if
[1:13:17] you're a
[1:13:19] person that strays away from god you may
[1:13:21] go straight straight away
[1:13:22] but when you get back to god you can say
[1:13:24] ah no place like home
[1:13:28] no place like being right with the lord
[1:13:30] no place like
[1:13:31] having his spirit dwelling in me there's
[1:13:33] just no place
[1:13:35] amen so brother brown's making a point
[1:13:37] no place like home
[1:13:40] he says if you'll notice always before
[1:13:42] people die
[1:13:43] you'll notice they're always having a
[1:13:45] longing to go back
[1:13:46] to the old home place amen i thought
[1:13:49] when he said that i said well brother
[1:13:51] byler
[1:13:51] you just visited your old home place up
[1:13:54] there
[1:13:55] but i don't hope that i'm fixing live
[1:13:57] just yet but
[1:14:00] some time though sometimes it was like
[1:14:02] 20 years before i seen the old home
[1:14:03] place where i was raised
[1:14:07] you know and i we drove up in there i
[1:14:11] remember me and my wife
[1:14:12] we took my vehicle and went up in there
[1:14:15] and it was my first cousin then her
[1:14:16] husband
[1:14:19] that were there and they weren't that
[1:14:22] much older than me but they were already
[1:14:24] retired and in a mommy daughter house
[1:14:27] if you know what that is it's a grandma
[1:14:28] grandpa house you know they're on a
[1:14:30] little side house there beside ours and
[1:14:32] i guess their children were in the main
[1:14:35] house where i live now i'm like wow time
[1:14:37] does go on don't it
[1:14:39] my first cousin's already retired and so
[1:14:41] forth you know
[1:14:42] one you begin to look around and you see
[1:14:45] what
[1:14:45] used to be precious memory
[1:14:49] and that right how many has precious
[1:14:50] memories and every one of us has those
[1:14:53] don't we
[1:14:54] the place that we were raised our
[1:14:56] neighbors that we
[1:14:57] visited i went and visited several of my
[1:14:59] neighbors while i was up there
[1:15:01] and how surprising it was to see him
[1:15:03] again how surprised they were to see me
[1:15:05] after many years
[1:15:08] but he says before they die they'll go
[1:15:09] and see the whole place again
[1:15:11] my father before he left he hadn't been
[1:15:13] down to his old home place for many
[1:15:15] years
[1:15:16] many many years some 25 years i guess
[1:15:20] i seen him sitting on the beam of the
[1:15:22] plow one day
[1:15:23] he was crying
[1:15:26] and i was just a little laugh and i
[1:15:27] didn't know very much about it and i
[1:15:29] said what's the matter dad
[1:15:31] he come over and he said you don't
[1:15:34] understand billy
[1:15:35] but someday you will he says i want to
[1:15:38] go home
[1:15:40] i want to see the old home place again
[1:15:42] you know
[1:15:43] it wasn't but a little bit after he
[1:15:45] visited the old home
[1:15:47] he went away he went up there he'd come
[1:15:51] back and he was crying
[1:15:52] and i was okay this is brother frank
[1:15:55] okay this is
[1:15:56] father brother brother brahms
[1:15:57] father-in-law he's speaking of now
[1:16:00] he went up there he come back from his
[1:16:01] old home place and he was crying and i
[1:16:03] was
[1:16:05] going with his daughter and i said
[1:16:06] what's the matter brother frank
[1:16:08] he said billy i set up on the old place
[1:16:11] up there
[1:16:12] today and he says where the old house
[1:16:14] used to stand said the old
[1:16:16] spring along over there on the side of
[1:16:18] the hill
[1:16:20] said you could just hear my old mother
[1:16:22] say oh frankie
[1:16:24] well just a few days i buried him maybe
[1:16:27] it was a call
[1:16:28] coming from another land
[1:16:31] he could hear the echoes from across the
[1:16:34] earth
[1:16:36] i went to a man some time ago killed in
[1:16:38] an accident he was just dying
[1:16:40] come out of the accident like manner and
[1:16:43] i've seen many of them going that way
[1:16:45] not just wonder he says that if when
[1:16:48] we're coming
[1:16:50] even death is hard jesus fought against
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:53] if it be possible let this cup pass but
[1:16:56] when we're coming down
[1:16:57] right down to the end of the road and
[1:16:59] i've watched my wife as she went out
[1:17:02] and i wonder when we get to the end of
[1:17:04] the road if god doesn't just say to
[1:17:06] mother
[1:17:07] or for some of them on the other side
[1:17:09] look daughter's coming home this morning
[1:17:11] go down there by the bank
[1:17:12] of the river and watch for them get to
[1:17:16] see them when their
[1:17:17] these eyes become trans becoming
[1:17:20] transformed from the natural
[1:17:22] to the supernatural
[1:17:25] amen in that vision when it's catching
[1:17:29] on us it's a fog that just dries away
[1:17:31] there and we can look to the other side
[1:17:33] and see
[1:17:33] them coming down the river amen
[1:17:37] i'll tell you this i truly believe that
[1:17:39] when brother ivan was going
[1:17:41] i remember when he was going to further
[1:17:43] and i caught his attention one time when
[1:17:45] he was just about gone and
[1:17:47] i said jesus loves you and he jerked his
[1:17:49] head back like
[1:17:51] like he was coming out of the other
[1:17:53] world and
[1:17:55] realizing that you're still partially
[1:17:57] here or something
[1:17:58] i'd believe that i believe that when
[1:18:00] they get down to that door
[1:18:02] they can actually begin to see you on
[1:18:03] the other side
[1:18:05] they begin to see home homes called
[1:18:10] amen he says brother brown he said he's
[1:18:13] seen many of people come to down that
[1:18:15] place
[1:18:16] and begin to speak i don't think i have
[1:18:18] the next page
[1:18:20] but he took i don't think he was here
[1:18:26] but he says listen catching us it's a
[1:18:28] fog that's there we can look on the
[1:18:30] other side see them coming down to the
[1:18:32] river i hope that's so
[1:18:33] i don't know i can't say for sure at all
[1:18:35] but i've seen
[1:18:36] many times when our loved ones pass on
[1:18:39] it goes that way
[1:18:40] i was listening to brother branham and
[1:18:42] he was talking about
[1:18:44] uh how that he just couldn't bear it
[1:18:48] anymore when his wife passed and
[1:18:50] media i mean hope passed and sharon rose
[1:18:53] and

[1:18:56] a hold of that
[1:18:57] hot wire with all of that amps on it and
[1:19:00] so forth and he was reaching for it and
[1:19:02] he says he found himself down on the
[1:19:04] ground crying
[1:19:07] and so forth and he says that was just
[1:19:09] god protecting his gift
[1:19:11] how he got down there i don't know but
[1:19:13] got an angel mowed down
[1:19:15] grabbed him and laid him down there
[1:19:18] what for you and me so we could receive
[1:19:21] the message of the hour
[1:19:22] so we could be restored back to the
[1:19:25] faith of the fathers amen
[1:19:27] and then he said he went home and he
[1:19:30] just still couldn't bear
[1:19:31] in the old cold room you know and uh
[1:19:39] and tried to shoot we wouldn't shoot he
[1:19:41] wouldn't shoot

[1:19:47] it went off you know and he says he fell
[1:19:49] asleep
