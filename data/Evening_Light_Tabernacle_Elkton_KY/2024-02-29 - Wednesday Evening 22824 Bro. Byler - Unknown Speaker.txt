hunger and thirst after you Lord Jesus we ask God that you'd fill it tonight Lord you promised that you would in Jesus name amen and [Music] amen excuse me gotta itchy nose and I'm about to sneeze so y'all just forgive me amen we're going to try to keep from doing that amen praise the Lord amen do you remember Donna she had a real real round of it amen I think it was probably Co so amen amen but I'm just thankful by God's grace amen I haven't gotten it so praise the Lord and uh but still I really felt for her amen because she certainly had had a pretty good pretty rough way to go and she's still coughing a lot and stuff but definitely on the men doing good amen so praise the Lord I know the different ones of us have had that stuff going around but amen amen we're just going to keep pressing on ain't we we don't let it intimidate us we just keep going and amen it's going to be around a while probably so you know you know you going to have to learn to live with it amen get through it you get it say God I believe in you You're My Healer amen and go go on praise the Lord so tonight amen I don't know just how it'll go but amen from what the Lord's laid on my heart might get a little sticky might be something you don't like so just keep I'm getting you all prepped amen amen and so uh we'll just see what the Lord will have but this is just been kind of a kind of different I really appreciate the Lord and his goodness to us amen so amen if you will turn your Bibles and we'll go to the book of Hebrews I believe we'll start with I don't think that it's going to be a long message but amen cuz I don't have a whole lot wrote down or even quotes and so forth but amen you know the Holy Spirit takes over you never know what might happen in Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 amen I'm going to read this scripture because I want to go through another scripture and take a little more time Amen in reading it and and and commenting on it so we'll just read the Short scripture so to speak amen for our thought Hebrews 11 and verse 5 by faith Enoch was translated that he and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen may God add His blessings to the reading word you can be seated amen I want to start first of all by saying and I and I was listening to brother brandham and his amen message called looking to De unene and he makes a comment of people [Music] who live like talking about aren't too effective Amen in the kingdom of God amen amen it's the people that live by faith amen people who are constantly looking to the Unseen ain't that right that a whole lot more effective amen and and more productive in the kingdom of God and and I know I preached on that about a week or two ago talking about looking to the Unseen and how that amen whether it's salvation or even God or the Holy Spirit and everything about us amen we uh I think it was Paul that said you know the things that are seen are temporal isn't that right but the things that are not seen are Eternal so it's quite something for a Believer how it it all it's all in the Unseen realm amen all of your weaponry and all of your everything it's in it's in it's by faith amen we see that how the Hebrews 11 talked about by faith God did this and by faith Noah by faith and Moses by faith all these people you know all the great people that ever amounted anything were people that had faith in God Amen and look to the Unseen you and I are looking to the Unseen isn't that right amen and I got to thinking about uh hope that is seen I think and I wish that I maybe re refresh myself on this but Paul said something about hope that is seen is no longer hope for why do you hope for something that you see is that right you know so we're believing and it also talks about the Bible that he says which which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul amen the hope that's before us that's set before us that's what our anchor is as we look to the F still believe leaving for it a that right something that we're looking forward healing or salvation or Deliverance or whatever it might be or the Rapture or or especially amen heaven and for the things that's coming amen that's what we focus on Amen so I want to turn back now and and go with the help of the Lord here in Matthew I going to go to Matthew and begin to read a scripture that kind of wanted to lay a foundation here uh on uh what I want to speak on tonight amen and and I think maybe we'll title is Enoch's walk amen Enoch's walk would that be okay walking like Enoch walked amen CU how many knows Enoch had a translation Enoch had a translation how many knows that we're looking for a translation outside of that translation there there is no other hope the only hope you and I have is that translation how manyan believe it's important that we make that translation CU how many would would uh bear record with me we're believing that we could go by the Grave by before morning but if we live our lives out we're going to see amen that Rapture I'm believing that that you and I are going to see the Rapture amen how many think while brother I B I think it might be wrong well you might think that but even brother Brandon believed that he would even he believed that he would not die of old age until he seen the coming of the Lord they'd be over 100 so amen if he don't come for another 50 years and I'm long gone I'm still believing that we're going to see his coming amen amen and we're fixing to read how he talks about the Fig Tree when he puts forth his Bud amen and so forth he says that generation would not pass away until all the things will be fulfilled which is what I want to read um and I wanted to share first of all if I if I may I want to share with you perhaps just kind of how I come about this message amen and and and it it was while I was driving down the road how many's ever just going down driving down the road and you you think about the Lord amen and the Lord just kind of gives you things you know and I was coming off of Green Ridge Spar Road and I begin to think about the Lord and I got to thinking about what the prophet of God said about how that uh you know that everything that Adam lost we have been restored back to amen the fellowship that Adam had with God Amen we've been restored to that fellowship with God and I and I was down D down Road at Lord if that's the truth why don't I why don't I fellowship with you more right why don't we why don't we why can't you drive down the road why don't we talk to him more on a daily basis wherever you are I mean we've been restored back to talk been able to talk we're on talking terms with God how many believe that then I was driving I okay because you know I we pray in the morning right we talk to the Lord and we pray maybe at night and we think about him something but a lot of time we don't think a whole lot about him we very rarely probably a lot of times just start talking to him how many least we ought to we ought to talk to him more and I thought what in the world if this is true and we actually have an open Channel why don't I hear God talk more brother John why don't I hear his voice more than what do I'm telling you how I come to this message all right just come about and I just got to think of my Lord wow and I was reading even brother bam he was says man look at all the all in one place in quot he says why are we are why are we like we are if this all is is true why is the CH church still not where it ought to be amen but let me not go down that road talking about you know the Lord and and I begin to talk to the Lord he begin to talk back and before I knew it amen he was talking to me and he was telling me all kinds of things of the scripture and and some of the things I'll bring tonight and and bringing these things out and and and and uh in the middle of it all better B I say well I'm thank you Lord I I know that's you talking to me I know that you talking to me because you're telling me scriptures amen you're telling me this that or the other and and you're showing me amen one of the first things one of the first thoughts come uh to my mind was you know it's because that you've got too much static in your life yeah exactly and how many knows it'll be that still Small Voice that talks to [Applause] you wish I could remember the message I heard this week but brother B talked about we think man we don't have a church service unless we're screaming and hollering all of these other he said you know we've had that but where's God at Where's God at Where's God at Where's God at we've had tongues this out other Where's God at he says what we need is that still Small Voice he emphasized greatly that we need to hear we need to get back in the cave and hear that still Small Voice so when I begin to listen you know I Here I Am Lord talk and before I knew it I just you know I thought you know well now we pray and ask God for Stuff most of the time but here he was telling me this stuff and I'm says I Lord I know that's you thank you thank you for fellowshipping with me how glad that you can get the fellowship with Jesus Christ on a daily basis if you'll just make sure that this add it's one of the thing first things that have thought about was you know it's like a channel on the radio and did you ever hear static in between channels on the radio right all kinds of weird sounds but when you get that tuned in it's clear I am the Lord that speaks to you huh I am the holy spirit all of a sudden it become clear not a bunch of RI Raff and a bunch of [Music] chatter tonight we want to look at some of that chatter in our lives would that be okay some of those things that are really insignificant the most important thing is that you have fellowship with God Amen that we have Fellowship that we speak with him on a daily basis everywhere so listen closely amen I believe this can change your life amen amen first of all I want to talk about the coming of of the Lord amen the coming of the Lord didn't butam said he said that uh we need to check up every hour every minute of every day there's no hope outside of the translation so I want to bring this because this is our Focus Point our focus is on the coming of the Lord to be ready and to walk like Enoch walked to be Rapture Ready how many want to be ready for the rapture in in you know in the thought I thought you know there's going to be a lot of people oh boy here we go there'll be people hello I knew the Rapture was coming but I just didn't there be a lot of people that I know that it's already passed I missed it I wasn't ready be a lot of people like that amen you know I thought there was supposed to be a Rapture take place and something will tell them it's already happened and you didn't know it you wasn't now learn of Parables chapter 24 of Matthew verse 32 now learned of parable of the fake tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see these things know that it is near even at the doors amen how many knows who the Fig Tree is Israel right when it puts forth his brother what about God teaches when they become a nation when they become a nation listen to what it says here verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled we as message Believers know that brother bam talked about the generation that sees the is came a nation there's a lot of interpretation to this because you know uh if you just took a baby that was born well they would never know that and it became a nation that's right child would have to be of understanding to know that it was even a nation so it could be the people that knew but if you just took it from a b the baby that was born in 1947 today I believe would be 77 years old amen so look at how late it is the bible promises you he listen these things be fulfilled all these things be fulfilled Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away not that we doubt God's word anyway but he was saying Heaven and Earth will pass away but you can count on this so we know that we don't have long left on the face of the Earth 20 years these folks would be uh what 707 87 97 years old amen most of them would have gone so we can pretty much if we was to predict we would predict that within 20 years or 20 five years at the most it's going to be done amen I say that because for anybody don't have their perspectives right you need to get your perspectives right you need to get your focus right you need to get your faith right realizing we're going to be in the Millennium we're going to be in heaven we're going to be up there when the tribulation period happens what what lays ahead for us is inconceivably awesome amen and people oh my how the devil can distract us amen amen and tying it in remember we're talking about the coming of the Lord we're talking about walking the walk that's going to get you through amen you care most people don't care but the bride's going to Care people that are going are going to care one of the things I want to say tonight is we're not here to talk about your good points and how good we are how elected we are this that or the other but AB Braham says man if you don't come together Amen to find your bad places then you ain't coming together for the right reason is that what he said to find your bad spots for we we not what we ought to be amen whoa am man you're going to be a little Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never but of the day or the hour knoweth no man know not the angels of heaven but my father only how many knows in the seven seal but BR talked about what he didn't know about that seven seal and what it pointed to was nobody knows his day nor the hour of his coming somebody knows that when he does come to the whole world to most people it's going to be a surprise but I want to declare to you that it will not be a surprise to those who are waiting and watching they will not be a surprise if it's be a surprise to you amen then you're going to be in trouble can I say something you know he's gonna come as a thief in the night right I would dare say that the surprise is going to be I know that it's over with already and I was left huh that's going to be the surprise because people are not going to know when happens un Believers are not going to know when it happens amen except for except for those for the husband or the wife that is in bed and their mate is gone they're going to know there was nobody in kidnapped my wife there ain't nobody in here kidnapp my wife my husband huh but he's not in the bed this morning he's gone and somebody's heart's going to get grip fear is going to come in like you ain't never thought amen I think that's going to be more more distinctive in being able to identify the Rapture than two in the field well maybe he went to us the restroom and he just left he's just gone huh two working in the field while he may may come up missing somehow but unless you just vanishes right there you watch him vanish is that right Bible talks about people's hearts are going to melt over in Isaiah read that talking about people's hearts are going to melt when they realize they're left in the tribulation period amen day and the hour knoweth no man but as the days of Noah were amen so shall also of the coming of the son of man be amen Before the Flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage until that Noah entered into the ark they knew not until the flood came and took them all away amen what was it nine 10 11 days at the ark the door was shut or something like that few days it was already shut no rain no nothing but all of a sudden it begin to thunder amen when that flood came came they all knew when that tribulation period comes they all knew amen let me tell you something don't build your hopes on this world don't build your hopes on financial status this nation is busted as can be 30 some trillion dollars it's done it's over with you'll have wheelbarrows full of money won't mean nothing so you better get your priorities right if you're believer get your priorities right amen then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other one left two women shall be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken the other one left amen amen watch therefore for you know not the hour that your lord does come but know this that if the good man of the house would have known what watch you would have come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up he would not have how many's with me Lord don't let me be disappointed I don't care what you got to do Lord I don't don't let me be disappointed don't let me deceive myself huh amen show me where I'm not where to be notice this therefore be ye also ready Jesus said for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh we can definitely say he could come just any time just any moment now he could come why because he said know this that when Israel when that happens he saids no that it's not even at the doors how many the Lord is knocking on the door hey I'm here it's right here here yeah it's right here it's going to happen any time now no time to be slack no time to be slack amen who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give him meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen barely I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all of his Goods but if that evil servant shall become slack and so forth ain't that right he's going to be in for a disappointment it says if you are slack lukewarm halfhazard Halfway Christian you in for disappointment you better be hot folks you better be on fire you better be in tune with God Amen you better be listening to that still Small Voice on a daily bases amen every day walking with him like Enoch walk think about this Enoch could walk with God in such a way that God would translate him under the blood of bulls and goats how many glad that you have the blood of Jesus Christ that you can walk amen and that you can please God testimony that he pleased God Amen Lord help us to have that testimony that we please our pastor no God make sure you are pleasing to God and I'm here to tell you if you aren't listening to that still Small Voice every day you can't be pleasing to God you're going to miss it I wish I hope I can say this the evening like Tabernacle anybody here you can very easily miss that still there's because if you listen to that still Small Voice voice it will take you away from all evil it will show you all your faults it'll show you all the little things that cause you not to be able to hear that still Small Voice amen because there's a lot of things a lot of static a lot of things going on Amen that'll cause you to do it Amen to be able not to be able to walk like we should walk amen how manyan we want to be we we we we we talk here Church of Acts book amen book of Acts Church my goodness I can't even talk how many wants to be a book of Acts church amen we have a we have a long in our heart to be like there are why why because he said he sent Malachi 4 to take our hearts back to the hearts and Faith of the father we don't want to go back just to ass soon as the street we want to go further than that we want to go all the way back the way the they were much was said in the church age book of how any church man looks back amen wants to be like like the original church amen but let me give you some pointers this is Alo some pointers on being that powerful power of a car that has all of those thousand horsepower under the hood huh how many wants to be a more powerful Christian we're going to show you how the way that they were give me the power that Jesus had through the blood that was shed burn burn Holy Spirit burn in me set my soul on fire fill me with the Holy Ghost and God's full desire make me the dead give me the power that Jesus had through the blood that was shed let's read acts acts two this is part of Pentecost well I just haven't heard a preacher preach on it in quite a while anyway I don't remember but I'm GNA preach on it tonight it's going to sting us a little bit is that all right amen remember two acts two they were already re painting in the name of Jesus isn't that right promises to you to your children to them that that are far off verse 39 2 and 39 with any many many other words he testified exhorted saying save yourselves from to this unto a generation then they that gladly received the word were baptized in the same day were added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly in the do the do the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and the breaking of bread and in prayers and fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and sign were done by the apostles and all that beli were together and had all things common and sold their possession and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continually daily continuing daily with one Accord in the temple the breaking of bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved brother banam in in in trying to uh uh prove that Israel was a a not a denomination but that he they would go from here to there and so forth and go from one place to the other and mean he was typ kind of typing it with the Nations they were wers and Tents and alleys down in the street corners the little Mission maybe they get behind on the rent they get kicked out he says God's wanting them to go somewhere else over in Jamaica not long ago there was a fine Pentecostal doctor Divinity standing there Divinity standing there and I says oh how the Lord blessed your early Pentecostal Church they had nothing and I said they were just War wonderers about he says Ah brother Brandon I said yes brother oh my f f brother he said I was just wanting to show you where you're I just want to show you where you're wrong and I said oh I'm so glad of that I always want to know where I'm wrong isn't that the right attitude when somebody tells I can show you where you're wrong most of us want to get offended tell me I'm wrong blow up like a buckshot toad frog eating Buckshot no please please tell me where I'm wrong I mean CU if you're not wrong you ain't got nothing to worry about if you're wrong then you need to anyway we should always always be willing to take correction I like his attitude I always want to know where I'm wrong cuz God knows I don't want to be wrong I said well if I'm wrong I sure want to know it brother thank you he said you keep praising those Pentecostal people I said yep he says they made the terriblest mistake that they ever made when they sold their property when the persecution arose they didn't even have a home to go to under the bow now one of the things that the Lord spoke to me in that car was he says you know remember what I said about uh brother prophet of God said the word of God said that you know we're always wanting to prosper and and over Sean says I would that you prosper and that you be in health that's right when I think of all the jobs that I've got that the house lined up I got enough to last me years people ask me if do you have job yeah I got more job I care to do with huh that's right this I got more stuff than I got the store huh I got Craftsman tools and today I was standing there and I had to pick all the different tools and try to put them all back in place take a half a day to put arrange stuff you know and Lord was show me look what they did you know we're always trying to get more that's right we're always busy trying to buy more buy this buy that buy byy byy but the early Pentecostal they didn't see how much they could buy they see how much they could sell I thought that's right that's right Lord maybe if I think about selling stuff instead of buying too much thinking about my next project I'm going do maybe I listen a little more maybe I'd be more spiritual well oh my you know well let me just read on that' be okay now notice the ter he said the terriblest mistake they ever made with selling their property one the persecution wrote they didn't never go home to go to they didn't have whole place to go and they just wandered about and I said that's exactly the will of God and he said why I said if dat had a home to go to dat went back huh probably settled down and said well I don't know about this I think I'll just get me a home job and forget church and everything else when because Bible says you know persecution some of them fall by the wayside huh but they had to go from here to there Spreading the News everywhere that the Holy Ghost had come how many know in that early Pentecostal church amen salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen for of your sins getting baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that was F first and foremost in their life more than anything else any worldly possessions God was first in that church it didn't matter if they had to sell everything they were willing to sell everything they had no hold on this Earth our Earthly possessions we've got the Earthly possessions so we don't want what to do with but where are you spiritually what kind of person are you spiritually let me tell you something when your Earthly possessions take you out of church and keep you from God you better go to selling some stuff you better get in rid of some time you better make some time for God boy I had some crazy thoughts coming into my head amen when the Rapture comes when Jesus comes back people say no Jesus I'm having a pretty good time here can you come back later I'm doing really good here I'm too busy for you to come if you're too busy for to come to church you'll probably be too busy for the [Applause] Rapture that ain't nothing but the truth amen cuz God's not coming for a backlit person he's coming for somebody that's right there tuned in and ready to go can you come back later cuz I'm just too busy cuz a lot of time we're just too busy for God we ain't got time to listen to that Still's moist telling us I'm convinced that the church is to be led by the Holy Ghost but the people have to be able to hear the voice of the Holy Ghost they ever clean their lives up ever get rid of the sin static that's all up in their lives starting with the busyness that we are how busy we are that's the devil's trap it's to get it so busy we ain't got time to pray we ain't got time to listen oh brother Russell when I thought about that and I still begin to talk to God God begin to talk back to me I said God is more willing he's more wanting to talk to you than you ever even give him time for he wants to talk to you he wants Fellowship why did he die calary for so that you could have fellowship with him so you could talk to him but you got to remember when you go to talk to him he loves you and he's going to rebuke you as many as I love I rebuke Jason be zealous be zealous out there be zealous folks I know we have like brother Bram says we have our condoles I believe is people that can't come to church our elderly and so forth that can't come to church sick that can't come to church this that or the other I understand all that but when you're perfectly healthy and wealthy and wise and you don't come to church you're back slid you're seriously backslid brother B says man if you can't wait if the Holy Ghost ain't so much in you preach it brother Luke Gibson amen Faith goes to church if you got the love of God in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open come in amongst there fellowship with your brothers and if you don't brother B it's time you go to praying better get to repenting better go to repenting if you don't love church hate to miss church that's right my my praise the Lord you ready for a real shocker you want Pentecost here we go they didn't have a go to him to go back to but they had to go from here to there Spreading the News everywhere that the Holy Ghost had come don't tell me that God makes a mistake he never makes a mistake he knows what just how to do they sold their properties and become vagabonds [Applause] woo what them Pentecostals become vabs remember one time brother bandam tell him his life story he was talking about a home he says Brams don't have homes Brams are vagabonds poor huh it's his quote how many believe it's a part that we need to hear sometime sold their property became Wanderers bombs so to speak even Jesus didn't have a place to lay his head the master our Lord and Master didn't have a place to lay his head he had no earthly possessions here we are filthy rich and we have a hard time being a Christian we don't really even have persecution like we ought to have we cry and whine because this breaks down or that breaks break down what in know world is wrong with you be glad you got something that breaks down they didn't have nothing they wonder where they were going to sleep next time they wonder what they meal they were going to eat and it was perfectly the will of God well brother B are you saying that we ought to go sell everything that we have this outa no I'm not but I am saying this it'll come to that place if they maybe even close this place up it could come back to where we'll have all things in common huh that's right you can't be there hid away with your big old freezer full of food and everybody else is hungry and you're going to save it your yourself now you better open that thing up and tell feed everybody in the church that needs to be hungry it may come to that we may come to that yet amen we don't do stuff just on our own we keep going like we are until God changes things but you better be willing is what I'm sing I say tonight you better be willing to put God first above your finances and everything that you have God is first if he ain't you ain't where you ought to be don't you never think that because you a Prosperity but B says Prosperity isn't always a sign of God's blessing if that's a that's a case Arnold Schwarz ner amen Nancy Pelos you president uh not president but uh Trump and everybody all of those billionaires would put you to shame that's right they're more blessed than you can ever imagine those folks have more money day will know what to spend it on you know what he said to don't go by that blessing is when God forgives you of your sin fills you with the Holy Ghost and gives you peace you may be under a tree somewhere you may be under a bridge somewhere you may be wherever but you got peace of mind you may be like Paul a prisoner with change on your legs and be a prisoner but you got joy unspeakable full of God you're the richest man alive you got God and you're a Son of God that means more than anything to a real Christian back to real Pentecost where the holy ghost means more than anything listening to God's voice and following his voice means everything oh my think about it anytime you do something you to do you're not listening to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will tell you just right quick what to do and what not to do you ain't got to come to church to hear it you can hear his voice like I hear his voice driving down the road or wherever it is if you'll just open it up say Lord what do you want to say to me it's funny but I said Lord you can talk I know you can I don't talk to enough to you so Here I Am Lord I'm talking to you I begin to open up my mind and Bam there he was talking to Mew telling me all kinds of he was my I could just shut up let him talk it's amazing what he'll tell you he's more willing to fellowship with us than we are willing to fellowship with him are you with me I know that's the second or third time I've said it but I think it need said don't you brother Glenn he wants to fellowship with you when he tells you something there ain't nobody ever talk you out of it or change your mind about it I'm going to tell you this the most precious thing that you'll ever have in your life is what Revelation when God reveals himself or when he speaks to you amen makes himself known to you it's good it's precious I said vagabonds my goodness I don't want to be a yeah I do that's what it takes if they were vagabonds I'll be a vagabond amen right now brother Glenn I'm just a very blessed Bon amen this is world is not our home we're just passing through Spreading the News everywhere and said the news was spread all over the whole world when they be become Wanderers who gave up everything to have the Holy Ghost amen the people did not belong to a denomination and again talks about I was in kensing to Jamaica and I heard some of the businessmen that day giving testimony before their businessmen out there and they said boy my little business is just so and so and bless God I got three Cadillacs I got this and I got the other that night I said Bren how much different Pentecost is now now when it used to be when it first fell amen I said the people sold what they had and become popers in order to take the gospel and I said nowadays they try to tell these businessmen they got business and they know what to do that ain't what they're after let them know about the love of God that's what they're trying to find not long having a business this that or the other but just remember that's not the purpose you might have three Cadillacs go watch and go talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and what some of them other Hollywood stars they've got a huge garage with all million dollar cars about 15 of them puny little Cadillac Three Cadillacs you got you tell them about they better repent and get right with God Amen or they're so will perish amen we got more something much more valuable than Earthly Treasures are you with me tonight what we got is more valuable than Earthly Treasures maybe we'd be a little better off if we didn't have so much can I say it as your pastor it's a little tough but maybe we need to get on a maybe we need to sell some stuff get rid of some stuff come on people amen if it causes you to get closer to God then do it if the devil's taking all of your time then redeem the time Bring It Back J I'm bring it back my Wednesday night I'm bringing back my Sunday I'm bringing back my time to meditate on the Lord I can have so much on my mind and I'm my heart I got so much business man I can't think about anything and it's tearing me up get rid of that junk it's nothing but noise it's static in between the channel of you being able to hear the Holy Spirit I hope you enjoy this this is just what God gave me hey and I'm preaching to myself brother Glenn I got too much stuff too many cares I think I got another quote for you amen what is sweeter than fellowship with him my heart's desires Lord help me to hear your voice more talk to me more Lord and it's not him it's not his fault that you're not hearing he wants to talk to you how many beli that he wants to talk to every one of us he wants to have a greater fellowship with each and every one of us but you got to get rid of the STA you got to get rid of the things that are keeping you from hearing his voice could be setting sin could be the cares of life could be the deceitfulness of [Music] riches let's remember Jesus said it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of an needle than for a rich man to CER it in heaven right why because a rich man most of the time loves his riches that's right Peter say then how can anybody be saved even Jesus said with man it's impossible but With God all things are possible aren't you glad amen amen so listen when the man fell when Adam fell he lost this fellowship with God that whatever he would ask it would happen everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is of all things isn't that right how many know when Adam before he fell he could say Amen tree be plucked up and go over to here he could say Mountain I don't like where you are I want you out there in the ocean everything would Obe him but after the F he lost all of that he lost his power he had condemnation in his heart but the Bible says the sack and Adam restored us back and give us everything that Adam lost Jesus said if you to this mountain be plugged up and cast into the sea it will obey you where are the sons and daughters of God we're being drowned and barous and cares of the world we ain't got that power we don't have the power because our cares are on the wrong thing I hope that's okay to say I just feel led of the spirit to say it that's where your power lays and your dead dedication to [Music] God let me just say something else all of our little faults and our failur our little sins and the things that we do that we shouldn't do are a stumbling block to each other Our Faults Are stumbling blocks to each other and we got to overcome our stumbling blocks amen Mom and Daddy you're lukewarm you're a stumbling block to your children they have to overcome you Lord help me starts from right here Lord take my faults away take my failures away I don't want nobody to have to overcome me overcome my stumblings and so forth we all have failures we're all nonperfect but we're here tonight to say God take this away from me take that away from me burn burn Holy Spirit burn in me [Applause] yes amen I'm getting to this other quote I was trying to tell you about amen all right Christ come as a redeemer did you ever think and stop what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall now the thing of it is since he has restored man back to this place man in the fall was lost in his conscience of what the father put him here on the earth for to do amen he had lost that in other words all of the plumbing so to speak as it was of our brain and the outl outlets the faith has been clogged how many know that's what happens our faith gets clogged our conscience becomes clogged our brain he says our brain our Outlets listen they're clogged up with business affair with home life and domestic things it's all become clogged up with that until God can't operate through those channels that he made man forward Lord help me don't let domestic things don't let business life don't let nothing these domestic things don't let that clog up the channel the fellowship that you have with almighty God Amen even Jesus talked about the cares of life just the cares of Life all the insurance and all the upkeep and all those things can clog your relationship with God don't let it happen said Lord don't let it happen happen don't let me get clogged up let me have fellowship with you amen praise the Lord how many believes we need to have a walk with God let me walk with you Jesus don't ever leave me alone for without you I could never no I could never make Heaven my home let's walk with him let's talk with him amen praise the Lord listen brother bam says that's where the church is faing is on that walk talks about your behavior can knock knock somebody else out of here but most of all your behavior will knock you out your behavior will knock you away from The Fellowship of allight Mighty God Amen he says listen that's why this is so important to preach to church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other how many believes that even between us as a body of Christ you don't even want to have a little ill feeling don't even better says don't let that little what did he call it that little feeling to to each other don't even let that be there because it'll affect that person let that body of Christ operate right how glad to be able to come to church and the preacher have freedom you can have freedom to hear the word of God to preach you can have freedom to preach the word of God when everybody's lined up and you've been listening to the Holy Ghost you've been fellowshipping with God everybody here and everybody out there if you'll listen to that still Small Voice you'll become different than what you are you'll be different than tomorrow than what you was today but you make sure when you're driving down that road you say Lord we've been restored to fellowship with you again my question was Lord where's the fellowship and I realized it wasn't on God's part it's on my part and it wasn't no time God began to talk to me amen well how do you know it was God was it just your mind no I know it was God because he first of all rebuke me chastise me and give me some quotes and scriptures and says you know this is where the static is son you got too many cares takes me two days takes me two hours to go out there and do my dog chores brother John and I'm like I'm too old for this huh all of us want to prosper we're always looking Amen to have a a better machine to cut trees down we're always looking for a better dog to sell is that right huh but how about letting him rule a little bit think about God instead of all the cares of Life make sure that your soul is prospering ask yourself this question in closing is your soul but it sounds like a politician sounds like Ronald Reagan are you better off today than you was four years ago huh is your soul prospering is what I ask you this evening is your soul prospering when come back Sundays are you going to have growed more in the Lord is it prospering that's right are you adding to to your soul of that the strength and power of almighty God or is it being squeezed out let me tell you something there's a people that's going in the Rapture and it's going to be people like Enoch ain't that right that walked with God and they had to this testimony that they pleased God that's my heart's desire Lord help me to be pleasing to you musicians if you'll come amen let's stand tonight I hope that I preached the balance on this amen I do I feel like I did if you got things that's keeping you afraid from you better get go go up to the hardware and get you a for sale sign and you go to selling some stuff right you're so busy buying more and getting more until you don't even have time to be a Christian huh that's the case you need to get rid of those worldly things that's what the early church did they looked at how much they could get rid of instead of how much they could get brother says how different the early church than what we are Lord help us how many knows God is first in my life I thank God for his blessings nothing wrong with having these things but just as long as God is first and it's not taken away from him amen bow our heads Lord Jesus when you told me these things Lord my hands go up say Lord I'm guilty I'm guilty oh Lord Jesus being too consumed with the cares of this [Applause] world too busy with the cares of this world driving down the road here and there and I have to think about everything else most of the time God forgive us forgive us get our minds on you and help us to fellowship with you Lord daily and hourly and wherever we are to have fellowship with you and allow you to speak to our hearts you will go to your Bible you'll go to your word you'll go to what you said to us through your Prophet that you Vindicated you'll bring those things to our mind you'll show us our faults and our failures and if we're a son and daughter of God we'll repent right there where we are and that's what we're doing now Lord repent Lord help us God of what we have not made you first in everything Lord and we have gotten too consumed with the world and the cares of this world forgive us God we want that fellowship with with you now Lord here in those streaming Lord Jesus may we go from this moment on Lord and say God I really want that Fellowship that you paid for on Calvary to bring us back to the same Fellowship Adam had with you walking with you in a garden Lord Jesus here we are walking with you and you say whatever we would ask in your name you do it Lord we know that your Prophet was an example Lord Jesus of the power of God resting on a man and me he could speak to a storm and say stop and move aside he could speak to a bull and he would go back and lay down he would obey in the same way with the Hornets Lord Jesus God we believe Lord the power rests in the church but Lord if it don't even as your Prophet said when we bring the sick up and they don't get healed we need to have a solemn assembly we need to find out what's wrong where are we not where we ought to be God cleanse us Lord Jesus and make us right so
