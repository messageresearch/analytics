[29:08] the brothers in the back room, I said,
[29:10] "I just pray the song service blesses
[29:13] you as much as it did me tonight at
[29:14] home." I said, "Lord, just come tonight
[29:18] like you are here." I said, "Lord, we
[29:21] just want to be in your presence tonight
[29:23] and worship you tonight."
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just so good to be in the
[29:27] house of the Lord. I'm just excited
[29:30] tonight for what God's going to do for

[29:36] something for you, you might as well
[29:37] stayed home
[29:39] &gt;&gt; because we come expecting God to move.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; And you know, we played volleyball
[29:45] Monday night. I didn't. They did. And I
[29:48] got to thinking, I was watching Sister
[29:50] Donna play. And here's a lady. The
[29:53] doctor's done said she's she's going to
[29:56] die. I wish they could see her now
[30:00] &gt;&gt; out there playing volleyball with the
[30:01] kids. the young people, I shouldn't say
[30:03] kids. Brother Brandham said they're out
[30:05] kids because kids are goats and we're
[30:07] not goats. We're children of the king
[30:08] tonight.

[30:13] they think to see what our God has done?

[30:22] And this song come on my heart. God is
[30:25] good. And it says, I like this verse. It
[30:27] first verse. says, "If you're walking
[30:29] through the valley, there are shadows
[30:32] all around,
[30:37] do not be discouraged.
[30:39] Do not fear because he will guide you.
[30:41] He will keep you safe and sound. He has
[30:47] promised
[30:49] he would never leave you
[30:53] nor forsake you." And guess what? His
[30:56] word is always true. Hallelujah. Oh, I
[31:00] love you tonight. Let's sing it with all
[31:03] the heart if we can. Well, if you're
[31:06] walking
[31:09] through the valley, oh yes, and there
[31:12] are shadows

[31:26] keep you safe and sound. Oh, yes. He has
[31:33] promised you he'd never leave you
[31:39] nor forsake you.
[31:43] And his word is true. Well, God is good
[31:49] all the time.
[31:52] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[31:58] of mine. God is good
[32:03] all the time
[32:06] and through the darkest
[32:08] night his light will shine. God is good.
[32:14] Oh yes,

[32:20] all the time.
[32:22] Well, we were sinners,
[32:26] so unworthy.
[32:28] Yes, Lord. But for us, he chose to die.
[32:35] Oh yes, he filled us with
[32:39] his Holy Spirit.
[32:43] Now we can stand and testify.

[32:53] is never ending
[32:57] and his mercy
[33:00] well they will never
[33:03] end. Oh, God is good.

[33:10] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[33:16] of mine. God is good

[33:23] And through the darkest
[33:26] night, his light will shine on the
[33:31] screen. Oh yes. Oh, he's so good
[33:38] all time.
[33:41] And though I may not understand
[33:48] all the plans you have for me, oh yes,

[34:56] of mine. God is good
[35:02] all the time.
[35:05] Through the darkest night, his light
[35:10] will shine in darkness.

[35:22] Amen. You love him. You may be seated
[35:24] tonight. Sorry to keep you standing so
[35:26] long. And amen. We just love the Lord
[35:29] tonight, don't you? And want to welcome
[35:31] those that are streaming tonight. And
[35:33] just pray that God will just bless your
[35:34] heart tonight. And we were talking about
[35:37] the different ones that stream. I know
[35:39] Sister Peggy and Sister Parish and uh
[35:41] Sister Becky told me that her sister Kay
[35:44] uh she streams a lot. So, God bless you,
[35:47] Sister Kay. And we just just pray that
[35:50] God will bless each and everyone. And I
[35:52] know Brother Glenn and them are on
[35:54] vacation. So, I'm sure they're streaming
[35:55] if it possible. So, we just want to say
[35:57] God bless you. We miss them tonight, but
[36:00] we're just thankful for you that are
[36:01] here tonight and thankful for the
[36:03] presence of the Lord and Amen. Let's
[36:05] sing that little song if we could. He
[36:06] paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[36:09] debt I could not pay. Amen. Well, he
[36:13] paid a debt. He did not owe. Oh, I owed
[36:19] a debt. I could not pay. I needed
[36:26] someone
[36:28] to wash my sins away.
[36:35] And now I sing a brand new song. Oh,
[36:40] amazing
[36:42] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a
[36:48] debt that I could never pay. He paid a
[36:53] debt at Calvary.
[36:55] Well, he paid a debt at Calary.
[37:01] He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm
[37:07] glad that Jesus
[37:10] did all my sins erased.
[37:16] Oh, I now can sing a brand new song. Oh,
[37:22] amazing
[37:23] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a
[37:30] debt that I could never pay.
[37:36] And one day he's coming back for me to
[37:42] live with him
[37:45] eternally.
[37:47] Won't it be glory
[37:50] just to see
[37:53] on the day? Yes,
[37:57] I will sing a brand new song.
[38:02] Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus
[38:09] paid a debt that I could never pay.
[38:16] Amen.
[38:17] Amen. Aren't you thankful he paid that
[38:20] debt this tonight? Amen. And you know, I
[38:23] was praying this morning and in the last
[38:25] couple of mornings, it's just been on my
[38:27] heart and I begin to think and is around
[38:30] 6:00 and I begin to think where brother
[38:32] Brandham said that when he come back,
[38:34] he'd come back between 6:00 and 9.
[38:37] And I said, "Lord, one of these days
[38:39] when you come back,
[38:42] what a day that'll be.
[38:44] There'll be no sorrow there, Brother
[38:46] Joe. I won't be sick. I won't have
[38:48] diabetes. I won't be old. I won't hurt,
[38:52] but I'll be meeting him in the air.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; And what a day that'll be when my Jesus
[38:59] I shall see. And when I look upon his
[39:02] face,
[39:03] Amen. And what a day
[39:07] that will be.
[39:09] Oh, when my Jesus
[39:12] I shall see. And when I look upon his
[39:18] face, the one who saved me by his grace.
[39:25] And when he takes me by the hand and
[39:30] leads me through the promised land. Oh,
[39:35] what a day.
[39:38] A glorious day
[39:40] that will be. There'll be no sorrow
[39:43] there. Oh, and there'll be no
[39:48] sorrow there and no more burdens
[39:54] to bear.
[39:56] No more sickness,
[39:59] no pain, and no more ping
[40:03] over there.
[40:06] And forever
[40:08] I will be.
[40:11] Oh, with the one who died for me. Oh,
[40:16] what a day. A glorious day
[40:21] that will be.
[40:24] Yes. Amen. Oh, and what a day
[40:29] that will be. Oh, when my Jesus
[40:34] I shall see. And when I look upon his
[40:40] face,
[40:44] me by his grace. And when he takes me by
[40:50] the hand,
[40:54] the promised land. Oh, what a day.
[40:59] Glorious day
[41:02] that will be.
[41:05] Amen. and brother Michael John and
[41:07] brother Caleb. Brother John,
[41:10] uh, would you come help him?
[41:13] Hersburgger, I had one of them minutes.
[41:16] You excuse me? I'm sorry. We've got too
[41:18] many. We've got more than one, Brother
[41:20] John. So, Amen. Now, we have some prayer
[41:24] requests tonight. We want to take to the
[41:25] Lord in prayer and uh, we want to
[41:27] continue to remember Sister Parish and
[41:29] Sister Peggy. Continue to remember our
[41:31] shutins. And like I said, Brother Glenn
[41:32] and them are gone. going to pray,
[41:34] continue to remember them in prayer as
[41:36] they're gone. And continue to remember
[41:38] Sister Janette and Sister Donna. And
[41:40] also, Sister Becky asked me that we
[41:42] would pray for Sister Larb or the Matt's
[41:45] Matthew's wife that God would touch her.
[41:47] Didn't you say she was in the hospital?
[41:50] She's she's been in the hospital. She's
[41:51] having different thing, something going
[41:54] on, and they can't really figure it out.
[41:56] But she needs a touch from the Lord
[41:58] tonight. So, let's just remember her in
[42:00] prayer with all that's in within you
[42:02] tonight. If you have need on your heart,
[42:04] you might let it be known but uplifted
[42:05] hand. And we're going to ask brother
[42:07] Tommy if he'd stand and pray over these
[42:08] needs and and the offering tonight.
[42:10] Brother Tommy
[42:59] Amen. Let's sing that little chorus.
[43:01] There's never been a day like this day.
[43:03] If we could. Oh, there's never
[43:07] been a day
[43:09] like this day
[43:12] to me.
[43:15] There's never
[43:17] been a day
[43:19] like this day I see. Oh, there's never
[43:27] been a light
[43:29] that shines
[43:32] so bright
[43:34] as this day.
[43:37] His glory
[43:39] us. Let's stand as we ask brother Brad
[43:42] to come tonight. Oh, there's never
[43:46] been a day
[43:48] like this day
[43:51] to me.
[43:53] There's never
[43:56] been a day
[43:58] like this day I see. Oh, there's never
[44:05] been a light
[44:08] that shines
[44:10] so bright
[44:13] as this day.
[44:15] His glory
[44:18] as the I think I can remember this
[44:20] verse.
[44:22] For Christ is
[44:25] revealing
[44:27] himself unto
[44:30] me. He has opened
[44:34] my eyes
[44:37] and now I can see.
[44:41] Oh, his word is
[44:44] becoming
[44:46] a reality.
[44:51] Oh, in this thing,
[44:54] this glory.
[44:56] I'll get you some. God bless you.
[45:02] [Music]
[45:05] like this day
[45:07] to me.
[45:10] There's never
[45:12] been a day
[45:14] like this day. I see.
[45:20] There's never
[45:22] been a light
[45:24] that shines
[45:26] so bright
[45:29] as this day,
[45:32] this glorious
[45:35] day.
[45:38] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[45:40] Lord.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hungry tonight?
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be a Christian?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be victorious?
[45:49] Why don't you just say, "Hey, devil."
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; we win.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; We win.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord a hand, a clap of
[45:59] praise this night.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Certainly good to be in the house of the
[46:07] Lord. If you want to be turning in the
[46:09] in the scriptures, if you want to turn,
[46:11] we'll read from Mark tonight. And we're
[46:13] going to continue on our thought down
[46:15] through the ages. And tonight's topic I
[46:17] want to look at and I'm going to try to
[46:18] I'm going to try to just kind of maybe
[46:21] slow down behave just a little bit. And
[46:23] uh we'll just go as as far as we feel to
[46:27] go and but I want to my my subtitle
[46:30] would be submission to the commission.
[46:34] Submission to the commission. How many
[46:36] knows we are all commissioned to do
[46:38] something for God. We have a commission
[46:40] in our life. And now whether or not you
[46:43] carry out that commission depends on
[46:45] whether or not you submit to that
[46:47] commission.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Are you going to be submissive to God?
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That's the question. So as we look at
[46:54] these church age messengers and we look
[46:55] and you got Paulinius, Martin Cola,
[46:58] Luther, Wesley, brother Brandham, they
[47:00] had to submit to a commission that was
[47:02] given to them. John the Baptist had to
[47:05] commit to submit himself to a commission
[47:09] that was placed in his life. Moses,
[47:11] brother Brown said, Moses had a
[47:13] commission.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; So, we have to establish and as we're
[47:17] looking at these church ages, a
[47:18] commission who it is, what it's for,
[47:21] what it does for the people. So, uh
[47:23] we're looking at that tonight in and
[47:25] Mark 16. As you're as you're there, I'm
[47:27] going to read you this uh this quote
[47:29] here and it really stood out to me as we
[47:31] get started. says that that fuzzy face,
[47:35] gray-haired, whiskered, baldheaded,
[47:37] skinny arms 80 year old Elijah sitting
[47:41] up there in the wilderness looking out
[47:43] upon the sins of the people.
[47:46] You know, Elijah had a commission as
[47:48] well.
[47:50] God spoke to him one morning. Here's his
[47:53] commission.
[47:54] God spoke to him one morning and said,
[47:56] "Go down there and tell Ahab that not
[47:58] even the dew will fall from heaven till
[48:01] you call for it." He said, 'I can see
[48:04] that little those little old eyes
[48:05] looking out through that fuzzy looking
[48:07] white beard, that stick in his hand,
[48:09] walking down the road like a 16-year-old
[48:12] boy.
[48:14] He knew who he was. He knew what his
[48:16] commission was. He know he knew what he
[48:19] was called to do.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; So, he's just got a little bit of a pep
[48:23] in his step. I'm going to go down there
[48:24] and tell them just what God said for me
[48:26] to tell them because God said I'm going
[48:28] to tell him that's my commission. He
[48:31] walks down there like a little
[48:32] 16-year-old boy and he walks right up
[48:34] into the presence of the king and says
[48:37] not even dew will come from heaven till
[48:39] I call for it. He wasn't ashamed of God
[48:43] or his word tell the king or anybody
[48:46] else. He said he wasn't ashamed. He
[48:49] didn't have to hide it. Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; We don't have to hide who we are.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The prophet himself had
[48:57] conviction in his heart over this. He
[48:59] said, "It puts me in mind of something
[49:01] like ourselves." I told I said to the
[49:03] people, "I'm getting to a spot. I need
[49:06] more faith."
[49:07] Can you imagine the prophet of the hour
[49:09] saying, "I'm at a spot. I need more
[49:12] faith.
[49:15] I need more faith." and that's why I'm
[49:17] home is to get a new burst of faith. He
[49:20] said it's gotten so that we look and we
[49:23] pray for people that you apologize.
[49:29] Mr. Devil, he says, would you please
[49:31] move over and let me
[49:34] Mr. Devil, would you would you please
[49:36] step aside so we can be happy? Mr.
[49:40] Devil, would you please let us have our
[49:41] joy? Mr. Devil, would you please? He
[49:43] said, ' That's the place that we've
[49:45] gotten to was right there. He said, 'But
[49:47] you don't got to do that.' He said, 'You
[49:49] don't have to do that.' He said, '
[49:50] There's nothing to that. Faith has got
[49:52] muscles. He says, it's got hair on its
[49:55] chest. When it speaks, everything else
[49:59] shuts up.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's what faith, that's what a
[50:03] commission in our lives does. It places
[50:05] a an authority and a power that's given
[50:09] to us by the word of God. Not me, not
[50:12] you, not our abilities. It's the word of
[50:15] God.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; The word of God builds your faith. The
[50:19] word of God is the foundation of the
[50:21] church ages.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to prove that one of these
[50:25] days when we get there. Get out of here.
[50:28] He said, "I'm a son of God,
[50:31] &gt;&gt; commissioned of God. Leave them alone."
[50:35] And that moves it. He said, "You have to
[50:38] have no apology to the devil. nothing to
[50:40] do with him. Not ashamed of the word.
[50:43] Not ashamed of your commission. Not
[50:45] ashamed of who you are.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; So many times I feel like we we we we we
[50:53] kind of hide away
[50:55] our true identity.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Are we ashamed?
[51:02] Are we scared? Are do we wonder?
[51:06] He says, "But as his servant," how many
[51:11] &gt;&gt; as his servant, I'm not ashamed.
[51:14] Brothers and sisters, we don't have to
[51:16] be ashamed to be the bride of Jesus
[51:19] Christ.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be ashamed of your
[51:23] holiness.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Ladies, you don't have to be ashamed.
[51:28] Young men, you don't have to be ashamed.
[51:30] You don't have to be ashamed to pray in
[51:32] public. You don't have to be ashamed for
[51:35] to let the world know that you've been
[51:37] set free by the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:39] and that he's still a redeemer today and
[51:42] that the same blood that set you free
[51:44] can set them free.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of his word whether it's
[51:53] denominations.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to stand up against them.
[52:00] kings potentates.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; When we talk about a commission when he
[52:05] was called, we're going to get into this
[52:07] at a later date, but I'm share a little
[52:09] bit right now. Brother Brown said when
[52:10] the when the commission when the angel
[52:12] come to him, he said you'll stand before
[52:13] kings, you'll stand before proteinates
[52:17] and you'll go around the world with this
[52:20] message.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; That's a commission.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; But he says whatever it might be, just
[52:26] get ready to give an answer. God calls
[52:28] for it. So I asked you earlier, how many
[52:31] of you's got a commission?
[52:33] &gt;&gt; God's going to call for it.
[52:37] Mark 16.
[52:39] I said I was going to behave. Mark 16.
[52:43] And they when they had heard that he was
[52:45] alive, now we know this. This story here
[52:48] starts. This is where Mary Magdalene and
[52:49] Mary the mother of G of Jesus and James
[52:52] uh and I believe it's Solomon
[52:56] goes there and they go to the tomb to
[52:57] anoint Jesus who had died. So they're
[52:59] now they're at the tomb. They they've
[53:01] seen that the stones been rolled away.
[53:03] They see that the God is that Jesus is
[53:06] no longer there and they come back and
[53:07] they tell everybody what they saw. And
[53:10] so now he says, "When they heard that he
[53:12] was alive and had been seen of her,
[53:15] believed not. After that he appeared in
[53:18] another form unto two of them as they
[53:20] walked and went into the country." And
[53:22] they went and told it to the residue,
[53:24] neither believe they them. Afterward he
[53:27] appeared unto the 11, as they sat at
[53:30] meat, and upgraded them with their
[53:32] unbelief and hardness of heart. So now
[53:34] he's scolding a little bit. because they
[53:37] believed not them which had seen him
[53:39] after he was risen.
[53:41] Isn't it something how he gave him the
[53:43] word over and over and over and told
[53:46] them and told them and told them who he
[53:48] was and what was going to happen the the
[53:49] the order of things I'm going to that
[53:52] you're going to take this temple down
[53:53] three days it's going to come back but
[53:55] yet they believed it not even though he
[53:57] had risen and watch what he says and he
[54:01] said unto them go into all the world and
[54:05] preach the gospel to every creature the
[54:09] good news and he that believeth and is
[54:12] what? Baptized shall be saved. But he
[54:16] that what? Believeth not shall be
[54:19] damned.
[54:21] And these signs shall follow them that
[54:23] believe.
[54:26] What's that next say?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; In my name.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's something about the name of
[54:33] Jesus.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[54:37] In my name, they shall speak with new
[54:40] tongues. In my name, thou shalt take up
[54:42] serpents. In my name, they shall drink
[54:45] any deadly thing, and it shall not hurt
[54:47] them. In my name,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; they shall lay hands on the sick, and
[54:52] they shall recover.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Think about this. So then, after the
[54:59] Lord had spoken to them, he was received
[55:00] up into heaven and set on the right hand
[55:02] of God, and they went forth and preached
[55:05] everywhere. and the Lord working with
[55:08] them and confirming the word with
[55:11] &gt;&gt; signs following. So be it. May the Lord
[55:16] add his blessings to the reading of the
[55:18] word. You can have your seats. I got
[55:20] something here that I want to pull up
[55:22] and I want to read this to you and I
[55:26] want to talk about this name for just a
[55:28] minute because it struck me and I said,
[55:29] I know brother Brandham said something
[55:30] about it and I know I've heard it many
[55:32] of times but I couldn't find it. So, I
[55:34] finally found it before he came out. And
[55:36] he's talking about in my name. Listen to
[55:39] what he says. He's praying. Dear God, as
[55:42] we come to thee now reverently, quietly,
[55:45] soberly, and in faith, believing that
[55:48] you hear and will answer prayer
[55:51] because,
[55:53] there's the key word, because we come to
[55:57] you in that allsufficient name of thy
[56:00] son, the Lord Jesus.
[56:03] who is the infallible one who gave the
[56:06] promise that if you ask the father
[56:09] anything in my name I'll do it then we
[56:12] know that we will receive just what we
[56:14] ask for we come in his name
[56:19] &gt;&gt; for there is no other name that we could
[56:22] approach you in
[56:26] &gt;&gt; oh I thought about this and I I've
[56:28] changed my whole way of thinking when I
[56:30] read when I heard this the other day a
[56:32] few weeks back. I changed my whole way
[56:34] of of the way I pray and approach the
[56:36] Lord.
[56:38] Oh, we got quiet.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; So, what changed? What changed was I
[56:44] begin to say, "Heavenly Father, I come
[56:47] to you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:49] Christ."
[56:51] &gt;&gt; The word has taught us that. Why was I
[56:54] not doing it? I preached about it. I've
[56:57] talked about it. I've preached about it.
[56:59] I've told it when Jesus said, "Pray like
[57:02] this. Pray like this. Our Father, which
[57:06] art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[57:11] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
[57:14] earth as it is in heaven." So now my
[57:17] approach is different. He said, "And and
[57:19] we come in his grace,
[57:24] &gt;&gt; not me.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I'm fallible.
[57:29] more than once, many times, sometimes in
[57:31] a day.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, angels.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; But we come in his grace, not confessing
[57:38] that we deserve anything.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I never You never approached God and
[57:45] say, "God, you owe me this.
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He paid a debt that I can't pay. I I owe
[57:53] him everything. He owes me nothing.
[58:01] But he made a propitiation for us that
[58:03] he died for us. That he atoned for us
[58:06] and we feel that we can stand justified
[58:09] in your sight by his death. That is our
[58:13] faith. And asking for nothing that would
[58:16] be evil, but that which would be good
[58:19] for us.
[58:25] John 14:14.
[58:28] You got that one, Carson.
[58:30] John 14:11. I'm sorry, Carson.
[58:34] Believe me that I am in the Father, and
[58:36] the Father in me, or else believe me for
[58:39] the very work's sake. Now, this is a key
[58:42] key scripture here. Verily, verily, I
[58:45] say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[58:47] the works that I do shall he do also.
[58:51] And what greater works than these shall
[58:54] he do because I go unto my father.
[59:00] Catch this one. And whatsoever ye shall
[59:03] ask in my
[59:05] &gt;&gt; name that will I do that the father may
[59:08] be glorified in the son. If ye shall ask
[59:12] anything in my name I will do it.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; How many got your church age books?
[59:21] No, no, no. I mean, there's some They're
[59:23] in the back. That's what I'm telling
[59:24] you. Did you get one when you come in?
[59:25] If you need one, they're here. I'm
[59:27] trying to tell you that. It just the I
[59:29] just broke right there. I'm not I'm not
[59:31] putting you on the spot. If you need a
[59:34] church age, let me rework. If you need a
[59:35] church age book, Brother Tommy's got
[59:37] them in the library, okay? So, we will
[59:40] be referring to parts of it.
[59:42] If you ask anything in my name, I will
[59:45] do it. So, I want you to know tonight, I
[59:48] want you to look at just how simple that
[59:50] verse is
[59:52] when it's put into action. I want you to
[59:54] think about tonight as a how simple that
[59:57] thought is. And it's such a simple
[59:59] thought that people around the world
[1:00:02] take and they run away with that very
[1:00:05] sentence
[1:00:07] and they apply to apply that very
[1:00:09] sentence to everything they need in
[1:00:11] their lives.
[1:00:16] Lord, I need a new job.
[1:00:19] Lord, I need more money. Lord, I need a
[1:00:22] a a new car. Lord, I need a new house.
[1:00:25] Lord, I need this. Lord, I need that.
[1:00:27] Lord, my I'm hurting. Lord, I
[1:00:31] The world applies that one sentence. If
[1:00:35] you shall ask anything in my name, I
[1:00:36] will do it. And they think it's a magic
[1:00:39] wand.
[1:00:41] They believe it's a magic wand that if I
[1:00:43] say this in Jesus name, he's going to
[1:00:44] give it to me. I need a million dollars.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It's not happening.
[1:00:53] And whether or not they attend church,
[1:00:56] they use this scripture.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Whether or not they they they they going
[1:01:01] to the bars,
[1:01:03] they use that scripture. whether or not
[1:01:05] they're living it up in a life of doping
[1:01:07] it up, drinking it up, adultery,
[1:01:10] fornication,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; they use that scripture.
[1:01:17] What are they doing? They begin to
[1:01:19] dissect the word and they begin to pull
[1:01:22] out. Why is it that people want to pull
[1:01:23] out, oh, this I'll apply this to my life
[1:01:26] because this this makes my life good,
[1:01:30] but I'm going to put this over here and
[1:01:31] I don't really believe that because man,
[1:01:33] I don't want to have to submit to that.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And they take and they dissect that word
[1:01:40] and they use that word. And many of
[1:01:43] times it's people that's just playing
[1:01:45] church.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; They're not submitted. They're not
[1:01:50] committed.
[1:01:53] Don't get quiet on me.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And they want every time something's
[1:01:59] wrong. Will everybody pray for me?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; I liked when brother Brown said, "Now
[1:02:06] you done the sinning, Billy Paul. You do
[1:02:08] the praying."
[1:02:18] But they want to apply that word over
[1:02:21] and over and they want to but then they
[1:02:23] wonder why nothing happens.
[1:02:26] And the reason and then they begin they
[1:02:28] get discouraged. Have you ever heard
[1:02:30] them people? Well, I I I I called on the
[1:02:32] Lord but he never done nothing. I I've
[1:02:34] called and I've asked for this and he's
[1:02:36] never moved. He's never come on the
[1:02:38] scene. He's never this. He's never that.
[1:02:40] Now, I'm not speaking to any of y'all
[1:02:41] cuz I know God moves on the scene,
[1:02:43] right?
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; But the reason that they're there
[1:02:47] because they fail to read and follow the
[1:02:49] verses before.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father and
[1:02:56] the Father in me. Or else believe me for
[1:02:58] the work's sake.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he
[1:03:03] that be what? believeth on me,
[1:03:07] the works that I do shall he do also,
[1:03:10] and greater works than these shall he
[1:03:11] do, because I go unto my father.
[1:03:16] So, think about this. Here it is. He
[1:03:17] that believeth on me, this scripture
[1:03:20] right here is a commission.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; It's a call to the believers.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; this is not a commission to the sinner.
[1:03:34] This is not a commission to the doubter.
[1:03:36] This is not a commission to the
[1:03:37] unbeliever. This is not a fixall for the
[1:03:40] world to use whenever it's convenient.
[1:03:44] But this is a message and a commission
[1:03:46] to the believer. It says if you'll just
[1:03:48] believe on me, believe on the very
[1:03:50] work's sake. In other words, if you have
[1:03:53] seen,
[1:03:55] if you have heard,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; if you believe
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; the word of God
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; with all your heart, you can apply this
[1:04:05] to your life.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; This is a simple little scripture, but
[1:04:09] it's so simple that we a lot of times we
[1:04:12] make it too big and we go around it and
[1:04:14] we think, "Oh, I can't do this. I'm not
[1:04:16] good enough. I'm not this." It just says
[1:04:17] all you got to do is believe. How many
[1:04:20] believes he was a healer?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; How many believes he was a deliverer?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; How many believes he was a savior? How
[1:04:27] many believes he can bring your prodical
[1:04:29] children back?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? It's a word in
[1:04:32] action. That's faith.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how simple this is.
[1:04:38] Brother Brandham tells a story about a a
[1:04:41] young lady, the daughter of be Reigger.
[1:04:45] You heard the story. You know who I'm
[1:04:46] talking. I'm about to share it with you.
[1:04:49] So, Brother Brandham's talking about he
[1:04:50] was out preaching meetings in Fort Wayne
[1:04:52] Gospel Tabernacle. I think it was Fort
[1:04:54] Wayne, Indiana, somewhere up in that
[1:04:56] area, I think. And he said there was a
[1:04:58] great man of God, Be Regger. Now, I
[1:05:01] looked up who be Reigger was. So, be
[1:05:04] Reigger was a man. He was a he was a
[1:05:06] preacher that he would go into into
[1:05:08] rural communities and churches that had
[1:05:11] started kind of dwindling away, falling
[1:05:13] away. They they kind of lost their
[1:05:15] support in the fellowship in the
[1:05:17] churches. and he would go in and he
[1:05:18] would bring in the word of God and he
[1:05:21] would go into the community and he begin
[1:05:23] to rally the people back to come to the
[1:05:25] house of God again. So his ministry was
[1:05:27] to go out and spread the word and pull
[1:05:30] people to come back into the house to
[1:05:32] restore their faith, get them back to
[1:05:34] serving God. And brother Brandham talks
[1:05:36] about this be reticer and he said he was
[1:05:38] a great man of God. He said he was a
[1:05:40] mighty man of faith and the Lord really
[1:05:43] blessed this brother and he said I was
[1:05:46] just a little boy and he said I was
[1:05:48] sitting there in the services used to be
[1:05:49] with Paul Rder as a young minister.
[1:05:53] Now think about this.
[1:05:55] A young minister William Brham
[1:05:59] preaching meetings sitting in meetings
[1:06:02] and is astonished by this B be Rigger
[1:06:06] and he says and then I heard brother
[1:06:08] Reigger's daughter had lost her mind.
[1:06:12] She went insane. He said she went insane
[1:06:15] and and and one day she went back into
[1:06:18] the coal shed there at the church one
[1:06:19] Easter morning and they told me he said
[1:06:22] there's some insane girl back there in
[1:06:24] the coal shed at the church. Now listen
[1:06:27] he said I just come off of a campaign
[1:06:30] and I went back there and I found out it
[1:06:32] was Be Radiger's daughter and Sister
[1:06:35] Reigger sitting there and my heart like
[1:06:38] to failed me. another place he said, "I
[1:06:40] thought I thought so much of of Sister
[1:06:42] Ricer because she was such a lady of
[1:06:44] God. She was such a such a a a woman of
[1:06:48] faith." And he said, "It just about my
[1:06:51] heart just like to failed me." And he
[1:06:53] said, "She was standing there and she
[1:06:55] was combing her beautiful long hair with
[1:06:57] her fingers and this girl was hollering,
[1:07:00] "A nickel is a nickel. A penny is a
[1:07:03] penny. A nickel is a nickel. A penny is
[1:07:06] a penny. A nickel is a nickel. A penny
[1:07:09] is a penny. And he said, "She sat there,
[1:07:11] this beautiful woman sitting there and
[1:07:14] and he said, I was thinking about
[1:07:16] Brother Reter, and she was sitting there
[1:07:17] with her head down in her mother's lap
[1:07:19] and frothing at the mouth. A nickel's a
[1:07:22] nickel. A penny is a penny."
[1:07:25] H
[1:07:27] watch this.
[1:07:29] He said, "The anointing had done left
[1:07:31] me."
[1:07:33] Oh,
[1:07:35] we're talking about a young William
[1:07:36] Brandham who was out praying for the
[1:07:38] sick, who was anointed to pray for the
[1:07:41] sick, but now the anointing has left
[1:07:43] him.
[1:07:48] You mean the man who who sat there and
[1:07:50] saw the the milky white clouds and the
[1:07:52] healing campaigns and he saw all the the
[1:07:55] the the the blind eyes open and the deaf
[1:07:58] ears open and I just heard today where
[1:08:00] he was sitting there and he said this
[1:08:02] old woman he called her mother. He said,
[1:08:04] "You remind me so much of my mother.
[1:08:06] Take my hands." He says, "You're blind.
[1:08:09] You're going blind." And he and she
[1:08:12] began to she began to answer, "Yes, I'm
[1:08:14] I can't see nothing." He said, "Well,
[1:08:16] we're going to pray." So, he prayed just
[1:08:18] a simple little prayer and said, "Now,
[1:08:19] touch my nose."
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; How many fingers am I holding up? One.
[1:08:27] And the crowd erupted. I didn't have to
[1:08:29] be there to know what happened.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; How many fingers am I holding up now?
[1:08:35] Two. She said,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; "That's right."
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "If the blinded eyes of this
[1:08:40] woman can be opened, the blinded eyes of
[1:08:42] everybody in the building can be
[1:08:44] opened."
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; But now the anointing had left him in
[1:08:48] this story.
[1:08:52] And she just sat there with her head
[1:08:54] down frothing at the mouth.
[1:08:57] And I knelt down there and I said, "Lord
[1:09:00] Jesus,
[1:09:02] be merciful to her.
[1:09:06] That was it.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said?
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't come in some big power
[1:09:14] authority and try to call in this and
[1:09:16] and take this under commission and and
[1:09:18] take this under under subjection or this
[1:09:20] spirit or that spirit or re rebuke and
[1:09:22] reject this. He said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:09:25] be merciful to her."
[1:09:28] And that was it.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; He said that was it. Now she's married,
[1:09:35] got two or three kids, she's just fine.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; See, it's grace and simplicity. He said,
[1:09:42] "We try to reach way over the top of
[1:09:44] him." And he said, "And way over the top
[1:09:47] of him, but honestly, it's just simple
[1:09:50] believe.
[1:09:53] Have faith
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and don't doubt.
[1:09:59] Lord Jesus,
[1:10:01] be merciful to her."
[1:10:07] looking at a couple of words tonight. I
[1:10:09] want to look at these words submission
[1:10:10] and commission. Submission. We look at
[1:10:13] submission and we we see that it means
[1:10:15] to willingly yield up the authority or
[1:10:19] leadership of another.
[1:10:23] How many would say I want to yield up my
[1:10:26] self to the authority of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:28] Christ.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; So willingly giving yourself. So
[1:10:33] willingly I give myself up. You raised
[1:10:35] your hand. So willingly you have to say,
[1:10:38] "I'm going to give up my thinking.
[1:10:40] Willingly I'm going to give up my bad
[1:10:42] attitude. Willingly I'm going to give up
[1:10:44] my desires." You see how this works?
[1:10:47] Willingly, I'm going to give up my
[1:10:49] pride.
[1:10:52] willingly. If God is going to move in my
[1:10:54] life and I'm going to see the commission
[1:10:56] that God called me out for to carry out,
[1:10:59] I'm going to have to lay everything of
[1:11:00] myself aside and allow God to use me to
[1:11:05] allow God to move in my home, to move in
[1:11:08] my life, to move in my children, to move
[1:11:10] in my job.
[1:11:13] I'm giving it all up. But the problem is
[1:11:16] so many times we don't want to give up
[1:11:19] self.
[1:11:21] We want to hold on to what we like. We
[1:11:24] want to hold on to what pleases us. We
[1:11:26] want to hold on to the things we think
[1:11:28] are good.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; But in order for God to carry out a
[1:11:32] commission through you, you have to
[1:11:35] submit
[1:11:36] and say, "I willfully
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; give myself up to your authority."
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody's got a boss.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Mine just sits on a throne.
[1:11:53] I want you to watch this.
[1:11:56] If we submit oursel to the word of God,
[1:12:00] if we submit oursel to the authority of
[1:12:02] God and his word, what does that do?
[1:12:06] It goes back to that commission to go
[1:12:08] into all the world and preach the
[1:12:09] gospel. Because what it does when you
[1:12:12] give yourself up, it allows others to s
[1:12:14] to see God's supreme authority and God's
[1:12:17] will working in your life. How is it you
[1:12:20] can look at some people and say, "That's
[1:12:22] a real man of God. That's a real woman
[1:12:24] of God. That's a that's a real servant
[1:12:26] of God." What is it? It's them allowing
[1:12:29] getting theirel out of the way and
[1:12:30] allowing God to move in their life.
[1:12:32] Whether it's a ministry, whether it's in
[1:12:34] their home, whether it's at the song in
[1:12:36] the song service, whether it's at the
[1:12:38] piano, whether it's at the Walmart,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; they allow God to move in their life.
[1:12:49] And it tells the world
[1:12:52] that this life you see is not my life.
[1:12:57] You see, when I get my life in the way,
[1:13:00] notice I said in the way.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; When I get my life in the way, it
[1:13:05] disrupts God's program and plan
[1:13:09] because God might want me to go over
[1:13:11] here and I try to go over here.
[1:13:15] You heard of a man named Jonah. We won't
[1:13:18] get into his story, but you know what
[1:13:20] I'm talking about. We We get into a
[1:13:22] place that we don't allow God to move in
[1:13:24] our life.
[1:13:26] But the Christian life is not about me
[1:13:29] me
[1:13:31] or I I I.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; You know as well as I do whenever you
[1:13:38] hear somebody and all they can say is
[1:13:40] God used me. God manifested through me.
[1:13:44] I God I prayed and God worked through me
[1:13:46] and I went here and I did this and I Oh,
[1:13:51] you better watch him.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; You better watch that fella. You better
[1:13:55] watch that woman that I I I I because
[1:13:58] it's not about I. It's about God. It's
[1:14:02] about God. It's about living for others.
[1:14:04] Letting your light shine through others.
[1:14:11] You know Jesus, he prayed in the garden
[1:14:13] of Gethsemane.
[1:14:15] Brother Ber, is that clock right?
[1:14:20] Mercy me.
[1:14:24] Well, mine ain't right. I'll tell you
[1:14:26] why. I got it on upside down.
[1:14:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:41] Jesus in the in the garden of
[1:14:42] Gethsemane.
[1:14:45] Now, think about this. Jesus in the
[1:14:46] garden of Gethsemane. And he begins to
[1:14:48] express his human desire.
[1:14:51] human desire to avoid suffering.
[1:14:56] Do you realize that he sat there? He
[1:14:58] knew what was going to come. He knew
[1:15:00] what was about to happen. And he prayed
[1:15:02] there one of the most powerful
[1:15:04] expressions of faith and submission to
[1:15:06] God's plan that has ever been prayed.
[1:15:12] He knew it was going to hurt. He knew it
[1:15:14] was going to be painful. He knew that he
[1:15:16] was fixing to be tortured like no man
[1:15:18] had ever endured in their life.
[1:15:21] it was coming his way. And he says,
[1:15:24] "Father, if it be if you be willing,
[1:15:28] remove this cup from me.
[1:15:32] Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be
[1:15:35] done."
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; So, he's looking out here. Jesus is
[1:15:38] showing obedience and willingness to
[1:15:41] sacrifice himself for the salvation of
[1:15:44] all the world, for you and I. He's
[1:15:47] looking out there now. His flesh,
[1:15:50] his flesh was saying, "No, no, no."
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But his heart said yes,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; yes, yes.
[1:16:00] And so when we take the communion, it'll
[1:16:02] be such a reminder to us when we look at
[1:16:04] that blood and we look at that wine and
[1:16:06] we look at that bread that's sitting
[1:16:07] there before us of the blood that was
[1:16:09] shed on Calvary. And just we ought to
[1:16:11] think and think how he just as a human
[1:16:14] element, he said, "No, I don't want to
[1:16:16] do this. I don't want to go through
[1:16:17] this. Father, if you be willing, let it
[1:16:19] pass from me,
[1:16:26] but nonetheless,
[1:16:29] not what I want.
[1:16:33] Not what I want in life,
[1:16:37] what you want,
[1:16:39] what you want.
[1:16:43] Jesus had to submit himself to the plan.
[1:16:47] He had a commission,
[1:16:50] savior of world.
[1:16:53] We've already established he couldn't
[1:16:54] have done it in Moses's time. He
[1:16:56] couldn't have done it in mo in Noah's
[1:16:57] time. He came in his time. It was his
[1:17:00] time in the garden of Gethsemane.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And it was his time to accept the plan
[1:17:05] of God. In order for you to have
[1:17:08] overcoming power, Jesus accepted the
[1:17:10] plan. In order for you to have the Holy
[1:17:12] Ghost in your life to lead you and guide
[1:17:14] you, it was Jesus submitting to the
[1:17:16] plan.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; In order for you to be redeemed,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; pulled out of the old pawn shop and and
[1:17:24] out of the grips of the sticky fingers
[1:17:26] of Satan, God Jesus had to submit to the
[1:17:29] plan.
[1:17:31] So what about you?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; What about us?
[1:17:37] How submissive are we? How how
[1:17:39] submissive are we when God calls us to
[1:17:41] do something? How submissive are we when
[1:17:43] he says, "Get this out of your house.
[1:17:46] Get this out of your home. Get this out
[1:17:48] of your life.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; It's going to hurt
[1:17:54] because you enjoy it,
[1:17:57] but I can't take you no further until
[1:18:04] submitting to the plan."
[1:18:07] You see, we look at the Bible. We look
[1:18:10] at the church ages. For time's sake, I'm
[1:18:13] going to skip some of this. We'll bring
[1:18:14] it in at a later date. We look at this
[1:18:16] Bible and we look at the church ages and
[1:18:18] we have to acknowledge and we have to
[1:18:19] establish that there were commissioned
[1:18:22] men of God
[1:18:24] on the scene. There was a Moses. Moses
[1:18:26] had to be coni commissioned to be a
[1:18:29] deliverer.
[1:18:30] There had to be a David on the scene.
[1:18:33] There had to be a David who was a
[1:18:34] warrior who could stand and look at the
[1:18:36] the the very giant you face from day to
[1:18:39] day and look at giant right in the eyes
[1:18:41] and say, "I come to you in the name of
[1:18:43] the Lord."
[1:18:45] We had to have a David who was
[1:18:47] commissioned. There had to be Matthew,
[1:18:48] Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Andrew, all the
[1:18:51] disciples. They had to be a commission
[1:18:53] in their lives. They left everything.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Think about the life they lived. They
[1:18:59] walked away from it all.
[1:19:02] Matthew, a very prominent tax collector,
[1:19:07] despised by his people,
[1:19:11] but rich.
[1:19:13] Real rich.
[1:19:16] He walks away from it all. There had to
[1:19:19] be a Paul who had a commission.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; There had to be an Irenius with a
[1:19:25] commission, a Martin. There had to be a
[1:19:28] Paul with a commission. What was his
[1:19:30] commission? I want you to take the word
[1:19:32] and go to the Gentiles.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know that that started that you
[1:19:38] was in the mind of God when he
[1:19:40] commissioned Paul?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You and I were in the very mind of God
[1:19:45] when all of that started before the
[1:19:47] foundation of the world. And God sets us
[1:19:49] all this plan in order.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; There had to be women commissioned of
[1:19:56] God.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there there had to be a Ruth
[1:20:00] so that we would know what a kinsman
[1:20:02] redeemer was. There had to be an Esther.
[1:20:05] There had to be a Mary, mother of Jesus.
[1:20:07] There had to be there had to be a a
[1:20:11] Rahab the harlot
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; to show us there is a way back.
[1:20:17] There had to be a Mary Magdalene,
[1:20:20] somebody who would pour out everything
[1:20:22] that she had at the feet of Jesus and
[1:20:24] just worship him and love him and show
[1:20:26] us how to adore our Lord Jesus.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; There had to be a woman at the well
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; who when she heard the prophesying of
[1:20:36] the word said, "I know where this comes
[1:20:38] from. This comes from what I've been
[1:20:40] taught from my childhood that when the
[1:20:42] Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all these
[1:20:45] things and you must be the one.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; She was commissioned.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't by chance that he was sitting
[1:20:54] at the well or that she had to go draw
[1:20:56] water.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I think the prophet said too,
[1:21:01] omnipotence met.
[1:21:05] There was even
[1:21:07] there was even a little boy that was
[1:21:09] commissioned in the word.
[1:21:13] 5,000 men sat on a hillside with their
[1:21:16] wives and children hungry,
[1:21:19] feeding on the word, feeding on the
[1:21:21] word, losing track of time and so much
[1:21:23] that they said, "We've been sitting here
[1:21:24] all day and almost all night and they
[1:21:26] haven't eaten. Lord, what are we going
[1:21:28] to do?" And this little boy comes
[1:21:30] walking up with a little bag,
[1:21:32] a little satchel, a little box. It's not
[1:21:36] much, but mama gave me five loaves and
[1:21:40] two fish.
[1:21:44] You think he wasn't commissioned to be
[1:21:46] there?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You think he wasn't pre-ordained? You
[1:21:50] think it wasn't by the mind of God that
[1:21:52] said, "Hey, I need this little boy to
[1:21:54] come and teach these people how to share
[1:21:56] what they've got with the people.
[1:22:01] I'm going to share and I'm going to give
[1:22:03] and I'm going to share.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Until they took up 12 basketfuls.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You got a commission, too.
[1:22:19] It's not just the little boy in the
[1:22:20] Bible. It's not just Matthew, Mark,
[1:22:22] Luke, and John. It's not just Ruth. It's
[1:22:23] not just Naomi. It's not just these
[1:22:25] people.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's me and it's you.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; It's your children.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Want you to listen to this prayer. I'm
[1:22:36] going to read this prayer to you. If
[1:22:38] brother Brandham's praying.
[1:22:41] He says, "Heavenly Father,
[1:22:44] take us now, Lord. Let us let the great
[1:22:46] shepherd, the great redeeming shepherd,
[1:22:48] the great shepherd who left glory." What
[1:22:50] a words.
[1:22:53] He said, "Knowing that some of the
[1:22:54] attributes was lost on them great
[1:22:56] valleys of sin where the wolves and the
[1:22:58] animals would soon devour that little
[1:22:59] sheep. But he left his golden corridors,
[1:23:04] came down into the earth, and was made
[1:23:06] one of us so that he could declare the
[1:23:08] love of God to us.
[1:23:12] There he found them." Some
[1:23:14] denominations. How many come out of a
[1:23:15] denomination? Raise your hands.
[1:23:20] Yeah. Say there's a handful of us. Well,
[1:23:22] I'm going to get the rest of you. I
[1:23:23] promise. Some of them out of houses of
[1:23:26] ill fame.
[1:23:28] You might not want to raise your hands.
[1:23:31] If you was drugging, drinking, doping,
[1:23:34] partying, carousing.
[1:23:38] Some of them on the streets,
[1:23:42] some of them blind.
[1:23:44] And I think about that when he says
[1:23:45] blind, I think some people just blind to
[1:23:47] the word.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Blind to the word. Not not not
[1:23:51] physically but spiritually just blind.
[1:23:54] He got them.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Some of them in the hedges and the
[1:23:58] highways.
[1:24:01] Now, how many some of this I said
[1:24:03] applies to you.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands. Come on. Defy gravity.
[1:24:07] Say it applies to you. Everybody in
[1:24:08] here. Everybody raise your hands.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:24:15] Because it applies to you in some
[1:24:17] aspect. And he says, "But he redeemed
[1:24:20] every single one that the father had
[1:24:23] ordained him to redeem."
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to the next statement. He says,
[1:24:30] "He commissioned us."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't see you as a tax collector, a
[1:24:38] drunkard, a harlot.
[1:24:41] He saw you as somebody that he was going
[1:24:43] to commission to do a work and to do a
[1:24:45] job
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; on your life. He looks beyond your
[1:24:50] faults.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; He commissioned us that we would live,
[1:24:56] listen to this, this is important, that
[1:24:58] we would live this part of the word for
[1:25:02] our ages.
[1:25:11] Somebody's going to live this leodysian
[1:25:13] church age.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to overcome the
[1:25:17] lukewarmness of this age. There's been a
[1:25:20] commission that's went out and said
[1:25:22] somebody's going to rapture out of this
[1:25:25] world.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what if the grave?"
[1:25:29] Don't worry, he ain't forgot you.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; But somebody's going to rapture out of
[1:25:35] this world.
[1:25:37] He commissioned. We see the great
[1:25:39] reformation of Luther in that age.
[1:25:41] Wesley and the Pentecost. But now we're
[1:25:44] looking for the headstone of that city,
[1:25:49] the capstone.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I like brother Matthew and he brought it
[1:25:56] out. Love, charity being the greatest of
[1:26:00] the three. Love. He's looking for that
[1:26:03] capstone. He says, 'We know the age and
[1:26:06] the promise that we are given for this
[1:26:08] day. It has to be restored again.
[1:26:12] The evening light shall ripen the fruit
[1:26:14] of it.
[1:26:16] Now listen,
[1:26:18] it does the fruit no good if it's
[1:26:20] setting hanging on the vine in the
[1:26:23] shade.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that's just
[1:26:31] hanging. They're hanging fruit.
[1:26:36] But they're not reaching for the light.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Where's your best apples, Brother Steve?
[1:26:46] It don't take a genius.
[1:26:49] You got to get in that light. You say,
[1:26:52] "I know I'm a child of God." Get in the
[1:26:54] light.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; I know there's more for me. Get in the
[1:26:57] light. I know that God can use me. Get
[1:27:00] in the light and let yourself start to
[1:27:02] grow and produce into the fruit that God
[1:27:05] intends you to be. Don't just be hanging
[1:27:07] fruit on the bottom of the tree.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; You know what happens to that hanging
[1:27:11] fruit on the bottom of the tree?
[1:27:15] It loses its strength.
[1:27:17] The animals come by and eat it. It falls
[1:27:21] off the tree onto the ground
[1:27:24] and it rots away.
[1:27:28] So don't be that hanging fruit on the
[1:27:29] bottom of the tree. He said, "It shall
[1:27:32] come to pass that in the evening time it
[1:27:34] shall be light."
[1:27:38] Listen what he says to these people. Now
[1:27:40] we all raised our hands. They did, too.
[1:27:44] Because he said, "Lord,
[1:27:47] help these who raised their hands." How
[1:27:50] many of us say, "Lord, help me tonight.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Help me tonight." And he says, "Lord,
[1:27:55] help these who raise their hands. May
[1:27:58] they buckle up a little tighter.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; We're on a ride, brothers and sisters.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You want to be strapped in for this
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; because things are happening so fast."
[1:28:09] He says, "May they buckle up a little
[1:28:10] tighter, shod themselves with the gospel
[1:28:13] of peace, put on the full armor of God,
[1:28:16] the pull the helmet down,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; put up the shield of faith, march
[1:28:23] forward from today on, grant it, Lord,
[1:28:26] because just in a little while, he says,
[1:28:28] "We're going to be summoned."
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; What is a summon?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; They come knocking on your door and say,
[1:28:35] "Hey, you got to show up in court."
[1:28:37] That's not the summon he's talking
[1:28:38] about. He's saying the trumpets are
[1:28:41] going to sound.
[1:28:43] The dead in Christ are going to rise.
[1:28:45] The rapture, somebody's leaving here.
[1:28:48] Might as well be you.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I said it might as well be you.
[1:28:55] Everybody wants to win.
[1:28:58] Hey, devil. We win.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; The Kentucky Lottery. Well, that's what
[1:29:03] they say, ain't it? Somebody's going to
[1:29:05] win. Might as well be you.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to rapture.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Might as well be you.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; So down through the ages, believer after
[1:29:17] believer after believer, they've been
[1:29:19] called. They've been chosen. They've
[1:29:20] been pulled into the work of God and
[1:29:22] commissioned to carry out through the
[1:29:25] word.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Without a commissioned people, where
[1:29:30] would we be?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't think about that a lot, do
[1:29:34] you? Do you realize Jesus was a one-man
[1:29:37] mission?
[1:29:39] Do you realize when his ministry
[1:29:40] started, it was Jesus?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:29:48] Jesus started ministering at what age?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; 30.
[1:29:55] I'm quizzing you a little bit. The
[1:29:57] Hoffman's head of Christ is is depicted
[1:29:59] Jesus at what age?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; 33.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; 33.
[1:30:04] So he he ministered for somewhere around
[1:30:06] three to three and a half years.
[1:30:09] Do you realize that?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You know, they you got so much
[1:30:15] technology now that you can do and look
[1:30:17] up and find anything.
[1:30:20] They took and they took all the sermons
[1:30:22] that he preached that were documented,
[1:30:24] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. All the
[1:30:26] documented sermons. And then they begin
[1:30:29] to pick them out and found out which
[1:30:31] ones overlapped where and which ones
[1:30:32] were written about twice. And they
[1:30:35] determined they wanted to determine how
[1:30:36] many sermons, how many days did Jesus
[1:30:39] preach,
[1:30:41] documented, preached in his three and a
[1:30:44] half years. You know how many days it
[1:30:45] was?
[1:30:47] 27 days.
[1:30:54] You can go into any corner of the world
[1:30:58] and people know the name of Jesus.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; For 27 days, he preached in a three
[1:31:06] three and a half year span. And now
[1:31:09] through the message of the hour,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; this end time message.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about a commission? How
[1:31:16] many times did it go around the world?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Seven times around the world. We're
[1:31:21] going to get into that a little later,
[1:31:23] too. When we think about what happened
[1:31:25] in in Leota, when that church age began
[1:31:28] over here in in the Leosian church age,
[1:31:30] when it began right there in 1906, so
[1:31:33] many so many tremendous things happened
[1:31:36] and opened up. And when you line it all
[1:31:38] up, you begin to see that God, he don't
[1:31:41] make no mistakes.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; He caused events to happen, people to
[1:31:46] come on the scene.
[1:31:52] because they have a commission. When you
[1:31:54] talk about a commission, I want you to
[1:31:56] look at this for just a minute here.
[1:31:57] When you talk about a commission,
[1:32:01] commission means you're written a
[1:32:03] warrant granting power to perform
[1:32:06] various acts and duties.
[1:32:11] When you've been written a commission,
[1:32:13] it gives you the authority to act for,
[1:32:15] in behalf of, or in place of another.
[1:32:21] Oh, who you working for?
[1:32:25] Huh?
[1:32:27] I wish I could think of what I seen the
[1:32:29] other day. It was good.
[1:32:33] You're either working for God or you're
[1:32:34] working for the devil.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; There's no there's no middle ground.
[1:32:40] I think it takes us right back to that
[1:32:42] scripture where it says he likes you
[1:32:44] either hot or cold.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; If you're lukewarm, he's going to what?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You ever you ever took a drink of warm
[1:32:53] water?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to challenge you to go home
[1:32:55] and do it. You get you a glass of
[1:32:57] lukewarm water and you turn it up and
[1:33:00] you see if your belly don't boil.
[1:33:04] He wants us either hot or cold. We're
[1:33:08] either for him or against him. There's
[1:33:10] no two ways about it.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; You're either for him or you're against
[1:33:14] him. We look here in the word and we see
[1:33:16] that John the Baptist, John the Baptist
[1:33:19] was commissioned to do the work of God
[1:33:20] for his hour. Now you say, why are you
[1:33:24] going down the road of John the Baptist?
[1:33:25] Because John the Baptist role plays so
[1:33:27] much in William Brham's role.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; So John the Baptist here, he came out
[1:33:34] into the wilderness. He came out of the
[1:33:35] wilderness preaching and telling him to
[1:33:37] what? Repent for the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:38] is at hand. And he comes out and he
[1:33:41] brings this message. And he's telling
[1:33:43] them, this is the word that was spoken
[1:33:45] by Isaiah. This is the word that you
[1:33:47] should know. I am the one of the voice
[1:33:49] crying out of the wilderness. Prepare
[1:33:51] yourself a way for the Lord is coming.
[1:33:55] Make paths straight.
[1:34:02] Now Isaiah 43, that was in Matthew 3.
[1:34:05] Now listen to what Isaiah 43 describes
[1:34:08] it. 40:3
[1:34:11] he describes the one of the voice
[1:34:12] calling out in the wilderness. He says,
[1:34:14] "The voice of him that crith in the
[1:34:16] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[1:34:17] Lord, make straight in the desert a
[1:34:19] highway for our God." Now, they should
[1:34:22] know this word. You think about these
[1:34:25] Pharisees. They should know the word of
[1:34:28] God.
[1:34:29] Every valley shall be exalted. Every
[1:34:31] mountain and hill shall be made low.
[1:34:33] Every crook shall be made straight. and
[1:34:35] the rough places plain. And the glory of
[1:34:37] the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
[1:34:39] shall see it together. For the mouth of
[1:34:42] the Lord hath spoken it.
[1:34:45] So we look at John the Baptist and here
[1:34:46] he has a call for repentance and he's
[1:34:49] trying to get them to spiritually
[1:34:50] prepare themsel for the Messiah.
[1:34:54] Now I want you to look at his commission
[1:34:56] here. He is sitting out here and he's
[1:34:58] coming into Jerusalem and he's baptized.
[1:35:01] They that were baptized of him in the
[1:35:03] Jordan confessing their sin. And now all
[1:35:05] these Pharisees are looking around.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; You know, anytime when God's on the
[1:35:10] move, there's the devil's always going
[1:35:11] to look and say, "What in the world is
[1:35:12] going on?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; What are those people doing?
[1:35:17] Are they getting closer? Are they
[1:35:19] getting farther?" And these Pharisees
[1:35:22] sitting there and they're looking
[1:35:23] around. They're trying to see. They come
[1:35:25] to this baptism
[1:35:30] and John the Baptist cries out to them.
[1:35:35] He knew they wasn't going to give up
[1:35:36] their old ways.
[1:35:39] He knew they wasn't going to give up
[1:35:40] they wasn't going to give up their
[1:35:41] traditions.
[1:35:43] He knew they wasn't going to they wasn't
[1:35:45] going to submit to the Messiah the way
[1:35:46] he was coming. He knew they wasn't going
[1:35:49] to going to submit to him being one
[1:35:51] crying out of the wilderness. Can you
[1:35:53] imagine what this guy looked like? Some
[1:35:54] of us would look at him and say, "Man,
[1:35:55] he looks like some kind of scallwag.
[1:36:00] Long hair, beard, living out in the
[1:36:03] forest, stinking probably."
[1:36:07] And these Pharisees come up here and
[1:36:09] they're looking at this and what does he
[1:36:10] say to them? You generation of vipers.
[1:36:17] And he says, "Don't tell me I hadn't
[1:36:19] warned you about what's about to come.
[1:36:24] I'm giving you a chance.
[1:36:27] I'm giving you a chance. I'm giving you
[1:36:28] a chance. I'm giving you the warning.
[1:36:30] I'm giving you the commission of the
[1:36:33] hour."
[1:36:34] And here's these Pharisees. They're out
[1:36:36] there. And he knew they couldn't do it.
[1:36:40] And he tells them, listen what he tells
[1:36:42] them. bring forth fruits for repentance.
[1:36:46] In other words, show me you've changed.
[1:36:50] Show me something in your life is
[1:36:52] different.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Show me that you mean business between
[1:36:56] you and God.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; They couldn't do it. They couldn't do
[1:37:02] it. They couldn't give themselves over
[1:37:04] and get rid of their old traditions.
[1:37:06] And they said this. They said, "We have
[1:37:08] Abraham to our father.
[1:37:12] We've got the laws of Moses.
[1:37:15] We've got the word of Abraham and Isaac
[1:37:18] and Jacob. We've got all the scrolls.
[1:37:20] We've got all of this and and we've got
[1:37:22] all of this." And he says that God is
[1:37:25] able for these stones to rise up
[1:37:27] children unto Abraham.
[1:37:30] What does he tell them?
[1:37:32] The axe is laid to the tree.
[1:37:36] In other words, they could not be
[1:37:38] fruitful anymore.
[1:37:42] Are you with me?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And he tells them, "I baptize you with
[1:37:46] water unto repentance,
[1:37:49] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:37:53] than I,
[1:37:55] whose shoes that I'm not worthy to bear,
[1:37:57] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:00] and fire."
[1:38:04] You see, John the Baptist never pointed
[1:38:06] anybody to me.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; He always pointed them to Christ.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He kept pointing them back to Christ.
[1:38:15] Back to Christ, back to Christ.
[1:38:19] In your church age book, if you want to
[1:38:21] mark, if you're making notes, church age
[1:38:23] book, it's verse uh or paragraph 21.
[1:38:29] He says, "Now you will recall that I
[1:38:31] mentioned at the beginning of this
[1:38:32] message that this book that we are
[1:38:34] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:38:36] Jesus himself
[1:38:38] in the church and in his and his works
[1:38:42] in the future ages." So brothers and
[1:38:44] sisters, John the Baptist was trying his
[1:38:47] best to get these Pharisees to see what
[1:38:50] was happening and he was trying his best
[1:38:52] to show them the correct way, but they
[1:38:54] couldn't accept the message for their
[1:38:56] hour. They could not be obedient to it.
[1:39:00] Do you see part of commission? If you're
[1:39:03] going to be commissioned, part of that
[1:39:04] is to be obedient.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Obedient to the word. When you hear the
[1:39:08] word, you take it in and you begin to
[1:39:10] you begin to eat on it. You begin to
[1:39:12] feast on it. You begin to live that word
[1:39:14] that you hear and that you take in.
[1:39:19] And they couldn't do it. That's why we
[1:39:21] need the Holy Spirit to live in our
[1:39:23] lives to show us the revelation of where
[1:39:26] we need to be in this hour.
[1:39:29] Listen, he says it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:39:31] to give us revelation or we fail to get
[1:39:33] it. Bringing these two thoughts
[1:39:35] together, you'll see that it doesn't
[1:39:37] just take an ordinary study and thinking
[1:39:39] to make this book real.
[1:39:42] He said it's going to take an operation
[1:39:43] of the Holy Ghost. That means this book
[1:39:45] can't be revealed to anyone but raise
[1:39:49] your hand. Amen.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; A special class of people.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; A special class of people. It will take
[1:39:58] one with a prophetic insight.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He's talking to you.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; It's going to take somebody that's going
[1:40:05] to come and open this word. It'll
[1:40:07] require the ability to hear from God.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you see why it's so important
[1:40:14] that we find ourselves in a quiet place?
[1:40:17] That we get alone. Sometimes you got to
[1:40:18] get alone. Let me tell you, men, women,
[1:40:20] children, find yourself in a quiet place
[1:40:23] and say, "God,
[1:40:26] Lord Jesus,
[1:40:29] speak to me."
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ber made a statement
[1:40:34] back here. You may not have seen it the
[1:40:36] way I did, but he was talking to me.
[1:40:38] He's preaching. He turned. He said,
[1:40:39] "Brother Brad, if you will listen, God
[1:40:41] will speak to you."
[1:40:46] And that sounds elementary.
[1:40:48] That sounds simple,
[1:40:50] but so many times our minds are
[1:40:52] cluttered with the noise of the world,
[1:40:54] the job, the home, the kids, the work,
[1:40:57] all the stuff begins to add up. The
[1:40:59] bills are due, the cars broke down, the
[1:41:01] lawnmower quit.
[1:41:05] And do you even listen?
[1:41:08] Can you hear when he begins to speak?
[1:41:11] So, we need that quiet time. He says,
[1:41:14] "Not just a student comparing verse for
[1:41:16] verse.
[1:41:19] You can get together in Bible studies
[1:41:20] and you can sit here and you can debate
[1:41:22] with a Baptist, a Methodist, a
[1:41:23] Pentecostal, an Amish, a Menanite, a
[1:41:26] message."
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I said it.
[1:41:32] You can be go verse for verse for verse.
[1:41:34] He said, "But that's not what we're
[1:41:36] talking about. That's good, but the
[1:41:38] Pharisees were good, too.
[1:41:41] The Pharisees were the best scholars of
[1:41:43] the day. It is said that they could take
[1:41:45] a pen.
[1:41:47] I've had this in my Bible for years. I'm
[1:41:48] going to show it to you.
[1:41:57] Anybody know what that is?
[1:42:00] It's a hat pen.
[1:42:02] Found it in an estate sale
[1:42:07] and it struck to me. I thought I'm going
[1:42:09] to stick that in my Bible because the
[1:42:11] Pharisees could take a pen and run it
[1:42:13] down through the scrolls and tell you
[1:42:16] what chapter it was in.
[1:42:21] I ain't that good.
[1:42:24] But they knew the word. They were the
[1:42:27] best scholars of the day. They knew it
[1:42:30] word for word, verse for verse. They
[1:42:31] could recite it. They knew the laws.
[1:42:33] They knew what you're supposed to do,
[1:42:34] what you can't do, when you can do it,
[1:42:37] what was acceptable on the Sabbath. They
[1:42:39] knew all of this stuff, but they didn't
[1:42:41] have a revelation.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; They knew Isaiah.
[1:42:47] They knew what Isaiah said. But think
[1:42:49] about this. 700 years had passed between
[1:42:53] Isaiah's prophecy
[1:42:55] and when John the Baptist came on the
[1:42:57] scene.
[1:43:00] How quickly they forget the word.
[1:43:03] How quickly they forget the word. They
[1:43:05] just looked at this man and said, "Man,
[1:43:06] this man is crazy.
[1:43:08] John the Baptist is a crazy man. Don't
[1:43:11] listen to him. Don't go to his meetings.
[1:43:13] Don't go with him. It's mental
[1:43:14] telepathy."
[1:43:17] I just heard today Brother Brown said
[1:43:19] they accused him of being in sorcery.
[1:43:26] He just kind of chuckled.
[1:43:30] He knew his commission.
[1:43:34] He says, "But a mystery requires a
[1:43:36] teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:43:39] becomes clear."
[1:43:41] You see the it is the revelation of God
[1:43:44] that will give you the authority over
[1:43:47] the devil. How many wants authority over
[1:43:49] the devil?
[1:43:50] We all seek that and desire that that
[1:43:52] whenever we have face to face with the
[1:43:54] devil, we want the authority to be able
[1:43:56] to say, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[1:43:58] That we can apply the word in our lives,
[1:44:02] the spoken word to rebuke the devil and
[1:44:04] get him out of our life.
[1:44:09] Let's move on.
[1:44:11] I don't want to miss nothing important.
[1:44:13] It's all important.
[1:44:21] Verse 27,
[1:44:23] I say verse, paragraph 27.
[1:44:27] The seven spirits before the throne is a
[1:44:29] spirit that would come in each of the
[1:44:30] seven messengers.
[1:44:33] Now, I want you to listen what he says
[1:44:34] those those seven spirits do. The se to
[1:44:37] the seven messengers, it's giving them
[1:44:40] their ministries.
[1:44:44] It's giving them their commission.
[1:44:47] The seven messengers, the seven stars,
[1:44:49] the seven messengers, the spirits come
[1:44:51] down and has given them their
[1:44:52] commission. He says, "Now we have all
[1:44:55] these expressions. Him which is, him
[1:44:57] which was, is to come. Faithful witness,
[1:44:59] firstborn from among the dead, the
[1:45:01] prince of kings of the earth, the alpha,
[1:45:03] the omega, the almighty.
[1:45:05] These are titles and descriptions of the
[1:45:08] one and the same person."
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; H
[1:45:13] listen to this. The spirit of God in
[1:45:16] John expresses thusly in order to set
[1:45:19] forth the supreme deity of Jesus and to
[1:45:22] reveal the Godhead as
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; one God.
[1:45:28] He says today there is a gross error.
[1:45:30] Now listen, it isn't there are three
[1:45:33] gods instead of one. There is one God
[1:45:36] with three titles, father, son, holy
[1:45:38] ghost.
[1:45:40] This mighty revelation is what the early
[1:45:42] church had.
[1:45:47] I meant to I meant to send a a thing to
[1:45:50] Carson to have him put it on the screen
[1:45:51] and keep it up there. We're talking
[1:45:53] about Ephesus, Paul, faith. This is what
[1:45:57] the early church had. They didn't
[1:45:59] believe in no three gods.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; No, they they they witnessed it.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; They witnessed God in action. They
[1:46:08] witnessed God as a father and as a son
[1:46:10] and nana and then as the Holy Ghost as
[1:46:12] the day of Pentecost. They witnessed the
[1:46:14] very same thing. So they didn't believe
[1:46:15] that we have one God. He's all of this.
[1:46:19] I'm the alpha, the omega, the beginning,
[1:46:21] the end, which was, which is, and which
[1:46:23] is to come, the almighty. Brothers and
[1:46:25] sisters, based on the trinitarian
[1:46:27] traditions, we would have to break God
[1:46:30] down into hundreds of gods.
[1:46:35] Not just father, not just son, not just
[1:46:38] holy ghost, but we would have to break
[1:46:40] it down into into these numbers that we
[1:46:42] couldn't even keep up with. God the
[1:46:44] love, God of peace, God of joy, God of
[1:46:48] power. Now, I'm going somewhere with
[1:46:50] this. God of holiness, God of mercy, God
[1:46:52] that overcomes, God of grace, God the
[1:46:54] creator, God the healer. Can you see how
[1:46:57] this list goes on and on and on and on?
[1:47:00] So, where did this come from? He says it
[1:47:03] was a it was in the Nyan council.
[1:47:07] The Nyan council. That's where this
[1:47:09] nonsense came from. They took the word
[1:47:12] and they began to have a foundational
[1:47:14] doctrine in in 325 AD, the trinitarian
[1:47:18] doctrine, and they had based upon the
[1:47:21] many gods that Rome had.
[1:47:26] So when you're baptized in the name of
[1:47:28] the father, son, and holy ghost, you are
[1:47:31] baptizing yourself into a pagan
[1:47:33] religion.
[1:47:39] Is this okay, brother Ber?
[1:47:43] When you're baptized in those titles,
[1:47:45] father, son, holy ghost, that is a pagan
[1:47:48] religion. Now, I want you to watch here
[1:47:50] how the how the devil tries to hide his
[1:47:53] perverted agenda with with the word and
[1:47:55] pull people away from the one true God.
[1:48:00] He said instead of having Jupiter,
[1:48:03] Venus, Mars, etc., etc., now we have
[1:48:07] Paul, Peter, Fatima, Christopher, etc.,
[1:48:10] etc. They make it a pagan. They cannot
[1:48:14] make their pagan religion work out with
[1:48:16] just one god.
[1:48:23] pagan religion. You know what pagan
[1:48:25] means? That's satanic.
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to listen to this. I'm
[1:48:32] trying to get to a stopping point.
[1:48:36] Here's a comprehensive list, an
[1:48:38] extensive comprehensive list of the
[1:48:40] saints
[1:48:43] that the Catholic Church recognizes. Do
[1:48:46] you know how many saints there are? Or
[1:48:47] who would like to guess? Just somebody
[1:48:48] throw me a number. Josh, brother Josh
[1:48:50] show, throw me a number. How many saints
[1:48:51] are there in the Catholic Church?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; 400.
[1:48:56] Somebody else. This is this is
[1:48:59] interactive here. That means go higher.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; 600.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; How? Who said that?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Got it. Who said 10? Who said 10,000?
[1:49:17] Brother Ber Rachel did y'all split the
[1:49:20] prize. Give them a hand.
[1:49:24] 10,000 saints that they have identified
[1:49:27] in their perverted religion.
[1:49:30] 10,000 saints. St. Michael a warrior.
[1:49:34] St. Francis lover. St. Joseph an earthly
[1:49:38] father and model. St. Patrick a patron
[1:49:42] saint of Ireland. You know, brother
[1:49:43] Brown talked about St. Patrick. a lot of
[1:49:46] good things about St. Patrick and he
[1:49:49] talks about him in that age. St. Paul
[1:49:52] the Apostle, a key figure. These these
[1:49:54] are no doubt men of God.
[1:49:58] But saints,
[1:50:00] you're placing them up there right
[1:50:02] there. You're placing them up there in a
[1:50:04] in a place of deity with Jesus Christ.
[1:50:08] Come on, church.
[1:50:11] St. Mary Magdalene,
[1:50:14] St. Augustus, St. Thomas, St. Nicholas,
[1:50:17] St. Valentine. Oh, don't we love him.
[1:50:25] I'm just going to keep going.
[1:50:28] St. Lucy, St. Martin, St. John the
[1:50:30] Baptist, St. John the Apostle, St.
[1:50:32] Peter, St. Clare. This is just a
[1:50:35] starting point. On and on and on and on
[1:50:39] and on. all of these saints put in place
[1:50:42] under the umbrella of religion.
[1:50:46] If I had to try to remember all these
[1:50:48] saints to get down and pray to,
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I I I'll just be honest. Sometimes I
[1:50:52] struggle just to pray to God.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a chore and it str it
[1:50:58] struggles me and it's it's it's it's
[1:50:59] it's taxing on me to take time to go
[1:51:02] say, "Lord, I need to speak to you."
[1:51:04] Now, can you imagine if you had to go
[1:51:06] speak to every one of these?
[1:51:09] St. Valentine, my wife's mad at me.
[1:51:15] Can you please tenderize her heart?
[1:51:23] I didn't mean to do it.
[1:51:26] I meant to take the trash out.
[1:51:28] Can you imagine how the the nonsense and
[1:51:31] the hypocrisy of having to pray to this
[1:51:34] God after God after God after God after
[1:51:36] God when all we got to do is stand and
[1:51:38] turn to the Lord Jesus Christ. He meets
[1:51:42] all of our needs. He's the alpha, the
[1:51:45] omega, the beginning, the end, the
[1:51:47] first, the last. He's the omnipotent
[1:51:49] one. He's the one that reignth. He's the
[1:51:51] king of kings, the lord of lords,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; the mighty redeemer.
[1:51:58] That's what he is. He's all of these.
[1:52:02] And I thought about it this way.
[1:52:05] I thought about it this way. This is the
[1:52:08] way it came to me.
[1:52:11] All of this
[1:52:13] that God is.
[1:52:15] How many knows what DBA is in business?
[1:52:19] Doing business as? That's what DBA
[1:52:22] stands for. So you could be you could be
[1:52:26] uh
[1:52:28] Guthrie Scrapyard doing business as
[1:52:30] Joe's Lawn Care, Joe's furniture shop,
[1:52:33] Joe's whatever. You can add all these
[1:52:36] DBAs. And when I heard that, I thought
[1:52:38] that's the way my God works.
[1:52:42] He is all these things.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; When I'm sick, he does business as a
[1:52:47] healer.
[1:52:49] When I'm grieving, he does business as a
[1:52:52] comforter.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; When I'm lost, he did business as a
[1:52:56] savior.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; So, he's all of these things. When
[1:52:59] you're anxious, he's peace. When you're
[1:53:00] sad, he's joy. When you're depressed, he
[1:53:02] does business as the lily of the valley.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That's what God is. All of these titles,
[1:53:08] he's every bit of it. But, father, son,
[1:53:12] holy ghost, healer, lover, comforter,
[1:53:15] that's not a name.
[1:53:18] There's one name.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; There's one name. Now listen to what he
[1:53:23] says. That's why we baptize in the name
[1:53:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:53:38] just stood out to me. He goes on to say,
[1:53:42] "This is the this is the name of those
[1:53:44] titles." Just like you take a newborn
[1:53:47] baby who is a son and name him, baby is
[1:53:50] what it is. Son is the title, then you
[1:53:53] give him a name, John Henry Brown.
[1:53:56] Now, here's where it stood out to me
[1:53:58] that man, we have to be real, real
[1:54:00] careful. Now, we all believe in
[1:54:01] baptizing in Jesus' name, right?
[1:54:06] You don't just baptize in Jesus' name
[1:54:10] because there's thousands of Jesus's in
[1:54:12] the world.
[1:54:15] I had to think back, my friends.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Who have I baptized?
[1:54:20] How did I baptize them?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Did I baptize them in Jesus' name? Or
[1:54:30] did I baptize them in the Lord Jesus
[1:54:33] Christ?
[1:54:35] He said because there's many Jesuses in
[1:54:37] the world. There has been before Jesus
[1:54:39] and there will be many more. He said but
[1:54:41] there's only one of those that were born
[1:54:43] the Christ. He says that's the Lord
[1:54:46] Jesus
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; So do you see how the commission goes
[1:54:52] out? How the commission goes forth? How
[1:54:55] important it is that we do exactly what
[1:54:57] he says?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Word for word, jot on jot, tit on tit.
[1:55:03] We do exactly what the word says.
[1:55:09] Want you to listen to this.
[1:55:16] What? We talk about baptism and we're
[1:55:18] going to close.
[1:55:19] The importance of baptism. We've had a
[1:55:21] lot of baptisms here lately. That's
[1:55:23] good. That's that's wonderful. Every
[1:55:26] soul's worth 10,000 worlds.
[1:55:29] But if you have not been baptized
[1:55:31] correctly,
[1:55:33] you might want to think about this
[1:55:35] because we talk about being commissioned
[1:55:37] of God. And being commissioned of God
[1:55:40] means that you have to stand up on his
[1:55:42] word. You have to be obedient to the
[1:55:44] word.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; That means you have to do it exactly the
[1:55:47] way the Bible says do it.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Stay with me. He says
[1:55:55] they say, "Well, let me back up. When
[1:55:57] Paul passed through the upper coast of
[1:55:58] Ephesus and comes into the church, there
[1:56:00] were 12 men in it. That's right. They
[1:56:02] were all good people. We're talking
[1:56:04] about Paul witnessing to the 12 now. He
[1:56:06] says they were all good people. He said
[1:56:09] they shouted and they had a great time,
[1:56:11] but they had not received the Holy Ghost
[1:56:13] yet. And Paul said, "You haven't se
[1:56:16] received the Holy Ghost since when?"
[1:56:18] Since you believed.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; All right. They said, "Well, why did we
[1:56:24] didn't know that there was a Holy
[1:56:26] Ghost?"
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's justifiable. Okay, that's a
[1:56:30] justifiable statement. He said, "Then
[1:56:32] how was you baptized?"
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "If it didn't make a
[1:56:37] difference, what did he say to that
[1:56:39] church there?"
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times people will
[1:56:42] look at you, they say, "I don't really
[1:56:43] see that it matters.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; I don't really see that it makes a
[1:56:46] difference." Whether it's father, son,
[1:56:48] holy ghost, whether it's in the name of
[1:56:50] the Lord Jesus Christ, I don't see a
[1:56:52] difference.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; The word says there's a difference.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there's a difference.
[1:56:59] Paul says there's a difference. He
[1:57:01] looked at those 12 right in the eyes and
[1:57:03] says, "You can't get the Holy Ghost
[1:57:05] until you go back and do it the right
[1:57:06] way."
[1:57:10] They said, "We've already been baptized
[1:57:11] by one of the greatest men that ever
[1:57:14] stood on the face of the earth, John the
[1:57:15] Baptist, who baptized our Lord."
[1:57:19] Ain't that baptizing good enough?
[1:57:26] He said, "Yeah, I guess it'll be all
[1:57:28] right." No, no, no, no. He said, "No,
[1:57:32] sir.
[1:57:34] No, sir. You've got to be baptized over
[1:57:39] You say, "Well, that's shameful."
[1:57:42] I'm not ashamed.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; I was baptized father, son, holy ghost
[1:57:48] the first time.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Then when I saw it in the word, I said,
[1:57:53] you know what? I need to do this the
[1:57:54] right way.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I need to do this the right way because
[1:57:58] now I feel like I'm I'm living for
[1:58:00] Christ. There's a move in my life and
[1:58:01] God is God is working on me. God is
[1:58:03] dealing with me. I want to do this the
[1:58:05] right way.
[1:58:07] So we went to brother Brian, Sister
[1:58:08] Janette's swimming pool, ice box,
[1:58:11] whatever you want to call it. I was
[1:58:13] doing cold bath before cold bath was
[1:58:15] cool.
[1:58:19] We pulled that tarp back over there.
[1:58:20] Brother Daniel Williams
[1:58:24] held meetings here.
[1:58:27] I said, "Brother Daniel, will you
[1:58:28] baptize me?" He said, "I sure will."
[1:58:31] It's funny how the world comes around.
[1:58:32] You know, that's Sister Lauren's uncle,
[1:58:38] right? Great uncle.
[1:58:42] We pulled back that that water. Pulled
[1:58:45] back that tarp.
[1:58:47] He dipped me down in that water. I now
[1:58:49] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:58:51] Jesus Christ. I come up. And nothing was
[1:58:53] different.
[1:58:57] You say, "You didn't jump. You didn't
[1:58:59] shout. You didn't scream. Nope.
[1:59:02] People clapped.
[1:59:05] I stood there.
[1:59:09] Why did you do it? The word said do it.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I want to be obedient to the word.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to come up on that day and
[1:59:18] say, "You know what? You done all this
[1:59:20] great things. You done this. You done
[1:59:21] that." Not that I'm great. Don't take me
[1:59:23] wrong. You've done this. You done that.
[1:59:24] You went here. You did this. You helped
[1:59:26] this one. You done that one. But you
[1:59:28] never did give your heart to me fully
[1:59:30] because you never were baptized.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:59:36] But I was baptized at the Christian
[1:59:37] church in the name of the father, son,
[1:59:39] holy ghost. No, that's not the way we do
[1:59:41] it around here.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; You see, you either believe it or you
[1:59:47] don't.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; You either live it or you don't. You're
[1:59:51] either obedient or you're not.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:59:57] you love the Lord tonight. And I'm not
[1:59:59] trying to scold anybody. I don't know
[2:00:00] who's been baptized, who hadn't been
[2:00:02] baptized. If you've been baptized four
[2:00:04] times, 10 times, I don't know. Just make
[2:00:06] sure you baptize the right way. You
[2:00:08] don't want to come up short on that day.
[2:00:10] Brother Ber just mentioned in a few
[2:00:11] services ago, he would hate to be
[2:00:13] standing in the very presence of God
[2:00:14] knowing that he was not baptized, right?
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, sir. You got to be
[2:00:22] baptized over
[2:00:24] cuz the kingdom is sealed to anything
[2:00:27] else.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said?
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me in.
[2:00:37] We got a seal. We got a lock on this
[2:00:38] place. Only the true, only the faithful,
[2:00:42] only the righteous, only the obedient,
[2:00:44] only the humble, only the meek, only
[2:00:47] those who've been baptized in the name
[2:00:49] of the Lord Jesus Christ can enter
[2:00:50] through this sealed city.
[2:00:57] And when they heard this, they said,
[2:00:59] John only baptized unto repentance, not
[2:01:01] for remission of sins, saying that you
[2:01:04] should believe on him to come that is on
[2:01:06] Jesus. and they heard this and they were
[2:01:08] rebaptized.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? When they heard it
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; and they they it was explained to them
[2:01:16] the difference between remission
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and redemption.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And repentance,
[2:01:25] you see, when we look at this,
[2:01:26] repentance means to turn away from your
[2:01:28] sin. Repentance just means that it
[2:01:30] involves you recognizing that you've
[2:01:32] done wrong. It involves you feeling
[2:01:33] remorse. It involves you making a
[2:01:35] decision to change your behavior.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; But when you're baptized into remission,
[2:01:42] it's as though you never done it.
[2:01:48] I want to be baptized in the redemption
[2:01:51] of Jesus Christ as though I never done
[2:01:53] it. That that blood covers all of my
[2:01:55] faults, all of my sins,
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:02:03] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we
[2:02:06] thank you, Lord, for this day and thank
[2:02:08] you for this time you've given us
[2:02:10] together and just to speak the word
[2:02:12] tonight, Lord. And thank you for what
[2:02:14] you've laid on our heart. And we just
[2:02:16] ask that you continue to bless the
[2:02:18] services, Lord. Bless bless our pastor
[2:02:20] and his wife, the church here. And we
[2:02:22] just see great things happening in our
[2:02:24] midst, Lord. And we just know as the
[2:02:26] word goes forth, the people grow. And
[2:02:28] the more the word goes, the more the
[2:02:30] people grow.
[2:02:32] A greater love begins to form. A greater
[2:02:35] desire and a passion. We can see it in
[2:02:38] some that has been so hardened. Now
[2:02:40] they're beginning to soften up.
[2:02:43] Now they're beginning to be submissive.
[2:02:46] So Lord, please continue to send your
[2:02:48] submissive spirit and power out amongst
[2:02:50] the people. If there's any flaws, if
[2:02:53] there's any hindrances, if there's
[2:02:54] anything that we're not doing that's
[2:02:56] obedient to your word, Lord, I pray that
[2:02:58] you'll just come and speak into our
[2:03:00] hearts that you will just quench
[2:03:01] something, a fire on the inside, start a
[2:03:04] fire on the inside that would say, "I
[2:03:06] want to be right, and I'm not going to
[2:03:07] quit until I get right. If it means I
[2:03:11] have to fall on my knees and pray for
[2:03:13] hours upon hours. If it means I got to
[2:03:16] fast. If it means I got to to to go and
[2:03:19] and make things right with people.
[2:03:22] I want to be right before you, God. And
[2:03:24] if there's anything that's hindering me
[2:03:28] from fulfilling the commission that
[2:03:30] you've placed in my life and in the
[2:03:32] believers in this church's life. Bring
[2:03:35] it to our awareness, Lord. Bring it to
[2:03:38] the forefront. We want to address the
[2:03:40] issues, not sweep it under the rug. Not
[2:03:42] just say, "Oh, well, it it happened
[2:03:44] yesterday and that we don't have." No,
[2:03:46] we want to tend to our faults. We want
[2:03:47] to tend to the failures. And we want to
[2:03:49] be able to say that we are truly
[2:03:51] redeemed as though we never done it as
[2:03:54] we stand under the blood of Calvary.
[2:03:58] Thank you, Lord, for all that you do in
[2:04:00] our lives, for moving in our midst. We
[2:04:02] love you, Lord. We just want to praise
[2:04:04] you. We want to worship you. We want to
[2:04:06] thank you for calling us, commissioning
[2:04:10] us as part of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[2:04:13] a group of people who will live the
[2:04:17] commission in this age as your prophet
[2:04:21] taught us. Thank you Lord. We love you
[2:04:24] with all our hearts in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:04:28] Amen.
