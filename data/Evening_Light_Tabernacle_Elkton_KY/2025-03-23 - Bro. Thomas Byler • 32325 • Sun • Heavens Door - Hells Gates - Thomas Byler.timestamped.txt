[10:28] Powerful
[10:41] to witness.
[10:57] cigarettes
[10:59] marijuana stand
[11:12] I've
[11:20] been angur
[11:38] Everyone get
[11:42] on the
[11:51] church
[12:00] right in our lives.
[12:15] Everybody
[12:17] all
[12:29] usitude is a hindrance to the house of
[12:32] God.
[12:36] We have
[12:42] people don't know what to make. Don't
[12:45] know whe
[13:13] Amen. the children can be dismissed for
[13:15] Sunday school. And if you'll go with me
[13:16] in the Psalms, we're going to go to
[13:19] Psalms
[13:25] 34. Psalms
[13:34] 34. I will bless the Lord at all times.
[13:37] His praise shall continually be in my
[13:39] mouth.
[13:47] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[13:49] exalt his name together.
[13:56] They looked unto him and were lightened
[13:59] and their faces were not ashamed.
[14:07] The angel of the Lord encampeth round
[14:08] about them that fear him and deliverth
[14:11] them.
[14:18] Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints, for
[14:21] there is no want in them that fear him.
[14:32] Come ye children, hearken unto me. I
[14:34] will teach you the fear of the Lord.
[14:44] Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips
[14:46] from speaking. Gile.
[14:52] The eyes of the Lord are upon the
[14:54] righteous, and his ears are upon open
[14:57] unto their cry.
[15:05] The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth,
[15:07] and deliverth them out of all their
[15:09] troubles.
[15:17] Many are the afflictions of the
[15:19] righteous, but the Lord deliverth them
[15:21] out of all of
[15:26] them. Evil shall slay the wicked, and
[15:29] they that hate the righteous shall be
[15:31] desolate. The Lord redeemth the soul of
[15:34] his servants. None of them that trust in
[15:37] him shall be desolate. God bless you.
[15:39] You may be seated, brother Brian.
[15:57] Morning, brothers and sisters.
[16:00] I hope you've all had a good
[16:03] week. Uh turn with me to uh Luke the
[16:06] 10th chapter.
[16:11] Before I get started, I thought I'd
[16:14] mention
[16:16] um you can ask me later, but all the
[16:20] bills are paid other than the last time
[16:22] they came and filled up the um filled up
[16:25] the tanks and I haven't gotten that bill
[16:27] yet. So, everything's paid. Everything
[16:30] gets paid autopay other than the fuel
[16:32] and the the fuel and the insurance for
[16:35] the church. Those are the only two
[16:38] things that don't get autopay and and
[16:40] it's because of the price but um a
[16:42] couple of weeks ago I made the final
[16:44] payment on the insurance so that's clear
[16:46] so the only thing the church is
[16:48] obligated to is the fuel bill and you
[16:52] know the fuel and the water and the
[16:54] power every month and so that leaves
[16:57] right now in the general fund about
[17:01] $10,000
[17:02] $10,400 and then I there is money in the
[17:05] building fund
[17:07] Uh I I transfer money back and forth
[17:10] between the general fund and the
[17:12] building fund uh to keep that building
[17:15] fund account open. And there's a about
[17:20] $1,096 in the building fund. So that's
[17:23] where we're at this morning finance-wise
[17:26] for the church. Uh there are some
[17:29] issues, but they're just little issues
[17:30] that got to be taken care of. But I was
[17:34] um reading this morning in this 10th
[17:37] chapter. I I wrote some notes to myself
[17:40] and I'll read these first 10 verses and
[17:43] then then go back. But something really
[17:46] struck me before I go in there.
[17:48] Something really str I don't want you to
[17:50] raise your hand, but I know everyone
[17:52] here has probably read their Bible cover
[17:54] to cover 10, 15, 20, some the older
[17:58] people maybe 100, 200 times. I'm sure
[18:01] people here have read the gospels,
[18:03] studied the gospels multiple times, have
[18:06] gone through the New and Old Testament.
[18:09] So I would ask you as Bible believers,
[18:12] you you should know the word of God. So
[18:15] what really struck me when I heard it
[18:18] today is the man across the water there,
[18:21] he spends the last month in a hospital,
[18:24] millions of dollars of health care to
[18:27] keep him alive. And the first thing he
[18:30] says coming out of his coma is he
[18:33] condemns the United States and our
[18:35] immigration policy. And I say to myself,
[18:37] if you know your Bible cover to cover,
[18:40] wearing your Bible does it tell you that
[18:43] it's wrong for our country to control
[18:45] their waters. And I'm not getting
[18:47] political here, but my point being, the
[18:49] Bible tells you that that man is a false
[18:52] prophet. And if you don't know your word
[18:54] of God and you don't know your Bible,
[18:57] you it's easily to hear people say
[19:00] things and know there's no truth to it.
[19:02] You have to know the word of God for the
[19:04] hour that we live in this morning
[19:06] because it's so easily to to be misled.
[19:09] And I thought it was funny. He spends a
[19:11] month almost dead and the first thing he
[19:14] does is complain about immigration. It
[19:16] just makes no sense. you would figure
[19:18] he'd be grateful that God kept him alive
[19:21] and wanted to get closer to the cross
[19:23] instead of making political statements.
[19:25] It just struck me this morning and uh
[19:28] I'll just read these 10 verses, not
[19:30] getting political, but it's really
[19:31] important that you read your Bible every
[19:34] day and you know the word of God and for
[19:36] what it says. And you'll find out that a
[19:39] lot of things that they put push out
[19:41] there on the street, you can't bring
[19:43] them through the word of God. They will
[19:44] not come through God's word. A lot of
[19:47] this stuff that goes on out there, you
[19:49] can't bring it through God's word. It
[19:51] can't come through the other side. And
[19:53] it's really important that you know
[19:54] God's word. So you're not I'll just read
[19:57] these first. After these things, the
[20:00] Lord appointed over the other 70 and
[20:03] sent them two by two and two before his
[20:07] face onto every city and place whether
[20:10] he himself would come. So he sent he had
[20:13] already sent out the 12 and twos and now
[20:16] he sends out the 70 in twos and I'll
[20:18] just read a few more verses. Therefore
[20:21] he said he unto them the harvest is
[20:24] truly great and the laborers are fruit
[20:26] excuse me few as I get older. I find
[20:30] it's I don't speak as good as I used to
[20:32] when I was younger. I pray you therefore
[20:34] the Lord of the harvest that he would
[20:36] send forth laborers into his harvest. Go
[20:40] your ways. Behold, I send you forth as
[20:43] lambs among wolves. So that's the way
[20:45] we're supposed to be. You know, when
[20:47] you're talking and dealing with people,
[20:49] you should be you just be nice. You
[20:51] shouldn't try to take over the
[20:53] conversation all the time. Carry neither
[20:56] purse nor script nor shoes, and salute
[20:58] no man by the way. And whatsoever house
[21:01] you enter first, say, "Peace be to this
[21:04] house." And if the son of peace be
[21:07] there, your peace shall rest upon it. If
[21:10] not, you shall turn to you again. And
[21:13] the same house remainth eating and
[21:15] drinking such things as you as they give
[21:17] you. For the laborers worthy of as hire,
[21:20] and you and go not from house to house,
[21:24] and into whatsoever sitter you enter and
[21:26] receive, you eat such things that are
[21:29] set before you. And he goes on, this is
[21:31] the great commission here. Heal the sick
[21:33] that are therein and say unto them, the
[21:35] kingdom of God is nigh unto you. And
[21:38] then he goes, "But on into whatsoever
[21:41] city you enter, and they reserve to you
[21:43] not, go out your way and onto the
[21:46] street, the same say." And uh I'll just
[21:48] finish with this verse. Even the very
[21:50] dust of your city, the very dust of your
[21:53] city, which cleaveth unto us, we do wipe
[21:56] it off against notwithstanding you this,
[21:59] that the kingdom of God has come, and
[22:01] nigh unto you. And I'll finish there.
[22:04] But I was sitting in my office this
[22:06] morning and I was just thinking about us
[22:08] as Christians this morning and we had
[22:13] you you had one person, one cell and
[22:16] that was Jesus Christ himself, the first
[22:18] cell, the pure soul, the the holy cell,
[22:22] the first one. And he splits himself up
[22:24] and gives the tenatively gives the
[22:26] spirit to 12 and they create many. And
[22:30] then he sends out 70 and they create
[22:32] even more. And I was just thinking
[22:34] that's how the church of God's supposed
[22:36] to be this morning. It's supposed to
[22:38] grow. And I
[22:40] anytime you're not in Christ and the
[22:42] spirit of Christ is in you. The if the
[22:44] church isn't growing, there's something
[22:46] wrong. If and I was just not thinking in
[22:49] a physical sense, and it's the same for
[22:51] us this morning as believers. If you're
[22:53] not growing in the gospel of Christ,
[22:56] then there's something wrong. You've got
[22:57] to be growing every day. And the
[23:00] presence of Jesus Christ has got to be
[23:01] greater each day in your heart and in
[23:04] your life. And I was
[23:06] u another things uh I was thinking about
[23:10] this morning. I'll just finish. You
[23:12] could go through this whole ch 10th
[23:14] chapter this morning, but I was also
[23:16] thinking he sent out the 70. He sent out
[23:19] the 12. And then he goes on and then we
[23:22] all know we're getting to Easter again
[23:25] where he offers himself. And then he
[23:27] walks for 40 40 days with his disciples.
[23:31] And then the day of Pentecost comes and
[23:34] he separates himself in the church this
[23:36] morning. So it's not just one person,
[23:38] but it's multiple persons filled with
[23:41] the same person and the same spirit. And
[23:43] I it's really for my own life, I can say
[23:46] that it's really important that that
[23:48] spirit is in your heart and life this
[23:50] morning. And as the things going on out
[23:53] there in the world, I was noticing I
[23:55] don't know why I'm going there, but I
[23:57] was reading also in Daniel and thinking
[23:59] about some stuff this
[24:01] morning when you know that in Daniel the
[24:04] 7th chapter, it talks about those 10
[24:06] kings and then you go to the 13th
[24:08] chapter of Revelation and you see how
[24:11] the whole world is just it's just
[24:14] falling apart out there and there's
[24:17] groups of people now being manifested.
[24:19] And I was just thinking, you know, the
[24:21] European nations are in disarray. The
[24:24] United States is in dis the whole world
[24:26] is in disarray. They're looking for some
[24:28] type of leadership to lead them. And we
[24:31] know from scriptures of what brother
[24:33] Brandham said this morning that they're
[24:35] going to get that leader that they're
[24:36] looking for in a natural sense. And
[24:39] that's not going to be the right leader
[24:40] that they need. What the what the world
[24:43] needs is Jesus Christ being their leader
[24:45] this morning. And you can see everything
[24:47] being tore up. You know, you go back to
[24:50] the 12th chapter of Hebrews. You know,
[24:52] the everything that can be shaken will
[24:54] be shaken. And that's what's going out.
[24:56] But as I look at the European nations,
[24:59] they're coming to a point where they're
[25:00] exerting their what they think about
[25:03] life and what they think about the
[25:05] world. And I think of our own country. I
[25:07] can see that the world is starting to
[25:09] hate our own country more and more each
[25:12] year. So you could see nukes flying over
[25:14] with no problem at all the way people
[25:16] are this morning. And let me um not go
[25:20] on with I was wanting to go down to
[25:22] about the 17th verse here this morning,
[25:25] but it really I was really thinking
[25:29] that th this is what the uh the voice of
[25:33] God recording yesterday for the uh 22nd
[25:37] and I was listening to the message that
[25:39] this quote comes out to. And you know,
[25:43] we all know that God is love. Anyone
[25:46] that is part of God will have love. I'll
[25:48] just read what brother Brandham had to
[25:50] say uh and not go go off point here. And
[25:54] this is uh this comes out of the message
[25:56] perfect faith. I listened to it a couple
[25:58] of times and we everyone here has to
[26:02] accept the fact we're all sinners saved
[26:04] by grace. So we start here and when and
[26:07] when we were sinners alated without God
[26:10] we all were that way one time. Some of
[26:13] us have our hard head sometime. Some of
[26:15] us, it takes a lot more knocks for us to
[26:18] realize who we really are. Some people
[26:19] don't take a lot of knocks. They simply
[26:22] accept it. In the world in the muck of
[26:25] of mud, the muck of mud, as I talked
[26:27] about this morning, God come to us. God
[26:30] sought you. And I I got to raise my
[26:32] hand. I I know that God sought me
[26:34] because I wasn't looking for him, but he
[26:36] found me. You never You never sought
[26:39] God. No man can come to me except the
[26:41] father draws him first. And God came
[26:44] down in the muck, you know, and that's a
[26:46] precious thing to me to know that God
[26:49] loved me enough to spend my young life
[26:52] knocking at my door continually when I
[26:54] did wrong to let me know that there's
[26:56] something better. And it's the same with
[26:58] all of us this morning. What you were
[27:01] sought you out brought you out. And then
[27:03] when you realize that God brought you
[27:05] out, you have that personal
[27:08] relationship. You know that you couldn't
[27:10] do it yourself. you know that God led
[27:13] you to it. So, it gives you that
[27:14] humility to know that you're you really
[27:18] there's no big eyes in God's church.
[27:20] It's just little me all part of one
[27:22] body. And he goes, God came down into
[27:25] the muck what you were and sought you
[27:27] out and brought you out. That ought to
[27:29] create perfect love. And that's what
[27:31] goes to what this chapter speaking I was
[27:34] speaking about that that's what we all
[27:36] need this morning. the as the world gets
[27:38] eier evil as it gets madder at you you
[27:42] go out there and you deal with people
[27:44] out there in the world it doesn't take
[27:46] anything to get people's anger and get
[27:48] their just just ruffle them a little bit
[27:51] and you really see who they are and then
[27:54] I lost my place I hope I don't re
[27:56] brought you out that ought to create
[27:58] perfect love look at what what you was
[28:01] and look at what you are and that's
[28:03] really
[28:05] important am I the same person I was 40
[28:08] years ago. I hope not. And that's the
[28:10] way the Christian has to look deep
[28:12] inside themselves to make sure that the
[28:15] person you are today wasn't the person
[28:17] you are yesterday. That God has made you
[28:19] better today than you were yesterday.
[28:21] And he goes on to say with this, what
[28:23] did that somebody that loves you? Can't
[28:26] you have faith in what he promised you
[28:28] then? Real genuine love will create
[28:31] confidence in his word. And I was
[28:33] thinking this
[28:35] morning, without knowing the word of God
[28:38] and not having that presence in your
[28:41] life, you'd be a pretty miserable
[28:44] experience. I'll just finish with this.
[28:48] Um, at the end of this chapter, they
[28:50] talk about this Pharisee and the and the
[28:53] good Samaritan not wanting to take a lot
[28:55] of time this
[28:58] morning. And I was thinking about the
[29:00] good I'll just read it. It's I'm not
[29:02] it's not a lot of verses and I'll sit
[29:04] down after this. And we're in that time
[29:07] right now. Jesus answered the lawyer
[29:10] stood up and try to justify himself. He
[29:14] w he asked Jesus's question who's my
[29:17] neighbor and we all know who our
[29:19] neighbor is. But Jesus replies to him
[29:21] that Jesus answered and said, "A certain
[29:24] man went down to Jerusalem to Jericho
[29:27] and fell among the thieves which
[29:29] stripped him of his raignment, wounded
[29:31] him, departed, leaving him half dead."
[29:33] Well, there's a lot of people out in the
[29:35] world that do that to you spiritually if
[29:37] you're not careful. And by chance, there
[29:39] came down a certain priest that way, and
[29:42] when he saw him, he passed by the other
[29:44] side. You know, we can do that ourselves
[29:46] sometimes. And likewise a Levite when he
[29:49] was at the place came and looked upon
[29:51] him and passed by the other side. And
[29:54] then a Samaritan as he journeyed came
[29:56] where he was. And when he saw him he had
[29:58] compassion on him. So that's what this
[30:01] is who we need to be here. And he went
[30:03] to him and bound up his wounds pouring
[30:05] oil and wine and and set him on a beast
[30:09] and brought him to the end and took care
[30:11] of him. So you got to think of the
[30:13] Samaritan also.
[30:15] How did he know that the thieves
[30:17] wouldn't do the same thing to him? Shows
[30:19] courage in his ability that he didn't
[30:21] think about the circumstances. He just
[30:23] took care of the man. And he goes on to
[30:25] say, "And on the tomorrow, when he
[30:26] departed, he took out two pants and gave
[30:29] it to the host, and said unto them, take
[30:31] care of him. And whatsoever thou
[30:34] spendest more when I come again, I will
[30:37] repay thee." Which now of these three
[30:40] thinkst thou was the neighbor unto whom
[30:42] that fell among the thieves? And of
[30:44] course, we know what the man said. He
[30:46] said, "He that showed mercy on him," and
[30:49] then Jesus said to him, "Go and do thy,
[30:53] excuse me, go and do thy likewise." And
[30:56] I was
[30:57] thinking, I would assume that's what
[31:00] God's speaking to me this morning. As he
[31:02] showed me mercy without making a lot, as
[31:06] God has showed me mercy, as he's given
[31:08] me grace in my life, I've got to turn
[31:11] around and do the same thing to others.
[31:14] this, you know, the thing about a
[31:16] Christian life or the Christian
[31:19] experience, I guess the best way to say
[31:21] it is you, it when it's given to you,
[31:24] you got to give it out. You can't hoard
[31:25] it. Whatever blessings God's given you,
[31:28] God wants you to give out those
[31:29] blessings. It's not a hoarding type of
[31:32] religion where you where you hoard
[31:34] everything to yourself and you don't
[31:35] ever give anything out. So, as God
[31:38] blesses us, I think we need to bless
[31:40] others this morning. Brother David,
[31:49] let's stand if we could
[31:51] and appreciate that this morning,
[31:53] Brother Brian. God bless you. And it's
[31:55] good to be in the house of the Lord,
[31:56] isn't it? Amen. You know, Brother John
[32:00] Lefontaine used to say, "I'd rather be
[32:02] here than the best hospital." Well, the
[32:04] last couple weeks I've had my stay in it
[32:07] with Jan. And I thought I always chuckle
[32:09] when I think about that. I thought, Lord

[43:10] higher ground. And said, Lord, and then
[43:12] I begin to hear the prophet. He talked
[43:14] about the eagle. And brother Brad, I
[43:16] watched a video the other day of a
[43:18] eagle. They returned him to freedom.
[43:21] Watched him get out and walk around. And
[43:24] guess what he started doing? He set
[43:26] those wings after he started flying. He
[43:28] was gone. And of course, they all
[43:30] started clapping their hands. And I
[43:31] thought, Lord, I want to be like that

[43:35] my wings and just fly out of here
[43:37] someday. Amen. Well, I'm pressing

[1:00:21] feel Lord you've laid upon my heart to
[1:00:22] speak Lord you just speak it just the
[1:00:25] way you want Father this morning and be
[1:00:27] with the ears of the hearers Lord Jesus
[1:00:29] we know that there is nothing as
[1:00:31] powerful as your word because you you
[1:00:34] said that the word of God is quick it's
[1:00:36] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[1:00:38] sword piercing even to dividing us under
[1:00:40] of soul and spirit and it is a discerner
[1:00:43] of the thoughts and in the intents of
[1:00:45] heart, Lord, and you're the same
[1:00:47] yesterday, today, and forever. And we
[1:00:49] just desire that you'll have your way
[1:00:51] and bless all those prayer requests that
[1:00:53] have been mentioned. Once again, we lift
[1:00:55] them before you and believe God that
[1:00:57] you'll answer those prayers in Jesus
[1:00:59] name. Amen. And amen. I want to continue
[1:01:03] on with our thought pretty much on
[1:01:05] Wednesday because I certainly didn't get
[1:01:07] done. There was this there were several
[1:01:10] areas that I did not cover. Amen. And so
[1:01:13] I want to with the help of the Lord,
[1:01:15] Amen, just kind of Amen. kind of go down
[1:01:18] a couple more roads that I wanted to go.
[1:01:21] Amen. We're talking of course about
[1:01:23] eagle food. Amen. Amen. Just to recap a
[1:01:26] little bit. Talking about the eagle age.
[1:01:29] I won't go back and read it again over
[1:01:31] in Revelations how that there was a four
[1:01:33] beasts in that right before the throne.
[1:01:35] I believe one of them was the lion, the
[1:01:37] other one was the ox, the other one was
[1:01:39] the face of a man. And of course, the
[1:01:41] last power was a flying eagle. Amen. And
[1:01:45] we kind of started these series with
[1:01:47] Amen. called to fly or something like
[1:01:49] that. Ain't that right? Amen. Has God
[1:01:52] has called us to a higher calling. Amen.
[1:01:55] Amen. And we got to talking a little bit
[1:01:57] Wednesday talking about how that at the
[1:01:59] turn of the century around not this
[1:02:01] century. I guess we're already in
[1:02:03] another century, but back in the 19th
[1:02:05] century, Amen. late 1800s, early 1900s.
[1:02:09] Amen. uh all of humanity took a turn and
[1:02:12] I called it the beginning of the end.
[1:02:14] But I was sitting back there and I
[1:02:16] thought, you know, there's another part
[1:02:17] of that. Amen. And and uh and the other
[1:02:20] half of that there's the beginning of
[1:02:22] the end. And there's the beginning for
[1:02:24] the believer, it's the beginning of the
[1:02:26] beginning. Amen. Ain't that right?
[1:02:28] Because brother Bram said, you know,
[1:02:30] that we are going back to Eden as fast
[1:02:32] and as hard as we can. So we're going
[1:02:35] back to the beginning. Amen. And God is
[1:02:36] preparing us. God is preparing a people
[1:02:39] getting ready to go back to Eden. Amen.
[1:02:43] In the most evil age that there is, the
[1:02:45] most wicked, the most
[1:02:48] deceitful. Amen.
[1:02:51] Where there'll be millions and billions
[1:02:54] of people that think they're a Christian
[1:02:56] and that they think they're going to
[1:02:57] make it and they're not going to make
[1:02:59] it. Amen. And the Bible for that is the
[1:03:02] scripture for that is many will come
[1:03:04] into me that day say haven't we cast out
[1:03:07] devils in your name? Haven't we done all
[1:03:09] these many mighty works and he'll say
[1:03:11] depart from me. I never knew you. So we
[1:03:14] know that that is a very deceptive world
[1:03:16] we're living in. We're we're living in a
[1:03:18] in a very dangerous hello world.
[1:03:23] We're living in a very cruel and mean
[1:03:27] world.
[1:03:29] Amen. In a world where a person like
[1:03:31] Hitler could destroy men, women, and
[1:03:35] babies and children, unmercifully kill
[1:03:39] them. Ain't that right? And uh before
[1:03:44] that, it was the Roman Empire that did
[1:03:46] it for for thousands of years, so to
[1:03:48] speak, down through the dark ages. They
[1:03:51] burned them at the stake. Y'all have
[1:03:53] heard the stories how pregnant women,
[1:03:55] they'd cut them open, take their babies
[1:03:56] out, and do all kinds of things that
[1:03:58] were just
[1:04:00] completely unimaginable. And that's the
[1:04:03] world that you and I are living in.
[1:04:05] Isn't that right?
[1:04:07] And certainly are living in a Satan's
[1:04:10] Eden right now. Ain't that right? We're
[1:04:12] living in Satan's Eden. Amen. But God
[1:04:15] seen fit. Aren't you glad that God said
[1:04:18] that he's going to send you Malachi 4
[1:04:20] before the coming of the great and
[1:04:21] dreadful day of the Lord and he'll turn
[1:04:24] the children back to the fathers. Isn't
[1:04:26] that right? Least I come and smite the
[1:04:29] earth with a curse. If it wouldn't have
[1:04:30] been for the message of the hour, this
[1:04:32] place would already be cursed by
[1:04:34] almighty God.
[1:04:37] Can we say the only reason that the
[1:04:38] nukes haven't come? The only reason we
[1:04:41] haven't, the world hasn't seen the nukes
[1:04:43] is because of his little bride that's on
[1:04:45] the earth this morning.
[1:04:47] That's the only
[1:04:48] reason because he's coming. Amen.
[1:04:52] Gorbachev, not Gorbachev. I'm way late.
[1:04:56] Putin come back in Gorbachov's days.
[1:05:00] Putin. Amen. I'm He's ordained. That's
[1:05:03] right. Ordained. I believe Brother B.
[1:05:05] They've got on our number. We've got one
[1:05:08] of their nukes numbers. And so does the
[1:05:10] Pope of Rome. So does Rome. One day, one
[1:05:12] hour, the Bible says he's going to be
[1:05:14] burnt with fire.
[1:05:16] Amen. So those are my opening
[1:05:18] statements. Did I scare you to death?
[1:05:20] Amen. God bless you this morning. We
[1:05:22] just want to Amen. Uh turn if you
[1:05:25] Bibles. We won't keep you standing too
[1:05:27] long. Let's go. Amen. This morning. And
[1:05:30] do you have that title up? Do you have
[1:05:32] that title for us or No. I want to talk
[1:05:36] about heaven's door and hell's gates.
[1:05:40] Heaven's doors and hell's gates. If
[1:05:42] you'll notice, there's one door, but
[1:05:45] hell has gates.
[1:05:47] Isn't that right? Many, many other ways
[1:05:50] it leads to destruction. Ain't that
[1:05:52] right? But there's one way to heaven.
[1:05:55] There's one door that leads to heaven.
[1:05:58] Amen. St. John, if you will, St. John.
[1:06:02] Then over in Revelations 3
[1:06:04] also actually let's begin with uh
[1:06:08] Matthew. Go to Matthew 16. We'll talk
[1:06:10] about hell's gates
[1:06:15] first. Matthew
[1:06:24] 16 and
[1:06:29] verse 16. And Simon Peter answered and
[1:06:32] said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of
[1:06:35] the living God." And Jesus answers and
[1:06:38] said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon
[1:06:40] Barjonah, for flesh and blood has not
[1:06:43] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[1:06:46] which is in heaven." And I say unto you,
[1:06:49] that thou art Peter, and upon this rock
[1:06:51] I will build my church, and the gates of
[1:06:53] hell shall not prevail against it. and I
[1:06:57] will give you the keys to the kingdom of
[1:06:59] heaven. Amen. Ain't that something? Must
[1:07:02] be a door. If there's keys involved,
[1:07:04] that right? Must be a door
[1:07:06] somewhere. That's
[1:07:09] right.
[1:07:10] Amen. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[1:07:13] earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[1:07:14] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:07:16] shall be loosed in heaven. St. John 10.
[1:07:20] St. John 10.
[1:07:33] Verse one, verily, verily, I say unto
[1:07:36] you, he that enterth not by the door
[1:07:38] into the sheepfold fold, but climbth up
[1:07:41] some other way, the same is a thief and
[1:07:44] a robber. Down in verse seven, it says,
[1:07:46] "And then said Jesus unto them again,
[1:07:48] verily I say unto you, I am the door of
[1:07:53] the sheep." Amen. Verse nine, "I am the
[1:07:56] door. By me, if any man enter in, he
[1:07:59] shall be saved and shall go in and out
[1:08:01] and find pasture. The thief cometh not,
[1:08:04] but for to steal and to kill and to
[1:08:06] destroy. I am come that they might have
[1:08:08] life, and that they might have it more
[1:08:12] abundantly." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:14] Ain't that a wonderful scriptures?
[1:08:16] Revelations 3 and verse Revelations
[1:08:22] 3 and verse
[1:08:27] 15. I know thy works that thou art
[1:08:30] neither cold nor hot. I would that thou
[1:08:32] art cold nor hot. So then because thou
[1:08:34] art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
[1:08:35] I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[1:08:38] Because thou sayest, I am rich and
[1:08:39] increased with goods and have need of
[1:08:41] nothing. and knowest not that thou art
[1:08:43] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:08:45] blind and naked. I counsel thee to buy
[1:08:48] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:08:50] mayest be rich and white raignment and
[1:08:51] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:08:53] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:08:56] anoint thine eyes with eyes that thou
[1:08:58] mayest see as many as I love. I rebuke
[1:09:01] and chasten. Be zealous therefore and
[1:09:03] repent. Behold, I stand at the door and
[1:09:06] knock. And if any hearing man hear my
[1:09:08] voice and open the door, I will come
[1:09:10] into him and will set him and he with
[1:09:13] me. May God add his blessings to the
[1:09:15] word this morning. You can be seated.
[1:09:17] Amen. Praise the
[1:09:19] Lord. This is going to be kind of a
[1:09:22] doctrinal message this morning. Amen. I
[1:09:26] prayed about kind of which way to go
[1:09:28] because we know that brother Brandon
[1:09:30] preached a message called Doors Indoor.
[1:09:32] Ain't that right? Maybe we'll take that
[1:09:34] Wednesday. I don't know for sure but
[1:09:36] doors in door and he talks about e each
[1:09:39] one of us as an individual. Ain't that
[1:09:41] right? How that we have to let the god
[1:09:44] come into our heart. We let him in but
[1:09:46] then when he comes in it's like having
[1:09:49] uh invited somebody into your house.
[1:09:51] It's just one room that he comes into at
[1:09:53] first but there's many doors and he
[1:09:56] actually called it doors in door. Amen.
[1:09:58] Amen. Within that one door are many
[1:10:00] doors. And I don't want to go down that
[1:10:02] way but amen. I just want to uh more
[1:10:04] think about the door that God has opened
[1:10:07] up in our generation. Is that right?
[1:10:09] Amen. A door that God has opened up in
[1:10:12] our generation. And I believe it's over
[1:10:14] in Revelations and it would have been in
[1:10:16] the prior church age, the second to the
[1:10:19] last. I mean, yeah, the the it was
[1:10:21] actually the Philadelphiaian church age.
[1:10:24] Amen. that he writes to the to that
[1:10:26] church and he says to the angel of the
[1:10:28] Philadelphiaians, write these things
[1:10:30] saith he that is holy, he that is true,
[1:10:33] and he that hath the key of David, he
[1:10:35] that openeth and no man shutth and
[1:10:38] shutth and no man openeth. Amen. Praise
[1:10:41] the Lord. Amen. I know thy works.
[1:10:44] Behold, I have set before thee an open
[1:10:47] door, an open door, and no man can shut
[1:10:50] it. For thou has a little strength and
[1:10:53] has kept my word and has not denied my
[1:10:56] name. Amen. I'm not going to take the
[1:10:58] time to go into it. I had it looked up
[1:10:59] and studied it where brother Brandham
[1:11:01] took that very phrase and he talked
[1:11:03] about that he was talking about that
[1:11:04] door that was put before him. Amen.
[1:11:07] Would be which would lap over into the
[1:11:09] Lelaya age and how that God would open
[1:11:11] up. Amen. Our understanding of the
[1:11:14] Godhead. Ain't that right? The
[1:11:17] understanding of who really is God.
[1:11:20] Amen. And who really is the door? Ain't
[1:11:23] that right? Amen. So we would understand
[1:11:26] that it's not in a church, not in an
[1:11:30] individual. No salvation in a church
[1:11:32] anywhere. Only one place that you can
[1:11:35] enter in and that is by Jesus Christ. He
[1:11:39] is that door and that door opens. And he
[1:11:42] says because of our understanding and
[1:11:44] the name even in the restoration of the
[1:11:46] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Because we
[1:11:49] know that there is power in the name of
[1:11:52] Jesus. Ain't that right? Amen. And not
[1:11:54] in the titles of father, son, and holy
[1:11:56] ghost. Because brother Brandham had
[1:11:57] witch doctors in the name of father,
[1:11:58] son, and the holy ghost. Isn't that
[1:12:00] right? How did all of not in? But
[1:12:03] anyway, I don't think they used the
[1:12:04] father, son, and holy ghost. They might
[1:12:06] have. I don't remember. But anyway, they
[1:12:07] lifted this table up. Isn't that right?
[1:12:09] And brother Brandham said, "In the name
[1:12:10] of the father, son, the holy ghost, come
[1:12:12] down." And it didn't do nothing.
[1:12:15] God really doesn't have to honor people,
[1:12:18] amen, with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:20] today. Amen. If you baptize in the
[1:12:23] titles of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:12:25] Now, we know that God did bless the
[1:12:27] previous churches. Brother Brandham said
[1:12:28] they did. He winked at the ignorance of
[1:12:31] Luther and Wesley when you don't know.
[1:12:32] God sometimes winks at your ignorance
[1:12:35] and he'll bless you anyway. But once you
[1:12:37] know, and once the truth has been
[1:12:39] brought out, Amen. The truth is
[1:12:42] presented to you. It puts you in a whole
[1:12:44] different ballgame, a whole different
[1:12:46] feel. Now you've rejected the truth.
[1:12:49] Amen. And you come under the
[1:12:51] condemnation of
[1:12:52] rejection. Amen. And so God don't bless
[1:12:55] that. No. Huh. Now you have to once
[1:12:58] you're faced with the truth, Amen. You
[1:13:00] have to either accept it or you have to
[1:13:02] reject it. And I'm thankfully that God
[1:13:04] has opened it up to us. open these
[1:13:07] things up to us so that we could have
[1:13:09] the power, the full power in the name of
[1:13:12] Jesus. Because when he said in the name
[1:13:14] of Jesus Christ, he might have even used
[1:13:16] his own name in the name of William
[1:13:17] Brandom. It didn't come down. There's no
[1:13:19] power in the name of William Brandom.
[1:13:20] There's only one place that there is
[1:13:22] true power and that is in the name of
[1:13:24] the Lord Jesus
[1:13:27] Christ. Amen.
[1:13:30] Praise be to God. Whatever you do in
[1:13:32] word and do all in the name of Jesus
[1:13:34] Christ. Amen. So I got to looking at
[1:13:36] that and so praise the Lord. Let me
[1:13:38] recap a little bit before we get going.
[1:13:40] Is that okay? And I said Wednesday how
[1:13:42] that God told Brother Brandham, he said
[1:13:44] to take those tapes, stay here. Amen.
[1:13:47] And store up food. Isn't that right? Go
[1:13:49] back and store up food. And where is
[1:13:51] that storehouse? The tabernacle. And
[1:13:54] here's where the food has been stored
[1:13:56] up. Talked about the message that he
[1:13:58] preached. Six hours long. Amen. And so
[1:14:00] forth. He says, "And it's been stored up
[1:14:02] here. These tapes will go worldwide. One
[1:14:04] of these tapes where people in their
[1:14:06] houses, them tapes will fall right into
[1:14:08] the hands of the predestinated seed of
[1:14:10] God. Amen. He can direct that word.
[1:14:13] He'll direct everything just exactly to
[1:14:15] its course. That's the reason he sent me
[1:14:17] back to do this to store up food. How
[1:14:19] many believe that we are eating on ego's
[1:14:22] food? Amen. And I believe that. I truly
[1:14:24] believe with all of my heart because of
[1:14:26] the eagle food, it's the last power.
[1:14:28] It's the last force. Amen. It's going to
[1:14:30] translate our very body. The food that
[1:14:33] we eat here. Amen. It's going to
[1:14:35] transform our very body. Why? Because if
[1:14:38] we believe the message that God has
[1:14:39] sent, the prophet God said that one of
[1:14:41] these mornings, Amen, the Holy Spirit
[1:14:43] will come down. He'll sweep over and
[1:14:44] you'll feel some weird sensation or
[1:14:46] whatever. You'll be changed in the very
[1:14:48] Adams. I believe that word. If you
[1:14:51] believe that word, then you're going to
[1:14:53] be part of Amen. Those who are changed
[1:14:55] in the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:14:57] eye, the trump of God shall sound and
[1:14:59] the dead shall cry shall rise first. And
[1:15:01] we which are alive and reign shall not
[1:15:03] prevent them that are asleep. How many
[1:15:06] believes that's going to happen?
[1:15:08] That's going to be the ultimate result
[1:15:10] of Malachi 4. I will send you Malachi 4
[1:15:14] to restore you back to the original
[1:15:16] faith in the fathers.
[1:15:18] This message, this food that we're
[1:15:20] eating is a message of restoration
[1:15:23] to take us back to the way that Paul
[1:15:26] preached it. How many believe that
[1:15:28] brother Brand preached just what Paul
[1:15:30] preached? He took out all denominations.
[1:15:33] That's why a denomination many times
[1:15:35] said he's out because it's man-made
[1:15:37] creeds and dogmas and all of that mixed
[1:15:39] in it.
[1:15:43] And you can't have all of that now and
[1:15:46] expect to go in the rapture.
[1:15:48] Amen.
[1:15:50] It's
[1:15:52] amazing.
[1:15:54] Amazing the depth of what God has done
[1:15:58] in our day.
[1:16:00] Amen.
[1:16:04] People claim to know Jesus, claim to
[1:16:07] believe Jesus, but when you try to tell
[1:16:08] them what Jesus did in our day, they
[1:16:10] don't want anything to do with it.
[1:16:12] Right. They don't want anything to do
[1:16:14] with it.
[1:16:16] And it goes to show you what they would
[1:16:17] have done back there.
[1:16:20] Amen. I don't know which message it was,
[1:16:23] but boy, when brother Brandon blasted
[1:16:26] Leos here, y'all remember that taste is
[1:16:28] blind Leona. Brother Brandon means like
[1:16:32] he comes right to you and you can't even
[1:16:34] accept him. It just really got to him.
[1:16:36] That's right. He screamed blind Leona.
[1:16:39] Why? Because that revelation that's the
[1:16:41] condition that the church in our age was
[1:16:44] and is
[1:16:46] wretched, miserable, poor, blind, very
[1:16:49] religious had him outside of the door.
[1:16:52] The only church age that Christ was
[1:16:55] outside the door and knocking.
[1:17:00] I believe anytime this message is
[1:17:02] preached, this word is preached like
[1:17:04] this, it's Christ knocking at people's
[1:17:06] heart's door, trying to get in.
[1:17:11] I'm so glad I let him in. And it takes a
[1:17:14] leap of faith. You got to be that little
[1:17:16] eagle that takes that leap of faith and
[1:17:18] say, "I believe the message. I believe
[1:17:21] God sent a prophet. I believe it's
[1:17:23] right. It's Christ coming and
[1:17:24] vindicated." Amen. begin to flop your
[1:17:27] wings and come out of that barnyard.
[1:17:29] You've got to leave that barnyard. It
[1:17:31] takes courage to flop your wings.
[1:17:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to pick
[1:17:41] that up again here in a minute. Talking
[1:17:44] about the eagle, the whole
[1:17:46] message is surrounded by the eagle
[1:17:50] story. It all consists of that eagle
[1:17:52] story. And I'll show you even even in
[1:17:55] brother Bam's ministry there 65. I mean
[1:17:59] he'll he'll type it in. But let me let
[1:18:02] me first of all I want to talk about the
[1:18:04] loosing. How that the door of
[1:18:09] hell has opened up. How many believe
[1:18:14] that? Brother Abraham said that the lids
[1:18:17] come off of hell. The lid has come off
[1:18:21] of hell.
[1:18:25] Imagine
[1:18:28] that. And I don't know if y'all have
[1:18:30] heard this about uh Euphrates, the
[1:18:33] Euphrates River drying up and they're
[1:18:37] going to they're claiming that those
[1:18:38] four riders and all those demons are
[1:18:41] going to come out of
[1:18:42] it, you know, and all the things that
[1:18:45] those demons are going to do. We're
[1:18:48] going to go over that here in the next
[1:18:50] 20 minutes. Maybe come before we come
[1:18:52] back to our thought. But there was a
[1:18:55] certain
[1:18:57] loosing. Brother B makes a statement. He
[1:19:00] says, "Brother, the lid has come off of
[1:19:01] hell and streams of demon powers are
[1:19:05] pouring in from everywhere, conquering
[1:19:09] nations,
[1:19:10] politics, churches until they don't know
[1:19:13] anything. But my churches don't teach
[1:19:17] that." Amen. Brother Bam says people
[1:19:20] that'll say, "Well, my church don't
[1:19:22] teach that." Who Who is your lover? Is
[1:19:24] your church your lover or is the word
[1:19:26] your lover? Who are you in love with?
[1:19:30] When you see the truth, but you'd rather
[1:19:32] take what some man said. That's right.
[1:19:36] I want to make another statement over in
[1:19:40] over in Isaiah 14. It said, "How art
[1:19:44] thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son
[1:19:47] of the morning? heart thou cut down to
[1:19:48] the ground which weaken the nations. For
[1:19:51] thou has said in thine heart, I will
[1:19:53] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[1:19:55] throne above the messengers or stars of
[1:19:59] God. So the devil will do anything to
[1:20:02] try to exalt his idea and his thoughts
[1:20:05] above the messengers of God. How many
[1:20:08] knows God has seven stars in his right
[1:20:10] hand? Ain't that right? I will also sit
[1:20:12] upon the mount of the congregation, upon
[1:20:14] the signs of the north. I will ascend
[1:20:16] above the height of the clouds. I will
[1:20:18] be like the most high. That was Satan's
[1:20:24] ambition. Amen. That was Satan's
[1:20:27] ambition. In 2 Thessalonians also in the
[1:20:30] second chapter verse three, it says,
[1:20:32] "Let no man deceive you by any means and
[1:20:34] that day shall not come except there
[1:20:35] come a falling away first and that man
[1:20:37] of sin be revealed the son of pardon who
[1:20:42] opposes and exaltth himself." Notice two
[1:20:44] words. He opposes. He's against the
[1:20:47] truth.
[1:20:52] Oh my folks. I don't care if you're in
[1:20:54] the message. You got to be careful
[1:20:56] whether you're opposing one another or
[1:20:57] not. If you are an opposing person, that
[1:21:01] means you are not on the s not on the
[1:21:02] same mind level. You're not in unity
[1:21:05] with that person. you oppose that person
[1:21:08] and you're either right or you're wrong
[1:21:13] because you're exalting yourself. You
[1:21:16] exalted himself above all that is called
[1:21:18] God so that he is worshiped so that God
[1:21:20] he is he as God siteth in the temple of
[1:21:22] God showing himself that he is God.
[1:21:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:30] Let me see
[1:21:35] here. Listen. Brother Bams makes a
[1:21:37] statement. Now notice that when the
[1:21:39] church world, he's talking about this
[1:21:41] church world nowadays. Amen. When they
[1:21:43] would not have the word of God to rule
[1:21:45] over them, they accepted a murderer,
[1:21:48] Barabus, when they did this and it
[1:21:51] exalted Satan, the god of this evil age,
[1:21:54] to the place that he always wanted to
[1:21:57] be. So, it is in our age that the devil
[1:22:01] finally got to be on the throne that he
[1:22:04] wants to be. Now, we know when he's
[1:22:07] really going to be on the throne and
[1:22:08] when he's really going to sit there is
[1:22:10] when the bride goes up and that very
[1:22:13] accuser of the brethren is cast down.
[1:22:15] And it says, "Woe to the inhabitants of
[1:22:17] the earth." Then, "Woe to the remnant of
[1:22:20] the woman's seed. When he comes after
[1:22:21] you, he will hunt you down. He will kill
[1:22:24] you. If you don't belong to him, you
[1:22:26] might be going somewhere to pray for
[1:22:28] somebody and they'll blow your head off.
[1:22:30] That's what the prophet of God said.
[1:22:34] Yeah. He'll know he'll truly
[1:22:42] rule. Didn't mean to go down here, but
[1:22:44] we know
[1:22:46] that that the
[1:22:48] pope Catholics, they hold the gold of
[1:22:52] the world. They're the ones that hold
[1:22:54] the wealth of the world and even they
[1:22:56] will make a pack with Israel in the
[1:22:58] tribulation period. Ain't that right?
[1:23:01] But he will truly completely control the
[1:23:04] wealth of the world. Now you wonder why
[1:23:06] we're into getting the debt that we are
[1:23:08] right. But Bam said somebody's going to
[1:23:11] pay that debt off and whoever pays that
[1:23:13] debt off or who can we say whoever we
[1:23:16] owe that to is who we got to listen to.
[1:23:19] So you see where it's going. But anyway,
[1:23:23] it it was just something how that
[1:23:25] another place he talks about and I
[1:23:27] didn't have time to go into it. I
[1:23:28] believe it was in uh lean not on to your
[1:23:30] own understanding. Amen. When they lean
[1:23:32] to their own understanding, he also
[1:23:33] makes a statement that they have taken
[1:23:36] amen their own ideas and their own lean
[1:23:39] to their own understanding above the
[1:23:42] vindicated and proven word of
[1:23:45] God. And they have exalted the devil to
[1:23:47] where he want it to be.
[1:23:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, back to our
[1:23:55] thought a little bit, back to uh the
[1:23:58] loosing of
[1:24:00] these these demons. And I just want to
[1:24:03] show you that this has already happened.
[1:24:07] These demons that were loosed. I don't
[1:24:09] understand it all. All I can tell you is
[1:24:11] what the prophet said.
[1:24:14] You could talk to a You could talk to
[1:24:17] a college
[1:24:19] professor, Benny Hinn. I don't know.
[1:24:22] Give me some of them great
[1:24:23] men. Give me the Or Roberts, Billy
[1:24:27] Graham. But I'm here to tell you, I'd
[1:24:30] take Brother Bam's word over any of
[1:24:32] them.
[1:24:34] Over any of them.
[1:24:37] Because I want to tell you something
[1:24:38] this right now. And that is Brother Bam
[1:24:41] was the authority. under God.
[1:24:45] Just like Luther was, Wesley was, Paul
[1:24:47] was. Ain't that right? Paul was the same
[1:24:49] way. He said, "Anybody's be spiritual or
[1:24:52] uh you know, whatever, let him
[1:24:53] acknowledge that the things that we
[1:24:54] write unto you are the commandments of
[1:24:56] God."
[1:24:58] Amen. And if any angel come and preach
[1:25:00] anything other than what we preach, but
[1:25:01] that's a pretty that's a direct
[1:25:03] authority under Almighty God. That's
[1:25:05] what our seventh angel's messenger was.
[1:25:08] God was right there with him.
[1:25:11] Oh
[1:25:14] my. Remember all those 70 ministers in
[1:25:17] Chicago that was wanting to challenge
[1:25:19] brother Brandham on his godhead and
[1:25:20] serpent seed and what and water baptism
[1:25:22] and all of that. Isn't that right? They
[1:25:25] wanted to they wanted to uh uh challenge
[1:25:28] him on it or whatever or and there was a
[1:25:30] trap set. The angel said go but go ahead
[1:25:32] I'm with you. I'll be by your side. The
[1:25:35] angel said, "And why do you think that
[1:25:37] the brother man said to any of you that
[1:25:39] think that's wrong, come up here by my
[1:25:41] side
[1:25:44] later?" He said, "They have dropped
[1:25:45] dead."
[1:25:50] That's right. We have seen We had an
[1:25:52] Ananas and Safh, wouldn't we? Why? Oh,
[1:25:55] man. Aren't you? Oh, I'm here to tell
[1:25:57] you, you don't
[1:26:00] realize my Let me help you realize if I
[1:26:04] can. I'm jumping around here,
[1:26:07] but the people of the earth are now
[1:26:09] making their choice. The Holy Spirit is
[1:26:12] here calling out a bride for Christ.
[1:26:15] He's doing it by vindicating the word of
[1:26:18] promise to her age, showing that it is
[1:26:22] Christ. Somebody believes that this
[1:26:24] vindication of what God came and did.
[1:26:26] Amen. Both that picture and all those
[1:26:29] things that God did was infallible.
[1:26:31] Amen. He is picking her out. He's
[1:26:33] choosing her. Amen. By vindicating to
[1:26:36] her what the truth is. How many's glad
[1:26:39] to have a vindicated, proven
[1:26:42] truth. We don't have to go nowhere else.
[1:26:45] We don't have to seek nowhere else.
[1:26:46] We've gotten the vindicated truth where
[1:26:49] Jesus would come down. Amen. Whether it
[1:26:51] was by those 70 ministers or whether it
[1:26:53] was the Hindu and the Muslims and the
[1:26:55] 30,000 he of 50 500,000 he challenged
[1:26:59] the Hindu the Buddha all of those
[1:27:01] priests come up here and open his blind
[1:27:03] man's eyes and we'll serve your
[1:27:05] God. The same challenge Elijah made in
[1:27:08] the Old Testament. Ain't that right?
[1:27:10] Whoever's God answers by fire, let him
[1:27:14] be God. And those false prophets of Baal
[1:27:16] went up there and cut themselves. Amen.
[1:27:18] And this man did everything calling and
[1:27:21] Elijah mocked and said, "Where is he?"
[1:27:23] Maybe he's on vacation. Maybe he's
[1:27:25] sleeping.
[1:27:27] Ain't that right?
[1:27:29] And then he says, "Okay, now we're going
[1:27:31] to see. Now I want you to take some
[1:27:32] water and I want you to douse this thing
[1:27:34] water. I don't I'm sure I'm not even
[1:27:36] sure how many times. Do it again. Do it
[1:27:38] again." Amen. Until everything was just
[1:27:40] gushing wet. He says, "Now let the God
[1:27:43] that is God answer by fire and the fire
[1:27:46] came down. He consumed the altar, it
[1:27:49] consumed everything.
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:55] When brother Bam said, "Come up here and
[1:27:57] open his eyes, man, man's eyes." And
[1:27:59] women, when brother Bam says, "I can't
[1:28:00] do it. I'm just his servant." But if
[1:28:02] Jesus Christ whom I represent will open
[1:28:05] his eyes, will you accept him? Amen.
[1:28:07] when he began to see and they all saw it
[1:28:09] and he saw I want you to understand
[1:28:11] there was an absolute nuclear explosion
[1:28:15] of faith that took place
[1:28:18] a nuclear explosion I call it 30,000 raw
[1:28:23] heathens in that right accepted God
[1:28:26] over in Africa remember when there was a
[1:28:28] nuclear explosion everybody's faith Amen
[1:28:30] just come way up cuz how many knows when
[1:28:33] you see the power of God it opens up a
[1:28:36] door to more
[1:28:38] faith. Paul said v experience spills
[1:28:42] hope. Ain't that right? When you have an
[1:28:44] experience with God, you've seen God do
[1:28:46] it. It gives you faith that he'll do it
[1:28:49] again. God is able.
[1:29:08] Now, let's go where we didn't get to go
[1:29:18] Wednesday. Amen. This widow woman, I
[1:29:20] won't
[1:29:22] This comes to mind, so I'll mention it,
[1:29:23] but it's not the direction I want to go.
[1:29:25] But this widow woman that we're a type
[1:29:27] of that had three square meals a day.
[1:29:30] Ain't that right? That ate good in the
[1:29:33] famine. We could say that brother Bam
[1:29:35] talked about how that the bride of Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ. Amen. This our Elijah not only
[1:29:40] were we a widow, but he also inspoused
[1:29:43] us to a new
[1:29:45] husband. He didn't leave us a
[1:29:48] widow. No.
[1:29:50] No, but he had to first
[1:29:54] proclaim in the invisible union of
[1:29:57] Christ in the bride, he had to proclaim
[1:29:59] and before you can be married again,
[1:30:02] your first husband has to be dead. Ain't
[1:30:04] that right? And listen to this. Brother
[1:30:06] Bam, brother Bam makes a statement.
[1:30:10] He says note so every one of us know
[1:30:14] that the whole rank of denominationals
[1:30:16] Pentecost and all are
[1:30:23] dead. I as a man would never say that
[1:30:26] but he said it. He was the authority of
[1:30:28] God. That's right.
[1:30:31] are dead. And to be born again
[1:30:33] Christians of the message, you have to
[1:30:35] your first husband has to be dead. You
[1:30:39] know that he is dead. So, how many
[1:30:42] knows? That's right. We were married to
[1:30:44] another because Amen. Our first husband,
[1:30:46] we're dead to our
[1:30:48] denomination, to the one that once took
[1:30:50] care of us. They don't take care of us
[1:30:53] anymore. They don't supply for us
[1:30:54] anymore. That thing is dead. In order
[1:30:57] for you to be married to Christ, you've
[1:30:58] got to get rid of that thing completely.
[1:31:00] die completely to that thing. Amen. All
[1:31:03] right, that was just a little thought
[1:31:04] that I didn't get to, but
[1:31:06] listen. Now, let's talk about the
[1:31:08] loosing, the opening up of hell's
[1:31:14] gates. Hell's gates coming loose.
[1:31:18] Demons, streams of demon powers coming
[1:31:21] out where they came from.
[1:31:24] And you know, I want to first say
[1:31:27] this that most of the time when demons
[1:31:31] begin to take any person over or
[1:31:33] anything, it's just in a small way.
[1:31:38] Just in a small way. Brother Bam says,
[1:31:40] you know, just, you know, a little boy
[1:31:42] or something to smoking that corn silk
[1:31:44] or whatever it is out behind the barn.
[1:31:46] Could be a little kid, you know, you
[1:31:48] know, with chocolate all over their
[1:31:50] mouth. No, I didn't take no cookies out
[1:31:52] of the cookie show. Oreo cookies are all
[1:31:54] in their teeth, right? Could be just
[1:31:56] something small, but it goes and goes
[1:31:58] and goes and he said, "Legion," I
[1:31:59] believe he said something about maybe he
[1:32:01] just told his wife a little lie. Came
[1:32:04] home and he was half drunk. She says,
[1:32:06] "Have you been drinking?" "No, I ain't
[1:32:07] been drinking." One after the other
[1:32:09] after the other. Pretty soon it was a
[1:32:11] whole legion. Ain't that right? It
[1:32:13] always starts small but it goes big. But
[1:32:15] bam says the way amen that the devil was
[1:32:18] released in this hour was that songs
[1:32:19] that they used to watch and watch what
[1:32:21] they sing. You know because how many
[1:32:22] knows demons come on music. Demons come
[1:32:25] with music. They come with the words
[1:32:27] that they sing.
[1:32:29] That's right. They come on
[1:32:31] words. And look at where it's at
[1:32:34] today. Look at the rap music and what
[1:32:37] brought what that brought and how far
[1:32:40] it's gone. Look at that. how open how
[1:32:43] did it open up people to just completely
[1:32:46] we know that even uh you know I've I've
[1:32:48] I've um looked at the history and seen
[1:32:51] in history they said that when first
[1:32:53] rock and roll when rock and roll first
[1:32:55] came out murders and rapes and serial
[1:32:59] killers shot to the increase like you
[1:33:02] ain't never
[1:33:03] seen it multiplied. It just kind of
[1:33:06] released. It was a release of demon
[1:33:08] powers.
[1:33:11] Amen.
[1:33:14] Amen. But I want to say, what about you
[1:33:17] and I? How many believes our music that
[1:33:19] we sing? It brings the atmosphere of the
[1:33:22] Holy Ghost. It don't make us murderers
[1:33:25] and everything else. No, it makes us
[1:33:27] sweet and kind and gentle and patient
[1:33:29] and loving. Amen. The words that we
[1:33:32] hear, isn't that right?
[1:33:35] Amen.
[1:33:37] through television and all these things
[1:33:39] has corrupted the nation. Amen. And
[1:33:42] through our vision, vision that we have
[1:33:43] been given. How many knows? Through the
[1:33:45] vision that we have been given, it
[1:33:48] brings us back to God and draws us
[1:33:50] closer to God. How many believe that's
[1:33:52] why it's so important to stay with the
[1:33:54] vision?
[1:33:55] Praise the Lord. Now, let's look at
[1:33:59] these. Let's look at the loosing, the
[1:34:01] opening of it. Brother Bam
[1:34:06] says under the sixth seal, I believe it
[1:34:08] was. Note in Revelations 9, let's just
[1:34:12] read that. Go with me to Revelations
[1:34:18] 9 talking about the gates of hell
[1:34:21] basically right now and how that they've
[1:34:23] opened
[1:34:24] up and what comes forth.
[1:34:29] And I didn't get time to look at it very
[1:34:31] much, but brother Bam said that from
[1:34:33] Hitler, it went into the ecclesiastical
[1:34:36] realms. Those demons went into the
[1:34:38] ecclesiastical realms. Ain't that right?
[1:34:41] And is deceiving the world. And look,
[1:34:43] look, I mean, you don't have to look far
[1:34:45] to see where they're at. But listen,
[1:34:49] Revelations 9 13. I like it the way the
[1:34:52] brother Brandon places it. says, "And
[1:34:55] the sixth angels sounded, and I heard a
[1:34:57] voice from the four horns of the golden
[1:34:59] altar, which is before God, saying to
[1:35:01] the sixth angel which had the trumpet,
[1:35:04] loose." The four angels which are bound
[1:35:06] at the great river Euphrates. And the
[1:35:09] four angels were loosed and were
[1:35:11] prepared for an hour and for a day and a
[1:35:13] month and a year for the slate of third
[1:35:14] part of me men. And the number of the
[1:35:17] army of the horsemen were 200,000
[1:35:19] thousand and a hund and I heard the
[1:35:22] number of them. Brother Abraham says it
[1:35:25] this way. This is what I go by. Under
[1:35:27] the sixth trumpet, he says Revelation 13
[1:35:29] under the sixth trumpet. Note there was
[1:35:31] 200,000 horsemen that had been bound at
[1:35:33] the river Euphrates and was turned loose
[1:35:36] under that sixth trumpet. Now there's
[1:35:38] not 200 horsemen in the world nowhere.
[1:35:41] He says, but it said 200 horsemen. He
[1:35:43] says, "Now notice it wasn't natural
[1:35:45] horses that breathed fire and they had
[1:35:47] breastplates of jasper. They had tails
[1:35:50] and the end of their tail looked like a
[1:35:51] serpent and a snake's head on the end of
[1:35:53] it stinging." Oh my. It was spiritual
[1:35:56] horses, spiritual devils, chargers that
[1:36:00] had been bound at the Euphrates all
[1:36:03] these years. Supernatural devils. What
[1:36:06] was it? The old Roman Empire being
[1:36:09] revived. the persecution of the
[1:36:13] Jews. Hello.
[1:36:16] Isn't it crazy how that a man could have
[1:36:19] his home, a general could have his home
[1:36:22] within seeing distance, almost hearing
[1:36:25] distance of those extermination camps
[1:36:29] and have his two children, his wife, and
[1:36:32] living there like nothing was going on.
[1:36:34] Oh, honey, I'll be back tonight. And go
[1:36:36] out there and kill 10,000 that day. come
[1:36:40] back home. Oh, honey, give me a hug and
[1:36:42] get kiss the kids and take care and then
[1:36:44] go kill the way that he did. Can you
[1:36:47] imagine how devilish
[1:36:50] how? Yeah, it was an absolute devil from
[1:36:53] hell, wasn't it? And not just one, but
[1:36:57] all of those that parttook, whether it
[1:36:59] was guard duty, no matter what it was,
[1:37:01] they all had to be possessed by
[1:37:03] something
[1:37:05] to do such a thing. Amen. That's right.
[1:37:09] Devils of persecution upon the Jews and
[1:37:12] they've been bound for nearly 2,000
[1:37:14] years at the river Euphrates can't cross
[1:37:16] to the promise. A religious sect that
[1:37:18] was trying to get to the other side, you
[1:37:20] know, could come through Eden. They were
[1:37:22] bound there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh
[1:37:26] 200,000 devils of persecution. Notice
[1:37:28] what happens under that sixth trumpet.
[1:37:30] They were loosed upon the Jews. The
[1:37:32] persecution of the Jews. supernatural
[1:37:36] devils nearly 2,000 years waiting then
[1:37:39] loosed by Stalin and Hitler and them
[1:37:42] men. Hello loose by that and we saw the
[1:37:46] effects of it. Then later on he says now
[1:37:48] notice these ecclesiastes devils they're
[1:37:52] riding trying to out everything
[1:37:55] that is right. How did you notice how
[1:37:58] everything that is right is wrong and
[1:38:00] everything that's wrong they want to
[1:38:02] make right?
[1:38:07] Amen. My I mean we are living in a
[1:38:10] twisted up world.
[1:38:13] Twisted up
[1:38:15] world. My but while this group is
[1:38:19] writing making themselves ready to stamp
[1:38:21] out everything that won't agree with
[1:38:23] them. He says there's another group
[1:38:25] being made ready after a while.
[1:38:27] Revelation 19. Next time is the church
[1:38:29] heard of. She comes also not upon
[1:38:32] exactly white horses. The Bible said,
[1:38:33] "But all of the hosts of heaven will
[1:38:35] follow them on a white horse." Listen,
[1:38:37] while this group down here has got
[1:38:41] 2,000 bound at the river Euphrates,
[1:38:44] 2,000 years of being bound, and has been
[1:38:46] bound for 2,000 years. Also, that church
[1:38:50] bound the Holy Spirit for nearly 2,000
[1:38:55] years under martyrdom back there. And
[1:38:58] under the church ages, it's been bound.
[1:39:01] Not at the river Euphrates, but at the
[1:39:04] door of creeds and
[1:39:08] dogmas. Ain't that the right? Oh my. You
[1:39:11] going to some churches and you say amen
[1:39:14] and hallelujah and praise God. You can't
[1:39:17] do
[1:39:17] that. You speak in tongues with them.
[1:39:20] You can't do that. Bound bound the Holy
[1:39:22] Spirit.
[1:39:25] I was thinking, you know, look at the
[1:39:26] freedom that the Holy Spirit has given
[1:39:28] us. We should enjoy the freedom that the
[1:39:32] Holy Spirit has given us.
[1:39:34] Amen.
[1:39:38] Bound the Holy Ghost was
[1:39:41] bound at
[1:39:43] the door of creeds and dogmas. And that
[1:39:46] Holy Spirit can't work in church because
[1:39:48] of man-made
[1:39:51] creeds, man-made systems. But she's
[1:39:54] going to be liberated.
[1:39:57] How many believe that? She's going to be
[1:39:59] liberated. She is coming back. Amen. And
[1:40:03] those two meet again on the
[1:40:05] battlegrounds. Lucifer and Michael
[1:40:08] again. How many believe that we're in
[1:40:11] the greatest battle that has ever been
[1:40:13] fought? Brother Bam said is now about to
[1:40:15] start and God is getting his soldiers
[1:40:18] ready. He's equipping them. He's getting
[1:40:21] us ready. How many know you've got to
[1:40:23] have right frame of mind? You've got to
[1:40:25] have the right soul. Amen. Your heart
[1:40:26] has to be right. Your spirit has to be
[1:40:28] right. You've got to be filled with the
[1:40:30] Holy Ghost, having the shield of faith
[1:40:32] that whatever the devil brings, Amen.
[1:40:34] God is more than able to do it. God is
[1:40:38] getting an army
[1:40:40] ready. I believe I'm looking at that
[1:40:43] army. Amen. That he talked about that
[1:40:46] God is getting ready and we're fighting
[1:40:49] that devil. We're fighting that thing
[1:40:51] that binds us. We're busting that
[1:40:53] chicken cage open. Amen. And we're
[1:40:55] coming out of that chicken pane and
[1:40:57] we're flying into the height like never
[1:41:00] before.
[1:41:04] Woo!
[1:41:07] Glory. I'm imagining myself back in the
[1:41:09] Amish church where I come from the
[1:41:11] Schwarzenber doing that.
[1:41:14] Woo! Man, oh man. You can only imagine
[1:41:20] what it would be like.
[1:41:25] Hallelujah. Think about it
[1:41:27] though. My praise the Lord. You love
[1:41:31] him.
[1:41:33] Amen. So we see how that the devil has
[1:41:38] been loosed. Ain't that right? But he
[1:41:41] promised that the Holy Spirit would also
[1:41:44] be loosed.
[1:41:46] How many believes that there's a loosing
[1:41:49] of the spirit?
[1:41:51] Hallelujah. In the age which we li live
[1:41:54] in, how many believe there's a door of
[1:41:56] science that's been loosed, the door of
[1:41:59] science has been loosed, knowledge shall
[1:42:01] be increased.
[1:42:03] Thank God for Thomas Edison and uh uh a
[1:42:09] and Thomas
[1:42:12] Edison, he was the one that got
[1:42:14] electricity, right? Who else was I
[1:42:17] thinking
[1:42:18] about? And even even the medical world,
[1:42:22] think about the medical world. If you
[1:42:24] got appendix that burst or got infected
[1:42:26] and so forth, you would die.
[1:42:29] Amen. You get a cancer here, cancer
[1:42:31] there, and nowadays if it's in a in a
[1:42:33] tumor form, they can go in there and
[1:42:34] they can take it out. You can live. How
[1:42:37] many glad for the advancements, the open
[1:42:40] doors. Brother Abraham said, "Thank God
[1:42:41] for penicellin. People got to praying
[1:42:43] for cures for these things." And if they
[1:42:45] went to praying, God give it to them.
[1:42:48] I thank God for every open door.
[1:42:53] Every open door.
[1:42:57] You know, we know that in
[1:42:59] uh we know that in uh our personal lives
[1:43:04] sometimes God will close a door.
[1:43:07] Don't get all shook up.
[1:43:10] Don't get all shook up when God closes a
[1:43:12] door. Have faith.
[1:43:15] Ain't that right? God can open another
[1:43:16] door.
[1:43:19] How many knows that God has to open your
[1:43:21] door of faith?
[1:43:23] Now, we know that Christ is the door.
[1:43:24] Jesus is the door. Aren't you glad that
[1:43:27] we had a Malachi 4? He didn't turn us
[1:43:29] back. He didn't point us back to another
[1:43:31] church age. In those tapes, he has a
[1:43:33] thing written there. He says, "I'm not
[1:43:35] here to point you to myself or to make
[1:43:38] another denomination or to start another
[1:43:40] church. I am here to reestablish
[1:43:43] fellowship between God and man.
[1:43:47] In other words, he pointed us to the
[1:43:49] door, the right door. There's all kinds
[1:43:52] of doors out there. But there's only one
[1:43:54] true door that's through Jesus Christ. I
[1:43:58] don't care if you're here at church. I
[1:43:59] don't care if you're driving down the
[1:44:00] road. I don't care where you are. That
[1:44:02] door is available to you. If God knocks
[1:44:05] on your door, it's best to open up and
[1:44:07] say, "Lord, come in and sit with me."
[1:44:11] and me with you.
[1:44:15] I've been eating eating good for 30 some
[1:44:18] years this. Amen.
[1:44:22] Fellowshipping with God.
[1:44:29] Amen. Praise the
[1:44:32] Lord. All right.
[1:44:45] In the age that we're living
[1:44:47] in, we realize that this Leoysia church
[1:44:50] age. Now, let me just go into this for a
[1:44:54] minute. This leodysia church age that
[1:44:57] they had put Christ outside the
[1:44:59] door. They had put him out.
[1:45:02] Can you imagine any
[1:45:04] church that brother Brandon would come
[1:45:07] to town and of course he would preach
[1:45:09] his
[1:45:10] message and he says now how many needs
[1:45:13] prayer a lot of them raise their hands
[1:45:16] you know well now I don't know what's
[1:45:17] wrong with you I don't know but maybe
[1:45:19] hardly anybody here but if you'll come
[1:45:22] and show who he is you know will you
[1:45:25] believe him and he'd say well now you
[1:45:28] know who I'm waiting on
[1:45:30] how many knows there was a supernatural
[1:45:32] being that he was waiting
[1:45:36] on and he had to wait. He couldn't do
[1:45:39] nothing in
[1:45:41] himself. But then the Lord would
[1:45:44] come and around the turn of the century
[1:45:48] when God began to try to express himself
[1:45:50] in that way. He made Malachi 4. He
[1:45:54] created Now this may seem like I'm going
[1:45:56] on a side, but I'll try to pick it back
[1:45:58] up. But he made Malachi 4 in such a way
[1:46:02] because brother Bam says you know he has
[1:46:04] made me in a certain way so that seeing
[1:46:07] these visions here it's like dreaming a
[1:46:10] dream he said
[1:46:12] cuz you can wake up and say man this is
[1:46:14] this is what I saw this is what I
[1:46:16] dreamed he says but I he has put my
[1:46:19] conscience and my subconscious so close
[1:46:23] together he designed brother Brandham in
[1:46:26] such a way that he could stand right
[1:46:27] here look at you sister Sherry tell you
[1:46:30] the secrets of your heart. He would be
[1:46:32] looking at something completely
[1:46:35] different. He would be so to speaking
[1:46:37] but seeing a vision.
[1:46:40] Amen. Now the Pentecostals
[1:46:43] Leosa they still had man-made creeds and
[1:46:46] dogmas in it. Right? And their creed was
[1:46:49] their creed was that it meant the
[1:46:51] evidence of the Holy Ghost and that
[1:46:53] you're saved is if you speak with
[1:46:55] tongues.
[1:46:57] Brother Brandham refuted
[1:47:00] that. And after he preached the seals,
[1:47:02] he says, "It's Antichrist. It's wrong."
[1:47:05] They didn't like it. And after those
[1:47:07] seals, Amen, they turned away from him.
[1:47:09] That's when he was put out. Amen. And
[1:47:11] they would not. And they would say,
[1:47:12] "Look, anybody that'll go to those
[1:47:14] meetings where Jesus is discerning the
[1:47:16] thoughts and intents of the heart, we
[1:47:18] will excommunicate you." Now, they
[1:47:21] didn't say it in that way, but they did
[1:47:22] say that because Amen. Brother Bam said
[1:47:25] he said he had a preacher call him. He
[1:47:26] said, "Now I want there was somebody
[1:47:28] that was at your platform. I'm gonna
[1:47:29] have to put him
[1:47:33] out and he'll be lost." He says, "You
[1:47:36] mean you're a gospel preachers and you
[1:47:38] don't know more about the gospel than
[1:47:39] that?"
[1:47:41] Do you think that just because it's his
[1:47:43] name, not on your book, that he's going
[1:47:44] to be lost?
[1:47:48] Brother Brandon got a little ill with
[1:47:49] him. He says, "Get off the phone,
[1:47:51] mister.
[1:47:54] Get off the phone,
[1:47:56] mister. Why? Because that was ignorance.
[1:47:59] But the thing, that's really what they
[1:48:00] were saying. If you're going to go and
[1:48:02] be where Jesus is doing the very Messa
[1:48:08] sign, we'll pick you out of our church.
[1:48:11] So, you see how they had put Christ out.
[1:48:14] Amen. They had put Christ out. Now how
[1:48:18] many knows it was a great thing on on
[1:48:20] Isuza street the speaking of tongues and
[1:48:22] interpretation of tongues and most of
[1:48:24] the time it is such the lord I'm going
[1:48:26] to come soon or there was sometimes
[1:48:28] specific things said and a lot of time
[1:48:30] no doubt specific things said to certain
[1:48:32] people to do a certain thing ain't that
[1:48:34] right but those speaking in
[1:48:37] tongues were not even close to as great
[1:48:42] as the Messiah sign of
[1:48:46] discernment is that Right.
[1:48:49] I mean, just quoting scriptures or
[1:48:51] whatever, you know, a and if they did it
[1:48:54] right and said, "Hey, brother Troy,
[1:48:55] don't you go to work tomorrow. You stay
[1:48:56] home cuz there's going to be an
[1:48:58] explosion somewhere." Whatever it might
[1:49:00] be, or what, you know, so you don't want
[1:49:02] to be
[1:49:03] there. And you don't. And sure enough,
[1:49:06] wherever you are, don't go down that
[1:49:08] road. There's going to be a crash.
[1:49:10] That's wonderful. That's great. But God
[1:49:12] come down in a greater way and did the
[1:49:14] very same thing that Jesus did on the
[1:49:17] earth. How many knows that we're always
[1:49:18] talking about? Amen. In order to be
[1:49:20] united with Christ, we're going to have
[1:49:22] to be just like him. Ain't that right?
[1:49:24] Ain't that what brother Bham said? And
[1:49:26] he Butter Bam said, look what God is
[1:49:28] doing in his body church today. Amen.
[1:49:30] It's not just in one individual, but he
[1:49:32] did it through the prophet. God was so
[1:49:34] real. It was so much like Jesus. People
[1:49:37] took him to be Jesus. Can we say this
[1:49:40] this morning? Amen. that that the church
[1:49:42] has been and is reflecting that image of
[1:49:45] Jesus Christ like never before
[1:49:49] so close they thought g brother Brandham
[1:49:51] was Jesus because he did the very same
[1:49:54] things and the Bible says the works that
[1:49:55] I do shall you do also and many times
[1:49:57] brother Brandon would say that before
[1:49:59] the discernment now didn't Jesus say
[1:50:00] that the works that we I do shall you do
[1:50:02] also now if he'll come and do that
[1:50:04] you'll know that it's him and then do it
[1:50:06] millions of
[1:50:08] times right do it all millions of times
[1:50:11] and still the church
[1:50:14] world chose to be blind
[1:50:19] out of this whole
[1:50:21] area. You'd have thought the world would
[1:50:24] talk about it. The world would know
[1:50:27] it. Didn't brother Bam said when Jesus
[1:50:29] came I doubt that a very very small
[1:50:32] percentage knew that he was ever even
[1:50:34] here. Didn't even realize that he was
[1:50:37] here.
[1:50:42] Brother Brandham said when he was here,
[1:50:43] he says everywhere now there's no
[1:50:45] revival. Everybody's complaining,
[1:50:47] ministers crying. I read the outstanding
[1:50:50] newspaper that comes here to our church.
[1:50:52] The very fine paper. I know the editor.
[1:50:54] I know the people. They're godly people.
[1:50:57] Brother and sister Moore. Herald of his
[1:51:00] coming. One of the finest papers of the
[1:51:02] field. Herald of is coming. But they
[1:51:04] hardly will permit anything unless it's
[1:51:06] about fast, pray, fast, pray, sound a
[1:51:09] trumpet. How many reads it? You know,
[1:51:11] you see it all the time. Fast pray.
[1:51:13] That's all. That's all you hear. Fast
[1:51:14] pray. We're going to have a great
[1:51:16] breaking of a day. There's a great thing
[1:51:19] going to happen. All of you pray, pray,
[1:51:21] pray. We're not too late to have it yet.
[1:51:24] And what do why do they do that? Why do
[1:51:27] they do that? They want a great
[1:51:29] awakening. They're crying, believing
[1:51:31] that there will be an awakening. They're
[1:51:33] good
[1:51:34] people. Why is it? Why have they done
[1:51:37] it? He says they have not recognized the
[1:51:40] awakening of the bride.
[1:51:43] Amen. They were praying for something
[1:51:45] that was right there. It was happening
[1:51:47] right there and they didn't recognize it
[1:51:49] because it happens so simple.
[1:51:52] Hello. How many know anytime God works,
[1:51:55] you better really stay simple. Look
[1:51:58] simple because he can hide himself like
[1:51:59] you wouldn't believe. They didn't
[1:52:01] recognize the awakening of the minds. So
[1:52:04] I read this and I brought this because I
[1:52:06] mean know that God has opened up a door
[1:52:08] for the bride to come out
[1:52:12] and to come into Christ. She's coming
[1:52:15] awake. They didn't recognize that the
[1:52:18] door has already been
[1:52:20] open. They know something's supposed to
[1:52:22] happen. But see, they're looking for it
[1:52:25] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:52:27] already happened right by you.
[1:52:32] Amen. Brother Brandon, just the other
[1:52:35] day, I was listening to him preach and
[1:52:36] he says, "I'm not looking for a great
[1:52:37] revival. I'm not looking for a revival."
[1:52:40] He says, "I'm looking for the coming of
[1:52:42] the Lord."
[1:52:43] That's what he was looking for. Amen.
[1:52:46] How many is the same? Sure. We're in a
[1:52:48] revival. We're in a constant revival.
[1:52:50] Don't ever let that revival die. We
[1:52:53] ought to be ready and looking for the
[1:52:56] coming of the Lord.
[1:52:58] Praise be to God.
[1:53:01] Hallelujah. Now notice brother Brandham
[1:53:03] also says remember God is an eagle. He
[1:53:06] called himself an eagle and he called
[1:53:09] Jacob an eagle and we are
[1:53:11] eaglets. He calls his prophets eagles
[1:53:14] and his angel came down to expose and to
[1:53:18] call out. Amen. Like my little message
[1:53:21] on the eagle sears her nest and so
[1:53:23] forth. Amen. The old eagle was looking
[1:53:26] for her lost egg. Ain't that right? But
[1:53:30] one day, Mother Eagle found him and she
[1:53:31] screamed, calling him out. Said, "Son,
[1:53:34] you're not one of them. Come out of
[1:53:36] her." Yes, ma'am. What can I do? Said,
[1:53:40] "Flop your wings and start. Just make
[1:53:42] the first jump." And he hit the post.
[1:53:46] Huh? Hit the p post. Didn't quite make
[1:53:48] it out. She said, "Son, you've got to
[1:53:50] come a little higher than that or I
[1:53:51] can't catch you." Amen. Get your feet
[1:53:54] off the ground. She's going to take him
[1:53:56] on a
[1:53:56] flight. and he found out that he could
[1:53:59] fly. She come to call him out.
[1:54:04] Revelations 18, if you want to go with
[1:54:06] me. Now, when brother Brandon preached
[1:54:09] this, why I'm against organized
[1:54:11] religion, he ties this scripture. I
[1:54:14] don't think I have it. I don't know that
[1:54:16] if he does here in this quote or
[1:54:22] not, but I want to show you something.
[1:54:24] Revelations is another
[1:54:27] door. Revelations 18. And I after these
[1:54:30] things, I saw another angel come down
[1:54:31] from heaven having great power and the
[1:54:34] earth was lightened with his glory.
[1:54:39] Now I believe that was brother
[1:54:42] Brandon and I'll show it to you in a
[1:54:45] minute. And he cried mightily with a
[1:54:48] strong voice saying,
[1:54:50] "Babylon is dead or is
[1:54:54] fallen. All this mass
[1:54:56] confusion is
[1:55:00] fallen." Now, how many knows probably
[1:55:03] God said that there was a time when God
[1:55:05] was stealing all those churches because
[1:55:06] they were in their ignorance. They were
[1:55:09] ignorant of it. God dealt with the
[1:55:10] Pentecostals, the Baptist, the Nazarene,
[1:55:13] holiness, and all of that. Isn't that
[1:55:14] right? Sure, brother Brandan would go to
[1:55:16] their meetings. Look at what God did.
[1:55:18] Miracle after miracle after miracle.
[1:55:20] They were still alive. But remember what
[1:55:22] he said, that stalk at the end,
[1:55:25] everything at the very end, the seed
[1:55:27] pulls away and the shuck dries up. It
[1:55:32] has to stay alive until that seed comes
[1:55:34] to maturity. Then it dies and dries off.
[1:55:38] Babylon is fallen is fallen and has
[1:55:40] become the habitation of
[1:55:43] devils. and the hold of every foul
[1:55:46] spirit and the cage of every unclean and
[1:55:48] hateful bird. He refers this group to
[1:55:52] Revelations 3. Amen. Where it says,
[1:55:54] "Ladyia age." Boy, if you don't believe
[1:55:57] like them, they'll hate
[1:55:59] you. Hello. Very
[1:56:02] hateful. All nations have drunk of the
[1:56:04] wine of the wrath of her fornication.
[1:56:06] And the kings of the earth have
[1:56:08] committed fornications with her. And the
[1:56:10] merchants of the earth are w w w w w w w
[1:56:12] w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
[1:56:12] w w w w w w w w w w w w w waxed rich
[1:56:13] through the abundance of her delicacies.
[1:56:15] And I heard another voice from heaven
[1:56:18] say, "Come out of
[1:56:20] her." Now, I was just reading that this
[1:56:22] morning and I really didn't get it until
[1:56:24] he explained it. He says, you know,
[1:56:26] there was a voice on earth that said,
[1:56:28] "Come out of her,
[1:56:31] right?" Amen. And then in verse four, he
[1:56:34] says, "Come out of her, my people, and
[1:56:36] be not partakers of her sins that you
[1:56:38] receive not of her
[1:56:40] plagues." Brother Bam says right here in
[1:56:42] this, just before he begins to explain
[1:56:45] about this cage is where he talk about
[1:56:47] the eagle, the mama calling him out. But
[1:56:50] this mother eagle, this mama, this mama
[1:56:54] Babylon, mother Babylon, how many know
[1:56:57] she was a mother of harlots and
[1:56:59] abominations of the earth?
[1:57:01] any church Methodist and everybody else
[1:57:03] that'll permit
[1:57:06] homosexuality. Brother Bram said for a
[1:57:09] preacher to not for a preacher to uh
[1:57:12] allow women to cut their hair and wear
[1:57:14] makeup, it's a disgrace. Hello. Just for
[1:57:18] a preacher to do that, let alone
[1:57:20] homosexuality and on so forth. That's
[1:57:22] right. Hello. Mother Babylon, it's a got
[1:57:27] got herself a bunch of chickens, slick
[1:57:29] chicks, so to speak, painted up, bobbed,
[1:57:31] tear, called themselves Christian, got a
[1:57:33] cage full of them. And you preacher to
[1:57:35] stand in the pulpit and let them women
[1:57:37] get by with that shame on you just to
[1:57:39] make your denominational more. God would
[1:57:41] require that of your hand. Come out of
[1:57:43] it. My sheep hear my voice. A cage of
[1:57:46] hateful, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[1:57:48] pleasure more than lovers of God. You
[1:57:50] would rather be like that in the world
[1:57:52] than to be like Christ. Then he says, "A
[1:57:55] woman with a lot of makeup on it shows
[1:57:56] she's empty, false inside."
[1:57:59] Next verse. What did this angel say?
[1:58:01] Come out of her. Yes, sir. The angel
[1:58:05] came to the earth and he come to bring
[1:58:08] the
[1:58:09] light. He shine the light around the
[1:58:12] world. He was a mighty angel. He came to
[1:58:16] proclaim the message of come out of
[1:58:19] Babylon. Isn't that our message?
[1:58:22] Touch not her unclean
[1:58:25] things. Got a whole cage full of them.
[1:58:28] Again, he says she's the cage of every
[1:58:31] hateful bird. Yeah, she got a cage full
[1:58:34] of them. Now, the World Council of
[1:58:36] Churches, lodges, brother, you realize
[1:58:38] that there at the end, Brother Bam says
[1:58:39] they're not churches. There's only one
[1:58:42] church that those that are baptized in
[1:58:44] the spirit of the Almighty God. The rest
[1:58:46] of them are all lodges. Exactly right.
[1:58:50] Just come together to promote their
[1:58:52] idea. That's right. That's all it is.
[1:58:55] That's exactly right. We're not here to
[1:58:57] pro promote my idea or brother
[1:58:59] Brandham's idea. We have the idea that
[1:59:02] God brought through Brother Brandham.
[1:59:03] It's God's idea. It's his word that we
[1:59:06] follow. Amen.
[1:59:11] Praise the Lord. They're all coming
[1:59:12] together and become a cage. See? All
[1:59:15] right. Full of hateful birds. Listen.
[1:59:18] And when you join one of them, you've
[1:59:19] also denied the word of God. You don't
[1:59:22] want to do it that way. No place for it
[1:59:24] in the scripture. Now, notice, here's my
[1:59:26] quote in my statement that I made
[1:59:28] earlier to justify. Notice this is the
[1:59:30] angel of light. Remember the last angel.
[1:59:33] It's the angel in the church age to the
[1:59:37] Leodysans. Amen. It's a leadya
[1:59:41] messenger. That's it. Last one. Because
[1:59:44] the very chapter next time is she's
[1:59:46] found. Amen. She comes in Revelations
[1:59:49] 19, which is the coming bride. Amen. The
[1:59:53] last angel that came to bring light
[1:59:54] before the coming of the bride to go
[1:59:57] meet Christ. It was the Leadya church
[2:00:01] age. Then what was this Leodysia church
[2:00:04] age messenger? Calling them out of
[2:00:06] Babylon. church is caught in her
[2:00:11] cage in her
[2:00:13] dogma denying the word and accepting
[2:00:18] dogmas. Can you imagine all the world
[2:00:21] leaders that join up with the pope? Not
[2:00:23] just those leaders, but denominational
[2:00:27] leaders to a pope that would say that
[2:00:30] Jesus's natural life was a complete
[2:00:32] failure. The cross was a complete
[2:00:35] failure.
[2:00:39] Double doors would be swinging for me,
[2:00:41] wouldn't it you, Brother John? I'd be
[2:00:42] out of there. I wouldn't want to get
[2:00:45] struck by
[2:00:47] lightning or whatever he's going to be
[2:00:49] struck by. Amen. My listen what was now
[2:00:54] notice with her dogmas denying the word
[2:00:57] and accepting dogmas. This is the angel
[2:00:59] of light to the leodysia church that had
[2:01:02] rejected Christ and his word for dogma
[2:01:06] and put him outside. He stood at the
[2:01:08] door knocking trying to get in. The
[2:01:10] church age had rejected Christ. Christ
[2:01:13] is the word. Then he says in the next
[2:01:17] paragraph he says what is the fourth
[2:01:18] verse translation? What does it mean?
[2:01:21] God's voice is speaking to his
[2:01:23] predestinated people saying come out of
[2:01:25] her. just exactly what the voice was.
[2:01:29] He's got the people all out in there.
[2:01:32] Amen. How many knows? That's why we
[2:01:34] still reach out to them. Hey, we knock
[2:01:37] at denominations. Come on, repent.
[2:01:39] Repent. Be zealous. Repent. You're
[2:01:42] blind,
[2:01:47] miserable. In closing, I'm going to I'm
[2:01:50] going to I'm going to drop this like a
[2:01:51] hot potato here in a second. Let me
[2:01:53] finish this. Let me finish the quote.
[2:01:55] Listen, he got pill got people all out
[2:01:57] there, all out through Babylon. Come out
[2:01:59] of her that you are not partakers of her
[2:02:02] sins. Amen. Out of that dogma and creeds
[2:02:05] and so forth. And that you receive not
[2:02:07] of her plagues. How many believes that
[2:02:09] if you don't come out of her, you're
[2:02:11] going to be receiving the same plagues,
[2:02:13] all the sinners, homosexuals, and
[2:02:15] everybody else. Amen. God wants you to.
[2:02:17] He wants to save you from those plagues.
[2:02:20] The only way not to receive the plagues
[2:02:21] of Almighty God, that's why brother Bam
[2:02:23] says millions and billions will be
[2:02:25] disappointed. He said about the
[2:02:27] churches, he says the very God that you
[2:02:29] claim to serve is going to destroy you.
[2:02:34] He would never make that statement
[2:02:36] unless they had rejected and he knew
[2:02:38] they had rejected the very one they
[2:02:40] claimed to serve.
[2:02:46] Amen.
[2:02:50] How does that go, Donna? Faith is the
[2:02:53] key that opens the door. Faith is the
[2:02:58] key to the blessings of the
[2:03:01] Lord. Just in closing now, turning
[2:03:04] direction, how many knows that faith is
[2:03:06] a key?
[2:03:08] We are saved by grace through faith, not
[2:03:12] of yourself. And that not of yourself,
[2:03:15] it is a gift of God.
[2:03:18] Brother Sean, aren't you glad for the
[2:03:20] gift of God that he has opened your
[2:03:21] eyes?
[2:03:24] How many know Open the eyes of my heart,
[2:03:26] Lord?
[2:03:28] Folks, you can try to convince people,
[2:03:30] try to convince people and try to
[2:03:31] convince them. You could show them in
[2:03:33] black and white, but unless God opens
[2:03:34] people's eyes, they're not going to
[2:03:36] agree with you.
[2:03:39] They're not going to see it. All you can
[2:03:41] do is present it to them. Well, take it
[2:03:43] or leave it. I'm not going to sit here
[2:03:45] and argue with you, but you try. Isn't
[2:03:47] that right?
[2:03:51] So, if you're saved by grace through
[2:03:53] faith, because we know that you access
[2:03:56] this grace through faith. And if it is a
[2:03:59] gift of God, it is something that God
[2:04:01] has mercy on you. Blessed are your eyes
[2:04:04] for they see
[2:04:07] that we're in the eagle age to see all
[2:04:10] the blessings of God. Amen.
[2:04:19] to have faith for healing. Have faith
[2:04:21] for
[2:04:22] salvation. Have faith for
[2:04:25] whatever you have need
[2:04:30] of. How many believe that
[2:04:34] Jesus is the
[2:04:36] answer to any question, any problem?
[2:04:42] He is the He is the answer to fallen
[2:04:46] humanity. He's the answer and it just
[2:04:49] covers so much. He's the answer to
[2:04:51] everything. When he grants you the faith
[2:04:53] to believe his word, to believe this
[2:04:57] word right
[2:05:02] here. How many believes that the word is
[2:05:04] powerful? Amen.
[2:05:07] How many knows that John 3:16 is a
[2:05:10] pardon written to all of humanity?
[2:05:16] It's written to Cain. It's wr written to
[2:05:19] Judas Issachariat.
[2:05:21] It's written to the sons of the devil.
[2:05:25] It's written to everybody.
[2:05:29] Amen. For God so loved the world that he
[2:05:32] gave his only begotten son that if a
[2:05:35] certain group would believe on him, I
[2:05:36] would save him. No, he put whosoever.
[2:05:44] Praise the Lord. How many knows that's a
[2:05:46] powerful thing?
[2:05:47] I don't know about you, but I believed
[2:05:49] it, Brother Tommy. I believed it. You
[2:05:52] believed it. And when you believed it,
[2:05:55] you got the benefits of
[2:05:57] it. And it opened up the door to
[2:06:02] everything. Everything you'll ever have
[2:06:05] need of in this life or in the world to
[2:06:08] come is in you when he fills you with
[2:06:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Christ is
[2:06:14] the door to every blessing of God. It's
[2:06:18] a oh my. It's a door to the
[2:06:20] resurrection. It's a door to healing.
[2:06:22] It's a door to all of that. Amen. Maybe
[2:06:25] we'll cover some more Wednesday, but
[2:06:26] we're going to stop there. Is that okay?
[2:06:30] How many would say, "Lord Jesus, if
[2:06:31] there's any iniquity, Lord, take it from
[2:06:33] me. Lord, I do not want to be partakers
[2:06:36] of this world's sins." You're living in
[2:06:39] an age, folks. I'm here to tell you that
[2:06:41] if you don't conquer your carnal nature,
[2:06:44] if you don't get a new birth, you have
[2:06:45] the most evil things right at your
[2:06:48] fingertips.
[2:06:49] Hello. And it's going to take somebody
[2:06:52] that truly down in their heart loves God
[2:06:54] with all their heart, all their mind,
[2:06:57] all their soul, and all their strength
[2:06:59] to make it through this temp through
[2:07:02] this temptation. Remember the previous I
[2:07:05] always wondered kind of I've had my own
[2:07:07] ideas on going to share, but I'm here to
[2:07:09] tell you that the previous age, Amen.
[2:07:11] God says, "I will also keep you from the
[2:07:14] hour of temptation."
[2:07:16] How many knows this is the hour of
[2:07:18] temptation to go the easy route to be
[2:07:22] lukewarm.
[2:07:24] Hello.
[2:07:26] Temptation in every way, but God will
[2:07:27] keep you. You and I are living in the
[2:07:29] hour of temptation. Amen. And it'll take
[2:07:33] God to hold us. How many's glad for the
[2:07:34] Holy Spirit to hold you? God bless you.
[2:07:37] Musicians, if you'll come, Brother
[2:07:40] David. Sing a song or two. Dismiss. And
[2:07:42] then I want to say all like I said right
[2:07:44] after service. Amen. We want to have the
[2:07:46] meeting here because brother Brad has
[2:07:47] some the reason I'm doing it here and
[2:07:49] not down there in the fellowship Paul
[2:07:51] because he has some slides and things he
[2:07:52] wants to show you. Amen. So God richly
[2:07:56] bless you. Amen. Let's just have a word
[2:07:57] of prayer. Amen. Stand with
[2:08:00] me. Kind heavenly father as we come Lord
[2:08:04] at the close of the ministering of the
[2:08:06] word. Father I pray Lord Jesus as we
[2:08:09] have looked Lord Jesus of how the world
[2:08:12] has become completely corrupt. How that
[2:08:14] Satan sitting on his throne? How did he
[2:08:17] has according to the prophet of God come
[2:08:19] to the place that he always desired to
[2:08:21] be? Took him 6,000 years to get to where
[2:08:25] he wanted to be. Even as according to
[2:08:28] the scriptures, it took you took 6,000
[2:08:30] years to make Eden the way that you
[2:08:32] wanted it. Took him 6,000 years and
[2:08:34] finally he's getting his Eden the way
[2:08:37] that he wants it. But in the midst of
[2:08:39] that Eid, in the midst of that darkness,
[2:08:41] Lord Jesus, you've got a bride. You've
[2:08:43] got somebody that you have called out.
[2:08:45] Called out of the chaos. Called out of
[2:08:49] the sin, Lord Jesus, to be your bride,
[2:08:52] spotless,
[2:08:54] virtuous, pure bride of Jesus Christ,
[2:08:57] Lord. Father, we raise our hands and
[2:08:59] say, God, take all evil from me.
[2:09:02] Everything that is of the world, Lord,
[2:09:04] take it from me, Lord. Lord Jesus, we
[2:09:06] open our hearts. We open the door of our
[2:09:08] hearts to you and say, Lord Jesus,
[2:09:10] search every area of our life. Fill us
[2:09:12] in every fiber with your being Lord
[2:09:14] Jesus this morning in Jesus name. Amen
[2:09:18] and amen.
[2:09:24] God bless you. Sing that little chorus.
[2:09:26] So glad I'm yours,
[2:09:29] Lord. So glad I'm
[2:09:33] yours,
[2:09:35] Lord. So glad I'm yours.
[2:09:42] So glad your
[2:09:46] mercy has followed
[2:09:52] me. So glad you found
[2:09:57] me and you set me
[2:10:01] [Music]
[2:10:03] free. So glad I'm
[2:10:07] yours, Lord.
[2:10:10] So glad I'm yours. Can we sing it to him
[2:10:14] again this
[2:10:15] morning? So glad I'm yours,
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:21] Lord. Glad I'm
[2:10:27] yours. So glad your
[2:10:32] mercy has followed me.
[2:10:39] So glad you found
[2:10:43] me and you set me
[2:10:49] free. So glad I'm
[2:10:53] yours,
[2:10:55] Lord. So glad I'm
[2:11:01] yours. And Jesus got a hold of my life
[2:11:05] and he won't let me go.
[2:11:11] Jesus got into my heart. He got into my
[2:11:18] soul. Well, I used to be oh so
[2:11:23] sad. But now I'm just free and glad
[2:11:28] singing Jesus got a hold of my life and
[2:11:33] he won't let me go. Once again this
[2:11:36] morning. Oh, I'm singing. Jesus got a
[2:11:40] hold of my life and he won't let me
[2:11:44] go. Yes, Lord. Oh, Jesus got into my
[2:11:50] heart. He got into my soul.
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:56] Well, I used to be so
[2:11:59] sad, but now I'm just free and
[2:12:04] glad. Jesus got a hold of my life. God
[2:12:09] bless you. As you're dismissed this
[2:12:11] morning, I'm singing, "Jesus got a hold
[2:12:16] of my life and he won't let me go."
[2:12:23] Jesus got
