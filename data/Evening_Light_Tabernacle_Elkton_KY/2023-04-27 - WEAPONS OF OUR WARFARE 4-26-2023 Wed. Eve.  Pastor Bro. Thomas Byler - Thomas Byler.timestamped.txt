[42:42] and I think we'll read second Peter our
[42:45] first Peter first uh first Peter 5 and
[42:48] if you have your scriptures also there
[42:51] in Ephesians 6. amen just get it ready
[42:54] for both of those and first Peter 5. now
[42:58] I want to read what I read amen I

[43:02] little foundation with the help of the
[43:04] Lord

[43:20] good preachers down there amen and
[43:22] taking a couple of services in amen all
[43:25] right
[43:26] first Peter and five and we'll begin
[43:28] with verse 8. be sober be vigilant
[43:32] because your adversary the devil as a
[43:35] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[43:38] he may devour whom resists steadfast now
[43:42] notice the word resist there it'll be
[43:45] going along with uh the same word that
[43:48] Paul used over in Ephesians amen talking
[43:52] about
[43:54] um standing against The Wiles of the
[43:57] devil amen so now notice here he says
[44:00] goes who resists steadfast in the faith
[44:04] knowing that the same afflictions are
[44:06] accomplished in your brethren that are
[44:08] in the world but the God of all Grace
[44:10] who hath called us unto his eternal
[44:12] glory by Christ Jesus and you have
[44:15] suffered a while make you perfect and
[44:17] establish and strengthen settle you amen
[44:20] over in Ephesians 6 and verse 10.
[44:23] finally
[44:24] my brother
[44:27] finally my brother in verse 10 of
[44:29] chapter 6 be strong in the Lord and in
[44:32] the power of His might put on the whole
[44:35] armor of God Amen that ye may be able to
[44:39] stand against The Wiles of the devil for
[44:42] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[44:44] but against principalities against
[44:46] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[44:49] this world against spiritual wickedness
[44:51] in high places wherefore take unto you
[44:54] the whole armor of God that you may be
[44:57] able to
[44:58] withstand that was the word I was
[45:00] looking for a minute ago amen over there
[45:02] it's at Peter said uh
[45:06] this amen steadfast into Face Paul here
[45:10] talking about it he said that you may be
[45:12] able to resist or withstand in that evil
[45:16] day and having done all to stand stand
[45:19] therefore having your low end skirt
[45:21] about with truth and having on the best
[45:23] plate of righteousness and you feed shod
[45:25] with the preparation of the gospel of
[45:27] peace amen above all taking the shield
[45:30] of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to
[45:32] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[45:34] and take the helmet of salvation the
[45:36] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[45:39] God Amen take that and we'll stop right
[45:42] there the god add His blessings to the
[45:44] reading of the word you can exceeded
[45:47] amen
[45:53] I had something in my mind and and the
[45:55] way that I had thought it and as I would
[45:57] begin to study it this afternoon and I
[46:00] ran across this and I really liked it
[46:02] because it really uh kind of Vindicated
[46:05] that my thought pattern was in the right
[46:07] direction amen
[46:11] remember I talked Sunday about how that
[46:13] no matter how many how many uh
[46:17] battles they won no matter how even even
[46:20] uh you know David with Goliath Samson
[46:24] and shamgar and all these they still
[46:26] were defeated
[46:28] they were still defeated amen because
[46:30] and they lived in defeat
[46:32] and brother Brandon he puts it this way
[46:34] and he was talking about Arnold Von
[46:38] Winkle Reed amen of Switzerland and how
[46:40] that I mean y'all remember the story
[46:43] well of how that they were surrounded by
[46:45] a much more Superior uh Army than what
[46:49] they were they were just farmers and so
[46:51] forth and and Arnold took it upon
[46:53] himself and uh to to tell his brother
[46:56] that he was going to give his
[46:58] it's like I
[47:00] for his country that day biggest bunch
[47:03] of Spears they had and he charged those
[47:05] Spears you know and screaming out Make
[47:08] Way for Liberty Make Way for Liberty as
[47:11] he plunged himself into those Spears is
[47:14] that right and because of his heroic uh
[47:18] move and heroism amen it routed the
[47:21] enemy in one place I believe brother
[47:23] ma'am said they haven't had a war since
[47:26] not for a very very long time amen and
[47:30] the Swiss people from what I understand
[47:31] had actually gotten away from God
[47:33] because of the fact they never had war
[47:35] never had it hard
[47:37] but it was in anyone he was uh talking
[47:40] about this and then he talks about the
[47:42] Lord Jesus Christ he says I want to tell
[47:45] you something he says one day Adam's
[47:48] race had been backed into a corner the
[47:50] law had failed the Justice had it failed
[47:54] the prophets had failed the judges had
[47:57] failed everything that God sent on Earth
[47:59] had failed
[48:00] amen
[48:01] so we look at that and realize that no
[48:03] matter what any all of that happened all
[48:05] the Old Testament they were still living
[48:06] in a failed State a defeated defeated
[48:10] State isn't that right amen and Adams
[48:14] Ray stood defeated amen sickness among
[48:18] them death among them everything deaths
[48:21] and in every place nothing could
[48:23] be done but in heaven there was one that
[48:25] stepped out the Son of God said this day
[48:27] I will give my life for Adam's race
[48:31] amen amen I thought much of what I've
[48:34] said about how that we uh we have got
[48:37] with the blood then
[48:40] of that war that happened on
[48:47] how much it was like it was like that we
[48:50] were we were defeated we were losing
[48:53] every time and amen we had a great hero
[48:56] to raise up amen that right to come down
[48:58] and fight for us and bring
[49:03] through the Enemy Lines so that we could
[49:05] actually enjoy some victory for a change
[49:08] amen it made us all Victorious because
[49:11] of what he did and brother Ben I'm
[49:13] talking about the Old Testament all this
[49:14] and man and so he says now and I noticed
[49:17] this day we're like I'm alive for Adam's
[49:18] race what will you do cry Dean just what
[49:21] will you do he came to the Earth he
[49:23] looked upon that bunch of men and women
[49:25] that wanted to serve God but they
[49:27] couldn't there was too much Temptation
[49:29] and I'm going to say there is still that
[49:31] carnal nature on the inside isn't that
[49:33] right no matter how much they pray not
[49:35] what they want there is still that amen
[49:38] that that prevailed that that
[49:41] black
[49:42] dog
[49:43] that prevailed things that there's a
[49:46] white dog
[49:47] so to speak
[49:49] amen
[49:50] y'all know the story of the how you
[49:53] doing chief
[49:55] oh it's pretty good pretty bad
[49:58] you know he's what do you mean he's well
[50:00] ever since I got saved there's been two
[50:02] dogs in me you know and there's a black
[50:04] dog and a white dog always fighting at
[50:07] each other isn't that right
[50:09] always fighting at each other and so
[50:11] forth world but I said well which one
[50:13] wins
[50:14] and he said well the one that I feed the
[50:16] most and isn't that the truth in our
[50:19] daily life the one that wins is the one
[50:22] that you feed the most because that
[50:24] black dog will always be there with you
[50:26] as long as you live amen
[50:28] amen
[50:30] amen I uh gonna read a scripture in a
[50:33] minute
[50:35] but I'm gonna just go ahead and read a
[50:36] little bit he says this I say then this
[50:38] isn't I won't tell you I'll tell you
[50:40] later this I say then walk in the spirit
[50:43] and shall not fulfill the lust of the
[50:46] flesh amen how many believe that for the
[50:49] flesh lusts us against the spirit and
[50:51] the spirit against the Flesh and these
[50:53] are contrary one to another
[50:55] others so that you cannot do the things
[50:57] that you would well I'll tell you what
[50:58] if a preacher wanted to just stop there
[50:59] see you ain't never going to be able to
[51:01] do what you want because they're like
[51:02] she's always going to stop you
[51:04] huh you could stop there if you wanted
[51:06] to it says you can't do what you want
[51:08] but how many beliefs you need to really
[51:09] read the rest of them and then notice
[51:13] the very next verse yes but if you be
[51:15] letting the spirit ye are not under the
[51:18] law and praise the Lord but that doesn't
[51:19] have a fact if you're led by the spirit
[51:21] of God praise be to God let me finish my
[51:24] story so now notice he says in that and
[51:27] I noticed
[51:28] uh there was too much Temptations
[51:30] there's too much sin so much sickness so
[51:34] much troubles on every hand they
[51:35] couldn't everything had failed and he
[51:38] looked and he found the darkest spot of
[51:40] man's fear and that was that
[51:42] amen
[51:44] not only this but we could
[51:46] go through all his whole life there was
[51:48] sickness there was blindness huh there
[51:51] was confusion about what the truth was
[51:54] all kinds of things you don't have to
[51:56] come and show the way but the last death
[51:58] that he destroyed and the worst was and
[52:00] that was this it's always been and right
[52:02] right he ran right on to Calvary and got
[52:04] the thickest of the spirit and they
[52:06] throwed it into his heart and he cried
[52:08] back he says take what I leave you the
[52:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fight
[52:14] hey man how many blades he won the
[52:17] victory for us
[52:18] brother I mean if there ever was a time
[52:20] that those disciples pick up that
[52:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost one of the
[52:24] mightiest weapons has never been given
[52:26] to the hands of men and they cut a hole
[52:29] through sin they defeated the devil
[52:32] running him back with his sickness and
[52:34] all these other things men wants to see
[52:36] heroism men are waiting for a gallon
[52:39] stand the world's waiting to find a man
[52:42] that'll step out
[52:44] amen how many believe that yes sir to
[52:48] step out just like the disciples did
[52:50] amen defeated sickness defeated sour
[52:52] defeated amen being disfellowship with
[52:55] God
[52:56] praise be to God now notice here he
[52:59] makes another statement that I also
[53:00] printed out because I really liked it he
[53:03] says here not long ago he said they said
[53:05] when Divine Healing was going forth 10
[53:07] years ago when I started out on the
[53:08] field and said
[53:10] you can't do it brother man I'm saying
[53:12] science is against you the doctors
[53:14] against you modernism is against you but
[53:17] I said but Christ is for us that's right

[53:22] holes through everywhere

[55:20] hey man I'm gonna read this last quote
[55:22] just one more
[55:23] he proves his weapons of Warfare when he
[55:26] healed
[55:28] sick when it thousand he proved that he
[55:31] had power over every atom that there was
[55:34] not only did he grow the fish but he
[55:37] growed cooked fish
[55:39] [Laughter]
[55:41] they got out of that basket there was
[55:43] five fishes and five Lords every time he
[55:45] took a little piece off there was
[55:47] another beat there and they didn't need
[55:49] just grown to fish but it was good whoo
[55:52] you talk about instant
[55:55] folks how many believe that
[55:57] again give you faith for whatever your
[55:59] issue is God can fix it all right away
[56:01] from the beginning to the end we ain't
[56:04] gonna go fishing catching and so forth
[56:06] he didn't say go catch some more fish
[56:07] I'm gonna make sure that the fish come
[56:09] and swim into your net no I didn't have
[56:11] to do that he just reached in
[56:13] how many believes his weapon was real
[56:16] I mean we need the weapon of faith is
[56:18] real
[56:20] aren't you glad that you serve a super
[56:22] demand he prove to you
[56:24] too and I can prove it by your Bible she
[56:27] says I don't believe it but if you can
[56:28] prove it by the Bible amen what did she
[56:30] do she went over to that one script
[56:32] scripture was cheap as Jesus wept
[56:36] he wrapped
[56:38] like a man see he was just the man he
[56:41] said your argument is thinner than the
[56:44] shadow of the brass of chicken that
[56:46] starves to death
[56:47] wasn't the chicken that starved for
[56:49] death it was the shadow of the chicken
[56:51] that starved today
[56:52] you might get a little out of a chicken
[56:54] that started that but you're never gonna
[56:55] get anything out of a shadow of a
[56:57] chicken that starved there
[57:00] hey man it was shallow he said that's
[57:02] right he was a man you know whenever he
[57:04] stood
[57:05] Lazarus grave he said a man that had
[57:07] been four days dead he says come forward
[57:09] Lazarus
[57:12] she wouldn't have said Lazarus he'd just
[57:15] said come forth
[57:17] prophet of God said it all come
[57:21] how many believe one of these days he's
[57:23] going to say come hither church and the
[57:26] whole church everybody filled with the
[57:27] Holy Ghost is going to go
[57:33] I'm looking for a feeling what did he
[57:36] say I'm gonna feel myself just go up
[57:39] how many believe that that's right he's
[57:41] gonna call and I'm gonna answer if I've
[57:44] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[57:46] will cause
[57:47] oh don't get me off here but
[57:50] when my savior calls I will answer when
[57:53] he calls for him yeah I will hear
[57:55] how many believe that but if you ain't
[57:57] got the Holy Ghost you ain't got nothing
[57:59] to pull with
[58:00] remember the magnet story brother random
[58:02] went to a big old factory one time and
[58:05] they were showing them how a sweeper
[58:06] would come over and get all the loose
[58:07] shavings and everything else and it
[58:09] would just suck it up and they'd go over
[58:10] and remold and me shaking he says well
[58:13] it takes up all the seals and there was
[58:15] aluminum shavings and stuff on the
[58:17] aluminum wouldn't pick up and man that
[58:19] thing come on over there and they picked
[58:20] it all up and he was showing him I was
[58:22] doing and they picked all them up when
[58:23] that thing coming over there he says you
[58:25] need to stick it over there and do it he
[58:26] says well glory to God he says what do
[58:29] you mean
[58:30] folks he could watch a conveyor go
[58:33] across a magnet and get a revelation
[58:36] isn't that right he says that's the way
[58:38] it is going to be one of these eggs a
[58:40] mental great magnet of God will come
[58:42] across everybody that's got the baptism
[58:44] of the Holy Ghost will be brought up and
[58:45] everybody that's made of a movement or
[58:47] something else ain't gonna get no pulled
[58:49] up they're not gonna go you're gonna
[58:52] just sit right there for the tribulation
[58:54] period
[58:55] oh Hallelujah
[58:58] amen God is good isn't he
[59:01] all right back to teaching oh I love
[59:04] teaching because I love preaching and
[59:05] teaching amen you love the Lord
[59:08] all right so every devil boy I tell you
[59:11] what he broke every devil power listen
[59:14] man was refused to go to heaven
[59:18] the highway was closed there was no
[59:21] highways for us
[59:23] amen but there was listen and he come to
[59:26] make one oh my the first line was Demons
[59:29] of doubt the next was prejudiced the
[59:33] next was selfishness
[59:35] this Earth was covered over with lines
[59:38] of demon powers
[59:40] I didn't believe that
[59:41] true
[59:43] folks when he when he come to defeat
[59:46] every devil every demon free to set you
[59:48] free we ought to appreciate our freedom
[59:51] amen
[59:53] Prejudice selfishness your carnal nature
[59:58] hatred there
[1:00:00] and simulations must disease Jesus
[1:00:04] amen but when he began to send up to
[1:00:06] heaven amen listen last night we had him
[1:00:09] come on out of Hell's with the keys of
[1:00:11] death and hell this morning we're taking
[1:00:13] up Hallelujah he says when he assigned
[1:00:15] it he was triumphant he went up he broke
[1:00:17] every devil power that holds over man
[1:00:21] amen he ascended on high and gave gifts
[1:00:24] to men the gift of the Holy
[1:00:27] the mighty conqueror he stands alone
[1:00:30] this morning and between him believer is
[1:00:33] that that's an Old Highway of Holiness
[1:00:35] that the righteous walk on it there's no
[1:00:39] way of Escape there's only one line cut
[1:00:41] down through glory and he left bloody
[1:00:44] Footprints as he walked through the
[1:00:46] corridors of the demon powers and made a
[1:00:49] highway for us all
[1:00:51] to go through and he sits on high this
[1:00:54] morning as the mighty
[1:00:56] come
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] forget his name now I lived in
[1:01:04] down in Memphis I believe it was he used
[1:01:07] to believe sing that oh Behold The
[1:01:10] Mighty conqueror amen oh Behold Him in
[1:01:13] plain view amen
[1:01:16] I forget the brother's name but you
[1:01:18] still love to hear but that's the truth
[1:01:20] isn't it he is that Mighty conqueror all
[1:01:22] right let's look at let's look at this
[1:01:25] let's look at this character
[1:01:27] that we have
[1:01:29] As Weapons because it's better than he
[1:01:32] made it that is Supernatural is that
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:36] so we're going to go two places first
[1:01:39] first I want to go to Ephesians perhaps
[1:01:41] before we go to Galatians
[1:01:44] let's go back to Ephesians and I want to
[1:01:47] take one scripture at a time with the
[1:01:49] help of the Lord
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:53] Paul says verse 10. finally my brethren
[1:01:56] if he
[1:01:57] is six and ten be strong in the Lord and
[1:02:01] in the power of His might
[1:02:07] can I just say what comes to mind I can
[1:02:09] just just about here Paul telling us
[1:02:11] that right now for our generation for
[1:02:14] you and for me finally Brethren look at
[1:02:16] where you've come to look at where we
[1:02:17] are
[1:02:18] finally it's time to be strong in the
[1:02:21] Lord and in the power of His might
[1:02:25] the power of His might how many knows
[1:02:28] Paul said when I am weak then
[1:02:31] he is
[1:02:32] strong
[1:02:34] seriously get us to be weak in ourselves
[1:02:37] awesome
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:42] I find that when I'm weak and I'm
[1:02:45] really really down like or whatever
[1:02:49] I realize I say Lord
[1:02:51] I'm weak
[1:02:53] but now you can be strong and he always
[1:02:55] is amen however he's the power of His
[1:02:58] might not your might or my might but his
[1:03:01] might put on that whole armor of God
[1:03:03] that ye may be able to stand against the
[1:03:07] Wows of the devil
[1:03:09] praise be to God
[1:03:11] for we wrestle not against
[1:03:13] flesh and blood but against
[1:03:14] principalities against Powers against
[1:03:16] the rumors of Darkness of this world
[1:03:18] again spiritual wickedness in high
[1:03:22] places
[1:03:23] amen I do not know I have not really
[1:03:27] heard the prophet or did any kind of
[1:03:29] research on
[1:03:32] what the high places are
[1:03:35] so I just kind of pray Lord what are the
[1:03:37] high places
[1:03:39] amen what are the high places
[1:03:43] you know my opinion is
[1:03:46] your heart
[1:03:48] and your mind
[1:03:50] and brother bam say that the devil wants
[1:03:52] but God wants the heart
[1:03:55] and isn't that what all principalities
[1:03:57] in our schools and what they're teaching
[1:03:59] our kids right now and stuff they want
[1:04:01] their minds
[1:04:03] because if they get their minds they'll
[1:04:04] get their heart
[1:04:06] and they'll persuade these kids that
[1:04:08] America is bad
[1:04:10] isn't that what they're doing
[1:04:11] that's right out there they're
[1:04:13] persuading the kids that America is bad
[1:04:16] isn't that terrible it's communist
[1:04:19] brother Branham said there was right in
[1:04:20] woven in Among Us don't worry about
[1:04:22] communism over there watch the stuff
[1:04:24] that's right on the inside
[1:04:26] but so my thought is your heart and your
[1:04:30] mind are high places
[1:04:33] the devil wants it and God wants it
[1:04:35] because what is this heart it's the
[1:04:37] control tower of your life
[1:04:40] and your mind is a high place because
[1:04:42] whatever you allow to come in here isn't
[1:04:45] that right will dominate and come down
[1:04:46] and dominate to astounding here it has
[1:04:49] to first come through the mind that's
[1:04:51] why the prophet of God set the greatest
[1:04:52] battle ever for is fought where in the
[1:04:55] human mind
[1:04:56] so to me that's the high places that's
[1:04:59] where the battle goes on is in the heart
[1:05:02] hurt and in the mind amen
[1:05:06] wherefore take unto you
[1:05:08] know
[1:05:10] the whole armor of God Amen
[1:05:14] Hey Brother Bam Sister a wicked in
[1:05:17] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:05:20] sign and there'll be no sign given it to
[1:05:22] it but design of the prophet Jonah which
[1:05:25] according to what brother Phantom says
[1:05:27] was the The Sign of the Resurrection
[1:05:31] all right
[1:05:32] Paul Jonah coming forth about in a
[1:05:34] resurrection form amen after so many
[1:05:36] days coming forth amen and he said that
[1:05:39] was for this Jenna brother bam says that
[1:05:41] apply to our generation that this is a
[1:05:44] wicked and an adulterous generation let
[1:05:46] me believe that
[1:05:48] sure is very Wicked
[1:05:50] very adulterous generation
[1:05:53] amen that you might be able to withstand
[1:05:56] in other words to resist against amen
[1:06:01] to overcome to withstand it not to be
[1:06:05] overtaken by it and we know that the
[1:06:07] devil this just comes to my mind now
[1:06:13] even but my wife I think it was this
[1:06:16] morning we probably talked about now
[1:06:17] that we think about it and she was
[1:06:18] talking about how that you know look at
[1:06:20] that look at the Demonic powers that are
[1:06:23] around us now
[1:06:24] remember back in the 60s brother Brown
[1:06:26] says the lid has come off of hell and
[1:06:29] streams and streams demon powers are
[1:06:32] coming out upon the Earth now so that's
[1:06:34] exactly right because you didn't have it
[1:06:36] in the early 1900s or the 1800s you
[1:06:38] didn't have the wickedness yeah no none
[1:06:40] of that stuff
[1:06:41] isn't that right so it they were they
[1:06:44] were kept at Bay I believe it was in the
[1:06:47] future of the prom promise that brother
[1:06:49] bam talked about no demon powers and so
[1:06:51] forth that were held because the church
[1:06:53] held is that right because the Holy
[1:06:55] Spirit held them back because when we
[1:06:57] got church hey Church holes demons demon
[1:07:00] powers away
[1:07:02] Church keeps the families together it
[1:07:06] keeps your life together you get away
[1:07:08] from that watch out isn't that right
[1:07:10] people got into rock and roll as soon as
[1:07:13] they got Elvis out as soon as some of
[1:07:15] that began out evil begin to come out of
[1:07:18] course we got rap music and now all that
[1:07:20] stuff and it's just turned every loose
[1:07:21] they can't even hardly fly through the
[1:07:23] air anymore without
[1:07:27] having to throw people off isn't that
[1:07:28] right I may recent news about this plane
[1:07:31] had to take so many of them fighting
[1:07:32] each other and biting each other and all
[1:07:34] kinds of stuff oh my you can't you can't
[1:07:37] have ball games anymore they have riots
[1:07:39] hit the ball games you're getting that
[1:07:41] shot
[1:07:42] at a birthday party and this side of the
[1:07:45] other or oh my
[1:07:49] violence shall be increased how many
[1:07:52] violence is certainly being increased
[1:07:55] oh my folks I'm here to tell you uh and
[1:07:58] I could go back and I won't because it's
[1:08:00] kind of the sideline of where I want it
[1:08:01] to go and not what I wanted to think but
[1:08:03] uh brother bam says you know lawlessness
[1:08:06] is what it's going to Prevail
[1:08:07] lawlessness
[1:08:09] and he said a lot about it's going to
[1:08:11] become very Lawless and look at what it
[1:08:13] is they don't want the laws anymore oh
[1:08:15] yeah amen
[1:08:17] in the evil day that you might be able
[1:08:19] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:08:21] done all to stand stand therefore and I
[1:08:24] got to thinking about it you know
[1:08:25] because
[1:08:27] this battle that you and I are in
[1:08:31] this
[1:08:32] and it's life I mean life life itself is
[1:08:35] a battle
[1:08:36] I mean you're in it whether you want to
[1:08:38] be in it or not
[1:08:40] and you're either going to be taken by
[1:08:42] this lion amen Aurora I'm either going
[1:08:44] to devour you or you're going to have to
[1:08:46] take a stand against you one or the
[1:08:47] other and we know that my you know and
[1:08:50] you cannot cannot at any time
[1:08:53] and I think this goes along with what
[1:08:55] Brother Brad said and not at any time
[1:08:56] can you let down
[1:08:58] and become lukewarm and just float with
[1:09:00] the tide because if you knew the devil
[1:09:03] would come on in there somewhere
[1:09:05] isn't that right and that's what I
[1:09:07] believe we got to watch every album
[1:09:09] every channel hey man that's why you got
[1:09:11] to stand and have all your lawyers have
[1:09:14] every
[1:09:15] thing in order because if devil looks
[1:09:17] and he's trying to get in any way that
[1:09:19] he possibly can
[1:09:21] but I got to thinking about this and one
[1:09:22] of the things that kind of took me in
[1:09:24] this direction is where brother bam was
[1:09:25] saying he says you know in um I'm
[1:09:27] thinking it might be the greatest battle
[1:09:28] ever fought and he was talking about
[1:09:30] these channels and so forth he says no
[1:09:32] don't don't wait look at how long you
[1:09:33] can fight with the devil on something he
[1:09:35] said stop him riding his tracks as soon
[1:09:39] as that thought comes or whatever just
[1:09:40] stop it right there
[1:09:42] huh
[1:09:43] how many leaves because just now let him
[1:09:46] kill him right there you don't want to
[1:09:48] battle with him don't let him in just
[1:09:50] like thoughts that come over your head
[1:09:53] come into your head
[1:09:54] how many know you gotta deal with it
[1:09:56] right away because you can't let that
[1:09:57] bird come in there because if you let
[1:09:59] that bird come in sometime it'll make a
[1:10:02] nest
[1:10:03] oh and it'll get you thinking of
[1:10:05] thinking of thinking and then guess what
[1:10:06] it'll lay eggs because from not just
[1:10:09] this but this and this and this and this
[1:10:11] it'll have eggs and have little birdies
[1:10:13] for them after a while chirping on your
[1:10:15] head
[1:10:16] yeah what kinds of little birds that you
[1:10:18] don't want on your head
[1:10:23] is that right amen I know what I'm
[1:10:26] talking about because I I gotta get kill
[1:10:28] that bird kill the eggs
[1:10:30] and everything else if I let it build a
[1:10:32] nest in my head because you're sure how
[1:10:34] many knows you'll try to do it
[1:10:36] he'll have a whole flock of little
[1:10:38] babies on your head and thinking if you
[1:10:39] don't watch out
[1:10:41] all right praise the Lord
[1:10:45] so
[1:10:46] my thought was be vigilant Bible says be
[1:10:50] vigilant
[1:10:52] you know I don't know exactly what
[1:10:53] Vigilant means but I would think that it
[1:10:56] probably means something on the order of
[1:10:57] diligent perseverant amen
[1:11:02] not lukewarmer haphazard about it in
[1:11:04] other words stay alert let me knows that
[1:11:07] in your battle you got to stay alert
[1:11:09] watch those arrows that's
[1:11:11] coming your way because you're sure
[1:11:13] you're gonna come your way
[1:11:15] amen so you got to be vigilant because
[1:11:17] he's an adversary amen can't just float
[1:11:20] with the tide of your feelings
[1:11:25] you know what feelings are really good
[1:11:27] for
[1:11:29] feelings are good
[1:11:31] you need feelings we need more feelings
[1:11:34] amen not that we go by him as our doc
[1:11:37] and so forth but you know when you're
[1:11:39] feeling that operating
[1:11:42] no if you can't feel for people you
[1:11:45] can't help them
[1:11:48] you got to feel
[1:11:50] for people
[1:11:52] images and this this will actually go in
[1:11:56] towards the end of my talking about love
[1:11:58] how to
[1:11:59] he uh loved that man that was a Mexican
[1:12:02] man and he thought about where did his
[1:12:04] shoes would fit him or his coat would
[1:12:05] feed him and so forth and when he was
[1:12:07] overcoming that great big bull is that
[1:12:09] right remember that he was overcoming
[1:12:11] that great big bull and he apologized to
[1:12:14] the bull for being in his territory and
[1:12:16] for disturbing him
[1:12:20] folks I'm here to tell you when we have
[1:12:21] that kind of feelings for each other we
[1:12:24] will overcome a whole bunch of devils
[1:12:26] but we don't want to hurt each other's
[1:12:28] feelings
[1:12:32] that's free isn't that right but that's
[1:12:34] what we should we should each and every
[1:12:35] one of us see God help me not to hurt
[1:12:37] because we can unintentionally so many
[1:12:39] times hurt each other's feelings
[1:12:42] amen and I'm probably the worst
[1:12:46] hope not but anyway Lord help you all
[1:12:49] pray for me amen
[1:12:51] the Lord's working on me he really is
[1:12:53] but that's what
[1:12:55] good feelings are good for if it's
[1:12:57] operated by the love of God God can use
[1:12:59] it and do great things with it he can
[1:13:01] actually manifest himself through there
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:04] all right well
[1:13:06] now we talk about one of the weapons
[1:13:08] because remember remember what we said
[1:13:10] about
[1:13:12] um let me see here we'll just go to it
[1:13:14] right the fruit of the spirit brother
[1:13:16] Branham said was our spiritual weapons
[1:13:18] but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:13:21] right now it's a character but it's also
[1:13:25] a mighty weapon as a matter of fact
[1:13:27] brother Benson's greatest weapon in the
[1:13:29] Christian Arsenal is the love of God
[1:13:31] I would say the next to that is Faith
[1:13:33] Now by this faith hope and love the
[1:13:35] greatest is love and I would say the
[1:13:38] next is Faith amen
[1:13:42] God's favor was one of the most powerful
[1:13:44] weapons that we have
[1:13:47] no I'll just I'll just cover that
[1:13:50] right now and that is what is prayer
[1:13:54] did you ever see any tank movies of
[1:13:57] World War II where they have to grab
[1:13:59] these big shells and put it into that
[1:14:01] chamber and and boom you know
[1:14:03] well prayer is putting the bullet in the
[1:14:06] gun
[1:14:07] ask and you shall receive
[1:14:10] Steve isn't that right so you gotta ask
[1:14:12] put that in there pray it and then watch
[1:14:15] it happen
[1:14:16] amen boom
[1:14:18] amen and it doesn't matter how many
[1:14:20] times you've gone misfires and that
[1:14:23] weapon says no matter how many times you
[1:14:24] don't go off
[1:14:26] just another one put another shell
[1:14:28] in yeah well they didn't happen but I
[1:14:30] still believe God is God and God will do
[1:14:33] it huh just keep firing it'll work
[1:14:37] you'll kill that devil don't quit just
[1:14:40] because it didn't work a time or two or
[1:14:42] it didn't fire
[1:14:43] amen but that's what prayer is it's the
[1:14:46] most powerful weapon amen because it
[1:14:48] brings God on the scene
[1:14:49] and it puts that bullet in that gun
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:54] so I'll I'll jump over here is that okay
[1:14:57] for a second the fruit of the spirit is
[1:14:59] love amen and that's the most powerful
[1:15:01] Joy how many knows Joy if you have joy
[1:15:04] that's the opposite
[1:15:06] of being sad
[1:15:10] huh
[1:15:12] down-hearted
[1:15:18] peace it's the next one how can peace be
[1:15:21] a weapon let the peace of God the Bible
[1:15:24] says rule in your heart
[1:15:27] in other words it's ruling
[1:15:29] and if you want to keep that peace what
[1:15:32] do you do whenever the Devil comes and
[1:15:34] tempts you and say new yeah we'll just
[1:15:36] get on out of here I like the peace that
[1:15:38] I got
[1:15:40] now many knows that uh
[1:15:44] at one time we were at war with God
[1:15:48] we couldn't have peace with God because
[1:15:50] we always doing things that God didn't
[1:15:52] like didn't wasn't pleased with
[1:15:54] and I believe it's in Romans right quick
[1:15:56] I believe it's in Romans it says
[1:15:58] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:16:01] have peace with God
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:05] once you get Justified and God forgives
[1:16:08] you of all of your sins you come right
[1:16:09] with God then you've got peace with God
[1:16:12] and it's a weapon against the enemy
[1:16:14] because God the devil wants to take your
[1:16:16] peace
[1:16:18] huh
[1:16:20] got the peace that passes understanding
[1:16:22] down in my heart
[1:16:25] you know I believe that when you have
[1:16:26] peace just wonderful you're at peace
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:33] you're at peace you're at peace with me
[1:16:36] you're angry
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:45] no no
[1:16:47] and let me just say this I hope I can
[1:16:50] get this and I got this rope down but
[1:16:52] it's kind of like um
[1:16:56] when Jesus was on the cross
[1:17:00] they kind of wanted him to hate them
[1:17:04] the devil didn't really want him to die
[1:17:06] on the cross and pay the price what did
[1:17:08] they say if thou be the Christ come down
[1:17:10] off the cross how many notes even our
[1:17:12] Prophet said the Bible says you know he
[1:17:14] had the power to call Twin Legions of
[1:17:16] angels and
[1:17:18] foreign
[1:17:27] did he come off the cross he didn't come
[1:17:29] off the cross because that's what the
[1:17:31] devil wanted him to do he wanted him to
[1:17:32] act like the devil would
[1:17:34] get Vengeance on him come down there and
[1:17:37] straighten things up and then we'll
[1:17:38] believe no you didn't believe you
[1:17:39] wouldn't believe now you're just crying
[1:17:41] to get me the same devil that
[1:17:44] had him up on the mountain attempted him
[1:17:46] up there was there at the cross tempting
[1:17:48] him come on down come on
[1:17:52] he said nah I'm not coming on down
[1:17:56] if I did come on
[1:17:58] the whole approach you want
[1:18:02] amen but what did he do
[1:18:09] begin
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:13] that's back before we mentioned it
[1:18:16] a little bit Sunday I believe it worked
[1:18:18] on how they love conquers everything I
[1:18:20] mean there's nothing more powerful amen
[1:18:22] than love and he conquered through love
[1:18:25] amen and goodness be not overcome by
[1:18:28] evil but overcome evil with good and of
[1:18:31] course the next one is mentioned here
[1:18:32] and that's faith
[1:18:35] that's the fruit of the spirit it's the
[1:18:37] character of a Christian but also it is
[1:18:40] fate
[1:18:45] I mean we'll talk about faith again and
[1:18:47] in a minute over in the book of
[1:18:48] Ephesians means that you have already
[1:18:50] overcome Pride
[1:18:54] overcome Pride
[1:18:56] with meekness
[1:18:58] temperance
[1:19:06] world does not have Temperance they do
[1:19:09] not have self-control and if you have
[1:19:11] Temperance that means that that
[1:19:12] Temperance already overcome your self
[1:19:15] you've already overcome
[1:19:20] again such there is no law and they that
[1:19:24] a Christ have crucified the flesh with
[1:19:27] the affections and lusts amen
[1:19:31] for if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:19:34] walk
[1:19:35] in the spirit and a couple weeks ago it
[1:19:38] says the Holy Spirit has to teach us how
[1:19:40] to talk the Holy Spirit has to teach us
[1:19:42] how to walk
[1:19:44] how do we walk we walk in the spirit
[1:19:47] every step that we take Lord help us I'm
[1:19:50] sure you're with me this evening every
[1:19:51] step that we take in the spirit Lord
[1:19:55] help me to do everything that I do in
[1:19:57] the spirit according to the spirit
[1:19:59] because just one one time I just lose
[1:20:02] you here uh uh oh that's that's you you
[1:20:06] messed up you messed up the walk isn't
[1:20:08] that right
[1:20:09] you get back down on your knees and say
[1:20:11] Lord forgive me I tripped right there
[1:20:13] the devil does trip us don't he but you
[1:20:15] got to get back up and say Lord let me
[1:20:17] walk in the spirit
[1:20:20] amen and that long-suffering Amen Let me
[1:20:23] just mention this but the long-suffering
[1:20:25] goes along with patience isn't that
[1:20:26] right now we know that the Bible says
[1:20:29] that those our forefathers and so forth
[1:20:31] he says Those Who through patience
[1:20:34] inherit the promises
[1:20:39] patience is a
[1:20:42] virtue or strength
[1:20:44] there's a lot of people that do not have
[1:20:46] patience with God I mean no matter what
[1:20:49] you're facing be patient and let God do
[1:20:51] it
[1:20:54] because most
[1:20:55] people
[1:20:57] don't want to wait on God I want it done
[1:20:58] now is that right Abraham had to wait 25
[1:21:01] years
[1:21:02] no uh had to wait 120
[1:21:07] years
[1:21:09] inherit the promises
[1:21:12] you and I Christendom has been waiting
[1:21:14] for 2 000 years
[1:21:18] then it's a waiting on the coming of the
[1:21:20] Lord Brother Brahman places his own
[1:21:22] Houston over here over there waiting on
[1:21:24] coming to the Lord be patient unto the
[1:21:26] coming of the Lord
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:33] that's why any one of us can appreciate
[1:21:37] endurance
[1:21:39] but God said time-tested memorials
[1:21:42] people that are tested by maritime
[1:21:45] that person has been a Christian for
[1:21:48] years and years and years and all I can
[1:21:51] see is Christ in and growing closer to
[1:21:54] Christ
[1:21:54] that's got to be God right there because
[1:21:57] we could just mean too many of them that
[1:21:59] they're just not serving God anymore
[1:22:02] they're not serving God anymore you got
[1:22:04] to have long suffering and you got to
[1:22:06] have patience be patient on Amen
[1:22:10] praise the Lord's Ahmed believes those
[1:22:11] are weapons they're a strength amen
[1:22:16] back to Ephesians again
[1:22:19] that you may be able to verse 13 against
[1:22:22] the walls of them having done all to
[1:22:24] stand stand therefore I mean your loyal
[1:22:27] and skirt about with truth
[1:22:31] amen
[1:22:33] in other words you got to be in the
[1:22:35] truth
[1:22:36] now I wrote down here aren't we glad
[1:22:39] that
[1:22:40] we have truth
[1:22:43] she said I am the way
[1:22:47] I am the truth
[1:22:50] and so many times we look at the prophet
[1:22:52] of God and we so we thank him brother
[1:22:54] Brian was just a brother
[1:22:57] that was able to surrender to almighty
[1:22:59] God
[1:23:00] odd and then God could do these things
[1:23:03] because God gets all the glory don't he
[1:23:07] God gets all the glory
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:12] even one place he talked about the
[1:23:14] healing and so forth he don't really
[1:23:15] like to even lay hands on people and so
[1:23:17] forth because as they'll say well
[1:23:19] brother man ladies hands up
[1:23:21] I mean I got well he says no you
[1:23:23] shouldn't do that it's crazy it's the
[1:23:26] word and try to get you to have hey
[1:23:31] in Christ and this Christ that gets the
[1:23:34] glory
[1:23:35] how many believe that ministers all of
[1:23:39] us it's Christ that gets the glory
[1:23:40] because we're just a sinner saved by
[1:23:42] grace like anybody else
[1:23:45] amen but what makes us great is to be
[1:23:48] able to yield ourselves to God that God
[1:23:49] can use us but a lot of times we tend to
[1:23:52] lay the glory on the man
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:00] how they say one time well brother
[1:24:02] Branham healed that person
[1:24:04] that's in
[1:24:06] correct
[1:24:07] that completely Incorrect and of course
[1:24:10] it's kind of the sect of the message
[1:24:13] that
[1:24:14] wanna
[1:24:16] make brother Branham more than what he
[1:24:18] was it was God through the problem but
[1:24:21] of God that does it
[1:24:24] any minister is the same way as God
[1:24:26] through them if we can get you to have
[1:24:28] faith amen how many appreciates faith
[1:24:32] there's been a lot of healing take place
[1:24:34] right here in this church I don't
[1:24:35] believe it I believe that amen I think
[1:24:37] brother Tommy was one of them that I
[1:24:39] admire his faith is that right a lot of
[1:24:43] us say well I'm Healed praise God I'm
[1:24:45] accepted I believe it but very few will
[1:24:47] stay stop taking their medicine
[1:24:50] and they could drop dead easily because
[1:24:53] of it
[1:24:58] you gotta have a revelation
[1:25:01] but it
[1:25:04] might honorable faith
[1:25:07] if it's a real Revelation hey live or
[1:25:09] die I'm I'm believing it
[1:25:11] amen
[1:25:13] but to see
[1:25:15] what God has done it's a real tremendous
[1:25:17] story and it's not anything
[1:25:21] that person's faith in Revelation every
[1:25:23] one of us how many believe that
[1:25:25] sickness and all diseases no matter what
[1:25:29] is just put your faith in the almighty
[1:25:32] God live or die
[1:25:34] God
[1:25:35] amen God will do it
[1:25:38] truth
[1:25:40] all right let's go a little longer on
[1:25:41] truth because I really want to touch on
[1:25:43] faith yet if I possibly can we no longer
[1:25:45] have to wonder what truth is because he
[1:25:48] came
[1:25:49] and did greater things in our generation
[1:25:52] than when he did that well deep what
[1:25:55] then what Jesus did while he walked the
[1:25:57] Earth
[1:25:58] and not So Much Greater because our
[1:26:00] prophet of God says he couldn't do much
[1:26:02] greater than race Eliza was from the
[1:26:03] dead on the fourth day isn't that right
[1:26:05] he couldn't do much greater than
[1:26:06] speaking things into existence and so
[1:26:09] forth I think one place uh perhaps one
[1:26:12] place but abandon mentioned that it was
[1:26:13] greater is because there was already
[1:26:15] fishes there was already loaves but when
[1:26:17] he spoke squirrels into there was no
[1:26:19] squirrels
[1:26:20] uh there was none God just completely to
[1:26:22] smoke him right into existence
[1:26:24] but more it means more he said more
[1:26:28] Works than these shall you do even Jesus
[1:26:31] said more Greater Works because I go to
[1:26:35] my father and to know that Christ came
[1:26:37] in our generation
[1:26:39] and proved himself
[1:26:40] over and over and over Vindicated
[1:26:43] himself
[1:26:45] Vindicated what was the truth amen
[1:26:50] wouldn't it be something if we had a
[1:26:52] prophet
[1:26:53] and we believed he was prophet but what
[1:26:55] he said just doesn't back up with the
[1:26:57] word
[1:26:58] we'd have an issue
[1:27:00] that would be really bad wouldn't it but
[1:27:02] to know that he was took us right back
[1:27:04] to the Bible indicates that he was
[1:27:06] really a prophet of God and not a false
[1:27:09] prophet
[1:27:10] it's because you can take everything
[1:27:12] right back to the word that's why I went
[1:27:15] to Saints when he was carried over to
[1:27:17] the other side and all those Saints and
[1:27:19] so forth the angel said you're going to
[1:27:20] be judged for what you have preached and
[1:27:22] brother bam says well we're Paul going
[1:27:23] to be judged for what he preached yep
[1:27:25] well praise God I'm good to go there can
[1:27:28] you imagine brother man who over the
[1:27:30] other side
[1:27:31] confidence because I just said what he
[1:27:34] did
[1:27:35] oh
[1:27:37] you know we have a debate
[1:27:39] we have a debate on
[1:27:41] on he's seen all of this his his
[1:27:44] converts were over there now I'm not not
[1:27:48] saying but people to me well there's
[1:27:49] that everyone is that me already over
[1:27:51] there my theophany or what I don't know
[1:27:53] but I'll tell you this
[1:27:55] if I would be over there I would be I'd
[1:27:57] be with that crowd that said we're
[1:28:00] resting on that we're believing that are
[1:28:03] you with me tonight that's right we're
[1:28:05] resting on that
[1:28:08] we're believing it because
[1:28:11] what he said was the word had to be
[1:28:13] Christ nobody could impersonate it
[1:28:17] nobody can impersonated remember a lot
[1:28:20] of times a lot of critics would come up
[1:28:22] the brother bands and they kind of
[1:28:23] criticize him and and not this out of
[1:28:25] the other you know what he said he says
[1:28:27] okay then you you come up here and do
[1:28:30] that
[1:28:32] he said you do it
[1:28:36] you know what it got them to do
[1:28:38] thank you
[1:28:41] shut up
[1:28:43] tithing it shut up
[1:28:46] because it's not me doing it it's Christ
[1:28:47] doing it anyway you God didn't call you
[1:28:52] he called me to do it he's the one that
[1:28:54] spoke to me I let treaty said you are
[1:28:55] God your message is going to fall around
[1:28:57] the Christ you're going to pray for
[1:28:58] potent dates and
[1:29:01] things
[1:29:02] Monarch you're gonna go over the world
[1:29:04] Peppers go back there and she'll Shake
[1:29:05] yourself off
[1:29:07] huh
[1:29:09] even he didn't believe it but he done it
[1:29:12] not by his own power but by the power of
[1:29:14] almighty God
[1:29:18] now I'll tell you what
[1:29:20] if people are on a message if we fade
[1:29:22] and if we die out and if we go into the
[1:29:24] cycle of death
[1:29:26] Christ has to come before we completely
[1:29:28] die
[1:29:30] amen because there's no other age coming
[1:29:32] no other message you're coming
[1:29:35] you see how close it is
[1:29:37] how many people just close
[1:29:39] I don't know about you but I don't
[1:29:41] believe I'm gonna die out
[1:29:42] my fire's not gonna burn out your Fire's
[1:29:45] not gonna burn out if you're a seed of
[1:29:47] God at all
[1:29:48] I'm in his lad for the truth
[1:29:50] that's right you're loins gird about
[1:29:52] with the truth no matter who you talk to
[1:29:55] you could take them right back to the
[1:29:57] truth
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:00] back to the word of God
[1:30:02] Hallelujah
[1:30:05] and having on the breastplate of
[1:30:08] righteousness we didn't even know what
[1:30:10] righteousness was until the prophet of
[1:30:12] God came we thought that doing this and
[1:30:14] doing that and not doing this and not
[1:30:16] doing that and having our hair right and
[1:30:17] our dresses right and and men doing
[1:30:19] right this down the other that was not
[1:30:21] it's not righteousness
[1:30:23] it's when the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:30:24] watched you from all of your sins his
[1:30:26] holy spirit is in there making the
[1:30:29] address right live right do right think
[1:30:31] right it's his righteousness because a
[1:30:34] lot of people do all of that from the
[1:30:36] Toronto they don't don't count none amen
[1:30:39] no it's got to be his righteousness we
[1:30:41] have the breastplate of his
[1:30:43] righteousness and your feet shot but the
[1:30:46] preparation of the gospel of peace amen
[1:30:49] I like that
[1:30:51] I talk about peace a while ago I mean
[1:30:53] that's the gospel is look God wants you
[1:30:55] to come back out of the chaos of the
[1:30:58] devil Scott Chan and bring you back to
[1:31:00] peace with God
[1:31:02] how many believe God wants you at peace
[1:31:03] with him amen the devil don't want you
[1:31:06] at peace with him above all taking the
[1:31:08] shield of faith
[1:31:10] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[1:31:13] the fiery darts of the wicked now how
[1:31:15] many knows it's going to be darts come
[1:31:17] at you
[1:31:19] amen I like that song Living by faith in
[1:31:23] Jesus above amen
[1:31:26] amen and it goes something about that
[1:31:28] and I feel no alarm
[1:31:30] while you're living by the faith of
[1:31:33] Jesus Christ
[1:31:36] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:31:39] God
[1:31:41] and I wrote down here
[1:31:44] I wrote down here you know just to have
[1:31:45] faith for your salvation that's
[1:31:47] wonderful but you got to live by faith
[1:31:49] no matter what comes your way
[1:31:52] live by faith have faith in God because
[1:31:54] you're not going to please God
[1:31:57] if you don't have faith for whatever
[1:31:58] comes your way how many believes we need
[1:32:01] to live by faith let Faith govern your
[1:32:04] entire existence
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:08] that's what pleasing to God
[1:32:10] oh my so faith
[1:32:13] there again
[1:32:15] it's part of the character it's part of
[1:32:17] your character remember Faith down there
[1:32:19] and it's also a weapon the one of the
[1:32:21] mightiest weapons
[1:32:22] ever stop there for a while
[1:32:24] that right
[1:32:27] by faith we have access unto God the
[1:32:30] Bible says
[1:32:32] no
[1:32:34] not unto God into disgrace
[1:32:37] therefore being justified by by faith we
[1:32:40] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[1:32:44] by faith into this grace where when we
[1:32:49] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[1:32:51] glory of God in other words it gives you
[1:32:54] access to his grace
[1:32:57] his forgiveness
[1:33:00] he's Calvary everything all this again
[1:33:03] man you don't have the work to have your
[1:33:05] sins all you have to have is the faith
[1:33:07] of God dropped into your heart and we
[1:33:09] know that's by Grace also let me believe
[1:33:10] that
[1:33:12] and it's mighty weapon it'll destroy
[1:33:17] my my my my keep Faith at the Forefront
[1:33:20] of every one of your channels that is in
[1:33:23] your
[1:33:23] being
[1:33:24] keep faith on the Forefront
[1:33:27] and every time the devil tries to shoot
[1:33:28] something it's just Ricochet off
[1:33:32] Ricochet negative thought everything you
[1:33:35] shouldn't think we should rickety off
[1:33:40] I wish I had that poem or that saying
[1:33:46] cerebral hear no evil and so forth
[1:33:52] always do all right
[1:33:56] amen
[1:33:59] praise the Lord I'm so glad that I'm on
[1:34:02] the other side of that right now
[1:34:04] amen because was it when I was in the
[1:34:06] world this is when I was in the world I
[1:34:08] wore a shirt says See No Evil Hear No
[1:34:10] Evil do no evil think no evil have no
[1:34:14] fun
[1:34:15] that's what I wore
[1:34:17] yeah but I found out that it wasn't so
[1:34:20] fun
[1:34:21] it wasn't so much fun it left you
[1:34:23] completely empty and Barren now I
[1:34:25] realize Lord help me I don't want to see
[1:34:27] any evil I don't think any evil
[1:34:31] I got us a t-shirt brother Glenn
[1:34:34] I got as a t-shirt
[1:34:37] See No Evil Hear No Evil think no evil
[1:34:40] have a lot of fun

[1:34:50] evil thing no wrong do no wrong and I'll
[1:34:52] tell you what you're going to have a
[1:34:53] whole lot of fun it's going to be a
[1:34:54] whole lot of fun
[1:34:55] that's right
[1:34:58] amen because that other one is a lie of
[1:35:01] the devil
[1:35:02] that's the devil's life thinking
[1:35:04] you're gonna have no it's all a lot of
[1:35:07] devil praise the Lord
[1:35:08] praise the homily believes we need the
[1:35:10] faith of God on the Forefront to quench
[1:35:12] every fiery Dart that the devil throws
[1:35:14] at you how many believes this on a daily
[1:35:15] basis
[1:35:16] every day you gotta have your card up
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:21] whatever comes our way coffee is more
[1:35:23] than able to handle it because it was by
[1:35:26] faith that the Bible says by by faith
[1:35:28] God framed the whole world
[1:35:31] do you realize this whole planet the
[1:35:33] Stars everything was put there by God's
[1:35:36] faith and now that faith is in you
[1:35:39] what kind of world can you create
[1:35:42] ask anything in my name I will do it
[1:35:49] amen
[1:35:51] with you nothing shall be impossible
[1:35:53] Jesus said
[1:35:56] how many believes we ought to be Mighty
[1:35:57] we ought to be up there flying into
[1:35:58] Heavens president we're Eagle we're
[1:36:00] astronauts brother Austin
[1:36:03] we're not just Earthbound creatures
[1:36:05] we're not we're driving the airplanes
[1:36:06] anymore we're not driving these little
[1:36:08] old Jets we're not driving the
[1:36:10] supersonic B-52s
[1:36:13] no where is she we're in the spacecraft
[1:36:16] up there on the outside Realms of any
[1:36:19] kind of thing that pulls us back and our
[1:36:21] speed is unlimited
[1:36:23] let me believe that that's how many
[1:36:24] wants to live there
[1:36:26] there's no telling what God will do
[1:36:28] you'll just have faith in him
[1:36:30] and you will quench all the fiery darts
[1:36:36] the devil throw you away
[1:36:39] I think Brother David said many times
[1:36:41] man where would we be Brother David if
[1:36:43] it wasn't for God's mercy and Grace the
[1:36:46] faith that God put down in our hearts
[1:36:48] amen

[1:37:56] that's the exciting thinking that he
[1:37:57] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:37:59] world he thought of you before the
[1:38:01] foundation of the world he knew who he
[1:38:03] was he knew what your name would be
[1:38:07] he knew who your mom and daddy would be
[1:38:10] he knew you'd sit in church he knew all
[1:38:13] about it

[1:38:28] you
[1:38:29] he's got you
[1:38:31] he gonna take care of you he began a
[1:38:33] good work in you and he promised he
[1:38:35] would perform it till the day of Jesus
[1:38:36] Christ
[1:38:38] whoa come on people and I'm excited this
[1:38:41] Little Flower I think
[1:38:44] he's gonna
[1:38:45] take care of you
[1:38:47] you've got that faith in that belief
[1:38:48] folks that's sorrow just Vanishing me
[1:38:52] that fear just vanished away
[1:38:55] amen God bless you tonight how many once
[1:38:58] more
[1:38:59] for those weapons you want everyone to
[1:39:01] be diligent
[1:39:03] vigilant
[1:39:04] because you're adversary the devil
[1:39:06] that's a roaring lion he don't sled up
[1:39:08] slow up or nothing but guess what are
[1:39:12] you with me
[1:39:13] let's kill him where he stands
[1:39:17] let's kill him in these tracks stop him
[1:39:20] I think he said but let's say kill him
[1:39:21] stop him in these tracks just like Jesus
[1:39:24] did
[1:39:25] how many how did Jesus do it
[1:39:28] the word of God
[1:39:30] the word of God will defeat the enemy
[1:39:32] Anytime Anyplace under any conditions
[1:39:35] however
[1:39:36] brother Branham also said that the faith
[1:39:40] the sword of the spirit
[1:39:41] I didn't cover that did I
[1:39:45] I'm going to cover that yet let me
[1:39:47] finish it then I'll be done
[1:39:49] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:39:51] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:39:55] God
[1:39:56] how many but he's got to take the sword
[1:39:57] of the spirit
[1:39:58] a lot of people just got emotions they
[1:40:01] got a lot of spirit they don't have the
[1:40:02] sword of the spirit
[1:40:03] the sword of spirit is the word when the
[1:40:05] Devil comes and meets you you better
[1:40:06] have the word of God and you tell him
[1:40:08] the word of God
[1:40:10] you get sick or something you said the
[1:40:12] word of God said by his stripes I am
[1:40:14] healed
[1:40:16] the devil tries to tell you you ain't
[1:40:17] one of God yes I have accepted Calvary
[1:40:19] and I know that he said he that
[1:40:22] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:40:23] shall he live
[1:40:25] shall have eternal life just use the
[1:40:27] word God it'll cut him but like
[1:40:30] I said as the prophet said that sword is
[1:40:33] only as good
[1:40:35] as the arm that wields it
[1:40:37] how many believe that
[1:40:39] if you got a weak arm and you just can't
[1:40:41] barely wheel it
[1:40:43] it's not gonna do too much is it it's
[1:40:45] got to be a strong arm of faith that
[1:40:48] wields that sword
[1:40:55] remember Josh lame man
[1:40:58] he didn't have to have to let me go pray
[1:40:59] about it
[1:41:00] now he was prayed out he had perceived
[1:41:04] that that guy had Faith to believe
[1:41:06] to heal he says it's silver and gold
[1:41:08] have a none but such as I have I give to
[1:41:10] you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up
[1:41:12] and walk
[1:41:14] and he leaked up and walked isn't that
[1:41:16] right Joshua he didn't have to have a
[1:41:19] prayer meeting he had faith
[1:41:20] amen
[1:41:22] and he said Son stand still
[1:41:25] now I don't know about you but I can't
[1:41:26] help but believe it was the inspiration
[1:41:28] of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:30] speaking
[1:41:32] and God heard and he stopped it
[1:41:37] mighty mighty faith in the word of God
[1:41:39] Jesus when he said to the devil remember
[1:41:41] the devil came to him he says you you're
[1:41:43] hungry after 40 days of fasting in
[1:41:46] Matthew 5 I believe
[1:41:47] it is he's just if that be the Christ
[1:41:50] command these songs to be made into
[1:41:52] bread
[1:41:53] huh
[1:41:55] Jesus knew it was nothing but a trick
[1:41:59] he said the word of God says man shall
[1:42:02] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:42:04] word of God
[1:42:05] brother Brown says man he tried it again
[1:42:07] with pride amen popularity I'll give you
[1:42:10] all the kingdoms of the
[1:42:12] world and so forth he got he come up
[1:42:15] against uh big old high-powered
[1:42:18] electrical line that right the devil
[1:42:21] grabbed the hold he coming he got a
[1:42:22] shock of his life brother bam says he
[1:42:24] got his feathers singed that day
[1:42:28] how many beliefs today I was going to
[1:42:29] get his feathers singed by those
[1:42:32] by you and I
[1:42:34] faith in almighty God he's going to get
[1:42:36] his feathers singed once again when he
[1:42:38] comes at you remember this now if you
[1:42:40] don't get nothing else amen when he
[1:42:41] comes at you is something Singh Is
[1:42:44] feathers
[1:42:46] amen tell him to go back where he come
[1:42:49] from
[1:42:50] get thee behind me say how many believes
