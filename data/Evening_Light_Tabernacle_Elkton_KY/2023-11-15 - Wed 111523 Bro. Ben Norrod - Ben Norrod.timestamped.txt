[50:04] you amen certainly uh appreciate the

[50:10] thank you to brother berer for allowing
[50:11] us to come by we uh we've been trying to
[50:14] put together some time together and then
[50:16] it just had my schedule and his schedule
[50:18] haven't been able to cooperate so if you
[50:21] haven't seen me for a while it ain't
[50:22] because anybody's mad at anybody or
[50:24] anything's negative was having just busy
[50:26] people for the Lord and uh but I'm
[50:29] thrilled when I got the text to say hey
[50:31] would you could be able to come by and I
[50:32] was able to I was just thrilled about it
[50:35] and uh I I guess you all know how I feel
[50:37] about you I love every one of you and I
[50:39] enjoy getting to come here and preach
[50:40] the word of the Lord to you
[50:43] now I want to try if God will help me
[50:45] I've got several places that I'm going
[50:47] to try to go and I'm going to be very
[50:49] mindful at that time I'm I'm I'm bad
[50:51] about a clock and I don't mean to be but
[50:53] I am sometimes but um I I want to see if
[50:57] we can't maybe talk tonight a little bit
[50:59] about how we can obtain the favor of the
[51:02] Lord how do I know that I've got God
[51:04] favor and so if you have your Bible
[51:06] let's start in Isaiah chapter 64 verse
[51:11] 6 I'll read just one verse there and
[51:14] then we're going to skip over
[51:15] momentarily over to um uh go backwards
[51:18] to the Book of Genesis for just a
[51:24] bit
[51:27] my the Lord is so good to us is it good
[51:30] to be in church on a Wednesday I love
[51:32] Wednesday church one of my
[51:35] favorites it's one of the people you
[51:37] know you really make an effort and you
[51:39] really have to kind of work at it to get
[51:41] to church you know that and uh
[51:43] Wednesdays are they're they're a special
[51:46] time I really feel like the Lord speaks
[51:47] to the people lot almost more personally
[51:50] in some ways on Wednesdays than he does
[51:51] a Sunday get a lot of other people in
[51:54] you know maybe they're not is committed
[51:56] or dedicated and they used to say that
[51:57] the Wednesday night crowd that's the
[51:59] real crowd of the church you know what
[52:00] I'm talking about that's the real
[52:02] committed ones amen so maybe that's true
[52:05] maybe that's true all right Isaiah 64
[52:08] verse
[52:09] 6 and then uh
[52:12] uh you know maybe I'll just quote
[52:14] Genesis to you we we I won't make you
[52:16] read that much Isaiah 646 but we are all
[52:20] as an unclean thing and all of our
[52:24] righteousnesses look at that in the
[52:26] plural are as filthy rags and we all do
[52:30] Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like
[52:33] the wind have taken us away now the word
[52:36] he uses here for unclean in the original
[52:39] Hebrew is to be unclean or impure both
[52:43] ethically and religiously and what that
[52:46] means when you say ethically means your
[52:49] morals the kind of person you are your
[52:51] behaviors of Life patterns of life so in
[52:54] everything that a person does no matter
[52:56] how they was raised no matter who their
[52:59] parents were no matter what kind of home
[53:01] they come from everything in their life
[53:04] is unclean in the eyes of God so you
[53:07] could be raised in a message home be
[53:09] raised in a message Church be raised
[53:11] around the truth and the eyes of God
[53:13] still unclean why it takes the new birth
[53:15] to fix that but then you flip that
[53:17] little coin over and on the other side
[53:19] you've got the religious side of it now
[53:22] whether we realize this or not people
[53:24] religion can absolutely make you unclean
[53:28] in the presence of the Lord wrong
[53:31] religion false religion false Doctrine
[53:34] things that are doctrines of devils we
[53:36] would say those things can absolutely
[53:40] make you unclean before the presence of
[53:42] the Lord because remember doctrines of
[53:44] devils come in a religious form come
[53:47] through religious organizations and
[53:49] those things but greater than that
[53:51] spirits that motivate those things can
[53:54] also make us Sun clean as well and those
[53:57] kind of spirits are the very things that
[53:59] show up around the ranks of the truth we
[54:01] believe so just because we're not
[54:03] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian over the
[54:05] door like that doesn't mean we can't be
[54:07] unclean and it doesn't mean we don't
[54:09] need to be delivered of even religious
[54:11] hpe Spirits let's let's pray over the
[54:12] word can we heavenly father thank you so
[54:15] much for the opportunity to come back
[54:18] into your house Lord It's just so nice
[54:20] to be back here with the people in Elton
[54:22] and I just pray that you'll come and
[54:25] take your word this evening Lord and
[54:27] that you'll just so speak to us God that
[54:30] we'll be able to just kind of for this
[54:33] little moment of time that you give us
[54:34] just to be able to set aside all the
[54:36] weights and the things of the day that
[54:38] Lord would weigh on us father May the
[54:41] Holy Spirit I pray just come into this
[54:42] little church tonight not only anoint
[54:45] your word to our hearts to be able to
[54:47] speak it that that we might be a conduit
[54:51] if you would uh Channel Lord Jesus even
[54:54] but father that you would open up every
[54:57] heart Lord don't let us just sit here
[55:00] and hear but let us be able to receive
[55:02] it I pray and then Lord may you anoint
[55:05] that deep within our spirits that it'll
[55:07] bring change to us change positive
[55:09] change that'll make us more like you for
[55:12] Lord we are so very thankful for the
[55:14] grace you show to us and Lord I'm
[55:16] humbled tonight to be able to stand
[55:18] before this great body of people Lord
[55:20] you know I love these people so very
[55:22] much and I pray that you'll bless them
[55:24] in a great way
[55:25] be brother sister b as they travel in
[55:27] the different ones and the needs of the
[55:29] body and help us now in the word as we
[55:30] commit this to you now Lord in Jesus
[55:33] Christ's name amen and amen all of the
[55:35] Saints said am amen you may be seated
[55:38] may the Lord bless you amen we certainly
[55:41] thank the Lord for uh the reading of the
[55:43] Bible I like the Bible don't you I like
[55:46] it it's a beautiful beautiful written
[55:49] body of God and the work that the Lord
[55:52] put into making this accessible to us
[55:55] you know it's hard for some people to
[55:58] understand why that people would
[55:59] appreciate is this but the Revelation
[56:02] thereof that comes from the Bible just
[56:05] gives us all of the answers that we have
[56:07] need of in this last time to know where
[56:10] we come from who we are and where we're
[56:12] headed to in a little while and I think
[56:14] every answer that we have need of is
[56:17] laying right in the word of God whatever
[56:19] question you might have or whatever
[56:21] thought you might have about something
[56:23] in the word of God there there's always
[56:25] a Bible answer if there's a Bible
[56:28] question brother B said it there has to
[56:30] be a Bible answer somewhere because
[56:32] God's word don't return back to us void
[56:35] and you know I I I I look at this in
[56:38] Isaiah 64 and I I see many many many
[56:42] many different things that I'm
[56:43] confronted with as I travel and believe
[56:46] me what I tell you I could stand here
[56:47] the entire night and just tell one story
[56:50] after another about churches and the
[56:52] conditions they get into and people and
[56:53] their mindsets and on and on and on and
[56:56] and and quite honestly it would be nice
[56:58] to hear it but it doesn't really answer
[57:00] the question that we need to ask tonight
[57:02] and I I don't want to use this as a
[57:04] platform tonight to just basically you
[57:08] know pin us down that we are unclean
[57:12] people and that you know we need the
[57:13] Holy Ghost I I think you know I've
[57:16] preached to you long enough the last 20
[57:18] years brother B brother Brad and these
[57:20] different men of God have preached to
[57:21] you long enough that I'm pretty sure you
[57:23] know already kind of where you stand
[57:25] there but what I want to do is I want to
[57:27] use this scripture as a uh kind of a a
[57:32] springboard if you will into answering
[57:35] this question about how do I obtain the
[57:38] favor of God and so let me go ahead and
[57:41] answer it early now if this was a big
[57:43] Evangelistic meeting I'd make you wait
[57:44] three days before I answer this question
[57:46] but I figured that I'd be nice to you
[57:48] you're tired you've worked all day I'll
[57:49] go ahead and answer it ahead of time the
[57:51] answer is you cannot obtain the favor of
[57:54] God it's impossible within yourself
[57:57] there's no way that you could be living
[58:00] close enough or whatever it might be to
[58:03] God would show favor to you in the way
[58:05] of yourself because this scripture this
[58:07] Bible verse tells us that all of us are
[58:10] in an unclean situation so then then we
[58:14] have to ask the question to follow that
[58:16] okay then how could God show favor to me
[58:19] how does the Lord give his favor to me
[58:22] how do I become a child that is
[58:24] favorable his eyes now when I went back
[58:27] and I did a little study on this uh word
[58:30] favor I you know sometimes as a minister
[58:33] you'll Chase maybe a an idea of
[58:35] something down through the Bible or
[58:36] through the message and you know a lot
[58:38] of times you see repetitive things that
[58:40] you know and you've read it a thousand
[58:42] times and oh yes I know that I know
[58:44] that's right and so forth but I was
[58:46] surprised when I got to looking at this
[58:49] word favor that
[58:51] 156 times in the New Testament
[58:54] everywhere you would find favor Grace
[58:56] would be right there by it and when I
[58:58] saw that it's like the light bulbs come
[59:00] on and everything lit up around me and I
[59:02] understood this is the answer to the
[59:05] question tonight about the favor of God
[59:07] it all comes to the grace that God has
[59:10] given to all of us before the foundation
[59:13] of the world before we could become
[59:14] Sinners before our family lme family
[59:16] tree and all of that he gave us Grace to
[59:19] be the kind of people that we need to be
[59:22] now saying all of that you know a
[59:24] Believer I know that it kindly puts us
[59:27] in a bit of a spot because you know you
[59:29] hear so much preaching on the legalistic
[59:31] side of it or on the work side of it
[59:33] that you got to live right and live
[59:34] clean and live holy and you and I both I
[59:37] think we've been acquainted enough with
[59:39] each other through the years that we
[59:40] both know where we stand there that the
[59:42] Holy Spirit wants you to live right and
[59:44] live clean and be a Christian but that
[59:47] within itself does not get God's
[59:49] attention nor obtain his favor someone
[59:51] that knows how to dress right could
[59:53] absolutely know know how to dress right
[59:56] and be absolutely a sinner and still in
[59:58] their heart somebody that knows how to
[59:59] do all the talking and the terminology
[1:00:01] and have all the doctrines figured out
[1:00:03] they could do all of that and even Paul
[1:00:05] said I could have all of that figured
[1:00:07] out and still not have the love of God
[1:00:10] inside my heart so there are elements of
[1:00:13] living right that's true and we believe
[1:00:15] in that and we want to live right we
[1:00:17] want to be Christians in that way but
[1:00:19] when it comes to obtaining the favor of
[1:00:22] God there is nothing that you and I can
[1:00:24] do within ourselves because of this
[1:00:26] scripture right here to ever obtain that
[1:00:28] within ourselves being born off the tree
[1:00:31] of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:00:33] immediately and absolutely puts us in a
[1:00:35] position where we are not able to match
[1:00:38] that part of God's holiness there's no
[1:00:40] way our birth our natural first birth
[1:00:42] takes us out of that category altogether
[1:00:45] which is why Jesus had to come be virgin
[1:00:47] born so that he could take upon himself
[1:00:50] the ability to bridge that Chasm between
[1:00:52] man and God so then we see that when the
[1:00:56] Holy Spirit then would say to us that we
[1:00:59] would have his favor he's saying to us
[1:01:02] that you have my grace and my grace is
[1:01:05] my favor to you I'm so glad about that I
[1:01:08] don't even know how to explain how it
[1:01:10] makes me feel that God's favor is the
[1:01:13] favor of God or the grace of God that
[1:01:16] not only keeps me living right but every
[1:01:18] time I would decide or think you know
[1:01:21] maybe I I would go this way or that way
[1:01:23] or choose this road or that road the
[1:01:26] favor of God the grace of God is what
[1:01:28] keeps me right smack in the middle of
[1:01:31] the will of God aren't you glad for that
[1:01:32] friends because without that where would
[1:01:34] you
[1:01:35] be without God's grace and favor upon
[1:01:38] you what decision would you have made
[1:01:40] even this week perhaps that would have
[1:01:42] taken you completely away from your walk
[1:01:44] with God from the presence of the Lord
[1:01:46] or whatever it might be the Lord Jesus
[1:01:49] is determined to make sure that the
[1:01:52] people of God have the ability to serve
[1:01:55] him no matter what's going on around
[1:01:57] them no matter what is inside of them no
[1:01:59] matter what family battles they might
[1:02:01] have personal battles they might have
[1:02:03] mental battles they might have Jesus is
[1:02:05] determined that you and I will be able
[1:02:07] to serve him at full capacity he wants
[1:02:10] us to be able to express oursel as true
[1:02:12] believers in the Holy Ghost his favor is
[1:02:15] what brings us there because your Works
[1:02:18] cannot keep you there your Works may put
[1:02:21] you in a place where I'm doing pretty
[1:02:23] good this week but your Works cannot
[1:02:25] keep you there Hallelujah and praise the
[1:02:28] Lord I haven't been gone so long from
[1:02:30] you You' forgotten how to say Amen have
[1:02:32] you aha okay all right all right just
[1:02:36] checking just making sure checking the
[1:02:38] water the temperature you know because
[1:02:40] this is something that really kind of
[1:02:41] gets next to some people because they
[1:02:44] think well to get God's favor and to
[1:02:46] Lord for him to show favor to me for
[1:02:48] healing or some other thing like that
[1:02:50] I've got to live to such a place to
[1:02:52] where God's just going to oh my he's is
[1:02:54] going to look at me and think what a boy
[1:02:55] what a
[1:02:57] girl you might achieve that this week by
[1:03:00] next week it's
[1:03:01] gone you may achieve it and within five
[1:03:04] minutes completely fail it so God's
[1:03:06] favor is based upon that we're all in
[1:03:10] trouble so God cannot base his favor
[1:03:13] upon those things now if you're reading
[1:03:16] from The Book of Genesis I'll just give
[1:03:18] you the scripture just to kind of
[1:03:19] highlight the scripture for you and you
[1:03:21] can write this down Genesis 18:3 when
[1:03:23] God is when Abraham is speaking back to
[1:03:26] God he said now my Lord if I have found
[1:03:29] favor in thy sight he said pass not away
[1:03:32] if I found favor in thy sight so in
[1:03:35] other words Abraham making this very
[1:03:36] simple statement that if I have found
[1:03:38] favor in your sight now now now think
[1:03:41] about this for just a moment the father
[1:03:43] of our faith I'm about Father Abraham
[1:03:46] the foundation and the basis of
[1:03:50] Christianity the the Covenant that God
[1:03:53] made with this man was not based upon
[1:03:56] him as a human being because not only
[1:03:59] would Abraham lie the first time around
[1:04:01] but after his name would be changed he'd
[1:04:03] lie the second time he would have all
[1:04:05] kinds of little fears and things that
[1:04:07] would be accompanied with the the the
[1:04:09] whole scene of this you know body change
[1:04:11] and Isaac coming along and then here he
[1:04:13] is nice and strong and healthy and all
[1:04:15] this going on and Sarah says uh take
[1:04:19] Hagar and he says okay yeah sure no
[1:04:22] problem now you I looking at that we
[1:04:25] think what's the matter with this man
[1:04:26] doesn't doesn't he have any idea how God
[1:04:29] has talked to him all along about Isaac
[1:04:31] and yet here this wild man is being
[1:04:34] produced oh you're going to be in hard
[1:04:36] trouble there legalist if you kind of
[1:04:38] hold to those
[1:04:39] works it's going to put you in a bad
[1:04:41] spot because then here you got God
[1:04:43] coming along not not long after we see
[1:04:46] the establishment of Abraham in his
[1:04:48] faith say I could swear by no greater so
[1:04:52] therefore I swore by the only one I
[1:04:53] could
[1:04:55] me God said I swore by myself we know
[1:04:59] already that he cannot trust our fair
[1:05:01] weather Behavior woo preach to me
[1:05:04] somebody we already know that he can't
[1:05:06] put confidence in our ups and our Downs
[1:05:09] cuz whether we're born again or not that
[1:05:11] do not really the part of it we we live
[1:05:14] in this outer realm holy ghost or not
[1:05:16] every human being lives in this outer
[1:05:18] realm whether it's sunny days and rainy
[1:05:20] days and windy days and we go through
[1:05:22] all of that every person on this Earth
[1:05:25] has trials tribulations and problems and
[1:05:28] ups and down everybody you talk to has
[1:05:29] got an issue everybody you meet in the
[1:05:32] store out on your job or something like
[1:05:34] that everybody you meet has got a
[1:05:35] problem somewhere but the difference
[1:05:37] between them and us is we have an anchor
[1:05:40] beyond the veils and that's what holds
[1:05:43] us which is different than everybody
[1:05:45] else amen hallelujah which is what puts
[1:05:49] us in the condition of having God's
[1:05:51] favor not just when everything is going
[1:05:54] well but when everything is going bad
[1:05:57] too and the church said
[1:06:00] amen right now let's look at something
[1:06:04] for just a moment now in a message
[1:06:07] called works that I do brother R says
[1:06:09] that if I had Divine love and Fa favor
[1:06:12] of God that the Lord would give gifts
[1:06:16] into the person I want you to think
[1:06:19] about this in in in the way of gifted
[1:06:22] people a lot of times s when you see
[1:06:24] gifts in operation folks have a tendency
[1:06:27] to kind of almost view somebody that is
[1:06:30] gifted as though that they are special
[1:06:34] in the eyes of the Lord in comparison to
[1:06:36] somebody else they view brother Bram a
[1:06:39] lot this way that brother Brown was a
[1:06:41] special Christian that had special
[1:06:43] things that nobody else had and somehow
[1:06:46] brother Brown must have had a different
[1:06:47] Holy Ghost than you and I had or a
[1:06:49] different New Birth than you and I had
[1:06:50] his new birth was special ours is just
[1:06:52] kind of the hand-me-down version that we
[1:06:54] get just barely to make it through the
[1:06:56] way that they exalt this prophet and
[1:06:58] place him way up so high on this pestal
[1:07:01] like this it goes to prove that their
[1:07:03] idea of God's favor is a respective
[1:07:07] person's type
[1:07:08] favor amen you'll see a lot of that in
[1:07:10] churches certain families you know that
[1:07:12] the Lord they blessed them or gift them
[1:07:14] or something like that if folks are not
[1:07:16] careful friends and practice the proper
[1:07:18] kind of humility that a Christian needs
[1:07:20] to practice they can intimidate other
[1:07:22] people in the church to make them feel
[1:07:24] like that they do not have favor with
[1:07:27] God the same as they do so gifts have to
[1:07:30] be understood you have to understand
[1:07:32] that A Gifted person or a gifted family
[1:07:35] or a gifted life that is not a sign that
[1:07:39] God's favor is greater in them than it
[1:07:42] is greater in you God's favor or his
[1:07:45] grace May provide the ability for them
[1:07:48] to uh exercise or demonstrate a gift or
[1:07:51] do something for the Lord but that is
[1:07:53] not the same kind of Grace that is
[1:07:55] applied when it comes to their soul
[1:07:57] because Grace a gift a person pardon me
[1:08:02] could send themselves to hell with the
[1:08:04] Divine gift of God they could absolutely
[1:08:07] send themselves to hell with a Divine
[1:08:10] gift gifted people don't mean save
[1:08:14] people praise the
[1:08:16] Lord gifted people don't always mean
[1:08:19] spiritual
[1:08:21] people I'm waiting on you now now think
[1:08:23] about it we look at so many gifted
[1:08:26] people and we say oh my they must have
[1:08:28] some special relationship with God do
[1:08:31] you realize that all of the experiences
[1:08:33] that brother Ram had it might have been
[1:08:36] different but it wasn't
[1:08:40] greater the experiences I've had with
[1:08:42] the Lord are just as precious to me as
[1:08:46] every experience he ever had with
[1:08:48] God and just because he saw visions and
[1:08:51] talked to angels that doesn't make it
[1:08:53] greater or better than when the Lord
[1:08:56] Jesus met me as a sinner boy and filled
[1:08:59] me with the Holy Ghost and the multiple
[1:09:01] times that he has talked to me and led
[1:09:03] me and showed me things that
[1:09:05] succumb it means just as much to me as
[1:09:08] it did to brother Brandon even though
[1:09:10] the experiences may be a little
[1:09:12] different here or there not one is
[1:09:14] greater than the other now in terms of
[1:09:17] office Behavior now you're getting into
[1:09:20] a different thing you're leaving this
[1:09:22] idea of God's favor and now you're
[1:09:24] talking about God's
[1:09:27] adoption adoption is based upon your
[1:09:32] behavior you want God to trust you you
[1:09:35] got to show them you can that's right
[1:09:38] but you can be saved even if you're not
[1:09:39] behaving
[1:09:41] well how many Sinners do you know that
[1:09:43] got the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost they wasn't behaving like they
[1:09:47] should still had a lot of things to fix
[1:09:50] probably didn't know what the right
[1:09:51] Behavior was about nothing and yet the
[1:09:53] Lord filled him with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] anyways that has nothing to do with
[1:10:00] salvation forgive me it's not of works
[1:10:02] that any man can boast
[1:10:05] amen but if I want to show God that I
[1:10:07] can be placed as a son but it can trust
[1:10:10] me
[1:10:12] put now I got to behave right I got to
[1:10:16] repent keep things out of my
[1:10:21] heart sure brother
[1:10:24] office was higher than
[1:10:26] mine his office was higher than
[1:10:29] yours but his holy ghost
[1:10:33] wasn't amen same Holy Ghost Paul Peter
[1:10:38] Donn James all them same Holy Ghost
[1:10:41] James was a Pastor Peter was an
[1:10:43] evangelist an apostle Paul was the
[1:10:45] messenger of the age all same Holy Ghost
[1:10:48] different
[1:10:50] offices offices does not mean
[1:10:54] that you are better or less than
[1:10:56] somebody
[1:10:59] else uhuh oh don't don't don't get in a
[1:11:02] hurry now I'm not going to rush this one
[1:11:03] I want this to sink in good we will look
[1:11:06] at ourselves well I'm just a little old
[1:11:09] house wife that doesn't mean you have
[1:11:11] less of God's
[1:11:14] favor uhhuh doesn't mean that God looks
[1:11:17] at you
[1:11:19] differently excuse me he doesn't God
[1:11:22] does not look at you differently
[1:11:24] as a housewife or a painter or a factory
[1:11:26] worker or a preacher or a
[1:11:31] prophet amen you're all the same to
[1:11:35] him there's one body of Christ that
[1:11:37] members in
[1:11:39] particular he even went on and said that
[1:11:41] there's not even male or female in the
[1:11:42] body of Christ come on don't get quiet
[1:11:44] on
[1:11:45] me when it comes to my office I have a
[1:11:49] position that a a role if you will that
[1:11:51] I have to play a part that God gives me
[1:11:54] but that has nothing to do with his
[1:11:56] Divine favor toward me as his
[1:12:02] son
[1:12:03] uhuh oh but you say brother BNA but as
[1:12:07] Christians aren't we supposed to you
[1:12:10] know be these powerful people yeah are
[1:12:14] we supposed to have third pool spoken
[1:12:16] word power yeah I supposed to have all
[1:12:18] that
[1:12:20] too what about the
[1:12:22] ability to be able to restore missing
[1:12:29] limbs all of that comes through
[1:12:32] obedience to Christ in a daily
[1:12:36] walk listen
[1:12:38] close but if someone walked up here
[1:12:40] right now missing a limb and 10 or 15 of
[1:12:44] us got together through prayer spoke the
[1:12:46] word of God and a limb was restored
[1:12:48] right here in front of us that has
[1:12:49] nothing to do with the condition of my
[1:12:52] soul
[1:12:55] I could be a hypocrite and God honor
[1:13:01] Faith are you say where you get this
[1:13:03] from and the only ones at the end
[1:13:04] time B tells us over and over again in
[1:13:07] the last day that's the deception that
[1:13:10] people can fulfill offices but not be
[1:13:13] spiritual people themselves that's right
[1:13:16] my behavior determines whether I'm truly
[1:13:19] predestinated but not all of my behavior
[1:13:21] says whether I'm predestinated right or
[1:13:23] not
[1:13:24] cuz there going to be times that I'm not
[1:13:26] always going to do it
[1:13:27] right times I'm going to have to repent
[1:13:31] times I'm going to have to learn grow
[1:13:33] develop what y'all look at me like that
[1:13:35] for y'all don't know what I'm talking
[1:13:38] about that's going to be times that
[1:13:40] we're going to have to expand our
[1:13:42] thinking to know the greater revelation
[1:13:45] of what's going on in our life and we're
[1:13:47] going to have to cry we're going to have
[1:13:48] to fast we're going to have to work and
[1:13:50] labor to understand that Revelation
[1:13:52] deeper in our
[1:13:54] heart but that has nothing to do with
[1:13:57] God's
[1:13:58] favor his favor is placed on us before
[1:14:01] we ever even make a
[1:14:04] move so it's important to separate
[1:14:07] offices and gifts from the favor of
[1:14:10] God let's think about it friends when
[1:14:13] those Millions will come before him at
[1:14:15] the white Throne judgment there'll be
[1:14:17] preachers stand there and say I preached
[1:14:19] all over the
[1:14:20] world I cast out Devils I done Great
[1:14:23] Mighty
[1:14:25] things and he looks right down and says
[1:14:27] but I I didn't even know
[1:14:30] you right all the things You' done it
[1:14:32] might have been great to you might have
[1:14:34] been great for somebody else but to
[1:14:36] me I didn't even know
[1:14:40] you that attitude in itself is why we
[1:14:43] will take gifted people or people with a
[1:14:46] good
[1:14:47] behavior well they must have better
[1:14:49] favor from God and Faith changes based
[1:14:52] on color of skin amount of money in the
[1:14:54] bank
[1:14:55] what faith is Faith no matter where it
[1:14:59] comes from it's
[1:15:00] faith and God's favor is given to us in
[1:15:04] spite of our own
[1:15:06] behavior now whether he's going to trust
[1:15:08] us with more that depends on whether we
[1:15:10] want to live right and we to apply
[1:15:11] oursel to the things of God but the
[1:15:14] condition of my soul has nothing to do
[1:15:16] with my
[1:15:20] behavior you say that ain't true it is
[1:15:22] true Paul said Grace is a free gift not
[1:15:27] of works that any man can boast amen now
[1:15:30] if you say Amen to that we can get to
[1:15:31] this next part pretty easy now if you're
[1:15:34] struggling with that part that just
[1:15:35] means you got no legalistic thing still
[1:15:37] stuck up in here and you need to get
[1:15:38] that out of your heart and mind because
[1:15:40] your Works has nothing to do with
[1:15:42] salvation if you could it defeats the
[1:15:44] very purpose brother Joe defeats the
[1:15:46] purpose of Calvary for us to place
[1:15:48] ourself into the mode of
[1:15:50] Salvation how can I ever do anything to
[1:15:53] be saved
[1:15:55] myself you read the scripture yourself
[1:15:57] with me all of our
[1:16:00] righteousnesses PL are as filthy rags in
[1:16:03] the eyes of
[1:16:05] God well I've been raised in the message
[1:16:07] don't care my daddy was a preacher
[1:16:09] doesn't matter well I was a Deacon's kid
[1:16:12] it absolutely matters
[1:16:13] not what matters is did you accept that
[1:16:16] free gift into your heart and did you
[1:16:18] get
[1:16:20] saved amen and if you did then the Holy
[1:16:23] Ghost can take you from there and then
[1:16:25] guess what folks it's up to him to
[1:16:27] determine what our behavior is supposed
[1:16:28] to be like and if you're supposed to be
[1:16:30] a Christian Living Like a Christian and
[1:16:31] you're behaving badly daddy will
[1:16:35] take take care of
[1:16:37] that you don't ignore his kids he ain't
[1:16:40] one of these absentee fathers that's
[1:16:41] breaking bubbles on his telephone in the
[1:16:43] corner somewhere he pays attention to
[1:16:45] his boys and girls he don't let us just
[1:16:48] get away with anything that's the
[1:16:49] consolation I've got when it comes to
[1:16:51] living right Within Myself I know I
[1:16:54] can't do it but you said it sounds like
[1:16:56] we shouldn't even try of course we
[1:16:57] should try but we should also understand
[1:16:59] the limitation of that I can do my best
[1:17:02] but it will not be absolute I can put
[1:17:04] forth my best foot but that doesn't mean
[1:17:06] I'm always going to Champion the cause
[1:17:08] and win and overcome and many times I
[1:17:10] might try and end up failing down the
[1:17:12] road right amen but what keeps
[1:17:17] me grace of God Amen favor of
[1:17:22] God
[1:17:24] praise the
[1:17:25] Lord now listen to this life story I'd
[1:17:28] rather have favor with God than anything
[1:17:32] I know of in the
[1:17:36] world and if I've got favor with God I
[1:17:40] can serve his
[1:17:41] people right so having favor with the
[1:17:45] Lord gives me the ability somehow to
[1:17:49] show Grace to somebody else remember the
[1:17:51] parable Jesus used about the man that
[1:17:53] was forgiven of a great debt and then he
[1:17:56] turns around and grabs another that he
[1:17:57] owes the debt grabs him by the
[1:18:00] throat you know what Jesus said he said
[1:18:03] that all of those original creditors all
[1:18:05] them debts were
[1:18:06] called when that man turned around and
[1:18:09] done that to the other
[1:18:10] one because if Grace has been given to
[1:18:13] you then you should be able to pay it
[1:18:14] for
[1:18:16] it you got to be able to show it to
[1:18:18] somebody else friends let's just get it
[1:18:20] through our head some of the most
[1:18:21] unforgiving people in the world of
[1:18:23] church
[1:18:24] people they old grudges worse than
[1:18:27] anybody wo praise the
[1:18:30] Lord right supposed to be righteous
[1:18:32] religious holy forgiving loving just all
[1:18:35] of that and yet we are the most stubborn
[1:18:37] arrogant hard-hearted people on the
[1:18:39] planet religious people
[1:18:42] are boy when somebody offends us they've
[1:18:45] offended God
[1:18:46] hallelujah and if something happens to
[1:18:48] them you know they sit in the silence ah
[1:18:50] I knew it I knew when they looked at me
[1:18:53] fun in church the other day going to get
[1:18:56] cancer first of all big guy you ain't
[1:18:59] that
[1:19:01] important you're not as big in your mind
[1:19:03] as you think you are and it ain't God's
[1:19:05] business to go around smiting down every
[1:19:07] little kid that looks at you
[1:19:09] Crossways
[1:19:11] Hallelujah forgiveness and mercy is a
[1:19:13] much greater animal to to to to to to
[1:19:16] lean towards a greater experience that
[1:19:19] God would want to give us is the ability
[1:19:20] to forgive so deeply from our heart that
[1:19:23] it would be like Christ would forgive
[1:19:24] the church
[1:19:26] himself and if I've got his favor in my
[1:19:29] heart right if I understand this
[1:19:30] correctly then I can show favor to
[1:19:32] somebody
[1:19:33] else I could show Grace to them amen I
[1:19:37] had an experience just last weekend a
[1:19:40] certain thing had taken place and in my
[1:19:42] mind I thought th this is a almost a
[1:19:45] point of no return kind of thing and I
[1:19:48] was uh the little church I was preaching
[1:19:49] in Indianapolis last week in Indiana
[1:19:53] their piano player wasn't wasn't there
[1:19:55] and they asked me at the end of the
[1:19:56] service if I'd or during the service if
[1:19:57] I'd help them play and so I finished up
[1:20:00] the meeting and we were singing and
[1:20:02] things got to the very end of the
[1:20:03] service I slipped over to the piano and
[1:20:04] the brother that started leading singing
[1:20:06] was singing Grace Grace God's grace in
[1:20:10] my mind I was thinking about this
[1:20:11] individual in this situation and I
[1:20:13] thought that's too far gone and do you
[1:20:16] know that while I was sitting there on
[1:20:18] that piano the holy spirit said to
[1:20:20] me who puts you in
[1:20:24] charge of how much I'm able to forgive
[1:20:27] that's
[1:20:29] right sometimes when you get rebuked
[1:20:31] like that it wakes you up a little bit
[1:20:34] because you know we get Arrogant with
[1:20:36] this message we know all these things
[1:20:38] brother BR said about living right
[1:20:39] living holy and Living Clean on and on
[1:20:41] on we get Arrogant with it and the first
[1:20:43] little thing that happens in our home
[1:20:45] parents you know when it comes their
[1:20:46] kids do do a stupid kid
[1:20:49] things you know we call their hand on it
[1:20:53] we always throw about five quotes in
[1:20:55] there to make sure we punctuate it just
[1:20:56] right glory to God the prophet
[1:21:00] said but who forgives you when you do
[1:21:03] stupid parent things or stupid big
[1:21:05] person things or stupid Grandpa things
[1:21:07] or stupid Aunt things or Uncle things or
[1:21:12] hello right same Grace That Forgives
[1:21:16] them same Grace That Forgives us and if
[1:21:19] I hold it in my heart right then I can
[1:21:22] pay pay that Grace forward every time
[1:21:24] God gives it to me I can just share that
[1:21:25] much grace over with somebody
[1:21:27] [Applause]
[1:21:29] else
[1:21:32] Hallelujah you say is it important sure
[1:21:35] it is Jesus said if you don't forgive
[1:21:37] you can't be forgiven and brother
[1:21:39] Brenham said faith and forgiveness the
[1:21:41] relationship together that you cannot
[1:21:43] have true Faith unless you're willing to
[1:21:45] forgive from your heart things that
[1:21:46] other people have done to you even in
[1:21:49] the Lord's Prayer give us this day day
[1:21:51] by day our daily bread and for for give
[1:21:52] us of our debts as we forgive our
[1:21:54] debtors and our trespasses as we forgive
[1:21:56] our
[1:21:58] trespassers mercy and Grace that's the
[1:22:00] thing the Pharisees forgot about Jesus
[1:22:02] said they left off the weightier matters
[1:22:04] of the law forgiveness and love and
[1:22:07] mercy hey man now listen to this in me
[1:22:12] in the message from that time he says
[1:22:14] you'll never be able to get anything
[1:22:15] from God or have favor with God my
[1:22:17] brother sister ever who you are until we
[1:22:19] fully obey the word of God he said see
[1:22:22] you just make yourself miserable half
[1:22:23] heart he says
[1:22:27] now in order to put this quote in the
[1:22:29] right perspective we have to think of
[1:22:31] that term fully obeying the
[1:22:34] word and we have a problem if we try to
[1:22:36] put this you know in the context of
[1:22:39] saying okay full obedience to the word
[1:22:41] means I can never ever break it within
[1:22:46] myself that's
[1:22:48] impossible it's impossible to so live to
[1:22:51] a place to where you never do anything
[1:22:54] wrong now I don't believe that
[1:22:56] Christians lay in habitual sins and plan
[1:22:59] out evil things and you know live under
[1:23:02] the the umbrella of a bunch of Filth all
[1:23:04] the time but the prophet used it this
[1:23:07] way in questions and answers when they
[1:23:08] asked him about minor things he said I
[1:23:11] think that's the key to really focus on
[1:23:13] when it comes to a Christian Life and
[1:23:15] little bobles and mistakes he said it's
[1:23:17] the minor things you don't want to
[1:23:20] do you know like for example sitting a
[1:23:22] red light and somebody don't go too fast
[1:23:24] and you all instantly get mad and if
[1:23:26] you'd had a gun you might have shot at
[1:23:28] him get out of there go what's you
[1:23:29] waiting
[1:23:34] on ahead or the dog you
[1:23:38] know you get mad and kick the dog or
[1:23:40] kick the cat or some kind of a thing
[1:23:42] minor things I'm trying to be careful
[1:23:45] with that one because in this day and
[1:23:46] age kicking a dog and cat is not minded
[1:23:48] to a lot of people but but the point is
[1:23:51] true
[1:23:53] the idea becomes it's the little minor
[1:23:55] thing that these things are what we
[1:23:57] gauge many times whether we have God's
[1:24:00] favor in our life or not it has nothing
[1:24:02] to do with his
[1:24:05] favor but these little minor behavioral
[1:24:09] things are the very things that we say
[1:24:13] full obedience to the word but
[1:24:16] listen the Lord
[1:24:18] Jesus Hebrews 4:12 sees not only the
[1:24:21] action of it but the intention of
[1:24:24] it thank God he is the word that is a
[1:24:26] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:24:29] intents of the heart and you know why
[1:24:32] that he can reward people with the token
[1:24:35] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:36] fill them with the very life of God
[1:24:38] because he can see what their intention
[1:24:41] is hallelujah it ain't always what we do
[1:24:45] but it's what we intend to do glory to
[1:24:48] God that's what makes a bigger
[1:24:50] difference sometimes in whether God is
[1:24:52] going to reward us with Grace in an area
[1:24:55] or if he's going to correct
[1:24:57] us what was your intention I I you've
[1:25:00] heard me say it before when brother R
[1:25:01] went through that complex the Lord
[1:25:03] showed him a vision of him in a trash
[1:25:07] dump he was revealing to brother bradam
[1:25:09] this is where your intention will lead
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:13] you he said what you intend to do Billy
[1:25:16] won't stay with you said your wife will
[1:25:17] leave
[1:25:19] you his intention was going to get him
[1:25:21] in a lot of trouble what God could see
[1:25:23] brother Ram's intention and all of that
[1:25:25] would be created can he also see the
[1:25:27] intention of a person's heart Lord I
[1:25:30] want to serve you with everything I got
[1:25:31] in me I want to be an obedient Christian
[1:25:34] I don't want to be a a slacker or
[1:25:36] hitchhiker or halfway in or halfway out
[1:25:39] half-hearted I want to serve you with
[1:25:40] all of my heart can he not also see that
[1:25:43] glory and reward that intention as well
[1:25:47] I say he
[1:25:49] can praise the Lord
[1:25:53] now here's another aspect of the favor
[1:25:55] of God Victory Day brother says remember
[1:25:58] when
[1:26:00] God has counted you worthy he said I
[1:26:02] don't fail to get this when you have a
[1:26:05] trial or a test it shows you have found
[1:26:07] favor with
[1:26:09] God and God believes listen to this God
[1:26:13] believes that you'll stand the test
[1:26:19] amen lord it's not even what I believe
[1:26:22] you ask me sometimes if I'm in the
[1:26:24] middle of something how do you think
[1:26:25] you'll fair not too good if you ask my
[1:26:27] opinion matter of fact I may not even
[1:26:29] make it through this thing you know how
[1:26:32] some people are when you ask them how
[1:26:33] life is oh everything's a misery oh you
[1:26:37] know the one positive light that this
[1:26:39] nation has had in some of the people's
[1:26:41] attitude is they saw a poll the other
[1:26:43] day that Trump has finally Battleground
[1:26:45] States and now they're
[1:26:48] happy you go into a Walmart and they've
[1:26:50] reduced the price of egg no more EG
[1:26:52] flation now they're
[1:26:55] happy everything is based on some carnal
[1:26:58] reacted thing out here in the world some
[1:27:00] kind of reactionary thing in the
[1:27:05] world and they believe the nation will
[1:27:08] do good as long as they got their man in
[1:27:10] in
[1:27:11] power people like that at their jobs you
[1:27:13] know certain people in certain jobs ah
[1:27:17] the job's going to be
[1:27:20] great we have so much respect resp of
[1:27:22] persons when it comes to little matters
[1:27:24] of
[1:27:25] life because to
[1:27:28] us we gauge successes and victories and
[1:27:31] things like that based on what we
[1:27:34] believe something will
[1:27:36] be and there's many times you might
[1:27:39] believe that you're going to be a
[1:27:40] conqueror you believe you're going to
[1:27:41] whip the trial and you believe you're
[1:27:42] going to come out smelling like a
[1:27:45] rose and that'll be the very time that
[1:27:47] God puts the thing before you that you
[1:27:48] can't conquer you can't Whip and there
[1:27:50] ain't no roses within 100 miles of you
[1:27:53] that's
[1:27:54] right because Jesus I believe is
[1:27:57] determined to show this bride before we
[1:27:59] get out of here there's not one part of
[1:28:01] you that can be contributed into this
[1:28:03] [Applause]
[1:28:04] Rapture it's got to be completely
[1:28:07] surrendered but if you ask somebody's
[1:28:09] opinion about how today is going if
[1:28:13] they're looking at the stock market
[1:28:14] maybe they're having a good day in the
[1:28:15] NASDAQ so everything's going
[1:28:19] well what a flighty way to live
[1:28:22] live not spec of stability and that kind
[1:28:25] of
[1:28:27] stuff but when God believes something it
[1:28:30] ain't based on the numbers of the
[1:28:32] NASDAQ or who's winning the Battleground
[1:28:35] States or who's working that certain job
[1:28:37] or who's in command or what the
[1:28:40] inflation numbers are God don't look at
[1:28:42] none of that foolishness like
[1:28:44] that oh you I know that really okay so
[1:28:47] then apply it to you then if he's not
[1:28:50] affected by politics or the world
[1:28:52] economy or the cosmos around him what
[1:28:54] makes you think he's affected by that
[1:28:56] negative attitude you got or how low you
[1:28:58] think about yourself or how low down you
[1:29:02] think you really are or how you put
[1:29:03] yourself down in your own opinion wo
[1:29:06] preach brother
[1:29:08] Ben none of that affects
[1:29:11] him he looks down at you and he says
[1:29:14] that's my boy that's my girl I trust
[1:29:16] them to come through on the other side
[1:29:18] amen and if God believes it no matter
[1:29:21] what you believe about yourself it'll
[1:29:23] come out just that way that God
[1:29:27] said friends you know how it is
[1:29:31] sometimes if I was to base everything I
[1:29:34] did off how I felt about it there'd be a
[1:29:37] lot of things I'd never try to
[1:29:42] tackle but his
[1:29:44] faith is what gets us there his
[1:29:47] faith that's how we're saved his faith
[1:29:51] I'm not saved by by my faith I'm saved
[1:29:53] by his faith
[1:29:56] amen now Psalm
[1:30:00] 5:12 can I go a bit further thank
[1:30:06] you Psalm
[1:30:12] 512 for thou
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:15] Lord will bless the righteous with
[1:30:20] favor
[1:30:22] will thou Compass
[1:30:25] him as with a
[1:30:29] shield so now the favor of God is
[1:30:32] described to us as a
[1:30:37] shield you know the beautiful thing
[1:30:39] about a shield is it's
[1:30:41] two-sided kind of like the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a seal on
[1:30:46] the inside and it also shows on the
[1:30:48] outside the Seal of the Holy Ghost keeps
[1:30:50] the devil out
[1:30:52] but it also keeps you
[1:30:56] in oh now I know here's where the chair
[1:30:59] of them show
[1:31:00] up well now Brother pin I've never been
[1:31:03] tempted to go out I've never been
[1:31:05] tempted to tell a lie neither have you
[1:31:08] no I've never been tempted to quit aha
[1:31:11] don't lie in church it ain't a good look
[1:31:13] on you don't do it don't do
[1:31:15] it we're all tempted to go am we're all
[1:31:18] tempted to sway amen you say well I'm
[1:31:22] not you get discouraged enough let
[1:31:24] circumstances fall in a certain way and
[1:31:26] you'll have all them kind of thoughts
[1:31:28] flood through your
[1:31:29] mind why don't I just quit why don't I
[1:31:31] just give up what's the point what's the
[1:31:33] use okay so why don't you do
[1:31:37] it why are you still sitting
[1:31:40] here why after many years even are you
[1:31:43] still sitting
[1:31:46] here there is a shield Brother David God
[1:31:50] places this shield around us and this
[1:31:53] Shield is different than the shield of
[1:31:55] the spirit you see when Paul dresses us
[1:31:57] up we take the shield of the spirit for
[1:31:59] our protection we take that upon ourself
[1:32:03] but this Shield is even greater than our
[1:32:05] own because this is something that God
[1:32:07] does for us not us doing it for
[1:32:10] ourselves Hallelujah he places that
[1:32:13] great shield around us in protection and
[1:32:15] not only can the devil sometimes not
[1:32:17] even get to you but when you feel like
[1:32:20] well I'll just give up I'm going to go
[1:32:23] I'm going to do and you start walking
[1:32:25] and all of a sudden
[1:32:29] you when you start budding up against
[1:32:32] that Shield you find out quickly that
[1:32:34] the Lord ain't going to let you go no
[1:32:37] further then what he wants you to go
[1:32:40] amen so his Mercy his favor his grace is
[1:32:45] like a great shield around
[1:32:47] me why do some people just quit and
[1:32:51] succeed when they make that decision why
[1:32:53] do they succeed why do they quit and
[1:32:55] become the best quitter you've ever seen
[1:32:58] some of them are better quitters than
[1:32:59] they were church
[1:33:00] goers praise the Lord when they go to
[1:33:04] the world they go big time man they
[1:33:05] don't go
[1:33:06] halfway would to God they show that kind
[1:33:09] of spirit or initiative in church right
[1:33:11] but they don't they leave the message
[1:33:13] they leave the church they just go wild
[1:33:15] hog wow my granny used to
[1:33:17] say why don't you do
[1:33:20] that cuz there's a shield around you his
[1:33:24] favor is compassing you about like this
[1:33:26] and every time you start to make too
[1:33:28] much of a step boom you start hitting
[1:33:30] that side boom get the side over here
[1:33:32] you back up there it is oh
[1:33:35] Hallelujah now if the Lord allows the
[1:33:38] devil to hit you with something that's
[1:33:40] all right he's in control of that little
[1:33:43] trial and if he gives you that trial and
[1:33:45] he allows the devil to get into you a
[1:33:47] little bit that's all right God believes
[1:33:49] you'll stand the test or he wouldn't
[1:33:51] allowed her in the first place his favor
[1:33:53] allows you to go through that thing his
[1:33:55] favor allows that thing to settle into
[1:33:57] your life that's why God put it there
[1:33:59] was for your character development what
[1:34:01] more
[1:34:03] amen he ain't worried he ain't fearful
[1:34:07] because he's got this shield around
[1:34:10] you
[1:34:12] glory how could I quit how can I give up
[1:34:16] how can I walk away when his protection
[1:34:20] is over my
[1:34:24] life you said what what what does that
[1:34:26] do for me brother Ben it should take all
[1:34:28] the fear away from
[1:34:31] you it should place you in a position to
[1:34:34] where there is no failure and fear of
[1:34:37] going too far and fear you you know I
[1:34:40] hear
[1:34:41] so-called professed Christians saying
[1:34:44] things like I'm just afraid I'll blashe
[1:34:46] I'm afraid I'll be a Judas you
[1:34:49] can't if God has placed this Shield
[1:34:51] around your life it's impossible to
[1:34:54] become what you're afraid
[1:34:55] of cuz the Lord is not going to allow it
[1:34:59] friends what are we going to come to the
[1:35:01] the realization what are we going to
[1:35:02] identify in our lives that the Holy
[1:35:04] Spirit we are bought with a price we are
[1:35:08] not our own come on
[1:35:11] somebody you can't make decisions for
[1:35:13] yourself you got a boss you answer
[1:35:19] to so his Shield protects us bless the
[1:35:24] righteous with favor will Compass him as
[1:35:27] with a shield all right Psalm 30:5
[1:35:30] now Psalm chapter
[1:35:35] 30:5 praise be to
[1:35:39] God the favor of the
[1:35:44] Lord excuse
[1:35:47] me Psalm 30
[1:35:50] and5
[1:35:52] now here's a an angle or a a a
[1:35:56] view into a part of God that quite
[1:36:00] frankly I think some of us are a little
[1:36:02] afraid to talk about sometimes and
[1:36:04] that's the anger of the Lord and his
[1:36:07] displeasure now what I want to show you
[1:36:09] here in this verse if the Lord will help
[1:36:11] me is I want to show you how that no
[1:36:14] matter how angry he might get or how
[1:36:18] displeased he could be at some of our
[1:36:20] Behavior
[1:36:22] that his favor will not let it remain
[1:36:24] that way verse 5 tells us now for his
[1:36:28] anger endureth but for
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:31] a moment I got three girls at home I got
[1:36:37] two stupid teenage
[1:36:39] girls and I got one little
[1:36:41] eight-year-old she's brilliant she's
[1:36:43] intelligent because she's not she's not
[1:36:45] a teenager yet when they become
[1:36:47] teenagers they become stupid teenage
[1:36:48] kids I don't know where the stupid comes
[1:36:50] from it just kicks sin
[1:36:56] somehow and them two girls I love them
[1:36:59] but as they're learning and growing and
[1:37:02] developing they can do some of the
[1:37:03] goofiest stuff I've ever seen in my life
[1:37:05] I I told my middle daughter the other
[1:37:06] day I said
[1:37:08] Annie was you thinking before such a
[1:37:11] thing did you think did you use your
[1:37:13] brain that thing between your ears
[1:37:14] called a brain did you use it well I
[1:37:17] said that's all I needed to know right
[1:37:18] there there's the
[1:37:20] answer
[1:37:22] sometimes the father I get so mad at
[1:37:24] them I said what is the matter with you
[1:37:25] stupid
[1:37:27] girls I don't sit there're like you
[1:37:29] ain't never done what I'm talking
[1:37:31] about it's all in
[1:37:34] love but sometimes my anger oh I've
[1:37:37] taught these girl I taught you better
[1:37:39] than
[1:37:40] that but you see no matter how mad I
[1:37:44] might be at him now or for whatever
[1:37:48] moment that my anger has shown up
[1:37:52] all of that settles down all that dust
[1:37:55] settles brother Joe they're my blood
[1:37:58] they're me they're an expression of who
[1:38:01] I am Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[1:38:04] so to speak I I am their father and
[1:38:07] those are my
[1:38:08] kids so no matter how angry I might get
[1:38:11] at them or how I might say that's the
[1:38:13] stupidest thing I've ever seen you
[1:38:16] do my anger only endures for a moment
[1:38:20] why that already have my
[1:38:23] favor because I'm their father and
[1:38:25] they're my my
[1:38:27] daughters
[1:38:29] Hallelujah so my anger is not a
[1:38:32] reflection of anything to do with my
[1:38:34] favor at all but my favor kind of kicks
[1:38:38] in if you will after all of the yelling
[1:38:40] and the screaming and the what in the
[1:38:41] world were you doing and why did you do
[1:38:43] that I can't believe you said that when
[1:38:46] all of that
[1:38:47] settles it comes back to the fact they
[1:38:49] already have favor with me in the
[1:38:51] beginning therefore what do I do get him
[1:38:55] by the hand say all
[1:38:57] right let's dust off and try
[1:39:02] again so my anger might be kindled
[1:39:04] against them but my favor is what keeps
[1:39:07] it from being
[1:39:12] permanent when we walk in a place to
[1:39:16] where the Lord you know the prophet said
[1:39:18] in in perp my perfect weakness that God
[1:39:20] sometimes gets a he feels like kicking
[1:39:23] us oh y'all didn't know he said that huh
[1:39:26] 11 1961 just go back and look at
[1:39:30] it God gets a mad us he feels like
[1:39:33] kicking us
[1:39:34] sometimes he gives us his power his a
[1:39:37] nipus gives us the word gives us all
[1:39:38] these great things and what do we do act
[1:39:41] like a bunch of stupid teenage kids
[1:39:43] forgive me Teenagers I'm trying to make
[1:39:44] a point
[1:39:48] here and all of those things that we
[1:39:50] would do and God would get so mad as
[1:39:52] think why did you do that dumb thing
[1:39:54] like
[1:39:55] that but yet because I have his favor
[1:40:00] already his anger endureth but a
[1:40:05] moment and in his favor is life weeping
[1:40:09] may endure for the night but joy comes
[1:40:11] in the morning his favor brings
[1:40:15] about his
[1:40:17] instruction his
[1:40:19] support his teaching his guidance and
[1:40:23] his
[1:40:25] Mercy glory to God Amen I drop down two
[1:40:30] verses verse 7 Psalm 30 and then verse 7
[1:40:33] chapter 30 verse
[1:40:34] 7 David says Lord by thy favor thou Hast
[1:40:39] made my Mountain to stand strong listen
[1:40:41] to
[1:40:42] this thou didst hide thy face and I was
[1:40:46] troubled so here David's even reflecting
[1:40:48] that God would sometimes hide his face
[1:40:50] from him
[1:40:51] you ever had the Lord do that to
[1:40:54] you certain time period of your life and
[1:40:57] you're waiting on the Lord just to speak
[1:40:59] it
[1:41:00] out Heavens are
[1:41:02] brass everything is quiet and
[1:41:05] still doesn't seem like there's anything
[1:41:07] spiritual moving in your life
[1:41:09] whatsoever doesn't seem that way it is
[1:41:12] but it doesn't seem that
[1:41:15] way but it's in that
[1:41:17] moment that David said he made my
[1:41:20] mountain stand strong now in the Bible a
[1:41:23] mountain symbolizes several things first
[1:41:25] of all it can symbolize divine
[1:41:29] inspiration talked about they said
[1:41:30] that's where all the great Inspirations
[1:41:32] are come and get way up high into the
[1:41:33] mountain and said sit up there and think
[1:41:35] about the Lord and meditate on the Lord
[1:41:36] and great Inspirations would come to him
[1:41:39] the city of God New Jerusalem is a
[1:41:42] mountain it's a symbol universal symbol
[1:41:45] of nearness to God people think about
[1:41:48] climbing to the top of a mountain
[1:41:49] there's something about that that
[1:41:51] represents God a closeness to
[1:41:54] God but a mountain also symbolizes A New
[1:41:59] Beginning because just like the song I
[1:42:01] sang to you no matter how many valleys
[1:42:04] or mountains that you might cross
[1:42:06] through in your
[1:42:07] lifetime and you might be going through
[1:42:09] a valley right at this very moment you
[1:42:11] might be going through something so hard
[1:42:13] you don't know how to overcome it but as
[1:42:15] you're walking through this Valley
[1:42:18] eventually you're going to come to the
[1:42:19] foot or the base of another
[1:42:21] Mountain God made that mountain to stand
[1:42:23] strong to symbolize A New Beginning what
[1:42:27] no matter what it might have been
[1:42:28] yesterday remember yesterday ended last
[1:42:31] night and God gives all of us a new
[1:42:36] beginning his favor is what does that
[1:42:40] meaning that you cannot mess up to the
[1:42:42] point of no
[1:42:46] return whenever you go so far and you
[1:42:49] see things going on and trouble's
[1:42:52] happening he gives you a new beginning
[1:42:55] all of this trial now behind you what
[1:42:57] Paul say about it forget
[1:42:58] it forget about all of that behind you
[1:43:01] and start pressing to the mark of the
[1:43:04] high calling in Christ
[1:43:07] Jesus he made my Mountain to stand
[1:43:10] strong he will not allow my new
[1:43:12] beginnings to disappear right you've
[1:43:14] heard me say it before but remember
[1:43:16] Christians are the only people on this
[1:43:18] Earth that can redeem the time
[1:43:21] Paul told us to redeem it because the
[1:43:23] days were
[1:43:24] evil we are a people of redemption we
[1:43:27] have the abil the ability to apply
[1:43:29] Redemption to every area of our life
[1:43:31] even our
[1:43:33] time years that might have been lost
[1:43:36] moments that might have been lost
[1:43:37] opportunities that might have been lost
[1:43:38] you can redeem it as a Believer glory to
[1:43:41] God why because his favor provides for
[1:43:45] me A New
[1:43:47] Beginning
[1:43:49] right
[1:43:51] praise the
[1:43:53] Lord now watch this at Easter seal
[1:43:56] brother says I'd hate to try to go to
[1:43:58] heaven on my
[1:44:00] preaching that amazing everybody else is
[1:44:02] trying to get there on
[1:44:04] it that's
[1:44:07] right he said I'd hate to try to go to
[1:44:09] heaven on my visions and yet people are
[1:44:12] trying to go to heaven on
[1:44:14] those I'm not going to
[1:44:18] heaven because of that he said I'm going
[1:44:20] because I hold his grace in my
[1:44:25] heart do you realize that not even the
[1:44:28] blood of Christ not even the blood of
[1:44:34] Jesus if you had a charger of the
[1:44:37] natural blood of Jesus Christ you
[1:44:39] realize not that blood couldn't do not
[1:44:40] one thing for you that's right
[1:44:43] amen you realize that all of this Bible
[1:44:46] and all this message and all this
[1:44:47] preaching and all these visions and all
[1:44:48] these things from Brother Bram not one
[1:44:50] bit of that is going to get you ready to
[1:44:52] get out of here and go in the
[1:44:57] Rapture
[1:44:58] [Applause]
[1:45:00] faith in the
[1:45:02] preaching faith in the Visions faith in
[1:45:07] the blood of
[1:45:08] Christ faith in the word is what brings
[1:45:12] you into those places like that righten
[1:45:15] not the natural articles communion foot
[1:45:17] washing those things don't save nobody
[1:45:19] but we do that because our faith toward
[1:45:22] God we believe there's healing in the
[1:45:24] communion we believe that baptism is an
[1:45:26] outward show of what's happened on the
[1:45:28] inside
[1:45:29] faith is what anchors all of those
[1:45:32] things glor to
[1:45:37] God so his
[1:45:40] favor isn't shown to me because I've got
[1:45:45] a piece of brother brandom sleeping
[1:45:49] back or I've got a piece of a preacher's
[1:45:54] tie some prayer cloth I'm holding on to
[1:45:57] my faith in
[1:45:58] God that's what makes the
[1:46:01] difference faith is not appropriated
[1:46:04] because you sat on this church pew in
[1:46:06] here or because of what preacher
[1:46:08] preaches from this platform over
[1:46:10] you faith in your heart toward what is
[1:46:13] accomplished and what is done that's
[1:46:16] what brings you into those
[1:46:18] things and how can you have faith faith
[1:46:20] in God if he doesn't show his favor to
[1:46:30] You Luke 1 verse 30 little bit further
[1:46:35] doing good so far okay hang in there
[1:46:38] with
[1:46:39] me after preaching like this you're
[1:46:41] probably thinking I'm glad you ain't
[1:46:43] been around for a
[1:46:47] while your hide got a little bit thin I
[1:46:50] guess I had to come toughen you up
[1:46:55] evidently oh I'm just teasing settle
[1:46:58] down Luke 1:30 watch
[1:47:02] now the angel said unto
[1:47:05] her fear not
[1:47:08] Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[1:47:14] God so
[1:47:18] question was she a different kind of
[1:47:20] marriage
[1:47:21] something about her name
[1:47:23] different was she a different caliber of
[1:47:27] Virgin did they feed her better put her
[1:47:29] in better
[1:47:30] quarters what what made this Mary here
[1:47:34] of all of the thousands was on the earth
[1:47:36] at the time what made that one so
[1:47:38] special you see you can't have faith in
[1:47:42] anything unless God makes the first move
[1:47:44] on
[1:47:46] you you could look in the Bible and you
[1:47:48] could say a virgin shall conceive but
[1:47:51] you have no faith to appropriate to it
[1:47:54] until God reveals to you you the virgin
[1:47:57] that's right and do you know this was
[1:47:59] such a surprise to this girl that the
[1:48:02] Bible said when the angel of the Lord
[1:48:03] spoke to her she stopped and said what
[1:48:05] manner of salutation is this you know
[1:48:08] kind of like some of y'all do in church
[1:48:09] when the Holy Ghost tells you well how
[1:48:12] forgiving you are and how wonderful you
[1:48:14] are and how powerful you are as the
[1:48:16] bride and what a conquer you when the
[1:48:17] Holy Ghost preaches that way to us
[1:48:19] sometimes we just sit and think what is
[1:48:21] he talking about
[1:48:23] me you know that's a good thing to have
[1:48:25] that kind of attitude at least you got
[1:48:28] some humility with it not thank yourself
[1:48:31] more than you
[1:48:33] ought but when God speaks this to this
[1:48:36] girl right here she done nothing within
[1:48:43] herself it wasn't that she was a better
[1:48:45] type of person raised in a better
[1:48:48] family it was the fact that God God had
[1:48:50] her in
[1:48:51] mind as being the incubator for the body
[1:48:54] of God hallelujah and when he looked
[1:48:57] upon this woman his favor was shown to
[1:49:02] her when it wasn't shown to any other
[1:49:05] virgin or any other Mary or any other
[1:49:07] person in all of Israel God showed his
[1:49:09] favor to that girl right there she was
[1:49:11] the one that received it and here's what
[1:49:14] people will say well that's not fair
[1:49:16] God's the one makes the decision on
[1:49:18] what's fair and ain't Fair right I'm
[1:49:21] just glad that I'm a part of whatever he
[1:49:23] wants me to be a part
[1:49:25] of
[1:49:29] Amen listen to this the Hebrew series
[1:49:32] you see friends what you do is not
[1:49:36] accepted is what he
[1:49:38] done your own righteousness won't be
[1:49:42] accepted so put this in perspective we
[1:49:46] raise our families come and preach and
[1:49:47] we tell people all our lives live right
[1:49:49] and walk right and and dress right and
[1:49:51] don't do this and stay away from that we
[1:49:53] we we put so much emphasis on those
[1:49:56] things which is okay if you keep those
[1:49:59] things in their right place all of that
[1:50:03] is wonderful and praise God for people
[1:50:04] that are holy living but that is not a
[1:50:07] means of
[1:50:09] Salvation and you know where we've
[1:50:11] really missed the mark in this message
[1:50:12] so many years because we have so pushed
[1:50:14] the doctrines and the Mysteries and
[1:50:16] behaviors and how we live and what we do
[1:50:18] and what we don't do that we have
[1:50:20] forgotten all together to preach a
[1:50:22] gospel message to people s in the pews
[1:50:25] that don't know that they're Sinners and
[1:50:27] they need to get
[1:50:30] saved and so they come to the church
[1:50:32] they learn all the behaviors they learn
[1:50:34] how to dress and talk and what to
[1:50:36] believe and they've never been
[1:50:42] saved how in the
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:45] world could I ever bring myself into a
[1:50:49] place
[1:50:52] to where I could say to him now
[1:50:54] Lord be like Mary kind of saying to
[1:50:57] Jesus uh now or saying to to to the
[1:51:00] father of Jesus to God the Father not in
[1:51:03] the trinitarian way but God who is the
[1:51:05] father the Holy
[1:51:07] Spirit it' be like Mary saying now uh
[1:51:10] I've got a few good chromosomes you can
[1:51:12] borrow if you need them got a few good
[1:51:15] cells I come from a pretty good pedigree
[1:51:17] so I've got a few Joseph's got a few on
[1:51:19] his side that if you'd like to borrow a
[1:51:22] few you realize in order for him to
[1:51:25] bring this body of God into creation
[1:51:27] like it was that not one self from
[1:51:29] either one of them could have been
[1:51:30] Incorporated that's right Jesus had
[1:51:33] nothing to do in the physical way there
[1:51:35] was absolutely not one Speck of Mary not
[1:51:38] one Speck of Joseph in that kid that's
[1:51:41] right when God created that body it was
[1:51:44] total blood creation by almighty God
[1:51:48] hallelujah that's why the B said a Virg
[1:51:50] would conceive she couldn't add nothing
[1:51:52] to it and produce
[1:51:55] it all of those things in their proper
[1:51:58] place praise the Lord and Hallelujah for
[1:52:05] him but in order for me to know if I've
[1:52:07] got God's favor looking at okay I
[1:52:10] listened to seven tapes this week and I
[1:52:12] read my Bible three times and I went to
[1:52:13] church and pay TI this week evidently
[1:52:15] I've got God's favor greatly in my
[1:52:18] life
[1:52:20] that favor doesn't change if you didn't
[1:52:22] listen to any tapes didn't read your
[1:52:24] Bible forgot to pay your ties and have
[1:52:25] been an absolute Rascal all
[1:52:28] week two eye blinks three head nods the
[1:52:31] rest of you just sitting there you don't
[1:52:32] want to reveal yourself I
[1:52:35] guess come on
[1:52:37] now doesn't change God's favor for you
[1:52:41] he still loves you and has confidence in
[1:52:43] you no matter how you
[1:52:45] pave
[1:52:47] sure oh no don't mean you won't get it
[1:52:50] it you he Daddy's belt loops from Heaven
[1:52:56] sometimes but you've got to separate in
[1:52:58] your mind because how many times do you
[1:53:01] sit and feel so discouraged over things
[1:53:03] that you fail at and then somehow in our
[1:53:06] mind we translate that to mean that God
[1:53:09] doesn't like us as much this
[1:53:16] week Romans chapter
[1:53:18] 10:3 I grab just a couple scriptures I'm
[1:53:21] I'll let you
[1:53:22] home 838 I'm not doing too
[1:53:26] bad let's wrap this up for they being
[1:53:30] ignorant of God's
[1:53:32] righteousness going about to establish
[1:53:34] their own righteousness have not
[1:53:37] submitted thems under the righteousness
[1:53:39] of God and Paul's saying that these
[1:53:42] these men of the day these people of the
[1:53:44] day would not submit themselves to God's
[1:53:48] righteousness but they established or
[1:53:50] created their own
[1:53:53] thing rules regulations
[1:53:58] laws why did they do that because to
[1:54:01] them taste not touch not handle not
[1:54:04] that's how you got God's attention
[1:54:06] that's how you got God's favor and
[1:54:08] what's Paul trying to teach these people
[1:54:11] that when you submit yourself to the
[1:54:13] righteousness of God it has nothing to
[1:54:15] do with what you do or you don't do in
[1:54:17] yourself now that doesn't mean you don't
[1:54:18] live right don't mean you don't tribe
[1:54:20] but you cannot use that as your absolute
[1:54:22] for whether God is going to put his
[1:54:23] favor on you or not that's
[1:54:26] right just like gifts where those
[1:54:28] tongues they'll fail prophecy they'll
[1:54:30] fail where you act where you do you'll
[1:54:32] fail
[1:54:33] somewhere but we're not washed up and
[1:54:35] gone no his righteousness is there to
[1:54:39] kick in and take
[1:54:42] over Philippians
[1:54:44] 3:9 Paul said being found in him not
[1:54:47] having my own righteousness which is of
[1:54:50] the
[1:54:51] law but that which is through the Faith
[1:54:55] of Christ amen the righteousness which
[1:54:58] is of god
[1:55:01] by how by
[1:55:06] faith and then finally Romans chap 5: 10
[1:55:09] and 11 he says for if we when we were
[1:55:12] enemies we were reconciled to God by the
[1:55:15] death of his
[1:55:17] son much more being reconciled
[1:55:20] we shall be saved by his life and not
[1:55:22] only so but we also joy in God through
[1:55:25] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have
[1:55:28] now received the
[1:55:30] atonement and this word
[1:55:32] atonement it means the
[1:55:36] restoration of the favor of
[1:55:40] God so at one time I might have been his
[1:55:44] enemy to the word at one time I might
[1:55:47] have been an
[1:55:48] absolute I might have been a beast of a
[1:55:52] problem but once he saved me through
[1:55:55] faith am I saved with joy in God through
[1:55:58] our Lord Jesus Christ once I came to
[1:56:00] that spot to where he saw my intention
[1:56:03] was to live right and he gave back to me
[1:56:05] the baptism of the Holy
[1:56:09] Ghost then in doing so he restores back
[1:56:13] to me the favor that Adam lost all them
[1:56:16] years ago into the Garden of
[1:56:18] Eden because you see it was God's favor
[1:56:22] that kept them wholly
[1:56:24] veiled and as long as they stayed
[1:56:27] underneath the umbrella of God's favor
[1:56:29] Satan couldn't touch them and it wasn't
[1:56:31] until they came out from underneath that
[1:56:34] that they got in trouble in the first
[1:56:35] place same thing with you and I the only
[1:56:38] time we ever get in trouble is when we
[1:56:39] step out from behind that
[1:56:41] word my brother sister that's the point
[1:56:44] of the message I'm making tonight thank
[1:56:46] God that the moment we step out from
[1:56:48] over behind the word and we start
[1:56:50] getting oursel in trouble there's
[1:56:51] another Shield of RA righteousness and
[1:56:54] Grace that stands right there to keep us
[1:56:56] from going too
[1:56:58] far and no matter how many times you've
[1:57:00] messed up or how many valleys you've
[1:57:02] went through he's there to give you a
[1:57:04] new
[1:57:05] beginning rise and try again yes he
[1:57:07] might have been angry with you but his
[1:57:10] anger only endures for a
[1:57:12] moment Joy comes in the
[1:57:14] morning stand with me
[1:57:18] tonight
[1:57:20] praise the
[1:57:23] Lord musicians come tonight let's bow
[1:57:25] our heads
[1:57:28] together oh Jesus thank you for your
[1:57:31] word thank you for what's been
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:34] preached Lord I I I just trust you let
[1:57:37] it just be a revelation deep in our
[1:57:41] hearts may it just be something that
[1:57:43] settles deep within us Lord I pray and
[1:57:46] help us to see it in the right view of
[1:57:48] seeing it
[1:57:50] because Lord how easy it is for
[1:57:53] us to look at these things in a in a in
[1:57:56] a much different way leaning more on
[1:57:59] that work side of trying to accomplish
[1:58:01] something within
[1:58:02] oursel but Lord seeing in your word
[1:58:06] tonight how your
[1:58:08] favor is there Upon Our
[1:58:10] Lives that we as human beings
[1:58:13] cannot earn that or win that or live
[1:58:17] close enough to get it
[1:58:20] he lord it's it's amazing at the
[1:58:23] beginning of the message when I answered
[1:58:24] the question to say we can't obtain
[1:58:27] God's favor you could almost feel like a
[1:58:29] disappointment hanging people because
[1:58:32] Lord that's man's nature he's always
[1:58:34] trying to do something to get your
[1:58:36] attention or to get you to look our
[1:58:38] Direction Lord if I was going to point
[1:58:41] to that there's a lot of more people
[1:58:43] around this world that can do a whole
[1:58:45] lot better at life at this game of life
[1:58:48] they play the game a whole lot better
[1:58:49] Better Than I
[1:58:50] Do Lord I want to be thankful for the
[1:58:53] fact
[1:58:54] that no matter where I'm matter or who I
[1:58:57] am one day you just sent the angel down
[1:58:59] my
[1:59:00] pathway hail you have found favor with
[1:59:04] God Amen I like it better that way
[1:59:06] anyways Lord because then we can't boast
[1:59:09] and brag about what we've done or what
[1:59:10] we've learned or how long we've been in
[1:59:12] the message you get all the glory for
[1:59:14] such
[1:59:15] things and so we thank you for it Lord
[1:59:19] help us now to be able to receive
[1:59:21] it protect us and speed us on our way
[1:59:25] Grant to us your mercy in all things in
[1:59:27] Jesus name I
[1:59:29] pray amen amen and
[1:59:33] amen how many glad you got God's favor
[1:59:36] in your life amen Lord
[1:59:40] hallelujah I uh appreciate your patience
[1:59:43] 8:44 I crammed a three-hour sermon in
[1:59:46] about an hour and 10 minutes right there
[1:59:48] so the Lord bless you you did well you
[1:59:51] hung in there with me I love you friends
[1:59:54] listen to me as we go on a time you're
[1:59:57] going to find out that the one thing
[2:00:00] that's going to discourage you more than
[2:00:01] anything else is not going to be the
[2:00:02] devil it ain't going to be church people
[2:00:04] it ain't going to be Politics the one
[2:00:06] thing that's going to discourage you
[2:00:06] more than anything else is this right
[2:00:08] here
[2:00:09] you and getting overcoming ability
[2:00:12] overcoming power to whip out that Real
[2:00:14] Enemy which is you yourself amen that
[2:00:17] right there is what's going to help us
[2:00:18] get ready to get out of here and make
[2:00:19] the Rapture that's why I preach stuff
[2:00:21] like this not not because oh you know
[2:00:23] they say when a man preaches a lot about
[2:00:25] something that he's guilty or some kind
[2:00:27] of thing I'm certainly not saying what
[2:00:28] I'm saying tonight because I'm hiding
[2:00:30] secret sin I'm not preaching this way
[2:00:32] about making mistakes to give us a
[2:00:33] license to do anything we want to do but
[2:00:36] brother at the end of the day we're
[2:00:37] going to have to know how to fight this
[2:00:39] thing right here that's right we need to
[2:00:40] know how it uppercuts and how it how it
[2:00:43] swings and how it steps back in the
[2:00:45] boxing ring we need to know how it
[2:00:46] fights if we want to get overcoming
[2:00:48] power over it
[2:00:49] amen so I preach these things so we can
[2:00:51] go a little further in Christ and every
[2:00:54] time we have these moments where we've
[2:00:57] been a little short of the glory of God
[2:01:00] maybe from today on instead of you going
[2:01:02] to that place in your mind thinking oh
[2:01:04] man well I've messed up with the Lord I
[2:01:07] want to have to really earn it back
[2:01:09] after tonight maybe you'll be able to
[2:01:10] stop and say I don't have to earn it
[2:01:12] Lord I just have to say I'm sorry amen
[2:01:16] and let you give me a new beginning that
[2:01:17] I can try again
[2:01:19] and even if you're angry with me Jesus I
[2:01:21] know your anger won't endure I'm sorry
[2:01:23] forgive me help me raise up and try
[2:01:25] again show me how to win and overcome
[2:01:28] that thing I think if you put it in that
[2:01:31] perspective it's going to make you a
[2:01:32] stronger Christian when you see it in
[2:01:34] that line amen so God bless you love you
[2:01:38] appreciate you see you again soon the
[2:01:40] Lord willing amen and I'm going turn
