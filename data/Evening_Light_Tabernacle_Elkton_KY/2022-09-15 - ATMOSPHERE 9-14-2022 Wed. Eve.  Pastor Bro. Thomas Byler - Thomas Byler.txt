and so he has to have the music played or whatever and then he'll do the singing but it'll be a blessing amen i look forward to hearing him amen amen so praise god let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you once again lord thankful to be in your house lord jesus with your believers lord of like faith lord jesus and bring in their lick of fire tonight lord which is our lord jesus that you speak to us once again father as you did with those disciples on the road to emmaus lord when they spoke when you spoke with him lord jesus you know they said did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to that to to us along the way and father we just desire god that you'll that do that for us tonight lord speak to us again or we know that you're not done talking and we do appreciate every time that you speak to our hearts our lives by the way of the word lord and we ask god that you just bless the thought of our heart now in the sermon i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to minister in jesus christ's name amen and amen all right turn your bibles if you will and tonight i want to speak on a very familiar subject something that we're familiar with around the message called uh atmosphere amen that'd be all right let's speak on atmosphere amen i know we hear this message a lot but you know i don't know about you but you know i like my rib eyes also you know and you know i can eat one rib eye and then i can read another one later on amen and keep eating them so that's kind of the way the word of god is amen it's always good amen and so praise the lord all right let's go to numbers if you will the book of numbers amen the 14th chapter 13th chapter this is after they went and spied out the land and so forth and they were bringing back a report of course the 10 spies or was it 12 spies i think it was 12 spies 10 had one report and of course joshua and caleb had another report amen and so we want to look at just what they said um let's go with verse 25 of chapter 13. and it turned from searching out the land after 40 days and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we come unto the land wither thou send us to us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in this in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enoch there and the amalekites dwelt in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stealed the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we may not be able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land though through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that saw that we saw in our men of great stature and there we saw the giants the sons of ant which come of the giants and we were in our own side as grasshoppers and so were so in their sight now all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt for uh with god we had died in this wilderness or would to god we died in this wilderness and wherefore hath the lord brought us into this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be prayed for it not better for us to have returned unto egypt amen and they said and they said one to another let us make a captain let us return unto egypt and mo then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jupiter which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto the company of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord therefore delight in us he will bring us into this land and give it to us the land which most uh flowed with milk and honey only rebel not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation baits them stoned them with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me how will how long will they be err they believe me for all the signs which i have shown unto them and of course he goes to song talking about how he wanted to smite and so forth and moses fell into breach for him and then in verse 20 after he's asked god to pardon him pardon them the lord said verse 20 i have pardoned according to thy word but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times they have not hearkened unto my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me to see it but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land with the rivers with us whoever he went and his seed shall possess it may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen praise the lord that's right we read a scripture here and i first of all want to say as we talk about atmosphere amen we know uh as the prophet of god said you know it's the atmosphere of anything that does it talking about an egg and how that you can put an egg under a dog or whatever you want to put it under as long as that temperature is right amen then he also mentions on how that there's people that you like to be around and there's others that you just try to avoid amen when you think about atmosphere first of all you have to think about what creates an atmosphere what makes an atmosphere amen and we'll realize when you're talking about creating an atmosphere amen we of course and i look i look at this my my my core i thought thought is we know that it is actually faith that creates a right atmosphere because how many knows faith is positive faith is never negative now prophet told us don't ever if you can possibly help but don't ever let a negative thought go through your mind now when you think about negative you think about everything that this world is and everything about this world is negative there isn't hardly anything there's absolutely nothing uh positive about this world amen when you think about politics it's absolutely polluted there's nothing positive about politics nothing positive about any of animation huh we know that the world is dying i mean it was the bible declared that this world is going to die and it's in the process of dying that's not positive that's negative he meant i used the word dying but you know the bible says that heavens and earth and then when somebody dies we say that they passed away right and the bible said that heavens and earth shall die or pass away amen so there there's nothing positive there there's only one hope praise the lord and how many know that's in jesus christ and you can't get anything from jesus christ outside of faith so faith is what does it i believe that we as believers we're so i'm so great i'm glad i was thinking on the way to church so how did i'm so glad amen that god has given us something that we can be positive about there's only one hope i mean there's only one chance for anybody in this world and that's jesus christ there's only one hope that the bible says in this world that is the coming of the lord jesus it's funny how i hear it different tapes he speaks about he says there's no there's absolutely no hope outside of the coming of the lord and what a hope that is folks it is no wonder that people are druggies and tattooed up and everything out they're tormented they're depressed they have nothing to be happy about they have no future but that's not you and i [Applause] how many months there have the right atmosphere around you amen and that is what the holy spirit for the faith brings the holy spirit you know joshua and caleb were the kind of people that you really want to hang with because even god said there was a different spirit about them how many knows what that spirit is that spirit is a spirit of faith they were not grumblers they were not complainers god got sick of israel and how oh my think about it if god did not let one of those parents go into the promised land because they would not believe his signs and his wonders that he did what about this generation that still has the tapes of every sign every wonder everything that's still there that can still hear it they can still see it and hear the signs and the wonders that god has done in this generation because remember buddha baptism says those tapes will be played on judgment day in front of people neither will god spare this generation god did every sign every wonder that is imaginable to get people's attention and yet they go on in sin they go on and i believe notice how god said these ten times have i got to try to get them to believe me no matter what their circumstance is huh and i'm so grateful tonight aren't you glad tonight that that it doesn't matter what your circumstance is i don't care if it's death itself staring you in the face you can be positive you can have joy because it's nothing but a vehicle to take you over yonder oh my praise be to god all right never let a negative thought go through your mind every promise every word of god is what yea the bible says it's yes it's positive it's short it's a promise it can't fail amen nobody knows that you and i are amateur creators not only amateur creators but in order to be an amateur creator you have to be an amateur god oh my i love this your amateur amateur god a minor god how many know that we were given dominion over big bulls coming at you through the field we were given dominion over hornets that are fixed to take you out we were giving dominion over to storms and over the weather [Music] we were given dominion over lions it don't matter what it is we were given dominion over all of the animals all of the world that's what god told adam i give you dominion over all of it man amateur god didn't he say one place you know that if we really had faith we could go create a world and go live on it well i don't know about you brother glenn but i got i want to make sure that i create this world the way it's supposed to be huh amen by faith create the atmosphere around you create the atmosphere for your life huh that's who it benefits first folks man claims to be a christian the biggest benefit from beneficiary from that is a wife and then the children and so forth on down then the neighbors and everywhere else folks if we can't have that world under going to control i know where are we ever going to create worlds i wrote down here says you know we do create our through faith we do create our atmosphere that we are and as a family as a mom as a dad we're responsible to create an atmosphere that the children can hatch so that they'll help from just him dad i want what you got mom i want what you got huh as bosses our workers should be able to say i want what you have boss and if the servant is a christian and maybe the boss ain't the boss should be able to look at that servant say look i don't know what you got but i need what you got huh praise the lord the right mental attitude towers the word of god brother man says we'll bring every promise of god to pass what kind of attitude that god do you have to have praise the lord oh my we got to have an attitude like joshua and like caleb did him in the holy spirit atmosphere faith to believe that it doesn't matter how big the giants are do you realize that tonight that those the thing that that that uh keeps you from having joy unspeakable those devils that try to keep me from that they're big [Applause] they're like the sons of mana they don't want you to have any peace they don't want you have any joy they don't want you to go to church and if you do go to church they don't want you to get anything and they'll keep you from it you'll be sitting in your peers and that devil of america will keep you from getting joy keep you from getting peace if you possibly can by coming up in your mind and trying to control it praise the lord me just say it you got to get your mind right before you can get your heart right because your mind is the womb to the soul that right praise the lord i like that i was looking for the excellent spirit you know and i believe that joshua had an excellent spirit caleb had an extra something about his spirit i mean as we all carry a spirit and some spirits you like to be around some spirits you don't really like to be around i think another way to church you know i can probably mention a person's name who i really don't care around to be around too much going to mention a name because that just be mean we can't be doing that up here but anyway right think about it just negative negative negative negative i like joshua i like caleb god like caleb he says caleb you're my kind of guy isn't it something how that there's an atmosphere that even comes with our names then brother says don't call them ricketts don't call them elvises rats and cats and everything else he says what if my god he says if you name the shot change it if you ain't better there's something that comes with that that's why we got so many johns and paul's right [Applause] we got gelato joshuas why because of that great man that he was that come with that name or david's huh i don't know about thomas they call him downton thomas well let me tell you something i think he made it so we're all right he just had to see the bleach he just had to touch the side but you know one thing thomas did was confirm that jesus wasn't just the son of god or the second person in the trinity he says my lord and my god and he fell down and worshipped him and jesus never said no you can only worship the father no he had it right praise be to god all these different names you think about it i mean i think about you know there's not many many people i was going to say not very many smart people that named their children cain or dave or korra huh because of what came with the lies that they lived amen but mary's martha's not right elizabeth different ones like that many names that we have around today this many thousands of years later because of the atmosphere and what came with those people people of faith people that believe god praise be to god oh my an attitude of faith i like it now we know that god by faith we know that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god i mean that was god believed his own word [Music] i read brother banham uh a quote i didn't bring it with him but he says you know he believed in his own word and he spoke his own word and he come into existence and he says that's the way that it is for you and for me even jesus said whatsoever things you desire when you ask them believe that you'll receive them and you will have them paul said the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god i mean believe that's what we live by that's what you and i live by is the faith of almighty god it ain't your faith it ain't somebody else's faith is god's own faith the very faith he had how that ought to give us faith to know that when we ask anything god will grant it to you we try to add so many things to it but that's what jesus says you know jesus was always a positive person he had an atmosphere around him didn't he you want to look at one go with me let's look at one mark nine you know it doesn't matter you could go on and on and on it's like the woman at the well or like the woman that was caught in the act of adultery isn't that right he didn't go there and he said now did you really do it did he no they had already judged that they were caught in a very axe and there was no getting around it huh she was guilty she should have died along with him but what did he say he that is without sin cast the first stone and none of them could cast the first stone was he mean to her no he had an atmosphere of forgiveness he says where are those he that condemned me he says i have none and jesus says neither do i condemn thee go in sin no more huh wasn't that awesome here a man in verse 17 of chapter 9 and one of the multitudes answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which had a dumb spirit and whether so ever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnashes out his teeth can you imagine and pineth away and i speak to your disciples should cast him out and they could not and he answered him he answering him and said oh faithless generation how long will i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him to me and he brought him to him and when he saw him straightway to spirit tear him and he fell to the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long has it been since it came upon him and he said of a child and oftentimes it has cast him in the fire and in the waters to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us can you imagine a parent yeah you would say lord if you can do anything please do it help us if you can boy they come to the right place how many knows whenever you bring your troubles to jesus you've come to the right place you're bringing it to the right person hallelujah and listen to a positive look at how he said now what you know jesus didn't say now i'm not sure if i can do this he didn't say have you got any sin in your life he didn't make any listen to what he says jesus said unto them if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth he said i want you to know anything's possible with god if you can believe it anything can happen and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help they all might unbelieve hallelujah that's what i say tonight lord help our unbelief we could go so much higher we could just believe more amen and when jesus saw that the people were coming running together remember it was a big big multitude there he rebuked that foul spirit saying in him thou them and death spirit i charged he come out of him and entered no man into him no more into him and the spirit cried out and rent him soaring came out of him and he was as one dead in as much as that man he said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose praise be to god how many knows there he was and look what god did and the thing that he said is what i wanted to bring is look what jesus said amen they were in that terrible condition he told him look i want you you need to be able to believe what was brother branham's theme song when he come out only believe all all things are possible to them that believe there'd be times where just as few people would get uh you know healed or whatever in the meeting and there would be times when the holy spirit would come down and heal everybody other places the whole place it gets smoky the holy the presence of god would just come down amen in that what we desire for god's presence to come down makes all the difference in the world praise be to god love i just love him don't you amen think about this one here how many knows that god loves to try our faith really believe him what is the right mental attitude look at the right mental attitude that brings things to pass he said and be certain of god he says you know he loves to test us he says he'd love to see the reaction of your faith did you know that god likes to see how you'll react when you say lord i believe remember jesus one place he said to that woman there was a gentile he said you know it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs wow what that would have might have done to her you know but he was testing her see how how serious she really was because how many knows jesus loves perseverance he loves people that are determined because i want you to know something how many believes god keeps his word when he says something the prophet of god said you know listen god has to keep he has to honor that word if you will do your part and believe with all your heart god is obligated to dress praise be to god it doesn't matter what it is folks amen oh let's go on you say well oh lord thou art my healer thou art my savior i believe that you are a healer i believe that you are the one who gives the holy spirit and the things that i'm requiring and you are the god who gives that and then when you confess all of your sins and promise god that you'll do you'll do if he'll uh gives you that he says he'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere huh because it's not always a matter it's not a matter of having it done right away it's not always the right attitude towards god's promises that brings the past it's not always right away no not always but if you'll be like john ryan huh like john ryan for weeks even had to go back in line and brother baptism says do you believe what i told you he said yes i do then why are you doubting why are you back here again he says get out of here basically go on and confess and he went everywhere confessing thank you lord jesus for healing me everywhere thank you for healing blindness and bad people making fun of it don't matter one day the angel caught up with him might we say because when the angel comes right to confirm it even i imagine imagine their bells of heaven were ringing and every time he say i i confess i'm healed thank god i'm healed read all about it right here up there say jesus say hey god say hey man we gotta we gotta make this good he's confessing it in front of everybody there on that barber chair hello his eyes came open didn't matter at all he confessed it held on to it god made it good i hope that's a lesson to somebody here or out there just remember when you you're healing it's not a matter of just that really meaning because you run off and say well god didn't do it listen to what the prophet says listen he says you run off like a coward god can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith how many please that god only answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true faith stands there being sure that god is be certain that he is amen praise be to god he is sure just like joshua like caleb they didn't know but they knew that god could do it joshie was the same way he was a i love a leader like joshua he didn't have to see it to believe it he just followed the spirit went over there crossed over the yard and went under the other side and started running around jericho marching around jericho he didn't know how many times he just did it one day another day another day another day and then it is just according to the word of the lord how many knows that we've got these angels all around us all the hosts of heaven are behind people that believe i'm trying to think of quote brother brahm says if everybody in here would genuinely believe nobody would be feeble or wanting the holy ghost in the next five minutes amen we don't have many people here tonight i don't know what you need but who knows you wouldn't have the knee to that in the next five minutes if you could just believe say it's mine praise the lord amen i'm glad are you glad remember in the bible it says let us rejoice and be glad for the marriage of the lamb has come and we're glad we've lived for cheap lab day when i was born again glad day when i was born again amen you asked me why i'm happy so i'll just tell you what huh be glad how many beliefs you can be bad not very many people out there are glad but i'm glad tonight why because in the most negative world you can have an atmosphere of joy how many knows faith is light doubt is darkness a man of faith brings light to your world it brings hope to your world and what is light before the led come along the light was heat right it was hot just like the sun when the sun's out that light is shining it's warm so is faith it brings the light of the gospel into people's lives and it brings a warmth hallelujah just like people worshiping the lord tonight the atmosphere we have here it brings the warmth how many knows the old time holy spirit never won't go near it that's the reason people fear it and it's good enough for me the holy spirit brings warmth it brings love it brings worship like brother baby some churches you go into it it feels like there's icicles hanging from the chandeliers it's so chilly jesus christ came to die tonight for sinners and nobody says the word just quiet as it melts i mean as preachers get worried we get worried when everybody gets so quiet you know why because the word of god really doesn't have an effect on you because if it really has an effect on you you know you know what i came up with a revelation tonight brother i mean today brother glenn he says whenever you're preaching if it's if in order for it to really do any good you got to be filled with the holy ghost or you may be a sinner and god work on your heart but just to sit there and be unholy ghost filled and just sit there you're just bump on the law it don't mean much [Applause] oh i heard it before he said it again he preached that sermon ten times already when's he gonna quit all kinds of thoughts right sit there and you get you foreign i'm not in here what is it called the seed of the soul scornful that's right oh the critical god got fed up god don't like it either he don't like negative people he don't like uh you know a bad atmosphere around people prophet didn't we don't amen oh my praise god listen to this so an atmosphere amino let me just say a few things here we know that the world is dying but guess what we're not dying we're just starting to live [Music] folks i got the holy ghost i guess when i was 20 years old that makes about 40 years ago yes 40 14 20 60. yeah that would be 40 years all right i got that right about 40 years brother brad i'm having the holy ghost but i'm just getting started [Applause] i mean it's dead for the holy ghost to have eternal life this life is just getting started [Applause] then i wrote california and america is going down but we're not going down because we've got a solid rock that we're standing on [Music] [Applause] i'm glad to be on christ the silent rock i said all other ground is sinking said all other ground is sinking sir i cannot stand all that rock and have joy unspeakable i'm full of glory you can be so happy and feel so good you don't know what to do with yourself you need another person you need to be a little fatter so you have more room for more [Music] i was hunting with a buddy with junior up here about a week ago with david my other buddy his buddy that we've gotten to know and enjoy he came in i think he said he was 74. but you know when he first come in he's always still climbing trees and all that other stuff you know but i noticed oh he he he he get up and just yeah you know i said what's the matter bro what's going on he oh my knee he says you know doctor he tried this out or the other he says but it's arthritis in my knee and it just oh it just hurts you know and so forth and he made a statement that i liked he says you know if you're going to get old you got to be tough he said you got to be tough to get old because it paid for its heart a broken arm young yeah it'll heal right back up but every day having to deal with this that dream of that you got to be tough hugs you know that's about right how many knows as you get older it's a whole lot easier to become negative and grouchy that's right and your atmospheres just can change amen i like brother glenn's atmosphere don't you he got a good his wife you know just a good atmosphere he doesn't come out after service about everything and huh we appreciate him don't we amen i thought lord help us amen we're coming more alive as the world is dying we're coming along as the world gropes in darkness amen how many knows it's in gross darkness i was listening to leadership yesterday i believe it was either leadership or or a modern events mate cleared by prophecy one of his last sermons and i wanted to go and listen to that he says brother van talks about the perversion of our kids how that big boys want to put a curler in their hair and curl it up like a girl he says man it's so disheartening he said it's so discouraging when little boy is going to curl that what would he say about this mess that we got today he says boy they just don't seem to know which side of the fence they belong on i wonder what he'd be really depressed today when our school kids have to come home from school and say mommy and daddy i'm not sure i'm am i a boy or i'm a girl i'd want to hit somebody myself teaching my kids and confusing my kids that way buddy i'll tell you what i'd pull my kid out of there quicker and you could snap a finger huh that's the devil's boy boy how many knows what the brother bam said he said it's absolutely controlled by the devil i want to say tonight school nowadays is a cesspool for the devil it's a cesspool it's horrible amen all right in a world that is getting darker and darker well we should be getting bluer and bluer our frog would be getting bigger bigger there's no hope oh there's no hope sure if you look at this world and focus on the news every day yeah you're gonna have a big frown you don't find hardly any good news on it anymore at all but if you looked at that but on the other side we're living in the greatest light ever how many pleased in the evening all right it shall be like [Applause] in other words you're going to know what the truth is how many glad to know the message of the hour that god brought he brought though he brought it to you so you know where he stand and so you know what right i like quoting brother bran i'm almost better than i like to preach myself because i'll tell you what when jesus christ comes down after a sermon begins to thrown the thoughts and produced does the very sign of the messiah huh i take that as solid i've told you the truth and it backs it up right with the scriptures always jesus christ comes himself and backs it up oh man praise be to god i love this i love the stories i thought about having story hour for us maybe i'll take a lot of brother brown's stories and play it on a wednesday night about when him and uh uh what is his name that went squirrel hunting banks woods i believe it was he went to this state he said i know somebody and we'll go up there and and ask this guy that's got about 500 acres we can score on he got up there and he's supposed to be an atheist and all this other said so forth and he says can i go squirrel on he says well i know your dad and i you know he was honest man and so forth yeah you can go and help yourself are you by yourself no i got my pastor with me what you got your pastor with you he said you mean you've been gotten so low down you got to carry a preacher wherever you went wherever you go you know and so brother man decided he better come on out and they had a big

lord and so forth amen how many believes that's just our god praise the lord all right let me use a couple more and we'll go to the house so we look here amen world i mean this world is promised to burn yeah there's nothing nothing good about that it's going to be a hot atmosphere after a while even the elements shall melt with fervent heat heavens and earth to pass away their elements shall melt with fervent heat but you and i we're glad why because we ain't got to worry about that fire we're standing where the fire has already been aren't you glad praise god we ain't got to worry about judgment you got to worry about the second resurrection that all the people of all ages all the way from genesis being gathered to that great judgment day we'll be with christ after we've enjoyed three and a half years with him at the marriage supper isn't that right and then we live for a thousand years isn't that right come back on earth well we're coming back on earth how many sad we're coming back amen so the world the heavens and the earth are promised the fire but you don't have to worry i don't have to worry because we're standing and living where the holy spirit fire has already been praise be to god remember brother baum says that it's going to be a mixture of a holy fire that's going to burn every devil every germ every sickness every kind of sin and all that is going to be burnt amen there's going to be no evil he's going to be none of that he says that's the way it is with a believer god comes down with the holy ghost fire and he kills every devil every attitude every bad thing about us he burns it out of us because if you don't get it burned out of you now guess what you got another fire coming it's going to burn sooner or later you don't want that in it you want it out of there because it's going to burn sooner or later i want to have it burnt down send it on up some men sins follow them after they die but other men sins go up beforehand unto judgment how many wants to repent of their sin and and confess their faults and our hands raise up and say yeah i lord i'm gonna do that now i'm gonna send it up beforehand because we know that there's mercy now there'll be no mercy there but where's mercy now so we're putting it out there god i don't want to be like this take this out of my life take that out of my life clean me make me more like you god amen praise be to god you love him amen amen darkest hour we're standing when the fire has already been and we're walking in the light the beauty for light it's not much beauty out there but the light that you're walking in is beautiful it's beautiful why your sins are gone your sins are taken care of it's all under the blood how many knows that a christian was dead in sins and trespasses but now we've been what quickened made alive how many glad to be alive amen living in the holy ghost there's nothing like it there's absolutely nothing like living in the holy ghost i was studying i got my message and had a lot of my thing notes together so i went outside and cleaning along the pool a little bit here there and doing this that or the other and i got to thinking and something said you know what are you doing out here washington i got more for you i got a murphy and i thought you know i thought people you know i thought about saying telling you this you know i hear a voice a voice i hear a voice now people are people hearing voices right you got to watch folks say they hear voices and if you notice i don't say voices i say voice one voice i don't hear a bunch of voices because man people that do that they it's not too good amen i think tommy sent me something about talking about he's got you know jesus on one side and the devil on the other side you know but somehow he's deaf in one ear yeah that's what i want to be whoever the devil is i'm deaf i can't hear what he does he says he'll see he'll try to tell you you ain't saved or you ain't gonna make it just shut up i'm different that ear all right but i like to clearly clearly be able to hear this other voice telling me you're my son i love you i'm your father i'll never leave you no forsake you i'll always take care of you yeah i hear all kinds he tells me how kind of thing he tells me what to preach huh i was up at my office this afternoon and i says now lord here i am and i i'm waiting on you to give me a message lord you know and and sometimes i have to wait but not today it wasn't five seconds later this come to my mind and it just began to roll and you know i had preached on this a lot of times before but i thought about how jesus was so positive when people were in all kinds of trouble he always had hope for him he always created an atmosphere just believing anything's possible telling his disciples after they were amazed at that fig tree being wilted and so forth wow look at that and he says i'll tell you what i want you to understand that if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you can say to that mountain be moved and if you don't doubt it'll happen amen always i thought about christ and how positive he was the atmosphere that he was he was certainly a person that he'd love to be around a chris how many knows a christian is somebody that you love to be around it's just your atmosphere how are you you know it's always concerned about you caring about you man it's just something about it but i thank god for voice that we hear that still small voice that we can hear every day how many here is that how many knows that sometimes it's so quiet you gotta listen you know when i was out there watching and something said you know there's more i thought you know i could have just thought that but no i believe it was him and some of these things that you know i just begin to think about the world how it's how it's promised to burn but we're standing where the fire's already been and all these little things you just say thank you jesus you're so awesome it don't matter aren't you glad that you don't have to just be in this atmosphere while you're sitting in church it don't have to be but i'm convinced that we get so busy sometimes that we don't have time for this atmosphere we don't take time for this atmosphere like i told you sunday i get frustrated with myself because i get too busy you know i had gotten away to where i wasn't listening to hardly anything but maybe before bed a little bit and sometimes during the day going somewhere but folks in the last couple of weeks i've gotten to where i like to go to bed with it huh i like to put on this on on instead of having a fan by my head i'll take my phone or my ipad and i will have a scribbling stream sound right but you know anymore it's i'll play brother branham until i fall asleep and wake up and then i'll shut it off and then put it on the ripley stream but i want to go to the bible says you know when you lay on your bed when you get up at night in the morning when you go to bed in the middle of the day keep your heart mind on it makes a difference many differences it's too easy to get away from that folks and then your christian life relax relax amen i don't know about you but i want to get closer to god while the world is getting further away you and i are getting closer amen god bless you let's stand tonight amen musicians if you want to come heads bowed honest hearts you need more of that atmosphere in your life god bless you god bless you all of our hands lord i need more of that atmosphere in my life so that those around us lord will feel that atmosphere that warmth if there's a son and daughter of god perhaps they'll even so to speak come to christ and they'll be able to say i don't know what you have but i need what you have i want what you have it's desirable god help us lord to create that atmosphere more lord to redeem our time more lord whatever it takes to have more atmosphere lord we ask god that you'd help us to make time father forgive us of where we slack lord and where we're not what we ought to be father tonight lord jesus may we have the atmosphere that faith creates lord jesus for we know that faith is always positive never negative lord and always looking at the promise of god we're looking to your word just as hard as we can because if we get our eyes off of you and get it on this world it'll certainly be depressing and we don't want to be depressed lord help us to keep our eyes on you and lord about your word and what you have told us lord jesus to create our world that we live on father help us each one in here to create our world and let that world be an atmosphere of the holy spirit for we know that by faith one of these days we're going to a world that is has nothing there but perfect love perfect faith and we'll fit right in and even as your prophet told us it'll take perfect love to put you in there whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get that atmosphere around you that atmosphere of perfect love that no matter what anybody does lord jesus what would we do father if we let everything that people do affect us and mold our character to a terrible person lord but father when we put it at the altar of the calvary lord and we say lord we don't want to do anything lord jesus that's un like you and that's not pleasing to you lord we ask god tonight that you'll bless every hand that is up every heart may we go from here a better people lord jesus to serve you tomorrow lord don't you let us be forgetful here's but lord help us tonight before we go to bed perhaps to read the bible to play the bible or brother branham a tape lord and just to constantly have our minds on you and not just to play it but to hear what's said father well lord we just thank you for what you have done for us in this hour you said that in the evening time it would be light and it lord you manifested it you brought it to us we are living in that light and we thank you father for it let that light shine in our hearts in jesus name amen and amen god bless you
