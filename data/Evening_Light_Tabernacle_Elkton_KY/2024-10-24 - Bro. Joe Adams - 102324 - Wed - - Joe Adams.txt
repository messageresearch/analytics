and everyone that's here God May there just be an overflowing of the the just abundance of your grace and your love father we just come before you now we just want to commit this service to you we pray you'll just speak to our hearts Lord this evening for we ask it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to look back again at habac 2 and verse two we're going to pick back up kind of where we left off on wednes or Sunday actually I want to speak to you on living in the hour of fulfillment I made mention to that to you on Sunday I actually preached part three tonight we're going to look at part one you glad to be in the house of the Lord yeah okay good not bad for a Wednesday night amen so we're going to we're going to look here as you turn there just also want to bring greetings from brother Tim Timothy brother Aaron made it home today he's taking the service tonight so tonight we're going to look at something for you older people I'm not not picking on you because you got gray hair and no hair ah yeah come on it's okay to laugh on a Wednesday night uh but tonight will be a refresher for many of us older ones who's been established in the message but I believe it's going to help our young people to gain a foundation of why we believe what we believe and so we're going to look at this tonight living in the hour of fulfillment and so just uh just let's just take this to the Lord and ask him to bless it so habac 2 and verse two and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not t God bless you you can have your seats this evening we look at this word here run and many times we think this means to be physical to get out and you know jog or do something of that nature and to exert some sign of energy but the word run here means to announce the divine revelation so what we're finding here in habca the Lord answered him and said I want you to write the vision and I want you to make it plain so who he that runs or he that's going to announce it going to make the announcement that he's going that anybody that he announces to can read it or understand it and so we find though also here in Jeremiah 23 and 21 if you look at this it says I have not sent these prophets yet they ran they begin to announce so what are they announcing they're announcing the vision and we spoke earlier we'll kind of get get back into this again tonight but yet they ran I have not spoken to them yet they prophesied so we understand there's one thing to for God to call you and to give you an understanding and you run with it it's another thing to want to do something from God and you running without a vision and so we find habc is bringing his sin and he's telling if God's going to give a vision and those are going to run with it those that are going to announce it then make it plain so there's no no confusion about it and so we find here also I want to kind of briefly touch on this habc 117 his question to God is shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continue to slay other nations you know he's looking back and he's seeing the Chans ravish this nation pillage and plunder and take it back and go back out pillage and plunder another nation and he's asking God how long are you going to permit this to take place and so when the Lord responds to habac he doesn't respond to him like I'm talking to you tonight but he gives him a vision because I want you to know the vision wasn't only for habac but it's for every generation following that Vision everyone he's therefore write the vision make it plain don't make it cryptic you want it plane so everybody that sees it understands it and those that are called to run with it the ministry that's been called to run with it they're not running without the vision they're not running without clarity but it's been made known it's been made plain and they had the divine revelation of what you have need of in that hour for That season so we want to look at this again tonight Vision what is a vision brother Joe a vision is a prophecy a Divine communication that is a dream a revelation or an oracle now you young people this is directed to you tonight so I'm going to ask you to get with me I'm going to ask you to take notes if you got paper pen whatever you need to be taking notes of this because this is going to help you it's help you understand why we believe what we believe all right why do we believe what we believe we don't believe it because some man said it we believe it because we can take it back to the Bible and we're going to take it back to the word tonight so you young people out there in school out there in the jobs out there on the streets you don't have to be shine away why you believe that God sent a prophet why you believe that we follow the voice of the god in this last day you can have the foundation because it comes back to the word of God everything that we stand for it's right here in this word every Doctrine we believe it's right here in this word and the prophet of God that God s in this hour we can find it right here in the word of God you don't have to be ashamed of saying I believe that God sent a prophet in this end time because the Bible declares it's going to send one now I'm going to go down and teach and not preach but I want you to understand it's emphatic that you young people get this understanding cuz I know when I first came to the message you know you just hear well God sent a prophet but I didn't tell nobody because I didn't I didn't know what in the world they were talking about but as you grow and mature and you learn and you you developed you kind of get that basis so I want to help I know you're good you're well taught here I'm not trying to come in and say that you're not taught well but it's a refresher okay it's a refresher so a vision Divine communication dream Revelation or an Oracle and in Proverbs 29 and verse 18 I don't see nobody writing y'all got your little phones you can do it all on your phone now right so Proverbs 29:18 the Bible says where there is no vision the people perish so initially when we think about that brother bad we hear this word perish automatically we think well they're going to die right is that what you think but that's not what it means that's why we got to go back to the word so what it means here this word perish it means to be let loose to be loosened of rest strength to make naked to set at not to perish to refuse to uncover now let's jump over to Revelations 3 let me show you some things Revelation 3:15 we find here now Jesus speaking to the leoan church our age this generation he says I Know Thy Works Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sath notice what they're saying of themselves thou sayest I am rich I am increased with Goods I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked where there is no vision the people become naked now not naked as far as undressed but naked as in they have no restraint they're loosened here so otherwise we find that we're living in a day where the people are perishing they're void of restraint people are set at not against the word of God you try to tell them what the word says they say well my church doesn't say that but the word says it but my church doesn't say that well you either going to take what the church says or you're going to take what the word says and for me I find it in the word I'm going to stay with what the word says but they're they're they're they're set it not against what the word of God says and we find people but you find them they're rich they're prospering they're successful oh they're rich in worldliness but they're naked in the things of God they have nothing on nothing you can tell them about I remember when I first became a Christian and I was in a Baptist Church and you know I had a bunch of friends and hey we went we partied on Saturday night went to a church on Sunday I didn't know any better till I grew in the Lord but you know they the the famous Baptist slogan is once saved always saved you know what and I told this young friend of mine and she had been a Christian a lot longer than and I had and she grew up a Christian I didn't and I said how in the world can you say that doing the things that you're doing he goes cuz that's what the church says they said once saved always say well I believe if you're truly saved then there's got to be something happen on the inside of your life that shows that you're truly saved and then once you're saved you are truly saved but you can't tell me you're going out partying on Friday night bar hopping on Saturday night going to the house of God for a couple hours or or or maybe an hour on Sunday morning and you're telling me you living like the devil through the week and all of a sudden you some Saint some some terrible Sunday you ain't saved you need to repent and be filled with the Holy Ghost look I didn't have any knowledge of God then I have any knowledge of the message but I knew what she had I didn't want I knew that if I was going to get saved if I was going to give my heart to God my let me tell you I didn't want to go back to the bar I didn't want to keep living the same way I lived I didn't want to keep uh partying and doing the same thing that I done I wanted something different therefore when I gave my heart to God I didn't take it back the next day I said God I give it to you you keep it that's what it means to be saved that's what it means to be born again but we find the church in the condition I'm rich I'm increased with good I go to the biggest church and you know my dad so and so and my mom so and so but where are you at with God where there is no Divine Oracle where there is no vision the people perish they lose self-control they don't care they're happy going to church on Sunday and living like a dirty dog on Monday come on church and notice here in Revelations 3:20 notice who's at the door knocking behold I Jesus is speaking can hear in my Bible it's read letter i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will s with him and he with me he has been put out of his own church knocking trying to get back in because why there is no vision or the people will not hear the vision for the age that they're living in and because of this they become uh uh distraught they become said it not they become notice they become loosened of a they have become naked and in Amos 3 we understand this at least we must Amos God does nothing but what he first reveal it to his servants the prophets Amos 3 and: 7 surely the lord god notice we're taking everything we believe back to the Bible so surely the Lord God will do nothing now I know you're in Kentucky and I just come from a place and then people didn't have all their teeth I tell you what I ran out of Walmart as quick as I ran into Walmart thought I was in a hillbilly Hil but here nothing means nothing whether in your Louisiana or whether you're in Kentucky come on John look at me and smile nothing means nothing yeah so the absolutely nothing he says surely the Lord God will do nothing he's not going to do one thing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophet so God has a way of speaking right God has a method of speaking and the Bible clearly tells us how he speaks and when God does it he does it through a prophet all right so notice when God what did he do to the Egyptians before any plagues came he sent Moses he didn't just send Moses down there Moses had a message and he went to the house of pharaoh first and said let my people go if you don't let them go then this this this and this is going to happen but God had a way of doing it also the ammonites and the by Christ so neither will God bring the destruction of our day the end time without having first sent a prophet he must send a prophet to do what to warn the people always to warn the People Get Ready Get Ready Get ready quit listening to whatever you're listening to and get ready excuse me and follow the voice of the Lord notice before there can be an end time before the Lord can return God has to send a prophet messenger he sent a prophet messenger before his first coming we're going to go there let's go there right now we'll do that Ma Malachi 3 and verse one so we can understand everything we believe is in the Bible Malachi 3 and verse1 says behold I will send my messenger and he shall thou prepare the way before me so God is speaking through a prophet saying before I come physically I'm going to send a prophet and he's going to make preparation for my coming and we understand that this was fulfilled by John the Baptist all right everybody with me least nod your head I know it's Wednesday night and then we go to ma uh Matthew 11 now here we find in in Malachi 3 verse1 God speaking saying I'm going to send my messenger before my coming then Jesus picks up on it in Malachi 7 or Malachi 11: 7 and as they departed Jesus began to say to the multitude concerning John what went you out to the Wilderness to see was it a re shaking With the Wind he says but what when out you to see a man clothed in soft ramond behold they are the ones that are in King's houses but what went you out to see a prophet yeah I say more than than a prophet so why was he more than a prophet because he was the Forerunner of Jesus Christ not that he was any better than any other Prophet not that he did any Supernatural Miracles that we know of John was alone he lived in the wilderness he ate uh Locust and honey and things of that nature but he announced the first coming of Our Lord so he was more than just a prophet he was a prophet messenger he was announcing this great coming he was preparing the way for the one to come so John fulfilled the scriptures regarding his coming let's look in Luke 3 and verse1 15 everybody happy tonight yeah I smile a little bit it's all right I won't be too long tonight last time I did it took four hours just kidding just kidding we get a chuckle out of them then right Luke 3 and verse1 15 this is John speaking and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were Christ or I notice they were wondering about John because his ministry so mirrored that of Jesus and any God called man's Ministry should mirror that because it should be the very same life but notice what John says here in luk in Luke 3:16 and John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you at water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to un loose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so we find John now he's a prophet messenger and notice everybody was looking to him are you Christ are you the one that we've been expecting to come and he says no I'm not the one but there's one coming after me notice he didn't point the people to himself he didn't Point them to his church he didn't Point them to his ministry he pointed them to Jesus Christ and every God called man every son that's been called to preach this gospel will point you to Jesus Christ if he's pointing you somewhere else I say run from that man run from that Ministry run from that church let to point you to Jesus Christ and he is the word made flesh today so we find in Malachi 3 also in verse 6 you can go there we're going to learn something here tonight by the scripture God doesn't change you change some of you used to be young some of you some of us used to have hair amen there we go get it brother Joe we change people change churches changed Society has changed but God never changed what he was yesterday he is the same today and what he is today he will be the same tomorrow you don't cherry-pick God and one day you reaching in and he's something one day that he's not the next he is the very same thing that he always was or he wasn't that to begin with so we find here in Malachi 3: 6 he says for I am the Lord I change not all right that's it enough said case over it is not worthy to be disputed if either that's God's word or it's not God's word so God doesn't change therefore he must keep the same pattern he will send another Forerunner if he sent John to forrun his first coming and who's expecting the second coming not all of you well praise I need to turn this entire subject around and start preaching on repentance if we're expecting the second coming of the Lord and he doesn't change and he sent a prophet Messenger to announce his first coming then he must send a prophet Messenger to announce his second coming do you believe that tonight that's what we believe and this is the scriptures that support this God doesn't change what he did he does who he was he is I say praise God tonight we can put our faith on that that God never changes we can have confidence in the scriptures let me tell you theologians may twist this up one day they may say it says this and another time what denomination background it may be they may say it translates to this but God is his own interpreter and he never changes the interpretation so we jump to Malachi 4 let's go there Malachi 4 and verse one you have to excuse my excitement I love the Lord and I love this word he says now Malachi 4 this is what's going to distinguish Malachi 3 from Malachi 4 distinguish John from the end time Prophet says for behold the day cometh not here yet but it's coming that shall burn as an oven now look you got to be blind deaf and dumb if you don't what that's referring to he's not going to destroy the world with water it's going to be fire it's going to be nuclear destruction so we find here the day cometh th sh burn as an oven and all the proud yay all that do wickedly shall be stubbled that word stubbled there is chaff and chaff is just you know very lightless of of the wheat then they they they they do whatever they do to it I mean you Farmers y'all probably know what you do to your wheat around here but it can be lit up real quickly and combustible just like that he said it's going to be stubble and that day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall Le them neither root nor Branch so this was not the first coming because there's not had this day yet therefore it must refer to the second coming which we're preparing for okay is that okay but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calvs of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ases under so your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him in horor for all of Israel with his statutes notice in verse five now this is our scriptures right Malachi 45 and 6 we we hang on this and we hang on this and if we don't know nothing else in the message we know Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet but if we read it so quick all we catches Elijah the Prophet come on Church behold I send you I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse see God didn't send Elijah the prophet just to send him hoping that he would have a following but he sent him for a purpose he sent him to prepare the people for his second coming come on but many of us not us but many around the message had made the Malachi 45 and six all about Elijah now we got to find a true balance with that we do not discredit the Elijah cuz without the Elijah we don't have a messenger that prepares us for the second coming but recognize who he was sent to God speaking behold I send you so the purpose of sending Elijah is for you tonight the purpose of sending of Elijah is so that your hearts could be turned back to the faith of the fathers this entire message everything that we believe has been about you tonight that's why he sent a prophet that's why he's coming again he ain't just coming to take one man he's coming to take a people and you are that people oh I say hallelujah tonight and it's backed up by the word you can find it in the scriptures see you are the purpose of the message behold I God send you the bride my Prophet my second Forerunner oh that's beautiful scriptures to me and notice this Elijah like the first Elijah he didn't Point people to himself but he pointed people to Christ he could have had a million dollars several times tore the checks up because it wasn't about preaching for money he could show Joe Olin and of these other ones a thing or two preaching for Prosperity but what about preaching for results what about preaching to turn the hearts because see that was God's gift to turn your heart that's why you couldn't go with mainstream that's why you couldn't be out there and just Flo around and continue to live the same life you live because on the inside of your heart God deposited a seed and at the right time that Prophet Messi's word came across that seat and it begin to come to life on for the purpose of turning your heart back to him now in the church age we find this brother B will tell us immediately after the coming of this Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked burn to ashes of course this did not happen at the time of John the Elijah for for his day the spirit of God that prophesied of the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3 was John John was just reiterating his previous prophetic statement of Isaiah 40 and ver3 he was the voice of the one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord that's what John did so we can see from these scriptures that the prophet of Malachi 3 was John was not the prophet of Malachi 4 two independently distinct prophets both with the great message to forerun the coming of the Lord therefore if God thought it was essential Thomas to send us a prophet to turn us to prepare us for the Lord shouldn't we at least listen to The Prophet shouldn't we quit trying to cherry-pick our quotes and cherry-pick our scriptures and oh we're going to do this and make this fit and this one I don't care about you know that may be just his idea but if God thought so much to send you a prophet to turn your heart then it behooves us to listen to what he said it's more than just signs and wonders it's more than just healing and Supernatural the healing and the supernatural doesn't turn your heart the word is what turns your heart the signs and wonders just catches your attention so now this messenger of Malachi 4 they asked a question now this messenger Malachi 4 brother R brings this out in the church age and Revelations 10 is going to do two things write this down you probably already know it but if you don't you you're going to get it tonight one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so the revealing of the seals is what actually turns your heart come on that's where you say Amen the revealing of these seals is what actually turns your heart and you realize he ain't just some preacher but he's a messenger a prophetic messenger god is sent to do what to turn our hearts back you got Ministry out there on TV Land and Ministry out there in radio land what are they doing they're probing at Revelations 10 they're probing at these things and probing at it and probing at it and probing at it let me tell you the days are probing are over for the prde we've received the message we've received the ministry what the days are probing over the seals have been loosed off the back of the book and it's the revelation of those seals that have turned our hearts back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers let me tell you I'm not looking for another church home I'm not looking for another denomination I'm not looking for anything else I found what I came for and that's turn back to that same original p Pentecostal faith in the word of [Music] God now I believe that we can say Malachi 4 has been fulfilled we're speaking about living in the hour of fulfillment so he's he has come and he's performed the word that was a lot of for him to fulfill and we're here today because brother Joe's preaching tonight we're here today because brother Thomas went to your house knocked on your door and said look I want to see you in church tonight no you you're here today because your hearts have been turned some of you were mixed up in all kinds of stuff come on but you're sitting here today because your hearts have been turned let me tell you some of you the devil sat on your shoulder this evening and said you know what you're too tired you've had a long week things didn't work out the way you think you might as well just stay home but you're here tonight because something pulled you here because your heart has been turned and you couldn't stay home as much as you wanted to as much as this old flesh wanted desire to but you're here why because you heard a message and your heart has been turned turned Hallelujah the greatest thing that can ever happen to you young people is have a heart that's been turned turned away from worldism turned away from popularism turn away from Fascism and everything else trying to be Who's Who and everything let me tell you you don't need to be who who in some message Camp you need to be who who in God's kingdom let God do the work don't trying to fasten yourself after somebody else that you're never going to measure up to whether that be boy or girl I used to tell people I I look I was fat and happy back when I was a teenager why you laugh I was 220 lbs you know what I know what I look like you can't hide 220 FBS stacked in 5'5 5' 6 it shows brother John you think I let it bother me absolutely not I strutted my stuff all of it I was happy in myself you say well why' you lose weight cuz I wasn't dumb but I didn't try to be something that I was I knew I was fat chunky short tell everybody you know what I may not be tall darkg and handsome but I'm short Stumpy and cute it's all right to be short Stumpy and cute not everybody could be Andrew Glover tall dark and handsome but we fine let's get back to the scriptures here let's look here in Hebrews 1 and verse one we're going to see how God talks to us is this okay tonight I didn't know I was going to be here but we're here brother Thomas persuaded me I like you know what he's a faithful Pastor he needs a break so just stay one extra day and give him a break let him sit back and enjoy and just Feast do some things that we enjoy we've had a great time fellowshipping with brother Thomas and brother Tommy woo we're going to do it again in December Lord willing okay maybe y'all didn't know that but Hebrews 1 and verse one god notice who's who it is God not man who at Su dry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the father's by theologians no not theologians by prophets and he's God and I don't change so if this is the way God does things it's the way God will always do things because God doesn't change his pattern so God in sundri times that means old times now that's ain't 1960 so don't think it's that old this is old times so we find divver maners he wrote the Bible by the prophets he wrote the Bible by notice his own chosen way so God didn't need me God didn't need you God didn't need the greatest ministers as that we have around the land today to tell them how to write the Bible he chose it and wrote it the way he wanted it written so he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way he didn't have to write it that way neither did he had to save Man by Blood he didn't have to preach the gospel by man he could have let the son of moon and stars preach the gospel he could have let the winds hum the gospel but he chose man he chose the way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being part of God's word declaring the revelation of his word to the age and to that time for the word of God came to the prophets only the word of God came to the prophets only never does it come to a theologian it only comes to prophets God can out lie how many can say Amen to that we will find I have a scripture here we're going to get to that's going to back that up the word of God over a hundred times in the Old Testament the prophets speaking the Lord came to me or the word of the Lord came to me see it always comes to a prophet that's God's order that's God's pattern that's God's plan so then notice now so it comes to the prophet and the Believers of that Prophet they watch for the Fulfillment of it of what their Prophet said as identification that he is truly a god--all prophet because if it do doesn't come to pass then he is not a god--all prophet he is a liar and if he's a liar then you get away from the man no different than the man standing behind this desk tonight Sunday or whenever you have if he's up here preaching fallacy and false teaching and false Doctrine and lies and prophesying it doesn't come to pass you need to drag that man to this Altar and tell him to get that lion Spirit off of him but we watch believers they watch for the Fulfillment of what he says to make sure it comes to pass so brother B would tell us now the church what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost has to keep on doing until the church age closes now second Peter 1 and verse 21 I know you're a W for that scripture so here we go for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so God has a method so there's no reason to be ashamed of God's method there's no reason to be embarrassed because we claim and we believe that God sent us a prophet in this day because we can back it up scripturally so Pentecost is the pattern see you can't change the pattern church we can't change the pattern to fit our ideas we can't change the pattern to fit our personalities and our makeups and you know I don't like this so I'm going to take this part out no we have to fit ourself to fit the pattern notice Elisha could not put on Elijah's robe until he matured enough so the robe would fit him now he could have had a seamstress kind of cut it here cut it there and sew it back up here and sew it back up there and fit but it wasn't the original we don't want some second-handed roow we want the original we want that double portion poured back on us therefore we must mature to fit the word and not cut the word to fit us now full obedience to the word will entitle you to the Token life it entitles you to the Holy Ghost full obedience that means you come in line to the word and you find well well you know here we find things today people will say well brother bandam never mentioned that or brother bham never discussed that well maybe that wasn't a thing at that time but notice if you look at the world and the trend of the world and you can see the fads of the world and if that thing is going with the fads of the world it doesn't take a prophet to come and tell you it's wrong you look at the FBS of the world and you can recognize that's not of God so we can need to be a stute enough to recognize these things don't cut yourself or don't cut the word to fit you but cut yourself to fit the word don't pick and choose what you're going to receive and what you're not going to receive you got to receive it all say Lord help me to have the understanding of these things so that I can clearly be what you want me to be let's keep going I'm going to try to close this out and whatever time I get done he says now notice Believers wait for the word to be confirmed so it was not wrote by man but by the Lord God therefore it's not a book of man now I'm going to shine some light here this is what brother bam says in modern events made clear through prophecy he says somebody said well you know it's just a old Hebrew writings a book of old Hebrew writings and he says now would the Hebrews write a letter that condemned them eles would that fine nation of Jews self-styled polished would they write their own iniquities and condemning themselves certainly not tell of his own sins how they went into idolatry and how they committed fornications against God's word no they never would tell that that proud Nation nor would you write an all tale novel telling of everything that you've ever done there's some things that we have done that we don't want anybody to know but God so therefore the book The Bible is not a book wrote by man or it's a book wrote by God and God moved on these men to tell these deep dark dirty secrets so that they can have faith in knowing that that's how God chooses to speak he said God does his own choosing by predestination chooses the prophets for every age notice he fixes his nature yeah that's right he fixes his nature of the Prophet to fit the age he fits his style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or Not educated he fits his gifts the manner that he'll preach in the gifts he'll have and the message for the certain age God predestinated a certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place and God not only does that for profits but he does it also for preachers not every preacher is the same They Don't Preach in the same style the same Cadence and the same passion some of us are teachers not me some of us are evangelists I raise my hand some of us are pastors some of us are are you know missionaries there's five different degrees or five different levels that God chooses we're not all Cookie Cutter thank God some of you are extroverts some of you are introverts cuz you're introverting right now right this is a time to extrovert I tell my friends so they don't get mad at me look I'm 50/50 I'll introvert for 50% I'm going extrovert for 50% you better hope you get the extrovert because when I introvert I'm checking out my people meet her pegs out and I'm going to my bedroom see you later I love people but I love me too at least I got some honest people in here tonight but God fixes the nature I love what he says here he says he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour and it's not a mistake that God makes to man of the hour be happy with your pastor don't go looking around some other Pastor I wish I had so and so from my past God makes the man of the hour that catch the people of the hour God knows exactly what you have need of in Elon Kentucky therefore he sent you a faithful Minister and he equipped him with a kick here in Brother Brad to do what so that he would preach to you Sundays and Wednesdays to meet the needs of the hour what God did it in a prophet he also does in a Ministry wonderful God wonderful notice a prophet will be in his nature and manners this Prophet this Prophet messenger we're speaking of now he will be like the Elijah and John see the prophet message will be in this nature and manners as were Elijah and John the people of the prophet's message day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's day and since it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned it's only the children that'll listen come on somebody since it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned it's only the children that will listen oh somebody come on say Amen again realizing you're not out there on the outside you're hearing it because because your heart has been turned therefore you will listen whether it's encouragement you will listen whether it's correction you will listen whatever it is coming from behind the pulpit because your heart has been turned you will listen young people you will listen all right let's keep going this is good stuff y'all didn't know I could teach did you what is a prophet how many wants to know what a prophet is about three of y'all all right well y'all see me after church we're going to stop notice now we're speaking to the young people I want you to understand what is a prophet why why do we need a prophet because God has always used but what is a prophet he's a Seer a prophet he he's a brother B will say it's there's a difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophecy a prophet he the gift of Prophecy is that when it has a gift and a a gift of Prophecy must be judged by two or three spiritual men and it can come on one person tonight and another person the next night and another person the next night but it has to be judged by two or three spiritual men but a G a prophet he's born a prophet he's not ordained a Prophet by man he's not laid Hands On by man he's not declared by man or some theology or or some School of Theology or some denominational backing he is a born a prophet he's born a prophet and we find the scripture for that we find it in Jeremiah and the Bible would tell us Jeremiah before I formed you in the womb I called you and ordained you a prophet so prophets are not chosen by man because you know what we would do just like they did when Samuel came to anoint David you look to the best you want the best you wouldn't pick some five foot five short Stumpy little cute preacher you're supposed to laugh no you're GNA find that nice eloquent one that can talk and he doesn't spit and slobber you know he can put it all together and that's what we want but what does God want God wants one that's going to get a little bit fiery sometimes and slobber sometimes he may stumble over his word sometimes but he's God called I was talking to a brother the other day he says you know I've never been ordained I've never had a no know hands laid on me I said you don't need to have that I mean that's all fine and dandy if if man I you know if they lay hands on you ordained you a preacher I said but if God called you God's ordained you I said I ain't never had nobody lay hands on me but I can tell you one thing God uses my Ministry because I'm called by God I'm not called by man and if some man laid hands on me and ordain me then what happens when that man dies and he ain't there let me tell you my faith is not in some man my faith is in my calling and the one who has called me and that's who I preach for that's why I believe the way I [Applause] believe and it goes the same for you you may not be called the priest but you're called The Living you're called the serve God and it ain't based on what some man sees over you or what some man has picked you and said this in a prayer line or whatever if God called you and turned your heart that's all you need to know tonight is I've been called by God I've been elected by God I've been chosen by God and I'm not going back that's all you need to know tonight don't worry about some man's and find an influence by some man your influence comes by the word of God your Vindication comes by you receiving the message and your heart has been turned and your Nature's been changed your desires are different Hallelujah notice so a prophet now we got to get back on that I got to I got to hurry up notice a prophet is a Seer and he's referred to in the Bible as an eagle see prophetic and intercessors has often been compared to eagles with good reason Eagles habitually live in high places with some preferring to Nest on high Cliffs and when on a hunt their King eyesight allows them to spot their prey about three miles away look I'm barely seeing my Bow Peep site about t inches and an eagle can see three miles away they have an entirely different view of the world than the ground bound creatures do and the prophet of God will tell a see a prophet is a sear he's referred to in the Bible as an eagle who goes way up high in the air higher that you go the further you see so the eagle Soares up higher than any other bird there's no bird can go with an eagle there's no eye like the eagle see the Hulk hasn't got a chance in his sight the Hulk cannot stand the altitude of where the eagle can soar or he would die see he doesn't he hasn't got the makeup that the eagle has so an eagle would raise up high and he could see things that we don't see he could see trouble coming before trouble's there he can see the storm brewing before the storm is there and God likened his Prophet to an eagle that would go up he said he would go up he would climb into the rims notice he says he climbs beyond the emotion of the church because sometimes seems like that's all our faith with the church is happy I'm happy when the church is down I'm down come on see a prophet rise he climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of hand he goes beyond the joy among the Saints he goes beyond all that and God brings him up into a real alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see the things to come then he brings him back down among the members of the body to foretell them what is in the making so a prophet is not a prophet for his own account but God has called him and lifts him up into a real alone opens his eyes and he begins to look and see and he begins to see things that are coming then he comes down then he begins to share modern events made clear through prophecy he begins to share what's coming seven continuous Visions he begins to share what's going to happen in the end time cuz he's seeing it long before it ever comes a prophet notice now when I was back in the Baptist Church man they used to have me so scared of the Rapture you know what's going to happen in the Baptist Church when a Rapture takes place airplanes are going to fall out of the sky you telling me that every pilot is a Christian because they crashing planes are going to run off the tracks so every person that drives a train he's a Christian too cars are going to run off the road there's going to be uh crashes and all kind of craziness going on see that's their view of the Rapture but what did God do in this hour God sent a prophet messenger he went up into the Heavenly real and he came back down and he told you according to the scripture that he's going to come as a thief in the night you will not even know that he came and took you until years later months later you'll be looking for us and we'll be gone that's the only time life is going to continue as it all always was you know how it is somebody steals something from you you you don't miss it immediately well when you go to looking for it and you can't find it somebody done broke in cuz they didn't go banging on the door at 12:00 at night to come in your house they slipped through they found the crack in the window they slid something through the door lock and opened up and made their they were quiet they tiptoed they didn't make a sound they didn't wake nobody in the house it ain't going to be Trains and Automobiles crashing it's going to be as a thief in the night one minute you're going to be here the next minute you're going to be gone see thank God that we had a Prophet come thank God that we're not like the world that's having to be on medicine and any and a depression pills because they're so worried and so concerned of where their salvation lies and what's going to happen when the Rapture takes place where they going to be will they make it can they make it let me tell you we know we will make it we know we had a voice in this hour we had a messenger in this hour come and tell us these things and modern events are being made clear now by prophecy long before it ever took place God lifted him up in 1933 and he be to see things that were coming woo beautiful stuff that's why I don't bother me about a message it don't bother me about a prophet you going to follow a man whether he's headquartered in this city that City this denomination that denomination I follow mine he follows this one Hallelujah so let's keep going all right it's 8:15 what time you want me to stop all right nobody said anything notice a prophet is also a gift of knowledge and knowledge is like an attorney he studies the books and when you hire an attorney you ain't going to hire a dummy you want to make sure you get one that knows the law and so a prophet as I spoke to you Sunday he goes back and he looks at what the other prophets before him wrote to make sure that what he is saying is in line with what they said because if he says anything different then he's not a god- called Prophet notice a gift of knowledge in the Bible is a prophecy which goes up and finds out the things that are to come and brings them back down and but they must compare with the Bible see then the word that God has spoken I want you to catch this part right here this is in the impersonation of Christianity then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time catch that it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is that the prophet catches what God has already he said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word it's laying out way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and he sees the time coming so it's only of gift of knowledge that brings it down and puts it on paper and for us he put it on real to real put it on tape put it on CD now it's on MP3 so a prophet is the word this is in the revelation of Jesus Christ a prophet is the word we know that the word Prophet means divine interpreter of the word so the Divine word is wrote The Prophet has a Divine gift of God within him and you know the prophet in the Old Testament he was called a God so if you go to John 10 and verse 33 the Pharisees here are talking to Jesus and Jesus answered them he says now is it not written in your law I said you are gods and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came to referring to the prophets and the scripture cannot be broken so he's telling them well I'm saying I'm a Son of God but yet you can say that the prophets are called God and you're having a problem with me saying I'm just a Son of God not God at all so we find this when you go to Exodus 71 the Lord said unto Moses I have made thee a God to Pharaoh I've made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron is your Prophet he's your mouthpiece so a prophet is God's mouthpiece notice he will not be God but he will be God's mouthpiece and there's never been in any Age Two Major Prophets on the earth at one time Elijah and Elijah walked arm and arm but Elisha never put on Elijah's robe until Elijah left only one major prophet in a generation yeah that's right one major prophet in a generation now you find there's people that claim they going to be they're going to fulfill they're going to finish what the seventh message left off hogwash call it hogwash one major prophet to a generation we have received that major prophet he's gone up he's broke the seals he loosed the seals he told us the things that are come he talked about a Rapture we're going to be there we know all these things we're not looking for somebody else to come and finish we got what we need all we got to do is heed what the prophet warned us about make preparation that we will fit that same scripture in that same life when he comes to catch away the bride we will go with him so how do we do that you line up to the word so there's one major Propet to a generation we'll keep moving on Jeremiah we talked about that jeremiah: 15 before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet to the Nations so a prophet is not called by man when I first came to the ministry I will be honest with you brother Brad I struggled because I didn't have nobody tell me I was God called you know how sometimes you want somebody to tell you give you a little encouragement I see a gift in your life no nobody told me no but there was something there because look before I came to the message I was about to go to Seminary cuz I knew what God did for me when I when he took me out of the world I was on fire for God I quit drinking I quit cussing I quit partying I quit womanizing I quit it all before I came to this message because I met God and I want to do something and so a local church Baptist Church reach reached out to me and said we want you to be our youth pastor and we'll send you to Seminary I'm like man yeah this is what I'm talking about I want to do something for God and at the same time that that was happening I come in contact with the message you want to talk about spiritual warfare Satan trying to keep his man that's why I said Satan you had me when I was in the world but you had to let go then you had me when I was in the denomination but you had to let go why because God already a seed on the inside and it may be covered up with sin it may be covered up with religious ideas but oh Hallelujah one day one day that seed's going to burst out to life I know it's Wednesday night but we can have hey I just saw a clip of your pastor jumping all over the place slobbering telling exhorting y'all for gratitude or attitude or something of that nature man we can have church up in here knowing that we're in line everything we believe is backed by the Bible this ain't some fairy tale this ain't some good book feeling this is thus sayith the lord it's in the word you can hang your soul on every word written in this Bible you don't have to fear you don't have to be ashamed of it you don't have to be embarrassed it's backed up by the Bible and it's backed up by God yes it notice this Prophet we're going to hurry up and bring this down this prophet he goes up and he SE things he sees the cup of iniquity full before it's filled didn't Isaiah say there's going to be Darkness upon the land and gross Darkness upon the people now Isaiah is a prophet it ain't no telling how many years it's 3,000 4,000 years ago God lifted up this Prophet into a rim and guess what he's seeing our day he's seeing our day he's seeing Darkness upon the land you telling me LGBT TQ and all this other stuff we got all the woke generation everything out there that's Darkness on the land and gross Darkness upon the people I was just reading a news report today that AAR this girlfriend of of this guy she sicked a Pit Bull or a rockwaller on a 9-year-old little girl and it killed her that's gross Darkness upon the people telling me a grown woman sicked a dog on a nine-year-old girl and killed her and people do this stuff all the time they have no regard for human life that's gross Darkness we're living in a day and God sent a prophet in Isaiah notice he also said he spoke about the coming of the Lord Isaiah got lifted up got lifted up and prophesied a virgin shall conceive you want to talk about ridiculous yeah what you talking about Isaiah what you've been smoking that's how we would say it today you done bumped your head nut head no God lifted him up and people today they want to question your Prophet they want to question what he got lifted up look I don't question it you question all you want I'm living it that's right I know where I was and I know that what what what couldn't be done out there in denominational system it got done in this system cuz it ain't some man-made Kingdom it's God's kingdom it's a kingdom of redemption it's a kingdom of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a kingdom of a nature change it's a life change and I know what I was and I know what I am today and it ain't been by some man but God said a word and the word has changed us and God deals with us through a prophet therefore I'm not ashamed to say I believe that God sent a prophet not ashamed at all brother Ram says prophets are the chief sign prophets are the chief sign God's chief sign is a prophet if God is going to speak he will send a prophet you hear me if God is going to speak he will send a prophet they are his word made manifest for the age that's the reason a prophet always God's chief sign and in another place I just listened to it that a prophet is a true sign that's overlooked because it doesn't go with the mainstream because it sounds a little bit oldfashioned it sounds a little bit spiritual sounds a little bit religious fanatic cultish y'all drank the Kool-Aid no we a drink the Kool-Aid we got to fill with the Holy Spirit cu the holy spirit will lead us and guide us into all truth I tell people when I I had a buddy of mine I'm sharing some personal stuff I had a buddy of mine when I first came to this message he and I went to church together we study together you know we were College not roommates but we were college buddies and man we spent all kind of time together when when I when I came to this message man he got online I started finding out about serpent seed and about this and about that and all this stuff and he called me on the phone he said Joe you're in a Coke get out he was crying a grown man crying to me get out he what in this world does this deal with the serpent SE I didn't know squat all I knew is something they got I ain't got and I want it and so I began to study by the time I mean I studied and I studied and you know God was already pulling on me to preach but I was studying and studying and studying so I had the opportunity brother Thomas said go back to my hometown or the town where we went to college and he was still in college and I'd already graduated and I invited him over to my hotel room he done messed up now old boy got about a year understanding behind him so we went back there man I broke serpent seed down to him I said come on let's go to Genesis 3 let's look at it you tell me what the Bible says about it I made him read it with his own mouth he couldn't deny I will put him INE between thy seed and the Serpent's Seed that's thus sayeth the Lord you can't argue with the word either he's right or he's wrong either he had a seat or he didn't have a seat and he walked out of my hotel room with his head between his leg because he realized the word never fails you may not understand it I may not understand it but it ain't based on understanding it is based on Revelation and I believe God has sent us exactly what we have need of to get out of here divine revelation of the written word a prophet of God will bring that divine revelation I love it God always sends a prophet he always has he always will that's his method numbers 12 and verse 6 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream God has a way of doing things let's keep going here hallelujah amen let me find my place so a prophet is an interpreter for a deity a prophet a Seer there's a difference between the gift of Prophecy and the office of a prophet so we find God never changes he always does it the same he said the coming of a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak and if he's spoken which we believe he has because our Prophet or his prophet is off the scene let me just say this we have to listen to him we have to study this word study what he says make it make sense understand also that as a man he grew in his Revelation and understanding some of the things he preached in 57 58 59 he got more clarity in 63 64 65 remember in 63 he became a brand new book therefore the things he used to see prior to 63 he was dealing with Lucen after 63 he had a new book come on church I'm trying to tell you even though he's a prophet he's still a human he had his own share of mistakes but when it came to thus sayith the Lord he never once failed because it wasn't him cuz he could only speak what God put in his mouth so a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak and he doesn't change we found that out in Malachi 3 and we we look here in Revelations 10 brother B would tell us in God's only provided place of worship that a prophet is God's reflector how many knows that all right good a reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't the reflection see there has to be something strike the reflector to reflect it to make it reflect so let me just kind of put it in Louisiana terminology brother Joe you got a life-sized mirror in your bedroom you walk by it boy what are you doing you're looking in the mirror what it reflecting oh your silliness but see that's what we are to God that's what a prophet is he's only mirroring out reflecting what is being reflected to you know me I like look when I get in a full length mirror man I like to show out oh yeah brother Tommy knows what I'm talking about we got guns I may be close to 50 but hey I still got it get in there and start posing like Jessica yeah you ain't marryed no old man whoop whoop get out and show up but I'm only only thing that's going to be reflected back is what I put into it and that's the way it I know that's kind of silly but that's the way it is with god with a prophet he's only reflecting what God has put into it that's right he's a reflect and so are we reflectors so what do we find when we get to Revelations 10 and we find his John type of the bribe he's being encouraged take the book take the book eat the book consume the book but that ain't where it stops it doesn't stop with just well hey I believe God sent a prophet or way you know I believe the message of the hour it's more than just believing thou must prophesy again see it's it's one thing for a prophet to be the mouthpiece of God but notice brother Brandon what tell us there's coming a time that listen what he says he says now the in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at a time but they organized and again the pure word was lost from organization Trends toward they Trend to toward doctors and Creeds and and and they not the simple word and they can no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was a voice with the word in his day and the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation but when the Methodist fell God raised up others and is going through years until this last day there is again a people in the land who under their Messenger will will be the final voice to the final age look it's more than just God said and the prophet we have heard that message we have received that message we have taken that book we had devoured that book and now we are the voice we are the mouthpiece we are God's mouth how do you say we are the mouthpiece I Don't Preach I'm a I'm a lady I'm a sister your life preaches it your long hair your modesty your dignity you young boys you line up to the word you don't tell dirty jokes you're not looking at things you shouldn't looking at your life is clean and holy and modest that's how you preach the message that's how you prophesy again you reflect as a prophet reflects God so do we reflect God let me just say something else you also reflect the leadership of this church you local assembly you also reflect the leadership the Ministry of this church you line up to what is being preached does it mean you have to agree with it all now let's just be honest because sometimes we may see things a little different but because that's your spiritual head your leadership you do it anyway at least you should shouldn't be adversarial so you reflect the views of your church you you reflect the views of your pastor you reflect Christ in all that we do so let's go on I'm going to bring this down right here so to Revelations 10 it shows that the seventh Angel's message will be a person in the last days anointed of God for a Ministry just like Elijah the prophet as predicted in Malachi 4 to reveal the true word of the original word original God in the generation the original word of God in this generation see it's the seven Angel as spoken of Revelations 10 the same person they asked brother Bram excuse me let me let me rephrase this this is in question answerers ask brother is the seventh angel as spoken of in Revelations 10 the same Elijah in Malachi 4 young people this is going to be maybe new for you older people you already know the answer yes it's the same person see Revelations 10 is the seventh Angel's message which the seventh Angel's message of the seventh Church age which is Malachi 4 which turns the heart of the people back to the faith so we're living musicians if you would make your way back we're closing now musicians I mean are y'all out there you have me scared me and brother Thomas have y'all H us lately W brother Josh better make your way buddy oh whoever's closing out excuse me I better stay in my Lane so yes the Malachi 4 and the revelations 10:7 are the same so we're living in the hour of fulfillment I spoke to you on Sunday Israel is in her Homeland first time in 2500 years but before there can be an end time there has to be a prophet Malachi 4:5 and6 must be fulfilled and if not William brandham then who you just answer me that if not William brandham then where is that messenger Prophet messenger that's going to fulfill Malachi 45 and6 I don't care the naysayers in the world you answer me that question before this world will be destroyed there has to be a Malachi 4 Ministry fulfilled there has to be a people whose hearts are turned believe the sign dis believe the sign I don't care about your sign I'm telling you right now there has to be somebody and for me it's already been fulfilled cuz my heart heart has been turned I can't base it on anything else but I know that my heart I don't know about you but I know my heart's been turned Luke 17:30 has been fulfilled we're living in the day of Sodom and gomorra you look around Sodom condition but we also receive the son of man Ministry in this hour that's right think about it if this isn't Sodom and Gomorrah then what age are we living in I hate to see where we will be in 10 years if this is not it now everywhere we go we encounter Sodom Spirits you run headlong in Walmarts gas stations you may not even know but you bumping into those Spirits all the time Sodom gamor liberal remember where there's no vision the people perish lack of restraint do what I want to do I'm en time you can't tell me what to do and some of you did you hear the little press conference your vice president had the other day somebody spoke up and said Jesus Christ is Lord she stopped and said you're at the wrong rally you're at the wrong rally you should be at the little one down the street Sodom condition no desire for God nowhere lgbqt has enter the churches in politics and our school systems churches the Methodist churches now have homosexual preachers transgender gay sitting right in the service say well Jesus loves us all he loves you but he wants to change you you're welcome to come but you're not welcome to stay the same come on in but be changed let the word wash you let it change you let it reach regenerate you but that's not the preaching we find the scriptures are being fulfilled Revelations 3 and verse 20 Jesus Christ is on the outside of his church begging Brother Brad to get back in knocking brother Thomas for somebody to open the door notice samesex couples in the church and he's just trying to call some of them out come out of her my people be not partakers of her plagues Revelations 10:7 the Mysteries have been fulfilled the loose sins from the previous ages have been tied together the seals are all finished then we look in Zechariah 12 and verse 2 and the Bible says and I will make Jerusalem a coup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the people as of the 22nd of May 19 or not 19 but 2024 bise Bolivia Colombia All severed diplomatic relations with Israel bearan Chad Chile Honduras Jordan South Africa turkey have all recall the ambassadors from Israel citing aeli actions during the war US President Joe Biden was warned that Israel risked losing international support over its indiscriminate bombing of civilians in its war against Hamas in a besieged Gaza Strip Biden also suggest suggested that the US views Israel government as extreme that word extreme means a terrorist organization our president suggests that we view Israel as a terror organization some of Israel's closest European allies pressed for a ceasefire in the war with Hamas on a Sunday this has been several weeks ago underscoring growing International unease with the devastating impact of the conflict on Gaza civilians United Nations General Assembly voted 124 to4 on Wednesday to strip Israel of the right to self-defense in the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem telling me that they can come into your home into your neighborhood into your city and you can't fight back several weeks back many of you probably heard Iran bombed Israel with 200 bombs not one hit its Target those that made it through Israel Defense System fell on sand land never even exploding they fell in targets why because God Is Watching Over Israel and if Israel is the natural what about God Watching Over Us you don't have to fear little bride there's nothing that we had to fear if he can watch over naturalism and keep her safe without anybody being destroyed any death anything what about us we have nothing to fear God has sent you a message God has sent you a word we are living in the hour of fulfillment we are there
