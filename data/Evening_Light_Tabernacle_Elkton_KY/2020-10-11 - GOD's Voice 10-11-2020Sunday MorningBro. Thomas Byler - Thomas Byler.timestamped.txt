[1:55] this morning
[1:56] you're looking at a person that at the
[1:58] age of 20 years old
[2:01] into drugs van halen ac dc
[2:05] there is something down in here amen
[2:09] that said you know there's just more to
[2:12] life
[2:13] than partying sinning
[2:17] because you see folks young people
[2:19] listen don't you don't ever have to try
[2:21] that stuff
[2:22] it'll only do one thing sure it'll make
[2:25] a good feeling in your body it'll be a
[2:27] real good feeling
[2:28] but the next morning you will wake up
[2:31] and feel like a
[2:32] corpse just empty
[2:38] it's horrible i'm here to tell you it's
[2:40] a horrible feeling
[2:42] to be empty inside
[2:46] to have no spirit because i'm here to
[2:48] tell you folks listen
[2:49] no matter how long you've been a
[2:50] christian i mean it is this holy spirit
[2:53] that gives you strength it is god's
[2:56] spirit that gives you
[2:57] power gives you strength gives you
[3:01] energy
[3:03] that is truly the good feeling is the
[3:05] holy ghost
[3:07] all that others just empty you out amen
[3:10] and
[3:10] oh my you know that's why you see
[3:11] hollywood people that are
[3:13] super rich and they gotta have another
[3:15] tattoo they're just not happy
[3:17] they gotta have another ring they gotta
[3:18] have tattoo their eyelids and they gotta
[3:20] they're totally empty inside they're
[3:24] trying to get a satisfaction somehow
[3:26] and they're never satisfied that's why
[3:29] jesus says you know
[3:31] come unto me i'll give you a drink where
[3:32] you'll never thirst again
[3:37] hallelujah i'm so thankful the bible
[3:40] says
[3:40] blessed are they that have an ear
[3:44] to hear you realize how blessed you are
[3:47] this morning
[3:48] to have an ear to hear because the bible
[3:50] said that to him that hath
[3:52] to him shall be given
[3:55] but to him that hath not to him shall be
[3:58] taken even what he has
[4:01] so if there's something down in your
[4:03] soul you have
[4:04] something that searches for more blessed
[4:08] audited hunger and thirst
[4:10] for they shall be filled
[4:13] the most blessed thing that anybody
[4:16] young person anybody can have
[4:17] is the heart to desire more of god
[4:22] to desire to be filled with his spirit
[4:24] to desire
[4:25] to be a son of god you have something
[4:29] how many knows there's something that
[4:30] you have
[4:31] jesus talked about that something
[4:34] because the woman at the well
[4:35] that was ill-famed amen when jesus come
[4:38] and he began to talk to her
[4:40] ask for a drink and so forth isn't that
[4:42] right
[4:44] amen whenever he begin to say you know
[4:46] she said you know when the messiah comes
[4:48] we know when he comes
[4:49] he'll tell us these things
[4:52] is that right when the messiah comes
[4:55] he'll tell us
[4:56] these things you know
[4:59] but the pharisees see they say he
[5:01] deserved the thoughts and intents of the
[5:02] heart also
[5:03] the pharisees knew it isn't that right
[5:07] but they called him a mind reader
[5:11] a piazzi pub a fortune teller
[5:15] a chief of devils why because they had
[5:18] not
[5:19] they didn't have something in here
[5:24] amen and then that woman of the world
[5:26] man she went into the city said isn't
[5:28] this the very messiah
[5:30] she had something she had representation
[5:33] she was a daughter of god god
[5:38] i want to tell you this morning if you
[5:39] believe in your heart at all that you're
[5:41] a son and daughter of god
[5:43] you believe that with all your heart
[5:44] you've got to be the happiest person in
[5:46] the world
[5:48] just to believe that let alone
[5:51] leave it with all your heart and to know
[5:54] that god has done the work in your life
[5:56] he's made a change in you amen
[6:00] because you have passed from death unto
[6:03] life to know that you're son of god
[6:05] what an honor what a privilege it is
[6:08] amen
[6:12] i'm gonna jump around a little bit okay
[6:15] listen to this
[6:16] i'm just gonna read what i just preached
[6:18] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[6:21] and to him that hath and he shall have
[6:23] more abundance
[6:24] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[6:26] taken even
[6:27] that which he had i mean those people
[6:30] will lose the very life that they do
[6:32] have
[6:34] but if you've got something down on the
[6:35] inside there amen you're going to have
[6:38] more of an i came to give you life that
[6:41] more abundantly jesus said
[6:44] therefore speak eye to them in parable
[6:46] because they seeing
[6:48] see not and hearing
[6:52] they hear not they heard the voice of
[6:55] god then
[6:56] they heard the voice of god whenever
[6:58] jesus would speak
[7:01] but yet they didn't hear it
[7:07] you i could go through it i won't go
[7:09] through it but you can go through
[7:10] where jesus was talking to them and they
[7:12] were saying
[7:13] don't we say well that thou art was born
[7:15] in fornication and has a devil
[7:18] and he would go on and try to convince
[7:20] him you know no i do the works that my
[7:22] father does and you believe me not
[7:24] is that right
[7:27] and he tried to convince him but they
[7:29] just couldn't hear
[7:31] that right they just didn't have
[7:33] something in there to hear with
[7:37] and shall not understand listen what he
[7:39] says
[7:40] it's because they're seeing see not and
[7:42] hearing they hear
[7:44] not neither do they understand
[7:47] you try to witness to some people and it
[7:49] doesn't matter how much you try to
[7:50] convince them and how much
[7:52] scripture you'll show them they just
[7:54] can't see it
[7:57] huh and you know i want to say most of
[8:00] the time it's because of their church's
[8:02] teaching
[8:03] all right their church is teaching in
[8:05] the way that they have been taught
[8:06] it's contrary to what they have been
[8:08] taught so they don't think it can be
[8:10] right that's exactly how the pharisees
[8:12] were it was contrary to what they
[8:14] thought therefore it couldn't be true
[8:17] amen god don't ask anybody
[8:20] how to do it where to do it who to do it
[8:23] through
[8:24] is that right but it's up to
[8:28] every soul to find out what god speaks
[8:31] who god speaks through
[8:32] and what god speaks amen and come and
[8:35] hear that
[8:36] and if you're a child of god this is the
[8:37] thing let me i've got a couple more good
[8:39] scriptures
[8:40] listen so he says here by hearing yeshua
[8:44] for in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[8:46] isaiah
[8:47] which saith by hearing they shall hear
[8:49] and shall not understand
[8:51] and seeing ye shall see but shall not
[8:55] get it perceive it amen
[8:58] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[9:01] their ears are dull of hearing
[9:03] and their eyes have they closed at least
[9:05] at any time
[9:06] they should see with their eyes and hear
[9:08] with their ears and should understand
[9:11] with their heart i mean believe that's
[9:14] truly
[9:14] where the understanding comes to it's in
[9:17] the heart that's where you got to
[9:18] understand from
[9:21] uh can i just speak what comes to mind
[9:24] it's like listening to a preacher
[9:25] brother right
[9:27] it's like listening to a preacher
[9:29] everybody as you hear the preacher
[9:32] something in your heart is either
[9:34] telling you whether that's really the
[9:35] truth or not
[9:36] right something's telling you
[9:39] you have to be able to learn you have to
[9:41] be able to understand that
[9:43] all right now look let's go on
[9:45] understand what they're
[9:46] and should be converted and i should
[9:50] heal them but blessed are your eyes for
[9:53] they see
[9:54] and your ears for they hear for verily i
[9:57] say unto you that many prophets and
[9:59] righteous men have desired to see the
[10:00] things
[10:01] which you see and have not seen them
[10:06] and to hear those things which ye hear
[10:08] and have not
[10:09] heard them praise be to god
[10:13] have not heard them all right
[10:16] give me a second here matthew 13. i have
[10:19] a lot of scriptures and i want to try to
[10:20] keep them all as much as straight as i
[10:22] can
[10:22] praise the lord let's go to revelations
[10:26] now
[10:28] actually before revelation so i'm going
[10:30] to i want to i wanna show you something
[10:32] else over in saint john
[10:34] a couple more scriptures let's actually
[10:36] go to 6 john 8 first
[10:38] go to saint john 8.
[10:58] and we'll begin with verse 39
[11:02] they answered and said unto him abraham
[11:04] is our father
[11:05] and jesus said unto them if you were
[11:07] abraham's children ye would do the works
[11:09] of abraham
[11:11] but now ye seek to kill me a man that
[11:13] has told you the truth
[11:15] which i have heard of god this did not
[11:17] abraham i want to stop there for just a
[11:19] second
[11:20] remember this one thing that if they
[11:22] cannot
[11:24] uh get get you to quit condemning people
[11:28] for not accepting god or
[11:30] so forth they'll actually try to kill
[11:32] your voice
[11:34] amen people will actually kill you
[11:36] rather than try to hear
[11:37] you tell them the truth people hate the
[11:39] truth
[11:41] people don't want the truth amen that's
[11:44] the way the pharisee they did not want
[11:46] to hear the truth
[11:48] remember stephen when he was preaching
[11:49] they closed their ears
[11:51] and ran upon him and gnashed him and
[11:53] took him out and killed him for telling
[11:54] them
[11:55] the truth the truth comes with a price
[11:59] let me tell you something not many
[12:01] churches not many preachers dare tell
[12:03] the truth anymore
[12:05] it's getting to where even here even me
[12:08] sometimes you almost
[12:09] think about what you want to say or
[12:10] don't want to say sometimes
[12:12] you talk about homosexuality you talk
[12:15] about black lives matter
[12:16] you talk about this side or the other
[12:17] and guess what look out you never know
[12:19] what's going to happen
[12:23] huh but a servant of god doesn't fear
[12:27] the truth gets told i don't care who it
[12:30] is
[12:30] because you're not going to get it up in
[12:31] the white house you're not going to get
[12:33] in congress
[12:37] amen i want to talk to you about the
[12:40] voice of politics here in a minute yet
[12:42] but listen so he says here uh let's go
[12:45] on
[12:48] you do the deeds of your father verse 41
[12:52] they said unto him we be not born of
[12:54] fornication
[12:56] oh my how many knows your minds were
[12:59] completely somewhere else here god was
[13:02] speaking to
[13:03] them reaching out to them trying to get
[13:05] them to see
[13:06] but they just would not see
[13:10] we be not born of fornication we have
[13:12] one father even god
[13:14] huh that's let me tell you something
[13:15] that's what so many so-called people
[13:17] that
[13:18] claim to be christians well i believe
[13:20] god but i don't believe he'll send a
[13:22] prophet
[13:22] even though he was vindicated world
[13:24] around jesus came and did the very same
[13:27] things
[13:27] he did when he walked on the earth only
[13:30] many many more times
[13:31] more and people just throw that out
[13:34] man can't be
[13:39] no listen he says we have one father
[13:41] even god and jesus said unto them if god
[13:43] were your father
[13:45] you would love me
[13:48] praise the lord for i proceeded forth
[13:51] and came from god neither i came up
[13:52] myself but he sent me
[13:54] why do you not understand my speech why
[13:57] he was trying to convince him
[13:58] why don't you even because you cannot
[14:01] hear my word
[14:05] oh my isn't that where this sometimes
[14:08] when you get an argument with somebody
[14:09] you almost have to yell
[14:12] and it don't do no good either does it
[14:13] they still don't hear
[14:17] it doesn't no matter how loud no matter
[14:19] how much you say like
[14:21] can't you understand what i'm saying
[14:23] they still don't have them
[14:25] they just couldn't get it even because
[14:28] you cannot hear
[14:29] my word why do you think jesus says
[14:33] you're blessed
[14:35] if you can believe the truth you of your
[14:38] father the devil
[14:39] and the lusts of your father will you do
[14:42] very
[14:42] voice of god lord jesus help them
[14:46] god telling them that they are of their
[14:47] father the devil
[14:52] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[14:54] abode not into truth
[14:55] because there is no truth in him even
[14:57] when he speaketh a lie
[14:59] he speaketh of his phone for he's a liar
[15:01] and the father of it
[15:02] and because i tell you the truth you
[15:06] believe me not let me tell you something
[15:10] anybody that won't believe the truth
[15:12] will gladly believe a lie
[15:18] anybody don't believe the truth they
[15:20] don't mind accepting a lie
[15:24] which of you convinces me of sin if i
[15:27] say the truth and you do not believe me
[15:29] why do you not believe me
[15:31] here's the point that i want to get to
[15:33] he
[15:34] that is of god heareth
[15:37] god's words
[15:41] there ye therefore hear them not because
[15:45] ye are not of god
[15:50] how many believes that we're supposed to
[15:51] be the mouthpiece of god
[15:54] here at evening like tabernacle i don't
[15:55] care where you are
[15:57] any church any person any christian that
[15:59] claims to be a christian
[16:01] has should have the voice of god in
[16:04] their hearts
[16:05] fathers to your wife wife to your
[16:08] children
[16:08] you should be god's voice to those
[16:10] children
[16:12] amen over in
[16:16] first john
[16:20] 4
[16:35] and we'll begin with verse four ye are
[16:38] of god little children and have overcome
[16:41] them because greater is he that is in
[16:43] you
[16:44] than he that is in the world they are of
[16:47] the world therefore they speak they
[16:49] of the world amen and the world heareth
[16:52] them
[16:52] in other words birds of a feather flock
[16:54] together isn't that right
[16:57] we are of god john was so confident that
[17:01] when he wrote these sentences
[17:02] we are a god and he that knoweth god
[17:06] hears us wow
[17:10] how many believes that this morning that
[17:11] if anybody out there is of god
[17:14] they'll hear you just as sure
[17:18] as jesus said my sheep
[17:21] hear and know my voice
[17:26] and a stranger's voice they will not
[17:29] follow
[17:31] now how many knows that the bleed of a
[17:33] sheep and the bleed of a goat
[17:34] is very very similar and it's very hard
[17:39] to tell
[17:39] i probably couldn't even tell the
[17:40] difference if i heard a goat bleeding
[17:41] i'd say there's a sheep
[17:45] very very similar so sometimes somebody
[17:48] knows that sometimes
[17:49] the voice of truth and the voice of
[17:51] error is
[17:52] really really close
[17:57] [Music]
[17:58] amen let me just tell you what comes to
[18:01] mind is that okay
[18:02] it reminds me that take a group of
[18:04] people like this take a church
[18:06] amen in the devil he is the absolute
[18:10] master
[18:11] at bringing to me i thank god there's no
[18:13] division no reason why i'm preaching
[18:14] this other than the holy spirit but
[18:16] listen
[18:16] he knows how to try to get people at
[18:18] odds try to cause a division
[18:20] try to cause problems in church
[18:24] somebody will say you know i'll tell you
[18:25] what there's something going on in the
[18:27] church somebody's doing and they ought
[18:29] to quit and we ought to straighten this
[18:30] out we ought to
[18:32] straighten that you know and this ought
[18:34] to be that way i want a better church
[18:36] i want to be right i want to do this in
[18:38] the name of righteousness
[18:39] we'll cause a stir
[18:42] in that right and brother baby says man
[18:44] he can tell you about so and so what
[18:46] they did and how evil they are
[18:48] he says it may sound so right but
[18:50] brother brown said remember
[18:52] it's the devil
[18:56] remember it sounds so right
[18:59] and so good but it's the devil
[19:03] he says nine times out of ten if you
[19:05] trace it down the person that's making
[19:08] the stir
[19:09] is the one that's not right
[19:12] amen so
[19:16] the devil's clever he is rude and let me
[19:19] tell you something
[19:20] it's a miracle for a church to be held
[19:22] together
[19:23] and to stay together amen because you
[19:26] take a lukewarm believer you take a
[19:28] make-believer and that is a
[19:29] prime subject a make-believer or
[19:32] whatever
[19:32] to for the devil to work in because
[19:36] those are the people that want to be
[19:37] holier
[19:38] you know they want to be more righteous
[19:40] and so we got to do this we got no
[19:42] you let god operate you let god deal
[19:44] with somebody comes and pass
[19:45] you let the pastor preach on it when god
[19:47] you know deals with it hello
[19:50] let the holy spirit like my wife man you
[19:52] know brother al not sitting here this
[19:54] morning but when his wife
[19:55] you know kept wearing pants after she
[19:56] proclaimed christianity and she said you
[19:58] just keep wearing until god tell you to
[20:00] huh it wasn't too awful long
[20:04] they were gone why the holy spirit
[20:06] convicted
[20:08] that's what we want we want god to
[20:09] operate on people amen and do the work
[20:12] amen because if you don't do it you can
[20:14] conform we can all be amish
[20:17] you better do it or else
[20:20] you're going to conform we don't do it
[20:22] that way we let the holy spirit deal
[20:24] amen it's a tremendous thing how many
[20:27] believes the holy spirit is to lead the
[20:28] church
[20:29] the holy spirit is to lead each and
[20:31] every one of us
[20:32] and we are all to have that voice of god
[20:35] let me say it before i don't
[20:36] but i'm going to tell you the most
[20:38] important voice that you'll ever listen
[20:40] to
[20:40] the most important voice that you'll
[20:42] ever follow and listen to
[20:44] is that still small voice in your heart
[20:47] that tells you what to do
[20:50] or what not to do and we anybody of us
[20:53] if
[20:53] that have had experience with it no when
[20:56] that voice tells you to do something and
[20:58] you don't do it
[20:59] you live to regret it and if he tells
[21:02] you not to do it you do it you
[21:03] live to regret it because that voice
[21:06] will always point you the wrong
[21:08] the right way it'll never point you the
[21:10] wrong way
[21:12] amen we lead ourselves wrong but the
[21:15] holy spirit never leads you wrong
[21:17] and i don't know about you but i believe
[21:19] every one of our hands could go up this
[21:21] morning and say
[21:21] lord i need to be able to heed to and
[21:24] hear
[21:25] that still small voice a lot better than
[21:27] what i do
[21:28] are you with me lord i need to hear that
[21:31] still small voice
[21:32] and it's a simple thought that comes
[21:34] into your heart telling you something
[21:36] showing you something but we have such
[21:38] an easy way of shrugging that off
[21:41] amen ignoring that and we
[21:44] absolutely lose our close walk with god
[21:47] when you shrug that little bitty voice
[21:50] that comes in your heart because us all
[21:52] it was when he came to evie was just one
[21:54] word misconstrued
[21:56] one more misinterpreted a little bit
[21:59] amen and sometimes we'll say well that's
[22:02] just me
[22:03] no i don't really think that that you
[22:05] know yeah that's god talking to you
[22:07] got scott trying to speak to you trying
[22:10] to tell you what to do
[22:12] amen let alone all any scriptures that
[22:14] we ever read
[22:16] any other part of the bible it's all
[22:17] god's voice
[22:19] but in your life and where you are and
[22:20] what you're doing
[22:22] you need that still small voice saying
[22:25] god
[22:26] lead me amen i look back and
[22:30] i can tell you right now that's the
[22:31] voice that i followed
[22:34] ever since i gave my life to god say god
[22:36] here i am
[22:37] i don't know what my job occupation
[22:40] gonna be
[22:40] i don't know what woman i'm gonna marry
[22:43] i don't know
[22:44] about my future i have no future lord
[22:47] here i am i'm yours do with me whatever
[22:49] you want
[22:50] i'm yours lord now i'm glad that that
[22:53] voice amen because
[22:55] listen to me amen so many times we think
[22:57] we look back and say well
[22:58] i decided to serve god but i looked back
[23:00] and i realized that it was not me
[23:02] calling god
[23:03] it was god drawing me
[23:06] god drawing you no man comes to the
[23:09] father but by me and no man can come
[23:11] unto me
[23:12] except my father draw him
[23:17] that's why i believe that if you've got
[23:18] that drawing how many y'all
[23:20] tell you what good to see the church
[23:22] this morning because there's a thirst in
[23:23] your heart
[23:24] amen to come to the house of god amen if
[23:26] you go to the races you're going to see
[23:28] a car win if you go to
[23:29] a ball game you look for somebody to win
[23:32] and you go to this side or the other but
[23:33] when you come to the house of god
[23:35] you want god to speak to your heart
[23:40] and you have to say lord here i am
[23:43] and you never know what the preacher
[23:45] might say how a detour from a thought
[23:47] that he might go or whatever but god can
[23:48] speak to your heart
[23:50] and i believe that when you're sitting
[23:52] there you should be awake and realizing
[23:54] god here i am
[23:55] what do you want to say to me amen just
[23:58] like wednesday i believe god spoke to
[24:00] our hearts
[24:01] telling us don't wait for a desperate
[24:02] situation to come to put you in
[24:04] desperation into
[24:05] into fervency with god amen be that way
[24:08] all the time say god here i am every day
[24:11] lord
[24:11] i need you more than ever lord i can't
[24:14] make it to this day without you
[24:16] huh rather than like i was just kind of
[24:19] getting relaxed and well
[24:20] everything's going good you know and you
[24:22] just kind of float along and
[24:24] no don't be like that amen stay fervent
[24:27] with god
[24:28] amen praise the lord lord bless you this
[24:31] morning
[24:32] amen
[24:36] all right can we go a little further all
[24:39] right so
[24:39] listen where are we at over in st john
[24:42] so he says that's
[24:43] that's right he that he that knoweth god
[24:47] heareth us and he that is not of god
[24:52] heareth not us
[24:56] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[25:00] and the spirit of air
[25:04] so basically the bible is telling if you
[25:06] are a son and daughter of god the one
[25:07] thing you're going to do
[25:09] is believe his word you're going to
[25:11] believe the bible
[25:13] you're going to believe everything that
[25:14] god tells you if you're a son and
[25:16] daughter of god
[25:17] if you're not you'll twist it up a
[25:20] little bit
[25:21] and that's where confusion comes in
[25:24] that's where
[25:25] that's folks let me tell you something
[25:26] that's why we have
[25:28] 900 different churches different
[25:30] denominations
[25:32] everybody believing it kind of the way
[25:33] that they want to believe it
[25:35] interpreting it the way that they want
[25:37] to interpret it
[25:39] that's why god had to send malachi
[25:40] forward to us
[25:42] to prove it to us listen to this let's
[25:44] go this is
[25:46] part three here ready we got about five
[25:48] six parts so this is part three but it's
[25:50] even
[25:51] over in uh galatians i believe it is
[25:55] i don't know if i've even got this
[25:56] marked down i don't think i do
[26:00] so we'll find it
[26:04] yeah yeah not too hard to figure out
[26:06] here galatians the first chapter
[26:09] so we see how many knows that jesus said
[26:11] if you can't hear my words
[26:13] you will die in your sins unless you
[26:14] believe that i am he
[26:17] is that right if you may fail to follow
[26:20] jesus
[26:22] he was going to miss eternal life and
[26:25] then
[26:25] let me just say this from the voice of
[26:28] god
[26:29] going in the body of jesus it was
[26:31] transferred
[26:33] over into the church body on the day of
[26:35] pentecost isn't that right
[26:38] but god never was going to be without a
[26:40] voice in the world god is not without a
[26:42] voice in the world today
[26:44] it may be kind of silent huh
[26:47] you almost have to wonder where's the
[26:49] voice of god at
[26:52] and let me just say this it comes to
[26:54] mind and i believe it's the truth
[26:55] i don't care if you're a message
[26:57] preacher doesn't mean you're necessarily
[26:59] the voice of god
[27:01] if you've compromised in some way or
[27:03] you're doing it in a
[27:04] denominational manner god ain't with you
[27:06] it ain't god speaking
[27:08] amen it has to be
[27:11] and listen to this also how many knows
[27:13] that just the halfway
[27:15] out of the will of god preacher god's
[27:17] not gonna use either
[27:20] or a christian that's halfway and out of
[27:22] the will of god
[27:23] god's not going to use that he's going
[27:25] to use somebody that's in the will of
[27:26] god
[27:27] serving god with all of their heart back
[27:30] to paul
[27:30] so paul if you know how many knows that
[27:32] paul was the voice of god
[27:34] even over peter peter had been given the
[27:37] keys and everything but
[27:38] paul was the messenger to the first
[27:40] church age
[27:41] he was the first church age messenger
[27:45] and he had the kind of authority okay he
[27:47] had the kind of authority
[27:50] that he could say in galatians 1
[27:54] in verse 6 i marvel that ye are so
[27:58] soon removed from him that called you
[28:01] into the grace of christ unto another
[28:03] gospel
[28:04] now paul had problems with people
[28:07] perverting the
[28:08] word of god they were trying to teach
[28:10] circumcision again
[28:11] and this out of the other bringing in
[28:13] teachers having itching hears
[28:15] departing from the faith and all things
[28:17] were happening
[28:18] now i understand that even some of the
[28:20] churches that paul
[28:21] started threw him out and wouldn't have
[28:24] him back anymore
[28:25] can you imagine that they got so far
[28:28] away from the gospel
[28:29] that they wouldn't even let him mean
[28:30] some of the churches he started
[28:33] that's what i understand now notice
[28:36] called you to another gospel which is
[28:38] not another but there
[28:39] be some that trouble you and would
[28:42] pervert the gospel of christ
[28:44] now he goes to saying something but
[28:46] though we
[28:48] are an angel from heaven preach any
[28:51] other gospel
[28:52] unto you than that which we have
[28:54] preached unto you
[28:56] whoa what authority
[29:04] let him be accursed if he's an angel not
[29:07] just a preacher decided
[29:08] but if he's an angel from heaven and
[29:10] come and tell you something other than
[29:12] what he has brought
[29:13] that's how accurate the bible is
[29:16] and as we said before so say i again
[29:19] verily verily basically
[29:23] truly truly let me say it again paul
[29:25] says
[29:26] if any man preach any gospel
[29:29] unto you then that ye have received let
[29:33] him
[29:33] be accursed
[29:37] whoo think about that paul heaven so
[29:39] much the voice of god
[29:41] that if anybody comes and preach
[29:43] anything else that's why
[29:44] we believe absolutely that this is the
[29:47] infallible
[29:48] word of god
[29:51] if a prophet there is no prophet that is
[29:54] above the word of god
[29:57] there is no preacher above the word of
[29:59] god there is nothing above the word of
[30:01] god
[30:03] i am told that martin luther one time
[30:05] had an angel
[30:06] to appear to him and it was actually
[30:09] jesus
[30:10] jesus appeared to martin saint martin
[30:14] and he said to him he says i am jesus
[30:16] and he had a crown on his head
[30:18] just a glowing glistening
[30:24] huh just i am jesus he said
[30:27] i'm jesus how before me
[30:32] and martin begin to wonder and look and
[30:35] think
[30:37] he realizes that he don't get crowned
[30:40] until all the same he's crowned him to
[30:43] get
[30:44] better
[30:47] the word said something something's not
[30:49] quite right here
[30:51] you're not supposed to be crowned yet
[30:53] that according to the word of god the
[30:54] saints will crown christ
[30:56] and what did he say he said get be
[30:59] behind me satan
[31:00] huh you know he realized he was the
[31:03] devil and then it disappeared
[31:05] but the devil was trying to get him to
[31:07] bow before him
[31:08] and coming to him and get him the bow
[31:11] paul says if an angel comes to you and
[31:14] tells you something different than this
[31:16] here
[31:17] let him be accursed that's how accurate
[31:20] the voice
[31:21] of god is amen
[31:24] that's why brother branham said you know
[31:26] nowadays brother branham would preach
[31:27] against
[31:28] make up he preached against women the
[31:31] but the bible says a woman that wears a
[31:33] garment pertains to man is an
[31:34] abomination in the sight of god
[31:36] and god ain't changed his mind none
[31:40] paul said the woman is not to cut her
[31:41] hair and so forth it's her glory and
[31:43] it's a shame for her to cut it
[31:45] all these other things and some people
[31:47] say well it doesn't matter
[31:48] huh jesus said unless a man is born
[31:52] again he cannot enter the kingdom of
[31:53] giving yet people are sin
[31:54] just join church just shake the
[31:56] preacher's hand and you'll be all right
[31:58] no hello
[32:01] you can't water it down you can't do
[32:03] what the devil did it's just water it
[32:05] now it's got to be the pure
[32:06] unadulterated word of god
[32:08] just what paul said amen
[32:12] women preachers how many pentecost was
[32:14] the latest move of god and pentecost
[32:16] they used to have everything right and
[32:17] now the women pentecostals when women
[32:19] are up there and
[32:20] wearing pants and makeup and everything
[32:22] else and preaching the gospel women
[32:24] when paul says that it is a shame for
[32:26] her to speak in church let her keep
[32:27] silent
[32:28] if she has a question asked our husband
[32:30] at home it's not permitted for him to
[32:32] speak
[32:33] amen getting quiet now
[32:38] but isn't that the truth what would he
[32:40] say if god speaks in this world he would
[32:42] tear us up
[32:43] amen i truly believe he'd tell us the
[32:44] truth just like the prophet of god did
[32:46] he told the truth brother branham one
[32:48] place and mom either look at one of
[32:50] those message he got so anointed until
[32:52] that voice spoke to me and says this is
[32:54] god speaking i am just using
[32:56] uh brother branham's voice this is not
[32:58] him this is me speaking
[32:59] god spoke so much until he spoke that
[33:01] way he wouldn't have to already spoke
[33:03] when he tell you your name is so and so
[33:05] you're from so and so and you have
[33:07] cancer in the name of jesus christ
[33:08] you'll be
[33:09] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[33:11] times all these things happen
[33:12] that's good enough for me the sign of
[33:15] the messiah big part about it is he's
[33:17] always pointed us
[33:18] right back to what paul said and when
[33:21] brother
[33:21] went beyond the curtain of time he seen
[33:23] millions of people there
[33:24] under the altar all happy and perfect
[33:27] perfection you couldn't even imagine
[33:28] what it was like
[33:31] and the angel told him he says these are
[33:33] your people you're gathered with your
[33:35] your people 20 twenty went to a vision
[33:38] twenty foot
[33:38] high out of the bed and so forth he's
[33:40] seen all that amen and then they says
[33:42] you know you're gonna be gathered with
[33:43] your people but before you do
[33:45] he says you're gonna have to be judged
[33:46] for what you preached
[33:48] you're gonna have to be judged for what
[33:49] you have preached and he said well will
[33:51] paul
[33:52] have to be judged or what he preached he
[33:53] says that's right paul will have to be
[33:55] praying to be judged
[33:56] but the man went praise be to god then
[33:59] everything will be all right because i
[34:00] just preached what paul preached
[34:04] i just said what paul said it's going to
[34:07] be all right
[34:08] amen no an angel comes with any other
[34:11] voice
[34:11] other than this if a voice comes to you
[34:13] contrary to this remember you got to be
[34:15] careful
[34:16] amen sheep be careful listen to only the
[34:19] voice of god
[34:21] praise the lord that's right
[34:24] now let's go to revelations a couple
[34:27] more places and then
[34:29] we'll close i still want to cover the
[34:32] voice of politics for
[34:34] just a minute and i believe we have the
[34:35] voice of the lord on that
[34:40] revelations one a little bit extensive
[34:43] reading and
[34:44] amen this is a nice cool beautiful day
[34:46] so let's just take our time
[34:48] and enjoy basking in the presence of god
[34:50] is that all right
[34:54] thank the lord thank you jesus for
[34:56] keeping everybody safe
[34:58] for helping us to not have to deal
[35:01] much at least with that coronavirus and
[35:03] so forth amen
[35:05] thank god for his goodness to us how
[35:07] many thankful to god we come here to
[35:08] thank the lord not just
[35:10] and was asking things but he god surely
[35:12] good to us
[35:13] isn't he amen verse 11 i am alpha and
[35:17] the omega i'm the first and the last and
[35:19] what thou seest write in the book and
[35:21] send it unto the seven churches
[35:23] which are in asia unto ephesus and to
[35:25] smyrna
[35:26] pergamus by tyra sardis philadelphia
[35:29] and laodicea and i turned to see the
[35:33] voice that spake with me
[35:34] and being turned i saw seven golden
[35:36] candle sticks
[35:38] and in the midst of the seven
[35:40] candlestick one like unto the son of man
[35:42] clothed with the garment bound to the
[35:44] foot
[35:44] and his dirt about the pabst with the
[35:46] golden girdle his head and his hair were
[35:49] like
[35:50] white like wool i don't guess we got
[35:52] that
[35:53] cloud picture here do we white like wool
[35:55] remember the
[35:56] hoffman said if christ formed out in
[35:58] arizona his hair was white like wool
[36:01] formed in the shape of hoffman's head of
[36:04] christ
[36:05] quite as wool and his eyes were as a
[36:08] flame of fire
[36:09] his feet likened to fine brass as if
[36:11] they burned in a fermented furnace
[36:13] and his voice as the sound of many
[36:16] waters
[36:18] i didn't pull that uh
[36:21] song up by the aunts brothers the voice
[36:23] of many waters y'all remember that song
[36:25] the ghost
[36:26] gospel preachers you know and brother
[36:29] bam said the sound of this many waters
[36:30] is the voice of his ministers that
[36:32] sounded
[36:33] through the last 2000 years thundering
[36:36] out
[36:36] judgment is that right it's thundering
[36:38] out the gospel of christ
[36:40] that there's mercy come to the fountain
[36:42] come to the fount come to the fountain
[36:44] and if you reject it there's nothing but
[36:45] condemnation isn't that right
[36:48] all of these voices going forth because
[36:49] that's truly the voice of god is
[36:51] amen go ye to all the world and preach
[36:53] the gospel he that believeth and is
[36:54] baptized
[36:55] shall be saved he that believeth not
[36:57] shall be damned amen
[36:59] that's the voice of many waters and he
[37:01] had in his right hand seven
[37:03] stars and out of his mouth when a sharp
[37:06] two-edged sword
[37:07] and his continence was like the
[37:08] sunshineness in his strength
[37:10] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[37:12] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[37:14] saying
[37:15] fear not i am the first and the last
[37:19] i am he that liveth and
[37:23] was dead
[37:26] amen how do you know that makes one god
[37:29] amen first the last was dead build i am
[37:33] alive forever
[37:34] more amen and have the keys of hell and
[37:37] of death
[37:38] write the things which i have seen and
[37:40] the things which are and the things
[37:41] which shall be hereafter
[37:43] the mystery of the seven stars which i
[37:45] saw us in my right hand
[37:47] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[37:49] seven stars
[37:50] are the angels of the seven churches
[37:54] and the seven candlesticks are
[37:57] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[38:00] amen in the last church age if you go
[38:04] with me
[38:05] to chapter 3
[38:10] now we know through a prophet of god in
[38:12] the voice of days of the voice of the
[38:14] seventh angel the bible says
[38:15] even when he shall begin the sound the
[38:17] mystery of christ should be finished as
[38:18] he has declared to his servants the
[38:20] prophets
[38:20] we know the last two thousand years from
[38:22] the time of christ we've had seven
[38:24] churches
[38:25] seven church ages seven messengers seven
[38:28] stars that god has had a voice
[38:30] and that's who god spoke through amen
[38:32] and
[38:34] each one of those messengers would have
[38:36] a certain word
[38:37] for that age no doubt that the first
[38:39] church aged paul and the different ones
[38:41] they would encourage the people to go
[38:43] right to death go into the lands and
[38:44] give you life
[38:46] sacrifice we must be willing to lay down

[48:33] end
[48:34] all those things are at the end
[48:37] that's the voice of god today we're at
[48:40] the end
[48:43] my what can we do then what is next
[48:46] we're at the end of all things
[48:50] and that's the next paragraph was i say
[48:53] in closing
[48:54] the church has got so much to live for
[48:57] amen
[48:58] one more scripture if you'll turn with
[48:59] me to genesis and then we'll close
[49:03] what does god think about the condition
[49:07] the world's in
[49:09] he thinks that the world has gotten into
[49:11] the same condition that it has gotten
[49:13] before and he's got the same word for it
[49:25] in genesis 6.
[49:31] we have reached this place again
[49:36] genesis 6 verse
[49:39] 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man
[49:43] was great in the earth
[49:45] and that every imagination of the
[49:46] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[49:48] continually
[49:50] and it repented the lord that he made
[49:52] man upon the earth and he grieved him
[49:54] at his heart amen how many knows that
[49:57] when god looks at all of this
[49:59] it's like look where man has got himself
[50:02] to
[50:04] he has completely
[50:07] gone wrong verse 7
[50:10] and the lord said i will destroy man
[50:13] whom i have created from the face of the
[50:15] earth
[50:16] both man and beast and creepy things and
[50:18] fowls of the air and it repented me
[50:20] that i have made them i sure think that
[50:24] this ought to be read
[50:26] in our house and in our congress amen
[50:29] it's been next verse verse 12
[50:33] and god looked upon the earth and behold
[50:35] it
[50:36] was corrupt
[50:40] for all flesh had corrupted his way
[50:45] upon the earth and god said unto noah
[50:48] the end
[50:49] of all flesh is come before me
[50:52] for the earth is filled with violence
[50:56] through them and behold
[50:59] i will destroy them with the earth
[51:03] amen how many believes that's god's word
[51:05] for this generation
[51:07] they have gone as corrupt as they can
[51:10] get
[51:11] as far away from the word of god as they
[51:13] can go until they don't even know
[51:15] what a man is and what a woman is
[51:18] huh completely
[51:22] endorsed homosexuality same-sex
[51:24] marriages
[51:26] as corrupt as it can get god says
[51:29] it's time to destroy the whole thing
[51:34] god's about to do the same thing again
[51:36] because man has gotten
[51:37] that he has completely corrupted himself
[51:39] and think about this
[51:41] having been said way back in 1960
[51:45] amen the end of it all
[51:49] is at hand but for the church
[51:52] we're not looking for a better life here
[51:54] we're looking for another life
[51:55] altogether

[52:30] world

[52:34] hope

[52:38] for him
[52:39] to come in the clouds of heaven to take
[52:42] us home

[52:46] rapture

[52:57] coming of the lord shall not prevent
[52:59] them which are asleep
