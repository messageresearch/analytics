========================================
[Music] oh [Music] praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god amen praise the lord tonight we greet each one every one of you in the name of the lord good to be back in the house of the lord amen on this hot day amen so god bless you tonight amen thank you musicians amen we do have following uh brother thaddeus burgess who's going to come down and minister for us so that's not this weekend but the next amen amen let's just power heads kind heavenly father lord as we once again meet in this midweek service father lord thankful once again to be able to lay aside all of our work and all the cares of life and lord and to be able to assemble ourselves in your house coming together lord bringing our licks of fire to worship you in spirit and in truth and give you honor and glory due to your name lord father we just want to thank you for all of your blessings upon us lord we can't even begin to mention them all or they even think of them all father but we just want you to know that we appreciate each and every one of them lord father we ask god that you just bless meditation of our heart father what you feel what we feel you flee upon our hearts to minister tonight may you have your way into service tonight in jesus name amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will the psalms the book of psalms i was just meditating on the lord this week and just seeing what the lord perhaps would have for tonight and this thought came on my heart and i got to thinking about how blessed we are to be christians amen just to be a christian how blessed that is i believe i just thought of it back there as saint john three or first first or second john i think it's the third chapter somewhere in there first verse it talks about behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god in other words i like that behold it said look at just think about what a blessing it is to be able to be called the son of god and he believes that's such an honor there's no greater privilege that god could privilege us with and that is to be one of his children and i got to thinking about the benefits the benefits what goes with it what goes with being a christian what goes with being a child of god what goes with being saved and i thought about this scripture here and this is a psalm a scripture brother ram as i begin to study i found that brother branham used his scripture many many times as his theme scripture amen for preaching several different kinds of messages and i could see why uh and we'll get to that in just a little bit because it talks about uh who forgives all like iniquities and heal of all life diseases and so i think it was based because of his healing services that he had so in psalms 103 let's read bless the lord o my soul i guess i didn't tell you the scripture psalms 103 all right bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget to get not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who leadeth healeth all thy diseases that's where brother branham usually stop and i'd like to read a couple more scriptures who redeemeth the life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles may god that is blessing i mean a couple statements of what he made about being a christian he says so we're just living in that day and happy to be a christian amen how many is happy to be a christian you know that's one thing i want to say and that you know uh i truly believe that being a christian i i was looking it up because different places program talked about it he did not believe that a crown never right not a christian there's an aura about a christian amen of joy and of peace amen amen and so he says happy to be a christian oh my what could i do if i believe he says i believe that i would go wild if i wasn't a christian looking at the thing i don't see how people can stand it i just don't understand how a man can walk on earth today without being a christian amen praise the lord how many is glad to be a christian amen it's the greatest privilege that you have is to be a christian amen and tonight we want to forgot to talk about forget not all of his benefits don't forget all the things that comes with being a christian amen and so i wish anybody would give me a reason some reason why not to serve christ amen give me a sensible reason amen this is the day that we all ought to be happy and ready the great homecoming time is at hand amen but is wrote on every this is the same quote is wrote on every nation every wall everywhere every democracy every kingdom everything else is falling now our weight in the balance and found when wanting amen all right he says kings have failed dictators have failed democracies failed churches have failed human beings has failed everything has failed you say churches yes sir amen so if you're the christian in the midst of all that you ought to be thankful amen praise the lord so are we going to be on the air tonight micah yeah okay so god bless each and every one watching and tuning in tonight may god be with you amen bless you and i trust that it'll be good for you too amen and that you'll get something out of it and you may have to move the camera around a little bit micah tonight because i'm gonna be moving around here a little bit so praise the lord amen we're glad for being able to be on air i know it's a little skip skip skippy but uh hopefully he'll be able to make sense of it i know it's a little dirky out there but i guess our internet is just not quite fast enough so we'll just continue to work on and see what we can do again brother bam says you know so i'm so glad that we have a shelter the name of the lord is a mighty power the righteous run into it and they're safe no matter how many bombs or how many anything else we're safe there i'm just glad for feeling like you're safe amen so the world and the center not having this shelter or this safety place it's a shaking time he says i again i believe if i was in the christian i'd go crazy of thinking of what might happen anytime he cares for you 1960 he says oh let me persuade you in christ's name you precious people here put all your hopes on him for he's the only foundation there's coming or shaking democracy shook to pieces kingdoms issues to pieces of all things but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved steadfast unmovable always abounding in the mercy of god oh i love that i'm so glad to be a christian i don't know what i do if uh i would do if i wasn't a christian i'd probably be a suicide case if i wasn't a christian against statue of a perfect man 62 oh isn't it wonderful to serve the lord i don't know what i would do if i was in the christian it's just so good to be a christian how many believes that it's just so good to be a christian i just feel like jumping up and down and screaming to the top of my voice to be a christian think of it all anchored away in christ amen i'd be glad for that tonight praise the lord how many knows that we were born come into this world with a lot of parts missing not only with a lot of missing parts that we come into this world but we come up with a lot of things that that we were all messed up i mean our feelings weren't right our mind wasn't right our thinking wasn't right our heart wasn't right our soul wasn't right our talk wasn't right our talk wasn't right there was nothing right about us when we was came into this world we needed a lot of fixing that right and we needed a lot of the parts we needed we needed the things that actually makes you what you're supposed to be and that brings fulfillment in your life and i truly believe that when you become a christian whether it's the ladies or whether it's the men all right before you were natural bruce beast the man was and before perhaps the ladies were at jez bells huh without christ but whenever the holy spirit comes and when he feels you and gives you what you have need of amen it'll make a lady out of you it'll make you what god made you to be and the same way with a man whenever god comes down and he fills that part that was empty and he gives you that missing part of the holy ghost in your heart amen it makes you not a brute beast but it makes you a gentleman how many believes that tonight amen that's just some of the benefits tonight we want to go through some of the things that we probably know that come with being a christian brother ben i'm talking about benefits of the policy you know a policyholder he was talking about a policyholder how that that policy holds benefits he says the bible said forget not all the benefits of this policy now while you've got this assurance amen blessed assurance amen i mean that's one of the benefits of being a christian is you got assurance to where before you had no insurance your future was bleak your eternal destination was horrible a nightmare nothing but judgment and hell waiting for you all right so one of the beautiful benefits of being a christian and being saved is that you've got assurance you've got to benefit too david cried and forget not all his benefits folks i'm telling you if you begin to think that man a christian life is a little hard you just remember what it would be like without christ how hard it would be without him isn't that right what life would be without christ it'll make you begin to appreciate amen all the things that come with being a christian all right all right so he says now notice he says what are they david who forgiveth all thine iniquities isn't that right and forgiveth all of thy diseases and so forth no wonder david cried forget not all of his benefits why you know after you come into the kingdom of god there's a lot of benefits brother baby says that go with it when god calls you knocks at your heart's door separates you from the things of the world amen when he calls you out he calls you into his kingdom i mean those are when you get born again you get called into a kingdom it's not america not england the kingdom of england not any other kingdom but it's the kingdom of god and then he says listen as we begin to go here now he's like a great big variety store he says you walk into a variety store down at the arcade somewhere you walk in and hear something over here look at it it's yours look over there here's something else oh i just love this big variety store don't you amen and we all get into it one way we get into this variety store into the benefits of calvary is by one spirit are we all baptized into one body amen into this variety sword now he says now lotus and this is the variety store right here and every blessing talking about the bible and every blessing and every promise in here that was given to mankind is for every person that's baptized into this variety story just write walk right up and possess yours it's yours something up here really high perhaps something that i have to climb high to get maybe it's out of my reach he says but i get a ladder to get it i want to see what it's all about don't you amen so brother ram goes to talking about having a variety story it's like a great big store it's got these shelves upon shelves upon shelves it has got some things that are perhaps just a little too hard for you to reach all right so what we're going to do tonight one of y'all some of y'all was wondering what i was carrying around here it's a box we're going to do a little bit of a skit be we all want to do a skit tonight all right we're going to do a little skit all right of the variety store now watch out bull in the china cabinet here all right okay can somebody tell me in this variety store trying to get up high enough to get this stuff what this ladder represents somebody tell me what does this represent raise your hand well it is but it's not what i'm looking for all right how many know sometimes it takes faith huh you gotta climb with faith right it takes faith you gotta climb in faith lord help me climb with faith that's right so you gotta climb in faith to try to get this now so what we got here i was gonna have to do a little bit something more but but says it's up there perhaps just a little out of your reach and at first i was gonna get this little bitty short ladder and bring it now it was a new one but i said man i could just reach that that really does defeats the purpose of being able to reach it you know he's most i can but maybe somebody could but up here it is all right now so he says you know you don't know for sure so let's look at god's variety story tonight shall we amen all right lord i'm getting on my knees and i'm praying now this ladder here it has been bent and shook around thought about having somebody come up here and hold this thing who wants to come hold this aaron you gonna come hold it for me all right so this ladder's a little weak right i mean it's been bent over and running over by truck all right now what does what does he represent on this weak ladder yeah i'm trying to get up here i don't really trust this ladder i need a little help right huh no it represents him you know sometimes it helps to have somebody pray for you right pray with me brother i need faith to reach up there you know maybe you need your hands laid on and that right and you could come up to the pastor to have it late but brother man said if you had perfect faith you wouldn't have to come up but it's not quite perfect you need a little help so you need a little prayer so he represents me needing little prayers all right so you're gonna pray for me right so i don't fall pray for me i don't fall you know not just anybody can come up here you know and guess what it takes a little climbing right i might have to pray a little bit more you may have to pray a little harder to get your blessing amen i thought about maybe preaching on that message called why why is the daughter of my people not healed remember a long time ago i preached that i i kind of do a rotation preaching huh brother baby said he came to give us the sermon to take care of our problems is that right so why do we still have them but anyway let's not go there but anyway so we got to have faith to come up here come up high enough now right and look wow let's see what we got here this whole bunch of stuff boxes in here here's another here's one wow check this out oh my it says the gift of god here's the gift of god what's the gift of god the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life all right so how many know that whenever you first amen first thing you go by faith will fade by faith right thank you for now that'll be good we're saved by grace through faith so we climb that lad amen and the first thing that comes in the box is an eternal life that should make us all run around this building if i truly appear i think i don't know brother brad when we get over there i wonder if we won't say man when he got to talk about each other this is eternal life we're gonna say this is eternal life but the man says there's no vocabulary right there's not right words to express to say how beautiful it really is beyond sublime beyond perfection that's what it's going to be it's when god gives you an eye eternal life that's the gift of god all right so he gives us the gift of eternal life praise be to god hallelujah all right look what's in there what did david say david says you know he forgives all of our trans iniquities and even brother brahm says those iniquities is things that you know that you shouldn't do and you do them anyway god forgives you for them how many would not be here uh if god wouldn't forgive you for the stuff that you do that you know you shouldn't come on you're pretty holy you're pretty righteous if you don't do things that you know you want to do and you never have should i say am i right that's pretty good but anyway oh no sometimes we do things we just you know we don't but by god's grace he forgives us of our iniquities because if he wouldn't we'd all be lost but he forgives us so that's the first thing great things and god's great thing is that you know we were born and sin shaped neck we've been coming at his word speaking lies and he forgives us of all of that one of the greatest things the greatest treasures is the forgiveness of almighty god and let's not just say when we got born again or whatever but our daily mistakes the mistakes you made today you can get forgiveness for i truly believe it [Music] oh sometimes we don't want to forgive ourselves we don't think god will forgive us but you would be amazed at how forgiving god is if you're willing to repent is that the truth every wrong thought that you have huh just the wrong thought it may not be something big but a wrong thought is sin that right praise the lord david said that's one of the benefits amen is forgiveness and heal of all thy diseases psalms 103 hallelujah how many of those we'd be laying in bed somewhere with the coronavirus burning up we could be you know right and then we'd have to put you out in that graveyard out there because you died from it that's what could happen is that right or any other disease cancer all these diseases the bible says and that's why brother bannon on those two he says you know forgives you all your sins and heals all your disease all healing comes from god and brother even goes to talking about in your body that's healing in your body how many beliefs you have healing in your body and that is god in there that gave that to you so that you could feel good but he feels good oh yeah how many strong how many feeling healthy praise be to god heals all your diseases thank god praise the lord all right so we got all of that now let's go to another one hey check push this out on the outside of the box he said it's got a clue here right it says go to romans uh there's something else we got in here turn the romans for me will ya go let's go to romans 14 romans 14. got to be good all right in romans 14 it says now the kingdom of god it talks about the kingdom of god in verse 17. all right 14-17 he talks about what the kingdom of god is all about here again we're looking at the kingdom of god amen it's a great variety story says listen the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost hallelujah honey believes that's what it's all about it's not about your food and your drink but it's by it's about being right with your maker number one he says it's about righteousness i mean you can't have righteousness outside of forgiveness without grace amen we have access unto god we're justified amen paul said by faith we are justified in that of entrance of access into disgrace amen and we have become what the very righteousness of god how many believes that if you are truly forgiven of all your sins you are as righteous as god is righteous that's pretty righteous that's real righteous because how many knows that's got to be that's got to be the way you are it's got to be his righteousness in you i hope i'm not making the wrong statement here but i don't believe i am but you can feel the way god feels let the peace of god rule and reign in your heart the peace that passes understanding you and i am in righteousness peace and joy so it's the next one of course we know that people are completely dissatisfied people are in war in a battle with their self isn't that right they don't have any people don't have peace there is no peace for the wicked amen totally discontent totally unhappy brother says it is amazing how i'm how many unhappy discontent unsatisfied people there is in the world it's amazing but oh i want to be able to sing this wednesday night oh i'm satisfied huh but just the cottage little bit of silver and a little gold amen i mean i was a christian amen is that that's the benefit i was you know one thing that brought me to it even as i was just going through monday and tuesday i think lord it's just so good to be a christian it's just so good to have peace in my heart it is just so good to have the joy of the lord in my heart because you know how many people would love to have a little joy people don't got no joy anymore people are not happy and people won't be happy until the joy of the lord comes into your hearts that's what the kingdom of god is all about it's about righteousness it's about peace and it's about joy come on people think about it climb that ladder yeah you think it's a little boy but i'll tell you what i haven't gotten happy enough to shout in my garage or in my own my lawn mower or driving down the road or i just haven't got that happiness people lose their joy even as christians maybe you've lost your jaw and you think you'll never get it back i don't know how to get my joy back i don't know how i'm gonna get it start climbing the ladder a little bit start climbing start praying it's there huh the devil took it from you will take it back said it's fine huh that's right go climb a little higher get up there take a little more faith climb that ladder of faith like david said he knew what it was like to have a frown on his face they would do what it's all like to get depressed but what they say lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation buddy i'll tell you what we talk about david we talk about dancing before the ark and stripping his clothes off and just having him a dance and jubilee in front of only ezreal but we don't talk about him sitting in his closet down in his basement in the darkest part of his basement ashamed to show his face because what he did with bathsheba huh he was in despair he knew what it was like to be in the depth of hell huh yes he died he didn't know what it was like to be there back down there because he would wrote about he says though i make my bed in hell thou art there you're still going to be with me you're going to help me out isn't that right that's why he could say that he says he delivereth your soul amen i don't pull the tab out but he talks about he saves you he saves your very life and he gives you joy and he gives you satisfaction he gives you food that you can be satisfied with amen praise the lord that's right so we got that's right eternal life amen eternal life righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost praise the lord so let's look again we're talking about joy amen the world doesn't have any joy well what else is in here what else do we got let's look here wow what's in this box what's in here what's this one called oh oh wow this box says everything everything everything i want that yeah i want everything how about you you want everything what's in everything box i got everything here that's right let's look at this now oh my look inside here in that box there's a checkbook ah there's a checkbook and inside whose name you reckon down there thomas byler uh if that's on there it's gonna be limited i'm sure it probably is with you too maybe not quite as but i'm sure it's limited but with the lord jesus christ yeah ominous he'll bankrupt heaven and it's pretty rich before he'll let one of his checks bounce all right now let's go find out saint john 13-14 let's find out here actually yeah john 13-14 very familiar scripture like i said some of these are going to be familiar with us but it says in john 13 and 14 amen our checkbook it comes from this scripture how many knows that no matter what you preach it's got to be scripturally based no matter what brother branham said it has to be scriptural all right so it says verse 12 he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do i will make it good huh so in this box we got a checkbook with jesus name sign on it and guess what you whatever you have need of you can go and get what did the bible say one place i hope i couldn't even halfway quote it right but whatsoever things you desire when you pray if you believe you will i can have what you have asked know what the bible says that's right if you'll believe it amen and with you nothing shall be impossible really is that really so you know all i can tell you is i'm gonna have to climb that ladder because that's kind of hard to believe sometimes for any of us we hear it with our ear yeah that's what the preacher says but do you really apply it to your life do you truly believe that whatever you ask god honored i know it puts doubt in there don't but it shouldn't let me tell you what i believe brother bam says as we go remember it's not a surprise to him and he's going to supply his children's as we go on when you have need of something i believe it'll be there amen praise the lord all right let's go to another one over here there's another one that gives us another place to get some more out of this box is in uh first corinthians 3 21. first corinthians 3. 21 all right now notice he says therefore let no man glory in men all for all things are yours notice it was the everything box right everything box all right for all things are yours whether paul or apollos or sivas or the world y'all stay seated will you if you possibly can the whole world's yours my friend that's god's bible that's god's that's god's promise right there or the world how many believes this world is yours [Music] let me can i give you another scripture the meek shall inherit the earth all right it don't get any better than that the meek shall inherit the earth praise be to god or life how many likes to be alive oh my let me just spit a little something in there sinning every time a person sins and gets away from god whether he's uh just coming out of teenage or going into teenage and every time they sin amen it shrinks their inner man up all right and they keep seeing them they keep getting away from god and you get more drier and better you get deader on the inside until you look like a cow that's been dead for two months laying out there in the field you're covered over with nothing but skin and bones dead as dead can be and that's what most people in the world look like sin would zap the life right out of you amen but what is ours life is ours our death amen do y'all remember how brother bannon explained how that we own death huh he said don't fear death death is nothing but a horse and buggy he said that it obeys us it serves us it's my servant now we own it amen because when jesus rose remember he had the keys of hell and of death and of the grave he had the keys of olive he owns he has the power over all of them and he gave those keys back to the church so death belongs to us also even death is our vehicle our means of getting from here to there amen it's our buggy to heaven not hell but to heaven that's what he explained that even death belongs to us are things present or things to come all right paul you're pouring it on a little heavier but he knew what he's talking about amen all are yours i know we got an amen on that right that's right all things everything is yours and ye are christ's and christ is god's praise be to the lord all right everything this is also called the inheritance box you inherit everything that right let's look at that one yeah let's look at one more scripture out of this box in uh romans 8 16 and 17. romans 8 16 and 17. how many believes that in christ we become an heir in other words we inherit something amen now we know that the whole world the whole earth belongs to christ i mean he paid for it with his own blood on calgary but you and i become what he calls joint heirs we're partners how many believe we're partnering with christ we're joint heirs according to romans 8 16 and 17. romans 8 16 and 17. all right now notice he says here verse 14 let's go back up a little bit for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god praise the lord how many believes only those that have the holy ghost are truly inheritance only those who have the holy ghost have a right to that checkbook for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if you're a child then you're an heir an heir of god a joint heir with christ hallelujah if he resurrected i'll get the resurrect too many believes that we're joint heirs with christ and if so be that we suffer with him we shall also be glorified together praise be to god amen all right now we have one more final box that we got tonight how many knows that you could actually have shelves upon shelves of boxes you could go on about this for a long ways a very long time i don't know that will get take time i might just mention a little bit but one of the other scriptures that i really like amen that's a beautiful beautiful box it may be kind of up in the shop it's still a beautiful box it's romans 8 2 8 28 i believe it is whom he has called them he justified whom he justified them he is also glorified how many believes you got a box with a glorified body in it that's right a promise of a glorified body all right now let's go to the last box for the evening all right this one here let me see here big box but it's all right it's not the size of the box but it's what's in it all right well i don't know about y'all but this was christmas somebody be happy the big box right all right it's a big box i like big boxes all right oh my this one here is called the box of the bird box it's got a bird says bird the bird box and no worry no worry box huh yeah you don't have to worry that's right no worry praise be to god all right matthew 6 says matthew 6 and 30. let's go to matthew 6 and 30. how many believe that our heavenly father amen oh my we have our heavenly father does what he watches out for you and he watches out for me the caretaker box amen the one that takes care of us start with 26. listen behold the birds right behold the bird box behold the fowls of the air verse 26 of chapter six jesus this box tells us hey the secret is to go look at the bird go watch a bird go watch a sparrow huh we're bird watchers tonight bird watchers try to take a lesson from the bird they so not neither do they reap nor do they gather into barns huh yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they somebody give me a hallelujah isn't that the truth yeah we're a whole lot more than a sparrow sometimes we act like now god isn't even looking at us how many believes that jesus is always looking down on you he watches you he's got his eye on you he cares about every detail about you amen so notice let's read on are you not much more than they which of you by taking thought can add one bit to his statue all right i'm gonna tell you something funny about myself tonight uh when i was younger i wanted to be big i wanted to be like john michael or john laster right there i want to be tall you know so i do stretches stretch stretch this time mommy didn't realize you can't make yourself bigger huh is that right that's right you thought you think you can add one inch to it no that's all up to god he knew exactly the height he would be huh and even the bible says who who by taking thought can add one cupid to his stature who can be a little bigger amen now notice so he says and why take ye thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not and neither do they spin and yet i said to you that solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these now i don't know but i'm here to tell you solomon was arrayed pretty nice but he says you know these are raid by almighty god wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which the days and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you oh ye of little faith this box jesus says everybody huh right now we're having racial wars what they call i guess for what equality huh do you want more stuff they want stuff like you got stuff huh equality think about it they're worried about their natural sustenance huh but that's not what jesus said he said don't be thinking about all that what you're gonna wear or what you're gonna eat huh oh ye of little faith that's the truth we have a world that has very little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after these things to all the gentiles seek that's exactly what the whole world seeks after it's just food what did paul say the kingdom of god is not food and ramen food and raiment that's not what it's all about but it's about righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost the whole world needs a whole lot of that don't it quit worrying about your food and you drink and everything else and think about that your heavenly father i like that knoweth that ye have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you don't worry god will take care of you don't worry brother bam says look at the little robin he raises up of a morning the first thing what did he do he throws his little face up towards heavens and goes to sing in to the top of his voice how many love springtime when the birds come back and they're out there just singing away singing away and i'll tell you what we don't even talk to our wife until after first cup of coffee except for honey have you got my coffee ready huh now my wife don't make my coffee i make my own why because she then made hers an hour earlier i like to sleep feel if i possibly can you know i come down and i just got hot water there and said instant stuff just pour it in she would she wouldn't a heartbeat if i asked her to she's a wonderful woman not to put her down that by no means but listen so listen so he says in the morning throw his little face up towards him go to singing and you've never seen them with high blood pressure nope i've never seen one out there putting a thing around one's leg and saying no no no let me see what you got here ah you better go to the hospital hey have y'all ever seen them hospitals up in that tree how do they make it no you didn't go no they got the highest pedals why because they don't have heart failure amen why because they're happy because why they're heavenly father oh y'all are doing good now we got smiles going on that's the way a christian supposed to be have a smile on face i believe it i believe everyone ought to have a smile on our face because of the goodness of god amen i thought when i got this from this revelation of this message i got to thinking man well to be ought to be a whole lot happier than what i am but when i go to thinking about his benefits and how good he is lord help me not to forget your benefits help me not to remember to not to forget how good you really are and how much you really care and how good you have been to me the problem with this a lot of times is we think that we ought to have it better than we do instead of appreciating and thanking god for how good we have it around it hey man brother that's the truth we always thinking about how much more we should have and how much better we ought to have it and we're down and i gotta have it better no quit thinking that way start praising god i'm happy with all my god i'm thankful with what i got amen be content with such things as you have the bible said amen so you're thankful tonight to serve a god that takes care of you amen i threw an extra one in there just for closing that is we have a promise in another box one of these days of going in how many believes that we have a promise he says i would not have new ignorant brethren concerning them which are already gone huh i mean we have a box that promises resurrection for those of our loved ones who have already gone but she's sorrow not don't be as sad as those who don't have any hope and that right even those others which have no hope but if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep hallelujah he believes that's you how many sees your name in there for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that those that evening like tabernacle which still are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep let's read it right for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god amen that's the trump i'm excited about amen the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore excite each other with these words comfort each other with these words god bless you let's stand musicians if you'll come with our heads about eyes closed how many of their hearts would say i want to be like that i want to be more thankful for what i have instead of being down or sad on discontent because i think ought to have more and i just want to begin to remember benefits of being a christian god bless you god bless you god bless you lord jesus help us each one to be like a rob and father lord when we begin to think about your benefits we are become like david did oh bless my soul oh bless the lord o my soul bless the lord and all that's within me bless his holy name when we begin to think about the benefits of being a christian lord how we have security our shelter how we don't have to worry about the bombs the tribulation period how we've been forgiven lord jesus of our sins justified sanctified and filled with your spirit how lord you've given us everything father you own everything but we're joined heirs with you and we have a promise that everything belongs us to anyhow and lord we ask god tonight that you draw us closer to you father and help us to be more joyous and have more joy in our hearts and in our lives after tonight lord i pray if there's any god that is living below their privileges of the joy that they have a right to have i pray god that you will grant them tonight lord jesus a greater joy father a smile on their face a sweetness of their demeanor lord jesus a gentleness and a love that comes flowing from them lord as they work from day to day and as we focus and keep our eyes on your coming lord we ask god in
