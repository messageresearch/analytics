you got your Bible Hebrews chapter 4:14 let's jump right into the word of the Lord everybody happy amen thank you Lord Jesus for the truth of his word can you say Amen to that how great he is to us the Lord helping us this morning I want to speak to you upon the bride's voice the bride's voice and um it was a blessing to hear Brother Tom say that he' been speaking in this direction because you know that's kind of the direction I'm going to be heading just a little bit but um I am connected to y'all and I do stay connected but you know if I know that I'm going to be coming and preaching anywhere I try not to listen to any sermons for months ahead and uh that way I can be led by the Lord and uh you know and not be U particularly influenced not necessarily negative but just influenced in general and uh so when I was sitting in the office and I heard him talking about the confession and things like that I thought thank you Jesus you always know how to lead a person so we're going to go to Hebrews 4 ver14 and then um we're going to jump over to revelation 22 but let's let's start here the book of Hebrews seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace now I I don't know about you but that's going to be a challenging thing for me to do if if I don't have a revelation of who I am where I'm standing or why I'm even standing there in the first place could you imagine coming up in the face of a holy God looking him eyeball to eyeball and then making some kind of a bold statement or bold challenge to a god like that you'd have to know a whole lot more about where you're standing to be able to do such a thing and then he said that we stand there looking to do what obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need praise the Lord now let's uh let's go to revelation 22 I want to look at just a portion of verse 17 and then let's pray and ask the Lord to help us how good it is to be in the house of God today telling you to be a Christian is the Most Blessed thing a person could want I certainly love how I feel when I get to worship Him and talk to him a little while read his word it does everything for me all right revelation 22 verse1 17 and the spirit and the bride say come I want you to repeat that with me and the spirit and the bride say come let's pray over the word while your heads are bowed this morning if You' just like to be remembered in prayer some special need in your heart that you'd like from the word would you just lift your hand up to the Lord Jesus amen my hands up too Heavenly Father what a privilege it is Lord to come into your house today we count this not only a a grand privilege Lord but we considered also a sense of Duty to be here in this place Lord is part of our position our adoption not just wandering aimlessly with The Mark of Cain on us as a vagabond but having a post having a home having a place a rank we thank you Lord for being able to come and be able to offer our our our gifts and our abilities and things that you've placed in us to contribute to the worship to corporate worship and to bring us into the atmosphere that we could hear from you and I pray that you'll not only use each one of these gifts that are gathered here today but Lord I ask that you would anoint this little deposit of yourself and me that you had just allow it to work in the proper manner to get me out of the way that I could be a voice to speak to them what you would desire what you would be thinking and what you would have in your great heart and I pray this morning that not only will you bless Lord our little contributions as brother Bram called it our little licks of fire but Lord Jesus anoint us to receive from your engrafted word those things which we have need of to get closer to you May the Holy Spirit I pray bless every uplifted hand Lord May the Holy Spirit go down through this congregation today and may you grant great favor grace and mercy to all of us as we ask for these things Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and the Saints said amen and amen you can be seated may the Lord bless you really good amen it's a a grand privilege to read the Bible isn't it love the word of God and certainly love this book of Hebrews it's um been something that we've been studying at the uh home Church we've been doing kind of a a study with the entire uh assembly and uh just on Wednesday nights we've uh had canceled the Wednesday nights for a period of time during the uh uh the fall and uh we're getting ready to resume our Wednesdays coming up here in just a little bit but as a supplement we've been working on uh Wednesdays with pastor and and uh the Hebrew series and just kind of at home we're all studying and going around around this book and I found it profound that uh you know it was profound to me that when I got to looking at this particular book I had always heard the challenge made out of Hebrews 1 that you know that it was proof God and Sury times divers manners spake unto the fathers by the prophet uh prophets but in the last days has spoke to us by his son they used that many times as proof critics do uh they're not being any profit whatsoever and so as I begin to kind of study into this book it it it it dawned on me the other day well my goodness this was a prophet writing about that particular event so if you didn't believe in prophets he would have had to denounce himself at the beginning of the writing and so looking at this particular chapter we're in do you get a little bit of a background on why we're here and why we're in this particular place Paul according to the historians and different biblical theologians and Scholars alike they all agree upon one thing that Paul was either dealing with one of two classes of people or perhaps two classes that it was either Jews that had backslidden from Judaism and uh he was trying to win them into uh back into Judaism and then to bring them up into Christianity or it was Jews that were already presently devout and Pious and things like that and he was trying to bring them up into Christianity and then another fellow said that possibly this was people that had already become Christians so-called at one point and had back Sliding Away and Paul was trying to drag him back in by hook or by Crook in every way he possibly could amen because when you read this book of Hebrews he wasn't nice this was not a nice book for those that didn't believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah he just starts hammering them right off the bat and all of their traditions and their pots and their pans and their keeping of feast days was just nonsense in the eyes of God this was a pretty tough book when Paul begin to lay it down and then of course as he breaks into each of the chapters he starts out showing us that God had in the past spoke to us by prophets but in the last days was speaking to us by his son and as he breaks into that a little bit he begins to show us how that Not only was the Holy Spirit basically the mouthpiece for the age and the mouthpiece for the next 2,000 years or ever how long this age will go Not only was Jesus speaking directly to to us but then he breaks into it a little bit later how that all of the ministry the uh saints of God the body of Christ and what more are becoming not only God's hands and feet and eyes and whatever more but also they are becoming God's voice to the people in the outside world so it wasn't that God was just speaking through Jesus Christ just independently just the man Jesus himself but Paul was trying to show them that The God Who was above them all those years that they worshiped according to the Tabernacle in the wilderness and according to the temple as it was erected and the Ark of the Covenant being set there with those cherubims and the light of God hanging in between there amen that God above them became god with them in the form of Jesus Emmanuel but then he had to take them on to the stage that now it's not just God above us God with us but now through the baptism of the Holy Ghost that same Jesus Jesus Christ was now living in every member of the body of Jesus Christ now you imagine what kind of a rude awakening that was to a bunch of Jews that had never really probably ever seen much spiritual in their entire lives they had done routines they had obeyed the prophet's quotes they had went to church paid their tithes they had dressed like they were supposed to and done all of the appropriate behaviors that was expected of them and yet nothing really spiritual had happened in many of their hearts we know that's right because God had told him right up to the very end your feast days and all that you're doing are becoming nothing but a stink in my nostrils you know I wonder friends and I don't say this in a critical manner but I wonder how quickly we're arriving at that same spot around the ranks of this message that we have learned how to do and to tow the line and to behave according to the rule book that we would think of as being the message rule book of how we're supposed to live and how we're supposed to be taught and how we're supposed to act and beh but I wonder is it become is it just a routine to us that when we worship God we always worship God in a certain mode in a certain way of doing things you know I tell people sometimes if you find yourself getting in a rut and you know coming to church and you're always doing the same thing if you always raise up your left hand just pick a KN and raise up your right one instead if you're somebody hollering amen amen amen holler hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just do something to keep it broke up Amen to keep from getting into that religious rut you know what I'm saying understand that routine of things where we do this all the same way this is my Pew this is my time that's my parking spot on and on and on you see God does not want us living our life amen as a group of people that have practiced routines and ceremonies and rituals down to where we know the very minutest of the law and know everything that brother Bram said but God wants us to be a living voice to all of us around amen the cner the saint ever who they are to be a voice living and exercised before the world Amen I find that if we don't realize the power of our voice I I fear and I know that God Amen is not going to allowed to be this way but you know as a leader you look around sometimes and you wonder if we go another 30 years what's this message going to look like the people have slipped so far away from Holiness in general and the righteous things of God Amen and they just keep slipping further and further into denominational type of ways and doing things in a denominational mindset you say they don't do it around the message sure they do how many people do you know that say if you believe brother R's a prophet you got it that ain't nothing but a Baptist that slipped in the back door how many people do you know that say well if you go Shout at the altar God will do something great if you'll just shout and rejoice and have an experience that's the same thing as a Pentecostal that slipped in the back door well Hallelujah all these Traditions will slip right underneath the seam amen get right into the door and before we know it we'll be infiltrated with one denominational idea after another don't think it's strange that the devil doesn't want that brother B already told us in the church Shades book that his great desire was to get into the church to luk make it to defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless and the greatest way he can do that is to try to get you to believe a certain way as contrary to the word hold on to that idea or chase that idea without taking that thing back to the Bible to make sure it's absolutely the truth or not people can sit right in church and have an idea completely contrary to the word and become a denomination under themselves and the Holy Ghost stops they can't he can't move he can't he can't act he can't do anything for them except for when they're repenting and getting their themselves straight with God Amen and people have fallen into this same idea that Paul was scolding them for in the book of Hebrews the washing of pots and pans keeping of certain days and and and and and certain moons and you know you watch people they get absolutely completely Bonkers if the moon turns red I know that there are signs in the heaven above but brother those things areen what we're looking for well every sign that we've ever needed to see has already been shown to this generation y'all getting quiet on me but that just eggs me on that much more you say oh you ought not be hard on them things why not people are slipping into spiritual Comas they wouldn't know spiritual things if it slapped them on the back of the head half of them they don't pray they don't study they don't read their Bible but they sure know what's expected of them when they come through those back doors they know what pudus it and they know how to behave in church they've got great church manners but how do we ever expect to become a voice until we lay aside tradition and start letting the Lord speak to us and through us because the message is not an organization it's an experience that we have with the man Jesus Christ himself and that experience ought to carry us into an entirely different dimension of thinking than the rest of the world woo come on the word's Amen in case you forgot right now watch now he says then we have a high priest passed into the heavens now now you can understand how almost Blasphemous this was to many Jews sitting there that knew the pedigree of Aaron and the bloodline of those priests they were so sacred and the the the bloodline was so protected they knew the scripture whenever those boys got into the into the uh door of the Tabernacle and committed adultery and how that God had smoted him and how that when when when Uzziah went in there with the sensor and got out of his position God had so protected that place of worship so they all knew the sacredness of it and now Paul was telling us that the greater Temple the greater the greater Sanctuary was being occupied by another high priest they didn't know his bloodline they didn't know his pedigree they didn't know nothing about this man last they heard about him he was just some kind of an adulterous fair with a ro Roman soldier that they tried to cover up something by making it spiritual and that Jesus was nothing but illegitimate born as a matter of fact they killed that man in our terms today they' have put him in the electric chair of the gas chamber capital punishment is how Jesus died imagine how the rest of the world looked at his death like that could you imagine going up to the the the prison house and watching them throw the switch on a guy and electrocute him to death and then three or 4 days later start running around telling everybody you seen him alive again they were absolutely insane to the world but you see that's the way God's always done things he's always hid himself in the ridiculous and the odd and the strange and he's relied upon faith in the hearts of people to see him for who he was didn't Jesus tell us the world won't see me again but you'll see me Glory and here Paul is positioning this man as a high priest of what your voice The Voice you use has a lot more power in it than what you even give it credit for yeah that's true for example they tell us that simply through what the world calls today positive affirmations these are just statements you say over and over and over again uh you know I am smart I am this I am that just positive things they've even proved that you can change your brain physiologically literally change your brain by the way that you speak things over and over and over again I always wonder how people were so easily negative it's because they practice it they practice being negative and their brain their body their C they've just done it so much it's like an Olympic Athlete trying to run down the mile run a mile he just boom he's gone some people move to the negative side because that's all they've ever put in here and in here right and boy we living in a day where it's hard to be positive it's okay you could say man you ain't going to scare me everywhere you look be at the news be it some media social media some kind of a thing all of that is negative I'm sure hoping this next four years gets a little brighter than it has been CU I mean brother everywhere you look some disaster is being spoke of some disease that's been broke on the people that they can't figure out the answer to when's the last time any of these newscasters CBN and uh CBS excuse me and MSNBC and fox and these guys ever got up and said now there's a case of bird flu out there but we just want to remind the American public that Jesus Is A Healer I never heard fouchy say that in all of his brains so smart he's absolutely an imbecile hello cuz real WIS wise people and people with wisdom know that all that the devil can do is put a sickness on you but God's the one that has taken it away by his stripes I am already healed glory and I don't have to wait on healing neither it's already here how am I going to understand the power of my voice if everything around me every voice around me is inputting into me constant negativity you see this is the reason why the Bible encourages Christians I don't want to use the word demands but really that's almost as strong as it needs to be it demands of us brother Jo just to completely separate from the world altoe you realize that doesn't mean just quit going to the barrooms and and things like that but separating from the world also means cutting off those voices that confuse your faith that's right how many of these things do we allow oursel to listen to be it radio programs and podcast and on and on and on that by the time we get done with it it is it is placed all kinds of interference into us just simply believing God for what we have to believe many many things out there will discourage your faith from believing that what the Bible says is true you take the society we live in you if there's never been a group that I am proud of but also feel sorry for it's our sisters having to live in a world where everybody around you's got cut hair and make up on britches and shorts and all those kind of things like that and then you come to one of these churches like this and they tell you women to dress different and it's almost like there's this disconnect between how that makes you feel when you leave these doors than being here it's almost like ah you just do it you're a sister just but do you understand Brothers do we will'll never understand the extent of the suffering and the torment and the torture that our sisters go through living in a society full of women that completely disobey the word of God every day of their life [Music] amen you say well I'm proud to be a woman in a Christian sure but brother Ram said that long hair on your head was also Christ's Crown of Thorns again it goes to prove the torture that comes the torment that comes from having to live in a world that to be so odd and so strange and you know how it is when these things get released out to the world and some years ago whenever the uh the John Collins thing and the Tabernacle started up with the believe the sign group and all that they got those little exerpts of brother brandham down in Louisville and he was saying about how women are dog meat for the way they dress and things and how some of them women when they flash them newscasters on there you could tell they were visibly offended not knowing why would any human being speak like that to a woman the challenge that lays before you is the same exact challenge that laid before these Hebrews when Paul starts writing these things in here are we willing to lay aside the trends of the entire world to follow Christ and to follow what's true or we going to get swept up in all of the other voices in the age that pull us in a certain direction really brother and sister it's up to us and you know preachers experience the same kind of pressure we hear the people under this and the people under that and if we're not careful breth and I think you we're not careful we'll start bending toward those things and easing toward an easier style of preaching and we'll get nicer and nicer and nicer until we'll quit preaching against sin all together then you know what happens that people get offended if you sniff your nose or you clear your throat while you're preaching tell me when we got so soft that we can't take good oldfashioned brass knuckles hard preaching why can't we we're the bride aren't we we're children of Truth aren't we shouldn't we be able to take the word as hard as it gets yes we should and yes we can cuz I want to hear what's right I want my soul to be right with God I want to know how to make the Rapture I don't want no man sh coed for me tell me the truth amen may not be as popular as the other guys are but I guarantee the man that's going to tell you the truth he'll get you in the right places thank God for brothers that are willing to do it to tell us it's right so here we see Paul establishing Jesus as a high priest I want you to notice now I love how he says this for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmity but in all points was tempted like we are yet without sin and then he says the very next line look at that verse 16 let us therefore come boldly good Lord that tells me that somewhere between that verse and that verse I must have got a revelation somewhere that not only am I forgiven and clean and I stand justified in his presence but that I have a right to come to him and speak boldly to him it it speaks to the relationship that the comer has with the one he's coming to amen How could a man walk up when the when the Great White Throne of judgment is set up the entire Heaven the Earth and everything flees from the face of him that sits on the throne and yet here Paul tells us when you come to that same Throne come boldly how could you have that much understanding and faith and confidence in your voice must be a revelation strike somewhere praise the Lord now watch this now in the greatest battle ever fought when brother talking about things like positive affirmations and what we would call today positive affirmation he said now remember it's not Christian Science mind over matter the mind accepts the life which is the word of God and that brings the life just your thought doesn't do it so being positive is great but it only works on certain Realms of you it will help you have a better day it'll help you have more confidence in yourself perhaps maybe give you more courage about certain jobs you got to do but this will not Usher you forward into a position of adoption unless you mix that voice with something that's got power in it woo I like to feel what I feel what I'm feeling what I'm feeling the word has the ability to take your very positive thought and drive it all the way down to hit the mark glory to God that High Mark that Paul talked about of the high calling in Jesus Christ imagine what that must be like as a human being to just say certain things hoping it might all be all right but then the minute you take your voice and mix it with the word now it's an entirely different thing altogether no wonder the devil hates the man or the woman or the family or the church or the preacher or the whoever that knows how to take that word upon their lips and speak it just like God does such a person that gets that right they're undefeatable you couldn't conquer such a man or woman if you tried Glory cuz to beat them you'd have to beat the word and brother you can't beat the word woo thank you Lord notice he said but the word brought into the channel of your thought so when the spirit and the bride say say voice say come notice it's not just the bride speaking but the spirit and the bride are both speaking so somewhere again the relationship between bridegroom and bride the there must have been a blending together somewhere somewhere there must have been a Unity Hallelujah their voice has become his voice his voice has become theirs how could they speak come if there was nothing in their voice of authority on now you think back to the days of the Ark when God was going to call every two creature into the ark every two of its kind male and a female the spirit of the Lord didn't even have to come out there with an angel a big bullhorn and speak it out but they had a sensitivity to know when their creator was calling them to just follow along until they got into the ark they say that's about like a dove is a dove no matter where you might release it like a an old pigeon or something like that you take it and release it it could go all Halfway Around the World it will always have a sense of home and know where home's at all creation recognizes the voice of its creator which is the reason why we still listen at this fell that died in 1965 and listened to the messages preached on those recordings cuz we're not really listening for William brandham we can identify with the voice of our creator speaking through the lips of that Prophet that's why we still come to church and hear preachers preach even though it might be some little country Corn bed preacher doesn't matter we're not Liv listen for the hit H and pack and fetch and y'all and tote we're listening for the voice of God speaking now let's turn to Revelation chapter 10 I want to look at verse 7 now this is familiar to us but I want you to read along with me I'm going to try to break some things down make this pler and that the Lord will help me I'm going to try if I can to get into this about the confession and things before we quit thank you Lord Jesus you love the Lord yeah you hanging in there with me that's good that's good good good all right we're just going to kind of take just a couple of these verses and I want to start breaking this down a little bit but in the days of the what the voice of the seventh angel now this this word voice I I'll spell it for you and then I'll tell you how it sounds the word in the Greek for voice is p h o NE e all that can spell you should say Amen this is what that word means in the original phone but the way you say it is phony so you see the thing about the message is it's either going to produce a Divine voice to you or it's going to create a phony because there's always two classes of people in any Revival you've got those that hear from God and then you've got a bunch of phonies it followed around too now notice the voice or the phone when you're talking on a phone this ain't no spiritual conference call you got a number he's got a number and you are connected directly to the voice this is the whole reason the Rapture is going to be a complete and total secret to the entire world the resurrection will be on the Rapture will be on it'll be a complete secret to everybody else why only those that have had the original phone call only those that have been connected to the voice are the ones that's going to know when it comes time to get out of here hallelujah and you see the thing about the messages not everybody gets the same phone call they'll be thousands of thousands of people that will never get that call because the message is only for the bright that's why friends whenever we go to preaching salvation and we preach salvation by William brandom we make an antichrist out of our Prophet salvation comes by Jesus Christ a person can be saved a person can be Sanctified a person can be ever so close to the Holy Ghost and never go far enough to actually receive the Holy Ghost and they don't even have to hear about the message or brother brandom to be saved but if they want to make the Rapture or go as a part of the Bride of this day it takes the message to put you in that category cuz that's what that voice was sent for was to prepare a bride not the whole world the bride you understand this is the reason why for many years we've thrown everybody in hell that can't see the message many can't they're not called to it but through the years people drive beat their families in the head and drive them down all you got to see the message only if they get a phone call if they don't I keep my token over them and I keep praying and if I can just get them saved if I can just see and meet Jesus and get saved that's good enough for me it's up to him after that what does he want to do with them it's up to the Lord after that are you with me say Amen but the message itself is to the special prophetic class they're the ones that need to hear it because they're the ones that need to know how to get ready yeah it's the sound of uttered words meaning this is a living voice so just because brother bram's voice went quiet on us doesn't mean that the living voice has that same living voice is still speaking and not just when you push play Nei not just when you P push the little button on your live stream but that should be something you hear in your prayer closet when you're sitting on your job or you're driving a for cliff or whatever it is when you're baking pies or cookies say whatever it is you're doing you ought to be able to hear me in contact with that voice it ought to be something that is so intimate to you because Jesus said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow and if I'm in direct contact with that voice then I should be able to move on to the next part which is to become the very voice that I'm listening to now watch this the mystery of course the hidden purpose but notice he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared this word declared means to bring joyful Tidings of God's kindness you see the message was never intended brother Tom to be a beating stick to drive people into hell brother BR we were never intended as preachers to take this message and blast people into Oblivion that wasn't the reason the message came now many have done that many have lived that way we preached that way many years ago ourself I'm sure some of yall might think I'm still there but the message itself is a joyful sound to you it is a sound of Liberation a sound of Freedom a sound that you can be saved delivered that God can turn your life Al and revolutionize your walk with him the message was never intended to be dark sounds and dark words and heavy Prophecies of Doom gloom and if it's been done that way it's because people have made it that way but this message should be a sounding board of freedom for every person that wants to hear it thank you Lord now watch this now now let's look at verse eight and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea upon the Earth and I went to the angel and S notice he's speaking now look what boldness comes out of this boy give me the little book now you understand who he's talking to right this is not William brandham this is the mighty Angel this is Christ the messenger of the Covenant with the rainbow above his head Jesus himself he takes this book and it comes down to open it up to give us the the the ability to tap into the potential in that book this is the whole reason why the Bible said in the last days we would have the manifestation of the sons of God why because the message itself would release to the elect of God the ability to come back to that kind of position while Martin Luther was here the best a person could do was get justified by faith and they didn't even understand what that looked like that just meant being forgiven of your past sins but real justification was solved up here in the last day when he told us that justify really means as Paul had said it before and as it's found in the Bible that we are justified by faith it means that we were forgiven as though it never happened in the first place woo Glory brother you talk about the Forgiveness of sins Hallelujah so the best a person could do in Pentecost the best a person could do during the Wesleyan age and while brother Brandon was here the best we could do was just follow along with the restoring of the word until it came time for that part of the mystery to come open and here stands John give me the little book it's it's almost like he read that scripture that Paul said come boldly it's almost like he was familiar with that understanding of come boldly wasn't he been afraid to say to Christ give it to me I think brother if I've been standing before the Lord I'd have been a little scared or squeamish to say too much y'all looking at me a little funny but you know if you were standing in the presence of that light like Danny Greenfield and these other ones we heard stories about if you were standing there in the real authentic sacred presence of God you wouldn't be jumping and running and hollering and acting like some kind of a smart Elling you'd be scared to breathe and anybody that's ever been in the real genuine authentic presence of the Lord like that you know what it's like it's a terrifying thing it's not Joys and shouts that's when the anointing is on but when you start entering into the real sacredness of the lord it's such a fearful thing and yet Paul said come boldly anyways Glory how to come boldly to him and speak to him much less demand him give me my Holy Ghost give to me my healing give to me the portion of my inheritance that belongs to me start looking at like this you realize how kind of backward type Christians we've been through the years huh how LAX and almost squeamish we've been about things I guarantee if we really saw in the right way we would understand that Christ wants us to not only be bold but authorative not demanding now that's different demanding comes from the realm of selfishness I want I want I want therefore you better give it to me that's that attitude of entitlement well I'm the bride Hallelujah so you give it to me because I'm the bride but it's an air of humility knowing I'm not saying this to you Lord I'm not asking of this Lord because I feel like that I deserve it or I'm worthy of it but I'm I'm doing it because you said it's mine glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and because you said it's mine give me the little book now you know doctorally this book you can go a thousand ways with it but in its Simplicity this book represents the very tital deed to the blessings of God which you receive by the way when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost access access to the blessings of God you have not because you ask not all you got to do is speak oh praise the Lord now watch he takes this book he eats it it's sweet in his mouth bitter in his belly because it changes the appetite you see once you receive the Holy Ghost the things you used to Crave after you don't anymore there's a fell he just went on to be with the Lord about six seven months ago but I remember his testimony down in Dayton Ohio he was telling about how they used to drink all the time and and run to bars and everything the Lord saved him in a old fashioned meeting and he received the Holy Ghost and he he he said I got in my car and he said I would go drive to them same bars and go sit in a parking lot way off to the side and pray against them do you know 11 of them 11 of them in Dayton Ohio 11 of them burnt to the ground because he asked God to destroy them hell Dives no he wasn't an arsonist and no they're not looking for him but all of them some different mechanical failure some electrical failure some kind of fell was playing around with some kind of a cigarette lighter and it fell in a bunch of alcohol every one of them burnt to ashes because he go in there and he sit in that parking lot for a few minutes and start praying God you know what this place done to me you know what it done to my family how many more is it is it tormented how many more devils are getting their way with people tonight Lord destroy this place sounds presumptuous in a way but when you know your voice you speak it cuz Watch What Happens Next and he said unto me thou must prophesy again in other words you've got to have a voice once you know your potential speak amen oh thank you Lord in the breach brother B said like this it's Redemption means all legal possession that was lost by Adam and Eve it belongs to you again so what of it Brethren the possession of that deed not watch now in Proverbs 18: 21 the Bible said death and life are in the power of the tongue that's not referring to just simply whether the muscle is strong or not that's not the power of of the tongue that might be the strength of it but that's not the power of it the power of the tongue is what's hiding in here because what's in here will be what's entertained up here and what's entertained up here will be what's spoken out here because Jesus said out of the heart proceedes watch this again in Matthew 12:36 but I say every idal word that men shall speak they'll give account thereof in the day of judgment watch now for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned so if you want to be blessed what you say will bless you if you expect to be condemned at some point in your life more than likely go back and look at what you said and it will follow you through to condemnation many people don't realize they're their Own Worst Enemy because of how they talk all the time yeah what they meditate on what they think on do you realize that when you sit around all the time going oh I'm sick I'm sick oh boy I'm sick I'm in a mess boy my life is is is is leaving me Bo I'm sicker than I've ever been boy I I'm you realize what the devil's trying to get you to do meditate on it and give your tongue negative power so you know what we ought to do recogniz the devil in every one of his tricks and every time he comes by and tells you you're getting worse say shut your mouth I'm getting better every single day that I live praise the Lord feel bad what do you mean feel bad I don't go on feelings I go on faith Satan knows if he can just get you to entertain it long enough right here in the heart and the mind the thoughts that's the Dynamo where power is created how much stronger would our experiences be before God if we would take the word into our mouth instead of speaking every old stupid thing that goes through our brain now watch this in diseases and afflictions brother said like this God can't do nothing till you first confess that he is I love this right here you see there's a system a pattern so to speak yeah that in order for us to get to the spot to where we can receive blessings and healings we we got to go start at the very beginning of it the first thing is to recognize he is he is what doesn't matter he is cuz when you're talking about all the English language French whatever other kind of language we'll fail to describe what Al really means when it comes to God we know what we know but he's Way Beyond even what we we know here the Bible said you must first accept that he is Paul telling us you've got to acknowledge Him First why where do you think you get power to speak if you don't recognize where the power began if I wanted to to to speak healing to my body or to someone else how could I ever muster up enough intellectual power to get that person there I couldn't do it because they've been trying for years and years and years and they comat back and forth and one study and one peer review this and one argument and one experiment one test they can't figure out whether you're supposed to drink coffee or not and every new study tells you do it will say no don't you dare do it and somebody else will come along and say if you do it your that's Death to Your Body the next one coming along saying if you don't do it it'll kill you praise the Lord how could I take the power of their mind and apply healing to me or you I can't do it but if I take a step back and I acknowledge there's one there's one by his stripes I am already healed that I didn't have to do it for me anyways it's not up to me to heal my body it's it's not up to you to heal your body I just simply acknowledge he is he is the Healer he is the savior he is the deliverer he is all and all and if I start there I'm on a pretty good road for whatever comes after that cuz what could the devil do to combat that what could Satan really say to fight that if he comes to me and say oh see you ain't got enough faith it doesn't matter if I have faith he is what you you messed up and got scared it doesn't matter if I'm scared he still is that's my part that's a me problem that's not a him problem he's the one that already declared by my strip you are already healed and all I got to do no matter how weak I might get no matter how much doubt may come through me no matter how scared I might get or how many nightless nights I sleep all I got to do is come right back to Center and start right back at the first and say you know what Lord in spite of everything all my little Humanities and weaknesses that doesn't matter I'm sorry you forgive me for that here we are Lord you are do you remember what he told Moses when he's getting ready to deliver those children out of Egypt go down and tell them I am that I am you know if that was good enough advice for a little old 80y bald-headed Prophet to go down with a crooked stick in his hand and take over the most powerful nation in the world and lead two million people three or 4 days journey across the Wilderness to a land FL and full of milk and honey on the message I am that I am and brother in this day and age it ought to be supercharged and Super Sonic beyond that not I was that I was or I will be that I will be but I am that I am not a god Bound by time cuz the worst thing into a person's faith is time and sight and those two things always draw you back into that war of do I believe it do I believe it I know you have to have faith but listen your own human faith is just not good enough because you can believe with everything that you got in you and yet your human faith will fail you but if I keep coming back to one thing and I start saying lord it's really not my faith that I need what I need is your faith I need you believing this through me then no matter how many times I might waver or this or that or that doesn't matter I'm confident that what he says is going to be that way amen he says then you confess it believe it act on it and stay with it and then God will bring you out he says do you believe that notice again Minister explained he said now he's the high priest of your con can I get a few more minut see your time all right thank you he's the high priest of your confession you get what I mean you confess what you are and that's what you are that sounds pretty simple don't it why is that the hardest thing to do then if it's that easy why is it the hardest thing to do because your body and your flesh your human spirit is not designed after the fall is made it was designed by God to do the right things but after the fall it's tainted and no matter how much of the word you fill this with that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil will still find evil somewhere to wrap around in no matter how much you might say you believe it or else your spirit does not have the ability to or else it's made up of a mixed tree and no matter how good it may behave at certain times it's going to fail you that's going to waver back to the other side and it's going to do the exact opposite so you got to make it do the right thing and how do I do that I confess it to the place I want it when it don't want to I make it anyways some of y'all might think I was crazy now you know I am don't you I'm not too crazy now I know where I'm standing on some of this brother says a man will never live any higher than what he believes he's living you take a man talking about drinking all the time he talks about thinks about it he drops right down into that category why he talks himself into being what he says he is his body just obeys the confession he speaks it the body says yep that's what I am because the body is made and designed to follow your voice what you think what you say all of those two little uh those two simple elements together Encompass a lot of thinking in the middle of the night and a lot of negativity from the radio and on and on and on no wonder brother B said that when we get ready for church to come in sit down and take some time 30 minutes he said and read our Bible and pray before church wonder why wonder why cuz we've been bombarded the entire day with foolishness and then we come into church the song leader does his best to kind of get us into a rhythm of worship and things like that and sometimes you win sometimes you lose I've led singing too a lot through my life and I know how it is with some people sometimes they come ready to sing Sometimes they come ready to stare I've had more staring contests with congregations in this world in my lifetime than what I ever care to recall and it should not be that way but we live under the effects of this leoan time where that's constantly around us constantly bombarding us constantly hammering at us which is why we should spend time praying and getting away from all of that spend time with our Bible and with the Lord right to ask God to quieten all them voices in us until we can hear hear from him and only him amen cuz what I believe I am is the way I will train my body to act I'll train my voice to speak that way you ever say something and wonder what I say that for I always say that I say that constantly what do I say them things like that for where do they come from you just don't realize those are reactions out of you that you've been training into you for years you ever wonder how some kids start speaking English when you first hear that little baby he's going g g go go next thing you know he won't shut up spend our whole first couple years trying to tell him to walk and speak and then spend the next 16 tell them sit down and shut up that's right huh how did they learn learn how to speak English in big words the environment around them just kept hammering it into them and that human Spirit was designed not to just hear Mommy and Daddy's voice but all the voices around them the next thing you know whatever went in is the thing that starts coming out and you're riding down the road and they say something clever and you can't get it on the phone fast enough and you're yelling at one another quick record it get it on Facebook for the L of God put it on Instagram quack I got 322 people need need to see this right now right now where did it come from they lived in an environment where things were trained into them to produce a result out like oh God if it's that way just learning the language how much more should it be for Christians that we live in the environment of Christ we live in an atmosphere of the Lord what do you think is going to come out of us when we live in such an atmosphere spiritual Supernatural things friends if brother was against television and movies and things this is why he was against it not because he was going to throw you in hell if you went and saw some little cartoon at Christmas time or something like that come on quit being such a ridiculous legalist if such things would send people to hell in this message there'd be a thousand I'm in hell right now that wasn't what brother Brown was trying to get at Hollywood's power has nothing to do with some little entertaining show it's the atmosphere it creates around the human mind when you take some of these kids and some of these people that live in these video game worlds where they're killing all the time look look what kind of aggression comes out of that child and it doesn't even realize it's being aggressive why it's the world it lives in all the time praise the Lord Brother Carol used to tell this joke many years ago he said how do you know that the deacons the the preachers kids are so means because they was always playing with the Deacon's kids something like that it's the atmosphere this is why you're known by your company huh that's one reason why young people Mom Dad may not let want you to hang around with certain people they know what kind of influence it can have on you you may not recognize the influence but it's there just the same and before you know it your behavior will alter things will change in the way you behave and how you speak and you'll hear your mom and dad say what's the matter with you why are you talking to me that way and you're confused as as they are confused but that's how smart the devil is he knows how to put things in us and we're not even aware of it oh Lord have mercy somebody help me if it's that way with the devil how much more if we kept that word David said kept it taped amen tied to his fingers kept it before his eyes day and night if the word was an influence around us all the time Godly company and Christian fellowship and those things were around us all the time you know what it do it produce that Christlike Behavior out of usen Praise the Lord now again and as it was with Moses he said now let's him him that's weak say I am strong he said just say that in your heart I'm strong now I've accepted Jesus as my healer never have a negative testimony anymore for he is setting there the high priest to make good before the father on the confession that he has done it Divine Healing can't be any pler than that he says and it's to the weakest Christian remember God's word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition I can't whip it that way but the word can whip it that way because the word has power in now watch this the manifestation of the spirit brother said remember it isn't how much you cry it isn't how much you repent or how low you cry to God and it isn't how sincere you can be huh so in other words coming to church and just becoming emotional is good it's a part of it but that alone doesn't get you there you see I wonder sometimes if Church hasn't become a thing where it's almost like one big cheerleading session where we get everybody like in the football game get them just screaming and hollering and running but when all that emotion passes what's anchored because you know what troubles me you go to these camps and these special meetings and you go to and I preach in conventions with these brothers and I see things happening and people running into the Altar and screaming and crying I think thank the Lord for that but to go back and three months later you got the same group of people doing the same exact things that they' done three months before that and it goes on year after year at what point do we wake up and say maybe we're not going going far enough yes I want to see you worship yes I love to see the people of God emotional but when that's all settled down I want you to have faith in your heart to know who you are who he is and where you stand preach to me somebody cuz without that how what God does it do us to get all worked up and happy if we don't even know why we're happy we got to be solidly grounded we got to be have such a foundation underneath us brother said it's how much Faith you have when you come to him he doesn't save you on the merits of your prayer or your righteousness he saves you upon the merits of faith and brother even more than that it's not even my faith that he really even saves me on the merits of it's the fact that I believe what he said and God can see that I believe it and thank God I've got justce enough ability to kind of let go and let him have his way cuz if it wasn't for that I wouldn't be here today and neither would you cuz if it was left up to me opening the door to Jesus I know we try to make it sound like when we got saved we just grabed the door and threw it up yeah come on in Lord do what you want I gave him just enough to get a big toe in between the door and Me closing it you did too cuz no man seeks God at any time come on don't you look at me that way we all run from these things like this but God knows how to get us in a place where we're just simply willing to say okay Lord okay okay and that's all he needs is just that momentary willingness because if you me it with all of your heart you are on your road prise Lord thank you brother said take a woman that come here a man let him be ever so vile listen to these words they could scream and cry and walk up and down the altar saying God forgive me day in and day out I've repented done everything I could do keep pacing but he said until they believe it and confess it then he can't go to work on it until they do he cannot intercede until first you confess that he is man says woo I feel pretty good I love this again he said uh we have found him and come and see he said we have a high priest working on what not your crying not your repentance not your faith ah so it even goes deeper than that he is not the high priest of my faith huh he's the author of my faith he's the finisher of my faith but he's not the high priest of my faith he's the high priest of My conf Confession yeah so I can have Faith all day long and all day all night long but until first I open my mouth and start saying okay Lord I believe what you said in your word I am healed I am saved I am delivered I am I I am I am I I'm free from this thing or I I am bless whatever it is that you put in your mouth he cannot be the high priest of it until you speak it cuz some people say well I got faith that's it's only half the picture cuz James put it in perspective when he said faith without works is dead as Pastor said at the beginning of the service we've got to act upon what we say praise the Lord kind of like John Ryan when he went into that barber shop he'd been testifying extra extra read all about it and all of a sudden one day telling the his eyes come wide open and it went running down the street that that barber cap still on him it was flying behind him like Superman I guess he felt like Superman after that happened right but he just kept saying it extra extra read all about it man that was blind is healed people thought John shut up ain't nothing happened to you you knit with but Jesus was saying the same thing that John was saying and every time John would say man was blind is healed Jesus say man that was blind extra extra he'd tell it throughout Heaven extra extra read all about it man that was blind is healed amen Glory thank you Jesus thank you Lord cuz that's what confession is say the same [Music] thing if God tells me I'm Healed brother I don't care what critic raises up against it or what I even think about it myself if I'm Healed I'm Healed if I'm saved I'm saved praise the Lord listen to this again I hear people say many times oh it hit me in the face like a mighty rushing wind that might be all right but that wasn't why you were saved you were saved because you believed no matter what experience might have went with it the first thing was you had to believe now it's a strange thing many people say well I'm weak I don't have much faith and things he said that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then never permit a negative thought to come to your mind if you can help it again message of Grace he said see here here at the altar day and night praying doesn't do you a bit of good until you believe he forgives you and then you stand up and speak I talking about Jonah who had all the con the the the symptoms and things wh watch how he T takes Jonah what he says about him he said now look at our symptoms look at Jonah he said shame on us he refused to look at them you understand this is where the man's Faith was anchored that Solomon said if a man gets in trouble let him look toward that Temple and God said he would hear from heaven so what he was looking at was nothing but a bunch of of whales belly everywhere he looked seaweed and darkness and God knows what El a man was looking at much less swimming in vomiting everything else in the world good Lord yeah and yet there was something about him that he remembered the word of the Lord I don't care what you're in right now or what kind of circumstances you might be swimming around in right now if you'll just look back to the promise of God that said I am your deliver he'll deliver you the same as he did Jonah cuz he is the same yes yesterday today and forever prise the Lord glory to God but it's not a declaration of what I can do you see this is where we got to be careful we tell people now you confess it I'm not confessing I am doing [Laughter] anything amen I am not confessing that I have the power to do anything I am not not confessing of my memory I'm not confessing of my ability to quote I'm not confessing of my ability to do anything I am confessing that he is my deliverer he is and as I confess him he said if you'll acknowledge me before my father and the Holy Angels I'll acknowledge you if I confess him he'll turn right around and confess he'll turn right around and confess me if I say he is my healer he'll say I am your healer he is my deliverer I am your deliverer one of these days brother I'm going to say it he is my resurrection and he's going to sweep down somewhere between 600 and 9 and say I am your resurrection and your rapture thank you Lord cuz my confession isn't based upon the doctor it isn't based upon their tests it isn't based upon their expertise and though they may be a sincere as God himself that's not where my confession May I'm not basing it upon an herb or a pill or a shot or a surgery My Confession is is that God heals all right brother said again the other day he heals by music he heals by love he heals by this he said he heals by so many things oh and I thought that brother Brad that that so many things I thought there's so many more things that we don't even know how God brings healing but my confession is not based on I'm believing I'm feeling it doesn't matter what I think it's upon the finished work of calvary you might be saying well I need this brother Ben hey I need it too sure I need to hear these things as much as any other human being does just because a man preaches the gospel and the anointing and does things like that doesn't mean that he's immune from all these other things men get discouraged men get upset men get sick but what would I do stand there and say oh Lord You know here I'm a preacher and I've been faithful to you and upon those merits I ask that you heal me or do something what what no good will my merits do when all of my righteousness is filthy rags the only thing I could do is just go to him and say Lord upon the basis of your sacrifice upon you being the perpetuation of Calvary upon your word that said if I'll confess it you'll do it praise God he said they're just lying vanities he said well God give us men of women men and women of rugged Faith who not look at the symptoms or anything else the devil hands to you they'll just hand it back to him and say I believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ I believe in his all sufficient power I believe his presence is here to set me free from any bondage that Satan puts on me see now you're talking with power now you're talking with authority CU it's not standing there saying well Lord I believe the message for so long and I you remember the story of Danny Greenfield you remember the brother tells about this great evangelist he gets in the presence of God it's a dream and as he gets in the presence of the light he said I've done so many things evangelized and traveled and preached and done great signs and wonders he said but in the presence of that light brother Joe none of that meant anything what good the greatest preacher that's ever been what goodness could he present next to a god of Eternity a he's a peon he's a blip on a radar not even that compared to a holy God like our lord Jesus and yet many times whenever we fall in these situations we'll you'll find yourself saying now Lord I've tried to be a good Christian I I've tried to live right I I've tried to be faithful now Lord you see I'm in this situation but I've always tried to be true to you that ain't got nothing to do with what's going to happen in the next steps of your life you're trying to produce something based upon your own merits none of that matters but what matters is when you look past all of that and say Lord good or bad it doesn't matter but I'm looking to you you are the finished work of Calvary let me read you this and let's quit calling Jesus on the scene brother B said a sinner might come here at the altar as a young man or woman at the age of 14 they bring your meals here you cry until you were 90 years old and would never be saved until first you accept what he's done for you now you you can see why modern-day Pentecostal stuff don't work because it's approaching it from the wrong realm from the wrong from the wrong approach of things if if you get up here start telling a bunch of sad stories and get everybody sad and feeling Gloom and and doom and then I tell don't you want to be saved where you can go where grandmother susel is and don't you want to have the Holy Ghost so you don't go to hell like Old Uncle Winford what good does that do in getting you saved when you're moving upon the merits of an emotional thing rather than upon the gospel that said all have sin and come short of the glory of God and if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved that's my foundation not this stuff over here now don't be deceived if I think that tool is going to get you there I'll use that tool to get you there I'll make you Squall I'll make you ball I'll make you scream I'll make you run I'll make you pass out on the floor and then I will throw that word 15 times as hard as I can right in your lap and say okay what about it mix them together now you got a good Evangelistic sermon anybody ever knew Billy Andrews he could scare the liver out of you in a matter of 30 minutes and then get to the altar call and start preaching down from 10 he start 10 if you ain't in this altar by one you in trouble honey and he made you feel it cuz about the time he got to number five the the Flames of hell were so hot you could smell smoke in the building it worked if you got a gospel message attached to it but what good does it do to tell give people a bunch of Hope based upon no scripture at all as a preacher my job is to affect you in any way I can to get you back into the word used to be an old boy he's gone to he's gone to Glory now Ernest fure you ever new brother fure great guy Berry coffee's father-in-law is who it is and Ernest used to run those big big tent meetings years ago the sawdust on the floor and the whole thing thousand people 10,000 people didn't matter and I asked him one time I said when it comes to evangelism how did you behave when you was my age he said i' climb I'm up on a tent pole and preach if I could get them to listen to me he said one time I done cartwheels just to get their attention sure I'll do whatever it takes to try to get you to listen to me but when I've got your ear I want to feel your ears with this you see I don't have any problem with a man that has a little theatrics what he preaches or maybe a little theatrical or he tells stories or that that's all right with me as long as when he's done doing all that I know where he's I'm landing as long as I know what the message is when it's all over with I'm okay with that they can preach to me in a clown suit if they got a message to preach don't matter to me or overhauls or anything else Lord y'all getting quiet wo you're getting quiet because that's what we should be watching for what are they going to tell me that's the danger if we get caught up in all of the Charisma of something you know you can get caught up in a song it's a beautiful song used to be this song many years ago that would come on one of these Hillsong people or whoever did and and man I used to sing the fire of that thing going up and down the road and Worship the Lord and everything one day all of a sudden I heard it again I thought wait a minute it's a stupid trinitarian song this DN thing made me so mad I thought I've been worshiping for six months to a trinitarian song because I was listening to the music and the music moved me and I thought I assumed that it was a Oneness song Until I heard second person that was all it said everything else was just as it was but I heard second person when I heard that second person oh it was nice and cloaked in there nice and quiet nice and hid and sandwiched in the middle but I thought you got to be kidding me this crazy thing it's a trinitarian song Oh but boy felt good singing it but that's the problem if you don't watch for what's going on and if you're not paying attention emotions and Charisma can catch you quickly have you ever went to the Lord and tried to tell him now Lord I've been faithful all these years now you probably won't say it out loud probably a little scared to say it out loud huh but I'll speak it for you because there have been many times you go to God and you say now Lord I've tried to be a good Christian I tried is that what Paul said that when we approach him boldly be sure to bring your laundry list and resume of everything you've done right as a matter of fact the one thing that I loved about Moses when Moses went to God the first time you know he gave a good resume of all of the wars and the campaigns and things he won but then he went out 80 years in the wilderness and he came back God asked him if he wanted the job he said listen I can't talk I stutter I I can't do anything right I'm just a failure God said you got the job you understand that's what the Lord's looking he's not looking what can we do but how much are we willing to let him do the rest sure my simple little old silly stupid story about that song it's a good example you know of how easy it is to get caught up in those things really that's the distraction that Satan wants to put on you though distract you from what really matters which is nothing more than just pure faith and confessing what he's already done and just staying right there now what happens if I get weak brother Ben repent admit it tell God I'm sorry I got weak started doubting got fussy whatever it I'm sorry Lord forgive me and just zero right back in Lord Jesus if you don't move for me if you don't do something for me I don't know what else I could do for myself you understand some years ago and they're just now proving it now it's coming out what we've always known that they broke that Co disease out in that laboratory in Wuhan and fouchy and that Bunch covered it up suspicious that just the very day after uh some of these things started coming to light the evidences and what more isn't it amazing that all of a sudden President Biden pardons fouchy amazing isn't it after millions of people people are in their grave Saints and everything but brother Brenham told us in the last days there would be germ warfare and we're seeing evidence of it broke right around us all the time you think that's the last of it they're still in these Laboratories around the world doing more and more and more and more look at how people got so caught up until they were fighting Wars and parking lots over a person had a mask on and they proved the mass didn't do nothing wasn't nearly as effective as they let on China I teach these kids English in China and have for five years now China had a major lockdown early last year they kept them quarantined over and they kept getting sicker and sicker and sicker you know what finally one of the main leaders done he said open everything up within six months there was not Co spoke of again people got their natural antibodies and they was able to fight the disease naturally but if you look back at our media during the time and you look at all the circus that was going on around during this one small little thing called covid-19 people were scared to death I heard people in the message calling that the mark don't take the shot now that's the mark of the beast you know what I'm trying to say to you especially us Americans we get caught up in what what we hear and what we see and what we should have done vaccinated or not if somebody wanted to get vaccinated you know what they should have done walk up and bore their shoulder and said in the name of Jesus Christ Mark 16 if I drink any deadly thing it will not harm me but you know what a lot of people done started making it some kind of a of an issue and every bit of it got people so far away from this right here folks were living in fear left and right I hope you're listening to me church it was only a foreshadow of what's getting ready to come in this nation after a while and there won't be enough vaccinations in the world to stop what's coming next because brother BR said there' come a disease where they would rot in their own flesh that would make cancer look like a toothache friends if we're the bride and truly We believe We Are shouldn't we be practicing how to Anchor our faith down right now that's so if another great assault Came Upon This Nation or if another great thing Came Upon people that we wouldn't be sitting in our homes scared to death and worrying and biting the end of our fingernails off but we'd be sitting back there Bible open letting off the pressure he is my healer I've told you this before but when I went in the hospital going on four years now and as my lungs were eat alive with pneumonia first time I'd ever had it in my entire life I went in there and they're they're all scared to oh he going to die he going to die I was sitting in that little room waiting on them they put the little oxygen thing on my nose you know and I'm sitting in there and it just just for the first time I said to myself huh I could die over this maybe it just hit me maybe I could die huh okay oh well I didn't take it too seriously not really I just thought well death ain't no big deal that's all right death just ushered me into my new body I worryed about that and all at once I heard the Lord just I had a momentary just of fear just what about Sam and the girls what about my mom oh man my brother and them oh and I heard the Lord speak to me and say this is not a sickness unto death for the next seven days sitting in that hospital and then people walking in they had all their mask and everything on they come in they go how are you feeling today and you could just tell by the way they were acting this is a dead man in a few hours they'd come in I'd say what are you talking so softly for are you sick one nurse came in there just very quietly and and I'm not making fun of these people they did their job they wanted to do the best they could but but they didn't have the Revelation I did they come in real gingerly and that lady she picked up my arm and she rolled me over I felt like Paul Raider after a few minutes I said well honey turn it over and Jab that needle in there you ain't going to kill me the differences brother sister when we look away from all of the circumstances around us and put our eyes solely on what what he done then all of these Earthly Shadows can just disappear around us God fill us with this understanding Lord double triple quadruple portions fill every one of us with this understanding and may we walk out of here changed from knowing how to have the right kind of faith in God Amen let's stand together thank you for your time I know I've been a little lengthy but I I appreciate it very much glory to God think of it brother sister to have the ability to shut off the world behind them when they went into that inner Veil they pull those curtains behind them and had those little pomegranates on them and he go back here and take that blood back in there the Holy Spirit would come down and that fire and that smoke would go up through there you know what brother Brandon said when he got back in there he said that room was completely soundproof they couldn't hear him on the inside and they couldn't hear the outside couldn't be heard inside oh God shut my mind and my ears off to anything contrary to your word Lord shut it off to any inside voices any me voices any them voices and let me just concentrate and listen to only one voice and that's your voice Lord that my faith could rest in what you've done not what I'm doing CU you see friends we could live ever so healthy take somebody like Bruce Lee the guy was an epitome a physical specimen took one aspirin had a complication that killed him his boy done the same thing these men didn't have an ounce of fat on their body strong and healthy they said that many of the movies that Bruce Lee did they had to film some of them scenes in slow motion because he was so fast the camera couldn't even catch his punches and kicks took an aspirin and it killed him we could do take all the vitamins and do all the healthy stuff that we think we should do drink the juices and all of that might be okay but don't put your faith in things like that because you don't know what's working in your cells and what you've inherited what's been handed down and you don't know what the Lord will allow you to go through so don't put your faith in juices and pills and doctors and well if I have this surgery it's going to solve it all many have said that about a surgery come right out of the surgery need 10 more my faith isn't in those things my faith is resting in the promise of God that said by his stripes I am already healed not what I done what he done let's pray together Lord Jesus thank you for your word this morning oh God thank you Lord for speaking to us like you have you've been so wonderful and so good Lord I'm so grateful for how you've spoken Lord when you put this on my heart to come bring here I I didn't fully understand it even but hearing these brothers talk and how much sickness has been around the church and things like that Lord looks like it's just a good season to bring these things in and then to hear that that's been the mind of the church here and the messages been following that pattern I pray that what's been said Lord will be complimentary to what's been done and accomplished may you take the word that's been preached today and may you just sink it deep into our hearts Lord father help us receive it as truth and help us set aside anything contrary to those those realities because Lord It's Easy for us to quote these things but Lord help us believe them take any Speck of Doubt out of us Lord let us be like the little man that said I believe but help thou my unbelief take anything contrary out of us Lord may your word just as it's visited the People by preaching May the word visit them in spirit as well may Lord Jesus you bring forth fruit from what's been preached help your
