[1:23:03] this morning
[1:23:15] between The Landings
[1:23:19] that's what God told me to deal with the

[2:05:20] ourselves together Lord on this side of
[2:05:22] Eternity Lord and Lord with your
[2:05:24] children father Lord to come to present
[2:05:27] ourselves before you Lord and to see if
[2:05:29] there's any bad places in our lives Lord
[2:05:31] and places where we need to change Lord
[2:05:34] and and Lord from what we are Lord to
[2:05:37] what we're supposed to be we ask God
[2:05:39] that you'll just take the meditation of
[2:05:41] our heart and that which we feel you've
[2:05:43] laid Upon Our Hearts to minister this
[2:05:45] morning and place it father in every
[2:05:47] heart just place it in the way that only
[2:05:49] the Holy Spirit Can Do Lord and we ask
[2:05:52] God that you bless each one here each
[2:05:55] one's streaming Lord we ask your
[2:05:56] blessing upon them Lord and we do want
[2:05:58] to thank you and praise you for your
[2:06:00] goodness Lord this morning in Jesus name
[2:06:02] we ask it amen and amen turn your bibles
[2:06:06] if you will
[2:06:08] amen
[2:06:17] amen let's go to um
[2:06:21] Philippians I believe it is
[2:06:25] thinking yes Philippians
[2:06:31] take another little thought just a
[2:06:33] couple of words amen as we have done
[2:06:36] sometimes in the past I mean just
[2:06:39] something that I felt like the Lord just
[2:06:41] laid on my heart in me to speak on
[2:06:44] uh in Philippians 3
[2:06:48] Philippians the third chapter
[2:06:59] verse 13 through 21. Paul says Brethren
[2:07:04] I count not myself to have to have
[2:07:07] apprehended but there's one thing I do
[2:07:10] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:07:12] in reaching forth unto those things
[2:07:15] which are before
[2:07:17] I press Towers to mark for the prize of
[2:07:21] the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[2:07:24] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[2:07:27] be thus minded and if they're
[2:07:31] and if in anything ye are otherwise
[2:07:34] minded God will reveal even this unto
[2:07:37] you nevertheless where two we have
[2:07:41] already attained let us walk by the same
[2:07:44] rule let us mind the same thing
[2:07:48] Brethren be followers together of me
[2:07:51] amen that's quite a statement for him to
[2:07:54] make isn't it amen
[2:07:56] of me and mark them which walk so as ye
[2:07:59] have us for and it is simple for many
[2:08:02] walk of whom I have told you often and
[2:08:04] now tell you even weeping that they are
[2:08:07] the enemies of the cross of Jesus whose
[2:08:10] in this destruction whose God is their
[2:08:12] belly and whose glory is in their shame
[2:08:15] who mind Earthly things I think Paul
[2:08:19] clearly
[2:08:20] declares what kind of people these
[2:08:23] people are isn't that right they are
[2:08:26] people who care only about their own
[2:08:28] Glory they only care about their own
[2:08:31] belly their selves and the only mind
[2:08:34] Earthly things I like what Paul says
[2:08:37] here about and he kind of continues
[2:08:39] because if you'll notice Verse 18
[2:08:42] and verse 19 we're in parentheses there
[2:08:45] but back to our conversation verse 20
[2:08:48] says for our conversation is in heaven
[2:08:51] from whence also we look for the Savior
[2:08:54] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change
[2:08:57] our vile body
[2:08:59] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[2:09:02] Glo his glorious body according to the
[2:09:05] work the working whereby he is able even
[2:09:08] to subdue all things unto him may God
[2:09:12] add His blessings to the reading of the
[2:09:14] word you can be seated
[2:09:16] I thought I would just uh name this this
[2:09:20] let us let us amen amen and I told my
[2:09:25] wife to title it let us let us go amen
[2:09:28] but I was just going to title it let
[2:09:31] just talk about let him in because I
[2:09:34] like what that word uh implies amen it
[2:09:38] applies to me uh a a word of action
[2:09:42] something that's let's do something amen
[2:09:45] and action words let us let us do
[2:09:48] something amen and Paul's saying here of
[2:09:50] course you'll see that word uh let us
[2:09:53] therefore as many as be perfect amen be
[2:09:57] thus minded and then verse 16 again let
[2:10:01] us walk let us walk by the same rule let
[2:10:07] us mind the same thing one thing about
[2:10:10] it is that it doesn't say I or you or
[2:10:14] myself it talks about more than one you
[2:10:17] know and not that any of us wouldn't
[2:10:20] walk with the Lord and Duty things by
[2:10:22] herself and it is a a personal walk with
[2:10:25] God but he's talking to a group of
[2:10:28] people it's more than one I don't know
[2:10:30] about you but it's nice to have more
[2:10:31] than one
[2:10:33] amen it's nice to have brothers and
[2:10:35] sisters of like Faith going having the
[2:10:38] same goal having the same ambition amen
[2:10:43] so Paul he was a he was he was quite
[2:10:46] quite a man that believed in
[2:10:49] amen forward motion
[2:10:52] it reminds me and make me think of the
[2:10:55] Israelites whenever they came to kadish
[2:10:58] Barney and they sent those spies over
[2:11:00] there
[2:11:00] so you know and then
[2:11:05] take it
[2:11:07] let's take it at once let's go we can do
[2:11:11] it because God is with us us
[2:11:17] amen because God is with us we're more
[2:11:20] than able amen uh started out basically
[2:11:25] I had the thought to kind of come to me
[2:11:28] of where brother Brandon one time he
[2:11:29] questions and answers she was talking
[2:11:31] about amen uh uh he was speaking to them
[2:11:35] he says I'm here to try to help you
[2:11:37] because I love you you're my children
[2:11:39] that I have begotten to Christ I claim
[2:11:42] every one of you I claim you tonight I
[2:11:44] claim you all the time and and I always
[2:11:47] claim you you're my brother and my
[2:11:49] sister you're my children I'm your
[2:11:51] father in The Gospel not a father like
[2:11:53] to be a priest but your father of the
[2:11:56] Gospel like Paul said there I have
[2:11:58] begotten you to Christ I have espoused
[2:12:01] you to Christ that's engaged you to
[2:12:04] Christ as a chaste virgin he said don't
[2:12:07] let me down don't let me down amen and I
[2:12:12] thought you know if that's me
[2:12:14] think if you think about how that God
[2:12:17] loves to have and how did his ambition
[2:12:19] his goal was to have a family amen the
[2:12:22] family unit how many knows that in a
[2:12:24] family uh the mom and dad they would do
[2:12:27] anything and everything that you know to
[2:12:29] raise those children and we think about
[2:12:31] how much energy and how much love and
[2:12:34] how much self-sacrifice that goes into
[2:12:37] raising children
[2:12:39] isn't that right and the raising those
[2:12:41] children and then nurturing them and and
[2:12:44] teaching them you know teaching them
[2:12:47] what to do what not to do how to act how
[2:12:50] you know hospitality and everything that
[2:12:52] you teach them amen and then uh you know
[2:12:56] as they grow over and grow older there
[2:12:58] Comes A Time there comes a time when you
[2:13:01] know
[2:13:02] you shouldn't have to have
[2:13:05] yeah
[2:13:06] hands on them
[2:13:09] more
[2:13:11] and those kindergartened
[2:13:13] maintenance proud
[2:13:18] you're not right
[2:13:19] amen and they'll make their parents
[2:13:22] proud whenever in those uh
[2:13:29] taught them to do it
[2:13:31] and they execute it very well and you
[2:13:33] know but if they don't if they Rebel and
[2:13:36] they do everything they shouldn't have
[2:13:37] done and and you know they go out
[2:13:40] perhaps as we as Christians would teach
[2:13:42] them to be Christians and serve God and
[2:13:45] how proud We Are when our fear children
[2:13:47] get filled with the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:50] Ghost and you know you don't have to be
[2:13:51] the Holy Ghost for him anymore and force
[2:13:54] them to go to church and force them to
[2:13:56] pray and this out of the other and oh no
[2:13:58] you know but they do it on their own and
[2:14:01] how proud
[2:14:03] here it is
[2:14:06] and you know that's the way it is with
[2:14:08] God Amen and I believe it was with the
[2:14:11] prophet even with the prophet he says
[2:14:12] you know you're my kids
[2:14:14] just don't let me down amen how much
[2:14:17] more for our heavenly father we don't
[2:14:19] want to let him down either
[2:14:21] Amen in order not to let him down we
[2:14:24] have to become everything that God has
[2:14:26] tried to teach us amen how many believes
[2:14:28] that we should become everything God has
[2:14:31] taught us in
[2:14:35] that's our goal our goal is like God
[2:14:38] believe it was needed to be baptized to
[2:14:41] be why comes down to me he said suffer
[2:14:44] that need to be so for thus it behooves
[2:14:47] us to fulfill all scripture
[2:14:52] amen and this morning I want to say
[2:14:54] that's what a heart's goal is this
[2:14:55] morning is to fulfill all scripture amen
[2:15:00] to become
[2:15:02] the word of God
[2:15:04] to become what Jesus said that we was to
[2:15:06] become The Works that I do show you do
[2:15:09] also amen many scriptures but this
[2:15:12] morning with the help of the lord we
[2:15:13] want to talk a while about running this
[2:15:15] race that Paul talked about about
[2:15:16] guiding the fight about uh becoming the
[2:15:19] word of God and so we think about that
[2:15:22] and how that in the parent you know it's
[2:15:24] even the prophet of God said and he
[2:15:26] preached a message on adoption and he
[2:15:28] said how that in and the Bible teaches
[2:15:30] how to you know when you're growing up
[2:15:31] as we're growing we have a tutor
[2:15:34] or a mentor and
[2:15:36] and of course he went into the great
[2:15:38] illustration in the east side of the dad
[2:15:40] was too busy to raise his children or
[2:15:42] whatever you know and he'd have a tutor
[2:15:44] to teach the children everything that
[2:15:46] needed I don't know while he's off doing
[2:15:47] business this out of the other and that

[2:19:20] everything
[2:19:22] all I have is chains and bonds and
[2:19:25] imprisonments and all my all these
[2:19:27] things he says he could have lost
[2:19:28] everything but he didn't mind doing that
[2:19:31] because he counted it much more gained
[2:19:35] to know the Lord Jesus Christ how many

[2:20:12] that I may be found of him not having my
[2:20:15] own righteousness how many say that's my
[2:20:18] goal and then when he comes I don't want
[2:20:20] to have my own righteousness but I want
[2:20:23] to be able to say I've been washed by
[2:20:24] the blood of Jesus Christ

[2:20:40] is of god by faith that I may know him
[2:20:43] and the power of his resurrection and
[2:20:46] the fellowship of his sufferings being

[2:23:46] about two different
[2:23:48] things he says I have finished my course
[2:23:50] I've run my race amen
[2:23:53] but Paul knew
[2:23:58] what it was like to fight in a battle

[2:24:02] race
[2:24:03] amen it's talking about seeing that we
[2:24:05] are compassed about with so great a
[2:24:07] cloud of witnesses in other words
[2:24:09] there's many witnesses that have run
[2:24:11] this same race
[2:24:12] we find it over in

[2:24:43] Hebrew children escaped the edge of the
[2:24:45] sword out of weakness were made strong
[2:24:48] wax Valiant and fight turn to flight the
[2:24:52] armies of the aliens

[2:24:58] before us
[2:25:00] they had a race to run
[2:25:03] amen how many times you and I we got a
[2:25:06] race to run and it's like a relay race
[2:25:09] amen we'll get to that in a minute women
[2:25:11] received their dead raise again to life
[2:25:13] and others were tortured not accepting
[2:25:16] Deliverance that they might obtain amen
[2:25:19] now what Paul say Amen you know so fight

[2:25:29] to obtain Amen to get to something
[2:25:32] that they might obtain a better
[2:25:33] resurrection and others had trial of
[2:25:36] cruel mockings and scourgings yay
[2:25:38] moreover of the bonds and imprisonments
[2:25:41] they were stoned they were saw on a
[2:25:43] Sunday they were tempted they were slain
[2:25:45] with the sword they wondered about in
[2:25:47] sheepskins and gold skins and being
[2:25:50] tested destitute my afflicted
[2:25:54] tormented
[2:25:56] and then we whine and cry when we have a
[2:25:58] little trouble come our way
[2:26:01] huh
[2:26:03] of whom the world was not worthy they
[2:26:06] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[2:26:08] in dens and caves of the Earth
[2:26:11] hello
[2:26:12] you say that was the Old Testament no
[2:26:15] that was New Testament
[2:26:16] also sure it was the Old Testament but
[2:26:19] also new remember the catacombs of Rome
[2:26:22] brother and sister Martha they know all
[2:26:24] about it
[2:26:24] hiding in caves and and Medicaid well I
[2:26:28] understand one place I read where their
[2:26:29] caves were so expensive but the only
[2:26:31] reason they didn't catch them because
[2:26:33] the people the Believers knew the caves
[2:26:35] how to go way back in there without
[2:26:37] getting lost you could get back there
[2:26:40] and get lost never come back out
[2:26:44] live underground folks
[2:26:46] and then we have it so rough
[2:26:48] we can't come to church on Sunday
[2:26:51] come on folks
[2:26:53] isn't that right
[2:26:57] when I think about the 68 million folks
[2:26:59] that run their race
[2:27:01] they're on their lap
[2:27:04] amen they run their Church age
[2:27:07] seven laps
[2:27:09] somebody else was handed the Baton
[2:27:11] remember
[2:27:12] they always thinks he's mad but never in
[2:27:15] spirit
[2:27:16] the Holy Spirit taking another church
[2:27:18] hey they were put in the ground they run
[2:27:20] their race
[2:27:21] they give up their life they died in
[2:27:25] Christ they sealed their testimony
[2:27:27] they're over there under their messenger
[2:27:30] your age isn't that right under the
[2:27:33] altar under their messenger
[2:27:36] huh
[2:27:38] how many believes each one of them had
[2:27:40] comes up with their messenger
[2:27:42] when brother Benham seen them all of
[2:27:44] them he didn't see Paul's group and
[2:27:45] Irene is this group and Martin's group
[2:27:48] and everybody else
[2:27:49] no he's seen his group these are Yukon
[2:27:52] merch
[2:27:53] huh
[2:27:55] but they all ran that race
[2:27:57] now notice even in the Old Testament
[2:28:00] having obtained a good report they all
[2:28:02] obtained a good report but they received
[2:28:05] not the promise
[2:28:07] God having provided some better things
[2:28:10] for us that they without us should not
[2:28:14] be made perfect
[2:28:17] amen
[2:28:19] listen to what the problem of God and
[2:28:21] the way he says this when we rally there
[2:28:23] with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob he says
[2:28:26] those who were The Heirs of the promise
[2:28:29] he says they're looking forward to us
[2:28:32] not to fail
[2:28:36] amen for without us they cannot be made
[2:28:40] perfect
[2:28:41] how they're depending on us this morning
[2:28:45] let's not fail
[2:28:48] how many can say oh let us run let's run
[2:28:52] this race
[2:28:54] let's buckle up the armor and fight a
[2:28:57] little harder
[2:29:00] let's become those messages that's
[2:29:03] become the Bible let's become the word
[2:29:08] amen
[2:29:10] let us do it
[2:29:13] we can
[2:29:15] huh
[2:29:16] can a man do all these things Bill
[2:29:18] mention something do you think that it
[2:29:20] is again he says Hebrews 11 says all
[2:29:24] those who wandered about in sheepskins
[2:29:25] and goatskins destitute and all these
[2:29:28] things that they've done yet was not
[2:29:30] made perfect without us
[2:29:33] the holy spirit in this church today
[2:29:34] let's receive the token of the baptism
[2:29:36] and the Holy Spirit that the blood has
[2:29:38] been shed and that the holy spirit is
[2:29:40] upon the church because without us they
[2:29:43] cannot rise
[2:29:46] they are depending on us
[2:29:51] think about it
[2:29:53] we know that there was a resurrection
[2:29:55] and Abraham and his group came out from
[2:29:57] where they went went into a paradise but
[2:29:59] they can't come and they can't see the
[2:30:01] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:30:03] amen just like Brother Band and all
[2:30:06] those good boy they're waiting oh my God
[2:30:11] thank them all of the agers are waiting
[2:30:14] on you and me
[2:30:17] they can't see him until we finish what
[2:30:19] we started here when God has started in
[2:30:22] US
[2:30:23] and they count on you you're counting on
[2:30:26] me
[2:30:29] think about it
[2:30:31] think of how that puts it on it's just
[2:30:32] like a relay Runner you know and when
[2:30:34] they had one passes on the batons and
[2:30:36] the other one more that personal just to
[2:30:38] get it they're just to get it as hard as
[2:30:40] they can and when that last one receives
[2:30:42] that last baton they give it all they
[2:30:45] got
[2:30:51] I started to win
[2:30:54] and we're gonna win because why God has
[2:30:57] put it in you to win

[2:31:05] heart

[2:31:13] because they meant she would win and
[2:31:15] then it would win Time After Time After
[2:31:17] Time Again amen later on I guess yes off
[2:31:20] she revealed that he had it was a female
[2:31:23] uh male male called secretary all right
[2:31:26] it was a male secretary but anyway I
[2:31:29] thought you know that that
[2:31:31] it was it was special in design and
[2:31:35] that's what you are
[2:31:36] this morning you're especially designed

[2:32:16] oh Jesus stripped him of his power
[2:32:20] isn't that right and he gave you the
[2:32:22] victory

[2:38:32] that the day of the Lord shall cometh as
[2:38:34] a thief in the night for when they shall
[2:38:37] say peace and safety then sudden
[2:38:38] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[2:38:41] upon

[2:55:05] when their children are in the house of
[2:55:07] God when your children are not where
[2:55:10] they're supposed to be it's a
[2:55:12] disappointment
[2:55:17] their children are right with God

[2:55:32] I have one that believes that you ought
[2:55:34] to be able by God's grace you want to
[2:55:36] move the devil is the only one that does
[2:55:37] it but to be able to have your children

[2:56:04] letdown to my heavenly father I don't
[2:56:06] want to be a let down the prophet of God
[2:56:09] don't let me down he said don't let me
[2:56:11] down you become this word you'll become
[2:56:14] what I preached how many with me yeah
[2:56:17] that's what I want I want to be in the
[2:56:20] stature of a perfect man
[2:56:23] I want to stand in the full armor of God
[2:56:27] oh my
[2:56:30] God I'm gonna be filled with the
[2:56:31] fullness of God it just comes to amen
[2:56:35] the scripture comes to mind I'll try to
[2:56:37] go to it right quick
[2:56:42] amen you love the Lord this morning
[2:56:46] I thought about that I said Lord
[2:56:48] don't let me be a disappointment to you
[2:56:50] Lord
[2:56:51] don't let me let you down
[2:56:54] amen
[2:56:58] Hallelujah
[2:56:59] let's not let our heavenly father down
[2:57:01] or be a disappointment to him
[2:57:06] amen
[2:57:08] praise the Lord
[2:57:12] all right Ephesians
[2:57:14] 4 I believe it is if I can find it now
[2:57:17] this I like
[2:57:19] I like this Bible whenever you have the
[2:57:21] same Bible
[2:57:25] so you can go to that same page and just
[2:57:27] pick it up
[2:57:30] oh come on now
[2:57:33] praise the Lord right here it is
[2:57:35] Ephesians 4. listen to this
[2:57:38] he says he gave some Apostles some
[2:57:40] prophets and evangelists pastors and
[2:57:42] teachers for the perfecting of the
[2:57:45] Saints
[2:57:46] for the work of the ministry for the
[2:57:48] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[2:57:51] all I like that
[2:57:53] till we all come to the unity of the
[2:57:57] faith
[2:57:59] isn't it Lovely isn't it just awesome
[2:58:01] when you are a perfect Unison with
[2:58:05] somebody
[2:58:07] oh that's when they disagree
[2:58:10] with you no I don't believe it that's
[2:58:12] when you're gonna get ripped the wrong
[2:58:13] way whether you're going to still like
[2:58:15] him or not love them or not
[2:58:18] but Believers they're supposed to have
[2:58:20] Unity of Faith isn't that right same
[2:58:23] goals same ambitions
[2:58:25] of the knowledge in and of uh till we
[2:58:29] all come to the unity of the faith and
[2:58:30] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[2:58:33] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[2:58:36] stature of the fullness
[2:58:40] of Christ
[2:58:42] Lord Jesus that's what I say and I'm
[2:58:43] hoping this morning if nothing else just
[2:58:46] ask yourself what area of your life can
[2:58:49] you let God in a little bit more yet
[2:58:52] because why we want to be filled with
[2:58:54] the fullness of God I want him to have
[2:58:56] complete control I want to be completely
[2:59:00] surrendered to him
[2:59:04] whoo come on if you think about your
[2:59:07] life right now think about it
[2:59:12] God will show you
[2:59:14] but maybe not you but he does me amen
[2:59:18] I hope he does you
[2:59:22] till we come to the fullness of Christ
[2:59:25] that ye henceforth
[2:59:27] be no more children in other words come
[2:59:30] to adoption how many beliefs it's time
[2:59:33] for God's children to come tell you
[2:59:34] anymore I think God maybe that
[2:59:37] just comes to mind maybe that's where
[2:59:39] God wanted Moses to be
[2:59:43] God expected a lot out of Moses didn't
[2:59:45] he but red I mean he allowed that Red
[2:59:48] Sea to be there he allowed him to come
[2:59:49] to a trap and then when he cried he
[2:59:51] rebuked him
[2:59:53] when he cried
[2:59:55] and he rebuked him
[3:00:00] Joshua on the other hand Joshua didn't
[3:00:03] cry did he
[3:00:04] Joshua didn't cry from understanding he
[3:00:07] didn't pray
[3:00:08] he just said Son stand still Moon you
[3:00:10] stay where you're at
[3:00:13] huh how many blue
[3:00:15] leaves that if Moses wouldn't have cried
[3:00:17] and he just take the stick and he feed
[3:00:19] it said it's part
[3:00:20] no doubt God would have departed it
[3:00:23] maybe that's what God was expecting amen
[3:00:26] he certainly stopped it for Joshua isn't
[3:00:29] that right the Sun and the Moon
[3:00:31] and if God just says why do you cry this
[3:00:33] be speak to work and go forward go over
[3:00:34] there and open it up
[3:00:41] can I bring it down to where we live
[3:00:46] come on
[3:00:48] could you crying speak the word and go
[3:00:51] forward
[3:00:51] so this ain't too big however big this
[3:00:54] is it's not too big for God
[3:00:56] amen
[3:00:59] devil you just get on out of here amen
[3:01:01] you're giving you trouble amen that's
[3:01:04] right listen to no more children carried
[3:01:07] about with every wind of Doctrine by
[3:01:08] this letter side of men kind of crafting
[3:01:11] us for everybody they lie and wait to
[3:01:13] this Eve
[3:01:15] anyway
[3:01:16] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[3:01:19] up into him
[3:01:21] in some things no in all things
[3:01:25] that's why Peter said there and for a
[3:01:27] second Peter the first chapter he says
[3:01:28] if these things being you and about they
[3:01:31] make you that they're you're neither
[3:01:33] bare nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
[3:01:35] God another place it'll make you where
[3:01:37] you'll never fall if the if you have all
[3:01:39] of the things in fiddly join together
[3:01:41] and come back about every joint that it
[3:01:43] supplies according to the effects of
[3:01:45] working of the major of every part
[3:01:48] brings increase of the body
[3:01:50] to
[3:01:51] the edifying of itself in
[3:01:55] love hey man let me go a couple more
[3:01:58] I've got a couple more scriptures I'm
[3:02:00] going to cover before closing Hebrews
[3:02:02] four let's go back to the book of
[3:02:03] Hebrews
[3:02:07] foreign
[3:02:15] the same one about the high priest
[3:02:18] as this one does here
[3:02:20] to
[3:02:21] he
[3:02:22] Brews
[3:02:24] for an 11 I believe it is no that's the
[3:02:27] one I just looked at
[3:02:28] all right
[3:02:32] 4 16.
[3:02:36] let us no that's still the same one
[3:02:39] 10 and 30.
[3:02:42] all right we already read some of those
[3:02:47] Hebrews 4 and 1 though we haven't
[3:02:50] Hebrews 4 1
[3:02:52] let us therefore fear these
[3:02:57] a promise being left us
[3:03:01] of entering into his rest any of you
[3:03:05] should seem to come short of it
[3:03:08] amen front to us was the Gospel preach
[3:03:11] as well as unto them but the word being
[3:03:14] preached to profit them not being mixed
[3:03:16] with faith in them that heard it
[3:03:20] for we which have believed do enter into
[3:03:23] rest as he said I have sworn in my wrath
[3:03:25] if this shall enter into my wrath
[3:03:27] although the works were finished from
[3:03:29] the foundations of the world
[3:03:32] so here he's talking about Israel of
[3:03:34] course how did they did not enter into
[3:03:36] arrest and here it says let us be let us
[3:03:40] fear in other words
[3:03:44] don't let one promise not be fulfilled
[3:03:46] in your heart
[3:03:48] amen
[3:03:50] let it all be fulfilled in your heart so
[3:03:54] that we aren't left outside of resting
[3:03:57] in him how many wants to be in that
[3:03:59] place rest
[3:04:00] like Dan and like Daniel was he he
[3:04:02] didn't miss out anything I don't know
[3:04:03] about you but I don't want to miss any
[3:04:05] of the promise of God
[3:04:07] now how many knows that's what Israel
[3:04:08] missed they missed having faith and
[3:04:10] never did enter into God's rest because
[3:04:12] if they missed something
[3:04:14] I mean that's the same thing the foolish
[3:04:16] virgin dude they missed something they
[3:04:17] didn't have oil in their lamps
[3:04:20] young people especially let me tell you
[3:04:22] something you may have all the head
[3:04:23] knowledge but to take more on head
[3:04:25] knowledge you have to have the promise
[3:04:28] of the Holy Spirit right in here
[3:04:32] or your mommy and Daddy'll go but you
[3:04:34] won't go amen it has to be a personal
[3:04:37] relationship so Paul says here in
[3:04:39] Hebrews he says let us fear least there
[3:04:42] is a promise that just to keep that that
[3:04:44] we all have not yet entered into rest
[3:04:46] amen like Daniel like I said
[3:04:51] he was
[3:04:52] I don't know some people kind of preach
[3:04:54] in different ways but you know I just
[3:04:56] happen to believe that Daniel he wasn't
[3:04:58] scared
[3:04:59] no no he completely was resting in the
[3:05:03] fact that he was in God's care amen
[3:05:06] I don't know but he was so so much the
[3:05:08] three Hebrew children they were so brave
[3:05:10] that they said we aren't fearful of what
[3:05:14] the king says you know he may not
[3:05:16] deliver it but there's one thing we know
[3:05:18] we're not going to bow
[3:05:20] we're gonna do the right thing it was in
[3:05:23] that place now I want to tell you
[3:05:25] something I believe in this hour that
[3:05:26] you and I are living in
[3:05:28] now when I think about having entered
[3:05:31] into God's rest in the promise of his
[3:05:33] rest because that's what God wants us to
[3:05:34] be he's come completely into his rest
[3:05:37] millions of years of that God was
[3:05:40] perhaps by himself he was completely
[3:05:42] content he was he he completely he rests
[3:05:46] he was God's rest
[3:05:47] he wasn't frustrated about it everything
[3:05:49] amen
[3:05:50] we frustrate ourselves our own mind can
[3:05:52] get us frustrated and everything but the
[3:05:54] Holy Spirit brings a rest amen that no
[3:05:57] matter what it is
[3:05:59] oh if Israel could have just had it no
[3:06:01] matter what time whether they were
[3:06:02] hungry whether they were in a trap no
[3:06:04] matter if they just rested in Christ
[3:06:07] oh my
[3:06:09] God
[3:06:11] and God allowed things to come our way
[3:06:13] if you're a child of God I mean God's
[3:06:15] going to allow things to come in your
[3:06:17] way to see whether you're truly in that
[3:06:19] rest or whether you're not in that rest
[3:06:26] this this world can have all all of this
[3:06:29] glamor and all of its entertainments it
[3:06:32] can have all of that I don't need any of
[3:06:34] that
[3:06:36] I'm satisfied with what God has given me
[3:06:38] and that's the peace of God that passes
[3:06:40] understanding how many glad to have the
[3:06:43] peace of God of God that passes
[3:06:44] understanding let the peace of God the
[3:06:46] Bible says rule in your heart
[3:06:49] because if it isn't peace ruling there
[3:06:51] it's something else it's torment ruling
[3:06:54] in there if it is the rest of God
[3:06:57] resting in there people are oh my they
[3:07:00] got to have another tattoo they got to
[3:07:01] have this that or the other
[3:07:03] folks I don't need one tattoo I don't
[3:07:05] have to paint myself
[3:07:06] to make myself feel better
