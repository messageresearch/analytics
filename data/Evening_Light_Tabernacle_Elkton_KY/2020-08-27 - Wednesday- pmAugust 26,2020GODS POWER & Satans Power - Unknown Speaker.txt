the house of the lord amen god is good isn't he amen praise the lord we're just thankful for god's goodness and for his mercy to us amen and so amen and i had a at least one call today amen i know aaron he had gotten kind of a fever last week and i was a little concerned about him so i asked him just to stay home i think it was sunday but anyway so um he was or was it last wednesday it was last wednesday not sunday he was here sunday but anyway so i think some others have a few symptoms that they just want to be careful with amen and i think that's good amen so it's a good time to be careful nowadays amen but we thank the lord that there's nothing in anything major going on so amen we praise the lord for that amen let's just bow our heads and open up service and prayer kind of heavenly father we come before you lord jesus thankful lord jesus that we can once again assemble in your name lord father to be able to open your bible and to minister the word father as you laid on our heart to minister father according to the dictates of your spirit and lord we just thank you for the freedom that we have lord jesus to be able to worship you in spirit and in truth we desire lord jesus that this little thought that i feel we've laid upon my heart to speak on god we just ask god that you'd come and speak what you once said lord jesus and that you'll have your way in every heart and every life maybe go from here better people than what we have came lord we love you lord jesus we commit this service to you now in jesus name amen and amen open your bibles if you will to the book of romans i believe it is romans 12. romans 12. and verse we'll just read one for now i mean one verse out of this verse 12 chapter 12 verse 21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good amen may god has blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight lord laid a little thought on my heart to speak on and so as i begin to study and look into it and see what some of the things that brother brahm talked about it but he said he said this in the book of exodus chicago illinois illinois 1955. he says now we find out that there was three great principles that we were going to talk about or talk on and this book of exodus called out separated and also a book of redemption and the three principles he says that we was going to talk on was this is going to be our subject it's the power of the devil and the power of god amen also in between there he has and the power of faith the power of the devil the power of faith and the power of god amen so we want to just talk about that with the help of the lord for a little while amen uh this evening with his help amen brother madam he makes a statement in the greatest battle ever fought he says you know satan he says his power that he's got is a perverted power of god it's not real power it's not power amen it's just a perversion of god's power so everything that uh everything that surrounds and everything the devil has brother brown says everything that he has the only thing he has to work with is perversion is twisting something you know manipulative cunning as a matter of fact one of the devils we're going to talk about him for just a little bit but before i before i say that before i go into that one of i want to just talk about the devil's i guess two main uh it's actually there's a look there's a few more but we could mention three his three main uh powers that he has that he works with but brother batman the greatest battle ever fought he says something we've heard before but i want to say it again you know we've heard of wars and rumors of wars and if your stance will have plenty more wars but you realize that there's really only two powers in the universe all of the differences between the nations and difference between each other and everything it all amounts to two powers there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms and all the rest of these little things these minor things that are connected with either one of those powers and we'll get into some of those minor things with the help of the lord tonight we want to talk about some of those minor things what we would call minor things that's connected to these powers all right and those powers is god's power and satan's power amen every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by god's power or satan's power amen and so as i like i said i just for some reason it just was kind of laid on my heart to talk about then you know one of the main things i guess when i begin the lord begin to bring this to me was and i didn't get time today or didn't didn't get to it uh into church age book and where he talks about the satan uses diabolical power political power spiritual power uh spirit uh spiritual power like in spirituality and and so forth he has three different you know powers different powers that the devil uses and so but anyway so he says he says every little thing is either controlled by god's power or satan's power because there's only two that's the only two powers that there is amen and that is the power of life and the power of death amen now that's the only two powers but evan says there's no other powers every little detail is connected to one or the other and you know and satan can only now notice he's a perverter of god's power it's not real power it's a perverted power of god everything that satan hath death is only now he mentions death is only a perverted life a lie is only the truth missed told amen that's some of the things i want to start with adult is a actual correct act misused a righteous act misused everything that satan's got is something that was perverted but it's a power that's all the devil has to work with that's the only power that he has amen he has he doesn't now let me just bring this in how many knows it god's power what is god's power there's only you know there's one power satan can intimidate or not intimidate but impersonate almost anything is that right you can impersonate almost anything but the one statement that brother bannon made about about this the devil is that one power that he doesn't have what's what yeah your mic is still on by the way brother david very good yeah creative power amen it's creative god has creative power amen you might want to leave that on i need a lot of amen tonight oh yeah yeah y'all need to that was just the least of it amen praise the lord so create i mean that's the good part about god is that he's a god that his power can actually create amen that's real power is to be able to create something out of nothing amen something out of nothing praise the lord so he says one more statement here i want to make on this quote everything is satan's god is something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here and wanna one or the other power is going to control us amen can i rephrase that just a little bit let me rephrase that just a little bit and that is he says and one of those powers is going to control us i'm going to say that one of those powers is controlling us amen presently you're either controlled by one of those power or the other as you're sitting there as you're listening right now you're controlled by either satan's power god problem and if you just remember this no matter how much you say if you haven't got the holy ghost and if you're not controlled by god's power even your thinking is not right am i right even the way that you think in the way that you look at things it's not going to be correct because you can only think right amen you can only react right if you have god's power in you that's the truth you're going to think the wrong thoughts you're going to be negative you're going to be you know you're going to be doubtful you're going to be unbelieving you know if you're controlled by the devil's power amen so now how many knows that there was a time for 4 000 years for 4 000 years sure men were temporarily anointed by god's spirit isn't that right sure david was temporarily anointed samson was temporarily anointed the spirit would come upon him bible said right and he'd slay a thousand philistines and so forth but when it's all said and done even samson would go back to the wrong actions he would go back to his carnal nature and that right he lead to delilah david as holy and as a good a man as he was he still had a beth sheba an affair not right he was still a murderer and also you know he he just didn't have what it took to overcome that right that's why we started with that that scripture that talks about you know we're supposed to overcome evil be not overcome by evil but overcome evil and for thou 4 000 years humanity couldn't truly experience the power of god they didn't know what it was really all about what it really was to have the power of god because we know as the prophet of god said you know that it is very evident without question that the power is not just immensely not enormously not greatly but unspeakably unfathomably greater and more powerful than the power of satan it's not even the same running is that right why because oh my i mean you know sometimes satan well he just looks kind of foolish all right because you would think that he would know that he's never going to outdo god right but remember pharaoh the devil was in pharaoh to kill all of those babies because the king was gonna deliver was supposed to be war he thought he could wipe them out when the israelites talk about you know where is he that is born king of the jews well herod and them went kill all them baby trying to wipe them out come on people we all know that no matter what you do devil i'm sure the devil knows it but i don't know why it keeps trying but he does amen the devil is more of a go-getter sometimes than we are he knows he's defeated but he still don't quit you know a lot of times a christian man will act like we're defeated but we don't want to quit because we want to win but the devil he knows he's defeated and he keeps trying amen and so you know he he he's got to realize he's got to know that god is more powerful than he is and that he's going to have an angel tell joseph look just take mary and go over to bethlehem and go over to here you know right you know so that he doesn't get caught in it doesn't take a whole lot god just maneuvers around it because god's power is so much greater than the devil's power it doesn't matter on what level or what you're talking about whatever the devil offers whatever the devil comes up against you know and i believe there's a scripture says that no weapon formed against thee shall stand no matter what the devil brings against you there is a power greater than whatever it is that he brings against you amen so man was without this power man did without this power sure god would display himself and he would use deliverers and so forth but man in general and even though great people ended up amen not having what it took in here to possess the power of god at all times now we find that in the book of acts that he had told them to wait up in the upper room until you are but wait for the promise of the father you know he says for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days since and notice and he said unto them it is not for you to know of the times and the seasons which the father has put in his own power but he shall receive power but you shall receive power another i may know that after jesus died after he paid the price after he ascended and so forth and be just before he ascended i believe he told them to go to jerusalem go in there and wait wait there for the promise to be made manifest to you it's because something's got to happen just a death just a burial just a resurrection isn't enough amen we now want to reap the benefits of all of that by receiving the power receiving the holy ghost receiving what he died for ain't no no sense in buying something if you don't claim it if you don't purchase it if you don't use it and that's the way it was on the day of pentecost he says look i'm gonna you're gonna be endued with power from on praise the lord aren't you glad for that so it came to a place where god amen said look i'm gonna give you you're gonna have power amen the power of the holy ghost amen let me see here over in the book of saint john the first chapter verse 11 it says he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power power to what to become sons of god amen praise the lord i don't know i shouldn't go on a presumptuous preaching here but you know you know it is that this time that they can truly be called the sons of god amen in the image of god because in the old testament that didn't look a whole lot like a son of god the things that david did he was but listen he had gave him the power to become sons of god and to look like god to act like god to be in the image of god amen he gave him power to act like god to be in his image to be an amateur god amen amen how many knows one of the weapons one of the chief weapons that the devil has to use in a man is his mind he got to figure it out and you better figure this out you better you know reason isn't it reasonable he uses his head the devil does but god what where does he use he uses the heart why because the heart trusts and have faith in god and it's operated by something more than what you can figure out huh or that you can make happen by your mind but that's all the devil has he devil uses a man said god uses a man's heart because that's where the dwelling place of god is amen as long as god's not in there how many knows evil is going to be in there that's right evil is going to be in there as long as god isn't on the throne room of everybody's heart he gave him power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name praise be to god amen now we all know that man is controlled by only two things one or the other and that is faith or doubt and that right if you are controlled by faith you're going to be controlled by creative power you're going to be controlled by everything that's good but if you are controlled and if you are operated by unbelief remember satan is your god satan is your ruler and he will take you to the pit of death everything that is evil everything that is terrible huh is what she's going to govern it's going to control you if you allow doubt to govern you amen i like that song that y'all saying we're living by faith i mean believe we're living by faith and i feel no alarm amen let's look at a couple things come with those small details the probably god talked about amen one of them is satan and i picked this back ups three things i mentioned to you one of them amen is satan under his power amen one of the great powers that he uses is deception all right one of his main powers is deception okay deception is something that looks like something that it is but it's not it's deceiving it's not what it claims to be it's not what it really is acting like that's why it comes as an angel of light and the scripture that comes to my mind is over in revelation where it talks about he deceiveth the whole world is that right amen he deceives all whose names are not written in the lamb of book of life amen he receives all he's a he's a shrewd deceiver amen because deception is the perversion of truth is that right deception is the perversion of truth that's exactly what he did in the garden of eden with eve he took the truth and perverted it and he deceived eve by adding one word huh he said you shall you're going to be like gods you're going to be like god you're going to be godly you're going to be like god and you're going to know good and evil god knows that you don't know good and evil right now but if you take up this fruit you're going to know good and evil and guess what you're not really going to die huh all he changed was one word he's the master of deception that's one of his main tools is deception and believe me i truly believe this and that is that there's going to be more people go to hell that are deceived and thought they were writing work then it is just a common sinner out there knows where he's going huh i know that's a strong statement but i believe it because most people are religious look at the religious world out there i mean it's bright something to be able to drive by the baptist methodist amish mennonite all these churches that you're going to go by when i drive by those churches and i see it maybe if the parking lot full i realize what god said about him that they're dead huh how many know they're dead even pentecostal huh but iran says even the pentecostals are dead they're dead they're spiritually dead they're still going to church they're they're still worshipping they still claim to worship god but they're dead why because just like jesus came and they rejected him crucified him isn't that right didn't barely even know he was here brother brown says now watch out in the angelus temple in in in laws in los angeles and california he says you know the same thing could happen and it did isn't that right jesus came and they crucified him the second time they got indicted for they were guilty of the second crucifixion kicked him out of the doors and didn't even know it blind deceived huh amen lord help us lord don't let me be deceived show me my faults show me where i am lord keep me alive in you why because there's a lot more people that are a lot of people dead and don't know it deceive deception of course the second one of the main things brother branham said amen that the devil uses was reasoning isn't that right one of his main tactics is reasoning he gets people to reason with their mind contrary to the word of god amen brother madam realized and i believe it was um uh well i don't know if i can think of it but uh he he made a challenge faith he's either faith or reasoning forget the title of the message but anyway so reasoning is one of his wayne weapons but i want to not so much talk about reasoning tonight as i want to talk about the opposite of god's number one weapon all right or power god's number one power the main thing that god uses to defeat the devil with all right one of his main weapons because even faith it's it's it's one of the main weapon but it's not the main weapon because the bible says that even if even faith is governed by something there's a governor to your faith because key people can have faith to move mountains isn't that right paul said but if i don't have love i'm still nothing amen so that love is the number one weapon that god uses in his economy and that's what he defeated the devil with on calvary for god so the world that he gave his only begotten son and overcome why it was love that drove him i want you to know something that you're not going to have any oh my listen to me if you don't have that number one weapon of love in your heart remember every other evil thing can creep in but you have got to keep that number one thing in there why do you think mother brahman says when you when you come beyond the curtain of time i don't get what you're doing how many religious demonstrations okay how much mission everywhere i don't care about any of this you make sure you have that one thing is that right and that is perfect love y'all remember the story of the pentecostal man that came to brother benham says brother baby i need you to help me out pray for me here because i got saved but my wife ain't saved and i'll tell you what she's got a devil on her and i pray for her and i'm trying to cast the devil out of her huh that right what was it he said buy her some flowers or some candy can you imagine that man here i've been praying i've been having faith in god hallelujah my wife is going to get big that we're going to get rid of that unbelieving devil huh well i'm not so sure honey that your religion is right you know this idea i'll tell you right now you need a conversion you know you got the devil on you huh well honey i don't know for sure why but i just don't know well i'll get that done doubting spirit off of you and that right got all dogmatic about it probably brother bam says to go buy some candy or some flowers isn't that right show her what that's right amen if i'm not wrong he went and did that and he transformed his life transformed his marriage why because he used the right weapon amen that's our most powerful weapon i want to you know i want i want us to know tonight i want the people out there on radio land to know that if a church of evening like that if we don't love each other we ain't got nothing if we don't care about each other we ain't got nothing we wouldn't go out of our way for each other we ain't got nothing we ain't a church like we ought to be amen how many believes we need more of the love of god in our heart so the opposite of god's great weapon is what that's correct sister becky you got it right on the hit the nail right on the head hey that's right now we could go into the church age book we could tell you how what brother bannon said how that you have no idea all right you just don't realize how much the devil operates and those that are possessed with his spirit operate by hate all right a hatred satan has a real hatred for christians amen that's right he has a real hatred for a real christian and he is driven by the hatred let me tell you something that's why 68 million christians went to the slaughter can you imagine how much blood that is because satan hates because he doesn't have the love of god and one of his main weapons one of the main tools and one of the main powers of the devil is the power of hate amen satan hates god he hates him and he hates his people there's a disdain so much until he wouldn't hesitate to kill us he didn't back then hello people today devil possess wouldn't hesitate to kill god's people amen sure wouldn't all right we find picking back up and we'll talk maybe pick up hate for just a minute but let's go back here to the garden of eden how many knows that one of the first things that adam and eve lost after the fall was love they lost love now how many knows that the minute you get away from god the demented the holy spirit leave your heart all right love goes out with it the holy spirit is love the bible says god is love he that says that he knows god and doesn't have love is a liar you can't know god and not have love in your heart you can't have god and not have love in your heart the bible says because god is love that is god god is love so adam and eve one of the first thing the reason i know this and the reason i pick love even though it doesn't say that but i looked at adam and eve that when god come walking through like he normally did and they were hey father i'll tell you what this planet you made this eaten you made it so awesome we have so enjoyed our day huh but instead of going and greeting them they went and found a big leaf behind the high behind they went in here because they were what afraid they were afraid and what brings fear a lack of love because remember the bible says to saint john there he says perfect love casts out fear it casts it out and so they must have lost their love because fear set in amen when a person is deceived when the person is not right with god the other thing that sets in is condemnation condemnation how many knows what condemnation is it's where god condemns you and you feel condemned and you're not worthy you're not fit you're not fit to look at god you're not fit to talk to god amen you know in the lord i was just thinking about this today and i thought lord of all of our failures and all the things we do wrong sometimes we are so hard on ourselves that hey we think god ain't never going to forgive me god is never going to forgive me for this huh because i've done it 20 times now huh god ain't going to forget me the devil wants you to believe that god will never forgive you because if you'll ever believe that you're done he's got you you'll give up go out in the world yeah i've dealt with an adult won't mention his name but i've dealt with somebody that just thought they had done too much they just didn't know whether god would ever forgive him for what they had done but then this thought came to my mind and you judge whether it was the holy ghost bringing the thought to my mind or not but the thought came is that god asks you and me that if somebody comes and he does is wrong right 490 times in one day he asks us to do that and we know god is created and we are amen and that thought came and said lord our our lord and then like also thought of how that you know a lot of times maybe in schools and everything they'll give you so many chances you got three times you can take this test to try to drive this car right or we won't give you a license you got three times then you'll have to wait six months huh what if god was like that with us huh man god he god wants everybody to make it it's all i can figure out he is so forgiving he is so if we're just willing to repent we say god help me god help me hello i'm every time you fail every time you genuinely repent i believe god's going to forgive you it has to be genuine you know right but i thought about that i said satan's power sometimes to people is to make him believe god won't forgive them they have a guilty conscience and you should be guilty you should feel like adam and eve did condemned amen that you had a had a you know you was guilty because you had done something wrong but that's something else that that they had i just thought lord help us to realize and i thank god for that aren't you glad that god forgives you for your failed faults and failures amen what about if you drive home tonight and you go a little over the speed limit you were like you're worthy of death for that it's a sin brother bam said that's what he's had amen that goes for me it goes for everybody because i have a lead foot myself i just confess it i say lord help me i'm working on it how about you but anyway so you think about how god is how wonderful he is how forgiving he is so maybe somebody out there maybe somebody needed that to realize hey god is more forgiving than what you realize and i'll tell you this right now if god ever cut you off you ain't got a chance in the world if he ever doesn't if he ever if you ever cross the line and i believe you can i believe you can't cross the line but that's god is a judge of that and if you ever do i mean you'll be done just like that girl that deacon's father if you remember that rejected the holy spirit calling i mean god called her for that amen because he was directly speaking to her amen and she refused it and she could watch her soul fry in hell and laugh about it not have any feelings whatsoever i mean it's the holy ghost and love it actually gives you feelings i i want to play that tape again on the way back from north carolina on the way there and all the way back it was a wonderful time just to listen to tape after tape after tape but if i have talked about one place you all remember brother bam said he said you know you can talk to a person five minutes you can tell whether they got the holy ghost or not he says you can walk in a church and you can tell the atmosphere you can tell what that church is all about let a preacher come behind his pulpit and be here just a little while and he can tell what kind of church we are a minister can that's what the prophet god said i believe it because why the holy spirit is sensitive why do you think amens means something to him hallelujahs and rejoicing you know that's what creates that atmosphere the welcoming of the holy spirit welcoming god god actually inhabits the praise of his people a lot of times god don't come because nobody's praising him nobody's giving him honor and glory nobody's saying hallelujah huh nobody's pulling god just don't come because he only comes where he's wanted where it's needed amen the power of love and the power of hate amen that's the two main weapons that is the two main driving powers of the two powers god's power is the power of love satan's power is the power of hate amen because how many knows hate is very powerful amen hate and jealousy jealousy malice bitterness variance emulation wrath strife envying being around me and one remember that is nothing but the poison assets the flour so to speak that is poisoning poisonous that comes from satan's lips how is it the prophet of god said a church you know when you've got contention and strife and envying he's got the poison he said the poison the hazards of malice and strife and variants and so forth he says that's the very poisons of hell everything that's evil amen that's why paul it just comes to mind can i quickly just read this while i'm under thought that's why paul said be ye there for followers of god as dear children this is ephesians 5. as dear children walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god a sweet smelling savor what did brother adam say was uh one of the perversions of the devil between a man and a woman amen he says it's everything is fine but the if you do it in the wrong way it's fornication it's evil it's perversion god will condemn you for it paul says but fornication and all uncleanness remember this also can be spiritual fornication all uncleanness covetousness let it not be once named among you as become a saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but they're rather the giving of things for this you know that no whoremonger no unclean person or nor covetous man which is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of god of christ and of god let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them amen praise the lord so sin is a perversion of righteousness how many knows that's what happened in the garden of eden he caused her to disbelieve the word of god amen sin is a perversion of righteousness and it brings fear fear causes you to not have any confidence how many knows that you know many times growing up as a teenager and so forth a lot of times you have confidence problems inferior inferiority if i can say it right complexes i get furious this but you know it's wonderful when you get to the place that you are confident did you have confidence amen how many believes the holy ghost gives you confidence fear brings all kinds of things to probably god's head didn't he even say that job feared that these things were going to happen and he says because he feared they did i believe he's one of our great forefathers that said that the only thing that we have to fear is fear itself you know don't fear i'm telling you right now uh japan there was something to fear hitler was something to fear but we had to overcome our fear amen so you have to overcome fear brother madam even said you know you find out you got cancer this out of the other don't fear don't get distressed it only get worse but if you can just relax committed to god amen so what is sorrow sorrow is a perversion of joy is that right sickness is a perversion of health oh my oh my so let's stop there for a minute sickness is a perversion of health i was reading a quote i may have it in here i'm not sure but he talks let me just read it right here it is they seen your spirit work down through this last week lord seeing the secrets of the heart told diseases of their body and seeing the power of the devil he was talking about a lady one time he was saying that you're going to go completely blind the doctor says that there's something in your eye and the nerve and it's messing with that nerve and it's getting worse and worse worse until you're going to come be completely blind but ivan says that's a demon that's a devil in there it wasn't there one time it's not down here not only but it's right there and that devil he will absolutely make you completely blind if god don't come and do something the power of the devil is what brings any kind of disease or sickness that we have isn't that right how many knows it's the power of almighty god that takes that away and let me tell you something the fact that the eyes of the blind can come open the fact that you can be healed it proves that there's a body somewhere that's perfect that never does need any healing how many know it's the earnest of the resurrection healing is amen that's why when you seen on this hour how did god healed and healed and healed amen he says that's the earnest of the right it shows that there's a resurrect [Music] praise be to god amen even abraham and sarah 90 something years old 99 and 75 and they had a baby 99 and we know that they were both they even said they were past having pleasure with their husband and so forth they were past that time amen many years passed the prophet took a prophet to see that their bodies were actually changed back and brother baby said what he did for them he'll do for us someday now i mean those are our 58 year old body it has to be changed back to a 20 year old god took god is a creator god he's so much more powerful than the devil and god take the atoms of abraham he took the atoms of sarah and he turned him back young again if god can do that he can call to the grave and he can say bones and skin change in the moment and the twinkling of an eye come up a glorified body change right there and it'll come forth huh it won't come back old carnal dead's body no it'll come by to glorify god it proves the resurrection it proves there is a perfect body every time you hear that prophecy every time you hear god saying you're healed lady amen every time you hear people say come up off of that oh look there he is he's getting up he's walking it ought to excite everybody to the utmost because not so much just because of that but because we serve a god that can change it back to the way that it was amen how many is looking forward to that that's what we're all looking forward to this chaos and nightmare out there in this world am i right forgot to come and change these vile bodies amen change the atoms god comes to change us and satan comes to give us issues amen y'all remember the battle that that woman had the doctors and everything trying to cure that blood issue she had in the bible is that right she had a blood issue folks i'm here to tell you that will give people issues have you ever heard that that's about somebody boy that person's got issues man well that's the way that humanity is man and humanity has given us issues but god comes to fix those issues the holy spirit is here to fix any issue that you have if you have faith in almighty god praise the lord faith is the only thing that'll do it having the love of god and having the faith of god operating that's why he said the truth he's gonna the key is gonna be if thou canst believe not unbelief but if i can't believe all things are possible that woman man i'll tell you what she believed that if i could just touch the helm of his garment i'll be made oh and she just touched the hem of his garment and every wrong cell in her blood every demon in there everything was thrown out it was all cast out she was healed instantly and her implant is you stopped people would have stopped having issues if they would just touch the hem of the master fury issues hate issues emulation news wrath's issues huh all those things have come from the devil praise the lord oh my seeing what the power of the devil has done to him make the blind to see the deaf to hear the cripples that's laying bound up in under arthritis he's just laying on cots and stretches they get up and they walk away oh my oh god till tonight there's not even one of the cases in the building i thank thee lord for thy power and now i pray as we are the living church tonight challenge the devil will not let any hebite canaanite or anything else stand in our way we're going forward in faith tonight believe in god's word and the angel of god is here to lead us amen and now satan you cruel ungodly spirit come out of the people in the name of jesus christ amen have faith keep believing keep shut in with god anyone that are strong tonight shut in with god in a secret place keep shut in with god now keep believing keep believing he's right by your side the holy spirit is hanging right there by you right now praise the lord the first one of you that believes that you're healed stand to your feet and say praise be to god how many believes is that simple he wants your healing to stand up and say i'm healed praise be to god but the man says there's one there's another one there's another one that's right stand up and praise god why because the devil doesn't have a right on you that you're supposed to have power over the devil power over sickness he shall land on the sick and he shall recover brother brown says you know when the weakest christian the weakest christian amen has every devil under the soul of their feet many believes that he's supposed to be under our feet in other words all of these things you talk about all of these things attributes of unbelief she should be under our feet we should be overcome we should overcome them we're supposed to be on top of it amen i believe there's a saying that goes that's beneath you right that's beneath you brother that's beneath you sister well the devil is supposed to be beneath us all the things that we just read so forth all those things should be beneath us underneath us we're on top because remember we were captive satan held us by his power for four thousand years he held us by his power but the bible says in ephesians four he says when he ascended on high he led captivity captive [Laughter] come on folks hallelujah he all the gloom gets to go all the sorrow has to go what we don't have to have sorrow anymore god because we've got joy we don't have to deal with the perverted anymore we've got the real one joy is more powerful than sorrow amen god is good eddie all right praise the lord the holy spirit is right there amen to help us so what happened on calvary is when he grip just taken away the power of satan let me release calvary robbed the devil it stripped the devil of his power but the man makes a statement he says satan don't have one right for nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had at calvary when jesus taken the sinner's place and died at calvary satan has no legal rights over nothing no more hallelujah but everything lays in the hands of the church and the believer that's right satan lost he's nothing but of love even death itself we're taught amen that has to bee loses his singers after having been stung amen it can't sting anymore it's lost his finger now how many knows we still die short but it's taken out the sting of it why because even brother bannon makes a statement about amen when you come down to that death when you come down to that grave and he said we might weep over our loved one as i did my wife brother madam said and so forth but that's when faith kicks in and then we know that we're gonna see him on the other side we don't sorrow as others we have no hope because even in death itself even it is defeated death itself is defeated how happy we ought to be tonight praise the lord listen god gives credit he give a real man of god gives credit to god and the truth of god's word and that at calvary the emancipation of proclamation was signed by the blood of jesus and everything that satan never did to you he was stripped of every power he had at calvary praise the lord how many believes that satan really is powerless in front of the holy spirit boy it's hard for us to believe that but it's the truth oh my i don't know if i should say it but i'm here to tell you i have seen the power of god defeat satan inaudible amount of times in my life i've seen i've seen god do it he's defeated him i've watched him defeat the devil many many times amen i'm sure you have to amen i know it's time to close but i'm just getting started praise the lord well not really amen i don't want to get started let the holy spirit just have his way in there right so not oldest every party i don't cover and we ought to tonight as his servants we stand to serve the public in the name of the lord jesus claiming to the people that the work has been finished and will be granted to whosoever will according to their faith that's what we're proclaiming devil only has what you give him he can only have what you give him he has to come hey can i have this can i have that can i have your joy can i have your peace huh you have to say yeah you can have it huh and he'll offer how many knows that one power one more power i'd like to talk to you about and that is the offerings of satan satan offers he offers you all kinds of things and i believe brother brown says if he can't uh get you to be out there a drunkard and a druggie and all a whoremonger and all of that he says he'll offer you to come to church he'll maybe perhaps make law for your deacon job or uh i don't know district presbyter or somebody in the church you can have maybe a sunday school for a sister or this that or the other and and you know be in a place where you can really be some do something for the lord he'll offer you all of that as long as he's just not born again all right he'll make you all kinds of offers he has all kinds of things he offers to try to actually make you think that you are right just like like but bam he says you know those women in that hotel they were drinking and so forth he said we're just having some clean fun huh that isn't clean fun he says whoopi this is life but abram said no it's not life it's death he makes people think that they're living when they're not when it's actually death amen let me just read this can i there's so many entertainments without money without price people spending money on all kinds of entertainments brother brandon was talking about amen and so forth he says when the holy spirit wants to give you all these things free of charge entertainments nowadays really cost you money go to disney world or any place like that amusement parks you better take a wall up full of money you're gonna have a lot you can walk out of there with a lot less of your cash you're gonna cost you people don't mind spending money bunching their money for entertainment but they sure won't want something that's free but it's much better and that's real there's so many entertaining things of our days there's so much to entice people that would be called pleasures and it's for all peoples and all ages and so forth there are the enticements for the young people the modern dancers and so forth rock and roll music and so forth it goes with it it's all enticement for entertainment and i don't care how good a home a child has been brought up in or how it's been taught to do right if that child hasn't accepted the experience of the new birth rock and roll music catches his attention as quick as he hears it because in him is born in nature a carnal spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches that spirit of that little one huh is that right and how much more will it do to the old them that has rejected the new birth because only as your life is changed and you've been converted and born anew into the kingdom of god your nature will still be of the things of the world how many knows it you can hear up here preacher doesn't matter what it is you can hear you don't want to do this you don't want to do that but until your nature's changed until that desire is taken out that right you're still going to desire it it's going to be there you could worship and be religious but still that will have some kind of a drawing power to you because the old man of sin and his desires is not dead in you yet but once let christ take the throne in your heart and those things don't bother him it's so much greater amen how many is all the things that god is so much greater oh my i cannot mention closing with a story i cannot mention the man's name because i can't think of his name right now but many of you will remember him they say that there was an island where that men would go in ambush they would wait in the ambush and their women would come out singing and their songs were so tantalizing that the soldiers passing by and the ships would come in and then the ambush soldiers which catch those which catch those sailors off guard and slam and a certain great man wanted to pass by and he had his sailors to tie him up to a mass pole and put something in his mouth so that he could not scream and put plugs in the sailor's ear so that he could not hear the sailboat and sail by to hear it and the women came out dancing and screaming and singing and oh it was so great till he turned to hide on his wrist screaming to his sailors turn in and turn in but they couldn't hear him they had plugs in their ears and then he uh sailed to a certain place where they was to unmask his or untie his hands and he was to take the plugs from his ears and there when walking on down the street he heard a musician that was so far supreme to that down there that when he passed by again they said o great rover shall we tie it to the mass pole again he said no just let me lose i have heard something so much greater till that'll never bother me no more that's the way it is with the born-again christian they found something so much greater than rock and roll and entertainments of this world they are entertained by the holy spirit and it's so much greater till the world is dead to them amen how many believe that all the things of satan everything amen a tries to offer it should all be dead to us because we found something so much greater amen god bless you tonight stand with me if you win musicians if you'll come amen that's just our heads whether here or out there i wonder how many would be honest and would say brother byler i really want more of the power of god in my life i want more of the love of jesus in my soul i'm more of his faith more of his joy more of his peace more of his long suffering and gentleness meekness instead of pride god bless you god bless you lord jesus i've got my hand raised lord jesus i'm always wanting more we're always wanting more of you like the song says more of you more of you i've had it all but what i need is more of you we ask god that lord you would just saturate every heart and every hand right now so much of the with the holy spirit father until it would drown everything negative anything of satan's power just crush it completely out of our life lord until in our bosom and in our hearts father there would be a real hunger and a thirst there would be a real satisfaction in our souls father with the baptism of the holy ghost amen with the power of god in our life lord jesus to be sons and daughters of god to live for you lord jesus to let you have control of our hearts father in our lives lord take every heart now you know every hand lord and how much more they need of you father and i pray god that you will grant them lord jesus a real filling of your spirit and of your power that would overcome all of the power that satan has and lord jesus that that the peace of god would rule and reign in every heart father that lord not fear but love would saturate every heart lord confidence would saturate every soul faith lord jesus in you for every circumstance would destroy all the fiery darts of the wicked that he throws at us all the enticements and every arrow he throws at us would be thwarted by the shield of faith tonight we ask god help us lord to be strong in the lord and in the power of his might father bless each and every one father under the sound of my voice lord jesus tonight lord with the presence of the holy spirit now in their souls may you change them god and take all the wrong desires so far away that when they hear them lord there is no pull there anymore let it be father for we ask in jesus name amen and amen you love the lord god bless you
