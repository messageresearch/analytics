obedient when the when the you have a call and a feeling on you and something's pressing on you but sometimes we we neglect that and uh and the Lord blessed us tonight by giving us another chance so we appreciate that and brother Josh thank you for your practice and effort sister Becky sister Leo we appreciate that so we do want to speak tonight if we could take a look at part two uh on let the worshipers arise if you're turning your Bibles to Matthew chapter 2. all right I'll tell you there's really just no stopping point when you look at the worship and how to how you worship God and and how he's worthy of our worship and the types of worship and it just goes on and on and on and the Book of Matthew relays that to us probably as well as any book in the Bible and and if you look there's several places where people fell down and worshiped Jesus and and they they crawled to Jesus and and they laid down and they worship and it was a constant worship and he was answering their answering their needs not because they were begging not because they were praying but because they were just simply worshiping who he was and recognizing who he was Matthew chapter 2 we talked a little bit last week in the book of Acts about manaean and how he was brought up with King Herod and so we're going to look a little bit at King Herod for a little while tonight as well Matthew chapter 2. now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and we are come to worship Him and when Harry the king had heard these things he was troubled in all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes and the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea and thus it is written by the prophets and that and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of these shall come a governor that shall what's it say rule My People Israel then Herod when he had probably called the wise man inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared so now he's getting a little bit curious so King Herod he's he's starting to get a little curiosity sparking in him now the talks going around town and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also what about that Satan had his old tactics lying just like he did in the beginning saying he wants this child so that he can come and worship him when all along he's nothing but a murderer and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy can you imagine these Magis these three wise men as they see this story and it's standing over there and they they see this star and they begin to say there it is there's what we've been looking for all these years we knew it was a sign to come we knew that there was going to be a sign in the sky and now here it is praise the Lord and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh and when you look at that word fell down it means falling down and one translation says is they prostrated themselves meaning that they laid themselves down flat face down on the ground and and to show reverence and to show uh a submission these three wise men come and fall down face first before this child and submitting themselves to him and say we've been looking for the king of the Jews the star has shown and here you are and then another translation says they paid homage to him and when you look at that word homage it means to show special honor and respect shown publicly oh how many times we hide away our worship and our praise amen let's pray Heavenly Father we're just thankful Lord to be in your house once again and we just want to take this time and this opportunity to focus once again on you father and and to worship you and to lift you up and to see how we as your children and the Bride of Jesus Christ can give more of ourselves to you and take more of the emphasis off of us because if we lift you up you're constantly rewarding your bride Lord and Lord we just want to be we just want to be diligently in serving you we want to be faithful and worshiping you and lifting you up and giving you praise Lord and so we ask that you minister to our hearts tonight and lead us in that way we love you we appreciate you in Christ's name amen you can be seated so just to lay a little bit of background I'm going to try not to hold you as long tonight but to lay a background we look over here in the east and anytime you would go before someone of royalty or someone of importance and and you would take with you gifts and so here are these three wise men believing that this young child is going to be the king of the Jews it's not surprising that they bring lavish gifts and lay before him and the idea and the fact is that these three wise men brain gold frankincense and myrrh go when we see represents royalty frankincense or the incense is Divinity and then when you look at myrrh it means death now did the Magis know did they realize exactly what they were bringing but when we look at this we see now that we have a royal king of divine nature who will die for his people that's the gifts that they bring to worship and lay down at his feet now they were unaware of that but they had one thing on their mind I want to honor the king of Jews and I want you to understand I want you to notice that they presented the gifts to them to him it says they presented the gifts to him meaning Jesus this child and bring gifts and give to Mary they didn't bring gifts and gifts to Joseph they didn't they didn't bring gifts and give to all the people around no but many times we find that we give our gifts we give our talents to the things around us to the things of the world to the to the activities that take place around us and we give and give and give until we don't have time to give to God but these magi's coming so we're going to give you all that we got we're going to give you the gifts that we have to bring somebody once told me when I was thinking about this scripture ever come in my memory but somebody once told me when you say yes to one thing to one person you're saying no to another think about that the world people around you uh the things that you're involved in they will pull at you and pull at you and pull at you to all the effort that you've got you can pour into things that really doesn't matter and you're saying yes to those things but on the flip side you're actually saying no to God are you with me it says they fell down and worshiped him more important than the gifts that they bring was the fact that they worshiped Jesus and this must have been an amazing sight for Joseph and Mary to be sitting there and all of a sudden these three dignitaries come rolling up in fine Cadillacs this was a cattle train and they come rolling up there in a special way and now as soon as they see the Christ they bow down and fall at his feet can you imagine the thought going to Joseph and Mary's mind no doubt Mary has a remembrance of Her Mind of a Time past when she was visited by an Angel and the angel told her you're a virgin you shall conceive so Mary know who she was now she's beginning to see who he is because these my jobs have come and said we have seen in the skies we've seen in the stars that the king of the Jews has been born somebody's got to worship Him we sing that song Mary Did You Know she knew who she was now she sees the revelation of who he is and we look on one hand here it he displays an open and hatred and hostility from the very sound of Jesus's birth he's angry about this the chief priests and the scribes they're indifferent towards Jesus but these wise men seek out Jesus to worship Him this come at a great cost because they come at a great cause because they had realized if you look at the scripture they had kind of shunned away from what Herod was asking him to do come and tell us no I don't know we don't think you have the best of intentions here we're going to go worshiping you say you want to worship him but all you want to do is destroy him so they kind of shied away so now they're kind of wanted by Herod No Doubt and the wisdom that we can learn from these wise men his brothers and sisters that we're not satisfied at just looking at a star we're not satisfied at just looking at something shiny they saw the star and they done something about it they put themselves into action we determined last week that if you're going to worship God you have to have action involved so they fell down they prostrated themselves before the Lord they began to sing praises before the Lord we have to find ourselves actively worshiping God it's more than just sitting on a Pew like a nominal law it's more than just going through your day-to-day life but it's giving and giving and giving and giving I don't mean him giving to you I mean you giving to him that's where our worship is they rejoiced at this star and they arrived at this destination after they've been persevering for two years you know we want to think in the world also think and we know different Scholars no different the prophet told us different this was not an infant Jesus was a two-year-old 18 months a two-year-old child these Magi saw the star in the sky for two years they persevered and they traveled they went through the desert and and and had to put up with mocking and ridicule no doubt they went through little towns and little cities and they said what are you guys doing where are you going we're going to worship the king of the Jews are you talking about yeah there's a star in the sky do you see that star there's nothing in the sky no different Prophet said only imagine could see it but they said we're following the star there's no are you guys are crazy and they see this star and it leads them up there and they they begin to get there and they entered into worship and there's an urgency about their business it doesn't say they linger around they socialize for a while they introduce themselves told where they were from it doesn't say that it says they fell down many times we have a hard time persevering from Sunday to Sunday these guys are persevering for two years and then they fall down we say well we just can't get entered into Worship in the church we just don't sing long enough we don't we don't have that kind of music we don't have this we're not willing to put forth we're not willing to get in there and fall down into the worship that God is asking us to do and when they worshiped it was to give something it wasn't some kind of empty-handed adoration just saying oh well this is this is the Lord they've been you know it's been prophesied it's been said here he is it wasn't that kind of worship at all it was heartfelt it was heartfelt it hadn't meaning there was something about it that they they were so dedicated as they fall down and said I'm going to praise God and that's our attitude we have to have we got to praise God if we feel like God's against us we see this pattern over and over and we see the pattern that those who look Upon Jesus will see him those who truly see him will worship Him and those who worship Him will consecrate their substance to him think about that as we read this scripture here in Matthew 2 looking at the birth of our Lord and savior I want you to pay special attention to the two contrasts of the Kings because brothers and sisters in the very beginning of time there's always been a contrast of Kings there's been a war between the Throne of God and the seed of Satan the Throne of God and the seed of Satan so here we see the contrast between Herod and Jesus Jesus is a newborn king so what is the question here the question here to Herod in his mind is kingship kingship and when the wise men came into the court of King Herod the first thing they said is the king of the Jews has been born and you look in your scripture King has a capital K and every time they address King Herod it's a little K how be little in this must have been to a King like Herod and his birth of Jesus and the arrival on his wise man Jesus is immediately identified as what a ruler they said he would rule his people and they never do announce it as a ruler he's a little K A little King and this kingship of Herod is Harsh think about the contrast this is a harsh harsh thing Herod is a tyrant let me tell you the life of a sinner is Harsh the life the way of a sinner is Harsh and Herod here is telling us that the Bible's telling us he is a tyrant and his tyrannical rule is characterized by an all-consuming desire to preserve his own status okay he's selfish Herod finds himself in a selfish condition that he wants his power He Wants to Rule and he wants to Reign and he will stop at nothing including murdering the innocent lives of every child under two years of age all right so as Christians we can look at this and we can look at Herod and say we don't want to be like a Herod there's nothing in me that wants to be like a Herod that I'm all consumed about myself because all he wanted to do was emphasize his life his way his living we put the emphasis on Christ listen to what Augustus the Roman Emperor said about Herod he said it was safer to be herod's Pig than herod's son how would you like that to be your daddy it was safer to be herod's Pig than to be herod's son so here is the king of dominance an authority a man who is who is overseeing a kingdom through a tyrannical rule of murder and violence to get what he wants and now all of a sudden the heavens begin to declare and nature begins to say there is a new kingship there's something happening the very stars and the sky are proclaiming and shouting to the entire world that we now have a gentle King we have a king now who loves we have a king who is Like a Shepherd who will save his people from destruction we have a king who is who has been born into a wicked and cruel murderous world so that you don't have to die and the world is proclaiming it listen to house birds and put this a stir begins as soon as Christ is born he has not spoken a word he has not wrought a miracle he has not proclaimed a single single Doctrine but when Jesus was born at the very first while as yet you hear nothing but infant cries nothing but the infant weakness still his influence on the world is manifest but for the universe to jump out a cater and a star to appear now we know it's more than a star it was the same as a as the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel that's what the prophet said it was just like the pillar of fire led to children of Israel it's the same kind of fire that was in the sky that was leading the magias but all of all of the world and all of the universe was declaring that Jesus is Lord Jesus has come and he gives his life for the sake of others while Herod takes the life of others we see this birth of Jesus and as we look at this birth of Jesus and we begin to see what Jesus was for and we begin to see that there is now these magias look I see this now and they as they arise they say that now there's life on the horizon that there is hope on the horizon do you see how things are changing now because the good will always outwin and overtake the evil no doubt how evil and how Wicked something can be God is always better and here they can see now that there is life and there's Hope on the horizon and for the Believers today I want you to know there is hope on the horizon if you're a Believer today and you've given your life to Christ and you worshiping God there is hope for you in this life in this world not in this world but in the world come life is on the horizon there is a land beyond the river that is why we worship it's not because I earned it it's not because you've done anything good it's not because you are married in it but it's because there is a lamb beyond the river because Jesus came and died on a cross and because of that there will be no more sickness no more sorrow No More Death no more no more crying No More Tears that ought to give us something to praise God about say hallelujah praise our Lord all right but the world now is worshiping Satan it's Satan's eating it's where all his little imps you know I heard brother random use that word and I thought what in the world does that word mean mischievous Little Devils laughs all of his mischievous Little Devils he said he's got Devils it's thrown down his powers he said he's got little amps out here you don't realize it and he goes in to listing these things and I hope it's not problems here but think about the world that we live in he said they go in and they said begin to smoke cigarettes and women out here and drinking and carrying on and you're poisoning your system he says you're ruining the whole Generations that will follow you you're up in your chance of cancer by 85 percent and these little imps are all in control of this and they're worshiping these things and he said that back in there back then he said there was a preacher across the way there he didn't really give directions or uh exactly where but he said he's promoting square dancing and how do we see that music and entertainment has taken over today and he said back then it started with a little bit of square dancing and he said it all started when men were taking other other men's lives and dancing with them and pulling them up close to them you see how the perversion starts and they begin to worship that thing and all this is going on and he said you get out there and the women they get stripped down you know there's very little modesty in the world today and I know we've heard that for a long time but I have to say it's it's more vulgar and more perverted then anytime I've ever can remember what are they doing they're worshiping there is a God of this evil age and they are worshiping this God with the pollution that they do with their lives remember he says sin didn't begin on Earth sin began in heaven when Lucifer said I want a denomination I want to make it great and big and bigger than anything Michael has he says notice Lucifer in the last days is doing what he did in the first see he's not changed his character even though he's a fallen angel he still got the same characteristics and Lucifer wants to be worshiped and he says the first thing that Lucifer does is he tries to separate the fellowship of God and man think about that he tries to separate the fellowship of God and man to build him a kingdom and a great Splendor something is greater than Michael's he said have you got that he said now if you've missed it just hold up your hand because I want to say it again this is how important this is he says Lucifer at the beginning his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter greater thing in heaven than Christ had um so brothers and sisters we can see here that Satan knows if he can drop a wedge between you and God he's on his Road if he can separate you from worshiping God he knows that there is hope that he could slide his little slick Weasley way right into your vessel into your house and to your environment and the next thing you know you won't no longer be worshiping God because that wedge is there something will happen and that little Holy Spirit the prophet said it'll just fly off like a little dove what is that that's Satan driving wedges in our life he's trying to drive a separating wedge between you and God because if he can get in there he knows he's got a chance [Music] and this cycle is never broken this cycle won't be broken until we're in the millennium so we have to combat this we have to be aware of this and Satan driving his wedges in there because he wants more praise than God he wants more love than God he wants more followers than God he wants to be loved more than God serving the God of this evil age and what do they say oh I just love it they go to parties oh we had a great time we just loved it sleep with multiple men and women we just love it you know that's a big thing now um let me tell you it's going to be awful hot but they love it they're worshiping into this system of this God of an evil age and he says notice about the time that Jesus came on the scene Judas came on the scene remember I told you this cycle is never broken this cycle goes on and on and on it started in the heavens come down and the cycle begins to go on and on and he says I want you to notice the natures of these two Spirits Judas was a religious man he was on an Infidel he said he was a religious man and we know he was of the Antichrist spirit and he said he worked very close at the hand of Christ he was Christ right hand man he said did you know in heaven that the devil was God's right hand man so brothers and sisters I believe we have dominion I believe we have authority I believe we have power over Satan but we cannot underestimate him we cannot underestimate him he says Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and this power is to draw worship the reason that he brought sin in the world was he was able to take something that God had created and perverted it back into an evil thing and that started all the trouble in the beginning he said God before way back before the foundation of the world was ever laid he seen Satan the done that and in his pride he went over the North and set up a kingdom and fought against Michael and his angels the right hand of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning he said and God listen to this this is astonishing I know you've heard it but just listen God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him power almost co-workers with him only difference Satan could not create so here is Satan in the heavens before the foundation of the Earth and he sees day after day after day as he's standing by the right hand of God almighty and he sees and all he hears are the Angels worshiping holy holy holy Lord God Almighty we praise you Lord and this starts to weigh on Lucifer's mind and Lucifer begins to think hey he made me in such a way that I'm just like him he co-created me only difference is I can't create he can do all that but why are they not worshiping me and he begins to get out there into the minds of the Angels one-third of the Angels he goes into their minds and he begins to work on them hey all you ever do is praise him but what about me I'm as powerful too look at me putting all of the emphasis on himself and by that one-third of the Angels is encouraged to begin to start worshiping him and turn their minds away from God almighty foreign took something that God created and perverted it he said I want you to notice when Cain and Abel very beautiful picture of it Cain and Abel was nothing more than a pre-figure of Judas and Jesus and the next statement here was astonishing to me when we talk about worship we have to have a place of worship generally we call this the house of God the house of worship we have an altar brother says just as Cain killed Abel at the altar think about that he said Judas killed Jesus at the altar when we look at what the altar means it means the air a raised area and a house of worship where people can honor God with offerings so came to your brothers and sisters has come to an altar to say Abel in an act of worship same thing Herod wanted to do come tell me when this child is born because I want to go and worship him see it all matters what altar you're worshiping at you can worship and worship and worship and be worshiping at the wrong altar but God is the one who is Worthy of all our worship turn with if you would to Matthew chapter 4. Matthew chapter 4. very familiar scripture when Jesus was led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward unhungered so here we see Jesus had just come from the baptismal he was showing how to be baptized and was being and was being honored that way and he comes into this Wilderness Area and to get away and to just pray and meditate and he's fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and the Bible says he was hungered so now we see that Jesus is in a weakened state did you ever notice a lot of times the Temptation will come when you're in your weakened state when you're when you're something's not going right when you're sick that's when the temperature comes that's when the opportunities come when you're not quite where you should be with God when you're not quite worshiping the way you should be and praising God and living the life you should be living here's when the opportunities come for Satan and The Temper comes to him and said if you be the son of man turn these stones into bread and you know I won't rehearse at all but we'll go over it he says no no it's written I'm not going to do that I won't tempt my God and so then the devil takes him up and takes him up onto the pentacle it says if you be the Son of God if you be a son jump off and the angels will catch you before you even Dash your feet to the ground I said no no no no I shall not be tempted I will not tempt the Lord thy God and so then here I want you to look here and we'll pick up in verse 8. again the devil taketh him into an exceedingly high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and said unto him all these things I will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me and Jesus said unto him it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and only him thou shall serve what happened it says the devil leaveth him and be humbled Angels Came and ministered to him there's that word again ministered we talked about last week here Jesus was in a wicked state of mind being tempted over and over and over and Satan looks at it and and he says here all you got to do is is Fall Down and Worship me God Jesus and you can have all of this that I have dominion over you know from time to time we find ourselves in places we find ourselves at places where we'll be tempted and this is not a time that we're trying to prove something to God but it's a time when we're trying to prove something to ourselves and the Spiritual Beings watching us when you're weak then you'll be made strong it's through Jesus and brothers and sisters when we in our lowest points of Our Lives and we are become out as Overcomers and we overthrow the enemy it shows all of the Unseen World around us that we have victory that by his stripes we're healed and that my sins that were many they're all forgotten and these angels that set all around us begin to rejoice and those demons that were sitting there with them just gnawing at us they have to flee and those angels come down they begin to minister to us and say I'm going to lift as you have worshiped God don't think that there's not demons in there just like it is angels we talk about angels sitting all around but just the same as there is demons the prophet said at one point I was reading on this and he said there was two demons and one was on one side and one was on the other one it was a cancerous tumor and the other one was a cancerous spirit and they were trying to connect to one another and he said when he began to pray the angel of the Lord separated him so don't think these angels and these demons are not watching how you react to your situations in life they want to know they want to either Revel in your misery or they're going to glorify and the power you have of victory um he said let me tell you something on demonology real quick I know y'all like it when I preach on this but we got to preach on it the devil is just a real devil Jesus Christ as Jesus Christ the son of God he's the devil Heaven is just as real If Heaven's not real hell's not real he says it's it it's let me skip on down here he said but there's a day and there's a night as sure as there's a Christian there's a hypocrite as sure is there somebody that's genuine there's somebody that's impersonating there's a pro and a con a black and a white right on down through life and everything a true worship a false worship he said a false gospel a true gospel a false baptism a true baptism a make-believe dollar a genuine dollar he says that's a genuine Christian there's a genuine hypocrite he says it's just impersonating so you'll find it all goes together Judas and Jesus Herod and Jesus Cain and Abel Lucifer and God who will you worship who's going to get the glory in our lives this temptation here as Jesus is up in the up in the mountains there and Satan is tempting him this is this vision is an invitation for Jesus to take a shortcut around Calvary do you realize that if he would have just listened to Satan Satan told him I will give you all the lands that you see and all of its Glory you think he was showing him all the bad stuff going on no he was showing him what he wanted to see I will give you all of this if you will just fall down and worship me hmm Satan's wanting Jesus to do what the three wise men did to him you think about that what did it say that the wise man did when they went and they found Jesus they fell down and they worshiped him and now Satan is turning it right around twisting the words of the old liar and he's twisting the words and he says I'll give you all of this that I have dominion over if you'll just fall down and worship me in other words God transfer your power we don't need to transfer of power we need to harness the power that we have we need to harness the power that God has already given us and we find ourselves worshiping and allow God to reward us with power and authority so Jesus here he could lay claim to all of these kingdoms listen to this little saying here well listen to this Jesus could have all of these kingdoms everything that had been lost and been given and Satan had dominion over and he would have never had to suffer the first stripe they would have never pierced his hands with nails he would have never had to go to the Garden of Gethsemane he would have never had to cry not my will but thine Lord it was just that easy it was all laying right there at his fingertips let me tell you the danger is the greatest when the end is good listen to that the danger is the greatest when the end is good the danger of falling into temptation the danger of accepting a rotten business deal that you know is not right it it's when it looks real good here was Jesus and an opportunity right here this looks real good I can have everything I've ever lost no suffering that's temptation that's a Temptation that we can't imagine and all he has to do is give in the worship of Satan let me tell you how important worship is to Satan if you owned real estate throughout the county thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of Acres with houses and businesses churches and events taking place and you're prospering and you you own all of this would you be willing to give all that to somebody just for them to fall down at your feet and say I love you because that's what Satan was willing to do worship is so important to Satan that he's willing to give up all the dominions of the world all the governments the prophet said he was the governor of the United States he's the governor of Russia he's the governor of all the countries out there it's all Satan's it's not Joe Biden he's just a puppet he's just a puppet in the hands of Satan it's not Donald Trump's I'm sorry to burst your bubble he's just a mouthpiece in the hand of what's happening in the world economy he says I will give you Satan has the authority to give this world and his government's back over to Satan's or to Jesus and all the kingdoms and all the worlds and all their glories but Adam and Eve gave the devil his authority think about this God gave adam the Earth as stewardship I said Adam I'm going to give you this Earth and everything that's in it I want you to tend to it I want you to take care of it I want you to to be the be the Lord of all this Earth and then Here Comes sin in and here we see the descendants of Adam and they they cast their vote for sin Eve she chose sin and all they had to say is it is written yeah yeah when Jesus was there and Satan is giving him the temptation and the Bible says that when he said I shall not serve any other God and the devil departed from him the Bible then turns around and tells us that these angels came and they ministered to him now I can imagine in my mind as as my mood as my mind is that these angels as we said were sitting all around watching this event unfold and trying to see exactly what what is he going to do and as he says those magic words and the devil departs and vanishes out of his presence the Angels must have come down there and they must have said we knew you could do it we knew you would do it we knew you would overcome we knew you wouldn't give us your lord your God your Almighty you're the Healer you're the deliverer do you see they begin to worship and minister to him and remind Jesus who he is let me tell you Jesus don't have to be reminded but he loves to be reminded I don't have to be reminded that my kids love me but I like it when they tell me I don't have to be reminded that my wife loves me but it sure sounds good when she tells me vice versa husbands let's look at some of these overcoming acts before we close if we could we look here in the book of Acts and you've got Paul and Silas now we look at Paul and Silas and the the the way of worship that they choose is by singing here's Paul and Silas in a prison in a dungeon hungry wet cold starving and this is no ordinary song service but here all of a sudden comes a duet from two men who were beaten and bruised and Shackled and their worship was so heartfelt and I can imagine as they were sitting down there and they said you know what Paul what Silas I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them really oh yeah I'm one of them I'm one of them praise God I can say I'm one of them and about that time I can imagine that that song reached up into the portals of heaven and gone from his very Throne began to tap his foot oh he's one of them they're one of me I'm one of them oh we're coming together and the portals of Heaven open up and the ministry of God come down to that prison and the prison walls were broken the bars couldn't hold them no more let me tell you Satan may try to hold you down but he can't hold your lips he may try to Shackle you and burden you but he can't hold you down because God Almighty hears your cries from the very portals of Heaven here's this little ill-famed woman the great one of the I feel it's the greatest story one I'm ever told in the Bible Well ill-famed Woman she looks over at the Pharisees house it says what's going on over there and she's looking over there at the Pharisees house what what's going on what's that crowd all about what's all this disorder about and the problem says she goes over there and she's just a little old ill-famed prostitute that says she begins to look on her tiptoes and she's looking over the shoulders of the man trying to see what's going on over in Simon's house and she looks over there and she looks and she says oh they're having a feast they're having a dinner look at all this wonderful food and there's her eyes peer over into the corner is that him is that him is that the one it looks just like him and I have heard so much about it is that the very one that said she was struck with such ambition she run to her house and she run up I was rickety stairs up into an attic where she lived I said she went over there and she opened up a chest and grabbed down into her and grabbed a little sock full of money and since she took off running down there she said oh I can't do this see how Satan tries to throw up your past when your Future's standing right before you he tries to throw up her past and Satan tells her says you can't do this because you're ill-fame he's a prophet he'll know exactly where you made that money oh she says oh there must be something wrong with me sight never tell you make you think something's wrong with you there's something wrong with me I can't do this I just can't do this I must be crazy and the tears began to flow down her cheeks and he said but I can't stand to look at him the way he looked and she said the tears rolled down his cheeks because nobody made him there said Jesus crossed over in the corner like a Wallflower and everybody passes by him and she said I've got to do something brothers and sisters when nobody else will praise God we've got to do something when all of the world is serving Satan and worshiping the evil age we've got to do something I don't care what your past is if you've been to Calvary do something he said listen to this he said you know there's something about women he said I wish to God they would use more of it because there's something about them they don't stand in Wonder like men do he said no men he said men try to stand around and figure it out but women do what's on their hearts if God lays something on your hearts women men children I don't care who you are do it she said I've just got to do it she picked up that little sock full of every penny she had every penny she had and she goes down to the street and goes into the store and the store keeper harshly looks at her and says what do you want what do you want and she says I want the best Alabaster Box you got precious I want the very best because he deserves the best I want the best perfume I want the best box you've got in the store it cost me that's what we want to do is give our best the prophet said give your best give him your best give him your best life get him your best songs give him your best talent give him your everything you got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him your praise give him everything you got because he deserves the best have you ever heard that that's a lot of giveness give give give give I want to give everything I have to you God and this little woman here this little ill-famed harlot says I've got every penny I've ever made and the prophet said they all knew her I can't help but to wonder what he meant when he said that all the Pharisees knew her she took that little box under her arm they said she tucked it under her arm and she started knocking one with an elbow making her way get out of my way I've got a mission I'm on a boat I got somewhere to be and she's got that little Alabaster Box and she's knocking them Pharisees out of the way and so she just keeps moving and moving and moving until she gets to him brothers and sisters so many times we stopped before we ever get there sometimes we gotta just get our elbows up and start knocking demons out of the way and says I've got a right to get to the throne of God and she finds herself there standing before God the only place you could ever find rest for her soul and he says she finds herself helpless that's when I find myself worshiping God the most when I find myself hopeless and helpless and says she falls down she's falling prostrate down at Jesus's feet his dirty stinking feet that nobody cared about as she falls down there at his feet and the tears begin to run down her cheek because she's guilty and he said the tears begin to flow down her cheek and she's boo-hoo and she's crying what is she doing she's pouring out herself before God and she's worshiping God and she's boohoo and she's crying and she sees him sitting there with 30 feet and she's beside herself do you think anybody else in the room existed at that moment in time no and we got to get to a place in our lives that we don't care who's around us what's going on around us when it's between us and God that nothing else matters we get beside ourselves so that we can get to Jesus she was beside herself tears rolling down her cheeks and before you know it she was standing at the fountain of love foreign how good is our God these are dignitaries wouldn't even take time to give him perfume they wouldn't take time to wash the dust off his feet they wouldn't take time to let him wash his face they wouldn't give him all to anoint himself so that he was presentable but they left it cutting in a corner the very Fountain Of Love it's all in our approach it's all in our approach and she began to get so excited and her hair fell down and those curls all done up they fell down and she began to wipe his feet with tears as she began they didn't even give him a towel and her tears as she began to wash and massage his feet and her hair falls down and she wipes his feet with her hair to get the dirt and the manure off of his feet from the travels and she is worshiping and worshiping and he said what is that he said it's tears from a fountain of a pen repenting heart and she says I'm so wretched I'm so miserable oh Lord God and her glory laying at his feet wiping his feet tears streaked down her cheeks like fountains and says she picked up that Alabaster Box she wasn't done she wasn't done she was sitting there pouring out her heart to God and recognizing who he was not some dirty man in a corner but the Fountain of Life and she's now washed and ministered to him so she takes the alabaster box and breaks the lid off of it and pours the most precious all upon Jesus's face upon his feet as she begins to anoint him as she begins to wipe it with the oil signifying the Holy Spirit foreign Jesus listen to what the prophet said he said it was like a fountain running off her face and she's washing his feet she picks up the alabaster box and pours it all over she didn't just sprinkle it she pours it all all of her living all of her glory all of her money all of everything even all of her heart pouring the tears As She lays at Jesus feet I've said it's not always about singing it's not always about saying hallelujah amen sometimes we just need to fall prostrate at the feet of Jesus and say Lord I'm a miserable I'm I'm a wretch I'm miserable without you I need that Fountain of love I need that Fountain of Life I need I need from you Lord because I know you're able and she five finds herself standing there I got something to say to you can you imagine how those words must have hushed the crowd no doubt all these Pharisees were watching as she's ministering to Jesus and he says Simon now that I've got your attention I've got something to say to you I come into your house you bid me to come so I came he said you asked me to come you know that's what we do if we ask for Jesus he's going to come are you ready to entertain him when you ask him to come over that's a good question Simon I got to tell you this you asked me to come over you bid me to come but you never gave me water you never gave me water to wash my feet I come into your chamber you never gave me all to anoint my feet and my head and my face you never gave me a kiss of Fellowship you did none of this for me but it's almond do you see this little ill-famed Harlot that you all know she has not ceased to worship me since she saw me she has not said words sin cease to worship me since I came into this room since she was able to make contact to me and I want you to know her sins [Applause] let me tell you if we just lay down and worshiped Jesus you'll find your sins are not as big as what you think they are I'm not saying we don't need repentance we need repentance just like she needed repentance we need the cross just like she needed a cross and Jesus went to that cross and some of the greatest words of worship that was ever uttered let's stand to our feet you love the Lord tonight I tell you I'm uh that story is one of my favorites and I'm humbled by it every time I hear it and every time I rehearse it the humility that that little lady I say a little later because she became a changed person the humility that she had to have in worshiping God but she just wanted to know I want to give you Lord the worship and the praise that is due to you while I'm in your presence let's just bow our heads sister Becky if you just play In The Presence of Jehovah [Music] just meditate for just a minute just listen softly to the
