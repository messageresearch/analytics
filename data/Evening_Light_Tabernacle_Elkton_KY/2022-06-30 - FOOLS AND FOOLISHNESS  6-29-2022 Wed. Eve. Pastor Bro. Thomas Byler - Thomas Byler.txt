need of course being closer to you lord and to have more of you we ask god that you'll bless the thoughts of my heart and that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to minister tonight we just ask god that you bless me and help me now in jesus name amen and amen amen i got a little different little different little different message for you tonight is that all right amen um so we'll be trying to say it in the way that the holy spirit would want to say it but we want to speak tonight with the help of the lord about fools and foolishness fools and foolishness amen maybe even nuts huh that's right amen praise the lord god bless you amen turn your bibles if you will and we will read a scripture out of first corinthians 4. first corinthians 4. the way that i got to thinking about this i got to thinking about david and i was thinking about david and um let's uh actually i've got that wrote down i pulled it up just before i come out here because i want to read it and i think we'll go to that one first first second samuel ii samuel i haven't even turned to it yet that's going to be the sixth chapter ii samuel 6. and since it was him that i was thinking about before we go into the new testament uh six and i'll bring that down a little bit verse 20 will begin how many remembers that this was when the ark of the lord was coming back into jerusalem coming back home amen and david was very very happy he was very glad when it happened in that right and we'll begin with verse let's go back back with 4 verse 14 13 and it was so that when they that bear the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings and david danced before the lord with all of his might and david was girded with a linen ephod so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of a trumpet and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david mike michael i guess saul's daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart and they brought up brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offering he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women and men to everyone a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed everyone to his house then david returned to bless his household and my michael the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the hands-maids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself and david said unto my michael michelle is it i don't know how to pronounce that m-i-c-h-a-l matchelle a chell we'll just do the best we can michelle all right we got teachers here that probably tell us amen and david said unto michelle if if it was before the lord who's who which chose me before my father and before all of his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord and i will yet again them be more vile than thus and will be based in my own sight and in and of the hands matrix i have spoken of them shall i be made head in honor shall i be had in honor and michael the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death over in first corinthians one more scripture one more scripture over in first corinthians amen in chapter four and i'll just read the first part of verse 10 and then we want to try to go back and pick up a few thoughts on this thought chapter 4 verse 10 we are fools for christ's sake may god add his blessings to the reasoning word you can be seated amen amen i was thinking about david and how that he danced before the lord and how happy he got and i was thinking about this i i was thinking if the thought came to my heart says is it okay to be stupid but for the lord [Laughter] is it all right to get plum stupid for the lord amen now we know that down through history amen and especially in the early 1900s the pentecost move come on the holy ghost come upon people people spoke in tongues and we've heard all kinds of stories people running the aisles running on top of benches running outside the building running people just going crazy so to speak right we've heard a lot of things that people do under the influence of the holy ghost you know and i know that there's a lot of wildfire right a lot of it maybe some of it may be carnal some of it may be fleshly some of it me you might say that's just plain parallel but what did brother bob say about it about fire a little wildfire he said i'd rather have a little wild or fire then no fire at all amen praise the lord now in this scenario that we're looking at with david we realized that the ark had been gone amen and it was a time for the ark to come now i know about you but if i'd have been part of israel i wouldn't want to have in any place except for where the ark is because we know that god's blowing that earth and so when god was coming back and it's just like a backslider almost you get away from god and you're all down you're all depressed you're all that's terrible when you greet the holy spirit when you get that holy spirit back it's a time of rejoicing and that's the way it kind of was with david it was a time of rejoicing and and he got beside himself almost folks begin to strip his clothes off and dance now i don't know how many other times not just to a whole lot of other times maybe you know i know miriam and them dance all these different places you know but not a whole lot of times that people get so carried away that they just go to dancing everywhere and david he was just a main fellow i think that that michelle must have thought that he was just a little crazy you acted like a fool huh so to speak that's just how you just act a little bit foolish but he didn't mind because he was for the lord and you know david had known that what it was like to be in a sheep's coat and a and a sheep herder way on the backside and he was the least among all of his brethren i think it was samuel that came to anoint somebody in their household amen and all the brothers passed by samuel and none of them were ordained and and samuel had to ask him hey heaven you got somebody else because i know god don't make a mistake he sent me to your house and he said he said one more he says oh yeah the little shyster you know the least one that little one in the family the offscaring of the family he's kind of the weird one always always you know just oh my he's got to have his own secret time in his own place always talking about god and all being spiritual and everything you know yeah he's on the back side and he said bring him on bring him up they brought him on in and sure enough the light flashed just right and he went over there and anointed him with oil he's going to be the next king of israel huh i chose him to be the next king of israel amen and later on way on later in his life you know he said you know god told him uh talking about david i took you from the sheep coke i've taken you from being a nobody and now i've made it you the king of all of my people david had something to praise god about when i got to thinking about if we would really think if you would really think about what you got to praise god about you would be a hot lot happier you know meditation is a good thing what goes through our mind is the atmosphere that we create around ourself wherever we are i hope you got that the things we think about the things we meditate on is what we become it's what we feed on amen i can think about uh losing my wife i can lose think about losing my kids i can lose i can drive down the road and i can think and just try to imagine what this would be like some of these things and it almost take me to tears huh just sheer meditation i believe that we need to have our meditation upon the lord amen but david he knew he remembered of where god had brought him from because how many knows every breath that you take is a gift from god and you only got so many oh when i think about how did god amen you know before i was raised born and raised up with ohio amish boy a little amish boy a horse and buggy little square haircut yeah that's right a two-year pastor is used to be a amish boy i don't know why they call them dumb amishmen but anyway there you are i was just a dumb amishman and ain't much better now but anyway praise god when you think about it you know i thought about i came from a family of 10 and 10 children and i think back and i think about where i come from and how my mom and dad the environment that i was and then i think of how that there was something on the inside that brought me to where i am today and that's what i'm so i'm so thankful you know because i believe the little boy or i believe i had a stillborn son that was born just before me and they had to give me like seven blood transfusions just to get me crank up i barely made it huh and so and i think about that now think about you know it was god that brought me to this world it was god that brought you out of another million people it could have been germinated in your mother's womb god picked you aren't you glad to be alive aren't you glad to be living i ain't hearing no david's around here come on folks it ought to be giving you something to dance about i am very happy tonight just to exist how many knows every singer that ain't got a hold of god and don't have eternal life they are someday gonna cease to exist but if you have eternal life you'll never cease to exist that don't excite you i don't know what will that don't give you a little joy to know that you have eternal life in your bosom god coming he took your whole life away the old thomas violet he's dead you're looking at a new man you're looking at a different person yeah that's why david acted like a fool and he didn't mind do it and in front of his army he didn't mind do it in front of his whole nation he danced before the lord i don't care how many had michael's attitude huh he didn't care when somebody dances in the lord he gets all happy the lord and acts stupid i don't really care it's for the lord like he said yes it's okay to act stupid for the lord so we're talking about dealing tonight with crazy crazy can somebody tell me something about crazy when i asked myself that question coming to church i said what have we got to say about crazy you know what came to my mind i wanted to ask you if you know if you have a good thought on crazy go ahead speak up i'll let you do it what's crazy crazy up on get going off on a limb somewhere he might phrase that right but the first thing i thought is yeah the whole world is crazy the whole world is crazy they have gone insane the prophet declared that they would someday go totally insane and that's what we're living in we're living in an insane institute i thought today welcome to sodom and gomorrah because that's the world the world is in the sodom and gomorrah condition used to be other countries but now it's us now it's us folks if we can't kill we're gonna riot if we can't kill babies that's insane all right you are insane you have lost your mind you are officially crazy amen amen and in the world's view you are crazy also a fool somebody that we call great he's crazy nothing but a fool he's nuts [Laughter] the whole world's nuts let me tell you something the whole world's fools believer and unbeliever everybody's a fool that's why i say i gotta make sure that we say this right because it can be a little hard to swallow i'm crazy that's right jesus called his own disciples fools after his resurrection tommy he come back and cleopas and his friends were walking on the road to emmaus and they were talking about the lord and and these different things and jesus come right out of the woodwork and he walked with him you know and he explained his gospel to him and he said oh fools oh fools and full of art they believe all that the prophets are spoken his own child's called fools amen jesus used it many times he used it on the pharisees and then he used his own his own disciples but abraham tells the story of in california one place he says he read a story of what a man was going down down the road picketing and he big old sign on this button on his back it said i am a fool for christ because that's what paul said he was we're fools for christ and he went walked on back and on the back it said who's fool are you because you're gonna serve somebody you're gonna be half one master it's gonna be god or he's gonna be the devil gonna be one or the other that's who you're gonna serve amen see they're full they're fools to us and we're fools to them the bible says in first corinthians 2 and verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to them unto him and neither can he know him because they are spiritually discerned amen so to us the world man we are fools to the world amen listen to brother brown he made the statement i can just remember halfway right he said god does some of the most ridiculous things god does some of the most ridiculous things he said he takes the foolish things he does some foolish some crazy stuff sometimes god does huh that's what i gather he and the bible declares the same thing that god will take the foolish things of this world to confound the wise amen faith be the god hallelujah do you know what you get saved by you get saved by foolishness i'm so glad i got a scripture up here because i got so many eyes on me what in the world are you talking about preacher all right for the preaching of the cross to them that perish is foolishness isn't that right but unto us which are saved it is the power of god the bible says that by foolishness god chose to save them that belief by the foolishness of preaching this here it's supposed to them it's foolishness but it's not to us it's the power of almighty god if you'll believe the preacher's foolishness you can get to heaven his foolish preaching if you'll believe isn't that right and my honor and i ain't got many hands but god chose by the foolishes of preaching to save them better lost praise god amen i wasn't going to get excited tonight i was just going to give you a good lesson here but the more i talk about this the better i feel i'll say like the prophet said you know i may be just a little crazy but leave me alone i like it this way i'm happy here if i'm crazy just leave me alone amen oh my i talked to a girl not long ago but her ma'am says up in oregon she belonged to another denomination i believe she was catholic and she says who's done people what's attending your party if uh they're the ones that is going to be in heaven then i wouldn't want to be there she was a reporter i believe talking to him and i said well you won't have to worry very much about that unless you change your attitude see you ain't got to worry much about that she says all that they're screaming and carrying on i mean that we could use a little more i'm you know if i don't get nothing else it costs tonight let me get this because that we need the more of those experiences like the prophet had that if you're mowing your yard you ought to stop that thing and pull it up in the park and you ought to have you as little rather jubilee sometimes just to run and fit because i could got it that's when there ain't nobody watching it's just you and the lord like brother bannon was out in the wilderness and he got to looking at that eagle he made it out at all he got the revelations of what it was all about he said i wasn't running around running around that tree just screaming in the hole in the top of my voice if anybody would ever heard me and he said there's a crazy man up there just like david he was a crazy man he went a little crazy but that's all right it's for the lord he's worthy of it i could see god up on the throne looking down at that's my boy right there even the new testimonies from testimony he says wants us have joy unspeakable and full of glory that's what god wants you not to have how many if i said if you don't that right now you need a trip to the altar how many would you have to come to the altar none of you all got giants we go be totally honest here we're being honest tonight i've got i just can't stand it no most of us are not that way right now are we no we're not i'm not that way a lot of times but when i get to think about what god is and what he does and who he is what he means i get a little excited it does something to you amen but i got to think the boy boy what about this david man i'm telling you what they thought michelle thought that he was a fool kind of you know like one of these vain fellows one of these drunk guys maybe or you know idiots or whatever all right let me finish the story see all this here screaming and carrying on and i said now wait you worship mary the virgin mary before god would ever let a wedding garment put upon her he was speaking on a certain wedding dress that we got to have the wedding garment in there right she had to go up on the day of pentecost and get so full of the spirit does she staggered like a drunk woman i mean they got a little crazy ain't going out of the upper room and the people around thought that they were a bunch of drunk people whoa can you imagine god started this church out staggering [Applause] praise be to god the glory that's how he started it out full of the holy ghost speaking in tongues happy free he started that way where have we gotten to the huh said if she had to get it that way oh my this mary that you claim to worship so she staggered like she was drunk you ain't coming in in anything less just remember that that's right and as you call the mother of god see virgin mary had to go to pentecost and get the holy ghost before she could ever go to heaven and you'll never get in and until you get the same way under anything less praise the lord how many believes that you got to get the baptism of the holy ghost in your life the fire of the holy ghost oh my don't get me started how many knows whenever they were on the day of pentecost before they never got dropped before it says that the licks of fire came down upon them praise be to god that's what we need more is that fire that fire of the holy ghost in our life oh it'll burn out every sin it'll burn out all desires that are wrong it'll get you right amen we might be screaming shall we am i that crazy but i'm going to tell you this one thing it will do it'll make you live right it'll make you walk right it'll make you love right it'll make you trick and then treat your neighbor right it'll make you treat your wife right it'll make you teach your children right it'll make you treat your neighbors right it straightens you up because that's what the human race needs is straightening up the whole world needs to get crazy for the lord instead of the devil because right now they're fools for the devil amen ain't nobody goes to walmart looking like that unless they're fool for the devil you know what i'm talking about all right here we go oh my you'll never get in on anything less oh my oh that is so that's right i said do you believe the bible here it is mary was right there with him in the upper room she got so full of the spirit until she danced under the spirit acting like somebody drunk you think you'll get the heaven under anything less than that when god's own mother so to speak early speaking huh had to do that you ain't going to get in any other way the people they make fun and they call them a bunch of idiots i mean we get all kinds of names tagged we get called holy rollers huh idiots crazy man people take all kinds of names on us but jesus said man be happy when they cast your name out as evil they called him beelzebub they didn't call him nothing nice they call him the chief of devils amen and listen even paul said in the way that's called heresy that's crazy amen oh some heresy crazy well we call that because the supernatural is so much different from the carnal things of the world till it makes people think that they're crazy paul said to gribba i'm not mad means crazy i'm not crazy you think i am but in a way that's called heresy so worshipped by the god of my father's that's the way i do it i like that but says i'd like to join hands with paul i'd like to be there on that day when he gets his robe of righteousness of christ when he's crowned hallelujah i want to have the same kind of robe on that he did and he was not ashamed of the gospel of christ amen praise be to god not ashamed of the gospel of christ in many different ways paul talked about how that in the way it's called harris he so worships he the god of his father now let's go back to paul again let's look at where this was where we started off with chapter 4 verse 10 we are fools for christ's sake all right now let me just uh make another statement and then i'll back it up with the scripture in order for you to really become a christian you have to become a fool all right if you think you're smart listen to this chapter 3 verse 18 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seems to be wise in this world let him become a fool huh let him become you think you're wise you think you know something you're gonna have to become a fool in other words fools don't know too much huh they're not considered very smart huh folks i don't know but i've lived long enough brother glenn to know i'm not smart no oh my i've done some other dumber things have you the only good in me is what christ is amen the problem is people don't get simple enough they think they know something outside of this you don't know nothing you ain't even got a right to think anything outside of this word he that believeth is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned come that way or don't come at all think better don't think at all everything christ said that's what you said amen how many believes that i want to repeat oh i want to have the mind of god let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus become a fool hey man you've got to get stupid stupid in yourself stupid to think that you're smart you're not because if you think you're smart and maybe you are wise be your einstein maybe you're some of those great men but if they didn't ever come to god they weren't very smart stupidest thing anybody will ever do is not come to christ not accept what he did it'd be lost in the end huh that's true stupidity real wisdom is accepting what god has for you and become nothing we all understand what brother brahm said if you've got to become a nobody an absolute nobody praise be to god and never raise above that just like paul he was a smart true dude amen smart worldly wise but what did he say all those things that i learned and all the little things that i had [Applause] i wish i could remember the scriptures i call all things but dumb we all know what dung is hello we i can't laugh but bunch of dogs so that i may not know the power of his resurrection so that might know him everything in my past all my wisdom is not but that's it he became a fool he became a nobody that's what made him a great man of god if you ever want to be a great christian but you've got to become don't live your own life i like what i heard by the way i'm saying knowing that on on paul a prisoner a prisoner he says my achievements my ambitions i got man the only thing i have is i want to please him i'm going to do whatever he wants me to do that's my ambition that's my goal that's my dream just to be what god wants me to be that's right listen to that tape a prisoner a good tape amen praise be to god all right let the man deceive him if you if you think he wise then become a fool for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god amen for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness amen and again the lord know the thoughts of the wise that they are vain amen again for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise and where is the scribe where is the disputer of the world it's going to dispute it oh as a minister of god i'd like to say who is going to dispute god's word no you can think you are but it'll never change it it'll never diminish it it'll never pass away it's not what you think it's what he said for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god amen for it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews of stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness praise be to god you go to church ah that's so foolish no it's not but somebody's gonna think if you're a christian you're just stupid you wear those clothes you're just stupid huh all i can say is we'll see who the stupid one is we'll see amen don't never cower down to somebody knocking you for your christianity now you stand up and be even more proud of it don't be ashamed of it some people when you say oh you were a holy roller huh you're a holy roller yeah i'm no no i'm not just a holy oh i'm a nut i am a crazy holy roller okay i'm a fool for christ i will get stupid on you [Laughter] glory because if it's for christ he's smiling that's right want to call you stupid for just screaming and shouting and stuff and then they paint themselves and put all kinds of horns on themselves and look like uh i don't know monster for their game they're not crazy remember one man one time came to church and and he sat in the back pews and so forth and and brother brown was preaching woman screamed shivers ran up his back he said shivers this cold shivers ran out my back how can you preach with that he's like i can't preach without it congregation gets way too quiet i just shut down let's go home and go to sleep

by the two donut brother joe when i get too quiet you get worried where is brother brother with his walk huh is he backslid what's going on here let's pray for him man vice versa pray for each other we don't want no icicles coming from the chandeliers huh coming from our here let me tell you they ain't got time to form no frost throughout this bout too much fire coming out you ain't gonna see no frost on these whiskers brother tommy amen somebody say glory for me i'm gonna go a little crazy for me praise the lord we need more the fire the holy ghost amen to the greetings foolishness but unto them that are called both jews greeks americans russians i don't care who you are it's the wisdom of god amen because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men god takes the foolish thing he does some really crazy thing he'll take the weakest man of the family and make him king of everybody he'll take a little shrimp he'll take that off scouring and he'll bring your giants he'll take her little shrimp and steps in scrunty little fellow a man with long hair looked like a hippie for by all means he didn't ever cut his hair i hate to look what he think i didn't think what he looked like today he was never supposed to cut his hair isn't that right am i wrong here or did he have really long hair don't never take a razor to your head never cut your hair god will lay a prophet on his side and strip him naked and lay on his side for three and a half years god will take a prop and go marry a prostitute don't tell god how to do it what to do he'll do what he wants where he wants he knows what he's doing and i don't have to ask i do not have to ask out why he sure doesn't have to come to my justification or to my reasoning never ever amen what a mighty god we serve angels bow before him heaven and earth adore him what a mighty god created everything created you created me it'll make a 90 year old man jump up and kick his heels and that's what it'll do surprise some of you didn't get up on that one folks it's got to rub off a little bit that's right that's what god will do you feel dead you feel old you feel decrepit get on your knees all right start eating some word eating some more meat eagle your eyes become filmed over you're not sure if you're christian anymore if you're going to make the rapture you don't know for sure about this begin to eat meat and you'll renew your youth i just thought of that is that okay folks if you want to renew your youth i mean please we can actually do our use you just seen it a minute ago i don't normally jump like that anymore folks i'm proud to pay for it tomorrow but it makes you feel young again it makes you happy it gives you joy amen praise be to god the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not very many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are you even called huh peter was one of them right couldn't even write his own name ignorant and unlearned they said never probably had any schooling but the bible says they took note that they had been with jesus they knew something about this guy he's not smart he's not wise but this guy's been with jesus huh how many knows god does call the noble god does call the wives because paul was a wise man and so was moses moses was supposed to be the next pharaoh of egypt he was going to be the head now you had the whole world he was power i mean those egyptians they were a superpower at the time there's a problem of god he could have had every physical pleasure that you could imagine for the rest of his days don't even try to imagine it a wine here whatever it is just whatever fleshly pleasures he could have he could have had it but then the bible says that he chose to suffer the afflictions of those slaves he crowned that be a son and not of god greater riches than all the treasures of egypt to us and to the world he was stupid not to us but to the world poisoned that them he gave up everything he lost everything over one egyptian huh he didn't like something in moses didn't like how that egyptian was treating his brothers and he went and killed the man and buried him in the sand thought he could cover it up but no he had major consequences and all right the word got out he had to run for his life and everything else on the backside of the desert became a desert dweller for 40 years god had to put him on the backside with a hot-headed woman for 40 years to get him to calm down huh it worked brother if you think that you know you can just tell your wife what to do when to learn how to do it let it raise up and say no huh there's gonna be some sparks fly it'll calm you down uh maybe i better go about it a little different and she was hot at it but anyway took that out of him and made him have an experience with god on the back side of the desert oh and then again god began to use a foolish old man as the prophet put it he says here comes an old man with his wife and a baby on her hips on a mule coming down to egypt to take over people will ask him along the way where are you going moses i'm going down to egypt to deliver this relax what where i don't see no army where moses is your army huh i'm gonna do it with this stick right here huh i'm gonna do with the stick come and watch right come and watch could have easily said you just can't see him but there's chariots and horses and you ain't never seen the likes of what behind me because you with god with one man and god you are an invincible army huh we learned that with david we learned that from moses we've got all things that are possible they're totally possible with god folks hang on to your seat aren't you glad to have god on your side if we don't say nothing else folks just to have god just to be in contact with god what man calls foolish their paul was he was going to be the next k ephesus he was he was going to be the high priest he's going to be the top dog so to speak he was jealously persecuting the christians and god struck him down brought him off of his heist horse and found out that he was really he was a lot dumber than what he thought he thought he was doing the right thing but god said you are persecuting me but he changed paul completely and he said i'm going to let you let me show you a lot of things that you're going to suffer oh my paul suffered and suffered until paul had nothing better to do called himself a fool if he's going to be a fool listen to what he says for i am become a fool in glorying in glory paul said one place i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little bit here that i'm speak i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting seeing the many glory after the flesh i glory also but you suffer fools gladly seeing you yourselves are wise but for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take you if a man exalts himself if man smites you on face i speak concerning reproach as though we had been weak i'll be it who's wheresoever and he is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also are the hebrews so am i are the israelites i so am i are you the seat of abraham so am i are they the ministers christ i speak as a fool i am mower in laborers boy paul work for it he suffered for it hardly anybody in that generation i i i believe i speak under the inspiration hardly anybody outside of christ suffered as much as paul did in that generation for the gospel huh in stripes above measure in prisons more more frequent in this often of the jews five times received i-40 stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice did i suffer shipwreck a night and a day in the deep in journeyings often in peril to the water and perils of robbers and perils of my own countrymen and perils by my by the heathen in pals in the city and perils in the wilderness snake bit huh paul had some rough days and he gloried in those amen perils amongst false brethren in weirdness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirsting fast things often and cold and nakedness praise be to god think about it god was so real and paul's heart and his life him and paul and silas were in the inner prison one time put in shackles and chains and in the night they were crazy what kind of a crazy man could sing under those conditions pray and praise god but paul could in the worst dark dungeon hole cold hungry nothing to his name no nothing to look forward in this world and begin to praise god he was so crazy that all he could do was brag about his infirmities that's what we would say about thomas bother if i come up to you but it's on all i was ever talking about man how my motor blowed up huh coming home and everything else broke down my tire blew up this happened and that happened huh praise be to god well done sonic folks that's what paul had he says i will glory in my infirmities if i'm in the glory i am a fool he says in glorying in my infirmities to the world it may be foolish but guess what he wasn't looking at his infirmities he was looking at the fact that it don't matter if he's in the dungeon of dungeon abductions he knows he's the son of god he knows he's going to live eternally he knows he's in god's care and god sent angels in there open up the prison doors unshackled him and set him free he had god to come down and set it free if we would be more inspired about the things of god you'll see more miracles happen you see more of the power of god around but the disciples they were so poor then they followed the poor man they follow the bagger they follow somebody that didn't have a dime to his name and no place to lay his head what a boss huh that right didn't even have a place to lay his head jesus did me but yet they followed him because eternal life is worse than him more than anything here out in this world remember that eternal life is worth more than anything in this world that is the number one top thing in your life and in mine meditate on it more think about it more pray about it more amen i love it i love it just little thoughts like that about david why do you have to be such a crazy man what makes you so crazy that your wife will tell you you're acting like a fool you act like one of the banging people i'll tell you why because i know what god has done in my life and he's coming back into my life oh my he's coming back into my life and i'm excited about it i'm going to dance before the lord i'm acting a little stupid for the lord but that's all right they can act stupid for their stuff how many knows and they do should i say what comes to mind they outdo us when it comes to stupid for their god they do i got amen and we all agree [Music] a lot of us would say that's that's definitely me i haven't acted like some of them acted i think i never finished a story about the man that came and and a woman screamed in the back in the back and chills running over his back and after service he says how can you preach you know how can he preach but i think if i'm not wrong he was out there at a baseball game a little bit later and he got so excited he says he could get excited out there but he can't get excited in church come on folks this feels good to my toes brother glenn it feels good from the top of my head down to the feet this old tip of my toe i'm healed i am whole from the top of my head to the soul to the tip of my toe let me say sing it this way i am filled up from the top of my head to the soul to the tip of my toe filled up man this is good oh man i'm apologizing no god is good amen he's good we need more of god in this hour you better get more of god because that world is a strong pull he's got a strong pull and you better get over here where it's got a strong pull i mean you get a hold of it to overcome that that's a real elected child of god will have that it'll be indians to do it it'll be in here to do it it'll be your number one desire amen cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not if i needs to be crazy if i need the glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities amen praise be to god he was going to brag about how that god delivers him out of all of his troubles i can do oh my paul said later on he says i can do all things i know how to be a base i know how to be a hungry i know how to be full i know how to have it good and i know how to have it bad i can do all things through christ which strengthens me god help us to be able to say things i can go through bad times and praise god i can go through good times and praise god we need to get it into our membrane into our genetics that guess what when it's going bad you don't need to change you need to say the same person if not a little bit more for god in the hard times and the bad times amen how many needs to go to the ultra on that one [Music] that's right that's right be honest not all that's easier said than done praise the lord oh my i heard a politician this week saying we are sincerely going to take care of this problem now i'm like the only part of any sincerity that's ever going to take effect is this word sincere that just came out of your mouth that's that's it as far as it goes because actions speak louder than words and reactions absolutely not there the only sincere thing is that word that you spoke that's it sorry i gotta get out of politics man it's bad out there but it's the truth isn't it oh my isn't it sad we're living in a world if somebody says something you better believe it it's just the other way around because if you ain't you're in for a shock you're in for a rude awakening but it's not so with him when he says something you can hang your soul on it every last word of god that he speaks amen praise be to god that's right if i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities listen then chapter 12 and verse 4 says of such a one one that was caught up in the glory of such a one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine informities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i at least any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that which he hears of me at least i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that god gives me that was given unto me a thorn in the flesh but bam says it was probably his eyes he couldn't read and he had to write large letters right a messenger of satan to buffet me at least i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord three times that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness imagine the lord paul eating this healing he needed this healing real bad they asked him for that god god's in there i can use that weakness you got that weakness is where i'm using my strength huh that's where my strength comes from that's how i live my life through you is that weakness you may just because god knew exactly he may just get a little higher than what he should have been my grace is sufficient for me my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore i will rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me praise be to god let me tell you something we in this generation evening like tabernacle you have got to be careful because we have got it so nice huh so nice i think it was david said you know even though the everything is like it is most of us have it pretty good we still have it better than most people huh we're still in america we still enjoy this country huh and if you aren't careful it'll make you soft spiritually i was thinking about this match and i thought about how that sometimes blessings become a curse having it too nice and having zion at ease a lot of the time she gets lazy and sleepy israel remember they got blessed they were in a waste howling wilderness bleeding and so forth god picked up and they were nothing but when they got plenty they got fat and they forgot god they turned to other things we have to be careful in this generation that all these little gizmos these all these things don't zap the life of god out of us the sweetness of the holy spirit amen praise be to god that power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions pleasure wow paul let me not finish but jump back for just a minute if i can if i can find this he said we are fools for christ's sakes and you are wise in christ we are weak we are strong we are honorable we are despised even at this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked buffeted our naked buffett and have no certain dwelling place wow labor working with our hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world called a bunch of holy rotors fanatics crazy huh the all-scouring of the world whereas of the off-scoring of all things unto this day and then i chap i go through about three three scriptures three quotes there he says wherefore i beseech you be followers of me be followers of me in the midst of all of that take pleasure in your infirmities how many of us could say that when something really goes south for us we say lord jesus this is a good time for you to come on the scene i know you can handle this lord praise be to god amen let's be like paul let's in closing let me just finish this scripture i take therefore pleasure in infirmities reproaches necessities and persecutions distresses for christ's sake i like that for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong and i am become a fool in glory and ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for nothing i am behind in the very chiefest apostle though i be nothing paul never thought of himself as anything but yet he knew as far as it really came down to it he was to one of the chief apostles amen my closing thought is this no matter if you're in the darkness dungeon of where it might be remember the greatest thing that we have is to have a lord just to have the lord you ought to give us joy unspeakable and full of glory keep a loose hand on the things of this world because we're not going to stay here much longer i know about you but i'm looking for the rapture to take place i'm looking to get out of here any time that rapture can happen anytime going down to clarksville today seeing the big old all of that huge building and factories going up on the left side you know went up to indiana they're building big factories and everything else and this economy they're building big factories and everything building houses everywhere and i thought about it and i thought what the scripture says you know in the days of noah they built it they did that they did all married they gave him they were doing all of that until the day the rain came that's the way it's going to be the rapture takes place people are still going to be busy building this and building that and having their achievements and everything else but god's going to come and take us home that's what i'm not looking to build this evening thank you for being such a wonderful easy crowd to preach to amen amen praise the lord fools and foolishness amen don't be somebody's full either god's fool or the devil's full one way or the other let's bow our heads find heavenly father we come before you lord jesus lord we want to thank you lord jesus that you have said by the foolishness of preaching you have chosen to save those that believe lord and we want to thank you father for putting something in our hearts and in our lives to believe with and father we do not care about what we look like to the world we care about what to you father and whatever we do we do it as unto you we do it heartily as unto you lord father not halfway away but just tomorrow to meditate more upon you father and lord jesus to help us to realize that the things that we think about creates our atmosphere we say our environment lord when we think about your word lord it lifts us up into heavenly places in christ jesus father lord we don't act crazy we don't lack stupid we don't do these things just to be that way but lord if we happen back that way because we're happy or something like david and god that's just how it is i'm sure you're pleased with that father when we say hallelujah glory to god praise the lord and everything else little do we do screaming shouting father it's just to bring honor and glory to it's to worship you lord lord for the blessings that you've bestowed upon us lord the great blessing of being able to be called your child your son your daughter is the greatest honor that we could have continue to lead guide us father we're not worried about the future because we know the one that holds the future we ask god you draw us all closer to you now lord in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you i'm gonna shut up they say stand up stick up and shut up god bless you amen amen did you enjoy that tonight
