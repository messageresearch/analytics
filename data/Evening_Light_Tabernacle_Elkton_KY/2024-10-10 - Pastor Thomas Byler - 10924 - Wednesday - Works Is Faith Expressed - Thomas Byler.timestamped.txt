[2:04] head and uh there's a lot of Devastation
[2:07] that we're dealing with uh uh that we're
[2:10] taken up for but there's more on the way
[2:13] according to the meteorologist in
[2:15] Florida so we got a lot to be thankful
[2:17] for tonight want to be praying for our
[2:20] brothers and sisters down there but I
[2:22] just want to give you a quick update of
[2:24] uh where we're at with our project here
[2:26] I I just can't say how how proud I am of
[2:30] everybody that's uh come forward and and
[2:32] made phone calls and got other people
[2:34] involved the community involved and and
[2:38] um you know I was worried if I was just
[2:39] going to have to drive up to Johnson
[2:41] City with a can of green beans well I've
[2:44] got 5400 lbs of food in my trailer and
[2:48] we got another trailer coming to pick up
[2:50] probably that much more to go tomorrow
[2:53] so uh God is
[2:55] awesome and U not not only not only that
[2:59] but just to let you know uh people's
[3:01] been making phone calls and and are
[3:04] wanting to help and what I've got
[3:06] tallied right now um with with the funds
[3:11] that we took up at Church Sunday and the
[3:14] funds that have come in that I know of
[3:16] right now we're pushing
[3:18] $11,500 to take tomorrow and um I know
[3:22] there's more yeah praise the
[3:25] Lord so you know that's that's not
[3:29] anything thing we're we're trying to
[3:30] toot our own horn we're just trying to
[3:32] help those in need and uh I tell you the
[3:35] the hurt and the suffering and the the
[3:37] devastation is more than we'll ever
[3:39] imagine and I'm talking to brother Daryl
[3:42] today and I think they drove 50 miles up
[3:44] into the mountains and he said it just
[3:46] don't stop you know and and they
[3:49] delivered some goods and he said before
[3:51] they could even get out of the truck the
[3:52] people just collapsed in tears and just
[3:54] said you know thank y'all so much so we
[3:57] we just don't know what we'll do we we
[3:59] just don't have nothing so it's going to
[4:01] make a difference and you know and so we
[4:05] just pray that the that they'll find the
[4:06] right people to distribute it to and and
[4:09] people's Got Confidence and I tell you
[4:11] this week has been a big week and I I
[4:14] don't know why but I just felt to do it
[4:16] for two weeks we've got numerous
[4:20] churches that's wanting to join in and
[4:22] help us for next week and so I'm
[4:24] expecting probably this much Goods or
[4:27] more next week we may have to take a
[4:29] tractor and trailer next week uh I know
[4:32] of I think six churches that I know of
[4:35] that have said they're they're want to
[4:36] take it before their congregations

[4:39] different people he knows two churches
[4:42] and so there's one that's contacted me
[4:44] and and two or three more that that are
[4:47] that are talking so um and if you know
[4:50] people it's it's a it's a great it's a
[4:52] it's a great cause that it's going for
[4:54] and people want to help so if they're
[4:56] informed uh you know my father-in-law
[4:59] used to say
[5:00] uh informed people or giving people and
[5:04] so we don't see anything that we've done
[5:06] to to lift ourself it's nothing it's
[5:08] just something the Lord laid on our
[5:10] hearts for and and this congregation has
[5:12] stepped up the community has stepped up

[33:03] the word of God Amen I think most of
[33:05] everything's been taken care of Amen so
[33:08] we'll go amen and uh there's a little
[33:10] quote I mean I couldn't even find the
[33:12] quote so you forgive me for that but I
[33:14] remember brother bandham saying
[33:15] something about you know amen you have
[33:17] to do something for God to bless Amen to
[33:21] for him to be able to bless and so this
[33:23] evening if you will to book go go to the
[33:25] Book of James if you will amen works is
[33:29] Faith expressed is what I titled it amen
[33:32] but I want to talk about actions that
[33:34] God can bless God actions that God can
[33:37] bless and basically we want to talk a
[33:38] little bit amen about amen our actions
[33:42] and so forth
[33:44] Amen in James 2 and verse 20 it says but
[33:48] Willl thou know oh will but will thou
[33:51] know oh vain man that faith without
[33:54] works is dead was not Abraham Our Father
[33:57] father justified by works when he had
[33:59] offered Isaac his son upon the altar if
[34:03] you'll notice it sounds sounds to
[34:05] contradictory to verse um verse 23 which
[34:09] we're fixing to read see us thou how
[34:12] Faith wrought with his works and by work
[34:15] by works his faith was perfected amen so
[34:19] what we got together from that is when
[34:21] you've got works that match your faith
[34:24] then it's complete amen it's perfect
[34:27] perfect when your Works match your faith
[34:32] amen praise the Lord and the scripture
[34:35] was fulfilled that saith Abraham
[34:37] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[34:38] for righteousness and he was called the
[34:41] friend of God see then how that by works
[34:44] a man is Justified and not by faith only
[34:47] likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot
[34:49] justified by works when she had receiv
[34:51] received the messengers and had sent
[34:53] them out in another way for as the body
[34:56] without the spirit is dead so faith
[34:59] without works is dead Also may God add
[35:02] His blessings to the reading of the
[35:03] words you can be seated amen I want to
[35:06] tell take a few stories basically a few
[35:09] illustrations amen down through amen
[35:12] through the scriptures if I can with
[35:14] just the help of the Lord amen I want to
[35:16] take Abraham first of all Abraham now
[35:18] how many knows that Abraham believed God
[35:22] is that right and Abraham believed God
[35:25] and he was imputed unto him for
[35:27] righteous
[35:30] God knew Abraham believed him is that
[35:33] right according to the scriptures even
[35:36] Paul said we're justified by faith
[35:38] now aren't you glad for a prophet
[35:41] because Prophet said you know what Paul
[35:43] said about being justified by faith and
[35:45] Abraham just Abraham was justified by
[35:47] faith he said that's what God saw but
[35:49] what James was talking about is what man
[35:51] saw how many remembers brother BR
[35:54] describing that man the way that man
[35:56] sees that if you say you have faith in
[35:57] and then your Works don't add up to it
[36:00] well it's not very much meaning to it
[36:03] James said faith without works was dead
[36:05] amen how many knows that we are not
[36:08] saved by works we're not talking about
[36:10] you being saved or getting saved by
[36:12] works amen now there is a group of
[36:15] people that get saved by
[36:17] works a that right and hopefully at the
[36:20] end of the service maybe tarand or
[36:22] whenever I feel led to a me we'll go
[36:23] into and look at it but that's not in
[36:25] the bride of Christ that's a different
[36:28] group of people amen different group of
[36:31] people but we're amen Saved By Faith but
[36:35] it's what we do after we're saved and
[36:37] the works that we do God everything that
[36:39] we do amen either God can bless that or
[36:42] he cannot bless that and there's we want
[36:45] to look at some things that God can
[36:46] bless and that God likes amen the things
[36:50] that we do amen now let me just quickly
[36:54] talk a little bit before I go into
[36:56] Abraham talk about something of the
[36:57] things that God does not like actions or
[37:01] works that God don't
[37:06] like
[37:08] okay how about
[37:10] Saul that right Saul when he was
[37:13] commissioned to go and defeat the
[37:15] Philistines I believe it was to go down
[37:17] there and utterly destroy
[37:19] everything that was the command is that
[37:22] right and he went down and he destroyed
[37:24] everything but I think the king and also
[37:27] a lot of sheep and so forth is that
[37:29] right kept the lot of the sheep and
[37:30] brought back and guess what he had them
[37:33] killed and he slaughtered these sheep
[37:34] for the
[37:37] Lord slaughtered all of these sheep for
[37:40] the Lord and boy I'm going to tell you
[37:41] what I'm going to do something I'm going
[37:42] to do this for the
[37:45] Lord and it didn't end
[37:48] well you know because after he had done
[37:50] all of this and Samuel comes and says
[37:53] you know Saul have you done what you
[37:55] were supposed to do and said Paul said
[37:57] I've done the Commandment of the Lord
[38:00] and said why do I then hear the bleeding
[38:02] of these
[38:04] sheep why do I hear the bleeding of the
[38:06] sheep if everything was supposed to be
[38:09] dead amen and the story was the The
[38:12] Final Answer was amen that God loves
[38:16] obedience more than
[38:18] sacrifice so what makes God happy and
[38:21] what pleases the Lord is when we are
[38:25] obedient God looks for those kind of
[38:29] works from us obedience acts of
[38:34] obedience Jesus himself when he was here
[38:37] he said if you love me keep my
[38:41] Commandments in other words do what I
[38:43] say if you want to be pleasing to the
[38:46] Lord and doing something that God can
[38:50] bless amen but Paul I mean Saul was
[38:53] doing something that was not the will of
[38:55] God woo this goes me message people
[38:59] listen I know people that have ideas and
[39:01] they have things and all you know uh you
[39:04] know a certain way that they want to do
[39:05] this that or the other make sure
[39:07] everything's according to the word
[39:09] because you in your enthusiasm if it
[39:12] isn't according to the word of God God
[39:14] is not going to be pleased with it he's
[39:16] not H not going to be happy with it one
[39:19] my voice is really out tonight a't
[39:21] it amen so we look at that we look at
[39:24] him and also look at David is that right
[39:27] right David one time he wanted to bring
[39:29] the ark back didn't he he wanted to
[39:32] bring the Ark of a covenant back and oh
[39:33] it was a good idea was a Godly thing it
[39:36] was awesome thing it was a right
[39:38] thing amen but the Bible says according
[39:40] to brother banam and preaching uh doing
[39:43] God a service without it being his Will
[39:45] said he consulted the H Captain them of
[39:47] hundreds and thousands and the Mighty
[39:49] Men and the noble men he consulted
[39:51] everybody except the man he was supposed
[39:54] to consult which was the prophet
[39:57] never consulted the prophet the captains
[39:59] of Mighty Men and all of these things
[40:02] all had a good ide that's a good idea
[40:04] how many know you can't operate under a
[40:05] good
[40:06] idea it has to be under the inspiration
[40:09] of God it has to be by the word of the
[40:11] Lord and because of that when they about
[40:13] stumbled you know and Men tried to grab
[40:15] that the cart and everything and they
[40:17] got killed and it was a reproach and
[40:19] they came home defeated and sad and
[40:23] blue
[40:25] amen amen because they were doing
[40:27] something and brother brand preached a
[40:29] big message on it doing God a service
[40:32] without it being his will now how many
[40:35] knows he said that about the
[40:37] churches yeah they they oh this is a
[40:40] good idea I think we can do this this
[40:41] out other no no
[40:43] no amen what God wants you to do is do
[40:46] what he told you to do but be obedient
[40:50] to the voice of
[40:51] God Amen and we'll get into that a
[40:54] little bit more so anything that's not
[40:56] according to the will of God
[40:57] Cain was the same way is that right he
[40:59] had
[41:01] church he he worshiped he brought
[41:03] sacrifice he did all of that but it was
[41:06] not according to the will of
[41:09] God Amen and what did God do refuse his
[41:14] offering then he went out with an
[41:18] attitude because this is what I can
[41:20] offer to God and if God don't accept it
[41:23] well then I'm just not going to do it
[41:25] I'm here to tell you if that's your m it
[41:27] you're b g up at the same place gain
[41:30] did amen how many knows we have to line
[41:32] up with God don't try to make God line
[41:34] up with what you're thinking amen what
[41:37] but how blessed it is when you do and
[41:39] can conduct yourself and act according
[41:41] to the word of God and God can bless
[41:43] that he loves that but that's some of
[41:46] the things that some of the works that
[41:48] you don't want amen some of the things
[41:50] you don't want to do amen no matter what
[41:52] the idea or whatever it might be it has
[41:54] to be amen according to what God tells
[41:58] him to do amen David all right Cain
[42:01] Dayan many other illustrations but back
[42:04] to Abraham Now isn't it something how
[42:07] that God seen a Abraham's heart he knew
[42:11] whether he really believed or not he
[42:13] really did believe but yet God tested
[42:17] him he tried him and told him to take
[42:21] his
[42:24] son to do something perhaps that you
[42:26] aren't supposed to do and that's murder
[42:29] your
[42:31] child but he knew it was the voice of
[42:33] God said go do
[42:36] it and what did he do he went and he
[42:38] went all the way up to the top of the
[42:41] mountain is that right made the altar
[42:44] even his son saying here's the sacrifice
[42:47] here's the wood and the fire but where's
[42:48] the
[42:49] sacrifice brother BR preached a many a
[42:51] message on Jehovah Gyra God will provide
[42:54] himself a sacrifice how many believes
[42:56] God Prov Ed himself a sacrifice for you
[42:59] and I amen and whenever he had the Oh my
[43:03] he let him go all the way and the knife
[43:04] coming back and he held his hand and
[43:06] that right stopped him he was going to
[43:09] stab that boy God said kill him I'm
[43:12] going to kill
[43:13] him W Glory how many know that's what
[43:17] God wants out of you that's what God
[43:20] wants out of me if God said it he wants
[43:22] to prove to to uh uh wants you to prove
[43:26] to him that you really believe
[43:29] it so you might say you have faith but
[43:33] get ready God's going to make you prove
[43:35] it now I want to say that God loves
[43:38] Works God loves our
[43:41] actions amen he loves actions he likes
[43:45] to see what we
[43:47] do with what he has already
[43:51] done Ain that right he cares now do you
[43:55] care he loved he gave he went to Calvary
[43:58] now what will we do with what he
[44:02] did and it determines your internal
[44:05] destination don't it it's a pretty big
[44:08] deal
[44:09] amen that's
[44:13] right all
[44:17] right actions that God loves and some
[44:20] actions that God don't like
[44:29] he said in Mark 9 and verse 41 he says
[44:33] for whosoever shall give you a cup of
[44:36] water to drink in my name because ye
[44:40] belong to Christ verily I say unto you
[44:42] you shall not lose he shall not lose his
[44:47] reward you can't give a cup of water to
[44:51] one of God's children but God's going to
[44:54] reward you for it so so you see how many
[44:57] believes God cares about what we
[45:00] do he loves our to see our actions every
[45:06] action that we have always is either
[45:08] blessed or cursed it's either right or
[45:12] it's
[45:14] wrong it's better to have inaction than
[45:17] the wrong
[45:18] action
[45:20] amen there's a time to be still and know
[45:24] that he is God some times God don't want
[45:27] you to do anything but believe just stay
[45:30] there and be
[45:31] still
[45:33] amen all right we're going to go through
[45:35] some of these but that we'll get through
[45:37] the main part of what really God
[45:40] loves okay so he says look that's right
[45:44] a cup of water to one of God's
[45:47] children but on the on the opposite hand
[45:50] now my and this we got to be
[45:54] careful and whosoever shall
[45:58] offend one of these little
[46:01] ones just offend
[46:04] them I am so offended you are so
[46:08] offended this person greatly greatly
[46:12] offended
[46:15] me huh but just to offend one of these
[46:18] little ones that believe in me it's
[46:20] better that a millstone were hanged
[46:22] about his neck and him been drowned in
[46:24] the depth of the SE
[46:27] my gracious thrown overboard in the
[46:30] ocean with a big old weight on your neck
[46:34] what is a millstone I don't know how
[46:35] much a millstone weighs but I'm sure
[46:37] it's enough to take you plenty far
[46:39] down huh so if you offend one you get a
[46:43] reward
[46:45] also many would say Lord help me never
[46:48] to offend one of God's children and if I
[46:51] know I do or did God help me to say I'm
[46:55] sorry make it right
[46:57] right but it just doesn't go unnoticed
[47:00] by
[47:02] God
[47:04] Amen praise the
[47:07] Lord that's
[47:17] right amen 1 Timothy 5'8 says if any
[47:20] provide not for his own and those of his
[47:22] own household in other words if you
[47:24] don't have any Works you're so Heavenly
[47:25] minded you're no Earth good you're worse
[47:28] than an
[47:30] Infidel that right I kind of thought
[47:33] about that when talking about Works
[47:36] people don't want to work don't want to
[47:37] supply for their
[47:38] family don't want to take care of your
[47:40] wife and your children and so forth Paul
[47:42] said you're worse than the Infidel so
[47:44] God looks for Works in that way too Amen
[47:48] in that
[47:49] manner praise the
[47:53] Lord
[47:54] talents remember God give his servants
[47:59] talents and I have a kind of a new
[48:01] revelation you all forgive me if this
[48:03] isn't correct but follow me with this
[48:06] giving us those talents is kind of like
[48:09] money and money is
[48:11] like our lives these talents or should I
[48:15] say these talents are like our
[48:18] lives the way that you spend them
[48:20] whether you profit from it or not is
[48:22] that right the way you invest the way
[48:25] you spend your talents and the way with
[48:27] your talents amen do you gain from it or
[48:29] do you lose from it how many knows our
[48:32] lives are that
[48:33] way you realize that God give us let's
[48:37] say a million dollar of life when that
[48:40] money when that money is spent you're
[48:42] old and you're laying in the deathbed
[48:45] how many know we spend our lives how do
[48:48] you spend your life what do you do with
[48:50] your
[48:51] life amen because every take every
[48:55] moment you're spending it spending it
[48:57] spend it so God cares about what you do
[49:00] and how many knows you'll give an
[49:01] account for your life every thought that
[49:04] you had every word that you spoke every
[49:06] deed that you done you got to give a
[49:09] count God gives you that life now spend
[49:11] it let me see how you do with it that's
[49:13] why I compared it with those talents
[49:15] because it's kind of a spending and see
[49:17] God's going to at the end say well how
[49:19] did you
[49:20] do you accepted me with the life yeah I
[49:23] accepted my my Holy Spirit you got
[49:25] eternal life and how many maybe you
[49:27] gained a couple others maybe you
[49:28] witnessed to somebody else and you
[49:30] gained one or two others brother baham
[49:31] says if we're not winning Souls then
[49:34] we're failing amen trying to get people
[49:37] to
[49:38] God Amen talents is an example of God
[49:41] caring about what you do with what you
[49:44] got
[49:45] amen many other ways and I'm not going
[49:47] to go into this too much but Matthew 5
[49:49] talks about a reward if blessed are you
[49:51] when man people will say all manner of
[49:54] things uh against you falsely
[49:58] and I wrote down here you know if the
[49:59] people accuse you of this and call you
[50:01] that and call you this and mean all
[50:03] kinds of manner it's falsely blessed are
[50:05] you great is your
[50:07] reward Peter said but you know if you
[50:09] get accused of something and it's really
[50:11] true there's not really a reward for
[50:15] that no it has to be falsely called and
[50:18] cast your name out as
[50:21] evil make you look evil when you're good
[50:25] then you get a blessing there's a reward
[50:27] in that God likes that God likes those
[50:30] type of Works turn to your other cheek
[50:32] you know go to the extra mile they ask
[50:34] you this give them that also they did
[50:36] that with Jesus a't that
[50:38] right they accuse you of this and accuse
[50:41] you of that Danny I'm telling you now I
[50:43] saw you do something yesterday you know
[50:46] you did this that and the
[50:48] other and just keep quiet well you know
[50:52] Jesus when he was accused he'd just be
[50:54] quiet and the pilot and says man don't
[50:57] you realize we're accusing you of that
[50:58] stuff you know don't you realize I got
[51:01] the power to release you to save you he
[51:02] says he wouldn't have any power at all
[51:05] they W for my papa up prayer that right
[51:09] for the father you have no power at all
[51:11] he didn't worry about taking care and
[51:13] and trying to justify himself there's
[51:16] times that you do you understand there's
[51:17] a balance in it all amen because when
[51:20] Simon did what he did he says Simon I
[51:22] got something to say to you there's a
[51:24] time to say something and there's a time
[51:26] to be
[51:27] quiet amen I've learned that over the
[51:31] years amen all right praise the
[51:35] Lord
[51:37] amen God cares about whether you say the
[51:42] right thing a that
[51:45] right whether you say the right
[51:48] thing God blesses us according to our
[51:54] word brother brand remember was there
[51:56] and he was testifying of how God had
[51:59] created those squirrels sto stopped the
[52:01] storm he says four times three four
[52:03] times that God did that right he talking
[52:05] about how God stopped the storm and then
[52:07] he created the squirrels and had he
[52:11] right a that right she opened up her
[52:14] mouth and she said something she said
[52:17] that ain't man that ain't nothing but
[52:19] the
[52:22] truth amen and God was so happy with
[52:26] that he liked that so well because how
[52:29] many knows that God isn't brother bam
[52:31] wasn't the one that stopped the storm he
[52:34] just spoke to it because God said speak
[52:36] it was God that stopped the storm I
[52:38] don't know invisible Angels going
[52:42] blowing it back I don't know but it was
[52:44] the power of almighty God blowing that
[52:46] storm back and bringing the sunshine
[52:49] hello it was God that stopped the bull
[52:51] and blinded him and everything ain't
[52:52] that right it's God that stopped the
[52:54] Hornets amen and so he was telling all
[52:57] this and because somebody would believe
[53:00] that and say it ain't nothing but a
[53:02] truth but the truth how many would say
[53:04] that with me this message it is nothing
[53:07] but the
[53:09] truth every story it ain't nothing but
[53:12] the truth amen it might get old to some
[53:14] folks amen even there was a man that
[53:16] said you know butter bam amen your
[53:18] vision was all wonderful until you
[53:20] talked about your horse being up in
[53:21] heaven ain't going to be no horses
[53:23] Heaven ain't for no
[53:24] horses so you see how people get their
[53:27] minds mled
[53:29] up first of all he said that God had
[53:32] given them a vision so if you want to
[53:34] speak against somebody that says God
[53:36] gave me a vision go
[53:39] ahead brother John if you had a vision
[53:42] of something you say God give me a
[53:43] vision it might be questionable I'd
[53:46] rather shut my mouth than no I don't
[53:48] believe it because you can get in
[53:50] trouble for that if God actually did it
[53:53] CU God actually give him the vision of
[53:55] that horse and so forth this man didn't
[53:57] believe
[53:58] it and mean I'm sure he was rewarded for
[54:01] it and oh my my brother Brandon came
[54:05] back and says oh really well isn't that
[54:07] something over in Revelations when he
[54:09] comes back from the heavens of Heaven
[54:11] the Bible says he's on a white horse and
[54:13] he says all the hosts of Heaven are the
[54:15] white horse is with them shut up
[54:20] already you
[54:23] unbeliever said the wrong thing
[54:35] don't know the story just exactly y'all
[54:37] might be able to tell me afterwards but
[54:38] didn't somebody see that picture and say
[54:40] something positive about it and got
[54:41] healed right on the
[54:43] spot I feel if I'm not wrong somebody
[54:45] said something right about that picture
[54:47] in the Halo and they were healed because
[54:48] of it you me I'm amen sure
[54:53] why how many believes that what you say
[54:56] about that right there you're saying
[54:58] about God cuz God took his picture he
[55:02] went through the trouble of not letting
[55:03] anything else be
[55:05] developed and except for the him and his
[55:08] power amen the pillar of
[55:10] fire who in the world would want to say
[55:13] something negative about that watch your
[55:17] mouth God is
[55:20] listening he's watching your actions
[55:22] he's watching your
[55:24] words but I thought oh my God was so
[55:27] pleased with Hattie's response and I

[55:30] with every one of us Lord help me to say
[55:33] the right
[55:35] thing boy I'll tell you if one of us is

[55:48] I don't reckon it
[55:50] is been there done that heard that
[55:53] knowed it ain't the right thing and
[55:55] somebody goes through a hard time and
[55:57] then you're down on them amen why well

[56:13] words brother B says if I've told you
[56:16] the truth had it right just now there's
[56:18] like a wind or something that came into
[56:19] the room amen and that voice said tell
[56:21] her that because of what she said you
[56:24] get ask whatever you want
[56:27] and you'll be it'll be in your lap if
[56:29] it's not I'm a false prophet one of the
[56:32] first things he mentioned he says well
[56:34] you're poor you're up on the Hills you
[56:35] could ask for
[56:37] money that was one of the first things I
[56:40] read it second is of course her children
[56:42] and then her mom and dad at her age and
[56:45] so forth different things but what's the
[56:47] most what's the greatest thing you
[56:48] desire she said my
[56:50] boys and Bam they come and laid on her
[56:53] lap a that right God help us if you want
[56:57] to be blessed let your actions in your
[57:00] mouth say the right thing Lord help us

[57:08] thing
[57:10] amen praise the
[57:15] Lord amen praise the
[57:19] Lord God
[57:21] loves when we say the right words
[57:24] biblically in the Bible somebody said
[57:25] the right right word right I believe it
[57:29] was a Samaritan woman
[57:31] Gentile that was following Jesus needed
[57:34] healing amen for her daughter I believe
[57:38] it was amen and she followed him and
[57:40] followed and and followed him and
[57:42] wouldn't answer wouldn't answer her or
[57:44] anything you know and then finally he
[57:45] answered it's not meat to give the
[57:46] children's bread to
[57:48] dogs but she said the right thing she
[57:51] says yay Lord amen anybody that's a
[57:54] Christian will always agree yes Lord
[57:55] You're right you're right Lord that's
[57:59] true but you know what there's dogs
[58:03] sometimes under the table and if there's
[58:05] a crumb that falls anybody of us have H
[58:07] dogs you know you better not drop it

[58:11] snatch it up dogs eat the crumbs that
[58:13] fall from the master's
[58:15] table amen why she said the right
[58:20] word be it unto you according to your
[58:24] faith it's what he said
[58:27] amen what about the the soldier the
[58:30] Centurion I believe it is ain't that
[58:32] right amen he had one of his servants
[58:34] that needed healing and Jesus offered to
[58:37] come to his
[58:39] house offered to come to his house I'll
[58:41] come to your house he said no you don't
[58:42] have to come I'm not worthy such
[58:45] respect how many believe that God loves
[58:48] respect of people if you want to have a
[58:51] great reward if you want to have your
[58:52] life saturated with almighty God and
[58:55] blessing re respect
[58:58] god with your life and everything you do

[59:19] the word and if you would just say the
[59:22] word I know it'll be

[59:27] found this great a faith in
[59:29] Israel just speak the word let me tell
[59:33] you something how many believes he has
[59:34] spoken the word if you'll just believe
[59:37] that word God loves for you just to
[59:39] believe what he
[59:43] said and you'll be rewarded
[59:49] accordingly amen
[1:00:04] amen I'll go count down this this a
[1:00:07] little bit make God loves for you to
[1:00:10] make the right
[1:00:15] choice make the right
[1:00:19] choice remember that prophecy that
[1:00:22] Frenchman spoke over brother Brandon
[1:00:23] when he was coming up there to tell him
[1:00:25] say hey that could be the 23rd chapter
[1:00:28] of Revelations I think there's 22 and he
[1:00:31] was knocking him at the 23rd chapter of
[1:00:33] Revelations not really biblical or
[1:00:35] whatever and instead of saying sat all
[1:00:37] of a sudden he spoke in tongues and
[1:00:38] other spoke in tongues amen and all of
[1:00:41] that came back and he says because you
[1:00:42] have chosen the harder
[1:00:44] way amen you've made the correct and
[1:00:47] precise decision and because of this
[1:00:50] momentous decision a huge portion of
[1:00:53] Heaven awaits you see when the brother
[1:00:56] when it go when the going got hard when
[1:00:58] people offered him airplane rids and
[1:01:00] everything taken care of just let up a
[1:01:02] little bit on the godhead and the water
[1:01:04] baptism and women done all this that or
[1:01:06] the other is that what he wanted him to
[1:01:07] do but he said no uhuh this is my very
[1:01:11] car he chose the harder way the harder
[1:01:14] path and God said you have chosen my way
[1:01:16] and because of that you and I is going
[1:01:19] to be waiting on him over
[1:01:21] there well maybe not he's over there
[1:01:24] already we got to go over there to meet
[1:01:26] him is that right that's right but a
[1:01:30] huge portion of Heaven
[1:01:32] millions are going to be waiting for him
[1:01:35] over there because he made the right
[1:01:36] choice God loved that he made the right
[1:01:39] he loves when you make the right
[1:01:43] choice
[1:01:45] amen Lord help us to make good
[1:01:47] choices
[1:01:49] amen praise the Lord when you're
[1:01:51] claiming your healing or you need
[1:01:53] anything from God Amen he loves when you
[1:01:55] confess it before you ever see it be go
[1:01:57] go out there and begin to confess it say
[1:02:00] I'm Healed I'm healed amen sometimes
[1:02:03] faith is an
[1:02:05] act I know sometimes faith is an
[1:02:09] act because sometimes you get into
[1:02:11] situations and you got to choose whether
[1:02:13] you're going to complain not believe or
[1:02:15] whether you're going to say I believe
[1:02:16] God on this it's an
[1:02:20] act
[1:02:24] amen three Hebrews children they didn't
[1:02:27] know whether God was they made the right
[1:02:29] choice they said we don't know whether
[1:02:30] God will or not but God loves an
[1:02:33] attitude of
[1:02:38] perseverance determination how many know
[1:02:41] God loves that but Robinson he could
[1:02:44] never get the Holy Ghost couldn't get
[1:02:45] the Holy Ghost and couldn't get overcome
[1:02:47] his temper and everything else amen
[1:02:48] until one day he got
[1:02:50] real he got real
[1:02:52] desperate stopped his mules or whatever
[1:02:55] got in there and to plow and everything
[1:02:57] in the corn field and said man if you
[1:02:58] don't come and give me the Holy Ghost
[1:03:00] you'll find a pile of
[1:03:02] B that's right another place he says
[1:03:06] Lord give me uh the Holy Ghost let me
[1:03:10] fight the devil till I ain't got a no
[1:03:12] tooth left and then let me gum him till
[1:03:15] I
[1:03:17] die God loves that type of stuff he
[1:03:20] loves people that are
[1:03:23] persevering amen
[1:03:25] not wishy-washy I heard brother baham
[1:03:27] say if you have faith like well maybe if
[1:03:30] God wants me to have it then I'll get it
[1:03:32] if not I get he says you ain't never
[1:03:33] getting it that way you got to say it's
[1:03:36] mine I believe it don't have Hazard it
[1:03:39] say it's yours God loves you to do have
[1:03:41] that kind of attitude to believe in that
[1:03:44] way amen if you looking for healing or
[1:03:47] whatever it might be you know and you
[1:03:50] can't let didn't he say one time you
[1:03:51] can't move your arm or fingers but amen
[1:03:53] just one little finger start moving that
[1:03:55] finger
[1:03:56] amen if you're un crutch this for them
[1:03:58] crutches just start believing God loves
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:04] amen praise be to
[1:04:09] God the lepers he loves the attitude of
[1:04:12] those five lepers over in Kings Four
[1:04:15] lepers I mean amen they said one to
[1:04:18] another why sit we here until we die if
[1:04:21] we say we will enter into the city then
[1:04:24] the famine is in the city and we shall
[1:04:26] die there and if we sit here we die also
[1:04:29] now therefore come and let us fall on
[1:04:31] the host of the syrians if the sav is
[1:04:33] alive we shall live and if they kill us
[1:04:36] we shall but
[1:04:37] die I thought sometimes you know just
[1:04:40] just no way direction to go maybe
[1:04:44] there's God forces you to absolutely
[1:04:46] just be able to go One Direction well
[1:04:48] then go in that
[1:04:51] direction when God closes all other
[1:04:54] doors go to the one that's
[1:04:56] open have a little faith they didn't
[1:04:59] know they said we might not we're
[1:05:00] definitely going to die here if you're
[1:05:03] in a bad place in a bad way don't stay
[1:05:06] there see I'm getting out of this place
[1:05:09] in this way there's a better way amen I
[1:05:12] like their
[1:05:14] attitude and what happened because of it
[1:05:16] God liked it he liked it so well that
[1:05:19] them were the guys that came back and
[1:05:21] told the Israelites hey they're all dead
[1:05:23] over there no ah they're not yes they
[1:05:27] are them guys were a little bit they
[1:05:29] were they were a little bit listen to
[1:05:31] this I love the way these guys the Lord
[1:05:33] made the host of the syrians to hear a
[1:05:35] noise of Chariots noise of horses even a
[1:05:38] noise of a a mighty host and they said
[1:05:40] one to another Lord the king of Israel
[1:05:42] has hired somebody against us the
[1:05:44] Hittites the Egyptians to come upon they
[1:05:46] fled they arose and fled into Twilight
[1:05:49] and left their tents and horses and
[1:05:50] asses and Camp just like it was and fled
[1:05:53] for their life the lepers came to the
[1:05:56] utmost part of C they had went went into
[1:05:58] one t tent they drank they ate woo huh
[1:06:03] just the chapter before that in the city
[1:06:05] where it was a famine a woman had come
[1:06:08] to the king and said hey I want you to
[1:06:10] give me something to eat because
[1:06:11] yesterday me and another woman agreed
[1:06:13] that we would eat my baby today and hers
[1:06:16] tomorrow we ate and cooked my baby today
[1:06:18] and now the next day came and she hid
[1:06:20] her
[1:06:21] child that's the kind of famine it was
[1:06:25] pretty B
[1:06:28] dead praise God for
[1:06:31] Walmarts fellow Americans that'll help
[1:06:33] us when we get in need ain't that right
[1:06:36] we ain't got to boil nobody's
[1:06:39] baby but anyway the point was look at
[1:06:42] that they went there they carried thin
[1:06:45] silver and gold and rment went and hid
[1:06:47] it and came again and did it another one
[1:06:49] and did they went to hideing some
[1:06:52] stuff I'm here to tell you when you
[1:06:54] follow the lord and the leading of the
[1:06:56] lord it's a blessed thing are you with
[1:06:58] me just follow the leading of the
[1:07:01] spirit amen praise the
[1:07:06] Lord all
[1:07:08] right praise the Lord now let's talk a
[1:07:12] little bit about one of the things that
[1:07:15] God loves the best that he loves to see
[1:07:17] the best about
[1:07:19] us he likes to see our
[1:07:22] works he likes to see what we do
[1:07:27] or how we act to his
[1:07:32] action it's called an action or a
[1:07:36] reaction to an action that's what he
[1:07:39] like he really likes
[1:07:41] that
[1:07:43] amen it's when your faith is really
[1:07:46] being put to the test like he did
[1:07:48] Abraham he wanted to see how Abraham
[1:07:50] would
[1:07:51] squirm how Abraham would this doesn't
[1:07:55] make a lot of sense he gave me Isaac
[1:07:57] waited 25 years to get it and now God
[1:07:59] wants me to kill it how many beliefs he
[1:08:02] had to cast out all of his Common
[1:08:07] Sense there was times that brother
[1:08:09] Brandon would go back into scriptures
[1:08:11] because he'd hear that voice say certain
[1:08:13] things and he says well let me see if
[1:08:14] that's scriptural is't that right no
[1:08:17] doubt Abraham had to do that let me see
[1:08:19] if that's
[1:08:20] scriptural
[1:08:23] amen he fought with it no doubt but he
[1:08:25] knew that that was that voice that same
[1:08:27] voice that said I'll give you here your
[1:08:29] son that right so he followed it and
[1:08:31] believed
[1:08:35] it
[1:08:40] amen Abraham the knife
[1:08:45] up do you think in his mind he says I'm
[1:08:47] gonna I'm gonna bring this thing down
[1:08:49] just to here but I'm going to stop just
[1:08:51] before it is because I can't do it but
[1:08:54] you think he thought that or when he
[1:08:57] raised that hand back do you not imagine
[1:08:59] that he was going all the way with it
[1:09:02] yeah and the voice had to said
[1:09:05] stop
[1:09:06] stop right on time how many believ God
[1:09:09] sees us and watches every move we make
[1:09:12] he watches our actions and he loves to
[1:09:14] see our reaction the way we React to
[1:09:17] what God allows to come our
[1:09:21] way because it's a lot of times easy to
[1:09:23] premeditate something
[1:09:26] premeditate something but when there's a
[1:09:28] no premeditation in it
[1:09:33] amen no
[1:09:35] premeditation God loves to see your
[1:09:38] reaction
[1:09:43] amen he tests us to the
[1:09:46] utmost how many believes that we're not
[1:09:49] immune we're not exempt from God's
[1:09:53] testing us and trying us he did everyone
[1:09:56] all everyone that comes to God must be
[1:09:59] tried the Bible says You must be tested
[1:10:02] he will test you he'll allow things to
[1:10:04] come your way to see how you react to it
[1:10:08] to see whether you really have faith in
[1:10:10] God or whether or you
[1:10:12] don't that
[1:10:15] right we all know that the Israelites
[1:10:18] went out with three million people
[1:10:21] Joshua Caleb and the and the parents'
[1:10:24] children went in but all of those three
[1:10:27] millions perished in the wilderness
[1:10:29] because God kept testing them they he
[1:10:32] kept trying them he kept watching their
[1:10:36] reaction to his
[1:10:38] actions he let him get hungry he let him
[1:10:41] get thirsty he let him come up against
[1:10:43] the Red
[1:10:44] Sea get trapped every
[1:10:49] manner we love
[1:10:52] history we love to hear history but
[1:10:55] sometimes we don't like when God does it
[1:10:57] to
[1:10:59] us it's a different story when it
[1:11:01] happens to you when it happens to
[1:11:05] me it's not as
[1:11:09] easy I want to tell you something oh I
[1:11:12] hope nobody gets mad at me for this but
[1:11:13] I want you to know that God is
[1:11:16] smart he's smart he can outsmart you any
[1:11:19] day of the week and when you think you
[1:11:21] got it whipped he will come at you in a
[1:11:23] way that you're not expecting to him to
[1:11:26] come at
[1:11:27] you he'll get you off guard to see your
[1:11:32] reaction how many believe that well I
[1:11:35] know this now so I'll be careful I'll
[1:11:37] know that now so I'll be care you don't
[1:11:39] know nothing you just better be on your
[1:11:41] prayer bones and say God when this thing
[1:11:43] happens and that unexpected thing comes
[1:11:45] into my life help me to react in the
[1:11:48] right way how many want to say that Lord
[1:11:50] when that unexpected thing happens in my
[1:11:52] life that I don't like that man it's
[1:11:54] just out of nowhere how it ever happen
[1:11:57] I'm a Child of God I do everything that
[1:11:58] I'm supposed to do and here this happens
[1:12:00] to me huh let's watch how you
[1:12:05] react that's what God loves to do he
[1:12:08] loves to see your actions see what you
[1:12:10] do that's why he did it to Abraham if he
[1:12:12] did it to Abraham he does it to all of
[1:12:13] his seed after him everybody that comes
[1:12:16] to God must be tried and tested and we

[1:14:42] unbelief the token brother B says man
[1:14:45] outside of full obedience to the full
[1:14:48] word of God that's the only thing that
[1:14:50] entitles you to the
[1:14:52] Token amen

[1:14:58] just simply obey what he said let your
[1:15:01] actions be simple
[1:15:05] obedience simple
[1:15:08] obedience more than any other sacrifice
[1:15:12] that you could make to God if you just
[1:15:14] simply obey him that is pleasing to

[1:15:29] Lord God's actions was to send this
[1:15:32] world this generation a
[1:15:35] message ain't that right God's actions
[1:15:38] was to prove it
[1:15:40] infallible he had a man to sacrifice his
[1:15:43] life and guess what God was working in
[1:15:47] this generation he was busy Christ was
[1:15:49] busy always coming to the platform
[1:15:52] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:15:53] the heart to show the World

[1:15:59] react to
[1:16:00] that amen I don't know about you but I
[1:16:04] hope we all would say this message is
[1:16:07] nothing but the
[1:16:09] truth let's all say it this message is
[1:16:12] nothing but the truth God deserves that
[1:16:16] because he came and confirmed it so
[1:16:18] you'd have something to follow and know
[1:16:20] what was right pic had right could say
[1:16:23] that's nothing but the truth for just
[1:16:25] those things that he was talking about
[1:16:27] Lord help us to say this message is
[1:16:29] nothing but the truth I believe it with
[1:16:32] all of my heart and I believe it's
[1:16:34] pleasing to
[1:16:36] God do you reckon that God is very
[1:16:38] pleased with these preachers that are
[1:16:40] going around and say well brother

[1:16:48] don't line
[1:16:50] up amen I've listened to I didn't really
[1:16:52] want to listen to these preachers

[1:16:56] would had but on YouTube one of them
[1:16:58] give him their testimonies one
[1:17:01] Ohio and and
[1:17:03] and Lonnie jenin son I'm going to just
[1:17:05] call the name he gave a testimony of why

[1:17:10] church and all of that he did and I'm
[1:17:13] here to tell you the Folly in the man
[1:17:17] was not it was to me it wasn't close oh
[1:17:20] I believe he was a prophet I believe he
[1:17:22] was a prophet but where did he have the
[1:17:24] right to do this and where did he have
[1:17:26] the right to put this here and that
[1:17:29] there and I'm like boy are you
[1:17:32] stupid he was a prophet that's what give
[1:17:35] him the
[1:17:36] right and who do you think you are to
[1:17:38] say he's wrong who in the world do you
[1:17:42] think you are to say he's wrong he's the
[1:17:45] prophet not you and who in the world do
[1:17:47] you put yourself above the prophet
[1:17:50] that's what he did when I watched it I
[1:17:52] was like boy this is isn't even close
[1:17:53] this isn't even deceiving
