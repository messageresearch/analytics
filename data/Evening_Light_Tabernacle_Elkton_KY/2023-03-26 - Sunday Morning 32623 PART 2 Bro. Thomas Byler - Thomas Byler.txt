TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hey man it's been so long why the whole holy spirit will just search throughout the whole thing amen and I got to thinking because this the thing of looking has you know you can see this in different ways you know because if the Bible talks about seek the Lord while he might be found amen and it says without faith it's possible to please God Amen for they that come to God I must believe he is and that he is a rewarder of them that what diligently looked for him or seek Him for someone you're looking for seeking something or look for something because guys think you're in there now we know the prophet said that no man seeks after God and so forth because God has to put that Seeker in there and when he puts that seeking ability in there amen Pentecost and Azusa Street happen when people would pray eight hours a day seeking his faith God honored they're seeking how many God honors their prayers you know in just this little bit you know that I know that we've got a little bit of a um a prayer Club going on right a little prayer Club going on and as soon as these issues come up and everybody got the friend look at what happened look at the different ones that were raised up and things that happened you know that Beyond science beyond what the dog just said um who was it uh Rebecca Hefner I guess she lost the leg but something like that you know the others had caught it and she got they died you know and so you think about whenever it's expired it's God's got to be God and spare somebody like that you know but I want you my focus this morning is when you see God and when you pray you know it works amen God hears that God Honors that and we ought to do that more are you with me this morning amen so you know there's a different different things they don't really seek after him amen amen blessed are they that hungerth thirsts after righteousness no be filled seek and ye shall find aren't you glad that you can look for God and you can see him and you can find him you want more God you can find it you want a deeper walk with God it's there but boy you got to overcome every thought the devil puts in your mind every distraction that he tries to distract you with you got to start blocking that stuff out amen how many believe that because we've got a lot of junk flying around there's a whole lot of junk that wants to come into your mind I'll tell you responsibilities and worldly cares and problems and everything else and you gotta say God I don't want to hear all of that I don't want to see all of that all I want to see is you because I want you to know something that oh whether it was in Ephesians whether it was Paul or whether it was John it's us and without in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God it was made flesh him and dwell Among Us he says in the beginning he says God created All Things by Jesus Christ he made everything and evil without him there was not anything made that was made when you look again the look of God you begin to look into him as the creator of all things Apollo address it in Jesus he says we're talking about the God that made everything because begin to look at the Great Mighty God one other place he says look unto the heels from where your strength comes from amen maybe not too much in the Hills but the god that made the Hills ah when you begin to look at creation it can do a lot for you isn't that right brother Brandon people preach to sell a message called the paradox you talked about the sun moon to creation and it's a paradox it's all a miracle isn't that something how God can be everywhere he made everything amen things that science can't explain how everything works together and people still can't see God I've come to the conclusion wrote it in my notes here he says you know the demon Jesus said he says they have eyes but they see not amen they think you see but they don't see because why because you've got to see with the eyes of your understanding but blessed are your eyes for they see so let me tell you it's amazing grace How Sweet the Sound if you can see anything if you can see grace if you can see salvation if you can turn alive it'll because God opens your understanding opens your mind opens your thoughts I'm determined that we don't need it just for salvation you have to have grace Amazing Grace that has to Open the Eyes of your understanding isn't that right to be able to see him and that's my focus and why do you want to preach on look well when I when look come into mind and it's that's exactly what we're doing isn't it we are looking at him we're looking at what he's worthy of we're looking at what he's worthy to receive amen Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and look fully in the wonderful face and the things of this Earth will grow strangely dim you know how many things other things everybody is looking at you know how easy it is to look at other things other than Jesus Christ it's real easy to do and the world is certainly doing it but I believe we've got to keep our eyes on Jesus we need to get our eyes on him amen praise the Lord oh my we have to have the understanding let me just say this and that is you know I truly believe that every thought that comes to your mind when somebody talks to you about something you know it's important that person understands what you're talking about huh isn't that right sometimes it's a little hard but let me say it this way and you'll say it wait and then you say oh I see yeah what you mean now amen because it starts the comments and so forth and it's the same way let me say this with our everyday life without everything that we think all the problems no matter what comes up in your life you need God to open up your thoughts in your mind and your eyes to be able to see direction to go what to do are you with me well I'll need God's Direction we need him to open our eyes to see how to walk because if you aren't careful you will think they're all thought and if you don't catch God's thought and God's mind on it you'll do the wrong thing you'll mess up [Applause] yeah we all are we're all a witness that whenever you do the wrong thing if you think the wrong thing don't have the right answer huh buddy I've done it way too many times uh-huh glory to God and I also want to I want to you know I also want to speak and bring into this morning the eagle story the story of the eagle amen but I wanna before we do I want to talk about how that job just talked about job for just a minute it might seem like we're jumping or jumping around but I may know that job was a blessed man he had sheep and oxen and children and houses and lands and he was blessed by God beyond what you can imagine huh that received riches and power and glory and strength yet all those things he had wealth richest and God took it all away he lost his children a lot his ox and look us everything lost all of it you know and he says the Bible says in job and then job arose and rents his mantle shaved his head and fell down on the ground and worshiped and sat naked came out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return feather the lord gave and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord oh my can you imagine this man had his roots planted huh his roots were so deep that the great storms that come his way could not blow him over how many seen trees blown over lately these straight winds that have come through anything that could be blown over was blown over they Blaze that if you're not grounded in Christ in this hour the first little storm that comes over amen they're gonna blow you over huh but not Joe and notice here how that job says I like it he says God gave how many knows anything you have God gave you what's God gave me that God gave me that the Lord can take it away anytime he wants job says he could give me riches he'd give me all this why for one thing since he made without him there was not anything was made there was absolutely nothing that was nothing but God by himself so whatever comes forth from that is tears it belongs to him let me believe that everything you have all your riches it don't matter what it is it belongs to God oh my and it God can take it away from you in a day's time he gave it he's got a right to take it away if he chooses to his our strength our youth anything you have God gave it to you that's why I want to praise God with what a God whatever God give me [Music] I wonder why the weapon with everything I got it it was everything you got cause he's the one that gives it then it belongs to him whoa Hallelujah foreign idea didn't he he knew where he'd come from he is worthy to receive it 'll be taking it away bless it be the name of the Lord Hallelujah amen Glory it all my point is It All Belongs to him even your breath your health um thank you what Good's going to do if you gain the whole world and you find out you have terminal cancer you're going to die all the things in the world isn't going to matter to you anymore you're going to think about what your future holds where you're here amen praise the Lord how many knows none of these things can come upon us unless it's permitted of almighty God Hallelujah I actually glance that because then you can have faith hey if God allotted it he cannot also take it away he can take care of it he'll take care of it amen so this morning we want to focus amen looking at God's power all right it belongs to him and the reason part of that I wanted to go to the eagle story and look take a look at the Eagle story was because when I thought about power two things come to mind one of them was in Romans 9 and verse 17 it says for this scripture sayeth unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in you hey man I didn't have time to uh uh pull it up and so forth and pull a bunch of quotes on but you'll know what I'm talking about how did one brother Bannon was talking about that mother eat mother Eagle flopping her Wing isn't that right how did she like to show those little eaglets her power even brother Brown says God loves to show his power he wants you to understand that he is a powerful he wants you to see his power the lamb was worthy of power oh we brag about so many different things the world and many fantasizes itself and glorifies I don't care whether it's tractor pulls or whatever and the power to share power oh my I'll tell you what would you think about God's power and how to make Shivers run up your back Oh Glory think about that he said I raised you up Pharaoh so that I could show my power in you amen amen and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth I have no so a little thought that is anybody probably puts it this way I think that anybody that ever amounted to a hill of beans but I'll put it this way anybody that's notable in history that we talk about that's worth talking about has been people who has put their confidence and their faith in almighty God that has looked to God that's why amen when Brother Brad was talking about David oh can you know all the time that David said God if my refuge is my shield here's my butler here's my defense and I thought he's also my offense he's not just my defense but he's my offense he's everything he's a strong power the righteous run into it that are safe that's why David was so great because he relied on almighty God and the power of almighty God I believe it was tall and said I don't come to you with enticing words of man's Wisdom but I come to you in the power of the spirits of your faith but not rest and the wisdom of man but it would rise to the power of God all right hey man how many believe that amen into power of almighty God that's what we're going to rest our faith now power and strength to me or same thing amen is that right power and strength something that's strong or powerful amen it's glory that's what God it's his foreign I couldn't do that if it wasn't for God huh you would have no power you would have no strength if it wasn't for God we certainly wouldn't have any spiritual strength amen not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord how many believe you ain't got power you ain't got nothing unless you got that spirit it's by God's spirit and God is allowed you to have his holy ghost is what gives you power you shall receive power or authority after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you all right that's further down Lord help us open my eyes Lord to see your salvation open my eyes Lord to see your great wonderful works that you've made in your creation oh Lord my God when I an awesome Wonder consider all the worlds the hands I've made I see the stars I hear The Rolling Thunder thy power throughout the Universe displayed that sings My I saw my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art [Music] you can have a Revival folks if you'll just open up your mind open up your heart begin to look at God and to see God amen all right how about another one is before we get into our thoughts let's talk about the brass serpent isn't that right now I believe it is also Isaiah 44 nope that's not the one we'll try Isaiah 45 verse 22 it says look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else look unto me just look this direction just look at him when Israel had sinned and they murmured and complained remember fiery serpents beat him I can imagine there were snakes in their beds under their sheets they couldn't get away from these serpents and these snakes and I think anybody that's a murmur and a complainer is a little bit snake bit huh God don't like murmurs complainers you don't have much for them he loves to put you in a real bind and see if you'll murmur and complain in a real pinch see if your murmur and compete at Israel let the Red Sea did he didn't feed him you know he let him get good and hungry then they'd let him get good and thirsty they complained every time huh Lord how many of those we have no room for complaining amen though he slayed me yeah I'll trust him fiery serpents and so Moses put up a brass surfing on a pole I guess they still have it on the Avenue says don't they a sign of healing and all they had to do oh boy but can you imagine that the the penalty and for I mean the the hmm the condition the condition to live was to look in other words if you want to live just look look and live look and live look to Jesus Christ and live it's recorded in God's word hallelujah it's only that we look and live amen I'm at least it was a symbol of what Christ would do on Jesus on the cross all you gotta do is look the coward if you want to live look and live amen what power amen oh look look now we want to pick up Luke in the middle of my story again let's start with the eagle story of a little bit shall we amen as the eagle Sears or nest if you want to read it and listen to it it's great for the brand and watched Eagles I don't know much about them I just go by what the prophet do about eagles how that he would take them in the clefs of The Rock and he would take him way up out of danger no coyotes and all of that wouldn't get to him in there right and kick him way up there and take sheepskin and so forth kill a sheep and take that good wool and put it bad down in there lay the eggs and hatch them things and they come out and it'd be all nice and cozy and soft oh they'd be happy mama would feed them food feed them food oh man that's just like a person born again huh amen come into the message of the hour I believe God sent a prophet oh God doesn't work amen you believe what Jesus did on Calvary amen something happens oh man you just love everybody and you think everybody loves you you think everybody's perfect and everybody's just a perfect Christian ah oh it's just so sweet it's just so nice it's just so comfortable but those eagles grow and they grow and they grow and they grow until they get feathers huh and they get bigger feathers and bigger feathers and they're almost ready to fly they're flopping around in there but they got a lot of loose feathers yet and by the back describe this great Mama Eagle is coming around there and coming to the Cliffs of the rocking amen and he comes up there and there's 14 Wings panties and gets in front of them and just fans them and fans them knocks out all the food loose feathers and she's saying look at me look at me look at my power huh amen look at my power that's what I like to look at don't you look at my two ways the Old Testament the New Testament that many knows how do we receive power where's the power really lay the power lays in faith huh how does faith come faith it comes by hearing hearing what the Old Testament The Testament let's just admit it that the Old Testament it's still got power there's some power in talking about David it's your power and talking about sham God there shall talk by Power by talking about them Old Testament look at what I did for sham God look what I did for David I delivered them I delivered it from the part of the baron from the mouth of the line I delivered it from that sword of Goliath look at me that wasn't David that was me look at me Hallelujah when you look at him and you realize he's the same yesterday and forever oh my look at my strength had Israel way down in Egypt they were all captive they were slaves for many hundreds of years slaves bondage not take one man that I deliver them with my power huh that wasn't Moses that was me brought him out of the land of Egypt brought him out into the wilderness it was me power to deliver amen I allowed him to come to the Red Sea trap amen I had the Testament I had to try them just like he'll take that little eagle tell them to jump on my back clinch on because we're gonna go for a little ride is that right take them Eagles out there and he takes out them in the middle way up in the air and shakes that last thing off things ain't gone so good anymore shits topsy-turvy it's toppling amen the first time you get a trial first time somebody says something against you does something oh you just get all flustered man everything else tears you up but you ain't learned to fly yet you got to learn to fly you gotta learn to let nothing's bother you so bad you gotta learn to trust in your wings praise be to God oh my Texan not so comfortable but anymore oh my God but let me just go along before I leave before that route let's look at some more God so it takes them out there amen brings them to that place of testing or trying to see what he has and then he says you know if I need to I just doesn't matter it's my power that can take the Red Sea I can make water stand on end not just water stand on hand but the forefoot of mud underneath I can drive up instantly if I need to that's my power Glory aren't you glad to God make a way for his children I feel like standing on my head right now he can make a way for you he'll make a way for you if his child trust in his power [Music] Glory [Music] all right let me pick up another story and we'll try to keep the two stories somewhere together Abraham then another man preach on Abraham leave as an old man his wife is old and feeble and man they were like a little baby fretting and crying and oh man I don't know for sure if it'll ever come to pass maybe you ought to try Hagar maybe this out of the other never threatened and they were all never feeble but amen he came to him in the name of how shady I which means the breasted God not just one breath but he had two breaths and he said it's like a little baby that's fattened amen when he gets on his mother espresso it just gets it's a humming and it just gets all satisfied hey man that's what Abraham to do he had that milky at the amen street from the fathers amen from the uh Jehovah's breath so to speak he had the nourish himself would get strength again I want you to understand as we get all the revebler it's easy to get to fretting oh I can't do this and I can't do that oh this is team leggings that deal we're gonna justifying and a friend huh but what we do we look at the promise we look at what God has done in the Old Testament we look what he's not in the know amen even when Peter I mean he says the gold and silver halfway nine but sections we have give way unto you in the name of Jesus Christ amen Abraham had to drink from the promises of God said it God told me I'd have a son I'm 99 and I'm telling you this walker is he's gonna do me this king is just not gonna do good my wife's been me and my wife hadn't been able had no babies or even a relationship for 25 years amen it don't look like it's going to be able to happen but he says God said it I believe it the Bible says in the New Testament God never even saw a staggering he said he said it not at the promises of God but was strong in faith believing Glory Hallelujah aren't you glad and I don't care what you need is look to God look at what God can do where else can we love where could you else look nowhere else not just a god amen I'll feed the history true God was with brother Branham sure God was with Paul Irene as Martin Luther and all of those that was with all of those but God is here this morning how maybe she's just as well this morning as he ever was but you gotta open up the eyes of your understanding and say God help me to understand that you said it I believe it that samples that live or die amen that's right Israel after he parted the Red Sea amen be part of the Red Sea still showing how great he was look at look at the Old Testament got out there in the wilderness there was no food got hungry huh what happened if God has to heal rain Birds Quail or whatever it was rained down quail and fed them there oh my the Bible says that while we're still the meat was still stuck in their teeth had a tooth picking it out well I'll tell you what I'm so thirsty I don't know why God lets us get so thirsty I wish you writers just stayed in Egypt we're going to die if we don't get in a lot of pick up some weeds you see what I got God damned him all of them lost the Bible says to everyone who's dead Jesus said because still had me picking the meat out of their teeth so to speak amen well if meat was still in their mouth they would complain about something else this is one preacher that loves it really hammer on complaining and murmuring I ain't got time for it I'm too old for it amen [Music] I love him oh my that's right I'm thankful I don't have a bunch of complaining complainers ain't nobody complaining to me so praise God if you have to I'm your pastor I'll listen to you I'll pray with you I love you I'm Still Human I might do a little myself huh isn't that the truth but we're not supposed to we're supposed to get a little higher than that I was looking to a date the other day he says man it's time to church there's no more children anymore but grown men now he says it's time for the church to be mature now I believe that I thought hey man that's right it's time for us I grown up not fussing with one now they're in bickering about that and bickering about this and fussing and humans I don't believe in bickering fussing and arguing about Doctrine or difference I know what I believe how many knows you

the science would tell you scientists would tell you if the Sun or this Moon would stop there'd be some major things happen huh this thing can't stop like that God don't you don't have to worry about science and what they say he can make it all work anyway doesn't matter what science says it don't matter what the doctor says about you and what your diagnosis God is greater than your diagnosed he's greater than science amen remember that you are well I'll tell it again since it since I comes to mind that old man that I believe their child was dying and it was their past ever coming back nobody ever came back from that amen and that little girls that came in he says my boys gonna live he says who's telling you this why do you believe that you can't say that and so forth he says if she says this monitor this thing says that he's gonna die she says lady you are looking at you're looking at that I'm looking at the promise of God and he lived that child lived amen praise be to God I'm glad all about what you look and I'll tell you what the more we look at him we realize it's not your power it's not my power it's not what you are better Ben said it's nothing what you've done the devil tell you look what you've done no quit looking at what you've done and begin to look at what he done for you you only hope that you have overcome what you have done is to look at him and what he has done all right I'm glad there's hope for a backslider I hope that I'm glad there's hope for a sinner like Paul murder it doesn't matter oh you talk about the power of God the strength of God the power and the strength of God now let me go back to my ego story if you notice she is flopping and flopping and telling you know two Wings the Old Testament faffing and Fanning like the brother man says amen God comes into fans the Holy Spirit and services like this look at that look at that look at that amen and these singles are taken back he says their stomach they say wow Great Thou Art How Great Thou Art amen but the mama says look Eagles I want you to understand something and I love this part I'm trying not to show you my power but I also want you to understand and that you are like me you have my genetics you've got wings like me you've got power like me you've got faith like me and you can soar like I saw speak to the Rock speak and it shall be whatever you ask it shall be done you can fly like I thought I believe when I said let there be let there be let there be you made out of the same product here's you're his jeans and when you say this problem is going away this devil has to move you're made out of the same thing because I'm not just trying to show you my power I want you to understand you have power first John 1. and you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you amen you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you people that ain't got the Holy Ghost ain't got this power to say Amen praise the Lord Glory can't wait to Wednesday night we're gonna preach on salvation that'd be all right he's salvation to him amen if the Lord keep guiding me in that way and if if it's not just me amen oh maybe go ahead and say something I try to say that if it's not just me wanting to go a certain direction because sometimes we say well God changed what he gave me I kind of have a hard time believing that because God changes mine did he mess up the now when God gives you something I believe he gives you that amen but sometimes we get to thinking well this is what he wants me to do and so forth amen but then we'll feel like no this is really what I feel like he's wanting to do and I'm saying like that's the direction I go amen so anyway just a thought she probably hadn't heard that before but a little something I felt like the Lord showed me amen not dedicated can't change his mind I guess but he's not very much very apt to do that is he all right praise the Lord Old Testament New Testament power wings and so forth I want you to understand I mean those that when he can if he needs to defeat all armies he'll do it oh brother bad I love that he says oh a host should Rise Against Me I shall not fear amen he is our Shield how many believes he's our shield and The Shield is not is not a sword a shield protects you hey man David knew what he was like for God to protect you I'm 62 years old almost I always say the next number because he's coming right up but I want you to understand that I got into this old because God has shielded me he has protected me he is my shield he knows how old I'm gonna get he knows how many years I am I'm shooting for 90. we don't know what he'll what it'll be of course after 78 80 90 years old years old I'll tell you what sometimes I understand why people want to go foreign not really in my age but a little bit I can get a little titch touch because it's nice to be able to get around how many enjoys getting around having strength yet but if you couldn't huh the condition in the living was just so bad amen be a Christian and be ready to go when God calls you amen how many is with me let's just be that doesn't matter if you're young or old always be ready to go whenever God calls you he's my strength Giver he is my all he is my all in all Oh What A Savior Oh What A Savior and when he believed that what a God what a mighty God we serve I can walk on water he raised the dead is that right not only that but I shed my blood on ovary I paid the price and there's power in the blood how many knows that boy I'll tell you what look at the last few thousand years and look at the power that Christ displayed is shedding up his blood Amen to give it to his children amen freedom from their sin forgiveness Grace it's all the power of God amen the power to overcome yourself I mean that's your biggest enemy true power this just comes to mind don't have it in my notes but Abraham I believe preached on a message called humble thyself he says you know if you can humble yourself and submit yourself to God he says you've got more power than the guy that can run all over the building shout and speak in tongues and everything else which I'm sure he's talking about somebody that does that but still doesn't have power over themselves amen because there's nothing in doing wrong with doing all of that but there's a lot of people that run scream shout and holler but they have never conquered yourself but if you humble yourself before almighty God and surrender yourself then he says you got more power than just the building God it gets all happy like and running all over the building and so forth how many knows it takes the power of Jesus Christ for you to be able to submit yourself to almighty God and to change your desires there we go there we go how many knows that's what we need well he's gonna try to quit this and try to quit that why don't you try to get rid of the desire to want to do it how many believes you'd quit then it'd be all done with people just go don't go far enough that's why I said a few weeks ago I said a halfway life is the most miserable life there is because you don't go all the way to possessing it you don't quite make it you're on that fence so to speak and don't make it far enough to get the power to overcome the desire for sin and that's what Jesus came to do he came to uh give you power over the desire for sin now we understand we understand that as long as you're in this flesh it will always want to raise up and it is a daily battle that you got to do amen but you can't overcome it amen with almighty God amen praise be to God I like that don't do the same how manybody's a believer is to have the same Faith Of God that God had when he spoke the world into existence yeah this is this I'm talking about to a veteran group of people I'm talking to a mature group of people so when I say the faith of God you already know that when I talk about you've got the very love that God had for the whole world when he gave his life on Calvary he believes a Believer has that same love in their heart that's right a real Christian has that same love and when it's hard to put up with people for a pair with people you have the long suffering of God how many believes the believer has a long suffering of God in their heart you're made out of the same material that little Eagle is made that it is Fame genetics as Jehovah is that great Mama eagle amen how many is glad for that how many would say this morning help me Lord because I I imagine and brother bam talked about flopping flopping in front of them but I imagine that this eagle on a perhaps kind of a windy day is out there in front of that nest and it is moving its tail back there a little flapping up back and forth a little bit if you ever watch the birds up in the air right did you ever notice how their back tail goes you know almost like an airplane they have to adjust that backtail right they'll adjust that back tail in the front feathers just a little bit but mostly the back and then there he is and he's looking over at them and he's just sitting right there in midair see and a little wind gusts come back he goes back and then turns and all of a sudden he goes another ten foot eye she looks see she amen God is teaching you and I when wind's coming your way just learn to set your swings of faith in that wind and cry amen and it'll lift you up a little above that trial above that thing that comes along see that's what you do God then you can say like job though he slay me and I'll trust him Lord have mercy we ain't never had that much so as much happen to us as job did him yet he could worship God by saying the Lord has taken given the Lord has taken away blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be his glorious name amen and amen amen musicians come let's Worship in a little now you want to worship him now let's just give him a little praise and glory amen and then don't let me forget the video Micah I'm forgetful I'm human but I did remember that so far didn't I bless the Lord oh my soul if you'll pull that up and all that is within me bless His holy name amen stand with me and Worship the Lord all of your heart close your eyes and sing with me oh bless the Lord my soul [Music] oh bless the Lord oh my soul oh that is within me [Music] name for he had gone crazy yes has he done great things in your life that's a bless the Lord [Music] yes Lord [Music] at all at all and help at the praise of your people this morning [Music] oh bless the Lord oh my soul [Music] you love him this morning let's just power here
