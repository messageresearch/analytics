So, if you just have a need, just let it be known for the Lord with uplifted hand. Amen. Hey man, can we sing your cries have awoken the master this morning? Crossing the calm sea with Jesus, the disciples [singing] were getting [music] concerned. The wind started [singing and music] violently blowing, but he was [music] asleep in the stir. [singing] Does he not care that we perish? We're helpless [music] and we're so afraid. Jesus arose when they called him and said to [music] them, "Where [singing] is your faith? Because you prayed [music] all night. Cuz you held on with all of [singing and music] your might. Child, your cries have awoken the master for [music and singing] he knows your voice. Lift your hands. It's time to [music] rejoice, child. Your cries [music] have awoken [singing] the master and it hit [music and singing] you without any warning.

And you're thinking that [singing] you'll [music] surely drown. You cried out for help from the Savior. [singing] And you know you can't give up [music] now because you prayed [singing] all night because you [music] held on with all of your mind.

We're going to turn it over to brother Ber as he prepares to come. Let's sing. We're standing on holy ground this morning. We are standing on holy [singing] ground. And [singing] I know that there are angels [music] all around. They're here to meet your need this morning. Oh, let [singing] us praise my Jesus [singing] now.

So, everybody that has a birthday, if you want to come up at this time. Amen. And we are in January and I guess I would be one of them. One of them. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. A happy [singing] birthday to you. A happy birthday [music] to you. May you feel Jesus near every [music and singing] day of the year. A happy birthday to [music] you. A happy birthday [singing] to you and the best one you've [music] ever [singing] had. Happy birthday. Amen. [applause] Praise the Lord. Anybody get married in January? Amen. Do we have any weddings in January? &gt;&gt; Nope. All right. Amen. Um I guess that's all for the music then. Amen. Let's stand once again. We have a prayer request here that we want to bring before the Lord and that is uh one of brother Joe and Hannah's workers named Justin Diesson, 38 years old. Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock, we'll be having triple bypass heart surgery in Louisville Hospital. That's eight o'clock in the morning. So, we do want to remember him. Amen. In prayer. Amen. So, let's just bow our heads this morning. Lord Jesus, first of all, we want to come and bring this brother. Don't know if he's saved or not, but if he's not, we ask God that you would do a work in his life, Lord. And first of all, save his soul. for Father, we know that would be an eternal work, Lord Jesus. So we pray for him, God, that if he doesn't know you, Lord Jesus, that you'll go into his room, Lord, where he is and reveal yourself to him, Lord Jesus. May he know the power of God and the sweetness of the spirit, Lord Jesus. And also for his body, Lord, his heart, those arteries that are clogged, that they have to bypass, God. We would ask, Lord Jesus, that you would really do a special work. And may he know that there's [clears throat] a God in heaven because of how smooth things have went, Lord Jesus. How good that you are. And we ask God for mercy for him, Lord Jesus. That you'd be in the doctor's hands, Lord Jesus, and be in every cut, Lord, and everything that they do, Father. We ask, God, you'd watch over him and bless him, and to be able to have a good heart again, Lord Jesus, and be able to live his life, Father, Lord. And we ask, God, that you'd just show a special mercy upon him. And then Lord, we kind of want to look at father our two 2025 Lord and the year that has passed Lord Jesus we would ask Lord Jesus that Father any failures any sins any any shortcomings that we've had in that year Lord Jesus that it be put under the blood of Jesus Christ Father so that we could start the 2026 out new and fresh Lord and and Lord be able to Father say that we victory in you, Lord Jesus, and so to speak, have a clean slate, Father, to start over again, Lord, and to live for you, Lord. And Father, we want to thank you, Lord, for all that you have done for us in 25. The revelations that you've brought, Lord, the food that you've fed us, Lord Jesus, that we've gotten to eat, the closer that we've gotten with you and to you, Lord, and the work that you've done in our lives, Lord Jesus, working on us, Father, preparing us, getting us ready, Lord, for what lays ahead, Lord. And Lord, now Father, we put 25 behind us, Lord Jesus. And we put it, Father, in history books, so to speak, Lord. But Lord, there's a new year coming up, Lord Jesus. And it's brand new, Lord. And every move that we make, Lord Jesus. We just pray, Father, that you'd help us in every thought that we think, Lord, give us greater revelation. Give us deeper revelation of yourself, Father, so that we might have victory, Lord Jesus. For we realize God that it's through revelation that we can defeat the devil, Lord Jesus. And it gives us that rock that overcomes the enemy and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it, Lord. So we ask God that you would take us much further than what we went in 25. And we ask God that as we try to minister, Lord, that you would just bless us, Lord Jesus, being able to get out of the way. And then Brother Brad tonight as he brings the word, Father, help him to get out of the way. And Lord, feed your sheep, Lord, what you want us to feed on today. And say what you once said. Have your divine will done, Lord Jesus, in our lives. And we thank you now, Father, for all the healing that you done, all the deliverance that you've done, and all that you have done, Father. And Lord, we ask God for your guidance now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Just devil was trying to put a little bit of a sore throat on me for some reason this morning. So, amen. But I don't really feel sick or anything, but I just Amen. That sore throat is just not quite the way that it's supposed to be. Amen. So, y'all pray for me. Amen. This morning. Amen. We want to go till about what time is it now? 10 after 11. Amen. So, we'll try to go about maybe 10 after 12 or something like that. Maybe preach for an hour and then we want to have our communion. Amen. and us and and so communion and fellowship and then this evening service. We're looking forward to it this year. Amen. I I usually sometimes as far as the voting and so forth. Amen. U sometimes it goes plum to March almost before we ever get it done. So I'm trying to do better. Amen. I like to do it pretty much at the beginning of the year and so about Thursday I says I'm going to get grace to get them drawed up so that we can do it at the first of the year. Amen. Amen. So, we'll try to get that out of the way. Amen. We have a few new ones on there. Amen. As you probably say, seen with brother Mike and brother Austin and then sister Debbie, I think. Amen. For Sunday school class. Amen. And so, we're still short one. Amen. So, be we'll be praying about getting that filled here in the near future. Amen. Praise the Lord. Is everybody all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, all right. Let's see what the Lord will have for us today. Amen. It's kind of again a little bit another uh extension of what we've been speaking on. Amen. About the father's business. Amen. Uh but there's about two or three different areas that I haven't really touched on. And so uh we just want to see what which way the Lord wants us to go uh this morning. And so I titled it I think I don't know if it's got that title up there or not the God's house. Amen. God is building a house. Amen. Amen. Or should we call a home. And so we want to look at that with the help of the Lord for a little while this morning. Let's turn our Bibles if you will. And before I get started on the main subject, I want to just maybe touch a little bit on uh just a little bit of the new year, coming into the new year and and make a couple comments maybe. Uh so if you will go to Philippians 3, we'll start with Philippians 3. Amen. And read a couple scriptures. Amen. And this would be Paul's Paul his attitude. Paul's attitude, amen, towards what is past and the future. And then also we'll read a scripture, amen, of Paul's departure. Amen. Paul's departure and how he was at the end. Amen. And hopefully by God's grace, we can have the same kind of a testimony that Paul did in Philippians 3. In verse 12, Paul says,"Not as though I had already attained." In other words, I haven't gotten there yet. How many can say that? We haven't gotten there yet. Neither were already perfect. Amen. Some Paul must have desired perfection. How many desires perfection? &gt;&gt; Amen. I hate imperfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hate it. We're striving for it. Amen. But I follow after. Amen. If that I may apprehend that for which I am also apprehended in Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; That ought to get us just a little excited. &gt;&gt; We're not worried about the past and we're not worried about 2025 &gt;&gt; or any any of history at all. We are focused on the future. &gt;&gt; We are looking ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's that got that attitude? &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded." Over in second Timothy 4, when Paul come down to the end of the road, he says, "For I am now ready to be offered." Chapter 4 of Second Timothy. Uh for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand. May this be our testimony. I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; It's a little bit quiet in here this morning, brother. &gt;&gt; But man, have you fought a good fight? &gt;&gt; It's been a fight, ain't it? &gt;&gt; It's been a battle. &gt;&gt; How many in here knows this? what the Bible talk. You know, I've fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I have f had to fight through doubt, through frustration, through all kinds of stuff. Is there anybody in the house that's had to fight? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be quite as quiet. We should know what that word that resounds to us. That's right. I know what it's like. &gt;&gt; I've had to fight for my ground. me, Brad. A lot of y'all wouldn't be standing here if it wouldn't be for you having put up a real good fight &gt;&gt; battle. Amen. For what's yours. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course." Would to God, Lord Jesus, help us all to be able to say that on our deathbed. &gt;&gt; I fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. [cheering] &gt;&gt; That's right. I've kept the faith. How many's kept the faith? We're still here in 2026. Amen. So, you must have kept something. &gt;&gt; You're still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those that aren't can't even hear this this morning. There's a lot that ain't &gt;&gt; But praise be to God. If you can hear that, this hear this this morning, you ought to rejoice. Amen. Henceforth, I don't know what henceforth means, but I would imagine it means something in the future. From here on, henceforth, right? From here on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day. And not me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. You can be seated this morning if you want to be. You want to stand with me and how shouting hallelujah? I'd be all right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. and it don't bother me when you get up, you know, get into it. &gt;&gt; But here, think about it. That love is appearing. Brother Brandham kept talking about the Lord is fixing to come. The Lord is fixing to come. And somebody said, "Man, you scared of people when you say that. It's scary when you tell them it's about the end time and the Lord's going to come." And they know some some people kind of got scared about that. But Paul said here, you know, you ought to be scared about it. You ought to love his appearing. You're looking forward to it. And brother Bam couldn't understand. What do you mean? It ought to give you great joy to know that he's coming, not scare you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, I have a very, very technical question to ask you guys this morning. There's a phrase that says that you can't change the past. Is that true? I told you it was a very technical question and the answer is yeah, you can't change the past. Yeah, you can. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we just did &gt;&gt; about five minutes ago. We changed the past. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What? See, the blood of Jesus Christ is powerful enough to take all of your sins of 25 and put them in the sea of forgetfulness. [applause] That's right. God can change your past. Woo! Every bad thing you do, you're going to remember, "Oh man, I [screaming] should have done this. I didn't do this. I didn't do that." But guess what? If you ask God to genuinely forgive you, it goes in his sea of forgetfulness. God don't remember it anymore. God takes an eraser and he erases it. &gt;&gt; That don't do something for you. &gt;&gt; I ain't gonna say drink a beer. No, that should do something for you. I think brother uh who was it? But anyway, the preachers, some preachers would say, you know, that ought to make a Baptist shout. It ought to make a message believer shout &gt;&gt; to know that God will take that Amen. and annihilate it. &gt;&gt; As long as there's mercy, as long as he's on that throne. &gt;&gt; And folks, I want to tell you something. You might backslide a h 100 times. You might backslide. You might not be what you ought to be. But if you genuinely repent, amen. Jesus told us to forgive each other 570 times a day. I want you to know there's grace for you. God will forgive you if you really mean it. &gt;&gt; So don't stay down in 2026. Get back up and go. [screaming] The blood is powerful enough to do that. [applause and cheering] Boy, that ought to do something for somebody that is truly trying to overcome something. &gt;&gt; Hello. It fails and fails. I want you to understand you get back up and you mean it with all your heart. Got to do it. &gt;&gt; How do you know, brother Ba? Cuz I've done it. I know what that's all about. I know what it's like to [screaming] fail. And I know what it's like to genuinely say, "God, forgive me. I didn't mean to." Amen. And God will forgive. Amen. This day, this scripture is fulfilled for me. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is gracious. [sighs] &gt;&gt; That's right. I was thinking about that. The past. Well, you can't change the past. And I don't know about you, but I think it was the Holy Spirit give me that revelation. &gt;&gt; Some said, "Yeah, it can. All your sins can be erased. All your failures, put in the sea of God's forgetfulness. As a matter of fact, you ought to do it every night before you go to sleep. Say, "God, forgive me for my sins today." &gt;&gt; For things I don't even realize. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like to say, "God, if I don't wake up tomorrow, I just want to make sure that all is well." &gt;&gt; Amen. If I die in my sleep, Amen. God, I want to know that when I come up on the other side, it's all taken care of. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But I want to say we're pressing to the future, aren't we? &gt;&gt; We're pressing somewhere. My message this morning is towards in that direction and where we're going, what we're pushing for. Sometimes in the past I've taken themes for the year. Our theme for the year. Well, I doubt that it's going to be the theme for all year. I can't do one that long. But for the beginning of the year here, our theme's going to be on character. Amen. On character. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Cuz guess what? How many believe that we're getting close? We're getting close. &gt;&gt; We're getting close to going home to the house that God has built us. &gt;&gt; How many believe God is there now building you a house? &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's a builder. He's a divine architect. Brother Bham called it in the future home. &gt;&gt; Divine architect. He's building us a home to go to. &gt;&gt; Let me paint you a little picture. Not that kind of picture. God after he created he a few angels so that he could be worshiped. He created saraphims. created angels that have six wings. Ain't that right? And they're there day and night and their wings are going like this, covering their feet, two flying, two covering their face. Ain't that right? Amen. And day and night they cry, "Holy, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord." &gt;&gt; Before God could be God, he created angels to worship him. Amen. Jesus said that he could call 72,000 angels to come and change the scene. So, we know that there's actually at least 72,000. And how many more? I don't know. But how many believe God is over there? He's being worshiped. The hosts of heaven are over there. And they've been with God for ceaseless ages. I don't know how long it's been, but since the time that they were created, they're in that beautiful, beautiful place worshiping God. And here you [clears throat] and I are, amen, just imagining. Amen. How it is over there. But I want you to know something this morning. One of these days, we're not going to be imagining because God has come down and redeemed you. And you're going to be with God, praising him, worship him, him for the ceaseless ages that is to [screaming] come. That is our hope. Here we are in dark world of humanity and Amen. And struggle and strife. Amen. In a body that keeps us down. But one of these days, folks, amen, they're not going to be the only ones that's over there. All the hosts of the redeemed are going to be there. And we're going to worship God through the endless eternity. I would say ceaseless ages, but there's no ages. It's a ceaseless eternity. That's why we come to church in the morning. That's why we worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we look forward to seeing him. Amen. being with him, praising him, the angels, you know, you got more authority, more power than the angels. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? I don't know if it's right to say this or not, but I'm going to say it. Perhaps God thinks more of you than he does the angels. Angel is a servant. Which one do you think the most of? Your servant, your granddaughter, your son, or your daughter or a servant? Most likely going to be your children. Amen. which I know we all know God loves them all, but you have a very special place. You are a very special person. How many believe you're a very special person? You've been called out &gt;&gt; to the evening time light. Called out of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Rise and shine for thy light has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, as we think about God's house, God is building his house. I call it what some people would call the American dream. Martin Luther, they said, had a dream, right? where everybody could ride the bus the same as everybody else and have equal rights. And that was kind of his dream. The American dream would say, "Well, we went nice and have a nice home, nice house with a white picket fence up there, maybe a dog out there in the dog house." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Just the American dream. Good job, good finances, well taken care of, a good business. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But more than that, Amen. It would be to have a good mate, to have a wife or a husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And perhaps to have two or three children. Hello. Being able to take him to the dentist, being able to take him care of him. American dream. Well, how many believes that God has a dream? &gt;&gt; God has a dream. But Abraham said one place he said God had an idea. He began to think. He says, "Herein is set forth the love of God." See, God desired in love family of his own, a family of sons like himself. Now I'm going to put in their daughters. Amen. Sons and daughters. Here lie before him all of mankind lump of clay. Out of the same lump he will not make. The choosing will be his own choosing. How many believes that when God chose you, he chose you before you chose him? &gt;&gt; He chose you before the foundation of the world. Jesus said, "You didn't choose me. I chose [screaming] you." &gt;&gt; But if somebody wants to tell you you're not a son of God, you just tell them, "I'm sorry, but God chose me." You talk to him. [applause] [cheering] You talk to him. He's the one that did the choosing. He has the key of David. He opens the door and and no man can shut it. And shuts it and nobody can open it. How many believes God opens doors in your life? He shuts doors in your life. If you're ever going to get delivered, if you're ever going to get anything, it's God that does it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. His own choosing. Amen. And then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to conform to the image of his in the uh his image in their walk. He proves with reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy. He chasens with nail scar hands. Amen. Remember the story I told you about [sighs] if somebody built your house when you leave, you go to Florida, come back and say you my house is done and he built you a house [snorts] and and you had given him a blueprint and guess what? The bay window was in the bedroom instead of the kitchen. The back porch was only half the size and he decided to make some screened in porch or whatever. How upset you'd be. How you'd say, "Look, tear this thing down and do it right. I don't care what your idea is. Hello. [screaming] I don't know if anybody listening out there, but you want to have a church, man. You have to go to the a construction class for 6 months and then we'll baptize you or shake your hand and take you into this church and all of your man-made ideas has to be torn down. It's going to burn. It's going to be burnt. We built it the way this book says. Oh, we don't get it. Build it all. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me just go back a page. How many believe that we are, Amen, in an absolute masterpiece ministry? &gt;&gt; This ministry that come, it's going to take us somewhere. It's going to bring us to perfection. It's going to have a [screaming] bride without spot, without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; We'll get to that in a minute. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Because he's looking for a bride. He's looking for a church. Now, his bride is not just one person. How many his bride is not just one person's? It's a many membered bride. And just as brother Brandon I'll go ahead as brother Brand preached on the choosing of a bride. Isn't that right? And he says, you know, if one of our young boys here in the church goes out there and world marries a worldly girl and short hair, pants, lipstick, Jezebel or whatever it might be. He said it would show his character. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It would show what he's made out of. &gt;&gt; How many knows God is not going to pick a what? somebody like that. He's not going to choose somebody like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If a boy chooses a girl, she may be beautiful as all can be. She may be a message believer. She may try wear her dresses and and not cut her hair and not wear no lipsticks, but she's got a bad character. She is mean. She's ornery and she don't even obey her parents. &gt;&gt; I don't care how pretty she is. Don't marry the girl. &gt;&gt; She ain't going to listen to you. She's got bad character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or girl. Some boy may be handsome. I mean handsome as all get out. That's right. But he'll chew. He'll meet you at church to pick you up after church, but he won't come in. You go out there, you open that door, they'll say, I won't say a name and be one of our names or something. Open the door and say, "Well, why didn't you come in?" "Oh, I don't know about all that fanatical stuff." &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'll see you later." &gt;&gt; Slam that door. That's right. You ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What did Brother Bram say? A certain family down the street. Amen. Amen. You know, they were decent people or whatever, but they wouldn't talk to you. They were, you know, didn't have much character that didn't have the Holy Ghost. But the Bible says, "Man, if a girl ever did uh date that guy or whatever, he says, I do I would encourage you never to date a boy until he's filled with the Holy Ghost." Why? Because that Holy Ghost changes you. [applause] How many believes God is looking for character? &gt;&gt; And that's what you and I are here for. &gt;&gt; So I'll ask the question that I wrote down here that I thought of. What part of your character did you see that was changed in 25? How many knows we're in the changing business? From glory to glory, he's changing me. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's a slow process. Some of us older folks know that we have it took us a lifetime to get here. I won't tell you what, but just yesterday, I overcome something that I hadn't overcome for a long time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was something simple, not something real bad, but it wasn't bad. It wasn't sinful, okay? But it was just a character. It's just uh not letting something upset me. &gt;&gt; Just not letting something upset me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; And you realize I realize that it worked out so much better that way. &gt;&gt; It works so much better that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. So I ask the church, I ask every one of us this morning, can you point to your character? Unless you've got perfect character, unless you're perfectly in the image of Christ, then you don't need to change. But I think we could all have an altar call this morning and say, "God, there is some per character in me that &gt;&gt; I need to change that needs to change." &gt;&gt; Cuz I think about it and I think about Romans 8 where it says he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of son, his son. If he forneew you, he called you, he justified you, &gt;&gt; predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son, &gt;&gt; and talk about building a house. This is about and I like that. Thank you for putting up putting that up. C character is a victory, not a gift. Why? In other words, you had to go through a battle for it. &gt;&gt; You had to pray for it. You had to go through a a strife for it or whatever. &gt;&gt; And if you've got character, it's a victory &gt;&gt; cuz God is going to live with us. Just like a wife lives with her husband. And when you're building a home, now if you want to know, now I I I'm not going to have time to get into it, even though I've got the quotes and the scriptures. I wanted to read almost all of Revelations 21, and I don't know if I will yet not, but the actual place where you and I are going to live, streets and avenues and uh gates of pearl and 12 foundations, isn't that 12 foundations with the apostles name written in it? You know, I had a and I thought about not just the yeah, the disciples and so forth, their names that are written in it. And I found out, brother Troy, that my name's going to be written &gt;&gt; in one of the foundations. &gt;&gt; My name Thomas. Wasn't Thomas a disciple? &gt;&gt; Well, the 12 disciples, it may be Thomas's name, but my name's Thomas. I'm going to go over there today. Woo! [screaming] Oh yeah, I'm in the right place. That's one time maybe some of us wish we were already in common. No, not really. Oh my. But there's John, right? All these different different names. Amen. Part of the foundation. But what I'm saying is the place that God is preparing for us. And brother Bam said in in in uh John 13, I believe is I go to prepare a place for you. Amen. He said he's been there for thousands of years preparing that place for [screaming] his bride. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what it's going to be? &gt;&gt; I get excited just imagining it. says that there'll be streets of gold, transparent gold. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, it's God's not just going to give us streets of gold with us having bad character. &gt;&gt; No, because how many knows the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes, it's your gold that the gold is a Christlike character. &gt;&gt; Amen. So gold fits with gold. Your gold character. So I have a Oh, here we go. What about New Year's resolutions? Turning new pages and two two new le Does it work? Well, I'm going to differ with that just a bit. But before I differ, I've got to add a little something to it. Because isn't it say, "Well, I'm going to change this year." How many would say, "I want to be a better husband." Danny, you want to be a better husband? &gt;&gt; You want to be a better brother to me? I want to be a better pastor for you. I want to be a better brother. I want to be a better husband to my wife. I want to be a better grandpa. Amen. And not do like I did one time when Emilyn or Elena said something about stupid. That's stupid. And Emilyn says, "Mommy says we can't say stupid." Grandpa said, "That's right, Emilyn. Don't say stupid." stupid something to that extent. Oh my. And then we laugh. So I got to repent. Lord help us. But it'll be a better How many wants to be better? How many's looking at this year to climb much higher than what you are? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's my ambition. Now, turning a new leaf is about, you know, trying to trying to do better. Amen. And making a commitment. Amen. If, let me say this, it can work if you do it by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Say, God, I repent of my sins. I don't want to do that anymore. Lord, I ask God that this year would be different. Lord, &gt;&gt; give me the power of your blood. Then, yeah, you can turn a new leaf. Then you can change from what you are and what you don't want to be. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? But only through the blood. &gt;&gt; Only through Christ. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, yeah, you've never worked. It's like pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. It just makes you tighter on your feet. Can't pull yourself up. You can't change your nature. That's what people do and they try to change their own nature and they can't do that. I mean, if there's one desire, one desire that we have and that is to be more like him, to be more like Christ. We all come from different families. Isn't that right? We are all taught different. All of our name, last names, every last name that I could mention here, we're all different, raised a little different. But let me tell you something. We all when we come to Christ come into the family of God. We become God's children &gt;&gt; and we become brothers and sisters to each other. &gt;&gt; That's why if I fuss with you, you fuss with me. You say something about me I don't like. You say something well or vice versa. Guess what? We shouldn't be able to go to each other. Amen. And hack it out. Come to the altar and say, "God, forgive us both." That's [screaming] what sons and daughters do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe this morning that we are more precious to each other than what your natural brother or sister is. That's exactly right. I'm a witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go witness to some of your brothers and sisters, unless they're all message believers, and see how you really don't have that much in common. &gt;&gt; You got the same mama. You got the same daddy. But what did brother Banam say? He found out that they're not really his parents. He is our parent. &gt;&gt; There are earthly parents. There are earthly brothers and sisters. But if they don't get saved, you're not going to spend eternity with them. But you are going to spend eternity with each other. And that's why we ought to be thick as molasses on a [screaming] cold morning. And we ought to have more love in 26 than we did in 25. We ought to be closer to each other in 26 than what we are in 25. More sensitive to each other. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's time not to be children. &gt;&gt; But to be grown up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believes we need to be grown up? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I said, maybe I'll touch on on we we we're going to focus this morning for just another 20 minutes. on that character part. Amen. And I about got to say this before I go on, but forgive me, Courtney and Gersham. I like to use y'all an example. &gt;&gt; They're good ones, aren't they? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's like Christ looking for a bride. Ain't that right? I think what they got going is real good. &gt;&gt; I mean, if they cry when they leave each other, they got something going on. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell them that outside of salvation, what your experience is is the best thing there is outside of salvation. &gt;&gt; So enjoy it. Be happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Gersham no no doubt came to Courtney showed an interest. Ain't that right? The way that God comes to us showed an interest and she had to figure out whether this guy was what he she wants or not. Long before they said I do. Isn't that right? But here they are engaged now to be married. Is that a raptor you're driving? A raptor. He's driving a Raptor. I was going to go down and make sure. Pretty nice truck. He's probably kind of impressed. He huh? He also drives a Raptor. I really like him. He's handsome. He drives a Raptor. Which it probably wouldn't have really mattered when I wasn't dated my wife. My wife tells me here just not so long ago says, "You know, I didn't marry you for money." When I when we got engaged and seen each other, we was a 72 orange 72 Chevy pickup. And at every red light, my gears, you know, it was one of them column shifters. And man, things would get stuck. I would have to quickly open the hood and unstick them things so I could go back on in about every red light. That wasn't a lot of fun. But I'm telling you what, she was stuck to me like glue. That's right. You right by my side. But what if Courtney, what if what would happen now that you're already committed? You're not dating him. You're not a gold digger. Curt's not a gold digger, by the way. Because there's a lot of out there that are. Ain't that right? But what would it be like? What would what would Now, we know that Courtney's eyes can get pretty big sometimes. She gets excited, right? What if she found out that actually Gersham had a billion dollars in the bank? Huh? Huh, Courtney? Huh? Yeah. Their eyes would be like, "What? That's so much better. That's Oh, I anything I want, anything I need, anything I desire, [screaming] I'll be able to get." &gt;&gt; Maybe not all the wants, you'll control that, but a lot of the wants for a billion, you can have almost everything you want. How many knows super rich people? They can have whatever they want pretty much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what do you do? You just live on what you need to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people can't control that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. How many knows that when we come to Christ, we said, "Lord, I want salvation. I want you." And after we got married, we find out that he gives us a checkbook. Whatever you desire. Amen. He was a billionaire. [screaming] [applause] We married a billionaire. Amen. We look there. He says the make shall inherit the earth. The whole [screaming] earth is yours. Whether things pass and whatever it is, you just wanted to get saved. But you found out like that woman that had all of those checks. Ain't that right? She was poor. Amen. And the people come and said, "Why are you so poor? Why do you have to get charity?" She said, "My son sent me these beautiful checks or these beautiful pictures." Amen. And come to find out, she was worth all kinds of And that's the way it is. God sent us beautiful pictures. Amen. And we're worth billions of dollars. How many believe that's the way it is with God? Oh, everything that you have need of, God is going to supply it for you. no want to them that love him. Praise the Lord. So if you need victory this morning, God's got victory for you. &gt;&gt; You need deliverance this morning, God's got deliverance for you. You need joy this morning, God's got joy for you. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what it is. Praise the Lord. But God wants us in 26. How about this? Let's plan on Jesus coming back this year. &gt;&gt; How many plans on Jesus coming back this year? &gt;&gt; How many plans on the rapture happening this year? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we don't want to be a part of the foolish virgin. You know why? Because she was a virgin. She was somewhat holy. She was somewhat pure, but she didn't have any oil in her lamp. She wasn't quite up to specification. How many believe if you're going into rapture, you're going to have to up to specification. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to be what God wants you to be. And that's what we're here for. God mold us and shape us. To finish my quote, he chasens with nail scarred hands and thoroughly breaks it down. Amen. Working on it and thoroughly breaking it down in order that he can rebuild it again. Amen. Just like that house. Now notice he says, let me go back again. He rep he chasens with nails scarred hand. Sometimes the potter There you go. Sometimes the pilot must take the vessel that he is working on and thoroughly break it down. That's why I said we all come from different backgrounds. We all have different, you know, uh, habits and things and the ways that we've been taught. But I want you to know how many believes that we need to change that. Every one of us. Amen. And get taught this way. We all agree to this. We're no more Lasters and Bers and Hersburgers and Hallbeggers and Pewitts and Amen Baldwins or whatever. &gt;&gt; Now we're God's children. &gt;&gt; And in one way, now don't st let this stumble this or out there on the radio land, but you know, Paul said, "Follow me as I follow Christ. I have begotten you to Christ." Paul said, "Brother Bannon, whenever he had a lot of people going out to Arizona, not working anymore and and living off of charity and everything, he says, "They're my kids. They're my children." So, how many believes we're the prophets? We're the children of the prophet. &gt;&gt; We're brother Brandham's children. &gt;&gt; That's awful quiet. Are we Brother Brandham's children? &gt;&gt; That's right. We're his children. He had begott us to Christ. We're part of the uh the the stars in his crown. Amen. And he says, you know, there now I'm going to have to give him a little spanking. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? A little correction. &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you something. How many knows that when these children get correction, you're molding their [screaming] character? Chastisement is part of becoming what God wants us to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bible says if you can't take chastisement, if you can't take correction, then you're a pastor's child. You're not really one of us. &gt;&gt; Got to be able to take chastisement. As many as I love, I chasen, I rebuke, be zealous, sell therefore, and repent. God lets us go through trials. How many? Everything that God has let us go through, Amen. It is for molding our character. [screaming] character that is fit to rule with him over there in his house in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes he says he must take the vessel sometimes that he's working on and break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly what he desires. So I ask you search your heart because this is the area sometimes I'll preach repentance to sinners. All right, y'all have heard me do that. But my focus, I focus more, Amen, in trying to get each and every one of us to maturity. &gt;&gt; How many believes that get you to maturity? I wrote down here, he says some of our young people, he mean, you need to act like you got gray hair because we've got gray hair means you ought to be solid. Means you ought to be mature. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have fought the battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been molded. [snorts] Amen. I know one thing I need that is more patience. That's one thing I need. So, let me ask you this. How many believes? And ask yourself, ask yourself in the areas where you still have your character isn't quite the way that you know it ought to be. Amen. How many knows if you get built if your mama, your daddy, if my mama, my daddy taught us in ways that wasn't according to the word, guess what? God has to break us down. &gt;&gt; He's going to have to take us and break us. Now, I want to I've got two pages here on Amen. on uh well, on grown-ups. Amen. And backsliders. People that go backwards and or people that go forwards. Grown-ups and amateurs. How many believes we go forward, not backwards? &gt;&gt; Amen. I got wrote down here that we're Amen. We're looking not to go backwards because Paul said, "My soul has no pleasure in them that draw back." &gt;&gt; How many would say, "I want to pray more this year." &gt;&gt; Not less. &gt;&gt; See, going backwards is to pray less. &gt;&gt; You take it as from the Holy Spirit. He's asking you right now, where are you right now compared to a week ago? &gt;&gt; Huh? How about just us in the last week? &gt;&gt; Have you go went backwards or have you gone forwards? Because let me just say this. I for myself, I am looking desiring a much deeper walk with God. &gt;&gt; A much closer walk with God. Like that stream that brother Bam talked about. It's a deep stream. It may not have a lot of ripples and all of that, but guess what? It's experience runs deep and it reflects the stars. We want to be like Jesus ultimately. But how many knows that brother B preached something called a masterpiece and how that Jesus was the masterpiece and God smoteed him. Ain't that like kind of like Michelangelo? And he smoked him. He was perfect. But he talked about a bride tree that he's restoring and he's making a masterpiece out of the bride. Ain't that right? And I wanted to ask you this. What closer do we not already have a masterpiece in the bride that's so close like Christ that they baptized in his name? They thought brother Brandham was God. &gt;&gt; Hello. How many knows that it reflected so close? And then brother Brandham preaching in Sarah Vista in ' 64, he talked to to the church and he says, "Shalom church. Peace. God's peace to you. Good morning. It's breaking day church. It's darkness upon the people, but it's good morning. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he had so much negative say calling the wicked one a prostitute and everything else, but to the real church it was good morning. Christ is appearing among us and another place and this is another goal that we all want to have because I really don't believe that the bride was in this place when brother Brandon preached it because how many knows how few of churches I don't know just how few but I know it was just very few churches that even existed in 1965 ain't that right brother Perry Green and maybe a few others not very ready. But yet, brother Brandon would say this to about the bride invisible union. He says, and this is my message to the church as you go off the air in a minute. You're standing. If you're standing on God's word and with God's word, every amen, every jot, every tit, where are you standing? He says, I hear the coming of the combine. I you are standing complete justified as though you never did it in the first place. Hallelujah. He says you are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and every woman that's born of the spirit, washed in the blood of Jesus Christ believes every word of God stands as though you never done it in the first place. How many believe that that's what the bride is going to come to? You're going to be without spot, without wrinkle. Peter said, being found of him without blemish, without blame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wash what? Washed into water of the word. Ephesians says that husbands are to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. Lord, help us 2026. May this church may you, everybody that is possible, God, take away every blemish, &gt;&gt; take away every wrinkle out of my life. Lord, I give you permission. Work on me. I've got one interest not to be here in the tribulation period and have to give my life for my for my salvation. No, I want to be pure here. I want to be pure right now. [applause] &gt;&gt; God, work on me. That's why I asked a while ago, is God working on you? &gt;&gt; Do you see the difference? I want you to be absolutely honest with you with me. Those of you who really see that God has changed you, changed your character at least in a minute way, &gt;&gt; a little bit or a lot. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You should be able to raise your hand. &gt;&gt; If you don't raise your hand, you're just now telling me that you just really don't see that God has changed you. Isn't that right? So, Lord, change me &gt;&gt; because we're going to be changed one of these days &gt;&gt; and the way that you are and your character, it's going to have to be fit to that new house that God is building. &gt;&gt; Oh, when I begin to think about the host of those angels, when I begin to think about the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride, 1,500 square miles, half the United States, I guess it is. Amen. the heavenly place coming down as a bride adorned for her husband. Amen. And there no sunlight anymore for the lamb is a light. No temple anymore for he is the temple. &gt;&gt; His goal is and God shall dwell with them. Revelations 21. His ambition, his goal, his final, what do you call it? His endgame or something. Amen. divided final outcome is that he is going to be their God and we are going to be his children. &gt;&gt; We're going to be there in the temple with him. Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; God, search your heart. &gt;&gt; Change me where I need changing. Amen. Amen. Let's not be like Israel complaining, murmuring. Amen. Let's not find more excuses for oursel. Let's come to church more than what we did &gt;&gt; in 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the way I was feeling this morning. I almost called Brother Brad because I know he's ready. I almost called him. Said, "No, I don't feel that bad. I'm going. I could have. I had an excuse, but no." Said, "Give me some of that coffee. Give me some of that ivormectin. Give me them forward antibiotics." So, yeah, that's right. I'm ivormecting. I'm antibbodying up here. I'm coughing up here. But I'm here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come love to come to church if at all possible. &gt;&gt; Don't want to go. How many say I don't want to go backwards. I want to go forwards. &gt;&gt; Amen. Grown-ups have learned never to hold a grudge. &gt;&gt; If you're a grown-up, you have learned something. Never hold a grudge. &gt;&gt; Never hold bitterness. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Me and my wife was talking. We said, you know, I I feel like I know somebody that's really kind of harboring bitterness. And I said, "Well, they're just juveniles. They're still young in the Lord. I don't care how long you've been in the message or how long you've been a Christian. If you can't identify that when you have a grudge in your heart, you have bitterness in your heart, and that you have a wrong spirit in your heart, you won't be able to get rid of it. You're just going to be thinking that's right, and that's okay." No. How many knows you ought to be a Christian enough to recognize, hey, you know, I don't have the right attitude. I don't feel right &gt;&gt; cuz then you're ready. That's grace. That's God showing you, hey, you're not where you ought to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we've got to become grown up. Amen. Grown up to admit that we're wrong. &gt;&gt; Grownup is being able to admit that you're wrong. To see you're wrong. Cuz I'm here to tell you, every one of us, we just for some reason think we're right. Even if we're wrong, we I'm right. I'm right. I'm right. I don't know. It seems to be in our hard drive. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit will come and show you. &gt;&gt; No, you're wrong. Not only have to say, you know, cuz that is so hard to say sometimes. I'm wrong. [laughter] It's so hard to say. And you know what's even harder is say I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; So hard to say. &gt;&gt; The flesh don't like it. But how many knows the spirit does? Because after that you're liberated. I'm glad I did it. You're liberated because you're a grownup. You're big enough to admit that you're wrong. You're big enough to say you're sorry. Cuz I want you to know God didn't send us this message so we could divide over little isms. Amen. Over little doctrines or whether the Sabbath seal is open or whether it's not or whether he's coming on a white horse. &gt;&gt; He didn't come here for us to better never meant for us to sit around, Amen, and fuss about his doctrines. &gt;&gt; No, [screaming] he never meant us for divide over little ism. He said that's what Pentecost did. That's what the Pentecostals let the devil do to them. That's what the devil does. &gt;&gt; No. God came with this message to bring us into unity, to the unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; You want to fuss, you're going to f fuss to a fence post. &gt;&gt; You're going to fuss to quiet lips. I ain't going to fuss with you. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit don't fuss. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ain't got the bigger. This message didn't come to do that. This message didn't come in this generation. Let me tell you something. Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Man, the Pentecostals got to the place, Amen, to where they wanted to have the most. They wanted to have the biggest church. We got the biggest church. We got the best preachers. We got this, that, and the other. And the message has almost gotten to where we got top 10. We got the best church. We got No. No. Don't be going there." Amen. We're all Christ. Amen. And I don't care if there's five somewhere in a church. They're as [screaming] valuable as a 500 in another turn. We're all God's people. &gt;&gt; There's no big eyes and little U's. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to be big, call yourself a servant. I'm just your servant. &gt;&gt; Be grown up. That's what this message came to do. [sighs and gasps] How many believes that? &gt;&gt; That's right. This message came to bring us the stature of a perfect man &gt;&gt; right here. How many believes that? Second Peter, add to your faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherhood of kindness, and love. Add these things to you. How many wants to say, God, I want more faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got three things. Let me just go a couple minutes extra. Is that okay? Hallelujah. Grown-ups. Amen. They praise him in their storms. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Evening like tabernacle people here. Amen. When times go rough, when things go south, praise him anyway. &gt;&gt; Don't let it upset you. Don't let it mess your spirit up &gt;&gt; cuz we all fall short on that sometimes. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But Lord, help me. That's the way I want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise him in the storm, in the trials. Realize that you've got to be tried. God is molding us and shaping us. Not for down here, but for over there. He wants us to be like him. Amen. How many believes it's time? Amen. That if you need to stop the sun, to stop the sun. If you need to pray for somebody's limbs to be restored, that those limbs can be restored. Time does to have faith unwavering. Time to be at a place. Amen. Become the message. Become that the devil doesn't know what to do with you anymore. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right, devil. You don't know what to do with me anymore. &gt;&gt; Get to that place. &gt;&gt; I'm glad, brother Bam says that a man can lift to God that the devil doesn't know what to do with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Any closing? Amen. I want a grownup experience. I want that deep, rich experience. Amen. That it doesn't matter if there's tribulation. Amen. Distress, persecution, no matter what. Nothing separates us from the love of God. &gt;&gt; We are very deep but we are not so deep. Amen. That we should I say we are deep enough to know that we give God not amateur praise but we praise him on the loud symbols. We get a little loud sometime when it comes to worshiping God [cheering] cuz we realize wherever Jesus is there's always some noise. [cheering] Woo. Have that deep and still shout out to the Lord. See, I'm [screaming] going to worship like never before. I'm going to stand to my feet. Amen. And give God a little dance. Amen. I'm going to dance a little bit. I'm going to say my hands for him. I'm going to give him much more [screaming] grown up worship. Grown up worship. [applause] That's what we need to do. We need to give God grown up worship. cuz we're going to go into heaven. We're going to make a noise. [screaming] We're going to make a thunder. How many please? There's I'm telling you right now, we're part of that thunder. I'm going to be a part of that thunder. Are you going to be part of that thunder? Sounds like thunder. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. [screaming] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Grown-ups [sighs] [gasps] don't have to come to church and have the pastor feed them. [sighs] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to come to church to get fed. Brother Bam says, "A grownup lives in the don't have that out here." Amen. But in the holies of holies, &gt;&gt; the third channel, they're in the presence of God all the time. &gt;&gt; God help us. [panting] And what did he say? You meet a believer, a person that's been in there, and I'm going to tell you, it don't matter if it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Amen. They don't got to come to church and get fed up. They're fed up [screaming] all the time. When you come to church, you're already fed up. Here's a good one. You'll like this one. We're like that. And and and you're so fed up until you're fat. &gt;&gt; Grown-ups are spiritually fat. &gt;&gt; Let your soul delight itself in fatness. I got a hard time quitting. &gt;&gt; I'm tired [snorts] of thinking about quitting. Let's quit about quit thinking about time. Is that okay? Can we go a little longer? &gt;&gt; All we're going to do is sit around and talk for at least a half hour. The extra in between. So, might as well made the best of it. Let me see. Joel says, "How many believe this day this scriptur is fulfilled? Fear not, O land. Be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things." How many believe God has done great things? Be glad, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God. I like that. That's what we just got done doing, rejoicing. For he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you to delay the former rain and the latter rain in the first month. Amen. How many believe we've had the we've had the rain. Brother Brandham said that that former and later former and latter rain come together. Hallelujah. And the floor shall be full of wheat. The fats shall overflow with wine and all. And I will restore to you all the years that the locust has eaten. Tank of worm, caterpillar, palmer worm, the great army which I sent among you, and ye shall eat plenty. &gt;&gt; Woo. I was coming from the chicken house this morning. Gather the eggs. Where was it last night? I thought, you know, in this world, I'm telling, we are so rich. Amen. We have so much food until you can eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat until you're 300 lb, 325 lbs. Our biggest problem is just get that spoon and put it back down. Ain't that right? Amen. Because we have we get fat. Amen. We got a problem fighting fatness. God help us. Amen. To have to fight a little spiritual fatness. No, we don't want to fight spiritual fatness. Just give me some more. Amen. I got wrote down here a real spiritual mature person. Amen. They say sometimes, Amen. They'll get so fat that you'll hear and they sound a little funny sometimes. But Abraham talked about the two little calves. One was the the owner was a a farmer that was lazy and yet but nothing but briars and thistles all winter long to feed that little calf. The other one he made in the summertime. He got them great big round bales. He made so many of them he got stored up with food. He fed them things when they come out them double doors. And I live there. I've been there. I know what it's like to open them doors and let them cows come out in the spring. Amen. They go out in there. Amen. And they're just round. Hello. And this little calf, he was just round when it got there and it felt that that wind and it felt that grass. Amen. Brother said, "Man, he jump." [screaming] Well, let me tell you something. You get a mature Christian. Amen. That's fast. Amen. He'll say, "Preach. [screaming] [cheering] Preach. Amen. Why you're saying get that dipper? Amen. With that big bowl, go down in that soup bowl and just give me some more. I love it. Preach. You want some more of that? That's what that mean. Amen. You listen to a real believer. Amen. That's mature. He'll say, "Hallelujah." [screaming] &gt;&gt; Amen. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The sound of a fat Christian. That's a new one. The sound of a fat Christian. [panting] Amen. [snorts] Amen. You burnt up. Amen. Been eating good. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Can I preach a little longer? &gt;&gt; You get a preacher up here, he's made out of ice. Well, now we've all come here and Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago. And you know, back in those days, they did have miracles done. And there was a few of the apostles that got got the Holy Ghost, but we know it ain't there anymore. We don't he don't do the things that he used to do anymore. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And guess what? Everybody in that congregation, I'll sit up here so you can see me. Scoot over a little bit, will you? Amen. The congregation just a man. Brother Bam says these intellectuals that say amen like a dying calf or something. They're just froze. &gt;&gt; Froze. I'm telling you, we ain't froze. [screaming] We ain't froze. We're loosened up. We're on fire. [applause] How many glad to have a church on fire? How many want your soul on fire? [screaming] [cheering] Burn. Burn. Holy Spirit burning me. You tell me something. Give me another big scoop. I'll give you a sp big scoop. Amen. You never was saved [screaming] any certain day. You was always saved. Dip a little deeper. Get Give me another dip. You can no more be lost than God can be lost. Give me another one. [cheering] [sighs] &gt;&gt; What did brother Daryl say? This can't be legal. &gt;&gt; [panting and sighs] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it can. It is totally legal. &gt;&gt; It's what God wants. &gt;&gt; How many believes that when you rejoice like that, let me just I'll just give you my opinion this one time. I'm going to give you my opinion. I believe that when you rejoice like that and you worship God, God smiles, [sighs] &gt;&gt; says, "That's my children. That's my children. That's how I want them, brother Brad. That's how I want them. I want them fullness of joy. When your kids are happy, Amen. And they shout. Amen. You smile. Say, "I'm glad my child is happy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you morning. Thank you for your prayers. God's house, he's building us a home. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's also building the inhabitants of that house. &gt;&gt; How many believe we're the inhabitants &gt;&gt; of that house? And he is molding us. That's why I'm trying to be careful. Lord, [sighs] can I say something else? &gt;&gt; I got one. Okay. I would say to the Lord Jesus, Jesus before I can ask you to work on the people, Lord, here I am. &gt;&gt; Work on me. &gt;&gt; Work on me. Amen. And you know why I smile? Because he does. I'm glad that when I can recognize in my life that God is doing a work, he loves me. He chasens us. Amen. But not praying enough. Let me say one more thing that comes to mind and that is mature Christians make time. Because the devil tries to take your I don't have time. That's the devil's phrase. Don't you ever let the devil say that to you. I don't have time. &gt;&gt; Hello. You make time. You take time back and say, I've got time to pray. I've got time for God. &gt;&gt; Hello. I got time to go to church. &gt;&gt; Well, I just don't feel like going to church tonight. Well, go anyway. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil win. Your flesh isn't going to feel like it all the time. Go anyway. And say, "God, forgive me." Cuz I'll be honest with you, I between Wednesday and today, I've had this on my heart, this kind of series, and I I'm like, man, it's still three days before I get preach this. It's still two days. This is only Friday. I can't wait for Sunday. &gt;&gt; How many thinks we all ought to feel that way? I can't wait till the next time we get together. [applause] I'm looking forward to having this meal. We'll get our meal. Amen. But I'm looking forward to this evening service. Can't wait to have brother Brad come up here. Amen. And give us get behind him and say, "Preach, Brother Brad. Preach. [applause and cheering] That's right. &gt;&gt; Then go home and keep feeding. &gt;&gt; Keep feeding. Sure, you get fed by your pastor, but guess what? You don't have to. Why? Because you get fed. You feed yourself every day. You're fed up. God, help us to be stay fed up. Mature Christians, we don't have to go to brother Donny's. We don't have to go to brother Timuits. &gt;&gt; We don't have to go to the Episcopals to have a revival. &gt;&gt; No, we don't depend on the local reigns. No, the believer is in a revival [screaming] all the time. How many believes we can have a revival wherever we are. We're not relying on this place or that place. We're in a [screaming] revival. How? That's right. When you can't hardly stop and when you can't wait to begin. Finally got it spit out. When you can't hardly stop. And when you can't wait to begin, you've got something going on. &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you, Jesus. [applause] Thank you Lord. Close your eyes and say thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus for coming this morning. Thank you for this day that you have given to us. Amen. To worship you to fellowship with our brothers and sisters to shake their hands to visit with them to come back together again and to worship you in spirit and in truth. Forgive us of all of our sins and our failures. Lord, make us spotless and work on our character. You know, God, we that's going to have to be a victory, Lord. So we, Father, open up our hearts. Say, one thing have I desired of the Lord. One thing will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Lord, I ask God, have us ready for that day, for that time. Prepare us in Jesus name. Amen. Stand with me if you will. We'll get into the communion. The reason I did communion this Sunday is because brother Joe Adams will be with us Sunday, next Sunday. And I certainly wouldn't want him to cut it short. Amen. So, we'll just go ahead and do it today. We got the time and so we're going to change it just for today. Amen. Have communion because I have the deepest respect for communion. Amen. because it's something that Jesus told us to do in remembrance of him as much as and often as we do it. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? So, it's always an honor to take the Lord's supper and foot washing. Amen. Turn your Bibles.
