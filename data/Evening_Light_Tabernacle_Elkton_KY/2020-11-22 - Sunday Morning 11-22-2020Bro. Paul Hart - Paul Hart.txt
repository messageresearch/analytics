for allowing us to be here amen many of you don't know me um I think even brother berer didn't really quite I had to send him a picture of my face so he could put a face to the name you know but of course uh uh my children you know when they were about 10 or 11 years old they were able to go to the youth camp in in Ohio and that's where I uh well that's where I seen brother berer but we really didn't get acquainted a lot you know but only maybe through the altar calls maybe we both was there you know praying for the Youth and uh that there was a few times we spoke to each other and probably introduced ourselves and last time I saw him he was just there early summer brother dwie and also the church at the brother dy's there gives you their greetings amen amen uh for those that don't know me I'm brother Paul heart amen I have a a a different background uh when I was three years old uh of course my my father was a missionary in overseas in the Philippines and uh so we went there when I was about three years old I was born in maryan Indiana and I went there when I was three came back here when I was 16 I didn't speak English till I was 14 so but uh anyway uh you know I didn't have a lot of schooling either I wasn't even able to finish sixth grade and uh because we just moved a lot and uh of course when you're a missionary you go where the Lord calls you and uh so I've had a an experience as a a young uh person a man from 3 to 16 and but there was several times we would come back here I believe I came back here when I was seven I came back here when I was about 10 or 11 I came back here when I was 14 and uh of course when I was about 14 we came here that was the longest we stayed here so I was able to interact with a lot of family members cousins and uh so then I began to pick up English and uh so when I went back to the Philippines they were like well brother Hart you can speak English now but uh of course uh one of the last year and a half that lived there we lived in a bagu city which is the Northern Area and they spoke English better than their National dialect so uh when I begin to learn better English they were happy because they didn't like it when I spoke in National dialect because they didn't you know they just spoke English better but anyway uh that's just that's mean and I I'm here and i' I've sure seen a lot when I was overseas I've seen uh a lot of things that you know that has happened uh for good and for bad and uh uh it's a poor country but the Lord was truly good amen and I've seen God move in people's lives and families and uh so you know there that's one thing that's good to have is an experience amen an experience with the Lord now that don't mean you got to go overseas to get an experience amen you just need a a closer walk with him a true relationship amen an intimate relationship with God Amen and let me tell you something you you you'll receive a lot of experiences amen and uh there's one thing that if you're true to him I believe God will be true to you amen and the Bible says he cannot lie amen God's not here to deceive us amen amen he's here to tell us the truth amen he tell he's here to tell us exactly how it is amen amen when he wants you to straighten up he'll tell you amen and when you're doing good he's going to tell you too amen but when you're doing bad you know he he's going to let you know that's just the way he is and I'm glad I'm serving a God that's that way amen he's not going to stray me anywhere that's going to cause me to you know I like it when he told when David cried out to God you know he said he was in a myy CL clay you know a myy Clay Pit amen you know brother berer asked me what's the title of my sermon I was like I can't give it to you because you know you might read you might have a thought but when you get up here the Lord could change that amen but as David cried out to God you know I don't know what David was going through amen but there he was Amen in in a Clay Pit he said he was an a myy clay amen I remember being in the Philippines when they buil a house they would dig a a hole amen about 6 eight feet deep and that's the septic tank amen but over there uh most of the places the the land there they have dirt that's called aupi which means clay you know and and uh but it has a a once once they dig about 8 ft then they reach that area there and then if you was to ever fall in that you cannot get out amen that the the walls of that that that that pit you know is is so slippery because of the clay if an animal was to fall in there and if they were in there for a day or two they die because of the gas the fumes and and all of that but here David's talking about so I know what he was talking about when he said a Clay Pit amen I know it's hard to get out but I like it when God responded to his cry amen he took him by the hand and placed him on the Rock amen glory to God God didn't just choose to place him anywhere where he'd fall again amen but he placed them amen on a Rock Amen which is Christ Jesus which is our foundation amen that's where we want to stand today amen when God does help amen he does truly help amen and I'm glad he put a song in our heart amen he put that song amen glory to God now God is truly good amen now uh if you don't mind I'd like to share a song If okay no I probably won't brother amen I heard some beautiful songs and I was in there debating it's like nah I'm not going to sing but you know when the Lord gives you a gift you you do it for the Lord you're not doing it for the people but you do pray and say Lord let it be a blessing amen I don't know what the people are going through the Lord knows the thoughts he knows the hearts amen glory amen you know one thing I just want to add to my testimony and you know when I was telling you I didn't even pass sixth grade reading English was not our overseas you know you could give me a Philippine book and I could read it but you give me an English book then you then I'm lost amen when I know when I came into the states and and when the Lord be to deal with my heart and trying to call me to do this and and I told the Lord I said Lord I don't have no time I was already married had children you know and I said Lord I don't have time to go back to school I said I can't take the time to find a tutor and that would teach me how to read or understand you know but I just had to pray and I said Lord if you're calling me to do this you have to teach me to read and the Lord taught me to read and then I said well Lord yeah maybe now I know how to read and I said but I don't want to just you know read words I said I want to understand it amen but I said I don't want to understand what I'm reading like like the world would understand it I said I don't want to misplace this word amen I don't want to misinterpret it or misplace it anywhere I said if I'm reading something I want the understanding amen I want to be able to present it that it's exactly the very thoughts of God Amen and then so I'm really thankful that the Lord has really helped me in those areas amen so you just pray for me tonight amen you might know this song If you know it you can sing it with me come go with me to glory land amen how many wants to go there amen I'm going to a place so fair there be no pain amen no sickness [Applause] there for God himself with his own hands will wipe my tears Amen in glory [Applause] [Music] come go with me to glory [Music] land come go with [Music] me just take his hand oh what a time we'll have it will be so Grand amen never more

[Music] in glory land come go with me to glory [Music] land come go with me just take his hand oh what a Time time will have it will be so Grand amen never more to die to blow land amen oh what a time will have it will be so Grand come go with me Amen to glory [Music] land amen glory hallelujah thank you amen how many's longing for that day amen glory to God if you Tru if you have your Bibles today amen I don't know how much time you're giving me but brother berer said to take my Liberty amen but we want the spirit to have the Liberty amen you know uh this flesh gets tired and it gets hungry and it gets weak amen but we know who is strong this morning amen God is truly the one that's in control and he is good to us amen and amen if you go to Psalms 33 in your Bible in chapter 10 and verse no chapter 33 verse 10 and verse 11 I'm still trying to get used to my glasses and uh I've only had them for about a few months and I guess uh you know when I was a whole lot younger and and you know I used to get these uh older men not old men but older than I am and they would come to me and they'd say brother Paul when you get to about our age he man you know and I've heard that many times like brother Hart when you get to be our age you're going to wake up in the morning and feel your bones cracking and your the aches that you know of course when they were telling me that I was like ah no way you know and when you get to be our age you know your eyes are going to get blurry and I said oh no no you know but anyway yeah well it catch up it'll you know it'll catch up with you and amen but we're trusting in the Lord so there in uh Psalms 33 verse 10 and 11 it says the Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nothing he maketh the devices it says of the people of none effect how many believes that the Council of the Lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generation and when you go to Proverbs 19 verse 21 Proverbs 19 and verse 21 it says there are many device in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand amen you may be seated may the Lord add his Blessing on the rest of the reading of the word you know uh if I am to give a title to this we want to title it weapons that are formed weapons that are formed amen as we're looking at the Book of Proverbs amen and you know where it says there are many devices in a man's heart amen now you know normally when we think about weapons especially in the the scripture there in Isaiah 54 which we'll get there in a minute and uh of course in Proverbs it's talking about devices in a man's heart amen and it says but nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand amen but this device amen it means a thought amen it's a device thought it's a divine plan or purpose amen or even an invention so when you begin to look at Isaiah 54 and verse 17 which is a very familiar scripture and I believe it is a promise amen that we can stand on today amen and then as it reads no weapon that is formed amen now listen now no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper amen and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemned amen Thou shalt condemn amen this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord amen put your name there this morning amen this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord amen and their righteousness is of me it says not ours but of his amen our righteousness is filthy drags in the sight of God Amen but we need his Spirit we need the Holy Ghost amen today more than ever and it says saith the Lord amen glory to God but there's one thing I want you to see in this verse though it's saying no weapon that is formed he says no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper but the scripture is not saying that weapons are not formed amen the scripture is not telling you that weap are not forms at all because they are formed they are formed every minute every second amen every day amen that we live weapons are being formed and when we begin to look at this this uh uh this weapon here look as as as as Ty you know the definition here he says any tool or Implement for preparing a thing arms used in Warfare or weapons an instrument amen an instrument but here we know as we begin to look at weapons but we must come to when you begin to understand the verse it's not exactly just talking about a a rifle a knife amen or Cannon or or what technology has brought today that you know they use out in war amen that would take another life amen because let me tell you something your own car amen could be a weapon amen gasoline is a weapon but yes it's good it it it comes in handy and all of that but how we look at this weapon this morning because look the devil is so Sly he's so tricky amen and he will deceive you amen look and some weapons amen that he would place in your own hands e either it's spiritually or physically sometimes his tactic is not always so you can destroy your brothers and sisters but he'll place it in your own hands so you destroy your own self amen and sometimes when we are not close enough to God and we don't have this relationship with them it's hard for us to really discern the very weapons that the devil has put in our hands amen and here we're destroying ourselves and we don't even know it amen I mean God told them look you're wretched you're blind you're miserable amen you're naked and you don't even know it and Satan has put them in that place and they don't even know it amen and they're the one saying Lord we don't need you no more we have everything amen we have everything that we need of that's what it is but it's the very things what that the very Prince of this Earth has placed in their hands has given to them and they come to a place in their lives they get so relaxed and they get comfortable amen and they begin to just look at the things that they have my whatever it might be amen sometimes smarts and knowledge and you know well you don't think the devil would give you that yes he can amen H Allelujah but here we must be able to discern what the devil's doing especially in nowadays we can look at the church ages amen when you look into the Bible at the first church age you know the devil attacked them but he had a different tactic amen when he came to the second Church age he did something different amen cuz if he repeated amen what he did in the first church age it might not work in the second Church age they they they've already caught on to it so he's trying a different why it's a different year it's a different atmosphere different lifestyle Amen in the second church so he had to do something different and then the third and then the fourth and then the fifth and the sixth and can you imagine during the Dark Ages when they were tortured and I and this is this is the way the devil is amen but then when it came to the leodan church age brother gram says it the devil completely different there amen it wasn't like the first church AG second third fourth or fifth or sixth nothing like that at all brother brandom says the very things that the devil used was what he got us to where we were relaxed relaxed and he said and the richest complete different tactic amen amen and now he's trying to do Bo I tell you what this Corona virus the devil's just on a rampage and trying to close our church doors amen amen that's really that's exact why he's trying to do something different he says I'll get to them amen glory to God but I'm glad amen then one day brothers and sisters you won't even be able to walk with these in your hands anymore amen we'll have to meet secretly amen if that if that day comes amen glory to God I I believe it's right around the corner amen amen look I I'm not in the keeping times or or anything like that you know I believe I was given a sign amen I believe Jesus Christ died and was buried and was resurrected amen glory that's Calvary that's for me amen glory he's covered my sins amen hallelujah now he's what made way he's given me an opportunity amen now I believe there's an elect that's the bride cuz I believe there's those that's going to be in the city and then there's those that's going to be what outside the city amen where do you want to be where do you want to be in this city amen glory to God hallelujah you know the brother was just reading about the the 10 virgins amen oh they were all saved amen but only five was wise amen I I don't want to get into that amen I believe the Lord is has got us on a on a on a path here amen and but we just want to go with his leading amen and here this weapon here amen you know as it it's a tool or an Implement you know for preparing a thing arms used in Warfare weapons amen an instrument and then Paul says in Romans 6 in chapter uh chapter 6: 13 he says neither yield ye your members as what instruments and if we're not careful you yourself amen if the devil can get a hold of you he'll use it as a weapon amen will he will he will do it amen he'll inject something a it'll be a man with some strange Doctrine or some attitude or some temper amen or hatred or something amen he will place in there Amen to cause and build a weapon that would destroy amen and you know what you will never even know it God will help you to see these things and discern these things amen hey I'm human I'm In the Flesh amen amen a lot of things can be put on upon me but I'm glad that we have a a papa God Amen a high priest that can be touched amen we can run into his presence and say Lord help help me amen glory he says neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin amen that yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead amen and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God Amen look when Paul was using the term instrument of evil he uses the word amen that can refer to a tool or we weapon amen our skills many men are skillful you sometimes I look at some people and I look at the talents that they have and and the skills that they have and and I look at it brother berer and I get a little jealous amen it's like man I wish I could you know work with wood like that I wish I could play the guitar like that or you know you you get that way and if you're not careful if you're not careful amen you'll start pursuing something that belongs to somebody else and it's not yours at all and you'll find yourself getting further away from God because you're so busy pursuing things am that's not meant for you but it's our skills and capability amen and bodies can can serve many purposes good or evil amen right in sin every part of our body is vulnerable if you're not careful look I'm we're living in a in a world today that it's gross Darkness the spirit of of Satan is moving he's on a rampage he's trying to destroy who he can amen in Christ every part can be an instrument for his service amen who do we want to serve amen it is the one to whom we offer our service that makes the difference amen glory to God Amen so here in Romans 13 Paul said here now in verse 12 and verse 13 He says the night is far spent isn't that true the night is far spent you know you know the Simplicity of this gospel the Simplicity of the word of God you know when you go to First Peter or second Peter I believe when Peter was getting the Saints ready amen for Rapture amen when he said the end of all times is at hand I mean this was way back when Peter you know and I believe Peter was here you know he didn't even have a chance to really preach to the people you know when he was mentioning this he had to write it in a letter and it had to be published and and passed out but there he still trying to use his hands his mind for the glory of God Amen yes and he was becoming to be a really old man he was dying amen and he was trying to get the people ready amen and then he was just only trying to get to them the Simplicity of this gospel and he told them about four things to get ready and he says to Be watchful to be sober and he said have what fervent charity and Hospitality four things simple things that he was trying to get to people Amen to adapt to to come to that place because Rapture was coming amen look I believe in deep things God is deep amen amen and when you spend time in the presence of God and you're really seeking God he'll show you things and that doesn't mean that what he shows you is something you can just run with it and just and then go to that person or this person and sometimes what he shows you it's just for you amen amen when you when you build a place Amen to where you can commune with God just you and him look I have I have studied things and printed it out brother berer but it's just put up Tuck and I'm like I've asked the Lord Lord how's come you won't let me preach this and you know what I get he said well no that's that's yours and mine see that's that's when you were alone with me he said that's what I gave you amen and we all should have that a time that special time just you and God alone as you communicate with them look he's going to open up to you and it's just for you and then if you try to present it to somebody else it they gooo and it's nothing deep amen but you need to cherish those things amen hang on to them those are the things that God has given you that way when the Devil comes to attack you amen you've got something amen glory to God Amen Hallelujah you got something to point back at him and say look it is written it's a promise unto me amen glory this is my inheritance amen he says now chapter 13 of Romans verse 12 the night is far spent the day is at hand amen you believe that the day is at hand the night is far spent let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light amen glory and we need that armor of light amen look when you begin to study the light and the SC the scriptures you begin to look at different aspects of light amen or different categories amen look I'm not good with words but I know the Lord will help us Amen to understand what he's trying to get to us look when John the Baptist came yes he was pointing to the light amen he was pointing to the light there's the light right there amen that his his shoelaces I'm not even worthy to untie or to even tie or whatever amen he pointed he was there he was what the prophet crying in the wilderness amen who was that Wilderness that was Israel and he's called crying out to them and he's preparing the way amen of the lord and there he pointed he says there's the light and when they begin to crushing him he says no I'm not the light he says no I'm not the Messiah I'm just the prophet I'm just the one crying in the wilderness amen there he is crying to Wilderness Amen to Israel and telling them here's your Messiah here's the light amen but as he pointed to the light that was the light amen glory but when Jesus finally came then he could be the light that could shine on all men and when Jesus here was on Earth amen there he is the light above light can shine on things look you can have you can shut all the lights off in here and and barricade all the windows windows where there's no light coming and it's just black amen all these pews will be here and like and you may never be able to see the dust but that doesn't mean that dust is not on there amen you make it Pitch Black in here they that dust will still be on there but you can't see it and that's exactly it was amen that's the way it was those men those people amen the dust was on them but they couldn't see berer it was dark amen and but here's Elijah pointing and preparing the way for the light to come so it can shine on them now they could see the dust now they could see the dust amen they can like my look at me I'm a sinner amen glory they saw their mistakes they saw their their wrongs and amen glory something begin to work inside the light Shin amen glory glory to God but look but I don't want the light to just shine on the outside amen the Bible says we are the light of this world but of course Jesus also said he says as long as I'm what in this world I'll be the light of the world Amen but who will be Jesus today I hope there's a group of people here amen can say I'll be Jesus today amen I'll be that word being made flesh continually amen I want to be the light amen that's shining among on Amen that gives them the opportunity to say look am I I need Grace I need Mercy I hope we can get people to want the light now to flow in them amen glory to God but the light from the outside amen we can see amen 120 in the upper room amen they want a light shining on them anymore it was a light shining through them that's what we want today Amen Let our lives amen project amen the very life the very characteristics of God Amen don't never let this devil get an Open Door Amen to where he would use you for whatever weapon he thinks that he might use toward your brother or your sisters amen or whoever it may be Lord I want these members Amen to be used for your service amen and sometimes we need patience sometimes God prepares you and sets you to the side amen just have patience when that time comes he'll use you amen but be ready amen glory that's right verse 13 it says let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness amen not in chambering and wanness also wanness look We're All In the Flesh we always want this and want that amen amen you you have a nice home but when your neighbor starts remodeling when your neighbor starts to add on their home you want to add on your home amen he gets a new lawnmower you want a new lawnmower amen he gets a new car whatever it is I didn't you want to get a new car amen it's just a human thing amen want want want want Amen Let Us walk honestly amen as in the days not in ranting and drunkenness amen not in chambering not in wantonness not in strive and envying amen glory I don't even think that this is the time of of of you know acting like that we want really Lord to the Lord to really deeply amen really dwell in us and look the Bible talks about when God said you know I have chosen you unto what salvation amen amen who are we you know to look at others and and because you done something wrong and whenever judgment comes on you and then we like well you deserved it amen I believe we need a change of attitude like Jonah when Jonah was called the Nineveh look there was something about Nineveh that not only Jun Jun Jonah was not the only only one that hated Nineveh amen that Syrian people over there they were Wicked they were warlike people they were going to be the next Empire amen and they were so wicked the killings was going on and how they deceived the people look Jonah don't tell you about Nineveh in details so maybe just to give you some homework readed nahem read the book of nahem and nahem will tell you exactly what Nineveh was all about then you'll understand why Jonah had such a hatred for the people that when God called Jonah because I believe he needed an attitude change brother berer and God already knew that God knows you're from beginning to the end and he goes I'm GNA I'm going to use Jonah I'm going to send him over there I'll change his attitude yes he will there was a time when Jonah be to talk to God and there he was on his way you know and and he said did I not talk to he says I even told you to goad he said didn't I beseech you to even take my own life than for me to go over there Jonah was willing for God to just go ahead and kill him destroy him in his life than for him to go over there because Jonah didn't feel like Nineveh deserved God's mercy he didn't think Beneva deserved God God's love or forgiveness or any of that what they're doing over there they're so evil and wicked amen it's the same today and when you begin to to to read what nahem talks about Nineveh you'll be able to see the day you're living in how they scam people and how they deceive people and how they're killing each other and how they they uh uh present their their beauty and Prestige Amen to deceive people to get people to relax and and and you know get comfortable around then when you're all relaxed and comfortable and then they slit your throat look that's the way the devil works and that same spirit that was on Nineveh those people those Syrian amen and that's the whole reason why Jonah was like I don't want to go he had such hatred in him amen but God is so good amen he you there Jonah didn't even know it and while he was on the boat amen that he was doing missionary work the whole crew was saved and they were pagan people they were superstitious people those men on that boat amen but by one one miracle that God had perform performed amen where he had calmed the sea and they were at awe how awesome is this and they made a vow to God they made a promise and they made a sacrifice and they worshiped God look and they were pagan people and they were more concerned about Jonah's life so they tried real hard to get that boat to the to the shore to save Jonah's life because Jonah told him what to do he says if you just throw me over all of this will be over and he says huh says we'll save you we'll try to get and there they are yeah they were Sinners they were more they were concerned for his life and Jonah at that time he was really concerned for their life too but still deep inside he had such hatred for Nineveh that still won't work with God it's got to be Pure Clean amen because I believe God is coming back for a people that is pure spotless and clean amen glory amen glory to God I don't know why I'm getting on the these are not even on my notes amen glory but God is good amen I believe he's talking to somebody look if he ain't talking to you I can hear myself amen I've got ears amen maybe he ain't stepping on any of your toes but I've got tens he's stepping on glory Lord but that's exactly how Jonah felt but he also knew his God he also knew that when he got there and preached this the you know what he had to preach give the people the message he he knew they would repent and he knew God would would would would forgive them right you imagine this can you imagine Jonah being in the fish for for three days well I tell you what my heart would and and and within an hour it' be gone I'd be so scared there'd be no light it' be dark you don't know what's going on in that belly amen he was there three days three nights three days man that's a long time I wonder how it really felt he probably I don't know if he was marking the days but it probably felt weeks to him but yeah he prayed the god Bible said he did I don't even know how he knew where East was [Music] amen but my but when the fish finally spit him out do you think he was eagerly uh you know so happy says W I'm ready to go to n now and preach he grudgingly went amen he grudgingly went but he went amen Glory you know the story you know some of you went to the Sunday school but you probably say brother har I didn't hear it like that I only heard he was thrown out the boat and the fish swallowed him and spit him out in three days and there he was preached and people repented and the Lord saved them amen but see God says I've chosen you unto salvation so what he's given every man or woman on the face of their what a responsibility but he's given them an opportunity with responsibility to make a choice amen glory so who are we to say oh you deserve it look if this Corona virus is some judgment that's hidden but look judgment is coming you can't stop that amen amen glory to God look it's it's a divine plan of God Amen but you know when we're looking at divine power in the Bible the Bible says he shared that with you divine power he shared that with you his very divine nature and divine power he's given that to you and if it's divine wow excuse me who can stop him who can stop divine power no demon on Earth amen and I don't care what kind of weapon the devil can form which is being formed every day that he will never amen be able to stop divine power amen that is the very plans of God what God has planned for you no demon no devil can come to you or who he may use amen with whatever kind of weapon he'll never be able to stop you because that's the very divine power of God amen glory to God look when we're just looking at simple things in the Bible you know the story in what 2 Chronicles amen when uh uh Moab and uh and all those you know those people that and you know who they were that was across the Dead Sea that was about to attack you know Babylon I mean um Israel there was Jehoshaphat amen amen when it came to him and he said hey we saw a group of army a lot of people over there and they they they're just right now across the Dead Sea amen you know who they were they were the syrians the same people out of Nineveh going there in Chronicles there going there and they had just built the temple they had just built the temple amen and they just had amen there uh where they had the the ceremony and you can read there and when Solomon prayed and what they said that that prayer was the longest prayer it was chapter 12 to chapter 40 something they said it's the longest prayer ever prayed that was recorded in the Bible but when you begin to study the prayer it was so unique brother Tyler it was a ceremony prayer but it was a prayer where God was given the recognition amen and then when it come to where here's jehas josaphat called all the people there they are even Judah had to bring what the women and the children and they gathered there and Jehoshaphat started calling for where let's pray let's get together and let's fast we're about to get destroyed by the syrians amen so let's let's look at weapons that the devil would use on what kind of weapon God would use amen so there the story here they they're scared they're just like you and I well what are we going to do oh I'm sure when they heard of this probably some of the men was sharpening their swords maybe some of them that was good with the archery started making arrows or trying to check how many you know inventory and maybe the strong men maybe no skills and weapons or whatsoever but I'll pick up a rock maybe just some uh some kind of farm instrument or something amen but they knew someone was coming to destroy them they were there they were going to destroy and kill and take over and destroy that to Temple amen why is it that when God has built something the devil wants to come and destroy something amen every time God has blessed you amen the Devil Comes the next day and want to destroy wants to steal [Music] it amen here's something that God has ordained them to do amen that Temple was a symbol of where they could gather together amen and be under the presence of God amen amen I'm glad I can be under the presence of God no matter where I'm but see they had a temple to go to amen but I'm glad this is the temple now amen you're the temple now amen Glory Hallelujah and here now they're gathered they're praying amen but when you look at the prayer they're they they give the recognition to God they gave him to uh they they begin to remind God of his past things that he's done wonderful things that he's done amen when he delivered them out of Egypt and then through the Journey in the wilderness how God was good they begin to remind God that's right they gave him his the recognition amen that's right and Assa Assa in the same in the same story when Assa prayed to God the king Assa it was so short but it went right to the point but even in that prayer he was asking for help but he still gave God recognition and then here in the story now here they are finally God speaks and he speaks through jesel amen through a prophecy and told him go on he says go over there to a certain place amen and you'll come to a cliff he said and you'll see them out in the wilderness you'll see them the Syrian will be over there and he says go and I'll be with you I'll be with you amen but when you begin to read the story you don't have it where here Jehoshaphat you know he says in the morning because it says tomorrow tomorrow that's all they had 24 hours they didn't have weeks months to prepare they didn't they didn't have time to train anybody I don't even know if that's enough time to to lay out a blueprint and say now your archers go over here and your swordsman's here you know we'll plank them over here and you know we'll cut them off here and you know they didn't have time to sit around and make plans amen they were praying to God Amen letting God know who he really is amen and they were relying on him trusting who he was amen Glory this was the people that was about to be destroyed take whatever they had their livelihoods amen they were going to be some probably killed and some captive amen that's right yeah and now so they they prayed they got an answer from God so here it's morning time and you know when you begin to read the story they didn't start worshiping and this and that like like they didn't pray like in such a way where my you know we're going to war and it wasn't like that at [Music] all you their attitude was if in the morning and you know when they prepared they prepared as if they were going to a festival not a war amen like as if all the mothers and all the wives or whatever and all the families got their picnic basket ready amen they're going to Festival woo glory to God they were going to a war not at all amen glory to God they didn't have to carry a sword a bow a staff or any Shield or whatever it is they could think of Amen as a natural weapon to to fight the syrians amen so here the morning comes brother berer and here's Jehoshaphat he begin to talk to the people begin to encourage them and this and that and you know what he did he started appointing those he started appointing those with the bows and the the Spears and the the swords and and made and then is that I don't know if that's how your Bible reads but my Bible don't read that way singers amen he appointed singers oh what a weapon what a weapon in the hands of God amen glory to God he just appointed singers amen so they went down there worshiping God singing they were going to approach an army that's about to kill them destroy them oh but was there any worries they prayed and had an answer from God Amen so he appointed singers they went there just singing and praising God Amen it's the same today amen amen and David was given a song in his soul amen glory to God he said he was in a myy clay he was in a clang pit didn't know what to do glory to God and I believe these people were standing on the Rock they were standing on Christ amen glory they were standing on the word that was given to them amen hallelujah and you know when they sang the songs amen and they look looked over there and they saw this group of Army and this group of army started attacking each other they were so confused and then they saw this one over here and begin they they begin destroying themselves amen glory to God there's something about it being in the presence of God amen glory to God when you give it all to God and let him take care of it let me tell you something all demons will be all confused they'll not know what to do with you amen they're all wai in the morning will you get up to see what they can do amen how they can raise that temper that's in you amen or whatever hatred that's there amen but you give it to the Lord amen give your whole life to God Amen and just have that song within your soul within your heart amen and you give God recognition amen who he truly is and what he can do amen glory and don't waver from that just stand on it amen and he'll confuse every devil out there amen they'll be running at each other knocking each other out amen glory you know when when you know Joshua he was a man of war if anybody knew how to fight a war amen he knew how to sit down and and put a piece of paper down and gather his men and he could make a plan and it worked amen he was good at it and God was on his side and he never left God amen amen when when things were going wrong amen that's when Joshua say there's something wrong this is not the promise God gave me amen there's something wrong amen glory and when something's going wrong maybe you need to examine a amen you need to examine yourself because like look this is not the promise that God gave me I i' I've strayed somewhere I got off somewhere amen but look but here Joshua knew how to when they when they conquered land they conquered land amen and they got it amen but when it came when it came to Jericho it was a complete different War right amen and here there they are they're facing Jericho amen the the tallest walls there is the thickness of it Giants in the land amen and you only had you only had Joshua and Caleb that was willing to go hey man can you imagine and because of all of that and you know I just I asked the person I said you know in the Bible you know when when those men those 10 tribes that wouldn't wouldn't believe amen and and they got the people to be discouraged and got them to doubting amen and and the Lord you know put 40 more years on them so I I asked I asked I said hey do you think we want 40 more years of what's going on today do you want 40 more years of this I was like I hope I know I said I know the Bible says he's the Lord he's God he changed not he's Jesus Christ that man is the same yesterday today and forever I said I hope he ain't giv us another 40 years look there's there's enough unbelief that if he wanted to do that but look I'm ready to go home amen Noah was only given 120 years to preach the gospel look I'm not in the times but they say Le thean Church a started in 1906 this is what 2020 that's 14 years I mean 114 years my but let me tell you something if we only do have six years left that's not a long time six years can slip just like that you know I thought when we when my wife and I had children I didn't think I'd see them going to school I said uhuh rapture's coming we'll never have to put up with our kids ever going to school or public or have to deal with you know those things the pressure Y no then the day come when we had to walk into the school bus and oh our children going to school said well we'll probably never see them graduate well my youngest is 22 my oldest is 26 I said well we'll probably never see them married but every time I say something like that we always get to that place amen but but we can look back as when we just saw them born and and hold them in our arm like it was just yesterday can you imagine six years if that's all we got left look I'm not starting a Doctrine okay don't run with this amen I'm just but I I hope we're all got something within us that we're ready to go amen and Lord if I if that is look it could be today that's right that's right amen that's the way that's how our attitude should be it's today it's any minute amen glory to God you don't know when your time is also you could leave this church and you don't never know amen but here look get back to John here there he's facing Jericho amen and then when he begins to talk to God about how are we going to defeat this amen it was finally time 40 years had passed it was finally time 40 years Joshua had ways to to sit and thinking how to how to do this but when that time came talk about it it just blew his mind when God began to talk to him on how they were going to do it he says you're just going to March and you're just going to make a loud noise' and you're just going to blow the trumpets and you're just going to shout and sing and you know and then he said you're going to put the priests he says you're going to put the priests the priests and the Levites in front my can you imagine Joshua like all the years that he's conquered land and defeated them that where they went out to war or to fight those with swords and Spears and Bows sweat blood amen when it come to this time it was completely different amen says you're going to go at it just just making a loud noise blow that trumpet and you're going to place the priest and the Levites in the front and he's thinking this is odd why not the archers and the the Swordsmen and the spearmen those that were strong will put them in the front that's exactly how he would have done it right but now he's told not this time amen look God had to take them away from those things amen so they could come to a place that when it came to this to this battle they truly had to rely on God not on their self abilities amen glory to God not their their their own ideas of what weapons are Amen to fight a war amen it's same way with you're going to fight him just go sing amen glory to God look the devil always wants you to fight him at his own grounds and when you fight the devil at his own ground you'll lose every time amen amen glory but's see look we need the wisdom of God Amen and the Very wisdom of God is foolishness to to men today amen amen he's given them a simple way to amen there's only one door one way and he's given that to every men everyone on the face of this Earth amen but they still have some different idea on how to get to him yeah amen you got the homosexuals they think it's this way amen you got this group they think it's this way amen when there's only one way and then when you try to present that way to them brother Byer it's so simple that it still baffles their mind right amen you know that very way that God has provided that the whole human race can fit into that way amen but it baffles men today they're like oh that's too narrow amen that's too narrow my how many's glad to have the mind of Christ amen glory to God I'm glad he's made a way to include us amen look it might be really choppy this morning amen but look there's so many different types of weapon amen we saw in the Bible we can see and read it amen you can even picture and try to imagine it how those walls just crumbled down amen glory to God and how God was so unique and how how destroying all those walls but there was that little piece that was standing up so Rahab could be saved amen look God can take away amen God can put amen the Bible talks about how he can take away Kings and place New Kings amen he can take away a president and put a new president in there or whoever he wants in there amen God will always be in control amen and right now the way it's going on nobody knows amen it's it's it's confusing using to the world today amen but I look we're serving a God that can give you rest this morning can give you peace amen I'm not relying on who the president is amen I'm relying on my God amen glory to God look he promised the blessings but he also promised the curses amen glory amen he said I place before you life and death amen that un least he nudged you on the side and said choose life choose life amen glory to God who are you choosing today amen look and how God uses you amen can you imagine Jonah I mean uh uh job job just a simple man do I have time brother job amen can you imagine look his battle was completely different amen he was kind of he was basically all alone even his own wife turned you know and said hey why don't you just curse God and die his friends turned and accused him of secret sin amen but there's one thing job had was a he had a sacrifice amen that he had placed on the Altar and he had confidence in that sacrifice amen amen and there was a sacrifice made more than 2,000 years ago and my confidence is still on that sacrifice amen glory to God but look at him can you imagine look there was a time Lucifer was the right-hand man of God Amen he was the daykeeper he was the son of the Morning Star amen and the Bible says he was pretty much equal the only thing he couldn't was create that's why everything does today is pervert amen he just perverts what's already been created but there he is amen look and he was cut off he was what cast down out of Heaven at that time Satan and God didn't have no connection not that God didn't know what Satan was doing but there was a time Satan could not go back up there but the only reason he made it back up there was because of the fall in the garden because Satan now became the accuser so now he keeps running back to God and says H have you not noticed your servant over there but aren't you glad he's saying I don't know what you're talking about I don't know what you're talking about it's covered amen but there was a time amen when the devil amen he was they were walking for and there God said hey have you considered my servant job here he was having a communication having a conversation with Satan amen and look he's the accuser but aren't you glad one day that's going to stop that's G to He he'll never have any more connection he'll never have to accuse you of anything but there he was amen and here God makes a challenge amen look Satan never approached God and challenged God God's the one that made the challenge to Satan said hey have you you considered because all all you know when they said what are you doing here Satan says what you know what you up to oh you know I'm just I'm just walking around yeah he's just walking around amen and God says well haven't you not considered my my servant job you know he's he's upright he's perfect amen he's found Grace Glory of course you know the devil said well of course you know there's nothing I can do because you got your hands on him you know God makes a challenge amen here's a battle now look at this battle here's a battle that job never even knew that he was in amen God makes a challenge to the devil says have you considered my servant job their joke right away became the battlefield he became the battlefield either he liked it or not he didn't even know it brother berer and then so here the devil takes the challenge he says you take your hand off him I'll take the challenge God says okay he said you do whatever and he'll never curse me amen here job living a simple life amen glory to God Amen everything's going good he loved the Lord he worshiped God he was faithful he made his sacrifice when he did amen and he had confidence in that sacrifice look when the devil accused him of secret sin he knew he could be you know he was he was confident yeah amen he says no I made a sacrifice I know my sins are forgiven amen but there's one thing that job did not know he became the Battleground and he didn't even know it amen and brother Brandon says the greatest battle you'll fight amen is in the mine amen and a lot of times you're fighting yourself amen amen and look and the devil will come with all kinds of weapons cuz the Bible is not saying weapons are not form but how he forms that weapon amen it's good to be on God's side and be close to him so he can give you that discernment when he is forming a weapon and placing it there and there's your greatest battle in the mind amen so here's job being the battlefield and God and Satan is going at it and it's still the same today amen and we've become the battlefield amen but the battle is his and how many times that he said there in Chronicles in that story he said even in this battle you won't have to fight that's what they were told he says when he says even this battle jeat you won't have to fight amen glory and in your mind amen the devil will creep in and he wants you to fight him at his own ground and you and he knows you won't win amen but when you can go to this ground and then stand on this and say Satan it is written it is written it is written amen glory to God then that's when devil has to fight God at his own ground and he'll never win amen glory but can you imagine the life of Job when there he saw his children gone just like that and in an instant his wealth just like that and then before not his health begin to be gone too amen a battle he not know about he was just living the life and all of this was going on but you know what because of that sacrifice he had confidence in it that no matter what the devil did took his children took his wealth took his health amen and all of that he fell on his face and worshiped God Amen my I wonder here the devil brought a weapon called discouragement amen can you imagine if there was anyone that would really be discouraged be job heartbroken amen the devil brought a weapon on on on job
