[0:07] trouble and anguish have taken hold on
[0:10] me yet thy Commandments are my
[0:13] Delights the righteousness of thy
[0:15] testimonies is Everlasting give me
[0:18] understanding and I shall live God bless
[0:21] you may be seated brother
[0:28] Brian
[0:34] morning brothers and
[0:39] sisters God is good all the time
[0:44] right Janette knows but you know our
[0:47] enemy can be funny
[0:50] sometimes she knows what's going on in
[0:52] my heart and life right
[0:54] now I had an old customer decideed to
[0:57] call me this morning you know how the
[0:59] dev devil is sometimes he brings up the
[1:01] past when when they do so youall have to
[1:04] forgive me if I seem like I'm thinking
[1:06] about something else while I'm up here
[1:08] this morning but if you would turn with
[1:10] me to
[1:13] um the 14th chapter of Matthew I was
[1:16] thinking this morning with all that's
[1:18] going on in the world I'm not going to
[1:21] read all of this this is where Herod had
[1:23] executed John the Baptist but I was
[1:25] going to read at the end of these
[1:27] scriptures here this morning
[1:31] you
[1:33] know the only thing I can say this
[1:35] morning there's an allc and I watching
[1:37] us this morning no matter what people do
[1:39] to you no matter what they say to you or
[1:41] how they treat you five years ago six
[1:44] years ago 7 years ago we don't have a
[1:48] right as
[1:50] Christians to strike back at people
[1:52] because they didn't do us right so your
[1:54] enemy is watching you in any situation
[1:58] to see how you're going to react and how
[1:59] you're going to respond doesn't mean
[2:01] that you're makes the back of your mind
[2:03] rest I'll be honest that your mind
[2:06] doesn't rest in the back but as a
[2:08] Christian you've got to be able to
[2:09] project love and understanding even
[2:11] though they won't love and understand
[2:13] you but I don't know where I'm going
[2:16] with that but that's good
[2:18] um I was thinking here
[2:22] when I start at about the 11th verse
[2:25] here this morning no not the 11th that's
[2:28] not important
[2:30] and the 12th verse of the uh 14th
[2:33] chapter of Matthew
[2:36] here uh 13th verse I'm jumping around
[2:39] sorry when Jesus heard of it he departed
[2:42] hence excuse me I'll start at 12 and the
[2:44] disciples came and took up the body and
[2:46] buried it and went and told Jesus so
[2:49] they went and told Jesus that John the
[2:51] Baptist had been executed and when Jesus
[2:54] heard of it he departed an by ship into
[2:56] a desert bra apart and when the people
[2:59] that heard thereof they followed him on
[3:00] foot and out of the
[3:02] Cities but I was just thinking if you go
[3:05] to the other gospels Jesus brought the
[3:07] 12 discip brought his disciples off the
[3:10] scene after he heard of what happened to
[3:13] John John the Baptist and they had a
[3:15] private time together and I was thinking
[3:18] this morning in our life and in this
[3:20] world we live right now there's Great
[3:23] Tribulation going on out there in the
[3:25] world and the only way you're going to
[3:27] be able to over overcome
[3:30] in the hour that we live in is that you
[3:32] have to take that time in your heart and
[3:34] life each day and dedicate yourself that
[3:37] the only voice that you're going to
[3:39] listen to is the scriptures for the hour
[3:41] and the and the spirit of Christ as he
[3:44] leads and guides you because the world
[3:46] is ready to to fall apart it's ready to
[3:49] start shooting nuclear missiles I never
[3:52] thought 40 years ago you know 20 years
[3:55] ago we'd be where we're at today but we
[3:57] have a we have a prophetic voice for the
[4:00] hour saying that'd come a time where
[4:03] we'd be at this state where we're at
[4:06] this morning and it it requires us as
[4:09] Christians this morning to be quiet and
[4:11] take that time that the word of God
[4:14] ministers and let me just read here this
[4:16] morning uh and Jesus went for and saw
[4:19] the multitude was moved compassion
[4:21] toward them and he and he healed their
[4:24] sick and when and when the evening time
[4:27] disciples came saying that when this
[4:29] desert place and the time is now passed
[4:31] and the multiple away they may go on the
[4:34] village and buy themselves Victors so we
[4:36] know already what Jesus was going to do
[4:39] this morning and I'll just read a few
[4:41] more scriptures here but Jesus said unto
[4:43] them they need not depart give you them
[4:45] to eat and he already knew that they
[4:47] didn't have the money or the they had
[4:50] the substance to supply the needs of the
[4:52] people and they he said onto them we
[4:54] have here but Five Loaves and two fishes
[4:57] and he said to them bring them hither to
[4:59] me me and he commanded the multitude to
[5:02] sit down in the grass and took Five
[5:04] Loaves and two fishes looking up to
[5:06] heaven he blessed and break and gave the
[5:08] loaves to his disciples and the
[5:10] disciples to the multitudes and they did
[5:12] eat and were filled and they took up the
[5:14] fragments remain 12 baskets full and we
[5:18] know that he fed the 5,000 but what I
[5:20] was thinking this morning here is God is
[5:23] more than able in this age that we live
[5:25] in this morning to take care of your
[5:28] needs to watch over
[5:30] to provide for you to heal you whatever
[5:32] your need is this morning you know
[5:35] whatever I'm feeling as a human being
[5:37] whatever
[5:38] your feeling God is more than able if he
[5:41] could feed 5,000 he can heal and feed
[5:44] you this morning no matter what the
[5:45] situation is
[5:48] but I'm I wanted to jump over to Hebrews
[5:52] the 12th chapter I don't I I'm not going
[5:55] to say something I know I say it all the
[5:57] time but we're truly a needy people this
[6:00] morning as the as I see the days
[6:03] progressing in the
[6:05] world
[6:07] you there's no hope like I said I said
[6:10] it last week I keep saying it every
[6:12] there's no hope out there in the world
[6:13] your only hope is in Jesus Christ this
[6:15] morning so I'll just read what they have
[6:18] to say in Hebrews the 12th chapter here
[6:21] and it really means this is what we need
[6:23] to do each day or I need to do each day
[6:25] where see foreseeing also or can pass
[6:28] about with such great a cloud of witness
[6:31] you know we had that witness in our day
[6:33] and age in the revealing word of the
[6:36] hour we have that witness and the only
[6:38] hope he gave us in this witness that he
[6:40] gave us was to be in Jesus Christ this
[6:42] morning so great a crowd of witness let
[6:45] us lay aside every weight and sin which
[6:48] so easily beset us and let us run with
[6:51] patience the race that is set before
[6:53] us looking on to Jesus the author and
[6:56] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[6:59] that was set before him endured the
[7:00] cross despising the shame and sat down
[7:03] on the right hand of the Throne of God
[7:06] so you know when I read a scripture like
[7:08] that it tells me that you know I'm no
[7:11] better than than Christ was we all have
[7:13] to endure our sufferings we all have to
[7:16] endure our cross just like he did we you
[7:20] just have to take each day a day at a
[7:22] time for he considered them that endured
[7:24] such contradiction Sinners against
[7:26] himself these she be weary and faint
[7:29] minds and that's what I was thinking
[7:31] about this morning the age that we live
[7:33] in is trying just to Flat wear you out
[7:36] this morning it's trying to get you to
[7:38] surrender trying you give you no hope no
[7:41] desire no nothing this morning trying to
[7:43] get you just to pack it all in and go
[7:46] the other way but as a Christian it
[7:49] should make you want to get closer to
[7:50] the Cross not further away from it for
[7:54] consider him endured such cont Sinners
[7:56] against himself at least you be weary
[7:58] and faint in your minds and we have not
[8:00] resisted on the blood striving against
[8:02] sin you have forgotten the exhortation
[8:05] which speaketh unto us as children my
[8:07] sons despise not the chastening of the
[8:10] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked to
[8:13] him for whom the Lord loveth he chastens
[8:15] and scourage every son whom he shall
[8:18] receiveth if we endure Chas and God deal
[8:20] with you as with sons and if we which
[8:23] are sons in whom the father Chase not
[8:27] but if you be without chastisement where
[8:29] for are all
[8:30] partakers than than you are bastards and
[8:33] not son so what I was thinking this
[8:35] morning I don't have a lot to say and I
[8:37] thought I say I wouldn't say that this
[8:40] morning I know I say that a lot I you
[8:42] know we all are we have our own ways you
[8:44] know we all have our own
[8:46] inconsistencies the way we're brought up
[8:48] and things but the most important thing
[8:51] is as individuals this morning are you
[8:53] sold out to Jesus Christ this morning am
[8:55] I sold out this morning no matter what
[8:58] man does to me out there in the world I
[9:01] am not going to render evil for evil I'm
[9:04] always going to do the right thing
[9:06] because you know that I'll be honest
[9:07] with you in this world that we live in
[9:09] if people know that you're going to do
[9:12] the right thing because it's the right
[9:13] thing to do I'm going to tell you right
[9:15] now they're going to do everything they
[9:17] can to take advantage of you this
[9:19] morning but it doesn't give you a right
[9:21] to be to to strike back in people and
[9:25] all I could say this morning we just
[9:26] need to be closer to the cross this
[9:29] morning we need to be closer to Jesus
[9:32] Christ you see what's going on in the
[9:34] Middle East this morning you what's
[9:36] going on in the world we were given that
[9:39] time

[9:42] time clock this morning what you see
[9:44] going on with his children this morning
[9:46] that she'll let you know that the only
[9:48] hope we I I can't say this enough the
[9:51] only hope we have this morning is in

[48:16] morning certainly good to be in the
[48:18] house of the Lord and um why don't you
[48:20] just you can have your seats for just a
[48:22] second maybe we'll speak here for just a
[48:24] minute and I I too want to say how much
[48:27] I enjoyed I think that'd be all the
[48:29] music thank you musicians uh how much we
[48:31] enjoyed yesterday and just the
[48:34] atmosphere and and uh the presence and
[48:38] uh just to see the smile on faces from
[48:41] two years old to brother Glenn how old
[48:43] are you 76 76 so I think he's our oldest
[48:47] here so but just to see The Smiling
[48:49] Faces and and we sure appreciate it and
[48:53] and uh just a good uh good uh time in
[48:55] the Lord and and seeing everybody happy
[48:57] you know a lot of times our our our
[48:59] children only see each other at church
[49:01] so they don't get a lot of time to talk
[49:02] and really Fellowship outside of of
[49:05] church so events like that's good for
[49:07] them and good to uh to let them get to
[49:09] know each other and and appreciate each
[49:11] other so um just uh just want to say a
[49:15] quick thing or two about the and just
[49:17] what I've seen in current events and
[49:19] stuff and it's no secret brother Brian
[49:21] talked about it what's going on in the
[49:23] world and and with Israel and attacks
[49:26] you know it's it's just a late late hour
[49:29] and uh you know uh we know brother Billy
[49:32] Paul passed away last week and and I
[49:35] told my wife I said uh you know when
[49:38] they were kind of announcing it looked
[49:40] like he was fixing the crossover I said
[49:41] this could really shake the message
[49:42] World up and U and I said but you know
[49:47] we have to look at it and and and know
[49:48] that God's in control of it all and so I
[49:51] wanted to look up that that thought and
[49:52] I found it and and it's it's in a mess
[49:54] too but it's you can find in the book of
[49:56] the acts of the Prophet where um uh
[50:00] brother Perry green talks about his
[50:02] interview with brother Billy Paul and so
[50:04] forth and then I thought it was kind of
[50:05] as I read through it he was talking
[50:07] about the destructions and the things
[50:08] that are to come to pass and I heard uh
[50:12] I was listening to brother Ron Spencer
[50:14] preach I guess it was last week he was
[50:16] preaching at his home church and you
[50:18] know the the world's doom day clock uh
[50:22] was set at 3 minutes I think back in the
[50:24] 60s or whatever
[50:26] um and then recently like last year year
[50:29] and a half it was set at 90 seconds and
[50:32] brother Ron said he saw and where
[50:35] somebody was talking about it now it's
[50:36] at 18
[50:38] seconds so we're close we're close 18
[50:43] seconds and uh so this little little
[50:46] excerpt here where brother random was
[50:47] talking about California you know we
[50:50] can't take for granted the prophecies
[50:52] that we've heard and the prophecies the
[50:53] things we know um because they we seen
[50:56] them come to pass time and time and time
[50:58] again so we can't take them for granted
[51:01] and he said California would would go
[51:03] into the ocean and it'll send a Title
[51:05] Wave all the way back into Kentucky and
[51:08] so it's you know I'm I'm hoping we're
[51:10] gone at that time but it it will happen
[51:14] um and you know the the statement that
[51:17] that I thought would shake the world
[51:18] would be where uh brother Bram said he
[51:21] turned to Billy Paul and and and uh he
[51:24] told him he said where you're standing
[51:26] downtown Los Angeles and brother Billy
[51:29] Paul replied he said yeah where you're
[51:31] standing in front of May Company
[51:32] downtown Los Angeles Billy he said I may
[51:36] not be here but you won't be an old man
[51:39] until shark swim right where you are
[51:41] standing well he's not an old man
[51:44] anymore and you know brother I think
[51:46] brother Potter made that statement years
[51:48] ago and I thought wonder what he means
[51:50] by that you know he kind of tried to hit
[51:52] on it but you know brother Billy Paul's
[51:55] not an old old man anymore he's in a
[51:56] body about 18 years old so you know I'm
[51:59] not trying to to to to be anything or
[52:02] say anything it's just uh just be aware
[52:04] of your surroundings and be aware of the
[52:06] events that's that's taking place around
[52:09] us so um if the if the world scientists
[52:12] and and people that's watching the world
[52:14] event say we're 18 seconds from from the
[52:18] end there's probably something to it
[52:20] because they sure they sure don't want
[52:21] to admit that but it's happening so
[52:24] stand with me and we'll get into the
[52:26] scriptures
[52:29] and good to have my Mom and Dad here
[52:32] with us this morning and and I know they
[52:35] watch online a lot but certainly
[52:36] certainly thankful to have them with us
[52:38] and um just a just an honor I'm I'm I'm
[52:42] who I am because of those two in the
[52:44] natural sense so I'm very thankful for
[52:46] my parents turn with me if you would to
[52:49] Second Kings chapter 6 and
[52:52] 14 we're going to try not to keep you
[52:54] long I know every everybody's probably
[52:55] tired and weary

[55:02] going to take my time I'm trying not not
[55:04] to hold you long but I do want to take
[55:06] my time to get started here and and lay
[55:08] a foundation I want to look at a
[55:10] familiar incident that happened to the
[55:12] prophet of the hour and he tells a story
[55:14] like this he said seeing God come in
[55:18] action isn't it wonderful he said here
[55:21] some time ago at Arlington Texas I was
[55:23] down at a hotel where I was staying and
[55:25] I heard a woman cry and I thought
[55:27] somebody is in trouble and I turned
[55:30] around to look and it was just coming
[55:31] through the little place and these two
[55:33] young girls probably in their early 20s
[55:35] 21 22 standing there a blonde and
[55:38] blackheaded girl they had their arms
[55:40] around one another and they were weeping
[55:42] and I said pardon me Miss I'm a minister
[55:45] can I help you and she said yes brother
[55:47] Brown I I knew I knew she knew me and I
[55:50] said what's the matter and she said well
[55:53] we couldn't get a prayer card to get in
[55:54] line
[55:55] and we know you the hotel you were
[55:57] staying in so we stayed right here and
[55:59] thought maybe if your Shadow might pass
[56:01] over my friend she would be healed Oh my
[56:05] he said I said what's the matter with
[56:06] her and she says she's mental and I
[56:09] brought her here and she's standing
[56:11] there in that great faith not a make Bel
[56:13] but a real faith and a vision broke
[56:16] forth and I said yes you come from
[56:18] Northern Texas near lck I said you
[56:21] brought her here in a yellow Buick car
[56:23] coming along there was half the Road was
[56:25] concrete the other half was tar and I
[56:27] said you started to turn around the
[56:29] corner you both were laughing you had
[56:31] the top down you almost had a wck can
[56:33] you imagine somebody sitting there and
[56:35] telling you the whole tra traffic that
[56:37] you just took the whole travel plans and
[56:41] and and you just screamed at the top of
[56:42] her voice and she just screamed at the
[56:45] top of her voice and I said thus sayith
[56:46] the Lord she's healed that's right and
[56:49] he said the next day she set the town on
[56:53] fire said she stirred the nest of the
[56:58] devil we need to get to a place that
[57:01] when God moves in our lives that we set
[57:04] the world on fire that we set the world
[57:07] on fire and we stir the nest of the
[57:10] devil now don't think that's always
[57:12] going to come back and bring goodness to
[57:14] you and glory to you because that means
[57:15] you're setting yourself up for maybe a
[57:17] little bit of hardship because he says
[57:19] as as she stirred the nest of the devil
[57:22] he said if you want to stir the devil
[57:23] start preaching Divine he
[57:25] he said Peter preached on the day of
[57:27] Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were saved and
[57:29] Satan never
[57:32] moved I'm talking about God In Action in
[57:35] our day I'm talking about God moving on
[57:37] the scene and answering your prayers I'm
[57:40] talking about healings taking place I'm
[57:42] talking about Deliverance taking place
[57:44] I'm talking about people who are already
[57:46] saved putting the power and
[57:48] demonstration of God into
[57:50] action and he says that's right the
[57:53] devil don't like to see God God display
[57:55] his
[57:57] power he thinks he's got a lot of power
[58:00] but he's finished our Christ is
[58:03] predominant take the initiative don't
[58:05] let him push something on
[58:09] you because so many times we find
[58:12] ourselves we let Satan creep into our
[58:14] lives and into our homes and into our
[58:16] bodies and into our even our minds you
[58:18] know and we allow Satan to come in and
[58:22] the next thing you know he's pushing
[58:24] things on you and he said don't let him
[58:27] do that don't let him push things on you
[58:29] but put God's power on display that's
[58:32] you and I displaying the power of God
[58:35] and listen what happens he said a couple
[58:37] of days after that here come brother
[58:39] Baxter in and said brother Bram he said
[58:41] the fats in the fire and I thought I
[58:44] don't know that I've ever heard that one
[58:46] and I know a lot of these little slangs
[58:47] and says but he said the Fat's in the
[58:50] fire and I thought I'm gonna look that
[58:51] up sure enough it means a course of
[58:53] action Within evitable bad consequences
[58:57] has
[58:59] begun there's trouble ahead for example
[59:02] now the fats in the fire the boss
[59:04] arrived early and we haven't even
[59:05] started work he said it's an or it says
[59:08] it's an
[59:09] expression and so think about this it's
[59:12] something that leads to trouble that has
[59:14] started and looks like it can't be
[59:17] stopped because this young lady
[59:20] receiveed her Deliverance because the
[59:23] power of God moved onto the SE she
[59:25] stirred the devil's nest and set the
[59:27] town on fire now the Fat's in the fire
[59:31] the heat is on and brother bter comes in
[59:33] and says the fats and the fire basically
[59:36] what he's saying is man brother brandom
[59:38] you've really done it this time you've
[59:40] really done it this time because you've
[59:41] set a chain of events into action and
[59:45] the devil is
[59:47] mad the devil is mad in this hour
[59:50] because God's people are living lives of
[59:53] Deliverance God's people people are
[59:54] seeing Miracles God's people are moving
[59:57] on up to a higher level that they've
[1:00:00] never seen
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:05] before Lord and he looked at him and he
[1:00:07] said what's the
[1:00:09] matter what's the matter he said they're
[1:00:11] going to expose you tonight as Simon the
[1:00:13] Sorcerer come on he said oh is that
[1:00:17] so is that so he said yeah brother
[1:00:20] brandom he said they got cards all over
[1:00:22] the city and then two girls you know the
[1:00:24] ones that was healed I said yes he said
[1:00:26] they're downstairs and they're crying
[1:00:28] and they're packing up their clothes to
[1:00:29] go home he said oh it's pathetic brother
[1:00:31] brandham he says what I said well what's
[1:00:33] the matter and he said well they said
[1:00:36] they hated it because their testimony
[1:00:38] had stirred up such an awful road down
[1:00:41] there they felt sorrow they felt bad
[1:00:45] because their testimony of going out and
[1:00:47] say come and
[1:00:49] see let me show you what God has done
[1:00:51] for me they they felt sorrowful because
[1:00:54] they're testimony was getting the
[1:00:55] prophet in trouble and he says so he
[1:00:58] says they went down there he says you
[1:00:59] need to go down there because the FBI is
[1:01:02] going to get you tonight and expose
[1:01:06] you these two girls are going out with a
[1:01:09] testimony and a witness of what God's
[1:01:11] done in their life see what God has done
[1:01:13] for me and the devil says I'm going to
[1:01:16] expose you you see what's happening it's
[1:01:20] always a
[1:01:21] conflict it's always about ble a good
[1:01:25] versus evil and so he says oh okay he
[1:01:28] says if that's right I ought to be
[1:01:31] exposed he's not
[1:01:35] afraid if that's right I ought to be
[1:01:37] exposed he says well you better get in
[1:01:39] there and talk to them they're
[1:01:40] downstairs he said okay he said went to
[1:01:42] the room he said I knocked on the door
[1:01:44] and they were crying and packing their
[1:01:45] clothes these two young ladies 21 22 and
[1:01:49] said brother Brandon we're so sorry
[1:01:52] we're so sorry he says what are you
[1:01:53] sorry about
[1:01:55] and she says well uh We've caused you so
[1:01:59] much trouble and we've got you in
[1:02:00] trouble and said it's all over he said
[1:02:03] trouble you have over someone getting
[1:02:08] healed you see how the devil tries to
[1:02:10] take a good thing and pervert it into a
[1:02:13] Bad Thing sure these girls now have a
[1:02:16] guilty conscience because of what God
[1:02:17] has done for them we don't have to live
[1:02:19] a guilty conscience because of what God
[1:02:21] has done for us we can still stand there
[1:02:24] and say a testimony look what God has
[1:02:26] done in my life I was a sinner you were
[1:02:30] a sinner we were all liars born in this
[1:02:33] world speaking Lies come and see what
[1:02:36] God has
[1:02:37] done and these girls are sitting
[1:02:41] there and he says you ain't got me in no
[1:02:45] trouble the devil's in
[1:02:48] trouble he says that's the one that's in
[1:02:50] trouble not me and she said well brother
[1:02:54] brand said we're so sorry we're we sat
[1:02:56] down by a woman today and she said are
[1:02:58] you in that brandom
[1:03:00] party and I said no ma'am I guess she
[1:03:03] kind of misunderstood what what she was
[1:03:05] asking she said oh yes you are I think
[1:03:07] Peter was in that place one time yeah oh
[1:03:10] yes you are said you just said no no I
[1:03:13] just got healed over there the other
[1:03:16] night in a hotel he said the other night
[1:03:18] when when he prayed we my my friend got
[1:03:20] healed and she said listen that man's a
[1:03:22] that man is a witch and we know
[1:03:26] it and she says W said she said lady my
[1:03:31] friend come with me that was going into
[1:03:34] an insane
[1:03:36] institution and to test her but today
[1:03:39] she's perfectly
[1:03:41] normal she's perfectly normal and she
[1:03:44] said oh yes now listen you listen to how
[1:03:47] the devil will come back against this
[1:03:48] and he he'll put his his own
[1:03:50] interjection in there and she said oh I
[1:03:52] know this woman that she was talking to
[1:03:55] I put a boy in his meeting one time that
[1:03:57] had TB and he went up there and did his
[1:03:59] Hocus Pocus over
[1:04:01] him he said and the baby got over the TB
[1:04:05] but it was the
[1:04:08] devil and any and brother Brown said
[1:04:10] anybody that knows no don't know no more
[1:04:12] about that knows that the devil don't
[1:04:14] have one power or nothing to heal I
[1:04:16] challenge that he said if the devil that
[1:04:18] can heal then he's he's in cahoots with
[1:04:21] God and the Bible says I am the Lord
[1:04:24] that heals all thy
[1:04:28] diseases and so she listen

[1:07:22] timeline of what's Happening in the
[1:07:24] world and the battle is Raging we can't
[1:07:27] be afraid to put a little fat in the
[1:07:28] fire we can't be afraid to stir the
[1:07:31] devil up a little bit we can't be afraid
[1:07:33] to step up and say this is what God is
[1:07:35] capable of through me through you
[1:07:38] through his
[1:07:40] Believers we can't
[1:07:42] limit what God can do brothers and
[1:07:45] sisters it's a time that we Face Satan
[1:07:48] face to face toet to toe and under the
[1:07:51] inspiration of the Holy Ghost let the
[1:07:52] world know that Satan you ain't got
[1:07:55] nothing on
[1:07:58] us because under the Holy Ghost you're
[1:08:00] exactly what God
[1:08:03] is and if and if Satan don't have
[1:08:05] nothing on God with you being filled
[1:08:07] with the Holy Ghost and on the
[1:08:08] inspiration of the Holy Ghost how can he
[1:08:10] have anything on
[1:08:15] you thank you Lord you say how are we
[1:08:17] going to do
[1:08:18] it how how can we prove it let me tell
[1:08:21] you something you were born to overcome
[1:08:23] yeah you were born to conquer you were
[1:08:26] born to defeat Satan's Army and the Ws
[1:08:28] of the devil in this last day you were
[1:08:30] born to be a witness and I know that
[1:08:33] there is a greater force than
[1:08:35] cancer listen to me there is a greater
[1:08:38] force than cancer than fear than doubt
[1:08:40] than nervousness there's a greater force
[1:08:43] than all of that this morning and if all
[1:08:45] of Heaven
[1:08:49] stands who can stand against
[1:08:52] us
[1:08:55] how can we lose I said how can we
[1:08:58] lose how can you lose sister Alicia how
[1:09:01] can he lose how can he
[1:09:06] lose how can you
[1:09:13] lose Elisha and his servants are
[1:09:16] surrounded by an enemy Army and Elijah's
[1:09:20] servant is is panicking and he's saying
[1:09:22] we're surrounded
[1:09:24] there's only two of us and there's an
[1:09:26] entire Army that's coming and going to
[1:09:28] take
[1:09:29] us they set the Army against us to come
[1:09:32] and get us and destroy us they're coming
[1:09:34] after
[1:09:35] us brothers and sisters let us God help
[1:09:38] us to realize that we're living in a
[1:09:40] spiritual warfare this morning and that
[1:09:42] God's Army knows no
[1:09:45] defeat greater is he that is in me than
[1:09:47] he that is in the
[1:09:48] world and
[1:09:50] El sitting there looking at this and
[1:09:52] Elisha now can you imagine the prophet
[1:09:55] of that hour
[1:09:57] calmly looking around and looks at his
[1:09:59] servant and says Don't Be
[1:10:02] Afraid don't be afraid for those that
[1:10:06] are with us are more than those that are
[1:10:08] with
[1:10:10] them and I can imagine at this point
[1:10:13] he's looking around and he says man this
[1:10:16] guy may be a prophet but he ain't no
[1:10:18] math magician
[1:10:20] mathematician he ain't no statistician
[1:10:23] but cuz there's two of us and thousands
[1:10:26] of
[1:10:28] them and he's sitting there
[1:10:30] panicking and he's panicking and he's
[1:10:33] looking and he's thinking there's no way
[1:10:36] we're going to get out of
[1:10:38] this sometimes Satan will tell
[1:10:41] you yeah that's right it's what you see
[1:10:45] what the doctors tell you what's your
[1:10:47] financial advisors tell you what the
[1:10:49] therapist tells you what your boss tells
[1:10:51] you what your neighbor tells you the
[1:10:54] tumor is too big the anxiety can't be
[1:10:58] overcome the fear is too
[1:11:01] real are you with
[1:11:04] me and you hear these things over and
[1:11:06] over it's terminal your marriage is lost
[1:11:10] it's
[1:11:13] genetic but somewhere down the line we
[1:11:16] have to look at there and be like Elisha
[1:11:18] and open our eyes of spiritual eyes and
[1:11:21] say there's Chariots of Fire all around
[1:11:25] me and these Chariots of Fire are angels
[1:11:28] sent from God that will not let me be we
[1:11:32] have to understand there's an army that
[1:11:34] stands behind
[1:11:36] us that is greater than any military
[1:11:40] force amen and I thought about this and
[1:11:44] I hadn't told this but I'm going to tell
[1:11:47] it I think brother Tommy will let me
[1:11:51] brother Tommy went through we know we've
[1:11:53] heard his testimon we know we we were
[1:11:55] everybody was here when it happened he
[1:11:57] went through a through an illness a
[1:12:00] disease that he should have dropped
[1:12:03] dead I'm a nurse sister Le is a nurse my
[1:12:06] wife's a nurse Hannah's a nurse other
[1:12:08] nurse brother Troy's got nursing
[1:12:09] background medical background he should
[1:12:11] have dropped dead just like that when
[1:12:14] you tear the aorta the biggest blood
[1:12:17] vessel in your body there's no stopping
[1:12:19] it but God had other
[1:12:22] plans God other plans we begin to get on
[1:12:25] our knees and we begin to pray for
[1:12:27] brother
[1:12:28] Tommy we begin to pray and we begin to
[1:12:31] believe that God can still work
[1:12:40] miracles was there time of trouble
[1:12:42] brother Tommy was there time of trouble
[1:12:46] did you lay in a hospital did you fear
[1:12:49] he was scared no doubt he was
[1:12:51] scared but we were believing for him he
[1:12:55] had began to believe and as he began to
[1:12:58] get better and better he can see the
[1:13:00] working of God in his life and know that
[1:13:03] I should be a dead man but God is
[1:13:05] raising me
[1:13:07] up I thought man this is it he's good
[1:13:10] he's he's he's got they got him on the
[1:13:11] right medication now and he's gonna he's
[1:13:13] gonna pull through
[1:13:14] this it wasn't long I preached and he
[1:13:16] come up here to The Altar and he said
[1:13:18] I'm throwing my medicine away I want you
[1:13:20] to pray for
[1:13:22] me
[1:13:26] think about
[1:13:27] it and I'm standing right
[1:13:30] here and I got my arm running he said
[1:13:33] I'm throwing my medicine away and I want
[1:13:34] you to pray for
[1:13:37] me I'm a registered
[1:13:40] nurse so from the natural side I'm
[1:13:43] wanting to say man you can't do
[1:13:46] that you you you you you you you you you
[1:13:50] you can't do that brother throw away am
[1:13:52] I right from the natural
[1:13:56] side but I said his faith is greater
[1:13:58] than my faith right it's not for me to
[1:14:01] question his
[1:14:02] faith I said I'll pray I'll pray for you
[1:14:06] so we begin to pray and we prayed right
[1:14:08] there at the bottom of that Altar and we
[1:14:10] pray that if he want to get off his
[1:14:12] medication that he could back it up by
[1:14:14] doctor's proof that he's getting better
[1:14:17] and he got as far as I know he got off
[1:14:19] of it he may still be on something I
[1:14:20] don't know but he come back later and he
[1:14:22] had testimony and and images that God
[1:14:25] had moved in his life and that the
[1:14:27] terror had begun to heal and that he was
[1:14:29] getting better and better he let science
[1:14:32] prove that my God is the great
[1:14:43] physician so the doctors can say
[1:14:46] terminal all they want they don't know
[1:14:49] my
[1:14:50] god when the doctors say terminal I say
[1:14:53] come and
[1:14:54] see when the doctor say it can't be
[1:14:57] fixed I say come and
[1:15:00] see when your marriage looks hopeless I
[1:15:02] say come and
[1:15:05] see anything we go through it can be the
[1:15:09] simplest of
[1:15:11] things let me tell you I I'll just give
[1:15:13] you a little testimony you know we and
[1:15:15] you know our little side business we
[1:15:16] raise flowers well this year we put out
[1:15:19] all our flowers like we normally do we
[1:15:20] cut back some just just because we had
[1:15:22] some we couldn't move last year we felt
[1:15:24] good about it and I was sitting
[1:15:27] there and I started calling some of the
[1:15:30] people that we sell
[1:15:31] to well this one of our biggest
[1:15:34] customers decided not to buy this
[1:15:38] year so now we got like thousand plants
[1:15:41] we don't even know what we're going to
[1:15:42] do
[1:15:42] with thousand
[1:15:47] plants another one that I called yeah my
[1:15:50] kids not playing on that team anymore
[1:15:51] we're not going to we're not going to do
[1:15:52] it this year we do fundraisers for teams
[1:15:54] and
[1:15:56] schools call another
[1:15:59] one well yeah we we've had a change in
[1:16:02] coaches we're not going to we're not
[1:16:03] going to be doing that this year they
[1:16:05] decided they want to do something
[1:16:06] different these numbers are adding
[1:16:09] up and we're growing
[1:16:11] flowers and I thought to myself I said
[1:16:14] there's one of two things I can do I can
[1:16:15] either
[1:16:17] panic I can panic and throw in the tow
[1:16:20] and think man there's no way we're going
[1:16:21] to come out of this or I can say come
[1:16:23] and see and watch God move on the scene
[1:16:27] so we begin to pray and we begin to pray
[1:16:29] and my dad he said in the eye we'll get
[1:16:31] rid of him it'll be all
[1:16:33] right that's and he's generally not the
[1:16:36] most
[1:16:38] optimistic I'm G to step over
[1:16:41] here I don't want him throwing a song
[1:16:43] book at
[1:16:44] me and he telling me it's going to be
[1:16:48] all right
[1:16:51] yeah God can move on the S
[1:16:54] we picked up a new customer and we
[1:16:56] picked up another new customer and we
[1:16:58] picked up another new customer and they
[1:17:01] want more next year and they want more
[1:17:03] this year and we cleared off all of our
[1:17:06] moms about four weeks before we normally
[1:17:09] clear them off so and
[1:17:15] gone let me add to
[1:17:18] it disease is a problem you got to watch
[1:17:20] in these flowers we normally raised
[1:17:23] about 5,000 or so 6,000 moms and we
[1:17:25] would lose 100 200 to disease we cut
[1:17:29] back our numbers this year we raised
[1:17:31] about 4,500 to 5,000 I don't know and if
[1:17:35] we had have lost a two or three hundred
[1:17:36] to disease we'd have been short on
[1:17:38] months
[1:17:39] probably I think we lost
[1:17:45] seven every everybody else around the
[1:17:49] community was saying man we're losing
[1:17:50] them left and right disease is going
[1:17:52] through this is going through that's
[1:17:53] going through we're losing we've lost
[1:17:55] this many we go by mum pad there be
[1:17:57] piles of mums off to the side that's
[1:17:58] disease stricken
[1:18:02] [Applause]
[1:18:04] seven God is
[1:18:07] mindful if you will just look Satan in
[1:18:09] the eyes and say come and see watch what
[1:18:12] God does for me my family my children my
[1:18:16] church and let him work on the
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:21] scene
[1:18:23] Ela he says oh Lord please open his eyes
[1:18:27] that he can see and the Lord opened the
[1:18:29] eyes of his servant and all these horses
[1:18:31] and chariots are there and all of a
[1:18:33] sudden the servant realized yes yes
[1:18:35] we're more than able we're more than
[1:18:38] them with that Army and that's the way
[1:18:40] we need to live on day by day we are
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:48] more I got a I got to
[1:18:51] uh
[1:18:53] I got to speak tomorrow at Sister Mary
[1:18:56] rli's funeral and
[1:18:59] burial they asked me to come and speak
[1:19:01] so I'm going to speak and and I got to
[1:19:02] thinking about it and was talking to
[1:19:04] Debbie her daughter and you know Sister
[1:19:06] Mary if you remember she would always
[1:19:09] always sing that song There are angels
[1:19:13] all around
[1:19:14] us and she it was her signature song and
[1:19:17] she would sing that song over and over
[1:19:19] in a world full of trouble as we travel
[1:19:21] along God is our father we're on our way
[1:19:24] home if forces of evil ever close in on
[1:19:27] you Jesus has promised this is what he
[1:19:29] will do there are angels all around
[1:19:34] us and I thought about that and I
[1:19:36] thought you know this goes so well with
[1:19:38] what Elisha saw and what elishah did for
[1:19:40] his servant Elijah and he looks and he
[1:19:42] sees these chariots and I just say God
[1:19:45] help us realize in this Unseen World
[1:19:47] you're pushing us every single day to be
[1:19:50] better and and stronger and more full of
[1:19:53] the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:19:59] power the spiritual
[1:20:01] forces they're pulling
[1:20:05] us we're just we're just trapped in a at
[1:20:08] this point we're just in a trap we're
[1:20:11] trapped on this Earth in a time in a
[1:20:12] moment of time between two
[1:20:15] forces this one's pulling this one's
[1:20:19] pulling somebody said the other day what
[1:20:21] is it you take one step forward two you
[1:20:23] get KN two back and it feels that way
[1:20:26] sometime but help us to realize that
[1:20:27] these forces of evil that are pulling us
[1:20:29] they're trying to pull us away from God
[1:20:31] if it's not something that you would be
[1:20:33] willing I liked what one person
[1:20:36] said maybe I think I think it'll be
[1:20:40] okay young lady was wearing stuff she
[1:20:42] shouldn't have been
[1:20:45] wearing
[1:20:48] okay Grandma tells her dad she shouldn't
[1:20:50] be wearing that
[1:20:53] stay out of our business kind of thing
[1:20:55] you know that was the reply The
[1:20:58] Comeback and she said she shouldn't be
[1:21:00] wearing anything to school she wouldn't
[1:21:01] wear to
[1:21:04] church let that sink
[1:21:06] in when we allow things to start pulling
[1:21:09] us and pulling
[1:21:12] us things get a little little less
[1:21:16] important you know what I'm
[1:21:18] saying little little more showing a
[1:21:23] little less
[1:21:24] spiritualness a little more of this kind
[1:21:26] of music or that kind of
[1:21:30] music next thing you know you you you
[1:21:32] you find your children listening to
[1:21:33] music they shouldn't be listening to
[1:21:36] yeah and I'm I'm a person that thinks
[1:21:38] you got to be there for your children
[1:21:39] you got to be there Holy Ghost and you
[1:21:41] got to do things but you also got to let
[1:21:43] them find out where the rubber meets the
[1:21:45] road they've got to have their own
[1:21:48] experience so you can't go in there and
[1:21:50] just constantly bang bang bang bang bang
[1:21:52] this is the way it is this is my
[1:21:56] opinion but I there there's a line
[1:21:58] there's a limit to where we say no this
[1:22:00] ain't
[1:22:01] happening you're gone too far and then
[1:22:03] we let God come back in and take over
[1:22:05] and let God begin to move on the scene
[1:22:07] and let God pull them back over this way
[1:22:09] if Satan's pulling this way we need to
[1:22:11] get on that tug-of war rope brothers
[1:22:13] sisters when your children are being
[1:22:15] pulled this way grab a hold to that rope
[1:22:18] it's like uh brother brother Austin said
[1:22:20] or brother Josh said he said you ever
[1:22:22] wants to real tug of war match on
[1:22:24] YouTube I said no not really he said you
[1:22:26] to look it up he said they dig
[1:22:29] trenches he said they dig trenches and
[1:22:31] they sit down they get in those trenches
[1:22:34] and they'll all sit there and they'll
[1:22:35] say
[1:22:40] who
[1:22:42] P so when you see your loved on you see
[1:22:45] your children you see people and he say
[1:22:47] pull a certain way we all need to get
[1:22:49] together and grab a hold and say Boo
[1:22:52] brother sister pull brother sister pull
[1:22:55] and pull on God and let God pull our
[1:22:58] children back into the back into the
[1:23:00] where they need to

[1:30:37] day where a man said the devil got
[1:30:39] before him and he said he was just a
[1:30:41] little bitty old devil and he said boo
[1:30:43] and I jumped
[1:30:45] back and he said I jump back and every
[1:30:49] time that the devil would holler boo I
[1:30:50] would jump back and the devil get
[1:30:53] bigger and he said over and over I'd get
[1:30:56] little he'd get bigger because the devil
[1:30:58] kept saying boo and I get smaller each
[1:31:01] time that I jump back and he'd get
[1:31:03] bigger and I
[1:31:05] said I know I've got to fight
[1:31:10] him sometimes fighting the devil ain't
[1:31:13] always a challenge we go looking for
[1:31:16] yeah but you can't shy
[1:31:19] away he said I know I had fight him and
[1:31:23] I said I looked around and I thought
[1:31:26] what I found the word of
[1:31:30] God and I rolled it into my hand and the
[1:31:34] devil said boo and I said
[1:31:38] boo and he said and and when he said
[1:31:40] that and when I said boo back every time

[1:34:59] platform let God know who is who that's
[1:35:03] right and I said if I'm if I be falsely

[1:37:17] our people come and see how God can move
[1:37:20] in our lives
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:25] there's a man by the name of
[1:37:28] Daniel there's a man by the name of
[1:37:30] Daniel and he was in a Babylon
[1:37:31] Babylonian Kingdom Under the rule of
[1:37:34] Darius and Darius liked Daniel so much
[1:37:37] because Daniel was so wise he was a man
[1:37:39] about 80 years old when all this
[1:37:41] happened and he he so wise and he was so
[1:37:44] popular with Darius and Darius put him
[1:37:46] up into into a little bit of the
[1:37:47] hierarchy well that made people jealous
[1:37:50] you ever know notice how the devil gets
[1:37:53] jealous you can be doing good you're
[1:37:55] doing something for God you're exactly
[1:37:56] where you're supposed to be and somebody
[1:37:57] sees
[1:38:01] it look at him he's trying to do this I
[1:38:04] was supposed to do
[1:38:06] that
[1:38:08] jealous and here's Daniel now sitting
[1:38:11] there and so these jealous bodies come
[1:38:13] and say

[1:38:17] put in place that only prayers can be PR
[1:38:22] is to our God well you know Darius
[1:38:24] wasn't thinking too much Darius wasn't
[1:38:27] thinking too much and he looks there and
[1:38:29] he says you know what that's a great
[1:38:30] idea we love our Gods so everybody
[1:38:34] should pray to our gods and if they
[1:38:35] don't well we'll put them in the lines
[1:38:38] then he he forgot about old Daniel and
[1:38:42] then he realized as as Daniel goes home
[1:38:45] and he begins to pray and they come and
[1:38:46] warn don't you can't pray to your God

[1:39:05] and they put him right there at the pit
[1:39:07] of the Lion's Den and Darius now is in a
[1:39:09] panic because oh no this is Daniel this
[1:39:11] is my
[1:39:12] favorite and and Darius is saying I'm
[1:39:15] I'm so sorry Daniel I'm so sorry but I

[1:39:34] night long worried about Daniel and as
[1:39:36] they threw man he said I hope your God
[1:39:38] can can save you
[1:39:42] Daniel and all night long Darius is
[1:39:45] losing sleep and Darius comes back on
[1:39:48] the next day all panicked and nervous
[1:39:50] and nervous and hands are sweating and
[1:39:52] he looks down there and he says

[1:40:30] it says instantly the Lions broke every
[1:40:32] bone in their
[1:40:35] body come and see what God can do come
[1:40:38] and see what God can do you I can
[1:40:42] imagine I can
[1:40:43] imagine as as Daniel's down there and no
[1:40:47] doubt when he first got through down in
[1:40:49] there maybe those lines kind of snarled
[1:40:53] up and Daniel said
[1:41:02] boo come and see what God can
[1:41:06] do there was a lady of ill Fame I'm
[1:41:09] hurrying Lady of ill Fame all of her
[1:41:13] money invested into a an alabaster
[1:41:16] box and she looks over to the side and
[1:41:18] sees her sees her savior sees her Jes
[1:41:20] Jesus at a party at a get together
[1:41:25] nothing more than to make a mockery out
[1:41:26] of Jesus Christ and there she sees him
[1:41:30] sitting in the corner dirty filthy
[1:41:32] stinky dirty feet and she goes over
[1:41:36] there and she begins to look and she
[1:41:37] begins to take all of her life's savings
[1:41:41] and earnings of ill
[1:41:43] Fame the money she made as a
[1:41:46] prostitute and she invested into God
[1:41:53] you think all eyes wasn't on that
[1:41:55] scene you see we never know who's
[1:41:57] watching but I promise you Somebody's
[1:42:01] Watching somebody's
[1:42:03] watching and she begins to S over there
[1:42:06] and she breaks the bo the the the box of
[1:42:08] alabaster with the perfume and the oil
[1:42:10] and she begins to shed her tears on the
[1:42:12] feet of Jesus and she begins to anoint
[1:42:14] his feet with oil and she's crying tears
[1:42:17] and tears because she knows who she is
[1:42:19] and she knows who he
[1:42:22] is and and and then they come down there
[1:42:24] and Simon comes down there and says hey
[1:42:27] this woman is going to
[1:42:28] ruin your
[1:42:32] reputation this woman is going to ruin
[1:42:34] your reputation she's no more than a
[1:42:38] prostitute she's going to ruin your
[1:42:40] reputation but you see that ain't the
[1:42:43] truth you that that can't her reputation
[1:42:45] couldn't have been ruined because
[1:42:46] Jesus's reputation is built on
[1:42:49] sinners do you realize that Jesus's
[1:42:52] reputation is not built on Kings it's
[1:42:55] not built on gold it's not built on
[1:42:57] riches it's not built on cattle it's
[1:43:00] built on you and I who wasn't
[1:43:03] worthy and because we and I wasn't
[1:43:05] worthy and we were Sinners his
[1:43:07] reputation says I went to the cross and
[1:43:09] I died for those people that's the
[1:43:11] reputation of Jesus and now all eyes are
[1:43:14] on this and Simon it says hey you can't
[1:43:17] let her do that you're you you're making
[1:43:18] a mockery of my of my party here
[1:43:21] and Jesus says
[1:43:25] Simon I got something to say to
[1:43:28] you look at your
[1:43:30] Bible Jesus speaks to him I got
[1:43:32] something to say to you Simon you left
[1:43:35] me here dirty you left me here filthy
[1:43:38] you left me here stinking you didn't
[1:43:40] offer me any drink you didn't offer me
[1:43:42] refreshment you didn't offer my to wash
[1:43:43] my feet and this woman here has not
[1:43:46] ceased to stop washing my
[1:43:51] feet come and
[1:43:54] see can you imagine as she looks up at
[1:43:57] Jesus and the tears are running down her
[1:43:59] face and her hair is all down and
[1:44:01] drenched with the oil that she'd been
[1:44:03] washing his feet with and she looks up
[1:44:05] and wonders what will he
[1:44:09] say and she says
[1:44:11] forgiven she hears
[1:44:16] forgiven come and
[1:44:19] see come and
[1:44:21] see about the 11:00 in the day Jesus as
[1:44:25] sends his disciples into the city go get
[1:44:27] us some
[1:44:28] food I'm going to wait here by the
[1:44:31] well and Jesus is waiting by the well
[1:44:33] and here comes this this uh Samaritan
[1:44:39] woman about 11:00 in the day keep that
[1:44:41] in mind and Jesus is sitting there and
[1:44:44] he says
[1:44:45] woman bring me a
[1:44:47] drink and this woman looks around
[1:44:52] you you you you can't be talking to
[1:44:55] me this this is not customary you can't
[1:44:58] talk to me you can't ask me for a favor
[1:45:00] you can't ask me for a
[1:45:02] drink and he says woman if you know who
[1:45:04] I was you would ask me for a drink well
[1:45:09] it took her a few minutes because she
[1:45:10] said well you ain't even got nothing to
[1:45:11] draw with
[1:45:14] Buddy and he looks at that and he's
[1:45:17] sitting down there and he begins to look
[1:45:19] and she's sitting there and they begin
[1:45:21] to convers converse with each
[1:45:23] other you would ask me for a drink if
[1:45:26] you knew who I was and how are you going
[1:45:28] to do that because the well is deep and
[1:45:29] you have nothing to draw with and he
[1:45:31] said the water that I give is the Water
[1:45:34] of
[1:45:35] Life aren't you thankful this morning
[1:45:37] that you've been to the Water of Life
[1:45:39] that you've been to the water the
[1:45:40] fountain you don't have to have a bucket
[1:45:42] to drink out of you don't have to have a
[1:45:43] fountain or a garden hose you're not
[1:45:45] going to go to the to to the
[1:45:48] desani but you've got the water of life
[1:45:50] that flows from the very Throne of God
[1:45:53] that gives you life and life
[1:45:57] Everlasting this meant so much to her
[1:45:59] she began to see that because Jesus
[1:46:01] began to speak to her and you know the
[1:46:02] story he began to speak to her said you
[1:46:05] you know you you've got five husbands
[1:46:07] and one you're with now is not your
[1:46:09] husband and she said you're a prophet
[1:46:12] for 400 years we've been waiting for the
[1:46:14] prophet you must be the
[1:46:16] Messiah and Jesus speaks to her what did
[1:46:18] what did she do what did she do she run
[1:46:21] into the City and said what come and see
[1:46:25] a man who tells
[1:46:28] me
[1:46:31] everything come and
[1:46:40] see I got time for two
[1:46:43] more Mary and
[1:46:47] Martha Mary and Martha sent word to
[1:46:50] Jesus Jesus our brother is sick we need
[1:46:53] you to come right away
[1:46:55] hurry no
[1:46:59] Jesus so he comes down and he begins to
[1:47:01] see he he finally shows up and he can
[1:47:03] see the the atmosphere and people are
[1:47:05] Weeping and people are crying so he
[1:47:06] knows what has happened it wasn't a
[1:47:09] surprise to me he knew what was going to
[1:47:12] happen because you know Jesus even at a
[1:47:14] distance he could have prevented the
[1:47:16] whole thing he didn't have to be there
[1:47:18] he got wor he could have just easily
[1:47:20] change the whole situation that's how
[1:47:23] powerful God
[1:47:24] is you don't have to necessarily be
[1:47:27] prayed for by a certain preacher you
[1:47:28] don't have to be go go pay penants you
[1:47:30] don't have to do it's just a matter of
[1:47:32] getting in contact with God and if God
[1:47:34] is ready to do that just like that he
[1:47:36] can prevent he can give he can take he's
[1:47:39] God
[1:47:41] yeah but the whole situation could have
[1:47:43] been prevented but then here Jesus comes
[1:47:45] and he sees all of this and then the
[1:47:47] shortest ver in the Bible is what Jesus
[1:47:50] J
[1:47:52] wept now you know you can read what the
[1:47:54] scholars write about Jesus weeping and
[1:47:57] how he was sorry and he felt bad and he
[1:47:59] was mourning with
[1:48:02] Mar and Mary but I kind of like the way
[1:48:05] brother Tim preaches it he said Jesus
[1:48:08] wept not because he was sad because
[1:48:11] Lazarus was gone he wept because he was
[1:48:14] sad that he had to bring Lazarus back
[1:48:17] from where he
[1:48:19] was Lazarus was on the other side
[1:48:22] Lazarus was happy Lazarus was living the
[1:48:26] life and now Jesus is thinking Mary
[1:48:29] Martha don't don't me can you just
[1:48:31] imagine don't make me do
[1:48:33] this can you imagine what Lazarus felt
[1:48:35] when he C when he was called back and he
[1:48:38] stepped back he probably thought why am
[1:48:39] I back here why did you call me
[1:48:45] back but here's Mary and Martha they go
[1:48:48] out to meet Jesus Martha does
[1:48:51] and she says if you have got here
[1:48:52] earlier Lazarus wouldn't have died and
[1:48:55] she said don't wor he said don't worry
[1:48:57] your brother will he'll rise again and
[1:48:59] she said I know I know he'll rise again
[1:49:01] I know I know everything's good there I
[1:49:02] know when God's people are
[1:49:04] resurrected and so she went to get Mary
[1:49:06] and Mary and Martha run in there and
[1:49:08] they begin to look at this and and as
[1:49:11] they're sitting there Lazarus is buried
[1:49:12] in the cave and people are gathered
[1:49:14] around it and Jesus arrives at the cave
[1:49:17] and he asks all the
[1:49:19] people roll away the
[1:49:23] stone now can you
[1:49:26] imagine how many eyes were on that
[1:49:30] event here's a man been in the grave no
[1:49:34] modern day
[1:49:35] embalming wrapped in grave
[1:49:38] clothes in probably a hot
[1:49:41] climate wrapped up been there dead for
[1:49:44] four days and Jesus says roll away the
[1:49:47] stone and Martha gas no no you how can
[1:49:50] you do that you can't do that Lazarus
[1:49:52] has been dead he's going to
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:55] stink and the people begin to push on
[1:49:58] the stone because Jesus said Martha just
[1:50:02] wait and
[1:50:04] see wait and
[1:50:07] see because if you
[1:50:10] believe you will see the glory of
[1:50:15] God thank you Lord so Jesus then the
[1:50:18] stones rolled away and Jesus begins to
[1:50:20] speak and as Jesus begins to speak and
[1:50:22] he looks down there and he says Lazareth
[1:50:24] come
[1:50:27] forth there was a showdown right there
[1:50:30] yeah can you imagine how Lazarus felt
[1:50:33] when his eyes
[1:50:34] open I'll be saying get these get these
[1:50:36] wraps off of
[1:50:39] me and that's what happened Jesus said
[1:50:42] what did he say take those grave clothes
[1:50:43] off of him take the can you imagine
[1:50:46] being the person say I don't know about
[1:50:48] this I don't know if I want do do that
[1:50:50] but Jesus said take those grave clothes
[1:50:52] off of him Lazarus come forth do you
[1:50:54] think Lazarus just kind of stood there
[1:50:56] and was like well here I
[1:50:58] am no I think he said probably said here
[1:51:01] I am what do you want Lord here I am
[1:51:03] what are we going to do he probably had
[1:51:05] a little pep in his step just like when
[1:51:07] Jesus went down there to the pool of
[1:51:09] bassetta and he's sitting there and the
[1:51:11] man's slaying on the on the cot and he
[1:51:13] says or do you want to be made
[1:51:17] well I nobody will take me to the water
[1:51:20] and Jesus says that's not what I ask you
[1:51:22] do you want to be made well do you want
[1:51:25] to be whole yes Lord but every time the
[1:51:27] waters are troubled everybody runs in
[1:51:29] front of me they knock me down and I
[1:51:31] can't get there and I can't get to the
[1:51:32] water do you want to be made
[1:51:37] whole it's not about what happens all
[1:51:40] around you it's about the relationship
[1:51:42] and watching what God can do in your
[1:51:44] life and he said yes Lord I want to be
[1:51:46] made whole he said well rise up pick up
[1:51:48] your bed and follow me rise up and
[1:51:52] walk I don't imagine he was walking I
[1:51:55] imagine he was a running I imagine he
[1:51:57] said praise the Lord I hadn't walked in
[1:51:58] 30 years I haven't done anything in 30
[1:52:01] years but praise God come and see world
[1:52:03] watch what has happened see what God has
[1:52:06] done for
[1:52:13] me I have to close
[1:52:17] here Jesus
[1:52:22] is laying in a
[1:52:25] tomb cold and chalky spear been placed
[1:52:29] in his side nails through his hands
[1:52:32] nails through his
[1:52:34] feet spit was on his beard by the
[1:52:37] mocking
[1:52:38] soldiers they tied a rag around his head
[1:52:42] and said now you Vision Seer prophesy
[1:52:45] tell us who hit
[1:52:48] you
[1:52:51] mock was still in the
[1:52:53] air as they say come down off that cross
[1:52:55] perform a
[1:52:57] miracle all
[1:52:59] eyes were on that
[1:53:02] scene All Eyes Were Watching if you're a
[1:53:04] miracle worker make us
[1:53:06] believe all eyes are on that scene and
[1:53:11] the prophet said the same devil that met
[1:53:12] him and said if thou be the Son of God
[1:53:14] perform a miracle and let me see you do
[1:53:17] it and I'll believe it that de human
[1:53:20] flesh
[1:53:21] today but it's still a
[1:53:26] devil and he says that Jesus didn't go
[1:53:29] to put on a public show he didn't go to
[1:53:32] put on a public show or make himself a
[1:53:34] clown or he didn't clown around for the
[1:53:36] people but he did what was right he did
[1:53:40] what the father showed him to
[1:53:42] do and he said but let's watch him now

[1:53:59] Jesus and he says gravitation loses its
[1:54:06] power gravitation loses its power his
[1:54:10] feet begin to come up from the earth
[1:54:13] there's light beneath his feet and he
[1:54:16] gets higher and higher and higher and
[1:54:20] gravitation lost its power just as death
[1:54:23] loses its power he was the center of
[1:54:27] gravitation he was the creator of
[1:54:28] gravitation he held gravitation at his
[1:54:31] own command and he held death at his own
[1:54:35] command when Jesus went into the cross
[1:54:39] when the blood was shed all eyes were on
[1:54:42] the
[1:54:44] calvary all eyes were on the
[1:54:46] temple and when he went down and when he
[1:54:50] come up again and the veil was rent of
[1:54:52] the temple for the whole world to see
