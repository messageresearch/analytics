[41:51] you will with me we want to go to part
[41:53] three of uh and I thought maybe this
[41:56] would be my last one and it might be but
[41:58] there may be another one more service
[42:01] that I might want to pull out of this
[42:02] but we'll see because as I was studying
[42:05] this I thought I had covered quite a few
[42:07] of them but I think there's one that I
[42:08] haven't yet but anyway we'll just pray
[42:10] about it and see what the Lord will have
[42:13] amen
[42:15] amen now uh Revelations if you will go
[42:18] to Revelations the seventh chapter
[42:20] revelation 7.
[42:34] verse 9 and after this I beheld and lo a
[42:38] great multitude which no man could
[42:40] number of all Nations and kindreds and
[42:42] people and tongues stood Before the
[42:44] Throne and before the lamb clothed with
[42:46] white robes and Palms in their hands and
[42:49] cried with a loud voice saying salvation
[42:51] to our god which setteth upon the throne
[42:54] in unto the lamb open Revelations 19 and
[42:58] I wanted to pick out that word amen
[43:00] salvation saying notice here the first
[43:03] word that it speaks of is salvation to
[43:06] our God Amen salvation to our god over
[43:09] in Revelations 19 when the Bride Comes
[43:12] Back in the first chapter I mean first
[43:14] 19th Chapter first verse
[43:16] amen it says and after these things I
[43:18] heard a great voice of much people in
[43:20] heaven saying hallelujah
[43:22] salvation amen and glory and honor and
[43:25] power unto the Lord Our God Amen may God
[43:29] add His blessings to the reading of the
[43:30] word you can be seated tonight amen
[43:34] so we see in both cases here that this
[43:36] word salvation was mentioned amen almost
[43:40] one of the first things that it was
[43:42] mentioned so amen I want to speak with
[43:44] the help of the Lord on the thought of
[43:46] Salvation amen salvation Heaven that
[43:50] pulled up in the meaning of it it says
[43:52] uh preservation and preservation or
[43:55] deliverance from harm ruin or loss amen
[44:02] ah
[44:03] and one salvation a source or a means of
[44:07] being saved from harm ruin or loss amen
[44:11] and then in the theology part it says
[44:13] the second part theology Deliverance
[44:16] Deliverance notice the word Deliverance
[44:18] amen so we can tie in Salvation to
[44:22] Deliverance amen so deliver salvation is
[44:24] Deliverance isn't it
[44:26] I mean it's being saved immense
[44:28] salvation to save you amen it's our
[44:31] Salvation something that delivers you
[44:33] from something that saves you from harm
[44:35] or in this part it says deliverance from
[44:38] sin and its consequences amen
[44:42] now that thought brought me to
[44:43] Revelations 18 I believe it was where it
[44:46] says come out of her my people that you
[44:47] partake not over sins amen that you
[44:50] receive not ever plagues because if you
[44:52] partake of our sins you'll read the
[44:54] consequences of having to deal with the
[44:55] plagues that is pronounced upon the sin
[44:57] isn't that right so that is salvation
[45:00] that we find Salvation in that and we
[45:03] know that that was part of uh the
[45:05] ministry of malachiophora Amen how many
[45:08] knows in this hour Malachi 4 was our
[45:10] salvation
[45:11] amen
[45:13] by turning Hearts back out to the
[45:14] children at least that common smart here
[45:16] for the curse people with me for that
[45:18] we'd all been cursed isn't that right so
[45:20] it was our salvation
[45:22] amen and I want to also talk for a
[45:25] little while with the help of Lord on uh
[45:27] the uh what did I call it The Spoils of
[45:30] War The Spoils of War amen but as we
[45:34] think about this uh so I think I've
[45:36] covered that it says all right uh and
[45:39] from its consequence sin and its
[45:42] consequences believed by Christian to be
[45:44] Christians to be brought about by faith
[45:46] in Christ amen and that's something how
[45:49] many knows is quite something how
[45:51] Christians are certainly coming out of
[45:53] persecution how many knows that
[45:54] Christian was just shot up the other day
[45:57] by a transgender person wasn't it
[46:00] amen and some of those people on the
[46:02] liberal side well that's what hate
[46:04] gets you because we're Christians are
[46:06] haters you know and so they kind of like
[46:08] you know you deserve it huh can you
[46:10] imagine that kind of an attitude but we
[46:12] know that that's the overall attitude

[48:04] it's over in uh Psalms I believe it was
[48:08] he was really bringing this out and he
[48:10] read it
[48:11] amen I believe it was and I thought wow
[48:15] that's just wonderful I'll take that
[48:17] thought amen and that scripture on on
[48:20] what he said in verse 8 of Psalms 3.
[48:25] Psalm 3 and verse 8 says salvation
[48:30] belongeth unto the Lord amen
[48:34] I notice here in Revelation he says if
[48:36] salvation be unto our Lord God is the
[48:39] only one notice here he says it belongs
[48:42] to him he's the only one that can say
[48:46] I didn't have time I just got got in my
[48:48] mind just a couple minutes before
[48:50] service come over and revelate not
[48:51] Revelation but Isaiah we're different it
[48:54] wasn't say Isaiah I don't
[48:56] I think it was yeah it was Isaiah
[48:57] somewhere it was just I am the Lord I am
[49:00] your savior besides me there is none
[49:03] how many knows he is the only savior
[49:05] there is
[49:07] praise be to God he's the only one that
[49:10] can save anybody amen that can bring
[49:12] Salvation to anybody and David knew
[49:14] understood one person we want to talk
[49:16] about first and that's David David
[49:17] understood that salvation was God's that
[49:22] was up to God to say it's his business
[49:26] amen he knew what I like how he knew it
[49:29] he never glorified himself he never
[49:31] talked about his own saving him his own
[49:34] hide with the bear or the lion what'd he
[49:37] say the god that delivered the bearing
[49:38] in my hand delivered the lion into my
[49:40] hand he'll deliver that guy in the mind
[49:42] he'll do it
[49:43] David always gave God the credit
[49:47] amen that's what we got to do that's
[49:49] what we do I believe that's what the
[49:50] bride us that's what we say when we come
[49:53] back from the heavens of Heavens all
[49:54] together
[49:56] amen
[49:58] I love to talk about the future
[50:02] amen I love to talk about the present
[50:04] but I also like to talk about it well
[50:06] I'll tell you if you're unbeliever but
[50:08] they better bam say it's the most
[50:10] horriblest time that you can imagine for
[50:13] the unbeliever that lays ahead
[50:15] but for the believer it's the most
[50:17] glorious time
[50:18] lays right here in front because the
[50:21] scriptures that we read we know is going
[50:23] to come to pass
[50:26] in other words that day is coming
[50:29] why are you laughing brother because I
[50:32] am seeing myself and believing that I am
[50:35] in that multitude
[50:38] do you believe that you're in that
[50:40] multitude saying
[50:43] Hallelujah
[50:45] salvation
[50:48] to the Lord
[50:52] amen is worthy to be praised you know
[50:55] that's one other word we should take and
[50:57] speak on sometime is the praise God is
[50:59] worthy of
[51:00] amen praise him praise him praise Him
[51:02] David said praise him on the instrument
[51:04] praise him praise him praise him he's
[51:06] worthy of Praise everybody else gets all
[51:08] this praise but let me tell you in this
[51:10] house he gets praised
[51:17] of praise
[51:19] why because
[51:21] what you do this uh somebody that's
[51:23] worthy of Praise You don't give people
[51:25] praise that aren't worthy of praise
[51:27] you've heard of P that's praiseworthy
[51:30] well he's praiseworthy amen
[51:33] we know he is praiseworthy and so that's
[51:36] why we praise him oh we praise him in
[51:39] the morning praise him in the noon tide
[51:42] praise him till the sun goes down Praise
[51:46] Him Praise Him amen
[51:49] praise him praise and praise Him
[51:51] praising praising Praise Him praising
[51:53] praise I could just do it for about a
[51:55] thousand years can you just let's take
[51:57] about an hour just praising praise him
[51:58] praise him that's what the hell they're
[52:00] doing praising all the holy holy holy
[52:02] singing all the time
[52:03] amen the only reason we have to quit is
[52:06] because we get tired or I've always
[52:08] gives out
[52:11] and then this time element is a horrible
[52:14] thing brother John I don't like this
[52:16] time element amen
[52:19] when you get the eternity remember what
[52:22] he said if you were just there
[52:24] you had just arrived it's just you're
[52:26] there
[52:27] it's no future no past you're there
[52:30] amen and in praise God it's like the
[52:32] best moment in your whole life locked in
[52:36] because I'll tell you
[52:39] no matter how much fun you are know what
[52:42] moment no matter what your best moment
[52:43] is it comes and it goes
[52:46] you know it really doesn't mean a whole
[52:49] lot you enjoy the time but it doesn't
[52:50] last
[52:51] when we get over there it's gonna last
[52:54] David knew that God was Worthy
[52:58] and
[53:00] I mean and that's another
[53:03] one in the Bible
[53:05] another example
[53:07] of how that the Lord
[53:10] that how that salvation Belongs to the
[53:13] Lord
[53:14] and it was found way back in second
[53:17] Chronicles when uh
[53:21] Jehoshaphat I believe joined up with
[53:25] um
[53:27] my goodness
[53:29] see it was uh Jay-Z Balin Ahab thank you
[53:33] Ahab he joined up with Ahab going and
[53:35] trying to get and take this land that
[53:38] they thought belonged to him remember
[53:39] and they called all these prophets up
[53:41] you know and as a prophet of God put it
[53:43] and as the Bible put it you know they
[53:46] had the scripture had be to be fulfilled
[53:48] where Ahab would be killed and Jezebel
[53:50] would be eaten by dogs and all this and
[53:52] uh you know up in heaven they were
[53:55] saying who's going to go down for us and
[53:56] make this happen and this one said
[53:59] something and that one said something
[54:00] finally it says a lying Spirit came up
[54:03] and says I know how I'll do it he says
[54:05] I'll get into all of them prophets and
[54:07] I'll cause them but to prophesy a lie
[54:09] that's how we'll get it done and God
[54:10] said go ahead and do it
[54:14] he sended lie aloud a slying spirit to
[54:16] get into those 500 prophets of Baal and
[54:19] so forth and they all prophesied and
[54:20] said go up it belongs to you go up go up
[54:24] and they joined up with Ahab jahaz the
[54:27] fact the king of Judah and uh Ahab the
[54:29] king of Israel and so forth you know and
[54:32] they got together that's going together
[54:33] and so forth and but I'm talked about
[54:35] how that you shouldn't join up with
[54:36] somebody like that unless you really
[54:38] want to get in trouble
[54:39] amen and Jehoshaphat just Escape because
[54:43] God spared him from that army war if
[54:45] you'll go back and look
[54:46] amen
[54:48] I believe it was uh out there were
[54:50] coming after to has about and they
[54:51] stopped and they realized that wasn't
[54:53] the king they were after and then they
[54:54] went after it happens he had disguised
[54:56] himself and they finally got him
[54:59] amen but after that battle and they all
[55:02] went home Jehoshaphat went back home and
[55:04] the children of Emin and the children of
[55:06] Moab I believe came up after the
[55:09] children of Judah and against
[55:10] Jehoshaphat and so forth and uh they
[55:13] came up against him we'll start with
[55:16] verse 10 of chapter second chronicles
[55:19] second chronicles 10 if you want to
[55:21] follow me and we'll get this story here
[55:23] amen and try to get started
[55:26] amen second chronicles 20 and verse
[55:30] uh let's go with
[55:32] 10.
[55:34] and now behold the children of Ammon and
[55:36] Moab and mount Seer whom thou wouldest
[55:39] not let Israel invade
[55:42] I guess way back when they were
[55:43] traveling through their land remember
[55:45] amen and they would not let him pass by
[55:48] you remember that and then God wouldn't
[55:50] let him touch him just go around and so
[55:51] forth you know but not you know we
[55:53] didn't do many evil because of it but
[55:55] now he says when they come out of the
[55:57] land of Egypt but they turn from them
[55:59] and destroyed them not behold I say how
[56:02] they reward us to come to cast us out of
[56:05] our possession which thou has given us
[56:07] to inherit Oh Our God will thou not
[56:10] judge them for we are not might we have
[56:14] no might against this great company that
[56:16] cometh against us neither know we what
[56:18] to do but our eyes are upon thee boys
[56:22] that ever a good example when you come
[56:25] against something that you don't know
[56:26] what to do with brothers and sisters get
[56:28] your eyes on Christ amen you don't have
[56:31] the might you don't have the power but
[56:33] God does so get your eyes on him amen
[56:37] and all Judah stood before the Lord with
[56:40] their little ones their wives and their
[56:42] little children he says then upon now
[56:44] forgive me something for some of the
[56:46] names that I can't pronounce then upon
[56:48] jeh Israel
[56:50] uh the son of Zechariah the son of
[56:53] banaya and then I'm gonna jump down to
[56:55] the ending of that verse came the spirit
[56:57] of the Lord in the midst of the
[56:59] congregation and he said hearken he all
[57:01] Judah and ye inhabit them to Jerusalem
[57:04] and Thou King of King Jehoshaphat the
[57:07] saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid
[57:10] nor dismayed by reason of his great
[57:12] multitude for the battle is not yours

[57:19] how many believe that salvation is the
[57:22] Lord the Bible is Gods it's not yours

[57:31] are gonna lose

[1:05:38] praise the beauty of Holiness as they
[1:05:42] went out before the Army and to say
[1:05:45] praise the Lord
[1:05:47] hallelujah praise you that's what they
[1:05:50] went out and praised did they sang
[1:05:52] Praise You Lord For His mercy endureth
[1:05:55] forever
[1:05:57] and when they begin to sing into praise
[1:05:59] amen then God said
[1:06:03] ambushments against the children of
[1:06:05] Yemen
[1:06:06] and he goes to saying how the cheese
[1:06:08] chick be still different ones they
[1:06:10] fought against the other ones amen and
[1:06:12] they killed each other now notice in
[1:06:13] verse 25
[1:06:15] and when Jehoshaphat and his people came
[1:06:17] to take away the spoil of them let me go
[1:06:21] back up one let's let's watch him fall
[1:06:22] first and when Judah came towards the
[1:06:25] tower the Watchtower in the wilderness
[1:06:27] they look unto the multitude and behold
[1:06:31] they were dead bodies Fallen to the
[1:06:34] ground and none escaped
[1:06:38] I mean those God turns their own sword
[1:06:40] against each other
[1:06:45] salvation is the Lord's and when
[1:06:47] Jehoshaphat and his people came to take
[1:06:49] away the spoil of them listen
[1:06:51] you talk about taking the dead people's
[1:06:53] stuff
[1:06:55] these people believed in taking the dead
[1:06:57] folks stuff
[1:06:59] all right that's a nice pair of shoes
[1:07:01] let me have them
[1:07:05] they found among them in abundance both
[1:07:09] riches with the dead bodies and precious
[1:07:12] jewels and they stripped off for
[1:07:15] themselves more than they could carry
[1:07:19] away listen to this and they were three
[1:07:22] days in gathering of spoil
[1:07:25] it was so much
[1:07:28] [Laughter]
[1:07:31] Hallelujah can you imagine
[1:07:33] the battle was alarmed they give it to
[1:07:36] God first of all what did they do to
[1:07:37] help themselves they called on God
[1:07:41] they said we aren't able to do it but
[1:07:43] God you're more than able to do it folks
[1:07:46] when you give God or your situation you
[1:07:49] trust him and you see him do it there's
[1:07:51] a reward that comes with God fighting
[1:07:55] your battles
[1:07:57] to every victor goes what
[1:08:02] say it louder
[1:08:06] this spoil right
[1:08:09] amen now we got to a point think about
[1:08:12] Jehoshaphat think about
[1:08:14] um
[1:08:15] Samson is that right when he killed that
[1:08:17] lion he came back a day later and he was
[1:08:19] full of honey Isn't that right he went
[1:08:21] into that line and ate all of that honey
[1:08:23] had him a good time what a reward
[1:08:25] victory victory was sweet how many beats
[1:08:29] Victory is sweet
[1:08:32] they had all this spoiled now how many
[1:08:35] knows that when Jesus Christ come oh my
[1:08:39] should we jump over in the New Testament
[1:08:40] right quick
[1:08:41] let's jump over to the New Testament
[1:08:43] right quick
[1:08:47] amen
[1:08:51] we'll leave Jehoshaphat there now
[1:08:52] enjoying himself with the spoil isn't
[1:08:55] that right and praising God for his
[1:08:57] goodness
[1:08:58] now over in Acts 4 if you want to go
[1:09:00] let's go for over into acts four and
[1:09:02] we're going to look at the Salvation in
[1:09:04] the New Testament part with the help of
[1:09:06] the Lord for a few minutes
[1:09:08] uh
[1:09:14] first of all can you imagine if there
[1:09:15] was about four ways five ways
[1:09:19] people think that it's about a hundred
[1:09:21] ways to get to heaven maybe thousands of
[1:09:23] ways to get to heaven
[1:09:25] wouldn't that be confusing
[1:09:28] now how many knows when he said come out
[1:09:30] of her which was Babylon right come out
[1:09:32] of her come out of Babylon which Babylon
[1:09:35] from what I understand means confusion
[1:09:38] come out of confusion
[1:09:40] I like when it's not a bunch of
[1:09:43] different salvations not a bunch of
[1:09:45] different ways to heaven but one I am
[1:09:48] the way the truth in the life no man
[1:09:50] comes unto the father but by
[1:09:53] he didn't even say us he said me
[1:09:55] is that right one there's one way
[1:09:59] Amen in that way I believe it was Peter
[1:10:01] and them
[1:10:02] after they uh had raised the impotent
[1:10:05] man from up if I'm not wrong
[1:10:08] but anyway there were any question about
[1:10:11] this
[1:10:12] in chapter 4 verse 9. if we this day be
[1:10:16] examined of the good deed done to the
[1:10:18] impotent Man by what means he was made
[1:10:21] whole be it known unto you all and to
[1:10:24] all the people of Israel that in the
[1:10:26] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom ye
[1:10:30] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[1:10:32] even by even by him does this man stand
[1:10:36] here before you hope
[1:10:39] well I like his preaching don't you this
[1:10:42] is just
[1:10:51] it's just the other
[1:10:53] Buddha Muhammad
[1:10:55] it doesn't matter what religion
[1:10:58] there is out there there's only one
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:02] that's Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] amen how many knows there's not any
[1:11:07] salvation in any church
[1:11:09] Baptist Methodist Presbyterians Amish
[1:11:12] Mennonite evening La Tabernacle I don't
[1:11:15] care what it is
[1:11:16] there's no salvation in a church
[1:11:19] there's only salvation in one place
[1:11:21] where he chose to put his name and that
[1:11:23] is the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:25] it's not father son of the Holy Ghost he
[1:11:27] says use the name go and baptize in the
[1:11:30] name of the fathers on the Holy Ghost
[1:11:31] not the titles of Father's son he said
[1:11:33] give me the name
[1:11:34] because there's no other name given
[1:11:36] under heaven whereby you must be saved
[1:11:38] not two names
[1:11:40] not either that way or this but no one
[1:11:42] name
[1:11:43] amen there's only salvation in one name
[1:11:46] for there is none other name unto Heaven
[1:11:48] given among men whereby you must be
[1:11:52] saved Glory
[1:11:55] Hallelujah
[1:11:58] so let's look at Christ how many knows
[1:12:00] he is our savior oh I'm a savior Oh What

[1:12:31] way to Calvary until he finally gave his
[1:12:34] life on Calvary shed his blood and we
[1:12:36] know that there's oh my I love him I
[1:12:40] love him because he first loved me and
[1:12:43] purchased my salvation on

[1:23:12] it doesn't strengthens but it makes you
[1:23:15] weaker

[1:23:20] and the only pleasure if you'll notice
[1:23:23] the only pleasure people have in serving
[1:23:25] the devil is drugs alcohol and physical
[1:23:28] feeling

[1:24:25] to help them out doing their drugs and
[1:24:26] stuff
[1:24:27] the only thing that they have is trying
[1:24:30] to get some kind of a physical pleasure
[1:24:32] why because they have no spiritual
[1:24:34] pleasure
[1:24:35] they have no joy in their soul at all
[1:24:38] anybody that's away from God has no joy
[1:24:41] in their soul
[1:24:43] are in their spirit
[1:24:45] it's a torment
[1:24:47] the kind of Torment that'll cause a kid
[1:24:50] to do what he did
[1:24:51] tormented so horrible that they want
[1:24:55] everybody else to be as dead as they
[1:24:57] feel
[1:25:00] there's your problem people you wonder
[1:25:01] what they know the problem is there's a
[1:25:03] problem people who feel dead hate people
[1:25:06] have no Jew I have no I have nothing to
[1:25:08] live for and just want to hurt other
[1:25:10] people because they're so miserable
[1:25:12] yourself
[1:25:15] by the Christian Spirit it encourages it
[1:25:18] strengthens
[1:25:20] isn't that wonderful
[1:25:22] what God gives you what salvation
[1:25:25] brought to you
[1:25:27] amen let me finish with the final
[1:25:30] salvation what I call Defiance out final
[1:25:32] salvation
[1:25:34] the final salvation of course we know
[1:25:37] that we've been bought we've been
[1:25:38] purchased he purchased our Salvation
[1:25:41] right we've already been bought we were
[1:25:43] ready Christ but we're still in this
[1:25:45] body
[1:25:46] we are still waiting for him to come and
[1:25:49] claim his purchased possession
[1:25:53] he's not coming to uh claim something
[1:25:55] that he hasn't purchased or that isn't
[1:25:58] his possession how many believes you
[1:26:00] have to be his possession and you have
[1:26:02] to be bought by him if he's going to
[1:26:03] come and take you away
[1:26:05] but the rap shot at the rapture
[1:26:07] he's going to come and claim hit that
[1:26:10] possession
[1:26:11] we're going to read one more scripture
[1:26:12] over in Revelations
[1:26:17] 12.
[1:26:21] Revelations 12.
[1:26:35] verse 7.
[1:26:37] and there was war in heaven
[1:26:41] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:26:44] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[1:26:48] angels and prevailed neither was their
[1:26:51] place found anymore in heaven now who
[1:26:55] knows that the devil according to
[1:26:56] prophet of God is up there and he is
[1:26:58] accusing us before God
[1:27:01] as long as he's on that Mercy Seat he's
[1:27:03] there accusing us

[1:27:16] whole world he was cast out into the
[1:27:20] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[1:27:23] him

[1:27:28] heaven now is calm salvation
[1:27:36] ha
[1:27:36] [Applause]
[1:27:39] and strength
[1:27:41] oh my I mean those were just a weakling
[1:27:43] like a sheep and so forth and Christ is
[1:27:46] mistreated and everything else and you
[1:27:48] know even Christ he's not coming he's
[1:27:50] not in the in his glory right now
[1:27:53] no but he'll come in his glory
[1:27:55] and he'll come with him in his glory
[1:27:57] amen but here it says now it's come
[1:27:59] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:28:03] of our God and the power of His Christ
[1:28:07] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[1:28:12] down
[1:28:13] whoa I'm too glad for that one of these
[1:28:17] days you'll never
[1:28:19] he'll never be able to come into your
[1:28:21] mind again and try to accuse you
[1:28:24] how many have ever had him try to do
[1:28:25] that I remember what you did
[1:28:28] I remember what you did
[1:28:31] oh yeah I think there's just about
[1:28:34] hardly anybody in here probably that
[1:28:36] hasn't had
[1:28:38] bad in their pasts
[1:28:41] we've all had bad in our past we've done
[1:28:45] bad things as Christians in our past
[1:28:49] your pastor has
[1:28:51] sure I've done things I regret doing
[1:28:55] I've had as far as I know I've made them
[1:28:57] right you know and so forth I hope
[1:28:58] everybody has you want to make sure
[1:29:00] everything's right
[1:29:01] but you still think about them
[1:29:03] the devil still brings it up into your
[1:29:05] mind and you have to remind him that hey
[1:29:08] you know this is under the blood
[1:29:10] I remember it and you remember it but
[1:29:13] God don't remember it and let me remind
[1:29:15] you of your future since you're
[1:29:16] reminding me of my past

[1:29:23] before our God day and night
[1:29:28] folks I am very strong at being careful

[1:29:39] do that but just be careful in it make
[1:29:42] sure that your accusations and don't go
[1:29:44] by hearsay and rumors and everything
[1:29:45] else because a lot of times that's
[1:29:46] nothing but a
[1:29:48] slop of the devil going around
[1:29:52] and that's what the devil loves he loves
[1:29:54] to accuse people oh you did this and you
[1:29:56] did that and you this they said that and
[1:29:57] the other maybe they did but what about
