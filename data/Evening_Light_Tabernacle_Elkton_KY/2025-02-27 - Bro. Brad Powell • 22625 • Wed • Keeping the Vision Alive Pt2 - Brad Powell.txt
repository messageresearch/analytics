cups to make us overflowing with the goodness of God so if you would let's just turn in our Bibles we we have a lot on the plate tonight but I think we can get out at a decent hour and we wanted to just go ahead and continue the thought of where we were at the other day and and we'll just would title this if we would keeping the vision alive part two and turn in your Bibles uh first Peter uh chapter 4 we'll start there how many's having a good week say amen that's good to hear if you're having a bad week say oh me that's good to hear too no responses first Peter 4:12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you think it not strange think about that think it not strange concerning the fiery trial for which is to try you as though some strange things happened to you so it's saying why we don't look at look at our trials and say why why why is this strange thing happening to me but rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy if ye be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glor of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified so they can speak all the evil they want against you and and the way you live and the way you look and the way you act but all glor GL is still given to God when they speak the evil they're giving glory to God the devil can't win it's about time he understands that but let none of you suffer as a murderer as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busy body in other men's matters I like that one because you know that's one thing that a lot of people try to do is is uh they want to be busy bodies in other people's business yeah yeah that's it's not for me to tell somebody else how to live right or to try to oversee the way they act or the way they do that's that's between them and God yet if any man suffer as a Christian how many Christians do we have here that's talking to you if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on his behalf so no matter if you're if you're suffering today no matter what trial you're going through you have no reason to be ashamed When Trials come there's no reason to be ashamed there's no reason to be critical of other people's trials because that's one thing we see a lot of times people do oh he must be really into something because look at all he's going through he must be living some way he shouldn't be living he must be doing things he shouldn't be doing or he wouldn't be going through the kinds of things he's going through he wouldn't be going through the hardships and the challenges his kids wouldn't be doing these things if they wasn't living the way they should or shouldn't live come on come on but if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed I'm not ashamed God every I tell you we've been talking and we've been going on this and brother B's been saying this minut a visiting ministers I'm not ashamed of the things I've had to go through because the things I've had to go through is what's made me who I am the things you go through is what makes you who you are the things that Joseph went through are the things that made him what he was in God's Vision keep the vision no M no matter where you're at Genesis chapter 39 we're going to pick up here where we where we left off forgive me if I cough some tonight we've we had that cro last last week congestion and infection and we're trying to get over it okay we are over it and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and potterer an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard of the an Egyptian bought him out of the hands of the Israelites remember that now which he which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph isn't it amazing thing that when Joseph just got out of the pit been sold into slavery into into a life of bondage it wasn't because he done anything wrong it wasn't because he was a secret sinner it wasn't because he was doing any of those things that anybody shouldn't have been doing but God was still with him and he was prosperous you mean in all your adversities and all your hardships when you're down in the dumps when the when the world is dark and dreary and gloomy and and it looks like there's no way out and you have no hope you're still prosperous and God is still with you how many can say amen and his master saw that the Lord was with him you mean an Egyptian potier had enough wisdom that he could see with his eyes he had a vision look at who this man is Piper looked at this and said man I don't know who what what kind of God he serves because I certainly don't serve him but whoever he serves is with him and he makes everything he does prosper that's my God and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and made him overseer so now Joseph is the Man In Charge he's the man of the hour he he made him the over Seer over his house and over all that he had he put into his hands and it came to pass from that time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake so you mean all the struggles all the hardships all the when things look so grim and dark and and God was still working things out for Joseph's sake through the house of an Egyptian are you with me think about this and he left all that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew uh knew not ought that he had and saved bread which he did eat and Joseph was goodly person and well favored and it came to pass after these things that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just come before you tonight with grateful Hearts thankful Lord for healthy bodies to be able to come into the house tonight and draw strength from you draw strength from your word and draw strength from your wisdom father lead us and guide us tonight help me to allow myself out of the way that you could just speak freely to us tonight that you would just anoint our ears to hear what you would have for us encourage us father Lift us up and lead us and guide us as we want to serve you in a greater way in the days to come in Jesus name amen you can have your seats tonight so I want you to not noce and in reading our text tonight that Joseph remember now he was a young man about the age of 17 and we know that Joseph was a young man of vision we know that the Lord had had used Joseph and he had looked at Joseph and he was very favorable upon Joseph and revealing to Joseph of what would happen in his life he was very favorable and and telling him what his gifts were he showed him what his purpose was going to be and but for some strange turn of events in the in and down the road we see that he would find that his own family his own Brothers despised by 10 of his own Brothers doubted by his own father that that someday they would find themselves paying homage to Joseph someday they would find themselves through the circumstances of life to be bowing down at the very feet of Joseph and even though he had been mocked by his family think about this he'd been abused by his brothers he'd been left for dead in the very bowels of the earth and he was sold into slavery and bondage brothers and sisters Joseph did not allow circumstances of life he did not allow the circumstances of life to determine the outcome of his vision you see he knew that God had given him that that Vision he knew that someday no matter what down the road his brothers would bow down at his feet circumstances will come in your life circumstances will go in your life and then circumstances will come again in your life don't let the circumstances out out Shadow the outcome of the vision so when your life seems to be overtaken by despair it's important that we realize and we know that God is still in control when there's troubles and trials and there's there's there's disarray that God is still the comforter it's it's it's nice to know when you're laying there sick and you're on your back and you're laying there sick and you're wondering some of you's been there and you're wondering God how can I ever get over this am I ever going to get well will I ever quit coughing will I ever get a good night's sleep will I ever get out of this pain it's good to know that in those times that God is still the great physician and that God still heals all the diseases of your body all of the diseases listen to what Psalms 103 says praise the Lord my soul and forget not all of his benefits all forget not all of his benefits brothers and sisters there's benefits related to Calvary the benefits of Calvary are Redemption the benefits of Calvary are hope hope their Deliverance their love it's healing it's Deliverance Listen to It's access to God I'm thankful that I've got a God that I can have access to 247 365 days a year if I have a need I just fall on my knees and I cry out God I need you in this hour and he's there to deliver in the hour of need the benefits of Calvary tells us that we can have victory over sin you don't have to be ruled by the sin that that lingers around your life you don't have to succumb to the sins around your life the benefits of Calvary tells me I can have victory over Satan that I have a right to push back as brother Bor said on Sunday when Satan comes and puts his fo weight against me I push back that is the benefits of the victory of Calvary the benefits of Calvary tells me I have victory over death There Is No Death as I've said in a Believer so I have victory tonight over the death that's the benefits of Calvary and Psalms 103 praise ye the Lord of my soul forget not all of his benefits who heals all your diseases so brothers and sisters we have a great benefactor in Jesus Christ today and I got to looking at this and I I've looked at this wrong for so long and then I I finally got to breaking it down and I thought the benefactor the benefactor is the one who creates the estate plan oh come on the benefactor Jesus Christ he's the one that said if I go to Calvary my estate says that you can be the beneficiary of all of these benefits that was placed on the cross of Calvary I'm the benefactor I'm going to give it to you he said everything that I have I'm going to give it to you so Jesus as the benefactor gives us all these blessings Jesus gives you as a benefactor he gives you overcoming power Jesus as a benefactor he gives you the healing in your body he gives you the the the the Forgiveness of of of your enemies that's important brothers and sisters you have to be able to forgive your enemies you'll see here in the life of Joseph he had to forgive enemy after enemy after enemy why is it so important because if you hold on to that if you hold on to those grudges if if you hold on to those those things that have set you back from other people you'll never go nowhere they'll keep going on with life and you'll sit there in the muddle and the mire and in your distress and in your mully grub just wondering how can they get by with doing this thank you brother Steve it will eat you up up it'll tear your heart out it'll ruin your walk with the Lord it'll ruin your walk with within your family that's why forgiveness is so important and Jesus tells us we are the named beneficiaries and as the beneficiaries brothers and sisters we have a right to obtain all that Jesus has envisioned for us to have you know when you go get an insurance policy my wife has a little insurance policy on me and I'm one on her if one of us die surely we can get in the ground but if I die it says that she is the beneficiary of that policy it doesn't say Weston no it doesn't say Carson joce pal is the beneficiary upon the death of me none of you can be my Ben can be the beneficiary of my policy we are the beneficiaries of the benefits of Calvary in other words we are the recipients we're the ones that get the the benefits from the planed EST state that God had in the very beginning it was you that was on his mind when he was on the cross it was your sickness it was your distress it was the things that you would go through from point A to point B in that section we call life that he said because he is my child he's my son or he's my daughter he's now my beneficiary upon on my death he receives all that I have written for him and you know what the good thing is about the beneficiary once it's given given to the person who's the recipient there's nothing that a court nothing that any lawyer nothing any judge can do to take that away because you know why the debt has been paid the debt has been paid so what are we waiting for tonight it's time that we cash in on our benefits what good does it do you to have a policy like this and you never cash it in she can have she can have 15 Life policies on me and if I die and if she never takes it to an attorney and says hey how do I cash these in she'll never get a dime they can sit there Idol they can set in a safe box in a kitchen drawer wherever you want to put your items but there would never be a dividend paid to her as long as she doesn't accept what the what the writing of the document says the prophet says it this way he said God fora God had a vision God fora he said God had a vision he says God forsaw the bride and the groom he said he fora the bride and the groom Hallelujah to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her Adam knew what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife he said listen now and Jesus took his wife he took his wife's Place Jesus took his wife's place and he became sin for her so let me ask you are you in the vision tonight you have to see yourself in that Vision tonight he took his wife's place and he became remember he says he became you he stood your punishment you mean it was my punishment it was your punishment it was the Wicked Deeds you done it was the bad that you done the the the the the inappropriate thoughts that you had in your mind it was the evil thoughts that you walked upon day after day as a sinner it was your drinking it was your carousing it was your drugging yeah he stood your punishment he said and that you might stand in his place he said he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what love what a fellowship what a love and what a fellowship that Jesus has brothers and sisters Joseph wasn't alone in that pit and you'll never be alone in your pit Joseph was in that pit but he wasn't alone in the pit when it seemed like he was in the deepest darkest day of his life God was standing there with him can you imagine the emptiness in the pit of his stomach when he got cast into that prison had done nothing wrong an innocent man sentenced to prison and now he is cast down in this prison can you imagine the hollow in the pit of his stomach but he never stood alone God don't let his children stand alone and we don't stand alone in this hour and no matter what comes our way God is standing right there through the Holy Ghost and it's through the power of the Holy Ghost that we find our overcoming power he says the Holy Ghost in This last day as promised is like the abstract title deeden wow now listen to this this is important we're just going to teach a little bit and preach a little bit and we'll go as long as we can go and but this this this this is this is good stuff somebody told me one time said you you shouldn't say that's good stuff well it's good stuff I don't know any other way to put it brother Bor when I dig into the word of God and I begin to see myself in the book and I begin to see the promises that's good the the Bible says when God made this on the first day it was good and on the second day it was good this gets gets more I read it the gooder it gets I don't know any other way to put it but this abstract title a deed it's a summary of a property of legal history it's including all the Deeds the mortgages and the documents that affect the title now we got Realtors here we got Bankers sitting here we got people that bought property here you know what I'm talking about he says and and it's important to know that this deed this abstract title deed it's a key document in any real estate transaction and the prophet says now you can get a title you can get a title I got a title he says you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours so that goes right back to what we've been talking about that profession without a possession you know there's a lot of Christians out there that profess professing Christianity but they possess no powers to back it up they profess going to a message church but there is no power to back up there is no evidence there is no fruit to back up where they stand so what it is that they have a title I'm a message believer churchgoing Bible tote and Christian have you ever opened it have you ever dug into it because the the way you're living sure don't line up with what I've been reading I don't know what version you listening to or you looking at Li the liberal life version I guess I don't know but he says you can have that title but you still don't he can't say it's yours but somebody way back Yonder could have come and put a claim on it now you see are you with me now the devil tries to put his claim on you you see this is not just any old title this is not just any old deed this is an abstract title there's a difference this is a title this right here has been proven this right here says my debts have been paid on this property this says nobody can hold claims to anything that God has given me in this book so it tells me that I'm one of God's children so this right here it tells me that no matter what it what it is in my life that I had to overcome it's been forgiven you see that's what the devil does he tries to put those claims on you he tries to tell you you you know you're too Wicked to be a child of God you're too depressed to ever be happy you're too sad to ever have joy these are claims he's putting on you he's trying to say I'm going to take this piece of their property well you know you're the doctor said you're way too sick to be healed that's nothing but a false claim you say a false claim yeah that's what I'm talking about a false claim he can claim all he wants but the the mortgage company the title company from heaven above has said that there is an abstract deed that the debts been paid the price has been paid the blood still wet on Calvary and we have forgiveness we have healing we have have Deliverance my deed reads Isaiah 53 it says who ha believed this report who hath believed this report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed that's me I believe this report it says he was despised and rejected of me and a Man of Sorrows acquainted of grief for me my deed says that he bore my griefs he carried my sorrow my deed says that he was wounded for my transgressions and the devil can claim all he wants to that it wasn't for me but my book says the property is mine so I've got to write in this hour I've got a right with what God has done in my life to post a sign on there to say devil this property is free and clear it's been given to me it's now posted no trespassing don't make no more claims on me devil don't make no more claims on my family devil don't make no more claims on the things that that that you want me to believe because I don't believe it you see brothers and sisters when you get abstract everything he said it shows that everything that was ever against it listen now has been struck off come on everything that you ever done every Wicked thought every Wicked thing you ever said in your mind and in and that you looked at or you thought has been struck off the Record in other words it don't exist you know when they was going to release I don't know if they ever did those JFK files and MLK files and all that all that stuff is is all going to be blacked out you a going to read it anyway it don't matter what they turned loose it was all going to be blacked out and you you're not going to know what it said that's the way my god did my faults my failures my weaknesses he didn't do that take that big fat Sharpie marker and just start wiping that out he didn't do that he says and and and this man that believes the word and then the Holy Spirit comes it's an abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and every bit of that it belongs to you he said and it gives you the abstract when the Holy Ghost comes upon this tital deed that God saw back Yonder when before the foundation of the world so before you ever done it he said you never done it I received the deed he said but when the Holy Ghost come it was abstract he said in an abstract that everything against me listen now a lot of times we we we Harbor on our on our family tree oh my family my my my my mom and my daddy he done this and and boy I I'm suffering this but no he says whether it's my mother done it whether my father done it whether my grand mother done it you a my my little L grandmother made some mistakes that could it didn't affect me no scratched you say what about sicknesses what about illnesses what about hereditarily child I prayed for a few minutes ago he come through that epilep epilepsy come through his grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon this child I said but when the abstract has [Applause] come when the abstract has come he said it struck off and omitted everything he's the abstract holder and is sure the spirit raised Christ from the dead I have an abstract deed that I'm part of the body with the abstract of the Holy Ghost that in that body word lived out just exactly like it like it did in him like he promised in the last day this D says you live like Christ all my sins are struck out I'm just telling you what he said oh my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come as a abstract to the title deed that God has given me by grace and for knowledge you know I sleep well at night knowing without a doubt that I'm one of his I don't have to wake up in the morning and wonder I wonder if I'm a Child of God today I sleep well at night knowing that day after day after day there's been a price paid for me that I can walk just as he walked by his grace and through his mercy so the prophet says so what are you scared about you know that's a that's one thing a Christian should never be is scared what are we scared about but you see so many people that are scared they're scared of this this sickness that sickness and me and somebody was talking the other day you know it's easy to it's easy to have faith when it ain't you the sick right let's just be honest but when it comes knocking on your door things change I don't wish sickness on anybody but sickness causes desperation sometimes sickness causes you to examine things in a little bit of different light what are you scared about no wonder he said fear not I am he that was dead and alive again I'm alive forever more and I had the keys of death and Hell listen to what his next statement is don't worry about nothing don't worry about nothing even death ain't going to hurt you he said see notice it's beautiful don't worry about nothing the abstract title and we're good we're getting on I promise we're moving the abstract title the Deb is settled everything against it has been struck off haa he said Glory he said I may act a little silly but I feel good there's a reason we may act a little silly because we feel good because the word of God says all the promises are yours he says do you realize what that means there is none nothing that can take it away from you say it I am the holder I you hold the title deed in your hand for every promise you have need of when we begin to realize that and we begin to believe it and we begin to see oursel in the vision of that we become that Invincible Army that he talked about have you noticed how things have changed over the last few years around the word of God around message it's a power of overcoming it's a power of authority through the word of Jesus Christ it's not people no more just just wandering or just dilly-dallying and dabbling around the word it's people that are standing on the word that are living the word I told somebody the other day I said you know the difference I can see in our church the difference that I can see in our church is we're not just looking for the coming we're living the coming there's a life that's being lived in the Believers in this hour that's saying come Lord come and what's they talking about come into me come into my life come into me and fill me with your Holy Ghost so that I can be the what everything you want me to be that's all Joseph wanted all Joseph wanted was to be what God wanted him to be we look at his life we see that Piper has elevated him to a to a place of authority he put him into a place of power and I want you to notice that the vision is taking place right before his very eyes but watch how the Devil comes right back into the scene you know that's the way life is it's like a big stage sometimes you're in the in the Forefront Life's good and everything's Grand enter devil stage left and he comes creeping in and we see here it is it it came out after these things after he's been elevated after after he's been blessed after he's blessed others through his ministry I want you to notice that after he was delivered out of the pit after he was given Freedom after he's been successful after he's been prosperous that's when we think we've arrived right oh I made it be careful that his master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said lie with me here comes that old devil trying to make claims oh you know Joseph you know you're interested in her look at how beautiful she is you don't believe that's what he done read what it says verse 10 and it came to pass after she spake to Joseph day by day so over and over and over and over the tempter came if you're not being tempted if you're not being chased if you're not being hounded let that be a warning he's probably already got you but day after day it said he hearkened not unto her and refused to be with her we go we know the story we go on down I'm I'm just going to skip through some of the story for time's sake but we know he refused and she grabbed a hold of him and stripped him of his Cod and and held on to it and then falsely accused him after all blessings after all the good after everything he'd done for her her husband's household do you see what kind of wickedness this woman Was Not only was she a hard a fornicator an adulterer she didn't even care about the well-being of her own husband the household his wealth his riches his his uh notoriety his Prosperity she didn't care about none of that she was so selfish and that's the way the devil lives and that's why we harp so much on selfish attitudes that's selfish spirit will take you nowhere if you're selfish and it's all about you and it's all about me me me me me it's not going to be a fun road it's about what you can do for others it's about what you give to others there's a saying some of you some of you ladies may have noticed it I notice things I pick up quotes and scri and in scripture and and just quotes and stuff everywhere but it says it's not what we Gather in life but what we scatter that was Sam Walton's wife it's on the wall of every Sams and that you'll ever go into walk back towards the bathroom and you'll see it on the left hand wall of ever Sams that I've been to it's not what we gather but what we scatter that's a selfless attitude so here she is this selfish woman I can promise you brothers and sisters I can promise you without a doubt in my mind that Joseph did not see this coming in the vision did you ever see any of your troubles coming no that's not the way it works he never even foreseen his brother's deceitful lies he never he never foreseen their Envy he didn't foresee their their malice their hatred he didn't foresee the pit that he would be thrown into he didn't foresee being sold down into bondage you see the devil don't just come and announce his presence say he this is what I'm going to do to you on this date on this day of this year and then this is what you're going to go no that's not the way it works but still it's a purpose and a plan it weaves itself all through everything you don't go through anything in life without it something being behind it there's a reason behind everything you go through I'm beginning to see that more and more as I'm getting older and older that's right and as I've been I I teach classes now some and I and I got this theory that you go from point A to point B and everything in you point a is your vision point a is what you see point a is what you think life is what you're looking for point B is when you get there and you arrive and you say this was the Fulfillment of my vision now how you get there is what happens all in between that's life and you don't know what it's going to take to get from point A to point B sometimes it's here and sometimes it's here and sometimes it's here you're the gum on the bottom of the shoe how many's ever felt like the gum on the bottom of a shoe yeah sometimes that's the way it is and and Joseph he didn't see himself going through none of this he didn't see that he was going to have to suffer but he had to suffer and go through this but all he could see was point B the victory he knew what God told him he knew what God showed him he knew what would happen Watch What Happens but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison huh abused mocked put into a pit sold into bondage taking out of the pit prospering building up wealth lied about maybe you maybe maybe you didn't hear me lied about how many's ever been lied about if you hadn't it hurts it hurts real bad lies destroy people and here's Joseph lied about tried to be destroyed and the Lord was with Joseph what is it that get you through that through it all through it all it's Jesus he gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners man you are an amazing amazing person I don't know why you going through what you going through I don't know where you came from or what your heritage is or what's going on in your life or why you're having to suffer the way you are but you are one prosperous dude I want you to be over everybody I want you to take control over the whole situation I want you to to go in there and tell them what to do you show them how to do the job and we're going to build a we're going to build a kingdom that the world has never seen do you realize Joseph had a big part in plan with with building up of Egypt and he begins to build this up and build this up because the Lord was with him and showed him mercy and gave him favor and back into the prison now we would look at this and we would say this is not fair this is not fair how could God allow this to happen to Joseph and Joseph the prophet tells us was a very type of Christ how could he allow this to happen think it not strange concerning the fiery trials let me ask you this Joseph is up and down in trials and hardship and and troubles over and over and over and the problem is that he's a type of Christ let's just talk about the The Life of Christ for just a second what happened when he come onto the scene and was baptized went right into the Wilderness went right into trials right into temptation right into struggles right into the adversaries Den right into the living room of where Satan lived said why don't you just jump off of here the angels will catch you [Music] uh well it's written I won't tempt my god well if you're if you're so hungry Jesus why don't you just take these stones and turn them into bread well let me there's something I read something about that this is a big old document got a lot of good stuff in't it huh my Lord shall provide amen do you see what I'm saying even Jesus's life did that change the purpose of Jesus being on the scene his mission his vision never changed from when he arrived on the scene went into the Wilderness being tempted by Satan his whole purpose his whole Vision was a day on a cross called Calvary he never wavered he was persecuted he was mocked he was spit upon he was troubled you see sometimes God delivers us hard situations that's where we see where the rubber meets a road so let me ask you tonight let me ask you tonight when you're standing there and you you're face to face with a wall it's been put in your life do you just stand there and do you stare at that wall and say oh my goodness why is this happening to me why can't I go forward why can't I have healing why can't I have Deliverance why can't my children be saved do you focus on the wall do you focus on the problem or do you focus on the solution it's what you devote your time to if you want to devote your time to the problem you know what you'll have worry fear anxiety doubt frustration but if you begin to look at the solution and you begin to look at the the the changing factors the solution of Calvary and say that no matter what comes my way God will lead me whether it'll be over it under it around it through it I don't know how but the the solution is God will take me through he will get me to the other side so that's why we don't need to just belly ache sometimes our faith is going to be rocked so sometimes our faith is going to be rocked Joseph didn't do anything to find himself in this situation but I want you to notice this his brothers we know wanted him dead they took advantage of him wrongly accused him he didn't even have a voice in this in this in this uh direction of his life was traveling but scripture never reveals to us that Joseph sat around questioning and doubting did you ever notice that not once in the scripture did Joseph complain did you ever find it you never hear him complaining you never hear him doing any of those things you never hear him going in there and trying to trying to blame somebody he's not doing the blame game but he just continues to do what God is wanting him to do you see because there was a famine coming there was a famine coming upon the land and God had revealed to Joseph this fact that there is a famine coming and without adequate food everybody all people your people the Egyptians the Israelites are you with me all of these people are going to die you have a purpose you have a plan and so this famine coming God listen to what happens Watch What Happens God allowed Joseph to be slow sold into slavery that was not Satan you realize that God allowed him to be sold into slavery he allowed him to be wrongfully Accused by Piper's wife God allowed the Baker and the cup bear to be placed in the prison where he was you see we just see the front we just see what happens on stage we don't see what's happening in the background we don't see the costumes that are being changed we don't see who's turning on the lights who's doing this and who's doing that that's God's business God allowed Joseph to interpret dreams God used the famine to bring the family of Joseph of J Jacob to Egypt God used Joseph to prepare a place for them as they took Refuge God used Joseph to save the world even the ishmaelites the ones who bought him owed him into slavery you say well how you know it said that the whole world was saved the whole world was dependent upon Joseph's uh sa saving the world his interpretations so how did Joseph do this no complaining no murmuring Colossians 323 I think describes this to a te and whatsoever ever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ if anybody had a reason if anybody and we're going to wind this down had a reason to quit to complain or to walk away Joseph did my little trials my little troubles they're a toothache compared to what Joseph went through he could have quit he could have lived a lifestyle of laziness resentment he said if this is the way it's going to be God how many people's done that if this is the way it's going to be God if this is the way you're going to treat me I refuse ref to serve I quit going to church it's amazing how many people lose their lose their relationship with God because of a deacon or a pastor or a trustee or just somebody in the church last time I checked we was all human I'll tell you right now I've said things I wish I could have took back a many of times brother Bor has said things he wished he could take back a many of times human but to allow somebody's fallacy or somebody's misunderstanding or somebody's uh uh not seeing something the way you do you're going to allow that to take you out of church you're going to allow that to take you and ruin your relationship with God and your fellowship with brothers and sisters it won't work well I'll just stream no you won't I'll just go I I'll drive let me tell you I drove two hours to church Faithfully it wasn't fun they all a thing fun about it resilience Joseph was resilient we look at the life of Joseph and we see he's resilient he was able to withstand he was able to recover quick from his difficulties he kept his character he kept the way he no matter what circumstances was he was going to serve others now I'm going to ask you this kind of in our closing thought here if I could hand you a crystal ball tonight and you could see exactly where you would be in five years how many of you would want to look into that ball tonight you think well I don't know if come on my hands up come on church I'm not going to finish till we raise our hands because I know you all want to know what would happen in five years where you're at how wealthy you are how many grandkids you got how many kids are married all right some of you is going to going to play with me most of us would want to know where we're at in five years so tonight I'm gonna tell you how you can know your future and you don't have to have a crystal ball to know it I just want you to if you want be in five years I want you to ask yourself this question what are my habit oh church mouse I hear him back here it's quiet ask yourself what are my habits your habits today will tell you where you'll be in 5 years from now it applies to everything in life how many people want to get in shape but their habits today now you're getting the picture and peanut butter cookies on Sunday evening it ain't working for me ask yourself what are your habits so now let me ask you this what are the habits with Jesus what were the habits of Jesus Jesus was committed to doing the will of God he was committed to Ministry I do not seek my own but the will of the father who sent meit was Jesus knew that having God's Will and knowing the the Old Testament and and and living out his life was guid and when Satan tempt him he replied that's a good habit a good habit is Jesus said those who obey my Commandments are the ones who love me and because they love me years they love me and I reveal myself to each one of them Jesus habit had a habit of being disciplined in solitude he didn't let the care of the him distract him from who he distraction distractions thinking the other day and I didn't get to study this out so I'm just going to throw it out look at it around us you know we have the or the interweb internet do you realize that's telling you what it is it's a net it's grabbing you it's capturing you it's holding on to you you ever tried to get out of a fish net it ain't no fun them little them little squares they grab you and they hang your clothes they hang you buttons they hang you shoelaces you ever get trapped in a net it's got you Netflix movies that grab you let's just break it down now 20 years ago if you told me we had Netflix I'd have said nah people used to throw the TVs out now we pack one in our pocket and watch one on the on the wall looking at both of them at the same time Netflix think about what it is Apple computer this is nothing against Steve Job it's just come to me I seen a little little thing on this and I thought this really makes sense what is the sign of the Apple computer a bite out of an apple what is typically the original sin I feel like we could just keep going distractions iPhone a channel how do you get a hold to somebody how do you how do you know somebody how do you see what somebody's really thinking you look in their eyes eyes tell the stories I work in sales if I can get make eye contact I'm begin to read you and I can listen to you and eyes and listen iPhone some of y'all are awful quiet but Jesus found himself as a habit to make himself as a discipline of solitude he would find a place where he could just get alone and be quiet did you ever notice that some of the best stories was when he could just slip away and he was just all to himself alone and them others and others that run around with him they wouldn't do it Lord help us save us we're going to die the waves are going to overtake us and he saw and L he had compassion for the hurting Jesus was always moved about compassion anytime he saw the sick the disadvantaged the Vernal compassion was turned into kindness two blind Beggars he touched their eyes and healed them Jesus had compassion on a widow restored her only son back to life it also tells Jesus had compassion on a leper touched him and healed him the Bible says he had compassion on a multitude because they were weary and Scattered like sheep having no Shepherd he prayed more workers for the plenteous Harvest Jesus moved with compassion on a crowd and healed their sick it records uh the Bible in Mark records how he moved with compassion on a multitude because uh they were like sheep without a Shepherd he began to teach them and this occasion he fed 5,000 men in their family he had compassion because they were hungry how many's hungry for God you see how this all ties together Faith this was a habit that Jesus practiced Faith Jesus had faith for miracles he didn't he didn't record any failures did you notice that in the Bible there's no failed Miracles out of all the stories Jesus done there's never one time that says well didn't work this time think the way God works he cursed a fig tree and what happened to it he spoke out of Faith to open the blind eyes heal the leper rais the Dead Calm the storm on the sea he told his disciples listen to this he told his disciples that Lazarus was sleeping he didn't say he was dead we always tell the story and we say Lazarus was laying dead in a tomb that's not what he said he said he was asleep he said he was asleep and when he got to the tomb Lazarus was asleep there for four days and he commanded him to come out of the grave and you know what he did so Jesus has had Jesus had a habit of Faith he told the woman with 12 years of a bleeding disorder that touched him by the Hemm of her garment said daughter your faith has made you well go in peace you have been healed these are affirmations in my deed book you say how does that apply to us today we need to practice what we preach a little over a year ago brother John come up for prayer couldn't hardly walk crying a man man of his stature crying walking down that aisle we had prayer for him for his back and it struck me something struck me and I had a marker and I had a handkerchief that we prayed over that I preached over and we prayed over and if I'm not mistaken I wrote the date on it and I wrote John lter healed of sciatic pain sciatic ba back pain and I handed that to him and I said you keep this as a reminder and don't you claim nothing no different I forgot about it he didn't forget about it a couple weeks ago he pulled out of his pocket he said you remember that still holds Good am I telling the truth now let me ask you John has has the devil had to put any claims on that he's he's T he's touched you a time or two hadn't he he's scratched at you he's clawed at you but you pull out that reminder and say this is what was done for me on this day brother Michael John come up for prayer just a few weeks ago scoliosis of the back in pain couldn't stand it me and brother berer we had prayer for him the other day he said he he called me on the phone he said you know brother Brad I don't let you know my back Pain's gone am I telling it right that's what practicing God In Action does that's what faith in action produces it's not just back in this day it's not just when when he told the uh the the immoral woman who come and washed his feet with her hair and told her to to to go and your faith has saved you go in peace it's not just for that day it's for today he's still alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still Hebrews 13 and8 today God in action if my God is dead I have no need for him if he's dead he's not going to do you any good but he's not dead He's Alive in well he's alive in well living and free to dwell to tell the whole world you know the angel Gabriel told Mary with God nothing shall be impossible nothing shall be impossible Joseph and we're closing I promise Joseph had some habits unwavering Faith maintaining Integrity you know sometimes when you go through those difficult situations Integrity is a hard thing to hold on to trials challenges so somebody done you wrong that's that old country song Somebody done you wrong song well might as well say it we took off yesterday Weston and I he's trying to find some doors for this project he's working on he's trying to he's got a wedding coming up so he's trying to prepare a mansion so he looking for some doors to replace these interior doors lo and behold I find some I hope this fellow's listening I hope you tuned in tonight buddy we go to get these doors we drive an

about it and I thought you know what it's not going to do me any good to argue with this guy it's not going to change the situation one bit he's not coming off the price I'm not spending another dollar have a good day and I thought you know what somebody like that just needs forgiveness that was another habit that Jesus practiced forgiveness you know he practiced that on each and every one of us where would we be without forgiveness Joseph Integrity he kept his Integrity in the difficult situations demonstrated self-control strong work ethic towards his brothers that had wronged him I was like what brother Brandon was talking about he was talking about Joseph and this is en closing he said in his prison he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose he was going to set by a king all the rest of them was going to Bow a knee to him his vision told him so but before his vision could be completely fulfilled he had to become a prisoner he had to become a ruler and and when he come into the from the house from his prison house he become a prisoner of the word of God that he could only say what God had put in his mouth to say then God moved through him he said that applied to Moses and Paul and Joseph and Peter and Steve and John and H and Sarah and Becky it's only when we allow God to move through us is when the difference is made he said and notice his life portrayed Christ to us even sold almost for 30 pieces of silver taken up out of the ditch set at the right hand of pharaoh the ruler of the world at that day and every time he left the palace they sounded a trumpet and said every knee bow cuz Joseph is coming a perfect type of Christ in the Millennium when the trumpet sounds he'll come forth every knee shall bow and every tongue confess notice notice and closing in his prison he was a prophet nothing changed no matter what what situation what circumstance no matter what you're going through what's your circumstance nothing changes God's still God and you're still his the devil still loses we still win he's defeated we're Victorious let's stand to our feet you love the Lord tonight how many say I want to just be a prisoner to Christ I want my life to reflect everything that Christ has for me no matter the hardship no matter the trial no matter what I have to go through whatever it takes Lord Make Me fulfill the vision that you have for me in my life be careful know what you're asking for it takes sincerity to ask that because you don't know what's coming but remember Joseph saved an entire world seven years of famine seven years of feast seven years of famine let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day for the hour that you've given us to spend and to dwell and meditate on you and Lord we hope we haven't warned the People Too Much on a Wednesday night but we trust that it was uh edifying to the body Lord that there was strength to be given and victory to be had tonight Lord that we could see that in our lives no
