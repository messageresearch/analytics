these thoughts and then the couple young sisters get up and sing the power there's power in the name of Jesus then another couple gets up and they sing he came looking for me that was some confirmation for me I couldn't have handpicked those two songs any better if I had to but I'd just like to say uh Happy Mother's Day first of all um it's a privilege to be here uh with you guys on on Mother's Day and uh um it's an honor to be here uh I was a little surprised when when brother Thomas text me and was like hey can you come take uh well was first it was Wednesday night service and and uh I was like yeah yeah I can and then the storms hit and I guess you guys had some flooding and some tornado warnings coming through and so we canceled that and he's like what about Sunday morning I sure I can do Sunday morning so I uh yesterday I don't have a whole lot of problems with my allergies but yesterday Mercy they hit and I was like man and I was thinking Lord I hope I can sleep you know last night and you know it was it was a rough night but he he let me get a little bit of sleep and you know I thought the devil's fighting that hard to keep me from getting here something special is probably going to happen you know so Amen brother brother Thomas had also told me that you guys usually go an hour and a half on Wednesday and I thought man I'll do my best but then he said Sunday with three hours on Sunday morning right so yeah no it's uh like I said it's good to be here um met a few of you at a picnic three three four weeks ago and and I really just enjoyed the time with you and looking forward to this morning and and um yes so uh I may be uh a little different maybe than some other you've had I tell everybody I'm a I'm a message preacher that wears a tape boy pen he called out A peculiar people though right I believe brother brandham called us oddballs I don't know that I can get any more Oddball than a message preacher that wears a tape boy P so uh you all pray for me and and um we'll get through it but uh if you have your bibles if we could turn to Luke 8 we're going to read 38 and 39 Luke 8 38 and 39 now the man out of whom the Devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but Jesus sent him away saying turn to thine own house and show how great things God hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him return to thine own house and show how great things God hath done unto thee let's also turn to Second Timothy 1:7 probably familiar to to to some of you second Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind let's pray dear heavenly father Lord as we come before you once again Lord Lord just thankful for this this this place to be able to come in and assemble ourselves together Lord and fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith father Lord I just pray that you would just come in Lord I've your spirit has felt so strongly already Lord I just pray that you would just continue to have your way in this service Lord Lord I pray that I would just get completely out of the way father that your Holy Spirit Lord would just shine through me father and just say whatever you would want me to say Lord Lord if I go to say something that you don't want me to say or that would be displeasing to you father I pray you would just shut my mouth Lord Lord I pray that you would just take complete and total control of this service have your way Lord anoint me to say what you would like for me to say and I pray that you would anoint the ones here to hear what you would have for them Lord Lord we love you and we just thank you for all that you do in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated thank you I'm going to take this jacket off if that's okay okay and get a little bit more comfortable you know as I was thinking about what I was going to speak on and knowing that today is Mother's Day I don't know if there's any Mothers here that maybe have had some children that have gone astray or maybe you're sitting here now and you've got some children that have gone astray and you've been praying for them but I'd like for you to hold that in your heart as we talk about this subject that I'm going to speak on I know you guys don't know me and uh so I thought instead of really preaching to you this morning I'm going to give you a couple testimonies so I want to read a quote this is uh 1950 believest thou this the first day passed oh my how dark second day passed dark Third Day fourth day all hopes was gone he's already a rotting in the grave and the skin worms was going through him all hopes was gone everywhere discouraged their pastor had let them down their loved one The Miracle Worker had let them down didn't come to the rescue and there was Mary and Martha left alone mother and father gone now just them two girls left alone in the world World someone come along to encourage them they sat in sackcloth Black Veils and weeping and mourning over their brother and now in their very darkest of hours then Jesus came along that's just the way he does it Amen brother it may be your darkest hour right now but Jesus comes along just at those at the darkest of hour when I think of it the darkest The Darkest Hour the woman with the blood issue had ever seen she spent all of her money then Jesus come along it was the darkest of hour that Jas had ever seen his little daughter lay dead then Jesus come along it was the darkest of hour that Peter and the apostles had ever seen on the sea looked like they was going to drown then Jesus came along so I'm going to start off by talking to you a little bit I want to talk to you about this man that we just read about Legion and uh my title is Legion in me we're going to take a take a look at this man Legion that we don't know his name the Bible never tells us his name we just know this man as Legion and uh this man was living in a graveyard was living in the tombs amongst the tombs amongst the dead that's where this man was living he was naked he was cutting himself this was his life brother Brandon would talk about him and he would take this story and he would give us a little more Insight on it that this man was not always like this this man had a wife he had kids that from time to time this man would come to himself and he would remember I've got a wife and I've got kids I'm sure this man had a mother his mother was probably praying for him I don't know how many Mother's Days went by that she didn't hear from this man but I'm sure she was praying for him but he would come to himself and he would have these thoughts I had another life but he gotten himself into a a situation he gotten himself into a position he could not get himself out of he had made some choices in life that took him down a road so far he was powerless to turn around and come back brother Braham talked about that maybe he maybe he took a drink one day and a demon entered into him he goes home and he has to tell a lie to cover what he just did and another demon enters in then maybe he had to tell another lie to cover that lie and another demon and he just kept doing this until he was completely demon-possessed he got himself in this situation he could not get himself out of it so here he is in the grave in this graveyard naked cutting himself but one day as he was in that graveyard naked cutting himself being tormented by these demons there was a man on the other side of the sea that was about to enter into a boat this man had just preached to 5,000 people and he was leaving every one of of them because there was one across the sea that before the foundation of the world had something placed in him Satan would do everything he could to stop this moment from happening he sent a legion of demons caused a storm to come upon that sea Jesus just spoke it out of existence because he was going to that one nothing was going to stop him from getting to that one as we look at this scene for a moment these disciples had probably rode through the night in this boat to get to the other side of the sea maybe it was Dawn about the time they got there as they pull up onto the shore Jesus steps out the disciples step out they're looking out here all they see is tombs maybe the sun is rising a bit behind them and the Shadows from these tombs are Long Shadows being CAU cast along the ground maybe the fog hasn't lifted quite yet it's a very eerie sight that they're looking at and I see as Jesus would start walking maybe the disciples thought we'll just get behind him this this doesn't look real real good as they fell in behind him see Legion was in there Legion had lost everything any job that he'd ever had any money that he'd ever made any house that he ever owned his wife his kids his mother his father everything he had lost everything this was this man's darkest hour and then Jesus came me he walks as he comes out of that boat and he starts walking here comes this man running out of the Grave to talk with him but it's not the man that's talking it's the demons talking out of this man they encounter Jesus what are you doing here you know I love Jesus I love the way he reacts in this moment he doesn't start screaming he doesn't start jumping up and down and raising his voice and speaking in tongues he just simply says go and just like that 2,000 demons leave this man this man that was in a position that he could not do anything to get out of in an instant That's The Power of Jesus Christ and as I can imagine this man Legion coming to himself for the first time and who knows how long thinking my goodness what kind of power this man possesses what kind of man is this and just like any of us knowing we don't really have anything to go back to we've destroyed anything that we've ever accomplished and ever had in our life we've destroyed it I'm going with you that's what he was thinking I'm going with this man right here and as Jesus gets into the boat and he turns and he looks at Legion and he says return to thine own home I'm sure Legion is thinking or wait a minute I know what you just did for me but maybe you don't quite understand what I've done to others there's no way that I can return home there's nobody there that loves me they certainly don't trust me there's no possible way that I can return home and Jesus says return to thine own home and show them the things God has done for you so as I'm sure that as he starts to walk home maybe he had an old pair of clothes or something that was stashed somewhere amongst the tombs and he threw some Rags on probably put his hands in his pockets head was down as he was walking back to his house the people seeing him come were the same ones that had tried to chain him and tie him up because he' try to hurt people and I'm sure these people as they would see him coming would cross to the other side of the street thinking yikes that that's that's that man right he does at least have clothes on but that is him they're getting away from him and I'm sure he's just thinking just get back to your my house just get me back to my house and as he gets to his house he notices that it's empty because this man that was a husband that was a father hasn't been around to pay the bills he hasn't been around to help his family so he sees this house that he once had and it's sitting empty maybe he asked somebody have you seen the people that that lived here in this house they yeah they're they're down here in this this alley down here so he starts walking down the alley and looks up and all of a sudden he sees his wife he sees his kids so he starts walking towards them he notices their clothes are ratty they're torn they're dirty they don't have anything they see him coming they turn to run he says hold on just a second please wait just one just just one second kids probably ran and got behind mom she's not sure what to do at this moment do I turn and run what do I do he says give me just just one minute so I want to tell you I want to tell you something see Daddy met Jesus today and I want to tell you about it I want to tell you what happened to me today as they stand there and they talk for just a few minutes she's noticing something seems different something seems a little different he says can I just have dinner with you she reluctantly agrees so they go into the Little Shack she prepares dinner they sit down at the table which they haven't done in a long time and he starts to tell them what happened to him that day what what his life had been like and how he he'd met a man today that changed him they're sitting there looking at him she's not sure what to do night starts to get come around and he asks can I put the kids to bed I haven't done that in a long time she says okay she's watching him very carefully there's no trust here there's no love love here he puts the kids to bed kisses them good night hasn't done this in a long time he comes back out with his wife they're standing there they talk for a little bit longer he's just asking her give me a chance just give me a chance she's thinking about this and night is fallen and it's time to go to bed he looks over in the corner of the room and there's one bed and he looks at her and he can read all over her face if you think you're getting in that bed with me you've lost your mind we've got a covered porch we'll make you a bed out there you can sleep out there he agrees to this so that night when he goes out there he's got his bed ready and maybe he kneels down for the first time in a very long time to pray and all of a sudden it starts to sink in he didn't just say go tell them he said go show them and he starts that's that really starts to sink in this go show them that might take a little while to do this and so he says his [Music] prayer he uh gets up the next morning maybe gets up a little bit earlier he goes and he fixes breakfast for his family wife gets up kids get up they're thinking wow this is definitely different for sure so they eat breakfast he talks with him for a little bit and he says uh I'll be back in a little while there's something I've got to go do as he walks out the door there's a little crate sitting on the porch and he picks up that that crate he starts walking to the middle of the city his wife looks out the window she's thinking what in the world is he doing maybe she thinks I'm just gonna follow him from afar because I want to see what he's doing and she's watching him walk to the city he's got this crate maybe she's thinking wonder if he's going back to the same bar that he used to go to maybe he's going to take that crate and fill it with bottles of alcohol maybe that's what he's doing he's going to try to come back and hide it somewhere at the house but as she watches him walks into the middle of the city he sets that crate down he gets up on top of it and he says people of GAD come let me tell you about a man that changed my life I want to show you what this man did for me me and even though he's going to have critics the rest of his life he's going to have critics because there's going to people be people say you did not deserve what he did for you there's no way that he took somebody that was that evil and changed you to this person over here it's not possible but I guarantee you that he stood on that box for the rest of his life and you ask me why would I say that how would I know that because he came in contact with Jesus Christ that's the power of Christ he can change somebody from here and make them this person over here because he works in the impossible that's what he does is The Impossible what did he do for Legion he gave him power he put love in his heart and he gave him a sound mind Legion was not worthy of any of this there was nothing Legion could do to deserve what happened but he was born differently he looked like a vessel of Wrath but he was a vessel of Mercy it ta took the light from the S so n to hit that seed that had been planted in him and once it did it changed his life life forever he will never go back to that again from that moment on he will walk different he'll talk different he'll think different he'll pray different he was a different person that's the testimony of Legion I told you I wanted to tell you a couple of testimonies so I'm going to tell you a little bit about me you guys don't know me so this is going to be a real good way for you to get to know me so Legion and me found ourselves in a very similar situation now I will say that I didn't have a couple thousand demons in me my wife sitting right there may disagree with that but Legion and I found ourselves in a very similar situation found ourselves in a situation that we could not get ourselves out of I'm going to read you another quote this is from the church age book Here and Now set forth the love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there be there before him lies all mankind as a lump as one lump of clay out of that that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained and conformed to His Image in their walk he reproves with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be these vessels that brother bram's talking about here are mentioned in Romans nine they're also regarded as vessels of Wrath and vessels of Mercy that God knew before the foundation of the world by his foresight he could look down through time and he knew who was going to choose this and who was going to choose this jacob have I loved Esau have I hated and they had not been born yet but he knew by predestination who was going to be who vessels of Wrath vessels of Mercy Mercy vessels of honor and of dishonor in 1997 we went me and my wife which was not my wife at this point we went to some meetings that brother Billy Paul Branham was holding in Pennsylvania and I was seeking the Holy Ghost I would have been 20 years old and uh we get to these meetings and brother Billy he did a prayer line and I went through this prayer line and I told Brother Billy I remember telling him I need the Holy Ghost so bad that's what I told him and I remember the prayer that he prayed with me I'll never forget that prayer I'll never forget what he said but it was in that moment there was a lot of emotion that that took place there and I thought that I had received the Holy Ghost but I hadn't the very following year in 1998 me and my wife got married that's been almost it' be 26 years ago next Thursday now I want you guys to keep in mind that we were born and raised in the message both of us were we both went to the brandham Tabernacle for years and it meant absolutely nothing for us and I don't say that to say something derogatory about the Bram Tabernacle I love the Bram Tabernacle Bram Tabernacle will always mean a lot to me that's where I got my Foundation but it meant nothing to me because I didn't have a relationship with Christ I knew the pastor I was at the brandham Tabernacle but I had no relationship with Christ see I've seen people come from the Baptist from Pentecostal I've seen them come from Catholic and I've seen them come into the message I've seen people that are in the message that you would never in a million years think would leave the message and I've watched them walk away and not just walk away but then turn around and attack this message why because they didn't have a relationship with Christ they had a head knowledge of the message and they had nothing in here so both of us born and raised in the message we get married 1998 and I remember and I'm just G to be transparent with you guys a little bit here I hope that's okay I remember the first fight that me and our my wife got into was on our honeymoon got into a fight over money and I mean it wasn't just a little fight I mean it was a fight we didn't talk to each other for half the day we were there this just kept getting worse and worse as time went by we had pictures hanging on our wall in weird places but they were to cover the holes from where things would get thrown this relationship just continued to get worse the fighting just continued to get worse five years into our marriage my wife gets pregnant with our first child this is also the same time we separate for the first time and you guys can imagine how well that went I am supposedly a message believer and I have just left my pregnant wife you can imagine the phone calls I was getting I didn't care I didn't there was nothing inside of me to care to to make me care about anything I didn't care we ended up patching things up we get back together seven years in now we have two girls we have Camilia is my oldest Alina is our youngest and they are 10 and a half months apart my problem was I didn't know how to show love it would be like me grabbing somebody around the throat holding them up against the wall and shaking them and saying why can't you see that I love you that's the way I would express it I didn't know how to show love seven years in two kids now fighting continues just keeps getting worse we had been going to church but now our lifestyle starts to change a little bit and we start moving away from church a bit as we start doing this the more we move away from church the more people back away from us I've said this many times I'll say it to you guys as well this is something we've got to get better at in the message somebody starts to go down the wrong path the worst thing you can do is go the opposite way now I don't mean go out and go to the bar with these people but check on them show them love now I'm not saying that that's what my problem was and I'm not saying that would have changed anything but that's a problem we need to get better at so as we continue fighting and start moving away from church and again our problem was we had no relationship with Jesus Christ so this continues and continues and one day I had a friend of mine just so you guys know I am a general contractor by trade that is what I do so I had a a plumber friend of mine that did work for me from time to time and uh I needed a new water heater so I called him up and and uh he came over to to to change out our water heater I help him get it out of the house and as he's putting in the new one I'm out in the front yard draining out the old one I come in to hear him this man's name is David by the way and I want you to remember this man's name David okay I come in and David is talking to my wife about marriage classes I'm like oh my goodness gracious he goes to a mega church and I'm thinking yeah that's what we need is marriage classes from a mega church because I mean we're message Believers we don't need marriage classes from a mega church but as David continues to talk I finally reluctantly say fine we'll go to some marriage classes so we did go and they were helpful unfortunately it was like putting a Band-Aid on this gaping wound and so we keep going down this path we keep pulling away from church other parents didn't necessarily want our their kids hanging out with our kids because we weren't in church all the time we started looking a little different from other people and as you start moving down this path you will finally hit a moment anger starts to build anger towards your spouse anger towards church anger starts building and you'll get to a point where you're you just think I just thought God I've done I've I've I've I've been in the message but it's it hasn't helped me there's nothing is helping me I'm watching my family just slide this way we're going this way we're we're losing our friends everything is falling apart if you're not going to help me I don't need you and then when you cross that line right there now it's extremely hard to back up and then Satan has got you right where he wants you because see now Satan will just start feeding you things just a little bit at a time just a little bit at a time what something something very small doesn't seem like much you you take that and then he's here just a little bit further just keep coming a little bit further and you just keep grabbing and grabbing and as a message believer you'll start doing things that you never would have thought that you would ever do but you just keep moving in that direction so Satan now has us right where he wants us we're not praying anymore we're not going to Church our friends of all but gone but see the thing is is every one of us is born with that that little hole and if you don't fill it with him you're going to fill it with something and so he just keeps handing you more and more and more and things just keep getting worse and worse and worse because I can tell you that there's never a point where Satan has your best interest at heart he is trying to break you down he is trying to destroy everything about you that he can destroy it looks like fun until everything's gone so as we just keep moving in this direction we just keep getting worse and worse kids are starting to grow up the fighting is still going on it's it's getting worse than ever our kids are about 13 14 years old and I come home home one day and my youngest daughter says something about my wife had mentioned divorce I thought really okay because in my mind I've done the things that I'm supposed to do I'm supposed to be a provider which I had done anything that they wanted I got it for them house cars whatever I had done my part as far as being a provider that's in my mind that's what I was supposed to do and I had done that so if you want a divorce fine we'll get a divorce let's see how you do without me so I remembered that day she came home and I asked her that question she said yes I I'd mentioned that I said okay I'm gone so I packed a couple bags and this was the second time we split up I walked out the door had no idea where I was going had no idea where I was even going to live walked out the door believe it was two days later that my wife called my one and only friend at that time his name was Rob now I'm going to give you a little background to Rob okay Rob was a man that also went to that same mega church Rob was a divorced man he was not living right himself a couple years prior to this moment that I'm talking about about me walking out is when I had met Rob me and Rob became pretty good friends we did the same line of work we were both contractors we ended up going to Houston Texas together for a while to do work when the economy got really bad while we were in Houston Texas Rob ter goes to Joe olin's church he visits anybody here doesn't know who Joe Olstein is he's a very wealthy Pastor that preaches prosperity Rob goes to Joel olin's church I would have never met Rob except for the fact that that man that I talked about David the plumber what's my point to this that he will use anybody that he wants in any manner that he wants to get to one of his I never meet Rob without David Rob never turns his heart his life around and gives his heart back to the Lord without Joel Olstein he does not miss a detail these were the people that he placed in my life because he knew I was going to need these people he doesn't miss a detail so my wife calls my friend my one and only friend Rob she tells him what's going on we have no idea why she did this this is something that I just call her a moment because we don't know why she did it she despised me there was nothing about me she liked she had made the remark many times it would be better for her to live alone than it would be with me she felt alone with me anyways so Rob gives me a call he ask me what's going on I didn't even really want to get into it with him to be honest with you but he kept prying so I started telling him what was happening well long story short he asked me he said if I can get her to sit down with us would you come and sit down with me I was like sure whatever it's not going to help anything it's not going to fix anything she's not even GNA come so he gets her she agrees so we both agree to sit down with my my friend Rob now we meet at this little restaurant about lunchtime and I remember at least three times Rob having to tell me to calm down because I was actually starting to draw attention to the table because I was getting so loud this meeting here went absolutely horrible but during this meeting I remember Rob asking her what's the pro what do you think the problem is and her answer was is he does not respect me he does not respect my opinion on anything Rob looks at me and he says is that true and I remember playing as day saying yes that's very accurate I don't respect her and I don't respect her opinion and even in that moment I still did not think there was anything wrong with that whatsoever because I wasn't the problem she was it wasn't me it was her I was I had done my part I was the provider as we're having this moment I remember looking across the table at my my friend Rob I see tears starting to run down his face and I start thinking to myself you've got to be kidding me my one and my only friend and now she's got him suckered in she's got him on her side I just get more angry we end up leaving the restaurant storming out it was terrible about two weeks after that Rob kind of trying to talk to me a little bit from the time we left there and till this moment I'm getting ready to tell you about two weeks after this as I said I'm a contractor and in that moment I had a lot of work and I didn't have enough people to do the work so I had a customer that was wanting a floor job done they weren't going to be home I didn't have enough guys to come help me with it so I went to this house by myself I get in there and I start laying the floor I get on my knees it's interesting the things that can happen when you get on your knees you see I was in a moment right here I didn't know what I was going to do I didn't know where I was going to go I didn't know where I was going to live truth be told I was thinking about moving to Florida and as I'm going through these thoughts in my mind I had one friend left I had lost my family my wife my kids they wanted nothing to do with me this right here was my darkest hour and then Jesus came you see as I was on my knees laying that floor I can't explain to you what happened all I can tell you is that in a moment I found myself arguing with myself over was it my fault or hers and it took all of about 30 seconds for him to take a 40-year-old man men don't change it took him about 30 seconds to to change the heart of a 40-year-old man right there in that moment that's the power of Jesus Christ I didn't understand what was going on but I got up off the floor I immediately called my buddy Rob now there's tears running down my face I'm telling him what's going on he's blown away he doesn't even know what to say he says you need to go home you need to talk to them return to thine own home so unlike Legion I didn't know what had happened here but I can tell you that Daddy had just met Jesus for the first time so I text my wife and I asked her can I meet with you for just a couple minutes she said says yes so I go home the kids were in another room and I remember getting her and setting her down on the couch and taking her by the hands and getting down on my knees and ask her to forgive me as tears are streaming down my face and I look up at her brother Thomas it's blank there's nothing and I all of a sudden I'm thinking this might take a while because just like Legion I'm coming to a home where there's no love and there's absolutely no trust whatsoever so after we get done talking we talk to my buddy Rob he asked her to see to save money if I could move into the basement of our house of my house so I agree to move into the basement the unfinished basement of my house I had concrete walls a concrete floor and that was it and I know you brothers are probably sitting here thinking that man lost his mind but I tell you it was because I had met Jesus Christ is why I agreed to that because I had every right by message law to come into that house and say I'm the head of this house something happened to me and now you all are going to have to fall under my headship I had every right to do that but because I had met Jesus Christ something changed inside of here and so I agreed to live in an unfinished basement not knowing how long this was going to take so I started living in our basement the only time I would come upstairs is if I needed to use the restroom because there was nothing in the basement I had a television and a mattress that's what I had down there my oldest daughter Chamilia would come down pretty much on a daily basis at least once just to check on me just that's who she is I lived there for a little while week maybe two and we came to the to the decision that I would start having dinner with my family once a week so the only interaction we had was once a week I started to ask my wife out on a date I asked my own wife out on a date three times before she finally said yes we go out on a date and it goes horrible as we're sitting there at the table now this time she's the one getting vress she's doing everything she can to push my buttons but I didn't react to it so even though this date goes horribly wrong the one thing that happened was I didn't get up and leave because the old me would have got up walked out of the restaurant and left her there and she could have figured out how to get home but I just sit there I tried just to talk calmly and talk through this which was very different she had to have seen this and was thinking something's a little different but I was taking little steps just one foot in front of the other and he had a hold of my arm so as we continue to progress our relationship starts getting better I was in the basement for four months before I was finally invited to come back and live with my family as me and her start getting back together our lifestyle has not changed again I'm just being transparent we were still going to the bars we were still wearing clothes we had no business wearing we were doing things we had no business doing this was our lifestyle and we just kept living that lifestyle but he had to another plan for us so what started happening mix was our daughters started heading down a path and as they started heading down this path we knew we had to do something for them and we knew the we had to get them away from school friends and get them church friends we had to get them some different friends so brother Trevor Eman I don't know if any of you know him but uh he had uh he had been one of the very few that had kept in contact with me and he kept telling me you've got you know just just come to this church of brother Nathan Bryant's church and my problem was there was I had known brother Nathan Bryant since he was about two years old and I could couldn't get those thoughts out of my head and I'm like there's no way I'm going to that church but eventually it was like okay we've got to find our Our Girls we've got to find them some friends some church friends see the idea was is to get them in church and once we did that then we could go live our own lifestyle and and they could have some church friends so we start to go to that church and I remember as I come into church again I am a message believer and I remember sitting there Sunday morning just doing everything I can to pick brother Nathan apart I'm not praying at this moment I have no relationship with Christ whatsoever see when you get to that those moments of where you've you you've told God I don't need you I'm I'm just G to do this myself and then you start moving away from fellowship from friends from brothers sisters Satan gets you isolated it's is that's exactly where he's wanting you at is isolated I've got a friend that's in the military he says the first thing the enemy does when they attack you is they try to isolate you they try to cut off all communication which is exactly what Satan had done there was no communication between me and God when there's no communication you can't call for help you can't call call for backup you can't call for supplies you can't call for anything you're isolated and that's where we were at it's exactly where Satan had us was right there we started going to that church and I remember it was the third or fourth the third or fourth service that we were in the end of service they start playing the song pass me not oh gentle savior brother I lost it I start crying I have no idea what in the world is wrong with me we're bringing our girls so that we can go do our own thing the next Sunday they start playing The Anchor Holds and I lose it again and I didn't understand what was going on with me but it was him dealing with me he started he started pulling me in and it was I think it was a couple months after we started going to church and he's starting to deal with me they uh tell us that this Camp is coming up byc I don't know if any of you young people have been there but we think this is great for our kids we'll make them go to this Camp so we take them we drop them off there was the second night that they called us second night we get a phone call she gets a phone call she puts it on speaker because our girls are irate they are not asking us they are demanding that we come and get them right now because this Camp is not up to their standards it's dirty there's flies this is not going to work for a week and I tell them you're there until Friday deal with it we'll see you on Friday now little did I know that the very next night they would meet him [Applause] they came in contact with Christ there at that camp so now we start going to church we start making some progression making some Headway I start praying again I start talking to the Lord about how I've got a family here and I can't just walk into this family and say hey we're going to start changing this and we're going to start doing this the clothes that they were wearing were the clothes that I bought them the makeup they were putting on was the makeup that I bought them the lifestyle that I was still living I was still wearing shorts I was still playing golf on Sunday afternoon instead of going to church I was still doing all of that but we just started making those little steps so I start praying to the Lord I know he's dealing with me I know I'm starting to change but they've got to change too but I can't just walk in there and say we're GNA do this so Lord I need you to step in I need you to do the impossible here you gave them to me and I didn't do my job I'm going to need you to do it for me so I watch as my family starts to change I watch as their progression they continue to move he does the impossible that's what he does a quote 1955 faith in action over and over again does the blind see the deaf hear over every night The Impossible scientifically impossible for a human being to do what the Holy Spirit does here every night right before for your face amen absolutely impossible but Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God does it anyhow six months in after I'm watching my family start to progress I'm starting to progress I rededicate my life to the Lord wasn't good enough for me just to go to church on Sunday morning and go play golf now now all a sudden something's happening to me and I'm getting serious six months in I rededicate my life and I I received the Holy Ghost I received the Holy Ghost at some meetings that we were having there was a prayer line going on I wasn't in the prayer line I didn't go in the prayer line I was sitting at my Pew praying for the people that were going through the prayer line but something happened in that moment I can't even sit here and say I physically felt anything a tear ran down my cheek there was no emotion like in 97 a tear ran down my cheek but I knew something had happened well you ask well how did you know that you received the Holy Ghost well because from that time I changed I could months down the road two months three months four months down something was different about me the way that I would address her the way that I would address my kids the way I would handle things was different I started talking different I started thinking different I started worshiping different I had someone ask me not too long ago how did I know brother Bram talks about something here and I want to express this to you because I had always wondered about what happened to me in that house when I was on my knees laying a floor what happened right there I couldn't couldn't understand that I knew there was no way that I received the Holy Ghost I hadn't repented of anything that would not be fair for him to treat me that way and everybody else a different way and I'm certainly not John the Baptist so that wouldn't have been fair so what happened in that house and then this scripture I came across this script scripture Ezekiel 3626 and 27 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them there's two different things being talked about right here brother Bram says in 56 hidden life with Christ now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel people has been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his Spirit that's your spirit then I will put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't PIV up to that your life doesn't pvy up to that people will stop at that moment right there thinking that they've got the Holy Spirit they don't have it Sunday morning is still good enough for them vacation cloth is still still okay with them taking that drink from time to time is still okay with them because that New Birth has not happened that change has not happened 1956 making the valley full of ditches show me your company I'll tell you who you are let me walk into your house let me see what's laying open on the table let me see how the Bible's marked up let me see where it's old Tru stories let me listen to what kind of music you're bringing on your radio let me see what kind of pictures you got in your house I'll tell you what you're made out of yes sir that's what your soul is feeding on regardless of what your testimony is your fruits prove what you are your fruits that's what we're looking for is a progress aggression not a feeling he never said did you feel it he said you believe it not a feeling not an emotion we're looking for fruits we're looking for one two three six months a year from now how's your life look don't stop at that moment where you feel something keep going until you see it until you can show someone what he's done for you so as we continue to go to church I'm doing a lot better my wife and kids are still struggling with things and I know that they are so I start praying to him again Lord I need you to I need you to help me here I can't do it I can guide them but I'm not going to come in here with an iron Rock and start swinging I'm doing the best I can I need your help though and then I start watching again if I would have walked in there and I would have went after them it wouldn't stick if the pastor says you need to do this and this and that's the reason you do it it won't won stick if brother brandham says you need to do this this and this and you're only doing it because brother brandom said do it it won't stick you've got to have a relationship with Christ he's the only one that can change someone from the inside out everybody wants to change the outward appearance but let him get a hold of you he changes what's inside here the outside will follow give somebody a chance to get him inside give him a [Applause] chance that vessel Of Dishonor very well might be a vessel of Honor that vessel of Wrath very well might be a vessel of Mercy so I stood back and I watched again I watched him start changing my family I can still remember my youngest daughter asking asking me to come take the fingernail polish r rack off of her wall that I hung there for her she took it down and she threw it in the trash I still remember the last time my oldest daughter wore a pair of shorts I can still remember the last time my wife went out for drinks with her friends but when she got there she couldn't take a drink [Applause] it wasn't me it wasn't me they found him and he started changing them and he started working from the inside out as we continue going to church and we continue to grow and we see these changes my wife gets concerned because she's saying why are you moving so much quicker than us spiritually why are you moving so much faster I didn't have an answer I didn't know why but it was a little while after she said that I heard somebody give these statistics Brothers if you hear anything I say this morning listen to this part right here there's any young Brothers in here that have just gotten married or thinking about getting married listen to this part right here statistics if you've got a family that's not going to church and the child of that family starts going to church there's a three and a half per chance that family will follow them if you've got the wife mother of a family that's not going to church and she starts going to church there's a 177% chance that that family will follow but if you take the father of a family that's not going to church and he starts going to church there's a 93% chance that that family will follow that is headship that is his design that's not a message statistic that's worldwide statistics that is a staggering number it's because it's headship and no matter how much the world is trying to break it down is trying to destroy that headship is trying to keep our young men's in Mom's basement playing video games I don't care how much they're trying to do it they cannot destroy that because it's his plan that's headship so young men middle-aged men husbands if you decide that you're going to stay home on Sunday morning to watch a game there's a 93% chance that family is going to follow you if you decide not to do devotions in your house there's a 93% chance that your family is going to do the same thing but if you decide to get up and go to church on Sunday morning to go to church on Sunday night if you have service to go to special meetings to to lead them in devotions there's a 93% chance they're going to follow you he was leading me I was leading them what changed us we met Jesus Christ I can still stand in church watching my kids with their hands in the air and I'll tear up every time I know right now they're in church why I'm not there because they're not doing it for me they're not doing it for the pastor because they met Jesus [Applause] Christ so as we start to keep progressing in our walk a couple years in I start feeling a call on my life and I'm thinking there is no way you have got to be kidding me there ain't nobody listen to one thing I say every every one of them know who I am they know where I came from nobody's going to listen to me Lord there ain't no way you got the wrong person I can also tell you he will not send you into battle unequipped he will equip you for whatever battle he is placing you in my biggest problem though was going to be telling my wife this that I'm feeling called she was raised tape only she had always thought that the church we were going to was just going to be a stepping stone and that we would eventually go back to tape only and I have to go tell her that I want to be a preacher let me rephrase that I did not want to be a preacher that I was feeling called to be a preacher I hit my knees again brother because I'm thinking Lord there's no way in the world that I can tell her this you're going to have to do something with her nine months my friend Trevor Eman knew and my pastor Nathan Bryant were the only two people that knew and I held that for nine months because I couldn't figure out the right time to tell her and when I finally broke down and I told her it was worse than what I thought it was going to be now I couldn't start ministering and I had this burning desire to start ministering and I couldn't do it because I just kept remembering if a God if God calls a man he'll call his wife I couldn't get past that one so I waited and I waited and I started slowly seeing her start to change and the opportunity came for me to go to Africa with brother Trevor I was going to be going to minister for the first time of my life in Africa she had progressed enough to where she said she was getting to the point where she was dealing with it and becoming okay with it I got to Africa the first place we stopped I unload my luggage and this fell out of my luggage it says hi just wanted to leave you a little note to say how proud of you that I am and how thankful of the husband and and father that you've become that God has made you I look forward to hearing all the stories and testimonies when you get back love Sarah he does the impossible that's what he does he does the impossible he makes the impossible possible possible when you're in that situation and you're thinking I don't see how to get out of this I can't even find the door to open give him just a minute he'll create the door and then he'll open it he does the impossible he took me and he had to thoroughly break down that vessel because he had to rebuild it the way he wanted it there's a brother by the name of Daniel Evans you guys may know him he's a pastor out in Tucson me and brother Daniel had known each other for a long time but we'd never really spoke we'd probably known each other for 20 years but we had never really spoke I was not very approachable I had been chiseling away at this thought of me being a a preacher with my wife for some time and it gotten her to the point where she was okay brother Dan Evans preached a sermon and he said something and brother Dan Evans and my wife come from a very similar background and I'd been chiseling away at this for a couple of years and all of a sudden he comes along and it's like he took a sledgehammer and just knocked this ball P her out so I just reached out to him because I wanted to let him know what he had done for our family in that setting I sent him a text like I said 20 years me and him made maybe had spoke five words to each other told him what had happened and everything we decided we were going to meet for breakfast so a couple days later we meet I got there a little bit before him he walks in I walk over I shake his hand I give him a hug we go when we sit down at the table he looks across at me and he goes something's different about you I didn't know what he was talking about I was like I got you know what gray hair my glasses I what is it you know he said no he said your entire demeanor is different what was that that's the power of Jesus Christ a man that I talk to maybe two or three times in my life looks across and could tell that something was different about me why because there was love coming through he could tell he could see there was something different Daddy had met Jesus is what the difference was I can still remember when he took me by the arm and he started walking with me I can remember him walking me back to my family brother Thomas I remember him walking me all the way to Africa to give this same testimony I'm giving right now he's walked me to 10 or 12 other churches to give this same testimony I'm giving right now what is that that's Jesus Christ that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he changed my life what did he do for me he gave me power he put love in my heart he gave me a sound mind there was something placed in me before the foundation of this world there wasn't a demon in hell that could stop what was going to happen it didn't matter what I had done in the past there was nothing could stop that moment people constantly talk about what God has done done in the Bible what he's done in the past what God is is doing he's going to do in the future he's coming back for us they talk about the past but what about right now he's not just the god of the Bible he's not just the god of our future he's the god of today Legion is standing in front of you right now he is the god of today he's the god of right now what you have need of he changed my life he's not a respector of person what he did for me he can do the same thing for you we moved into a house just a couple years ago there's a lot of trees on this property I'm closing there's a lot of trees on this property was one of the reasons why we bought this property three and a half acres a lot of the trees really pretty after we moved on to this property we noticed that when a storm would come these trees and I'm talking trees that you can't get your arms around I mean two of us couldn't get our arms around these trees these trees would fall over and they' be Hollow on the inside I was like what in the world is going on so I Googled it that's what we all do Google right I Googled it and it said that a tree can be dead and not know it these trees would were standing there big trees they would have leaves on them these trees that are dead can still produce leaves they cannot produce fruit they can stand there for a while but when a storm comes it'll knock them down I started thinking about that and then I heard a brother at our church get up and pray one time and he started talking about a fruit tree that he had pretty good sized tree that was in his front yard a storm came it knocked the tree over roots and everything came up out of the ground he had a buddy of his that had a crane he didn't know if it would work or not but he brought the crane over they lifted the tree back up they put the ports on that tree that tree re-rooted that tree is still growing that tree is producing fruit now and I thought that's me I was that tree everything looked good from the outside I was growing leaves everything looked right but I was dead on the inside and a storm came and when it came it knocked me over but then brother brandham said he would would take his finger to flick off the demons he promised to restore with the canker worm with the Locust with the grasshopper he promised to restore he would take his finger and just flick those off but with me he laid me across the strongest part of his body and lifted me back up this time when I rooted in I rooted into the Rock I rooted into Jesus Christ that's the God that I serve right there he can change your life let's pray dear heavenly father Lord
