[20:25] Good morning.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand.
[20:36] Brother Josh, would will you open the
[20:37] service with a word of prayer?
[21:29] Amen. Children could be dismissed to
[21:32] Sunday school. Let's open the Bible to
[21:36] the book of Psalms.
[21:41] Let's read from Psalms 46 to 47.
[21:59] God is our refuge and strength, a very
[22:03] present help in trouble.
[22:14] Though the waters thereof roar and be
[22:16] troubled, though the mountains shake
[22:19] with the swelling thereof, say
[22:32] &gt;&gt; God is in the midst of her. She shall
[22:35] not be moved. God shall help her and
[22:37] that right early.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of
[22:48] Jacob is our refuge. Sailor
[22:57] &gt;&gt; He maketh wars to cease unto the end end
[23:00] of the earth. He breakth the bow and
[23:02] cutth the spear in thunder. He burneth
[23:05] the chariot in the fire.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of
[23:18] Jacob is our refuge. Sa
[23:27] &gt;&gt; for the Lord most high is terrible. He
[23:30] is a great king over all the earth.
[23:38] He shall choose our inheritance for us.
[23:41] The excellency of Jacob whom he loved.
[23:45] Sa
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Sing praises to God. Sing praises. Sing
[23:55] praises unto our king. Sing praises.
[24:04] God reignth over the heathen. God siteth
[24:07] upon the throne of his holiness. This
[24:09] one together. The princes of the people
[24:12] are gathered together. Even the people
[24:15] of the God of Abraham. For the shields
[24:17] of the earth belong unto God. He is
[24:20] greatly exalted. Amen.
[24:23] Brother Brian.
[24:30] Thank you, brother.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Morning, brothers and sisters.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Is God your reference this morning?
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Have you turned everything over to him
[24:44] this morning? I was one of those quotes
[24:46] up there this morning. A couple of them.
[24:49] Um, you know, the one he would out of
[24:52] that message, desperation. And I was
[24:55] looking at that what brother Brandham
[24:56] said, you know, over 60 years ago, a
[24:59] Christian would be desperate if he sees
[25:01] the circumstances that he's living
[25:03] among. And I just have to raise my hand.
[25:06] You know, that was 60 years ago. Where
[25:08] are we this morning, the way the world
[25:11] is this morning? It should I have to
[25:13] examine myself if I do I have that
[25:16] desperation in my heart and life that I
[25:19] want to see God change my life, my
[25:21] family's life, everyone else's life. Um,
[25:24] if you would turn with me to
[25:27] the 12th chapter of
[25:32] of Romans, excuse me, I'll
[25:42] I I'm just going to read these uh
[25:48] I did something to myself this morning.
[25:51] I probably left what I meant to put in
[25:53] this Bible in the u in my office this
[25:56] morning, but I'll just read out of God's
[25:58] word this morning. And I wrote notes and
[26:01] I don't even have them here the way they
[26:02] should be this morning. Well, everything
[26:04] works for a purpose this morning. Um,
[26:07] I'll just read these couple of these
[26:09] verses out of the 12th chapter of Romans
[26:11] this morning. And, uh, I beseech you
[26:15] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[26:17] God, that you present your bodies a
[26:20] living living sacrifice, holy,
[26:22] acceptable unto God, which is your
[26:24] reasonable service.
[26:27] and be not conformed to this world, but
[26:30] be transformed by the renewing of your
[26:32] mind, that you may prove what is that
[26:35] good and acceptable and perfect will.
[26:38] And I can remember the notes I wrote,
[26:41] but I was thinking about that uh
[26:47] about being transformed. And I was
[26:49] thinking about that simple word this
[26:51] morning. And the other word come to me
[26:55] and that's what's the problem of the
[26:57] world is this morning.
[26:59] The church can't reform you. There's
[27:01] nothing
[27:03] Paul's saying here in the word of God is
[27:05] saying there's you're either going to
[27:07] you can't be reformed. There's nothing
[27:08] in our nature that can be reformed.
[27:11] There's nothing in our nature that's
[27:13] good. There's not to say that there's
[27:16] certain aspects that we do every is it
[27:18] wrong? No. But there's nothing in us as
[27:20] individuals
[27:23] that's perfect. Nothing that can be
[27:25] reformed. And I think the the world we
[27:27] live in this morning, instead of
[27:28] bringing people to Christ, they're just
[27:30] reforming them. They're telling them if
[27:32] you do this or if you do that or if you
[27:35] don't do that, you'll be okay. But
[27:37] that's not the way it is supposed to be
[27:38] this morning. I'm honest. Uh everything
[27:41] that I thought I was going to say this
[27:43] morning is completely out of my heart
[27:45] and mind. So I'm just going along with
[27:48] what the way that God would lead me. And
[27:50] I I don't
[27:52] I don't have a lot to say, but I would
[27:54] say the most important thing. I was
[28:00] give God the glory this morning. You
[28:01] know, I've been coming up here for over
[28:03] 30 years, and I got to be honest with
[28:06] you this morning. There's a presence on
[28:08] me right now that u I'd rather be quiet
[28:11] and just speak what God would have me to
[28:13] say than to say something where I'm
[28:15] going down my own way. But uh as I was
[28:17] reading this scripture this morning, it
[28:19] really struck me and some of the quotes
[28:21] struck me this morning. Uh, and I wrote
[28:24] a true transformation of one's soul,
[28:27] there must be a real you have to have
[28:28] that real seed of life in your heart and
[28:30] spirit this morning. And I was thinking
[28:32] of examples, one or the other. Uh, we
[28:36] all we all have earthly natures that
[28:39] we're born with that if we don't let God
[28:42] change those natures, they they come out
[28:44] at the time when they're least when you
[28:46] least expect. And then you realize when
[28:48] that nature comes out that you got to
[28:51] put it below the blood of Jesus Christ
[28:53] so that it doesn't come out anymore. And
[28:56] we want to be real Christians this
[28:58] morning. We don't want to be what God
[29:01] doesn't want us to be this morning. And
[29:04] I I don't have a lot to say. I'm going
[29:06] to turn it over to brother Josh this
[29:08] morning. But I was thinking,
[29:12] which can be a dangerous thing
[29:14] sometimes, but if I say anything this
[29:16] morning, I know I've only been up here
[29:18] for three minutes, but I really feel
[29:20] checked in my spirit. The only thing I
[29:21] would say to us this morning, just with
[29:24] what the quotes were saying this morning
[29:26] that were up on the thing, it you can't
[29:30] it's not an age to be playing around
[29:32] with Jesus Christ this morning. And if I
[29:34] were to say anything, I noticed is that
[29:37] the day of playing around with church or
[29:39] playing around with, well, am I going to
[29:42] do it today or am I going to do it
[29:44] tomorrow? Those days are over with. You
[29:46] the world is the world keeps going on
[29:49] into oblivion this morning. And if we're
[29:52] not careful, we're going to go right
[29:54] along with it if we don't cling to the
[29:56] cross of Jesus Christ this morning. And
[29:59] I'll just finish with this simple
[30:00] thought. Everyone here this morning, you
[30:03] uh including myself, we have to be
[30:06] resurrected in Jesus Christ this
[30:08] morning. We have to be transformed by
[30:10] the cross of Jesus Christ. It's not
[30:13] reformation. You can't get a
[30:14] reformation. Just think of all the ages
[30:17] that have gone by. It's that won't work.
[30:19] That's what's wrong with the church
[30:21] world out there this morning. They they
[30:23] just they're going along to get along.
[30:25] That's not how it's a Christian supposed
[30:27] to be this morning. We want to be true
[30:30] Christians with a seat of life in our
[30:31] hearts. And the only way you get there,
[30:33] and I was just thinking, you know, the
[30:36] difference between a makebelieve
[30:39] Christian and a real Christian, like I
[30:41] was listening to a message this morning,
[30:44] a real Christian, you can tell them, of
[30:47] course, everyone wears pants or a dress.
[30:49] The difference between a real Christian,
[30:51] a good soldier and a bad soldier is you
[30:55] can it's not in how strong he is or how
[30:58] loud he is, but like brother I listen to
[31:02] that message. It's in simplicity and you
[31:04] all know what I'm going to say. It's you
[31:06] can tell by their knees how good of a
[31:08] soldier they are this morning. In
[31:11] anything that we think we're going to
[31:12] do, do we pray first or we just act
[31:15] first? That's the I'll just finish with
[31:17] that. I know I said that and I'm still
[31:19] talking.
[31:20] What most importantly, do you act first
[31:23] or do you pray first? And I I got to
[31:26] raise my hand as a man. I sometimes I
[31:28] just act first without giving God a
[31:31] chance to speak to my heart sometimes.
[31:33] And that's not how we're supposed to be
[31:35] as Christians. We should pray first,
[31:38] desire to seek God's will in our lives
[31:40] first before we do anything. And I'll
[31:42] just turn it over to brother Josh this
[31:44] morning.
[31:59] Amen. Let's stand this morning.
[32:03] Amen. It's good to see everybody here
[32:04] this morning. Make special welcome to
[32:07] our visitors from Virginia, Sister Mary,
[32:09] Sister Riley. Good to have you here with
[32:11] us this morning. Amen. Those tuning in
[32:12] on the stream and our shutins, good to
[32:14] have you here as well. Amen. Listening
[32:17] many things about tomorrow.
[32:20] I don't seem to understand.
[32:23] Oh, I don't know
[32:27] about tomorrow.
[32:32] I just live
[32:35] from day to day
[32:40] and I don't borrow
[32:44] from it sunshine
[32:48] for it skies
[32:52] may turn to gray.
[32:57] I don't worry
[33:00] reor the future
[33:04] for I know
[33:08] what Jesus said
[33:12] and today
[33:15] [Music]
[33:16] walk beside him
[33:20] for he knows
[33:24] what is ahead.
[33:28] Oh, many things
[33:32] about tomorrow
[33:36] I don't seem
[33:40] to understand.
[33:44] But I know
[33:48] who holds tomorrow.
[33:50] [Laughter]
[33:52] And I know
[33:56] who holds my hand.
[34:00] I don't know
[34:04] about tomorrow.
[34:08] It may bring
[34:12] me poverty.
[34:16] But the one
[34:19] who feeds the sparrow
[34:24] is the one
[34:27] who stands by me.
[34:32] And my path
[34:35] that is my portion
[34:39] may be through
[34:42] the flame or flood
[34:47] but his presence
[34:51] goes before me
[34:55] and I'm covered
[34:58] with his precious blood.
[35:02] Oh, many things
[35:06] about tomorrow
[35:09] [Music]
[35:10] I don't seem
[35:14] to understand.
[35:18] But I know
[35:22] who holds tomorrow.
[35:26] And I know
[35:29] who holds my hand.
[35:34] Amen. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.

[37:14] Oh, blessed be the Lord
[37:18] God
[37:20] Almighty
[37:23] who was and is and is to come.
[37:30] Blessed be the Lord

[39:33] praise to the king.
[39:36] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[39:41] roar at the sound
[39:45] of your name.
[39:50] I sing for joy at the works of your
[39:55] hands.
[39:57] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[40:02] I'll stand.
[40:05] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[40:11] in you.

[45:42] of Parkinson's. So, we want to pray for
[45:44] her this morning for a touch for the
[45:46] Lord. Also, please pray for Katie Alder.

[45:51] has a broken back and hip and internal
[45:53] bleeding. Just want to remember her this

[51:28] And thanks for that special night
[51:34] when I saw your glorious life.
[51:39] Came face to face with eternal life. And
[51:44] Lord, I thank you.
[51:51] Amen. Let's stand down this morning and
[51:53] we're going to turn it over to brother
[51:54] Ber and we invited to come. Let's sing.
[51:56] I'm amazed that you love me.
[51:59] Oh, I'm amazed
[52:02] [Music]
[52:04] that you love me.
[52:09] Oh, I'm amazed
[52:13] at how you care.
[52:17] Through your preious
[52:20] blood, I found pardon.
[52:26] And my sins
[52:28] are washed.
[52:31] They're all washed away. All my sins
[52:37] are washed
[52:39] away.
[52:40] Bless you. You are amazed
[52:46] that you love me.
[52:50] Amaz.
[52:52] [Music]
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:58] [Music]
[53:02] I found found love
[53:07] and my sins
[53:09] are washed.
[53:12] All washed away.
[53:16] my sins
[53:17] are washed
[53:20] away.
[53:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning,
[53:25] Lord Jesus. We want to thank you, Lord,
[53:28] for that wonderful song that we can sing
[53:30] from the bottom of our heart, Lord,
[53:32] knowing, Lord Jesus, that all of our
[53:34] sins are washed away, Father. and to see
[53:37] of your forgetfulness, Lord, by the
[53:39] blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. That died
[53:42] for us on Calvary, Lord Jesus, purchased
[53:45] our salvation, Father, and made a way
[53:47] back for us to be able to come back and
[53:49] have fellowship with you once again,
[53:51] Lord. Father, we ask God once again that
[53:54] you would just take complete control of
[53:55] the service this morning. Have your way
[53:58] and say what you want to say, Father.
[54:00] Lord, get me out of the way, Lord Jesus,
[54:02] just so that you can have your way,
[54:03] Lord. And now, Lord, I pray God that
[54:06] you'll bless each one that has come here
[54:07] this morning, Lord. Father, has open
[54:10] hearts and open ears to hear what you
[54:12] would have to say to them this morning.
[54:14] We commit this service, Lord, to you now
[54:16] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and
[54:18] amen. Good morning.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[54:22] Lord this morning. Amen. Thank you,
[54:25] musicians. Appreciate the music this
[54:26] morning. Let's just turn our Bibles
[54:28] right away this morning. We'll just get
[54:30] into the word of God. Amen. We want to
[54:32] take an little thought off of something
[54:35] we mentioned. Amen. Briefly basically I
[54:38] think Wednesday. Amen. And so I want to
[54:42] just kind of continue on that or pull
[54:44] off of that thought if you will. So turn
[54:47] if you will to First Corinthians.
[54:50] We got a good signal. Okay. Good. Amen.
[54:55] God bless you. Amen. Sister Mary and
[54:58] Sister Riley. God bless y'all. Good to
[55:00] have you all this this morning. Amen.
[55:02] Praise the Lord.
[55:04] Amen. The rest of us pretty much home
[55:06] folks, I think. And so, we've got
[55:08] several out. Amen. So, Amen. That mean
[55:13] when there's a lot of people missing,
[55:15] you know what that means, don't you?
[55:17] Amen. We got to push the wagon. That
[55:19] means the ones that are here got to push
[55:21] a little harder. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[55:25] Amen. How many glad to be a Christian?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, we we just
[55:30] we want to look at that this morning.
[55:31] And Amen. with the help of the Lord. All
[55:34] right, let's start, shall we? First
[55:36] Corinthians
[55:38] uh let me see here.
[55:43] 1 Corinthians 3.
[55:52] 1 Corinthians 3
[55:55] and verse 20. Let's go back up just a
[55:58] little bit so we can get a little
[55:59] concept of what Paul was talking about.
[56:02] Verse 18. Let no man deceive himself. If
[56:05] any man among you seem to be wise in
[56:08] this world, let him become a fool that
[56:10] he may be wise. For the wisdom of this
[56:13] world is foolishness with God. For it is
[56:15] written, he taketh the wise in their own
[56:18] craftiness. And again, the Lord knoweth
[56:20] the thoughts of the wise, that they are
[56:22] vain. Therefore, let no man glory in
[56:25] men, for all things are yours, whether
[56:29] Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the world or
[56:32] life or death or things present or
[56:35] things to come. All are yours and ye are
[56:39] Christ and Christ is God's.
[56:43] One more scripture. Turn to
[56:48] second Corinthians. 2 Corinthians 5.
[56:54] No, this is not correct.
[57:00] Second Corinthians 6 is what I got wrote
[57:02] down.
[57:04] 2 Corinthians 6. Yeah, that's right. 2
[57:07] Corinthians 6.
[57:12] And brother Brandham used his scripture
[57:14] when he preached a message called
[57:15] possessing all things by the word of
[57:19] truth, by the power of God. Verse 7.
[57:22] Verse 6 and verse chapter 6 verse 7. By
[57:25] the word of truth, by the power of God,
[57:28] by the armor of righteousness on the
[57:30] right hand and on the left, by honor and
[57:33] dishonor, by evil report and good
[57:36] report. As deceivers and yet true. As
[57:40] unknown and yet well-known. As dying and
[57:43] behold, we live. As chastened and not
[57:46] killed. as sorrowful yet always
[57:50] rejoicing. As poor yet making many rich,
[57:54] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[57:58] things. May God add his blessings to the
[58:00] reading of the word. You can be seated.
[58:04] Amen. Possessing all things. Amen. Uh I
[58:08] believe I titled it all things are
[58:10] yours. All things are yours.
[58:15] And this morning, as I think I mentioned
[58:19] Wednesday, I said that if we was really
[58:22] going to talk about everything that's
[58:24] yours, we could be here for a while.
[58:27] Amen. So, we're going to be here for a
[58:28] little bit this morning. Is that okay?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to look at. And
[58:33] I want to start with a quote that
[58:34] brother Brandon made. He says, "One of
[58:37] the greatest curses, this is in Jehovah
[58:39] Gyra 1955. One of the greatest curses on
[58:43] the full gospel church
[58:47] is
[58:48] not positionally knowing what they are
[58:51] in Christ."
[58:54] &gt;&gt; I've always said I meet two classes of
[58:56] people. One of them is the full gospel
[58:59] and the other is fundamental. the
[59:02] fundamentals knows where he's standing
[59:05] positionally.
[59:06] Only he's never been born again. Now
[59:08] notice this is a key phrase here. Never
[59:11] been born again. In other words, doesn't
[59:13] have the Holy Spirit.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Right? But as far as the word, they've
[59:18] got it right. Fundamentally, they're
[59:21] right, but they don't have the spirit.
[59:24] Amen. So, we've actually got two
[59:27] problems that we want to try to solve
[59:28] this morning with the help of the Lord.
[59:30] Okay.
[59:31] They positionally know where he's
[59:32] standing, but he's never been born
[59:34] again. Just fundamental teaching alone.
[59:36] So, he doesn't have any faith. And the
[59:39] full gospel has been born again. All
[59:42] right. So, here's the born again person,
[59:46] but he doesn't know where he stands.
[59:50] It's just it's uh so it's just if I
[59:53] could ever get the full gospel
[59:55] Pentecostal faith and the fundamental
[59:57] believers or either the fundamental
[59:59] believers doctrine and the Pentecostal
[1:00:02] faith, we'd have it made.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning I want to speak a
[1:00:10] little bit with the help of the Lord
[1:00:11] because you know we seem to be able to
[1:00:13] have faith for salvation.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; But how many knows that it goes so much
[1:00:18] deeper than that?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; There is so much more for us to possess
[1:00:24] much for us to have you know and
[1:00:27] sometimes we really battle we really
[1:00:29] battle with having faith for diabetes.
[1:00:31] We have battle for having faith for
[1:00:33] blood pressure. Amen. A gout on our feet
[1:00:36] or whatever it might be. We, you know,
[1:00:38] it's a struggle.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; So, I hope this morning will help us.
[1:00:46] Amen. Try to try to get a try to get the
[1:00:48] right channel, so to speak. Amen. And
[1:00:51] really be able to get somewhere because,
[1:00:54] you know, there's so many promises there
[1:00:56] and we just we don't want to live
[1:00:57] underprivileged.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; I think we're living in the age. How
[1:01:01] many believe we're living in the age? I
[1:01:02] truly believe that it is time that we
[1:01:06] get to the place that we're supposed to.
[1:01:08] We got to be getting close to the place
[1:01:09] that we're supposed to be.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And I begin to write down of how that uh
[1:01:16] you know
[1:01:19] my let me let me let me uh let me let me
[1:01:22] go back. Let me finish this thought. Is
[1:01:24] that okay? All right. We'll try to pick
[1:01:27] that up with the help of the Lord. So
[1:01:29] that's why we have it made. See, it's
[1:01:32] like a man that can write a check, but
[1:01:35] he hasn't got any money in the bank.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He can write a check, but he don't have
[1:01:43] no money in the bank. He says, and the
[1:01:46] other one, he can't write the check, but
[1:01:49] he's got money in the bank. Amen.
[1:01:52] The man that can't write a check has
[1:01:54] money, but he don't know how to write
[1:01:56] the check.
[1:01:58] That's the way it is. What's he going to
[1:02:00] do? One's got money in the bank, one
[1:02:03] can't write a check. The other one can
[1:02:04] write a check and ain't got no money in
[1:02:06] the What are you going to do? You got to
[1:02:08] get those two together.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; What good do all these promises of God
[1:02:16] do to us?
[1:02:18] If we don't get possession of it,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; if we don't know how to write a check,
[1:02:24] how many believes that we've been given
[1:02:25] a checkbook? How many knows that?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Sure we have. We've all been given a
[1:02:30] checkbook. Anybody that's ever born
[1:02:32] again has been given a checkbook.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:37] That's right. I want to just Amen. Can I
[1:02:40] just read it? Brother Bam says, "The
[1:02:42] trouble with Christians today is they
[1:02:45] don't realize what is provided for them.
[1:02:49] God's provided healing."
[1:02:52] Many people doesn't realize that the
[1:02:55] great glories and powers that's provided
[1:02:58] for them. Amen. He says when you become
[1:03:01] a Christian, walk around find out what
[1:03:04] you own. Find out what's yours.
[1:03:08] See, all things are yours given to you
[1:03:11] freely. Everything that Christ died for
[1:03:14] is yours. Whatever. Amen. Listen.
[1:03:19] Every one of you. Every one of you. And
[1:03:21] you've got a checkbook with Jesus' name
[1:03:23] signed across there and saying,
[1:03:25] "Whatever you send this check to the
[1:03:27] father. Whatever you ask my father's
[1:03:29] name, I will do it."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You're just scared to fill it out. Amen.
[1:03:35] How many know that little doubt that
[1:03:37] comes in our mind? That's our battle.
[1:03:40] Amen. That's where the devil, that's
[1:03:42] where you have to fight for it. You've
[1:03:44] got to overcome that little doubt that
[1:03:47] comes in your mind.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:53] Overcome that little doubt that comes in
[1:03:56] your mind. You got to fight for every
[1:03:57] inch of it if you're going to get it.
[1:04:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:06] Now, let me just write quick
[1:04:10] just in case somebody would be online
[1:04:12] and what are you talking about a
[1:04:14] checkbook and and so forth with Jesus
[1:04:17] name signed on the bottom. Here it is.
[1:04:19] This is the checkbook. Amen. In St. John
[1:04:22] 14:13 says, "And whatsoever ye shall ask
[1:04:26] in my name, that will I do."
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; That the father may be glorified in the
[1:04:33] son, ask anything in my name, and I will
[1:04:38] do it.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's where you and I
[1:04:43] stand? That's our promise.
[1:04:47] Not just a quote, but goes right back to
[1:04:49] the Bible. Shows you where you have the
[1:04:51] right to do so.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; If you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:04:55] you, St. John 15, I believe it is. I'm
[1:04:57] the vine and you are the branches. Amen.
[1:04:59] Ask anything in my name and I'll do it.
[1:05:02] And Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:05:08] That is good. People don't realize
[1:05:12] what's provided.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] Then to write the next quote after he
[1:05:18] says what you sent that check to the
[1:05:20] father don't be afraid. If we have uh he
[1:05:23] says we have no need or lack of
[1:05:26] anything.
[1:05:29] No need or lack or of anything.
[1:05:33] Wow. When I thought about that scripture
[1:05:35] I thought with that quote I thought
[1:05:37] about Ephesians 1 and verse three. Paul
[1:05:40] said, "Blessed be the God and father of
[1:05:43] our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[1:05:45] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:05:50] heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; How many believes he said he has raised
[1:05:56] us up together and has made us to sit
[1:05:58] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:06:01] Jesus?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] Amen.
[1:06:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:12] How many is glad for that?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:17] He's provided us everything. We don't
[1:06:20] have lack of anything. God has provided
[1:06:22] everything that we have need of in this
[1:06:24] journey. I'm going to try to do a little
[1:06:26] teaching this morning. So, y'all just
[1:06:28] settle down. It's provided us right
[1:06:30] here. And although every man that is
[1:06:33] born of the spirit of God, the Lord
[1:06:35] gives him a checkbook. Amen. How many
[1:06:38] believes that's what we want to look at?
[1:06:39] We want to look at what what we have
[1:06:41] because sometimes you might not think
[1:06:43] you have very much. That's why I read
[1:06:45] where Paul says, "Man, we might be poor.
[1:06:47] We're maybe as sorrowful and you know,
[1:06:50] and we might be as poor but yet making
[1:06:52] many rich." But he said he said this
[1:06:55] way. Today the true believer is cast out
[1:06:58] from among the people called a fanatic,
[1:07:00] a holy roller or some kind of insulting
[1:07:02] name, some kind of a religious fa
[1:07:04] fanatic. And yet he is heir to the whole
[1:07:08] heavens and the earth.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:07:11] inherit the earth. Oh my. You talk about
[1:07:13] push you out in the cabin somewhere and
[1:07:16] hardly enough money to pay your rent.
[1:07:19] Yet you own it all.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just thought when I was studying
[1:07:24] here it says you might think you're as
[1:07:26] poor. What are you talking about? I'm
[1:07:28] rich. What are you talking about? I own
[1:07:30] everything. I don't feel like I don't
[1:07:31] own anything, man. I got hard.
[1:07:34] I I'm terribly poor.
[1:07:37] What you need to do if you got the Holy
[1:07:39] Ghost is look a little deeper.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe you got to look a
[1:07:42] little deeper,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; man? Quit looking out there and start
[1:07:46] looking in here.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to do this
[1:07:48] morning. We're going to inspect what's
[1:07:51] down on the inside of this chest here.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; On each one, we're going to inspect,
[1:07:56] find out what's down in there.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. down in that little heart
[1:08:01] and in that little compartment there
[1:08:03] where there's no blood cells or nothing.
[1:08:05] What they call the place of the soul.
[1:08:07] Let's see what in it's inhabited in
[1:08:09] there. How many believes that that's got
[1:08:10] to be inhabited?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; There's Man, don't get me going. There's
[1:08:15] something there.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Makes me holler a little.
[1:08:21] That's right. It makes me feel good. It
[1:08:23] satisfies me. It quenches my thirst.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; It does all these things. makes me shout
[1:08:29] hallelujah.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; It'll take all of eternity for us to
[1:08:33] praise him for what he is
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; and for what he means to us.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just go ahead. I was studying
[1:08:41] down through there. Brother Brand
[1:08:42] processing all things and he talks about
[1:08:44] all these things and at the end he says,
[1:08:46] "And are we worthy of it?" No, we're not
[1:08:47] worthy of it. Amen. But yet, if there
[1:08:50] was a man that was a a drunkard or
[1:08:52] whatever he might be and if his father
[1:08:54] left him a million dollars, it don't
[1:08:55] mean it matter if he's a drunkard or
[1:08:57] whatever he is, he has an inheritance.
[1:08:59] That's his inheritance. And he says the
[1:09:02] way we are, we weren't worthy. God come
[1:09:04] down and cleaned us up. We weren't
[1:09:05] worthy of anything that God did.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all praise. It's not
[1:09:10] because of your worthiness. It's because
[1:09:12] that you are a son and daughter of God.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:19] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:21] You love him this morning.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I've got so much to be thankful for.
[1:09:26] Amen. So much to praise him for. Amen.
[1:09:32] All right,
[1:09:34] let's go on here.
[1:09:36] You might have to work and toil and
[1:09:38] everything else. You might think that
[1:09:39] you are poor, but he says, "But yet
[1:09:43] you're heir of everything that's here.
[1:09:45] The meek shall inherit the earth. They
[1:09:48] possess it. Oh my, I like that.
[1:09:51] Possessor of earth. The believer. Now,
[1:09:55] here's just one thing we want to touch
[1:09:56] on that the believer has. Amen. Because
[1:09:59] I wrote down here, we sometimes don't
[1:10:02] know what we got. I like to go over.
[1:10:04] Let's see what we got here.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] You got an abstract. Brother Bam says,
[1:10:13] "The believer has a title, an abstract
[1:10:15] deed." That's right. By Jesus Christ, he
[1:10:18] shall be possessor of this entire
[1:10:22] universe. That's right. The meek shall
[1:10:24] inherit the earth.
[1:10:26] You say, "Well, brother Brandon, I need
[1:10:28] healing." The promise is yours.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that? That's what
[1:10:34] you possess on the inside of your heart.
[1:10:37] You possess healing.
[1:10:40] You possess salvation. You possess the
[1:10:42] Holy Ghost. If you possess the Holy
[1:10:44] Ghost, then you possess these things.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. You need healing.
[1:10:52] Oh, it ain't going to get easy. It ain't
[1:10:54] You ain't going to get it easy. He says,
[1:10:55] I'm going to tell you that. You're going
[1:10:57] to have to take it away from Satan.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; How many believes that the greatest
[1:11:02] battle that we have is in our mind?
[1:11:04] That's where our battle is. It's that
[1:11:06] doubt.
[1:11:07] Well, somebody else tried it
[1:11:12] and didn't make it. Why are you looking
[1:11:14] at that? I don't care how many tried it
[1:11:17] and didn't make it. That ain't got
[1:11:18] nothing to do with it. Amen. If Satan
[1:11:20] captures your health, you've got a right
[1:11:22] to go to Satan, says, "Give it back.
[1:11:24] Hand it over. I come in the name of the
[1:11:27] Lord." Why? The possessor of heavens and
[1:11:30] earth. Now remember, brother Brandon
[1:11:32] mentioned in the Bible talks about how
[1:11:34] that when Abraham met
[1:11:37] uh Melchzdc, possessor of heavens and
[1:11:41] earth. Now the reason that we can say
[1:11:43] that we're possessors of heaven and
[1:11:45] earth because we're joint hes with him.
[1:11:47] How many believes when you're a child of
[1:11:49] God, you are a joint heir with Christ?
[1:11:58] I wonder, brother Woody, what will
[1:11:59] happen if we ever get all these things
[1:12:01] in our mind the way they're supposed to
[1:12:03] get it in our mind.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. This world would just not mean so
[1:12:07] much anymore.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I believe everybody sitting
[1:12:10] in here, every real true Christian
[1:12:12] doesn't have his eyes on this world and
[1:12:14] on the things of this world. Our eyes is
[1:12:18] on that home. The goal is that home of
[1:12:21] the soul. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? That's right.
[1:12:23] We're all living for that great day that
[1:12:25] lays ahead.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Here we are going 2025. But I'm here to
[1:12:30] tell you, how many's believing that not
[1:12:32] too long from now, we're going to be in
[1:12:34] another place.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; We're going to be somewhere else, folks.
[1:12:36] We're not going to stay here. And we
[1:12:38] need to keep that in our mind,
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; realizing we're not going to be here
[1:12:42] forever. We're going to meet the Lord
[1:12:43] Jesus in the air. Amen. St. John 3, I
[1:12:47] believe it first John 3 talks about,
[1:12:49] behold what manner of love the father
[1:12:51] has bestowed upon us. When he when he
[1:12:52] appears, we're going to be like him.
[1:12:54] We're going to have a body like unto his
[1:12:56] own glorious body. And he that hath this
[1:12:59] hope in himself purifith himself even as
[1:13:02] he is pure.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; I mean that'll that's what helps you to
[1:13:06] live a holy life, live a righteous life
[1:13:08] because you're getting ready to meet
[1:13:10] him.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] All right.
[1:13:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:18] All right. Give it back. Come in the
[1:13:20] name of the Lord. That's right. See, I'm
[1:13:23] his heir. Give it back. You took my
[1:13:25] child, got him mixed up with the wrong
[1:13:27] boy, perhaps or whatever it might be.
[1:13:29] You took my boy and mixed him up with
[1:13:31] the wrong girl. I claimed him. That's
[1:13:32] right. I claimed my children. I claimed
[1:13:34] my brother. I claimed my sister.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; How many believe you can do that? You
[1:13:39] got family members that are not gone
[1:13:41] wayward. You get on your knees and you
[1:13:42] claim them. Say, "God, I claim him." In
[1:13:44] the name of the Lord, it's your right.
[1:13:46] Amen. Praise the Lord. I claimed him.
[1:13:50] But how do you know? He says, I because
[1:13:52] I'm an heir of all things and it's given
[1:13:54] me. Amen. And I can claim everything
[1:13:57] that God promised me. There you are.
[1:14:00] Then he even goes on to talking about
[1:14:02] I'm even an heir to a throne. To him
[1:14:04] that overcomemeth will I sit will sit
[1:14:06] with me in my throne even as I have
[1:14:08] overcame and sit down my father in his
[1:14:10] throne.
[1:14:12] How many feels humbled to know that by
[1:14:14] God's grace you're going to sit with him
[1:14:17] in his throne over on the other side?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can be like that
[1:14:23] black slave. Amen. That walked around
[1:14:24] with his head up. Amen. And and was and
[1:14:27] worked hard and so forth because they
[1:14:30] they couldn't understand why he did that
[1:14:31] way and the way he conducted himself
[1:14:33] that way. It's because back home he they
[1:14:35] found out he was a child of a king.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's the way we want
[1:14:39] to conduct ourselves? Lord, help us to
[1:14:41] conduct ourselves as children of the
[1:14:44] king.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:14:48] Amen.
[1:14:53] Amen. So, the reason for this message
[1:14:56] this morning, the reason that we want to
[1:14:58] look at how that we seem to be able to
[1:15:01] believe for our salvation, but then
[1:15:03] there's other things perhaps that we
[1:15:05] have trouble with. I got wrote down
[1:15:07] here, we have to ask ourselves because
[1:15:10] the one desire that we have is to be
[1:15:12] closer to God. Ain't that right?
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And before you can get closer to God,
[1:15:17] you got have that thirst to be closer to
[1:15:19] God. Ask yourself, are you closer to God
[1:15:22] than what you was last year?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I believe we need to check ourselves,
[1:15:27] search ourselves,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; see if you're closer last year, but I
[1:15:32] don't believe it's just last year, but I
[1:15:34] believe we need to take it to last
[1:15:35] month. How about last month? Are you
[1:15:38] closer to God this this month than you
[1:15:40] was last month?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; How about this week? How about this
[1:15:44] Sunday? Are you closer to God this
[1:15:45] morning than what you was last Sunday?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz how many believes that when
[1:15:52] you become a child of God, when you
[1:15:54] become a son of God, Amen. God gives you
[1:15:56] the best thing that he could give you.
[1:15:58] Amen. And he called it the best tutor
[1:16:01] there is. How many believe you each and
[1:16:03] every one of us and that tutor means
[1:16:05] teacher ain't that right? That tutor is
[1:16:08] the Holy Ghost that he been given you.
[1:16:10] Amen. He goes back to the father don't
[1:16:12] understand it all but he brings a report
[1:16:14] to him. Amen. And that tutor teaches us.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; If I was to ask you what did the Holy
[1:16:22] Spirit teach you last week?
[1:16:26] He did me something. Amen. The last few
[1:16:28] days the Holy Spirit has really taught
[1:16:30] me something. Yeah, me too.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And I thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; But how many believes knows that every
[1:16:37] circumstance that comes you away? You
[1:16:39] need to keep your eyes open.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You need to be aware that the
[1:16:42] circumstances that God allows you to get
[1:16:45] into are for a reason. They are for
[1:16:47] molding you. They are for shaping you.
[1:16:49] It's for getting you ready.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Just as Israel, hello. I believe this
[1:16:56] where I want to go now for a minute or
[1:16:58] two. that tutor. Amen. That God gives a
[1:17:00] real believer. That's what we have.
[1:17:02] Amen. In our hearts. Now, he has given
[1:17:04] us also teachers, amen, a pastor. The
[1:17:08] Bible says he's apt to teach or a pastor
[1:17:10] that teaches or evangelist or Amen. or
[1:17:13] missionary or apostles and prophets.
[1:17:16] First, he give us what? Prophets. Isn't
[1:17:17] that right?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Well, Israel, look at them. They had a
[1:17:21] prophet Moses, right? And they believed
[1:17:22] to Moses. They followed him out of
[1:17:24] Egypt. But how many believe just
[1:17:27] believing in a prophet? Well, that's
[1:17:28] just the beginning.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz they got out there and
[1:17:31] what did God do? He took them down to
[1:17:33] the Red Sea to try to teach them.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He was trying to train them. He was
[1:17:40] trying to teach them. Teach them what?
[1:17:42] Not to rely upon themselves.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; He was trying to test their faith to see
[1:17:49] if they would believe God when they come
[1:17:51] to dead ends in their life.
[1:17:54] How many believe we get the dead ends,
[1:17:56] the doctors can't do anything, nobody
[1:17:58] can do anything and it looks bleak. It
[1:18:01] looks terrible. And then we how you
[1:18:03] react in those times.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you if you haven't been
[1:18:11] there a time or two,
[1:18:14] you're fixing to.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of God, that God is
[1:18:18] going to take you to those places.
[1:18:20] Brother Brandham said that he takes
[1:18:22] every son that he receives to that
[1:18:25] place, that place of chastisement. Amen.
[1:18:27] Even his brother came, brother Brandham
[1:18:29] came to those places different times in
[1:18:31] his life.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what it is, it's just one
[1:18:35] after the other. And then after the Red
[1:18:37] Sea, they didn't pass that test. They
[1:18:39] complained and murmured and said,
[1:18:41] "Didn't you bring us out, you know, out
[1:18:42] here?" There was a couple of them.
[1:18:44] Hallelujah. How many glad for the Joshua
[1:18:46] and the Calebs?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] That's what God does in your life.
[1:18:52] That's what he does in my life. He'll
[1:18:55] allow situations to rise.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; He'll allow the preacher to make you
[1:19:02] mad.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe say something you really don't
[1:19:08] like.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Just to see how you react.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You just be ready to see how you are. I
[1:19:17] don't know about you, but I want to be
[1:19:19] what God wants me to be.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; I want to be mature. I want to be ready
[1:19:23] to leave this place.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz we know that Luther and Wesley and
[1:19:27] Pentecost, God was all progressive. That
[1:19:30] was the maturing.
[1:19:32] I want to say the maturing of the word,
[1:19:34] but the mature, the word never does
[1:19:36] mature.
[1:19:37] Why? It's always the same. It's the
[1:19:40] people that have to come back to the
[1:19:42] maturity of the word.
[1:19:44] We are the ones that have to mature. The
[1:19:46] word doesn't have to get any better.
[1:19:48] It's good as it is.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But we had to mature in Pentecost. Oh,
[1:19:52] they got to have a big old gifts and
[1:19:54] everything. And Luther, all he knew was
[1:19:56] just shall live by faith and all these
[1:19:58] other things. But you know, progress,
[1:20:00] progress, progress. How many believed in
[1:20:02] our age with this message of this hour,
[1:20:05] we've had an example of a son of God
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; that came to adoption? I know those are
[1:20:12] big words, but I believe Brother
[1:20:13] Brandham came to adoption. I believe God
[1:20:15] could trust him with the spoken word.
[1:20:18] Now say what you want to them.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Speak to that storm. Speak to that
[1:20:23] couple. He could give him the power to
[1:20:25] spoken word. I wonder this morning how
[1:20:28] far along we are.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Are we come to that place where God can
[1:20:33] do trust us with that? We still got a
[1:20:36] little hang-ups about this and a little
[1:20:38] hang-ups about that. Amen. We can't be
[1:20:40] in second and third grade. We've got to
[1:20:42] be up here and Amen. get our degree.
[1:20:45] Isn't that right?
[1:20:47] Our college degree. What is that?
[1:20:52] Learn your ABCs.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; A college degree is to learn your ABCs.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:21:02] Not sometimes, not once in a while. Oh,
[1:21:05] I passed it that time, but not this
[1:21:06] time. No. Always
[1:21:08] believe Christ.
[1:21:11] No matter what your situation is,
[1:21:13] believe Christ.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] Praise the Lord. All right.
[1:21:21] Bam says a few years ago, he says they
[1:21:24] didn't know what electricity was. I
[1:21:26] thought, man, look at all the things
[1:21:28] that we didn't know that existed a few
[1:21:30] years ago
[1:21:32] naturally speaking. And how about
[1:21:35] spiritually?
[1:21:36] How many's glad to have lights? I don't
[1:21:39] know about you, but I'm glad to have air
[1:21:41] conditioning. I'm glad that we can warm
[1:21:43] this place and how they figured out how
[1:21:45] to warm this place.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm a whole lot more glad for the
[1:21:49] word that he brought that teaches who
[1:21:51] you are, what you are, where you come
[1:21:53] from, where you're going, how to live.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; How to believe.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got to ain't got to drive a
[1:22:02] horse and buggy you to think that I'm
[1:22:03] going to make it to heaven. Listen to a
[1:22:06] bunch of false preachers that uh you
[1:22:08] know don't even believe the word of God
[1:22:10] or the power of God.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad for that
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; progression? Praise the Lord.
[1:22:18] Think about it now. He says, "But Thomas
[1:22:22] Edison and and you know, listen to this
[1:22:24] Benjamin Franklin Thomas Edison for a
[1:22:26] minute. But he had a hunger in his heart
[1:22:29] to find out what he was." How many knows
[1:22:31] Thomas did? He had a hunger in his
[1:22:33] heart. Let me find out what this
[1:22:35] electricity will do. Let me find out
[1:22:37] what it's going to do. Let me find out
[1:22:39] what it's going to do. But Abraham talks
[1:22:41] about that boy on the bicycle pedal on
[1:22:44] deep calling to the deep. He says before
[1:22:46] there's a deep darer, Amen, there's got
[1:22:48] to be a thirsting for that deep. Before
[1:22:51] a deep can respond, there's got to be a
[1:22:52] hunger for a deep. Amen. This morning,
[1:22:55] evening like tabernacle, there's got to
[1:22:57] be a hunger for you to go further with
[1:22:59] God, deeper in God. If there's ever
[1:23:02] going to be more of God for you to have,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; we can't sit there just happy where we
[1:23:07] are.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, if you haven't
[1:23:09] progressed, if you haven't changed,
[1:23:12] then there's something wrong.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; I like what brother Bam said about that.
[1:23:16] I guess she was colored, but this woman
[1:23:17] told him, he says, you know, I'm not
[1:23:19] what I want to be.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not what I want to be. I'm not what
[1:23:26] I ought to be,
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; man. Y'all some holy angels around here
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; after church. I want to meet with you
[1:23:37] that didn't raise your hand and ask tell
[1:23:39] you how did you do it cuz I want to find
[1:23:41] the wire that you got. No, I know y'all.
[1:23:43] I'm just pulling your leg. Amen. But
[1:23:47] listen, you can't stay in that same
[1:23:49] place that you've been. There has to be
[1:23:52] a growth. There's got to be something
[1:23:53] pulling God. There's, you know, if he if
[1:23:56] God could take our prophet to that
[1:23:58] place, why can't we go there?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Do you realize, Brother John said
[1:24:03] Debbie, you realize, Brother Bam said,
[1:24:05] when that third pool comes in and that
[1:24:07] when that right time comes, you watch
[1:24:09] that third pool, Ben.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I mean, that was not in Brother Bam's
[1:24:13] time. That was talking about down the
[1:24:15] road somewhere.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're we're we're we're
[1:24:20] exercising. God is working on us
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; to have faith in him
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; to have faith in him. Amen. We're fixing
[1:24:30] to get to something here.
[1:24:34] Amen.
[1:24:39] So,
[1:24:41] you know, he says when Franklin caught
[1:24:44] that lightning, he didn't know what he
[1:24:46] had.
[1:24:48] Lord, help us. Lord, help us this
[1:24:50] morning. If I can do anything is just to
[1:24:52] help us a little bit more to realize
[1:24:55] what you got,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; what you have.
[1:25:00] And where is it at? External material
[1:25:03] thing. No, it's right here.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; It's right here.
[1:25:09] Right in your heart.
[1:25:14] I know it's a trick question if I ask
[1:25:15] you, what do you got?
[1:25:18] Because the answer would be, I've got
[1:25:21] everything that I need
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; in this world or in the world to come.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; I mean, know that's the answer. I've got
[1:25:29] everything that I have need of right
[1:25:32] here.
[1:25:36] Brother Bram said, he said, uh, when we
[1:25:39] get those two together is what we need
[1:25:40] to do. And then he says, and if we if we
[1:25:43] could ever get the scare out of the
[1:25:45] people, he said, that's something. Oh, I
[1:25:48] don't know. You're wanting a little
[1:25:50] touch me or a hocus pocus. If I could
[1:25:53] get this preacher to pray for me. If I
[1:25:56] could get that preacher to pray for me.
[1:25:59] Yeah. Remember the one brother that came
[1:26:01] to Brother Bam says, "I went to or
[1:26:02] Roberts. I went to Billy Graham and now
[1:26:04] I've come to you." He says, "Well, you
[1:26:05] ain't going to get no help here either
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; cuz I can't help you. Your faith has to
[1:26:11] be in the right place.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You're putting your confidence in the
[1:26:14] man. You ain't going to get nothing.
[1:26:16] Conf. You've got to trust the Lord.
[1:26:18] Amen. Then he got somewhere. People that
[1:26:21] want to have some kind of something like
[1:26:23] that. Listen to what Brother Bam says.
[1:26:25] He says, "God's word is your basis. God
[1:26:30] said so. That settles it."
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's all you need. You don't
[1:26:34] know chills up your back. You don't need
[1:26:36] somebody to tell you that. need to know
[1:26:38] God's already told you. What you need is
[1:26:40] faith.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; To believe what God said.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's what really
[1:26:49] that's what we need.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; That's the basis. Just laid it out
[1:26:58] there. Perfect.
[1:27:00] That's where we believe it. See? Amen.
[1:27:04] Oh, if I could just do this or if I
[1:27:05] could just do that. It's not what you
[1:27:07] done, it's what God has done for you.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, if I can just keep
[1:27:12] holding on, it ain't you holding on.
[1:27:13] It's whether he held on or not. It ain't
[1:27:16] what I am. It's what he is."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Woo. That ought to make us happy. That
[1:27:22] gives us joy because it's not about you
[1:27:24] at all. It's just simply about believing
[1:27:26] what he done. Oh, if I could live holy
[1:27:29] enough. Oh, the devil points you to your
[1:27:31] faults. Every time you want to believe
[1:27:33] something, he'll point you to your
[1:27:34] fault. Make you believe. Oh, well, I
[1:27:36] felt No, quit thinking that.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; It's already under the blood. Realize
[1:27:41] that the thoughts that come in your mind
[1:27:43] are either of God or they're of the
[1:27:45] devil.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; My
[1:27:54] praise the Lord. Amen. Get the scare out
[1:27:57] of people. Get the fear out of people.
[1:28:00] Amen.
[1:28:02] I'm going to go ahead and stop here, but
[1:28:04] I wanted to go into some of these other
[1:28:06] things, but talking about the fruit of
[1:28:08] the spirit, how that the fruit of the
[1:28:10] spirit is the life of God. How many
[1:28:13] believes that?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fruit that comes from that
[1:28:16] spirit is the essence of God. Amen. And
[1:28:20] one of those things is love. Is that
[1:28:23] right? Now fear or scares the people.
[1:28:28] Fear has no virtue at all. Does it? The
[1:28:31] Bible says he that fearth is not made
[1:28:33] perfect in love. Cuz perfect love casts
[1:28:37] out fear.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're not supposed to
[1:28:41] be scared of anything?
[1:28:44] Why are you not scared of anything?
[1:28:46] Because if it's the perfect love of God
[1:28:48] in your heart, because it's the perfect
[1:28:50] Holy Ghost in your heart, God ain't
[1:28:53] scared of anything. There's nothing that
[1:28:57] scares God. It didn't scare Paul. It
[1:28:59] didn't scare FF Borth. It didn't scare
[1:29:01] Paul Raider.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Hello. Not even death.
[1:29:06] Amen.
[1:29:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:12] All right.
[1:29:16] See, listen. Then God takes the faith of
[1:29:18] Abraham and places it in the believer by
[1:29:21] the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows what the faith of
[1:29:24] Abraham is? The faith of Abraham ain't
[1:29:26] the faith of Abraham.
[1:29:29] [Laughter]
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's the faith that Abraham
[1:29:34] got from God and that he had in God.
[1:29:36] That's the faith that God recognized,
[1:29:38] his own faith, a revelation.
[1:29:42] But he made them the father of their
[1:29:44] faith because he was the first one.
[1:29:46] Ain't that right? One that he called
[1:29:47] out. He believed God and he counted
[1:29:50] things that were not as though they
[1:29:52] were.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I hope that we've all learned that
[1:30:00] whenever you have a something come up or
[1:30:02] whatever, not to say negative things
[1:30:04] about it.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got this and I got that. Woo! You
[1:30:09] just signed off.
[1:30:11] You might say, "The devil's trying to
[1:30:12] put this on me. The devil's trying to
[1:30:14] put that on me, but I rebuke him in the
[1:30:16] name of Jesus."
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:24] Amen. I've had something in my foot
[1:30:29] the last three months. Been hurting,
[1:30:31] hurting, hurting, hurting. Caleb says
[1:30:33] it's gout.
[1:30:35] You know, I've been eating too much
[1:30:37] meat. I guess too much of that
[1:30:40] hamburger, that good beef we
[1:30:41] slaughtered. I don't know what it is,
[1:30:44] but I've been believing and believing
[1:30:46] and believing and saying, "God, I
[1:30:48] believe that by your stripes I'm
[1:30:49] healed."
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I woke up this morning.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; I don't feel a thing.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I feel good.
[1:30:58] Amen. Just hold on. Claim the word.
[1:31:01] Says, confess it, and go on.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how much I can jump
[1:31:06] on one foot. It don't hurt. It's just
[1:31:07] feeling good this morning.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care what how many believes
[1:31:11] whatever it is.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever your ailment is.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Believe God. He is your healer. You
[1:31:19] ain't got to come up here and be prayed
[1:31:20] for.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; I'll gladly lay my hands on if that'll
[1:31:24] help your faith. Ain't that right?
[1:31:27] There's nothing wrong with that. They
[1:31:28] shall lay hands on the sick, but they
[1:31:30] shall recover. But brother Bannon had
[1:31:31] him come up there and says, "Now have
[1:31:33] faith." Oh, I got perfect faith. Well,
[1:31:35] then what you doing up here?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said?
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then what are you doing up here?
[1:31:41] If you got perfect faith, you should
[1:31:43] have got it right there and you're
[1:31:44] saved. You should accept it when you
[1:31:46] heard the word of God.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; But your faith is weak perhaps and you
[1:31:50] need a little boost.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:54] So it works both ways. Why? Because he
[1:31:57] did say they'll lay hands on the sick
[1:31:58] and they'll recover. That's the word of
[1:31:59] God.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; But if you have higher faith, Amen. You
[1:32:04] don't have to leave your seat.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] Are y'all ready for some good stuff?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Here we go. Thank you, son.
[1:32:17] Now, notice. So, he placed it in every
[1:32:19] believer by the Holy Ghost. You get it?
[1:32:21] Then you begin to believe all things.
[1:32:24] Hope all things. How many believes that?
[1:32:26] That's right. And that's when the gospel
[1:32:29] really goes to work in the heart. It's
[1:32:32] not no nothing, no great. I think people
[1:32:34] make it too complicated by giving some
[1:32:36] great big lectures, big long words. What
[1:32:40] does that do for the common class of
[1:32:42] people about them great big words? What
[1:32:44] would I know about them? Nothing. No
[1:32:46] sir, I just like to see it just really
[1:32:50] in its simplicity. Yet, it's the most
[1:32:53] powerful thing that the world has ever
[1:32:55] known.
[1:32:57] How many believes is the gospel of Jesus
[1:32:59] Christ accepted on the basis of the shed
[1:33:02] blood of Jesus Christ? Come and believe
[1:33:04] him. The whole thing, that whole thing
[1:33:06] is right there.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:17] Amen.
[1:33:21] Amen. And I ain't never went back and
[1:33:22] forth so much in my notes before, but
[1:33:25] we're trying to do a good job as best we
[1:33:28] can. Is that okay?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] Just the simplicity of it. Listen to
[1:33:36] what brother Bram says here. He says,
[1:33:38] "Here is a house and the worshipper,
[1:33:40] what was the requirements? Lay a lamb
[1:33:43] and so forth. Take the blood and take
[1:33:45] hissup and apply it on the post and the
[1:33:47] linel of the door." And by the way, that
[1:33:50] hissup was just common weeds. Hisup
[1:33:52] means your faith.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody tries to have supernatural
[1:33:56] faith. That's the reason you miss your
[1:33:58] healing. Just he said faith is just a
[1:34:01] common thing. You got faith to come to
[1:34:03] church.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You had faith to come to church. You got
[1:34:09] faith to walk out there. You got faith
[1:34:11] to start your car. I don't know about
[1:34:12] you, but when I get in my truck and I
[1:34:14] stick that key in and I turn it, I I
[1:34:16] don't say, "Oh, man. And I don't I don't
[1:34:19] know if it's going to do it or not. Oh,
[1:34:22] I I don't dare turn it. I just don't
[1:34:24] know for sure if it's going to work.
[1:34:27] How many does that?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Well, can you imagine it probably not
[1:34:32] work because of your lack of faith? Who
[1:34:35] knows, you know? But no, you go over
[1:34:36] there and you just start it. And that's
[1:34:37] what brother Bam said. Just the God's
[1:34:40] word said it. I believe it. That settles
[1:34:42] it.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we try to have something
[1:34:46] supernatural. Well, you know, brother
[1:34:48] Bam say it's just regular common ism.
[1:34:51] You got faith to eat your dinner. That's
[1:34:53] the way it is. Just common faith. Apply
[1:34:56] the blood was applied with hip, which is
[1:34:58] a common weeds that grows anywhere in
[1:35:01] Palestine.
[1:35:02] Amen.
[1:35:05] Oh my. Now, there's a quote I'm looking
[1:35:08] for. Just give me a second here. Let's
[1:35:10] go back and uh
[1:35:13] let's go back to Thomas Edison.
[1:35:17] and so forth. Now, Franklin didn't know
[1:35:20] what he had. All right? He said, "I got
[1:35:23] it. I got it." He knew there had been a
[1:35:25] resurrection. He knew there was
[1:35:26] something there, but he didn't know what
[1:35:28] it was. Now, notice, he says, "Friend,
[1:35:32] one day, say for instance, the electric
[1:35:34] lights. There was time when man would
[1:35:36] thought, boy, if they told somebody 500
[1:35:39] years ago that they'd have electric like
[1:35:41] that, that person would have said, "That
[1:35:43] person's crazy." But there was a man one
[1:35:45] time down in his heart believed that
[1:35:46] there would. Amen. And talking about
[1:35:48] Benjamin from Franklin first he had that
[1:35:50] kite and so forth, you know, and he says
[1:35:53] he screamed, "I got it. I got it." But
[1:35:55] he didn't know what he had. He says,
[1:35:57] "That's what's the church. The matter
[1:36:00] with the church today, they got
[1:36:02] something, but they don't know what they
[1:36:03] got." Amen. And now, as long as he had
[1:36:06] it, he could rejoice. Amen. He could
[1:36:09] feel it. Benjamin Franklin could feel
[1:36:11] it. But he didn't do nothing with it.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought that was a good lesson.
[1:36:18] What good is it if we never do anything
[1:36:21] with it?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; How many know the Bible tells us that we
[1:36:25] ought to ask for great things? Brother
[1:36:26] Abraham says, "Ask for big things."
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you this right now. I
[1:36:34] mean, to ask God to conform you into the
[1:36:36] very image of his son to get you ready
[1:36:38] for the rapture. That's a big request.
[1:36:42] Can I warn you? If you really mean that
[1:36:45] in your heart and raise your hand,
[1:36:46] that's my request.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Be ready next week.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; God answers prayer.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Be ready next week. I a couple weeks
[1:36:54] ago, I prayed a certain prayer. Amen.
[1:36:56] And certain things happened to me here
[1:36:57] in the last few days that I just knew
[1:36:59] that was the answer. God was answering
[1:37:00] my request.
[1:37:03] God will answer your prayer. It may not
[1:37:05] be h may not be convenient for you. It
[1:37:08] may not be. You may not enjoy it, so to
[1:37:10] speak. I thought it's pretty crazy, Wy,
[1:37:13] isn't it? To have trials and tribulation
[1:37:15] and enjoy it. What in the world? I don't
[1:37:18] know about you, but I don't enjoy that.
[1:37:20] But yet Paul says, you know, the my
[1:37:23] trials and my tribulation. I take
[1:37:25] pleasure in my infirmities. If I'm going
[1:37:27] to brag about something, I'm going to
[1:37:28] tell you, Amen. How I got shipwrecked,
[1:37:30] how they stoned me, and how they beat me
[1:37:32] after death.
[1:37:34] For when I am weak, then is he strong.
[1:37:36] Anybody believes that? And that's the
[1:37:38] joy of it. Not the suffering. That's not
[1:37:41] the joy of it. But the joy of it is to
[1:37:43] know that God is your deliverer. How
[1:37:45] many believe that?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; He is your healer.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; He is the one that takes you through.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; The Israelites, they didn't have no,
[1:37:54] they weren't over on this side of the
[1:37:56] Red Sea rejoicing. No, they were
[1:37:59] sorrowful. They were sitting around
[1:38:00] their camps with the wy wy woo blues.
[1:38:03] They were complaining. Oh man, we're
[1:38:05] going to get it now. This that or the
[1:38:06] other. But it wasn't until the sea
[1:38:08] opened. God, come on to say
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; when they got to the other side, Miriam
[1:38:12] and all the sisters, they got the
[1:38:14] tambourine and began to dance up and
[1:38:16] down the floor. Amen.
[1:38:18] Harder the battle, the sweeter the
[1:38:20] victory.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Let this age try to choke
[1:38:27] out your Holy Ghost. Try to drown you
[1:38:29] out. Try to make you lo lukewarm. Guess
[1:38:32] what? You press through that and say, "I
[1:38:33] refuse to be lukewarm, mediocre about
[1:38:36] church or anything else. I don't care if
[1:38:38] it's just a half a crowd. I don't care
[1:38:40] if there ain't no amen. I'm going to
[1:38:41] praise you, God. I'm going to be hot for
[1:38:44] God."
[1:38:46] Hallelujah. The harder the battle, the
[1:38:48] sweeter the victory.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:55] All right.
[1:38:58] I still haven't found the quote that I'm
[1:39:00] looking for. Amen.
[1:39:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:09] God is good, isn't he? I don't guess I
[1:39:11] got another one. I guess that's it.
[1:39:13] Amen. All right.
[1:39:19] That's what's the matter with the
[1:39:20] church. They got something, but they
[1:39:22] don't know it. He didn't know it. He
[1:39:23] didn't do anything with it. But when
[1:39:26] Thomas Edison come along, what did he
[1:39:28] do?
[1:39:29] He searched diligently for tireless
[1:39:32] hours. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:39:37] To try to find out
[1:39:40] what he could do.
[1:39:42] Amen.
[1:39:45] And didn't the Bible say that
[1:39:49] if you seek God diligently
[1:39:52] without faith, it is impossible to
[1:39:54] please God. For they that come to him
[1:39:56] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:39:58] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:40:02] him. Lord Jesus, how many times we get
[1:40:05] in our prayer closet and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:40:06] seeking your face." Go sometime and
[1:40:09] look, go in your and do a search quote
[1:40:12] quote search on on seeking God's face.
[1:40:16] Amen.
[1:40:18] But they that seek him diligently shall
[1:40:20] find him. Amen.
[1:40:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:26] shall find him. That's how we
[1:40:30] That's how I feel.
[1:40:32] You know what I'm looking for?
[1:40:36] You know what I'm looking for?
[1:40:39] Oh, I've been like Terry Titwell sang.
[1:40:41] I've been listening for a different
[1:40:43] sound. Is that right? I'm looking for a
[1:40:47] body change.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for a place to cross.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. looking where the rapture is going
[1:40:54] to take place. Not looking to die.
[1:40:57] Anybody looking to die? No. I hope we're
[1:41:00] all looking to go in the rapture this
[1:41:02] morning.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if there's a deep calling, if
[1:41:07] there's a thirst there, there has to be
[1:41:09] a amen
[1:41:12] to quench that thirst. Brother Bam says
[1:41:14] a very simple basic theology or or
[1:41:17] thought so to speak. Before there was uh
[1:41:20] a fin on a fish's back, there had to be
[1:41:23] water for him to swim in. Swim in.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm longing
[1:41:27] and thirsting for more of God. How many
[1:41:29] is with me? I'm thirsting for more of
[1:41:32] God.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; More of you. More of you. I've had it
[1:41:37] all, but what I need is more of you.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Let's look at a couple more things. I'm
[1:41:43] just going to I'm just going to uh uh
[1:41:46] paraphrase what I heard. He says, you
[1:41:47] know, he said, he said, there's enough
[1:41:50] God in here right now. He said, to heal
[1:41:52] everybody.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; There's enough God in here, you know,
[1:41:56] just like electricity. They just had to
[1:41:58] find a way to channel it.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; All he had to do is find a way to
[1:42:02] channel that power. How many believe
[1:42:05] that's what you and I got to do is we
[1:42:06] got to find that way. Amen. To channel
[1:42:10] the power. I know I've got that thing
[1:42:11] somewhere, but
[1:42:13] I don't.
[1:42:18] Let me look a little harder. All right.
[1:42:24] Nope. I just don't see it. The channel
[1:42:27] that power and he makes a statement. He
[1:42:28] makes the quotation that love and faith
[1:42:32] is the wire. He talked about that
[1:42:34] channel that it takes love and faith.
[1:42:40] How many knows that love is the most
[1:42:42] powerful force there is? Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Me and my wife, we on the way to church,
[1:42:46] we were thinking about how the love of
[1:42:48] God, how rich and how deep it really is.
[1:42:50] How how how much God really loved the
[1:42:53] world.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. How much God loves you. Amen.
[1:42:59] And whenever you possess that Holy
[1:43:02] Ghost, what's on the inside? How many
[1:43:03] believes that you possess the love of
[1:43:06] God?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] Turn with me if you will to Galatians.
[1:43:14] We'll go into a little bit different
[1:43:17] direction, but we do want to look at
[1:43:18] what is ours. Amen. And what we possess,
[1:43:23] what we really have. What do we really
[1:43:26] have?
[1:43:30] If you've got God's spirit,
[1:43:34] then chapter 5 of Galatians, verse 22,
[1:43:38] begins like this.
[1:43:40] But the fruit of the spirit is love.
[1:43:45] Amen. How many believes that's
[1:43:48] the first thing that Paul says is love.
[1:43:52] First John 3 says, "If any man love not
[1:43:54] his brother, then he is not of God." If
[1:43:56] anybody say that he loves God and hates
[1:43:58] his brother, he is a liar. For God is
[1:44:01] love. I mean, God is love.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] I'm going to stop there before I read
[1:44:08] the rest of it and we're going to go to
[1:44:10] 1 Corinthians 13.
[1:44:13] Paul said, "Though I speak with tongues
[1:44:15] of men and angels and have not charity
[1:44:17] or love, I'm become a sounding brass or
[1:44:20] a tingling symbol."
[1:44:22] Amen. Wednesday, we was talking about
[1:44:25] how we enjoy things. Isn't that right?
[1:44:27] We enjoy it. It's a pleasure. Be the
[1:44:31] real joy of God is a pleasure to us. We
[1:44:33] enjoy having the joy of the Lord.
[1:44:36] Because that joy itself, it's not just
[1:44:38] some happiness that by passes by, but
[1:44:41] but it's deep. But since then, I
[1:44:42] thought, you know, the real thing, the
[1:44:44] other real thing that we have is not
[1:44:46] just joy, not just the peace that God
[1:44:48] gives, but we've got the very love of
[1:44:49] God. What makes us come to church? What
[1:44:52] makes us do the right thing is the love
[1:44:54] that you have for God.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; The love is that driving force. I mean,
[1:44:59] believes it. It's the driving force.
[1:45:02] Love is though I have the gift of
[1:45:04] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[1:45:06] and all knowledge and though I have all
[1:45:08] faith so that I could remove mountains
[1:45:10] have not charity I am nothing.
[1:45:15] Amen. Um
[1:45:20] I believe one scripture says something
[1:45:22] about the love of God that is shed
[1:45:24] abroad in our hearts.
[1:45:32] What's in you? What's in that chest of
[1:45:35] yours? What's in that heart of yours?
[1:45:38] I'll tell you what's in your heart.
[1:45:42] Paul said it this way in Colossians.
[1:45:47] It that it's the mystery that's been hid
[1:45:50] from ages and generation.
[1:45:53] Whereof I am made a minister. Colossians
[1:45:55] 1:25. according to the dispensation of
[1:45:58] God which is given to me to you word to
[1:46:01] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[1:46:03] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:46:06] generations but now is made manifest to
[1:46:08] his saints to whom God would make known
[1:46:12] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:46:14] mystery
[1:46:16] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:46:20] you. Amen. The hope of glory.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; How many believe brother preached Christ
[1:46:25] is the mystery? He talks about God in
[1:46:27] you. It's the mystery of the whole thing
[1:46:30] is that God will take
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; people like you,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; people like me, common people, nobodies,
[1:46:38] downcast,
[1:46:39] prophet followers,
[1:46:41] during a cult,
[1:46:43] all kinds of stuff like that. And yet
[1:46:45] God veils himself and hides himself in
[1:46:49] your heart. How many believes that's
[1:46:50] what it's really all about?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; That's really, you know, Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; People ask, "Well, when Jesus prayed to
[1:46:59] the father, they said there had to be
[1:47:01] another one somewhere. The father had to
[1:47:04] be up there."
[1:47:06] But you know what brother Bam said? He
[1:47:08] says when Jesus prayed, he prayed to the
[1:47:11] spirit that was on the inside of him.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we reach out there.
[1:47:18] Folks, when you pray, talk to him right
[1:47:21] here. He's not that far away.
[1:47:23] It's Christ in you. The greatest thing
[1:47:26] that we possess is that Holy Spirit on
[1:47:28] the inside of our hearts. Don't you
[1:47:30] agree
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; that no matter where you go, you always
[1:47:34] got that love. You always got that joy.
[1:47:37] Because that joy is the second thing I
[1:47:38] believe he pushed. He said,
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; the very essence of God, let's
[1:47:45] comprehend it now. The very faith of
[1:47:49] God.
[1:47:52] But the fruit of the spirit is love.
[1:47:55] It's joy.
[1:47:57] It's peace.
[1:48:00] So when God was by himself, wasn't even
[1:48:02] a
[1:48:04] angel, wasn't no star, was nothing. He
[1:48:07] was by himself. How many believes that
[1:48:11] in him was this love?
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; He was this joy.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; He was this peace.
[1:48:19] He was this longsuffering.
[1:48:22] He was gentleness.
[1:48:25] He was goodness.
[1:48:27] He was faith.
[1:48:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Let it be known to people listening out
[1:48:37] there, to everybody here, that if you
[1:48:40] have genuine faith that you possess in
[1:48:44] your heart, the very faith that when God
[1:48:48] said, "Let there be." And there was.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's not off there in Genesis anymore.
[1:48:55] That's in your heart now. Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] Brother Ben, one place he says, you
[1:49:02] know, get God in your heart one time and
[1:49:04] it's not so hard to believe him.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if you get God in
[1:49:09] your heart, it's impossible for you to
[1:49:12] say, "Well, this word isn't inspired or
[1:49:16] we don't believe that."
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can't say that.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost wrote the word. The Holy
[1:49:25] Ghost is the word.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll punctuate every word of
[1:49:30] God with a amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost will do.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; How many believe you ought to have
[1:49:42] plenty of amens in the church?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:46] Amen. So, the very essence of joy,
[1:49:49] longsuffering.
[1:49:51] Amen.
[1:49:53] Oh my.
[1:49:55] My my my my. Aren't you glad to have
[1:49:58] that love,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; that joy, that peace? Like I said, when
[1:50:02] he was by himself, he had peace in his
[1:50:05] heart. He was peace.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Now you get to enjoy that peace.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; My peace I give you. Not as the world
[1:50:13] giveth give I unto you.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? But
[1:50:19] how many really enjoys his peace?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; The same way with joy. He says he said
[1:50:24] that your joy might be full.
[1:50:28] Then longsuffering. Some of these things
[1:50:30] longsuffering.
[1:50:33] You want to be short with a family
[1:50:35] member. You want to be short with your
[1:50:37] workers or you want to be short with
[1:50:39] somebody just get away from the Holy
[1:50:41] Ghost a little bit. You'll become
[1:50:43] irritable, snappy.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Short.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Very short.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Short fused.
[1:50:55] But God has a long fuse.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; God is longsuffering.
[1:51:01] When brother Brandham was preaching on
[1:51:02] this, the statue of a perfect man, he
[1:51:05] says longsuffering.
[1:51:07] I believe he's either under
[1:51:08] longsuffering or patience. But I think
[1:51:10] it was longsuffering. He says, you know,
[1:51:12] he's been preaching at the tabernacle
[1:51:13] for 30 years and people still cut their
[1:51:15] hair, people still do this. He says,
[1:51:17] we're longsuffering. God, the Holy
[1:51:19] Spirit is longsuffering.
[1:51:21] Amen.
[1:51:24] Amen.
[1:51:28] Amen. I'm going to
[1:51:31] once again jump around a little bit.
[1:51:36] But I got wrote down here. Look at where
[1:51:40] you come from. Amen. And imagine where
[1:51:43] you will be. And look at yourself of
[1:51:45] where you are. Look at where you've come
[1:51:47] from. Amen.
[1:51:50] How many's thankful to be able to say,
[1:51:52] "I'm not what I used to be."
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not what I used to be.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just that's the one thing she
[1:52:00] would I guess I left that off last time,
[1:52:02] didn't I?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not what I used to be. And
[1:52:06] I thank God because used to be
[1:52:08] everything, every little thing people
[1:52:10] would do irritated me,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; got me upset, caused me to lose sleep at
[1:52:16] night. Amen.
[1:52:18] things that people did. Perhaps people
[1:52:21] have bitterness, might have bitterness
[1:52:23] for a while, but you know, as a mature
[1:52:26] Christian, you can say, "I don't have
[1:52:27] bitterness anymore."
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; I realize people's going to make
[1:52:31] mistakes. I realize brother B is going
[1:52:33] to say things that I don't like
[1:52:34] sometimes. I realize you're going to say
[1:52:36] things I don't like sometimes. But I
[1:52:39] know the good thing about it is I know
[1:52:40] your heart. How many believe we all know
[1:52:42] each other's heart here?
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; And it's important. And I'm very
[1:52:48] thankful that we love one another. How
[1:52:50] many believes that? I'm thankful this
[1:52:52] morning that this church is not what it
[1:52:54] used to be.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I don't have to come up here and just
[1:52:58] preach correction.
[1:53:00] Now y'all quit your gossiping.
[1:53:03] Amen. Quit sewing divisions.
[1:53:06] Quit being discontent.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; We're not so discontent anymore. Nothing
[1:53:11] makes us happy and all of that.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. How many believe we've
[1:53:16] we've changed?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Us as individuals, we've grown up.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; It's time to come to maturity.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] Amen. And not be like Israel was every
[1:53:28] time that God tested him, tried them
[1:53:31] with hunger, with thirst. Ain't that
[1:53:34] right, boy? You want to get somebody?
[1:53:39] Well, I started paying my tithes. And
[1:53:41] I'm here to tell you, I ain't never been
[1:53:43] so broke.
[1:53:45] I can't barely do this. Huh?
[1:53:49] God's testing you. See if you really
[1:53:51] believe it or not.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll eat peanut butter and jelly
[1:53:55] then this week. I'm going to do what God
[1:53:57] said do.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Then you watch.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says if you want to prove
[1:54:04] God on anything, prove him on that. I
[1:54:06] guarantee you he'll up to open up the
[1:54:08] windows of heaven and pour you out a
[1:54:10] blessing or his word ain't right.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "You prove him on it."
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. How many believes it?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not a bunch of tattletales
[1:54:24] anymore. Not a bunch of gossipers
[1:54:26] anymore.
[1:54:28] Now,
[1:54:31] don't have that friction.
[1:54:34] I trust there's no friction. Live
[1:54:36] peaceibly among all men as much as lith
[1:54:39] in you. How many believes that's the way
[1:54:40] we ought to do?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Boy, I'll tell you, I I don't know why
[1:54:44] I'm saying this, but I'm going to say
[1:54:45] it. Comes to mind. He says, you know, if
[1:54:47] you really want to grieve the Holy
[1:54:49] Spirit, get a bunch of gossip going on
[1:54:51] in the church. Get a bunch of discontent
[1:54:53] and the Holy Ghost will take its flight.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; We've seen it. Is that right? Just take
[1:54:57] it's gone.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; It won't do any of that. It's meek. It's
[1:55:01] gentle. It's easy to be entreated. It's
[1:55:03] patient. It's long-suffering.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; It's gentle. Right.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, help me.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Help all of us men to be a little more
[1:55:12] gentle, more sensitive. Ain't that
[1:55:15] right? Goodness, faith, and meekness,
[1:55:19] temperance. Against such there is no
[1:55:22] law. And they that are Christ have
[1:55:24] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:55:28] and lusts. And if we live in the spirit,
[1:55:31] let us also walk in the spirit. Amen.
[1:55:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:38] In closing, let's look at just a couple
[1:55:41] things. How many believes that this is
[1:55:42] all things? All things are yours. All of
[1:55:46] this is yours.
[1:55:50] If you don't have gentleness like you
[1:55:52] should, watch out. Ask God for it.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; He'll bring it about to where you have
[1:55:58] more gentleness, you have more meekness,
[1:56:00] you more have more patience,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; you have more longsuffering.
[1:56:05] It's all the life of God.
[1:56:08] and faith to believe that whatever you
[1:56:10] have need of you can ask and it shall be
[1:56:15] given to you. Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:25] How many's thankful
[1:56:28] for the Holy Spirit
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; in your own personal life? Amen.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus,
[1:56:37] that you would come down
[1:56:40] an unworthy person
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; like myself, like all of us. Unworthy.
[1:56:46] We didn't deserve it.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You know how many people out there are
[1:56:51] miserable?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; They don't possess what you possess.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:02] And that is God himself.
[1:57:06] I may look at you, Brother Josh. I may
[1:57:08] look at Brother John, Sister Alicia. I
[1:57:10] may look at all of you and I see your
[1:57:13] faces. But I'm here to tell you, down on
[1:57:15] the inside of that,
[1:57:17] there's deity.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; There's God himself. And I think every
[1:57:22] one of us needs to be sensitive to that
[1:57:24] on a daily basis and say, "Lord, help me
[1:57:26] to be sensitive to that. Let me be led
[1:57:29] by that." If I would say anything in
[1:57:31] closing is let the Holy Spirit teach
[1:57:35] you. Amen. How many believes that the
[1:57:38] Holy Spirit wants to teach us? He wants
[1:57:40] to make us bring us to that place to
[1:57:43] where we can have more love, have more
[1:57:45] faith.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:48] To where it's the channel. It's the
[1:57:50] avenue because ultimately ultimately
[1:57:53] love brings faith. Ain't that right?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Love brings faith. It causes you to have
[1:58:00] faith.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; And so love is the first thing. And love
[1:58:03] God with all of your heart, mind, soul,
[1:58:06] and strength. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:58:09] this morning.
[1:58:17] That's my heart's desire for a closer
[1:58:20] walk with the Lord
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; and that he would have complete control
[1:58:24] of my life. Amen.
[1:58:30] Do you hear that? Complete. How many is
[1:58:32] with me? Complete.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether no matter where I am, no
[1:58:36] matter what I'm doing, let's bow our
[1:58:38] heads. Lord Jesus,
[1:58:42] this morning, our hearts are bowed to
[1:58:43] you, Lord. We're hungering and thirsting
[1:58:47] to see you in the air. This world,
[1:58:50] Father, as we see our nation divided,
[1:58:55] can't even be happy with the majority of
[1:58:59] the people that voted in and man,
[1:59:02] but have to go out and protest.
[1:59:06] Unhappy, unsatisfied.
[1:59:08] We feel for them.
[1:59:11] They're our brothers, so to speak, as
[1:59:13] Americans, but yet they are blind, and
[1:59:16] they don't know where true satisfaction
[1:59:18] comes from. Our forefathers did.
[1:59:21] Benjamin Franklin,
[1:59:23] Abraham Lincoln, George Washington. They
[1:59:25] knew you. They knew where their real
[1:59:28] strength comes from. But here we see
[1:59:30] what Satan has done and where we're
[1:59:32] going. Lord, our hearts are crying out
[1:59:34] for people, for souls, because it's the
[1:59:36] love of God that sheds abroad in our
[1:59:38] hearts. And we're not willing that any
[1:59:40] should perish, but that all would come
[1:59:41] to eternal life. Lord, help us to be a
[1:59:44] light to those around us, Lord Jesus. to
[1:59:47] be salty, Lord, to those who have need
[1:59:49] of you, Lord. Father, our hearts are
[1:59:51] longing to see you one of these days.
[1:59:54] Any time now, we don't even know how it
[1:59:56] could go as far as it has. But yet, we
[1:59:59] look for you daily, Lord. And Father,
[2:00:02] we're praying God that this message that
[2:00:04] you sent to the earth through Malachi 4,
[2:00:07] God, that it would do its work, Lord,
[2:00:10] that it would accomplish that which it
[2:00:12] was sent out to do, and that is to get a
[2:00:14] bride ready for Isaac. Lord Jesus, that
[2:00:19] Eleazar, Brother Brandham came to bring
[2:00:21] us to Isaac, God. And we pray Lord this
[2:00:23] morning
[2:00:25] we come to church, we hear preaching, we
[2:00:28] hear sermons, but Lord, when we go back
[2:00:31] out, Father, do we really listen to that
[2:00:34] tutor, that Holy Spirit that tries to
[2:00:36] teach us things, to help us to overcome
[2:00:39] things, to tell us the right way to do
[2:00:41] things. Father, if there's any in here,
[2:00:44] Lord, that really desires that, Father,
[2:00:47] that in every aspect of their life, they
[2:00:49] want to be surrendered to you, Lord. May
[2:00:50] they raise their hand to you now. May
[2:00:52] you see those hands and say, "God, lead
[2:00:55] me, Lord. Guide me, Lord Jesus. Be my
[2:00:58] guide, Father."
[2:01:01] That's what we have in our hearts is a
[2:01:03] true guide to guide us through this
[2:01:04] darkness. and to guide us to a closer
[2:01:06] walk with you, to guide us into
[2:01:09] receiving every promise that's ours,
[2:01:11] every blessing that is ours. Father, as
[2:01:14] we go, Lord Jesus, we receive it, accept
[2:01:16] it, and help us to have faith, Father,
[2:01:19] so that Lord Jesus, one of the greatest
[2:01:20] signs to me in maturity, Lord, is to be
[2:01:23] able to control situations and
[2:01:25] conditions and so forth as they come our
[2:01:27] way, Lord, to conduct ourselves
[2:01:29] Christlike. So, we ask God for this in
[2:01:32] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:01:34] God bless you. We love the You all love
[2:01:37] the Lord.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Let's give him a hand. Say, "Thank you,
[2:01:39] Lord Jesus." God bless you.
