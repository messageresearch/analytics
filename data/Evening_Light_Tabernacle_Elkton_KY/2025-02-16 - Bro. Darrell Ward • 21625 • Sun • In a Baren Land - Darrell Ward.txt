Book of Exodus I want to read from Exodus chapter 15 starting at verse 11 and then we'll drop down to 18 appreciate each of you coming out in my what 24 hours of work it beats all up never seen nothing like it in my life I just came through rain and got here and then held over there in Russellville and I thought man it's beat my car to death I said well I'll look at it in the morning I was afraid to go outside lightning striking I said well I'll look at the morning and see if the car got beaned up a little bit from the hell damage and opened up the wind and looked it was covered in snow thought I'm going back to East Tennessee hey man but I'm glad you're all here in most all the grateful that he's here this morning Exodus chapter 15 and we start at verse 11 appreciate brother berer allowing us to come in many many years of friendship amen hallelujah do you love him I just thought the song service was wonderful the Bible says this who is liken unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders Verse 18 for the Lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his Horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought again the Waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the Sea and maram the prophetes the sister of Aaron took a timil in her hand and all the women went out after her with timberl and with dances and maram answered them singing answered them sing ye to the Lord for he ha triumphed gloriously and the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to morah they could not drink of the Waters of morah for they were bitter therefore they the name of it was called morah and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree when he had cast down into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and he said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statues not just the ones you want to but all his statues I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this morning on in a Barren land Heavenly Father Lord as we bow in your presence this morning we are so grateful in our hearts Lord for all that you have done for us where it's written that while we were yet sinners you died for us Lord I I pray as we've gathered here on this cold wintery day that you would bless each one who's made the effort to come and those that wanted to and not able that may be streaming may you bless them also Lord we pray father God we know that in a Congregation of two or three there's needs and Lord no doubt in a congregation this size there's many needs but none of them are greater than you so Lord we don't look to their needs but we look to the god who's able to do something about it and I pray this morning Lord may your spirit come and strike every heart Lord let a Revival break out in every home Lord and shake this community once more for the glory of God lord may we search and strive to find that lost seed we know Lord that when that last one comes in you'll close the book and call your bride and Lord truly we're living in the hour lord of the manifestation of the sons of God may you come Lord and prove your word once more because we love you Lord and we believe you we commit these things into your hands Lord today and those that are traveling the end of the service and going back home pray Lord for each one that they would make it safely Lord we commit these things into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you you may be seated in our opening scripture this morning it opens with a declaration of just how great our God is and I'd like to say this morning amen because he is there is no God like our God there's many gods in the world today how many gods does the Hindu have and you know people will make a God out of their car or make a God out of their job there's all kinds of gods in the world today but there is no God like our God the Bible says this remember the formal things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me he is the true and living God I said he's the true and living God you know I heard Brother David Siler say one time that he was over in India he said he saw a man take a piece of wood I believe it was and fashion out of God out of this wood and he set the wood down and began to worship a God that he made with his hands and Brother David said as I watched him there he said I begin to think I'm so glad that I do not serve a God that I made with my hands but I serve a God who made me with his hands amen I am so glad this morning that the God we serve is not a dead God of stone or a dead God of wood or a dead God of brass that we would pray to and cry out to but he has no ability to answer back he has no ability to heal or to deliver us or a god of someone's imagination but I am so glad this morning that we serve a God who has the ability to answer back we serve the Living God this morning he is Almighty he is all powerful he is full of Mercy he is love amen and this God that we serve this morning we know his name amen we can cry out to him and he hears our cry and he sees our tears and our God has the ability to answer back Jeremiah 33:3 says it this way call unto me and I will not maybe not hope so not could be but I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not that's the God we serve this morning no situation no circumstance can stop him from answering you [Applause] back amen you know I think of Jonah think about this this morning Jonah in the belly of a whale a man who had more symptoms more circumstances against him than any man I know anybody here ever been swallowed by a fish Jonah was swallowed by a fish and you know the fish when they eat they always go to the bottom of the fish bow and this fish just swaddled a 6 foot 200 pound man so Not only was he in the fish's belly but he was at the bottom of the sea in a fish's belly oh God and Jonah said I prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly I cried by the reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice and I say if God can hear a man's voice in the belly of a wh at the bottom of the sea how much more can you hear your voice this morning in a building that's been set aside to worship Him amen David said in Psalms in my distress I called unto the Lord I Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even into his ears who is like unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders and let me say wonders he did when he went down to Egypt he brought his children out of bondage with a Mighty hand he trumped every one of the Egyptian gods and proved every one of their gods was a dead God the Egyptians served a God by the name of raw the god of son and God brought Darkness upon Egypt for three days but their God could not take it back Hallelujah showing that their God was a god of imagination but he was the true God and when he brought his children out of bondage he broke the chains of Oppression he broke the chains of come on somebody he broke the chain and he drowned Pharaoh's Army in the sea hallelujah hallelujah when he went down to Egypt and let me say when God comes to your Egypt he'll break the chains of Oppression he'll break the chains of depression he'll break the chains of sickness Hallelujah and he'll bring us out for because he said I am the Lord thy God that delivered me he proved every one of the Egyptians Gods was dead and that he was the true and living God and he delivered his people and when Mariam saw her enemy was dead she got into the spirit grabbed a tambourine and up and down the bank she went shouting and singing and praising God that's the kind of church I want to be in don't give me some dead dried up church I want a god with life in it amen hallelujah amen there laid their dead there laid the ones who had beat them and abused them laying dead the ones that had bothered them and seeing them defeated it was time to dance well I tell you brother Daryl when I get to heaven I'm really going to shout I'm really going to praise God I'm really going to dance I say why wait huh why wait if you can see the promises are for you if you can see if you can see he's our deliverer if you can see he's done spok us in a rapture we have a pillar of fire we have a prophet messenger and The God Who led the first Exodus is leading the Third Exodus I say we can shout now amen our enemy is defeated the Propet said you're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated amen you are disputing with a conquered enemy people come up for prayer and say well the devil said this and the devil said that and the devil said this you are listening to a conquered enemy he said Oh Brother D you know that's good for brother Bor and that's good for brother pal but but I'm the least one in the church well I really appreciate your humility and you know we're a body of Believers is that true and the body's made up of many different things I'm so glad my whole body ain't my thumb there's all kinds of parts of your body that makes up the body and so maybe I am maybe that's exactly who I am brother Brett is that little crease at the little toe that attaches to the foot maybe that's the part of the body I am but if that's who I am guess what every devil is still under my feet amen you say brother Bren I'm out the least one that's the soulle of his feet but remember he's triumphed with you Triumph with you over every bit of it even The Souls of his feet every sickness every devil every Power even death itself is under your feet it's under your feet you need to tell the devil this morning you are under my feet amen hallelujah amen Believers amen we are believers this morning amen and all Devils is under her feet and on the banks of the Red Sea they were having a Hallelujah time now just think about this I I won't keep you long this morning I'll preach fast you amen fast we get done but think about this the Bible said when he parted the Red Sea his children went over on dry ground is that right well up where I'm from there's a Wataga Lake and many year ago when they built that Lake up there they built the dam they backed up the water for the river there and they flooded a city called Butler and they went in and tore down all the houses but they left one building why they left it I don't know but they left the old jail there now how long this Lake had 40 maybe 50 years at the most and they had a leak in the dam so they had to let all the water out so they could fix the leak the damage well when they let the water out the old town of Butler resurfaced and the TVA went in with bulldozers and bulldozed out the old roads so people could go in and see the Old Town some of the ones that lived there well me and my brothers we went there and I was walking down the road that they had graded out and I saw that gel and I wanted to look in it mistake number one when I stepped off of that grad Road into that mud I sunk up to my calves I thought my brothers were going to pull my feet off tried to get me out of that mud now how long that had been there maybe 50 years at the most how long the Red Sea had been here I don't know but when oh God hallelujah when God parted the water he dried up the ground you know why cuz he did not even want his children's feet to get muddy hallelujah hallelujah and after this great victory of shouting and praising God now they're on their journey and here they go through the wilderness on their Journey marching following the message of the Prophet following the pillar of fire on their way to the promised land that God done said was theirs to a God who can't fail huh being led by a God who can't fail the three days into the journey they find their first test they find theel in a desert place in a Barren land with no water three days they marched all the families all the cattles remember they took everything with them the mules everything a single day in the wilderness without water may be tolerable two days would be difficult but three days would be almost impossible think about it after three days of no water especially for the children and for the animals and after three days someone up ahead yells water there's water and the Animals begin to smell it perhaps begin to break ranks and the children begin to run and whoever got there first they just fell in get back get back get the kids back what's the matter we can't drink it think about it 3 days with no water you would about drink anything but God made the water so bitter that they could not drink it and sometimes God will make a trial so hard it'll make the water so bitter that you can't can't expect nothing less than a miracle he will make the water so bitter that you would look nowhere else but to him you see where are people who wants miracles signs and wonders Miracles but you can't have a miracle unless you got a problem people want Miracles but they don't want no problems but here they are in a great trial they have a great problem but they serve a great God think about it the disappointment of finding water to realize it's bitter would only make the situation worse to be so thirsty for so dry dust from the desert the sweat the weariness to find water in it be so bitter that you can't drink it to hear the children say mama please please mama let me let me have some of that water no honey mama can't give you that water mama can't let you drink it it's too bitter why would he do that why would he lead us to water and it'd be bitter we're his people we follow his message we listen to Moses why the bitter water and they cried M and they named the place face the land of bitter water just three days before they were singing shouting dancing praising God now the same voices that praised him and honored him and danced before him now those same voices was murmuring and complaining and scared and upset how soon they forgot the Red Sea Revival how quickly their countenance changed when they arrived in Mora the bitter land the barren bitter land how quickly their countenance changed when they arrived in the bitter land and it's in those moments it's in those moments when the doctor says I'm sorry when you lose your job when bitterness comes into your marriage disappointments and situ ation turns against you it's them times that Satan likes to take advantage of it and start spewing his lies you say lies well he's the father of it and can you imagine the lies that he tempted to overtake these kids with these children God's children I can almost hear it in my mind when he come to them and said this God of yours delivered you out of Egypt are sure they beat you and abused you but at least you had food at least you had water now he brought you out here you ain't got no water to leave you three days in the desert to die and temp you with water that you can't even drink some God you serve some cruel God and it's in that moment it's in that moment when every fear surfaces and all they saw was death it was a bitter situation indeed but you see the devil want you to see the X-ray he only wants you to see the MRI he only wants you to see the drug addiction the marital situation the fear the pain the No Way Out situation he wants you to see the storm but not the sun you know I flew the other day I was flying somewhere to preach got into a terrible storm I've been in many a plane where I have never been in one like this this plane was reeling and a rocking people were screaming kids were crying people praying that's one of them so finally we landed down in Charlotte and was going to take off again but they made us wait for over an hour we sat out there on that plane waiting for the storm to pass over that we could leave and Fin finally we got a green light to go and we took off and when that plane climbed here we went again reeling and rocking and a dropping and a jumping clouds everywhere but all at once we broke through the clouds and when we did guess what I saw the sun it was there the whole time it was there the whole time the storm the wind the clouds the rain it did not stop that son [Applause] amen amen think about that to notice the Red Sea was a water problem is that true and God moved for that water problem then if God can fix one water problem he can fix all water problems amen you see the Red Sea and the bitter water was both water problems but if God can heal one water problem he can heal any water problem if God can heal cancer of the skin he can heal cancer of the bone cancer of the liver cancer of the brain cancer of the breast come on somebody if he can bring one prodical home if he can bring one prodical home he can bring all prodical home if he could fix one marriage he can fix yours if he delivered you once anybody ever been delivered by God if he done it once cannot he do it again I say yes he can I say yes he can Hallelujah but all they saw was death bitter undrinkable water in a Barren land and the people remembered against Moses saying what shall we drink you see God was leading him to the promised land that he said was NS as far as God was concerned they was already there for he told Moses when you bring them out you shall worship me upon this mountain so as far as God was concerned it's already done the Battle Is Over the victory is won it's all already done so God was leading him to this promise that that he said was THS why wouldn't he Bass the land of bitterness why take him to a bitter land land if he's done gave him a promised land looks like he would have bypassed it but he let him right straight to the bitter water you see where the Israelites didn't see a way God did he was the way the test for the Israelites was a question of faith believing what they couldn't see you see the Bible says we walk by faith and not by sight you can't can't walk by both at the same time you either walk with what you see with the eyes of your head what you see with the eyes of your heart but you can't walk by both at the same time you see the devil chose to use your eyes what he can show you with your eyes but God never chose the eyes of your head he chose the eyes of your heart look the Unseen oh thank you Jesus amen amen where they didn't see the way he was the way it was a question of faith without the bitter water there would have been no opportunity for God to perform a miracle that day the most difficult situations in our lives are opportunity for God to do the miraculous to turn our bitter situations sweet to show us just how great he is you see God could say I'm your healer I'm your deliverer and we'd say yes Lord yes Lord intellectual conception but God don't want us to know him by knowledge he wants us to know him by faith thank you so he could said I'm the god of heal yes Lord head knowledge but he wants you to know it by faith let me show you I think I've told this before but it just come to my mind when my little girl Jessica you know the story she hit by the train left blind and all the and her eyes came open one day God gave us gave her back to us and so a person heard that I had told her that she'd see me again because God provided a lamb for her eyes because in the Bible days they used a lamb for a c and ey animal like they use a dog today and I said God provided a lamb for your eyes you'll see me again and one day our eyes come open and somebody heard about the story and they bought Jessica a lamb well the J the the lamb was free but the electric fence cost about 200 bucks so I put this fence up and I put the lamb in it and I told Jessica I said now Jessica this wire right here is hot if you touch it it'll burn you understand yes daddy intellectual conception so I was over in the field working on a tractor that backslid on me and I was looked and here she came down out into the backyard where the fence was I saw her going to it and I was just watching and all of a sudden she grabbed a hold of that wire so I climbed through the fence and I went over to where she was I'll never forget it she's about six seven year old she looked at me the big old blue eyes and had her hand just like this I can still see it in my mind and she looked up at me tears coming down off of her cheeks she said don't touch that wire Daddy it's hot you see before it was me telling her but after she experienced it it was her telling me and that's the way it is with God Amen he wants you to experience it so you can say my God is a great God my God Is A Healer my God is a deliverer amen that's my God there is no God like my God not by head knowledge I know it by experience hey amen I've seen him make the lame walk I've seen him open blinded eyes there is nothing that my God can't do amen and the murmurings and the complainings of these Israelites against God made Moses cry out to God you see if you want your Barren lands if you want your bitter Waters turn sweet then take the case To God In Prayer because prayer is the greatest weapon that's ever been placed into the hand of the believer man nor demon can stand before prayer that's why the devil tries so hard to stop us from praying you can go all day and not get a text and you go to your prayer closet and start praying huh why because there's something when a child of God goes to the father in prayer so God begins by making us begin the people complained to Moses and Moses took the complaint to the master and all the trials the surest way to Victory is prayer the power of your prayer huh the power of your prayer is more powerful than an atomic bom you know years ago as a sister go to our church sister clark God rest so sister eth clark she's been going for years now but she's my Sunday school teacher when I was a little boy and my Mom and Daddy backslid on the Lord and took us out of church so from the time I was about 9 or 10 till I was 21 got out of the army I didn't go to church but I go gave my heart to the Lord started going to church and started preaching I think around 85 something like that 85 86 and sister clark was sick wasn't able to come to church so after church one not me and my wife went by to see her went into her house this woman you talking about living holy anytime she place anywhere where there was a television she would turn her back to it wouldn't watch it we went into our house just a simple home sat down to talk to her and she said yeah I said even when you was a little boy said I saw the Lord had you his hand on you and said all the years years I prayed for you and I got in the car and I started crying I told my wife I said think about that when I was a total idiot running up and down the road God had a Godly woman praying for me you know that mother pray that prayer it may circle the Earth for years and find you in a barroom and find you in a hotel room ready to take your life the power of prayer more powerful than an atomic bomb you know when they dropped that bombb on Hiroshima even today there're still people having the effects from that bomb and that's the power of your prayer you see as soon as you have a prayer God has a remedy the Bible said he Moses he Cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved him you see the answer to their bitterness was always there before they even knew they had a problem the answer was already there when they was down in bondage the tree was growing beside the water before they ever knew it it was all ready there you know for several years the second week of February I always preached down in medidan Louisiana and so about November you know you try to get your ticket early so you can get a better price and so I got my ticket about November going to preach in February and went ahead and got my seat where I wanted to sit so the meeting weekend rode up and went down to Louisiana preached they brought me back up to Alexandria to fly out to fly home and I'm sitting in the seat that I picked out in November and a man come sat down beside me he said morning I said howdy he said howdy where you from I said Tennessee he said Tennessee he said what brings you to Louisiana I said I'm a preacher I preached this weekend oh you're a preacher I said yes sir he said well since you're a preacher let me ask you a question I said well buddy I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer but if I can help you I'll be glad to do it he said my my daughter was getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport he said I was looking on the internet and I come across something so interesting so I want to ask you about it I said well if I can help you I'd be glad to do it he said have you ever heard of a man by the name of William brandham I said yes sir his grandkids go to my church this guy never stopped talking till we had landed in Atlanta Georgia he was so fired up and when we parted ways I said God bless you and he said God bless you and we parted ways and I was walking down through the Concourse there and I got to thinking three months before that man ever knew he had a question God does have had the answer set beside him you want to hear another one I was down in Mexico down in quoo and there's a pastor down there I said buddy what can we do to help you what what what can we do he said well we need Bibles he said I got people in my church that's never owned their Bible and I thought my Lord how many do I have at my house and I said well sir I I can't promise you anything but when I get home I said we'll see what we can do so I come home I told brother Michael you know Michael Bailey my my brother-in-law and he was over the Sunday School classes so the kids started bringing their money in and it wasn't long after that that we had enough money to buy some Bibles so I called brother Bai he was my interpreter and I said you know brother Bai I said I was thinking instead of buying the Bibles here in the US and trying to get them across the border and everybody wants a handout by time you pay Customs you pay more to get the stuff into the country than what you paid for the product itself I said maybe we could find somebody in Mexico who could print the Bibles they did they didn't want to let he said just a simple paperback Bible said we can give everybody in the church a Bible and then we can take these Bibles and pass them out when we when we witness on the street so he said just a simple Bible so I told Brother n he said I'll check and see so he called back and he said brother darl said I found a man here who app print the Bibles it said he would either do a thous 1,7 for the money money we have or he would print a th000 have a little bit of money left over he said which do you want to do and I said just tell him to print a th and7 so the the books were ready they went and got them they had them all in boxes you know and they got this big bus you know like a Greyhound bus and you let up the doors like this and they had all the Bibles underneath it and so I flew down to quoo I wanted to be there when the brother got the Bibles and you know shake his hand and and so brother Bai up in the northern part of Mexico they got on this bus and was heading to the southern part of Mexico and they got stopped by Mexican soldiers made everybody get off the bus if you've ever been in a situation like that it's a little bit nervous it happened to me in Mexico it happened to me in Costa Rica and it happened to me in the Philippines it makes you just a wee bit nervous just to be honest with you but they made them get off the bus and so they pulled up the doors and when they did there was all these boxes and the soldier said what's in those boxes and brother B I said they're Bibles said Bibles he said yes sir he said well what are you doing with Bibles you selling them said no no we're not selling them we're giving them away he said you're giving Bibles away he said yes and so the soldier said well if you're giving them away we want a Bible but but I said he said would you give us one he said sure said how many of they are you he said there's seven of us amen you know there's some Church of Christ come to me one time tried to tell me God don't heal no more and I told him I said if your God Is So puny he can't heal I'm sorry but my God still heals you've come too late to tell me that the tree had been growing there for years you see the answer to your fears the answer to your sickness the answer to your problems was here before you ever had a problem there's two reports before you the doctors report and Isaiah's report is that right now let me tell you I worked in surgery for 17 years been in thousands of operations and doctors can tell you something and they'll be 100% correct is that true and doctors can tell you something and be 100% wrong I mean it is called practicing medicine now look I got nothing against doctors I just doctor here not long ago I had the flu and pneumonia at the same time I sure go to doctors but when the doctor says he can't help me I know somebody who can you know and if we believed this report as much as we beli the doctor's report how much better off would we be I am the Lord thy God that Health thee amen but I hear what you're saying but my problem my problem you see that's true you know whether it's the least problem in the church or the greatest problem in the church it's still a problem and in the problem sometimes we may not be able to see the sweet in the bitter yet but hold on have faith God works all things to good to bring about the sweet Romans 8:28 is true friends is that all right Romans 8:28 all things work to the good that's good and bad that's happy and sad that's getting the gift certificate from Walmart or the transmission falling out in the front yard all things work to the good and the next time you come to your morage instead of panicking have faith that the god you serve is the god who will turn your bitter Waters sweet for the glory of of his name in a desert place in a Barren land God shows his greatest power in a desert place in a Barren land God shows his greatest Miracles wow God chose them to bring them to a place where they had to rely upon him and trust him completely instead of looking to the Water of Life he wanted them to look to him who is life you see what I'm saying if they come up and drink the water they have said Thank You Lord and just went on but he made it so bit that the only place they could look was to him do you trust in The God Who deliver you to carry you through the Israelites didn't see the water they could drink but God did God saw the sweet and the bitter he's the one that provided it in a Barren land God shows his greatest power going to have just a few more minutes now the disciples and the Lord they went into the desert to rest and somehow word got out and when they got in there to rest there was thousands thousands you know the Bible said he fed 5,000 plus women and children and some people estimate there was between 11 and 15,000 people at this meeting and when the day begin to wear on and they were weary the disciples came to the Lord and said Master send them away for we are in a Barren land we are in a desert place a desert place of wilderness desolate lonely uninhabited we are in a Barren land send them away that they may go into the village that they may find some rest that they may find some some some some food some water and Jesus said go among them and find something to feed them in a Barren land and so they go among the people and they find this little boy who has his lunch five biscuits I believe and two fish so they go up this little boy he's got this I can just see he's got this bag in his hand said yeah what's in the bag little boy it's my lunch what you going to do with it eat it so would you give it to the Lord would you give it to the Lord what does the Lord want with my lunch he wants to feed this multi dude Jesus wants to feed this multitude with my lunch but you see little is much if God is in it and when he gave Jesus his lunch Look what Jesus was able to do with it and we keep our problems and we keep our fears and we keep this we won't praise the lord we won't raise our hand we sit in church like we're dead but if you give well you know I just can't but if you can just raise your hand whatever you can give him in this desert place they were fixing the sea just how great they're God was for in this Barren land came A great miracle when he took a little boy's lunch and blessed it and fed the multitude and the Bible said if my memory certainly right they took up 12 basketfuls of food left over after everybody had ate they were tired they were weary they were hungry and he fed them I can see that little boy going home and threw his bag up on the counter and his mama said why junior didn't you eat said oh mama did I eat we had Wonderbread they were tired they were hungry they were weary and he fed them the children of Israel they were tired and thirsty and he gave them Sweet Water let me say this as we're coming to a close you may be in a desert place you may have arrived in the land of bitter Waters but maybe you're there this morning maybe maybe you are there this morning for your greatest miracle in that Barren land in your land of morah why don't you do like Moses and cry unto the Lord and let God show you that the tree has always been there the tree has always been there you say what tree you talking about brother Daryl calvary's tree you see calvary's tree holds the answer to every problem Jesus was the answer yesterday he's the answer today and if there's a tomorrow he will be the answer tomorrow calvy where he paid the price he paid the price to have the ability to turn your bitter Waters sweet sweet water in a bitter Barren land already paid for you hear not long ago I was in a restaurant and the waitress come by and said is there anything else I said no ma'am just a check she said well somebody saw you in here and paid for your meal I said really she said yes I said well let me leave a tip said no took care of the tip and everything so if there's nothing else you can go now I could have done one or two things I could have said ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know are you sure you're talking about me I could have argued I could have debated I could have said I'm unworthy I could have said no no no you want me to go out that door so that bail will go off and say he sto a steak I could have argued I could have debated or I could have accepted the fact that someone paid the price for my supper and walked out with a belly full of steak is that not true so what do you think I did said thank you I said Thank you and I walked out because the dinner had already been paid for oh God don't you hear what I'm telling you you can get up this morning and walk out that door free for everything you have need of has already been paid for your healing your deliverance your joy your peace your security your salvation everything we have need he has already paid the price Peter said by his stripes you were healed past it hallelujah hallelujah oh do you love him this morning David said though I walk in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me David said Thou shalt revive me revive means to be quickened from sickness from discouragement from faintness from death to preserve life to let live to give life to Quicken to revive to refresh notice what David said David didn't say if if I walk in the midst of trouble he said though what was David saying I'm going to have trouble amen David understood that there will be trouble but he will revive me in the times of my troubles in a Land of bitter Waters he will make the water sweet you see when my mama had cancer she told me something I'll never forget she said Daryl I may have cancer but cancer does not have me and I may have troubles but troubles does not have me amen he promised me he would revive me a lot of times the reason we get into tight places is God wants to reveal to us and show us his love and to prove to us he's the same God yesterday today and forever and his power is still the same he wants to show his power God likes to manifest his power and maybe that's why you got sick maybe that's why you're having the trouble is he wants to show you his love a wonderwork god listen friends don't you tell me he can't do it I've seen cancers disappear I was in Cottonwood Arizona a woman had a tumor on her breast and she's putting this ointment on it some kind of essential oil or something she's putting on it and she come to church that night and was just sharing some of the things that we' seen the Lord do and she just started praising the Lord she never came up for prayer she never asked for prayer she went home and took off her blouse she said to put some ointment on this place and it was completely gone I was at the byc camp a few year ago brother James Tidwell was there and he had a place in his ear that been there for three years it would scab up and bleed over scab up and bleed and it was just he said I was always embarrassed because it looked like my ear was dirty and that night we had all the people come up the young people for prayer and had the the boys on this side and the girls on this side you all been to byc at the old place you know what I'm talking about and all that and we had one prayer for everybody in the building just everybody had all the ministers to come up and stand behind the kids and we prayed one prayer brother James goes back to his room with this place in his ear he gets up in the next morning looks in the mirror it's completely gone no scab no scar no nothing it's gone I had a cancer come up in my ear right here they did a procedure called the Mo's procedure they cut a hole in my ear so big you can read the Constitution through it and when it healed it left a terrible scar you can see it I'll show it to you after church left a terrible Scar and I thought you know that's right when man takes a cancer off the ear it leaves a scar but when God does it Hallelujah a Wonder working God seen broken bone Shields got bone trouble there a sister over in Brother Scott Smith's church had a torn rotator cuff was up for surgery and that night at the end of the service the people begin just to worship and to praise God and so I left the pull pit and I went into the study and all at once it sound like a train went through the building I thought Lord have mercy and the pastor come running and said brother Daryl said M said Mama Mama's in the service today say she's up for surgery and said God does heal her of a torn rotator cup said she couldn't raise her arm and she's got both arms up praising God he can heal rotat her cuffs come on somebody amen sister Betty up in Pennsylvania had glycom so bad she had to wear sunglasses because the lights of a
