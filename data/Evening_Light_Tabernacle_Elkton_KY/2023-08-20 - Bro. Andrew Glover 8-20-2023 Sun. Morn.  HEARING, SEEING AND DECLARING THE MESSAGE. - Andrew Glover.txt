praise God praise God oh yes praise God [Music] praise God God praise God praise God praise God we praise God hey man how many come here this morning to praise amen I think he's he's more than worthy to be praised a man of Amen everything that we could give him you know somebody said one time and said if you're thinking ever a second of your life left you could never thank him enough and I I believe that's a reality this morning that he's done so much for us it meant that we could never thank him enough or praise him enough or bless his name enough amen for all the benefits amen he is bestowed upon our lives and amen we do want to say God bless you all this morning might be good to be a Christian Amen to serve the Lord and to live for him and amen to know him and the power of his resurrection amen and we want to just answer this morning say it's a real honor and a privilege to be here with you again and we pray something we said last night to bless you and to help you and to encourage you and amen just to keep keep pressing the battle amen because I believe any day now amen we're going to go home amen and if you have your Bibles this morning we want to invite you in the scriptures we want to look in a couple of places today we want to First first of all look in the Book of Job the 42nd chapter The Book of Job the 42nd chapter and then we're going to look in the New Testament in the book of First John 1. and and that while you're turning there to come and the opportunity to be here and we want to say God bless him to him and his family this morning and the ministers here and the church we sure appreciate you all and amen just a real real special special place in our heart amen and we we sure love the Lord today amen The Book of Job the 42nd chapter we want to read here in the first verse of job 42 um the Bible here says then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything and that no fault can be withholden from me who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not thanks too wonderful for me which I knew not so job's actually testifying that he's actually uttered things that he didn't even understand but he uttered them because they were truth Hebrew or sorry the verse 4 here says here I beseech thee and I will speak now watch this I beseech thee and I will speak here I beseech thee and I will speak so there's a connection between what you're hearing and what you're speaking see I will demand of the declare thou unto me now that's some pretty pretty bold words amen I will demand of thee to declare unto me for I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mind I seethy wherefore I abhor myself and repent and dust and Ashes now brother Brian says what was he seeing he was seeing the word Vindicated so he was declaring what he was seeing and what he was seeing was Vindicated word now in the book of First John the first chapter of First John the first chapter I love to read the Bible they've been under the teachings of a Vindicated Prophet Amen in first John 1 and verse 1 it's a very very powerful reading here how the John is describing the person of Christ in first John 1 verse 1 he says now that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full I want you to notice here in verse 5 he says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen let's just buy our hearts together this morning and ask the Lord to minister to his Heavenly Father Lord your word is true your spirit is here this morning Father we believe that you're an ever-present help in the time of trouble we believe that your strength when we're weak we believe that your courage when we're discouraged father so Lord this morning we're inviting you to come into this building have your way Among Us Lord may you drive out ever Spirits it's unlike the Holy Spirit father may you bring an anointing and Liberty upon this place today Father Lord that we could declare your word Lord without reservation Lord without hindrance oh God the Lord we've come here this morning to do one thing that is to lift up the name that is above every name so Lord I'm inviting you this morning come and take preeminence Among Us have your way here today God father forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings Lord we we don't want to leave this meeting today the same as we came we want to leave change father so Lord send the spirit of wisdom in Revelation into the building oh God and Lord take these things as you've placed upon our heart and Lord give us the grace Lord to deliver it and to declare it father as you have so graciously given it to us and we'll be sure father to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory that's do your wonderful name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this morning that you may be seated here today amen we we want you this morning by the help of the Lord for just a few moments amen I want to speak to you here from these passages of scripture and if I would title this thought this morning I want to speak to you for a few moments on hearing seeing and declaring the message hearing seeing and declaring the message you know I love the word there that John uses in verse 5. he said this then is the message so when he uses this word message you go look at the Greek uh definition rather Hebrew of the word message and it means an announcement it means a promise it is the act of promising a promise given or to be given it is a promise good or blessing now a message then could very well be said that this then is the promise or this thing is the announcement this then is the blessing amen that God is alive and in him is no Darkness at all but the man preaches called hearing recognizing acting on the word he said now first Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing the word of God he said then the lever he hears it and recognizes it and acts on it the believer hears it he recognizes it and acts on it he said the carnal man will hear it sound of it but never see so here means to understand now look at it it's looking at something but to see it is to understand it so you can look at something and never see it you can you can physically look at something and it never really become a reality to you but when you actually see it you understand it now that's why that Jesus would say Amen except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven right amen or other words he cannot understand it again and the message I've heard but now I see he said and the church has heard of God they have read of him and what he did and the promises he made amen but now we see him with our eyes so we love him we've read about him all the promises he made amen but now we see him with our eyes just the same amen as job did see I have heard of thee amen but now I see thee now we see him with our eyes can I say it to you like this in other words now amen we understand him now now we see him now amen we understand his ways we understand his word now you all know the the prophet of God says it like this he said now in the last days we are given the understanding by the word amen that we are going to understand it because it'll come to an Ephesian age to it so in the last days there has to come an understanding in the church to bring the church to another Ephesians amen which I said last night and Ephesians amen will positionally place the believer in Christ amen to who they are what they are where they come from and where they're going now I'll set you as plain as I know how I believe that we have seen the message how many could raise your hand and say you've seen the message amen we have seen the message can you raise your hand and say we've heard the message I I believe we've seen the message I believe we've heard a message amen but I believe that the time has come to declare the message I I believe this is the time he meant to to lay aside every weight to lay aside every sin to lay aside everything amen that so easily besets the church and let us run the race with patience and declare amen what God has done in this age now I love in the book of Isaiah 48 verse 6 he says Thou is heard amen and see all this and will not eat declare it you have heard it you have seen it but will you not declared I have showed thee new things from this time amen even hidden things and thou didst not know them in the book of First John verse 3 chapter 1 verse 3 John says that which we have seen and heard declare now when you look at this word scene it means to see with the eyes it means to see with the mind it means to perceive amen this word gives prominence to the Discerning mind when the physical side recedes this word denotes perception in general as a resulting principally from Vision it is the prominence being in the mental element now he said we have seen and then he said we have heard that word heard means not death amen it means to perceive by the ear amen what is announced in one's presence so there will be an announcement in the presence of the church and there will be somebody to accept or to hear amen the announcement that is being made amen it means to learn to give ear to or a teaching amen or a teacher now now when you see something when you hear it amen then to declare it and to declare it means to bring Tidings amen it means to Proclaim to make known openly so when you declare something you're not you're You're Not Afraid amen but you're declaring it you're proclaiming it openly now amen I love then what John goes on to say he said so these things right we unto you that your joy may be full amen he said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you amen that God is a light and then him is no Darkness at all I love what Apollo says in Acts 20 verse 27 he said I have not shunned he meant to declare unto you the whole counsel of God he said now look at this now this word shunned it's a very powerful word it means to draw back it means to let down it means to lower to withdraw it is of those who from Timothy amen hesitate to avow what they believe Amen to be unwilling to utter from Fear amen so Paul here is saying fear amen could not stop me from declaring the counsel of God Amen fear could not could not push me off of The Declaration amen that God is true is it okay to preach this morning are you with me amen amen God he is true so he was declaring amen that the word of God is not a word of fear but it's a word of authority now you all know here you're very well taught that fear is one of the greatest things that Satan has put on the church but I believe it's time to rebuke the spirit of fear I believe it's time to remember what the Bible said amen that God has not given us the spirit of fear amen but have power and of love and of a sound mind now amen you all know that fear comes in many forms one for her amen is a fear of criticism people are actually afraid to do something amen because they're afraid of criticism even they're afraid of somebody saying something about them or somebody ain't been thinking something about him amen but I want to say this this is the time Amen to rebuke fear it's the time to rebuke criticism because we have been brought upon the Earth with a responsibility amen I'm losing it in my ear amen with a responsibility to declare amen without fear without reservation without hesitation amen what God has done in this generation now and then I'll say it to you like a prophet said he said now I stand Here declaring the creator of the heavens and earth amen Jehovah God he said I stand Here declaring the Creator amen of Heaven and Earth Jehovah God he said now I claim to be a representative of stays they meant to bring a faith to his church amen so a prophet was not declaring God Amen to bring a fear upon the church he was declaring God to bring a faith in the church amen because God's provided way to declare his word amen is through the channel of prophets amen now notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way he chose the way his work came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and foreordained amen being a part of God's word listen declaring the revelation of his word to that age in that time and then so when God sent a prophet on the scene he was not declaring just the word but he was declaring the revelation of the word in the season that the prophet was bringing that Revelation in now you all know a little bit of modern day Prophet is a preacher right remember he said so a real true Prophet points back to the word of the Lord amen the promise of the Lord amen not the Declaration of the church is made amen but a declaration that God has made and then so a word Prophet points to the Declaration amen of the revelation of the word of God in the season that you're living I I love this study brother Brown I love these says here he says in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here amen under my control to declare the word of God Amen I take every spirit in this building under my control Amen to declare the word of God Amen why was he declaring the word of God because now there was a people on the Earth that had eyes to see they had ears to hear they had a heart to believe I'm on church amen God does not reveal something unless there's somebody to receive what he's revealing and then he does not send a message and let's search somebody Amen to receive the message that is sending and God who is rich in Mercy has ordained you amen and chosen you and elected you Amen to received the revelation of the word that's promised amen I said like this you really cannot declare something until you've seen it thank you brother you really cannot declare something until you've seen it now the prophet says he reveals things amen by his foreknowledge to those who he is for ordained of these things otherwise they don't see it standing right there looking right at it and he cannot see it he says how many ever seen the picture of a cow in the bush or you just have to look and look did you ever see that or see the picture of Christ in the bush or in the sky or the clouds amen see the painter has got that Soul fixed up to you have to look at it amen just a certain way he said well then when you once see it you can't see nothing else about that amen every time you look at it there it is amen it's always been there amen but you could not see it until somebody pointed it out to you and I don't know maybe some of you all been there in Arizona they're in Tucson amen and if you're standing there in Eagle Rock looking up and then you can see a rock and in that rock is the formation and then you actually see a prophet profile amen right there bro remember his face right there in the face of that rock now I met hundreds and thousands of people to her through there every day and they never see it amen when I was there one time and brother Doug Baker he points it out to me and now every time I'm standing there amen that's all I can see see amen before it was pointed out I could not see it amen but when it was made so clear amen and I seen it I could see nothing else he said well that's the way Christ is himself the gospel amen the message is when you want see the message of the hour amen there's nothing else you can see but that amen everything else is gone amen the rest of it is just feel or see when you want see the message and then when you watch see the message amen everything else is filler when you once see the message everything paints off of the scene amen and you are seeing Christ and then you're not seeing a book you're not seeing a tape you're not hearing a sermon amen but you have come into contact amen with the person of the message and let me just go and say the person of the message is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ ain't that the person of the message is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ amen I believe that's what we need today amen is a personal face-to-face contact with God and in that face-to-face contact with God takes place amen then that will bring a fellowship are you hearing me a face-to-face contact even that will bring a fellowship amen can I cut a party for a second brother Brad amen if brother Brad's stand here facing that wall amen he's facing that wall and I'm standing here and I'm trying to talk to him I'm saying uh my name is Andrew how are you doing what's your name where did you come from amen there's no Fellowship I'm looking at him but he's not looking at me but if brother Brad turns around amen and I look at him he looks at me I can say I'm Andrew he can tell me his name we can shake hands see and now we can Fellowship thank you buddy we can now Fellowship because we're facing each other and do you see what this message is amen this message is bringing you peace amen with out of Abraham the god of Isaac amen where you're not just standing there amen looking at God reading about God Amen but God has turned around and he's looking at you face to face eye to eye I'm on church amen this ain't the hour to back off it's just the hour to declare I know him I believe him I have seen him I have heard him I have received him amen what's happening through this message amen you are coming into a fellowship you have seen God face to face you have seen him eye to eye amen and now you can't have fellowship with him I love what John says he says truly our fellowship is with the father yeah and with his son Jesus Christ you know if that Word Fellowship means it means the association the community the communion amen The Joint participation it is exhibiting an embodiment and a proof of Fellowship amen so when you're actually fellowshipping with something you're actually you're actually embodying amen what's your fellowship been with amen I love what the prophet says he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought amen when you was a little boy or a little girl a man you would walk around there would be certain things it would just well it didn't bother other kids but it was something like you in you cried out he said there was a god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that amen now what was that that was that little form of life that was in you then see and then after a while amen you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that went from the nomination to the nomination amen but one day you being a part of God you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word you knew where you come from you know what was the truth you were always amen the seed was in you always amen come on church amen you were the embodiment of the predestinated seed of almighty God Amen and when that seed would become quickened it would produce a fellowship between you and the life of Jesus Christ amen the word seen the word can you say amen amen that was before for the foundation of the world Amen saw the word and you come to it can I say this you were called by the word you were not called by the music you were not called by a preacher you were not called by special meaning amen you were called by the word in other words the written word amen called out to the predestinated word and there was a union took place amen and you are the embodiment of the fellowship amen of the written word and the predestinated word in the age that you're living I don't know how else to say it other than just to say it you didn't claim this message this message claimed you amen amen amen you didn't claim this message this message you were actually claimed by the message that's why John said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declaring to you amen that God is light and then him is no Darkness at all I look at this here the prophet of God said the layout of sin age amen is supposed to receive a message Malachi 4 said they would another place she said we as this group of people we have a message for this day amen we believe that God has given us a message amen that if God has given us a message what kind of message will it be it will be a scriptural message the problem God said like this he said when God is in it a message is going to follow that amen and the message must be from the scripture that must be a scriptural message it must come thus saith the Lord another place he said I like the message to be God constructed with the scriptures amen scriptural message and right there with it everything with the scripture it's thus saith the Lord then and it's got to stand because it isn't my word in question it'll be his word it's in question amen bringing it from the scripture we are not following a message that is based upon the ideas of a denomination where you're not following a message that is based upon the Traditions that has been passed down through generation amen We are following a scripture God constructed the saith the Lord amen Vindicated amen infallible perfect amen message there listen friends if this message is not perfect then how are you going to come to Perfection you do not bring something imperfect to Perfection by something imperfect but if you're going to bring something to Perfection you gotta lead it by Perfection and we have a perfect word we have a perfect interpretation we have a perfect faith we have a perfect word listen and that has brought us to a perfection now hey man I'd just like to tell you this woman for a few moments amen from the message amen what the messenger said the message yes amen 1953 he said the message is ready and the power of God is sufficient amen men and women are scared to break out your under into those fears before God and dare to trust him and take his word amen 1957 he said you don't come to church just to hear a message or to see a messenger amen the message is the holy spirit amen taking the word of God and giving it to you the message is the holy spirit taking the word of God and giving it to you another place you said now 1957 then Jesus came he said now if I understand the scriptures right I believe that there's gifts that comes into the church that the Holy Spirit speaks and pronounces to his people the things he wants to do and therefore the people who spoke was just an order after they got through speaking and now the message gifts to the people that he has already did the blessing for you it's for you to receive it amen so the message of Malachi 4 is a scriptural bus saith the Lord message that is pointing you back to a finished work and is declaring to you even you don't have to work for it you don't have to earn it the only thing you have to do amen is receive what he's already done amen for you that day of Calvary amen all church of living God Amen if you could see this morning that you're already saved amen you're already healed you're already delivered you're already set free you're already redeemed amen you have just got to receive amen what God has already done and then I love it I love that the protagon goes another place now 1961. he said the message is to God's children amen it's not to any certain organization amen it is to God's children it is the rise of the son 65. he said the message is to the believer amen the message is to the believer to them that perish it's foolishness amen but to them better in Christ amen and are a part of that seed in his life amen can I give you another one except the message is absolutely urgent amen the message is urgent don't stop amen keep going just keep moving we haven't got time for socials and picnics and cart parties amen the message is urgent amen can I give you another one he said the message is on my heart it meant the messages on my heart I must get it out amen that's my Soul Purpose regardless of what but my wife says what my children says what my pastor says my whatever says amen it's my Lord and I must get it out amen so there was a burden upon the heart of a prophet Amen to declare the revelation of the word amen to the people that needed it amen because the only way we're going to get out of time amen and back into eternity is by the preaching of the message of the hour now hey man I just sent you like this amen this is my favorite one amen the message is right are you hearing me amen the message is Right amen amen we believe that right the message is right he said because God sent the message God sent the messenger and no doubt that every gun of Hell will be firing at him that's right he will stumble and he will fall but he will get up and shake his head and go on Amen the messenger bringing the message will stumble and he will fall but he will get up he will shake his head and he will go on he said we got a message and nothing is it's going to stop it I'm on church I mean if the messenger who was bringing the message amen had such a street amen from the message that he was bringing a minute he would stumble and he would fall but he would get up and he would shake his head and he would keep on going amen then how much more power does that message have in the people who have received that message listen if it'll make the messenger get up in all the Metro Church get up if it'll make the messenger keep on going it all to make the church keep up now come on church amen I know sometimes we find ourselves in situations and we don't know what we're going to do we don't know where we're going to turn we don't know who to look to amen but I come here this morning to tell you one thing get up amen dust yourself off ain't nothing you got a message and there's nothing going to stop this message there's nothing going to stop this message it's a preacher you're getting pretty bold I am and then because Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell amen shall not Prevail against it listen he never said the gates of hell but not be against sin he just said they would not Prevail against it amen all hell is against this message all hell is against this bride every devil every gun every Spirit every demon ever come on church and align Devils against you ain't nothing but if this message is in you then I can declare to you greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world Listen every devil may be against you amen by his car is for you but different says it may you may be sitting here this morning Amen in the hounds of Hell on your heels amen but if this message is resonating in your heart there is nothing going to stop you oh God they can say what they want to they can do what they want to are you ready for this the devil can read and how amen but Jesus is raised from the dead and he lives in us today amen come on Church my God is not dead he's alive he's alive he's alive if he's alive then where is he he's alive right here in the house of God on a Sunday morning in the heart of his Believers somebody sat with me he lives he lives somebody shot with me he lives he lives today in US he lives today in us the message of the hour is oh God Amen is the Revival listen to this amen the message is revived again in the last days the message of who he is of what he is amen Emmanuel dwelling in you with the same word he did amen manifest himself through you amen the very same things he did it's the evening lights amen it's evil spoken of Amen it's a hard way can I say it to you like this amen the message is the Revival of the Supreme deity amen of God in the church amen the message of the hour is the Revival of the Supreme deity of God in the church you say how can you say that amen because the life that was in him has been manifested come on Church the same life that was in Jesus has been manifested Amen in the bride in these last days now I said you like this and the Unstoppable laugh it's the undefeatable life it's come on church it's the uncomfortable life the life that's in you amen cannot be stopped come on you say preacher you're saying that there's nothing going to stop us there is nothing going to stop you amen because the life that's in you has already tried to be stopped and it couldn't be stopped they tried to kill it on the cross and they could not kill it amen they laid it in a borrowed tomb amen and he laid there for three days amen but on the third day that live amen got up out of the Tomb and he walked out Victorious over death hell listen amen the life of Andrew Glover can be defeated your physical life can be defeated amen but Jesus said the same spirit amen that raised Jesus from the dead if he dwell in you he will also Quicken your Immortal bodies even then the life that you now live is the lie for the Son of God and you don't live at my works you don't live in my feelings you don't live it by sensation but you live it by the faith of the Son of God who loved you and died for you listen friends I will announce to you amen the Supreme deity of God is back in the church ain't meant to preach the deity amen the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ if you could ever realize who he was and what he did for you men and women amen your hearts would ran within you and you would be willing to throw away the trash of the world to live for him amen if you would ever see who he is what he done for you you would be willing to throw away the trash of the world Amen to live for him you say what is Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ amen I believe that he is Jehovah God Amen manifested in flesh I believe he is the Supreme deity of almighty God now if you want to find Supreme deity it's in the Book of Revelation the first chapter and the eighth verse Jesus says I am Alpha and Omega amen the beginning and the ending amen saith the Lord which is which was and which is to come amen the almighty now the prophet of God says amen saying I am Alpha Omega first and last it is not the announcement of the second party or the third party but the only party amen I'm the alpha and omega and before I show you anything amen I want to let you know who I am he said see the greatest of all the revelations is the deity amen the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ amen then it's time to declare the greatest of all the Revelation is the Supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ amen the first of all Revelation is the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you must know who he is amen when you hear his voice in Revelation 3 and verse 8 Jesus says amen I Know Thy works and behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it amen for thou Hast little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen look at this Open Door what was it it was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ amen not being a second person of a trinity amen but being God himself made flesh amen and dwelling Among Us amen so the open door amen was the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ amen being God in flesh made manifest among us if you want to see the Revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way he could take his church amen is back to the revelation of what he is amen so God claims the Church of the revelation of himself and the age that that church is living in come on it's in your book Christ is the mystery he said God reveals himself in a threefold purpose the first phone is he reveals himself amen the second thought is he takes pm and that's and the third fold is he takes a bride back to the Garden of Eden can I show you right there come on now right there is a prophet declaring amen what he would later say or earlier say rather in the seventh seal he said now the seventh seal will be revealed in a threefold manner right it's on your tape he said will be revealed in a threefold manner amen now if you want to find that it's in the message it's in Christ the mystery he reveals himself in a threefold purpose it's in your rapture book it's a shout it's a voice and it's a trumpet listen France Jesus Christ is not stealing you from the Devil he's not stealing you from laodicea when he takes you in Iraq sure he is taking you by the revelation of himself that has claimed you in the age you're living listen France if you reclaim my feelings then feelings will take you out if you are claimed by emotion that emotion will take you out but if you have been claimed by the revelation of Jesus Christ there ain't enough devils in hell in time or in laodicea they've been to take you out of the plan of God now come on let's not come up to it and back off of it we have been claimed by the revelation of the word of God you say preacher where are you going to fix I'll tell you where I'm going with this we're going to leave layout and see about Revelation we're going to take a Rapture by Revelation we're going to walk on the streets of gold by Revelation come on some of y'all right now you don't even feel like you're going to be there and that's the reason why it's cause the devil's lying to you the fat devil is a liar and he's the father of all lies but I come here this morning to take every Spirit under my control so I can declare the word of God I can declare the Revelation and the revelation of the word says you are the sinless Spotless Justified amen by the Jesus Christ it is as told you never even done it in the first place why don't you let Revelation amen lift you up out of the ash heat why don't you let Revelation lift you up into a place where you can see God amen he claims you by the revelation of himself where he would build his church that's the only way he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is now not what he was or what he will be what he is because what he is is what he was and what he was is what he will be and what he will be is what he is and what he is is what he was and what he wants is what he will be and what he will be is what he is and what he is is what he was come on church it's the identified Christ of all ages he's the same yesterday today and forever you say what is the identifying characteristic of God he is the unchanging God and he has unchanging ways oh I tell you what that's enough to Shadow on this morning amen is to know that our God is the unchanging God time is changing churches are changing world is changing politics brother Valor everything's changing amen but there is a God who is seated at the right hand of the father in majesty and power this morning and he is the unchanging God and His word never changes his leads never changes his love never changes oh God we change every day but he is the unchanging God so there's nobody could ever stop the message of the Supreme deity and the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ listen the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it are you with me now he revealed it in the church at Ephesus is that right and that was when the light first broke through to shine the Christian Light the Holy Ghost age started right here in Ephesus and the prophet said there would come a day that wouldn't be night or day but in the evening light would come back again you see it see the day of this will come across through here all this here in this organization but in the last days over here way down here he would set that open door and Jesus said I am that door come on Amen for seven Gentile ages you can look across amen and you can see at the End Amen what was in the beginning would be at the ending because he is the Alpha and the Omega he that was is and shall come come on church he can look all the way across those Seven Ages and oh I love how many represents and it's beautiful he said he is the creator of his own bride right he said therefore he could create his breath he said he could stand right here Amen in the very first age and he could look all the way over to the end and he would say these words and still see himself he could still see himself where would he see himself at amen First Seven Ages they've been trying to put him out for Seven Ages Darkness has been increasing amen but in the end time the same light that shown in the beginning would return In the End Amen and Jesus Christ the resurrected Lord would be standing there as an Open Door they said come on church it's the Fulfillment of Revelation 18. come out of her my people why did he say come out of her because they put him out and they would not let him back in come on they put him out and they would not let him back in so in order to have access to his people the only way he could do it was Austin was he had to call you out he had to call you out and that's why the prophet introduced the term the bride age and said for the first time there will be for the coming forth of the Bride for the bride coming of Christ there will be a bride age listen I know people I hope I can take some Liberty I know people get all tore up and say or you can't preach Fridays you can't say right age because somebody somebody said it somebody amen listen before anybody Twisted it a prophet told it so let's teach the original and forget the false and remember when a prophet saying that this is the broad age listen friends this is the age when the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ is manifesting in his bride oh that's why the prophet said one of my favorite songs is down from his glory amen how many ever heard that song Oh What A Story down from his glory every living story my God and savior came and Jesus and Jesus was his name are you hearing me verification in an age where they're trying to make him just a prophet they're trying to make him just a teacher he said I love that song Amen because that song Amen refers to the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ he said that song expresses the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ what are you saying preacher I'm saying this he has come down are you hearing me he has come down now now when you start talking about this I know people uh sometimes they'll say well we got to be careful we got to place these things a certain way but you know what I believe amen I believe that there is that there has been an appearing of the Lord in this generation now I know I know some of y'all here are probably familiar with this picture I I'm sure you are you're familiar with it it may not do you realize what this is this is not just a picture it's not just it's not just something to argue and to fuss about this is actually an announcement it's a message now what are you saying because the Bible says Revelation 10 1 that I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven and he was clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire let me see if I can maybe prop that up there his face as it were amen his feet as pillars of fire I want you to catch something here he says I saw another Mighty Angel come down amen what did he say he said oh how I love him amen down from his glory are you hearing me it's not about our sin going up amen he come up no he come down now you say preacher why are you emphasizing on that because he come down and what appear Now Fair in Arizona was ahead now you all hear probably how many got driver's license uh even if you're driving don't have one it's okay no no I'm just kidding it's a joke I'll speak to one time I can't memorize that I said in the church and I said I said how many here got their driver's license and one sister he didn't raise your hand you know straight to church we went out back she got the car and she's driving off and I thought Dear God so you know I have a license so somebody told me he said well she didn't need a license she got keys so listen go get a license moving on okay all right but better license now own your driver's license you got a picture and on that picture it's not your foot your hand is not on that pick your arm is not on that picture kids don't drive without a license are you hearing me Amen on that picture is your face is your hand listen the only part that identifying you is your hand listen your hand does not identify you your foot is not an end but your face which is the headship of your body is on the driver's license and it identifies you oh church are you hearing me do you realize what this was amen this was a cloud that appeared and missed the cloud 1960s appeared out there in Arizona and the problem of God said to what I believe he said I believe that Revelation 10 1. he said no I went to Brother Jack Moore and I asked brother Jack I said brother Jack is this Jesus in his glorified body he said no he said that didn't mean he didn't say that didn't ring the bell he said Jack said it was Jesus glorified body I said brother Jack man don't ring a bell he said so I went back in the room and he said when I went in the room he said I began to pray and he came in the room Oh my he said now as I was looking at this he said as I was homing he told me to turn it to the right that when mother Ed Hunter was out there send me all over the hunter when he was out there Amen in that meeting eyes of the sun he said we all had the picture in our hands so he was out there before service he said we were seeing everything we were seeing Angels fire chariots everything he said but when a prophet walked out there and he said now listen if you'll take that picture and you'll turn it to the right he said oh he said there was an audible gasp amen went across the congregation he said these words he said see turn it to the right and there is Jesus as he was in the seven strategists the white weak one showing Supreme deity amen he is Alpha and Omega the first and the last he is the Supreme judge amen of all eternity standing there Amen to confirm amen the message of this hour listen friends when that cloud appeared it was not an argument it was not a rocket ship amen it was the headship of the party coming upon the Earth to identify come on Church whether you want to believe it or not this is your head this is your hand now come on cause I prove it to you amen if you look at that picture it's his head looking up for the baller it's his head stirring up at the sky when he appeared in the sky he's looking down why is he looking down because he's looking for his body he's looking for his body come on church and who is his body you are the mystical body of Jesus Christ listen friends we are not looking for headship headship is here we are not looking for Rapture in faith rap stream faith is here we have been claimed by the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ I love what the problem God says he said before he reveals the characteristic of the last age he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself amen the catched on Revelation of himself is the Supreme deity of himself having preeminence Enterprise come on Church we're not at the bottom of the pyramid we're not even halfway up we have climbed Seven Ages and we're standing on the seventh Peak amen and the hits on this come listen church this message is our leadership come on somebody this message is our leadership what are you saying I'm saying when the prophet said the message he is he goes before us he's not in a tomb behind us he is before us making a way we are to follow not to look back to the tomb but to look forward to where he's leading us amen for he is our leader we are to follow him amen not look back to the tombs come on church this bride does not go back she goes forward amen and the only way she can go forward is somebody has to lead her somebody has to be the leadership something Brother Brad has to be the headship a headless body has no Direction a headless body goes in circles but when there's a head with an intelligence then there's a direction to lead the church forward now I'm just going to take a little time here as I'm as I'm moving through this I'm not going to preach all day but I'm gonna say this amen what is our leadership what is leading us now you say preacher amen the message well is it really because I have met people Amen in ministering around around the world by God's grace I've met people and you know what they say the message is our leadership and I talked to about five minutes and I realized the message ain't their leadership what somebody thinks about the message is their leadership hope it's okay are you hearing me the message really is not well somebody told him I remember one time I was fellowship with your brothers and I and one guy he got to talking he said now you know he said there's two Lords I said oh really two Lords he said yeah I said there's two Lords I said wow I said amazing to me as the Bible says there's one and the devil shakes I said what if there was two it'd probably fall over I just kind of joke you know he said you mean to tell me you don't believe in two Lords I said come on brother prove it to me from the Bible he said well he said over there in the book of Psalms the Bible says my lord said to his Lord amen sitting here on my right hand I may call the Amy's thy footstool he said right there's two Lords I said brother have you not studied what a prophet said he said oh yes I have I said well tell me what he's saying he'd give me about about five or ten minutes worth of stuff you couldn't time that being out of it in the message and I said well why don't we just say what brother Brandon said he should say I said he said he was both root in offspring of David good enough for me right he was both root and Offspring and David that said listen so that's when some more Brothers a while back a while after that and we were kind of talking and they got to tell me and one brother wasn't even around that previous conversation and he starts telling me word for word what the other guy told me and he starts telling me and when he gets done I said brother where'd you give that he said I got it from brother so and so I said oh so that must have been where brother so and so see they get stuff and it doesn't come from the Bible it doesn't come from the message and then here's where the problem is when you refuse to follow it then you're an unbeliever you're not a message believer you're serpent seat but as a genuine believer of this end time word I am only under obligation to follow one thing and that is the headship of Christ that is descended into this age and it is the Capstone it is The Headstone listen I am not under obligation to follow your opinions we are not under obligation to follow your home y'all know I'm telling you the truth amen all kinds of ideas creep in and then you can't prove them by the message and then well so that's why you got to preach the message because the the message is the headship now brother I'll just say like this brother Balor you have personal connections I have personal connections brother Brian you have personal connect we all have personal convictions but when it comes to the pulpit the only thing that belongs in the Pulpit is the word [Music] only thing that belongs in the world now y'all know I'm telling you the truth I met a guy one time he said brother he said why don't you preach this so he started telling me all about it I said whether that's your personal conviction he said that's right he said it all to be preached he said go in the Pulpit preaching I said brother you crazy if you think I'm gonna go preacher conviction when I don't even preach my own laughs come on if I don't even preach my own personal convictions I sure ain't gonna preach yours because I'm under a Mark 16 commission I've got to preach the gospel listens oh God I hope it's okay amen sometimes you can build personal convictions and they're good but they're not you you cannot you cannot lead the church by them hell glory to God can't leave the church by because you have no less sense Lord to stand by it come on it's your purse and there's nothing wrong with it have it enjoy it believe it raise your family back but don't put us in hell cause we don't follow it that's why God send a message so when we come to the pulpit we would all be saying the same thing now you all know I'm telling you the truth when we come to the message we witness land well brother so and so thanks and this one thanks but we would be studying the message and preaching on a prophet oh and it would be bringing a spiritual unity in the body now let me say this to you the message of the hour remember his names he said but in this church age he said the message is being poured somebody say poor it's being poured into the church now watch this he said this Tabernacle is not a holy ghost Tabernacle there is no such a thing he said individuals that come into this church is Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost but not the church and the body a group he said but what this man who was pouring the water the messenger to the church listen was pouring the message into the church but what was the water doing he said it was bullying all the trash that was in it whoa it was bullying all the trash out that was in the so you had seven Church ages and every age had trash in it but when God sent a star if a message to declare the revelation of the word for that age and he began to pour that message in the message began to wash the trash out well we might as well preach amen because that's what Jesus did in Luke the 24th chapter when he raised from the dead and he was walking with the two on the road to Emmaus you know what they said they said if thou not a stranger around here do you not know the events that's taking place amen remember they were full of complexes they were full of fears they were full of sadness they were full of confusion and then they were all tore up and here they are walking with Jesus now listen what a prophet says he said and Jesus was walk with him and he never started arguing he never started arguing with him or talking watch what he did he went straight to the word he said see you're all confused one says this one says that one says this one says something else but base your thoughts on thus saith Lord and God will confirm it now watch this Jesus went straight to the word and he began to pour the word in he did not argue with him he did not fuss with him he just went to the word and he began to pour the word in and he began to say oh fools and slow of Hearts who has Bewitched you amen not to understand he's see he went back to the Old Testament and began to prove how the Christ should suffer and raise the third day and brother John by the time he got done pouring the water in he had washed all their fears out he had lost all their sadness out he had lost all their questions are you hearing me what done it friends the preaching of the revelation of the word that was in season in that hour listen let me say like this it's called the washing of the Water by the word Paul said that he might sanctify and cleanse the church with the washing of the Water by the word now I know it may get a little quiet here I'm used to it but we'll get through it okay Esther purged her heart before God and she walked up with a meek and humble Spirit he said and the church is going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refuse the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king and the woman today the church that she's going to get in because she's got numbers she's the best stressed crowd she's got the biggest organization the biggest church in the city things like that you will miss it a million miles it's a sweet kind reverent Spirit to the word of God see amen Washed by the Water of the word and the word in you it's a washing amen the church needs to wash it I'm an evangelist I know when I get to preacher like this it gets tired but I'll go ahead and say it the church needs a washing come on church the church needs a washing that's right he said not just a part washing but a Full Gospel washing amen cleaned up made new creatures in Christ Jesus another place he said your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word see the word become blood so the word bled for you and you're the washed and bleeding word Watch The Life Of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and Sanctified amen by the washing of the water of the word and that'll make your mind and heart State on God on his word well Belinda I've been serving God for 45 years ain't no trash in my life I've been serving God for 10 years amen listen I don't care if we've been serving God for 80 years we are living in a world that's full of trash and devils and trash and they'll find their way in and you know what we need to do we need to get back to preaching them message and let the message watch the church that's the word claim the church I've seen a lot of guys get up I'm just preaching amen get up watch the church and they weren't trying to wash them by the message they was trying to wash them by their personal convictions now y'all know it's the truth well you can't do this amen before long you can't find them amen they're out somewhere wrecked up on an ass Heap and they're all wadded up and they're blaming the message listen this message is not legalism if you well Glory if you preach the message you won't have to worry about makeup coming in the church if you'll just preach the message you won't have to worry about high-heeled shoes oh are you hearing me if you just put your message you don't preach the skinny jeans right off the boys and put on a pair of pants and look like a man you gotta preach the message quit preaching your convictions and well I say preach what a prophet said a prophet well God Hammer you know why thanks crap back in it's cause people got a little bit afraid they've been to say what a prophet said he said a woman wore paint he said well you ought to say good morning Miss all Mead and some little fear come in and run back in the corner and they they quit saying it listen if you're gonna be a sit down and let somebody up this kind of backbone because these are souls and they need to hear the message of our declared in the power of the washing of the water of the word and then what does the word say now you know what the prophet of God says I love this quote I've been I've been brother brother Thomas I've been chewing on this for months he said the message is the correcting foreign another place when the church is in trouble that's when a message Goes Forth to correct the thing another place oh if the church could ever get to that place to where it can solemnly rest upon God's word Amen to you the truth what a difference there would be what a correcting there would be what a cutting away there would be what a joy there would be what a power there would be when men and women would take God at face value that what he's saying is the truth now you know what the message is to do is to correct the situation now you all know that there's been situations arise and here's what we say how we gonna fix it some of y'all been in the message for years and you've seen that you you've seen the different uh how can I say it winds of Doctrine that's come through you've seen it you've seen it come through and and sometimes now y'all just give me some Grace here but sometimes we get under a pressure to try to fix it y'all know you know what I'm talking about and it you get under pressure and so you how they gonna fix this man things are getting out of balance how we gonna fix it how we gonna correct it okay y'all ready go ahead I'm gonna give you a really deep answer it's gonna be deep okay you got a notebook piece of paper you might want to write it down it's going to be really deep how we gonna fix it are you ready preach the message it's very deep just preach the message if you preach it the message will correct it and the church will move on because the message is not to bring people back to a preacher or a personality the message is to bring the people back to the word and the prophet said because the word corrects the error the word corrects the error the Bible said we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God here is not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error said today there is a gross error it is that there are three Gods instead of one this Revelation is given the John by Jesus himself corrects the error it is not that there are three Gods but one God but three offices there is one God but three titles this Mighty Revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in the last name you say what are you getting at I'm saying this Jesus knew he was the word he knew he was the word the product God said Jesus himself when he came he knew he was the word he was positive that when he was just 12 years old little boy we found him in the temple to make Mr priest his knowledge could surpass their traditions and when his own mother come to him and said a word that was wrong watch the word correct the error because the word always corrects the error anytime you see error just preach the word because the word will always correct the air and if the people are going to see that today the word corrects the air he said the whole thing is becoming air but God's word is what is right he said now watch the word that is prophesied for this day corrects the error of the day I love these quotes the word comes back and corrects that error by identifying itself the hour and the time of the hour I watched this when he was a 12 year old boy he wouldn't do that he was the word see he was the spoken word of the age so therefore the identified character if God was in Christ he corrected the error can I give you another one the word always corrects the error by identifying God among them can I give you another one but let's go back for just a few moments now and identify what Jesus was when he was on Earth and we'll find out what he was then what he's been to the other ages then it'll have to be the same thing in this age to make it right see why because we are the present-day Disciples of Christ now the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free remember ask the question he said what is the truth he says Thy word is truth he said you believe in the truth and truth will always speak for itself that's right you never have to strain truth you never have to strain truth truth will always be truth the truth will never make you popular but the truth will make you honest and we'd rather be honest than popular you say brother Andrew you're getting laid out there am I really the truth coming in the church will set the church free yeah the truth being spoke over your life will heal your body the message of the hour is the correcting why are you saying this because the spirit of God always comes to the word brother Andrew why are you why are you so emphasizing on this because there's a lot of trash in laodicea but it belongs in laodicea not in the bride [Applause] belongs in laodicea it don't belong in the bride therefore this bride must have a washing of the water by the word how many can say Lord Wash Me Wash Me Watch Me Lord you know we you know and I know I know I'm slowing down a lot right here we can get bad attitudes and we can shout dance and holler and scream run all over the building and got a bad attitude praying for power to move mountains and he said you can't even move your attitude yeah he said God will never give you power to move mountains if you can't move your attitude are you hearing me you say oh brother Andrew this ain't the message it is it's The Headstone it's the leadership it's the Direction coming upon the church for Rapture to lead her out of here how many can say Lord Wash Me wash me let our musicians come this morning Lord wash me he said so many people today are open their hearts the wrong thing and they get a spirit all right but many times it contradicts the word saying this the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as this or that remember listen remember that's a devil under the disguisement of Christianity God help us when we get down here see there's an evil spirit in the disguisement of Christianity but it isn't the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ comes to the word every time he cannot deny his own word think about that he cannot deny his own word you know what this you know what this word is this word's like a detector you can try to hide stuff y'all y'all know they got these these things you go through the airports now and you go through there and drive you crazy I mean literally drive you crazy you gotta you gotta belt on BBB well it's about yeah but what they're doing is they're so built to pick up things that you can't hide nothing can't hide nothing try to hide it in your shoe and it's gonna go off try to hide it in your socket it's going to go off I didn't think that they or somebody was trying to hide some drugs and they're in their as they were traveling they had a needle in their arm and put a shirt over in a jacket and actually had it buried in their arm taped over and that thing still picked it up it's built to detect things you realize what this word is it's a detector it's built to detect the trash and unbelief and doubt the creeps into our lives now listen when that when that when that this when that beeper goes off big big you got one or two options you can behave yourself step aside let them search you get on your plane or throw a fit and go to jail you got two options got two options remember this school said one time he said he was going to Israel and he said he was going to there and they were checking his Bible checking his computer he finally said this is just ridiculous he said this is crazy she said you're the one getting on the plane not me he said I kind of stepped back thought well maybe I ought to get a little more security if it's me getting on she's not she could care less if the thing gets hijacked but in other words what I'm saying is this and I'm done the word of God being preached detects things in our life it exposes it I know that I've been preaching long enough to know when you got when you get into something and the church gets real quiet oh you're on the trail your brother Thomas you know what I'm talking about hit something and somebody's facial expression changes you know you near something you know what it is it's not the man Discerning brother about him the Messiah sign is not to be reimbursemented into being made of Pope Joe that was here to identify a prophet the word is the discerner so as the word is going forth it begins to detect the unbelief it begins to detect the trash and then all of a sudden that word begins to go b b b b b and you got one of two options you can say Lord I'm sorry forgive me I want to make it right I'm wrong your word is right or your other options blow up and get mad and go home don't come back Church somebody breathe in here or something [Applause] when the word exposes the devil I'm just going to go ahead and say you're automatically free see when that word exposes that devil and you recognize it and you start hearing that b b you don't have to make a decision do I Want to Be Free you're already free the decision you make is do I want to move on or get mad and go back y'all remember the story brother Brian says there in the in the meeting he's Discerning and he says you soldier boy you come here he said the devil's lying to you renounce that devil you're not going to commit suicide you're going to go home and be a real man we have that on tape for years and never understood it till brother mystical brought some light to it and told us that brother Brandon was actually with him in a restaurant and the young man and the doctor because the boy had been in the mental hospital the young man and the doctor brings the brings the boy down uh to the to the meeting then they come to the restaurant and the boys in the mental hospital because she's going to commit suicide he's lost his mind and brother man comes in and they walk in and the boy says can I have a moment with you and brother bisco said I watched him as brother random and the Soulja Boy walked down the sidewalk and as they're walking he said all of a sudden I saw something change he said that young boy began to take his fist and he began to pump it in the air he began to say I'm free I'm free I'm free said he turned around walk back said I'm free I'm free he said he got in the car brother Let's go ask brother about him he said what was that about he said brother Eddie he said the Holy Spirit exposed something he said batboy has been in the military said he got involved in a homosexuality lifestyle said he's married got kids said he's in a mental hospital the devil's telling him he's going to commit suicide he's gone too far he said that he's free he said that thing was renounced he's going to go home and be different and brother bisco brothers bisco rehearsals a little a little powerful point he said mother looked at him and said brother Eddie he said the very minute the devil is exposed is the men of the person is free that's enough to shout hallelujah the very minute the devil is exposed is the very minute that you are free you say really right now this morning some of you all the devil's been on your Trail he's been in your mind but the word of God has exposed that devil this morning and you say brother Andrew that devil is exposed and why don't you stand up and accept your freedom as a free Son of God as a free dog you say but then do nobody slay their hands on me I don't have to lay my hands on you when the word exposes the devil you're free when the word exposes the depression you're free and the word exposes the lie you're free when the word exposes the devil you are free of that devil amen the word exposes the devil and corrects that devil that's right you're free amen you're the Plenty of Fish a little bit you're free this morning you're free the word has made you free the word the preaching of the message of the hour is the correct in the air listen friends if this message could correct the air of the godhead could correct the air and Serpentine I believe this message over our life is correct the errors of our life how profit it pronounces we stand our feet this morning you are the sinless Justified bride of Jesus Christ it's as though you never done it in the first place free free free [Applause] free other than I don't feel free free the word the word remember said the word is what frees the church I remember I remember we had how I'm trying to quit but y'all still put a little bit I mean we had an attorney there in Kingsport Tennessee y'all I grew up here in the hills of East Tennessee and we had an attorney there I won't call his name but he was a he was a pretty famous guy you know he he had a reputation of getting people out of anything you know and he he had this one case it's a it's still a story told around town he had this one case and in this case he had he this guy was up for I think murder or something and they I mean they're gonna put him away for life you know so he even hired this this attorney this guy would do things that I would not even mention in a church let alone I mean I would mention he would do things in the courtroom to just get the judge's attention off of this and then the case you know so they had this guy in this real big case downtown and they had the court reporters the news reporters out front and the the day the verdict was coming in all these things you know was going to happen so they're all out there you know they're ready well this guy's fishing go away for life I mean if if this attorney don't do something he gone you know I mean for good so he goes in there and while he's in there they're all out there they wouldn't let the news reporters go inside the cape inside the core so all of a sudden and I won't even go tell you what this guy done this time to win this case but rather in the middle of it right before they went to decide on the verdict the attorney stands up that's something walks out comes back in sits down a few hours later they're out there front they said the verdict's in the verdict's in and all of a sudden all of a sudden the the doors and the court just bust open you know and this guy just comes dancing out of the courthouse I mean just twirling like this well it's the guy that's on trial I mean he's running I mean he literally running down the down Center streets jumping and screaming and so one news reporter she's checking around you know she got up she said wait a second what's going on in there she said he said I don't know he said the last word I heard was free the last word I heard was free she said you didn't stay for nothing else he said no the last word I heard was free she said you didn't stay for the just hit the gavel you didn't he said no the last word I heard was free and if I was free it was time to move on come on Church you know what you need to do this morning you need to hear the
