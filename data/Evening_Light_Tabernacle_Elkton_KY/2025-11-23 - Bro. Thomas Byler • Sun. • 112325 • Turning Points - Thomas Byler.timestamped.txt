[49:38] despised few. Well, I've started with
[49:42] Jesus and I'm going through
[50:25] I walked
[50:28] up whispering
[50:31] forever. rest.
[50:35] Not a man
[50:37] made sound could I hear
[50:44] attit
[50:49] was playing
[50:52] there
[50:54] without
[50:56] a sign of fear
[51:03] &gt;&gt; I
[51:06] alone
[51:08] up a mountain
[51:13] &gt;&gt; and looked
[51:15] out over
[51:17] the sea.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; I saw
[51:24] an eagle
[51:27] spread
[51:29] it wings
[51:31] in flight.
[51:34] So gracefully
[51:40] I knew
[51:43] that I
[51:45] was rolling
[51:50] where mortals
[51:53] should
[51:54] not try
[52:01] on the Lord. Lonely
[52:04] mountain.
[52:08] I stopped
[52:10] and thought of God.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; I walked
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I walked
[52:20] &gt;&gt; through a busy
[52:23] city.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; City.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; It was built
[52:28] &gt;&gt; was built
[52:29] &gt;&gt; by men. and ste
[52:34] and steal.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; A young
[52:38] one cries
[52:40] and all
[52:45] and love
[52:47] and hate are real.
[52:54] I knew
[52:56] that I
[52:58] was walking
[53:03] where many
[53:06] men
[53:08] have tried.
[53:13] There
[53:14] in the busy
[53:17] city,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; I stopped
[53:24] and thought
[53:26] of
[53:28] God.
[53:42] morning, didn't you? Let's stand and
[53:44] sing that song. My hope is in the Lord
[53:46] this morning as we invite Brother Thomas
[53:48] out. Amen. Is your hope in the Lord this
[53:51] morning?
[53:53] Is your hope in the Lord this morning?
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:57] Amen.
[54:00] I stand
[54:02] within the presence of the Lord.
[54:08] In whom the wisdom of the air
[54:13] just flies.
[54:15] Oh yes. For whom the
[54:19] boo
[54:21] subsides.
[54:23] The living sacrifice.
[54:28] The only hope
[54:30] of life. Oh my hope. Oh yes,
[54:35] is in the Lord.
[54:39] From this time on
[54:43] and ever more.
[54:46] Oh my hope
[54:50] is in the Lord
[54:54] forever more. I love this verse here.
[55:02] His tender mercies come with every
[55:06] rising sun
[55:09] to meet the sinner in his brokenness
[55:17] to offer healing and forgiveiveness.
[55:25] And those who trust in him will find
[55:29] their hearts
[55:31] at rest. Oh my hope
[55:36] is in the Lord. God bless you. You don't
[55:39] want to
[55:44] forever more.
[55:47] Oh my hope
[55:51] is in the love
[55:55] forever more. Let's sing it one more
[55:57] time, shall we?
[56:01] I hope
[56:05] is in the Lord
[56:09] from this time on
[56:13] forever more.
[56:16] Oh my hope
[56:20] is in the love
[56:24] forever more.
[56:29] Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord
[56:32] Jesus.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:36] Amen. There is not one hope left for
[56:40] this world but the coming of the Lord
[56:42] Jesus. That's the only hope that there
[56:45] is. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Good
[56:48] morning. It's good to be in the house of
[56:49] the Lord. Thank you, musicians. Amen.
[56:52] Appreciate it. Y'all can be seated for
[56:53] just a minute. Got a couple
[56:55] announcements I'd like to make. Amen.
[56:59] There'll be no service this coming
[57:01] Wednesday as usual on Thanksgiving. We
[57:04] don't have it on our midweek. So, we
[57:06] want everybody to just remember that.
[57:09] Also, um,
[57:11] sister
[57:13] Betty's arrangement. Uh, let's start
[57:16] with the, uh, viewing. The viewing will
[57:18] be held this afternoon from 2 to 4 and
[57:21] from 6:00 to 8 at 102 Menanite Church
[57:25] Road, Franklin, Kentucky. Amen. 102.
[57:28] Everybody say 102.
[57:31] And you can Menite Church Road. Amen.
[57:34] And that that's all you got to punch in
[57:35] or I believe anyway. Amen. So, uh, to
[57:39] get you over there, it's probably just
[57:41] on the other side of Russellville, a
[57:42] little bit past Mary, Jane, and them.
[57:44] Amen. Just a little past there. So,
[57:47] anyway, anybody wants to go to Ever this
[57:50] afternoon, I'll be going over there for
[57:51] a little bit today and then speaking a
[57:53] little bit at it tomorrow also at the
[57:55] funeral, which will be at 11 o'clock in
[57:58] the morning. Amen. So, 11 o'clock. So,
[58:01] we certainly are going to miss Sister
[58:04] Betty. Amen. Amen. So
[58:08] let's stand if you will. We'll just have
[58:09] a moment of silence to remember her. 82
[58:12] years old I believe she was. Amen. And
[58:15] so Amen. And always something special
[58:18] when God takes mothers. Amen. Because
[58:21] they have a very very special role in
[58:22] this world. So let's bow our heads and
[58:24] remember Sister Betty.
[58:39] Kind heavenly father, we come before
[58:41] you, Lord, and we want to remember
[58:43] brother David, Lord Jesus,
[58:46] her husband, father, as she's dealing,
[58:49] Lord, with a very deep pain.
[58:54] And
[58:57] our heart goes out to him. Father,
[59:03] we pray you'd bring comfort, Lord,
[59:04] through your word and through your
[59:06] scriptures.
[59:08] Father,
[59:10] that he might have consolation knowing,
[59:12] God, that it's not the end.
[59:15] That your word just as sure as you rose
[59:18] from the dead, you're going to raise all
[59:19] those that are in Christ. We're going to
[59:21] meet once again, Lord. Our bodies will
[59:24] come from the dust of the earth, changed
[59:26] to immortality.
[59:28] into eternal beings and not creatures of
[59:31] time. So when we ask God that you would
[59:34] just comfort him Lord Jesus, the rest of
[59:36] the family, brother Woody and Michelle
[59:38] and all of them, all of their children,
[59:40] Lord, just bring comfort to them, Lord
[59:41] Jesus, for we know truly that there's
[59:45] only one truly that can comfort them and
[59:47] that's you. That's your word from us, a
[59:50] promise that you have given us, Lord.
[59:52] And we ask God that you be with that
[59:53] family now in a special way in Jesus
[59:55] name, Father. And also we ask God that
[59:58] as we open your Bible this morning, we
[1:00:00] ask Lord Jesus that you would help me
[1:00:01] get out of the way that you would speak
[1:00:04] to our hearts, Father, directly. We know
[1:00:07] that you deal not so much with the
[1:00:09] church as you do deal with individuals.
[1:00:12] So uh Father, we believe God that you'll
[1:00:14] deal with individuals this morning.
[1:00:17] Individual hearts you'll speak to.
[1:00:20] Father, we ask God that each one would
[1:00:22] have a ear to hear what the spirit saith
[1:00:26] to the church this morning, Father. And
[1:00:28] Lord, we ask God for you to come in a
[1:00:31] special way now in this thanksgiving
[1:00:32] message. Just take every part of the
[1:00:35] thoughts that I've thought and what I
[1:00:37] feel like you've laid upon my heart to
[1:00:39] speak. We ask your blessing, Lord, in
[1:00:41] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. my my
[1:00:47] thanksgiving message as I want to call
[1:00:49] it this morning. It's going to be Amen.
[1:00:55] Also, if you want to put it up, Amen. I
[1:00:57] just this came to me, Amen. when I begin
[1:01:00] to think about this was actually about a
[1:01:02] week ago.
[1:01:04] Uh I thought about calling it turning
[1:01:07] points. Have you got the rest of that
[1:01:08] title or no? All right. All right. And I
[1:01:11] also wrote there it's going to be a
[1:01:14] study a study teaching perhaps however
[1:01:18] the spirit leads on brother Brandham's
[1:01:21] thanksgiving message. Brother Brandham
[1:01:23] brought us a thanksgiving message. Amen.
[1:01:26] And so I want to kind of bring some
[1:01:27] quotes out of that and go from there.
[1:01:30] And amen. It's
[1:01:33] it's quite a message. Amen. The same as
[1:01:36] shalom was. And uh so we just pray that
[1:01:39] God will bless it in a special way. If
[1:01:41] you will turn your Bibles this morning,
[1:01:43] I think we'll begin and I want to begin
[1:01:45] with with thankfulness.
[1:01:49] Amen. Thankfulness since we're
[1:01:51] celebrating Thanksgiving. Amen. Here in
[1:01:54] a few days. So let's turn to Romans 1.
[1:01:59] Romans 1.
[1:02:11] I called it turning points because
[1:02:15] we spoke a little bit Wednesday on
[1:02:17] navigation, how to each one of us, our
[1:02:20] vehicles and if it wouldn't be for maps
[1:02:22] or navigation, we wouldn't know how to
[1:02:24] get from one place to the other. And
[1:02:26] Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:02:28] and the life. No man comes to the father
[1:02:29] but by me." Amen. And all that are led
[1:02:32] by the spirit of God, they are sons of
[1:02:34] God. So that Holy Spirit, amen,
[1:02:37] navigates us and help us na navigate
[1:02:39] through all the different twists and
[1:02:41] turns of life, the hardships and things
[1:02:43] that come. Amen. And so, and I said a
[1:02:47] lot of times that people fail to make
[1:02:49] turns when God turns because as the
[1:02:51] prophet of God brought out, he says, you
[1:02:53] know, we're not just building a straight
[1:02:54] wall. We're, you know, we have to make
[1:02:57] turns. Amen. And same way with the
[1:02:58] roads. If if you're going down the road,
[1:03:00] you can't keep going straight if there's
[1:03:02] a curve there or you're going to wreck
[1:03:04] up. And that's unfortunately what a lot
[1:03:06] of uh people have done through time.
[1:03:09] Ain't that right? God would send an
[1:03:11] angel. He would send a messenger. Ain't
[1:03:14] that right? Amen. And and uh I think uh
[1:03:18] y'all remember I don't want to bring up
[1:03:21] a sore subject, but y'all remember uh
[1:03:24] there is even a group called Pettes. The
[1:03:28] Pette group. Hell. Have you heard of
[1:03:30] that?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Plet groups. Leonard and them.
[1:03:33] They got all deceived by all of that.
[1:03:35] Amen. And so, and I went and heard them
[1:03:38] one time and heard heard heard it. And
[1:03:41] so, they Anyway, we won't go down that
[1:03:43] road, but just people denominate on just
[1:03:46] a certain thing and they stop there.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And they don't keep
[1:03:50] going. It happened in Luther's day. It
[1:03:53] happened in Wesley's day. happened in
[1:03:55] Pentecostals. They were they got so much
[1:03:57] of the truth and they put a period
[1:03:58] behind what they believed and that's
[1:04:00] where they stopped. But God keeps moving
[1:04:02] on. He gives more deeper and greater
[1:04:04] revelation. Ain't that right? And when
[1:04:07] you stop like the Pharisees did. Ain't
[1:04:09] that right? They had absolutely what God
[1:04:11] ordained them to do, but they become a
[1:04:13] tradition and they added their own
[1:04:15] ideas, their own uh what did Jesus call
[1:04:18] it? He says, "You teach the doctrines of
[1:04:20] men, you know, as the commandments of
[1:04:23] God, and you make the word of God of
[1:04:25] none effect." And look at the condition
[1:04:26] they got into.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because they feel
[1:04:30] failed to go on with God. So, it's a
[1:04:33] it's it's it's a it's a even Jesus
[1:04:36] expressed it when he says, you know, you
[1:04:38] can discern the signs of the time. I
[1:04:40] mean, the sky, but you can't discern the
[1:04:42] signs of the time. Amen. And we'll get
[1:04:44] into some of that here in a little bit.
[1:04:46] Amen. and when talking about why people
[1:04:48] miss God. Isn't that right? Amen. And we
[1:04:51] don't want to do that. We want to say,
[1:04:52] "God, don't never put me a period behind
[1:04:54] what I believe, but Lord, show me more."
[1:04:57] Amen. Because there's more to be shown.
[1:04:59] Okay. Let's talk about thankfulness for
[1:05:01] just a minute. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:06] Amen. I called it uh let me see what I
[1:05:08] did here.
[1:05:10] Thankfulness, gratefulness,
[1:05:12] appreciation, an attitude of gratitude
[1:05:14] is part of worshiping God. Amen. How
[1:05:18] many know thankfulness is part of
[1:05:21] worshiping God?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, let me just give you real
[1:05:26] quick. I won't keep you too long
[1:05:28] standing. Okay, bear with me.
[1:05:31] Amen. If I can find it. Amen. And I
[1:05:34] believe it said in for Revelations 4,
[1:05:37] just bearing out that thanks is part of
[1:05:39] worship. And when those beasts gave
[1:05:42] glory and honor and thanks. Amen. Part
[1:05:47] of worship. And and thanks to him that
[1:05:50] sat on the throne who liveth forever and
[1:05:54] ever.
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:06:07] 1 Thessalonians 5:18
[1:06:10] Paul says, "In everything give thanks
[1:06:14] for this is the will of God of God in
[1:06:17] Christ Jesus concerning you." Amen. How
[1:06:20] many believe we ought to be thankful?
[1:06:23] Amen. Romans 1 and verse 21 says,
[1:06:25] "Because that when they knew God, they
[1:06:28] glorified him not as God and neither
[1:06:32] were thankful." How many knows that the
[1:06:36] an attitude of unthankfulness
[1:06:38] takes you down a terrible road?
[1:06:41] Amen. It become you become
[1:06:43] unappreciative,
[1:06:46] ungrateful,
[1:06:48] grouchy. You become a complainer, a
[1:06:51] murmurer.
[1:06:53] Amen.
[1:06:55] Now, how many knows that the devil when
[1:06:58] he was God's right-hand man, when he was
[1:07:00] up in heaven right beside God, he became
[1:07:03] unthankful.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] He became unthankful. He didn't
[1:07:10] appreciate it anymore, the position that
[1:07:12] he had and where he was at.
[1:07:15] Amen. He wanted more. He become jealous
[1:07:17] of God. Want it more.
[1:07:20] Look at where he's at today.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] Okay. And neither were thankful, but
[1:07:26] became in their vain, in their
[1:07:28] imaginations, and their foolish heart
[1:07:29] was darkened. Professing themselves to
[1:07:31] be wise, they became fools. May God add
[1:07:34] his blessings to the reading of the
[1:07:36] word. You can be comfortable.
[1:07:43] Amen.
[1:07:46] Second Timothy says, 'I know this also,
[1:07:48] this know also that in the last days
[1:07:51] perilous times shall come.
[1:07:55] For men shall be lovers of their own
[1:07:57] selves. Amen.
[1:08:00] Covetous,
[1:08:02] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:08:06] disobedient to parents, unthankful,
[1:08:10] unholy,
[1:08:12] unthankful,
[1:08:15] unholy, without natural affection, truce
[1:08:18] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:08:21] fierce, despises of those that are good,
[1:08:25] heady, I mean traitors, heady,
[1:08:29] high-minded,
[1:08:30] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:08:33] God.
[1:08:36] What is the great commandment? There is
[1:08:38] one God. And thou shalt love the Lord
[1:08:41] thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
[1:08:45] soul, with all thy strength. One of the
[1:08:48] first commandments ever given was that
[1:08:50] you're supposed to love God above
[1:08:52] everything
[1:08:54] else.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; How many appreciates? Amen. A God. Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was driving down my driveway
[1:09:02] today and I said, "Honey, I tell you
[1:09:04] what, I thank God for another day. When
[1:09:06] you get a little older, you thank God
[1:09:09] for every day that you have
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; cuz like Sister Betty, one of these
[1:09:14] days, we won't have any more days.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; No, you come to your last day. You're
[1:09:20] done. You're done in this world." Amen.
[1:09:25] And we want to prepare for that time.
[1:09:28] WE WANT TO BE READY FOR THAT TIME. I
[1:09:30] don't care what age you are. Be ready
[1:09:32] for that time.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And be thankful for every day that
[1:09:37] God gives you.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And not just for every day,
[1:09:44] but everything.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT GOD GIVES US. AMEN.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he created all
[1:09:54] things and without whether his
[1:09:56] principalities or powers or dominion,
[1:09:58] things present, ALL THINGS WERE CREATED
[1:10:01] FOR HIM AND BY him and without him was
[1:10:04] not anything made that was made.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. HOW MANY KNOWS EVERYTHING WE SEE,
[1:10:13] everything material, he made it all.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. HE MADE MY ELBOW. HE
[1:10:19] MADE MY WRISTS. HE MAKES MY FINGERS. He
[1:10:21] made my mouth. HE MADE EVERYTHING THAT
[1:10:23] WE ARE. WE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL.
[1:10:29] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:10:31] That's right. Amen. An attitude of
[1:10:35] gratitude WILL GO A LONG WAY. I'M HERE
[1:10:38] TO TELL YOU, THIS WORLD DOESN'T
[1:10:41] APPRECIATE GOD.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus with DIRTY FEET. REMEMBER, EVEN
[1:10:47] Simon mistreated him.
[1:10:50] AMEN. THE PHARISEES TRIED TO KILL HIM.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; ARE THE MOST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OF THAT
[1:10:56] DAY. AND WE WANT TO talk about that a
[1:10:58] little bit because we know that Satan's
[1:11:00] in the realm of religion.
[1:11:03] This morning, WE WANT TO COVER COVER
[1:11:05] SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR DAY.
[1:11:07] WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR DAY.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. What Jesus did in OUR DAY. IT'S
[1:11:13] IMPORTANT BECAUSE REMEMBER IF YOU MISS
[1:11:16] WHAT GOD IS DOING IN YOUR DAY, you miss
[1:11:19] God.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; THOSE PHARISEES MISSED IT.
[1:11:24] AMEN. Even Jesus SAID, HE SAID HE WEPT.
[1:11:28] AMEN. AND SAID, "OH, JERUSALEM,
[1:11:30] JERUSALEM, HOW I WOULD HAVE HELD THEE AS
[1:11:33] A HAND DESERT BROOD, BUT you would not."
[1:11:38] MAY I SAY AS A SERVANT OF GOD THIS
[1:11:41] MORNING, THIS WORLD, THIS GENERATION, HE
[1:11:44] WOULD HAVE HOVERED YOU. HE SHOWED YOU
[1:11:46] INFALLIBLE PROOFS THAT HE WAS ALIVE. HE
[1:11:49] DISCERNED THE THOUGHTS INTENTS OF THE
[1:11:50] HEART. HE TOLD PEOPLE WHERE THEIR NAMES
[1:11:52] WAS AND ALL WHERE THEY COME FROM. AMEN.
[1:11:55] THERE WAS NO QUESTION
[1:11:57] JESUS MADE HIMSELF. HE WAS MORE REAL IN

[1:13:03] OF JESUS CHRIST THROUGH THE PROPHET.
[1:13:05] AMEN. IN OUR DAY RIGHT THERE.
[1:13:11] That was God.
[1:13:17] AMEN. I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU PEOPLE.
[1:13:19] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PICTURE, WHAT DO
[1:13:22] YOU SEE?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; What do YOU SEE? ISN'T THAT A GOOD
[1:13:27] QUESTION? OH MAN, YOU'VE GOT A PICTURE
[1:13:30] OF A MAN UP IN front of YOUR CHURCH.
[1:13:34] YOU'RE FOLLOWING A MAN. IS THAT WHAT you
[1:13:36] see?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; You need to LOOK A LITTLE HARDER
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT PICTURE HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN
[1:13:42] TAKEN. AMEN. BY MR. BEST IN THE MEETING
[1:13:44] THAT HE WAS HAVING AND HE WANTED TO
[1:13:46] CRITICIZE BROTHER BANNON. PUT HIS FINGER
[1:13:48] UP IN HIS NOSE AND HE WAS GOING TO
[1:13:49] PUBLISH IT IN THE PAPER NEXT DAY THAT HE
[1:13:51] DROVE THAT MAN OUT OF TOWN THAT HE
[1:13:53] REPROVED THAT MAN. AND HE TOOK A BUNCH
[1:13:56] OF PICTURES AFTER IT ALL WENT DOWN. AND
[1:13:58] THAT'S THE ONLY PICTURE THAT WAS
[1:14:00] DEVELOPED WAS A PICTURE OF THE PILLAR OF
[1:14:02] FIRE ON TOP OF HIS HEAD. AMEN. THE
[1:14:04] GOVERNMENT SAID THERE IS NO QUESTION
[1:14:07] ABOUT IT. THAT'S I DON'T SEE A MAN. I
[1:14:10] SEE GOD ALMIGHTY. THE SAME PILLAR OF
[1:14:13] FIRE. AMEN. THAT LET THE CHILDREN THAT'S
[1:14:15] WHY I'M NOT ASHAMED TO HAVE MY GOD
[1:14:18] HANGING ON MY WALL.
[1:14:20] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME PILLAR
[1:14:22] OF FIRE THAT PAUL SAW WHEN HE SAID THAT
[1:14:25] IT WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE GREAT LIGHT.
[1:14:27] THAT'S THAT SAME LIGHT.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth. Right, brother
[1:14:35] Joe?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing but the truth. I
[1:14:38] People have gotten healed believing that
[1:14:40] picture. People have been con completely
[1:14:43] condemned by condemning that picture. So
[1:14:45] be careful what you do with it.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; God didn't let all the other pictures
[1:14:53] not be developed except that one for no
[1:14:55] reason. Right.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; He was vindicating. I'm with this man.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I'M LIKE WITH HIM LIKE I WAS WITH MOSES.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; MARY AND AARON SPOKE A LITTLE BIT
[1:15:06] AGAINST MOSES. MADE A LITTLE FUN OF HIM
[1:15:08] AND THEY GOT LEPROSY OR SICKNESS. Isn't
[1:15:10] that right? I believe IT WAS LEPROSY.
[1:15:12] THEY WERE FIXING TO DIE.
[1:15:15] OH, if there's a prophet in the land, I
[1:15:17] might speak to him in visions. This that
[1:15:19] or the other. But there's NONE LIKE
[1:15:20] MOSES. I SPEAK to him lip to hear. How
[1:15:23] many KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE GOT
[1:15:25] SPOKEN TO LIP TO EAR. AMEN. BEFORE GOD
[1:15:28] IS GOING TO BURN THIS WORLD BEFORE
[1:15:30] THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UNMERCIFUL WRATH
[1:15:32] OF GOD POURED OUT UPON THIS WORLD LIKE

[1:15:43] AMEN. SO THAT you wouldn't HAVE TO HAVE
[1:15:45] ONE DOUBT. OH, I DON'T HAVE ONE DOUBT,
[1:15:47] BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. WHY? BECAUSE WE
[1:15:49] POINTED US AND BROUGHT US BACK TO THE
[1:15:51] WORD OF GOD, NOT HIMSELF. NOT JUST TO
[1:15:54] START ANOTHER EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE.
[1:15:55] NOT TO DRAW PEOPLE AFTER HIM, BUT TO
[1:15:58] POINT YOU TO CHRIST.
[1:16:05] Point us to Christ.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:16:23] GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. AND

[1:16:27] THE FATHERS, AND THE HEARTS OF THE
[1:16:28] CHILDREN BACK TO THE FATHER. HEART OF
[1:16:30] THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN, AND THE
[1:16:32] CHILDREN BACK TO THE FATHERS.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; AM I LOOKING AT A PRODUCT OF THAT OR
[1:16:38] WHAT?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, PEOPLE.
[1:16:42] I'M LOOKING AT A PRODUCT. I AM LOOKING
[1:16:44] FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT SCRIPTURE
[1:16:48] FULFILLED.
[1:16:50] I WILL RESTORE ALL THAT THE PALMER WORM
[1:16:53] HAS EATEN THE CATERPILLAR. AMEN. I WILL
[1:16:55] RESTORE, SAYETH THE LORD. HOW MANY
[1:16:57] BELIEVES THAT I'M LOOKING AT A RESTORED
[1:17:00] PEOPLE?
[1:17:01] WE HAVE BEEN RESTORED BACK TO THE
[1:17:03] ORIGINAL WORD.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand something. This
[1:17:14] is a message that God sent
[1:17:17] is the clothes that's going to be fit to
[1:17:22] go in the rapture. It's going to dress
[1:17:24] you in the clothes that you need.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO WASH US WHITE. IT'S GOING
[1:17:31] TO MAKE US PURE.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO BE PURE WITHOUT SPOT,
[1:17:36] WITHOUT WRINKLE. CUZ THAT BIBLE SAYS IN
[1:17:39] EPHESIANS THERE THAT CHRIST DID THAT FOR
[1:17:41] US. Oh my. I'm going to go ahead and
[1:17:44] take time to read that. Would I would
[1:17:46] that okay? I just don't have it wrote
[1:17:48] down, but I think it would be very good
[1:17:57] just to read it because it's part of my
[1:17:59] message this morning. Amen.
[1:18:02] Listen to this. Husbands, love your
[1:18:04] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:18:06] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:18:08] might sanctify it and cleanse it with
[1:18:10] the washing of the water by the word. We
[1:18:13] could stop there for the rest of today.
[1:18:15] How many believes if you don't have a
[1:18:16] clean word? IF YOU GOT, WELL, GOD DON'T
[1:18:18] REALLY MEAN WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:20] GOING TO GET CLEAN. THIS DON'T REALLY
[1:18:22] MATTER AND THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER.
[1:18:24] QUIT LYING, DEVIL. YOU TOLD EVE THAT
[1:18:26] SAME THING. THAT AIN'T GOING TO CLEAN
[1:18:29] NOTHING. BUT WE'RE HAVE A PURE WORD THAT
[1:18:31] TELLS YOU THAT GOD COME TO CLEANSE YOU.
[1:18:34] THAT WHEN HE DIED ON CALVARY, THAT BLOOD
[1:18:36] WAS FOR THIS REMISSION OF YOUR SIN. THAT
[1:18:38] IF YOU ACTUALLY CONFESS YOUR SINS,
[1:18:41] REPENT.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LET GOD COME DOWN INTO YOUR
[1:18:45] HEART AND WASH YOU WHITE.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE CLEANSING AND THAT IS
[1:18:49] BY TELLING YOU THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD
[1:18:51] OF GOD THAT SAID HE DIED FOR YOUR SINS.
[1:18:53] IF YOU'LL REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU AND BE
[1:18:55] BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR
[1:18:57] THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS, GOD WILL
[1:18:59] WASH YOU CLEAN AND HE'LL FILL YOU WITH
[1:19:01] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THE
[1:19:03] PROMISE IS TO YOU TO YOUR CHILDREN TO
[1:19:05] THEM THAT ARE ALL THE WAY DOWN IN 2025.
[1:19:08] IT'S FOR US THIS MORNING. IT'LL BE FOR
[1:19:11] TOMORROW IF GOD CARRIES.
[1:19:14] THAT'S THE WAY. THAT'S SALVATION.
[1:19:17] THERE'S NO OTHER SALVATION IN ANY OTHER
[1:19:19] NAME except for in Jesus Christ. There's
[1:19:22] no name given under heaven whereby you
[1:19:25] must be saved.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] Amen. Washing of the water by the word
[1:19:37] that he might present it to HIMSELF A
[1:19:39] GLORIOUS CHURCH.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES WE'RE PART OF THAT?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SENT A PROPHET TO
[1:19:48] RESTORE US BACK TO WHAT PAUL SAID. AND
[1:19:51] WHEN HE WENT ON THE CURTAIN OF TIME AND
[1:19:53] HE SEEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND HE THE
[1:19:56] ANGEL TOLD HIM, HE SAYS, "YOU'RE GOING
[1:19:58] TO HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR WHAT YOU
[1:19:59] PREACHED, MAN. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:20:01] BE JUDGED FOR WHAT YOU PREACHED."
[1:20:04] Brother Bam said, "Will Paul have to be
[1:20:07] judged for what he preached?"
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Angel said, "Yep, he's going to HAVE TO
[1:20:13] BE JUDGED FOR WHAT HE PREACHED. EVERY
[1:20:14] ANGEL'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR
[1:20:16] WHAT HE PREACHED." AND VAN SAID, "WELL,
[1:20:18] PRAISE BE TO GOD. IF HIS GROUP MAKES IT,
[1:20:21] MINE WILL, TOO, BECAUSE I PREACH JUST
[1:20:24] WHAT PAUL PREACHED."
[1:20:30] WOO!
[1:20:32] And millions,
[1:20:34] MILLIONS.
[1:20:37] WOO! HERE'S A LITTLE GROUP RIGHT HERE.
[1:20:39] MILLIONS CRIED OUT, "WE'RE RESTING ON
[1:20:42] THAT.
[1:20:44] WE'RE RESTING ON THAT." HOW MANY OF
[1:20:46] THESE WE'RE RESTING ON THAT HE PREACHED
[1:20:48] WHAT PAUL PREACHED?
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You love him this morning.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to get more
[1:21:05] comfortable. I can't work in these
[1:21:08] clothes.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. AREN'T YOU
[1:21:14] GLAD FOR THAT?
[1:21:17] OH, millions cried out.
[1:21:21] You dropped dead. You're a message
[1:21:24] believer. Follow the message. Amen. Cuz
[1:21:27] remember what the angel said? He says,
[1:21:29] "This is your people that you've been
[1:21:31] gathered to. These are all brandoms."
[1:21:34] He said, "Your people."
[1:21:38] I don't know how Bill Brandham couldn't
[1:21:39] mistake it. That's a bunch of Brandhams.
[1:21:43] He thought that was his family.
[1:21:48] I must have, right, Brother Brad? It's
[1:21:50] only logical to think he THOUGHT THESE
[1:21:52] WERE YOUR PEOPLE, YOUR FAMILY. A lot of
[1:21:54] your family MADE IT. NO. THE ANGEL SAYS,
[1:21:56] "UH-UH.
[1:21:58] That's not what we're talking about.
[1:21:59] These are your coverage."
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That you led to the
[1:22:03] Lord.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT'S ONE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
[1:22:06] LADY COME UP, GIVE HIM A big hug,
[1:22:10] and the angel said, "Do you remember
[1:22:11] her?" No, I don't remember her. She was
[1:22:16] past 80 years old.
[1:22:18] Hello. She wasn't young and beautiful
[1:22:21] then. No, she was old and wrinkled AND
[1:22:24] EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT SHE WAS SO OLD.
[1:22:26] AMEN. AND SHE SAID, "OUR PRECIOUS
[1:22:27] BROTHER, THAT'S WHY SHE YOU MEAN SO MUCH
[1:22:29] TO HER BECAUSE YOU LED HER TO CHRIST
[1:22:33] ALL THOSE YEARS. FOR 80 YEARS, SHE
[1:22:36] didn't know you, BUT HE LED HER TO
[1:22:38] CHRIST."
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:43] THAT'S WHY PRECIOUS BROTHER.
[1:22:47] AMEN.
[1:22:49] See folks, how many knows? Read
[1:22:51] Revelation. Seven stars, seven church
[1:22:53] ages. The seven stars are my seven
[1:22:56] angels. Ain't that right? Seven
[1:22:58] messengers.
[1:23:03] I am so thankful this morning that I
[1:23:06] haven't gotten my own message.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Hello. Brother Bam didn't have his own
[1:23:10] message.
[1:23:12] No, he had to come and re and deliver
[1:23:15] God's message.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; How many believes what I say has to be
[1:23:19] God's message.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to WORRY ANYMORE. WE
[1:23:24] DON'T HAVE TO AMEN. PUT ANYTHING OF OUR
[1:23:27] OWN TO IT ANYMORE.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Don't put anything of your own ideas.
[1:23:33] THAT'S WHY WE GOT TRACTORS OUT HERE WITH
[1:23:35] STEEL WHEELS RUNNING AROUND. THAT'S
[1:23:37] RIGHT, MENANITES. LISTEN CLOSELY. YOU'RE
[1:23:40] RUNNING AROUND WITH STEEL WHEELS BECAUSE
[1:23:41] THAT'S WHAT YOUR BISHOP SAYS. THAT'S
[1:23:43] WHAT YOU ALL SAID. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE
[1:23:45] BIBLE SAID.
[1:23:47] AND THEN DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TODD
[1:23:49] COUNTY, THEY CAN HAVE TIRES AND AND IF
[1:23:52] YOU AIN'T CAREFUL, THEY'LL PASS YOU ON
[1:23:54] THE ROAD JUST A WOO SINGING TIRES. WOO!
[1:23:57] WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO!
[1:24:00] HELLO. I'LL NEVER FORGET COMING OUT OF
[1:24:02] CLARKSVILLE. THERE WAS A LADY I mean
[1:24:04] there was a tractor with a trailer and
[1:24:05] they were in packed up in the BACK AND I
[1:24:07] DON'T KNOW IT LOOKED LIKE THEY RAN OFF
[1:24:09] THE ROAD A LITTLE BIT AND THAT BACK WAS
[1:24:11] JUST BOUNCING AND I LOOKED AND IT WAS A
[1:24:13] LITTLE OLD LADY DRIVING WITH A BIG OLD
[1:24:15] BONNET LIKE YOU know she was just kind
[1:24:16] of hunched over. I'M LIKE, "OH MY LORD,
[1:24:19] THERE THEY GO."
[1:24:22] HEY, at least they CAN HAVE FUN DRIVING
[1:24:24] A TRACTOR. THEY AIN'T GOT TO BE ON THAT
[1:24:26] HORSE MUGGY ALL THE TIME. HELLO. BUT ALL
[1:24:29] OF THESE TRADITIONS OF MAN, ALL THE
[1:24:32] THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE put in it, how
[1:24:34] many believe WE NEED THE PURE WORD OF
[1:24:36] GOD AND IT'LL PRODUCE PURE WORD RESULTS?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S what we HAVE
[1:24:45] BACK TO THE PURE UNADULTERATED WORD of
[1:24:48] God.
[1:24:51] Amen.
[1:24:54] Praise be to God.
[1:24:58] Let me tell you something. That's why I
[1:24:59] don't remind that that's why I don't
[1:25:01] mind and I'd almost rather read brother
[1:25:04] Brandham's quotes if I'm going to quote
[1:25:06] anything.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he would say, "Now, if I've
[1:25:11] told you the truth and Jesus Christ
[1:25:13] don't come down here and bear record of
[1:25:14] it, you don't have to believe it.
[1:25:17] But if Jesus himself will come down and
[1:25:19] he'll bear record of it by doing what he
[1:25:22] did with the on the shores of Galilee
[1:25:24] with the woman at the well, you've had
[1:25:26] five husbands. The one you're with now
[1:25:28] ain't yours. Ain't that right?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. She wanted a drink of water to
[1:25:32] what I give you. Amen. It'll be of in
[1:25:34] you a well of water springing up into
[1:25:36] everlasting life. He says, "We know that
[1:25:39] when the Messiah comes, he'll show us
[1:25:41] these things." And he said, "I am he
[1:25:44] that speaks to you." BROTHER, I'M HERE
[1:25:46] TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS JUST DIDN'T TELL
[1:25:48] THAT to anybody. BUT HE FELT LED TO TELL
[1:25:50] HER AND she believed him. Ain't that
[1:25:53] right? AMEN. AND AFTERWARD, SHE HAD SUCH
[1:25:55] A FLOWING WELL OF WATER IN HER UNTIL SHE
[1:25:58] RAN INTO THE CITY AND SAID, "NOW, COME
[1:26:01] MEET A MAN THAT HAS TOLD ME EVERYTHING
[1:26:03] I'VE EVER DONE. ISN'T THIS THE VERY
[1:26:05] MESSIAH?" IT WAS THE MESSIAH SIGN THEN,
[1:26:08] IT WAS THE MESSIAH THEN, AND IT'S THE
[1:26:10] MESSIAH NOW.
[1:26:13] AND HE WENT ROUND AND ROUND ALL OVER.
[1:26:14] BROTHER RANDOM MINISTRY ALMOST EVERY
[1:26:16] SERVICE HE'D EVER HAVE HE'D HAVE
[1:26:18] DISCERNMENT OF discernment he'd have
[1:26:20] healing OF THE SICK AND JESUS CHRIST
[1:26:22] WOULD COME DOWN AND PERFORM THESE THINGS
[1:26:24] HE SAYS NOW look
[1:26:32] Brown
[1:26:34] you know what I'm waiting on right
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; you know I'm waiting on
[1:26:39] because I'm helpless
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; I can't do anything myself
[1:26:44] Hello. He has to come. And when he
[1:26:47] comes, HE BEGINS TO USE MY EYES. HE
[1:26:49] BEGINS TO SHOW ME VISIONS. HE BEGINS TO
[1:26:51] SPEAK TO PEOPLE. HE SAYS, "THUS SAY THE
[1:26:53] LORD, YOU'RE HEALED." GOD GETS ALL THE
[1:26:56] GLORY.
[1:26:58] I MEAN, JESUS GETS ALL THE GLORY.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; WHY? WE'RE ALL JUST A MICROPHONE. WE'RE
[1:27:04] JUST A MICROPHONE. WITHOUT IT, we're
[1:27:06] mute.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Can't do nothing without Christ.
[1:27:13] She went into the city and said, "Is
[1:27:14] this the very Messiah?"
[1:27:20] When I think about how unthankful,
[1:27:23] ungrateful
[1:27:25] that people are. People are ungrateful.
[1:27:28] They're unthankful.
[1:27:33] The Pharisees, THEY WERE SO UNTHANKFUL
[1:27:35] THAT WHEN GOD RAISED LAZARUS FROM THE
[1:27:37] DEAD, THEY THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING
[1:27:38] LAZARUS.
[1:27:40] CAN YOU IMAGINE how ungrateful?
[1:27:43] Yet in their heart, Nicodemus knew. We
[1:27:46] know THAT YOU'RE A MAN OF SENT FROM GOD.
[1:27:48] YOU CAN'T YOU COULDN'T DO these things
[1:27:50] unless YOU WAS OF GOD. EVEN JESUS SAID,
[1:27:52] "You you blind leaders of the blind." He
[1:27:57] said, "You you know, you're white at
[1:28:00] sephilicurs. You paint the outside of
[1:28:03] that coffin white and it's all PRETTY
[1:28:05] LOOKING, BUT INSIDE OF THAT COFFIN, IT'S
[1:28:08] BUNCH OF DEAD MEN'S BONES. HE SAID, "IF
[1:28:11] YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE THE
[1:28:13] WORKS."
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; HE TRIED HIS BEST TO CONVINCE THEM.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; OH, and my message this morning is maybe
[1:28:23] those streaming. HELLO.
[1:28:27] GOD CAN ABSOLUTELY COME DOWN AND WE CAN
[1:28:30] TELL YOU GOD SENT US A PROPHET. WE CAN
[1:28:32] SHOW YOU THE PICTURE BACK THERE OF A OF
[1:28:34] THE HALO. WE CAN TELL YOU THE STORY
[1:28:36] BEHIND it
[1:28:38] and you don't give a hoot.
[1:28:41] You don't care enough to really check
[1:28:42] those tapes out. YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH
[1:28:45] to get you a a listen to a sermon AND
[1:28:47] SEE IF THAT WAS REALLY JESUS DOING THAT.
[1:28:50] BECAUSE I'M HERE PROCLAIMING THAT
[1:28:52] THERE'LL BE NO MORE MESSAGES GIVEN TO
[1:28:54] THE GENTILES. AMEN.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; WE'VE RECEIVED THE LAST ONE. THE NEXT
[1:28:59] THING TO FALL IS Putin's
[1:29:03] nukes.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S NEXT IN ORDER?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO BOMB THIS PLACE. HE'S
[1:29:10] GOING TO BOMB ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE
[1:29:13] THAT IN ONE HOUR ROME WILL BE BURNT UP.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; AMERICA'S GOING TO BE BURNT UP.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; THE FIRE'S GOING TO FALL.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY REFUSED. THEY REJECTED
[1:29:24] CHRIST.
[1:29:26] This generation has absolutely rejected
[1:29:29] Jesus Christ.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; THEY REJECTED MERCY.
[1:29:37] I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE MARRIED TWO OR
[1:29:38] THREE TIMES, YOU WAS ALL MESSED UP IN
[1:29:41] YOUR MARRIAGE.
[1:29:43] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT AS LONG AS A WOMAN'S
[1:29:45] HUSBAND, FIRST HUSBAND'S LIVING, SHE
[1:29:47] CAN'T BE REMARRIED
[1:29:50] OR SHE'LL BE CALLED AN ADULTERESS.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:29:55] But there was even mercy for people like
[1:29:57] that. God himself says, "Don't you ever
[1:29:59] do it again. You can be forgiven that,
[1:30:00] but don't you ever do it again." That
[1:30:02] right? MERCY. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE
[1:30:05] MERCY THAT GOD SHOWS US?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; That would have put a lot of people out
[1:30:13] ungrateful.
[1:30:16] Jesus can come along
[1:30:19] and tell you stories of a rich man in
[1:30:21] Lazarus. One had it bad and one had it
[1:30:23] good. By and by they both went by the
[1:30:26] way of the grave. And the rich man
[1:30:27] lifted up his eyes and hell. Ain't that
[1:30:29] right? And he says, "Man, just let
[1:30:33] Lazarus COME OVER AND DIP A LITTLE WATER
[1:30:34] ON MY TONGUE CUZ IT'S SO HOT. It burns
[1:30:38] so much."
[1:30:40] How many has ever burnt their tongue?
[1:30:42] Boy, isn't it painful though?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; It is painful.
[1:30:49] AND HE SAYS, "HAVE SOMEBODY GO BACK.
[1:30:52] SOMEBODY GO TELL MY BROTHERS NOT TO COME
[1:30:55] TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE." THAT'S WHAT WE
[1:30:58] TRY TO DO THIS MORNING. DON'T GO TO THAT
[1:31:00] TERRIBLE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE LOST. YOU
[1:31:02] AIN'T GOT TO GO TO HELL.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; If you go to hell, YOU GO THERE.
[1:31:07] PERSEVERANT.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; DETERMINED. EVERY BARRICADE. THE VOICE
[1:31:13] OF EVERY PREACHER. The voice of EVERY
[1:31:15] SONG.
[1:31:17] GO over top of your conscience.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; You have to go over all of these
[1:31:22] barricades God puts in front of people
[1:31:25] in order to finally get there.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; When I think of the goodness of Jesus
[1:31:36] and all he has done for me,
[1:31:40] he brought me on out of Amish Menonite
[1:31:42] or Baptist.
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:46] How many GLAD TO BE BROUGHT OUT?
[1:31:49] HE HAS BROUGHT ME out
[1:31:53] and he has set me free.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Free from condemnation.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Free from judgment.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And why? It's because I believe
[1:32:06] the pure unadulterated word of God.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. that he might present it
[1:32:16] to himself a glorious church, not having
[1:32:18] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:32:20] it should be holy and without blemish.
[1:32:24] All right,
[1:32:27] let me read you a few quotes. Is that
[1:32:29] all right?
[1:32:36] All right, devil, get out of my iPad.
[1:32:41] It's not supposed to close for 15
[1:32:43] minutes. And it's not supposed to jump
[1:32:45] upside down every time, right? Brother
[1:32:48] Bam says, "I want to pass greetings down
[1:32:50] the line now." 1965.
[1:32:52] Amen. His message, his thanksgiving
[1:32:56] message. Amen. He says, "Greetings down
[1:32:58] the line. Church is now hooked up in the
[1:33:00] states across the states where telephone
[1:33:02] hookup is where this little system we
[1:33:05] have got to through brother Perry
[1:33:06] Green." He says, "From Bumont, Texas."
[1:33:11] Amen. and the churches completely that's
[1:33:13] following the message all the way across
[1:33:15] the United States is hooked up tonight.
[1:33:17] We sent greetings up down the west coat
[1:33:19] all the way to Vancouver down to
[1:33:23] Tijana I guess Tijana Mexico through San
[1:33:27] Joe's Los Angeles all the groups over
[1:33:29] there we greet you from Shriport also
[1:33:31] all the way to Prescott Arizona to the
[1:33:33] groups up there that's waiting on the
[1:33:35] Lord we sent greetings to you Tucson
[1:33:37] Sarav Vista all the way to New York down
[1:33:39] across the nation the Lord bless each
[1:33:42] one of you wish you were here tonight
[1:33:43] this beautiful state of Louis Louisiana
[1:33:46] so he was greeting the people all over
[1:33:49] the United States. He was making a
[1:33:51] proclamation. Amen. He had a message
[1:33:54] from the Lord. How many believe? How
[1:33:56] many likes that? When he's got a certain
[1:33:58] message that he brings to the people.
[1:34:01] Amen. Because we know there was a time
[1:34:03] when brother Brandham would preach to
[1:34:05] the Baptist and the Methodists to all of
[1:34:07] them. HE'D GO EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHERE HE
[1:34:09] COULD COULD GO. AND HE SAYS, "NOW FIND
[1:34:11] YOU A GOOD CHURCH HOME. FIND YOU A PLACE
[1:34:14] TO GO." BUT AROUND 1963 and after the
[1:34:17] seals because brother Brand mentions the
[1:34:19] seals that after the opening of the
[1:34:20] seals you know there was a change in the
[1:34:22] ministry there was a change that took
[1:34:24] place there was a turn because the
[1:34:26] denominations
[1:34:28] denominational churches turned him away
[1:34:33] Jesus could come and discern the
[1:34:34] thoughts and intents of the heart. They
[1:34:35] didn't care. If you go to that church,
[1:34:37] we'll excommunicate you.
[1:34:40] And they did. Some of them. They got to
[1:34:42] that place.
[1:34:44] And you know, sometimes we might think,
[1:34:46] well, you know, brother preacher, you're
[1:34:48] so hard on churches and stuff. But
[1:34:50] listen to what God said in the to the
[1:34:53] age of the church of the Lelayans. He
[1:34:55] says, "The things writ the amen, the
[1:34:57] faithful, true witness, the beginning of
[1:34:59] the creation of God. I know thy works
[1:35:01] that thou are neither cold nor hot. I
[1:35:04] would thou art cold nor hot. So then,
[1:35:06] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:35:08] cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my
[1:35:10] mouth. This is what God says about this
[1:35:12] last age church. BECAUSE THOU SAYS, I AM
[1:35:16] RICH AND INCREASE WITH GOODS, I HAVE
[1:35:18] NEED OF NOTHING.
[1:35:20] I DON'T NEED YOU. I DON'T NEED A
[1:35:22] PROPHET.
[1:35:24] HELLO. When how MANY KNOWS WHEN GOD
[1:35:27] SENDS A PROPHET, IT'S FOR A PURPOSE?
[1:35:29] IT'S FOR A REASON.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S FOR YOUR BLESSING.
[1:35:34] AND TO REJECT IT IS TO BE UNGRATEFUL.
[1:35:36] UNTHANKFUL.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Remember in Tim TIMOTHY THERE IT SAYS
[1:35:41] UNTHANKFUL UNOLY. AMEN. IT SAYS HAVING A
[1:35:44] FORM OF GODLINESS BUT DENYING THE POWER
[1:35:46] THEREOF. IT WAS A CHURCH GROUP THAT HE
[1:35:48] WAS TALKING ABOUT.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; WOO. HELLO. Pretty bad.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; So he SAYS RICH AND KNOWEST NOT THAT
[1:35:56] THOU ART WRETCHED AND MISERABLE AND POOR
[1:35:59] AND BLIND AND NAKED.
[1:36:03] HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S THE CONDITION THE
[1:36:04] WORLD'S IN?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; BLIND, WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR,
[1:36:12] NAKED,
[1:36:17] spiritually
[1:36:19] naked.
[1:36:20] Another one in Revelations
[1:36:23] 17:1, he says, "And there was there came
[1:36:25] one of the seven angels which had seven
[1:36:27] miles and talked with me, saying unto
[1:36:29] me, come hither and I WILL SHOW YOU THE
[1:36:31] judgment of the great that siteth
[1:36:34] upon many waters
[1:36:36] with whom the kings of the earth have
[1:36:38] committed fornication." NOTICE A
[1:36:41] FORNICATION'S A LITTLE HEAVY FOR OUR
[1:36:43] SMALLER YOUNG ONES EARS, BUT IT'S A
[1:36:45] TRUTH. GOD SEEN THIS woman
[1:36:49] as that. Listen, the earth kings of the
[1:36:52] earth have committed fornications and
[1:36:53] the inhabitants of the earth have drunk
[1:36:55] of the wine of her fornication. When the
[1:36:57] pope has a big gathering, don't all THE
[1:36:59] WORLD LEADERS COME TO HIM?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH HIM
[1:37:03] WITHOUT KNEELING AND KISSING HIS RING,
[1:37:05] giving him worship,
[1:37:07] COMMITTING FORNICATIONS WITH HIM.
[1:37:11] AMEN.
[1:37:15] And he carried me away in the spirit in
[1:37:17] the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit
[1:37:18] upon a scarlet colored beast full of
[1:37:20] names of blasphemy, having seven heads
[1:37:22] and 10 horns. And the woman was arrayed
[1:37:25] in purple and scarlet color and decked
[1:37:27] with gold and precious stones and
[1:37:28] pearls, having a golden cup in her hand,
[1:37:30] FULL OF ABOMINATIONS AND filthiness of
[1:37:33] her fornication.
[1:37:36] AND UPON her head WAS A NAME WRITTEN,
[1:37:39] MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER of
[1:37:43] harlots.
[1:37:46] HELLO. THE MOTHER OF harlots
[1:37:49] and abominations
[1:37:51] of the earth. Notice that's the Catholic
[1:37:54] Church. She was the first organization,
[1:37:57] first denomination. They bow down and
[1:38:00] kiss the toes off of the Peter's image.
[1:38:03] Isn't that right? Pray to marry. THAT'S
[1:38:07] SPIRITUAL FORNICATION. CLAIMING TO BE
[1:38:09] MARRIED TO CHRIST, THEY'RE THE BIGGEST
[1:38:11] BUNCH OF FORNICATORS THERE EVER WAS.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; GOD CALLS HER A
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S exactly right.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; He's playing.
[1:38:19] That's right.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And he said that she's A MOTHER OF
[1:38:24] HARLOTS. ANYTHING YOU ADD TO GOD'S WORD
[1:38:28] MAKES YOU AN ADULTERESS.
[1:38:33] YOU BETTER NOT ADD TO OR TAKE AWAY.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR POWER WILL BE TAKEN OUT. GOD
[1:38:39] WANTS YOU TO BE HIS WIFE.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; How many believe we are turning a corner
[1:38:46] from just being a church to being THE
[1:38:48] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST?
[1:38:51] IT'S BRIDE TIME.
[1:38:58] Revelation 19 says, "And I heard another
[1:39:00] voice, and and I heard as it were the
[1:39:03] voice of a great multitude, and as the
[1:39:04] voice of many waters, and as THE VOICE
[1:39:07] OF MIGHTY THUNDERING, SAYING,
[1:39:08] HALLELUJAH, THE LORD OUR GOD OMNIPOTENT
[1:39:12] REIGNTH. LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE AND
[1:39:15] GIVE HONOR TO HIM, FOR THE MARRIAGE OF
[1:39:17] THE LAMB IS COME AND HIS WIFE HAS MADE
[1:39:20] HERSELF READY." HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:39:22] WHAT WE'RE DOING? AMEN. And we're
[1:39:24] saying, "God, clothe me with your
[1:39:26] righteousness."
[1:39:28] This is a group of people, amen, in the
[1:39:31] message OF THE HOUR THAT'S NOT MARRIED
[1:39:32] TO BROTHER BRANDHAM, NOT MARRIED TO SOME
[1:39:34] DENOMINATION. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED TO
[1:39:36] JESUS CHRIST. HE WAS OUR ELEASER TAKING
[1:39:39] us
[1:39:42] to Isaac.
[1:39:44] HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY IS GLAD FOR THAT?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Back here, listen.
[1:39:50] Mystery, Babylon, the mothers, and
[1:39:51] abominations of the earth. And I SAW THE
[1:39:53] WOMAN DRUNKEN WITH THE BLOOD of the
[1:39:55] saints and with blood as of martyrs of
[1:39:57] Jesus. AND WHEN I SAW HER, I WONDERED
[1:39:59] WITH GREAT ADMIRATION, HOW MANY KNOWS
[1:40:01] THAT THOSE 68 MILLION CHRISTIANS WERE
[1:40:03] KILLED BY CATHOLICISM?
[1:40:09] YEAH. You say this a little bit later in
[1:40:12] the tribulation, they'll come in here
[1:40:14] and drag your self out and shoot you.
[1:40:17] They killed 68 million. And you wait
[1:40:19] until that great that devil is kicked
[1:40:22] out of heaven. Hello. He knows he has
[1:40:24] but A SHORT TIME. WOE UNTO THE
[1:40:27] INHABITANTS of the earth. Then it says,
[1:40:29] "For the devil has God come down to you
[1:40:32] and he knows that he has but a short
[1:40:33] time." Prophet God said they'll shoot
[1:40:36] you just for praying for somebody if you
[1:40:38] don't belong to them.
[1:40:40] Hello.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:40:45] Hallelujah.
[1:40:46] But here,
[1:40:52] Revelations 10:7,
[1:40:54] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:40:56] seventh angel, when he shall begin the
[1:40:57] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:41:00] finished, as he has declared unto his
[1:41:01] servants the prophets.
[1:41:05] Revelations 1 and3, it says, "Blessed is
[1:41:08] he that readeth, and they that hear the
[1:41:10] words of this prophecy, and keep those
[1:41:12] things that are written therein, for the
[1:41:14] time is at hand." Man, how many
[1:41:15] believed? DID YOU AND I ARE BLESSED TO
[1:41:18] HEAR THE WORDS OF REVELATION?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. WE KNOW WHO THE ANTICHRIST
[1:41:24] IS. WE KNOW WHO THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS
[1:41:26] IS. WE KNOW WHO THE HARLOTS ARE.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S ANY CHURCH THAT CLAIMS TO BE
[1:41:31] MARRIED TO CHRIST AND will take their
[1:41:34] own belief over the word of God.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip around here. Maybe I
[1:41:43] can find something here.
[1:41:50] Brother Bam says, "Well, they say, well,
[1:41:52] my church, well, my church, I don't care
[1:41:55] what your church believes. If it's
[1:41:57] contrary to the word, stay away from
[1:42:00] it."
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S CONTRARY TO MY FAITH. IT'S
[1:42:05] NOT WHAT I BELIEVE. WELL, WHO YOU
[1:42:07] MARRIED TO YOURSELF?
[1:42:11] YOU'RE GOING TO BE MARRIED TO SOMEBODY.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Either God or the devil.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; WELL, MY CHURCH DON'T TEACH IT. That's
[1:42:19] right. The Bible said that Jesus is the
[1:42:21] same yesterday, today, and forever. MARK
[1:42:23] 16, THESE SHINES SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT
[1:42:26] BELIEVE. IF A CHURCH PREACHES DIFFERENT
[1:42:28] FROM THAT, DON'T YOU? YOU DIE TO THAT
[1:42:30] THING. AMEN.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:38] Praise the Lord. Do you love him?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "I'm not just speaking
[1:42:42] to this local assembly. I'm speaking all
[1:42:44] across the nation. You must be dead to
[1:42:48] your first husband."
[1:42:50] Amen. Now, we're getting into the
[1:42:51] message just a little bit. Yeah. All
[1:42:52] right. I want to read it here.
[1:42:56] Time's going slow. I must be going fast.
[1:43:03] Romans
[1:43:04] 7.
[1:43:07] Romans 7. We'll just lay our foundation
[1:43:09] now. Is that okay?
[1:43:12] Paul says, "Know ye not that, brethren,
[1:43:15] I speak to them that know the law, how
[1:43:17] that the law hath dominion over a man as
[1:43:18] long as he liveth. For the woman which
[1:43:21] hath an husband is bound by the law of
[1:43:23] her husband as long as he liveth. But if
[1:43:25] her husband be dead, she is loose from
[1:43:27] that law of her husband. So if then,
[1:43:30] while her husband liveth, she be married
[1:43:32] to another man, she shall be called an
[1:43:35] adulteress. But if her husband be dead,
[1:43:37] she is free from that last law loss, so
[1:43:39] that she's no adulteress, though she be
[1:43:41] married to another man. Amen.
[1:43:45] Praise the Lord, brethren. Wherefore, my
[1:43:47] brethren, now notice, brother Paul is
[1:43:51] saying this now. He is really going to
[1:43:54] get to where he's really what he was
[1:43:55] really meaning. Wherefore, my brethren,
[1:43:57] ye also are become dead to the law
[1:44:02] BY THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:44:05] that you should be married to another.
[1:44:08] Amen.
[1:44:10] Even to him who is raised from the dead.
[1:44:14] How many HAD TO BE MARRIED TO HIM?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; THAT WE SHOULD BRING FORTH FRUIT UNTO
[1:44:18] GOD. AMEN.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's read a few things
[1:44:23] that brother Bam said.
[1:44:28] Paul here giving illustration.
[1:44:30] He says about the scripture.
[1:44:33] He says, "This passage is seldom ever
[1:44:36] preached on because it's like marriage
[1:44:38] and divorce, but it also pertains to a
[1:44:41] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[1:44:43] of how that he's trying to set in order
[1:44:46] a church. Can nobody more be married to
[1:44:50] the world than to Christ at the same
[1:44:52] time and to be legal about it?" He says,
[1:44:57] "May I add," and he was talking about DL
[1:45:00] Moody going out in the street, "DO YOU
[1:45:01] KNOW GRACE? DO YOU KNOW GRACE? GRACE
[1:45:04] WHAT? AMAZING GRACE. HOW sweet the
[1:45:06] sound. And brother Bram says, "May I
[1:45:08] this woman grace? May I place HER IN THE
[1:45:11] BIBLE?" She's also called the ELECT
[1:45:13] LADY. THIS MISS GRACE I'M going to talk
[1:45:15] about. The Bible declares that she is
[1:45:17] the elect lady. Notice elect comes from
[1:45:19] elected lady like the virgin forth that
[1:45:22] was SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH THE BODY OF
[1:45:25] GOD ON EARTH. SHE WAS AN ELECTED WOMAN.
[1:45:29] AND ALSO GOD HAS chosen an elected lady
[1:45:31] WHICH IS HIS BRIDE. She's elected. I
[1:45:34] hope that we're members of that tonight
[1:45:35] across the world across the nation
[1:45:38] rather rather. Now Paul says here listen
[1:45:42] young girls listen to this carefully.
[1:45:45] You're going to be accountable for what
[1:45:46] you're fixing to hear because I'm here
[1:45:48] to tell you that there's a lot of
[1:45:49] message girls that have been raised.
[1:45:52] They've heard this and they have broken
[1:45:54] this.
[1:45:56] All right? So be very careful. Make sure
[1:45:58] that the man that you choose is the man
[1:45:59] you want to live with.
[1:46:02] And if you marry him,
[1:46:04] if it's bad or good, you better make the
[1:46:06] best of it.
[1:46:08] Hello.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; But Paul says here saying that a woman
[1:46:14] cannot remarry until her host first
[1:46:16] husband is dead. She cannot remarry as
[1:46:18] long as her h first husband is living.
[1:46:20] And she by no circumstances at all she
[1:46:23] must remain single as long as her
[1:46:24] husband is living. If she should do such
[1:46:27] a sin, she shall be called an
[1:46:29] adulteress. He says, "And I'm speaking
[1:46:31] of the natural nile." Now, to type it
[1:46:33] with the spiritual, we'll get into that
[1:46:35] in a minute. If this woman would commit
[1:46:37] such a thing that she is marked an
[1:46:38] adulteress, if she has two living
[1:46:41] husbands at the same time, therefore she
[1:46:43] has forfeit it. And by DOING THIS, HER
[1:46:47] RIGHTS to God in heaven.
[1:46:50] By doing so, she has she IS AN OUTCAST
[1:46:53] FROM THE ECONOMY OF GOD ACCORDING TO
[1:46:55] SCRIPTURES THAT I'VE JUST READ.
[1:46:58] HELLO. How in the world are you ever
[1:47:00] going to straighten something like that
[1:47:02] out? Let me tell you something. I don't
[1:47:03] say that God can't save you. I don't
[1:47:04] know. Now, according to this, you're
[1:47:08] done. Hello.
[1:47:12] It's pretty strong, isn't it?
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; It's what Paul said. So is this church.
[1:47:18] Listen, when she tries to mix creeds and
[1:47:21] denominations with the word of God, she
[1:47:24] can't be married to a denomination and
[1:47:27] be the bride of Christ at the SAME TIME.
[1:47:30] SHE'S GOT TO BE DEAD TO ONE OR THE
[1:47:32] OTHER.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Y'all are getting quiet on me now.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; It's right there. It's not my word.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; It's what he said.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:50] I may not like it. You might not like
[1:47:52] it, but it's still the truth.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Listen, ANOTHER QUOTE NOW. YOU CANNOT
[1:47:55] MIX DENOMINATIONAL CREED WITH THE WORD
[1:47:57] BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTRARY one to another.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SATAN TRIED TO DO IN
[1:48:04] THE INTELLECTUAL conception of Eden,
[1:48:06] EVE. ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT HE DID to
[1:48:08] Eve?
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:12] He mixed it. Just put a little bit of
[1:48:14] his own in there. Yeah.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone. Jesus
[1:48:18] said, "But by every word that proceedth
[1:48:20] out of the mouth of God shall man live
[1:48:21] by."
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; In the end of the Bible, he says, "If
[1:48:24] any man adds to this word or takes away,
[1:48:27] HIS PART WILL BE TAKEN out of the book
[1:48:29] of life."
[1:48:33] Amen.
[1:48:34] All right.
[1:48:36] So now notice and that's what creed has
[1:48:38] done tonight. Denomination has separated
[1:48:40] the people from the word of God. Even
[1:48:42] Jesus says through haven't you through
[1:48:45] your traditions made the commandments of
[1:48:47] God of none effect to the people.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE TELL YOU OH WELL WE DON'T
[1:48:53] BELIEVE IN PROPHETS.
[1:48:55] WE TEACH OUR PEOPLE THAT JESUS WAS THE
[1:48:57] you just
[1:48:59] made the word of God of none effect to
[1:49:01] them people.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Now they won't believe in it. They'll
[1:49:04] never receive the benefit of it, the
[1:49:05] blessing of it. Amen.
[1:49:10] Oh my. Now notice
[1:49:14] he says now she as a woman if she is
[1:49:16] married to Christ the word she cannot be
[1:49:19] married to a church denomination at the
[1:49:20] same time for she's bound by it. SHE
[1:49:23] CANNOT LIVE WITH both husbands at the
[1:49:25] same time. They're contrary one to the
[1:49:27] other. ONE IS GOD sent and the other one
[1:49:30] is man-made. So they're contrary. See
[1:49:32] let every word's man's man's word be a
[1:49:34] lie and mind the truth.
[1:49:37] They're just as contrary one to another
[1:49:39] as law is from grace. Paul's speaking
[1:49:40] here. One must be dead to have the
[1:49:44] other. If she tries to mix them, she
[1:49:47] shall be called an adulteress. Oh, think
[1:49:49] of it, New York, Arizona, across the
[1:49:52] nation. Think of it. GOD SAID IF SHE'S
[1:49:54] MARRIED TO TO TWO AT THE SAME TIME, SHE
[1:49:57] SHALL BE CALLED AN ADULTERESS.
[1:50:00] WHAT ADULTERESS CAN ENTER HEAVEN? GOD IS
[1:50:02] NOT GOING TO MARRY AN ADULTERESS. YEAH.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Now some of these MESSAGE YOU DIDN'T
[1:50:10] HEAR THIS BEFORE 63 AND BEFORE AMEN.
[1:50:14] CHRIST WAS PUT OUT.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; HE SAID FIND YOU A GOOD CHURCH. THERE'S
[1:50:17] PLENTY OF GOOD CHURCHES TO GO TO. BUT
[1:50:19] THE AFTER THAT AFTER THAT THEY TURNED
[1:50:21] CHRIST OUT. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? THEN GOD
[1:50:24] SPEWED THEM OUT.
[1:50:27] Oh
[1:50:30] that's right. And then it was time to
[1:50:32] come out.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; How many believe? then it was time to
[1:50:35] come out.
[1:50:37] Don't think that you're going to be in a
[1:50:38] denominational system and be the bride
[1:50:40] of Christ at the same time. It's
[1:50:41] contrary to prophet of God, contrary to
[1:50:44] the scriptures.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; No, you're going to go into tribulation
[1:50:48] period.
[1:50:50] Amen.
[1:50:54] All right.
[1:50:58] Arizona nations, she can't be married to
[1:51:00] both at the same time. He won't marry an
[1:51:03] adulteress. And then he said, "Well, you
[1:51:04] say my church says, I don't care what
[1:51:06] your church teaches. What does the word
[1:51:08] teach?" Amen. Listen, I'm sitting here
[1:51:11] looking at a dear old woman, Sister
[1:51:13] Shreder. Many of you women back there
[1:51:16] and Sister Moore over here, older sister
[1:51:18] remembers a few years ago. If their
[1:51:20] mother even if their Hold on. If their
[1:51:25] MOTHER OR EVEN THEM WOULD HAVE WALKED
[1:51:27] OUT IN THE STREETS THE WAY THAT THESE
[1:51:29] WOMEN do today, church members, they'd
[1:51:32] have them locked up them women for being
[1:51:34] insane.
[1:51:37] She forgot to put on her skirt.
[1:51:40] Well, better was saying, "Look at the
[1:51:42] conditions of the women and you'll see
[1:51:45] THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH."
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:52] She put forgot to put on her skirt.
[1:51:54] Well, if it was insane then, it's insane
[1:51:57] now. This is where he SAYS THAT WE WELL,
[1:51:59] LOOK, THE WHOLE world proves it's
[1:52:02] insane.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; How many believes he believes that the
[1:52:06] world has gone insane?
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Complete insanity.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder something. I wonder
[1:52:16] if God would have never said uh that he
[1:52:18] created male and female, man, and woman
[1:52:21] created he them. If he'd have never said
[1:52:23] that, they'd have probably not never
[1:52:25] tried this transgender stuff.
[1:52:28] Why? Because all these transgenders just
[1:52:31] again, brother Bam says the devil hates
[1:52:33] Genesis and Revelations more than any
[1:52:35] two books in the Bible. Because Genesis
[1:52:37] proves, you know, the beginning and how
[1:52:39] things were made. And what does he do?
[1:52:41] There is no certain gender. Yes, there
[1:52:43] is.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Why? All they're trying to do is this.
[1:52:46] It's the devil is what it is.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing but the devil. Why do
[1:52:51] you think the leftist people, AMEN,
[1:52:53] WOULD LIKE TO SHOOT YOU? THEY WILL shoot
[1:52:55] you. They did. Kirk tried to Trump.
[1:52:58] Hello. HOW MANY KNOWS THIS SPIRIT THAT'S
[1:53:00] ON THEM, IT'S an evil, wicked spirit.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; YOU LET A YOU LET SOMEBODY DOING A
[1:53:05] DOCUMENTARY or just SEEING HOW BOTH
[1:53:07] SIDES ARE AND THEY'LL GO OVER TO THE
[1:53:08] left side in this in a certain street
[1:53:10] and see how they are and maybe disagree
[1:53:12] with them A LITTLE. GET OUT OF HERE. YOU
[1:53:14] YOU GO GO SOMEWHERE AND DIE OR WHATEVER
[1:53:16] IT IS, RIGHT? THERE'S LIKE this and go
[1:53:17] over to Trump's side or the other SIDE
[1:53:19] AND THEY'RE LIKE, "COME ON IN. SOMEBODY
[1:53:21] WE I KNOW YOU MIGHT SEE IT A little bit.
[1:53:22] Come on in here. You know, just be, you
[1:53:24] know, they're nice and friendly folks.
[1:53:26] That tells the spirit behind it. Ain't
[1:53:28] that right? See what kind of spirit it
[1:53:30] is. But I'm here to tell you, THE WHOLE
[1:53:33] WORLD IS GOING IN. LOOK AT THE murders
[1:53:34] and things that's going on now in the
[1:53:36] world. We've had one not so long ago.
[1:53:38] Ain't that right? He see it's insanity.
[1:53:41] He says, and then he MAKES A STATEMENT,
[1:53:43] THE COMPLETE TOTAL INSANITY OF this
[1:53:45] world that we're going into RIGHT AWAY.
[1:53:47] IT'S ALMOST THERE NOW. And it's marching
[1:53:50] right out in the street and it's coming
[1:53:52] right into the church pew. Total
[1:53:55] insanity.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I don't want
[1:54:00] no woman coming in here in her spandex
[1:54:02] or her tights and stuff without the
[1:54:04] skirt.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. You sisters don't make me
[1:54:08] do it. You go take her in the back room
[1:54:09] and says, "Let me give you a skirt."
[1:54:13] Why? Because it's insanity coming right
[1:54:15] into the pews.
[1:54:17] Did you forget to put your skirt on? How
[1:54:20] many knows you go anywhere almost out
[1:54:21] there anymore?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Insanity. And where is it? Did preachers
[1:54:27] come up here and they don't preach
[1:54:28] against it?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Do they come up here and say, "We don't
[1:54:33] want that kind of stuff in here. We want
[1:54:35] you in here, but dress right? Dress like
[1:54:38] you're going to meet God." That's right.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Because you're not going to a
[1:54:42] prostitute's house.
[1:54:48] You love the Lord this morning.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; I know you do.
[1:54:52] All right. Complete insanity this world
[1:54:54] is going into right almost there right
[1:54:56] now. Amen. Doing things that human
[1:55:00] people wouldn't think of doing. Ain't
[1:55:02] that right?
[1:55:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:08] Brother Bam says, you know that he goes
[1:55:10] to talking about a woman, how to if she
[1:55:13] won't have a baby for her husband,
[1:55:14] she'll take a dog or a cat or something.
[1:55:17] Amen.
[1:55:20] That's if she won't ain't there ain't no
[1:55:22] sister that ought not to have a baby for
[1:55:24] her husband.
[1:55:26] Ain't that right?
[1:55:29] Nothing wrong with have a dog or cat,
[1:55:30] but don't refuse to have babies by your
[1:55:33] children. I could talk to you later
[1:55:35] about that. You could be in a whole lot
[1:55:36] of trouble for it.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; A whole lot of trouble for it. Amen. But
[1:55:41] anyway, and so he says, "Look,
[1:55:44] Hollywood teaches that you don't want to
[1:55:46] be a mother. Why? Because it'll
[1:55:48] disfigure you. You won't look as good as
[1:55:50] maybe what you did before and all this,
[1:55:52] that, or the other."
[1:55:55] And he says that's a true picture of the
[1:55:57] modern church. You know, neither does
[1:55:59] this modern church want any of these
[1:56:01] screaming and shouting and tongue
[1:56:03] speaking. Acts 238 youngman's around
[1:56:06] her.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? WE
[1:56:11] DON'T MIND A LITTLE SCREAMING. We don't
[1:56:14] mind A LITTLE SHOUTING. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:56:16] IT'S GOING TO GET NOISY AT THE HOUSE
[1:56:18] AFTER A WHILE, Brother Gersham.
[1:56:22] AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:56:24] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN AND MAN,
[1:56:26] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY GET NOISY.
[1:56:29] WOO! I don't mind IT WHEN THEM KIDS GO
[1:56:31] OUT HERE AND THEY SCREAM A LITTLE, HAVE
[1:56:33] A LITTLE FUN. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
[1:56:34] SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT'S THE WAY YOU AND I
[1:56:36] DO WHEN WE COME INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:56:38] WE ENJOY THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE ENJOY
[1:56:41] THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:56:49] And I ain't got to worry about preaching
[1:56:51] it too hard for you.
[1:56:56] You think I preach it hard? LET ME PLAY
[1:56:57] YOU A tape
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; cuz that's where I read it out of.
[1:57:00] Brother Brandham was hard. Now
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; folks, I ain't never taken a bar of
[1:57:06] barrel slat and beat my son so that he
[1:57:08] couldn't get up off the bed for two
[1:57:10] weeks.
[1:57:12] And that some of the things better said.
[1:57:14] Mama would to get a hold of her daughter
[1:57:16] if she got out there and come home all
[1:57:18] twisted up and everything else. She
[1:57:21] wouldn't get up out of bed for a while.
[1:57:23] He preached it hard.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Can I preach? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:57:29] GOD SAID IN THE LEODYSIA CHURCH, HE
[1:57:31] SAYS, "AS MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE AND I
[1:57:35] CHASEN." SO WE DON'T MIND CORRECTION IN
[1:57:37] THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE DON'T MIND THE SAME
[1:57:39] PREACHER STEPPING ON OUR FEET A LITTLE
[1:57:42] BIT.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. I DON'T MAKE YOU MAD AND
[1:57:51] CAUSE YOU TO WALK OUT. YOU CLAP TO THE
[1:57:53] TRUTH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ELECT.
[1:57:56] YOU'RE THE BRIDE.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE BRIDE CAN TAKE THIS KIND OF
[1:58:00] DOSE. WOO! GIDEON, THIS MEDICINE IS
[1:58:04] POWERFUL.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOOD. IT'S PURE. I WANT THE good
[1:58:09] stuff. DON'T GIVE ME NO WATERED DOWN
[1:58:11] VERSION. DON'T GIVE ME A SYNTHETIC
[1:58:13] BRAND. GIVE ME THE GOOD STUFF.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE PURE STUFF.
[1:58:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:26] It'll make you jump up and click your
[1:58:28] heels together.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:40] We don't mind it. She may not want it.
[1:58:43] And it is hooping and crying and
[1:58:44] screaming and amen and hallelujah. That
[1:58:48] around says amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; MAN, I AM SO THANKFUL, BROTHER GERSHAM,
[1:59:06] to have a church that's alive.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; A CHURCH THAT'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST. I'M
[1:59:11] THANKFUL FOR EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE.
[1:59:13] I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT GOD IS DOING IN
[1:59:15] YOUR LIFE AND IN MY LIFE. GOD IS REAL.
[1:59:22] BROTHER BRAD MENTIONED, "YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:59:24] TO WORRY. JUST TRUST THE LORD. COMMIT
[1:59:27] YOURSELF TO GOD." HOW MANY DAYS GOT DONE
[1:59:29] THAT WAY? AMEN. COME ON. JUST PUT IT ON
[1:59:32] uh not cruise control.
[1:59:36] What's
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; autopilot?
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRAD ON AUTOPILOT. WE BROTHER
[1:59:44] SAYS, YOU KNOW, BUT WE GO CHRISTIANS
[1:59:46] JUST DO THINGS AUTOMATICALLY.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; NOT MANUALLY, BUT AUTOMATICALLY. AND I
[1:59:50] SAYS, MAN, WE WENT BEYOND AUTOMATIC. WE
[1:59:53] WENT AMEN TO AUTOMATIC CONTROL.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Just put it on autopilot.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; People scared of autopilot.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Scared of all of I probably would be.
[2:00:07] I'll probably be one that says, "Hey,
[2:00:09] you get that off of there.
[2:00:13] You know, I'll be honest with you. They
[2:00:16] have these brake systems that are that
[2:00:19] won't let you stop real quick, right?
[2:00:22] Anti-skid. AND GUESS I I NEEDED TO STOP
[2:00:25] QUICK, FOLKS.
[2:00:28] And I CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND
[2:00:30] THEM BOUNCY THINGS HIT IT AND I WAS I I
[2:00:32] hit that BRAKES AND THAT'S WHAT I'M
[2:00:34] GOING TO HIT. WHAT I WAS GOING TO HIT
[2:00:35] CUZ IT WOULDN'T LET ME STOP. I said I
[2:00:37] was JUST LET ME SQUEAL MY TIRES. JUST
[2:00:41] LET ME SLIDE, BUT I WANT TO GET STOPPED.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's one time I HATED THAT AUTOMATIC
[2:00:48] ANTI-SKID STUFF. COME ON, PEOPLE. I can
[2:00:52] understand it, I guess. Trying to be a
[2:00:54] little bit smart here. If it was wet,
[2:00:56] right? If it was wet, you might want
[2:00:58] that to where you don't just hydroplane,
[2:01:01] you know? But if it's dry, I don't mind
[2:01:04] sliding. I guarantee you it's going to
[2:01:06] stop faster than the anti-skid stuff
[2:01:08] will let me do.
[2:01:10] Amen.
[2:01:14] That was totally free.
[2:01:20] But I like that. I thought, Lord, help
[2:01:22] us. When we come up the Red Seas, put it
[2:01:25] on autopilot. When you don't know how to
[2:01:27] get over it, get under it. You can't do
[2:01:29] no more. Get your hands off of it
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; AND LET GOD DO IT. BROTHER SAYS, "JUST
[2:01:34] SIT BACK AND WATCH GOD TAKE YOU
[2:01:36] THROUGH."
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A CONGREGATION LIKE
[2:01:41] THAT, BROTHER BRAD. AMEN. AND WHEN YOU
[2:01:43] COME UP TO GREAT TRIALS, AMEN. THINGS
[2:01:45] YOU CAN'T GET OVER, YOU CAN'T GET UNDER,
[2:01:47] THEN JUST TRUST GOD.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; JUST COMMIT IT TO GOD. DON'T GO ON A
[2:01:53] RAMPAGE.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go there. That's a
[2:02:00] little personal.
[2:02:03] But people when you don't do like what
[2:02:05] they want to do, they're come at you
[2:02:06] almost. Hello.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Don't go at them. Just commit it to God.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; If you want something, trust God in it.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I give you a little p taste of it
[2:02:15] anyway. All right. You love the Lord.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go on.
[2:02:21] We're not supposed to go as long since
[2:02:22] we don't have Sunday school, but that's
[2:02:25] okay, isn't it?
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Get you more food.
[2:02:30] NOTICE
[2:02:33] WHO SHE LOVES. WATCH her lover. You want
[2:02:36] to see who she's in love with?
[2:02:39] The word says this, BUT SHE SAYS, "MY
[2:02:41] CHURCH TEACHES THIS."
[2:02:44] HELLO. I MEAN, ANYTIME A PERSON THAT
[2:02:46] SAYS, "I KNOW THE WORD SAYS THAT, but I
[2:02:48] no." Who are you IN LOVE WITH?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE IN LOVE WITH THIS MORNING?
[2:02:54] WE'RE IN LOVE with the word. WE DON'T
[2:02:56] CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS. I DON'T
[2:02:58] CARE WHAT COMES THROUGH MY MIND. JUST
[2:02:59] GET IT ON OUT. LET EVERY THOUGHT IN MY
[2:03:02] MIND BE A LIE IN GOD'S WORD. THE TRUTH.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We can tell who she loves. My church
[2:03:10] says this. Then who is she in love with?
[2:03:13] Who is her husband? Her fruits proves
[2:03:15] who she is. Exactly right. Shows who she
[2:03:18] is. And another thing, notice what kind
[2:03:21] of children she's bearing. That tells
[2:03:24] her who her papy is. LIKE THE FIRST ADAM
[2:03:27] OR THE SECOND ADAM. AMEN. LISTEN, her
[2:03:31] daughters, THEIR PAINTED FACE, BOBBED
[2:03:34] HAIR, WOMEN CLOTHES, TROUSERS, CUTS her
[2:03:36] hair, AND IT'S A SHAME FOR HER TO DO SO.
[2:03:38] BROTHER RANDOM goes on, LOOK AT WHAT
[2:03:41] THEY LOOK LIKE. LOOK AT WHAT THEY ACT
[2:03:43] LIKE.
[2:03:53] SH.
[2:03:57] She says sh.
[2:03:59] She don't like none of this screaming.
[2:04:01] The preacher, you ain't got to scream at
[2:04:03] me. I got perfectly 2020 hearing.
[2:04:10] 2020 hearing.
[2:04:13] You know what I mean, right?
[2:04:17] Yeah. It's supposed to be vision, but in
[2:04:18] other words, I can hear perfectly good.
[2:04:22] Some old lady comes and visits a Baptist
[2:04:24] church or something on the back,
[2:04:26] remember? And the daughter married some
[2:04:28] boy from the city and there they went to
[2:04:30] a city church and and she they didn't
[2:04:32] want to take her, but they, you know,
[2:04:34] just let's go over to their church. And
[2:04:35] they went to their church and preacher
[2:04:37] says, "Now Jesus Christ came to save
[2:04:39] sinners." Amen, preacher. That's right.
[2:04:47] wants them to be quiet.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; They like quietness.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Did that BOTHER ANYBODY?
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; OH, I'll tell you what. When that woman
[2:05:06] screamed in the back of the church, the
[2:05:08] man said, "It sends shivers up my back."
[2:05:10] But when he goes to the ballpark, he'll
[2:05:12] pull hats DOWN OVER HIS HAT.
[2:05:17] SENDS SHIVERS. IT MAKES ME FREEZE when
[2:05:19] somebody screams or holler or some woman
[2:05:21] goes.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Sorry, it's not quite sharp enough, but
[2:05:26] anyway.
[2:05:29] ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BROTHER? SAID, "MAN,
[2:05:31] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ONE THING. IF YOU
[2:05:33] GET TO HEAVEN, YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE TO
[2:05:35] DEATH. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE CHILLS
[2:05:36] COMING UP YOUR SPINE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO
[2:05:38] WITH.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; But don't you worry about being there."
[2:05:42] Hello. We ain't going to have no
[2:05:44] chillers in heaven.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't nobody going to be
[2:05:49] THERE WITH CHILLS RUNNING UP THEIR
[2:05:50] SPINE. WHY? CUZ THEY AIN'T GOING TO BE
[2:05:52] THERE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO BE
[2:05:54] DOING. THERE'S GOING TO BE SCREAMING.
[2:05:56] THERE'S GOING TO BE SHOUTING. THERE'S
[2:05:57] GOING TO BE REJOICING.
[2:06:00] THERE'S going to be dancing. THERE'S
[2:06:01] GOING TO BE SHOUTING. WOO!
[2:06:04] THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN HEAVEN.
[2:06:06] THERE'S GOING TO BE JUMPING. WOO! YEAH.
[2:06:09] YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO
[2:06:11] BE IN HEAVEN. BROTHER, DADDY,
[2:06:14] WE'RE GOING TO BE OURSELVES. BROTHER
[2:06:16] SEAN, WE'RE GOING TO JUST BE OURSELVES.
[2:06:19] BE OURSELVES.
[2:06:21] My mama, I got to quit.
[2:06:25] I'm going to get carried away before I
[2:06:27] get carried away.
[2:06:31] Oh my. Don't you believe that though?
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; But they want it stagnant. They love
[2:06:36] stagnation. Brother Ram says
[2:06:40] they love sistns that's got wiggle tails
[2:06:43] in it. When they go to church,
[2:06:47] here's a new one fresh. When they go to
[2:06:50] church and the preacher pours out a
[2:06:51] glass of water for you, brother Sean.
[2:06:55] Here's a cup of water. And there's a
[2:06:58] bunch of little wiggle tails. Boom.
[2:07:01] Bunch of them things in there. Few of
[2:07:04] them little water spiders.
[2:07:10] Let me explain what that water wiggle
[2:07:12] tail is. That wiggle tail is now God
[2:07:16] don't care how you dress.
[2:07:19] God looks at the inside.
[2:07:21] He looks at the heart. Now it doesn't
[2:07:24] really matter if you trim your hair.
[2:07:27] There's a real wiggler right there.
[2:07:30] Now it's okay for you to wear some
[2:07:32] makeup. Another wiggler.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I LIKE THAT PREACHER IS WHAT a lot
[2:07:39] of THEM SISTERS BACK THERE. I LIKE THAT
[2:07:41] GUY. LET'S VOTE HIM IN.
[2:07:44] Let's keep that preacher. I like him.
[2:07:47] Bible never did say that, you know,
[2:07:49] women couldn't wear trousers.
[2:07:53] Liar. Right.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Woman that woman that wears a garment
[2:07:58] pertains to man's an abomination in the
[2:08:00] sight of God.
[2:08:02] What did brother Bram said? It was an
[2:08:03] abomination. I believe he described it
[2:08:04] as one of them filthy bathrooms you go
[2:08:07] into that you just you really got to use
[2:08:10] the bathroom. But man, let's go down
[2:08:12] another exit.
[2:08:16] Let's find a good truck stop where maybe
[2:08:17] they'll keep it a little cleaner
[2:08:20] cuz this place right here, they don't
[2:08:21] care nothing about their bathrooms.
[2:08:25] An abomination.
[2:08:29] That's what it smells like to God. It's
[2:08:31] an abomination in the sight of God. Let
[2:08:33] me tell you something. How many believes
[2:08:35] that these churches that don't have any
[2:08:37] enthusiasm, they don't have any zeal
[2:08:39] anymore.
[2:08:41] Amen. It's just become A TRADITION. WHAT
[2:08:44] DID GOD SAY?
[2:08:46] You come to church. Well, I guess it's
[2:08:49] Wednesday. I guess it's Sunday. We
[2:08:51] better go down to church.
[2:08:55] God says, "That stinks to me."
[2:08:59] When you just do it out of a tradition,
[2:09:02] it come a stench in my nostril. Sure,
[2:09:04] it's the right thing to do. Sure. BUT
[2:09:06] YOU AIN'T GOT IT. YOU GOT A STINKING
[2:09:08] ATTITUDE.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; AN ATTITUDE THAT IT'S JUST, WELL, WE'RE
[2:09:12] JUST GOING TO HEAR BROTHER BER AGAIN.
[2:09:13] WE'RE GOING TO HEAR BROTHER BRAD. NO,
[2:09:15] COME ON.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU REALLY PULL
[2:09:18] FROM GOD, HE'LL HE'LL CHANNEL THIS.
[2:09:21] HE'LL CAUSE ME TO SAY SOMETHING YOU
[2:09:23] NEED.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW
[2:09:32] WHAT, BOYS? The Lord spoke to me back
[2:09:35] there. I feel like he did. Impressed
[2:09:38] upon my heart. Wayne kids, all of our
[2:09:41] young people, I've got something for
[2:09:43] you.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? You need to learn
[2:09:47] to snuggle with Jesus. Yeah.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; You remember John the Revelator, how
[2:09:54] that he got leaned on the bosom of
[2:09:55] Christ.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; What is that on his chest?
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Would that be his chest?
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; We scoot over a little bit. So he loved
[2:10:04] Jesus so much he just
[2:10:09] Oh man, I love you, Michael. I just love
[2:10:12] you.
[2:10:17] You forgive me. Correct me after church
[2:10:18] if I'm wrong. I'll repent next service.
[2:10:21] But he said he went to the lady on the
[2:10:22] bosom of Christ. He was laid on his
[2:10:24] bosom. He loved Jesus. He was a person
[2:10:26] of love. He didn't mind expressing. You
[2:10:29] didn't see Peter doing it. But why? And
[2:10:31] you know what what I'm meaning by that
[2:10:34] is your parents probably pray with you.
[2:10:36] Mom and dad pray with you. But I'm here
[2:10:38] to tell you as soon as possible, you
[2:10:41] want to have your own little quiet
[2:10:44] secret prayer place. that little place
[2:10:47] that you go by yourself somewhere and
[2:10:49] say, "Jesus, I just want you to know I
[2:10:51] love you, Lord. I got to go through
[2:10:54] school. I got to do this. I got to do
[2:10:55] that. And I want you to just be with
[2:10:56] me." Man, I'm telling you, some of them
[2:10:59] kids are mean, and I I got to I got to
[2:11:01] keep my Holy Ghost. So, Lord, help me.
[2:11:03] Hello. I'm being cuddled by having your
[2:11:05] own prayer life. How many will do that?
[2:11:07] Say, have your own little experience,
[2:11:09] your own prayer life.
[2:11:14] Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:18] cuz that's where your strength lays.
[2:11:21] Can't just go off mom and dad's
[2:11:22] experience. You got to have your own
[2:11:24] experience. The sooner you do that, the
[2:11:26] better off you'll be.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll make you stronger in the
[2:11:30] Lord.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Y'all about ready for the good stuff?
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; All right. All right.
[2:11:43] So there the towards the end is when he
[2:11:45] was speaking make the statement I'm not
[2:11:47] just talking to my local assembly here
[2:11:49] but across the nation you've got to be
[2:11:52] dead to your first husband if you're
[2:11:54] united to Christ and married to a
[2:11:56] denomination you're an adulteress you
[2:11:59] are leadya
[2:12:02] amen in other words you're still in them
[2:12:04] churches
[2:12:06] you still held to their traditions and
[2:12:07] you're leadyan wretched poor miserable
[2:12:10] blind and naked it and don't know it.
[2:12:13] Amen.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; A church across the nation, we're
[2:12:16] following Jesus Christ, the word.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; How many believe that that's what
[2:12:20] brother Brandon came for is to bring us
[2:12:21] back to the word.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be the bride, you have to be
[2:12:27] remarried to the word of God, which is
[2:12:29] Christ. In the beginning was the word.
[2:12:31] The word was with God, and the word was
[2:12:32] God. And the word was made flesh and
[2:12:34] dwelt among us.
[2:12:36] Amen. I read this to our brothers up in
[2:12:39] Ohio. It's the old I dress Amish and
[2:12:41] everything. I said, "As long as you hold
[2:12:44] to man's tradition of denominations, you
[2:12:47] are called in God's word an adulteress."
[2:12:52] How many believes this? You got to get
[2:12:53] away from traditions of man.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; You are God's bride now. You'll dress
[2:12:59] the way God wants you to dress. You'll
[2:13:00] think the way God wants you to do, not
[2:13:02] the way you want to do. Amen. And as
[2:13:05] long as you're a denomination seeker
[2:13:07] belonging to denominational church that
[2:13:09] denies the word, you are an adulteress.
[2:13:12] You see why brother Benam IS SAYING ALL
[2:13:14] YOU I'M GREETING YOU ALL THE WAY ACROSS
[2:13:16] EVERYWHERE. I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. AS
[2:13:18] LONG NOW AS LONG AS YOU'RE A PART OF
[2:13:20] THAT, YOU'RE AN ADULTERESS. THAT WAS A
[2:13:22] WHOLE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. How many
[2:13:23] believes he was a stronger language?
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; And yet it was his thanksgiving message.
[2:13:29] His thanksgiving message.
[2:13:32] Amen.
[2:13:34] Jesus says you can't serve God and
[2:13:36] mammon at the same time. You can't be
[2:13:40] virtuous to Christ, the word of God, and
[2:13:43] serve a man-made denomination at the
[2:13:45] same time. Those were strong words for
[2:13:48] that day. How many believes that
[2:13:50] Pentecost and all them still in full
[2:13:52] swing? And then he comes and makes these
[2:13:55] statements in the midst of it all. They
[2:13:57] put him out and I and I I'll I'll read
[2:13:59] you a quote and this quote almost
[2:14:02] matches perfectly in uh not thinking
[2:14:06] man's filter or lean not to your own
[2:14:08] understanding when he spoke about how
[2:14:10] that they had put him out in in uh
[2:14:13] Tucson wouldn't have him back but he or
[2:14:17] this brother did over here in Louisiana.
[2:14:19] Okay. You can't be to Christ the word
[2:14:22] and serve a man-made denomination at the
[2:14:24] same time. It's contrary to the word.
[2:14:26] Paul sit there. Now notice
[2:14:32] then
[2:14:36] he says
[2:14:38] take a good look for a moment. Here he
[2:14:40] is brother Brandham trying to get them
[2:14:41] to have a conscience and think a little.
[2:14:46] He says look for a moment with your own
[2:14:48] spiritual EYESIGHT AT YOUR SOUL. JUST
[2:14:50] look around. I'm speaking across the
[2:14:53] nation now. Just look a few minutes. You
[2:14:56] out at Brandom Tabernacle. You out at
[2:14:57] the Tabernacles West Coast, Arizona,
[2:15:00] wherever you're at, look at yourself for
[2:15:01] a few minutes.
[2:15:04] I'm going to stop right there and say,
[2:15:06] how many believes that I want to God
[2:15:08] does it to me. I thank God that that
[2:15:11] Holy Spirit in my life, I hear his voice
[2:15:14] much plainer than I used to.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that God will allow you to look
[2:15:20] at yourself. How many believe every one
[2:15:23] of us need the Holy Spirit to get you to
[2:15:25] look at yourself
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; to see where you are? Now, I'm not
[2:15:28] saying that you look at your faults and
[2:15:30] get all down. No. Look, the Holy Spirit
[2:15:32] will show you the condition that you're
[2:15:34] in.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; The preacher can't do it. You have to
[2:15:39] search that out yourself. The Holy
[2:15:41] Spirit, that still small voice, will
[2:15:43] tell you where you're at. Amen.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; How many knows that it is of absolute
[2:15:49] utmost importance that you listen to
[2:15:52] that voice?
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Young people get used to that voice.
[2:15:57] That little voice that tells you what's
[2:15:58] right and what's wrong.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. What you should or shouldn't do,
[2:16:03] should or shouldn't think. He was
[2:16:05] telling them, "Look at yourself for a
[2:16:07] few minutes." You say, "The message
[2:16:08] you're preaching, Brother Brandham, IS
[2:16:10] WRONG." LOOK at yourself a little bit.
[2:16:12] Let the Holy Spirit search your minds
[2:16:14] with the word. You'll agree with the
[2:16:16] message that let Christ, the anointed
[2:16:19] word, search out your own conscience.
[2:16:21] Let him get into you. See if that's
[2:16:23] right or not. That's just one thing of
[2:16:25] many that I've mentioned with hundreds
[2:16:27] of them, mentioning women bobbing their
[2:16:30] hair, wearing pants, and all these other
[2:16:32] things that they were. Look at yourself.
[2:16:34] Does the Bible agree with woman bobbing
[2:16:36] her hair?
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; No. The congregation says, "Does the
[2:16:40] Bible believe in three baptisms of
[2:16:42] Father, Son, the Holy Ghost?"
[2:16:43] Congregation says, "No. No such a thing.
[2:16:45] The Bible agree with women wearing
[2:16:47] clemen's clothes?" NO. WELL, JUST TAKE
[2:16:50] THEM THREE. There's hundreds. Just
[2:16:51] search it out with God's word.
[2:16:55] Next, he says, "Now you say, well,
[2:16:56] what's this all got to do with
[2:16:58] thanksgiving? What are you talking
[2:16:59] about, Brother Benham? Here it is.
[2:17:01] Quarter in the nine. You didn't say
[2:17:03] nothing about Thanksgiving. What a
[2:17:04] message. What a message for the occasion
[2:17:07] to me. Yes indeed. The pilgrims fathers
[2:17:11] were very thankful for their newfound
[2:17:13] way of life.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; How many glad we are like pilgrims
[2:17:18] coming out of a Amen. a bunch of England
[2:17:21] tradition traditions of churches and
[2:17:23] everything else. Now we found the new
[2:17:26] way.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. The right way.
[2:17:30] being separated from the old English
[2:17:31] denominations decreed they would marry
[2:17:33] to the new anointed word for their age.
[2:17:35] That's right. He says the new new
[2:17:38] anointed word of the age. So can we be
[2:17:40] thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[2:17:43] separated ourselves from the things of
[2:17:44] the world all of our associates. Abraham
[2:17:47] was a pilgrim. God has separated us from
[2:17:49] all the dead religions. Amen. I'm
[2:17:52] speaking across the nations now. All the
[2:17:55] dead creeds. AND TO WHAT? TO SEPARATE US
[2:17:58] AND OPEN US TO GO INTO A NEW LAND, A NEW
[2:18:02] MESSAGE FOR a new day.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; How many believe, man, I'll tell you
[2:18:07] what, I've got another whole page on on
[2:18:09] what he's brought us into. How many are
[2:18:11] so thankful what God has taken us out of
[2:18:13] and what he's taken us into.
[2:18:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:18:20] Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] you
[2:18:24] separated from your first union by
[2:18:26] spiritual death. Now you are born again
[2:18:29] or be uh or remarried again to the new
[2:18:32] spiritual union. NOT THAT OLD NATURAL
[2:18:34] life of the things of the world, but the
[2:18:36] eternal, the gene that was in you from
[2:18:38] the beginning. And he goes to talking
[2:18:39] about the old book is gone. Amen. And
[2:18:41] the old life is gone. It's in the sea of
[2:18:43] God's forgetfulness. How many believes
[2:18:46] that? He says, "And then now he says,
[2:18:49] Amen. Now the word justified is that you
[2:18:52] never done it in the first place.
[2:18:55] Here's a little heavier part even. IT'S
[2:18:57] NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; How is it done in God's book of sea of
[2:19:03] forgetfulness? Your old book of marriage
[2:19:05] of is divorced and dead. It's not even
[2:19:07] in memories of God. You're justified.
[2:19:10] Amen. You was accused. YOU WAS ACCUSED.
[2:19:12] BUT YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST
[2:19:14] PLACE.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY WE WE WEREN'T
[2:19:18] TAUGHT THIS IN PENTECOST. WE WEREN'T
[2:19:20] TAUGHT THIS IN THE AMISH or the Menanite
[2:19:22] or this the other. BUT WHEN WE COME OUT
[2:19:24] TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD, THEN THE PURE
[2:19:27] WORD OF GOD TAKES OUR SINS. HE TAKES OUR
[2:19:30] ENTIRE PAST. AMEN. HE PUTS IN the sea of
[2:19:32] forgetfulness
[2:19:34] and he MAKES IT AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE
[2:19:37] IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[2:19:40] THAT'S THE GREAT MESSAGE OF THANKSGIVING
[2:19:43] THAT BROTHER RAM SAYS THAT'S WHAT I'M
[2:19:45] MORE THANKFUL FOR THAN ANYTHING THAT OUR
[2:19:48] SINS ARE GONE. OUR PAST IS GONE. WE'RE
[2:19:52] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST NOW. WE ARE HIS.
[2:19:57] He bore my shame. It wasn't your fault.
[2:20:00] Eve is the one that did it. The devil
[2:20:02] and you were trapped into it. You were
[2:20:03] deceived in it. Let me come back to
[2:20:06] this.
[2:20:08] Listen. And he could say this.
[2:20:11] Now,
[2:20:14] I might just
[2:20:17] I don't really like to, but my thought,
[2:20:20] let me let me put my thought on it.
[2:20:24] How could Brother Brandon preach this as
[2:20:27] long as denominations were still alive?
[2:20:31] Huh? How many knows Christ was in those
[2:20:33] churches?
[2:20:35] God Christ was working in the churches.
[2:20:37] They were pe people was coming in. Whole
[2:20:40] colleges would come in.
[2:20:45] In other words, the old husband wasn't
[2:20:48] dead yet. But he makes a decl
[2:20:50] declaration. Now know and so do every
[2:20:54] one of us know that the whole rank,
[2:20:58] he didn't say this earlier in his
[2:21:00] ministry. The whole rank of
[2:21:01] denominations,
[2:21:02] Pentecostals and all are dead.
[2:21:10] They're dead. That's what he said. That
[2:21:13] is to the bornag again Christian
[2:21:16] message. Your husband is dead.
[2:21:22] YOU KNOW HE'S DEAD. GOD LET IT DIE. IT'S
[2:21:25] FINISHED. All the scientific,
[2:21:27] educational, intellectual, scientific
[2:21:29] ways, Bible schools and things is
[2:21:32] perished.
[2:21:41] Amen. So, Brother Brandham declares that
[2:21:44] that husband that we were married to is
[2:21:47] dead. Now,
[2:21:50] now, how many knows that in order for
[2:21:52] that to really be dead to you, you got
[2:21:54] to be coming out of it?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Didn't Brother Bam say that they're
[2:21:59] morgs?
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Those churches are morgs.
[2:22:06] God help. Have mercy. God wake somebody
[2:22:09] up that listens to this streaming that's
[2:22:11] in a denomination.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; God has declared that it's dead. The
[2:22:16] prophet of God vindicated prophet of God
[2:22:18] declared it's dead.
[2:22:22] Amen.
[2:22:25] Now, in closing, it's getting late.
[2:22:28] He says, and so forth, we're going to
[2:22:30] have to be out in 30 minute minutes.
[2:22:32] this saying this saying this now this

[2:22:38] minutes till 11 way up in Philadelphia

[2:23:18] YOU'RE BORN A NEW. DON'T TRY TO DIG HIM
[2:23:20] UP.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; FOLKS, I've been in churches where they
[2:23:23] say, "Yeah, we believe Brother Brandham.
[2:23:25] Yeah, we believe the message, but we
[2:23:26] don't mention his name because people
[2:23:28] would be offended.
[2:23:33] Who was it?
[2:23:35] Some preacher said that some of these
[2:23:37] ministers that were told that Brother
[2:23:39] Brandham was wrong on this and wrong on
[2:23:41] that and that if they would just not
[2:23:42] teach Brother Brandham's ministry, their
[2:23:44] churches would grow and they PEOPLE
[2:23:47] WOULD FLOCK TO THEM. Now they just got a
[2:23:49] smaller group yet. They got nothing.
[2:23:53] Can I say you've been scammed?
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; You have been scammed by the devil.
[2:24:02] Don't try to dig him up. DON'T TRY TO
[2:24:05] HAVE HIM ALIVE YET. Be married to that
[2:24:07] denomination AND MARRY A MET. NO, YOU
[2:24:10] DECLARE THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR. IF
[2:24:12] IT OFFENDS SOMEBODY, WELL, I'm sorry.
[2:24:16] Not really. But
[2:24:19] I'm not sorry for preaching the message.
[2:24:21] You want to be offended, be offended.
[2:24:23] That's up to you. I REALLY DON'T CARE. I
[2:24:26] CARE ABOUT ONE THING, AND THAT'S TELLING
[2:24:27] THE TRUTH. I'M MARRIED TO CHRIST and I
[2:24:30] ain't married to nothing else. I DON'T
[2:24:31] WANT NOTHING ELSE. YOU SHOULDN'T WANT
[2:24:33] NOTHING ELSE. AND IF YOU'RE ASHAMED OF
[2:24:35] IT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO COMBINE THE TWO,
[2:24:37] YOU'RE AN ADULTERESS.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Get out THERE AND HAVE SOME
[2:24:43] BACKBONE. IF IT'S THE TRUTH, SAY IT.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE ASHAMED OF IT.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; You know what? I'd like I think we have
[2:24:54] a I'll say it at this time. We have an
[2:24:57] average about 60 or so streamers.
[2:25:01] I'd like to hear I'd like to have some
[2:25:03] feedback from those streamers. Amen.
[2:25:06] I know my brother Moes, Andrew, his son,
[2:25:09] and I greet them this morning. They've
[2:25:10] been listening to me regular
[2:25:13] giving comments on it. I led Moes to the
[2:25:16] Lord when we was first come into the
[2:25:18] message, him and Mooney.
[2:25:21] But there's a lot of them out there.
[2:25:23] Now, I'm curious.
[2:25:25] How many How many here cares about our
[2:25:27] streamers?
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. We care about our
[2:25:30] streamers.
[2:25:33] You wouldn't be streaming this if there
[2:25:35] wasn't something down in your heart. I
[2:25:37] trust there's a rebound
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; to our streamers. Something that bounces
[2:25:41] back that says, "Yeah, that sounds
[2:25:43] right. That's the truth."
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's ALL I WANT IS THE TRUTH. IF
[2:25:47] I'M WRONG, HOW MANY BELIEVES IF I'M
[2:25:49] WRONG, I'M YOU obligated to correct me.
[2:25:51] I want to be right. Amen.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz I'm not deserving of
[2:25:55] correcting unless I'm willing to be
[2:25:57] corrected. But that's what he said under
[2:25:59] a vindicated prophet. Listen, he says to
[2:26:02] Philadelphia, all of them, a union,
[2:26:04] you're dead to those husbands, born a
[2:26:07] new, don't try to dig him up. He's dead.
[2:26:09] IF YOU'RE A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN, THAT
[2:26:10] LITTLE GERM that was predestinated IN
[2:26:13] YOU, IT'S WORD COMING TO WORD ON word on
[2:26:16] word on word, COMING TO THE FULL STATURE
[2:26:18] OF CHRIST. THAT'S RIGHT. SO THAT HE CAN
[2:26:21] COME AND GET HIS BRIDE. NOW WE'RE JUST
[2:26:23] READY FOR ONE THING AND THAT'S THE
[2:26:25] COMING OF THE LORD. HOW MANY BELIEVE
[2:26:27] THAT'S WHERE WE STAND? LOOK AT HOW MUCH
[2:26:29] PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE
[2:26:31] COME FROM THE 1965. AMEN. IT'S WORD UPON
[2:26:34] WORD. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SAY I WE NEED
[2:26:36] THE STATUE OF THE PERFECT MAN. WE NEED
[2:26:39] AMEN PAUL A PRISONER. WE NEED THE
[2:26:41] GREATEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT. WE NEED
[2:26:43] THESE MESSAGES. THESE MESSAGES IS WHAT
[2:26:46] PERFECTS US. IT'S WHAT BRINGS US TO A
[2:26:48] CLOSER WALK WITH GOD. WE BECOME A
[2:26:50] COMPLETE PRISONER TO JESUS CHRIST. WE'RE
[2:26:53] MARRIED TO HIM. He's our lover.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:01] And amen.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:27:06] Final quote. Brother Bram says, "And you
[2:27:09] ministers down there in Tucson tonight,
[2:27:12] I don't hold you responsible for that.
[2:27:15] God does.
[2:27:17] I was there three years. I told you I
[2:27:19] wouldn't start a church. I didn't.
[2:27:20] Brother Perry Green started it. I was
[2:27:22] there three years.
[2:27:25] Let me just give you a little background
[2:27:26] on that. See, when Brother Brandon went
[2:27:28] to Tucson and was preaching, they didn't
[2:27:30] want him to start a church.
[2:27:33] Why? Because they had their little
[2:27:34] groups and they didn't want them no
[2:27:35] more. Jealous, greedy. What in the world
[2:27:38] was the attitude about? Why wouldn't you
[2:27:40] want a prophet of God to start a church?
[2:27:44] So, Brother Brandham didn't do it, but
[2:27:46] he was very glad that Perry Green did.
[2:27:49] And so, he could say, "I didn't start
[2:27:51] it, but if Perry Green started it, but
[2:27:54] for them to be that way, it just shows
[2:27:57] Pharah's sake, jealousy, pride."
[2:28:03] Okay.
[2:28:08] I was there three years and not one time
[2:28:10] did you invite me to your pulpit. I said
[2:28:12] in Tucson nearly three years, God will
[2:28:14] take me from the desert one of these
[2:28:17] days. This message must live. I tried my
[2:28:21] best to get into you. I know the reason
[2:28:23] you did it. You here? Only reason you
[2:28:25] did it. Your denomination would kick you
[2:28:28] out.
[2:28:30] And you know many of you has talked that
[2:28:32] I've talked to at the first restaurant
[2:28:34] and so forth. You know that's the truth.
[2:28:37] And the very next quote that brother Ram
[2:28:39] says when he's speaking,
[2:28:41] Amen. this morning, my message was both
[2:28:44] to hear and to those listening. He says
[2:28:47] the next quote he says after knowing
[2:28:48] that they had would not invite Jesus.
[2:28:54] How many knows brother Brandham could
[2:28:56] preach but then he'd have to wait for
[2:28:58] Christ to come on the scene
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; and discern. And they didn't want that.
[2:29:03] It wasn't when they turned down the
[2:29:05] prophet, they turned down Jesus
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; because that angel would never leave.
[2:29:09] Brother Brandham, how many knows he left
[2:29:11] or left him whether he was in his
[2:29:12] bedroom or wherever he was, that angel
[2:29:14] followed him everywhere. Amen. And if he
[2:29:17] he had to wait at the service and just
[2:29:19] until he began to move on him. Next
[2:29:21] quote, final quote that we're closing
[2:29:22] with, we won't keep you any longer. HE
[2:29:24] SAYS, "COME OUT OF IT. GET OUT OF THERE.
[2:29:29] COME OUT OF IT. GET OUT OF THERE,
[2:29:30] BROTHER. IF THERE'S ANY LIFE IN YOU,
[2:29:32] you'll be like that little eagle that I
[2:29:34] spoke of. You'll hear the word of God.
[2:29:36] Remember, you're going to hear this the
[2:29:38] last time one of these days. We're real
[2:29:40] close now. Amen.
[2:29:43] Amen.
[2:29:45] We're real close now. Come out of her,
[2:29:48] my people. Revelations 18. I don't know
[2:29:50] if I finished reading that, but he talks
[2:29:52] about that message that she has become
[2:29:54] the cage of every foul and unclean
[2:29:57] spirit.
[2:29:59] And he says, "Come out of her, my
[2:30:00] people." How many is glad to have heard
[2:30:01] that voice? "Come out of her, my people,
[2:30:04] that you receive not of her plagues,
[2:30:05] that you partake not of her sins. Don't
[2:30:07] be an adulteress like she is committing
[2:30:10] spiritual fornications against the word
[2:30:12] of God." God bless you. Stand this
[2:30:14] morning.
[2:30:18] How many wants to live pure and clean to
[2:30:21] the Lord Jesus Christ?
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you see the hands that are
[2:30:25] raised now, Father, and our hearts are
[2:30:26] bowed to you, God.
[2:30:28] We truly know that you have sent a
[2:30:31] message that was
[2:30:33] pure,
[2:30:35] that was clean,
[2:30:38] that was holy. It was your message,
[2:30:40] Lord. Your message of grace to the whole
[2:30:43] world,
[2:30:45] but they didn't want you. They don't
[2:30:46] want you. There's so many people, Lord,
[2:30:48] that don't want you. And when I think
[2:30:50] about that, God, all the different
[2:30:52] excuses people, oh, God, help those
[2:30:54] perhaps streaming this morning. Don't
[2:30:56] let the devil give you an excuse not to
[2:30:59] follow Christ with your whole heart.
[2:31:01] There is no real good excuse.
[2:31:05] The rich man, he had an excuse. He just
[2:31:08] couldn't do it. Give up his riches.
[2:31:11] God, help us this morning, Lord, to give
[2:31:13] everything up for you. We're not ashamed
[2:31:14] of you, but to give it all up for you,
[2:31:17] Lord Jesus, so that we can follow you
[2:31:19] holy, Lord. I pray for this congregation
[2:31:21] here this morning, this little church,
[2:31:24] Evening Light Tabernacle, every saint,
[2:31:26] every person,
[2:31:28] those streaming, God, that you'll help
[2:31:31] them search their hearts. Lord, prick
[2:31:34] their conscience.
[2:31:36] Help them ask themselves if they have
[2:31:38] added to taken away, or if they're more
[2:31:41] of a lover of themselves more than they
[2:31:44] are lovers of God. Help us to be, so to
[2:31:47] speak, fanatical about loving you
[2:31:49] instead of being fanatical about being a
[2:31:52] boaster and proud and and selfish,
[2:31:55] lovers of oursel. God, I pray, Lord,
[2:31:58] this morning, Lord Jesus, that you would
[2:31:59] help each one this morning under the
[2:32:01] sound of my voice, Lord, to rededicate
[2:32:03] their lives and say, "Lord Jesus, I
[2:32:05] rededicate myself a new, aresh to you,
[2:32:07] Lord. I'm your wife, Lord, and I won't
[2:32:10] let any thought come into my life. I
[2:32:12] won't be obedient to anything the devil
[2:32:13] tries to tell me. And he thought that he
[2:32:16] puts into my heart. I won't follow man's
[2:32:18] tradition. I won't follow my own ways
[2:32:21] cuz I want your ways. I will not be like
[2:32:23] Cain who worshiped you. But he offered
[2:32:26] up what he wanted to offer up. And if
[2:32:27] God didn't accept it, well, that's just
[2:32:29] the best that he could do. Lord, that's
[2:32:31] not the way we want. We don't want our
[2:32:33] way. We want your way. Lord, today we
[2:32:36] ask God that you would take, Lord, this
[2:32:38] congregation of group of people, Lord.
[2:32:40] Father, form us and mold us, Lord, into
[2:32:43] the image of Jesus Christ. Have us ready
[2:32:45] for that rapture that could happen just
[2:32:47] any day now, Lord. Lord, we believe that
[2:32:50] these scriptures, Lord, lightning's
[2:32:53] flash, the thunders rolled as it was in
[2:32:55] the days of Noah, Lord, if that door
[2:32:58] would have still been open, no doubt,
[2:32:59] but people would have run to that door
[2:33:00] and say, "I hear the thunder. I hear the
[2:33:03] flashing." And Lord Jesus, we see the
[2:33:04] signs around us. We see the woman in
[2:33:06] purple. We see the nations falling
[2:33:08] apart. We need we hear the lightning. We
[2:33:11] see the thunder and the mercy's doors
[2:33:13] still open. God, help people to run for
[2:33:15] mercy. Help them to run into the doors.
[2:33:18] Come into Jesus Christ quickly before
[2:33:20] it's too late,
[2:33:22] Lord. And then there will be those who
[2:33:24] have heard it that'll be in the
[2:33:25] tribulation period.
[2:33:28] and they'll say, "Oh, if I would have
[2:33:30] just accepted, if I would have just
[2:33:31] received it, I had my chance."
[2:33:37] Lord Jesus, I just pray, God, keep and
[2:33:39] bring everyone of your children into the
[2:33:41] fold just now. There's any in here that
[2:33:44] doesn't have the Holy Ghost, may they
[2:33:45] raise their hand and say, "God, I want
[2:33:46] the Holy Ghost right now. I need the
[2:33:49] Holy Ghost right now. I pray, Father,
[2:33:50] you'll come down as my hands go up. You
[2:33:53] come down into my heart. Forgive me of
[2:33:54] all my sins, my failures, Lord, and draw
[2:33:57] me closer to you, Lord. Father, in this
[2:33:59] Thanksgiving, Lord Jesus, as we're
[2:34:01] enjoying our times around our family,
[2:34:03] Lord, Father, we'll have a time, God, be
[2:34:05] the morning and we won't miss our prayer
[2:34:07] meetings, we won't mere miss our time
[2:34:10] with you, Lord Jesus. We won't get so
[2:34:12] carried away with the with the the
[2:34:14] holiday, God, that we neglect you, Lord
[2:34:16] Jesus. But we'll keep you alive. We'll
[2:34:19] keep you really fed, Lord Jesus. We'll
[2:34:21] feed on you. Amen. Let the Holy Spirit
[2:34:23] feed on the word God.
[2:34:26] Help everyone God today Lord to be so
[2:34:29] thankful Lord Jesus for what you have
[2:34:31] done in our generation Lord how you
[2:34:34] brought us out God. How you called us
[2:34:36] out. How did you forgave us and even AS
[2:34:38] YOUR PROPHET HAS said if you are
[2:34:40] believing every word, every jot, every
[2:34:42] tit. You are the virtuous bride of Jesus
[2:34:45] Christ. Not one sin, not one blat blot
[2:34:48] against you. But father, I believe that
[2:34:50] this message has come to bring us to
[2:34:51] that place that we are without spot
[2:34:54] according to Ephesians and without
[2:34:56] wrinkle. Lord, and that's what every
[2:34:58] hand that's up wants to be, God. We want
[2:35:00] to meet you, Lord. Not having our own
[2:35:02] righteousness, but yours, Father. We
[2:35:05] ask, God, that you bless now in Jesus
[2:35:08] name.
[2:35:10] Amen. And amen. God bless you. Amen. You
[2:35:13] love the Lord. Thank you for letting me
[2:35:16] go along, being patient. I trust the
