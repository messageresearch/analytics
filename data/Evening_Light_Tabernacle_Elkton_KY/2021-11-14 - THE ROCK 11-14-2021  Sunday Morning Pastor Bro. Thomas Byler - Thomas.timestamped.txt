[2:33] god bless you may be seated brother
[2:35] brian
[2:47] good morning brothers and sisters
[2:50] you know that first verse
[2:54] that we we started with it goes i cry
[2:56] with my whole heart hear me o lord and i
[2:59] will keep thy statutes
[3:01] that's what
[3:03] everything we do is based upon our whole
[3:05] heart everything that we have we offer
[3:07] to him we you know you don't hold
[3:09] anything back you give everything of
[3:11] yourself to him
[3:13] and in return he gives you his presence
[3:15] back to fill your spirit
[3:17] you know um before i get started the uh
[3:21] step back a little bit
[3:22] yeah
[3:24] i've been giving you an update right now
[3:26] the uh
[3:28] the building loan that we have
[3:30] left
[3:31] uh we're at about eighty one thousand
[3:33] seven hundred and ninety one thousand
[3:36] dollars
[3:37] uh i'm not hurting the church at all
[3:41] i don't know if we'll break into the
[3:42] seventies this year uh going into the we
[3:45] might uh
[3:46] but like i said we're
[3:48] it's slowly but surely knocking it down
[3:51] uh the last couple of times they've been
[3:53] just wanting me to pay the interest and
[3:55] not the principal so that lets me know
[3:57] that i'm several years ahead of the
[4:00] maturity date of the loan so i thought
[4:02] i'd let you know and
[4:04] one
[4:05] that um
[4:06] there's no other issues um
[4:09] like i said the fuel's all paid for i
[4:11] turned the heat on about almost it's
[4:13] been almost a month and
[4:15] through through the history of running
[4:17] it i found out actually if i turn it off
[4:19] turn it on early instead of waiting to
[4:21] the first cold spot
[4:23] i actually we use less fuel than when i
[4:26] turn on in december or january or
[4:29] december or late november when it gets
[4:31] really cold so it's work out that it
[4:34] doesn't burn with
[4:35] we have a still almost have a full tank
[4:37] we're like it's 71 72 out there
[4:40] on the big tank so
[4:42] you know we might have i know some of
[4:44] you are wanting a mild winter i guess
[4:47] some of us have different ideas about
[4:48] what the winter should be but uh maybe
[4:51] the lord will bless us with a mild
[4:53] winter where we
[4:54] we don't use a lot of fuel
[4:56] and in reserve right now i've told you
[4:58] before we have about
[5:00] twenty two hundred dollars for fuel so
[5:02] we should as unless up major breaks in
[5:04] the church
[5:05] we're we're on pretty good grounds
[5:08] but i was going to read a few of these
[5:10] proverbs before i jump into something
[5:12] else
[5:13] i might be all over the plate this
[5:14] morning you'll have to forgive me for
[5:16] that
[5:17] but i was
[5:18] i'm not trying to be funny here but i
[5:20] was reading this message book
[5:22] and it goes uh
[5:24] it's 8th december 1957
[5:27] and i was also listening to a message
[5:29] this morning but i forgot to write down
[5:31] the year i should have wrote down the
[5:32] year but it's when brother brown was
[5:34] preaching at one of the indian
[5:36] reservations and it was pretty good
[5:39] i should have i thought i wrote yeah i
[5:41] did write it down it was a march 5th
[5:43] 1954
[5:44] and that message out that indian
[5:46] reservation
[5:48] god provides our way of
[5:51] of deal of healing you know god provides
[5:53] a way of healing
[5:54] you could say god provides a way of
[5:56] deliverance too and anything you know i
[5:58] don't
[5:59] i'm just one person but you know
[6:01] wherever you're at this morning i'm not
[6:03] afraid to say that i know god's word
[6:05] stands true to that wherever you are at
[6:08] this morning male female young or old
[6:11] god is more than able to whatever your
[6:13] need is this morning to meet it and all
[6:15] you have to do is reach out in faith and
[6:18] grab that promise that god has laying
[6:20] there for you you know i get
[6:22] people can't do it for you they can pray
[6:24] for you
[6:25] they can encourage you they can push you
[6:27] but you are actually in faith have to
[6:29] reach out and grab that promise for
[6:31] yourself
[6:32] and a lot of times that's where people
[6:34] fall short is
[6:35] they they don't have enough faith to
[6:37] reach out and grab that promise and
[6:39] that's the whole purpose
[6:40] everyone's here this morning is that
[6:42] that faith that god lays in your heart
[6:45] will grow stronger that you might be
[6:47] able to exercise exercise those things
[6:50] that god says you need or what you think
[6:53] you need in your life this morning but i
[6:55] was going to read this i'm not trying to
[6:57] be funny but i was just thinking we live
[6:59] in a different day than when he was
[7:01] saying this
[7:02] and this uh i think i mentioned with
[7:04] this message is that i stand at the door
[7:06] and knock it kind of deals with what bro
[7:10] thomas has been preaching
[7:12] uh
[7:13] but you know brother branham talked a
[7:14] lot about about what
[7:17] jesus is standing at the door but i'll
[7:19] just read what he wrote here
[7:21] and uh
[7:22] you know it deals with that painting you
[7:24] know where christ is on the outside
[7:26] knocking and there's no
[7:28] there's no doorknob on the outside for
[7:30] him to get in it's you as the individual
[7:32] you're the only one that has a knob
[7:34] you're the only one that can open the
[7:36] door and let christ into your heart and
[7:38] into your life it's an individual thing
[7:41] you have to do that and he's knocking
[7:43] but i'll just read what it has to say
[7:46] and and i'll start at this 20th verse
[7:48] it's the fourth page in this in this
[7:50] book
[7:51] and the painter said oh no
[7:53] you misunderstand
[7:55] latch was on the outside he would raise
[7:57] the latch and go in but the latch is on
[7:59] the inside the person inside must lift
[8:02] the latch
[8:03] and that's the way it is with jesus with
[8:05] all his mercy and all of his compassion
[8:09] yet you are the person that will let him
[8:11] in or keep him out
[8:13] you have a latch on your side so that's
[8:16] what i goes about what i said earlier
[8:18] everything that will happen to you is
[8:20] based upon you reaching out for it
[8:23] and it goes on what would a man what
[8:26] would a man knock at another man's door
[8:28] for what would be the reason why it's
[8:30] the gain entrance he wants to come in he
[8:33] wants to go
[8:34] he's got something that he wants to talk
[8:36] about or something to show you when
[8:38] someone knocks at your door you know and
[8:40] it just
[8:41] and he goes they're wanting to gain an
[8:43] entrance or a little fellowship or
[8:45] something to talk to you about that's
[8:47] the reason jesus knocks at our door
[8:50] and i was just gonna
[8:52] jump over here
[8:54] but i was just thinking
[8:56] uh he you know how he talks about if
[8:57] caesar augustus was knocking at the door
[9:00] of your house of course she would let
[9:01] him in
[9:02] or if he at this time eisenhower was the
[9:05] president of the united states if the
[9:07] president knocked at your door you would
[9:10] be more than willing to knock him in and
[9:12] i'm not trying to be funny here but you
[9:14] bring it up 50 years later if the if the
[9:16] president or some of the politicians
[9:18] were knocking at your door i i don't
[9:21] know if you'd want to let him in today
[9:23] but i'm not trying to be funny but
[9:25] that's how
[9:26] much in 50 this is not 50 years this is
[9:29] almost 70 years ago how much
[9:31] things have changed but i'll just read
[9:33] what he had to say you know it's not
[9:35] what i say it's what what he has to say
[9:37] that's an important he talks about uh
[9:39] and of course in this world culture we
[9:41] live in he mentioned hitler you know if
[9:44] hitler knocked out a german store of
[9:45] course he would let him in or if you
[9:47] said something like that today they i
[9:50] hate to see what they would say about
[9:51] you today but he goes on this is the
[9:53] 27th quote here
[9:55] and you have to watch the important and
[9:57] this is what i'm thinking about
[9:59] just because someone's knocking at the
[10:01] door you gotta watch his support his
[10:03] importance what's he knocking at your
[10:05] door for what does he want from you
[10:08] you have to look it at it in both ways
[10:09] when christ knocks at the door he only
[10:12] wants your benefit he wants it's
[10:14] something good for you but there are
[10:16] other people that might or other things
[10:17] that might knock at the heart
[10:19] or at your door that you really don't
[10:21] need to let in but i'll just read what
[10:23] he had to say
[10:25] why would would he throw the door open
[10:28] and fell on us well i'm not going to
[10:30] read that at the 20 and you have to
[10:32] watch the importance of the person
[10:33] that's knocking at your door
[10:35] that has to do with it it has a a beggar
[10:38] you might have a right to close the door
[10:40] not to go to the door
[10:42] if you had nothing to give him while you
[10:44] felt ill at the beggar
[10:46] but if he was an important person he
[10:48] goes on to say i would say today if it
[10:50] was president the white eisenhower come
[10:52] here to jeffersonville today and knocked
[10:55] at the door
[10:56] of any good democrat you would feel very
[10:59] much honored to go to the door and
[11:01] welcome president eisenhower
[11:03] though you differ with him in politics
[11:05] you would certainly appreciate him
[11:06] knocking
[11:07] at your door and that's what i'm not
[11:09] trying to be funny but that's the
[11:10] difference 60 70 years later you know
[11:13] they're so people are so opposed to each
[11:15] other that you couldn't have that common
[11:18] ground anymore
[11:19] though they differ with him in politics
[11:21] you would certainly not appreci you
[11:23] would appreciate with him knocking at
[11:25] your door that's why he's the president
[11:27] of the united states he's a man of great
[11:29] importance though you differ with him in
[11:31] politics it would be an honor for any
[11:33] democrat in this city or any other city
[11:36] to entertain the president dwight
[11:38] eisenhower because of his importance as
[11:40] the president of the united states he's
[11:42] a great man honorable man
[11:44] and has an honorable position and he
[11:46] just goes on and explaining it but i
[11:48] just go back
[11:50] to this quote number 27 it has to do
[11:52] with what i was thinking you have to
[11:54] watch who's what's knocking at the door
[11:56] of your heart of the door of your life
[11:58] but you have to watch the importance of
[12:00] the person that you're knocking at your
[12:02] door
[12:03] that has to do with it you know that's
[12:05] you got to be careful what you let in
[12:07] because you might not be able to get it
[12:09] out of your out of your house again
[12:11] but i'm gonna just read a few of these
[12:14] well i'll jump
[12:18] i'll just read a few of these proverbs i
[12:20] was just thinking this morning
[12:22] i was reading some of these proverbs
[12:24] last night when i was down in my office
[12:26] but if you would want to turn it would
[12:28] be proverbs the 14th chapter
[12:37] and and you all know i re i keep read
[12:39] reading that book the pilgrims progress
[12:40] and i was i read the two different
[12:42] there's part one and part two
[12:44] and his wife and christian himself they
[12:47] have the same they go to the same rooms
[12:50] and they see the same things it might
[12:52] have a little different interpretation
[12:54] but the part i was reading this morning
[12:57] has to do where they go into the
[12:59] interpreter's house and they go into
[13:01] that run room
[13:02] and
[13:04] there's a man there with a muckrake and
[13:06] then above him was christ with a crown
[13:08] and then the man never looks up he's
[13:10] always looking to the ground always
[13:12] looking to the world and he never looks
[13:14] up to see what god really has for him it
[13:16] goes to what i was saying earlier about
[13:20] what's knocking at your door you
[13:23] the world we live in is so worldly so
[13:25] consumed with the things of this life
[13:28] and the things of this world that no one
[13:29] ever looks up anymore to what god has
[13:32] formed and i'll read uh about the sixth
[13:34] started about the sixth verse
[13:37] i scorn the seeketh wisdoms in front of
[13:39] the enough but knowledge is easy on to
[13:41] him that understands and that
[13:42] understanding again
[13:44] goes back to what i said in the
[13:46] beginning you have to be able and
[13:48] willing to open your heart to christ the
[13:51] understanding that we desire that we
[13:53] want isn't an earthly understanding but
[13:55] it's a christian understanding
[13:57] go from the presence of a foolish man
[14:00] when thou perceiveth not in him the lips
[14:02] of knowledge
[14:03] the wisdom of the putin is to understand
[14:06] his ways but the folly of fools is
[14:08] deceit
[14:10] fools make a mock of that sin but among
[14:13] the righteous there is favor and you see
[14:15] that in the world we live in right now
[14:16] the things that you call
[14:18] pure and the things that you that you
[14:20] know that are righteous they just laugh
[14:22] at you you know they just think it's
[14:25] they
[14:26] they don't they don't believe you but
[14:28] it's we're past where they don't believe
[14:29] you anymore they make fun of you and
[14:32] we're getting to a point they'll almost
[14:33] be willing to kill you over it again and
[14:36] he goes the heart knows his own
[14:38] bitterness and the strange enough
[14:40] not in the middle with his joy the house
[14:42] of the wicked shall be overthrown but
[14:44] the tabernacle of the upright shall
[14:47] flourish
[14:48] and we all know this scripture here
[14:50] brother branham preached a lot of
[14:51] messages out of this
[14:53] there's a way out that seemeth right on
[14:55] to man
[14:56] but the end there thereof are ways or
[14:59] the ways of death
[15:00] and i'll just finish with that thought
[15:08] whatever wherever you're at this morning
[15:10] wherever i'm at this morning there is a
[15:12] way provided for all of us this morning
[15:14] and that's what we come here for so that
[15:16] god could speak to our hearts and our
[15:18] lives this morning just got to hold hold
[15:21] out just got to believe that god's got a
[15:22] problem it's got something for you
[15:25] whatever it is god was more than able to
[15:28] meet that need brother david
[15:52] uh
[15:54] hey man you love him with all your heart
[15:56] this morning
[15:57] amen let's stand this morning if we
[15:58] could and
[16:01] amen and it's just good to be in the
[16:03] house of the lord this morning and
[16:05] be in his presence this morning
[16:07] listening that little course
[16:09] i am one of the few this morning it's
[16:12] page 464. and
[16:15] hey man are you glad you're one of the

[16:27] the few and by faith in god's word i can
[16:32] claim it
[16:34] oh the way may seem long though the
[16:38] opposition's strong for the pride
[16:42] there's a way
[16:43] probably
[16:46] oh if i plan to go through just to hope
[16:51] will not do
[16:53] i must be firmly
[16:56] decided
[16:59] to

[17:40] [Music]
[17:42] just to hope will not live i must be
[17:48] firmly

[17:52] to
[17:53] follow the

[36:40] uh
[36:42] i'd asked you here a few weeks ago
[36:44] we've been remembering my sister in
[36:46] prayer she'd had another
[36:48] spot come up on her lungs and they
[36:50] thought it was cancerous and
[36:52] they were wanting to do radiation and
[36:55] she was just really not too keen on
[36:58] the radiation again she asked different
[37:00] ones to pray and we've been praying and
[37:03] she went back to the i can't say what
[37:05] kind of doctor it is because i'd mess it
[37:06] up but went back to the doctor the other
[37:08] day and he told her he said that they
[37:10] just weren't going to do any radiation
[37:13] because that spot had always been there
[37:15] and it didn't look any different than it
[37:17] had when they went back
[37:19] before they took out part of her lung
[37:21] before
[37:22] and he said he just didn't think there
[37:23] was any need for it and
[37:25] she was just praising the lord that it
[37:27] hadn't grown
[37:28] and they said we really don't even know
[37:30] what it is
[37:31] we really don't know that it's cancerous
[37:33] so we're just not gonna do nothing and
[37:35] she was just overjoyed and we just want
[37:37] to thank the church for praying
[37:39] for her and we just just we just know
[37:41] god is an awesome god this morning and

[37:52] but you know what
[37:54] nothing never excites god
[37:56] whatever we go through
[37:58] and as human beings that's hard for us
[38:00] to understand
[38:02] but god doesn't
[38:04] he doesn't worry
[38:06] he doesn't lose sleep he doesn't
[38:08] get all beside himself because things

[47:03] three are gathered together

[47:07] midst so lord you knew we would be

[47:10] appreciative lord jesus of your promise
[47:12] that wherever we do god gather together
[47:15] there you are in our midst we desire our
[47:17] father this morning that you'll have the
[47:19] full preeminence in the service lord
[47:22] that you would look down in each one of
[47:23] our hearts in our lives to see where
[47:25] we're at with you lord and then to begin
[47:27] to deal with us

[48:09] our heart now in jesus name
[48:11] amen and amen
[48:14] amen
[48:17] my one
[48:18] all right i'm flipping it over now
[48:21] try that
[48:22] all right
[48:27] amen god is good
[48:29] so what did we speak on last
[48:33] was it the shepherd
[48:35] the good shepherd i think it was
[48:36] wednesday night amen so amen i've really
[48:40] amen i'll tell you what i've enjoyed
[48:41] these series i've enjoyed
[48:43] you meant just going down the list here
[48:45] a little bit and glorifying god amen
[48:48] and talking about the lord and his
[48:49] attributes and who he is
[48:51] amen i don't know if i've ever done this
[48:53] before or not i really don't know i may
[48:54] have talked i know i've talked about the
[48:56] attributes of god but i don't think i've
[48:58] ever taken a series on it that i know of
[49:00] because as old as i am i probably don't
[49:02] forgot probably the first four years or
[49:04] something i did it you know but i do
[49:06] know i do remember that
[49:08] uh i used to have a blanket i think up
[49:11] here and showed the different attributes
[49:12] and different things that he is
[49:14] but amen i just feel them felt impressed
[49:16] to go
[49:17] amen and then and take this as a series
[49:20] so this morning amen
[49:23] are you already here what we're going to
[49:24] speak on this morning
[49:26] amen all right so i brought this out
[49:28] this morning amen and of course you
[49:30] can't see it i know because i gotta have
[49:32] glasses to see it this close
[49:34] but and he shall be called advocate
[49:38] uh lamb of god and so forth but
[49:42] this evening or this afternoon or
[49:44] afternoon this morning i mean evening
[49:46] i'm getting it all backwards we want to
[49:48] speak on
[49:49] that right there
[49:51] which is the rock amen
[49:54] the rock he is the rock
[49:56] amen and so
[49:59] amen if you will turn your bibles and
[50:01] we'll go into
[50:03] first corinthians
[50:05] first corinthians
[50:14] hmm
[50:23] first corinthians 10
[50:27] and i think we could probably just
[50:30] do all scripture reading this morning
[50:32] because i've got quite a few of them
[50:34] amen and so i do want to read quite a
[50:36] few of them but
[50:37] i'll tell you what i'll tell you what
[50:39] when you get into the word of god you
[50:40] realize that
[50:42] you know my word ain't much but we know
[50:43] that his is
[50:45] i mean knows that
[50:46] uh you know
[50:48] i could mess up i could say something
[50:49] wrong but when you read the scriptures
[50:51] you know you're reading something that
[50:53] is not wrong
[50:54] amen god doesn't mess up amen
[50:57] so first corinthians 10
[50:59] and
[51:03] we'll read one
[51:06] through
[51:09] 12 which is quite a few scriptures
[51:12] but it's kind of an example of something
[51:14] we want to read so he says moreover
[51:15] brethren i would not that ye should be
[51:17] ignorant
[51:18] how that our fathers were under the
[51:19] cloud and all pass through the sea and
[51:22] we're all baptized unto moses in cloud
[51:25] and in the sea
[51:26] and didn't eat all the same spiritual
[51:29] meat and did all drink the same
[51:30] spiritual drink
[51:32] for the drink of that spiritual rock
[51:34] that followed them and that rock
[51:37] was
[51:38] christ how many believes christ is the
[51:41] rock
[51:43] amen
[51:44] but with many of them god was not
[51:45] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[51:48] wilderness now these things were our
[51:50] examples
[51:51] to the intent that we should not lust
[51:53] after evil things as they also lust that
[51:56] neither be idolaters as some of them
[51:59] uh them as it was written the people sat
[52:02] down to eat and to drink and to rose up
[52:04] to play
[52:05] neither let us commit fornication as
[52:07] some of them committed and fell in one
[52:09] day three and twenty thousand
[52:12] neither let us tempt christ as some of
[52:14] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[52:16] serpents
[52:17] neither murmur yes some of them also
[52:19] murmured and were destroyed of the
[52:21] destroyer
[52:23] now these things happen unto them for
[52:25] examples
[52:26] and they are written for our admonition
[52:28] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[52:31] wherefore let him that
[52:33] thinketh he standeth take heed at least
[52:35] he
[52:36] fall may god had his blessings to the
[52:38] reading words you can be seated
[52:42] so this establishes that christ is our
[52:45] rock how many believe that
[52:47] he is the rock amen that was in the
[52:50] wilderness amen that they followed amen
[52:53] and follow them
[52:55] amen in the wilderness in second samuel
[52:58] i'm going to read another one
[53:00] in second samuel
[53:03] amen david understood
[53:06] what it was like to have a rock
[53:09] in his life
[53:10] what the rock was like in his life amen
[53:12] as i thought about this message i
[53:14] thought about how that david took a
[53:16] smooth stone that he took a little rock
[53:19] right a smooth rock a smooth stone and
[53:22] killed goliath with but how many knows
[53:24] that it wasn't the smooth stone that did
[53:26] it
[53:27] it was the rock that guided the smooth
[53:30] stone amen because that smooth stone
[53:32] would have never found its place if it
[53:34] wouldn't have been for the rock
[53:36] amen in second samuel the 22nd chapter
[53:40] he says david's spake unto the lord the
[53:42] words of this song in the day that the
[53:44] lord had delivered him out of the hand
[53:46] of all of his enemies and out of the
[53:48] hand of saul amen into something how
[53:51] that david after he was delivered out of
[53:53] all of the hands of his enemies after
[53:56] god had delivered him
[53:58] right
[53:59] and the hand of saul he said the lord is
[54:03] my
[54:04] rock
[54:06] amen
[54:08] and my fortress and my deliverer
[54:12] praise be to god how many is glad to
[54:14] have a rock now
[54:16] you mean we'll talk about that some of
[54:18] the
[54:19] the other avenue but let me go to
[54:20] another one
[54:22] amen
[54:24] let's go to uh matthew if you will
[54:28] to the book of matthew
[54:30] the seventh chapter
[54:33] matthew 7.
[54:42] talk about a rock
[54:47] in verse 21 it says not everyone that
[54:49] sayeth unto me
[54:50] 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto
[54:52] me lord lord shall enter into the
[54:54] kingdom of heaven
[54:55] but he that doeth the will of my father
[54:59] which is in heaven
[55:01] many will say unto me in that day lord
[55:03] haven't we prophesied in thy name and in
[55:05] that day name cast out devils and then
[55:08] many wonderful works and then shall i
[55:10] profess answer them i never knew you
[55:12] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[55:15] therefore verse 24 whosoever heareth
[55:18] these sayings of mine and doeth them
[55:21] i will liken into him unto a wise man
[55:24] which built his house upon the rock
[55:28] amen how many knows it's important to
[55:31] build your house
[55:33] amen
[55:34] upon a rock
[55:38] the real you the inside of you not just
[55:41] some building somewhere but you are the
[55:43] house that he's talking about
[55:45] yourself your soul build your soul
[55:49] upon a rock
[55:52] now how do you do that well we find out
[55:54] these other people they
[55:56] they could do miracles and they'd cast
[55:58] out devils and all these wonderful works
[56:01] but god still
[56:03] said depart from me isn't that right
[56:05] because why did they all be why did it
[56:07] why is god going to
[56:11] reject them on that day
[56:13] the reason that he's going to reject
[56:14] them that day is because they knew
[56:17] better and they didn't do it
[56:21] iniquity it's no better than that to do
[56:23] it and the other thing is and the one
[56:25] that listen the wise man builds upon he
[56:27] is the one that actually
[56:29] doeth what god wants
[56:34] all right
[56:36] let that sink in real good
[56:38] if you're gonna build your house on the
[56:39] rock what do you have to do
[56:42] go ahead
[56:44] do what he says
[56:47] do what he says
[56:49] amen
[56:54] all right
[56:55] and the reigns descended the floods came
[56:57] the winds blew
[56:59] and beat upon that house welcome to the
[57:02] storm how many knows we're in a storm
[57:05] this life is a storm
[57:09] this life has a lot of winds to it a lot
[57:11] of strong winds a lot of things that's
[57:14] going to push you over if you aren't
[57:16] careful
[57:17] a lot of things that's going to knock
[57:19] you down
[57:21] amen
[57:24] my
[57:25] and beat upon that house and it fell
[57:28] for it was oh and it fell not for he was
[57:30] founded upon a rock winds blew and beat
[57:33] him on the house and it fell not for he
[57:34] was found upon the rock and everyone
[57:36] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[57:38] doeth them not shall be like and unto a
[57:40] foolish man which built his house upon
[57:43] the sand
[57:46] and the rains descended and the floods
[57:47] came the winds blew and beat upon that
[57:49] house and it fell and great was the fall
[57:52] of it amen great was the fall of it
[58:00] so
[58:01] we find out that if you don't build upon
[58:03] the rock you're going
[58:04] to fall
[58:06] right
[58:08] you can't stand you won't stand
[58:11] amen in acts 4
[58:16] in acts 4.
[58:22] verse 8 it says then peter filled with
[58:24] the holy ghost
[58:26] said unto them ye rulers of the people
[58:28] and elders of israel
[58:31] if we this day be examined for the good
[58:33] deed done unto the impotent man by what
[58:36] means he is made whole
[58:39] be it known unto you all and all the
[58:41] people of israel that by the name of
[58:43] jesus christ of nazareth whom he
[58:46] crucified whom god raised from the dead
[58:49] even by him that this man stand here
[58:53] before you hope
[58:55] this is the stone this is the stone
[58:57] which was set at not of you builders
[59:01] which is become the head of the corner
[59:04] amen
[59:06] neither is there salvation in any other
[59:08] for there is no other name given under
[59:11] heaven among men whereby you must be
[59:14] saved
[59:15] wouldn't it be nice to have a loud
[59:17] speaker that goes all across the world
[59:19] to be able to say that right there let
[59:22] all the world know that there is only
[59:24] one name under heaven given whereby you
[59:28] have to
[59:29] be saved
[59:30] i believe it was paul that said you know
[59:32] there is no other foundation laid
[59:35] than christ jesus
[59:37] i mean at least he is the foundation and
[59:39] there is no other foundation
[59:41] and you pour your concr your foundation
[59:44] out of rock out of concrete something
[59:46] solid and christ is the chief
[59:49] cornerstone they rejected the rock
[59:54] i mean that's why titus besieged israel
[59:57] or jerusalem and they were all inside of
[1:00:00] there boiling each other's children and
[1:00:02] eating the leaves off the tree in the
[1:00:04] bark of the tree it's because they
[1:00:06] reject
[1:00:07] at the chief cornerstone
[1:00:11] those who accept that the chief
[1:00:12] cornerstone escaped out of there before
[1:00:16] it was besieged because they were had
[1:00:18] the holy ghost to warn them get out of
[1:00:20] there
[1:00:21] in 70 a.d isn't that right they got out
[1:00:24] of there before titus came in and
[1:00:27] captured them and killed everybody and
[1:00:28] knocked the city completely to the
[1:00:30] ground
[1:00:31] and they were scattered to all nations
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:36] praise the lord
[1:00:38] and we're talking about something that
[1:00:40] is absolutely silent how many knows a
[1:00:43] rock is solid
[1:00:48] just comes to me thinking about it i
[1:00:50] believe revelations are talking about
[1:00:52] that the stone that was shown out of the
[1:00:54] mountain right the stone that is shoot
[1:00:56] out of the mountain amen is going to
[1:00:59] come
[1:01:00] and crush all nations to powder
[1:01:06] grind them to powder which is christ
[1:01:09] how many of those are going to be ashes
[1:01:11] under the souls of our feet
[1:01:14] all evil all we all wrong will be ashes
[1:01:18] under the feet of the righteous
[1:01:22] and the rock is going to do it
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:28] now we're we're we're put we are put in
[1:01:30] this life and in this mortality amen it
[1:01:34] is all shifting sins
[1:01:36] i believe it's a song that talks about
[1:01:38] uh
[1:01:39] time is filled with swift transition
[1:01:43] how many believes that it's shifting
[1:01:45] time is shifting things are shifting
[1:01:50] you look at america you look at the
[1:01:52] world in one person's lifetime 100 years
[1:01:56] and look at how much it has shifted look
[1:01:59] at how much it has changed
[1:02:06] amen but how many knows god is the same
[1:02:09] forever he don't change
[1:02:13] he don't have to get one bit better ever
[1:02:17] he doesn't have to change one little bit
[1:02:20] you and i have to change
[1:02:22] i'm going to be you and i got to change
[1:02:24] but god don't have to change
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:32] was it brother
[1:02:33] neph orman neville i believe it was
[1:02:34] brother brahm talked about he says you
[1:02:36] know the thing i like about him is he's
[1:02:38] always the same
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] folks trust me this morning we're going
[1:02:44] to get right down detail to our lives
[1:02:47] each and every one of us
[1:02:50] amen we're going to talk about standing
[1:02:52] not falling
[1:02:53] we're talking about not slipping
[1:02:56] amen not getting the devil to cause you
[1:02:58] to fall
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] and we're going to find out why people
[1:03:06] are
[1:03:07] even by the brand of preacher mexico why
[1:03:09] are there people so tossed about
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:17] we'll find out why but listen so let's
[1:03:18] go on here
[1:03:20] it's an important thing
[1:03:22] this rock is important that's why he
[1:03:24] called the rock of ages any man any
[1:03:27] generation
[1:03:30] that doesn't have that rock goes into
[1:03:32] apostasy
[1:03:34] but every generation needed christ they
[1:03:37] need god because like i said we're in
[1:03:39] sifting sand if you're not born again
[1:03:42] you're on shifting sand
[1:03:46] anything outside god is sinned
[1:03:50] anything contrary to the word of god is
[1:03:52] sand
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:03:57] anybody that misinterprets the word is
[1:03:59] sand
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:05] my
[1:04:08] time is filled with swift transition
[1:04:12] now
[1:04:14] i want you to understand
[1:04:16] that god wants you to be built
[1:04:19] upon a rock
[1:04:21] that rock is unmovable
[1:04:25] when you're anchored it has to do with
[1:04:27] the anchor being anchored to this rock
[1:04:31] amen
[1:04:33] praise the lord and christ is that rock
[1:04:37] let's go to jude we're going to go back
[1:04:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:43] all right
[1:04:45] how god feels
[1:04:52] and how important it is
[1:04:57] let me uh let me go to ephesians first
[1:05:00] i hate doing this because i've got a lot
[1:05:02] and i don't want to get confused but
[1:05:03] we're going to
[1:05:04] go to ephesians 4 first okay
[1:05:07] ephesians 4 so i can kind of give you a
[1:05:10] little better picture
[1:05:14] ephesians 4
[1:05:20] now how many knows it talks about the
[1:05:22] fivefold ministry and so forth give us
[1:05:24] pastors teachers for the perfecting the
[1:05:26] saints for the edifying of the body of
[1:05:28] christ
[1:05:30] verse 14 says so that we henceforth be
[1:05:35] no more children
[1:05:37] toss to and fro
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:44] god doesn't want you be taught he don't
[1:05:46] want you to be moved
[1:05:49] once you're on that rock god don't ever
[1:05:51] want you to move from that rock
[1:05:55] huh
[1:05:57] now we just read a scripture in
[1:06:00] in corinthians there
[1:06:02] where they had that rock they had christ
[1:06:05] with them but if every example of how
[1:06:08] these people were constantly slipping
[1:06:12] they were constantly being moved
[1:06:16] with every temptation with every time
[1:06:18] they got thirsty they murmured they
[1:06:20] complained when they got hungry they
[1:06:21] remembered they complained
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:24] they never just stay with the rock
[1:06:29] and i find
[1:06:30] that there are some people that claim to
[1:06:32] be christians but they're always being
[1:06:35] moved about
[1:06:38] huh
[1:06:41] just the least little flame can just
[1:06:44] waste
[1:06:47] and that's where israel was
[1:06:49] god wants you to get on that rock and
[1:06:52] stay on that rock
[1:06:54] be unmovable
[1:06:58] don't be tossed to and fro and carried
[1:07:00] about with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:07:02] slight of men
[1:07:04] amen by cunning craftiness
[1:07:08] whereby they lie in wait to deceive
[1:07:12] all right speaking but speaking the
[1:07:14] truth in love now in jew jude 1 and
[1:07:17] verse
[1:07:19] 4.
[1:07:20] let's go to verse 2 3 i mean beloved
[1:07:24] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[1:07:25] you of the common salvation
[1:07:27] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:07:29] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:07:31] contend for the faith
[1:07:32] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:07:35] for there
[1:07:36] there are certain men prepped and
[1:07:37] unawares who before of old were ordained
[1:07:40] unto this condemnation ungodly men now
[1:07:43] notice
[1:07:45] turning in that right turning the grace
[1:07:48] of god into lasciviousness
[1:07:52] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:07:54] lord jesus christ i will therefore put
[1:07:56] you in remembrance
[1:07:58] though you once knew this how that the
[1:08:00] lord having saved the people of out of
[1:08:03] the land of egypt
[1:08:04] afterwards destroyed them that believe
[1:08:07] not
[1:08:09] in other words that ones that were moved
[1:08:13] i want you to understand something that
[1:08:15] it is the soul ambition of the devil
[1:08:19] that if you have got the holy ghost and
[1:08:21] you have god you're founded upon the
[1:08:23] rock the devil will do anything just to
[1:08:26] move you
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:33] just to get out of that position of
[1:08:35] being in christ he wants
[1:08:38] talk his head off just to get you to
[1:08:40] sway you a little bit
[1:08:43] just to move you a little
[1:08:47] because i was thinking about this now
[1:08:48] think about brother branham how did he
[1:08:51] used to have some kind of toboggan slide
[1:08:52] and they used to be ray up i guess
[1:08:55] and it would be a slide and they would
[1:08:56] play because they'd love to slide down
[1:08:58] but they play over around the edge of
[1:09:00] that slide
[1:09:01] and all of a sudden guess what they got
[1:09:03] too close and down you went he says that
[1:09:06] what america has done they got too close
[1:09:08] to sin and now look at where we're at
[1:09:11] i had to think of where america would be
[1:09:14] at when we serve god and when we believe
[1:09:16] god when we trusted god if we didn't
[1:09:18] just stood still
[1:09:20] huh
[1:09:23] but people are never happy
[1:09:26] even when they claim to be christians
[1:09:28] they're just not happy it's just not
[1:09:29] enough
[1:09:31] they want something
[1:09:32] different huh
[1:09:35] that's where you get in trouble
[1:09:38] just not content
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:42] israel never was
[1:09:44] or they
[1:09:46] rather than just being content
[1:09:48] to be hungry
[1:09:50] huh
[1:09:51] i mean as god let him get hungry
[1:09:56] godliness with contentment
[1:09:58] is great gain paul said
[1:10:00] i know how to have i know how to not
[1:10:03] have i know to be hungry how to be full
[1:10:06] but there's one thing i've learned that
[1:10:07] i can do all things through christ which
[1:10:08] strengtheneth me
[1:10:10] no matter what condition he was in he
[1:10:12] was always thankful
[1:10:14] amen he was content
[1:10:18] so israel here is saying
[1:10:20] afterwards they were destroyed because
[1:10:22] they believe not
[1:10:23] and then we go way back
[1:10:25] to before the foundation of the world
[1:10:28] we go plumb up into heaven and the
[1:10:30] angels
[1:10:32] which kept not their first estate
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:37] how many believes it's important to know
[1:10:40] where god wants you
[1:10:42] oh it's vital that god you know where
[1:10:44] god wants you
[1:10:46] when god blesses you where you're at
[1:10:48] huh
[1:10:51] when god is blessing a church when god
[1:10:53] is blessing you as an individual and
[1:10:55] that's where you ought to be it the
[1:10:56] devil will do his absolute most to get
[1:10:58] you out of that blessing because you
[1:11:00] step out of that where god wants you and
[1:11:02] guess what's happening
[1:11:05] god can't bless you
[1:11:07] can't do it
[1:11:08] you can't be in the permissive will god
[1:11:10] and be blessed no
[1:11:12] you talk about a whooping you talk about
[1:11:14] hard times when you get out of the will
[1:11:16] of god
[1:11:17] and the devil the devil's ambition in
[1:11:19] heaven was to
[1:11:22] move these angels out of the place that
[1:11:24] they were huh
[1:11:28] out of the place that god wanted them
[1:11:31] and he is shrewd
[1:11:33] he is smart he will make it look like
[1:11:35] it's a light when it's actually death
[1:11:38] he comes as an angel of light
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:42] just to get you to move out of that
[1:11:44] place and when you move out a little bit
[1:11:45] but it won't be long poof
[1:11:48] down you go
[1:11:49] huh
[1:11:51] when i thought about that look
[1:11:53] they didn't stay with god did they the
[1:11:55] devil
[1:11:56] amen he talks about his cunning crafting
[1:11:58] us over there in ephesians he's so smart
[1:12:02] that he received those angels
[1:12:06] he they complained against god
[1:12:10] the devil complained against god
[1:12:13] whatever his name was at the time i'm
[1:12:14] not even sure
[1:12:18] but it wasn't the devil or lucifer i
[1:12:20] don't think huh
[1:12:23] but anyway whatever his name was he
[1:12:26] persuaded him that
[1:12:27] you know god there's a little bit
[1:12:29] something wrong with him
[1:12:32] he gets all the glory
[1:12:34] we don't get any glory
[1:12:39] the devil ain't smart how many knows
[1:12:41] that was date he jumped right on date
[1:12:42] and corey you know moses you get too
[1:12:44] much glory
[1:12:45] we don't get enough glory
[1:12:51] that's the devil
[1:12:54] glory
[1:12:55] lord let me become the doormat so people
[1:12:57] can wipe their
[1:12:58] feet on me
[1:13:00] huh yeah
[1:13:02] that's right
[1:13:05] but think about it just to get him to

[1:14:01] your prayer life slip forget

[1:15:03] can't even stand anymore
[1:15:05] you don't know how to stand but just
[1:15:06] stay with the lord

[1:15:15] hell
[1:15:16] to move you

[1:16:04] is like a wave of the sea driven with
[1:16:07] the wind and tossed

[1:32:36] i want to build my house upon a rock i
[1:32:40] want to do what that bible says
[1:32:45] folks i had somebody text me yesterday
[1:32:47] and apologizing for something i ain't
[1:32:49] going to say oop but you know what i
[1:32:51] admired that
[1:32:54] seemed like a little thing but when a
[1:32:55] little thing bothers you it tells me a
[1:32:57] lot about you
[1:33:02] oh my why because every one of us will
[1:33:05] not do what the word of god says if you
[1:33:08] have it right down here
[1:33:10] we want to be right
[1:33:12] amen you love him
[1:33:16] oh
[1:33:18] that's right
[1:33:20] worry about things the christian rests
[1:33:22] it's all over it's all finished for the
[1:33:25] believer at calvary
[1:33:27] don't you just love it how people will
[1:33:29] come to you
[1:33:30] and when you're a christian you say well
[1:33:32] now what about where the bible says this
[1:33:34] and it says that over there and it
[1:33:36] looked like it contradicted itself
[1:33:38] or well
[1:33:40] like paul said they minister questions
[1:33:45] huh what is that most of the time that's
[1:33:47] the devil
[1:33:48] he's trying to sneak in
[1:33:50] try to get you to doubt a little bit
[1:33:53] make you wonder a little bit
[1:33:55] huh
[1:33:58] just stay out
[1:34:00] i'm already sold i'm resting
[1:34:03] please i'm resting
[1:34:05] oh he came to a lot of preachers
[1:34:07] preachers we know that we could mention
[1:34:09] they don't even believe the prophet
[1:34:10] anymore
[1:34:12] they'll say all kinds of blasphemia
[1:34:14] things against him
[1:34:18] folks it's a blasphemy to me if i
[1:34:20] haven't been a preacher for 20 years and
[1:34:21] then to say he wasn't the prophet
[1:34:24] or he was a false prophet oh oh hell's
[1:34:27] going to be hot for you sir it's going
[1:34:29] to be hot
[1:34:32] yes sir it will
[1:34:34] because there's no question
[1:34:37] huh
[1:34:38] it'd be different if the prophet was
[1:34:40] standing here
[1:34:42] how many knows he would tell you exactly
[1:34:44] what you're thinking now don't think
[1:34:46] that
[1:34:49] huh
[1:34:50] i can stand here as a preacher saying
[1:34:51] hey you shouldn't have thought that
[1:34:54] because he had told you you ought to
[1:34:55] thought that that was the devil putting
[1:34:57] doubt in your mind
[1:34:59] and because your dad was a preacher you
[1:35:02] became a preacher
[1:35:03] huh
[1:35:05] oh boy i don't know if i'm prophesying
[1:35:07] here or what but
[1:35:08] that's how it was
[1:35:12] and there was something that was not a
[1:35:13] real experience
[1:35:15] he's just following his dad
[1:35:17] he thought his dad was right my dad is
[1:35:19] right my dad just find that your dad is
[1:35:20] right but you better have the revelation
[1:35:23] yourself
[1:35:24] because if you don't you'll eventually
[1:35:26] fall away
[1:35:29] yeah the devil will be able to persuade
[1:35:31] you out just like your dad could
[1:35:32] persuade you in
[1:35:34] huh
[1:35:38] amen how many believes it
[1:35:39] [Applause]
[1:35:40] you're just convinced in your mind and
[1:35:42] not in your heart somebody else is going
[1:35:44] to unconvince you in your mind
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:49] all right let's go on
[1:35:51] i liked it
[1:35:53] it's all finished at calvary for the
[1:35:54] believer oh that's right sickness may
[1:35:57] come disappointments
[1:36:00] but the christian is at rest knowing
[1:36:02] this that god is able to keep that which
[1:36:04] he has promised and performed and
[1:36:06] started isn't that right
[1:36:09] right
[1:36:10] knowing that no matter what the thing is
[1:36:12] or how it looks
[1:36:14] there's neither sickness nor death nor
[1:36:16] sorrow starvation or anything that can
[1:36:18] separate us from the love of god
[1:36:20] that is in christ jesus
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:26] all right
[1:36:35] psalms
[1:36:36] 46
[1:36:41] psalms 46
[1:36:43] intensives
[1:36:46] be still
[1:36:48] be still
[1:36:51] and know
[1:36:53] that i am
[1:36:54] god
[1:36:57] i believe the prophet of god says you
[1:36:58] know the pentecost in the church world
[1:36:59] he says man if if people would just hold
[1:37:02] still
[1:37:03] long enough
[1:37:04] god could work on them
[1:37:08] people just can't sit still
[1:37:10] they're always looking for new things
[1:37:12] something different
[1:37:14] how many knows oh right there i believe
[1:37:17] it at the red sea god moses said just
[1:37:19] stand still
[1:37:21] just hold still
[1:37:24] when you come to places you can't cross
[1:37:26] can't get through
[1:37:29] don't get all upset
[1:37:31] hold still
[1:37:34] folks i believe it's time people hold
[1:37:36] still
[1:37:37] be still
[1:37:39] those angels in heaven should have just
[1:37:41] kept still
[1:37:43] just stay in your place
[1:37:46] say where god wants you
[1:37:52] can i
[1:37:54] tingle your mind a little bit
[1:37:57] how many believe that perhaps
[1:37:59] when we get over to heaven
[1:38:01] brother jeff we'll meet
[1:38:03] the two-thirds of angels that
[1:38:05] stood still
[1:38:07] you'll be able to say to those angels
[1:38:09] was you tempted
[1:38:10] you'll probably say yeah
[1:38:12] yeah we heard that we heard that going
[1:38:14] around our church
[1:38:16] yeah he was going everywhere man he was
[1:38:18] flossing and he prospered
[1:38:20] but we said whoa
[1:38:22] i'm just going to stay right where i am
[1:38:25] huh
[1:38:27] the two-thirds i'll have that testimony
[1:38:28] they were no doubt tempted never tried
[1:38:30] to get on
[1:38:32] huh
[1:38:33] but they just held still
[1:38:36] hostage johnny's
[1:38:38] just hold still
[1:38:40] and see the salvation of the
[1:38:42] lord amen
[1:38:45] see his salvation
[1:38:46] i want to talk to those angels
[1:38:51] stand still if israel would have just
[1:38:53] stood still when they got hungry
[1:38:57] when they hurt the chariots coming
[1:39:00] amen i believe we need to stand still
[1:39:03] if there's ever time to hold still
[1:39:06] be rock solid
[1:39:11] folks let me tell you something
[1:39:15] that's why a pastor
[1:39:18] you know one thing i didn't say about
[1:39:19] the sheep
[1:39:21] but prophet god talked about the sheep
[1:39:23] had it every night every sheep gets
[1:39:26] counted
[1:39:28] every sheep gets counted every night to
[1:39:30] make sure they're all there
[1:39:32] and as a shepherd i can tell you this
[1:39:34] that when people are missing on
[1:39:35] wednesday night or especially sunday
[1:39:37] morning huh
[1:39:38] people are missing
[1:39:40] like hey where are you
[1:39:42] are you sick are you okay
[1:39:45] that's why i appreciate when people let
[1:39:47] me know hey we're going out of town
[1:39:48] we're going on vacation
[1:39:49] so i know where
[1:39:51] you're at
[1:39:52] that the devil hasn't put something in
[1:39:54] your mind
[1:39:56] that you maybe need help with
[1:39:58] because he's good at that
[1:39:59] a pastor cares about his sheep
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:04] and so don't
[1:40:06] think nothing of it if i check on you if
[1:40:08] you're missing
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:15] it's just caring
[1:40:18] stand
[1:40:20] still right i believe we need to stand
[1:40:24] still
[1:40:28] peter and not peter but paul said to the
[1:40:31] ephesians
[1:40:33] he said we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:40:35] blood but against principalities against
[1:40:37] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:40:39] this world against spiritual weakness in
[1:40:41] high places whoever take unto you the
[1:40:44] whole armor of god that you may be able
[1:40:47] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:40:50] done all to stand stand
[1:40:57] come on somebody say stand
[1:41:00] stand
[1:41:01] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:41:07] stay where god put you
[1:41:10] amen wherever that is
[1:41:13] wherever it is that god puts you
[1:41:15] stand there
[1:41:17] amen
[1:41:20] why
[1:41:23] i'm you know in christ is the best place
[1:41:25] to stand
[1:41:26] if you're in christ
[1:41:29] grounded in christ that's the best place
[1:41:31] to be
[1:41:33] the peace that passes understanding
[1:41:35] that's good enough for me
[1:41:38] amen the joy that's unspeakable and full
[1:41:41] of glory
[1:41:43] amen why would you want to leave that
[1:41:46] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:41:49] don't be tossed about
[1:41:52] with every emotion
[1:41:55] how many fights emotions
[1:41:57] how many thoughts
[1:41:58] moves
[1:42:00] we are booty
[1:42:02] huh
[1:42:04] we can be moody
[1:42:06] how many knows it takes prayer to
[1:42:07] overcome those moods
[1:42:10] that's right
[1:42:13] the closer you are
[1:42:14] to christ
[1:42:16] the less moody you'll be your emotions
[1:42:19] and feelings will be in check why
[1:42:21] because you're gripped and solid that's
[1:42:23] all
[1:42:26] talk about being so close to god
[1:42:29] talk about being close to god close to
[1:42:31] that rock
[1:42:32] having that rock in your life so much
[1:42:34] until you become like that wrong
[1:42:37] i think david was an example joshua was
[1:42:40] an example caleb was an example but in
[1:42:42] our modern age i like this guy
[1:42:45] his name was
[1:42:47] stonewall
[1:42:48] jackson
[1:42:51] and he'd get in a battle and the bullets
[1:42:53] would fly through his coats and
[1:42:55] everything else
[1:42:56] arrows fly through his coats and barely
[1:42:59] miss him and he's standing right there
[1:43:00] in the middle of his man
[1:43:02] come on man fire that musket come on
[1:43:05] fire let's go come on
[1:43:07] huh
[1:43:08] he wasn't back in the back building with
[1:43:10] his head down say y'all go fight him
[1:43:13] no he was a brave man
[1:43:16] and that right
[1:43:19] and they said man what what is this
[1:43:21] little guy this little guy
[1:43:23] what is what is with him how can he do
[1:43:26] that
[1:43:27] they came up to him and formerly ask him
[1:43:30] mr jackson
[1:43:32] how do you do it
[1:43:35] how do you just stand there like a stone
[1:43:37] wall
[1:43:42] kick the dirt
[1:43:43] he says well
[1:43:45] i don't take a drink of water
[1:43:48] but when i thank my lord for
[1:43:52] how many knows he was close to the rock
[1:43:54] and it made him like a rock
[1:43:58] folks
[1:43:59] the water don't tell me too much other
[1:44:01] than what it tells me is that
[1:44:04] it's not so much about the water it was
[1:44:05] about his relationship with the rock
[1:44:08] it meant that he had a close
[1:44:10] relationship
[1:44:12] with the rock
[1:44:15] i take that as an example i when i eat
[1:44:17] my food thank you lord for this food
[1:44:19] when i put these clothes on thank you
[1:44:21] for these clothes when i eat whatever it
[1:44:23] is i thank you lord for this because i
[1:44:25] know it comes from your hand
[1:44:27] how many knows when you thank god for
[1:44:29] everything he appreciates that
[1:44:31] because i don't know anybody who doesn't
[1:44:32] doesn't uh appreciate when they are
[1:44:35] appreciated how many knows we all need
[1:44:36] to be appreciated we all want to be
[1:44:38] appreciated
[1:44:39] we should thank him in all things give
[1:44:42] thanks
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:47] praise the lord he was like a stone
[1:44:50] wall
[1:44:52] having done all the sand
[1:44:54] stand therefore now i want to say this
[1:44:56] in a world that's swiftly changing
[1:44:59] church people every one of you
[1:45:01] stand
[1:45:02] strong
[1:45:04] be careful
[1:45:05] why because the devil is a roaring lion
[1:45:07] he is shrewd as can be
[1:45:11] to deceive
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:17] and here is another really good one i
[1:45:19] don't know if i have much after this
[1:45:20] maybe one or two
[1:45:28] but let's go to psalms
[1:45:32] i like david's psalms
[1:45:37] psalms 1.
[1:45:41] i like it blessed is the man that
[1:45:43] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:45:46] ungodly nor standeth
[1:45:48] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:45:50] seat of the scornful
[1:45:53] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:45:55] lord and in his law does he meditate day
[1:46:00] and night
[1:46:03] you know i'm still working on that
[1:46:07] i've gotten to where i'll get up on my
[1:46:09] roof i'll get out there on my walls that
[1:46:10] i'm building or whatever work i'm doing
[1:46:12] now i'll take me a tablet only used to
[1:46:14] not do that
[1:46:16] but i'll take me to keep me a tablet
[1:46:18] long keep my mind on him through it all
[1:46:20] then we got quicken something i'll write
[1:46:23] it down
[1:46:24] huh
[1:46:26] day and night keep your mind on him
[1:46:29] why because how many of us knows that's
[1:46:31] not too easy to do
[1:46:32] because we are
[1:46:34] so
[1:46:35] busy
[1:46:39] but how many knows every time in the old
[1:46:40] testament talk about tied upon your best
[1:46:42] boat met it upon it in the night watches
[1:46:44] and everything else if you want to be a
[1:46:46] stronger christian have him on your mind
[1:46:49] a greater portion of your time
[1:46:52] all if you can
[1:46:55] it's the light is in the law of the lord
[1:46:57] and in his law does he meditate and he
[1:46:59] shall be
[1:47:00] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:47:04] water
[1:47:07] that bringeth forth his fruit and his
[1:47:09] season and his leaf also shall not
[1:47:12] wither and whatsoever he doeth
[1:47:15] shall
[1:47:16] prosper
[1:47:18] amen
[1:47:20] i mean he believes that's what we want
[1:47:21] to be like a tree that's planned by the
[1:47:24] word how many knows planet in that word
[1:47:28] and it doesn't matter how many storms
[1:47:30] come or what comes you'll be able to
[1:47:34] withstand
[1:47:35] those storms and that wind
[1:47:38] those temptations
[1:47:40] of the flesh
[1:47:42] amen
[1:47:44] just like stonewall jackson was he was
[1:47:47] like a tree that was planted there
[1:47:54] oh my
[1:47:56] that believes
[1:47:57] that that bullet can't hit him
[1:48:00] until it's god's time for that bullet to
[1:48:02] hit him
[1:48:03] that right he trusted in god
[1:48:06] remember this there's angels
[1:48:08] the angels of the lord are encamped
[1:48:10] around about those that fear him
[1:48:13] you talk about a shield huh
[1:48:16] maybe we'll talk about a shield sometime
[1:48:17] but the shield of god
[1:48:20] because he is our shield
[1:48:21] and our buckler
[1:48:23] but it protects you
[1:48:25] amen
[1:48:29] just like a tree that's planted by the
[1:48:32] water
[1:48:34] i shall not be moved
[1:48:38] how many wants to be that away
[1:48:41] amen
[1:48:43] amen
[1:48:44] let me recap the answer recap your
[1:48:46] answer for why we are
[1:48:49] so tossed about so many times while we
[1:48:51] have
[1:48:52] personality changes mood changes
[1:48:56] huh
[1:48:57] and so forth it's because we aren't
[1:49:00] grounded upon the rock
[1:49:02] the way that we should be
[1:49:05] why when winds come when this comes
[1:49:07] along everything it changes us
[1:49:10] this comes along it changes us
[1:49:12] how many knows we don't need to be that
[1:49:14] way
[1:49:15] no matter what comes it shouldn't change
[1:49:18] you
[1:49:19] amen sure we i know we all have our ups
[1:49:22] tonight we all have these here but let
[1:49:24] me tell you it balances it out right it
[1:49:26] brings you back into direct
[1:49:29] perspective
[1:49:30] when you go to your knees
[1:49:32] and you talk to the lord about it
[1:49:35] and it brings into the right atmosphere
[1:49:37] amen
[1:49:40] you love the lord this morning
[1:49:43] so let me tell you church
[1:49:46] let's make sure
[1:49:47] that you have
[1:49:49] built
[1:49:50] your house
[1:49:51] upon the rock
[1:49:53] not because brother byler said brother
[1:49:55] bother preached it no but because you
[1:49:57] know it personally that's why we get
[1:49:59] amens that's why we have that's right
[1:50:01] why because we have responding you're
[1:50:04] responding to what you know
[1:50:08] to what you have experienced
[1:50:10] because if it isn't that it's still just
[1:50:12] hearing my words
[1:50:14] it's still just
[1:50:15] here in the bible it's still wearing
[1:50:17] what your mom daddy said it's all good
[1:50:19] but it has to come much deeper than that
[1:50:21] if it's ever going to stand against the
[1:50:24] devil and all of hell and prevail
[1:50:26] against the gates of hell if it'll ever
[1:50:28] prevail against that it has to be
[1:50:30] personal with between you and jesus
[1:50:33] christ
[1:50:35] amen
[1:50:37] your walk with the lord
[1:50:38] and then in closing
[1:50:41] it'll be
[1:50:43] like paul said
[1:50:46] romans 8 and verse
[1:50:48] 30
[1:50:50] 5.
[1:50:53] he says who shall separate us from the
[1:50:55] love of christ
[1:50:56] shall tribulation
[1:50:58] or distress
[1:51:00] or persecution
[1:51:01] or famine
[1:51:03] or nakedness look these are all terrible
[1:51:05] things that paul's mentioning i mean
[1:51:07] he's not mentioned all the highlights
[1:51:09] the peace and the valley and all that no
[1:51:11] he's saying all these things that you
[1:51:13] come against that's going to come
[1:51:14] against you
[1:51:16] huh
[1:51:19] if you've lived very long be a christian
[1:51:21] you'll know that if you're on the right
[1:51:22] path
[1:51:24] it isn't long or tries to get you off
[1:51:27] one way or the other and if you're a
[1:51:29] wise christian you'll know exactly what
[1:51:31] that is when it happens
[1:51:35] come he knows because if you aren't wise
[1:51:37] if you haven't learned it
[1:51:39] you'll learn the hard way
[1:51:41] because you'll get caught up in it
[1:51:43] and then you'll find out hey you know
[1:51:45] should have never got caught up in that
[1:51:47] devil's lie that he talked to me in my
[1:51:48] mind
[1:51:49] huh
[1:51:50] what shall separate nakedness apparel or
[1:51:52] sword as it is written for we are killed
[1:51:55] all day long for thy sake we are counted
[1:51:57] as sheep for the slaughter but nay in
[1:51:59] all these things we are more than
[1:52:01] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:52:04] i am persuaded
[1:52:06] i mean note paul
[1:52:08] knew what it was like to be found to
[1:52:10] fall on the rock
[1:52:11] this is the man who was absolutely
[1:52:14] founded upon the rock he had no
[1:52:16] worldly treasures whatsoever
[1:52:20] flat broke a bum
[1:52:23] had to hey god had to supply him with
[1:52:25] whatever he had had asked him to bring
[1:52:27] my coat along it's cold i need my coat
[1:52:29] can i just have my coat
[1:52:32] huh
[1:52:33] sometimes he'd have plenty sometimes
[1:52:34] they've got absolutely nothing it was
[1:52:36] basically he lived on the lord
[1:52:38] huh
[1:52:39] and he was persuaded that not death
[1:52:42] i'm it's not even death
[1:52:45] oh my
[1:52:47] how many believe i don't know about you
[1:52:49] but as i got older
[1:52:52] aches and pains
[1:52:56] come on folks when you get older you
[1:52:57] better just start to learn the laugh and
[1:52:59] aches and pains because they're there
[1:53:04] you know i know brother brian's getting
[1:53:05] a little older and i know he's got aches
[1:53:07] and pains
[1:53:08] but i never hear him talking about it i
[1:53:11] never hear him complaining about it
[1:53:13] huh
[1:53:15] i guarantee you i could probably listen
[1:53:17] some stories but he's the kind of man
[1:53:19] right
[1:53:19] hey he's just going to go through it
[1:53:21] i like that i mean it was because we
[1:53:23] don't want to be complainers
[1:53:25] that's right we're just gonna don't be a
[1:53:26] complainer about every aid campaign i've
[1:53:28] talked to people that were like that and
[1:53:30] it's depressing
[1:53:33] you know to pray oh i tell you what i
[1:53:35] just can't get around and oh i tell you
[1:53:38] what my knee hurts no i'm telling you
[1:53:40] what my foot hurts and i could do that
[1:53:42] folks i've got this that in the other
[1:53:43] but
[1:53:45] shrug it off and say hey at least works
[1:53:47] fifty percent now i'm thankful for the
[1:53:49] fifty percent
[1:53:54] all right
[1:53:54] i hope that helps somebody that's
[1:53:57] getting older but
[1:53:59] not even death paul said even though you
[1:54:01] come up to that door of death don't let
[1:54:03] it shake you
[1:54:06] don't let it separate you from the love
[1:54:07] of god don't let it stir you up don't
