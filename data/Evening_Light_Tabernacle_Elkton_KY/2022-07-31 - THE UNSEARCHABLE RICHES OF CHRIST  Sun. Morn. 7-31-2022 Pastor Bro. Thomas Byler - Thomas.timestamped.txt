[25:47] good morning brothers and sisters
[25:49] we just all stand this morning
[25:54] maybe brother uh john hershberger will
[25:56] open us in prayer this morning
[26:39] and
[26:40] uh the children can be dismissed for
[26:41] sunday school and if we'll go in the
[26:43] psalms here
[26:45] to psalms
[26:46] 124 just the little psalms
[27:02] psalms 124
[27:06] if it had not been
[27:07] the lord who was on our side
[27:10] now may israel say
[27:20] and they had swallowed us up quick
[27:23] when their wrath was kindled against us
[27:32] then the proud waters had gone over our
[27:34] soul
[27:40] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[27:43] snare
[27:44] of the fowlers the snare is broken and
[27:47] we are escaped
[27:49] our help is in the name of the lord who
[27:51] made heaven and earth
[27:54] god bless you may be seated brother
[27:55] brian
[28:09] morning brothers and sisters
[28:13] it was a long day on the concrete
[28:14] yesterday if you turned me
[28:17] to jonah in the fourth chapter i was as
[28:20] we were reading that psalm and
[28:22] i was
[28:23] thinking over there thought came to my
[28:25] mind you know as a christian
[28:30] any situations
[28:32] going to make you react a certain way
[28:34] and how you react
[28:36] lets you know really what you are on the
[28:38] inside you know you can't hide from
[28:40] yourself
[28:42] when things go bad or or whatever the
[28:45] situation's affecting you
[28:48] your first reaction
[28:50] is you can't hide that that's exactly
[28:53] who you are and what you are that first
[28:55] reaction whether it's the line whether
[28:58] it's to steal something whether it's to
[29:00] walk away when you know you should help
[29:02] somebody that first reaction is who you
[29:04] really are
[29:06] and i was just thinking as christians
[29:08] this morning
[29:09] what's our first reaction to anything
[29:11] that happens to us this morning you know
[29:14] i was thinking if the world hates you as
[29:16] a christian what would your reaction be
[29:19] of course your mind will tell you that
[29:21] you need to love them more whoever that
[29:23] person is that's
[29:24] afflicting you or pressing you your
[29:27] reaction should not to be to become like
[29:30] him but to actually forgive him and love
[29:33] him and just care about him more or
[29:35] whatever this it should be the opposite
[29:37] of what the world would do to you this
[29:39] morning whatever that reaction you're
[29:41] gonna have and you know i'm not afraid
[29:45] you know i made a mistake yesterday
[29:46] myself i i got locked in a mechanical
[29:49] room yesterday and i'm trying to get out
[29:52] of it and no one's paying me any
[29:54] attention you know what just like i said
[29:56] you can lose total control you know and
[29:59] that nature comes out and my half mine
[30:01] just happens to be a bear or a dragon
[30:04] sometimes and i wasn't a very pleasant
[30:06] person after waiting a half hour for
[30:09] someone to unlock me out of that
[30:11] mechanical room so we had to tell on
[30:13] ourselves sometimes i wasn't the best
[30:15] person when i found out i was locked in
[30:18] but
[30:19] i was just thinking of jonah this
[30:21] morning
[30:22] and uh
[30:24] you know jonah is had a reaction too you
[30:27] know
[30:29] jonah was told to go to nineveh one of
[30:31] the worst cities in the world at that
[30:33] time a perverted city a polluted city
[30:36] not in a natural sense but in a in a
[30:39] spiritual sense and he was in israel and
[30:42] he was told to go
[30:43] and prophesy against him and then this
[30:45] is the last chapter and i was thinking
[30:48] as i was saying as you react to any
[30:50] given situation
[30:52] it's really who you are let me just read
[30:54] this chapter here you know and i didn't
[30:56] have anything to think i was just
[30:58] sitting there this morning kind of blank
[31:00] and then somehow my bible would
[31:03] there's nothing behind it but somehow my
[31:04] bible was open to this chapter
[31:07] and i'll just read it this morning and
[31:09] then i'm going to jump to another
[31:10] chapter in in the gospels but
[31:13] this is uh jonah the fourth chapter it
[31:16] says
[31:17] but it displeased jonah exceedingly that
[31:19] he was very angry and all you know why
[31:22] jonah was angry and if you don't know
[31:24] maybe you need to go and read these four
[31:27] chapters this week and he prayed unto
[31:29] the lord that i pray thee o lord was not
[31:31] this my saying when i was yet in my
[31:34] country therefore i fled before unto
[31:37] tarshish
[31:38] for i knew that thou art gracious god a
[31:40] merciful
[31:42] slow to anger and of great kindness
[31:45] and repentancy of evil so what jonah's
[31:48] thought was for the people of nineveh
[31:50] and what gods thought were totally
[31:52] opposite and goes back to what i was
[31:54] saying earlier that first reaction god's
[31:57] reaction was to love people and
[32:00] desire to see them accept forgiveness
[32:04] not to say that if they had not
[32:07] asked for forgiveness he still would
[32:09] have destroyed the city don't get me
[32:10] wrong they would have had to pay for a
[32:13] final judgment for their of not
[32:15] accepting the message but then i'll go
[32:18] on and read
[32:20] and he
[32:21] and i lost my place here therefore now
[32:24] oh lord take i beseech thee my life from
[32:27] me for it it's better for me to die than
[32:29] to live so he's pretty angry
[32:31] you know as a person he's seen god give
[32:33] mercy to someone and treat someone
[32:36] kindly that he thought that god should
[32:39] have destroyed and god should have
[32:40] killed and he's angry about it before
[32:43] the lord and you know sometimes we can
[32:44] be that way also
[32:46] therefore now oh lord take i beseech
[32:48] thee my life for me for it is better for
[32:50] me to die than to live
[32:53] and then said the lord does thou well to
[32:55] be angry so god is
[32:58] trying him taunting him and then jonah
[33:00] went out of the city and sat on the east
[33:02] side of the city
[33:03] there made him a booth and sat under it
[33:05] in the shadow
[33:07] so he might see what would become of the
[33:09] city he already knew what was going to
[33:11] happen because
[33:13] they repented god was not going to
[33:15] destroy the city but he still had some
[33:17] hope there that god might change his
[33:18] mind
[33:20] and the lord god prepared a gourd and
[33:22] made it to come up over jonah
[33:24] that it might be a shadow over his head
[33:26] to deliver him from his grief
[33:28] so jonah was exceedingly glad of the
[33:30] gourd
[33:31] but god prepared a worm when the morning
[33:34] rose the next day and smoked the gourd
[33:36] that it withered and it came to pass
[33:38] when the sun did arise that god prepared
[33:40] a venomous east wind
[33:42] and the sun beat upon
[33:45] beat up beat upon the head of jonah and
[33:47] he fainted and wished himself to die i
[33:49] said it's better for me to die than to
[33:51] live
[33:52] and god said to jonah dust thou well to
[33:55] be angry for the lord said i do well to
[33:58] be angry even unto death
[34:00] then said the lord thou hast had pity on
[34:02] the gourd
[34:03] for thou which has not labored neither
[34:05] made it grow
[34:07] which made
[34:08] excuse me which made it to come up in
[34:10] the night in paris in the night
[34:12] should i have not spared
[34:14] nineveh the great city where more than
[34:17] six score thousand persons that cannot
[34:20] discern
[34:22] between the right hand and the left hand
[34:24] and also much cattle scott's telling
[34:26] noah that these people didn't know any
[34:28] better they couldn't tell the difference
[34:30] between wrong and right and sometimes
[34:33] when we mingle out there with the people
[34:35] of this world you know sometimes we can
[34:37] get short with them but a lot of times
[34:38] the people that we deal with every day
[34:40] they haven't been taught they don't know
[34:42] no better they don't know their right
[34:44] hand from the left hand and our attitude
[34:46] and how we interact with them is a
[34:48] testimony to who jesus christ is because
[34:50] the only god or the only christ they're
[34:52] ever going to see is the one that's in
[34:54] your heart and in your life and how you
[34:56] deal with them as an individual will
[34:58] reflect on what jesus christ is to him
[35:01] and uh
[35:02] and i would like i said i'm not afraid
[35:04] to say that i wasn't a very good example
[35:06] yesterday
[35:07] uh
[35:08] if you return with me to matthew the
[35:10] 15th chapter
[35:14] you know some you know you can't
[35:16] whatever you're feeling
[35:17] you know whether
[35:19] i can only speak whether you're in great
[35:21] pain
[35:22] great distress
[35:24] doesn't give you the right to treat
[35:25] other people that way
[35:27] you know you you have to realize no
[35:30] matter what you're feeling and going
[35:32] through doesn't give you a right to
[35:33] treat other people bad and i was this is
[35:36] uh the 15th chapter of matthew
[35:39] you know i guess i'm talking to myself
[35:41] this morning and um i don't want to read
[35:44] this whole chapter i say that and i
[35:46] would go ahead and read all 39 verses
[35:49] but i'm not going to do that
[35:51] but uh
[35:53] this is i'll read then jesus
[35:56] scribes and services were jesus saying
[35:58] why did i
[35:59] you know he's talking about i think
[36:02] about the commandments of you know how
[36:04] to wash hearts and all this other stuff
[36:06] all these pharisees could see
[36:09] is what christ and what the disciples
[36:11] and their mind was doing wrong again
[36:14] not they thought their right hand and
[36:16] left hand were doing the right thing but
[36:18] actually it wasn't and then jesus talks
[36:21] to him again and he answered them and
[36:22] said unto them
[36:24] why do you also transgress the
[36:26] commandments of god by your trait he
[36:28] looks them right in the face and he
[36:30] tells them why are you transgressing
[36:33] the commandments with their trans
[36:36] traditions and god commands saying honor
[36:39] thy father and mother and he curses his
[36:41] father and mother let him die of the
[36:43] death
[36:43] but you say whosoever shall say to his
[36:46] father or his mother it is a gift
[36:48] whatsoever thou mightest prophet of me
[36:50] and and he keeps on talking
[36:53] about and then i want to jump down to
[36:54] this
[36:56] about the 16th jesus
[36:58] he's talking to his own disciples and he
[37:01] says
[37:02] about the thing he answered and said
[37:03] every plant which my heavenly father
[37:05] hath not planted shall be rooted uh let
[37:08] them alone
[37:09] they be blind leaders of the blind if
[37:10] the blind lead the blind they both
[37:12] should fall into the ditch and sometimes
[37:14] you have to treat their people they're
[37:16] fighting you a lot that's mean you don't
[37:18] love them or care for them but if
[37:20] they're just wanting to be contentious
[37:22] with you all the time sometimes it's not
[37:25] good to argue with him you just got to
[37:27] learn to live
[37:28] leave him alone sometimes
[37:30] then answered peter and said unto him
[37:32] declare unto us this parable
[37:35] and jesus said are you not without
[37:37] understanding you know a lot of times
[37:39] we're all hard-headed like peter was
[37:41] sometimes it's sometimes we got to get
[37:43] beat down several times before we really
[37:45] understand what god's trying to tell us
[37:48] do you not understand whatsoever
[37:49] energetic the mouth goes and he's
[37:51] talking about how they were
[37:54] the things that they were doing the pots
[37:56] washing washing the hands he goes on to
[37:59] say do you not understand what's there
[38:00] enter into the mouth
[38:02] go with to the belly and it's cast out
[38:04] into the drought
[38:05] but the things which proceed out of the
[38:07] mouth come forth from the heart and they
[38:09] defile them and that's what i've been
[38:11] talking about the last few minutes
[38:13] it's that reaction how you treat people
[38:15] how you treat your family how you treat
[38:17] a stranger on the street how you treat
[38:20] them
[38:20] coming out of your heart coming out of
[38:22] life that's who you really are and like
[38:25] i said you can't hide from yourself you
[38:27] know what you are
[38:29] but these things which proceed out of
[38:30] the mouth come from the fat of the heart
[38:32] they defile the man
[38:34] for out of the heart perceive evil
[38:36] thoughts murders adulteries fornication
[38:38] thefts
[38:39] false witness and blasphemy
[38:42] these are the things which defile a man
[38:44] but to eat without washing hands and
[38:46] defiles not a man
[38:48] and i was just thinking i'll finish with
[38:50] this one thought this morning
[38:52] not wanting to let take a lot of time
[38:55] but
[38:56] you got to realize or i have to realize
[38:58] sometimes you don't know who's really
[39:01] watching you
[39:02] who's watching your life who's watching
[39:05] how you react to situations as they're
[39:07] presented to you
[39:09] that reaction that you have
[39:11] that's when someone's watching you might
[39:14] be the reaction that makes them walk
[39:16] away forever so everything we do in life
[39:19] we got to be careful what we say what we
[39:21] believe
[39:22] and how we treat people brother david
[39:34] if we could and
[39:36] just appreciate the sunday school this
[39:37] morning
[39:42] i'm just never amazed
[39:44] ever amazed at what god does i had some
[39:46] thoughts running through my mind and
[39:48] then brother brian he begins to get onto
[39:50] me for
[39:52] how i react sometimes with things and
[39:54] i said well lord you know what we have
[39:57] need of in our hearts and lives and
[39:59] amen and
[40:00] you know
[40:01] we've been told all of our life that
[40:04] we're the only jesus that some people
[40:05] ever see the only bible they'll ever
[40:07] read and
[40:09] just say lord help us to be what we need
[40:11] to be this morning is that your heart's
[40:13] desire and

[48:58] little i called him peanut don't ask me
[49:00] where i got that from that's just what i
[49:02] called him

[49:06] going to be around every sunday and
[49:08] every wednesday here in a few days but
[49:10] the westin's going to college sister
[49:12] amber's going to college and i thought

[1:13:40] there and god showed him all the saints
[1:13:42] of all uh this age it was passed on
[1:13:44] already and so forth and how they were
[1:13:46] and he says there's no words in the
[1:13:48] english vocabulary to describe how
[1:13:50] beautiful it is over there
[1:13:52] amen aren't you glad that god came in
[1:13:54] this generation and proved to show that
[1:13:56] he was alive

[1:14:00] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:03] forever he don't never change we might
[1:14:05] change but god don't never change amen

[1:15:11] bring before the church and let you all
[1:15:13] vote on whether we want to sell about
[1:15:15] five six acres of that real rocky rough
[1:15:18] field that i've mowed many times and

[1:18:38] i've had two preachers and that says no
[1:18:40] and i i still can't quite figure it out
[1:18:42] i think you know it was jonathan jones
[1:18:44] first and so one two sundays it's been a
[1:18:47] while but i'm glad to be back amen
[1:18:50] all right ephesians if you will chapter
[1:18:52] three
[1:18:57] paul says in verse chapter 3 of
[1:18:59] ephesians verse 5 which in other ages
[1:19:02] was not made known unto
[1:19:04] men but is now revealed unto his holy
[1:19:07] prophets
[1:19:08] apostles and prophets by the spirit that
[1:19:11] the gentiles should be fellow heirs amen
[1:19:14] we want to talk a little bit about being
[1:19:16] heir of god amen
[1:19:18] and of the same body and partakers of
[1:19:21] his promise in christ by the gospel
[1:19:25] whereof i was made a minister or
[1:19:27] according to the gift of grace of god
[1:19:29] given unto me by the effectual working
[1:19:32] of his power
[1:19:33] unto me who am
[1:19:35] less than this
[1:19:37] less than the
[1:19:38] least less than the least of all saints
[1:19:41] is this grace given that i should preach
[1:19:43] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[1:19:46] riches of christ and to make all men to
[1:19:49] see what is the fellowship of the
[1:19:51] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:19:52] world has been hidden god who created
[1:19:55] all things by christ jesus may god had
[1:19:57] his blessings to reading of the word you
[1:19:59] can be seated amen maybe that will have
[1:20:01] you have you standing long enough to be
[1:20:03] able to endure for a while
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:07] praise the lord
[1:20:09] hallelujah
[1:20:11] oh my you know i'm i just get to
[1:20:13] thinking and i've been speaking of
[1:20:15] course here the last i think
[1:20:17] the sermon i one of the last sermons
[1:20:19] that i was ministering on was keeping a
[1:20:22] positive attitude in the midst of so
[1:20:25] much negativity isn't that right i mean
[1:20:27] notice there's everything about this
[1:20:29] world is negative
[1:20:31] there's nothing positive about it at all
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] amen but in the midst of all of that
[1:20:37] negativity paul could always stay
[1:20:40] positive amen
[1:20:43] you know he said this way just to
[1:20:45] mention a little bit of recap he says
[1:20:47] who shall who shall separate us from the
[1:20:49] love of christ shall tribulation or
[1:20:52] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:20:55] nakedness or peril or sword
[1:21:00] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:21:02] killed all day long we are accounted as
[1:21:04] sheep for the slaughter
[1:21:08] now that that that picture right there
[1:21:10] that scripture right there would
[1:21:12] certainly look like we are it's a
[1:21:14] hopeless case that we're considered as
[1:21:16] sheep to the slaughter they kill us just
[1:21:19] however they want to so to speak because
[1:21:21] they certainly did
[1:21:23] in the dark ages they killed christians
[1:21:25] by the millions isn't that right
[1:21:27] and so forth we are kian as sheep as the
[1:21:29] slaughter and then he
[1:21:31] changes his mind and his tune kind of he
[1:21:34] says no or nay in all these things we
[1:21:38] are more than conquerors
[1:21:41] through him that loved us
[1:21:43] it's not just a sad story but we're
[1:21:45] conquerors and not just conquerors but
[1:21:47] more than conquerors through him that
[1:21:50] loved us
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] praise the lord for i am persuaded he
[1:21:56] says that not death not life nor angels
[1:21:59] nor principalities nor poor powers nor
[1:22:02] things present nor things to come not
[1:22:04] height not depth not any other creature
[1:22:06] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:22:08] love of christ which is in christ jesus
[1:22:11] our lord
[1:22:13] praise be to god i you are looking at a
[1:22:17] witness that has been serving the lord
[1:22:19] since he was 20 years old
[1:22:22] i'm 69 i'm here to testify this morning
[1:22:26] that that is true
[1:22:29] not tribulation not distress not anguish
[1:22:32] knight is not a devil out of hell that
[1:22:35] can ever separate you from the love of
[1:22:37] god once you are born again when god
[1:22:41] does it work for you and in you it is
[1:22:44] for lights
[1:22:46] it's for eternity
[1:22:49] praise be to god hallelujah
[1:22:54] so and i got to thinking and i want to
[1:22:56] just first of all talk about the reason
[1:22:58] i read that scripture about paul here
[1:23:00] because he of course paul was not a rich
[1:23:03] man
[1:23:05] was at one time but then he said i have
[1:23:07] suffered the loss of all things for the
[1:23:09] glory of christ
[1:23:11] he barely had a coat to wear and that
[1:23:13] right i know how to abound and i know
[1:23:15] how to have nothing i know how to suffer
[1:23:17] need and so forth amen and i know how to
[1:23:19] have plenty of that then he makes the
[1:23:21] statement after that says i can do all
[1:23:23] things
[1:23:24] through christ which strengtheneth me
[1:23:28] how many believes that a christian can
[1:23:30] go through good times he can go through
[1:23:32] bad times and he can go through either
[1:23:34] way it don't matter as long as he got
[1:23:36] christ in his life
[1:23:40] we're living in an age when folks we
[1:23:42] need
[1:23:43] we got on the scene more than we ever
[1:23:45] have we don't need a god of just history
[1:23:49] but we need a present i am god how many
[1:23:52] believe that the god that was with david
[1:23:54] the god that was the daniel and the the
[1:23:55] evil children the god that went through
[1:23:57] the fire in front of me that same god is
[1:24:00] here this morning
[1:24:04] i've never heard prophet say during this
[1:24:06] time that i've been a little bit sick he
[1:24:07] said something you know if you could
[1:24:09] just get it in your mind and in your
[1:24:11] heart that god is here now
[1:24:14] anything could happen
[1:24:16] you've got to believe it oh and and now
[1:24:20] god
[1:24:21] he's an on-time guard
[1:24:25] don't get me started
[1:24:29] well get me stuff
[1:24:32] praise be that god
[1:24:34] hallelujah
[1:24:40] thank you jesus
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:44] god is good
[1:24:46] we need a god that is a god of
[1:24:50] this morning
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:56] now he told moses to go down to egypt
[1:24:59] and tell fear pharaoh to let my people
[1:25:01] go and so forth that what did he say he
[1:25:02] says go and if they ask who sends you
[1:25:05] what do you say
[1:25:07] tell them i am
[1:25:11] i am there's something special about
[1:25:13] those two words to me
[1:25:15] because when i'm sick i need i am god
[1:25:19] when i'm in trouble i need i am god the
[1:25:21] god that is right there right now
[1:25:24] and to think folks that you don't have
[1:25:26] to go through this world alone
[1:25:31] you don't have to be alone
[1:25:33] nobody likes to be alone and you may
[1:25:35] feel like you're all alone but let me
[1:25:37] tell you if you've got christ you've got
[1:25:39] everybody
[1:25:40] you've got everything that you have need
[1:25:42] of if you've got christ
[1:25:47] and so again coming back to our thought
[1:25:50] it's the unsearchable riches amen
[1:25:54] because as we go through life we see and
[1:25:56] we know
[1:25:58] that as we go through life we're going
[1:26:00] to get poorer and poorer
[1:26:05] that's quiet
[1:26:07] yeah
[1:26:09] you're going to get poorer and poorer
[1:26:12] less rich and less
[1:26:15] rich
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:20] until finally it'll come down
[1:26:22] if we're still here at that time
[1:26:24] that you won't be able to buy ourselves
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:30] you won't even buy or sell these now
[1:26:32] your money isn't going to mean anything
[1:26:36] our farms and our comfort knowledge it
[1:26:39] isn't going to mean anything after a
[1:26:40] while
[1:26:42] the devil is out to amen he's out to rob
[1:26:46] and to kill and to steal and destroy
[1:26:50] amen
[1:26:51] yet paul could talk about the
[1:26:53] unsearchable riches of christ and i want
[1:26:54] to talk about that with the help of the
[1:26:56] lord
[1:26:57] but first i want to go to
[1:26:59] saint john 10
[1:27:03] and we begin with response verily verily
[1:27:05] i say unto you he that entereth not by
[1:27:07] the door into the sheepfold but climbeth
[1:27:09] up some other way
[1:27:11] the same is a
[1:27:13] thief and a robber
[1:27:15] now i'm gonna jump down i'm going to
[1:27:17] show you what a thief and a robber does
[1:27:19] verse 8 jesus says all that ever came
[1:27:22] before me are thieves and robbers
[1:27:26] now if you'll notice in verse 1 it says
[1:27:28] that people that try to get to heaven
[1:27:32] try to find joy
[1:27:34] huh
[1:27:35] try to find peace try to find christ in
[1:27:38] in some other way or their own way hello
[1:27:43] they're thieves and robbers
[1:27:45] you can't come and find those things
[1:27:46] your way
[1:27:48] you've got to come through christ
[1:27:50] there's only one way to come and that is
[1:27:51] through christ
[1:27:53] amen all they were coming were thieves
[1:27:56] and robbers but the sheep did not hear
[1:27:58] them i am the door and by me if any man
[1:28:02] enter in he shall be saved
[1:28:05] and go in and out and find
[1:28:08] pasture
[1:28:11] see i know i got a lot of believers here
[1:28:13] this morning that know what that pasture
[1:28:15] is all about i figured i have a few more
[1:28:17] amens on that pasture thing
[1:28:19] amen that you can find pasture
[1:28:22] some people only get fed when they come
[1:28:24] to church on sunday or wednesday
[1:28:26] folks that's not that's not the idea
[1:28:28] no that's not the idea the idea is to
[1:28:31] feed constantly finding
[1:28:33] pasture all the time
[1:28:40] my i don't know if i should say what
[1:28:43] comes to my mind or not should i
[1:28:45] do i have your permission

[1:28:53] huh i don't listen to tapes read my
[1:28:55] bible or go to church i'm just not
[1:28:57] hungry i don't i don't pastor
[1:29:00] it's a bad sign isn't it
[1:29:02] it's terrible but what do we come for we
[1:29:04] come into the house of god to feed on
[1:29:06] the word of god
[1:29:08] we call it a worship service
[1:29:11] hallelujah oh my yesterday i was sitting
[1:29:14] there thinking you know when we get to
[1:29:15] heaven hallelujah i believe we're going
[1:29:18] to have some more worship services don't

[1:29:30] service and praise god
[1:29:32] amen only if i'm the preacher i won't
[1:29:35] have to preach anymore to sinners
[1:29:38] i mean those gods the sinner had refused
[1:29:40] to heed the call when we get together
[1:29:43] over there it's just the worship service

[1:30:00] service going all the time over there
[1:30:04] and if you get tired of it over here i
[1:30:06] wonder if you'll even be over there
[1:30:08] because i don't want people to get tired
[1:30:10] of it
[1:30:12] huh
[1:30:14] doesn't get old over there

[1:30:20] but shining is this time we have no less
[1:30:23] days to sing god's praise than we first
[1:30:25] begun
[1:30:27] praise his lord
[1:30:30] so we see here he says the thief cometh
[1:30:32] not but for to steal and to kill and to
[1:30:36] destroy
[1:30:37] how many knows that's the world that
[1:30:39] we're living in any politicians any
[1:30:42] government that wants to try to give you
[1:30:43] this and promise you that they're not
[1:30:45] there to give you nothing they're there
[1:30:47] to kill you to kill you to steal from
[1:30:49] you and to destroy you
[1:30:53] that's all the devil is out to do is
[1:30:55] destroy he wants to destroy the families
[1:30:57] he wants to destroy our children
[1:30:59] he wants to destroy their identity
[1:31:03] he wants to get between husbands and
[1:31:05] wives and to separate him that's the
[1:31:07] devil's work destroy destroy destroy
[1:31:12] amen that's all he
[1:31:14] does destroy
[1:31:21] i shouldn't take you on my reminiscing
[1:31:24] trip
[1:31:25] but yesterday i was reminiscing i guess
[1:31:27] you call it
[1:31:28] about how that you know
[1:31:30] i was thinking is it really better to
[1:31:32] live in this age where we better be
[1:31:34] better off on the horses and the wagons
[1:31:36] head west
[1:31:37] taking our sledgehammers and driving
[1:31:38] some stakes on as much properties we
[1:31:40] want
[1:31:43] huh sure we would have died from uh this
[1:31:46] and the diet from the that because they
[1:31:47] can't take everything there a lot of
[1:31:49] people died
[1:31:50] but you know think about it we're the
[1:31:52] earlier days really better maybe than
[1:31:53] the latter days because where we're
[1:31:55] heading is a terrible place folks
[1:31:58] where we have come to in the rottenness
[1:32:01] the immorality has happened all around
[1:32:03] us it's barely a fit place to live
[1:32:05] anymore
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] why because devils always describes like
[1:32:12] the prophet said he says you know you've
[1:32:14] got to dig down to find the kingdom of
[1:32:16] the egyptians and the romans and so
[1:32:18] forth
[1:32:19] he says that's the same way with america
[1:32:21] and the world it's all going to be a
[1:32:22] thing of the past
[1:32:24] i mean i was all gonna be a thing of the
[1:32:26] past folks i when i think about the
[1:32:28] prophet of god saying you know i highly
[1:32:30] doubt that the time will last as long as
[1:32:32] my my my
[1:32:35] natural life span
[1:32:37] would last
[1:32:39] he'd be about 105.
[1:32:41] he seriously didn't think it'd go that
[1:32:42] long
[1:32:43] and here we are past that place
[1:32:46] how many knows it's time to wake up it's
[1:32:47] time to be ready folks
[1:32:49] to meet the lord
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:54] so we find out brothers and sisters that
[1:32:56] as we see our
[1:32:57] our our rights we see our privileges we
[1:33:01] see all of these different things
[1:33:03] being taken from us
[1:33:05] amen
[1:33:06] the devil robbing the devil stealing the
[1:33:09] devil destroying
[1:33:11] in the middle of all that
[1:33:13] we can still praise be to god i'm just
[1:33:15] glad for that
[1:33:16] it don't matter
[1:33:18] you know because eventually you know it
[1:33:19] doesn't matter how rich how rich you get
[1:33:23] here
[1:33:25] like i said a while ago we're going to
[1:33:27] get poorer
[1:33:28] because if time with terry
[1:33:30] what does the bible say you get to take
[1:33:32] with you
[1:33:36] for it is certain that we can take
[1:33:39] nothing with us
[1:33:43] as far as this world not no character in
[1:33:44] the spiritual realm but in the natural
[1:33:46] realm
[1:33:47] you'll carry nothing with you
[1:33:50] you'll go out empty-handed
[1:33:56] why do you think jesus told us
[1:33:58] labor not for the meat that perishes but
[1:34:00] labor for the meat that endures unto
[1:34:02] everlasting life work for that for this
[1:34:05] eternal
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:10] praise be to god
[1:34:13] are you ready for the good news
[1:34:15] i got some good news for you this
[1:34:16] morning
[1:34:18] he comes
[1:34:20] for to kill
[1:34:22] and to destroy
[1:34:23] i am come
[1:34:27] thus saith the spirit
[1:34:30] i am come that you might have lights
[1:34:34] and that
[1:34:36] you might have it more abundantly
[1:34:40] he gives joy and he wants your joy to be
[1:34:44] full this morning
[1:34:46] not half full not a little full and let
[1:34:49] me tell you that's what gets the whole
[1:34:50] world and everybody out there in trouble
[1:34:52] because they seek joy they see comfort
[1:34:56] huh
[1:34:57] and they stick it in the wrong place and
[1:35:00] it'll destroy them
[1:35:03] i remember probably god made a statement
[1:35:04] the other day he says you know a
[1:35:06] people's comfort is their god
[1:35:09] what
[1:35:10] their comfort is in god whatever they to
[1:35:12] turn to for comfort that's their god and
[1:35:15] didn't jesus say i'll send you a
[1:35:17] comforter amen i'm aren't you there for
[1:35:20] that god said he's going to send us a
[1:35:22] comp
[1:35:23] order
[1:35:24] so that we can have some comfort in this
[1:35:26] world
[1:35:28] the real comfort that gives you peace
[1:35:30] gives you joy
[1:35:32] gives you happiness gives you soundness
[1:35:36] makes man a man make the woman a woman
[1:35:39] makes teenagers teenagers everybody in
[1:35:41] line full of joy the way it's supposed
[1:35:44] to be
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:51] take a sinner like me
[1:35:53] that thought van halen and ac dc and all
[1:35:55] that smoking was
[1:35:57] joy and happiness
[1:35:59] huh
[1:36:00] i found out real quick that don't never
[1:36:02] satisfy neither
[1:36:03] rock and roll music
[1:36:05] that ain't gonna satisfy is it that
[1:36:09] there's only one thing that satisfies
[1:36:16] and it's when your cook cup gets filled
[1:36:20] when that void in there in your heart
[1:36:22] gets filled with god
[1:36:24] [Music]
[1:36:25] you were never meant to live through
[1:36:27] this life without god
[1:36:29] the world wasn't meant to be without god
[1:36:31] that's why he gave his son amen for the
[1:36:34] whole world so the whole world whosoever
[1:36:36] believeth in him should not perish i've
[1:36:38] come to give you life and that more
[1:36:40] abundantly come unto me oh you are weary
[1:36:43] and heavy laden and i will give you
[1:36:48] rest
[1:36:54] wow
[1:36:56] that's nice
[1:37:00] it's nice
[1:37:02] being a christian
[1:37:04] heard brother bam say yesterday
[1:37:06] he said you know i believe that if i
[1:37:07] wasn't a christian i'd almost be a
[1:37:09] suicide case
[1:37:11] huh
[1:37:13] isn't it a
[1:37:14] wonder that there is so many suicide
[1:37:16] cases because they don't have a christ
[1:37:18] in their heart they have no hope
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:23] people think they're rich
[1:37:27] and unto the angels will lay out the
[1:37:29] sins he writes
[1:37:31] because thou sayest i am rich and
[1:37:33] increased with goods and have needed
[1:37:35] nothing and no it's not they're not that
[1:37:37] are wretched you're miserable
[1:37:41] you're poor
[1:37:42] you're blind
[1:37:44] and you're naked
[1:37:47] and no it's not notice they and no it's
[1:37:49] not the toward all of these things
[1:37:54] it's time
[1:37:55] to be rich in christ
[1:37:57] so in this world speaking
[1:38:00] all of your rights will be taken away
[1:38:01] you can't even buy ourselves without
[1:38:04] taking the mark of the beast
[1:38:06] huh
[1:38:09] i was listening yesterday and brother
[1:38:10] was talking about the mark of the beast
[1:38:12] of unbelief
[1:38:15] and when christ comes before you
[1:38:17] when the word is presented to you and
[1:38:19] you disbelieve that you either receive
[1:38:20] the baptism of the holy ghost right by
[1:38:23] you are sealed until the day of
[1:38:24] redemption you have
[1:38:26] the mark of god in your heart and in
[1:38:28] your head in that right you have the
[1:38:30] seal of god
[1:38:31] you take the seal of god or you take
[1:38:33] this mark of the beast through unbelief
[1:38:36] and i had to think look at all the
[1:38:37] people that's taken the mark of the
[1:38:38] beast
[1:38:40] look at all the people with the mark of
[1:38:41] the beast
[1:38:43] unbelievers that don't believe the word
[1:38:44] of god have taken the mark of the beast
[1:38:46] when they reject it to truth
[1:38:48] it's a tremendous thing
[1:38:51] you know the scary part i heard brother
[1:38:53] brown say he says you know you'll still
[1:38:55] go to church
[1:38:57] but wherever you turn down the truth
[1:38:58] you'll just keep going to church
[1:39:00] and i was like you'll keep going to
[1:39:02] church yeah keep going to church
[1:39:04] thinking you're all right
[1:39:06] but you turn down the truth
[1:39:08] now he won't never believe it
[1:39:11] again
[1:39:14] god help me never
[1:39:16] to disbelieve god when he speaks to my
[1:39:18] heart don't you believe the holy spirit
[1:39:20] when he speaks to your heart
[1:39:22] you say well that's just the preacher is
[1:39:23] it really
[1:39:25] huh
[1:39:26] now that's supposed to be god talking to
[1:39:28] you isn't that right
[1:39:40] praise the lord
[1:39:42] do you love one another
[1:39:45] are you glad to be a part of the family
[1:39:47] of god
[1:39:50] i'm so glad to be a part of the family
[1:39:51] of god
[1:39:53] now we want to go to
[1:39:55] um
[1:39:56] another scripture in
[1:40:00] galatians three
[1:40:02] we will talk about an heir
[1:40:05] an heir of god
[1:40:07] now we know that in this world
[1:40:09] a lot of parents a lot of people
[1:40:11] get a lot of riches and when they pass
[1:40:13] away
[1:40:14] where does all those things go to
[1:40:16] those things go to what they call an
[1:40:18] heir
[1:40:19] an heir that receives the inheritance
[1:40:23] right
[1:40:24] an inheritance
[1:40:26] amen and there's a lot of very rich
[1:40:28] people as i was coming to church i
[1:40:30] thought about trump and
[1:40:32] ivanka i guess it is and jared maybe and
[1:40:35] some of those children of his and you
[1:40:38] know the things they would inherit when
[1:40:40] their parents pass away and so forth
[1:40:46] you know
[1:40:47] isn't that right
[1:40:49] jesus inherits everything
[1:40:53] all power jesus when he come uh he came
[1:40:56] back and talked to disciples he says all
[1:40:57] power is given unto me
[1:41:00] in heaven and earth he's got a name that
[1:41:02] is with every name that is named
[1:41:06] and then paul says in chapter 3 of
[1:41:08] galatians verse 29 and if ye be christ
[1:41:11] then ye are abraham's seed and heirs
[1:41:14] according to the promise
[1:41:17] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[1:41:20] a child different nothing from his
[1:41:22] servant though he be lord of all but
[1:41:24] he's under tutors and governors until
[1:41:25] the time appointed of the father even so
[1:41:28] we when we were children and under the
[1:41:29] bondage of the elements of the world but
[1:41:31] when the fullness of time came god sent
[1:41:34] his forth his son made of a woman made
[1:41:35] it under the law to redeem them that are
[1:41:38] under the law that he might receive the
[1:41:40] adoption of sons
[1:41:43] and because he our sons god has sent
[1:41:46] forth his spirit the spirit of his son
[1:41:50] into our hearts crying abba father
[1:41:54] praise be to god aren't you glad to have
[1:41:56] a father
[1:41:58] i am so thankful to have a heavenly
[1:42:00] father
[1:42:02] amen
[1:42:03] now notice wherefore thou art no more a
[1:42:06] servant but a son and if a son
[1:42:09] than an heir of god through christ
[1:42:13] another place the bible says where joy
[1:42:15] heirs with christ
[1:42:17] in other words we're joint heirs christ
[1:42:19] inherits everything and everything he
[1:42:22] hates you in hell also
[1:42:26] now we're starting to look at what paul
[1:42:28] was saying about the unsearchable riches
[1:42:31] of christ
[1:42:32] how many knows it is absolutely the
[1:42:34] greatest the most richest things are in
[1:42:37] god
[1:42:38] here it says that we're heirs of god one
[1:42:42] of the first things you'll notice and if
[1:42:43] you ever go to church you ever dedicate
[1:42:45] your life to god you ever have something
[1:42:47] down in your heart amen it causes you to
[1:42:49] want to turn from your ways amen say god
[1:42:52] forgive me of my sins i need you lord
[1:42:55] one thing that you have to believe and
[1:42:56] that is that you are a son of god
[1:43:01] you are god's child
[1:43:04] you're coming to him
[1:43:06] all that the father has given will come
[1:43:08] to me and i will keep losing none of
[1:43:10] them
[1:43:13] amen you've got to believe that your
[1:43:14] child and if you are a son
[1:43:17] when you are a son and you get born
[1:43:18] again it shows you that you are an heir
[1:43:23] of god
[1:43:29] y'all remember brother ben him in the
[1:43:30] back of that trailer and he had a little
[1:43:31] typewriter and he hadn't much know all
[1:43:33] it'll be the office
[1:43:35] hey man he was
[1:43:36] world knows brother bannon was
[1:43:39] but billy graham all roberts they had
[1:43:41] their multi-million dollar buildings and
[1:43:43] so forth and so forth he says lord look
[1:43:44] what they got
[1:43:46] and look at what i got and something in
[1:43:48] his heart kind of spoke to himself yeah
[1:43:50] but you got me i'm yours
[1:43:52] how many knows that i don't care if you
[1:43:54] got nothing if you've got god you got
[1:43:56] everything
[1:43:58] amen it's heirs of god what is god god
[1:44:02] is eternal life
[1:44:04] you and i are heirs to eternal life
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] and everything
[1:44:13] that pertains to god so much so
[1:44:17] so much so that jesus said
[1:44:19] he that overcometh will sit with me
[1:44:22] in my throne
[1:44:25] amen even as i overcame and sat in my
[1:44:28] father's throne
[1:44:29] when you are a child of god you are an
[1:44:32] heir
[1:44:34] to the throne
[1:44:40] how many knows that when jesus sits on
[1:44:42] that throne and rules and reigns for a
[1:44:44] thousand years
[1:44:45] somebody's going to be with him
[1:44:47] a king has a
[1:44:50] queen
[1:44:52] a king has a queen
[1:44:55] we are his queen we're going to sit with
[1:44:57] him we're going to rule with him
[1:45:00] but before we ever do that
[1:45:02] we've got some overcoming to do don't we
[1:45:05] we've got some trials we gotta go
[1:45:06] through we gotta do some fighting that
[1:45:08] we gotta do
[1:45:10] like in joshua if you remember every
[1:45:12] place that the soul of your foot treads
[1:45:14] that's yours it belongs to you
[1:45:17] that's it with the word of god when you
[1:45:19] become born again when you get filled
[1:45:21] with the holy ghost every promise in the
[1:45:24] book is yours
[1:45:27] i don't know if it takes me two weeks
[1:45:28] next two weeks to go through them all
[1:45:30] but i want to go through some of them
[1:45:31] would that be all right
[1:45:32] we want to look at what's ours

[1:45:37] realize what's ours
[1:45:41] and you can just take one little thing
[1:45:46] and be happy
[1:45:48] brother bam tells the story of

[1:49:04] paul said to the those in acts 19 and
[1:49:07] says have you received the holy ghost
[1:49:09] since you've believed
[1:49:11] huh
[1:49:12] here's says after you believed
[1:49:15] you were sealed
[1:49:17] with that holy spirit
[1:49:19] of promise
[1:49:21] amen so you were sealed
[1:49:23] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:49:29] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:49:32] possession
[1:49:33] hallelujah
[1:49:35] praise be to god
[1:49:37] the holy spirit is the down payment
[1:49:40] until god comes and takes you home
[1:49:43] that's what i'm reading here
[1:49:45] it's a down payment it's the earnest of
[1:49:47] your inheritance
[1:49:49] it's the earnest that if you get put in
[1:49:51] the grave you'll rise again it's the
[1:49:53] earnest that if you lay down and you are
[1:49:56] fixing to die there's somebody there to
[1:49:58] carry you over not only that but you'd
[1:50:00] see earnest anybody if you are in this
[1:50:03] world that you've got a heavenly father
[1:50:05] that cares about you and has promised to
[1:50:07] take care of you
[1:50:10] i'm just glad for inheriting a father
[1:50:13] we're adopted we were adopted into this
[1:50:15] and we inherited a father
[1:50:18] a father that cares
[1:50:21] about you
[1:50:24] let's talk about the father for just a
[1:50:26] minute would that be okay
[1:50:28] one of my favorite scriptures
[1:50:31] matthew 6 and verse 24 says no man can
[1:50:35] serve two masters
[1:50:37] for either he will hate the one and love
[1:50:38] the other or else he will hold to the
[1:50:40] one and despise the other you cannot
[1:50:42] serve god and mammon
[1:50:44] one thing we have learned and know that
[1:50:46] that is that there's only two powers in
[1:50:48] this universe
[1:50:50] one is the power of the devil
[1:50:52] one is the power of god
[1:50:55] how many knows that there's no there's
[1:50:56] no other you'll either serve the devil
[1:50:59] or you'll serve god
[1:51:02] no other you've got no other choice
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:08] therefore he says jesus says now notice
[1:51:10] where jesus goes after telling everybody
[1:51:12] that you're going to either serve one or
[1:51:14] the other he says therefore take no
[1:51:16] thought for your life of what you shall
[1:51:18] eat or what you shall drink or know yet
[1:51:20] for your body what show you shoop it on
[1:51:22] it's not life more than the meat
[1:51:24] embodied in raiment
[1:51:26] he gets it talking about our food he
[1:51:28] gets uh talking about our drink he talks
[1:51:30] about our clothes he talks about a body
[1:51:34] huh
[1:51:36] don't worry about all of that
[1:51:39] don't think so much about all of that
[1:51:41] paul didn't jesus didn't
[1:51:44] all christians that's not their number
[1:51:46] one priority
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:51] our food our clothes our well-being is
[1:51:54] not our number one priority
[1:51:57] amen
[1:52:00] oh my
[1:52:02] verse 28 and why take thee thought for
[1:52:04] raymond consider the lilies of the field
[1:52:06] how they grow
[1:52:07] they tall not neither do they spin and
[1:52:09] yet i say unto you that even solomon in
[1:52:12] all of his glory was not arrayed as one
[1:52:14] of these ones
[1:52:16] i don't know what that means
[1:52:18] the only thing i can figure is that
[1:52:20] solomon was raiding some kind of beauty
[1:52:23] huh
[1:52:24] but he says these are
[1:52:27] a rating better than what he was huh
[1:52:32] because when god takes care of you
[1:52:35] you're in good hands
[1:52:37] how many i have to be in good hands
[1:52:40] what i'm reading here brothers
[1:52:42] this is that god wants you to think
[1:52:44] about him
[1:52:46] he wants you to have your focus on him
[1:52:48] more than anything else
[1:52:50] because he
[1:52:52] thinks about you more than anything else
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:57] don't get me going
[1:53:00] even solomon was in the raid like all of
[1:53:01] these wherefore if god so clothed the
[1:53:03] grass of the field which today is how
[1:53:06] many know the little rain that we get
[1:53:08] the bible says that god brings the rain
[1:53:11] he's the one that brings the showers
[1:53:14] i know some of us
[1:53:15] sister picky are thinking praise god for
[1:53:18] the rain
[1:53:19] we needed some rain
[1:53:21] it's just like a revival you can't pump
[1:53:23] it up
[1:53:24] you can't brew it up it has to be a
[1:53:26] sovereign come down by the holy ghost
[1:53:29] and it's got to give you a revival
[1:53:32] got to give you inspiration
[1:53:36] aren't you glad for it now notice
[1:53:43] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[1:53:45] the oven
[1:53:46] shall he not much more clothe ye
[1:53:48] o ye of little faith
[1:53:51] therefore take no thought saying what
[1:53:53] are we going to eat
[1:53:54] what are we going to drink where we
[1:53:56] thought shall we be clothed
[1:53:58] for after all these things to the
[1:53:59] gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[1:54:02] knoweth that you have need of all these
[1:54:04] things
[1:54:06] praise be to god
[1:54:08] i may know that if you are a son of god
[1:54:10] you are an heir of god you're an heir to
[1:54:13] the father and the father promised you
[1:54:15] he will fix it he will take care of you
[1:54:18] whatever your need is
[1:54:23] i'm so happy that i don't have to go one
[1:54:25] day without him
[1:54:27] you don't have to go one day without him
[1:54:30] not one minute without him
[1:54:32] no matter what comes your way when you
[1:54:35] commit it to god and believe god you'll
[1:54:37] see miracles
[1:54:39] god is not a miracle working god of the
[1:54:41] past he's a miracle working god of the
[1:54:43] day
[1:54:44] he's a working of miracles of god god we
[1:54:46] don't need just a god of a history in
[1:54:48] brother bramstein we need that same god
[1:54:50] here this morning
[1:54:51] we need him to raise the dead to heal
[1:54:53] the sick they open up the eyes of the
[1:54:55] blind we need him to cast out devils
[1:55:00] cast out lukewarm that was cast out the
[1:55:03] devils of depression
[1:55:07] hallelujah
[1:55:14] now
[1:55:15] i want to go to the scripture that
[1:55:17] was inspired to me to begin with
[1:55:21] found in
[1:55:22] corinthians i believe it is
[1:55:31] my father is rich
[1:55:34] in houses
[1:55:37] he holds the wealth of the world in his
[1:55:40] hands
[1:55:42] amen and i'm in there
[1:55:45] i'm in here
[1:55:51] glory
[1:55:53] i'm in there
[1:55:55] i'm just glad to be there
[1:55:58] you want to know what you're an heir of
[1:56:01] if you're a christian what are you in
[1:56:03] there of
[1:56:04] now i just showed you that if you're in
[1:56:05] there of god you have a heavenly father
[1:56:07] now
[1:56:08] he cares about the clothing where he
[1:56:10] goes about every detail about you
[1:56:13] let that sing in old people young people
[1:56:16] god cares about every detail of you
[1:56:19] he cares about whether you got clothes
[1:56:20] to wear food to eat and so forth
[1:56:23] i never even finished it did i no later
[1:56:26] on he says but seek ye first the kingdom
[1:56:28] of god and his righteousness and all
[1:56:30] these things might be added unto you
[1:56:33] no a resounding
[1:56:35] no
[1:56:36] shall be added on to you
[1:56:39] it
[1:56:40] will i sit down don't run around so much
[1:56:45] i'm telling you that's so awesome to
[1:56:47] think that it shall be added unto you
[1:56:49] it'll be you'll be taken care of
[1:56:54] i can't do the devil devil
[1:56:57] you can't
[1:56:58] touch me
[1:57:00] because there's somebody between us
[1:57:01] unless he lets you
[1:57:06] the devil was robbed of every right that
[1:57:09] he had at calvary
[1:57:11] he was stripped of all of his rights he
[1:57:13] has no rights whatsoever anymore
[1:57:18] amen
[1:57:20] praise the lord
[1:57:23] okay so this is where i got the thinking
[1:57:26] you know
[1:57:31] maybe eventually they'll take your home
[1:57:34] your land who knows what they'll do
[1:57:37] we don't have no idea what's ahead do we
[1:57:40] we don't know how bad it's going to
[1:57:41] get other than the bible says that you
[1:57:43] won't even be able to buy ourselves
[1:57:46] huh maybe you won't be able to buy but
[1:57:48] y'all sell your house if you wanted to
[1:57:50] they do whatever they kind of want to do
[1:57:52] right
[1:57:54] but that's okay
[1:57:56] that's okay
[1:57:57] because i want to tell them something i
[1:57:58] want to say this it's mine anyway
[1:58:03] it belongs to me
[1:58:09] can i just quote you a scripture you
[1:58:10] want you want would you like some kind
[1:58:12] of contract would you like some kind of
[1:58:14] word
[1:58:15] brother don't just say that you can't
[1:58:17] just say that
[1:58:21] the bible has to say it
[1:58:23] all right
[1:58:25] matthew 5 5
[1:58:26] the meek
[1:58:27] shall inherit the earth
[1:58:32] the meat
[1:58:33] shall inherit the earth
[1:58:36] paul said it this way
[1:58:38] let no man glory in men
[1:58:41] for
[1:58:42] all things
[1:58:43] are yours
[1:58:48] [Laughter]
[1:58:51] uh
[1:58:53] we ain't happy enough about that we
[1:58:55] really aren't
[1:58:57] that's in first corinthians 3
[1:59:00] and verse 21
[1:59:02] for paul says
[1:59:04] all things are yours
[1:59:06] whether apoll or apollos
[1:59:10] or the world
[1:59:15] the world he had the same
[1:59:17] tone that jesus said the saints shall or
[1:59:21] this meek shall inherit the earth
[1:59:26] the world or life
[1:59:29] praise be to god
[1:59:32] he that hath the son hath life he that
[1:59:34] hath not the son hath not life
[1:59:38] ye who were once dead in sins and
[1:59:41] trespasses has god made it alive
[1:59:45] or quickened
[1:59:46] so how many knows life is yours
[1:59:49] the holy ghost's mind holy ghost is mine

[2:31:47] you know i guess
[2:31:48] one of my favorite quotes of brother
[2:31:50] brandon's is he
[2:31:51] talks about that man that got so excited
[2:31:53] at the ball game he just grabbed his hat
[2:31:55] and jerked it down over his head
[2:31:57] you know brother brad
[2:31:58] in my mind it was the bottom of the
[2:32:00] ninth
[2:32:01] two outs basis loading this down three
[2:32:04] he had a grand slam
[2:32:05] he just got excited
[2:32:07] hey man i believe we had a grand slam
[2:32:09] this morning amen
[2:32:11] amen you know
[2:32:12] it's just been a wonderful time this
[2:32:14] morning
[2:32:15] god is so good and he answers our
[2:32:16] prayers
[2:32:18] you come hungry he'll feed you
[2:32:21] his presence is so awesome
[2:32:24] you know god has been so good to us
[2:32:26] church
[2:32:27] he's worked many miracles in here and
[2:32:30] i just
[2:32:31] and you know we're all a miracle
[2:32:34] from where he brought us from and where
[2:32:35] he's got it
[2:32:37] and i go back and
[2:32:40] i don't i don't think of
[2:32:44] of not being raised right because i had
[2:32:46] the best parents in the world but i had
[2:32:47] to have a change in my heart and my life
[2:32:50] i had to recognize that i needed jesus
[2:32:52] christ
[2:32:54] because i was just a young smart aleck
[2:32:56] person headed to death by a way of
[2:32:59] driving like an idiot
[2:33:01] but god spared me rich in his mercy he
[2:33:03] cared for me
[2:33:05] and i look back sometimes and i think
[2:33:09] where would i be
[2:33:11] without the grace of god in my life
[2:33:14] where would i be today
[2:33:16] i can tell you this much i wouldn't be
[2:33:17] here
[2:33:19] but i'm so thankful
[2:33:21] that he loves me
[2:33:22] he cared for me
[2:33:25] and whenever satan tells you you're
[2:33:26] nothing
[2:33:28] say satan
[2:33:29] i just want to remind you something
[2:33:32] before there was ever you before the
[2:33:34] foundation of the world
[2:33:36] god
[2:33:38] thought of me
[2:33:40] he thought of me
[2:33:42] and i'm thankful for that aren't you
[2:33:43] this morning
[2:33:44] and i don't know if y'all know it today
[2:33:46] but today's a national holiday brother
[2:33:48] steve is 65 and he snuck out on there he
[2:33:51] is brother steve is 65
[2:33:54] today so
[2:33:59] this is the only time he'll ever be 65
[2:34:01] because when he goes to glory he'll be
[2:34:03] 18 again so
[2:34:05] enjoy your 65 brother steve
[2:34:07] god bless you we love you all this
[2:34:09] morning and amen as you go this morning
[2:34:12] remember those that are
