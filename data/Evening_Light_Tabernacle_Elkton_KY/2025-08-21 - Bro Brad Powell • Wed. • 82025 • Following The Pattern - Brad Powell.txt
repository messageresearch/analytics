And brother Austin's learning and uh Brother Devin is helping him. So we'll blame it on Brother Devon. He's new. And everybody will have grace for brother Devon. God bless you.

Brother Caleb and brother Tommy, would you come take up the offering tonight? And we have several prayer requests tonight. And uh Sister Sherry said, "Brother Glenn is really weak and not feeling well tonight. We want to remember him in prayer." And also, Brother Daniel Wade said, "Sister Julie's not feeling well. We want to remember her." And Sister Hannah asked that we'd remember the Amber Goden family. Did I pronounce that right? remember that family in prayer tonight. The Lord knows what they have need of. And also uh Sister Serenity and Haven and SA have gone out to see Brother Wallace and he still needs a lot of prayer. He's very weak, they said. So we want to remember him in prayer tonight and also brother Austin said in the prayer before church that uh he's needs a touch from the Lord. The Lord knows what he has need of tonight. and we want to remember him in prayer and also uh Sister Parish and Sister Peggy also continue to remember brother Mooney. He's brother Thomas said he's doing some better. So we want to just hold brother brother Mooney up in prayer tonight that God will just move on his behalf. And I was thinking as I was writing the prayer request down and brother Joe and we've talked about it. remember our our children that don't serve the Lord and my children and his children and if you have loved ones just want to continue to pray for them that God would speak to their heart and amen we live in a late hour. So if you have need on your heart tonight, you might just lift to the Lord in prayer. And we're going to ask brother Tommy if he'd pray over the offering these needs tonight. Sing that little course.

How great is our God. Oh, how great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God? And all will see how great, how great is our God. Amen. We certainly serve a great and mighty God tonight. I tell you what, it's just it's good to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; It's good to be a believer. that you know the difference between the false and the truth. &gt;&gt; And it's it's just good to know where you stand in this late hour that we're living in. And and that we've been given a a a way and a direction and a path. And we're going to speak on some of that tonight. And we're going to look at some thoughts in through our church age book. We're going to take a thought uh following the pattern. following the pattern. And uh so and looking at that and and uh as you're turning into your Bibles, if you want to turn to 1 Chronicles chapter 28, we'll get into the word here. Let me get things started up here. We don't want to try to hold you long tonight, but uh we know it's been a been a long week, I'm sure, for everybody. And and you're tired. How many's tired? Just be honest. &gt;&gt; Some of us are tired and uh but how many can set aside about 50 minutes to &gt;&gt; for the for the word of the Lord? Amen. I think I heard them mention in the prayer, but we do want to remember before we go into the words tonight. remember Amber Amber Golden and Anora in a special way and just a just a real tragic event and and that had taken place and you know you don't understand. I talked to brother Joseph and called him and talked to him and he said you know sometimes the way of the Lord just breaks your heart and we know they're heartbroken and our heart breaks with them. So, we'll remember them in a in a special way. They've been friends of ours for for years and we were planning to go out with them this weekend and after the meeting and have a little little snack and and we setting those arrangements up and life changes. You know, things things have a way of changing. You don't know what tomorrow holds. And so, uh, just remember them in your prayers in a special way. So, uh, read this little quote here as we get started and before we get into our scripture. And brother Random's speaking now. And he's he's speaking here in the in the when he preaches the Ephesian church. And he's speaking and he said, "Each one of these churches according to scripture here had an angel." And now this is the foundation part of the foundation of what we believe and why we believe what we believe. Because you won't find a lot of this in denominational teaching. You won't find this in in in in a lot of the seminaries. You won't find the church ages, the seven se. You won't find these preached this way. And he says now he each age that according to the scripture had an angel. And the angel how many knows is a messenger. That's a messenger. Yes, it is. There were seven angels to the seven church ages. It meant seven messengers. We see it in the board here. And so he says these were the seven stars that was to reflect the light of his presence in the day of night in the in the day of night that we're living in. As the stars reflect the sun to the earth, it makes it light so we can walk and get around at nighttime. So no matter how dark this hour gets, no matter how dreary it seems, no matter how dismal it may feel in our lives around us, as we see the world falling apart and becoming darker and darker, there is a light. &gt;&gt; We've had a message that shed the light upon the hour that we're living in and tells you who you are. So we got a lot to be thankful for. He says, "Now we find out then that during this time each one of those angels had a position and a place." He says, "And brethren, tonight we don't we don't get to it because we know the angel of the first age, but it's going to be a mysterious, glorious thing to find and pull out of history before you, the angels of these other churches." The angel of the first church was St. Paul. &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he says. He founded it. &gt;&gt; There's a foundation there. &gt;&gt; We look at the word and we look at the the stature of the perfect man. We look at the way this is laid out. There's a foundation there that Paul built the word upon. He took the word and built this foundation that we could stand on. That we don't have to stand on shifting sands that the winds of life will not prevail against us because we've been given a firm foundation built by the founder of Paul. He said, "Yes, sir." He founded it. It's He's God's messenger. The angel of the church of Ephesus was St. Paul. Now, he said there there may be these that might disagree, but I've sat there for days and days under inspiration till I felt the Holy Spirit strike me and anoint me for this. That's the reason I know. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I know. And I watched these men that have been picked. He's talking about Paul, Ireanius, Martin, Columbus, Luther, Wesley himself. I've watched these men that have been picked. He said, if you're in a historian, the same man that I have got here, you know by Revelation that they was the angels to the church. Watch what he says now. And they had the same ministry that these did at the beginning. &gt;&gt; The same ministry. Every one of those had the same ministry that they did on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell. &gt;&gt; And that ministry cannot change. &gt;&gt; It must. He says it must. Not it might, not it could, not maybe, but it must stay Pentecost all the way through. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing a pattern as we're talking about a pattern? And I liked how he said it must stay Pentecost. He didn't say Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; How many Pentecostal people were in his meetings in and out and in and out? He he wasn't telling them, "Hey, you need to stay the way you are." He said, "You need to go back to the way it was." &gt;&gt; Not a Pentecostal experience the way they have it nowadays or the way it was in the churches that he was against preaching against. But let's go back to Pentecost like it was when the the Holy Ghost fell and Paul took the word and built this foundation that we stand upon. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 28. Now, I'm going to try to preach this in a way I told my wife, I said, I'm preaching something tonight that I've never seen tied like this in the message, but by God's grace, we'll we'll tie it together, and I trust that it's a blessing to you the way it blessed me when it came to us. So um 1 Chronicles 28 11 then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasures thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlors thereof and of the place of the mercy seat and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the courts of the house of the Lord and of all all the chambers around and the treasuries of the house of the of God and the treasuries of dedicated things also for the courses of the priests and the Levites and for all the work and of the service of the house of the Lord and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Lord. Do you see what's happening here? God is being very specific in what he's what he's doing. He says he gave gold by weight of the things of gold of instruments of all manner of service. Silver also for the instruments of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service. Even now I like how that's put in there because it's telling us that he is mindful of the little things. &gt;&gt; He's mindful of the little things in your life and my life and our kids' lives. He's mindful of the little things. the way we live our life. He's mindful because he says even the weight of the candlesticks of gold and for their lamps of gold by the weight of every candlestick and for the lamps thereof and for the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the candlestick and for the lamps thereof according to the use of every candlestick. And by weight he gave gold for the tables of sha uh of showbread for every table. And likewise silver for the table of silver also pure gold for the flesh hooks and the and the bowls and the cups and for the golden basin and for the gold by weight for every basin. And likewise silver by weight of every basin of silver. This is specific. God is building a house. He's building a tabernacle. He's building He's building something that he has revealed to David. And now David is telling Solomon and this is very specific. We have to live a very specific kind of life. &gt;&gt; As believers, you're set aside and pulled apart separate and different than the denominations, different than the systems, different than those around. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen what he says in verse 18. for the altar of incense of refined gold and gold for the pattern of the chariot of a chariot of the cherubams that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant. All this said David, the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me. Now there's a key part of this scripture. The Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern. So God let David understand as he come down and he laid his hands upon him. He said, "This is the way that it's going to be. This is the way the tabernacle of the house of God has to be built." &gt;&gt; He gave a message to a messenger. And David said unto Solomon his son, "Be strong and of good courage and do it. &gt;&gt; Do it." &gt;&gt; What the message says, do it. &gt;&gt; Don't do it with fear. Don't give into the temptation, but build the temple, the house of God, a place for God to rest in. Do it. If the message of the hour were to tell us anything in this day, what would it say? Follow the message and build yourself a tabernacle that God can dwell in. &gt;&gt; Do it without fear. &gt;&gt; Fear not, nor be dismayed. For the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee until thou hast finished the work for the service of the house of the Lord. You can have your seats tonight. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. So brothers and sisters, we see here that God has a pattern and a plan for each and every one of us in this hour that we're living in. So let me ask you tonight, is your house of God, is your house a place of rest to where God can come and rest in the hour that we're living in? Is this vessel Yes. &gt;&gt; A place of rest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God was telling David, we have to have a place of rest. Now, this had been on David's heart for quite some time. And I I'm going to tell the story and rehearse it a little bit, but I want you to understand and see here that David at this point had called together all the elders. And he had called and assembled all the people, all the leaders of Jerusalem. The word says that he had called in the prince of Israel, the princes of tribes, men who were captains of thousands, men who were captains of hundreds, men who were who were who were uh uh stewards over the substance and the possessions that he had. They knew his he called in his sons. He called in officers. He's called in all these mighty men and valor of Jerusalem. And David is here at the and we see that he's very well stricken in agent. He knows that his time on earth is just about over. But God has laid it on his heart that he should build a tabernacle, a house where God can dwell. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for messengers &gt;&gt; that God could use and come down through the ages, through the church ages, and and begin to build a house? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And so, here is David now, well stricken in age. And I want you to watch what he does. David stands up to his feet in front of all of these people and he says, "Hear me, the voice." &gt;&gt; The voice for the hour. &gt;&gt; Hear me. &gt;&gt; Are y'all awake? &gt;&gt; We've had a voice in this hour. &gt;&gt; We've had a voice that called out and said, "Hear me. come out of her my people. &gt;&gt; But David says, "Hear me, my brethren, for my heart has built in my heart, God has wanted me to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord." Now, we all familiar with the ark of the covenant. We're we're familiar with what the ark of the covenant is. And we look at this ark and we begin to see and we know that it's it's made out of wood and it's a special kind of wood. and uh and it's overlaid with gold and this ark has a gold lid and it's got the two winged cherubams that's that's facing one another and they're looking at each other and inside this ark there is the the tablets that had the ten commandments scribed upon it and in this ark there is a golden jar of mana from when they wandered in the wilderness the bread of life is still in the ark &gt;&gt; and in this ark there's also the Aaron's staff that budded in the presence. There's life in the ark. But what is the function of the ark? Why is it so important that this big huge house of God and this temple and tabernacle that is going to house the ark of the covenant? What is so significant? It's because that ark of the covenant is a symbol symbol symbolic representation of God's presence with Israel. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's building a house. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's building a house. He started building a house and he's continued to build and build and build upon the word and the word and it grows and it grows and every little bit we get down through time, man has progressed in the word of God &gt;&gt; to know what God wants out of us, &gt;&gt; the life that we should be living. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; A place that he can house himself. an ark and the covenant in the hearts of the believers. &gt;&gt; This is this is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; But here is David. Here's David. And and here we see this this uh this temple that David is beginning to build. Uh this this temple, we can look at it as this is our our temple. This is our house of clay. And we look at this and David begins to spread the message. There was a day that came where there was a message that was spread. &gt;&gt; There was a proclamation that went out. There was a voice that shouted &gt;&gt; in this last age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; And that voice called out a commission. Now, David knew himself that he could not build this house. David knew he couldn't build it because God had told him, "David, this is not for you to do because you are a man of war. You have shed blood after blood. You are a warrior. &gt;&gt; But I will choose your son Solomon. &gt;&gt; I will choose your son Solomon to build the house of God in this hour." You know the name Solomon means peaceful. It means wisdom. It means prosperity. It comes from the root word shalom which means peace. So now he has chosen the man for the hour. Sometimes, listen now, sometimes we get to preaching on this stuff. We get to preaching on this. We get to preaching on the the messengers. We get to preaching on church ages and the seals. And we get to preaching on all this. And then all of a sudden, we we we we preach about angels sent from God to reveal and open the word. And people begin to back up &gt;&gt; and be people begin to clam up and people just can't believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; They get so skeptical because of what we believe in this hour. &gt;&gt; They get so afraid and so skeptical and they begin to throw up the guard and they say, "What? You're following a man? Look at the pattern. Look at the pattern. Moses was a man. David was a man. &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, they were men. &gt;&gt; Paul was a man. &gt;&gt; So, yes, I can agree with them when they say that. Yes, because they fail to take it back to the pattern. I see the pattern. And I say, "Yes, you're exactly right. I am following." Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, some of you want a cloud, but you held back. I'm following a son of man who is revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; It's the message in the hour, the voice that goes forth that tells us what God is expected in this hour &gt;&gt; and what kind of people we will be as believers. &gt;&gt; Now, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? We've established that God does not change. Because if God changed his ways then and the things and the way he does things, then he wouldn't be God. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine trying to have confidence in a God that changes the way he does stuff? &gt;&gt; How could you have confidence in your healing knowing that God might change the way he does it? How could you have confidence in and knowing that you could be an overcomer if he changes it from one person to the next of what it takes to be an overcomer? How could you have confidence in God and and and and the power and demonstration of the word if he changes all the time? How could you even have confidence in salvation? If this person's salvation came this way and this person's came this way and this person's this way, you would think, my Lord, how was mine going to come? But there was one way that salvation came and it was the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't change. So if he doesn't change, there has to be a what? Pattern. &gt;&gt; A pattern. And this pattern begins to come down and begin to see, brothers and sisters, David had been given a pattern to follow for this building of the temple of the Lord. He'd been given a pattern. And God showed him exactly what it was that was to be built in order for the house of the treasures of God to be housed inside of it. In order for the presence of God to dwell in there, this house had to be built to God's exact specifications. Do you see why the message of the hour is so detailed? &gt;&gt; It's so detailed most can't follow it. That's why the word says the the message of the hour says it will be an elite group of people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, you're just lifting yourself up. You think you're better." I don't think I'm better than anybody else. &gt;&gt; But I am going to try to live and I'm going to try to do exactly what that word says and I'm not going to deviate. I was watching I seen a clip the other day and this this Pentecostal woman I probably what I'm just going to tell you she this Pentecostal woman was talking about how she was uh uh always wears her skirts and and then she was in a clip where she didn't have on a skirt because she was out playing with her kids and she was in shorts and she was at the beach and she was in shorts or a bathing suit and she got on there trying to defend herself. She tried to defend herself. She said, "Yeah, people say I that I'm not a true Pentecostal. I'm not true Pentecostal because I had on a pair of shorts." Well, you take it for what you want. You take it for what you want. Why would she have to defend herself? &gt;&gt; Why would she have to make an excuse for the way she was dressed? You see, we've been given such detailed way of life &gt;&gt; that it couldn't be off just a little bit. &gt;&gt; It either is or it ain't. &gt;&gt; I've said that a lot here lately. But when we get into the word, we say that we we either live by the word or we don't. She had to try to find a way to defend herself. Well, I was out playing in the yard with my kids. You can't do that in modest apparel, man. Y'all quiet. &gt;&gt; It's the truth whether we like it or not. &gt;&gt; But in the presence of God, when God's going to come down and dwell, there's no deviation. So David had a specific order. the way things were supposed to be. It had to line up perfectly. The furniture had to be lined up just perfectly. The candlesticks had to be weighed and measured and they had to just weigh just a certain amount and they had to be put in a certain place. The lamps, the lampstands, the tables, the the the the the flesh hooks, the showbread, uh the basins, the table for the showbread. All of this had to be in a specific way that God wanted. Now, I want you to watch. This was not David's idea. David could never go in there and say, "You know what? I think if we build the temple this way, God will be happy." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, I think if I just go and I give away a lot of money and and and I can do all of this and I can help people all around the world and I can live any way I want and I think God will be happy. &gt;&gt; Do you see how that don't work? &gt;&gt; It don't work that way. You You can give and you can give and you can give, but until you give yourself away, So David couldn't go in there and he could say, "Oh, I want to build this way or I want to put this over here or that over there." No, he couldn't do that. That's not the way it was. And David clearly told him, "This is not me." Have you ever noticed how the messenger of the hour always says, "This is not me. &gt;&gt; This is not me. This is God." And people say, 'Well, anybody could say that. But David says this. He says it, he made me understand by putting his hand upon me that all of the works of this pattern were true. David didn't want the respon. Can you imagine having that responsibility to what what if God said, "I want you to build me a house that's pleasing to me." And he gave you zero instruction. Where would you start? Where would you start? As a 16-year-old, as a teenager, how old are you? &gt;&gt; You had to think about it. 13 years old. As a teenager, what if God said, "I want a place to live in your heart, but he gave you no instructions of how to get there." As a 13y old, what would you think? Well, if I do this, if I do that, if I go here, if I do that, I'll be okay. No. But God has laid it out step by step instruction guide &gt;&gt; to the be the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the thing about it is is the the bride accepts it. &gt;&gt; The bride reads it. They hear it. They take it in and they say, "Oh, I I can see myself in the word. I can see myself growing in God's plan. I can see myself at the pent day of Pentecost because I'm doing the same things that they did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon preached the first seal. And I like how this this all comes together right here when I think about this and what David said, how God laid his hand upon him and wrote down and and God told him exactly what to do. Brother Brandham's preaching in the first seal. He said, "You see, the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world. Before anybody picked up an ink pen, the entire book was written." &gt;&gt; He says, "This book, the Bible, was written before the foundation of the world." So God has no surprises. &gt;&gt; God only has mouthpieces &gt;&gt; and lives lived. and lives that were documented to live just exactly the way he said it would be before the first pen took to paper. And so here he is now. He says, "Christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation and the members of his bride, their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; So he knew you would accept this. &gt;&gt; He knew you would follow the pattern. He knew you would walk in line and line up with the word upon word upon word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, listen to this. This is the part I wanted to get to talking about David and how God had to tell David exactly the pattern to follow." Brother Random's in the preaching on the first seal and he says, "I would have had a horrible mistake. If it had not been about 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit came into the room and corrected me on something, &gt;&gt; he had preached on the seals before. He had studied the seals before. He had studied the seals uh uh through through a Dr. Smith And he was looking at it again and he said, "I was looking at this again." And he said, "But the Holy Spirit came into the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say." He said, "I was taking it from an old context and it had no and I had nothing on it. I don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing." &gt;&gt; He's preaching a series on the seals that's going to be the revelation of the message of the hour to the bride of Jesus Christ. And he says in his own words, "I don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing. &gt;&gt; And I was going to preach the first one wrong, but the angel of the Lord come into the room and the Holy Ghost said, &gt;&gt; "That's not right." &gt;&gt; What was it? It was you in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world. If he would have spoke that wrong, where would we be today? But the angel, the Holy Ghost come into the room and spoke to him and brought it in together. And he said, but I had got some old context and I had gathered the context from this Dr. Smith, an outstanding teacher. And and they all believed it that way. So I had it wrote down and I was fixing to say it and study it from that standpoint until about 12:00 in the day, the Holy Spirit just swept through the room and the whole thing opened up to me. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the pattern opened up to him. &gt;&gt; The start of the first seal. He said that there it was the first seal being opened. And he said, "I'm as positive. I'm as positive as I'm standing here tonight that this is the gospel truth that I'm going to say here. I know it is." &gt;&gt; He wasn't trying to convince you of something he believed. It was God moving on the scene. So, can you see, brothers and sisters, how important it is that we follow the word upon word and the message of the hour to a tea? &gt;&gt; We don't have room. We don't have time in the hour we're living in to make excuses, to make other ways, &gt;&gt; to take detours. &gt;&gt; You know what a detour is? It takes you off route and it burns precious time. We don't need detours, brother Bo. We need to go straight there. We need a route that gets us to where we want to go. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So, if he had to be corrected by the word, by the Holy Ghost, what does that say for us? &gt;&gt; What does that say for us when we begin to deviate and we get a little off here, a little off there &gt;&gt; in this hour we're living? He says, listen at this. This is in the junction of time. And knowing that we're in the jun at the junction of time, the end time of the world, and we're weighed in the balance and found wanting. There's many maybe around the world. Yet today, millions and millions of people who doesn't believe that you're the same, that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And they have a form of godliness. and they're denying the power of your word. And yet you're sway they're swaying thousands of poor children into eternity without hope. What a blessing we have. &gt;&gt; What a blessing we have that God thought enough of us to lay out a guide &gt;&gt; that we don't have to wander anymore and wonder is it this way or is it that way? He says, listen to this. He said, they're they're leading the poor children into eternity without hope, without God, and lost with their social things about believing, &gt;&gt; social. &gt;&gt; What hour are we living in? Social media. Social life. Everybody wants to be a part of everybody. Everybody wants to know everybody. Well, how many followers can we get? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; How many people's keeping up with us? How many people know who we are? How many people I want to be the social? God's not looking for social butterflies. &gt;&gt; But he's what he is saying that they begin to get so social in their way of living. Parties became prominent. Music became prominent. Rock and roll came on the scene. New drugs came on the scene that were social drugs that led to social diseases. &gt;&gt; They began to get so social on things. He said, "You said they would have a form of godliness that they would belong to churches. I know Sunday school teachers that teach Sunday school and and and party like who wouldn't have it on Saturday night before they get there. We won't call any names or denominations. We'll just leave it at that. But is that the person you want teaching your kids Sunday school? &gt;&gt; I want somebody that's following the pattern. Are they perfect? No, we're not perfect. But are they trying? Are they following a pattern? Are they laying out a guideline that teaches our kids? &gt;&gt; Sure they are. That's what we want. We want people that that follow the guidelines having a form of godliness. They would belong to churches. They would have rituals. They would be baptized in many ways and other things and forms and study catechisms and taking in church papers and form of godliness and denying the power thereof. the power give to give a man a Holy Ghost to change his life and make him a new creature. And you say they turned such away. This is the hour that we're living in. Let me tell you, this church ought to be full tonight. &gt;&gt; Where are they? &gt;&gt; Where where where are the believers? Brother Baller, if we had everybody that that had some at some point went through this church, we couldn't put them all in the balcony. &gt;&gt; Where are the believers? Maybe somebody hears that. &gt;&gt; Here's David now. David acting as the messenger of the hour. He's come to deliver a message to Solomon. Exactly. God's expectations. And brothers and sisters, just like Solomon needed a messenger to follow the pattern to follow, we need a messenger that God given that has a God-given pattern of how we're able to live our lives. &gt;&gt; So that this vessel is a vessel of honor. Because let me tell you, if God is ever going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle, she's going to have to come a certain way. She's going to have to act a certain way. She's going to have to run her household a certain way. Men, you're going to have to be men of your houses. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to be husbands in the house. You're going to have to be the head of the house. You're going to have to treat your wives as God would treat the bride. &gt;&gt; Some of you saying, "Oh, me about right now." &gt;&gt; But this bride is going to be a special person. She's going to she's going to be she's she she's going to keep her house a certain way. She lives a certain way. Let me tell you, brother, something. If you hadn't figured this out, you're you're younger than I am because I figured out a long time ago. I didn't learn this lesson a long time ago, but I figured it out a long time ago. Women like their house a certain way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, I knew this a long time ago. I didn't learn it a long time ago. I can tell when the tension gets up in the house. &gt;&gt; Y'all have that happen at your place? It's usually because there's shoes in the floor, socks in the floor, dishes in the sink. &gt;&gt; Because why? She wants her place to be a certain way. &gt;&gt; If it's dirty, she don't like it. She don't like clutter. She don't like the house dirty. She don't like clutter. You don't believe me? Just scatter some stuff around. Leave it laying for a few days. You fix it to be met with a whirlwind, maybe a tornado. I'm going to leave you two alone, but I could tell a story because it's a certain way that she likes things. The bride doesn't like her house to be all filled with smut and filth of this world. She doesn't like her She doesn't like for you to bring the trash in. She's trying to get the trash out. That's the bride in this hour. I don't want trashy living in my life. I'm trying to get all of that out of my life. I want to get the garbage out. &gt;&gt; We ought to be getting the garbage out of our lives in this hour. And when she goes to cleaning, she scrubs and she scrubs and she scrubs. And if you scrubed, you probably didn't scrub long enough, husbands. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we got a we got a shower stall that we built. I I'm not. Yeah, we got a shower stall we built and it's got tile. Okay. We put little stone pebbles in the floor of it. Brother Ber &gt;&gt; and it's got 10 million grout lines and she goes I hear her in there. I hear those bristles just a scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing and for it says like an hour she's in there scrubbing. I'm like it's good enough. It's just me and you here. It's good enough but it's not good enough for her. I want that grout to be white. There's a spot over there. What? What? What? She said, "What kind of soap do you use? It don't come off of your side." I don't know. The same soap you use. And we scrub and she scrubs and she scrubs. She's not happy till the final stain is gone. Sometimes we need the bleach. &gt;&gt; We need the bleach in our lives. &gt;&gt; I got smart here a while back. You know, I I try to think outside the box. So, she says, "I don't like the smell of bleach. I know bleach will clean it, but it it burns my eyes and burns my lungs. I don't like it." I said, "Oh, well, okay. Use this generic stuff and scrub all day." Well, I was in one of those little pickles. I could see the look on her face. I'm like, I got to do something. I'm going to go clean this shower before she even asked. So, I go in there and I start scrubbing and I got I'm doing this. I think, I know what they used to use peroxide in the hospitals to clean with. It don't smell. It don't burn your eyes. It don't burn your lungs. So, I got me a big bottle of peroxide and I and I'm coating all the walls and I'm scrubbing and I'm scrubbing. I This is working pretty good. I had the door shut where she couldn't see. And I take it and then I go down there grout lines on the floor. I thought, man, this is kind of kind of dirty. Why? And I just poured the bottle out. And man, that stuff, you know how peroxide does, it just foams. I thought, man, this stuff going to run out in the floor. It wasn't that bad. But it was just foaming and bubbling and foaming and bubbling and foaming and bubbling. But the house had to be cleaned. Sometimes we need to find our lives to be dipped down into the blood, into the bleach of Jesus Christ, into the peroxide of Jesus Christ that eliminates those stains. Take the stain away. &gt;&gt; But the bride is not happy until the life is clean. Now watch what David says here. Getting back to our story. David tells talks now and he says to the congregation Solomon my son whom a God alone God has chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the Lord our God. &gt;&gt; The palace is not for man. You say, "Man, I I live my life and I wished I could do this and if I could do that and if I could to go here and if I had this job and if I had this career and if I could marry this woman and if I could have this car, if I could have this home, it's not for man. &gt;&gt; The life that we live is not for man. It's for God to live through us. He's looking for a place to dwell. Not a place that you could satisfy your every need and want and wander, &gt;&gt; but he's looking for a life lived. David tells all the preparations that been said here and the preparations have been made. And he said, "Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God. I've set my affection to the house of my God." What is your affection? David's affection was his his love, his desire, his his want for the things of God to take place and to happen in his life. I set my affections on the house of God. And that's where we got to be in this hour. We have to set our affections on the house of God. &gt;&gt; David wasn't just going through life day by day, day by day, here, here, there, and and everywhere, but he was preparing for a work of the Lord. He was following a pattern. So let me ask you, what is a pattern? It's a word we know, we hear, we think about it. But have you really thought about what the pattern really says? The definition of pattern is a form or a model proposed for imitation. So let me ask you, is your life imitating the life of Jesus Christ? Is our life imitating the life that was lived in Paul's day? Is our life imitating the life that was before our founding fathers, Ireneius, Martin, Columbus, because he said they all preached the same thing. &gt;&gt; Now, did they progress? Sure, they progressed. They had different things. They they begin to move forward. But the original group, the original church at Ephesus, are we right there? Are we living that life? Are our affections set up on that? Are we living our life as a model imitation of that? Listen what he says in the church age book. We know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Spirit how the first the original church was founded and God manifested himself in her. The word can't change or be changed because the word is God. And he says thus listen now. Thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard. That's the pattern. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the pattern. There is no other pattern. &gt;&gt; God has not changed the pattern. &gt;&gt; You think that was important since he said that three times in about a half a paragraph. &gt;&gt; God has not changed the pattern. He has to keep on doing until the church age closes. So don't get led astray. He says, "Don't get led astray." When I said that God and his ways never change, I did not listen to this. This is good. I did not say that the church and its messengers could not change. He said because the church isn't God, so she can change. But what I said was that was because of an unchanging God with unchanging ways. We can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect act of God and then judge by that standard. &gt;&gt; He says that is how it's done. You want to know where you're at, go back and look at the book of Acts. You want to know where you're at, go back and and read what Paul wrote. If you want to know where you're at, go back and read what he said to the Ephesian church and what he said in and to the letters uh to to Ephesus and to uh all the different places that he traveled. Go back and read and see what happened in Paul's life. &gt;&gt; Listen to this now. The first key that we have here is we received of the Lord. There comes another and less and slightly less wonderful truth. I said that the true church would always try to act like it was in the book of Acts. That's exactly right. But we have discovered that the word also teaches an invasion of error until it is complete blackout of truth. &gt;&gt; Do you see how precious the word is? because there is going to come a complete blackout of truth. He said in the last days when the Lord is about to appear, there's going to be a complete blackout. If you look at this picture, they've got it completely blacked out, but there is a sliver of light. &gt;&gt; There is a sliver of light in Elton, Kentucky. There is a sliver of light that's being portrayed by a bride of Christ in this area, in Johnson City, in mind, Louisiana, in Virginia, in Europe. There's a little sliver of light that is just shining and reflecting back what God is putting upon them. &gt;&gt; He says so he said a question now arises in our minds. Can you imagine as people said that it's going to be complete darkness. There would be no truth. So where does that leave us? He said a question comes into our mind now and it arises. Does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception? He said, "Oh, on no account." But the scripture says clearly in Matthew 24:24, "The elect cannot be deceived." &gt;&gt; She cannot be deceived because she's following what God has placed on her plate. She cannot be deceived because she's listening to a voice in the hour that we're living in. and a voice that does not deceive him, a voice that does not lie, a voice that follows what the Holy Ghost has said unto him. &gt;&gt; That's the voice. There shall arise false Christ, false prophets. They shall show great signs and wonders in so much as if it were possible. If it were possible, &gt;&gt; it's not possible, Sister Becky. &gt;&gt; There's something rooted on the inside, down deep on the inside. It's not possible for me to be deceived. &gt;&gt; Nobody talked me into this. &gt;&gt; And nobody's going to talk me out of it, brother B. Nobody talked me into this. But when I begin to read the word in the book, and I didn't understand it, but then I heard the voice of the hour &gt;&gt; and it be to clarify the words that I was reading. &gt;&gt; That's what talked me into this. Listen to this. The answer is clear before us. There is a true church and a false church. We talked about that Sunday a little bit. The true vine and a false vine. But of course, that false church, that false vine body will always try to usurp usurp the position of the true church. What does that usurp mean? It means to take a position of power or importance always. Satan is going to try to usurp what God has given you. He said always. And he said, but and take the position of that true church and contend, which means fight. Satan's going to fight that she is not the elect. He's going to tell you. He's going to talk to you. He's going to show you things to tell you you're not the elect. He tries to do that. I seen a clip today and it said it said uh if you're not in branomism that was I was trying to think how she word it keep scrolling thought what in the world so I began to listen and I thought you wolf you wolf in sheep's clothing she began to quote the message portions and then deny it and quote portions and deny it. And I wanted to for the first time in my life to reply to one of them things and say, "Why don't you say all that he said?" She began to ask certain kind of questions and then say, "Well, it this is this is his own idea. This is" I said, "No, no, I knew where she was getting them from." Do you see why it's so important that we stay in the book? &gt;&gt; We stay in the word because Satan is constantly in a combatant. He's trying to kill the true church, the true living word and the church of God. That is the pattern. So according to this pattern, we're going to be in this spiritual battle until the Lord comes back and we take a rapture. &gt;&gt; This battle is going to continue. Satan don't want you in church tonight. &gt;&gt; How many had a battle to get here? Look at that. Well, Satan don't want you reading your Bible. How many struggle with that? &gt;&gt; He don't want you listening to tapes. How many struggle with that? &gt;&gt; Why do you struggle with it? Because he occupies your time. If you got some busy uh uh some rest time and you think, man, I'm just going to go and I'm going to sit and I'm going to read the word. I'm going to listen to a tape. Watch and see what happens. Something will come up. There'll be some kind of emergency. Some kind of something will come up. Somebody will have a flat tire. Something over here will happen. Honey, can you do this? Honey, can you do that? But it's a a pattern. He doesn't want you to have that. He don't want you to have time to listen to the message. Why is that? Well, Josh, the more dedicated you find yourselves to Christ, the closer you get to Christ, the closer you come to looking like the pattern of the bride, the more you get into the word, the greater your faith becomes. Then those mountains that seem like they could not be moved, they become movable. &gt;&gt; Those those valleys that you find yourself going through, the greater your faith becomes in the word and you take on that pattern of Christ, you begin to become find yourself as an overcomer. &gt;&gt; It's in the word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing by hearing. &gt;&gt; So when Satan says you can't be healed, what does the word say in Isaiah 53? &gt;&gt; Do you see where your faith is? That's how your faith is built. That's how your faith grows. Because everything that Satan throws at you, Jesus has already answered. &gt;&gt; Jesus has already done it. &gt;&gt; Satan is nothing but a byproduct. &gt;&gt; He's not a creator. He's a perverter. &gt;&gt; Have you ever noticed, and I'm trying to find a place to to get off here. Have you ever noticed, brothers and sisters, that that people that know the message, they know the message of the hour, and they know it's truth, but they fail to follow it. Have you ever noticed they're some of the most miserable people you'll ever come in contact with? &gt;&gt; Why is that? is because there is a constant battle going on in their mind that they can't settle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they're fighting this battle in their mind. They know what's right. They know the truth. They know the word, but yet they cannot settle it down in their heart. And they can't separate themselves to a life that is fully surrendered to God. So this battle to follow the pattern is a constant. And they go through life and it's it's just over and over and over. They know they shouldn't dress a certain way, but they're pulled to dress immodestly. They know that they shouldn't be smoking, drinking, vaping, drugging. You put whatever you want in there. But there is something that is pulling them that direction. They can't resist it because they've not settled it. They've not separated themselves from the things of the world. There are women who know that it's not right to be cutting their hair, but they're pulled by the design, the designers of the world because they're not settled. &gt;&gt; They've not settled it down into their heart. They're not settled and completely separated from the world. They haven't completely fallen in love with Christ. And you you know a lot of times you know the prophet was was was tagged and and kind of ridiculed as a woman hater. He was not a woman hater. He loved the women. He loved the the the the ladies, the sisters of the church. What he was trying to do was send a warning out &gt;&gt; to those who wasn't following the word of God and following the pattern. And he was trying to let them know this is not what God has in mind for you. &gt;&gt; And if they could have just gotten in love with God and in love with the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; they wouldn't allow the things in their life to saturate them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But when you fall in love with God and that love affair begins to grow, I don't want to hurt him. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's just like in a husband and a wife. If that love is really there, you don't want to hurt him. &gt;&gt; I don't want to do things that would make my wife upset. &gt;&gt; She don't try to do things to uh intentionally provoke me, Brother Steve. But she loves me and I love her. She You know what my wife does? She puts me first. And you know what I try to do? Put her first. &gt;&gt; If I hurt her, I'm hurting me. And if I'm hurting me, I'm hurting Christ. &gt;&gt; I tell you how simple it is. I said the other night, I said, "You know what I want? I want some ice cream." Why ain't there a ice cream diet? You got a meat diet. You got a a a fruit diet, a vegetable diet. Where's the ice cream diet? &gt;&gt; I'd keep Dairy Queen in business if we had ice cream diet. But so I said, I'm we let's run to the dollar store and and and and get some ice cream. She said, ' Okay, what kind you want?' I said, 'Well, you know, some of that Neapolitan. Ain't that what it's called? Neapolitan. And we'll put some of your I'll put some of your strawberry jelly on top of it. And boy, it'll be good, Brother Stay. What are you laughing at? And I said, but I tell you what, you you get whatever you want cuz I know you don't like Neapolitan. I said, 'I know you don't like you like that chocolate with them brownies in it. I said, ' Just get that. I like it, too. I like it all. It'll be fine. I can put some jelly on that, too. So, she runs into the store. I can eat that jelly out of the jar, Brother Steve. You can laugh all you want, but that stuff's good. She runs into the store, &gt;&gt; and you know what she brought back? &gt;&gt; Neapolitan. Why? Because she knew that's what I wanted. And if I would have went into the store, what would I have brought back? &gt;&gt; Chocolate with brownies. &gt;&gt; Do you see how that works? Husbands and wives. &gt;&gt; It's putting them before yourself. Now, is that always the way it always works? No. Sometimes we can all be a little selfish, &gt;&gt; but we're trying. We're trying. We're trying to do what's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm in love with her. That's my bride. That's my wife. That's the one that I would give my life for. &gt;&gt; You would give your life for your wife, brother Ber. If somebody come at her, we would lay ourselves in front to protect them. We got to find a place to stop. These these just get these sermons just get longer and longer. Forgive us to the elect. God is calling the elect. They know it. Calling the virtuous bride, the word, the last day church, the elected lady of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is the word. How many believes that &gt;&gt; congregation says amen. All right. Then then the bride is always part of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Listen to that. The bride is always part of the bridegroom. So the bride will not be a denomination. &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ. He promised to do it. He said how he did it. He never loses his pattern. &gt;&gt; He always did it by a pattern. He done it every time by the pattern. He does it again. Calling out his virtuous bride in the last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting for her Isaac. Let's stand to our feet tonight. We've got more. We can We can just put it off. We can just wait. the lovely Rebecca waiting for her Isaac. Next time we'll get into the Ephesian church and Paul and how he was called in the ministry. But I want to try to get tonight to let you know that there is a pattern that has been followed from Moses. There was a tabernacle that Moses had to build. There was a pattern to follow. There was a tabernacle that that David was was called to set Solomon to build. There was a pattern to follow. There was a pattern in this last day to be followed to the stature of a perfect man that builds and builds and builds and builds. It's a pattern that we follow. The pattern says that he will restore the faith of the children back to that of the fathers. The original Bible faith is to be restored by the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; God had those stars in his hands. Restore. Restore my people. Restore my people back to what they know is true. Restore my people. Don't let them be shaken. Don't let them be moved. Restore them back to the word. He said, "Oh, how I love this. All the mysteries of the seals, the reformers, they never understood it fully. All the reformers, Wesley, Luther, Columbus, Martin, Ireneius, they never fully understood it. He said, "But now look at Malachi 4." He says, "You can just mark that one down. He's a prophet. He's a prophet. He's a prophet and he restores the original faith of the fathers. you love the Lord tonight. Amen. Let's just bow our heads if we could. Heavenly Father, we just come before you tonight with grateful hearts, Lord. Thankful, Lord, for what you've done in this hour. We're thankful, Lord, that you've just moved on the scene in our lives in the church here. That our faith is being restored back to that of the fathers, the original church. That we can stand upon the word of God tonight, knowing that it's a neverchanging, neverchanging word. That if someone was healed yesterday, I can be healed today. If salvation was good yesterday, salvation's good today. And he says it will stay that way and remain that way to the end of the ages. because we're following a pattern. We want our life to be so right, so in tune, so just what you want it to be so that you can dwell in this house. This vessel of clay should be so much more than a house, but we want it to be a home. A home where you can dwell, where you can live, where you can rest. Father, David said he wanted a place that he could rest the ark of the covenant. And Lord, we ask that you would rest your Holy Spirit in us tonight. Lord, we thank you for all you do for us and for all you've ministered to us in the last days and and in the last few services. We thank you for good reports that we've heard today. We positive testimonies of you moving in the scene, you moving on the lives of your people in this church and in this building. We ask a special prayer tonight on brother Glenn. We ask Lord that you would just move and give him strength. Grant grant him the energy. Help him to put back on his weight and and and be able to get his strength back. You're not finished with him yet. Lord, continue to bless him. Use him. Lord, the different ones that have a need in their life, in their body, we're still believing. We're still believing that you touch damaged lungs. We're still believing that you still heal cancer. We're still believing that you're a comforter to those who are in grief tonight [Music] because on this word we stand, Lord, when we've done all we know to do, stand upon the word. Stand up on your promises. Stand upon the very things that you said we could have in this hour through the power and the demonstration of the church of Pentecost. We love you, Lord. We just ask you continue to bless the church here. Bless each household that you would move in the scene in a special way. Make us men, real men of God. Give us strength. Give us the courage. Give us the boldness to be the head of the house and to love our wives the way you love the bride. Help us to speak to our our wives and our children the way you speak to your wife and your children. How you speak words of love and compassion and words of gift and giving. How you adore us. Oh Lord, we ought to be able to raise our hands and raise our voices and just tell you how much we adore you. But constantly from the very works of Calvary, you've poured out your love on us. And we thank you for it, Lord. We praise you. We lift your name on high. We worship you tonight with all within us, Lord. We thank you. We love you. In Jesus' name we pray. [Music] I won't be moved.
