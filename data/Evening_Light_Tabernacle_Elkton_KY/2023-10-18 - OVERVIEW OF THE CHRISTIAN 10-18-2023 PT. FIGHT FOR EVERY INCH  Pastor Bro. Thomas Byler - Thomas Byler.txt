want to continue our Series this evening amen and this is another another part that been wanting to speak on ever since I got started on it amen uh but Sunday of course you know that was kind of a highlight amen but this year uh tonight will actually help us to understand how that we uh can go in and possess the things that's ours is that all right how may like to know how to how to go about that amen because we know we find out that not easy amen amen as the prophet of God said if you want healing well it isn't going to come easy you're going to have to fight for it amen every promise every promise that's in the book amen over 800 something I guess it is amen a promises that are ours amen but we're going to have to fight for each and every one of them amen amen having listened amen out our system amen we look forward to being able to save enough money brother Brian and one of the first things we want to do is upgrade our system because it's terrible watching it on it's blurry you can't hear right positions hardly you know and so amen so maybe January or whenever amen we when they get the Internet fixed get if get us a faster internet we can be able to amen that we need all right amen we're fading out now aren't we amen fading out now praise the Lord all right well it'll be all right amen we can do it without I got a loud enough voice we can preach without us Mich if we have in there right amen so God bless you tonight amen let's go ahead and turn your bibles if you will Amen to Romans 8 and we'll kind of pick up where we left off would that be okay amen we'll just take amen and go as far as we can amen again this evening with the help of the Lord amen Romans 8 pray for Brother Brad he's going to take the service Sunday amen so we're looking forward to amen him preaching for us Sunday morning amen amen amen Romans chapter 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and if ye have not and ye have for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have to receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs hes of God joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen amen and we won't go into some of these other things amen that we could but um you know it says down in verse 23 not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body amen that's sounding better here amen all right praise the Lord Amen to with the Redemption of our body amen this evening we want to once again speak on Amen the Chris and I believe I uh called this amen um amen fighting for every inch fighting for every inch amen I like that you know I mean you talk about not just a mile but for every inch amen fighting for every inch now I read this here because amen we talked amen of course Sunday about how that we're heirs Heirs of God Amen and that everything that belongs to Christ belongs to us also a that right so every promise in the book Is Ours amen amen everything Paul said it all belongs to you is that right whether Life Death no matter what it is amen it's all yours amen and we like that because of Amen especially where it says that everything it's all ours you know and when we say well it's mine you know we are talking about us as the bride is't that right it's ours it's all belongs to God's Church God's people that he has redeemed amen that he's done a work of redemption in amen amen so I want to go into category and into Direction a little bit about once you become a son once once you are a son amen what God does with you after that amen isn't that right amen where you go from there and how heyen we're going to go about trying to uh am mean get some of these promises that God has had now you know because it's actually a process amen it's something you know just like just like it was with the children of Israel he said the land is yours let us go up and possess it go up and possess it a't that right amen and so we find out they would fight one battle after the other amen first the walls of Jericho then the children of AI I believe it was and then on and on and on from one battle to the other to the other to the other amen amen there was a process it was a process and as you think about that process you know uh I want to first of all talk about you know because we know that the word of God how many knows the word doesn't need uh doesn't need any uh Reformation not Reformation but um what do you want to call it restoration amen or bringing back I want to talk first a little bit with the help of the Lord about talking about how that things always evolve amen things evolve brother bam said when he he he talked about Evolution and he says I believe in evolution not in the way that man teaches it about you know going from one species to the other but he talked about you know when God begin to create things and the the pot as the calcium and be begin to brood over the Earth and how began with the jellyfish and and then he went to the frog or Tad pulled and on down and on up I mean until he become until he come all the way to humanity now he also explain serpent seed in there amen and me and talking about how that science and different ones have been digging and trying to find what they call the missing link is that right and but clearly tells us what that Missing Link was was that serpent that was the only link between the chimpanzee and Humanity that they lost that they just couldn't TI together amen because animal blood and so forth it won't mix with human blood but there was one animal one Beast amen that actually could that Beast was that serpent is that right now this Beast was the most sub the Beast that serpent was the most sub Beast amen of the field and it would actually mix and so you know we find out that they even and all of that that he was cursed down to be a snake amen so far that they can't never find it but he talked about the evolution of creation the next is of course the evolution of humanity amen evolving amen or or and I look what that evolving means talk about am me it means changing from one to another or progressing basically progression amen or change amen and we know that Humanity has evolved as far as knowledge is concerned isin't that right and then we went all the way from the horse and buggy Age and and so forth all the way up into the space age and we have certainly amen gone uh well we've gotten gotten tapped so much into the world of knowledge and and thank so much that we have the power to destroy the world many times over the prophet of God said to where there wouldn't even be one blade grass anywhere that's the evolution of mankind but I already also wrote in here but you know we've also devolved when it comes to morality and our mind and so forth boy we have really devolved amen even though we have evolved so to speak in science and knowledge and so forth Humanity as a whole brother bam says you know we go up so high and then they flip over amen mean it all it all has to do with uh in the cycle of death amen because you know and I'll tell you what you know I won't go down there but we know that man even Christians a lot of times he'll uh allow pride and different things you know to come in and then Pride always comes before a downfall we look at the church ages and look at the churches and the way that they have went especially the Pentecostals and the different ones you know they came up so far and they wouldn't go on they wouldn't keep evolving so to speak in God ain't that right amen but they become stagnant somewhere and they died right there they quit growing quit growing on but the bride of Christ amen we are amen so to speak evolving so to speak from what we are amen amen into something greater and greater and greater and greater amen so look here we see a nature now one one thing about brother bam says that nature itself amen you take the trees you take the birds and he says you know the birds they still make their nests the same way as they always did all of nature doesn't evolve they don't change you might say well you know a a a deer or an animal would get smarter and smarter you know they're limited I don't care how big a bucket is I don't care how smart the animal is they're limited and we can outsmart them at any time at any place amen why because we can check their nature and and study their nature and they have they're they're limited they they're just they got what God gave them amen and sure they may adjust they may do this that or the other but they go all to the limitations of what God has given like brother baham said though the birds man they still make their nest the same they do it year after year after year amen it's handed down their children their children their children their children their children you would think that they would get smarter and do it better and better and better and better but they don't humanity is the only one amen that does that that gets does better and greater and greater and greater and greater amen and it shows the prophet of God said that we have fallen from something we've come from a fallen State and we're driving back and then we're actually striving for Perfection we want to do it better get it you know do it better and so forth and and I don't know about you but I I I'm glad to live in the age that I live in amen it used to be you know we had a gravel parking lot out there right now it's nice to have payment is it right well we know that 6880 at one point in time it was money to go up and down 60 8080 and they drive horse and Buggies no doubt years ago amen up and down the road all they had flinging mud well now we get to oh my now we get to drive in nice fancy cars nice cars and cruise on I don't know about you but when I'm driving down that black top Road I'm says thank you Lord I can drive on this vehicle on Black Top Road you know I don't have to be out there amen I'm gonna I'm going to stop here for a minute and I want to give God a glory and testimony but me and my wife we was about this close and me to go to the hospital tonight I mean it's it's just God that we're here not in the hospital cuz we coming to church and and uh 106 out there where sometimes that water goes across the road you know that curve and and you go up that road well we was coming from the other side down and we was traveling 55 pretty much and we come around that curve and here a car was coming at us and she we all the way over in our lane and boy I slammed on brakes but we was going to hit each other head on and I just and there was a rock wall over on the right and a ditch and I I knew he was going to hit the rock wall or something I did not expect us to get out of it something was going to happen and I pulled over as far as I could not to hit him and I went into ditch and I knew it would hit axle and everything and probably just pull me in but the Lord help us there was just enough gravel there there was just enough gravel there God help us amen and we pulled all the way over they pulled over just far enough to give me my half of the ditch and it pulled back up and it pulled back out but it was very close to head on Amen so I thank the Lord amen how many believes that God watches out for us that's the closest to a wreck amen that I that I've been in a while amen amen I I know Jess been in a wck and amen and so I thought I might have to get me a new truck but anyway no I I did not think that we would come out of it without hitting the wall or something bad happened because that was a big ditch amen but by God's grace there was just enough gravel there to hold that thing and bring us back out and uh we tried to catch them to find out you know because I thought maybe there was some damage done in my truck because of it but they were long gone amen all right I figured it was probably texting or something amen all right praise the Lord so we think about it brothers and sisters I just I thank God Amen all right so now notice we talk about that the message amen talk about Christian and in Christianity next next thing that we look at as far as uh Evolution even Christianity has evolved hasn't it Christianity has evolved that's right Luther justification Wesley sanctification Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost isin that right m and isusa Street it looked like the real thing like the original Pentecost like and it was Pentecost I mean as it was the work of the Holy Ghost that all be a whole group of people there and then they come out of that Pentecostal system and so forth Pentecost amen that'll be saved they're laid away and they'll be over in glory but we know that they denominated just like the others did and that right am man denominated and they begin to say that speaking in tongues is the the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen and but says you know the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost made way for something isn't that right for the Holy Ghost himself I mean know so The Giver of all those gifts and Tong all of a sudden The Giver of those gifts shows up through Malachi 4 Ain that right the very one that gives them and he speaks to him begin to earn Des earn the thoughts of the heart and I think we had it here uh up here it says something about you know these things haven't been done for since Paul's age some of these things haven't been done till then and here God is again bringing the perfect how many not a perfect word for bride that's going to come to Perfection so it has evolved Christianity has evolved we have to evolve and let me say our Revelation and understanding of the word has evolved now I put it that way because I can't say that the word involved because that's not true the word never has to evolve it never has to change in other words we have such the word is so complete until he wrote in there if anybody adds to or takes away his heart will be taken out of the book of life even better B one play said that it was like having a complete body all five fingers and then you add something to it well you're going to have six fingers or six toes or two heads or something like that amen so you can't add to the word of God the go word of God does not need Evolution it don't need to progress it don't need to be the only thing that we need as Believers is to understand what that word really is cuz that word to butter bam says you know real genuine faith is an atomic bomb huh you don't need anything greater than atomic bomb it doesn't get any bigger butam says where was it I don't know which maybe might have been in the greatest battle ever fought he might have talked about you know a Gatlin gun or a muzzle loader or a pistol you know or a a person bringing a knife to a gunfight can you imagine last guy with I don't care if you got a machete if I got my glock 16 or 20 or whatever it is I'm not going to be worried about your machete unless you can throw it real good huh and that's how it is the devil's little old knife can never compare to God's word that real genuine faith if we can back get back our understanding to the word of God isin that right then we'll have the same it'll have the same effect that it always did amen and that's what we're working towards we're evolving I believe we're evolving so much until one of these days we're kind of let me just say this way brother bam said that there was rapturing faith in the message now I want to say something can I add a little something to that oh you got I got your attention now if there's rapturing faith in that message then there is rapturing preparation in that message ain't that right because if you're going to go in a Rapture you're going to have to be ready for that Rapture how many believes it's the clothing this this message is the dress that we're putting on we are putting these things on we're putting on faith putting on virtue putting on knowledge putting on Temperance putting on patience putting on God godl putting on brotherly kindness putting on the Holy Ghost and putting on perfect love ain't that right we got to have those things you got to be dressed we're dress we're getting dressed we are dressing to meet him and if there's rapturing Faith then there's also things in the message that's going to have you ready aren't you glad for that it's bringing us higher it's much higher than the age before us was and that is what God is working on now when you become the Son of God Amen so now notice here now he says if we're uh if if we're children then heirs Heirs of God and notice how the expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation I'm moving it down a little bit amen wait is for the manifestation of the sons of God the whole world is looking for the sons of God to be manifested amen let me just say this that I believe that the prophet of God said that there in the end time that there would be the Son of God there would be a sheath wave waved over the people is that right sheave wave waved over the people amen and what that sheave wave was is usually back in the old days in the uh in the Old Testament whenever or something like that would be coming to maturity they would take a sheath isn't that right amen it was fully matured and they'll bring it in and they'd wave it around say hey this is the first fruits that's come to maturity amen when I think about the prophet of God how I believe that amen if the whole world is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God a person to come to maturity tell me who who better exemplify that than the prophet of [Music] God and if he if he came to maturity what about the message said he preached what about his [Laughter] followers oh you're one of them brand followers you better believe it yeah D ain't ashamed a bit to tell you I'm a follower of a brother Brandon am mean no more than i' would have been ashamed when Paul said follow me as I follow Christ if I didn't in Paul day I said I'm a Paul follower I follow Paul because He follows Christ am that's right amen oh my so let's get started shall we now if you'll notice in Galatians we're going to take off now from the back back side of the desert you become a Son of God now you're an air everything belongs to you but there's a butt but yeah what in the world what why do we have to hear things like this brother blam says every promise in the book of The Great Shepherd is to his sheep but I didn't even realize that was in there but he said but but brother he will never come down and just drive it all away from you you got to fight for every inch of that promise but it's yours it belongs to you just like God he told Israel way down there in Egypt I've given you Palestine now he could have just went in there and run them all out of there with a plague kill them all off he could have went up there sent fear among them and drove them all out of the country he said Israel and it's yours you go get it but they had to fight for every inch of ground that they stood on how many knows it oh boy we're going to get a m in out of this one how many knows that a lot of times you gain ground but then you lose it we got a few backsliders here huh we got a few of them that know what it's like to be human know what it's like to be defeated once in a while and to know that he I'm going to have to come and I'm going have to reconquer this thing I'm going have to reclaim that [Applause] thing and sometimes many times oh yeah some sometimes many times you got to go and reclaim what you claim you got to you lose those inches of ground well I used to say Amen in church but I'm quiet now huh I used to Hallelujah praise God I used but now I've heard it before yeah yeah he's up there blabbering again huh well you are really backl that's your attitude you need a real good dose of for the Holy Ghost once again I like blabbering I like slobbering and spitting and yelling and screaming and I enjoy it Amen brother R says he likes an old horse eating Al Alpha if I slobber a little bit front row you might want to move back a seat I spit a lot but it's anointed spit be all right you be all right ah Jesus spit and brought it into Man's eyes a that right he got well so who knows what might happen if you got faith the preacher spits on you just claim your healing I'm Healed wouldn't be that far out the line that's a new one never know what the Holy Ghost gonna say do you all right you love the Lord amen God is good so we have to try to look at this but brother you have to fight amen he told Joshua every place the sole of your feet Treads that I have given you Footprints means Victory you know you've heard the phrase be careful what you ask for we're going to address that a little bit tonight if that's all right let's first of all look at something here that just because you're a son doesn't mean you're an heir whoa now that's different I mean if you're an adopted son yeah but you got to come to adoption don't worry I got it I got it right here notice in Galatians it says for ye are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free neither male nor female you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you are Christ then you are able Abraham's seed and hirs according to the promise now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all W so if you're going to be a Son of God and you're just going to stay a baby God will never be able to trust you with the checkbook you can't stay a spiritual baby right you've got to go through something things and you got to prove yourself a Son of God before God hands you that kind of authority you got to go through a process you got to evolve man you can't St in the same place you got to keep growing keep growing keep growing I'm going to challenge your faith tonight amen though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors till the time appointed of the father amen my praise the Lord all right now we're going to stop there and we're g to address this here in a minute let me just tell you brother Braham says now remember when a man is saved this much I don't know like this button here I don't have any buttons button here becomes eternal life in your heart that's God and as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a Son of God whoa how many knows it's about becoming a Son of God for whom he did predestinate them he them who he forew he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren how many believes that the Bible wants Sons and Daughters of God to be like him it just comes to mind remember God had wanted a family of his own church age book amen and now God will train them to be conformed to the image of his son sometimes he'll have to take that son and thoroughly break him down again huh if God don't if you oh my I don't want to say if God don't get it right the first time you'll do it again but if you're stubborn and you are you've got ways that God don't like he may have to put you on your back he may have to I don't know what all God is going to have to do but sometimes he has to completely break us down right completely take us back to The Potter's House we're gonna start this over again I don't know about you but we've all had probably another start a new start God I need another start I need a refreshing I need a refilling amen oh my that's right see a man was made to be a god did you know that he is in the image of God he's the son of God he's like him amen oh my here he is among the church today made flesh in this church certainly Elohim oh now if you could only realize that you men you were made to to be an amateur God you're a Son of God you're an heir of God you have a domain how many believe that oh my you have a been given the domain he's a king God and where he got his fall he could speak amen where he got his fall he could speak to the trees be changed be plucked up move over here the winds would obey be still and it stopped he's an amateur God a son of of God you're like your son the son of your father isn't that something we've had a person that could speak things into existence speak squirrels into existence speak to the storm stop speak to the bull and he'll go back and lay down amen can we say that isn't just meant for him that's meant for every Son of God every daughter of God if you are a child of God God has made you a small amateur God which is how many knows that God is a Creator is that right how many knows that you are a Creator you're AA your demeanor the atmosphere around you your smile or frown right gratitude you create all that amen that's right you created you're an amateur Creator but says people you like to be around some they create that atmosphere we're all meant to be creators well my wife she is so grumpy and snappy and everything else welcome to the wonderful world of being a creator it's time that you recreate the situation brother Brandon was in the kitchen the kids were screaming and she was crying and all of that and all laborsome and all everything else you don't have me supper ready honey you mean to tell me I got to make my own supper my own my own bloy sandwich is that how I did it no he got an apron and put it on and went over there and helped her with the dishes and yeah begin to tell her about a pretty dress that he saw down and whatever right amen and begin to get her mind off he created that atmosphere when we come to church folks we create the atmosphere you want to sit there like a bump on a love be like a frog huh or you want to amen praise the Lord come on now preach it brother don't quit yet go a little longer when do we yell stuff out like that I always get in trouble the preacher will be saying all right I'm going to close and I say praise the Lord I wish I would have said that or Glory that's not a good time to say Glory or praise the Lord I always get myself in trouble I'm like nobody heard that did they GL no don't say Glory at that time and say preach is more brother we're just getting started create an atmosphere how many believe that we're all creators people should love to be around you people should want to sit at your table I want to go sit by this guy I want to sit by this person person man they got such good things to say some positive things to say I might as well say it not so long ago I sat around some preachers sat down sat around some preachers man all we could talk about all all people begin to talk about is the questionable stuff and the things around the message I'm like I don't really want to go there huh I don't want to talk about all these other stuff let's talk about something positive let's say where the bride is going here see we talk about what the God is doing amen the Revival that's certain among God's people the work that the holy spirit is doing in our young people and our older people let our middleaged people talk about something positive not negative amen oh my praise is the Lord that's right so that's the beginning when you get born again you got about that much of God about that much wow that's not a whole lot sometime ago the critics said that God certainly made a mistake when he said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he but later they found out that God was right they said the man had no mental faculties in his heart and that perhaps God meant in his head but God doesn't make mistakes how many glad oh he don't make mistakes when he said his heart he meant his heart just like he does with all the other statements and they are perfect and they need no TR ations they're just the way God said them amen not another age not another time but whosoever with all times for God's word is perfect it's Everlasting Eternal as he is eternal how many believe that God's word am me this word is so perfect and when Luther could just get a revelation that the just shall live by faith I don't have to pay for this I don't have to pay for that there's no Indulgence and all of that other mess in here he got a revelation of it that's what we need more of I'm here to completely I'm here to tell you by the time we realize that we're the children of Abraham amen we've got the faith of Abraham he CAU those things as though that were not as though they were who again so believed and hoped that's right oh this bride is going to have the faith of Abraham we're going to call things that aren't as though they are how many believe that you got a body ch change coming I believe his body's going to change I don't care how it looks brother Glenn your hair is going to turn they're going to come back first and then they're going to turn back how many glad they're going to come back then they going to turn back we believe that with all of our heart it don't matter how much time goes by if you got the faith of Abraham that's how it's gonna be that's the kind of belief that you have amen why because God put something down in here let's finish our story so about four years ago up in Chicago I was reading a great headline in a paper where the Medical Science had found a little compartment in the heart of the human being that did did not even have a cell in it and it is not found in the animal life it's only found in the human body the human heart and they said it must must be the dwelling place of the Soul Glory how many believe that that's he got a soul down on the inside of the inside oh my so then man does think with his heart you look with your eyes but you understand with your heart see when God made man he made him thus he made him this little certain compartment in the man for his own Throne his control tower wants to lead man and I want to finish with that tonight about 12:30 oh my that's right listen he wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself so God put that in there for a contr how many believe you got a control tower I'm thankful for that control tower praise the lord we don't want to get too much into that but that's just kind of to lay out a little bit something amen praise the Lord you know man hasn't changed very much he's still wondering about in the world seeking pleasure Restless Never Satisfied never coming to any kind of conclusions never finding rest he's just about the same condition that he was when he left God In the Garden of Eden and went out to shift for himself he's been shifting ever since and he finds that way to go how many believe that before you were born again it was a rough way to go amen out there it's a rough way to go it's so rough many put a gun to their head how many know that the solution to the Palestinian problem you know they all get on these news and say h what's the problem what's the news and some of them say hey kill as many as you possibly can and make it realize hey they going to pay the price reckon that's the solution no but everybody the people are selfish is what it is they've got no love in their hearts not appreciation for what they have what they need is God they need the Holy Ghost that's the solution amen all right but listen he's got a rough way to go I notice he says man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself man was made to rely completely on God that's the reason we're likened unto sheeps a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us amen praise the Lord the holy spirit is here and supposed to lead us now let's go for a little bit I'm talking about how to possess these things that brother baham said that you've got to fight every inch of ground to possess I've gotten to the place to where I like when the preacher when he says look you got to fight for every inch well try to describe a little bit what that's all about amen amen what does that mean well first of all we realize that we have every promise brother Bram says every promise in that book belongs to you but you got to fight and the way that you fight is God allows trials to come your way ain't that right he puts tests on you and tries you and and he gets things out of your life as you're able to get rid of things he can come in cuz I don't want God just in my heart just just a TI of a thumbnail how many would say tonight I want God to fill every fiber of my body I mean my toe down at the end of my toe I want him into every little hair I got I want him in every part of me I want him to oh I just want him I want to be so full of God until he oozes out until my cup runs over how many believe you can be there you can do it but he takes a committ to almighty God have to accept the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and allow him to work on you to work on me amen amen see tutors and governors to find out how you're doing amen now notice better bam says now there's where the Pentecostal Church failed when they became so Sons they settle down and said well can we say to the message well I'm a message believer but yet you got all this stuff in your life that shouldn't be there didn't the prophet of God of a perfect man and God can't never really fully use you until you have all of these things in you do you realize those things are the great and precious Promises of God the fruit of the spirit those are the great and precious Promises of God that's rightfully yours amen they're rightfully yours amen notice let's go to uh Galati well I'm going to skip some of this let's go to Hebrews [Applause] 12 Hebrews 12 verse 7 says if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons now how many know that that Jo that that tutor that brother B talked about the Bible talks that we're under tutors anden he's watching what you do he's supposed to teach you things and brother says that's the Holy Ghost amen that's teaching us things correcting us chastising us as many as I love I rebuke and Chason my no in now if you endure chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is he whom his father chasteneth not amen amen this is where I've wanted to go since the beginning of this series talking about how that God works on his children would it be okay brother John to say that any imperfections in our life God's got his eye on it sometimes we get to a place where we don't we we come so far and we stop we don't overcome this God can't take us any further until we deal with that right sometimes we battle with things battle with things battle with things battle with things hello it throws us down we get back up throws us down we get back up we're like the children of Israel sometimes it takes a long time to overcome it to conquer it to possess something that the enemy has and you wanted amen now notice that's right who what father what son comes to God that doesn't get chastisement gets correction gets training but if ye be without whereof all our partakers and are ye basers and not Sons now notice so the Pentecostal set it down and said this is it we've got our church we've got our denomination we'll just keep adding on adding more no that isn't it listen we'll build a better building that's good add more to the church that's good but God made you a son to give you a trial to see how you're going to act with it amen remember brother says we pray for this that or the other and the best thing God can give us is a trial didn't Paul say you know if we suffer with him we'll also Reign after telling us that we're an heir and so forth he says we're going to suffer with him how did how did Jesus come to Perfection according Bible says he through sufferings he became perfect how many knows that our trials and our tests they mean more to us than what we realize brother B didn't just say that for anyhow I'm going to go ahead and go to the next one let's go to James no not James Peter First Peter 1 he says to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaven is through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ James says it this way chapter one one page back or so in your Bible my brethren chapter 1 verse two my brethren count it all all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations I was studying today and brother Bram comes across he says you know when the devil really really really tempts you at something and you just pass it on by he says oh it feels so sweet doesn't it just feel so sweet when Temptation come you just pass it on by amen and you feel like Samson did amen when he killed that Lion and the honeybees made a big old honey n and he come back and he sat down and enjoyed some good oldfashioned victory honey out of the lion that's the way the believer is counted all joy oh we're just getting s listen we ask we might say you better better uh uh uh be careful what you ask for but I want a restatement don't be careful what you ask for because if you want the promises you won't get him any other way than claim it and believe it a chicken be careful what you ask for huh if you're a chicken then just be careful what you ask for you might you might not be able to handle what's coming because it's the truth now how many knows one of the one of the fruit of the spirits is patience that's right is that right Paul said tribulation work with patience oh you got to fight through tribulation you got to fight through hard things to get patience you got to fight just to have faith brother Tommy knows different one know you got to doubt your doubts no I refuse to believe that I'm oh I don't think I can I'm huh oh I don't believe I can be healed doubt that oh I doubt that I believe I can be healed doubt your doubt you got to fight for every inch there's a battle that comes with it God allows to get you in a battle to give you what you have want and what you desire how many believe that so why would James say this count it all joy knowing this that the trying of your Faith woo the trying of your faith Peter said it's more precious than gold when you get tried no wonder the public can say man God give you the best thing you good get put a trial on you put a test on you folks if I go to the Dodge stealership and he's got a Dodge R and they'll tell you what the front wheels will come up off of this thing anden when I get out on the road I want to be able to trumpet and I want the FR Wheels to come off that thing huh I don't want to go out there the next neighbor man the old lady and the little little whatever Nissan whatever I don't I not Nissan but some neon passes me up I'm gonna go back and say I'm going to heavy or Ford but I think a Dodge has a good vehicle brother Steve be all right amen think about it when there's if you're a Christian you say you're a Christian you're a Christian God's gonna put you to to test to see if you are you want Faith I'll give you faith I just got to go to this scripture oh my being justified by faith we have peace with God through the Lord Jesus CHR Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we also glory in tribulations brother Paul did didn't he in Tribulation that knowing and I didn't even realized this was in here like this but knowing that tribulation worketh patience there he says it with James oh my and patience experience experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed the end is that you are not ashamed to take to the world I want you to know if you can't get over it if you can't get under if you can't go around it completely commit yourself which by said with the most powerful weapon the church is personal is a complete commitment to God Amen and watch God take you through let the leadership of the Holy Ghost so satate you I want you to know tonight I believe that we got to come to the place that the prophet of God was amen that he had such a voice on the inside he followed the holy spirit in such a way that he isn't the one that spoke to the bull he wasn't the one that spoke to the storm it was God said you speak first God told him to do it it wasn't him doing it in himself let me tell you something if you want to come to adoption if you want to come to the place of power of God don't do anything in yourself huh if God don't do it don't do it God don't say it don't say it but say the bride has th sayth the Lord or she keep still wait for God to do it how many wants to be at that place CU you got to come to a certain place that God can trust you amen I don't know where I put him that's why I keep a spare you love the Lord now that child in the Old Testament he never had any inheritance why the father couldn't trust him in any with anything what kind of fellow he would be but he couldn't trust him he's always a son but he didn't have any inheritance and if you don't watch Pentecostal church that's going to be our lot inheritance huh Pentecostal thought hey this is it we got here you know what he said hey we're settled down we this is said we got it no now it's time now you got the baptism the ho now you're Son of God now it comes time to train you it comes time for you to go and begin to get take possessions of these things amen it's time for you to start acting like a man oh my have some love some brotherly kindness but the Pentecostals didn't have any love didn't have any love that's right one thought that he was coming on the cloud the other thought he was coming on a horse and they started the different Church split churches come on folks about like message people well seven seal is open the other is not sealed it's not a split churches now I'm starting to go down this road and I'm going to go for a little bit is that okay can I have a little extra time one of the first things that you want to possess is the fruit of spirit is been and that is love how many believe we want love how many wants love oh I want the love of God well like they say careful what you ask how are you going to get any love until you over hate first people got to do you so wrong until you oh maybe hate hate hate until you get so tired of it you say I'm tired of this huh that's exactly don't we all we've all we've all got that way stayed up at night oh man I hate that guy until you can get down on your knees I need the love of God I need joy in my life oh you're miserable that way if you want the promise of joy in your life you realize you got to have forgiveness in your heart that's right you got to forgive cuz you won't never be justified in the sight of God until you have yours forgiven and Jesus said if you don't forgive other their trespasses neither will you father forgive you of your trespasses you got to be forgiven if you're going to have joy and when you get that true joy and you have that battle and you overcome all those thoughts and all those feelings then you have joy that's right people say this about you calls you Bells you bu call you this that or the other I read today where brother says man somebody will do something wrong to you or whatever and you want to tell them back he says go ahead if you tell them back he says you're fighting your own fight and God can't fight your fight for you you're fighting your own battle I'll tell that person go ahead huh how believe you got to follow the follow the principles this is where this fight that we're talking about every inch of ground that you gain every possession of every promise that you get you're going to have to fight for it in other words if you you wouldn't have to fight whether any of you wasn't in the battle that's right so if you got to fight that means you're in a battle you're in a trial you're in a test a't that right first thing God did when he brought the children of Israel out is put them under test put them in a battle Amen to see what they would do he wanted them to have faith so he made a situation arise to where they couldn't go across and the and the Egyptians were coming and the dust was flying and the horses and man I can only M I can only imagine the sound of those chariots and those Egyptian W we're coming for you every last hundred all of them W they were sacked up we're gonna go and we gonna bring them back they heard them for Miles screaming and all oh boy they're psyched up they gonna get us all but real Faith oh they said what do we do we're going to do we Joshua says blah blah blah blah Joshua and Caleb didn't scare them a bit it's all bunch of Racket bunch of noise God brought us out here get have some faith I don't care if there's a lake in front of us I don't care if we can't go backwards I can't go sideways can't go forward God puts you in places you don't know where to go just to make sure that you actually have faith so that you can say like Paul you know the tribulation worth patience amen the trial of your faith let Faith let patience have her perfect work isn't that right that you may be being tired and wanting nothing how about long suffering I'm in this long suffering W that's nice well that's wonderful but guess what the only way you'll get longsuffering if you have a battle that is long that person just won't quit doing that this trouble just won't stop you can just lose it or you can say god'll take me through right I take give me long suffering I think brother Brandon when he was preaching on long suffering he says brother here at the Tabernacle I've been preaching amen now no short hair and no women no this that no makeup and they still doing it patience and long suffering after 30 years patient a lot of time people say oh this is wrong in the church do something about it just be patient take it slow take it easyy get the ho Holy Spirit a chance woman following Paul for days Ain that right and he didn't he rebuke her until God said rebuke her amen always the right time patience longsuffering gentleness meekness Temperance I need Temperance guess what you gonna get some heat because heat is what temper steel isn't that right I like Temperance harden steel it's right there it's tempered it's went through the fire if you want to be there folks sometimes you got to go after trial after Tri a lot of times you find these an old folks they just don't get R too quick they don't get flustered too quick huh they don't get rattled they're tempered huh you know think about Erica brother Bill bil Paul Rebecca his sister dying of cancer Ron Spencer we're praying and believing but how many knows I don't care if last one of them dies that is not going to shake my faith that God Is A Healer Billy Paul dies well where's the shark I don't care where the sharks are I know God's Prophet was a God's Prophet don't even come with all that huh doesn't shake my faith God is still a Healer doesn't matter how many brother B says I don't care if I pray for 500 they all die I don't want to any of them to die you understand that but I'm saying just because people die doesn't mean that God is Not A Healer God has a purpose in it folks if I brother if I pray for something and believe for something and ask God for something and God still does the opposite I say thank you Lord because I don't care who you are right even Jesus himself had to pray I'd like have it this way but not my will father let thy will be done amen he doesn't always tell us what his will is as a matter of fact a lot of time we don't understand what in the world this is all about [Applause] why huh amen but if you want joy you got to fight for it if you want meekness well guess what God's going to have to really humble you maybe where you become Meek you're not a big shot pride and all of that other stuff you know no you're to realize you ain't no good nothing ain't nothing no good about you you get lifted up in Pride and everything else and you don't have no meekness and you want meekness God has to knock you down sometimes to bring you to meekness all these things how many understands where I'm coming from all these things amen they're all the precious Promises of God Amen uh second Peter said amen Wherever by are given unto us great and precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature amen precious promise the divine nature Amen to have faith you got to overcome doubt to have strength and virtue oh my you got to come overcome that selfish flesh have some knowledge have some Temperance and patience and godlikeness oh my godliness all those things you have to fight for it because we have more road rage than we have God likeness man tonight when I turned around after a terrible experience turned around flored I was going to catch that person cuz my truck and I figured hey you know after all of that it's probably damaged I'd like like at least talk to him my honey my says you okay I says I'm not mad I'm not upset i' just like to talk to him I wish they'd stop you know but ran me into a cliff wall and they take off I reckon I would too if I was drinking beer I probably wouldn't have any different than there if I have been the CER and so forth hello but no didn't get upset it wasn't mad Amen Let Me pleas you got to be self-control tempered self-control amen control yourself amen I'm going to close tonight and that is I truly believe that the secret of is is that that Holy Spirit has to be leading you we need him to guide us to lead us he brings the battle we don't ask for trials we don't ask for tests we ask for the promises and he knows how to bring them to us and if I ask for patience and longsuffering and he whatever he has to do to bring me that I say Lord bring it that's what we need because guess what you know what this is this here that we're talking about these precious promises that Peter talked about it's the divine nature of almighty God now I don't know about you but that's what everybody in here needs it's the divine nature of God he brother said you know uh in second Peter there the trial of your faith more precious of gold and he was talking about the church and how that God has to beat all that draw out until sees his own reflection amen that's what God is looking for every one of us tonight at evening light Tabernacle both here and out there listen God is looking for his reflection in you this was the challenge that I thought about it brother Bram talked about he says you know that God just doesn't give this inheritance God do just given the rights of the checkbook just to anybody is that right he he talked about the Old Testament how we would have a place of adoption just how that all works I don't know but I know that You' got to have the character that the father is looking for before your word is good before God honors your word amen you've got to be lined up with God amen amen you love him this evening do amen amen I do too and I think by the help of the Lord what we really desire and what we really want is the leadership of the Holy Ghost in our hearts in our lives amen amen closing with this the challenge that boy listen when that tutor came back now listen the Brethren sitting here if that boy was a good good boy there come a certain day a certain day till that there was a ceremony held for that boy that boy was taken out in the Public Square and was put on a certain Royal robe and they performed the father did performed the performance of adoption and adopted his own son that had been born now when you receive the Holy Ghost that's one thing you're born but now for the ceremony of adoption then he adopted this boy into his family and they had not notice if they'd write checks anything that boy did it was just as good the name just as good on a check as his fathers after that adoption amen he was air after the adoption well that's where the church needs to be tonight it needs to be to a place that God can call you off somewhere and throw his glory over you spread his power upon you adopt you and place you glory into the body where when you speak something happens how many wants to be in that place when brother brandom spoke there were squirrels created the storm stopped how many beli if that was our example we had a son that came to manifest the whole G creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God not Son of God but sons of God how about you tonight how many beli that I'm groaning for that that's what the church is needing tonight but if our character goes down instead of going up how's he going to do it we've got to continue to believe every work of God seek after righteousness do that which is right in the S side of God daily calling on him daily about his work getting others to come into church trying to get somebody to come to serve the Lord all the people you work for the Milkman the postman remember this was 1960 I believe it the Iceman and whoever it is all you come in contact with speak with them about the Lord speak it with seasonable words sweetly don't jump into them huh just speak it with sweetness and they'll say say that lady's a real lady she spoke to me about the Lord that man I've never seen such a man he says the nicest man I've ever met you know I'd like to have his religion how many wants to be that way praise the Lord let's stand this evening how many glad that the holy spirit is here how many believe that the holy spirit is leading and guiding us amen I certainly thank the Lord for his leadership amen even with these this series that the Lord has given me amen I believe because I've prayed I've prayed I think it was several weeks ago I said Lord feed your sheep you know because he said Peter feed the sheep well Jesus has a real interest in his sheep getting fed how many believe Jesus cares that you get fed and so thank you for praying for me that I can get out of the way that God could lay on my heart what to say amen I tell you what I have a good time I have a good time studying these things amen it is that's good to me to know to give me understanding because I hear preacher prayer I gota fight for every Ed that's wonderful but now how do I fight what do I fight what am I fighting for what are the promises of God I think we got just a little touch of it tonight amen love joy peace longsuffering gentle meekness patience the divine nature of God am mean def ain't going to give you that easy and God is going to make sure that you get it and the only way he'll get to make sure that you get it amen is to bring something the opposite to you amen if you want jooy sometimes bad sad things have to happen amen so through it all you can have the joy of the Lord knowing that you're Anchored In Jesus experience how many lik I like that word experience experience brings hope you know David he didn't say well Saul I'll tell you what I never did nothing I ain't never killed nothing but a frog and a toad and a apum out there but I believe I can kill that giant no he had experience back there and he says it ain't nothing because of my experience he knew what God could do how many believes that when you God brings you through things and you overcome this and you went through this battle and now you're a word you are how many knows that we all are what we are tonight because of the things that we've went through we have been molded and shaped because of the things that we went through now the challenge to that the Holy Spirit keeps bringing it back to mind the challenge is this are you at the place where God can adopt you and give you that kind of Authority or do you still have a lot of room to grow huh isn't that challenging to think that hey are you at that place God adopted you that he's given you that Authority or have we still got like brother bam says our is our character going down or is our character coming up because how many knows that when we leave when we leave this world the only thing you take with you is your character your character is your nature and the things that you have become because of Trials and things God has led you to go through amen because you are a son it's not all just fancy and uh flowery bed of ease and brother B says it's a picnic with cookies we're not here with picnic and cookies me we're here in a battlefield Amen to battle for those things you got to battle to come to church on Wednesday night you got a battle to pray you got a battle to all of these things it takes a battle you got to overcome amen how many knows in that other place brother B says we're just so used to having everything given to us I hate to keep you but can I just say one more thing you know how many knows that even after the Thousand Years there's another battle that happens in that Gog and Magog there's a battle that happens even at the end of that when all the devil and his host comes up and encamps the Saints how many believes that you and I are going to have enough experience we're not because it says that he goes to deceive
