========================================

The scriptures are just full of the stories of restorative power and and his his relentless love. And we see it in the lives of individuals as as God begins to deal with individuals throughout the scriptures. And he he deals with individuals from the beginning all the way to the end. And even now where we live, he's dealing with individuals that are broken, that are hurt, that have been damaged. How many's ever thought, I'm nothing but damaged goods? Sure we have. But God deals with those people and he puts his love. He tenderly puts those people back together. He doesn't leave his people in shambles. God's not going to leave you brokenhearted. He's not going to leave you distressed. He's not going to leave you out wandering around in the wilderness if you're one of his. So when God begins to deal with you, when God begins to pull on your heart and tug at your heartstrings, it's because he's tenderly trying to pull you back into the fold and say, "Come, my child. Come, my child. Get close to me. Get warm by me.
