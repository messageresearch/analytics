tonight amen trust you're having a wonderful week so far amen certainly enjoy that song amen about we have no less days to sing god's praise and when we first begun i think amen some of y'all here remember gene and claudia bernay and brother gene i guess passed away so i remember going to church with him down in dixon years years ago amen and so but he lived to be i think around 85 they said so that's getting to live a good long life amen and so we can't stay here forever can we but nothing here is eternal so we certainly look for a place that is amen and certainly it's going to be wonderful amen to be able to experience it so god bless you tonight um oh you can be seated for a minute amen about forgot about aaron he had a testimony he wanted to give tonight so come on him up brother aaron you mean i you know the devil's certainly been giving this brother a hard way to go so i mean anytime he's got a victory it's always a wonderful thing amen so god bless you man yes let me give you this one here oh um i was going through a really hard struggle in my life you know and i was talking to her brother and you know he just said you know that's just one thing you gotta you just gotta stop doing it so you know it's really hard for me to overcome it because you know at that time satan was just pulling so hard you know uh you know it's like a you know brother was preaching sunday insane about the death walk i feel like that's what i was doing because in a way i was i started there and you know i tried to i tried to do it on my own which didn't work and i figured that out the hard way because i kept and i kept going around in a circle and i ended up running the same spot where i was before you know i felt like there was just no way of getting out of you know and eventually i got to a point where i felt like leaving the message and you know killing myself because you know i got so down and depressed you know because i couldn't overcome this and you know but um i kept trying and trying trying and you know i kept failing but you know the more i want to pray you know i started getting a little bit better you know i started running a few more victories in my life you know i got a few victories and but i still failed every now and then but you know and then the lord you know that's when you know that song uh the lord will be there right on time you know that's when god really stepped in you know just took it away from me so and you know now standing here today i have no desire to do it whatsoever you know it's just completely out of my heart i wouldn't do it for anything you know and i just want to say thank the lord for helping me to overcome you know that's one of the probably one of the strongest now that he has the hardest battle i've ever ever came you know so but i couldn't have done it without the lord you know so i mean i just thank the lord for stepping in and what he did you know you know i remember the message that brother bailey preached about miracles you know that was a real miracle for me and you know i kept talking about it so many times you know at one point i felt like me and brother brother obama wasn't more friends no more because you know i got but i texted him he said he was so that was what a relief but uh but you know other than that i'm just really thankful that the lord stepped in and helped me overcome it because there was no way i could have done it without without them so so that's just my testimony [Applause] or doesn't it amen all right stand with me if you will imminence power heads lord jesus we come before you father we do thank you lord jesus for the strength lord that you've given brother aaron lord to be able to overcome lord knowing god that this is age of great temptation great tests and great trials lord and father satan would like to sift all of our young people with the enticements of the world but lord jesus we believe god that your children you'll take them through lord and we thank you lord jesus for giving him the strength lord jesus to be able to overcome and father tonight we ask lord jesus you just come in a special way speak to us along the way father and have your way in each and every one of our lives lord we want to give you the honor and the glory the praise for everything lord jesus for we know that without you we could do nothing father and lord would just ask god that this little thought i feel like you've laid upon my heart to speak god we just ask god that you'd say what you once said lord have you both with the speaker and with the ears of the hear you know the condition of every heart you know what everybody has need of lord jesus and we know that you can speak right to our hearts and our lives lord bless the reading of the word meditation of our hearts for those that can't be out tonight we ask god you're blessing upon each one lord wherever they are we ask god you just be with them in a special way at this time lord and as we turn our minds and our thoughts towards you now we ask god that you'd help us to lay outside every thought and everything that is unlike you lord and any spirit any attitude god we just bring it by your in your name under the control of the holy spirit father we love you lord and we commit this service to you now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen tonight i want to speak on with the help of the lord speak on god our deliverer god our deliverer amen so i just perhaps just trying to find the mind of the lord and see what the lord would have me to say which direction he'd want me to go and so this thought came on my heart and so if you will turn your bibles to first samuel first samuel god our deliverer amen praise the lord amen i andrew didn't know i was going to speak this and so forth not andrew aaron aaron uh but that certainly goes along with his testimony tonight so first samuel the 17th chapter and we'll read verse 31 through 37 and then also verse 41 through 49 and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose up against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him and thy servants slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing that he hath defied the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and saul said unto david go the lord be with you now verse 41 and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that beared a shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair continence and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh and to the fowls of the air to the beasts of the field then said david to the philistine thou camest to me with a sword and with a spear and with his shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand amen and i will smite thee and take the head from thee and i give i will give the carcasses of the hosts of the philistine this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth and that the earth may know that there is a god in israel and all the assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's he will give you into our hands amen we got in his blessings reading the words you can be seated when i thought about deliverance god being our deliverer i thought about david amen and you know we might say so much not only of david but we could talk about so many about uh jehoshaphat we could talk about let me see gideon and different ones that we want to talk about but david here beginning you know i really like david because you know i cannot imagine uh and you can't imagine actually what david did there with that lion in that right he took it when he when he took the lamb back it says the bear attack him and when he attacked him he grabbed him by the mouth and killed him by his beard anybody here can imagine grabbing the blind by the beard killing him i don't i that'd be quite exciting to be old i'd be out behind the trying tree just look and go david go go do it david i know you can right oh my i could just picture this uh you know but the thing of it is here i love this this is one of the greatest stories i guess but david here uh you know when he came to when he rehearsed the story to saul you know because saul says no man no you cannot do it huh you can't do it you know man might say no you can't do it am i on it and then uh david you know he was he wasn't afraid but when david he realized he says you know you can tell us all you might not think i can do it but i have done i'm killing him but that's not like this guy here this guy here has the five nine things of the living god so he's got he is you know much greater than what they have enough for for saul to say all right [Applause] [Music] there was not much to do all right there was not much today because david's faith and david's relationship with god the one thing that i really got to me and i thought this is so awesome is that that david was telling saul when he was telling the story he said he said david said more over and he's in the great custom on the old david he's never bragged on himself he didn't have any pride he put the flame and to give him the credit for exactly where it was supposed to be all right try that all right all right now where was i all right thank you very much yeah so david here properly placing the credit of where it really comes from and when i think about this you know because you know we we got to realize like jesus says you know really without me you can do how much you can't do anything without god david realized that it wasn't him he says look the lord that delivered me oh yeah how many knows you're going to face and you go facing the lion you're going to need some deliverance you're going to need some help you need somebody to help you to deliver you from the mouth of the lion and from the part of the bear i don't know if it's all poured a bear uh listen yeah there it is right there i was almost there the lord that delivered me out of the you know it's the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear all right so it's both paws because we all know that the pause is enough to take care of you am i right so the god that delivered me from the land delivered me from the bear he will also be my protection he will also deliver me he'll save me because that's what it's going to take because i could never do it in myself oh when we get to that place folks and you realize you can't do anything in yourself that's when you're ready to let god come into your life and have his way amen god has to bring you to the place where you realize you can't do it because god brings us into this world amen in the condition that we're in into sin born and sent shape and iniquity we come into a pit and we couldn't help ourselves more than anything there was no way for us to help ourself you can't save yourself you can't you can't even redeem yourself you can't do nothing you're helpless you have to have god to help you and david realized this he was nothing without him he realized that without him i could do nothing long before the new testament ever come along he realized that without god i can do nothing i'm going to be the lion's dinner i'm going to be the bear's dinner if god don't deliver me amen and he had that testimony he come in front of the philistine the philistine disdained him and he was humiliated he says i want you to bring me a man that i can fight that i can do battle with bring me a man worthy because this little shrimp he ain't even fit i don't want to kill that poor little thing i don't want to look bad if i kill that little thing anybody can kill that little thing huh am i a dog that you bring me this little child out here i'm much greater than this give me some competition here and he looked at david and he said i'm going to feed your flesh and the fowls in the air and to the beasts in the field and i'm going to do this that or the other and this is one time that david was in quiet huh david wasn't quiet and david answered him back all right good job speak let me say my peace here david said to the fellows saying you come to me with a spear and a sword in other words this guy had to have somebody carry his shield it was so big isn't that right and it was a great big sword now according to the prophet of god his sword was 14 foot long i believe it was 14 foot you know how long the sword that is i'd like to make a sword and you can just imagine that thing swinging around you wouldn't want to be anywhere around you know how many heads it would roll in one good swing out of that giant 14 inches fingers 14 inch fingers about that long scary-looking monster is what he was he was a scary ugly monster because the bible says even david was fair looking he was kind of a pretty boy maybe this guy was rugged meaning scars and you know he was a real animal what would we learn from here what we learned from this is one thing and that is that uh you know this guy one thing that saul said he says you know you can't do it because you are but a youth you are maybe 22 years old huh maybe david was 22 24 just a young little lad huh we think that's all grown up but now when you're about 60 that's just you know young yet right but just a little just young and you've got no experience you don't never you have never hardly done any bible other than maybe the couple of a lion and a bear you are inexperienced and this guy he has been a warrior slinging that old sphere and shield and training and many battles and he's a veteran [Music] how many knows the devil has been around 6 000 years he's a veteran he can't beat the devil ain't no way for you to beat the devil huh he's been around practicing this for six thousand years how old are you you know i'm 58 years old that's just a cool short little lifespan that's just a youth just the youth compared to the experience of the devil amen how many knows ain't none of us a match for the devil not by ourselves there is no way you can defeat the devil by yourself you might try and try and try and try but you can't do it but listen when the holy ghost comes amen and that makes the difference the difference is when the holy spirit when god is behind you amen even paul said man if god before us who can be against us i want to say that to each and every christian light if you've got the holy ghost amen if you've got god with you you ain't got to be worried about the devil that is old and asian and it very well experienced six six thousand years of experience doesn't matter you can still take his head off take his head off amen so david here he give the lord the credit now notice i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel i'm coming to you with god even brother brown says when you pray for something present your token god may not answer you unless you present your token isn't that right amen god bring god on the scene i come to you amen with the god of the armies of israel whom thou has defied this day i'm gonna show everybody how great i am you said what he said i'm gonna be a hero after today i want to be a big shot no he says this day will the lord deliver you into my hand amen he didn't say i'm gonna take it out god's gonna take you down and i believe even the prophet said it didn't matter which way that stone went it was going to find its mark folks he might have had a little he might have been a good sling thrower i mean a stone throw he might have been good because well i'll tell you from what i understand them old testament folks they slung each other to kill each other with slings and stones and they could they bragged about how that you could perhaps take the cap off of a coke can at 50 yards there what wow that guy can flex sling a stone yeah even to brag the bible brag of how they could sling and so far and how they could take a little and how accurate they were but what if that catch is wrong one time it just goes off man it's going to go palm over there hello but it didn't matter did what david was not relying upon himself come on people i'm not relying on myself i need god oh my that's right so he got that he says today god is going to deliver you into my hand they both prophesied they both spoke of what's gonna happen in the future is that right oh my and i love this picture i gotta i wasn't gonna read it but i will is that all right so he says this is gonna happen and i will smite thee not only will i smite thee but today i'm gonna take your head off back in the old testament they killed each other they'd cut each other off with the head right and put you on a spike that's right it was cruel it was rough you know but that's what they do huh smite being take thy head from the and i will give the carcasses of the hosts of the philistines all them folks back there behind you the birds are going to eat good tonight i love the the wolves look you're going to eat good tonight that's right because i'm gonna feed all y'alls flesh to the fowls of the air and to the beasts in the field it's gonna happen today folks i don't know about you but i can't help but believe that there was just some kind of a fear that happened to strike into that philistine tower oh my word i'm in trouble because i know all the past history of these guys and if their god actually sends a little guy out like this something just might happen huh all right this day the fowls of the air to the wild beasts of the earth and all the earth may know that there is a god in israel [Laughter] doesn't feel good after a victory folks i'm telling you half the time the reason that we don't got no more shouting and praising god is because we ain't got enough victories huh because i guarantee you you struggle over something you battle over something you don't know if you're ever going to make it over something and then you make it through that and you know it was god it just does something to you amen it's not called agony of victory no it's called the thrill of victory the agony of defeat i mean there's always ag of defeat is always agony but victory causes what do people do like they did with miriam amen cause is dead shouting praising god that's right that there is a god in heaven i like that and all this assembly will know that there is a god in heaven that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's he will give you into our hand oh how sweet it is when you're fighting something is struggling and battling with something you can't overcome it but when god comes on the scene it just vanishes away it is the sweetest victory in the world when the god fights your battle for you it don't matter what it is how many knows we have many battles in our life many different things that we battle but when god comes in there and he beats and defeats it for you what a glorious thing it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nye to david to meet david david hasted and ran towards the army to meet the philistine and david put his hand in his bag took fancy stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead all right now from my interpretation of this is it didn't stick halfway out sunk into it says all the way in i don't know about you but i can't think when i got a zone in my brain and i guarantee you the glass couldn't either that's right it sunk into his forehead how many knows it shows if you ever see pictures of it it talks about the brass helmet and for some reason they left a gap right there there's a gap right there in the helmet hello it was called the double twist spiral all right the double twist spiral is where it was it's there straight up and down bam that's what it was it hit him right in there it wasn't sideways where it cleaned off it was probably up and down huh i can't but imagine that angel got a hold of that stone and that is all over folks this is a good part that ain't the bad part yet let's listen to this i love it all right the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell not backwards but upon his face to the earth hello straight down you talk about a face plant goliath experienced a real face plant dust i can see the dust just flying up and david didn't have a sword of his own he says so he goes up there the saul i mean does not saul but to the goliath pulls out that big sword comes over here and everybody watching look what he's doing cutting his head up like he said grabs him by the head and probably had to have both hands for that big old head and pull it up shove it up there blood all right i mean imagine he was bleeding a little bit right and then can you hear turn it around and show all the israelites in their little dog holes in their trenches they come up out of them trenches if david can do that they got courage like you ain't never seen before let me tell you when one of us overcomes when one of us gets victory over the devil they ought to give the rest of us know to know that hey we can overcome these devils we can overcome these things that's bothering us you can do it amen but you got to have god to help you to do it amen praise god be to god and so david prevailed over the philistines with a sling and a stone and smoked the philistine and slew him and they said there was no sword so he ran he took and he cut off his head and they chased them to the other parts amen and they defeated him all day long just like he had said let's go to another character gideon how many knows that the book of judges in the book of judges there was many many different men that god used to be deliverers amen how many knows that god uses men god uses people to be deliverers amen like moses was a deliverer right but he was just he was just saying man in the hands of god because god is truly deliverer amen it takes god to be a deliverer and in those days if you all remember there was many different fights that was going on and then gideon was chosen he was chosen to be a deliverer and they were going to go up now notice i'm going to read a scripture in the judges the 7th chapter and i want to read you kind of what kind of size army it was before we actually go into the story the 7th chapter verse 12 the media the midianites the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitudes and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude right so they had a great big multitude but in the earlier in the chapter chapter 7 verse 2 amen when they pitched uh pitched in front of the midianites he says in the valley he says the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many to give to the immediate midianites into their hands for me to give the median nuts into their hands least israel vaunt themselves against me saying my hand has saved me i mean those are you just don't need any praise god doesn't want them to get to thinking boy look at me huh look at what i have done because i'm going to go with the help of the lord i want to talk to you about pride and downfall all right pride and downfall because somebody knows that if you really want to hit the ground hard if you really want something bad to happen to you just let pride come into your life let pride get lifted up in pride think you are somebody think that you did it but you're at it look out you're headed for a downfall because the bible says pride cometh before that's right if all so you can be guaranteed all right so they'll say that my hand has done this and therefore go and proclaim and i'm going to save a little bit of reading but how many knows he says you know just take as many as what drink like a dog or lap it out of the water y'all remember the story let him go down and drink and there ended up being 300 men he ended up with 300 that did that they drank from that water he says listen and the lord said unto gideon by the 300 men that left will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man to his place first he said that anybody just scared or worried let them all go home and some hundred lots of thousands of people went home and so forth then he narrowed it on down because god wanted them to know that it's not them i i believe that's what god wants us to know that it's not you it's not me it's god he is our deliverer if you're saved tonight if you're filled with the holy ghost it's because that god delivered you how many beliefs he delivers you from sin he delivers you from this he delivers you from that amen unless he delivers you you're still stuck in a rut you're still unsafe you're still unhappy you're still trapped in the flesh so he said the gideon and them that they were to do that and to make a long story short on this one those 300 i don't know just exactly how the picture is but they divided them up into three groups 100 here and 100 there and they all had pictures of pictures and in the pictures were lamps and they went so far and they had another trumpet in their other hand and then at first at a certain place they would take and they would break the pictures amen and hold up the lamp and also blow the trumpet i don't know what the purpose was all about but what happened is uh it says in the 300 blue verse 22 the trumpets and the lord said every man sword against his fellow i don't know what they see but how many know that god when he goes to doing stuff he can change and should i say manipulate the minds of the enemy i don't know about you but i would never want to be on god's bad side why just like homosexuality and all of that that's their mind is turned over to a reprobate mind they believe that what it's they're doing is okay huh a reprobate man these guys is right they had amen god uh just turned to each other they fought each other and they killed each other so it was not the three hundreds fight it wasn't israel's but it was the lord that fights for him all they had to do is surrender to god all they had to give is to give themselves to god let me take another character we'll go through this jehoshaphat remember jehoshaphat it was another army the hosts and sand of the seas kind of a thing i mean it was a group of people a bunch of people had common they had yeah man they had given him letters you know uh that of war and so forth and that was scary the liver on it i mean man they couldn't do not they couldn't they didn't know which way to turn and what did jehoshaphat do he did the one thing that i believe is another example for us tonight and that is that the way that you get deliverance is when you recognize that you need deliverance you have got to get to the place that you know you need help amen and joseph had said that in his prayer we are not able to defeat them but god we need help you see even jesus came not for the woes one at her well but for the sake jesus says you know those that don't are not sick they don't need a physician i'm afraid the world is full of people that don't need a physician people think that they don't need god but jehoshaphat he dressed in sackcloth and in ashes and so forth and he began to do what pray say it with me pray if you want to see god's deliverance pray because that's where you're going to get your deliverance that's where the power comes from is to talk to the lord talk to god about it dress in sacrifice in humility amen he was not too proud to say oh we can do it huh no he wasn't he says we can't do it you got to come to the place where you recognize i can't do it amen but i here i am i am believing that god is going to do it amen and jehoshaphat did that and the word of the lord came back to jehoshaphat don't you worry about this crowd don't you worry about all of this because i'm going to take care of it i'll deliver them into your hands how many knows all of our enemies no matter what it is sin hatred variance immolation lust whatever it is that is your enemy amen and you'll never overcome that unless god delivers you from that because i mean we're born and sin shaped iniquity come in the world speaking lies we come in the hole we couldn't crawl out there's no way for you to help yourself that's where grace comes in i mean god's deliverance is grace in in luke if you remember luke 4 and 17 where he picked up the scriptures he said this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears he booked picked up the book of isaiah and he opened the book and he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind just like i said sunday we're born blind they have eyes but you see not jesus said you got to have the lord to come and open up your spiritual eyes to be able to even see that you have a need people's blind but he came to open up the eyes of the blind he came as a deliverer to deliver the goddess captives is something that's got to hold you and it won't let go it just won't let go the desire for sin lust all those things will not let go unless god delivers you from it amen he has to absolutely deliver you from it give you the power otherwise you never overcome it amen praise the lord let's talk a few minutes on people that really don't want god's deliverance they actually don't think they're uh that they don't they don't even think that they're captives people don't you know they don't think they're even captive and yet they're prisoners how many we were all in pot devil's pawn job the whole world is in the devil's pawn shop the way only way that you're getting out of that pawn shop if is if god comes and pays the price for you how many knows he came and bought us with a price we are paul with a price and he came and paid that price he purchased us and delivered us out of that pawn shop we needed deliverance everybody needs deliverance he is the god of deliverance in many battles but listen when jesus was on earth he said this and people then the pharisees didn't think that they needed deliverance he didn't think they were in bondage then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are you my disciples in need you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you afraid huh how did this how did the pharisees respond they answered him we be abraham's seed and we were never in bondage to any man huh pride they didn't want jesus how many know they didn't need jesus they didn't think they needed jesus they didn't need his word they didn't they hated jesus how's how is god ever going to deliver somebody that doesn't feel like they have need of deliverance the only way to get deliverance is when you recognize you have a need of deliverance you know you want it without you want it above everything else you want more than anything else you want deliverance when you've got that passion like that god will deliver you amen oh my listen isn't this something how sometimes god won't deliver us when he we think he should we think we got the faith to be delivered and he still doesn't and we have to hold on and keep believing keep holding on keep believing keep holding on keep believing isn't that right and then eventually he dies sooner or later he does he will i believe he's to build character amen all right listen to this and how sayest thou that ye shall be made free we're never in bondage and jesus answered them should i say in vain because it never did do them any good verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin yeah you may not be in bondage to this one the other even though romans are abolished about romans but listen what he was trying to say i don't care you are sinners you're bound to your earthly carnal nature you're born in sin and as long as you're in sin you're a servant of sin you're a prisoner of it but i'm here to set you free i'm here to set you free from your sin from your condemnation but they didn't want no deliverance they didn't need him they don't need god people don't need god i don't know about you but all of humanity needs god they just don't realize they need god many religious organizations denominations they don't think they need god they're out there and they're really without god but they don't know it and is that sad never to be delivered same way with cain how many knows that came he didn't need god he didn't want god god offered him mercy he offered him deliverance he offered him forgiveness huh but because it didn't come his way he didn't want it so we find that many people in the world today don't feel that they have need to be delivered they feel like they delivered already that's a terrible state to be in a terrible place to be amen because tommy knows the whole creation the whole world needs deliverance and all of creation is groaning you and i are groaning for the final deliverance how many days there's going to be a final deliverance can i go a little bit longer tonight go to romans quick if you will romans 8 romans 8 and we'll begin with verse 19. i don't know about you but i can't even walk without him holding my hand i don't mind being needy i need him i need the oh i need thee every hour i need the you gotta need him before he can help you amen for the earnest exp expectation chapter 8 of romans verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who also has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption amen into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail up in pain together until now amen and we ourselves grown within ourselves we have the holy ghost we've grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of this body we are looking for and waiting for god to deliver us from this vile body amen this body can never pull you the wrong way it can never think the wrong thoughts it can never accidentally do the wrong thing huh they bet this body does but we're looking for a body that don't do that this will always lead you to wrong we're looking for for that and as i think about this i tell you what one of the most one of the things i really hate to see my my son the other day when he come over the house he says dad you got to go back here we got to look at this there was a mama deer mama doe laying in the ditch and he was he said he stopped right up close there by and looked at it and it just kind of lifted up his head and looked over at him you know he says i don't know if he's still alive or not i said well i'll go along i'll go over there i'll take my crossbow and put it out of its misery if it is still alive and we went back there of course but then it had slumped over and died but i really i think of this scripture when i see all these dead animals on the road of creation creation even natural creation that is in pain suffering dying in horrible ways amen waiting for this to be over with you think about nursing homes there's not going to be any nursing homes you think about the growing and the pain and the hospitals and all of this that's going on isn't that right it's all groaning for that day of sweet relief when our lord shall come back to earth again when this whole creation tree baleth waiting to be delivered from this bondage of corruption amen how many believe that it will take absolute take the deliverance of almighty god to change our bodies the changes in our they're going to have to be a miracle happen god's going to have to do it or are you going to be left sitting right here amen get out of this old pest house i'm just looking forward to getting out of this old house oh my let me just read you a couple quotes this is the only quote i got but talking about this old pest house that we're living in this place that we're looking to be delivered out of amen my now we find this life holds all kinds of evils so therefore the life that is to come won't have it this one has lust sickness death because what is it it's not the house that he's going to prepare amen this is a pest house how many knows what a pest house is sure that's what you're living in a pest house is where they put all the diseased people huh well that's just what sin done to us amen right that's where sin put us put us in the hole put us in the pest house amen let anyone else come amen they wouldn't they won't let anybody else come into that pest house because there was all kinds of germs flying around in there just reminds me of looking at the world with everybody wearing a mask we're living in a great big giant world pest house we're putting masks on and everything else social distancing not trying not to catch the germs that's flying around what a world you reckon we'll write any masks over there no eyes are resounding no no masks over there folks how about social distancing over there no socialism no more sickness no more germs hey i'm not so much you know covets a terrible thing but all kinds of other things that kill millions of peoples every year amen i'm here to tell you humanity our brains people's brains don't work right i know i'm on the internet but you think about they do all this for covet right but then they'll let you smoke up cigarettes that kill hundreds and thousands of people every all the time they'll let them take things like that that kill them isn't that right real good logic we got you kill a mama with a baby in the womb and it's double homicide but if a mama kills it it's not double homicide it's okay even after it's out of the womb breathing hello let me tell you something somebody's got brain damage that's not even right thinking all right that's not logical it's not justice for sure in a court of law it's not justice at all that right for one to get charged with it and the other one can do it and there's not a problem that's not justice but that's our thinking the old pest house people's gone completely yes that's right insane amen i don't know how much long facebook will leave is beyond there but there's other places we can go that's all right huh but that's right but hey how many knows it's getting close to going and i don't know about you but i'm looking for deliverance every day i get up and i say thank you lord jesus for this monday tomorrow morning when i get up and say thursday lord i know that you're giving me one more day to make sure i'm ready how many will look at it that way lord i know you're giving me one more day to make sure that i'm ready because one of these days you're going to come and deliver us like nothing ever you can't possibly imagine we're going to feel

right listen to this micah throw put this on real good will you brother stephen he sent me this the other day i thought it was good and remember thus saith the lord there'll be a woman ruled before

him amen let's bow our heads and i just want to while we have heads bowed perhaps during this sermon somewhere in your life you know something that you really need delivered of and you've tried and tried perhaps you've just not been able to but with after the sermon you realize that hey you really have to have to feel the need and to believe god and humble yourself and to pray and ask god god deliver me from this whatever it might be if there's anybody that has the need for deliverance for anything at all amen you raise your hand say god you spoke to my heart in this area of my life i know
