this morning you open of brother and amen if we go in the scripture here in the Psalms Psalms 37 we're going to read from Psalms 37 we're going to go start in verse verse one and go to verse 19 if we just think back like brother Joe said in that prayer if we just think back of where the Lord's brought us from and then that thought like that L little old lady said she said well I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but I sure ain't what I used to be and we can praise the Lord for that he's helping us every day Psalms 37 fret fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed commit thy way unto the the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of hang on here fret not thyself because of him who prosper in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the Earth but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bow shall be broken for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous this one together they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied God bless you may be seated Brother Brad good morning brothers and sisters good to be in the house of the Lord this morning everybody should have rested well shouldn't had any trouble sleeping after yesterday so hope everybody enjoyed their yourself couple of quick announcements and then uh I'll I'll be out of the way here but um the decorations the flowers I just wanted to let everybody know if anybody want to take those with you take them uh they they they're I'm sure they're thirsty but any of the mums the flowers the pumpkins all those decorations that were left here um if you want them for your house your kids want the pumpkins you want the flowers the moms take them give them some water and they'll they'll keep on going till Frost so uh just want to get that out there and cuz we don't want to take them home so uh we' we've seen all the flowers we want to see for a while and uh so you enjoy them uh but on a more serious note we do want to come before the church and just kind of share something with you that's been on our heart this last week and uh speaking about the devastation in the in the mountains and in Tennessee North Carolina and different places uh did get to talk to brother Daryl the other day and just kind of uh he shared some thoughts with me of of the things that's going on I know you know we got John Michael there and some different ones that are that are there and I'm sure put forth effort so just a reminder today's offering will all go towards uh the relief effort there and uh talking to brother Bor I think what we're going to do is we're just going to combine the check uh combine all the funds that come in and make one check and take it to them um and the reason that is is because they they know what they need um and so they can distribute the money so our church will make a a a check to their church and the disaster relief effort and they can go and get what they need from where they need as they see the needs uh they are running I don't want to say running low on money but I think there is a definitely according to brother Daryl a financial need they have spent tens of thousands of dollars out of their Church um and to to try to support the efforts and so uh with that being said that's what the funds today will go for um the Lord laid it on my heart um you know I just you know the Lord places each of us in position and places your place of employment whatever your job is the contacts you know the network of people okay he places you there so uh he laid it on my heart and I'm going to I'm going to this Thursday I'm planning to take my truck and trailer and they need canned goods blankets um and the thing is they they don't want to deplete the local environment yes we can order and and send there uh and but they don't want to deplete the local environment for people that can get to the goods and make the shelves bare so we want to be able to I'm I'm going to put out to my network of people and the community that I know and and try to just say hey we're going to do a canned food drive blankets he said one of the big things they need is is empty plastic gas cans uh to try to get gas to generators and and pumps and and things like that so um if if one of those three things if if if you work at a place and you want to do a little can fish food drive um anybody that can help me pick up from little places uh Tuesday or Wednesday if they get their stuff together and want to pick it up we'll we'll also uh have a place here at the church Wednesday night I'll bring my truck and trailer uh if you want to take water canned good well let's brother Daryl said kind of back off the water at this point I think because they've got a couple of tractor and trailers that are bringing water okay so um and if we get enough canned goods that I can't pull it in my trailer I'm sure we can get a tractor and trailer to take it up there we got people that's got the ability and the capability so uh this is a time for us to see uh how we can help our brothers and sisters that are helping others in their Community um and and we just want to be be able to do that if we can and I believe I believe it's our responsibility you know many times we rely heavily we rely heavily on the government and disasters well I'm not being political here but out of the mouth of their own people they have no money to send to these people uh $750 can you imagine in the blink of an eye a a tidal wave washes away your entire life everything you have your car your home your possessions your everything is gone in the blink of an eye and the government says well we can give you $750 so um you know we just want to be able to to to help and make a difference where we can and I believe we got a strong group of people here and I believe we got a strong network of people that know people and can pull things off so if somebody wants to do monetary value I'll be glad to take that when I go uh if they want to make a check uh if you if you work at a business and they will let you set up a donation box for the next week we we'll go two weeks in a row three weeks however long they plan to go I asked brother Daryl how long do you plan to go he said I don't see a a stop in the effort right now so if we go this week and we need to go next week I'll we'll work it out we'll find people that can get the stuff there so um we'll make that push you know and and and they're doing such a good work and you know it it sounds they're they're just a you know 800 people or so in the church and they're making a an impact on the lives of the people in their area um as a Friday I believe they had uh visited at that point eight places that nobody had even been to yet that they could not get into they cut their way in they they move dirt and you know I've seen pictures you've seen pictures if you haven't go to the Word of Life flood relief uh Facebook page or or brother Michael Bailey um and just look at the videos look at the pictures and and it just it's an eye opener he said you just can't imagine you just can't imagine the devastation that that I'm seeing and and he just broke down you know and uh so you know pray for their pray for our brothers and sisters that are on the ground the boots on the ground that's making this effort because mentally they are going to be they're going to be suffering mentally their mental health and needs prayer because they're seeing things that human beings don't want to see don't need to see don't like to see and they're they're seeing these things experiencing these things and so they're going to need some help prayer prayerfully uh be prayerfully uh in your uh prayers but for them uh for the things they're saying and you know you think well you know I thought you in my mind I'm thinking Lord I can try to put this together and what if nobody gives anything and I thought you know Jesus fed 5,000 and more with a few fish and a couple pieces of bread and I and then it just kind of dawned on me hey little is much if God is in it so if I have to take one can of green beans I'm G to take one can of green beans and and God can do what he wants to do with it so um we'll just put all of our efforts together I know uh financially sometimes it hurts it's it's tough on everybody right now I know that um and but I asked brother darl about the money needs and the situation he said every little bit helps he said well had somebody come and hand him I think he said $44.75 and they said brother Daryl this is all I had my penny bank but I want you to have it so you know it's uh we can do a lot so I just want you to put think about this pray about it your places of Employments the people you work with the people you know let's see what we can do what kind of move and impact we can make from our little Community to help our brothers sisters and our fellow mankind that that need help right now so God bless you and uh we will we will get with you the more the details drop locations and anybody that anybody that wants to have a setup or that can contribute or maybe if I need somebody to pick up something in an area to get it here Wednesday if you just say hey I let me know if you need something I I'll call on you if we have a desire have a need because I can't I probably can't pick up from all the places but we'll you know on my own but we'll we'll make it work God bless you brother and sisters brother David how do you follow that you just forgive me this morning I thought as I got out of bed this morning I thought Lord how long is it going to be before them people have a nice bed to lay in as sleep in rof over their head you've been so good to us but you know what those are his children too and I thought you know we go through things sometimes in life we don't understand but guess what God's in control this morning and you know and I I thought Brother Brad whatever we can do to help we'll do and I thought Lord you just make way because you know when I thought when he said that about the $4.75 I thought you know I've got hooked on a new habit I like iced coffee and one cup of that is about $6 and I thought wow they give all they had maybe we could just not have something that we like

just desire God that you'll have your way this morning Lord and that you'll speak to your people father the things that you once said keep me from saying anything in myself Lord but only what your spirit would speak so that father the people could go from here Lord edified and fed from the manner God that you have provided for us in this hour Lord we desire Lord Jesus that you'll just take Lord Jesus your word father and bring it in such a way that I couldn't have never dreamt Lord Jesus or thought of Father Lord and we just ask God lord you just be with every need that's represented Lord your perish in a special way Lord that you'd help them Father as Lord they try to help her today Lord Jesus and and father we just ask God that you just be with each and every one today Lord we know that you know the thoughts the intents of our heart right now Lord and you know where every heart is you know where we are with you Lord and where we need to be and you know how to work on us just in the way that we need to be worked on father so we ask God that you'll do that to every heart Lord not just to one or two but everyone Lord father we expect great things from you today Lord and we ask Lord you'll bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel God that you've laid Upon Our Hearts to speak this morning Father May It Be Right on time lord Jesus and just in the way that you want it father for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen amen praise the Lord if you will turn your Bibles amen we'll get right into the word we do want to have communion this morning amen amen first Thessalonians first Thessalonian Ians kind of different I guess this morning uh kind of different can be a little different SEC 1 Thessalonians 5 and8 in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Jesus Christ Christ concerning you amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning have you got my title up there yet amen I want to speak on I want to speak on the attitude of gratitude amen the attitude of gratitude amen and while the scripture says in everything in everything a that right so there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of things there's a lot of aspects of our life amen and you know I've been kind of streaming and looking at every video and everything that I could am me on North Carolina Tennessee and all the devastation and uh that has happened there and how it almost looks apocalyptic amen amen just looks almost like the apocalypse amen and so uh been looking at it and just different things I know brother Joe had mentioned some things like caskets floating down the river and you know we've seen that and just different things that where houses of course are going in bridges are washed out homes are just collapsed and and all the things that's happened and I think they've called it it's pretty much well I've heard something about since 1910 or something that they haven't experienced something like that so we could call it a once in a century storm that right once in a century storm so that's uh you know that's a long time and so people lost a lot amen and their lives certainly changed in a moment's time as brother Brad was saying amen just in a very very quick amount of time and so this is basically where I kind of got my message amen because amen how many knows that a lot of times we neglect to appreciate until we don't have and when we you know just the simple things like a road you know and uh I think Grace was telling me that they had went up to Chimney Rock her and Mike I think for a date or something up to Chimney Rock so they've been there before and they know what it's like and there was one boy on there on YouTube where he was taking a video and he could only go so far and showed a police car that was all smashed up and the cars that were in the river that just looked like a pile of rubber and I mean rubble and uh he was basically having to walk there because you couldn't drive there because you know a lot of those places are completely cut off because the roads are just simply did there just a riverbed where there was a road there's nothing but like looks like the rest of the river right it's just going from over here to all the way over there and and the way in there's just just no way in anymore as far as uh he had to walk up through the woods he couldn't really even walk along the bank CU washed out so bad kind of go up over the Hillside and go around and order order in order to be able to even get there and you know and I I begin to think about all the little things amen that we take for granted ain't that right we just we just aren't appreciative of them like we should be so I thought about appreciation and I thought about how uh that God does want us to appreciate things amen and to be Greatful for things and to think and I came to this scripture amen of in everything give thanks amen but so I want to talk and I'm going to actually take this storm basically and we're going to type it a little bit spiritual amen of uh you know a a spirit on in on the spirit realm because we know know that over I believe it is in Isaiah 59 and verse 19 it says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against it ain't that right amen and so there's a flood am mean and there another place uh you know that that Satan's just throwing a flood out there and he's trying to wash away every thing that is righteous and holy and good amen was everything away amen out of our lives so to speak amen any God that there's around we've seen it amen and taking it first of all taking prayer out of schools isn't that right taking the Bible out of schools and then Ten Commandments out of the cour houses and they went from there to there to there there amen and it's just like a flood anything and everything in any possible way that they possibly can amen that the devil is coming in but how many's glad that God does set up a standard amen he gives us something to come again it amen and to overcome it amen amen and so uh you know just before coming out here I had a little thought you know that uh that is that brother brandham said every 2,000 years something major happens and that right so he preached on an oncoming storm amen how many believes there's a storm coming amen it is a storm unlike you've ever seen amen it's a storm that you and I don't want to be no part of amen the Vengeance and the whine of the wrath of almighty God when it's poured out amen I had to think you know this Devastation as as brother Brad said brother Daryl says it's more than what you can imagine you know it's worse than what you can imagine and yet amen I have to say this morning that it's nothing it's nothing compared to the storm and the floods that's coming ain't that right you know because you can still see the hills and you can see the mountains and the trees and and there's still things left and perhaps they can restore but when this flood comes that's coming and this this you know brother bam said that there there the trees out there there won't even be any trees left because he said he just seen smoldering stumps amen when that when those atomic bombs go off it'll clean it all off completely amen and the trees will be gone only these stumps maybe you'll still still be on fire and that's all that'll be left no people no nothing so you know judgment how many knows we're living right at the edge of the judgments of almighty God Amen and uh you think about you think about America amen I was looking up and brother bam says BR God always sends an angel he sends a messenger like Martin Luther and and John Wesley to England isn't that right Luther was to Germany and England and John Wesley and them and he says and then after they're done with their message he sends a temporary judgment and he said look at what happened with Germany Ain that right look at the devastation and they let him get up a Hitler amen that almost got them all killed amen you talk about a temporary judgment even by the hands of Americans and mean dropping that uh those those firebombs over the cities and killing the number of civilians was just extraordinary when America went to killing civilians as a means to try to break down this regime cuz how many knows we did that's right amen and then also of course England you know they got their fair share of judgment temporary judgment and France and so forth amen and I was just listening to Benjamin Netanyahu where he was saying how that France and uh I call him macaroni I don't know macaron or something like that amen I don't have much respect for him anymore I call him macaroni or something because he's pretty much jellyfish because he's called for an embargo against Israel a a a a you know for weapons and so forth and of course Netanyahu he says boy that is AB he said you know we're going to fight this battle we're fighting it on seven fronts that's a lot of Nations coming up against Israel folks and now for a lot of the Western countries to be turning them against them it's coming close to the Fulfillment of the revelations isin't that right where they're all turning against them and so forth amen and so calling for arms embargo against is Israel and what a shame that is amen so we see that the storm's Brewing isn't it a lot of people thinking I one a commentator Amen on the war and he's keeping up the war he's over there and looking at the war and he says he says as far as he's concerned World War III has already started he F felt like it started with Ukraine is that right because it's really about the East against the west and they're using the Ukraine as a means to do it with and of course with Putin saying hey if you join in you're part of this war hello and so so he says even in World War II it started little but he was still part of World War II just the little things that happened and then then he just watched it escalate and you watch and you're looking at the escalation of it right now amen it's certainly alarming isn't it amen and so I got to thinking brother bam thinking it was supposed to be over by 77 here we are in 2024 we are way down the road something's going to break loose one of these days amen and I can't help but believe that if we aren't careful amen cuz this is the hour that we need to watch and pray and be ready for you don't know the day that the hour comes amen Jesus says you know that even as these people talking about their houses broken down and and so forth you know he says you know we've got a house that we got to watch out for it's this house right here amen and you better watch if you know what to what if you know what hour the thief is coming amen amen I don't know and I just illustrate it this way if you you know that a thief is coming it makes it much better if you don't when a thief is coming because you know I don't know about you but that would be an absolute nightmare Amen to wake up in your bed and to have a gun pointed right at your nose say all right come on get up here and let's go see what you got that I want out of your house you'd be a slave to do whatever he has to do ain't that right amen and it'd be a terrible Nightmare and that's the way it is when Christ comes and takes his church home hello amen and those that are left here and realize that they're in the tribulation period it's going to be very scary for you amen I wonder and you know I can't help but wonder how many message Believers are going to be left here for the tribulation period hello amen I'll tell you what you better go to search in your heart really hard and really good amen because I don't know about you but I don't plan on being here amen I don't want no part of tribulation I say Lord oh my you know let me talk about another another storm coming how many knows there's a storm coming called the judgment and the wrath of God not only that but the white Throne judgment is going to be a scary thing because even brother benam said you know Pierce me through through Hot Irons and not all kinds of all kinds of things he said do to my body do to me but don't let me be at that white Throne judgment because God will have judgment without Mercy amen and it's going to be a scary thing but how many's glad amen that God has made a way of Escape of that judgment that storm is coming coming and people will bow people will face that but you ain't got to be fearful you don't have to be afraid because you already have provided way that he has made to escape that judgment and oh God is's so good isn't he aren't you thankful today that God made a way of Escape amen I think it's time to appreciate what God has done and how man he makes a way praise be to God one of the first things I got to thinking about amen was that how that the roads are washed out amen how many where there used to be a road now there's not a road and he says man that young man said man we used to take a car and just be able to drive here and even the four-wheel four-wheel drive four-wheelers can get only so far they can't even get through there anymore amen how nice it would be to be able to just take your car and cruise right over to the city where you want to be how many knows and I got to thinking about how that there's a road that God has a road and brother bam said our forefathers paved the way they removed all the stumps they got removed the trees and made to pass even this path of 6880 probably at one time with nothing but a dirt road with a bunch of wagon wheels and and and wagons and so forth going back and forth you know and they had to clear this and clear that amen and I want you to understand that our father for Luther Wesley amen Pentecost the prophet of God came amen I want to say it might have been gravel yet in Luther's time but I want you to know that in this hour we've got a paved Road amen it is smooth it is clear it is without doubt amen a road that you can travel on without any fear or Scare Jesus Christ came and proved it and Vindicated the word of God you're living and walking on the path of a Vindicated word wo I don't know about you but I like that better than hobbling over rocks and saying well you got to be homies you got to be menite you got to do this you got to speak in tongues and I'm not sure about this I'm not on just fall over all kinds of rocks trying to get through there but you ain't got to be that way anymore amen aren't you glad for a smooth Road a clear Road amen all the doubts have been removed what's right which road should you take M amen praise the Lord think about that how many knows that God even the Pope's religion the Pope's Doctrine is you know amen all of these roads lead us to God all these different religions why do you think he has a has all of those western or these Eastern people and Muslims and different ones around him and all those priests around them they all join up with him they're going to find out one of these days the roads washed out Tommy amen when they get to the end they'll realize their religion and Road didn't get them nowhere they were on the wrong path amen and they'll find out when it's too late you'll find out it doesn't work cuz Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man comes to the God Amen to the father but by me how many believes Jesus is the way amen it even it ain't this church it ain't what we amen you know it's not us as a colletive group group it's Jesus that's the way even brother bam said about the Tabernacle amen they're as bad as any of them wow but he said he pointed you to Jesus cuz that's the way amen are you glad for a way that is absolutely without question it's not the Amish Amish men night Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian that's not the way Christ is the way Jesus is the way amen praise the Lord amen they found out that those places that they built their buildings at built the roads on didn't hold up buildings didn't hold up amen maybe close to a river North Carolina I can't help but maybe they didn't have very strict codes if you're like us in Kentucky amen I like I kind of like no codes as far as in the natural you know let me do my own wiring my own plumbing and you know let me grab my big old uh my shed with the with a what is it big old cedar posts down in the ground and if I just choose to make a house out of it I can make a house out of it praise God for a little bit of Liberty yet amen I thought Bo I'm right at the edge of a bluff brother Brad if anything I'm never going to flood out but I could slide off of there I guess amen but you know I got to thinking you know and and what what is it you know and I thought codes are good codes are good you know because why they try they have these codes especially in Florida amen I'll tell you what they got codes coming out your ears about right it's just about everything you want to replace a window you better have a permit you know and all kinds of stuff like that but you know they want to make sure that when you put your Rafters on that you got uh you know uh uh hurricane straps on them ain't that right put some hurricane straps amen because you don't want it like my my father-in-law amen when the hurricane come through he with you know the top plate and the roof was just kind of flopping up and down that gets a little scary about them don't it ain't that right you got a little loose amen but codes are to make sure that it can withstand what's coming wo aren't you glad that God builds things to his stand what's coming we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken it cannot be moved amen amen so I want to talk about roads Bridges houses amen how even people's livelihoods their jobs perhaps got washed away and so forth but we have a building code how many believe we have a building code in the Bible Amen to build and you know a lot of times most of the times I get to thinking it's easiest probably down with those Hills on the side of the mountains so forth who's going to build a big Factory up the side of a hill you can't do it so down here in this Valley here this is a good place to build right the easy way that's what people like to do people like to build where it's easy easy I can dress how I want I can act what I can do what I want and everything else but I'm still a Christian yeah you go down that easy Road see what happens down the road when the flood comes amen and you know the funny part is the funny part is that these people no doubt will go to building that thing right back right up in the same place it was well now brother brother what are you going to say about about that well I'm going to say well guess what you do the same thing again and something else come through what's going to happen again yeah can't do the same thing expect different results I guess unless you pour concrete a bunch of concrete use a bunch of Steel so that guess what even after the flood goes over top through and under it'll still be standing you better build some kind of a building amen here's our code here's our building amen listen therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doth them I will liken them unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock woo Glory can you imagine well this neighbor here he decided not to build down there he decided to go up there amen and Beat Around and dig into this side of this hill amen he's going to play real get a real Foundation of footer and dig in and while all of these floods were coming and washing all these people in the valley away he was up there say praise the Lord I'm glad I didn't build down there huh amen how about us how many knows you're a house you're like you want to be like that wise man amen that built his house upon doing what God Said do build it to God code and you won't have to say boy I'm glad I'm not in a tribulation period am me you can say I'm sure glad that I built this house according to God's code the way that God said to build it amen and where God said to build it cuz there's a lot of people building all kinds of different P places amen remember the thief that come in amen some other way he did it some other the way and what did he do he got cast out how did you get in here you're a thief and a robber and he cast him out into outer Darkness amen if you want to take your way you want to go down your road build it the way you want to build it you're going to be disappointed you want to live your life the way you want to live it the way you want to live it when you know the word says something contrary to that watch out you're building on [Applause] sand it's easy to do amen people want to do it their way well brother Bram don't believe that the speaking tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost we're going to have no part of him or these meetings just threw the baby out with the bath water just you through Jesus right out your door why because you had an idea and you wanted to do it your way woo hello and there's a flood coming how many believes that yes there is now I'm going to read you that read you about this flood if I can find it right quick I didn't put a sticker in it believe it's in Proverbs amen do it your way people like to do it their way don't they Jesus said if you do it amen all right I'm going to hold that and finish my verse I'm going so fast this morning oh my which built his house upon a rock the rains descended the floods came the winds blew are you a Believer this morning reading Between the Lions with me or not huh the floods came the wave of sin came like the prophet said you watch the wave of sin come now and he'll try to drown you out amen the floods came the winds bleow and beat upon that house how many knows we're getting beat upon with all of these things that the devil throws at us lukewarmness your own way getting getting letting your Rel become C casual unappreciative of what God has done in this generation unappreciative of what he did on Calvary oh my I think it would be okay if we took our time this morning wouldn't it we'll do two services and one we have to but I don't want to be in a hurry but I'd like to preach this message is that all right I feel like the Lord laid it on my heart about Friday nights Friday because you know how it is when you know you're going to be busy all day Saturday who am I going to call I I'm going to be at that event all day Saturday and how in the world are you going to preach if you're at the event all Satay Saturday you know but I was thankful the Lord laid a little thought on my my heart it was this amen and so I says I'm I'm happy I'll go there and spend as much time with y'all as I can enjoy it as much as I can amen so amen I believe it's of the Lord amen and beat upon that house and it fell not because it was founded upon a Rock Amen how many glad that you have been founded kids you aren't founded upon your parents' Revelation they're experience no You' got to have your prayer life your rock that you got to hold off that you're built upon a Rock Amen because the world and the things of the world Amen it'll attract you it'll catch you if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you ain't don't stand a chur without the Holy Ghost you'll lean to your desires and your passions over what's right like the prophet said God the devil the God of this world has made it easy for everybody to sin in amen that's right now beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not it's quite something he don't talk about you just believe and there you have it he's not talking about faith here you're quiet he that he he said he that heareth these things of mine and doeth them it's about what you do not what you hear but what you do with what you hear anden you got to do it well this is the code but you know I believe the code I absolutely believe the code but I'm going build it a little different watch out and you got to do what he says amen my and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rains descendant the floods came the winds blow and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it how many knows that these kingdoms that we have now they're all they've got to fall they will fall because they're man-made amen when how many knows it's going to be a big fall it's going to be a great fall going to be a terrible fall I'm here to tell you God is a very merciful god he's longsuffering he don't want to do what he's fixing to do I don't believe he wants to do what he's fixing to have to do amen and he's Longs suffering not willing that any should perish that's why we're still here that's why it's still going on got long suffering why so that people people might appreciate the path and the way that he has made the road that he has paved so that we could get to God so that we could walk on his path and he yells screams preaches all the time not your way but my way come my way come by acts 238 to walk way is the way today buried in the precious name of Jesus Amen dig deep no way down amen and hit that Solid Rock the water way is the way today in the name of Jesus Christ that's where you get your anchor that's why you hit that Rock Amen oh my praise the Lord Proverbs says it that this way listen when I called you refused I stretched out my hand and no man regarded how many knows there's warning and then there's judgment there's warning there's an oncoming storm like that man in Florida that would not listen to the message hey there's a typhoon coming there's a storm coming get to shelter get to safety isn't that what the preachers ought to be screaming today amen get to safety there's a storm coming there's judgment coming God going to burn all that is evil all the Sinners are going to be burnt out of it but there's a refuge in the time of storm and that Refuge is Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit stretches out his hand come the neighbor went to him said no men your wife your children they at least let them come he said no I'm the man of the house and they'll obey me he got swept away they never did find him found his wife and children bit by moccasins and so forth up on the roof of a house dead amen my because he would not listen amen let me just say this while it comes to my mind how manyan know the Bible says that we are to fall upon the rock and let it crush us let it break us fall upon the rock let it break you cuz if you don't according to Revelations you're going to call amen you're eventually you're going to have be calling on the rocks and the hills to fall on you and to hide you from the face of the amen that one that sits on the throne because why because that rock that's hued out of a mountain is coming and those who have not fallen on the Rock he is going to grind them to powder does it say grind them to powder people don't want to see the mercy and kindness and the love and the sweetness and the forgiveness and the grace of God they don't want that so I wonder how they'll like it when fire proceeds out of his eyes when he comes an Angry God I called and I called I stretched out and I stretched out I pleaded I begged I did everything I could to get you in but you would not now you're going to have the fruit of your own ways amen I called you refus you I stretched out my hand no man regarded it you said it not all my counil would none of my reproof amen sometimes when you listen to the prophet of God it sounds sounds like mostly reproof but man them preachers come and says can't you get on something else besides the women's hair and and clothes and this that or the other can't you get on something else teach them deep things why because he was always telling them about these things why why did he do that because he knew that if they didn't have the Holy Ghost that desire would take over and that's the way they dress and if they would have the Holy Ghost they dress right amen they drew right they act right they wipe that stuff off of their face they look Godly instead of ungodly like something artificial always rebuking the churches preaching the indictment indicting all this generations of preachers for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ do they listen did they listen did they listen to the indictment did they believe the indictment no or they to repent it said God forgive me you know brother Brad there's a lot of book a lot of those in the book of Acts when Peter was preaching them you with Wicked hands have taken and crucified him ain't that right and then it says they were pricked in their heart and said men what must we do the very ones that some of them that crucified him repented but this generation of Pentecostals and Baptist and Methodist am mean did they repent no even though Jesus would come down and vindicate that the prophet was preaching the truth there's nothing left even brother Braham said how can you preach anything but judgment when mercy has been spurned amen let me tell you something that goes for every soul in here every individual in here you spurn the mercy of God and the grace of God there's nothing left for you to have to face his judgment oh boy I shouldn't say I hope this is proper but I'm going to say it all right you want to do do that you want to spurn God's gra quit quit running for the Rocks quit trying to hide stand there like a man and take what God's going to give you cuz he's going to give it to you whether you're trying to hide or not big proud boastful people that think they can defy God laugh at him laugh at Christians mock at Christians mock at sisters the way they dress and right and so forth yeah when your Calamity comes stand there like a man and take it you got it coming there's not going to be any Mercy For You woo little different I just feel that in my heart that you know is that okay amen that's right set not at not all my counsel with not of my reproof many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent amen now listen I also will laugh at your Calamity I will mock when your fear comes amen when your fear cometh as desolation your destruction comes as a whirlwind when California goes beneath the ocean and the tidal wave come and people begin to scream God help us ha huh it's what he said he'll laugh at your Calamity cuz he had more than Mercy for you more than Grace for you pretty rough sight of God a sight of God this world has never seen you don't ever want to see I don't ever want to see it he's cruel wrath wine of his the cup of his wine of indignation of almighty God poured out without mixture pure the wrath of God in its purest form it's not going to be nice leave them neither a root nor a branch it'll wipe them off the face of the Earth these crooked politicians and Liars all of these people that doing what they're doing they'll have fear huh Their Fear will come their scare will come amen I will laugh at your Calamity I will mock when your fear comes when your fear comes as desolation and your destruction cometh as a world when when distress distress distress and anguish comes upon you oh my how many thankful for the comfort and the peace that you have for the everyday comfort and the peace that we have we ought to be grateful to [Applause] God it's only his grace and his Mercy amen because there's a lot of people down there right now wishing boy I wish I had a bathroom to go to to brush my teeth I wish I had a closet to go in and get my clothes I wish I had shoes I would have had had a drink of water it'd be nice to have power it'd be nice to have a little bit of power around here maybe I could cut some of these trees down or or or do some sawing but there's no power there's nothing it's all swept away all they can say I remember I remember I had it so nice that was so comfortable it was so nice it was so beautiful coming out and watching that Lake and that River go behind me and this that in the other now now it's all gone amen and they probably think back and realize they didn't appreciate it maybe as much as what they should have amen it's about appreciation an attitude of gratitude appreciation it make me think about it everything that we have we ought to be appreciative of it everything in everything be thankful be thankful in everything and we know that it doesn't matter what kind of house you build doesn't matter if it's made you know of concrete I don't care if you go way down in the ground way deep build a bunker brother Bram says the percussion of those things will go 150 foot down and just a sheer impact of that thing that kill you down there like a rat so there's no building no shelter here for what's coming you've get built this right here our shelter is in the under his wings we have feathers we're under the feathers under the wings of the lord it's where our safety is amen you don't have to fear when destruction and those things come you don't have to be afraid why because you're built upon a Rock Amen Paul lived in such a place he lived in such a placees I have learned that in whatever state I am to be thankful or to be content thank you Lord why because he had built his house upon a Rock Amen how many believes great gratitude gratefulness goes a long way with God because in the first place one of the sins the big sin in heaven was is that the devil wasn't content the devil wasn't satisfied the devil didn't appreciate what he had amen and that's when we gripe that's when we complain it's when we don't appreciate what you already have amen praise the Lord all right worldwind an anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me amen they'll call upon me but I will not answer they'll seek me early but they shall not find me amen there's a road that leads to god let's talk about a bridge here we're going to go that was the last subject but we're going to jump over to that because it's kind of where I want to be Bridges were washed out is that right the entire bridge going gone come to the edge of there boy I'll tell you what I remember today we just drive right across here look at the water flowing now it's gone now we can't get across that represents Mercy being over cuz how many knows that as long as that blood that bridge of the blood is around the earth God won't destroy the Earth but one day that bridge is going to be gone then you can call all you want to amen because Jesus was that bridge that God built ain't that right Jesus was the bridge like Sydney Bridge brother brah talked about that man he that engineer every nut had to be tested every bolt everything had to be tested and Jesus was tempted and tested in every points like what you and I are yet without sin he was proven amen and he built a bridge so that men and God can be reunited amen I think it's time to appreciate the bridge that God has built for Humanity so we can back have fellowship with him again cuz that bridge will be taken away one of these days when he steps off The Mercy Seat and then no matter how much you want to try amen St at one side no help us we want to get across you'll call you'll seek but there won't be nothing there they'll call but I will not answer they'll seek me early but they won't find me why they didn't appreciate what they had how manyan believe we still have that you fall short as a Christian you still got the blood you get on your knees and say God forgive me amen how many's glad that that bridge is still there for us amen and they God tries his best for people to come across that bridge I Love the Way Jesus was tested he proved this bridge built it all the way across Jesus Built it all the way he went plumped down into hell death and the grave went into hell come back up went Plum up into heaven and anchored it up there a that right he anchored it on acts 238 Acts 2 he came back amen and said come on y'all the bridge will hold this bridge is built come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden I will give rest for your souls bridge that God built amen but unfortunately that's a temporary Bridge Catholics try to say there's a bridge between purgatory and God the regions of the lost they try to say there's a bridge between the legions of the lost and God all right and so if you give me $150 I'll pray for you Grandpa it this will cost you a$ thousand dollars but I believe I can pray him out of purgatory they'd have to pray for me one more time for one more sin for slapping him right well pray for this too while you're at it you liar that's right lies but said when you leave this world it's over your chances are over it's done there's no mercy on the other side the bridge is on this side the bridge is now the bridge is here if people want to come and get it wo if you haven't Crossing man you ought to jump up and say I'm crossing over that bridge I want to get to Christ I want to get to God before that bridge washes away and everything on that side of it is going to go down is that right Heaven and Earth is going to pass away but my word shall never pass away amen FEMA will never be able to help government or the people will never be able to help when California goes down that chunk will be gone amen it's going to be a bad day isn't it already been prophesied amen but they shall seek me early and shall not find me for they hated knowledge do you know how mad people get did you ever see some of those YouTubes where preachers out there preaching and people them Devils really rise up leave us alone Le div and all these other stuff sounds like Legion huh amen and you try to reprove some of those people that are out there reproving that no if you're a male you've got genetics of a male you're not really a female oh they get mad they hate it they hate knowledge they hate the truth and they hate you if you tell them the truth they're haters of the truth they're haters of knowledge that's the kind that's going that's the kind he's talking about out amen then people will scream and holler that's right crazy hair dudes trans homos all of them people fear will come upon them you might think you don't have fear you wait they'll have fear when they know that their lives is fixing to be taken they're going to fixing to have a face of just God they'll cry heill call but he won't be there praise the Lord amen for they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord amen they would none of my counsel they despise my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices in other words they're going to eat they're going to be filled with their own way this is where your way gets you I've lived long enough to know folks when I do it my way and not the Holy Spirit Way I Live to regret it I regret it how many knows if you do it your way go ahead but you're going to regret it because God ain't GNA bless it God don't bless people that do things in carnality and their way God don't bless them no my God help us to get away from that do what God wants you to do in the way that God wants you to do it and then you'll be blessed BL but not your own way the other way is a curse it's damned amen praise the Lord amen attitude of gratitude how many know you got to have just a little attitude God loves attitude going to go on this for just a little bit attitude I thought attitude the attitude of gratitude well guess what attitude God likes attitude sometimes what kind of attitude well kind David had

or not we don't know but this one thing sure we ain't bowing to you yeah you that King says boy I hate them boys' attitude they got such a rotten attitude they ain't even got respect for me they tell me we're not careful about how we talk to you we're not careful about how we answer you on this he said but this one thing we know we will not now God said that's my boys right there amen I want you

Christians Brother Brad don't have God that right don't have God maybe they won't hardly be supplied for huh how many knows but if there Christians and they pray God's got his eye on them they've got a guarantee they have a promise in the Bible he will surprise I wouldn't doubt it a bit but hey do y'all need some here yeah that's right what made you come up here I don't know I just felt like

Braham says we are a privileged people very privileged people amen isn't it true that somewhere out there in the world people are like oh you're a white privileged person yeah people want to say oh

there anymore that bridge is going to be done away with when K Christ takes his blood off the Earth amen amen how many knows brother bam said he's seen in the vision blood all across the world holding the wrath of God off the Earth the homos LGB all of them holding the Wrath off but what did he say when that blood is lifted and gone huh when the bride gets taken up that bridge is gone that Mercy's gone God looks down on sin and says me and sin can't dwell in the same space right and he will destroy Sin from off the Earth that's when his wrath will be poured out so we thank God for his his supplies that he supplies for us power loss is that right power loss no power boy is that depressing huh you don't know how many times we've lost power and I go around the corner flip that switch what's wrong oh yeah there's no power I'm going microwave me some food no the microwave don't work turn on the stove going to cook you some food no not even food you can barely eat Foods to go in the closet back there and get me a can of beans open me some ke beans and I probably got to take a knife and Jab it open because my opener is electric nothing can't do nothing can't saw these boards I can't do this I can't do that don't you know that Jesus said that without me you can do nothing you're powerless without me you can't do anything what a terrible feeling amen for it must be for people that don't have power can't call out this little old phone don't work nothing works I'm stranded without Christ you're stranded you're powerless without God you're like a tree that's withered and V that the life has gone off been cut off withered away and dried up no life no Holy Ghost no shouts no Hallelujah dried up like a bunch of Christians so-called that have been cut off from the Holy Ghost is that right and that's what the devil does he tries to cut off your power supply he'll try to get a infraction between you and God so that you don't have that power anymore can't even charge your battery anymore amen but how many's glad for the power of God hallelujah we thank God for the power of almighty God Amen Stand Fast in the power of God Amen cuz you without him you can't do nothing with without power that's one of the most depressing things amen is not to have power the only way you can open up some of your roads sometimes is to have at least some kind of power called the power chainsaw right something run run run run oh we can cut this but took take some kind of power to get you out of there Amen Let Me conclude with this I don't care amen if you look like that look like that area down there where the hurricane come through everything devastated sometimes the Devil Makes that in our lives he absolutely devastate things but I want you to know that we have a Superman amen that is in the business of restoration he can restore I don't care where you're at God will restore your soul he's a god of restoration amen like Legion what a mess he was a hurricane of demons had come over and just taken him over and made a mess out of him but God came and restored him from a frown to a smile from his broken family to reunite it a't that right how many's glad for a God that restores amen say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for restoring my soul like David he was in a hurricane he was in a nightmare he was in absolute storm after he had that with basba and that God just flooded the judgments upon him how many know it was a horrible thing folks go back and read it it's almost hard to read amen terrible things happen Absalon all the way to Absalon whom he loved getting hung and SP spear through and everything else but God restored amen amen but let me just say this don't build back in the same place right you know there I guess there's another hurricane Brewing out there I read it this morning somewhere I hope I believe it they said he has a potential going right through there again he might have the walls up brother Brad walls up here comes another one there he goes again amen you know me and my wife we always say about our father and our some of I says man all these hurricanes comeing they just destroy one after the other why don't they move out of there I guess we got to quit saying that now cuz it don't matter if you're in the mountains of H of North Carolina you can get tore up by them thing is that right oh my mostly mostly in your life don't try to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results a't that right build your hopes on things Eternal maybe you thought oh well I got a sensation and I got happy and I shouted and at a youth banquet camp and I shouted and I strong by and that's just kind of Fizz is out and you wonder where you are don't buil On Emotion build on an experience with almighty God of a daily Walk With Jesus amen I can't I can preach it I can say it but you don't built on Thomas or what he says you built it on the Bible you built your life on this word how many would say Lord help me to do what you said let me build this thing AC according to your code so that when the tribulation is about to hit when they get to surrounding Israel we get to hearing that there may be a couple prophets in Israel well I don't want to hear that I don't want to hear there's a couple prophets over in Israel and doing things oh I can't quit I don't want to be around when all of a sudden this drought that we had all of a sudden the whole earth ain't getting no rain cuz Elijah stopped it and all kinds of pestilence and things like that how scary how terrible it would be to hear that there's prophets over there and the news is saying they're the ones doing it they're the fault because remember Jezebel blamed Elijah right that's right and they're blaming them and blaming them you know where I want to be I want to be eating at the Lamb's supper amen how many knows we're right there woo Sor we're right there we're right there we're right there I wasn't there when Eve fell I wasn't there when Adam fell I wasn't there when they were driven out but I'm here at the end and I want to be a part of when we go back into it how many believ I wasn't at the beginning but I'm here at the end the moment we've all been waiting for all the saints of all history have been waiting for this time this moment these prophecies to be fulfilled so we can go home so we can go home and go back to the Garden of Eden tell that lion to go over there and lay down Ain that right come over here I want to pet that big furry man a that right come over here cheetah lay by

because we don't know what ahead I'll say this what's ahead's scary but you don't have to be fearful why like I said the other day when they were checking me and asking for my ID paying with cash I said what's going on here this is next to the market of Beast where you're going to check what you're buying with your ID ain't that right maybe it was a fluke I don't know what it was but I asked why
