the house of the Lord thank you musicians appreciate the music amen good to see everybody out tonight brother Troy and sister Robin good to see y'all amen praise the Lord hey man good to see everybody out on a Wednesday night so you can be seated for a minute we have uh amen a praise report amen this evening and so we just want to share that with the help of Lord sister Sherry I believe has some news for us and we're gonna just let her speak amen praise the Lord God bless you Sister Sherry a verse that really kind of touched me and it says and it uh I gotta find it again um and God I will praise his word and God I have put my trust I will not flesh can do unto me that's because I've been trusting God through all this and some of you know the story some of you may not all know all of it but I'll try to be brief I started out with going to the hospital and finding out I had a mess on near my Cola colon in the back of my colon it was only mass and I'm told it's no cancer don't worry about it it doesn't it can't be cancer because it doesn't doesn't act like cancer so I'm thinking okay well good thank you Lord I'm not I don't have cancer this is great but I will find out what's wrong so I go to a doctor who I'm sent to and he says well it's a big Mass it's about the size of a saw ball and um but I don't think it really looks like cancer but it could be so he sends me into an oncologist who then sends me to an oncology surgeon the surgeon I have had test taken he looks at it and he says you've got cancer okay thank you Lord I'm I'll praise you anyway because I know nothing happens unless you allow it and so why go and then I finally get to the point he says well I'm going to take it to a board and see if there's something we can do for you so he never calls me back but my own oncologist doctor called him and she says well he said there's nothing more that they can do um and it uh nothing was going to help and that I'm just going to have five to ten years and be happy with it so I said okay Lord that's what you want I'm going to continue to praise you now please understand I'm human so uh Satan really gets into my mind every once in a while and tried to tell me see he didn't love you or he would have healed you and I'm thinking Lord that's not true and I said Satan get out of here I don't need that kind of negativity because I know I'm in God's hand and God's going to take care that's right amen so as of last Sunday there was nothing going to be done so I said okay I'll just live with it it's Monday morning I got a call from my oncology doctor or doctor not the surgeon and she said she took it to her board and they said that there is a pill or a shot that I might be able to take that even though it's a slow moving cancer I've had 15 to 20 years that they might be able to slow it down even more and they hoping to get it so slow that it doesn't grow anymore and if that happens then they'll give me a chemo pill to help get rid of it and then a radiation to make sure there's nothing else going now this is a long process that's not going to happen forever and I can remember over and over again God's telling me be patient be patient it's in his time not my time but I want to thank everybody for your prayers I want to thank you and ask you that please continue to pray that I can keep strong because the strength's not mine it's God's believe me I'm human and I could cry and be sorry for it and say well how could this happen to me but I know that God's in control he's not only in control of me but he's in control of the world but he's in he's in control of me right now and I'm trusting him and that's I'm just happy that now that they have something to find don't maybe help me they said there's no guarantees but there's always a guarantee with God so thank you guys for your prayers and your continued prayers [Applause] many years Michael yeah man let's bow our heads kind Heavenly Father we do thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy for your grace and for being a real God on time God lord Jesus this and father we know that no matter what we go through or what we Face Lord Jesus when we bring all our cares upon you for we know that you care for us Lord Jesus and we just ask God that you would just continue to be with chair in this special way Lord and that we're trusting for her complete healing complete recovery Lord Jesus we ask God tonight that is we have assembled ourselves together that you would speak to our hearts once again Lord speak to our lives changes Lord from what we are to what we should be Lord Jesus knowing god that we never go out those doors the same Lord Jesus we pray father that would be better tonight God bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon the heart to speak tonight that's each one that has made the effort to come you see everything that everybody always does Lord in the effort they make the Lord to support a local body Lord Jesus the Church of God and we appreciate that Lord and we ask God that yours pour out a blessing for each and every person in here Lord we know that you are a God that can heal everybody Lord the whole crowd you can do some something for everybody and Lord we trust that that'll be the case tonight that you'll do something for everyone Lord and we love you and appreciate you blessed now father we ask in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord just really couldn't get away from that last thought Sunday so we will have a part two to the power of a Christian would that be okay amen and I've titled this rendering Satan powerless rendering Satan powerless amen praise the Lord so amen and I was just I had a certain quote in mind amen that I wanted to look up and so forth but before I looked it up there was I uh with the thought that I was going with I thought about a message about the Brandon preached called that day on Calvary amen so I began to search that message out and I just began to scroll down didn't listen to it but let's look at the whole thing and as I begin down going down through there not only that one but many different scriptures that I had thought about but especially that one was right in there amen that's where I found it so I says well Lord I believe that's just you amen amen so amen may God bless you tonight if you will turn your Bibles this evening and we'll go I think we'll start with uh um Revelations let's go all the way to the Book of Revelations we realize that the hour and the day is coming when actually Satan will be put in a pit isn't that right and he will not be able to do any more damage at all amen and we want to look at that and then read over in the New Testament something different that relates to it not in the New Testament but in the Book of Matthew I believe it is 18. Matthew 20 verse 1. and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thou am a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and said to seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no longer till the Thousand Years should be filled fulfilled and after that he must be loosed amen a little season may God has blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated I hadn't really thought about this but I want to talk about three different things as we begin I mean if you'll notice he said talks about having the key of the bottomless pit amen and all I didn't premeditate this one but you know when we think about a key to the bottomless pit and and and and and and Satan get uh thrown into a pit and locked up and I believe the prophet of God said one place he says you know till he'll be put into a place a chain of circumstances a chain of circumstances because he said he won't have anybody to work through anymore hey man he had nobody to work through I mean they all know that the devil has to have somebody or something and there's a lot of things folks that if you're not under the blood and not under the Holy Spirit there's a lot of things the devil has to work on amen so we see that key we also think about how that Christ when he uh sends it into hell we've been given the demonstration and the scripture says that he said when he ascended on high and so forth when he read it wrote in the Book of Revelation she says I have the keys of hell and that isn't that right so Satan I mean Jesus went to hell so to speak and took those keys from the Devil isn't that right how many remembers another place Jesus said to Peter he says I give you the keys to the kingdom amen this this is the one I believe I wanted to read amen and it's found in Matthew 18. we'll read that one because this is right on the area where I wanted to and Miss speaking now I'm mentioning it but I want to read it in Matthew 18 Matthew 18 and 18 I believe it is amen um he says it this way to Peter he says verily verily I say unto you that whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven amen and whatsoever he shall lose on Earth shall be loosed on in heaven and I say unto you that if two or if two of you agree on Earth as touching anything it should and that each day shall ask it shall be done unto them of My Father which is in heaven praise the Lord so we see there that we're given the power to bind how many believe that that we are given the power to bind the enemy Amen in other words we're giving given the power to cast The Devil out amen amen tonight with the help of the Lord with the help of the Lord amen when we talk about rendering the past the devil powerless and how that how that the real believer has uh been called to demonstrate the power according to First Corinthians there Paul said I'd rather until when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I am determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified amen so there's a reason that Paul really didn't want to know a whole lot more than just tell me about his crucifixion tell me about what Christ did amen because how many knows and he and Brad Van preached a message on um uh that day on Calvary and what it really meant because we know that mankind was bound we were we were Bound by the devil how many we were in Fetters of chains of sin that we couldn't get away from we were not free we were bound amen but how many beliefs tonight we're free I mean because of the Cross and so now notice I want to go down to uh verse 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration and of power another place Paul said amen when we preach to you the gospel it did not come in word only but in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost tonight I want to define or perhaps get a little bit more detail about what the power amen what did what it really does what the power and demonstration really is and how it affects us on a personal level amen Hallelujah and I want to say tonight that you know uh Christ when he came he did something so much more than just uh what Israel wanted him to do and that was we'll bow at this time again restore the Kingdom of Israel amen he was coming to do in such a so so great there a purpose amen and we all know we all know what the public God said about how that Jesus Christ on Calvary how did he strip the devil of any power that he had any Authority he absolutely stripped him from amen that's what amen Christ did on Calvary now I want to go to uh Ephesians actually I'm just going to read a quote at this time before we go to the not Ephesians but we go into here brother Bannerman preaching on that day on Calvary I mean now it seems whether bam says he says that it would be a little out of season it this should be preached on Good Friday man but better man says Calvary should be remembered every day amenities that goes along with what Paul said isn't that right amen I really come to you and all I want to know about is Jesus Christ amen if what he did amen amen this should be good now notice that every day and we've heard so much about it read so much about it preachers has preached on it since the beginning of time singers have sang it Through the Ages prophets foretold at 4 000 years before it ever happened and the prophets of this they point back to when it did happen it's so it's such an important day amen it's one of the most important days of all days that God ever let Dawn on the Earth oh my I get a I get a little rebound from that I get I get a little noise from the oil isn't that right why do I get noise from y'all why do I hear an amen or praise the Lord why because you have an experience of what that name is we'd all be quiet in here amen if we didn't speak if I didn't speak from experience to you and preach to you from experience that that day meant something so much for me perfect it changed the whole and oh my let me just say it this way the Bible says the Rocks read the Earth shook the sun went down in the middle of the day didn't it was so dark you could feel it the whole earth it was such a great thing until the old Earth had a prostrations on the feet and just shut down it was such an awesome day amen my because God had did something something happened that changed the course of the world course of history amen praise the Lord let's look at the importance of that day the importance of Calvary but we know that it was only through Calvary that the devil can ever be rendered powerless we see in our day in our age all around us we see people that are absolutely Bound by the devil they do what their feelings are what their emotions are what their Spirits are what their nature is isn't that right amen and it's governed by the devil and I'll tell you what it behooves us to make sure that the devil doesn't have any power over us he has no grip on us because how many believe that we can be absolutely free of his grip we don't have to come under him in no fashion or form I'm told through the prophet of God that if you're part of the body amen because he can't he overcome every devil he overcome everything when he was here on Earth he came overcoming Matthew 5 when he was tempted by lust he was attempted by Pride he was tempted by power and all of the things the devil offered him all the kingdoms he said I do with him but I want to he's seen America he see all the kingdoms he's offered them all but he overcome he overcome Legion and all of those devils amen everything he overcome everything and then when he gives you of himself and when you become part of Jesus is Christ I don't care if you feel like you're just a doormat or you're just a soul under the foot and then I'll tell you what if you nothing but the heel of the foot in the body every devil is still under your control he is still under you but only if you're in the body of Christ that's the only way otherwise he's gonna make you put on another tattoo he's gonna make you run after this as I run after that desire ain't no telling what he'll have you looking like just look around and you'll see what the devil gets people looking like just look around and you'll see how perverted amen and transgender and everything else that you're doing absolutely senseless the poor girls that can't have any sports because our leaders ain't got pain enough to know that you don't put a man up against the woman he has got much brains they might as well quit any sports because the man's gonna come and I don't care what it is a man's gonna outdo a woman huh that's the devil that's what the devil does all of this chaos and mess that you see out there that's the devil doing that [Music] you hardly have anybody even that says anything against it if you do they'll boycott you amen oh my but only through Calgary how many flat for that day on Calvary amen let's talk about something brother Brandon had three different things that he wanted to talk about amen when he talked about that day on Calvary first you went through and how that rehab amen our sins were gonna be erased how did they were going to be forgiven amen and how that we're going to be reconciled to almighty God now that there was a pardon for his children because I'll tell you how many knows that if God don't forgive you of your sins you should you're gonna be guilty you're still gonna be in anguish you're still gonna be feel horrible feel terrible nothing but the blood of Jesus what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood nothing but oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow oh my praise the Lord so let's just go through this Hallelujah now notice I think it's good for us to go back it was the most important day to the human race Calvary was I think it's good for us to go back and examine to see what it means to us I'm sure that in this late hour that we're living in we're seeking very important we are seeking very important uh the very importance of God that we can know every importance of God that we can know and all that we can find out amen we are here to learn it to see what is for us and what God has done for us remember when Jesus died he said it is finished in other words he did everything he could do he paid the price now it's up to people to accept whosoever will let him come now it's up to the people of what they do with it it's done our healing is paid for it's done already our Salvation is done your forgiveness I don't care if you pop well I don't care if you're a murderer I don't care you're the thief on the cross amen when you accept that part and it's over with you can be as happy as a child as free as a child as innocent as a child how many is left for that amen the most important day Calvary if you're ever going to overcome the devil you better go look back at Calvary amen praise the Lord what I got wrote down something about here we have to find out exactly what it's going to take what is it going to take to render Satan powerless amen ah it just comes to me remember the one scripture about church age book you know if if the bride the church gets a real revelation of who what the devil is amen who she is and what she stands for and that she can do to Greater Works amen she begin to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her isn't that how you want him I want the devil powerless he will put you a frown on your face like you ain't never said it'll drag the floor the devil make you sad depressed make life not worth living make you suicidal oh it's just terrible terrible terrible Jesus comes to give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's what Christ come that you might have life not even I have it more abundantly amen that's what he said to Jesus said the thief comes not but to kill to steal and to destroy that's all the devil is he goes about like roaring lying seeking whom he can devour amen praise the Lord now notice and I'll just add this in here I like this quote all that we can find out learn about see what's for us see what Christ has done for us see what he promised to do for us that's what we come to church for that's why preacher preaches that's why he studies and meditates the scriptures I was doing that and I said boy that is good for me six for inspiration is because he is a public servant of God to God's people and he's trying to find something that God would have to say to his people something that would help them amen oh my maybe it would be to condemn them of their sins but would be a help to raise them up oh my preacher he'll preach on sin he'll preach on all everything that's wrong but he'll also give you a way out tell you how to overcome that and how to better yourself we're here to better ourselves not worsen ourselves amen raise him up then they might forsake their sins and to raise up to serve the Lord a minister should seek those things praise the Lord you better bam on the day of Calvary one thing he got into was you know how that people are totally unsatisfied dissatisfied people he says that's the reason many times today that a sinner is still wandering about reminds me of the scripture says you know is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there how many of these guys oh this is a doctor's office this is the hospital you have come to the right place amen maybe an ambulance didn't train you here but whoever brought you here you are here amen and there's a medicine here that can help you that can heal you but brother bam said he says so many people will come to the doorstep but they won't even go into the office doctor says come on in let me diagnose you they'll even get diagnosed and everything the doctor will hand them the medicine say take it but they won't take it will they get well done now your people will sit and defuse it and die because they don't take the medicine they don't take the inoculation that God made on Calvary Hallelujah I was 20 years old when I took that inoculation I'm 60 something now and I'm telling you it still holds it's still good it's good for a lifetime it'll be good for eternity does something to you mother Peter but if I told you there's inoculation now after a couple of days it kind of wears off you know after a year or two you just don't feel the inoculation anymore it doesn't work anymore that's not right you disagree with that [Laughter] I disagree with that this inoculation don't wear off this inoculation if anything it gets better with time it gets better oh Mark can I just preach listen it's kind of like wine they said you like that old one it gets better with time well I'm telling you what Amanda my long Great Ghost the more real it is the more you're a Christian the longer you are and you realize God takes you from this from that and it carries you through amen the better it gets it doesn't lose its power the blood blood of Jesus Christ shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God be saved to send more amen so got the saving power folks Peter preached them on the day of Pentecost and three thousand Souls were saved isn't that right he went to the house of Cornelius preached the gospel and while he was still preaching the Holy Ghost fell on him let me tell you something how many beliefs tonight that same thing Can Happen by the preaching and the foolishness the preaching amen people are saved Holy Ghost fall on them change him forever amen we still got a pool of water right back here we can fill up and baptize you people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right we'll get into that laterally so listen so listen oh my now notice he goes to talking about he says you know the reason that many times the sinner was still wondering about he said he'll say a beautiful young girl will cut off her locks of her hair to be popular paint up her face to make her look pretty put on clothes to show the form of her being because it's the only thing that she can find trying to find something trying to find something Amen to satisfy her when she can cause men to whistle at her wave at her flirt with her young men will do the same thing with women try to make himself attractive to her oh y'all are quiet now neighbors will build a house and fix it a certain way because it'll look better and the other neighbors play would never satisfied certain way because it looks better than a neighbor's place it's all the time we're seeking something amen a young lady again he goes in the next one young later will find that another lady's more popular than she is in other words you know young ladies last time they'll see another one oh I wish I was pretty as her huh folks I don't care you know there's nothing finding a girl that's satisfied with herself don't have a complex about yourself God made you the way you are ain't enough cake and makeup and painted the paint store to ever fix you up any different that'll ever change you amen I'll tell you what when all that gets washed off and your boyfriend sees you yeah yeah isn't that right just be what you are be happy amen but you never will be never will people never will be happy unless they find satisfaction the true satisfaction the neighbor will find a house that looks better than his the woman will find another woman dressed a certain way that looks better than she does and it's something in us that's seeking out for something and it shows that we're lost we want to find that something that will bring us to satisfaction that'll fill that spot of hunger in there huh that it just seems that we can't find it human beings tried it Through the Ages they went forward they cried they got everything in all of how to do amen but still they did me find that wandering about through the world finally one day that's that day at Calvary there was one that came from Glory by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God who came from glory and Calvary was formed that was the day that the price was paid the sin question was settled forever and it up opened up a way unto you that we're hungering and thirsting for and it brought a place of satisfaction amen I don't care if you go to church belong to church I'm a message believer whatever if you don't come to that Holy Spirit feeling you won't ever be satisfied you can get a wife you can get husband you can get a friend you can get a new job you can get this Saturday out of but you'll never be satisfied amen no man that's ever come and visited Calvary and see in the way that it was can ever be the same everything that he ever desired I like this quote everything that he ever desired or long for is met when he reaches that place Hallelujah aren't you glad that there's a place amen that you can go that can absolutely fill that long and that's in your heart feel that desire that's in your heart tell that void that's in there the crazy stuff that people will do for happiness and it never makes him happy they never get happiness they never get true Joy because there's only one place that you'll find it and it's because of what Jesus did on Calvary amen praise the Lord amen everything that you ever long or desired for was meant if you'll get to that place it was such an important day and such an important that it shook the world it shook the world like it was never shook before when Jesus died and paid the sin question this sinful world had a blackout the sun went down in the middle of the day it had a nervous prostration the Rocks shook the mountains ran the red dead bodies bursted for us from the cave and what did it do God zeroed in on Calvary he wounded that animal called Satan forever amen he wounded him forever now he's been more vicious than ever because it brought light to the human race can we say it brought Joe to the human race it brought peace to the human race it brought Victory to the human race it brought Redemption to the human race it brought reconciliation to the human race what Adam lost we we got restored back oh let me say it again and again and again and again amen what Adam Moss has been restored back we have been restored back to fellowship because of it we are no longer bound by the devil to have to be rocking around sad amen and blue and depressed because I'll tell you this just having to work and having jobs having to meet this requirement that requirement and having this go wrong and that go wrong and more go wrong it goes right causes us to have Allah who face are you with me that's why we have long faiths we'd all be a lot happier if we didn't have all of this if we were in God's civilization hey we're going to fellowship and worship to mourning and guess what tomorrow morning we're going to get up and go lay before the Lamb of God and worship him for a while and then we're going to go and then we but here we are all bad that's right I care so many times choke us but I believe it says it sometimes it even chokes out people amen people's spiritual life gets choked out because of the cares of life why do you think that Paul he didn't have a whole lot of ties to the world no he didn't have a whole lot he just go from place to place even the early church sold the houses and everything and you know didn't have a place to go one man one time set the Holy Ghost he said made a mistake you made a mistake didn't have didn't do that but yet he said the brother man says God don't make mistake the Holy Ghost didn't make mistakes they went and spread the gospel everywhere then amen all right let's go on praise the Lord you love him it wounded that animal oh he is an animal like a roof hour folks I'm telling you the devil will destroy your life he will destroy you the only thing that holds you together is God look at it look at the decision that's taken I was thinking you know this is just kind of on the side the way that God meant it for it to be he meant for us to for young people to get married to find you a husband to find your wife to raise children isn't that right that's the way God meant to do and then for you to raise him in such a way that they when one of these days you're going to go off the scene but you need to have something decent for them how many knows it man who'd even want to raise kids hardly nowadays you probably should if you still have are you married no but it's harder because you're like Ma I'm gonna have to raise him in this you better keep a Title reign on him hello but that's where it was meant to be for us to think about our children and their children but is our government thinking about that no did you think about their selfish selves destroy the family unit you destroyed a family unit you destroy your nation you destroy your neighborhood and boy they are destroying our kids before they ever even get out of school they don't stand a chance they're going to have warped Minds before the evenings come out amen let me tell you something it's no wonder that they're they're in the mental state that they are you think they're happy no they're not happy let me go on this now notice now he's been more vicious since then because it brought light to the human race anyone knows it that wounded animal is more vicious isn't that right crawling around with his back broke you don't think he was more vicious since then how about the 68 million Christians that Satan slaughtered down through the Dark Ages it was vicious burn them at the stake feed him the Lions have people all up in that Auditorium or in that Coliseum man just packed out and and watching them kill each other yeah yeah and then they're just feasting on blood the people were as bad as their leader was to love to watch somebody have to die Christians to get killed vicious Satan is a vicious amen look at what we got going on our crime rate our murder rate people killing each other amen criminals that kill others in the courtroom have no uh remorse whatsoever an animal vicious that's what the devil is that's not God amen all right now notice Satan was knocked out at Calvary the Earth proved that it was the greatest price that was ever prayed paid and the only one that could pay it how many knows nobody could ever pay it nobody else could and that's why God made it that way now notice when the doctor gives a man an anesthesia he knocks him out before he can do any before he can do it and what when God gave an operation for the church The World God of anesthesia and nature had a convulsion so to speak no wonder God in human flesh was dying it was the hour that the world had looked for yet many of them did not know it look at it look at it today Jesus Christ come and proved himself alive the way that he did an RNA Discerning your thoughts and intents of the heart raising The Healing The Sick by the millions did the very same thing and people still don't recognize it look at it today many look for these things and yet they don't recognize him they don't realize the way out they're still trying to seek pleasures and things of the world trying to find their way out isn't it something don't you just want to have a voice to say hey World hey everybody there is a way out there is a way for you to have joy for you to be happy for you to be free for you to have peace of mind when you lay down in your bed there is a way all you got to do is accept it and receive it it's what we have heard for for the last two thousand years the great wonderful story of Jesus coming to the Earth amen praise the Lord notice that day it was a death blow to Satan's power it ended everything oh I can see him there he was this he was Eden's lamb Christ was Eden's lamb from the very first shadow that come you know that he cometh when Able by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain he must have tied a grapevine around the Lamb's neck huh how many knows Abel had a revelation that there was going to be a lamb come and it was going to be slain for his sins God had revealed to him about the substitute isn't that right and talk him up on the Rock took a rock in his hand for a lance and pulled his little head back and chopped and hacked him until he died and his wool bathed with his own blood he wallowed in his own blood it was a shadow but on that day at Calvary there wasn't the Lamb of this Earth but it was the Lamb of God that was dying wallowing in his own blood he was hacked and chopped and beat and spit on and slammed and smacked and everything in the world and that blood dropping off of his locks when Abel's lamb died it died speaking in unknown language that Abel could not understand it was bleeding and when God lamb died that they had Calvary he spoke in an unknown language that no one understood him my God my God why has Thou forsaken me it was God's lamb hacked to Pieces chopped up he was the very lamb that Abel had in mind when he seen the promised seed of the woman he was the lamb that Daniel saw when he was hewed out of a mountain without hands he was a wheel in the middle of a wheel that the prophet Isaiah says all they foresaw was met on that day that day on Calvary it brought that great thing and it broke the back of Satan amen praise be to God amen now notice now first we seek him talking about what that day meant second we should see what that day has done for us now third let's look at what we ought to do for that day we ought to do what we ought to do first we should look into it it's a great day greatest day of all days sin price was settled Satan's power was broken now we want to see what we should do in return amen in return now in return it's when Jesus died at Calvary on Calvary that day he not only paid the price for our sins but he also paid the price and listen to this made a way that we could follow him amen how many beliefs Jesus hello me come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden now he did that for us now what do we do amen now listen now there's where we lose our position if we don't watch we try to look back to what he was to what we was we try to look back to what we was isn't that why the devil's always doing in our minds he's always trying to take us back make us look at our faults our failures I mean you'll never be a happy Christian if you focus on your faults folks I don't like to even think of I'm blocking them out right now because when you go even thinking about the stupid stuff huh some really really things that you absolutely regret we should have never done but we don't look at that do we no you can't never be a happy person looking back you'll never get bitter by Looking Back amen as long as we look back to what we was the sacrifice don't mean nothing to us amen oh can't you see a church I wouldn't try to do the job I can and neither can you there's no need of trying you're lost to begin with as long as you look at what you've done but you don't look at what you've done you look at what he did for you he looked at that day on Calvary how many knows it makes all the difference in the world it's kind of like you got to forgive yourself isn't it it's kind of like you got to forgive yourself because a lot of people oh I don't think he'll forgive me you're not forgiving yourself because he is willing by the thing I've just done too much no you haven't if you still got a desire in your heart at all just a little tinkle all you need a little Trinkle in your heart to want to serve God that means that God will forgive you for it because I believe that if you truly had cost you would never desired you'd have no tingle at all you wouldn't believe it for a minute but if you'll know that God will forgive he is so abundant in forgiveness it's the most forgiving God there are there is there is no other God but he's a very forgiving God put it that way he's very forgiven he's more forgiving than any of us are he's more willing to forgive I mean even that church did not think that Paul should be no leader after he persecuted the church consented to the stoning of Stevens and took everybody's coat while they went over there stoned Stephen he was a part of it too he was just as guilty as the one that threw the Rock he was a murderer and everything else but God forgive him amen praise be to God so now notice don't look at what you are what you were not I just maybe maybe let me just um let me finish this and then I want to go get my scripture side of things now notice we wouldn't try to do the job but you know don't look at what you've done look what he did it paid your price it settled that question do you though your sins be a Scarlet they'll be white as snow though they're red light Crimson they'll be quite like wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven amen and anything that's forgiven is remitted and forgot about amen then what does it do it gives you after that condition his Spirit to follow him to do as he did for others who is Following on praise be to God I kind of went in this direction but I wanted to bring another side of this okay and I'll continue on this here perhaps in a minute first of all we know that this power and I told you I wanted to kind of go into detail earlier I want to go into that detail now that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God in other words how do we what do what happens when we demonstrate the power of almighty god well you know we could say well that you know move mountains and raise the dead and heal the sick and so forth but you know there's greater things than that there's much greater things than raising the dead and Healing The Sick and and moving mountains and so forth because all that is temporary if you get healed you'll die again if you raise from that you'll die again but there's something greater and one of the greatest things now notice let's talk about this power that Paul talked about amen according as his power Peter said in first through II Peter 1 and verse 3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness how many please God doesn't just do a halfway job when he gives you something he gives you everything that you have need of for godliness and for life everything through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding and great and precious promises that the that uh that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature I mean those they'll never overcome any other way unless you've got the life that Jesus had when he overcame y'all remember brother Ben what he said about the watermelon or or Beethoven if you have the spirit of Beethoven amen you're going to write music if you have a Dillinger amen you're going to have guns to shoot people if you have a wide herb you're going to have a spirit of that and whatever Spirit you have is you have an edge of nature with that Spirit now and I thought about this there's just the one of the greatest forces what do we say about Mother Nature it was one of the greatest forces that there is is Mother Nature your nature your nature is the most powerful thing that there is I mean it's just so hard for you to fight your nature it's just your nature huh Paul said you know and you hathy quickened who were once dead in trespasses and sin where any times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we had our life or conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath oh my folks if you could see me at 17 years old right now it wouldn't be very pleasant it wouldn't be very good our Bob looked like a girl I had hair down to here down on my own long hair and everything else served the devil with my nature you know and you know brother bear I'm talking about how that you know where he compared us to Eagles in the chicken yard right but I I I I don't know let's just put it this way let me re put my own thought in this we're like a sheep we're like a sheep with a wolf nature uh where a sheep with a wolf nature now notice what it says here Paul said we were there we were by Nature the children of Wrath in other words we had a nature of Wrath but how many knows that the prophet said you know that seed that sound on the inside it's got to be a seed of God we're either sheep or we're not sheep so we actually are sheep with a wolf nature and God has to come down and what he has to do he has to change our nature oh yeah that is a true demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost when you see a heart that become a saint when you become a sinner and when you see a sinner becoming a saint amen somebody that was violent wretched I mean as could be God comes out and changes your marriage desires cause you can't fight tonight you can't fight your desire amen you've got to have the desire of the Holy Ghost amen it says if you'd be led by this beard you're not subject to the law of sin of death yeah Hallelujah most powerful force in the world and if God changed God has to come and change your desires you won't change people you know but just by shaking hands they're making some Reformation that doesn't change they have to have a nature change and and Peter here talking about that power that divine power has given us all to things that we might be what he gave us that power that we might be partakers of that divine nature in other words you've got to have his life how many believe that it's got to be God's life nothing else will do people are you ready let's go on and I wanted to go with uh talk to you about now I'm going to just say this because this is really what I had in my mind isn't it nice would you rather see your husband or your wife amen maybe do a great miracle but maybe they're just mean on their snake it's just ornery and man they're hard to get along they're rude maybe your husband's rude wife's food whichever it might be but isn't it nice when that person and it goes from rude to kind it's sweet loving I mean like somebody that's patient huh why are you all so quiet here I ain't talking about nobody it's for all of us you know I try to do that with my mind let me use it I try to use that for my Lord help her to see that power of my nature change and my my kindness that'd be more kind because the Bible said be kind one another and the Fruit of the Spirit and the fruit of the fruit of the flesh undulations I was going to go through but I just want to mention it you know it's so nice when you see somebody amen I'm sure Legion hello it was so mean until he was in the rocks and the and and the tombs right he lived in the tombs and his family couldn't he couldn't live with nobody he'd go out on the road and beat people down he jumped on people it wasn't he and man I'll tell you what we went down the other road we went down to Hallelujah Avenue instead of Legion Street we go the long way around ain't nobody going down that road he was me but after Jesus healed him he went home and he was kind and he was gentle that's the way with the sinner I don't care what you are but you get the Holy Ghost and it'll change your nature that's the most powerful work that can be done it's to change your nature from a pig to a sheep or from a wolf Bible says you know what there's strife and contention there's every evil work hello we've all been at that place of strife and contagion and it's a terrible thing and we've been people that are just so nice and kind I don't know about you but I don't hang around that kind it's kind in gentle I don't want to hate strife bitterness and emulation and wrath all of the fruits of this flesh that he talked about all of the nature of the flesh to the nature of the spirit how many beliefs we've been changed from the nature of the flesh to the nature of the spirit and that is truly what we see in each other that's a demonstration that's one of them anyway the demonstration of the Holy Ghost yeah that's right it'll make your kids if they come to the Altar and they get more of God it'll make your kids be more obedient to their parents they'll be willing to do what they're told a whole lot better are y'all listening children and you'll say wow my little Sonny Boy my little daughter let's change something's happening too huh why because God got a hold of them amen I thought that's so wonderful aren't you glad for what Peter said giving us a part of his divine nature laughs oh my we're going to go a little long tonight is that okay okay so now after he gives you after he gives you that forgiveness of sins and so forth he says after that condition then he gives his Spirit to follow him and as to do as he did how many believes that The Works that I do shahidu also that's what Jesus said and Greater Works Than This D shall you do someone said how can you stand to let somebody call you such a bad name because you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become Sons the trouble of it is with the church has forgot that they are Sons see your son your taking Christ 's place I will be with you even in you to the end of the world amen how many believe that the pope claims this position the Catholic Church claims this position vicarious freely D on the top of the Pope's Crown instead of the Son of God hello instead of the son of God you're taking Christ's place in other words Christ was uh here on Earth in the flesh of his body but now he's in his church amen by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body amen your son so don't live for yourself live for others my brother Ben and I can live for this brother because sure he is a nice man he says that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that man who would kill you if he could amen that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives up this wool then you're looking towel Calvary now listen to this we're going to get to my to to the quote that I had been looking for now I hope this helps you to get you to the place that's what the Tabernacle here that's what all people has got to do is find what you are and what's your purpose Church isn't just coming to church to play music and sing songs church is a place where judgment comes begins at the house of God and we must reckon ourselves dead and alive in Christ amen how many knows did every Avenue of the flesh you got to watch you got to be filled with the spirit and watch every part of your flesh don't give the devil any way to get in that's the only way you'll render the devil powerless your emotions your feelings your pasts whatever it might be hello all has to be surrendered to God now notice alive in Christ then he made a way that we could sacrifice ourselves first this service and follow him if we follow him we lead to life that he led that's wonderful amen and now notice Jesus said that that day that he would separate the people like sheep from goats amen and he would say to the goats stand on my left side and the Sheep stand on my right side uh oh the goats on the left he said and he'll say to them depart from me because I was hungry and you didn't feed me I was in prison and you did not visit me I was naked and you didn't call me I was thirsty and you gave me that drink I was sick you didn't visit me so apart from me and on the sheep he said I was hungry and you fed me I was naked you got me called me I was thinking you ministered to me and noticed and don't fail to get this church keep this in your heart forever it was so unconsciously done amen it was so and I like to think they did it because it was just there nature how many believes it has to be your nature now this is a really Sticky Thing it's a fine line it's a real Revelation for us because remember one place it says that they'll come to me on that day and say haven't we cast out devil have we done Mighty works and haven't we done all these things oh they did they realize they were doing it and they you know they weren't doing it unconsciously they were trying to use that thing and that was going to get him to Heaven can we say that it wasn't their nature now listen to what the prophet says and man that gives you something or other because you ought to do it a man that feeds you because you ought to do it he's got a selfish idea it should be your very life your very action I mean those most of the time people when they do something for you or whatever it is a lot of times it's well I expect the favor back or you're looking for a favor if you are looking for a favor back you ain't got no reward coming at all amen that's the way how many places that we all we're all that we're here I believe if anybody any of us needs us anything you wouldn't have to coax us or we didn't have no thinking about we'd do it because it's our nature amen now notice and it was so surprising to the sheep that they said Lord when were we when were you hungry and we fed you when were you hungry and we fed you and so forth and closed and thirsty and gave you a drink when did we Minister it was so automatically out of love it's just their life lived in them God let the people see what Calvary did for us so automatically when were you Lord we never knew you now notice and then so much as you've down under these you have done it unto me unselfish life not the second thought not to think about it but you are so dead to the things of this world and so alive in Christ and so walking on that Highway that these things just come in are an automatic thing but it says I'll tell you I like what I just go through today Amen in the morning and go down my knees and say Lord It's a good time to pray about noon or whatever I know what I want to pray it doesn't even have to be in them new I'll be out there in my own Barn they're in that little compartment a certain little room there if I get half the chance on the old on there on that Soulful and crazy Lord you know let me I won't talk to you for a little bit huh I remember brother Brown says when you come by to church he says stop there come over here to The Altar and pray for a while I try to remember a lot of times I remember oh yeah that's prophet and I'll say it's not let me let me do what the prophet said amen because sometimes we get so busy we don't but how many knows you want to do it just automatically just automatically hey this is just it's what I am not something that you force yourself sometimes we have to you know either oh men come Wednesday nights oh I'm glad to go to church it's automatic or do we have to say oh my God I have to force myself tonight amen sometimes we feel that way don't we you know but just odd It's gotta be your life it's your nature when we pray for another when Peter uh Peter knew this nature didn't he he had so much of the life of Jesus Christ he didn't have to go pray when that man was impotent there and he couldn't walk and so forth by the way the December and so forth and you know and and he was asking for alms you know he says help me help me help me I can't walk you know and Peter perceived that he had faith and he says well I'm sorry son we're broke this morning we ain't got no we spent maybe our last 10 cents for for our breakfast we ain't got a dime to give you are you sure that pretty sure because the Bible says he told him silver and gold we don't have any we have none but such as we have we give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk the man jumped up and leaped and he said now I'm getting me a job I ain't gonna never beg again huh what was it with Peter it was just automatic how many please that's the way we ought to be or this brother or this Sister's Secret or whatever you know it's just and the name of Jesus Christ you know just do it automatically see we but what we do half the time we're we we we we're we're beat before we ever even ask well now I don't know if I'm holy enough for this or if I'm live bright enough for this and I guess I'll try to ask God but you don't probably have lost it all already you've done doubted your to yourself in the first just do what he said how many people just do what's in here follow the leading of the spirit amen because that is what's going to render the devil powerless nothing else God's life is the only thing that'll rendered the devil powerless and you have to live it by day amen how many of those oh my let me try to finish here all right so unconsciously that's right so surprising the Sheep when did we ever do it oh my now notice now I use I know I say well whatever the Lord wants me to if the Lord wants me to do that I'll do that and he says you're just part of him it's his spirit's in you and you actually and you act the way he acted did you get it there's a way that seems right unto man but then thereof is the ways of death now that down Cal repeat the price so that we could be that way not saying you know we know Jones one time she was out of code and I went and bought her some coal ah I tell you I seen the brother that needed a suit of clothes and I went and got him a suit of clothes bless God I'm a Christian oh my you selfish poor miserable person you hypocrite huh that's what brother Brown says don't let your right hand know what your left hand does amen nor you left what's your right hand does you don't brag about little things that you do amen you just you're just so automatically dead in Christ till you do it anyhow now I love this it's your nature I mean you see how long my thought was on the nature part and the Lord let me down this road and I said boy that's just perfect amen it's your nature it's your makeup you do it anyhow it's just the life that lives in you you're completely yielded to that spirit and it just lives itself in you sheep on one side one will say Lord we did this and Lord we did that he's hitting apart from me you work yourself and they make good day I never knew you if the church can ever get to those fundamental facts that it's not something that you try to do you work yourself up to do is something that's born in you amen Lord help us ah I'm gonna say Lord help me help me to be that way it's just something that's born in you praise be to God how many believe this is the way of a birth Hallelujah now notice in closing last quote last page should I say we look at it and we say oh yes that's wonderful what Christ did on Calvary if that Son of God had to go to Calgary for crucifixion then every son that comes must go to a Calvary he must also have a Calvary you must have that day on Calvary well I thought he went to Calvary for me do you realize Jesus said he that kicks not up his cross and follow me in that worthy of me in other words there's a cross for you there's a dying for you there's a dying for me how many beliefs we could see Lord I need to have a little bit more of a Calvary I need to die to myself more or take all of that fruit of that flesh leg Let It Go by the wayside so that I can have the fruit of the spirit and be completely Victorious I've got to have that day at Calvary God settles the same sin question Not Shake Hands with the preachers not be shook into the church or come by a letter or by profession but by a birth amen Jesus said unless you are born again and ye shall in the wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven amen praise the Lord then from that automatically we're living Christian lives and here's a real good point now notice the Greater Works was to have power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer that was not the Greater Works but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost is coming is coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Gallery meant it took stoop degraded men and women Paul Peter fisherman Tax Collectors cheaters and everything else and lifted them into a place to be sons of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving Holy Ghost to obedient Believers like Peter did at the house of Cornelius while you yet speak these words the Holy Ghost was Departed Paul Acts 19 remember those disciples he came and have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost Church of the Living God is to impart not just healing amen but to impart something that lasts for eternity Jesus says Greater Works than these shall ye do how many knows you said that men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say to this sick woman laying here I can pray the prayer of faith and shall be egged that's a say heal that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but he said greater than initial you do because I'm going to give you power not only to raise up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternally poor blind wretched people how do you miss it don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that we could ever happen is to impart eternal life to people and I kind of thought you know and if you have and when you receive that eternal life how many knows that's what changes your nature you got to have that nature change from your old nature to the nature of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord God bless you let's stand Hallelujah what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God can Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever since you retained to them they are retained here's what the Catholic church and many others made their big mistake they go out and say well I forgive you of your sin that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost what shall we do to be saved how we can how can we get this that you got he laid down to prescription he told them what to do repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost for the promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as the many as the Lord Our God shall call that is the prescription on how to get eternal life how to have your sins forgiven there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved amen let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus We Praise Your Name Lord thank you Lord for letting us know amen praise the Lord amen there in Revelations he were given the key to lock that devil up amen Jesus gave Peter to the keys to the kingdom of heaven so that we can open up and get into the kingdom of heaven and render the devil powerless tie him up for a while amen oh my wake wake up tomorrow morning say devil you don't know what to do with me do you know now but you don't know what to do with me do you what did the prophet say man could live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him amen praise God let's buy our heads Lord Jesus we come before you once again thank the Lord Jesus to have this little Oasis in the middle of the week Lord to come together and Lord have your Holy Spirit speak to our hearts once again Lord Jesus and all of us can say Lord Jesus help us God lord if there's anybody in here Lord tonight that needs a little bit more of that nature change Lord may they raise your hand and say God there's still some nature that needs to be changed Lord there's a little bit of an Avenue in that channel that the devil tries to trick me with and use Lord I pray God take that away Lord and fill it with your spirit Lord let us stop the devil in every area that he might come in and try to come in and disturb us and to be able to get to us Lord and we do know that he's got a Punch coming so he's not powerless and yet you know he's still got a punch
