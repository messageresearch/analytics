[54:20] in huh
[54:21] amen if the weatherman is right we're

[54:25] perhaps so y'all cover them spigots up
[54:28] amen
[54:29] amen gotta be be prepared amen amen be
[54:34] prepared for what's coming and so that's
[54:36] really what I was speaking on tonight is
[54:38] preparation amen
[54:40] um so anyway I just want to announce
[54:43] that our sister Johnny is in her new
[54:46] body tonight amen
[54:48] so uh we're just so glad to see her go
[54:51] in the Lord and be ready amen
[54:55] and so we do miss her already amen and
[54:58] so it's certainly you know kind of you
[55:02] know it can really definitely you miss
[55:03] her amen
[55:04] but uh the funeral will be next
[55:07] Wednesday not uh this is Wednesday so
[55:09] yeah next Wednesday at Stokes Chapel
[55:12] Church it'll be a graveside uh just a
[55:15] graveside service
[55:16] and our sister Mandy has asked me to
[55:20] speak a few scriptures maybe make a few
[55:23] comments there so
[55:25] um and then also I asked what we could
[55:27] do if we could do maybe the food or
[55:29] something and maybe have potluck and
[55:32] then my wife she says well let's not do
[55:34] that let's just have a uh Caterers on
[55:37] what's up that was a good idea because
[55:40] we don't want to put any kind of any
[55:42] load on them and then with it being
[55:44] midweek and everything we'll just have
[55:47] it catered and so we was going to do it
[55:48] for 100 people but Mandy said 60 or 70
[55:51] will probably be plenty so we're going
[55:53] to have it catered from Roy's barbecue
[55:55] and so uh that's going to be taken care
[55:58] of for the Browns at the church no
[56:00] problem doing that and so we're glad for
[56:02] that amen and then the only thing I can
[56:05] think of would be probably uh now next
[56:09] next Wednesday since that's uh we're
[56:11] going to be over there doing that on
[56:13] Wednesday I don't want to not have
[56:15] service all week so let's have a Tuesday
[56:16] night service here would that be all
[56:18] right we'll do a Tuesday night service
[56:20] here and anybody that wants to bring
[56:22] some desserts you can bring desserts if
[56:25] you can't make it to the funeral or
[56:26] whatever if you want to just leave the
[56:28] desserts down at fellowship hall or
[56:30] something you want to bring some do that
[56:32] amen but if you're coming you want to
[56:33] bring a desserts that's the only thing
[56:34] that they don't Supply and I'd like to
[56:36] have some of it imminent for everybody
[56:38] so remember desserts
[56:41] um I don't know about drinks I think
[56:43] they're going to have tea there and
[56:44] everything but we may take some some
[56:46] bottled Cokes or something two liters or
[56:48] whatever but
[56:49] um but that's next Tuesday okay
[56:55] huh
[56:56] thank you yeah at one o'clock it's going
[56:59] to be one o'clock in the afternoon
[57:01] uh it's when when did when we're gonna
[57:03] start up there all right so it's
[57:06] supposed to be about 12 degrees so bring
[57:08] it over
[57:09] coats amen but anyway
[57:12] uh sister Johnny she really wanted to
[57:15] she almost made it back into the church
[57:17] here you know she was getting around
[57:18] pretty good and then of course things
[57:20] went South again you know the other way
[57:22] and uh she was just getting weaker and
[57:25] weaker it was just for her time to go
[57:26] and so amen we got to pray with her
[57:29] about 10 o'clock somewhere in there the
[57:31] morning uh before she went that evening
[57:34] amen and so just pray with her and so
[57:37] forth and got to visit her at the
[57:39] hospital Russellville amen and just
[57:41] talked to her there while she was still
[57:43] very responsive prayed with her there
[57:45] amen and talked to her and it just
[57:47] seemed like she her soul was ready and
[57:49] she was
[57:50] but
[57:51] maybe for her new body amen so amen we
[57:54] know it's real amen and so we're very
[57:57] grateful to have the hope that we have
[57:59] amen in Christ Jesus amen
[58:02] amen so if you will stand with me we'll
[58:04] just get into the word of the Lord
[58:06] amen now this thought came to me amen I
[58:09] don't know you know uh but about prep
[58:12] being prepared you know and I got to

[59:09] father only but as the days of Noah were
[59:13] so shall also the coming of the
[59:15] son of man be and as in the days they
[59:18] were before the flood they were eating
[59:20] and drinking marrying and giving in
[59:22] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[59:23] into the ark
[59:26] and knew not until the flood came and
[59:27] took them all away
[59:29] so shall also the coming of the son of
[59:31] man be then shall two be in the field
[59:34] the one shall be taken and the other
[59:35] left two women shall be grinding at the
[59:37] meal the one shall be taken and the
[59:39] other one left which therefore for you
[59:41] know not one hour the Lord does come but
[59:45] know this that if the good men of the
[59:46] house would have known and what watch
[59:48] the thief would come he would have
[59:50] watched and would not have suffered his
[59:52] house to be broken up therefore for be
[59:56] also ready for in such an hour as ye
[59:58] think not the son of man cometh amen who
[1:00:00] then is a wise foreign
[1:00:03] a faithful and wise servant whom his
[1:00:06] Lord hath made ruler over his household
[1:00:08] to give them moot meat in due season
[1:00:10] blessed is that servant whom his Lord
[1:00:12] when he cometh shall find so doing amen
[1:00:15] may God bless you
[1:00:18] you can be seated amen I'll read that
[1:00:21] one more scripture verily I say unto you
[1:00:23] that he shall make him ruler over all
[1:00:25] his Goods amen
[1:00:28] laughs
[1:00:30] and I was just thinking one of the first
[1:00:33] things is uh that Jesus the very very
[1:00:36] thing that Jesus says about the Rapture
[1:00:38] and really tonight this is some
[1:00:42] help us should help us with the help of
[1:00:44] the Lord about being ready for the
[1:00:47] Rapture amen how many wants to be ready
[1:00:49] for the rapture
[1:00:50] amen and so we want to take a look of
[1:00:54] how we can be ready amen be ye therefore
[1:00:56] ready and that will not maybe look at it
[1:00:58] in a little perhaps a different way that
[1:01:01] uh uh another different way that I've
[1:01:04] preached it before perhaps should I say
[1:01:07] because I've preached it before but
[1:01:09] perhaps not just in this way but we want
[1:01:11] to talk about that Readiness and then
[1:01:13] and I just got it in my mind while I was
[1:01:15] back there studying because I was just
[1:01:17] going to read verse 44 be also ready and
[1:01:20] so that Jesus is saying that that
[1:01:22] Readiness is to be prepared now
[1:01:24] on the internet reservations amen how
[1:01:28] many knows when you make reservations it
[1:01:30] is are making preparations amen you're
[1:01:34] making preparations
[1:01:36] somewhere to spend the night or whatever
[1:01:39] it might be so reservations amen you
[1:01:42] have to have preparations amen and also
[1:01:45] this is a process so this getting ready
[1:01:47] is a process amen for this great event
[1:01:49] that lies ahead and Jesus here as I said
[1:01:53] I was just going to read that verse but
[1:01:56] then I got to thinking about what he was
[1:01:58] talking about in just a little bit
[1:01:59] before that when he says know this that
[1:02:02] if the Goodman of the house would have
[1:02:03] known in which watch the thief would
[1:02:05] come he would not have he would have
[1:02:06] watched and would not have suffered his
[1:02:08] house would be broken up and I said
[1:02:09] there's also an example of what Jesus
[1:02:12] used an example of a thief coming into
[1:02:15] your house isn't that right
[1:02:18] amen so if you knew that a thief was
[1:02:22] coming to your house and he was going to
[1:02:24] break in amen perhaps he was going to
[1:02:27] have a knife perhaps he was going to
[1:02:29] have a gun and you knew he was coming
[1:02:32] what would you do
[1:02:37] you can only imagine you you know you'd
[1:02:40] probably have everybody available right
[1:02:44] helping you up
[1:02:47] ah
[1:02:48] because you
[1:02:51] can we say that that Thief would really
[1:02:54] be in for a surprise
[1:03:00] now I don't know about you but I don't
[1:03:02] treasure the thought of getting stuck
[1:03:03] through the heart with a knife in the
[1:03:05] middle of the night into my bed
[1:03:09] right
[1:03:10] that's unprepared
[1:03:12] that's not ready
[1:03:14] when you're not ready for anything it's
[1:03:16] terrible
[1:03:18] but when you're ready for anything it's
[1:03:20] a glorious thing it's awesome thing to
[1:03:23] think that when you're ready
[1:03:25] just like every week how many knows that
[1:03:27] your bills come due every month your
[1:03:29] bills come due weekly your bills come
[1:03:30] doing amen you put that money back and
[1:03:33] you save up money so that whenever you
[1:03:34] have to write that check out or pay that
[1:03:37] bill it feels good to be able to pay
[1:03:38] that bill
[1:03:39] because I don't know if anybody always
[1:03:41] ever experienced but there may be a time
[1:03:43] in your life where you didn't have the
[1:03:44] money to pay the bill
[1:03:48] and then it's a terrible thing to think
[1:03:50] oh I can't pay this you're going to
[1:03:52] sweat and frighten and worry and oh my
[1:03:54] it's going to give you great hair it's
[1:03:56] got it is a lot of stress come on
[1:04:00] people and marriages and everything when
[1:04:03] they don't have what they need of have
[1:04:05] need of and when they're not prepared
[1:04:07] for something and Jesus is saying here
[1:04:09] he says you have to be I want you to
[1:04:11] prepared
[1:04:12] but first I want to talk a little while
[1:04:14] with the help of the Lord on on how that
[1:04:16] God prepares things God makes
[1:04:19] preparations I know that he makes
[1:04:22] preparations and he also asks us to make
[1:04:25] preparations so this is kind of a
[1:04:27] two-part tonight god making preparations
[1:04:29] and then you making preparation because
[1:04:31] I believe over in Revelation 19 says
[1:04:34] that bride has made herself
[1:04:37] right ready
[1:04:39] and the tonight we want to look at what
[1:04:41] you make yourself ready with a little
[1:04:43] bit would that be all right because you
[1:04:44] got to have be ready but not just stay
[1:04:46] ready but how do you get ready what are
[1:04:48] you ready how do you mean it's going to
[1:04:50] look at that with the help of the Lord
[1:04:52] amen now
[1:04:54] the message that I got that got that I'm
[1:04:57] using for this is a message brother
[1:04:59] Brian I preached in 1965
[1:05:03] amen it was the first message from his
[1:05:07] last
[1:05:08] foreign
[1:05:11] message from his lab and he preached on
[1:05:14] things that are to be
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] and he refers to and takes a scripture
[1:05:20] out of Saint John 14 he says let not
[1:05:22] your heart be troubled ye believe in God
[1:05:24] believe also in me in my father's house
[1:05:28] are many mansions and if it were not so
[1:05:30] I would have told you amen
[1:05:33] now notice Jesus talking about going
[1:05:35] away isn't it something how that Jesus
[1:05:38] was talking about going away I go to
[1:05:40] prepare a place for you Jesus knew that
[1:05:43] he was leaving
[1:05:44] isn't it something how that the prophet
[1:05:47] just messages or he goes off the scene
[1:05:49] preaches a message takes that same
[1:05:52] thought
[1:05:53] I don't know brother man I'm doing a lot
[1:05:55] of things and and even but a man says he
[1:05:57] says you know the Lord never showed me
[1:05:59] into that of any of my my kin folks are
[1:06:01] different ones he's always showed me it
[1:06:03] before it happens whether he showed
[1:06:05] brother bam he was going off the scene
[1:06:06] or not I don't know
[1:06:08] but I do know that it's quite a
[1:06:09] coincidence or whatever you might want
[1:06:11] to call it that he would say this four
[1:06:13] messages before he is taken off the
[1:06:15] scene
[1:06:16] amen and I didn't know just and it was
[1:06:18] actually uh 19 days before he died
[1:06:23] now we know he was in the hospital
[1:06:24] probably about seven days or so I think
[1:06:26] before he actually died a little while
[1:06:29] because of the accident
[1:06:32] all of these things
[1:06:34] talked about was the reality to him and
[1:06:37] so we're going to take some of these
[1:06:38] things they talked about Amen to try to
[1:06:40] make a point with the help of the Lord
[1:06:43] amen and it was on a Christmas Eve the
[1:06:45] brother random died I had to look it up
[1:06:47] on Siri Siri actually knew when brother
[1:06:49] William Brandon Brown called the end
[1:06:51] time messenger
[1:06:53] amen that's pretty good I like that they
[1:06:56] even acknowledged he was the end time
[1:06:57] messenger because that's what he was
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] and so 50 this coming Saturday this
[1:07:05] coming Saturday night it'll be 57 years
[1:07:07] that he's been gone
[1:07:09] 57 years
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:13] but 19 days he uses this I go to prepare
[1:07:18] a place for you for if I go and prepare
[1:07:21] a place for you I will come again and
[1:07:23] we'll receive you unto myself that where
[1:07:26] I am
[1:07:29] come on folks he may be also
[1:07:33] folks I don't know about you but I'm
[1:07:35] looking forward to being wherever he is
[1:07:37] that's where I'm going to be
[1:07:43] amen that's where I want to be that's
[1:07:46] where you want to be
[1:07:48] that way I am there ye may be also now
[1:07:51] this is a little off the point but we'll
[1:07:52] pull it in here while we're talking
[1:07:53] about it and whether I go you know and
[1:07:57] the way you know
[1:07:58] isn't that something
[1:08:00] why would he put that in there
[1:08:03] and of course Thomas said to him Lord we
[1:08:05] know not whether or not go us and how
[1:08:07] can we know the way wow he just told him
[1:08:10] you know the way and you know you know
[1:08:12] you know where I'm going and you know
[1:08:14] the way
[1:08:16] Jesus saith unto him
[1:08:20] now notice I am the way the truth and
[1:08:23] the life and no man cometh unto the
[1:08:24] father but by me
[1:08:26] so notice he said you know the way
[1:08:30] Thomas says how do I know that basically
[1:08:33] but let me put it in my language you
[1:08:35] know me don't you do you know me
[1:08:37] see if you know me you know the way
[1:08:41] huh
[1:08:43] that's right not me I'm talking about
[1:08:45] Jesus said you know he said you know you
[1:08:48] know me Thomas then you know the way
[1:08:50] because I am the way
[1:08:53] I have the truth and I am the life
[1:08:56] amen so praise be to God how many has
[1:08:58] got to know
[1:09:00] away
[1:09:02] now oh there's I'm sorry there's not 900
[1:09:04] different ways to Heaven one way to
[1:09:07] heaven that's through him
[1:09:09] that's how you get there that's how you
[1:09:12] get to this new home this mansion that
[1:09:14] he's building
[1:09:16] and better ban him all through this
[1:09:19] references this to our new body all
[1:09:22] right and I thought well how does that
[1:09:23] how does that really come together in
[1:09:25] First Corinthians
[1:09:27] let me see here
[1:09:29] First Corinthians 15 let me see if I got
[1:09:31] it wrote down here Charles again second
[1:09:33] Corinthians I believe it is five
[1:09:36] second Corinthians 5
[1:09:38] Paul says it this way for we know that
[1:09:41] if our Earthly house
[1:09:43] hello
[1:09:47] if this body is called a house Jesus I
[1:09:50] won't go prepare you Mansions over there
[1:09:52] in my father's house and many mansions
[1:09:54] but about him of course is the only one
[1:09:56] that I believe is authorized to to uh
[1:10:00] correct something he says because you
[1:10:02] can't have mansions in that little house
[1:10:04] but in my father's kingdom are many
[1:10:07] policies she said it's the original
[1:10:09] interpretation and my father's kingdoms
[1:10:11] are many mansions or many palaces
[1:10:14] praise be to God
[1:10:16] now I notice Paul says if this house of
[1:10:18] this Tabernacle were dissolved we had a
[1:10:20] building of God a house made with hands
[1:10:24] Eternal in the heavens
[1:10:26] for in this we grown earnestly to be
[1:10:28] designed to be clothed upon with our
[1:10:30] house which is from Heaven praise God
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:36] now notice another place he says that he
[1:10:38] says we're going to have Bible says that
[1:10:40] we're going to have a body what like
[1:10:41] unto his own glorious body how many
[1:10:43] believe that we're gonna have a body
[1:10:45] like this his and so forth amen but here
[1:10:48] he types it and says that this house
[1:10:49] this mansion He has with the place he's
[1:10:52] went to prepare so God is a person that
[1:10:56] prepares things he gets ready for things
[1:11:00] he isn't isn't uh
[1:11:03] uh playing it by ear huh or just uh
[1:11:11] winging it
[1:11:13] he's not just winging it he knows
[1:11:17] amen now notice let's start shall we and
[1:11:20] brother bam says you know if you was you
[1:11:21] could take this for a funeral tax but no
[1:11:24] I don't take I don't think these things
[1:11:25] are more a funeral text than Christmas
[1:11:27] is just a seasonal text I believe it's
[1:11:30] all year round don't you
[1:11:32] amen and so the same way with here he
[1:11:34] talks about you know he's going to
[1:11:36] prepare a place for us that when you
[1:11:38] know that he can come and receive us
[1:11:39] unto himself now he was what was he
[1:11:42] telling them he was telling them that
[1:11:44] after death there is lights
[1:11:48] amen how many glad that this is not all
[1:11:50] of it
[1:11:51] no no no no no no no no he goes and he
[1:11:55] makes sure that when this is over we
[1:11:58] have a place over Yonder amen he's going
[1:12:00] to make sure that he's taken care of
[1:12:02] what a consolation he says that ought to
[1:12:05] give to all of us that after this life
[1:12:08] is over there is a life that we go into
[1:12:11] and as we get older he says that becomes
[1:12:14] more of a reality to you
[1:12:17] all of you older folks
[1:12:22] yeah me too amen
[1:12:25] amen as you get older
[1:12:28] older yeah listen to what the prophet
[1:12:30] says as you begin to see the days of
[1:12:31] your life drawing close you begin to
[1:12:34] pack up a little closer getting ready
[1:12:36] for that great event
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] praise the Lord now notice that great
[1:12:44] event it's not it's it's just a
[1:12:47] continuing of this same life in another
[1:12:50] world in another place
[1:12:54] foreign
[1:12:57] what else did the prophet teaches he
[1:12:58] says you know death doesn't change your
[1:13:00] character
[1:13:02] when you come to that door of death
[1:13:03] whatever you are
[1:13:05] amen that's what you are on the other
[1:13:07] side
[1:13:08] he does righteous he's righteous he
[1:13:10] that's holy that's holy he that filthy
[1:13:12] he's filthy when you cross over amen
[1:13:15] there's no more Purgatory this is
[1:13:17] Purgatory this is where the cleansing
[1:13:19] Comes This is where the purging of your
[1:13:21] sins comes
[1:13:23] amen this is where we get ready
[1:13:27] amen praise be to God
[1:13:31] so not notice he does in your birth here
[1:13:34] was what preparing
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:39] and every plan by God before the
[1:13:42] foundation of the world
[1:13:44] and that you're here
[1:13:47] amen how many believe that
[1:13:50] now and if we know the word we know
[1:13:54] where we're living
[1:13:55] huh I mean those it's important that and
[1:13:59] this just comes I mean I was even even
[1:14:01] uh uh even the Pharisees they couldn't
[1:14:04] discern they could discern the signs of
[1:14:06] the time but they couldn't discern who
[1:14:08] Jesus was
[1:14:10] couldn't decide who he was
[1:14:13] they didn't know the day and the hour
[1:14:15] that they were living in you and I know
[1:14:18] the hour we're living in what is the
[1:14:20] hour we're at the end time
[1:14:22] we're in the layout of ch
[1:14:25] at amen we know where we are living at
[1:14:29] and we know the hour that we're living
[1:14:31] in and we know what lays ahead
[1:14:36] amen and we see what we've passed
[1:14:41] isn't that right that's what the word of
[1:14:44] God shows us
[1:14:45] amen that what we've passed and so forth
[1:14:48] see you were all pre-planned by God
[1:14:57] come on people that ought to make you
[1:14:59] just a little bit happy
[1:15:03] he knew exactly how many he'd sit here
[1:15:05] tonight
[1:15:07] he who'd come who wouldn't come he know
[1:15:10] where you'd sit he knew to coach you'd
[1:15:13] wear
[1:15:14] and here is kind of a new revelation to
[1:15:16] me
[1:15:18] something I like real good at yeah
[1:15:21] I hope that I can find it for knowledge
[1:15:23] that tells him all these things
[1:15:31] how does he know it
[1:15:33] how does he know how many how many times
[1:15:35] they feed with bonnet's eye and how much
[1:15:37] tally it would make
[1:15:40] huh
[1:15:42] here's my little finite mind you want to
[1:15:45] hear a little bit of this gray matter up
[1:15:46] in here and you know if God wouldn't if
[1:15:49] God
[1:15:50] if he can't just right now figure out
[1:15:52] every time everything everything
[1:15:54] everybody's doing well guess what he
[1:15:56] could he could take an eternity
[1:15:59] to watch the process to watch every
[1:16:01] Fleet every night and to know exactly
[1:16:04] how much everyone would make here time
[1:16:06] to figure all that out
[1:16:12] you know brother I don't know about that
[1:16:15] better man says it's his foreknowledge
[1:16:19] that lets him know these things
[1:16:21] it's his foreknowledge before it ever
[1:16:23] happened
[1:16:24] right before it ever happened he had it
[1:16:27] all figured out
[1:16:31] all right
[1:16:34] now this brings to light and brings to
[1:16:37] Glory that screen
[1:16:39] scripture in Romans 8 where it says and
[1:16:41] for we know that all things work
[1:16:44] together for good
[1:16:46] to them that love God to those who are
[1:16:48] called according to his purpose his plan
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] all right
[1:16:59] we know the hour we know nothing happens
[1:17:02] by chance with God
[1:17:07] he knows
[1:17:09] all about it it's all pre-planned
[1:17:14] planned for many generations back so
[1:17:17] that you could be here tonight
[1:17:20] even your natural birth God knew all
[1:17:23] about it he pre-planned you being here
[1:17:29] they're great great grandparents
[1:17:35] then you're great great grandparents
[1:17:38] then your grandparents huh
[1:17:41] think of all the marriages and think of
[1:17:44] the according
[1:17:46] think of the romance between all of
[1:17:48] those
[1:17:49] huh that God had to bring this one with
[1:17:52] this one and that one was that one this

[1:23:36] see how that works for you
[1:23:40] there it is
[1:23:43] oh yeah I'm going after him
[1:23:46] that poor guy rather feet didn't stand a
[1:23:48] chance did he
[1:23:50] that man had done so much wickedness
[1:23:52] already in his life that God just use
[1:23:54] his mind
[1:23:56] Pharaoh didn't after he said pharaohs
[1:23:58] said just go
[1:24:00] kick everything and just get out of here
[1:24:05] that's what Pharaoh he wanted some peace
[1:24:06] and comfort he don't want fleas and
[1:24:08] flies and under his sheep
[1:24:10] dumping up down biting him everywhere
[1:24:13] he was tired of it just go
[1:24:16] God says never Pharaoh you're not
[1:24:19] getting off that easy
[1:24:23] he put them thoughts in Pharaoh's heart
[1:24:25] he says he made him stubborn he says you

[1:24:33] I'm gonna go get him God made him go
[1:24:36] after him
[1:24:38] didn't he
[1:24:39] the Bible clearly states that he's hard
[1:24:42] and Pharaoh's heart
[1:24:44] that's why he hardened his heart it
[1:24:47] would have been smart to go as his first
[1:24:48] thought but you ain't gonna control it
[1:24:50] and God is totally just because of all
[1:24:52] the evil that he had done anyway
[1:24:54] God knows what he's doing
[1:24:56] huh
[1:24:57] going against God's program and all of

[1:25:41] pre-planned God makes preparation he
[1:25:44] takes care of things for us amen

[1:25:50] foreknowledge tells him all these things
[1:25:53] amen
[1:26:00] amen he can't be just like the wind all
[1:26:02] over the Earth because he's a being he's
[1:26:04] not a myth

[1:26:07] house he dwells in a place called heaven
[1:26:08] for omnipresent omniscient and so forth
[1:26:11] but it was his before knowledge let him
[1:26:13] do all these things

[1:27:28] there but he's telling you to get ready
[1:27:31] to come there that's going to be on you
[1:27:34] and me
[1:27:35] all right
[1:27:37] oh I know the holy spirit will help us
[1:27:38] to do that but he says the bride has
[1:27:40] made herself ready and Jesus says be ye
[1:27:43] ready
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:45] see notice in my father's house or many
[1:27:48] mansions that's right
[1:27:50] and he explains it about Revelations 2
[1:27:52] and donate to add or take away but he
[1:27:54] says In My Father's Heart many mansions
[1:27:57] is many kinds of mansions
[1:28:00] many kinds of mansions now I don't
[1:28:02] believe that when we get to heaven that
[1:28:04] everybody will look just exactly alike
[1:28:07] amen I mean those these mansions that
[1:28:09] we're going to
[1:28:10] they're all going to be different this
[1:28:12] is what he says they're not all going to
[1:28:14] be blondes or brunettes
[1:28:17] amen not all big not all Giants I
[1:28:20] believe in God he's a god of variety the
[1:28:23] world proves that talking about each and
[1:28:26] every one of us and Paul said if we born
[1:28:28] the image of the Earthly we will also
[1:28:30] bear the image of the heavenly
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:37] amen
[1:28:40] this and how many knows he said that
[1:28:43] when you get over there you know uh

[1:28:52] body I mean it's not going to be out of
[1:28:54] whack it's not going to be overweight
[1:28:57] not gonna be too skinny or it's just
[1:28:59] gonna be just right
[1:29:01] you know how much conflict people get
[1:29:03] because somebody don't look like them or
[1:29:05] and so forth
[1:29:09] laughs
[1:29:11] right I'll just say what comes to mind I
[1:29:14] hope it's okay
[1:29:15] most of the time we think everybody else
[1:29:17] looks funny the guy in the mirror is the
[1:29:18] only one that looks right
[1:29:23] oh my but not with him so he goes into
[1:29:27] this now notice and he also talks about
[1:29:29] how that he makes every person different
[1:29:31] as far as your desires that's why he
[1:29:34] makes the mountains he makes the planes
[1:29:36] he makes the deserts isn't that right he
[1:29:39] says some people love mountains some
[1:29:40] people like deserts some people
[1:29:42] black cat because some people like this
[1:29:44] that or the other it'd be terrible to
[1:29:46] have to live somewhere where you really
[1:29:48] hate it
[1:29:49] all right I hope everybody is living
[1:29:51] where you like it
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:54] well thank God thank God say thank you
[1:29:56] Lord Jesus for letting me live where I
[1:29:58] won't amen where I'll enjoy it
[1:30:02] amen praise the Lord I always wanted a
[1:30:05] place like brother Brad's out there
[1:30:06] looking over her just looking way out
[1:30:08] over everywhere
[1:30:10] well be able to see fire that's awesome
[1:30:13] he'd give me a place where I didn't be
[1:30:15] able to see far but he gave me something
[1:30:17] else that I'm real happy with the love
[1:30:20] that's to be able to look from my house
[1:30:22] almost straight down
[1:30:24] way down into the woods hello
[1:30:27] that's why I get still get a good view
[1:30:30] and yeah
[1:30:32] so God makes us different and that right
[1:30:34] he makes us all different
[1:30:36] praise the Lord
[1:30:38] uh now he goes into something a little
[1:30:42] the temporal gifts that God gives it
[1:30:44] it's only expressing that there's an
[1:30:46] eternal one uh let me finish this
[1:30:49] now notice oh this is a different quote
[1:30:53] now we know that Moses in building the
[1:30:54] Tabernacle in the wilderness or
[1:30:56] preparing it he said that he made things
[1:30:58] after the order that he saw in heaven so
[1:31:00] the Earthly things only express what the
[1:31:03] Eternal Things Are
[1:31:05] praise be to God let me finish this
[1:31:07] quote because it'll explain it all
[1:31:16] and the flowers and things and it's an
[1:31:18] expression one that's dying is only
[1:31:21] expressing one that's
[1:31:23] Eternal amen
[1:31:25] when you see a tree struggling and
[1:31:27] pulling and trying to live that means
[1:31:29] there's a tree somewhere that doesn't
[1:31:31] have to do that
[1:31:32] when you see a man here struggling to
[1:31:35] okay sister Johnny struggling for air
[1:31:39] as we did brother I haven't watched him
[1:31:40] go amen and just struggling struggling
[1:31:43] they want to live yeah
[1:31:45] you want to let her strong with
[1:31:46] struggling amen every struggle amen that
[1:31:49] tells me there's a place there's a body
[1:31:51] amen that they won't struggle they won't
[1:31:53] have to struggle anymore
[1:31:55] it's eternal
[1:31:58] aren't you happy for that to know
[1:32:00] oh my
[1:32:02] to live somebody in the hospital or a
[1:32:04] sick bed or an accident struggling and
[1:32:06] the death rattles in their throat and
[1:32:08] pulling and crying and screaming for
[1:32:09] Life what does that mean that there's a
[1:32:12] place somewhere the there's a body that
[1:32:14] doesn't struggle and scream for that see
[1:32:16] it just doesn't do that
[1:32:18] these are temporal gifts that God has
[1:32:20] given they're expressing
[1:32:23] verse 1 over there
[1:32:24] that's eternal
[1:32:28] Beulah Land
[1:32:32] I'm longing for
[1:32:38] and someday
[1:32:42] on the I'll Stand
[1:32:49] there My Hope
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:57] shall be turned
[1:33:03] aren't yours
[1:33:05] it's longing for that
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:11] now remember the Bible said if
[1:33:13] tabernacular or dwelling if it perish
[1:33:15] then we have one already waiting just as
[1:33:18] a little baby it's little muscles and
[1:33:21] the mother are twisting and turning and
[1:33:22] notice you can take a woman she can be
[1:33:24] ever so foul but when that she used to
[1:33:27] be a mother a little while before that
[1:33:28] baby born there's a kindness about that
[1:33:30] woman get around and there's always
[1:33:32] something she's more tender why there's
[1:33:35] a little angel Spirit waiting to receive
[1:33:37] that natural body
[1:33:39] just as soon as he's born the Breath of
[1:33:41] Life comes into it God breathing in
[1:33:43] there and it becomes a living Soul not
[1:33:45] just as this baby is being born than the
[1:33:48] spiritual body is there to receive it
[1:33:50] and now when this body is dropped here
[1:33:52] on Earth just like the babies drop also
[1:33:54] there is an immortal body they're
[1:33:56] waiting to receive the spirit back into
[1:33:59] itself again oh what a great thing
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:04] I wrote something else down here
[1:34:06] and I said also if you'll notice that
[1:34:09] most of the time oh folks
[1:34:12] tend to be really sweet
[1:34:19] oh boy hello folks that ain't a whole
[1:34:22] lot of amens coming from there I I
[1:34:24] noticed there's some you know and you
[1:34:26] get a little old lady in them or a man a
[1:34:28] young man come up there and kind of be
[1:34:29] roughy they'll slap him around for being
[1:34:31] so rude and so unthoughtful right we
[1:34:33] like
[1:34:34] thoughtful people we like to be
[1:34:36] thoughtful we like to be kind
[1:34:38] say we
[1:34:40] huh
[1:34:42] sure why and I thought why because
[1:34:45] they're getting ready for that new body
[1:34:51] they're getting ready should we say
[1:34:53] shouldn't be the same way with
[1:34:54] Christians be kind-hearted one to
[1:34:57] another it says now what is this that's
[1:34:59] what Believers are Christians are
[1:35:03] amen
[1:35:05] that's right not just a pregnant woman
[1:35:07] sometimes our elderly
[1:35:10] of course you all know the other side of
[1:35:12] the story
[1:35:13] if they're not a Christian they can be a
[1:35:15] grouchy old man and a grumpy old woman
[1:35:19] Lord help us brother bam says Don't Let
[1:35:21] The Devil Crown my life with that
[1:35:25] I'd rather meet a sweet little old lady
[1:35:27] than I would have mean little old lady
[1:35:33] that's all right no names mentioned
[1:35:40] amen he loves the Lord
[1:35:43] God is good isn't he
[1:35:44] all right
[1:35:52] all right
[1:35:54] wow now let's talk about this baby for a
[1:35:58] minute brother bam says before these
[1:35:59] little babies born
[1:36:01] this little baby
[1:36:04] I think I seen a sign somewhere where
[1:36:06] was it
[1:36:10] I can't think of where
[1:36:12] but it's where they served alcohol and
[1:36:14] so forth and there was a sign up warning
[1:36:16] drinking alcohol can cause birth defects
[1:36:20] right it could give you a warning that
[1:36:22] if a woman drinks this or smokes this or
[1:36:24] all of this what does it cause they warn
[1:36:26] against eating the wrong thing because
[1:36:28] it'll cause a birth defect
[1:36:31] amen
[1:36:33] so now notice
[1:36:36] this mother this little baby perhaps
[1:36:39] craving some vitamin in the mother's
[1:36:41] word speak speak forth dad I want some
[1:36:43] cantaloupe or watermelon I want
[1:36:45] something another
[1:36:46] he'll do everything he can to get that
[1:36:48] because he knows that he wants his child
[1:36:50] to be born perfect
[1:36:56] amen
[1:36:57] as it can be
[1:37:00] that's right anybody to have little
[1:37:02] children
[1:37:03] you know nowadays you ain't got sweated
[1:37:07] because they got these
[1:37:09] X-rays and they could tell you if it
[1:37:11] doesn't have but two fingers
[1:37:13] right
[1:37:15] but before man but look when he comes
[1:37:17] out Mom and Dad they want to look over
[1:37:18] one two three four five yep one two
[1:37:20] three yeah that's terrific hands perfect
[1:37:22] feet legs are fine it's not turn twisted
[1:37:25] or anything it's a it's a card for a
[1:37:27] bird you want that child right right
[1:37:31] amen I can get an amen on that everybody
[1:37:33] wants
[1:37:35] normally born babies in order to do that
[1:37:38] that mother is very concerned to Dad's
[1:37:40] very concerned and this just comes to
[1:37:42] mind that Daniel
[1:37:43] boy he'll be twice as nice and alive and
[1:37:46] don't work too hard and and don't do no
[1:37:48] dancing don't jump on but now you know
[1:37:50] he'll probably give her all kinds of
[1:37:51] coaching that he's wearing he's
[1:37:53] concerned that that baby will turn out
[1:37:54] right
[1:37:56] amen
[1:37:58] oh my
[1:38:00] he'll do everything he can because he
[1:38:02] wants a child just as perfect this can
[1:38:04] be he'll do everything he's able to do
[1:38:05] it how much abler is he the Creator
[1:38:10] now I may know that Jesus when we get
[1:38:13] there he wants you perfect I love the
[1:38:15] quote but the mom says you know God
[1:38:16] brother Brown says you God wants you
[1:38:18] perfect and you have to be perfect to go
[1:38:21] there that's what he said
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] huh
[1:38:29] that's right
[1:38:33] because how many knows you're just not
[1:38:34] going to go in there with a bunch of sin
[1:38:35] on you yet
[1:38:37] it's got to be dealt with here
[1:38:39] even Jesus says be ye perfect
[1:38:43] as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:38:47] amen so this is about getting ready for
[1:38:49] that you got to be ready for the coming
[1:38:51] of the Lord
[1:38:52] that's what Jesus said be prepared be
[1:38:55] ready amen
[1:38:59] amen
[1:39:01] now think of how able he is to prepare
[1:39:04] us a body to live like his own glorious
[1:39:06] body if we want to live there's
[1:39:08] something in us that calls to live
[1:39:11] there's something in us that calls to do
[1:39:14] right then God calls somebody to the
[1:39:18] platformer to the public that'll preach
[1:39:20] the absolute truth why it shows you then
[1:39:24] if you're a real child of God you begin
[1:39:26] to cry out God take this away from me
[1:39:29] circumcise me from this to take these
[1:39:32] things away from me why it's needed for
[1:39:34] your heavenly home that you're going to
[1:39:36] that he's going to prepare
[1:39:39] Hallelujah Lord take this away take that
[1:39:42] away I want everything right Lord help
[1:39:43] me to feed on your word
[1:39:46] it's very important our daily diet it's
[1:39:48] so important a lot of us would be
[1:39:50] healthier if our daily diet would be
[1:39:52] right naturally and then a lot of us be
[1:39:54] like more spiritually healthy if our
[1:39:56] daily diet would be right
[1:39:58] it's important what you eat it's
[1:40:00] important what you can do
[1:40:05] amen
[1:40:07] therefore if you've got tonight just
[1:40:10] come and said well I offer Christ my
[1:40:12] life
[1:40:13] if you've never received the Holy Ghost
[1:40:15] come into it you must do it you must
[1:40:18] grow into it ask God to pile a word on
[1:40:21] top of the word
[1:40:23] amen
[1:40:25] until you become a full stature of the
[1:40:27] son and daughter of God
[1:40:30] amen Jesus said be perfect Ephesians
[1:40:33] Paul says you know godson gives to Men
[1:40:35] He said pastor Jesus
[1:40:37] the problem
[1:40:39] of the Saints for the edifying of the
[1:40:42] body of Christ until we come to the full
[1:40:43] measure of Christ unto a perfect man

[1:43:37] take in what is pride food I wrote down
[1:43:40] here well first of all it's food that's

[1:44:07] know what he said
[1:44:09] huh what could that would that do us
[1:44:13] it'd all be hearsay
[1:44:15] and let me tell you something you don't
[1:44:16] go by here saying the message you go to
[1:44:18] Africa and they're worshiping brother
[1:44:19] Banner claiming he's Jesus and
[1:44:21] everything else thousands upon thousands
[1:44:23] of people
[1:44:24] like a brother uh benora said in the
[1:44:28] Philippines in different places they
[1:44:30] they do the same struggles we did here
[1:44:31] in America when we first started out all
[1:44:34] kinds of false doctrines and fall things
[1:44:36] that we had to get over and we had to
[1:44:37] struggle through all of that stuff
[1:44:43] amen but we have stored food
[1:44:47] we have spiritual food and Deuces and
[1:44:51] we're like that woman a man that was
[1:44:53] down to her last morsel we tried the
[1:44:56] last denomination and we were going to
[1:44:58] take the last denomination then we're
[1:44:59] going to quit we're gonna die
[1:45:03] because we don't know what else to do
[1:45:04] but God come in there and he give us
[1:45:06] Spirit to food and not a meal no don't
[1:45:08] run dry and the crews don't run dry
[1:45:10] there's always oil there's always bread
[1:45:14] Amen on the Wednesday night there's
[1:45:15] bread on the Sunday morning against
[1:45:17] bread there's food
[1:45:21] makes you feel like jumping
[1:45:24] makes you feel frisk
[1:45:27] Y come on
[1:45:32] it's okay I make more noise than anybody
[1:45:34] you ain't gonna bother me
[1:45:38] all right
[1:45:40] isn't that the truth though
[1:45:45] you got food
[1:45:48] to give your soul spiritual food
[1:45:51] because we're living in a what
[1:45:53] dry and thirsty land where no water is
[1:45:58] that's right
[1:46:01] people ain't got
[1:46:03] you can't live on denominational food
[1:46:06] ah you sisters it's okay if you want to
[1:46:08] cut your hair I want a little makeup and
[1:46:11] wear trousers and pants it's all right
[1:46:13] God don't look at that with the parents
[1:46:17] can anybody say Amen to that
[1:46:22] he can
[1:46:24] they're like
[1:46:26] a preacher
[1:46:27] didn't buy the brown say that in the God
[1:46:29] of this evil age she loves she he allows
[1:46:32] her to sin and she loves him for it
[1:46:36] denominations love to have the legalized
[1:46:39] sin in their churches and all these
[1:46:41] other stuff hello
[1:46:43] but you can't live on that you can't
[1:46:45] make nobody perfect like that
[1:46:47] you can't come to perfection
[1:46:50] eating poison well today's the Miracles
[1:46:53] has passed
[1:46:54] so we got stored food first of all you
[1:46:56] gotta believe Malachi 4 5 because it's
[1:46:59] for our day
[1:47:00] it's food for y'all behold I'll send you
[1:47:03] a mind you the prophet before the ground
[1:47:05] coming up the great and Dreadful day of
[1:47:07] the Lord and He will do what he will
[1:47:09] turn Thomas's Ballard's heart he will
[1:47:11] turn your heart back to the faith that
[1:47:13] Paul had
[1:47:15] he will bring us back the things that
[1:47:17] Jesus just the way that Jesus said it
[1:47:19] and then it'll bring to the Perfection
[1:47:20] that they had
[1:47:22] that's the kind of food that we have to
[1:47:24] eat and it comes from Malachi
[1:47:27] Malachi 4 Foo
[1:47:29] turning the hearts back back to the
[1:47:31] faith of the fathers the Bible says
[1:47:33] Hallelujah
[1:47:37] same Faith there not only that Paul had
[1:47:42] but we go past Paul
[1:47:47] past
[1:47:49] oh I better watch what I'm saying here
[1:47:51] brother sister Becky
[1:47:53] pass Paul
[1:47:56] well I don't know that Paul had all that
[1:47:59] much discernment
[1:48:00] but when brother Branham came and Jesus
[1:48:02] would come down on the platform he would
[1:48:03] discern the thoughts and Tents of the
[1:48:05] heart just like he did with the woman to
[1:48:06] do well
[1:48:07] we have the faith that Jesus had when he
[1:48:09] was here on Earth
[1:48:10] all the way back to Jesus Christ
[1:48:13] Jesus Christ's own life and brother
[1:48:15] Brown what was it the Masterpiece he
[1:48:16] talked about how that that word has come
[1:48:18] up it has come up to Luther to walking
[1:48:20] age Wesley the sanctification age
[1:48:23] Pentecost the speaking in tongue age
[1:48:26] ah and all the way up to the IH
[1:48:29] prophetic to be able to see all these
[1:48:31] things prophetic age all the way up to
[1:48:33] the head up here where the mind is
[1:48:37] to where we even know the very mind of
[1:48:40] God
[1:48:43] to the full Center of Christ until God
[1:48:45] manifested himself just like he was
[1:48:49] walking on the shores of Galilee through
[1:48:51] his body his church
[1:48:54] and the Easter brother banned him to do
[1:48:56] it
[1:48:57] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:48:58] heart
[1:48:59] huh
[1:49:01] where should our faith be
[1:49:03] that's why the property of God says this
[1:49:04] this is rapturing Faith in his message
[1:49:08] because you without a doubt amen that he
[1:49:12] wasn't brother Branham
[1:49:14] that was Jesus Christ
[1:49:17] the word of God discerns us thoughts and
[1:49:19] intents of the heart
[1:49:21] brother Brown couldn't do it he always
[1:49:23] had to wait here
[1:49:25] and you know what I'm waiting on
[1:49:27] if you don't come well we might as well
[1:49:29] go home and go to bed
[1:49:34] [Laughter]
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:39] somewhere tell me if you did
[1:49:42] after church
[1:49:43] tell me if you ever read somewhere
[1:49:46] I heard somewhere where he just didn't
[1:49:48] show
[1:49:54] oh Jesus I think brother Tommy brought
[1:49:56] it out he says you know in a testimony
[1:49:59] when Billy Paul
[1:50:00] got the God was given the privilege of
[1:50:03] looking at that angel
[1:50:06] he says that angel wouldn't even look at
[1:50:07] him that angel kept his eye on brother
[1:50:10] the whole time
[1:50:12] kept
[1:50:13] his eye on him
[1:50:18] let me see how many knows brother Brown
[1:50:20] had an angel follow him all the days all
[1:50:22] his life
[1:50:23] even when he went to commit suicide and
[1:50:24] reach for the hot wire up on the
[1:50:26] telephone wire reached for that and
[1:50:28] found himself on the floor
[1:50:31] can I imagine a little let me tell you
[1:50:33] something he missed his wife so much he
[1:50:35] couldn't even live with himself because
[1:50:37] of the sorrow in his heart that he had
[1:50:39] caused
[1:50:40] he says I can't I'm a coward I can't do
[1:50:43] it anymore
[1:50:45] next thing he knowed he was laying on
[1:50:47] the ground
[1:50:48] my imagination is that somebody grabbed
[1:50:51] him
[1:50:53] laid him down there
[1:50:56] don't know that he had any broken bones
[1:50:58] or a broken neck from falling from all
[1:51:00] the way up there right
[1:51:01] something had to just bring him down
[1:51:04] like I said I don't know what it was but
[1:51:06] I wouldn't doubt it amen
[1:51:14] I like that oh
[1:51:17] he was still so sorry for brother Glenn
[1:51:19] he's so sad when he got home he was in
[1:51:22] the room and he remembered his wife
[1:51:23] remembered all of those things he was so
[1:51:25] tired
[1:51:27] so softly grabbed the gun put his head
[1:51:30] cocked it and pulled the trigger pull
[1:51:32] trigger it wouldn't shoot
[1:51:35] across out and dang shot off when he
[1:51:37] threw it off there
[1:51:39] he won't even let me kill myself I won't
[1:51:41] even let me
[1:51:43] stop
[1:51:46] we tend to
[1:51:47] mind he comes in the way of a
[1:51:49] transgressor
[1:51:55] Isn't it nice to know that when God has
[1:51:56] a plan I don't care how many guns you
[1:51:58] punch it ahead you ain't gonna get
[1:52:01] accomplished no it isn't God doesn't
[1:52:03] take a detour and well I got to come up
[1:52:05] with a second plan though he's going to
[1:52:07] make it happen
[1:52:13] thank you Lord
[1:52:15] because he was thinking of you
[1:52:17] he was thinking of me
[1:52:19] he was going to bring us a mess he said
[1:52:20] would bring us to Christ
[1:52:22] he would point to Christ not himself
[1:52:24] that's what made the prophet a prophet
[1:52:26] to me he wasn't pointing and never
[1:52:27] pointing it to himself always point it
[1:52:29] to the Christ amen all robbers Billy
[1:52:32] Graham or a lot of a lot of folks man
[1:52:33] they point to their self but I'm here to
[1:52:35] tell you he pointed Judah Christ
[1:52:37] that is his word
[1:52:41] amen
[1:52:43] praise the Lord
[1:52:46] yeah I got plenty of them up here
[1:52:48] I got three of them
[1:52:52] not bad for eight dollars
[1:52:58] I'm so glad to be able to see except for
[1:53:00] reading just like it was
[1:53:02] man
[1:53:07] you know it's something
[1:53:10] a little testimonial here in the middle
[1:53:11] of it but when I was going to see the
[1:53:12] doctor the second time because the first
[1:53:14] wouldn't work because my eyesight were
[1:53:16] getting better
[1:53:17] somebody should have told me brother I
[1:53:19] believe your eyesight's going to come
[1:53:20] back I just wait before you spent that
[1:53:21] other 450 dollars
[1:53:25] I said you know I believe it's coming
[1:53:26] back and but I was going for the second
[1:53:28] time I said well I guess I'll go and try
[1:53:30] it you know and I should have listened
[1:53:32] to the inner voice because not had a 400
[1:53:33] set sitting in the cabinet that I can't
[1:53:36] use
[1:53:37] don't want to use I'm happy to have him
[1:53:39] in there yeah I'm sorry I haven't seen
[1:53:40] that I'm glad to have it in the cabinet
[1:53:48] that's right folks
[1:53:50] that's something amen isn't God good
[1:53:53] isn't it good to be Christian
[1:53:55] I'm telling you amen
[1:53:58] just another half hour is that all right
[1:54:11] bam talked about how did you staggered
[1:54:13] into a mission somewhere you didn't
[1:54:15] really understand what was going on the
[1:54:16] preach preacher certain subject and you
[1:54:18] write fell at the altar and you don't
[1:54:19] really know what it was all about
[1:54:21] hey man I thought about brother Glenn
[1:54:22] all this and I said you know you
[1:54:24] staggered into the church and there's
[1:54:25] just something about it right you don't
[1:54:26] know what but it's the truth isn't that
[1:54:28] right just in brother bam says it's just
[1:54:31] fitting to you
[1:54:32] it's just fitting to you something just
[1:54:34] fits right with you hey
[1:54:39] man I should
[1:54:43] I just can't hardly be a Christian folks
[1:54:45] if you are if you're at that place
[1:54:47] you need to get closer to God
[1:54:50] because when you get the baptism of the
[1:54:52] Holy Ghost it's not so hard
[1:54:54] I mean it's the best thing ever and if
[1:54:55] you ever totally surrendered from the
[1:54:57] flesh because that's what keeps you back
[1:54:58] in the first place and makes it hard
[1:55:01] hey man praise the Lord
[1:55:04] but it just fits you I mean it was being
[1:55:07] a Christian just fits you
[1:55:10] I'm happy
[1:55:12] of where I am with the Lord I'm glad to

[1:55:35] amen things to come
[1:55:37] we're feeding on that how many believe
[1:55:39] that we're feeding on Revelation
[1:55:42] The Book of Revelations we understand
[1:55:44] the mysteries of God Revelation 10 7 it
[1:55:48] says
[1:55:49] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:55:50] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:55:52] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:55:54] finished as he has declared unto his
[1:55:56] servants of prophets now we're even
[1:55:59] feeding on the knowledge and the
[1:56:01] understanding of what it was all about
[1:56:05] amen aren't you glad for that
[1:56:09] come up to the revelations fourth
[1:56:11] chapter find out that there was one that
[1:56:13] sat on the throne
[1:56:15] no more under Heaven uh uh uh
[1:56:18] misunderstanding there's just three Gods
[1:56:21] is there one God how many gods is there

[1:56:25] the throne

[1:56:33] and of death
[1:56:35] amen
[1:56:37] praise the Lord
[1:56:39] and we're feeding on Revelations 18.
[1:56:44] and I heard another Voice come out of
[1:56:46] heaven
[1:56:47] saying come out of her my people
[1:56:50] that you partake not ever sins and that
[1:56:52] you received none of her plagues how
[1:56:54] many believes that's
[1:56:56] amen what we're feeding on

[1:57:01] Revelation 19 Amen to bride has made
[1:57:04] herself
[1:57:05] ready
[1:57:07] that's what you and I are doing
[1:57:09] let me go on I got to think and I said
[1:57:11] boy that was when you just think about
[1:57:13] what you're feeding on you're not
[1:57:15] feeding on a man brother bam says you're
[1:57:17] not feeding on brother Branham you're
[1:57:19] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:57:23] almighty God you're feeding on Christ
[1:57:26] you've heard the saying you are what you
[1:57:29] eat
[1:57:30] I may believe that
[1:57:32] you feed on a carrion and and old dead
[1:57:36] things you're probably a quote
[1:57:39] huh
[1:57:40] but if you are a dove

[1:57:45] that old crowser the crow can eat wheat
[1:57:48] and grain and a lot don't need that
[1:57:50] stuff
[1:57:52] amen
[1:57:53] but a real Dove can only feed on good
[1:57:56] things amen
[1:57:58] you ought what you eat a bride member
[1:58:00] can't like I said earlier
[1:58:02] feed on denominational slop
[1:58:05] you can't feed on some food that was for
[1:58:07] yesterday
[1:58:09] some man-made Creed and doctrines hello

[1:58:17] you got to be Amish or you got to be
[1:58:19] Mennonite you got to speak in tongues
[1:58:21] this out of the other that doesn't make
[1:58:22] me happy I want to be like Christ
[1:58:24] I want more of Christ
[1:58:26] I want to be in the full stature of
[1:58:28] Christ nothing less will suffice are you
[1:58:31] with me
[1:58:33] how many believe you guys come to the
[1:58:35] full statue of Christ time to grow up
[1:58:37] time to get away from the things of the
[1:58:39] world
[1:58:41] amen
[1:58:44] all right now notice you the spirit of
[1:58:47] God is on the inside of that body that's
[1:58:49] what makes the outside come into
[1:58:52] subjections because the inside is
[1:58:54] pulling it bringing it in line with the
[1:58:57] word of God you're inside you yourself
[1:59:00] you're being or people he said listen
[1:59:03] have you made reservations to change
[1:59:06] coats
[1:59:07] have you made reservations for heaven
[1:59:09] remember you must make reservations
[1:59:13] you have to make preparation you have to
[1:59:16] make ready
[1:59:20] how do you make ready well the Bible
[1:59:22] talks about whether there was a wedding
[1:59:24] made amen and all of the different ones
[1:59:26] came in but at the door they were all
[1:59:28] given a wedding garment and right giving
[1:59:30] a wedding garment when Jesus came there
[1:59:32] was one that it didn't have the wedding
[1:59:33] on it he says how did you get it
[1:59:36] throwing me down or Darkness you ain't
[1:59:38] gonna get in there unless you've got the
[1:59:40] Garment of Jesus Christ's righteousness

[1:59:49] the robe the ticket the reservation
[1:59:53] that you have to have is Christ's robe
[1:59:56] of righteousness his life
[1:59:59] you can't just make your life and his
[2:00:01] life blend together
[2:00:04] now your life has to be dead it has to
[2:00:07] be his life but if I'm says nothing but
[2:00:09] the literal life of Jesus Christ is
[2:00:12] going to be accepted on that day
[2:00:15] it's a token
[2:00:16] and it's like a reservation at a hotel
