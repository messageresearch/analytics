[17:18] precious
[17:19] but unto them which be disobedient the
[17:21] stone which the
[17:22] builders disallowed the same is made the
[17:25] head of the corner
[17:36] be you're a chosen generation a royal
[17:39] priesthood
[17:40] a holy nation a peculiar people that you
[17:44] should show forth the praises of him
[17:46] who hath called you out of the darkness
[17:48] into his marvelous light
[18:00] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[18:02] strangers and pilgrims abstained from
[18:04] the fleshly lust
[18:05] which war against the soul last winner
[18:08] together
[18:09] having your conversation honest among
[18:12] the gentiles
[18:13] that whereas they speak against you as
[18:15] evil doers
[18:17] that may ye be your good works which
[18:19] shall shall behold glorify god
[18:21] in the day of visitation brother brian
[18:36] you can all be seated
[18:41] you know when i was a lot younger than
[18:43] what i am right now
[18:45] that's one of the chapters in the bible
[18:46] that i memorized
[18:48] that along with several other chapters
[18:53] you know well there's a lot of truth
[18:55] just the one
[18:56] thing that it talks about
[19:00] you can turn to romans the 11th chapter
[19:03] this morning
[19:04] you know that stone everyone in their
[19:06] own life has to face that stone
[19:08] you know either you're going to fall on
[19:10] it and humble yourselves or
[19:13] you're going to go on the other side one
[19:15] day and that very stone that very
[19:16] presence will have to destroy you have
[19:18] choice
[19:19] and every every man woman has a choice
[19:22] and he
[19:23] kind of goes back to what brother thomas
[19:25] was talking about
[19:26] on wednesday night you know
[19:30] everyone has a choice you know you can
[19:32] choose god doesn't force you to believe
[19:35] he encourages you to believe but he
[19:37] doesn't force you to believe
[19:38] everything he does is through love and
[19:40] guidance leading you
[19:42] prodding with you to get you in a place
[19:44] where you'll accept him
[19:46] he doesn't force anyone into anything
[19:48] that's a choice we all have to make
[19:50] but i was uh thinking i'll jump over
[19:53] here this morning
[19:55] you know i'll just read this you all
[19:57] know where i'm about to read from
[20:00] you know how many messages have we if
[20:02] some of you are just been in them
[20:04] been in been christians for a year or
[20:06] two some have been christians for 50 60
[20:09] years 30 years
[20:11] you've all heard this scripture here but
[20:14] as
[20:15] the years start unfolding themselves you
[20:18] see it coming to manifestation
[20:20] you know it used to be it would take a
[20:21] year for something to happen or maybe 10
[20:24] years for something happen
[20:25] now we're dealing with hours and days
[20:28] it's
[20:29] you know like brother branham said in
[20:30] the countdown message
[20:32] you know you go from the just the
[20:34] invention of the wheel
[20:36] and the saddle then you go to the
[20:39] invention of cars and airplanes and
[20:41] rockets
[20:42] and as the as the ages move on they
[20:45] accelerate
[20:46] faster and faster and faster we're at
[20:48] that point now
[20:49] with what we thought would be normal
[20:52] yesterday the next day is not normal
[20:55] anymore but i'll just read this
[20:57] you all i don't have to have you turn
[20:59] there you'll know what i'm reading but i
[21:00] was thinking how many messages have
[21:02] i heard of we all heard where ministers
[21:05] of the gospel go to the
[21:07] third chapter of revelations and talk
[21:09] about that last
[21:10] church age and and i'll just read the
[21:13] scripture
[21:14] i was thinking you can see this
[21:15] scripture being fulfilled this morning
[21:17] and everything that's going on out there
[21:19] in the world and
[21:20] i'll just read what has to say and he's
[21:23] talking to the church and saying i know
[21:25] thy works without
[21:26] neither cold nor hot i wouldn't that
[21:28] were cold or hard so god's telling them
[21:31] that
[21:31] he would prefer them to be totally cold
[21:34] or totally hot
[21:35] so then because thou art lukewarm
[21:37] neither cold nor hot
[21:38] i will spew thee out of my mouth because
[21:41] i'll say as i am rich increased with
[21:43] goods
[21:44] and i have need of nothing notice thou
[21:45] not but thou are wretched miserable poor
[21:48] blind
[21:48] and naked and if you return with me to
[21:50] the 11th chapter of romans this morning
[21:54] you know i think the gentile church in
[21:56] itself is taken for granted
[21:58] you know if you look at the children of
[22:00] israel's history
[22:02] as and you read the old testament you
[22:05] see their history you see their ups
[22:06] their downs you can see the same thing
[22:09] in the church
[22:10] this morning the gentile churches got
[22:13] into a place just like
[22:14] the israelis in their day before they
[22:17] fell the temple was destroyed
[22:18] that they thought that that would never
[22:20] happen that it would never happen that
[22:22] god
[22:23] would always provide for him and it's
[22:25] the same thing with the gentile church
[22:26] this morning
[22:27] they're moving into judgment and they
[22:29] have no clue
[22:30] that god is moving them into judgment
[22:32] because they didn't
[22:33] accept the word for the hour and their
[22:35] eyes are blinded their hearts are
[22:37] hardened
[22:38] and it's a rare it's a precious thing to
[22:41] know
[22:42] that god is dealing with your heart and
[22:44] your life this morning
[22:45] and i'll just read here
[22:49] and i was i was trying to find some
[22:51] things and it goes back to what brother
[22:53] thomas was talking about
[22:55] on wednesday if if you're dealing with
[22:58] people next to you
[23:00] what does being a christian mean to you
[23:02] how how do you
[23:03] interact with people i know i never said
[23:05] anything wednesday night but
[23:07] how do you interact with people how does
[23:10] being a christian make you feel in your
[23:12] heart
[23:12] how to and from that heart experience
[23:15] that you have
[23:16] how do you deal with your fellow man
[23:18] whether it's on the job or the guy you
[23:20] meet in walmart or woman
[23:22] how do you how do you interact with them
[23:24] and how do you explain
[23:26] who you are and what you are to them you
[23:28] know and the two things i was thinking
[23:30] about the two virtues that a christian
[23:31] really has to have
[23:33] not while putting patience aside because
[23:35] that's really important you need a lot
[23:37] of
[23:37] patience with people because you can't
[23:39] make people be better you can't make
[23:41] them be worse you can't make them be
[23:43] better you have to have a lot of
[23:44] patience
[23:45] for people that doesn't mean that you
[23:46] make excuses for their bad behavior
[23:49] but you just have to be patient with
[23:50] people and i was thinking the one virtue
[23:52] that a christian really has to have in
[23:54] this day and age is
[23:56] empathy you have to have empathy for
[23:58] people i know i'm using a big english
[24:00] word there but
[24:01] basically you have to be able to put
[24:03] yourself in someone else's shoes
[24:05] and and feel for them even though
[24:07] they're wrong you have to
[24:09] understand them you can't be so much
[24:11] judgmental you just have to keep working
[24:13] with them
[24:14] so god until god finally speaks to them
[24:16] and they move into a relationship
[24:19] and i was thinking this morning i carry
[24:21] this in my notebook
[24:23] it's in that healing thoughts book it's
[24:25] what brother
[24:26] adam said about thoughts and i was
[24:28] thinking a christian is possessed by
[24:30] not bad thoughts good thoughts and a way
[24:34] to know what's possessing you
[24:36] when you develop when you reach a
[24:38] situation whatever it is
[24:39] you're dealing with a friend or someone
[24:42] at work
[24:43] what is that inside your heart or inside
[24:46] your mind
[24:47] whatev wherever you're coming from
[24:49] what's the first thing you think of
[24:51] is it a positive thought or is it a
[24:53] negative thought
[24:54] now it doesn't mean that people aren't
[24:56] accountable for their actions but what
[24:58] kind of thoughts possess you
[25:00] when you're dealing with any given
[25:01] situation and i'll just read this is
[25:04] this is out of spiritual adoption and
[25:06] this is the
[25:07] preamble in that book of all those
[25:09] situations it says
[25:11] in order to stay with god stay gentle
[25:14] and
[25:14] god is a gentle spirit god is gentle in
[25:17] order to stay with god stay with love
[25:20] god is love stay meek you know meek does
[25:22] mean
[25:24] in this sense means that you put
[25:26] everything before the lord before you
[25:27] make that decision
[25:29] in anything that's going on don't ever
[25:30] be self-sufficient i got to raise my
[25:32] hand there
[25:33] i'm just one of those fellers that likes
[25:35] to be self-sufficient
[25:36] but when it comes to my christianity it
[25:38] comes to my experience in christ
[25:40] i can't i can't do it myself i can't be
[25:43] self-sufficient in that
[25:45] because i always rely upon him and
[25:48] this is really hard for this agent never
[25:51] never use your own mind everything we
[25:54] use we have to use the word of god and i
[25:56] was thinking goes back to wednesday
[25:58] what do we have in this age as
[26:00] christians that gives us the ability
[26:03] to be victorious and it's simply the
[26:05] word of god you know that's what you
[26:07] you have an absolute which is the word
[26:09] of god for the hour that we live in
[26:11] and that should give you comfort it
[26:14] should give you
[26:14] peace in your mind and that's what a lot
[26:17] of you were talking about wednesday
[26:19] is that you have peace through christ
[26:21] and he goes on to say
[26:22] don't ever be self-sufficient always
[26:24] rely upon him
[26:26] never use your own mind take his
[26:28] thoughts let his thoughts be your
[26:30] thoughts so
[26:31] again you can only get his thoughts what
[26:34] did brother adam say
[26:35] his thoughts are expressed in the word
[26:37] of god the bible that i have opened
[26:39] before me and the message that was
[26:41] revealed
[26:41] those are the thoughts of god those are
[26:43] the thoughts that we should have
[26:45] i don't have my you know a lot of people
[26:46] say this you know i don't have a
[26:48] personal thought in it
[26:50] it's only what the word of god has to
[26:52] say about it
[26:53] his thoughts let his thoughts be your
[26:55] thoughts take them into your carnal mind
[26:57] repeat them over and over and brother
[26:59] madam is given whatever your state is
[27:02] right now this morning before the living
[27:04] god he's giving you
[27:06] even in a in a carnal mind he's telling
[27:09] you
[27:09] if you can't if you're still so carnal
[27:11] if you'll just keep reading god's word
[27:13] and putting
[27:14] the word of god before you in a daily
[27:16] way
[27:17] sooner or later your spirit your soul
[27:21] and body will come into possession of
[27:23] those very thoughts
[27:25] and you the only way that can happen is
[27:27] that you put yourself in that state
[27:29] and he goes on to say here repeat them
[27:32] over and over
[27:33] say oh god take all my doubt away let my
[27:36] thoughts be your thoughts
[27:38] and he goes on to say just cast away the
[27:41] thoughts of sickness and this
[27:43] you know this book dealt with you know
[27:45] physical sickness but
[27:47] in the age that we live in it i mean
[27:49] physical sickness is one thing but the
[27:51] mental sickness out there in the world
[27:52] today is unbelievable
[27:54] where people don't know the absolute
[27:56] simple truth i mean in a physical sense
[27:58] they don't have no truth
[28:00] in in the physical reality that we're
[28:02] living they make
[28:03] subdivision you know i'm using big words
[28:05] sorry about that but they believe
[28:06] you know when a man can be a woman a
[28:08] woman can be a man or you can be in
[28:10] between those two states
[28:12] you know that's that's madness that's
[28:14] you know it goes on to say here
[28:16] so let take take all my doubt away and
[28:19] let my thoughts be your thoughts
[28:21] just cast away the thoughts of sickness
[28:24] take god's healing thoughts let them
[28:26] become
[28:26] your thoughts think on these things and
[28:29] and
[28:30] it goes back to philippians i'm not
[28:31] going to turn there in philippians
[28:33] but it goes back to the fourth chapter
[28:36] of those are the thoughts that we need
[28:38] to have
[28:38] thoughts of kindness thoughts of health
[28:41] thoughts of treating your brothers and
[28:42] sisters better than you would treat
[28:44] yourself
[28:45] in the age that we live and always
[28:47] putting other people before yourself
[28:49] that's not a that's not a human nature
[28:52] human nature wants to consolidate
[28:55] everything and control everything
[28:56] the christian nature wants to be open
[28:59] and help people
[29:00] and uh if we go to uh
[29:04] i'll get started and i'm i won't be able
[29:07] to get stopped here this morning but i
[29:09] was thinking in this 11th chapter
[29:11] i'm not going to read it i'll just tell
[29:14] you
[29:14] as i before i go sit down this 11th
[29:17] chapter paul is talking about
[29:20] the pharisees the sadducees and the
[29:22] children of israel
[29:23] in his day and he's telling the gentiles
[29:26] that god blinded them
[29:28] and grafted our branch in for our sake
[29:32] and that not to think of yourself
[29:34] greater than you should because if the
[29:36] wild
[29:36] branch is grafted into the good tree and
[29:39] he goes
[29:40] on to finish the chapter i'd be here all
[29:42] day reading the whole chapter telling
[29:44] the christians
[29:46] that they could be as simply pulled out
[29:48] of that tree as easily
[29:50] as they were grafted in and you don't
[29:52] have you don't have any
[29:55] pride in it any belief other than what
[29:58] god has done i'll just finish
[30:00] with these last couple of verses here
[30:03] it starts at it starts at about the
[30:07] 26 so all israel shall be saved as the
[30:10] writtens they shall come out of zion a
[30:13] deliverer that shall turn away the
[30:15] ungodliness from jacob
[30:17] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[30:20] shall take away their sins
[30:22] and that time is upon the face of the
[30:24] earth right now
[30:25] god is eventually going to turn away
[30:27] from the gentile church
[30:29] and move to the to the jews again that
[30:32] time is just
[30:33] it's on hand it's here it's i can't tell
[30:36] you if it's going to be tomorrow
[30:37] or 10 years from now but you can see the
[30:40] signs that we live in that it's
[30:42] it's soon to be churning up there are
[30:45] enemies for your sake as touching the
[30:47] election they are beloved for the
[30:48] father's sake
[30:50] and he goes on to say for the gifts and
[30:51] calling and of god are without
[30:53] repentance
[30:54] for as ye in times past have not
[30:56] believed god yet through
[30:57] now obeying mercy through their unbelief
[31:00] even so have these also now believe that
[31:03] through your mercy they might
[31:06] also obtain mercy for god has concluded
[31:08] them all on their belief
[31:10] that he might have mercy upon them and
[31:12] he goes on this for all the depths and
[31:14] riches
[31:14] both of the wisdom and the knowledge of
[31:16] god how unsearchable are
[31:19] his judgments his ways past finding for
[31:22] who hath known the mind of the lord
[31:24] and who hath been his counselor for what
[31:27] first given to him shall be recounts on
[31:30] to him again for
[31:32] for of him and through him and to him
[31:35] are all things to him be ever
[31:37] glory forever and like i said as a
[31:40] christian
[31:41] it's you know all i can say is that we
[31:44] have a hope in the age
[31:46] that we live in and it's an eternal hope

[1:01:46] montezuma indiana there's a lot of
[1:01:49] amish communities in that area and of
[1:01:52] course
[1:01:53] i don't know if anybody knows brother
[1:01:54] levi fisher
[1:01:57] he came out of the amish community and
[1:02:00] he has i believe accepted this message
[1:02:03] way back in 2012
[1:02:07] and he's passed away passed away
[1:02:10] last year he was about 61 years old he
[1:02:13] had a heat stroke
[1:02:14] and couldn't just couldn't recover and
[1:02:17] uh
[1:02:18] but uh uh his sons now are
[1:02:22] uh or his son the oldest son samuels
[1:02:24] pastoring the
[1:02:25] there's about about 70 in their little
[1:02:28] uh
[1:02:28] group there and that's including uh
[1:02:32] young and old and and also some of the
[1:02:36] ones just from the outside you know just
[1:02:38] coming there
[1:02:39] and uh just a a wonderful bunch a man
[1:02:42] that loves the lord very hungry
[1:02:44] standing on this this the message of the
[1:02:46] word you know
[1:02:47] standing on it strongly amen and and
[1:02:51] just fighting the good night amen and
[1:02:54] uh i was just there two sundays ago
[1:02:58] and i noticed that two families was not
[1:03:00] there and i started asking and they said
[1:03:02] they went to
[1:03:04] ohio the northern part of ohio and there
[1:03:06] was about 10
[1:03:07] families in a little group there of
[1:03:10] amish also that had invited brother
[1:03:12] samuel to come and
[1:03:13] just to kind of you know encourage them
[1:03:16] uh of course when
[1:03:17] uh that i think the next day uh brother
[1:03:20] samuel would
[1:03:21] talk to me and he said everything went
[1:03:23] real well and they just kind of
[1:03:24] encouraged the people there and they
[1:03:26] said now they're
[1:03:26] they're not completely cut off just yet
[1:03:29] but they said that they're
[1:03:30] they're just hungry and they believe
[1:03:32] that there's just more to this
[1:03:34] through the bible that they're holding
[1:03:36] amen and what they're being taught and
[1:03:38] what they believe and they said
[1:03:39] we just we believe there's more and and
[1:03:42] so you know so here
[1:03:43] they had opened the church up there's
[1:03:45] about family attend family when i'm
[1:03:47] saying 10 families of
[1:03:48] amish you know that's about 100 people
[1:03:51] you know
[1:03:52] but anyway so you know that's a pretty
[1:03:54] big group though you know and
[1:03:56] and uh so just remember uh them in
[1:03:59] prayer because brother samuel told me
[1:04:01] that
[1:04:02] it won't be long where they would also
[1:04:04] be cut off also they would be
[1:04:05] excommunicated and you know so but
[1:04:08] and lisa you know they're really
[1:04:11] searching for something
[1:04:12] amen look this this world might
[1:04:15] excommunicate you amen but we've got a
[1:04:17] god with open arms you know and says
[1:04:19] i'll be your friend and then i'll be
[1:04:21] your father i'll be amen i'll be your
[1:04:23] savior i'll be your healer amen glory
[1:04:25] i'll be your provider amen
[1:04:28] amen glory to god and that's that's the
[1:04:30] hope that we're giving them amen and
[1:04:32] and and when they when they heard a
[1:04:35] little bit of what brother samuel had
[1:04:36] bought and they just fell in love with
[1:04:38] it they said
[1:04:38] we want you to know brother samuel you
[1:04:40] are welcome to come back amen
[1:04:42] because like i said they're just seeking
[1:04:44] they're searching they're amen but
[1:04:46] i don't know how long it will take but
[1:04:48] just pray for them amen
[1:04:50] and also not too long ago there was
[1:04:51] another group that was there in
[1:04:52] bloomington and
[1:04:53] they've already been excommunicated and
[1:04:56] brother samuel went there also
[1:04:58] tried to encourage them and trying to
[1:04:59] point them out to close
[1:05:01] you know message churches and things
[1:05:03] like that but uh we have one also not
[1:05:05] too far from where i live in peru
[1:05:07] there's a little group there but of
[1:05:09] course they're already
[1:05:10] sort of established in a little church
[1:05:12] that they found and the brother there
[1:05:14] the pastor
[1:05:15] he's not fully into the message or
[1:05:18] that you would say but he has received
[1:05:21] some materials
[1:05:22] and he says i like it amen and i you
[1:05:25] know he said there's something about it
[1:05:26] amen so
[1:05:27] now you got that little group there i'm
[1:05:29] telling you god is doing something
[1:05:32] amen glory look when you're when maybe
[1:05:35] you don't see something happening in
[1:05:36] your town just think of the next town
[1:05:38] amen or the next city
[1:05:40] or the next state somewhere amen but i
[1:05:42] believe god is working he's still in the
[1:05:44] saving business
[1:05:45] i believe he's still drawing amen he did
[1:05:48] say amen
[1:05:49] everyone that the father has given me
[1:05:51] amen will come to me amen
[1:05:53] of course that's only the half part of
[1:05:55] that verse amen and i believe that's to
[1:05:57] the bride
[1:05:58] amen but the other half is to those
[1:06:00] that's been given the responsibility
[1:06:02] for the bride has what a responsibility
[1:06:04] to point to christ
[1:06:06] and then he says but anyone that does
[1:06:08] come to me i wouldn't know was
[1:06:10] cast out amen i know in ephesians where
[1:06:14] uh they're in thessalonians where he
[1:06:15] said i have chosen unto you
[1:06:18] salvation you cannot show me a scripture
[1:06:21] where god
[1:06:21] chose anybody to be lost there's not one
[1:06:25] his desire was no one was to perish he
[1:06:28] gave amen
[1:06:30] he gave that open door to every human
[1:06:32] race there is out there amen
[1:06:34] look the bride will be in the city and
[1:06:36] there's going to be those outside the
[1:06:38] city
[1:06:40] amen you got the 144 that's what
[1:06:43] gonna be servants to the bride amen
[1:06:46] glory but look
[1:06:48] brother byler this is what i've been
[1:06:49] running into amen and i'm not taking
[1:06:51] about i'm not talking about
[1:06:52] denominational you know systems out
[1:06:54] there i'm talking about this message
[1:06:56] realm amen i've run through people look
[1:06:58] let me tell you something in the
[1:07:00] scriptures
[1:07:01] i can i believe that the scribes and the
[1:07:03] pharisees
[1:07:04] have every right to be religious
[1:07:08] you want to know why because they had
[1:07:11] the whole
[1:07:12] truth they had the whole word
[1:07:16] they just didn't act on it the way they
[1:07:18] were supposed to amen they had a
[1:07:20] different attitude they lost their
[1:07:21] compassion amen
[1:07:23] they got to the place where a spirit
[1:07:25] fell on them then it was like
[1:07:27] whatever they could just gain in their
[1:07:28] pocket you know they didn't care about
[1:07:30] those that
[1:07:31] you know were having a hard time or they
[1:07:34] got to the place say man that this is
[1:07:36] what i'm running into that
[1:07:37] i'm bride so i believe that i deserve
[1:07:40] everything
[1:07:42] the blessing only comes to the bride
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:46] that's not the inheritance is yeah i
[1:07:48] believe the bride gets the inheritance
[1:07:50] don't get me wrong amen
[1:07:52] but look i i i have had to talk to some
[1:07:55] people i'm like
[1:07:56] look as soon as you revolve yourself in
[1:07:58] that revelation that your bride which is
[1:08:00] good
[1:08:01] i said then before you know it you're
[1:08:03] just like the pharisees or the scribes
[1:08:08] i said i have every right brother byler
[1:08:10] to be religious this morning
[1:08:11] because i got the full truth amen but i
[1:08:14] want to act right
[1:08:16] hey man i want to look at the very ones
[1:08:19] that i believe that are sinners and say
[1:08:20] hey you know what
[1:08:22] don't you know you got the opportunity
[1:08:24] to
[1:08:26] not just to feel like you know you know
[1:08:28] i believe i
[1:08:29] i'm bright so you know all of this is
[1:08:31] mine
[1:08:33] and that's true we're going to receive
[1:08:35] it amen but share
[1:08:38] a little bit amen glory amen
[1:08:41] tell them there's no one out there that
[1:08:44] god ever desired to be lost amen the
[1:08:46] only reason they're lost is because
[1:08:48] they chose to be lost they chose that
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:52] god didn't choose that amen but yeah he
[1:08:55] had everything prepared
[1:08:57] he created hell because he knew amen by
[1:09:00] the foreknowledge of god he already knew
[1:09:03] amen glory that who am i to judge
[1:09:08] who am i to point fingers amen glory
[1:09:12] regardless of the the whatever that
[1:09:14] woman or that man or whatever life
[1:09:16] they're living
[1:09:17] i i can't look at them and say hey you
[1:09:19] deserve everything that's coming to you
[1:09:24] that's a wrong attitude amen
[1:09:27] look uh there's a side of jonah let me
[1:09:30] tell you something jonah was a man of
[1:09:31] god
[1:09:32] i'm sorry i haven't got to my scriptures
[1:09:33] but i believe i believe the holy
[1:09:35] spirit's talking to us amen
[1:09:36] he's not just talking to you he's
[1:09:38] talking to me amen look we're talking
[1:09:40] about maybe an attitude change here
[1:09:43] look rapture's around the corner amen i
[1:09:45] believe brother branham said when he
[1:09:47] said if there's just what
[1:09:48] a scratch of a hot you know an aux just
[1:09:51] a little small scratch
[1:09:54] he said that could kick you out
[1:09:58] i i think i'd like to seek my own
[1:10:00] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:10:03] lord i want to make sure that i'm really
[1:10:05] going to make it in amen but look
[1:10:08] i you know i want to win a soul
[1:10:11] regardless if they're in the city or
[1:10:14] outside the city
[1:10:16] amen i like what a brother said he said
[1:10:17] you know what if i'm not in a city but
[1:10:19] lord please
[1:10:20] at least let me outside the city let me
[1:10:23] be able to stand there and see
[1:10:25] how the bride and her glory walking into
[1:10:28] that gate you know
[1:10:30] amen yeah it's going to be sad for those
[1:10:34] that's going to be outside the city amen
[1:10:35] they'll have to go through the
[1:10:36] tribulation and all of that but
[1:10:38] look salvation was still for them
[1:10:41] amen hallelujah
[1:10:44] amen but i have come across with some
[1:10:46] people with such attitude and
[1:10:48] i'm telling you i was like my it just
[1:10:50] breaks my heart
[1:10:53] what about your neighbor what about your
[1:10:55] friend
[1:10:56] that you know that's not serving the
[1:10:57] lord but what about him are you so
[1:11:00] revolving your
[1:11:01] your revelation that you know you're
[1:11:02] gonna make it but what are you doing
[1:11:04] on trying to get him you know or her
[1:11:08] i believe that's our responsibility
[1:11:11] amen glory praise the lord
[1:11:15] you know i i i get the one of the things
[1:11:17] that hits me a lot is uh brother paul
[1:11:19] do you believe you're born with the seed
[1:11:21] you're not born with the seed
[1:11:24] i was like brother i have searched i
[1:11:26] have searched this message and i have
[1:11:28] never heard
[1:11:29] the phrase born with a seed or not born
[1:11:32] with a seed
[1:11:35] i i've never seen it i said what kind of
[1:11:37] doctrine is that
[1:11:38] i said i believe in divine election
[1:11:42] god chose before the foundation of the
[1:11:44] world
[1:11:46] amen look the eagle was born an eagle
[1:11:50] though he was in the chicken barn
[1:11:54] but once he heard oh that's me
[1:11:58] amen glory amen but i believe god's got
[1:12:01] it all laid out amen
[1:12:03] hallelujah let me uh
[1:12:06] read a scripture to you and
[1:12:09] maybe for just uh standing on the word
[1:12:12] you know i was mentioning uh jonah you
[1:12:15] know i believe jonah had to get an
[1:12:17] attitude change you know you know when
[1:12:20] he began to was called to go to nineveh
[1:12:23] jonah knew exactly what nineveh was
[1:12:27] amen now jonah you won't read nothing
[1:12:30] about
[1:12:31] you know the really cruel things about
[1:12:33] nineveh in the book of jonah
[1:12:35] but if you go in the book of naham now
[1:12:38] the prophet nahan will explain to you
[1:12:40] everything about nineveh amen and then
[1:12:44] you'll know
[1:12:44] that's why that's why jonah didn't want
[1:12:48] to go
[1:12:49] he even he even beseeched god
[1:12:52] begged him to say kill me now
[1:12:55] me he says kill me now because i do not
[1:12:57] want to go
[1:12:59] jonah had an attitude where you know
[1:13:01] what
[1:13:03] they deserve what they're getting they
[1:13:05] deserve that judgment that they're
[1:13:07] getting but god
[1:13:08] send them and because of his stubborn
[1:13:10] men yeah he was swallowed by a fish and
[1:13:12] amen was there three days and three
[1:13:15] nights and
[1:13:16] my but he went amen
[1:13:20] even on that boat jonah i don't think he
[1:13:22] knew he was doing a missionary work
[1:13:25] amen and there was there was those
[1:13:29] scribes and pharisees amen
[1:13:33] amen they were there and it he couldn't
[1:13:35] get them to turn but here's
[1:13:37] pagan people amen the bible says they
[1:13:40] they cried out to their each gods each
[1:13:43] of their own gods they had a different
[1:13:45] god each one of them
[1:13:46] those men in that boat
[1:13:49] start to cry out to them amen
[1:13:54] but there was jonah doing a ministry
[1:13:56] didn't even know it running from god
[1:13:58] he was running from god and god was
[1:14:00] still using him you want to run i'm
[1:14:02] still going to
[1:14:02] save people the whole boat was converted
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:07] hallelujah that's god amen glory
[1:14:12] hallelujah but you know it's just
[1:14:14] sometimes we just get that way
[1:14:16] you know i've ran into some people that
[1:14:18] i tell you what when all this
[1:14:20] coronavirus was going on and
[1:14:22] and it was really it yeah it just seems
[1:14:24] like judgment i believe it was judgment
[1:14:26] hitting the
[1:14:26] this earth amen and you had those that i
[1:14:29] came across and
[1:14:30] my loves the lord but then they said
[1:14:32] well they deserve what they're getting
[1:14:35] i was like no
[1:14:38] amen i said they have just as every
[1:14:41] right
[1:14:42] they have every opportunity there is the
[1:14:44] salvation
[1:14:45] amen what you should have been doing is
[1:14:47] praying for them
[1:14:50] amen glory amen let me tell you
[1:14:53] something
[1:14:54] if we believe raptors right around the
[1:14:56] corner i tell you we need to check our
[1:14:58] attitudes
[1:14:59] we need to check our lives hey man we
[1:15:02] need to check our hearts
[1:15:04] amen glory i mean our brother was
[1:15:07] reading all those scriptures he was
[1:15:08] talking about the the pharisees and the
[1:15:10] way their attitudes were and
[1:15:14] amen i tell you what we're supposed to
[1:15:17] be different brother
[1:15:19] we're supposed to be different amen in
[1:15:22] your bibles if you stand in ephesians
[1:15:24] chapter one
[1:15:26] amen and i believe you only have one
[1:15:28] service today so
[1:15:29] uh i don't know how long am i supposed
[1:15:31] to preach brother byler
[1:15:34] until i'm done okay amen praise the lord
[1:15:36] now i'm the pastor have spoken
[1:15:40] amen glory to god amen
[1:15:43] ephesians chapter one there in verse
[1:15:46] starting in verse 11 through 14
[1:15:49] says uh in whom also we have
[1:15:52] obtained an inheritance being
[1:15:55] predestinated according
[1:15:57] to the purpose of him who worketh all
[1:15:59] things
[1:16:00] after the council of his own will that
[1:16:03] we should be
[1:16:04] to the praise amen listen now
[1:16:07] that we should be
[1:16:10] is that tomorrow or next week or is that
[1:16:12] today
[1:16:14] amen that we should be to the praise of
[1:16:17] his glory
[1:16:18] who first trusted in christ amen you
[1:16:21] trust him this morning
[1:16:22] amen and i believe there's many back
[1:16:25] then back then amen
[1:16:27] had trusted the lord when they heard the
[1:16:28] word when they heard the gospel amen
[1:16:31] amen now verse 13 in whom ye also
[1:16:34] trusted
[1:16:34] after that you heard the word of the of
[1:16:37] truth
[1:16:38] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[1:16:41] all
[1:16:42] so after that you believed ye were
[1:16:45] sealed
[1:16:46] with the holy spirit of promise amen
[1:16:49] now look tell yourself this amen the
[1:16:52] holy
[1:16:53] spirit of promise
[1:16:57] that cannot be broken amen that's god's
[1:17:00] word
[1:17:02] amen he can't go back on that amen
[1:17:05] the holy spirit of promise which is the
[1:17:08] earnest amen
[1:17:09] of our inheritance amen until the
[1:17:13] redemption
[1:17:13] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:17:16] praise
[1:17:17] of his glory amen glory to god may the
[1:17:20] lord have his blessing on the rest of
[1:17:21] the reading of the word
[1:17:22] amen and you may be seated amen now uh
[1:17:25] in whom also we have obtained
[1:17:28] is saying amen now here you know
[1:17:31] one vital uh feature of the mystery is
[1:17:34] believing
[1:17:35] is here because when we when you begin
[1:17:37] to look at sometimes the scriptures
[1:17:39] and you'll you'll see like sometimes you
[1:17:42] go back to like studying paul and here
[1:17:44] he is
[1:17:44] and sometimes he'll refer to jews and
[1:17:46] also he's
[1:17:47] referring to gentiles amen when you
[1:17:49] begin to read things here
[1:17:51] so one vital feature here of the mystery
[1:17:54] is
[1:17:54] is the believing jews and also believing
[1:17:57] gentiles
[1:17:58] have their what their share in this
[1:18:00] grand
[1:18:01] program of god there's going to be many
[1:18:04] you know let me tell you something i
[1:18:06] want i want you to to to
[1:18:08] to think about this you don't have to be
[1:18:10] bribed
[1:18:12] to make it in okay
[1:18:16] but if god has given you that revelation
[1:18:20] you see yourself as bride then well
[1:18:23] praise the lord glory to god amen
[1:18:27] hallelujah but there's those
[1:18:30] amen but look once you receive that that
[1:18:33] revelation
[1:18:35] then you hold a great responsibility
[1:18:38] amen you hold a really great
[1:18:40] responsibility why because now you need
[1:18:42] to be the example
[1:18:44] to the ones that needs to be outside the
[1:18:47] city
[1:18:47] sometimes we gotten slothful and lazy
[1:18:50] and
[1:18:51] i don't know we get caught up
[1:18:54] amen with so many things you know that's
[1:18:57] that's what's one of the devil's tactics
[1:19:00] amen glory so here
[1:19:04] there's a share into this program you
[1:19:06] know and here the apostle you know
[1:19:08] speaks of the mystery you know and in
[1:19:11] relation to jewish believers
[1:19:13] amen especially in verse 11 and 12 and
[1:19:16] also in relation to gentile believers
[1:19:18] in verse 13 and also 14. amen and as for
[1:19:22] the christian
[1:19:23] of jewish history or ancestry
[1:19:26] amen paul writes in him
[1:19:29] he writes here and he says now
[1:19:32] in him also
[1:19:35] we have what obtained an
[1:19:38] inheritance amen so their right to
[1:19:42] share is not based amen
[1:19:45] on their former national
[1:19:48] privileges it's not because they were
[1:19:52] jews
[1:19:54] it's not because well i'm a jew i'm i'm
[1:19:57] god's chosen i'm god's people
[1:20:01] because not all jews were born that way
[1:20:04] but that doesn't mean that there's those
[1:20:07] outside 144 that won't
[1:20:09] maybe make it because the whole thing is
[1:20:14] john 3 16 amen
[1:20:17] for god so loved the world and then now
[1:20:19] god says that bride's not the world
[1:20:23] amen but look god's got to fulfill
[1:20:26] scriptures
[1:20:26] the bride is not excluded when it comes
[1:20:29] to baptism
[1:20:30] when it comes to the calvary shredding
[1:20:33] and shedding of the blood
[1:20:34] being covered by the atonement amen
[1:20:36] she's not excluded amen
[1:20:38] we all came from adam and eve glory to
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:42] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:20:45] that jesus himself
[1:20:46] that was sinless and because scriptures
[1:20:49] had to be fulfilled
[1:20:50] had to be baptized amen
[1:20:54] the the bride god does not allow the
[1:20:56] bride to just
[1:20:57] bypass anything uh you know
[1:21:03] no it doesn't happen that way let me
[1:21:05] tell you something i don't think god
[1:21:07] sweeps uh you know look he doesn't bless
[1:21:09] over sin either
[1:21:14] let me let me tell you this right now
[1:21:15] there's no plan b brothers and sisters
[1:21:18] it's all plant there's it's all plan a
[1:21:20] amen there's only one way
[1:21:23] amen and everybody's got to go through
[1:21:25] christ
[1:21:26] amen so here they are amen and it's not
[1:21:29] about their
[1:21:30] their their national uh privileges or
[1:21:32] anything like that not just because they
[1:21:34] can say well i'm a jew
[1:21:36] amen or anything like that you know but
[1:21:39] it was solely on their
[1:21:40] union with christ that's what it was
[1:21:44] amen you and i
[1:21:45] amen glory to god so here they are so
[1:21:48] the inheritance
[1:21:49] you know here looks forward amen to the
[1:21:52] time
[1:21:53] when they what and all true believers
[1:21:55] will be
[1:21:56] manifested to an amazed world
[1:21:59] glory as what the body of christ
[1:22:05] yeah there's part of this world it is
[1:22:06] going to hell
[1:22:08] amen and that's sad to say you know you
[1:22:11] there there should be no one here that
[1:22:14] claims to be a christian that that's
[1:22:15] easy for you to just say you know what
[1:22:18] there's people going to hell
[1:22:20] you know every time i say that it's oh
[1:22:22] my inside of me it's like

[1:24:43] this for this place of
[1:24:45] privilege by the you know the sovereign
[1:24:47] will of god
[1:24:48] and and here you know being

[1:32:14] hallelujah
[1:32:16] praise god you know
[1:32:19] the apostle speaks of himself and other
[1:32:22] believing jews
[1:32:23] as as we who first trusted in christ
[1:32:25] that's what he said
[1:32:27] you know who first trusted in christ
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:30] you know he is thinking of what the
[1:32:32] godly remnant of jews
[1:32:34] amen who responded to the gospel amen in
[1:32:37] the early days
[1:32:38] of christianity amen
[1:32:42] the good news was what first preached
[1:32:44] amen to the jews
[1:32:47] amen and most of the nation of israel
[1:32:51] flatly rejected it that's right
[1:32:55] amen glory to god
[1:33:00] you know he had a he god had a bride
[1:33:02] once the jews
[1:33:04] and he had to put her divorcement amen
[1:33:09] then he went to the gentiles and said
[1:33:11] i'll find me another bride
[1:33:14] glory to god oh aren't you
[1:33:17] don't you feel special i was engrafted
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:23] brother brandon was talking there in the
[1:33:24] 70 weeks of daniel where
[1:33:26] god purposely
[1:33:30] this is god you're talking you're
[1:33:31] looking at amen think about it
[1:33:33] god purposely blinded
[1:33:36] the jews so you
[1:33:40] could see amen it was a no
[1:33:44] accident that they blinded god purposely
[1:33:47] blinded them so you and i could see
[1:33:51] glory to god how mindful your god is
[1:33:54] because he saw you and he says i want
[1:33:56] them amen i want you brother byler
[1:33:58] i want you sister i want you brother

[1:34:10] cried
[1:34:11] i went i was driving i was driving
[1:34:15] i can't remember if i had to pull over
[1:34:16] or not but i know i don't know if i even
[1:34:18] got it to work i
[1:34:19] got to where i was going but i i was
[1:34:21] bawling so hard i was just
[1:34:23] i was so excited within myself to know
[1:34:25] that the god i'm serving
[1:34:27] purposely purposely amen
[1:34:31] did that for me
[1:34:34] amen and when you begin to look at you
[1:34:36] know god from the very beginning amen he
[1:34:38] already knew you
[1:34:40] amen glory you know when he was talking
[1:34:42] to jeremiah and he says
[1:34:43] i already knew you before you even farm
[1:34:46] in your
[1:34:47] mother's womb amen can you imagine that
[1:34:49] there was
[1:34:50] in the very thought of god brother byler
[1:34:52] where he probably at one time
[1:34:54] walked and put his arms around you
[1:34:57] fellowship with you and you didn't even
[1:34:59] know it that was all going on what
[1:35:02] in his mind
[1:35:05] oh my glory i mean
[1:35:09] that might be looking way back then but
[1:35:11] still his mind is eternal
[1:35:13] he saw exactly amen and you weren't even
[1:35:16] born yet
[1:35:17] in his mind he was already
[1:35:18] fellowshipping with you amen
[1:35:22] he already comforted you amen hallelujah
[1:35:25] when he said i've searched it all out
[1:35:27] amen that was before the foundation of
[1:35:29] the world
[1:35:31] amen hallelujah oh i knew exactly what
[1:35:34] day you were sick
[1:35:36] oh i could feel the pain man hallelujah
[1:35:39] i know what you was going through
[1:35:42] of course you know he you know when he
[1:35:43] was god he didn't know the you know the
[1:35:45] holy spirit don't suffer
[1:35:47] that's why he needed that flesh
[1:35:50] amen he wanted to experience it but he
[1:35:53] had to experience it amen glory to god
[1:35:57] and he carried it to the cross
[1:35:58] amen and it was a finished work amen
[1:36:00] glory
[1:36:01] hallelujah amen glory
[1:36:05] now here you know the godly remnant
[1:36:09] believed on the lord jesus say man you
[1:36:11] know paul was one of them
[1:36:13] amen amen so here paul
[1:36:16] you know now in verse 13 paul switches
[1:36:20] from believers who had been born jews
[1:36:23] to those who had been born gentiles amen
[1:36:26] and he
[1:36:26] indicates that this by by changing form
[1:36:29] to
[1:36:30] we to you
[1:36:33] amen because in verse 11 and 12 he kept
[1:36:36] saying we
[1:36:36] we amen now he's like what now he's put
[1:36:40] the jews to the side and he's saying
[1:36:42] you you you
[1:36:47] amen
[1:36:50] now those who who have been born you
[1:36:52] know have been saved
[1:36:54] amen from paganism you know have a share
[1:36:57] in the mystery of god's will as well as
[1:36:59] what converted jews amen
[1:37:03] and so the apostle here you know what
[1:37:06] traces the steps you know
[1:37:07] by by by which the ephesians say man and
[1:37:10] other gentiles have been brought
[1:37:12] into union with christ you know he goes
[1:37:14] all the way
[1:37:15] those that have heard this gospel
[1:37:20] and that you know they heard the gospel
[1:37:21] they believed in christ
[1:37:23] they were sealed they were sealed with
[1:37:26] the holy spirit of promise
[1:37:28] first they heard the word of truth amen
[1:37:31] the gospel of their salvation and
[1:37:34] basically this refers to
[1:37:35] the good news of salvation through faith
[1:37:38] in the lord jesus
[1:37:40] amen but in a wider sense amen
[1:37:44] it includes all all the teachings of
[1:37:47] christ amen
[1:37:48] and the apostles hallelujah
[1:37:52] and having heard this message amen they
[1:37:55] made a commitment
[1:37:56] amen i hope we're making a commitment
[1:37:58] today
[1:38:00] of themselves to christ amen by a what
[1:38:03] a deceptive they meant to to act on
[1:38:05] their faith amen
[1:38:07] if you truly believed and act on it amen
[1:38:10] as the scripture says you know we don't
[1:38:12] only
[1:38:13] it's not only by sight but and all of
[1:38:15] those things but it's by faith amen
[1:38:19] but there's a scripture where it says
[1:38:20] you know we must do the walk
[1:38:23] we don't just talk only but we walk the
[1:38:26] talk
[1:38:27] amen well if you can talk it i hope we
[1:38:30] can walk it
[1:38:32] amen glory and here they are amen
[1:38:36] and salvation is found and what him
[1:38:38] alone
[1:38:40] only christ hallelujah and as soon as
[1:38:43] they believed they were what sealed with
[1:38:45] the holy
[1:38:45] spirit of promise amen glory and here
[1:38:49] you know this means that every true
[1:38:50] believer amen
[1:38:51] receives the spirit of god amen as a
[1:38:54] sign
[1:38:55] that he belongs to god amen you belong
[1:38:58] to him
[1:39:01] amen glory and that he will be what
[1:39:05] kept he will be kept safe by god until
[1:39:08] the time
[1:39:09] amen he receives his glorified body amen
[1:39:13] i'll be honest with you i'm
[1:39:17] not in my goal they say by revelation
[1:39:19] i'm in it already
[1:39:23] i'm glad that you have a revelation of
[1:39:26] the glorified body but
[1:39:28] amen i believe in heavenly places amen
[1:39:32] glory to god
[1:39:33] but let me tell you something i know
[1:39:34] what the glorified body is look
[1:39:36] there's a difference between the
[1:39:37] glorified body and the theophany
[1:39:41] because in your glorified body amen you
[1:39:44] can eat
[1:39:46] you can drink you can enjoy the very
[1:39:48] things that god amen
[1:39:50] has created you for look this earth is
[1:39:53] what you're going to inherit too
[1:39:55] it'll be all cleaned up and pure
[1:39:59] all right amen again
[1:40:02] amen you'll never have to worry about
[1:40:05] some t
[1:40:06] some sister touching you and having any
[1:40:08] kind of glance you know
[1:40:11] you'll never lust again everything will
[1:40:14] be pure
[1:40:17] amen glory
[1:40:20] oh what a day that'll be hallelujah
[1:40:23] what an inheritance amen to look forward
[1:40:26] to
[1:40:27] amen glory and here
[1:40:32] you know
[1:40:37] just as in legal matters a seal
[1:40:40] indicates what
[1:40:42] ownership and security
[1:40:46] so it does also in the divine fair
[1:40:48] affairs of god
[1:40:51] amen what affairs you have as an
[1:40:53] individual between you
[1:40:55] and god god has a seal on that
[1:40:58] and that seal amen it doesn't matter
[1:41:01] what demon what devil comes that way
[1:41:03] they'll see that seal and they say he
[1:41:05] belongs to somebody already
[1:41:09] oh they'll try to sneak in there amen
[1:41:14] amen they try
[1:41:18] amen glory look the indwelling spirit
[1:41:22] brings us as god's property amen glory
[1:41:26] you belong to him our seal is called the
[1:41:29] holy spirit
[1:41:30] amen of promise amen first he is the
[1:41:32] holy spirit
[1:41:33] this is what he is in himself
[1:41:37] then he is spirit of promise
[1:41:40] amen even the spirit himself he don't
[1:41:42] even keep that
[1:41:43] all to himself you know the bible says
[1:41:46] that he shared
[1:41:48] that divine power he says that that
[1:41:51] divine power
[1:41:52] he shared that with you
[1:41:55] can you imagine can you tell me what
[1:41:57] devil out there could stop
[1:41:59] the very divine power of god
[1:42:04] none and if he shared that remember now
[1:42:07] we're
[1:42:08] heirs amen we're co-heirs we're heirs
[1:42:11] amen
[1:42:13] and he shared he said he shared that
[1:42:14] power with you
[1:42:17] might and and sometimes the devil comes
[1:42:20] our way and
[1:42:21] we just act like a bunch of losers when
[1:42:24] the bible says we're winners
[1:42:27] and the devil's running saying i'm a
[1:42:29] winner and they're losers
[1:42:31] and we make him feel like he is winner
[1:42:34] and we act like a bunch of losers
[1:42:37] when our bible says he shared that that
[1:42:39] power that
[1:42:40] it even says that very divine nature
[1:42:45] not only the power but the very divine
[1:42:47] nature of god
[1:42:49] has been placed within you
[1:42:52] my then you wonder why when brother adam
[1:42:54] says amen that when
[1:42:56] the weakest christian falls on his knees
[1:42:59] and praise amen the devil's tremble amen
[1:43:03] glory to god
[1:43:05] hallelujah glory
[1:43:09] praise god amen look he was promised by
[1:43:12] the father
[1:43:14] father amen in the book of joel chapter
[1:43:16] 2 there in acts chapter 1
[1:43:18] also in john 16 amen and in addition
[1:43:20] amen he is what
[1:43:22] he is the guarantee amen that all god's
[1:43:25] promise amen to the believers
[1:43:27] will be fulfilled every promise you will
[1:43:30] find in this book
[1:43:31] has to be fulfilled and if it's not
[1:43:34] fulfilled
[1:43:35] here while you're on earth amen he
[1:43:38] promised amen
[1:43:39] that the very overcomers of each church
[1:43:42] age amen
[1:43:44] would receive a reward and can you
[1:43:47] imagine that the first
[1:43:49] church age amen their reward they'll
[1:43:52] receive that
[1:43:53] the second church age has a reward too
[1:43:55] but if they overcome
[1:43:57] they get their reward plus the first
[1:43:59] church age reward
[1:44:02] because they're not only fighting amen
[1:44:04] what the first church age went
[1:44:06] through the second church age now is
[1:44:07] fighting what came upon them
[1:44:10] and what was upon the first
[1:44:13] amen so can you imagine this laodicean
[1:44:16] church
[1:44:16] look i'm not laodicean church age amen
[1:44:19] but i'm the overcomer
[1:44:21] that's in the laosian church age i'm the
[1:44:24] overcomer that's receiving what
[1:44:25] the first church age reward the second
[1:44:27] church age reward the third the fourth
[1:44:29] the fifth the sixth
[1:44:30] amen glory do you know what your reward
[1:44:34] is amen
[1:44:35] for the laodiceans reward to those that
[1:44:37] overcomes in the laodicean
[1:44:39] you'll sit with him in the throne glory
[1:44:44] amen but you know what else benefits you
[1:44:46] get all the rest amen
[1:44:48] and one of those that says that you'll
[1:44:50] what feasts
[1:44:52] on the hidden manna amen glory
[1:44:55] what you might not receive here amen
[1:44:58] you're going to get it over there
[1:45:00] amen and you think preachers today amen
[1:45:03] that one day they're going to run out to
[1:45:05] preach up
[1:45:06] i don't think so amen
[1:45:11] the lord is eternal hey man there's
[1:45:14] always going to be some manna
[1:45:16] amen and if he's promising manna
[1:45:19] on the other side then he's got to keep
[1:45:21] his promise from manna
[1:45:23] on this side amen glory
[1:45:27] amen and here in chapter 14 you know
[1:45:31] again paul
[1:45:32] changes you know his his pronouns amen
[1:45:35] he he merges amen the we amen of of
[1:45:38] verse 11 and 12
[1:45:40] with with the you verse 13 through the
[1:45:43] form of
[1:45:44] our in verse 14.
[1:45:47] amen so here you can see paul
[1:45:50] didn't have an attitude didn't he paul
[1:45:54] knew the bride i guarantee paul knew he
[1:45:57] was part of the bride
[1:46:00] but when he saw the other jews that
[1:46:02] might have not been bribed
[1:46:03] but he knew they would be in the city
[1:46:06] amen and how he could
[1:46:08] share this gospel and say look we're
[1:46:11] sharing amen this inheritance amen
[1:46:13] there's going to be something apart amen
[1:46:16] that you're going to receive from god
[1:46:19] but he didn't have the attitude of just
[1:46:21] i'm bright only i'm bright only
[1:46:25] when he talked about these four
[1:46:26] knowledge that did predestinate
[1:46:28] all of these and all that he wasn't just
[1:46:30] didn't want them to like it was just
[1:46:31] bright
[1:46:34] he wanted to know that everybody that
[1:46:36] would actually
[1:46:37] receive the good news of salvation had
[1:46:40] an opportunity
[1:46:43] i don't think paul was walking with an
[1:46:45] attitude amen
[1:46:47] amen glory to god i believe his desire
[1:46:50] within his heart
[1:46:51] maybe at one time yes he lived life
[1:46:53] where he was killing the christians
[1:46:55] he was trying to put an end to it a man
[1:46:57] glory but god got a hold of him
[1:47:00] amen if god can use a man like that amen
[1:47:04] my what about my friend what about my
[1:47:07] other families i mean it's not serving

[1:47:16] what you're going to make it too
[1:47:19] but i don't know that
[1:47:22] but if i receive a revelation that oh i
[1:47:25] i know i'm making it in look if you have
[1:47:27] a revelation you're going to make it in
[1:47:29] you're holding a great responsibility to
[1:47:31] at least share that with that person
[1:47:35] amen glory i don't you know you have an
[1:47:38] opportunity to
[1:47:39] don't you know god loves you you know
[1:47:41] god didn't choose
[1:47:42] you to be lost he said i chose unto you
[1:47:45] salvation

[1:56:39] inheritance
[1:56:40] and of my cup and he says thou

[1:56:46] amen that means he gave god all liberty
[1:56:50] amen all control
[1:56:53] amen hallelujah
[1:56:57] and here he says in verse 6 the lines
[1:57:00] are fallen

[1:57:08] goodly heritage

[1:57:27] rest in god amen
[1:57:31] amen let me tell you something if you
[1:57:33] could look at david's life amen
[1:57:36] i'm sure he could walk into one room in
[1:57:38] his castle
[1:57:39] amen or whatever estate he was in
[1:57:43] and it was a big room probably just full
[1:57:46] of
[1:57:46] gold jewelry money
[1:57:50] you know and he could walk in one room
[1:57:52] and probably all the things that was
[1:57:53] collected from
[1:57:55] here and there from all the great
[1:57:57] battles and
[1:58:01] amen he could
[1:58:04] step on his front porch you know above
[1:58:07] his estate and he could see a bar off
[1:58:11] and now exactly you know he could see
[1:58:14] why all of this is mine
[1:58:16] he could look down and see his people
[1:58:19] you can see his horseman's
[1:58:20] his chariots his my everything that he
[1:58:24] but he says my wealth
[1:58:28] amen that's not where his joy was lying
[1:58:30] amen he didn't stood there
[1:58:32] like oh my goodness i'm so happy look at
[1:58:35] everything i've got
[1:58:39] amen look at my chariots look at my
[1:58:41] horsemen look at my horses
[1:58:44] look at the fields hey man look at all
[1:58:45] the people i rule
[1:58:48] that one that's not where he put his
[1:58:50] enjoyment
[1:58:51] he said he said all my wealth amen and
[1:58:54] enjoyment
[1:58:54] rest in god
[1:58:58] amen it is the lord who guards amen the
[1:59:01] boundaries
[1:59:02] of his inheritance amen
[1:59:06] glory to god you know as he thinks you
[1:59:08] know of how
[1:59:09] wisely amen and wonderfully the father
[1:59:12] has planned
[1:59:13] every detail amen glory to god
[1:59:16] of his life he compares it
[1:59:20] amen to a pleasant estate amen glory now
[1:59:23] i'm not saying david wasn't happy
[1:59:26] amen but when you read the book of ma
[1:59:30] right he was either running from
[1:59:32] something or he was like he was
[1:59:34] miserable
[1:59:37] but even though he was experiencing all
[1:59:39] of those things
[1:59:40] amen you can you imagine have you ever
[1:59:44] read psalms 22
[1:59:47] where it first starts out my god my god
[1:59:51] why thou has forsaken me and that's all
[1:59:54] a type of christ
[1:59:55] what christ was going through very
[1:59:57] beautifully
[1:59:58] and here what's david doing sharing the
[2:00:01] same agony that he's going through the
[2:00:03] same thing amen
[2:00:06] oh my but when you begin to come down
[2:00:09] amen to the very middle of that chapter
[2:00:11] amen
[2:00:12] and you begin to see david's about to
[2:00:14] step into something
[2:00:17] even though he was going through all of
[2:00:18] that amen in the middle
[2:00:20] toward the end amen what was he stepping
[2:00:23] into
[2:00:24] verse 23 chapter 23 my lord is my
[2:00:28] shepherd
[2:00:29] i shall not want amen glory
[2:00:32] though he had all of those things amen
[2:00:34] that's not what he was really wanting
[2:00:36] amen but he knew within himself
[2:00:38] amen that his portion was the lord so
[2:00:41] now he had it within himself there was
[2:00:42] nothing else he wanted
[2:00:46] david was not pursuing to add more lands
[2:00:49] amen
[2:00:49] i never read that in the scripture where
[2:00:51] david was pursuing to
[2:00:53] to add more to his collection
[2:00:57] amen all he wanted was
[2:01:00] more of christ
[2:01:03] amen glory to god that's what he wanted
[2:01:06] more amen of his true inheritance
[2:01:10] was god amen how many of us is pursuing
[2:01:13] those kind of things amen
[2:01:16] amen one more of what god has
[2:01:19] for us amen about what this world can
[2:01:22] give look
[2:01:23] the the lord's gonna use what's out here
[2:01:25] to
[2:01:26] so you can survive because he said i'll
[2:01:29] give you everything you need of
[2:01:32] he's responsible amen
[2:01:35] he's responsible of his estate
[2:01:38] and that's you he's going to make sure
[2:01:41] that you have
[2:01:41] everything you need of physically
[2:01:45] or spiritually amen
[2:01:48] but when you begin to pursue once
[2:01:52] then that's all on you
[2:01:56] amen and sometimes god just sits back
[2:01:58] and watches you
[2:02:00] make a fool of yourself oh he'll be back
[2:02:04] around
[2:02:05] all he'll learn oh that son of mine you
[2:02:09] know
[2:02:10] oh he might be stubborn now but
[2:02:13] i'll make sure i'll make a way he'll
[2:02:16] realize
[2:02:18] amen glory god is good i tell you
[2:02:23] amen and look if we are living in
[2:02:26] fellowship with god
[2:02:28] we too can praise him amen for the for
[2:02:30] the ordering of our lives
[2:02:32] the bible says he orders our steps right
[2:02:35] amen we'll give him praise for that
[2:02:37] that he actually knows where to place
[2:02:39] you each day amen regardless if it's
[2:02:41] walmart
[2:02:42] amen or whatever and maybe that day you
[2:02:44] went to walmart
[2:02:45] you never felt like there was a purpose
[2:02:47] other than to just go buy your groceries

[2:14:14] rest on that amen glory
[2:14:18] amen but it also says but it is
[2:14:21] through faith amen see that is the human
[2:14:25] side
[2:14:26] you've got to trust also you've got to
[2:14:28] have faith amen glory to god
[2:14:31] but here look you know
[2:14:34] now this doesn't mean that a person is
[2:14:37] saved only as long
[2:14:39] as he exercises faith no
[2:14:44] i believe in exercising faith but just
[2:14:45] because you exercise faith don't mean
[2:14:48] i don't really mean a whole lot but i
[2:14:51] also know god

[2:15:56] 6 now where it says wherein
[2:15:59] ye greatly rejoice ye
[2:16:02] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[2:16:06] if need be ye are in heaviness he says
[2:16:09] heaviness through manifold temptations
[2:16:14] oh my so there's gonna be temptations
[2:16:17] there's going to be trials
[2:16:21] amen you know there's a scripture in
[2:16:23] isaiah where it says that
[2:16:25] no weapon form no weapon that is
[2:16:29] formed shall prosper amen
[2:16:32] i mean he's i mean he's hanging on to
[2:16:34] that promise amen but let me
[2:16:36] let me show you something in that
[2:16:37] scripture amen we don't have to turn to
[2:16:39] it
[2:16:39] and it says no weapon that is formed
[2:16:42] now what it says there's no weapon that
[2:16:44] is for so that means the scripture's not
[2:16:46] saying that weapons are not
[2:16:48] formed that means weapons are
[2:16:52] formed and they do exist
[2:16:56] and look the devil knows how to form
[2:16:59] weapons
[2:17:00] and look and they don't have to be a gun
[2:17:02] they don't have to be a knife
[2:17:04] amen they don't have to be a weapon that
[2:17:06] what you would think

[2:17:30] there's a good side
[2:17:34] there's a good sight good and evil
[2:17:37] but the devil knows how to form weapons
[2:17:40] and sometimes the weapons that he will
[2:17:42] place in your hands
[2:17:43] will be such a simple thing and it's not
[2:17:46] to destroy your neighbor
[2:17:47] or your whoever it is he'll place it in
[2:17:50] your hands so you can destroy
[2:17:54] yourself

[2:18:32] and you know what he did he formed a
[2:18:34] weapon to where he could sit back

[2:23:07] go through amen
[2:23:08] there is nothing that the devil or god
[2:23:11] would allow the devil to put on you
[2:23:13] amen that's going to be greater than
[2:23:15] what you're going to enjoy over there
[2:23:19] amen glory
[2:23:24] and after reading the terrible
[2:23:25] afflictions which you know apostle paul
[2:23:27] actually endured
[2:23:29] amen it may seem hard to for us to even
[2:23:32] understand how he could even say
[2:23:34] or speak of them as light afflictions
[2:23:38] mine let me tell you something in one
[2:23:42] sense
[2:23:43] they were not at all light amen
[2:23:47] they were bitter and cruel that the more
[2:23:50] he suffered amen
[2:23:51] the more amen the grace of god
[2:23:55] hallelujah was made available for others
[2:24:00] amen and we should think the same way
[2:24:04] glory to god the more people who were
[2:24:07] saved
[2:24:07] the more thanksgiving ascended to god
[2:24:10] amen
[2:24:11] hallelujah i mean many would like to win
[2:24:14] the soul of your neighbor your co-worker
[2:24:16] your friends your family amen just to
[2:24:18] know
[2:24:19] that more thanksgiving is going to
[2:24:20] ascend to god
[2:24:24] regardless where they're at in the city
[2:24:28] amen hallelujah
[2:24:31] and the more thanksgiving ascended to
[2:24:33] god the more
[2:24:34] god was glorified
[2:24:37] amen hallelujah let's glorify him amen
[2:24:42] look the afflictions viewed by
[2:24:43] themselves might be ever
[2:24:45] so heavy amen but when compared
[2:24:49] amen with the eternal weight of glory
[2:24:52] that lies ahead
[2:24:53] then yes you can say it's light
[2:24:58] if that's all you're looking to is the
[2:25:00] very inheritance that you're
[2:25:02] receiving then whatever's going on here
[2:25:04] you can say
[2:25:06] it's light it's only for a while
[2:25:10] dispute shall pass amen glory to god
[2:25:14] hallelujah also the light affliction is
[2:25:17] but what for a moment
[2:25:18] whereas glory is what eternal
[2:25:23] i hallelujah what i'm going to enjoy
[2:25:26] over there brothers and sisters
[2:25:28] it's for eternity what i
[2:25:32] suffer down here with it's just for a
[2:25:34] moment
[2:25:36] hallelujah glory to god you know
[2:25:39] and in second corinthians chapter 4
[2:25:41] verse 18 it says while we look not at
[2:25:43] the things which are seen
[2:25:45] but at the things amen which are not
[2:25:48] seen
[2:25:49] for the things which are seen are
[2:25:51] temporal but the things which are not
[2:25:53] seen are eternal amen to be able to see
[2:25:58] the first we're talking about in here in
[2:26:00] this verse
[2:26:01] this verse the very first thing that's
[2:26:02] talking about is what
[2:26:04] is sight it's your natural sight amen
[2:26:08] but paul brings something else in here
[2:26:10] that has to do what
[2:26:12] the insight there's an insight
[2:26:15] amen glory to god and as we go back to
[2:26:17] that blind man
[2:26:19] amen that jesus healed he didn't just
[2:26:22] you know after he could really see
[2:26:25] naturally
[2:26:26] he didn't pursue to search out the world
[2:26:30] because now he could see naturally he
[2:26:34] could see
[2:26:34] amen this is a man that was born blind
[2:26:37] but he didn't run there
[2:26:39] and here to go pursue because he wanted
[2:26:41] to walk
[2:26:42] know the whole world
[2:26:46] you know what he never even left this
[2:26:47] town
[2:26:52] but something within him there was faith
[2:26:56] amen and then all of a sudden it was the
[2:26:59] insight that was really you know
[2:27:01] because here you know what his neighbors
[2:27:03] wasn't even sure is this the man
[2:27:05] was this the man that was laid out they
[2:27:07] couldn't even recognize him or
[2:27:09] then how is it that now he could see
[2:27:12] when they could just praise god
[2:27:14] and said wow this man is healed praise
[2:27:16] the lord
[2:27:17] nope that was the neighbors
[2:27:22] amen but then when the mom and dad
[2:27:26] was questioned what did they say oh yeah
[2:27:29] this is our sound
[2:27:30] yes we know we cared for him you know
[2:27:33] from birth till now
[2:27:34] we're the ones that laid him out there
[2:27:36] and said him you know
[2:27:37] and yeah we can't deny this is our son
[2:27:42] but about him receiving his sight you
[2:27:45] know what they said
[2:27:46] he's of age ask him
[2:27:52] when they could have just like we don't
[2:27:54] know but we thank the lord
[2:27:56] praise god there was a day he was blind
[2:27:58] and now he can see
[2:28:01] no he's a beach
[2:28:04] ask him amen
[2:28:08] but look this blind man that could see
[2:28:11] now
[2:28:12] naturally and he didn't run here and he
[2:28:14] says i want to go to the next town i
[2:28:16] want to see what it looks like
[2:28:17] i want to go to the ocean i want to see
[2:28:19] what it looks like he didn't spend his
[2:28:21] time
[2:28:21] pursuing trying to do the research
[2:28:23] because now he could physically see
[2:28:27] but something inside of him it was the
[2:28:30] inside that was one that you know
[2:28:32] and then the more they route him up
[2:28:34] first they were calling
[2:28:36] the man jesus prophet that's what he was
[2:28:38] calling him right
[2:28:40] he had an insight that he could see him
[2:28:42] as a
[2:28:43] prophet amen
[2:28:46] and the more they rowed him amen the
[2:28:49] more they just
[2:28:50] bugged him and bugged him even to the
[2:28:51] time they said why don't you just
[2:28:53] give god praise
[2:28:57] because he's the one that really you
[2:28:58] know opened your eyes not that man
[2:29:03] i mean if you know the story you know
[2:29:04] what i'm talking about
[2:29:06] amen but then all of a sudden the more
[2:29:09] the man
[2:29:10] was riled the more the inside the more
[2:29:12] the faith see
[2:29:14] was working it was the inside from
[2:29:17] prophet
[2:29:18] then he went to what son of god
[2:29:22] all right now that's faith there
[2:29:25] from prophet amen to just probably a
[2:29:29] natural man
[2:29:30] when he was blind he knew somebody spoke
[2:29:32] to him
[2:29:34] he knew a man stepped up and spoke to
[2:29:37] him
[2:29:37] and put something in his eye and told
[2:29:39] him to go wash
[2:29:41] then when he opened his eyes he probably
[2:29:43] looked back to see who was
[2:29:44] and even if jesus was still standing
[2:29:46] there he would have never knew who it
[2:29:48] was
[2:29:51] amen but his faith
[2:29:55] because where there's true faith there
[2:29:57] is confession
[2:29:59] and at first he confessed by his insight
[2:30:02] that he was a prophet and the more he
[2:30:05] the more he was working brother bob amen
[2:30:07] then he began to the inside began to
[2:30:09] confess
[2:30:10] that he was the son of god
[2:30:15] and when they had enough of him because
[2:30:17] you know now he begin to get bold
[2:30:23] amen
[2:30:28] so here
[2:30:32] who are you to tell us these things
[2:30:36] we have the word we have moses yeah
[2:30:43] who are you where you were just just now
[2:30:46] beginning a scene and you
[2:30:48] can tell us these things and talk to us
[2:30:50] like that
[2:30:53] yeah let me tell you his insight was
[2:30:58] it was growing amen he wasn't worried
[2:31:01] about the rest of the world and what he
[2:31:02] could see out there but he knew amen
[2:31:04] he knew he said there was a time i was
[2:31:06] blind and i can't
[2:31:08] now i can see that's all i can tell you
[2:31:10] that was his testimony and it was
[2:31:12] constantly that every time they asked it
[2:31:14] i told you over and over again
[2:31:19] amen and he he began to tell him he said
[2:31:22] you're asking me all this like as if
[2:31:24] you're trying to learn something
[2:31:25] so are you trying to be his disciples
[2:31:29] are you trying to be a disciple a
[2:31:32] disciple means a learner
[2:31:35] well they didn't like that i mean they
[2:31:38] blamed him for being a disciple
[2:31:39] a follower of jesus
[2:31:43] and they say don't you know that man is
[2:31:44] a criminal he's evil
[2:31:47] he's breaking the law which he did it on
[2:31:49] the sabbath day
[2:31:52] but all he knows something supernatural
[2:31:55] happened
[2:31:57] and he wasn't trying to figure it out up
[2:31:59] here he wasn't trying to figure it out
[2:32:00] with his natural eyes
[2:32:02] he didn't go running to some school
[2:32:04] somewhere or some
[2:32:05] philosopher or some whatever that had
[2:32:08] thd or whatever it is i want to
[2:32:10] understand this
[2:32:12] no there was an insight growing there
[2:32:13] was just something bubbling from a
[2:32:15] prophet from
[2:32:16] a regular man to a prophet amen to thou
[2:32:18] son of god
[2:32:19] then when he was finally kicked out and
[2:32:21] jesus heard of this
[2:32:22] what did jesus do the bible says jesus
[2:32:25] just went to go
[2:32:29] for it when he was kicked out that
[2:32:33] that man amen look something happened to
[2:32:36] him you would have thought he would have
[2:32:37] been
[2:32:38] going around and says uh i heard of a
[2:32:40] man the pharisees they called him jesus
[2:32:42] they
[2:32:43] all of this all where is this man
[2:32:44] where's you know there's no scriptures
[2:32:46] where he looks for him
[2:32:48] but when he got kicked out the bible
[2:32:50] says jesus went
[2:32:52] and looked for him amen let me tell you
[2:32:55] something you belong to him
[2:32:57] amen he's going to go after you
[2:33:01] amen glory but when jesus you know he
[2:33:04] didn't introduce to him jesus
[2:33:06] didn't say i was the one that did all
[2:33:08] this hello you know
[2:33:10] i'm introducing my how are you doing i'm
[2:33:12] jesus you know and
[2:33:14] i i spat on the ground and did this the
[2:33:16] first thing he said he says do you
[2:33:18] believe in the son of god
[2:33:21] he didn't even say do you believe i am
[2:33:26] right when he approached him he didn't
[2:33:27] say do you believe
[2:33:29] i am the son of god he just asked a man
[2:33:32] because as god already knew there was an
[2:33:35] insight in him that was growing
[2:33:37] he professed that he was what a prophet
[2:33:39] to a son of god
[2:33:40] then he go and says do you believe
[2:33:43] in the son of god and he says i don't
[2:33:46] even know who he is and all that and he
[2:33:48] says
[2:33:49] i am him then he could say i am him
[2:33:55] he made sure that the man could make a
[2:33:56] confession
[2:33:59] but he confessed right didn't he he says
[2:34:02] i don't know who he is where is he
[2:34:06] amen and when jesus said
[2:34:10] i am he my
[2:34:13] glory you know sometimes god
[2:34:16] has a way of revealing himself amen
[2:34:20] but you know when jesus did that
[2:34:24] the man was not far away from the
[2:34:26] pharisees
[2:34:27] when you read the end of the the
[2:34:29] scripture the chapter
[2:34:31] that they were both standing in the
[2:34:33] midst of the pharisees and the scribes
[2:34:36] they heard their conversation
[2:34:39] they heard jesus standing there asking
[2:34:42] him do you believe in the son of god
[2:34:45] and then jesus there tells him
[2:34:50] i'm the son of god
[2:34:54] so you know what they did they went up
[2:34:57] to jesus and said are you saying we're
[2:34:58] blind
[2:35:02] amen it says are you saying that we're
[2:35:05] blind
[2:35:08] amen and you know what jesus he was
[2:35:10] giving them an opportunity
[2:35:13] jesus said if you can confess
[2:35:16] that you are blind then you have hope
[2:35:20] but because you say you can see
[2:35:26] amen because that was their attitude
[2:35:29] they they knew it all they see it all
[2:35:33] i am this i'm that amen we're the ones
[2:35:35] that holds the the scrolls and
[2:35:37] you know they they've reached a place of
[2:35:39] no compassion for the people
[2:35:41] look they were not presenting gospel
[2:35:44] they were presenting law
[2:35:48] and then they had their thumbs on the uh
[2:35:49] you know on the people
[2:35:51] the do's and the don'ts and the and you
[2:35:54] know a lot of their laws brother was
[2:35:56] oral laws amen you know some of the laws
[2:36:00] that actually
[2:36:01] end up over there was because of oral
[2:36:05] laws because of way back in the past
[2:36:08] where they had word laws and because
[2:36:11] grandpappy had it like this word role
[2:36:14] and then when the next generation come
[2:36:16] they kind of twisted it amen next
[2:36:18] generation come
[2:36:19] it's a little bit different and then
[2:36:21] finally it comes to that day
[2:36:22] and all it all became oral law
[2:36:26] they wasn't even word law anymore
[2:36:29] that's happening today or a law
[2:36:34] amen and we need to go back to original
[2:36:38] word law
[2:36:41] amen glory to god but that's what they
[2:36:43] said you know are you saying we're blind
[2:36:46] amen because they thought they were
[2:36:50] really somebody amen
[2:36:53] i like that when jesus said you know
[2:36:55] well if you confess that you are blind
[2:36:58] then you have hope
[2:37:02] amen but he said because you say you can
[2:37:05] see
[2:37:07] amen glory but here's a man that was
[2:37:11] could not even see for all those years
[2:37:14] and now he can
[2:37:15] but he didn't pursue the natural sight
[2:37:17] amen
[2:37:19] look brothers and sisters i can see
[2:37:21] today amen
[2:37:23] even though i still got to use this amen
[2:37:25] but i can see
[2:37:26] one day this will not be here anymore
[2:37:29] praise the lord amen but i'm glad
[2:37:33] that i had an insight there's a spark
[2:37:35] there amen
[2:37:37] glory to god hallelujah like the eagle
[2:37:40] and the chicken barn amen
[2:37:41] when he heard that cry amen that's me
[2:37:44] glory
[2:37:44] that's where i belong hallelujah
[2:37:49] glory amen you know just to close
[2:37:54] in verse seven now it says that the
[2:37:55] trial of your faith there in
[2:37:57] uh first peter chapter 1 verse 7 that
[2:37:59] the trial of your faith being much more
[2:38:02] precious than
[2:38:02] of gold amen amen that perisheth through
[2:38:06] he says though it be tried with fire
[2:38:09] might be found unto praise and honor
[2:38:11] amen in glory
[2:38:12] at the appearing of jesus christ true
[2:38:15] faith amen
[2:38:16] is indestructible i believe that
[2:38:20] amen if you have true faith amen glory
[2:38:22] to god there's
[2:38:23] nothing the devil could ever interfere
[2:38:27] with that amen
[2:38:28] hallelujah look the believer may undergo
[2:38:31] severe tests and trials
[2:38:33] amen but instead of destroying his faith
[2:38:36] they become what
[2:38:37] food amen
[2:38:40] the faith to feed on glory to god look
[2:38:43] at job there amen
[2:38:44] job says you know though he slayed me
[2:38:47] yet
[2:38:48] will i trust in him amen but he says
[2:38:51] but i will maintain my own ways before
[2:38:54] him
[2:38:54] job probably you know here sustained
[2:38:57] amen
[2:38:58] heavier losses amen in one day
[2:39:03] than any other man amen in history
[2:39:08] but he could stand there and say
[2:39:12] yet amen though he slay me
[2:39:17] oh glory to god yet
[2:39:20] amen will i trust in him glory to god
[2:39:24] look at the three hebrew children what
[2:39:26] were they
[2:39:27] what were they tested by real fire
[2:39:32] amen glory to god and they were
[2:39:34] victorious amen
[2:39:36] and there was a fourth man to keep him
[2:39:37] company in there
[2:39:39] amen and what a company to have
[2:39:43] they had someone there that was likened
[2:39:45] to what
[2:39:46] son of god hallelujah amen
[2:39:50] glory to god what an inheritance amen
[2:39:53] verse 8 it says whom having not seen ye
[2:39:56] loved in whom
[2:39:57] though now ye ye see him not yet
[2:39:59] believing
[2:40:00] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable
[2:40:04] and full of glory amen hallelujah you
[2:40:07] know peter now discusses what the
[2:40:08] present enjoyment
[2:40:10] of our salvation christ taken by faith
[2:40:13] amen how many is enjoying our salvation
[2:40:17] amen and i know there was a time a man
[2:40:19] you know david wasn't
[2:40:21] lost or anything like that but he lost
[2:40:23] the joy of the salvation and he said
[2:40:25] lord restore
[2:40:26] there is something about that salvation
[2:40:28] amen
[2:40:30] why because it was part of that
[2:40:31] inheritance let me enjoy that amen
[2:40:34] hallelujah you know there was a i was
[2:40:37] is it okay to read quote close it out
[2:40:40] amen
[2:40:41] you know i've i've preached before i'm
[2:40:43] not saying that's the way it is here but
[2:40:44] i have like brother you did really full
[2:40:47] you didn't fully preach the message i
[2:40:48] said what do you mean because well you
[2:40:50] didn't even read one quote
[2:40:52] amen but you know hallelujah
[2:40:55] amen let me just share something with
[2:40:57] you here in the in the
[2:40:58] in the revelations the chapter 5 1961
[2:41:02] brother branham says
[2:41:03] if you've got an inheritance here in
[2:41:05] this world friend
[2:41:07] he says it's a corruptable inheritance
[2:41:12] amen but we receive an inheritance that
[2:41:14] fadeth not away
[2:41:16] he says the prodigal son went away amen
[2:41:19] and left his inheritance and he took
[2:41:22] part
[2:41:22] he took part of it with him when he
[2:41:25] returned back
[2:41:26] his inheritance was defiled
[2:41:30] by the ground somebody's natural
[2:41:31] inheritance
[2:41:33] but when he talks about us but he says
[2:41:35] but if you've
[2:41:37] run away from yours it's not so
[2:41:41] amen with the kingdom of god we receive
[2:41:44] an incorruptible inheritance amen
[2:41:48] hallelujah but we have an incorruptible
[2:41:50] inheritance
[2:41:51] that is salvation redemption and go back
[2:41:54] to the garden even again
[2:41:55] think of it lord who wouldn't want to go
[2:41:58] back
[2:41:58] like adam and eve amen and live back
[2:42:01] there
[2:42:02] amen he says our food provided
[2:42:06] each day that's because god was
[2:42:08] responsible
[2:42:10] for adam and eve's protection provision
[2:42:13] and even entertainment whatever it is
[2:42:16] that entertain them
[2:42:17] god was responsible for that
[2:42:20] you know how the world got their
[2:42:22] provision and entertainment and security
[2:42:25] and all of that from kane
[2:42:28] go all the way back to genesis it was
[2:42:30] his sons
[2:42:32] amen hallelujah
[2:42:36] they're the ones and but the thing is
[2:42:38] the very things that cain
[2:42:40] and his sons brought to the world and to
[2:42:43] them it was good enough
[2:42:44] and that's why they could say we don't
[2:42:46] need you no more lord look cain was
[2:42:48] kicked out
[2:42:49] kicked out even he knew that was going
[2:42:52] to be a hard thing for him why because
[2:42:54] he enjoyed the ground
[2:42:55] you know what his curse was that the
[2:42:58] ground would not
[2:42:59] yield no seed
[2:43:03] is that what his curse was what did he
[2:43:05] enjoy the most
[2:43:07] the ground that's why he offered the
[2:43:09] fruits of the ground
[2:43:10] to onto his sacrifice that's what he
[2:43:14] loved to do
[2:43:15] and when god took it away and he said if
[2:43:17] you plant another seed into that ground
[2:43:20] it will not grow it will not yield
[2:43:22] [Music]
[2:43:23] hey man that was his curse and he said
[2:43:25] he said now that's a hard thing
[2:43:30] that was something he enjoyed amen glory
[2:43:33] to god so they
[2:43:34] don't don't think of it strange when
[2:43:36] there's something
[2:43:37] you're enjoying out there and you're
[2:43:39] getting away from the presence of god
[2:43:40] and god just like
[2:43:43] snatches it away from you it says you
[2:43:46] belong to me straighten up
[2:43:48] if that's hindering you then i'm taking
[2:43:50] it away
[2:43:53] amen so don't don't think of it you know
[2:43:56] but that's the very thing cain did enjoy
[2:43:59] god says
[2:43:59] this is what i'll do but look cain was
[2:44:02] given an opportunity too
[2:44:05] amen he was only lost because he chose
[2:44:08] that way
[2:44:09] but there he is he did survive then he
[2:44:11] had sons amen
[2:44:14] and then they brought in the cattle
[2:44:16] that's their provision
[2:44:18] amen they're you know their food and
[2:44:21] then he had a son that was
[2:44:22] that knew how to make tents and all of
[2:44:24] that and now they had a
[2:44:26] a roof over their heads and then when it
[2:44:28] came to their security
[2:44:29] he had another son that was good in the
[2:44:32] uh making things out of brass and iron
[2:44:34] and
[2:44:35] now they have boards spears and whatever
[2:44:37] it is and whatever else he made
[2:44:39] forks spoons plates
[2:44:43] and but that was what
[2:44:46] that was the negative thing outside
[2:44:50] of the positive it wasn't
[2:44:53] god's idea amen
[2:44:58] hallelujah but look we're going to go
[2:45:00] back
[2:45:01] rebrand talks about who wouldn't want to
[2:45:03] go back
[2:45:05] to that life where god walked with you
[2:45:08] in the cool of the day
[2:45:10] and fellowship with you amen
[2:45:14] hallelujah glory you know there's a
[2:45:18] scripture in the bible
[2:45:19] where he was talking about i pray for
[2:45:21] them
[2:45:22] but i don't pray for the world amen
[2:45:26] now the world was not people
[2:45:29] it was cosmos i pray

[2:45:34] jesus i'm praying for them for the
[2:45:36] people
[2:45:36] i'm not praying for the world that's the
[2:45:39] negative side
[2:45:42] amen that's outside the ideas of god
[2:45:45] god had an idea that cain's idea was
[2:45:48] outside
[2:45:50] of the ideas of god and it was negative
[2:45:56] amen glory look one day we will not need
[2:46:00] a job
[2:46:03] amen i won't have to come home from
[2:46:05] working hard and i need a bed to rest on

[2:46:48] says then i will heal
[2:46:50] their land but because that word says
[2:46:53] then
[2:46:54] that means above that something has to
[2:46:57] be done and then
[2:46:58] i will heal there oh so that means
[2:47:01] there's a responsibility that we got to
[2:47:03] do

[2:47:05] the ministers and the priests
