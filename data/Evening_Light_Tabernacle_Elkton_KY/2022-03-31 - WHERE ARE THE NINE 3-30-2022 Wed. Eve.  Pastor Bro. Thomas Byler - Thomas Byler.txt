amen the lord is good isn't he we greet you all in the name of the lord tonight good to be in the house of the lord amen we're just praying the lord will keep the tornadoes away and just give us some good gentle rain amen how many know god can move this shot uh he still can control the storms amen so i there's a big long line of them amen and so amen it's out there but it just seems to be west of us a little bit hopefully it'll stay there by god's grace amen let's pray kind heavenly father we come before you once again lord thank the lord jesus to be in your house assembled together with believers of like faith lord and bringing our likes of fire together lord jesus we just desire god that you'll speak to our hearts father this evening just come and speak to us along the way that we could go from here saying did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way father help me just to get up out of the way lord help me just to get up out of the way lord that you might use the gift father and bless each one that has come and those that couldn't lord we ask god your blessing upon them wherever they are and we do thank you father for all your blessings to us lord jesus and we just can't begin to think about all of them lord but we get in the name of jesus christ amen and amen do you want to remember continue to remember the weekend after easter is when we want to have our get-together we can after easter so just mark that down on your calendar if you would amen and let me know if you can make it amen that way i'll kind of an idea of who and who can and can't amen and we'll try to bring some fish back if not we're going to go down to sam's and buy somethings and buy us a bunch of fish but yeah we can always buy him if i can't catch himself amen praise the lord god bless you good to be in the house of lord how many is happy in the lord amen amen god is good ain't he amen he's really wonderful and i just really appreciate god and so amen um so tonight first for a little while maybe not just too long but let's turn our bibles to second timothy if you will ii timothy and i've had this thought on my heart for a couple of weeks i guess it's been that i've kind of just wanted to speak on it and i speak on this different times but i just feel to speak on it one more time amen amen because i believe it is necessary amen second timothy three verse one from one two we'll go to verse 5. this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful and unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors haiti high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away may god had his blessings to reading the word you can be seated tonight i want to focus on tonight i want to focus on appreciation or thankfulness amen thankfulness you know sometimes i believe brother brahm says you know sometimes when we pray you know we're always asking god will you go do this will you do that and we just kind of make god our errand boy how many knows god is so much more than an aaron boy amen amen and so we should come before him with thanksgiving and appreciation amen and when i think about the age in which we're living in ii timothy describes it pretty good along with revelations 3 of course where it talks about amen they say that they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and so we find these people that uh our lovers of pleasure and covetous and all of this you know and the rich they're increased with goods we find out that these people are actually quite miserable amen and not only quite miserable but they're unthankful amen people do not appreciate things amen amen and i believe that i believe it's jesus that said one time that he that he uh healed uh what was it 10 lepers right in luke 17 it says in one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan amen jesus answer said but were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine i thought about titling this tonight where's the nine i mean how many knows that you know how many everything every i mean everything that is god created god made and people are not thankful for what god has done not thankful for what god has made like one one percent here of these lepers that were cleansed only one came back and gave him thanks and praise you know i don't know about you but sometimes i feel like you know we ask him a lot god a lot and so forth but i think tonight be a good time just to go amen and go down through and what we one might call counting our blessings how many want to count your blessings and now we'll do something different tonight let's count our blessings name them one by one donna if you can see if we have that song maybe for later count your blessing see what god has done oh my praise be to god when you think about what god has done for us take a good look at what god has done in your life amen when you get getting looking at what god has done amen it'll make you thankful amen you know the bible says in second second thessalonians the fifth chapter and verse 18 it says in everything give thanks in everything how many know stonewall jackson when they ask how he does it he's because he's i never take a drink of water without thanking god for he was a thankful person he had a close relationship with god now i believe he's a character of the bride when we get to heaven how many is going to be glad how many is going to be thankful that you made it there oh my goodness you know i believe that it's going to be overwhelming amen because it talks about and they gave him thanks some praise and honor you know and there's thanks is one thing appreciated to more than just thanks but it turns into praise you know how many other people praise all kinds of things but we're to praise god not to think but praise him for it and then step up another step from there huh and go to worship in him and then and even deeper but into a worship singing songs and just praising and worshiping and thanking him and you watch god come inhabit that how many of these god inhabits the praise of his people amen so what let's talk about this generation for just a minute under ii timothy here perilous times to come because for one thing notice it says disobedient to parents now i do not look in this scripture and see the children at fault huh the children are not at fault because how many remembers brother branham said when it comes to juvenile delinquency what did he say no it's not it's parent delinquency he pointed it to parents delinquency because if a parent was what they were supposed to be that child would not be disobedient is why the child becomes disobedient they're after all the child you know it's terrible to think that children are smarter than their parents they know to outwit them they'll figure a way out around you if they possibly can they sure will they're smart little guys they sure are you know they they know how to push it from two to two and a half from two and a half to three and before they'll have you up to 20 before you do anything but mom but dad this and that right amen and so we look at it we find out that they're disobedient to parents and if they're disobedient to parents what will it end up where will they end up [Music] why do you think that our police are getting shot left and right just for pulling somebody over the disrespect that their parents they ain't got no respect for the government or authority amen listen to what brother bam says in the influence in chicago if he says if our american people are setting a pace today before our children smoking cigarettes and men drinking and all that they're doing huh back then that's all they were doing right they were just smoking the drinking party and all that what kind of people will we have in the next race that is to come or in the next generation rather that is to come it'll be a bunch of neurotics which i think the whole world is just about in that condition now and if this race or this generation rather is like this what will the next one produce then if there would be another why the whole human race if it keeps going the way it is will become extinct altogether because we're killing ourselves and setting examples for others wow you know extinct yeah they're pretty much shooting each other and killing each other isn't that right totally dysfunctional i i want to say this as a preacher as a person that was born in 1962 and and had to learn the hard way it was on my own at 16 years old had my own apartment had to go and had to go out there and work for it work hard make a living and do things huh you know and i'm thankful that i had somebody to teach me that i could learn i feel for the generation that isn't even taught right how you know how they can't function if you're not brought up right you're in for a lot of trouble and i believe how many believes that's why brother brown says the backbone of the nation is a mother motherhood is the backbone of the nation because the way that she teaches her children amen christ just identified in all ages 1964. he says i passed over california here the other day and i got a hold of a magazine or a paper read where homosexuals are increased 60 last in the last year it's pitiful see and it's just because women have thrown themselves away that's right and just on the street naked it's just a shame but the bible said they'd be that way and even men the way that they've changed and it's it is going to get worse and in another if the world would stand another 50 years now notice that isn't 64. so in 2014 that would have been 50 years we're eight years past that we're eight years past that okay if it it'll get worse if the world would stand another 50 years the whole world would be totally insane amen let me declare this out on youtube the whole world is completely insane completely insane ah we're putting in a supreme court justice that can't say that she knows what a woman is and she's a woman if a woman don't know whether she's a woman or not come on folks [Music] insanity yeah yeah you heard it from me insanity okay that's what that is hey man that's the truth that's it if you don't know what you are you have been twisted huh that's right now i know that's totally insane look at the insanity already look at where it is look how how it's changed amen how it's going and how it's getting worse let me ask you this all these young people it's sad it goes through their queen and everything they got nose ring earrings and looked like freaks what are they gonna teach their children so we are reached the 50-mile 50-year mark the total insanity and it can only get worse from here like i said a few years ago back they said well don't ask don't tell under clinton policy now here's just this last time there was somebody boot and tag or whatever in their boot and egg or whatever his name was complete homosexual and i'm not sure i think he was the wife and her husband was the hymn back home i'm not sure he was and she him doesn't know what kim is either i was just a bit worried he's going to get the nomination we're going to have a homosexual president i mean it could easily happen that we'll have a homosexual president yeah yeah sure it's already gotten about as bad as it could but it can still get a little worse sad isn't it but that's where we're at insanity how does this fit into thankfulness be thankful you got your right mind i'll be glad that you got your right mind no matter how much they are eaters of those derivatives they talk oh my so so just to put it out there folks i want you to know this generation world that we're living in you are living in a insane asylum and it's worldwide not just america england was insane a long time ago folks that's right and it's washed over into america amen now it's gotten so bad but aren't we thankful tonight by god's grace it's only god's grace that i don't have a daughter in my ear my nose does not it's only god's grace i don't have blue hair huh it's only god's grace i don't have to put another tattoo on me to oh wow it's not neat no that's not me okay nothing cool about it i am so thankful that we can be satisfied that we can have peace in our heart that we can have joy in our heart i'm so glad how many glad let us be glad and reach out on the night because i'll tell you right now if you oh my when i think of help oh let's just start with number one let's let's start off with that with number one the first thing that we want to count our blessings and that is yes that you believe i believe that our names were written down that god chose you choosing you before the foundation of the world or you wouldn't be here you would look just like all the rest of you as losses to rest can i just say what comes to mind because i believe that if you're god's child i don't care how blue your hair is i don't come any nose rings you have i don't care how many tattoos you have you will come to god if you are god's child he says they will come to me and i will lose the never so i don't know where that last one is that's maybe what they look like i don't know but if you're god's child there'll be something that pulls you you will hear that voice amen they will come praise be to god that's that's the greatest how many leaves that's one of the greatest things that you can be thankful for behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the children of god to be a child of god is the greatest honor that you'll ever have i don't care if you would be a trump and a billionaire it ain't nothing compared to being a child of god amen that experience you wouldn't sell it for nothing you wouldn't give it and trade it for nothing that experience of god coming down and letting you know who you are where you come from where you going because them folks that don't know who they are they don't know where to go well i should take that last part back there's probably something in their mind tells them where they're going to know that they want to meet him you're giving so praise be to god i thought about that i think thank you for choosing me now the calling part is a little trick romans 8 and verse 28 says he says for whom he did for no then he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also called i believe with jesus after talking about getting that one guy that didn't have the robe cast out he says many are called huh many are called but few are chosen but even though there's many calls that are the same as the unchosen but thank god that god has not just chose you but he called you that's why we can sing i never shall forget the day when jesus rolled all my sin away amen and when he come and he touched you and changed you forever never forget the day when he called when that calling was there thank god for that drawing amen but notice he called he chose it was his choosing but more so think about it we think about the natural birth well thank you we know that natural birth is a miracle you see life's a miracle it's a miracle how birth comes but i thank god i want to say tonight i thank god much more for my second verse because jesus said about jude yes he said the sun man son of man goeth as it is nothing but unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed for it had been good for that man if he had not been born notice that if he has called you defy now how many is glad for justification people will crawl on stones and rocks and they'll put themselves and do all kinds of things to try to make themselves feel a little better maybe do something to pay for their sins or whatever it is folks you could kill yourself and it wouldn't do absolutely zero for helping you you beat yourself to death it wouldn't do any good your blood ain't no good he already paid the price in other words jesus would even be disappointed because of your horrible unbelief in what he did good for you but he justifies that that means he picks you up clean you will he forget you and you don't have to be like the world and worry about judgment because you already know that that is size though you never ever did it in the first place oh my yeah that may be basic to people but it's not basic to me when i've been there ten thousand years bright shining is this outside how many beliefs you're gonna outshine the sun sun may be only six thousand ten thousand years i don't know how long it's been but it can burn out there's no sun there not us way down in some you're not gonna be like this generation of unthankful people huh ungrateful people we're still gonna that's now i see amen see what god has done let's talk about number two number two is for me with his speech no matter how much you get justified no matter how much you get sanctified you need a feeling go ahead look at that gauge how
