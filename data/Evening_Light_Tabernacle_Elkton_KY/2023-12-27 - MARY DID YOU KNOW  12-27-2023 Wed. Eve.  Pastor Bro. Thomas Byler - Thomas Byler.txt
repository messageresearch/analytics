his grace with his grace amen we're just so grateful to hear the good news good report amen of sister mild and how she's doing amen and so if anybody wants to go see her just check with brother amen David before going but amen we seen yesterday she uh thanked everybody amen for I might just tell this honor I said we come to see you you're looking good and she says if I looked in the mirror I don't think so what she said I said you're beautiful you're looking good oh my she said something about looking in the mirror again you know buten we tried to encourage her amen praise the Lord and so she uh amen praise the Lord I know when I first went to seen her and somebody had texted me on the way there said she's got little to no hope amen and I went down I come from down from the elevator and told David and them I says if she's going to die they going to have to kill her amen you know hospitals will do that sometimes so but anyway uh because I don't know you know it's just my feeling but amen by God's grace we're thankful that the Lord spared her amen we know that if uh it was her time all the prayers in the world wouldn't change anything amen God would take her home but we're believing God that uh she it's not quite her time yet and we're thankful for it and God will raise her up and give her a good healthy life yet amen amen not be so limited and so forth but amen except for maybe her driving amen she's going to have to take that up with her children and I'm sure there's gonna fight there because she's got a lot of fight amen man so we appreciate sister M and we just thank God Amen for the miracle that he's doing amen it's certainly a miracle because doctors anything more done for her amen so somebody come up here better Stephen get this man we'll put new batteries in it and switch it out it may not even be the batteries but amen we'll do it anyway remember North Carina come back I know there's certainly some things going around amen that we don't wantful for his grace and for his Mercy amen and tonight amen we want to speak uh one more one more Christmas message would that be okay amen amen one more Christmas message with the help of the Lord amen I think Sunday morning amen I think uh um amen we got our inspiration to kind of speak on this amen I think sister anab Bell sang that song Mary Did You Know Mary Did You Know amen I got to thinking about all that Mary needed to know amen turn the other one off what is it check test test test check it test test test I'm I'm getting some here y'all hear it test I'm green well it's green all right we're good and loud now amen and also we got some of that back so we thank Micah for getting that fixed I have not called them people about our fiber so tomorrow I'm calling the people about our fiber and we want to try to I'm going to move this this away okay amen uh so that we can try to get fiber in here and then amen we get some good cameras rolling on here amen and see if we can't uh amen get together with some of some of them I know that brother Tommy had taken some pictures from up there amen did some video from up there so we're going to think about going up top because it's certainly gives a better view on the internet from back there and then they maybe have to just draw it in while the is preaching or something but it certainly look good but it'll be an option something that we look amen look to doing one more thing before we read the word and change the order service is um everybody needs to give me input Amen on our winter months I talked to Brother Steve about it with but for those who are working it may be a little hard but if you want to start service at 6:30 during new winter month let me know amen and if we have enough and there's not anybody can say well I can't make that you know maybe we'll keep it like that but if you can make it by 6:30 that way we'd be out by 8:00 amen and so of course we know it's a dark by five so uh you know if you want to do that we will change the winter month I know the summer month amen we'll probably switch back but maybe we can have maybe we could do something like that amen I be okay with me amen but we want to think about those working and having jobs and stuff too so but I do need your input so please each family say yay or nay of whether that would work for you and we'll go from there would that be okay amen amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord once again grateful thankful Lord Jesus father for Christmas Lord Jesus we just ask God that as you've I feel like you've laid one more message on my heart to go in that direction for now of course we speak about Christmas we speak about your coming and what it all means to us Lord all you year long but father just kind of in the direction of a song that was wrote and what it meant and so forth and kind of feeling inspired to go a little further on it we ask God you'll just help us now Lord as we open your word father and Lord and look at it once again that your Holy Spirit would Quicken it to us father and that we go from here a better people than what we've come Lord thank you Lord for sister mild and for what you're doing for her Lord and we pray for the family each one Lord in a special way also I can Lord not feeling the best we ask Lord for quick healing and quick raising up for them Lord thank you for each one that has come for those that are streaming Lord we ask God that you would help the sound to be clear and that Lord they receive something from you also we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word and upon the service now in Jesus name amen amen Mary did you know that's kind of a different title isn't it amen praise the Lord amen so we'll read and I think we'll go to um all the way over to let me see where we're at the crucifixion that is found in St Luke St Luke 23 amen St Luke 1023 and I didn't even really take the time to look up that song and some of the things but we know that he talked about him walking on the water and the different things that that uh amen verse 26 of chapter 23 of St Luke here we go backwards again and as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a serian coming out of the country and on him they laid a cross that he might bear it after Jesus and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus turning unto them said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming into which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs and the that never bear and the PS which never gave suck and they shall begin to then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and on the Hills cover us and if they do the things in the Green Tree what shall be done in the drive amen may God ask you blessings to the reading of the word Amen brother Bram in from that time in 1961 says now en closing the devil said that's not the Son of God he couldn't stand and let that spit hang on his face and as many times as he's told these things and so forth and predicted things they smack him on the head with a re and would prove that he was the son of was the son of God he isn't the Son of God so in closing let's take a little trip a mental trip now listen close let's go back to Jerusalem 1500 years ago it was strange and odd morning never was a morning like that morning the sun come up but it looked very strange something was going on wrong along about 9:00 they were standing in a room and I could hear a mob screaming screaming saying way with him away with him I see a little woman right out run out in front of the mouth and say what has he done tell me what has he done he's only healed your sick and brought hopes to the Hopeless what's he done to deserve this who's she talking about amen and I look behind and I hear something bump bump bump and here's an old ruged cross coming down dragging down the street blood just out the old cross dragging his bloody Footprints out coming down the street spit spit over his face blood mixed uh and spit mixed together tears and Grim running together crowns of thorns pull over his precious head bump and bump the devil walking around saying now if he was the son of God he'd never put up with something like that after a while his little weak body fell late the cross on on Ethiopian him here goes up the hill look and I notice got a little white garment on but there's little red spots all over the white garment amen and what are they as he goes up the hill they get bigger and larger and larger big bloody Splash smacking up against his legs going to Calvary I see Satan say come on oh death we got him now come on I command you death said Satan I have your control you have I have your control you know sting him because he's nothing but a man he's just a man he wouldn't put up with that I can see the bees coming around circling him stinging The Sting of death amen Amen Let me uh read you kind of the quote that come to my mind amen that led me to this Amen brother bam says it this way and he was talking about Christ Christmas and how that it was converted from Pagan Pagan the juper or the son God birthday to the son of God's birthday he says now Christianity was accepted in the way in Rome and they said that we'll make the same celebration we'll make son of make it the son of God God's birthday the son got Jupiter's birthday then the son of God's birthday around the 25th of December amen butam says now what difference does it make see today even if they was doing it in July or August or whatever it might be it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us hope that we have that have that we the hope that we have in US amen and now you say well the rest of them got all got a Santa Claus and going on like they do why don't we might as well join in and do it no sir no this is not and I like this now remember this engrave this into your hard drive no this is not a say Pagan celebration to us amen how many believes that Christmas for the believer is not a pagan celebration amen but it is a sacred hour he says if there had been no Christmas there would be no Resurrection if there was no Christmas there'd be no love there'd be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for the believer if there if it hadn't been for Christmas praise the Lord how many glad that there's a Christmas I read in the news this week where colon cap Kaepernick whatever how do you spell his name the one that started kneeling for the national anthem and it's that he wants to cancel Christmas and all the giving of gifts huh but you know I got to thinking you know how many knows that Christmas is something that's world over amen and I'm here to tell you it's about it's supposed to be about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ people want to try to deny it but as long as they celebrate Christmas it still has to do and it still points them to a Son of God that was born very little boy amen praise the Lord amen I've got a few quotes here that I won't even really get into it but brother Benham many times and as you know brother benam taught that uh Jesus amen was not the son of Mary amen and even when he was in the cross he said woman he never said mother brother B he said he never called her mother he even says your mother is looking for you amen and what he say he says who is my mother but he that serves the Lord and so forth amen never called her mother because now we know brother Ben actually it was kind of a strong statement but he says that she was just the incubator now in the Bible many places he says mother mother of Jesus and so forth you know because naturally giving birth to him in that aspect it's important I believe that people understand that in that aspect it was his mother but as far as really being a part of her there was not one Speck so you know in that aspect she was not her mother Joseph was not because even when Mary and brother B says the the the uh the detail of the word correcting the air amen Jesus when the Mary come up to thy father and I you know or the mother and I we've been searching for you he never acknowledged that what they said was the truth is that right he says what who is my mother and so forth it was absolutely has to be be because if he' ever said mother hello if he'd ever called her mother huh think of what how that would have broke things brother in here talks about we're a mixed congregation and so forth but if the part of that it takes a man it takes genetics of the woman and it takes genetics of the man to actually make a baby isn't that right amen and if if if one side of it and even if it had been mother if it had been mother and it been the mother side there but says there would have been a sensation between God and Mary and God has no part of all that amen there's no kind of sensation whatsoever it was a gene amen it was created both parts were a spoken word creation of God in the womb of Mary Glory but you know Mary and I want you to understand this that and I want to go over perhaps a little bit try not to keep you past 10 10:30 okay but look at look at this of Mary do you know and it's about knowing who this really is amen and you know I want to say in every age people don't know who he is they don't know who who Jesus is amen amen Mary from what I understand the scripture says you know that this child that you're going to have he said he's going to save his people from their sins so Mary knew that hey this is the Messiah he's going to come and he's going to save our people from their sins is that right but just how perhaps that that was going to happen she didn't understand she didn't understand because brother bam said in one of the uh I believe it was in one of the ancient writings that they was said amen that Mary went along up there because I couldn't find it in the Bible but went up there and he said he made that statement like he says what has he done and I I read that scriptures where a multitude of women multitud company of people and women bewailed and lamented him they were following him no doubt demonstrate said you know what's he done but good what's he done this out the other H not but you made gentlemen out of the men I made real ladies out of prostitutes look at he just nothing done but why do you do this amen so we say Mary did you know maybe Mary did you know that your boy is going to walk on water Mary did you know that the age of 12 he's going to perhaps dispute with the scribes and Pharisees and you're going to wonder where he is and he's going to tell you don't you know I must be about my father's business how many know he was about his father's business and it wasn't construction it wasn't carpentry oh my brother brother brother Tommy can you imagine if they had take the genetic test back then if they had been able to take a genetic test what the doctor by the GL what would he have said wow huh these this genetics he had to say is not of this world it's not of this world why because it was genetics of God it was God's blood if they tested his blood it was God's blood it wasn't a me it wasn't Jewish blood it wasn't Gentile blood it was God's very own blood oh my but you know maybe Mary didn't really understand and no doubt but if this was true and Mary was following she didn't as a mother she didn't want him to die nothing but good that he done and here he's gone to the Cross but Mary don't you know this is what I come for amen Mary doubt when he heard oh my there's 5,000 people his church is Big the multitudes are following him Mary no doubt was proud that's my son that's my boy amen she was human huh your father and I calling calling him her son did you my son huh that's right think about it 5,000 oh my when he got the news that he took five Lo and five fishes and fed 5,000 woo his Fame is spreading all around how proud mom must have been you know I think about it like it today you know it had a big church but you know it's not about the size of your church not about the size of the group but it's what Christ is here for he's Bolding and he's shaping individuals into His Image getting them ready for heaven that's what he's really all about it's not about crowds and multitudes it's about the Lord amen my what if he wouldn't have come what if there be no Christmas there' be no salvation amen man Mary Don't You Know Mary following along saying what has he done Mary I want to say Mary Don't You Realize what's going to become of this that when he sheds his blood and when he dies he dies for the sins of the whole world oh my and they're going to get [Applause] forgiveness a lot of folks didn't understand I want to bring it to this day here at the end if I can Peter didn't understand they didn't understand what was was all about they thought maybe he was going to come and that he's going to restore the Kingdom of Israel back again at that time he's going to be the king huh you're going to drive the Romans out and all of this but it was contrary to what they thought they barely even knew who he was have I been with you this long and still you don't know me to his disciples show us the father he keep talking about the father show it to us and it'll satisfy us amen oh my it's important that you know who he is if Mary could have seen the scope and if Mary would have understood the scope of what he was going to do she just stepped back and said to God be the glory there's going to be Millions set free there's going to be Millions healed the power of the enemy is going to be broke this is what my boy come to the world for was to die he was to come to give his [Applause] life amen for his children amen Peter oh my peter in 16th chapter of Matthew in verse 21 says and from that time forth Jesus began to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and the scribed and be killed bad news they didn't want to hear that kind of stuff and he be raised again the third day and Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying far be it from thee Lord this shall not be done unto thee Peter did you know Peter didn't know no that this man needed to go and be crucified he wanted him to stay there amen this shall not be done unto the but he turned and said to Peter get the behind me Satan you know sometimes we can just say the wrong things can't we boy I hate when I say the wrong things don't you in some given situations when you just say the wrong things somebody want to slap you they'll rebuke you and I don't like that I always pray say the right things that's why when I was in front of sister mild what am I going to say and they come to me about brother bam how he says you know somebody's sick about tell them they look good and so forth encourage him amen I tell you what some people kind of seem to almost like the idea oh somebody GNA die a't that chance I don't want to hear that give me good news tell me something positive Christ all things are possible I don't care if you're laying there tub down your throat you look up here in sin you're beautiful you're looking good things going to be all right huh I many believe we got to say the right thing Peter said the wrong thing and he got a sharp rebuke I imagine he wanted to cover his face oh my Lord he just called me devil get the behind me sa thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men you're thinking about yourself how many know Jesus didn't think about himself he thought about you he thought about me Mary did you know that your baby boy would would bring joy unspeakable amen there would be millions and millions of people amen Heaven's going to thunder out the Praises of God because of this young man it's G to sound like thunder [Music] amen aren't you glad for that praise the Lord my when I think about it Peter did you know now Peter did understand something remember Peter said in not Peter said but Jesus said in the 16th chapter verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of ciceria Philippi he asked his disciples who do men say that the son of man oh who do you say I am amen man who do you say he yes he's Emmanuel he's God With Us he is almighty God he'll raise the dead he'll heal the sick he'll triumph over every evil every disease if the the disciples can't heal it the epileptic child if he can't heal it when Jesus comes he don't get stomped he don't fail that young man that devil had to go how many believe that's who he is how many believe that's who he is today amen amen that's right who do you say that I say am some say thou art John the Baptist Eli as others Jeremiah one of the prophets Jesus said unless you believe that I am he to describes the Pharisees you're going to die in your sins know what he said Pharisees didn't know who he [Music] was pilate didn't know who he was do you know who he is do you realize who this is amen no how be it he says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory amen which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory amen remember P asked that pilot asked him he says he said art thou the king of the Jews and he answered and said unto him thou sayest it and the chief priest accused him of many things but he answered nothing and pilot asked him again say and said answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against they but Jesus yet they answering nothing so so pilate marveled amen and another one of gospels if you remember he says don't you realize I've got power to release you he says boy you just don't know who you're talking to don't you realize oh my that you would have no power unless my father wouldn't have give it to you huh man who are you are you the king of the Jews he didn't know did he because if he know who Jesus really was if he had really know who he was they wouldn't have crucified him let me say again in this hour how many beli that Jesus is identified brother preached the message God is identified by his characteristics brother BR had to come right out and explain it to the people hey you know hi whatever he did and however he acted back then if he acts like this back here now and I understand that's Jesus you'll understand him by his actions by his charactertics that's right but the churches even though Jesus come and use brother brandham deser the thoughts and intent of the heart didn't he preach a message who do you say this is who is this this generation did not know who he was aren't you glad that your eyes are open to understand who Jesus is that he is a manifestation of the word of [Applause] God that he's oh my talk about following a star they followed his star to Jesus how about today how many knows amen it is the seventh angel the star in his right hand but in the days of the voice of the SU Angel when he shall begin to time the mystery of God should be finished what did they do what brother M say the churches did to Jesus in this hour crucified him the second time put him out didn't know who he was because he came in such Simplicity through a prophet of God with his totes and hints and his Kentucky land AG they still didn't see him the the very Disciples of his had a hard time understanding and seeing who he really was Peter believed that he was the son of God is that right but he sure didn't want him to Die the way he was going to die you can only imagine none of us really understand the disappointment in all of the disciples when they all left Jesus when he was coming captured is that right the all Almighty were in bitterness the whole thing so to speak fell apart it's sad is it thinking about Peter his right-hand man a't that right had the Revelation but yet Jesus said you're going to deny me three times no you're going to deny me Thrice before that grows three times he denied him Jesus was there by himself oh my Mary didn't you know that he was going to die a horrible death a death you didn't even want a death you didn't like not what you was expecting amen but what a glorious thing it was what a glorious thing it was when he raised Lazarus man did you know that even Lazarus after being dead four days huh he brought him from the dead wow how wonderful is that right walk on water feed 5,000 cleanse the lepers is that right heal the sick raise the dead but that wasn't his primary purpose didn't even but Braham say that healing is a minor healing is a minor it's the bait on the hook that catches the fish what God did a miracle for this person God did a miracle for that person brother Tom is supposed to attract people's attention wow sure but the objective is what that soul on in there salvation is a major how many beli the saving of your soul is a major not a minor the purpose is that we might see and know who he is amen aren't you glad you know God opened up your eyes to who he is they didn't want to go but Jesus said it's expedient it's necessary my disciples it's needful that I go away even he told pilot for this purpose have I come amen oh man can you imagine now no doubt but when he comes the second time brother Tommy he's going to come with all the legions of angels I don't know about you better Glenn but I'm looking for him to come in clouds of Glory call me stupid because I I believe Jesus came in this generation he's already come and manifested himself like never before and proved himself alive and real but that does not take away from the literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I hope in 2024 that we get to see those Clouds Of Glory he says they were looking up disciples in Acts and said they were looking in the heaven they was gazing in the heaven the angel said why are you standing gazing here he'd have to tell me twice why are you gazing cuz I would gaze till I couldn't gaze no more a sight like that to see him go into heaven I wouldn't turn my head would you I wouldn't be turning my head say well that ain't no but the point was but the way he they said as you have seen him go he will come again and we're going to meet him over there Mary did you know that if he dies and he purchas the ball all of these Saints one of these days amen there's going to be a resurrection but the B says man there's no Resurrection there's no going home there's no place over there if there's no Christmas aren't you glad he came if you don't go to the Cross if you dump High fight that great battle Mar did you know he would conquer every devil that comes in front of him in his lifetime but did you not know Mary that when you heard those cobblestone streets going bump bump bump bump bump bum he was over those cobblestones dragon that bump bloody seemed like an ordinary morning but yet a horrible horrible morning it seemed like people were going to die today people going to get stuck on a post hands driven Nails throw feet pierced through and hang there till they die a horrible death from what to understand it's a horrible death so it wasn't joyful it was a sorrowful thing was a sorrowful thing but it was going to be a lot of Joy it was going to bring a lot of Joy all of that sadness was going to bring joy amen it's going to bring happiness woo it's going to bring freedom it's going to break Chains It's going to spoil principalities and Powers his greatest battle wasn't raising life from the dead his greatest battle wasn't the epileptic child he was now facing his greatest battle but said the greatest battle was in The Garden of Gethsemane it was even hard for Jesus if it be possible at this pass pass from me nevertheless now I will but I'm going to do this and we're going to overcome this deviling the devil didn't even realize what was going on huh he didn't even know he says I'll get this guy he ain't the Messiah he ain't the Messiah I'm going kill him go ahead and kill him oh my did he s up a hornet nest did he ever take the Stinger get the stinger took out of him a't that right and it was hard it was hard for Jesus perhaps it was very hurtful very painful every stripe on his back until you could see his ribs spit in his face crowns of thorns false accused didn't say a word could have called how many Legions it was 72,000 Angels last calculation I did could have called 72,000 I think can you imagine that's a bunch of wings flying around he could have called him and changed the scene aren't you glad he didn't he didn't do it for you Zoe he was thinking about you he thinking about everyone that would want to accept him as their savior everyone this is quiet here but it ain't going to be so quiet when we meet in the sky folks when we have millions upon Millions Mary Did You Know for 2,000 years yet there's going to be millions and millions and millions of people that are going to rejoice and have happiness and joy because of your little baby boy there's going to be churches shouting people are going to run the they got to jump and scream and holler because they're free from the sin they know they've been set free just try to gasp it Mary try to understand that this is going to be the Lord of lords he's going to come King of Kings we're going to rule and reign with him all through eternity amen oh my it's important that you understand your day then Jesus said if you know your day if a lot and Sodom and gor know their day their visitation huh you can discern the face of the Skies he said but he can't Des earn the size of the time you don't know what's going on it's important that you know Mary it's important that you know Christian Believers it's important pilot you should have known the Centurion I won't go in there and read it all but the Centurion it says amen after the earthquake and the sun went down amen he gave up the ghost He says truly this was the son of God Centurion did you know yeah but it was a little bit too late you had done kill him amen Rich Young Ruler did you grasp did you really know who was in

gives his life it's G to have the power to wash away every sin to wash every stain it's a chemical it's the bleach that the sins get dropped into and they go into God's see of forgetfulness that no matter if you've been a murderer and a persecutor of the Church of God like Paul was he man you can have a wash clean amen aren't you glad for that tonight praise God for Christmas not no Pagan celebration but our son the Son of God coming into this world to save Sinners that he came the greatest gift ever given is what he put the spear up in his side pierced him isn't that right the blood come out devil didn't know devil didn't know what he was doing when he pierced him in his side amen didn't realize that he was assisting God in the Forgiveness of the world [Applause] W that's right Pharisees didn't know or they didn't never done it you blind didn't they realize who he was they maybe knew it mentally but they didn't know it down in the heart amen my isn't he good praise the Lord

this huh I don't think they're impatient I don't think they're fidgety I think they're perfectly content they're perfectly happy they could be there another 10,000 years and they'd still be perfectly wonderful satisfied huh cuz that's what heaven is perfect satisfaction don't mean to go down this road but I will for just a minute what about those that are lost the regions of the lost the under the

work is done amen I've bought their bought them back I've paid for their sins whosoever believe all you got to do is accept what he did oh man can I say oh world don't you know oh world don't you know that he died for the sins of the whole world if you could grasp and know that he died for you you can be saved but if if you don't believe you shall be damned amen just like he said to the Pharisees unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins or your unbelief that was this generation if you don't believe that was he you'll die in your unbelief because when he come and he does the very same thing he did when he was walking on the shores of Galilee ain't that right and they said oh well you're elb your fortune teller and everything else he says when the Holy Ghost comes and you call him a devil and so forth it won't be forgiven you in this world or the world to come how many knows he's come he's done the very same thing he identified himself he showed us who he is I am so glad even he preached a message on what shall I do with this Jesus called Christ I believe uh pilot said practically the same thing what do you want me to do with this Jesus come means everybody got to do something pilot don't you know that you can't just wash your hand in the little base and walk away free when he killed himself years ago years later isn't that right amen and in this pool or whatever every once in a while a red thing comes up is that right you can't just wash him off of your hands as Jan's Brothers I believe made a song and wrote a song God will either be in your heart or he'll be on your hands amen where do you want him I want him down here because everybody's got him on his hand their hands anybody that ever heard John 3:16 have got them on his hands what will you do with this baby boy amen not so much baby anymore he's a man now this man called Jesus amen battle fight die to self and then we have a hard time giving up things that we're supposed to give up when he died to living He gave up everything he died for you and for me least we can do is give up the things that he wants us to give up for him amen that's right give God to CHR greatest Christmas the only one that he really wants that's you Lord here I am amen amen fought and one give up the G died and he saw goes down to the regions of the lost that right they never thought he had him he's dead now ah he's dead now I got him huh but wasn't long so I don't know the kingdom that's down there and the throne he sits on huh the bars he has you can't just come in there huh Jesus come so to speak as about

depression they were in brother Tommy they just lost everything oh my it really is real there is a God and I am going to have to be judged and I am going to be damned what a terrible state that they sit in right now for the last 2,000 years I imagine this sermon that Jesus preached they're probably still thinking about it just think I wish I would have believed Noah I wish I have believed them the Rich Young Ruler I wish that have believed them all of these politicians and these crooked people and all those that don't accept them in this hour they'll wish they to believed someday yeah they wish they would but it'll be too late oh what can I jump on when you think about the fact that God allowed you to have the faith to believe now and accept him am man get Washed by the blood and know that you ain't got to worry about no judgment you ain't got to worry about no hell God's going to take you in in heaven my goodness it ought to be a loud place around here cuz it's sure going to be L
