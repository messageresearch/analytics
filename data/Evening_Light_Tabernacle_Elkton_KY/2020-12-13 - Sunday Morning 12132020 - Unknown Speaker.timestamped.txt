[12:36] um morning brothers and sisters
[12:39] beautiful day to be in house of god
[12:41] ask us all to stand please
[12:46] bow our heads lord we just thank you for
[12:49] giving us a place to come and worship
[12:51] you this morning
[12:52] lord and thank you for another day to
[12:54] giving us to
[12:55] tell you how much that we love you and
[12:56] appreciate you lord
[12:58] we pray that you'll bless everyone that
[13:00] is here with us this morning lord those
[13:02] who are out there on other medias of the
[13:03] lord we pray shall bless those who can't
[13:05] be with us here
[13:06] today lord whether it be through
[13:07] sickness and health or whether to be
[13:09] traveling lord you know all
[13:11] we pray to over us and keep us safe lord
[13:13] we we thank you for all the blessings
[13:15] that you give us throughout our lives
[13:17] lord
[13:18] we pray that you'll bring your spirit
[13:19] among us and wash among us this morning
[13:21] lord
[13:21] to bring your holy spirit with us and
[13:23] touch us this morning lord
[13:25] we pray that you'll be with our brother
[13:26] this morning lord as he brings us your
[13:28] word lord move him out of the way
[13:30] so he brings your words to us this
[13:32] morning lord we love you and thank you
[13:34] for all that you do for us lord and
[13:36] we ask for these things in jesus
[13:37] christ's name amen
[13:41] ask us to open our bibles to first john
[13:46] 4.
[13:51] read verses 1-13 the last one together
[13:55] it's first john 4.
[14:02] be loved believe not every spirit but
[14:05] try the spirits whether they are of god
[14:08] because many false prophets are going
[14:09] out into the world
[14:19] and every spirit that confesseth not
[14:21] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[14:24] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[14:26] antichrist wherever you have heard
[14:29] that it should come and even now already
[14:31] is in the world
[14:42] they are the world therefore they excuse
[14:45] me therefore they speak
[14:46] they of the world and the world heareth
[14:56] them
[15:00] be loved let us love one another for
[15:03] love is of god
[15:05] and everyone that loveth is born of god
[15:07] and knoweth god
[15:14] and this was manifested love of god
[15:16] toward us
[15:17] because that god sent his only begotten
[15:19] son into the world
[15:21] that we might live through him
[15:32] be loved if god so loved us we ought
[15:35] also to love one another
[15:46] last one together hereby know that we
[15:49] dwell in him and he and us because he
[15:53] hath given
[15:54] us his spirit brother david

[24:55] something in my heart and
[24:57] i took a little trip to nashville
[24:59] yesterday

[25:03] down the road and i told jan
[25:05] i said you know when you drive by
[25:07] yourself and i didn't know exactly where
[25:09] i was going so i was using my maps i
[25:11] said it's quiet and
[25:12] every once in a while they kept
[25:13] reassuring me because they'd rerouted me
[25:15] because of a wreck i was going the right
[25:17] direction
[25:18] i began to think of the goodness of the
[25:20] lord
[25:21] all that he had done for me i said lord
[25:26] you've been so good to me and you know
[25:29] a lot of times people think when you say
[25:31] the lord's been good well he's give you
[25:33] a lot of money no
[25:34] you know what he gave me he gave me
[25:37] everlasting life
[25:39] he loved me so much brother brad he
[25:40] thought of me
[25:42] before the foundation of the world
[25:45] me did i deserve it nope
[25:50] but you say are you glad oh yes i'm glad
[25:53] i'm very glad and i i just this song
[25:56] we're going to sing i'm going through
[25:58] and
[25:58] my wife i'll probably drive her crazy
[26:00] because
[26:01] i get in the rut when i hear certain
[26:04] songs that i like to hear i play them
[26:06] first thing in the morning last thing
[26:08] before i go to bed i have to have
[26:10] my favorite song i'm like a child with a
[26:12] safety blanket
[26:13] i hear that song and there's a song
[26:17] that we sang into the course every once
[26:18] in a while oh say but i'm glad but i'm
[26:20] glad

[55:04] the will of god but i

[55:14] however you're doing it may god bless
[55:16] you we're going to turn if you want to
[55:17] stand for the reading of god's word
[55:19] first kings this morning first kings
[55:22] chapter 21
[55:24] first kings chapter 21. i'll give you a
[55:27] minute get there
[55:40] it says it came to pass after these
[55:42] things that nabal the jezreelite
[55:44] had a vineyard which in jezreel hard by
[55:48] the palace of ahab
[55:49] king of samaria and they have spoken to
[55:52] nabal saying
[55:53] give me thy vineyard that i may have it
[55:57] for a garden of herbs because it is near
[55:59] unto my house
[56:01] and i will give thee for for it a better
[56:04] vineyard
[56:06] than it or if it seemed good to thee i
[56:09] will give thee the worth of it in money
[56:13] and nabal said unto ahab the lord forbid
[56:15] it
[56:16] be forbidden in it me that i shall
[56:19] give the inheritance of my fathers unto
[56:22] thee
[56:22] you may be seated may god has blessings
[56:24] to his word
[56:26] you know i was thinking about this the
[56:28] scripture last night i was in prayer and
[56:30] just praying through the night
[56:32] just studying through the night and i
[56:34] was thinking about
[56:36] how the scripture really stood out to me
[56:39] how nabal you got king
[56:41] king you got ahab king ahab and you got
[56:44] nabal
[56:45] and here here uh here king ahab saw
[56:48] something enabled that he had
[56:51] you know and i feel like that's that we
[56:53] face that today
[56:55] that the devil if you want to picture
[56:57] this that king
[56:58] ahab was like the devil and king and
[57:01] nabal was like
[57:02] like the son of god and i feel like
[57:05] sometimes that the devil tries to come
[57:07] to attack us
[57:08] with something that looks better that
[57:11] looks like
[57:12] hey i'll i'll i'll give you this so i'll
[57:14] i'll show you something better
[57:16] but he goes to him in verse two and he
[57:17] says neighbor saying give me that
[57:19] vineyard
[57:20] that i might have it for a gardener
[57:21] birds because it's nearer to my house
[57:23] and i will give thee for a better
[57:25] vineyard than it
[57:27] so if you had a better vineyard why
[57:28] would he want his vineyard
[57:30] now i believe that's what the devil does
[57:32] with us he he tries to give us
[57:34] a glimpse of our eye that something's
[57:36] better
[57:38] and these these people here leaving the
[57:39] message or leaving this
[57:41] the devil tries to show them there's a
[57:43] better glimpse but there's not
[57:45] there's only one thing with a vindicated
[57:47] message there's not another vindicated
[57:49] message in our hour
[57:51] i tell you i was traveling with my
[57:52] mother when i first came into the
[57:54] message and
[57:55] my mom and my dad and my mom came into
[57:58] the message
[57:58] i got saved and came you know started
[58:01] seeing everything in the message because
[58:02] her mom grew up in the
[58:03] around the message and she got saved
[58:05] about six years seven years before she
[58:07] passed away
[58:09] and we got in the car and when i saw the
[58:11] truth it was you know i started
[58:12] really seeing the truth and got sold out
[58:15] i saw a glimpse i mean i was in the
[58:17] baptist church
[58:18] but when i saw a glimpse of what jesus
[58:21] done for us
[58:22] in that day i started listening to
[58:24] joseph about religion and while we were
[58:25] on that nomination it started to become
[58:28] real to me
[58:29] it became personal to me and church i
[58:32] believe you got to get a personal walk
[58:33] with jesus christ this morning
[58:35] it's more than just living off your
[58:37] family or living up your dad's religion
[58:40] or
[58:40] what they believe it's it's a personal
[58:42] walk with jesus christ
[58:44] because he's going to attempt you this
[58:45] morning he's going to show you a better
[58:47] glimpse or
[58:48] try to sell you out to the world this
[58:50] morning like king ahab
[58:51] he came up to him and here he is he said
[58:53] hey i'll show you a better vineyard give
[58:55] me your vineyard
[58:56] why would you want his vineyard when
[58:57] he's got the best vineyard i'll tell you
[58:59] church we got a glorious message this
[59:01] morning
[59:01] that we don't need nothing else we got a
[59:04] message that came
[59:05] and revealed the word of god and has
[59:07] revealed the love letter to the
[59:09] bride this morning he's revealed the
[59:11] word of god to us
[59:13] that we should be in the word every day
[59:15] we should be listening these messages
[59:16] every day
[59:17] it should be doing something to you as a
[59:19] personal experience
[59:22] it's just not a glimpse but king ahab
[59:24] called a glimpse of what he had
[59:26] and i believe sometimes we get on this
[59:28] world and we're we're at our jobs or
[59:30] wherever we're at we started to catch a
[59:31] glimpse of something what somebody has
[59:34] but church we need to realize what we
[59:36] have in this day
[59:37] he said a messenger this day that opened
[59:40] the scriptures should
[59:41] open the seals and how blessed we are
[59:45] if you see this truth and the eyesight
[59:47] has been applied to your eyes this
[59:49] morning
[59:51] what a blessing well here he is and
[59:54] third
[59:54] in the verse three it says now i'm
[59:55] saying to heaven
[59:57] back up to verse two right there's the
[59:59] end he says i will give you the worst
[1:00:01] and money
[1:00:03] so then he goes over and says hey you
[1:00:05] got a better view let me give you my
[1:00:06] i'll give you yours
[1:00:07] and he said he says i'll give it to you
[1:00:09] the worth of money
[1:00:10] then satan do you like that sometimes
[1:00:12] when he says hey i'll give you this
[1:00:14] better
[1:00:14] or in your mind he'll he'll say hey i'll
[1:00:16] give it to you this i'll give you you
[1:00:18] can make more money here
[1:00:19] but what good does it do if you live up
[1:00:21] in the desert and you make
[1:00:23] half a million dollars there's no church
[1:00:24] to go to
[1:00:26] what good does it do holy does no good
[1:00:29] with it your soul it
[1:00:30] you know it says you know the more sun
[1:00:33] in the in more sunny end times
[1:00:35] we we we approach we come into the house
[1:00:38] god even more
[1:00:40] i tell you the word of god doesn't
[1:00:42] change we change
[1:00:44] and the problem is we got to be changing
[1:00:46] closer to jesus this morning
[1:00:49] we got to be sold out to jesus christ
[1:00:51] this morning
[1:00:53] i'll tell you what a blessing is to have
[1:00:56] a have a have this vindicated message
[1:00:59] the devil will tell you you know come in
[1:01:01] the church come as you are and leave as
[1:01:03] you are
[1:01:04] but i'm telling you to tell you you
[1:01:06] could come as you are this morning and
[1:01:07] leave different this morning
[1:01:09] you can leave hill this morning you come
[1:01:11] in with depression you can leave that
[1:01:13] leave it here this morning and leave
[1:01:14] without it this morning
[1:01:16] i tell you i'm thankful to live in
[1:01:18] america i tell you i've served in the
[1:01:21] military for eight years
[1:01:22] i'm thankful to live in america i feel
[1:01:24] like all our rights are going down the
[1:01:25] tubes
[1:01:26] but i tell you i'm so glad i still live
[1:01:28] in america
[1:01:29] i'm so glad that i could live where our
[1:01:31] forefathers abraham lincoln is what they
[1:01:34] set up
[1:01:34] a constitution everything else after
[1:01:36] what they build america
[1:01:38] on because you'll learn in other other
[1:01:40] countries
[1:01:41] they're being for a message book they're
[1:01:43] carrying message books around
[1:01:45] and they're being their message or the
[1:01:47] bible and they're being locked up
[1:01:50] no i believe it's it's a squeeze time
[1:01:52] coming on
[1:01:54] but we need to be thankful for what we
[1:01:56] have still had the freedom we have to
[1:01:58] come to church
[1:01:58] when the door is open come to church
[1:02:01] support the pastor support the ministry
[1:02:04] but we've got to be sold out and it
[1:02:06] takes a sold-out dedication to realize
[1:02:08] what we have in this day
[1:02:10] that we don't take the message for
[1:02:12] granted that we don't take the word of
[1:02:15] god for granted
[1:02:18] you know the bible says in isaiah 5 20
[1:02:21] woe unto them that call evil good
[1:02:24] and good evil that put darkness for
[1:02:27] light
[1:02:27] and like for darkness that put bitter
[1:02:30] for sweet and sweet for better i believe
[1:02:32] that's today we're living in
[1:02:34] that they call what's what's evil is
[1:02:37] good and what we see what evil
[1:02:38] we call it evil the bride of christ says
[1:02:41] i ain't nothing
[1:02:42] i test i'm about filth but you know you
[1:02:44] see everything's changing this
[1:02:46] everything's starting to change we don't
[1:02:48] know where it's going but it's all in
[1:02:49] god's plan
[1:02:51] you know i started to realize i said god
[1:02:53] not my will but your will be done
[1:02:56] that's what we got to get in we gotta
[1:02:57] line up with jesus christ this morning
[1:02:59] and stop worrying about the politics
[1:03:01] it's not worth it being sold out to
[1:03:03] jesus christ this morning
[1:03:05] i'm not talking about just quoting
[1:03:06] around a quote book i'm going to talk
[1:03:08] about just saying you know all the
[1:03:09] scriptures in the bible
[1:03:10] but i'm saying being sold out for jesus
[1:03:13] sold out for your
[1:03:15] with your life no matter what gets taken
[1:03:17] away i'd rather have my bible in my
[1:03:19] message books
[1:03:21] no matter what it is i'd rather just hey

[1:03:25] all the message books and grab all the
[1:03:27] bibles
[1:03:28] i don't care about all the other because
[1:03:31] when you get to that revelation you
[1:03:32] realize hey i'm sold out to this truth
[1:03:35] i'm so thankful that you took me from a
[1:03:37] chicken yard and raised me up
[1:03:39] and if you're born and you were raised
[1:03:41] in this message
[1:03:42] you have something to be thankful this
[1:03:44] morning you have something that if your
[1:03:46] dad or mom's raised you in a godly home
[1:03:49] in the message
[1:03:50] i tell you you need to look at him and
[1:03:51] say thank you dad mom this morning
[1:03:53] thank you for raising me in the truth
[1:03:57] but we're living in the last days and we
[1:04:00] know that
[1:04:01] the prophecy has already prophesied so
[1:04:03] many years ago and saw
[1:04:05] all this coming down like a newspaper
[1:04:07] this morning for us and for every one of
[1:04:10] us to listen to
[1:04:11] a message and listen to it we're blessed
[1:04:15] and we're living such an upside down
[1:04:17] where prayer in school is wrong but
[1:04:19] homosexuality is right
[1:04:22] handing out bibles is wrong jesus is
[1:04:25] wrong
[1:04:26] talking to a preacher instead of instead
[1:04:28] going there into abortion clinic going
[1:04:30] to a preacher and praying with him and
[1:04:32] and whatever it is the ten commandments
[1:04:34] are wrong and
[1:04:35] filthy communication is right we're down
[1:04:39] to the last stage
[1:04:41] it's not a it's not a time to play
[1:04:43] around it's not time to play
[1:04:44] church it's the time to get into church

[1:05:18] heart is not sold out

[1:10:23] this morning it's got to be more than
[1:10:25] just
[1:10:26] i'm just i'm just floating along this
[1:10:28] morning it's going to be true dedication
[1:10:30] to jesus
[1:10:33] no matter it's not it's not a matter
[1:10:35] when the devil's coming this if he's
[1:10:37] coming
[1:10:37] it's he's coming and he's going to try
[1:10:39] to get in your family he's going to try
[1:10:41] to do something
[1:10:42] like you'll wake up tomorrow it didn't
[1:10:43] seem like the world's falling apart
[1:10:46] but i tell you i said get behind me
[1:10:47] satan i said hey
[1:10:49] when my times to come hey i'll go ahead
[1:10:52] i just pass on they don't do anything
[1:10:53] but change my
[1:10:54] my where my dwelling place is i'm so
[1:10:57] thankful for that
[1:10:59] that we just when we do pass on he just
[1:11:02] changes to our theophany
[1:11:04] oh how glorious is that going to be and
[1:11:07] i'm here to tell you church
[1:11:08] to be sold out for jesus this morning
[1:11:11] because i tell you you don't want to
[1:11:12] miss it for the world
[1:11:14] i say brother brown when he cry he
[1:11:16] crossed over and said time he saw what's
[1:11:17] coming he know who they were
[1:11:19] he said i was converted in your meeting
[1:11:20] that was converted to me he didn't want
[1:11:22] to go back
[1:11:23] down to that body he will go back down
[1:11:26] to the body because
[1:11:27] he got a glimpse of heaven he got a
[1:11:30] glimpse of that
[1:11:31] in that other dimension he wasn't even
[1:11:33] in heaven yet but he got the glimpse
[1:11:35] of being surrounded by love
[1:11:38] and by jesus just can you imagine how
[1:11:40] that's going to be
[1:11:42] how glorious it's going to be
[1:11:45] but it's no matter when the devil's
[1:11:47] coming but he's going to come
[1:11:49] in some way or some form in your family
[1:11:51] or where he knows where to punch brother
[1:11:54] braham said he knows exactly where to
[1:11:55] punch
[1:11:56] he said and you have to guard it
[1:12:01] well we got to be sold out this morning
[1:12:03] and if i had a title for this message i
[1:12:05] would call it sold out for jesus
[1:12:08] sold out for jesus christ
[1:12:13] not just to be another message believer
[1:12:15] i didn't grow up with my watch group in
[1:12:16] the message all alive
[1:12:17] how blessed that could be without taya
[1:12:21] but
[1:12:21] how much more blessed when you get your
[1:12:23] eyes open and the eye sounds applied
[1:12:25] and you go god thank you jesus
[1:12:28] thank you for the uh thank you for the
[1:12:30] truth that has opened the absolute even
[1:12:32] more to me
[1:12:36] but i want to bring a few points out
[1:12:38] this morning i try to hold you along
[1:12:39] but verse two verse two it made me think
[1:12:42] he said and ahab speak in the
[1:12:43] neighborhood saying
[1:12:44] give me thy vineyard that i may have it
[1:12:47] for a garden of herbs
[1:12:49] and i think that's what the devil does
[1:12:51] with this this morning he wants to put a
[1:12:52] little seasoning on it
[1:12:55] he wants to add a little bit of
[1:12:56] seasoning here to say hey the world's
[1:12:58] better
[1:12:59] or hey a little bit of garden of herbs
[1:13:01] you know what herbs are
[1:13:03] you know just a little bit of herbs put
[1:13:04] on there just give it a little taste
[1:13:07] you know he wants to give you a little
[1:13:08] better taste of oh this is better out in
[1:13:10] this world but there's nothing better to
[1:13:12] be
[1:13:12] to be under jesus christ this morning
[1:13:17] there ain't nothing better being sold
[1:13:19] out for jesus christ
[1:13:20] no matter what age we are we can always
[1:13:22] get closer to jesus christ
[1:13:24] there's always something in their lives
[1:13:26] that even my life that i say lord
[1:13:28] take that away from me lord take this
[1:13:30] away from me or if i'm speaking i'm
[1:13:32] speaking to you there's three more
[1:13:33] fingers pointing back to me say lord
[1:13:35] help me lord oh draw me closer to your
[1:13:38] manuals veins
[1:13:39] oh feed me this morning but he wants to
[1:13:42] give you a little taste
[1:13:45] it's just like the bible this morning
[1:13:46] they they sprinkle it down now they said
[1:13:49] that king james they got living water
[1:13:50] and
[1:13:51] living this and living that i got

[1:14:16] is they've got sold out to the devil and
[1:14:18] they started to even change the
[1:14:19] scriptures
[1:14:21] they start changing the bible this
[1:14:22] morning and they start to realize
[1:14:24] you want to know when you go to the gas
[1:14:25] station and why the world is just
[1:14:27] it's just going back and forth they're
[1:14:29] losing their minds

[1:17:39] put a little herb on it just water it
[1:17:42] down
[1:17:42] some or just give you a little living
[1:17:44] word bible and say hey
[1:17:45] read this or read that and you don't
[1:17:48] even have any meaning of what it means
[1:17:49] anymore
[1:17:52] the devil wants to come in and destroy
[1:17:54] families and
[1:17:55] i see it so much i see it more as the
[1:17:58] day approaching
[1:17:59] he's just sliding in just somewhere but
[1:18:02] but where does it happen at
[1:18:03] it's somewhere someone's left the open
[1:18:05] house sign on
[1:18:06] and said devil just come on in this
[1:18:08] morning or just
[1:18:10] you just sit over here for a minute i'll
[1:18:11] serve god i'll pray to god and then the
[1:18:13] next minute
[1:18:14] i'm busting out my wife and the next
[1:18:17] minute i'm doing this
[1:18:18] or the kids are watching your kids are
[1:18:22] watching every move you make
[1:18:24] they're watching everything i'll tell
[1:18:26] you my boy will bring something up
[1:18:27] all the time i said i don't know how you
[1:18:29] remember that but
[1:18:31] you're i'm telling you they said i guess
[1:18:33] from the ages like
[1:18:34] one or two like zero to six you're
[1:18:37] forming them like concrete
[1:18:39] i'm here to tell you if you haven't had
[1:18:40] kids this morning you ever get a family
[1:18:42] i tell you get sold out to jesus christ
[1:18:45] and get sold out to the word of god
[1:18:48] because i tell you you're forming them
[1:18:49] like concrete and when they get certain
[1:18:51] to a certain age i'm not saying jesus
[1:18:53] christ can't change
[1:18:54] him or fill him with the baptism of the
[1:18:55] holy ghost because he did me
[1:18:57] at the age of 21 years old he came down
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:00] it saved my soul and i saw the message
[1:19:04] grandma hand me a message book
[1:19:05] i was leaving for college and going to
[1:19:07] the military after i got in the military
[1:19:09] i did my first round
[1:19:10] came back she handed me a book she said
[1:19:12] here here here
[1:19:13] chris listen to these it was why you're
[1:19:15] on the nomination
[1:19:16] jezebel religion she had them and she
[1:19:19] said take these with you
[1:19:20] before i got halfway down the road i was
[1:19:22] just crying
[1:19:23] and i i think it's just be thankful that
[1:19:26] you had that deep cut to the deep this
[1:19:28] morning
[1:19:28] that you have something to respond to
[1:19:30] this morning that
[1:19:31] there's something on the inside that
[1:19:34] when you hear the problem of god
[1:19:35] you respond to it be thankful for that
[1:19:39] this morning
[1:19:41] but i really like this scripture he says
[1:19:44] it says the garden of herbs
[1:19:45] because it's nearing to my house
[1:19:48] and i started to think about that it's
[1:19:50] near into his house
[1:19:51] he's the first you know it's a garden of
[1:19:53] herbs and near into my house
[1:19:55] and i started thinking about convenience
[1:19:58] it's convenient what's convenient for
[1:20:01] you
[1:20:02] the devil wants to say hey this is
[1:20:04] convenient or listen to this or do this
[1:20:06] or do that
[1:20:07] hey i want to you know it's convenience
[1:20:09] it's nearer to my house
[1:20:10] but what's near into your house might
[1:20:12] not be what's what what the guy wants to
[1:20:14] give you this morning
[1:20:16] maybe it's maybe it's a better position
[1:20:18] but it's going to pull you away jesus
[1:20:19] christ
[1:20:21] maybe it's you sleeping yo
[1:20:24] i gotta get nine hours of sleep but i
[1:20:25] can't get six hours and go pray
[1:20:27] before i go to work for an hour
[1:20:30] oh i'm telling you church it's real i've
[1:20:32] been there i'm telling you
[1:20:34] oh they will say we'll sleep two more
[1:20:36] hours because you can hit the snooze
[1:20:37] button but
[1:20:38] the convenience of getting up and going
[1:20:40] to get on your knees and praying for
[1:20:42] your family this morning
[1:20:43] or laying hands on your children i walk
[1:20:45] in the bedroom and start rebuking the
[1:20:47] spirit and
[1:20:48] praying for it brother i'm even saying
[1:20:49] you're gonna have to wipe your glasses
[1:20:50] clean to see
[1:20:51] he said even how strong it will be each
[1:20:53] and every day every year each generation
[1:20:56] how much more demons
[1:20:58] but i tell you the church it's
[1:21:00] convenient oh it's convenient to stay in
[1:21:03] this warm bed and to get out of my knees
[1:21:04] and start praying
[1:21:06] well church i ask the lord help me even
[1:21:08] more
[1:21:11] stay in the bed or don't come to church
[1:21:13] when the doors are open
[1:21:16] or i got to go do this so i got my oxes
[1:21:19] in the ditch i always hear that so much
[1:21:21] they want to bring out these quotes with
[1:21:22] my axes in the ditch you can't go today
[1:21:24] oxford's in the ditch i'll tell you
[1:21:26] doc's going to ever get out
[1:21:28] he's the ox gonna ever get out of the
[1:21:30] den
[1:21:32] but i'll tell you when you get a solid
[1:21:34] foundation in jesus christ this morning
[1:21:36] your ox will get out of the ditch
[1:21:38] you won't take the deal you will move
[1:21:39] the you will move the ox out of the
[1:21:41] ditch this morning
[1:21:43] you'll get rid of the ox and you'll say
[1:21:44] you know what i'll deal with it on
[1:21:46] monday
[1:21:48] i'll deal with it on tuesday thursday we
[1:21:50] have thursday night y'all have wednesday
[1:21:52] night
[1:21:52] i'll deal with it thursday if you have
[1:21:54] service on wednesday
[1:21:55] the devil always wants to give us some
[1:21:57] kind of convenience or a little bit of
[1:21:59] urge to put on it just say
[1:22:00] hey just don't go there tonight
[1:22:04] but i tell you it's a dedication to
[1:22:05] jesus christ once you realize
[1:22:08] what you have in this day not just to
[1:22:10] come to church and when you wake up in
[1:22:11] the morning
[1:22:12] and you go lord you gave me what a
[1:22:14] glorious day it is to be awake
[1:22:16] well of course today as you hear the
[1:22:18] cold cases just on the rampage
[1:22:20] of life support and this and that and
[1:22:22] you realize
[1:22:23] that all you all your whole life hinges
[1:22:26] on jesus christ
[1:22:29] he decides when to pull the plug you
[1:22:31] don't decide when to pull the plot
[1:22:33] it's kind of like life support your life
[1:22:35] is when you're truly sold out in jesus
[1:22:37] christ
[1:22:37] your life support they might have a
[1:22:39] machine but i'll tell you what jesus
[1:22:41] christ has got the main machine this
[1:22:42] morning
[1:22:43] he's got a machine that goes a lot
[1:22:45] higher than a little cord this morning
[1:22:47] he's got a machine that goes up to the
[1:22:48] glory's and he tells you what he's going
[1:22:50] to pull your card this morning
[1:22:52] but we got to be sold out to jesus
[1:22:57] we got to be sold out how much the devil
[1:23:00] he would say hey i got a better vineyard
[1:23:02] and then it's near into my house but we
[1:23:05] gotta say
[1:23:06] on the firing lines this morning we
[1:23:08] gotta
[1:23:09] we gotta be a truly sold out to jesus
[1:23:12] not just say i'm sold out but truly
[1:23:14] until like buddy rob said brother brown
[1:23:16] said
[1:23:16] but he robson said i will pray if you
[1:23:19] find my bones
[1:23:20] out here i will pray to you fill me with
[1:23:22] the holy ghost
[1:23:24] and i believe sometimes there's people
[1:23:26] walking around the message that are not
[1:23:27] truly filled this morning
[1:23:29] they're not truly filled they they
[1:23:32] possess it or they say they got it in
[1:23:33] their possession
[1:23:34] but they don't possess it way down deep
[1:23:37] they don't possess it way down deep in
[1:23:39] their soul this morning
[1:23:40] that's why you see split up holes and
[1:23:42] you see still
[1:23:44] uh no hillary the healings are know you
[1:23:47] someone will pray for somebody they
[1:23:48] don't get healed because their faith
[1:23:50] they haven't built it
[1:23:51] on the statue of a perfect man then they
[1:23:53] built their foundation on faith this
[1:23:55] morning
[1:23:57] like the bible says in hebrews 11 faith
[1:23:59] is a substance
[1:24:01] of things hoped for the evidence of
[1:24:02] things not seen it's more than just
[1:24:05] something it's
[1:24:05] it's something that you possess
[1:24:10] we have to be sold out but we got to
[1:24:12] make our mind up our house is not for
[1:24:14] sale
[1:24:15] i don't care what they say you can sell
[1:24:17] all the material stuff but my house is
[1:24:19] not for sale
[1:24:20] i'm going to protect it i'm going to
[1:24:22] guide it i'm going to protect my family
[1:24:24] till i get out of here if he takes me
[1:24:26] tomorrow i'll do my best
[1:24:28] in jesus christ
[1:24:32] the devil's at war but
[1:24:35] i'm saying there's two powers he talks
[1:24:37] about the power of satan and the power
[1:24:38] of god
[1:24:39] he's got all these messages you can
[1:24:40] listen to they're wonderful messages
[1:24:43] but he talks about how you get the power
[1:24:44] of satan how the satan tries to come in
[1:24:46] but you have the power of god that's
[1:24:48] already conquered death hell in the
[1:24:49] grave
[1:24:51] that gave peter king's the king kingdom
[1:24:53] of hell because he said hey
[1:24:55] he said you know we haven't revealed
[1:24:56] this to you but my father in heaven's
[1:24:58] revealed it to you
[1:24:59] aren't you thankful that your father in
[1:25:01] heaven revealed you this message of the
[1:25:03] hour this morning
[1:25:05] he's revealed you this glorious truth
[1:25:07] and what are we doing with it church
[1:25:09] are we really sold out for jesus this
[1:25:11] morning
[1:25:14] well it makes me think brother brown i
[1:25:16] was thinking about the brother brown
[1:25:18] talks about the abstract of the title
[1:25:20] i know wonderful i want you to catch
[1:25:22] this this morning he said
[1:25:24] he said or if it seemed good to thee i
[1:25:26] will give thee the worth of it and money
[1:25:29] so here the devil is hey i'll just pay
[1:25:31] you off
[1:25:33] the devil wants to go sprinkle it down a
[1:25:35] little bit and then he wants to give you
[1:25:37] a little convenience
[1:25:38] and then he wants to pay you off hey
[1:25:40] i'll give you this
[1:25:41] i'll give you this better job hey you
[1:25:43] can move 14 states away there's not even
[1:25:45] a church around you'll make the smile
[1:25:46] money who cares who cares
[1:25:50] you have nothing when you have a
[1:25:51] glorious church like this and a
[1:25:52] wonderful pastor that you
[1:25:54] have and you go 15 states away and you
[1:25:56] make this amount of money it don't
[1:25:58] matter
[1:26:00] it don't even matter i'm telling you
[1:26:02] when you get solid the genius you start
[1:26:03] to realize
[1:26:04] if i have to drive 14 hours this way to
[1:26:06] come 14 hours back hey
[1:26:08] whatever it takes i'll do it but i'm
[1:26:11] going to be fed and my children are
[1:26:12] going to be fed
[1:26:13] and my soul is going to be fed but you
[1:26:16] got to get sold out
[1:26:18] brother brown says in this message
[1:26:23] confirmation and evidence in 1962
[1:26:26] he says when a man buys a car he must
[1:26:29] have a deed to the car
[1:26:31] he said and though he has not the car
[1:26:34] sitting in the garage
[1:26:35] if he has a deed it's confirmation to
[1:26:37] him that he owns that car
[1:26:40] because he has a deed or a title
[1:26:43] and then if he bought a piece of ground
[1:26:46] he says that
[1:26:47] he would have never seen the ground he
[1:26:50] said no nothing about the ground and yet
[1:26:52] have the abstract deed to that ground
[1:26:55] he said it belongs to us whether we have
[1:26:59] seen it or not it belongs to us the card
[1:27:02] belongs to us
[1:27:04] whether we have seen it or not yet we
[1:27:06] have it
[1:27:07] he said the title was given to us and we
[1:27:11] hold it in our possession in our name
[1:27:14] that title shows us that we own that car
[1:27:18] and the abstract deep tells us we own
[1:27:21] the property
[1:27:23] aren't you thankful from generations now
[1:27:25] that when he opens the land book of life
[1:27:27] that he's got an abstract title d
[1:27:29] tonight that started coming all the way
[1:27:31] down from abraham's seed
[1:27:32] that he could leak us right back to and
[1:27:34] say he they're my president
[1:27:37] they're my property this morning and it
[1:27:40] makes me think
[1:27:41] in matthew i was reading matthew sitting
[1:27:45] back there
[1:27:47] blessed five six everyone's heard this
[1:27:50] the beatitudes
[1:27:51] he's blessed are thee that which hunger
[1:27:52] and thirst after righteousness
[1:27:54] for they shall be filled blessed are
[1:28:00] they that which
[1:28:01] hunger and thirst it's it's something on
[1:28:04] our part that we got to do to this
[1:28:05] morning
[1:28:06] not let jesus is waiting on us to do
[1:28:09] something
[1:28:10] he says bless it it's a you know blessed
[1:28:13] are the great jesus is saying this
[1:28:14] blessed are they
[1:28:15] which do hunger and thirst after
[1:28:17] righteous for they shall be filled
[1:28:18] that's a promise this morning
[1:28:23] and i love this where he says matthew 6
[1:28:26] 19
[1:28:27] lay not up your their sword treasures
[1:28:29] upon earth
[1:28:30] where moth and rust do corrupt and where
[1:28:32] thieves break there and steal
[1:28:35] but lay up yourselves treasures in
[1:28:37] heaven
[1:28:38] where neither moth or rust do corrupt
[1:28:40] and where things do not break through or
[1:28:42] steal
[1:28:44] for where your treasure is there your
[1:28:46] heart will also
[1:28:49] we gotta lay our treasures we gotta be
[1:28:50] looking for that city john's all coming
[1:28:52] down this morning
[1:28:55] well i'm so thankful that when we're
[1:28:57] sold out to jesus christ
[1:28:58] that jesus paid the ultimate price he
[1:29:01] came from ivory palaces
[1:29:03] to save every one of us this morning i'm
[1:29:06] talking about the bride of christ this
[1:29:07] morning if you're filled with the holy
[1:29:08] ghost he came to redeem you this morning
[1:29:11] you are redeemed this morning he's just
[1:29:13] waiting for that last one to come in
[1:29:15] this morning
[1:29:16] he's waiting that last one to stop
[1:29:17] playing church and playing the message
[1:29:19] or living behind the quote this morning
[1:29:21] he's here to say get sold out for jesus
[1:29:23] and we can go home
[1:29:26] or he's waiting for one family member or
[1:29:28] one of you to speak to one family member
[1:29:30] they might be the last one we don't know
[1:29:33] all he's looking for you don't even have
[1:29:35] to say nothing to somebody he just
[1:29:37] like brother brown said the life behind
[1:29:39] the name makes the devil tremble
[1:29:41] he said the weakest christian can get on
[1:29:43] his knees and it makes the devil tremble
[1:29:46] you imagine someone sold out to jesus
[1:29:48] this morning that gets on their knees
[1:29:50] imagine what the devil does this morning
[1:29:53] when you're truly sold out to this truth
[1:29:55] and this glorious message you get sold
[1:29:57] out and you get on your knees imagine
[1:29:59] what it does to the devil this morning
[1:30:02] if he says the weakest christian it
[1:30:04] makes him tremble
[1:30:06] oh i'm so thankful this morning but it
[1:30:09] makes me think about this message
[1:30:11] brother bear preach possessing all
[1:30:13] things he was talking i'm a paraphrase
[1:30:15] for time
[1:30:16] but he talks about how this he this this
[1:30:19] gentleman went to abraham lincoln
[1:30:22] and he said he went to him and he
[1:30:23] started talking to him he said hey look
[1:30:25] he got a little trouble
[1:30:26] and he started to go to me said hey
[1:30:27] would you give him a pardon and finally
[1:30:29] he writes
[1:30:29] a little pardon he gives him a part and
[1:30:31] he brings it back and he he says
[1:30:33] get out of here with that they don't
[1:30:34] even and then the courts rule because he
[1:30:36] didn't accept the party
[1:30:38] that it didn't become a pardon church
[1:30:41] this morning we have a pardon this money
[1:30:43] we have something we can sell out to
[1:30:45] sell and i'll tell you it will pardon
[1:30:47] you from sin you know he'll pardon you
[1:30:48] he will heal you this morning it'll
[1:30:50] raise you anybody from the dead this
[1:30:52] morning
[1:30:52] it'll make you leave here this morning
[1:30:54] with a smile on your face
[1:30:58] but we got to get in the book we got to
[1:31:00] become one with the love letter brother
[1:31:02] branham said
[1:31:02] it's a love letter for the bride that
[1:31:05] when you read a letter from your wife or
[1:31:07] she sends you a text i can read in
[1:31:08] between the lines
[1:31:10] they might be just two it might be a
[1:31:12] little paragraph i'll tell you when i
[1:31:13] said the text is all broken up because
[1:31:15] i'm all over the place
[1:31:16] she'll send it all in a nice little
[1:31:18] paragraph and i got it for a paragraph
[1:31:19] for me
[1:31:20] it'll be 14 texts later
[1:31:23] but i'll tell you you can read inside
[1:31:24] that text and realize what you're saying
[1:31:27] just like when you open the book if the
[1:31:29] book is not coming off the pages for you

[1:32:16] but that's the grace of god this morning
[1:32:19] now claiming the blood of christ this
[1:32:20] morning
[1:32:21] that cleanses all our sins if you made
[1:32:24] everything right he's still a redemption
[1:32:26] he's coming for a bride church he's
[1:32:28] coming for a bride
[1:32:30] but we have to accept the pardon this
[1:32:32] morning we have to accept it this
[1:32:34] morning
[1:32:38] as romans 5 1 says therefore be adjusted
[1:32:41] by
[1:32:42] faith we have peace with god through our
[1:32:44] lord jesus christ
[1:32:46] by whom we are we have access by faith
[1:32:49] unto grace where we stand and rejoice in
[1:32:52] hope of the glory of god
[1:32:54] and not only so but the glory and
[1:32:56] tribulations
[1:32:57] no one tribulations worketh patience
[1:33:00] and hope make it not a shame because the
[1:33:03] love of god is a shed abroad in our
[1:33:04] hearts
[1:33:05] by the holy ghost which is given to us
[1:33:08] aren't you thankful that he's he
[1:33:09] went ahead and went set by the right
[1:33:11] hand of god
[1:33:13] and he has sent his holy spirit to fill
[1:33:15] us and to get us through every single
[1:33:17] day
[1:33:19] every single day the holy spirit is
[1:33:21] guiding and directing your life
[1:33:22] you might get out a little bit of the
[1:33:24] will but then he just pulls you right
[1:33:26] back in
[1:33:27] aren't you think well that he's holding
[1:33:30] your hand this morning
[1:33:33] problem said water of separation
[1:33:37] he said and we've got a title deed to it
[1:33:39] an abstract
[1:33:40] he goes it goes way back to calvary he
[1:33:43] said the day of pentecost when they said
[1:33:44] the promise
[1:33:45] isn't to you and to your children and
[1:33:48] them that's far off
[1:33:49] even as many as the lord our god shall
[1:33:51] call abstract deed amen
[1:33:54] reverend said clear all the way back to
[1:33:56] pentecost
[1:33:57] he said how far does it go back how many
[1:34:00] how many is it for
[1:34:01] as many as the lord will call he says
[1:34:04] the lord calls you he gives you an
[1:34:06] abstract title amen
[1:34:09] all the way back and the blood of jesus
[1:34:11] christ
[1:34:12] is just as good as it would have been
[1:34:14] shed 10 minutes ago
[1:34:16] aren't you thankful this morning he said
[1:34:19] 10 minutes ago
[1:34:21] not 2 000 years ago don't live in the
[1:34:23] past
[1:34:25] he said it's good for you just as it
[1:34:26] should 10 minutes ago
[1:34:29] oh church is fresh this morning his boy
[1:34:32] will
[1:34:32] will cleanse all our sin we make
[1:34:34] everything right and we get sold out for
[1:34:36] jesus christ
[1:34:37] and we don't want to say i'm living in a
[1:34:39] message what's that mean
[1:34:40] or i believe the message but get in the
[1:34:43] message bob
[1:34:44] said in the token message you've ever
[1:34:45] listened to it he said the message is
[1:34:47] jesus christ
[1:34:50] so i'm here to provoke you this morning
[1:34:51] to get in jesus
[1:34:53] we're living uncertainty times where
[1:34:55] everything's up in the air the hospitals
[1:34:57] are filling
[1:34:58] i'm not discrediting that but i'm not
[1:35:00] going to discredit his word
[1:35:01] with the word this morning okay he said
[1:35:04] greater is he that's in me
[1:35:05] that he that's in the world
[1:35:09] whatever we ask in his name he'll give
[1:35:10] it to us
[1:35:12] we got to be sold out to jesus christ
[1:35:14] that we could go right back and re-quote
[1:35:16] the scriptures to him
[1:35:18] that's what satan did when so when he
[1:35:20] went on 40 jesus went away 40 days
[1:35:22] i'm so glad that jesus christ gave us
[1:35:24] examples this morning
[1:35:26] that he could say hey he just said like
[1:35:28] that and the same would have been a way
[1:35:30] but he said it's written
[1:35:31] he said get behind me so if we're not in
[1:35:34] the scriptures
[1:35:35] or in these messages every day it's
[1:35:37] going to bring you down
[1:35:39] it's going to give you troubles in life
[1:35:40] life's going to throw you a lot of
[1:35:42] lemons but i'll tell you what
[1:35:43] jesus christ will give you everything
[1:35:44] you have need of
[1:35:46] your wife your girlfriend boyfriend
[1:35:49] whatever it is your family cannot feel
[1:35:51] that void but jesus christ
[1:35:53] my wife can't feel the void my boys
[1:35:55] can't feel the voice there's only one
[1:35:57] void that jesus christ has to fill you
[1:35:58] this morning
[1:36:00] and if he let you him feel
[1:36:03] if he feels that void then you'll need
[1:36:05] any other boy that you ever could think
[1:36:08] of
[1:36:10] but we got to get back and realize like
[1:36:12] he said i
[1:36:13] just love it and the blood of jesus
[1:36:17] christ is just
[1:36:18] as good as it would have been shed 10
[1:36:19] minutes ago
[1:36:21] just think about it close your eyes and
[1:36:23] think about that
[1:36:25] the blood of christ would have been just
[1:36:27] as good as it was shed 10 minutes ago
[1:36:30] church is powerful that's so powerful
[1:36:34] that
[1:36:34] that that it's just not it's just not a
[1:36:36] it's not a history book this
[1:36:38] morning
[1:36:42] brother braham said the power of the
[1:36:43] devil 1955
[1:36:45] 1955 he said if the devil that come to
[1:36:48] you tonight tried to send you to a
[1:36:51] premium grade he said tried to
[1:36:54] you up
[1:36:55] he said read god's abstract title deed
[1:36:58] he said by the stripes we're healed and
[1:37:00] if we don't want to believe that there's
[1:37:02] a holy ghost here
[1:37:04] the law of god that'll kick him out
[1:37:06] that'll prove it
[1:37:07] he said just ring up jesus central
[1:37:10] j-e-s-u-s
[1:37:12] he says find out if something don't take
[1:37:14] your place
[1:37:15] he says the angels of god will take
[1:37:17] their positions
[1:37:19] aren't you thankful tonight or this
[1:37:21] morning that when you call up jesus
[1:37:23] they take their positions it's like the
[1:37:26] military you would you would start
[1:37:27] marching you get ready and we were in
[1:37:29] fort bliss texas
[1:37:30] and we were we were trying to get ready
[1:37:32] to be deployed and went to washington
[1:37:34] when the war all over
[1:37:35] it's starting to be just get trained and
[1:37:37] we'll start training ourselves
[1:37:38] but you know what the bride of christ
[1:37:40] needs to start training her
[1:37:42] she needs to pick up the word of god
[1:37:44] this morning and pick up these messages
[1:37:46] you know what you want ammunition this
[1:37:47] morning just listen to the word of god
[1:37:49] this morning
[1:37:50] listen to what he called in this day
[1:37:52] they've even got churches where half the
[1:37:54] pillow fires not even you can't even
[1:37:55] find it in some churches
[1:37:57] or you got it back in the back or before
[1:38:00] you know it it's in the bathroom and
[1:38:01] before you know it it's in the car
[1:38:04] i tell you i love being associated with
[1:38:06] churches that's got the seven churches
[1:38:08] messengers
[1:38:08] and they got the prophet on the wall
[1:38:10] this morning
[1:38:11] i love it it it unites me because
[1:38:15] he has revealed this glorious message in
[1:38:17] this last day
[1:38:20] but we can call on jesus and he says the
[1:38:22] angels take their position
[1:38:25] you think about that when we call on
[1:38:27] jesus you might not see it but the
[1:38:28] angels just say come down and just start
[1:38:30] taking their position
[1:38:32] like in the military you start getting
[1:38:34] ready you start getting ready to get
[1:38:35] deployed or
[1:38:36] you train for months and years you
[1:38:38] probably somehow have been in here in
[1:38:39] the military
[1:38:40] and you train you train and you're under
[1:38:42] you're throwing grenades and you're
[1:38:44] under
[1:38:44] you're under fire and you're practicing
[1:38:47] you're practicing but you know what the
[1:38:49] bride of christ is doing the same thing
[1:38:50] right now
[1:38:51] the true bride of christ is preparing
[1:38:53] for a true rapture
[1:38:55] she's parent for that time where well i
[1:38:58] believe we're right here at the i
[1:38:59] believe that's what's going on
[1:39:00] the fires are being shot the
[1:39:02] government's taking over communism has
[1:39:04] come whatever it is
[1:39:06] but who cares if you're resting in the
[1:39:08] arms of
[1:39:09] jehovah jireh and you're resting in you
[1:39:11] know the arms of jesus this morning
[1:39:13] why are you worried this morning the
[1:39:15] devil wants to put a little bit of like
[1:39:17] he says in that scripture
[1:39:18] he wants to put a little bit of herbs
[1:39:19] this morning to water it down
[1:39:21] or to bring fear in our lives but i'm
[1:39:24] going to tell you this morning i want to
[1:39:25] encourage this more he tries to bring
[1:39:26] fear on me
[1:39:27] but i tell you i'll just push play and
[1:39:28] listen to a tape i'll be in the quieter
[1:39:30] that's in my car like the brother was
[1:39:32] saying
[1:39:32] and let the god where he can just speak
[1:39:34] to you maybe not even push
[1:39:36] play just let god speak to you sometimes
[1:39:39] he wants to speak to his children he
[1:39:42] wants you to speak back to him
[1:39:45] he really wants to have communion with
[1:39:47] you
[1:39:50] but he says the angels will take their
[1:39:52] position and the devil will get out
[1:39:54] and you could stand there on your toes
[1:39:56] and say yes sir it's the truth
[1:39:59] he said amen not up here or down here
[1:40:02] you read that you're you read your title
[1:40:05] clear
[1:40:05] twice this morning that he paid the
[1:40:07] ultimate price for you he said whosoever
[1:40:10] he didn't he didn't miss one person in
[1:40:12] this world whosoever should come
[1:40:15] let him come jesus christ i'll tell you
[1:40:18] he didn't he
[1:40:19] he didn't correct but he didn't create
[1:40:22] hell for
[1:40:23] for anyone he created for the devil and
[1:40:26] his his little
[1:40:27] the demons and his angels he created
[1:40:29] that he didn't want one person to miss
[1:40:31] heaven
[1:40:32] but it breaks my heart but when you pass
[1:40:34] these churches cope is going around
[1:40:36] but there's still there's still light on
[1:40:38] there's still just a little bit of light
[1:40:40] in this day
[1:40:41] there's just a little bit of light and
[1:40:43] i'm just here to tell you this morning i
[1:40:44] just want to tell you
[1:40:45] by the grace of god to keep pressing on
[1:40:48] and to sell out your home to jesus
[1:40:50] christ and don't let the devil in the
[1:40:52] back door or the front door
[1:40:54] you protect your home you stand up for
[1:40:57] what's right
[1:40:59] well that's first corinthians 6 20 says
[1:41:02] for we are bought with a price
[1:41:05] therefore glorify god in your body and
[1:41:08] your spirit
[1:41:09] which are god's we are bought with a
[1:41:11] price
[1:41:14] church jesus christ didn't come down the
[1:41:15] cross for our sins just to just
[1:41:18] just walk around say hey i believe a
[1:41:19] message or i believe this i believe that
[1:41:22] he wants us to be sold out for jesus
[1:41:26] he wants us to be sold out to jesus
[1:41:28] christ this morning god is good
[1:41:34] he's so good to us but we got to get a
[1:41:37] hunger and thirst
[1:41:39] we have to have that hunger if he if you
[1:41:41] don't if you come this morning you don't
[1:41:42] travel hunger
[1:41:44] you don't leave here this morning
[1:41:45] without getting the hunger
[1:41:47] they say god feel me until i can't feel
[1:41:50] it anymore
[1:41:51] fill my cup the problem is we have a
[1:41:55] vessel
[1:41:56] that we don't want to clean out we won't
[1:41:58] leave the world in it
[1:42:00] and it's some of god but we got to truly
[1:42:03] pour out all our will that's what jesus
[1:42:06] christ did
[1:42:08] he gone to christ said not my will but
[1:42:10] my father's will be done
[1:42:13] why not us why can't we say not our will
[1:42:16] we get our pride all caught up in things
[1:42:19] or we're somebody
[1:42:20] we're nobody but we are
[1:42:23] god's children if you're sealed under
[1:42:25] jesus christ you are
[1:42:26] sons and daughters of god at this moment
[1:42:31] but we got to empty out the vessel where
[1:42:33] he can feel he don't clean up
[1:42:34] he don't feel a dirty vessel this
[1:42:36] morning
[1:42:38] and there's things in our life are we
[1:42:39] messing with the world or whatever it is
[1:42:41] this morning
[1:42:42] i'm here to tell you to to to this
[1:42:44] should be the last day i'm gonna ask you
[1:42:46] to come to the altar 14 times
[1:42:48] whatever it is i'm telling you you can
[1:42:49] do it in your seat you can do it in your
[1:42:50] car you can do it
[1:42:51] on your way home you can do it at work
[1:42:52] wherever you're at but i'm telling you
[1:42:54] to get a real revelation of what we have
[1:42:56] in this day
[1:42:59] that we have what glorious light he's
[1:43:01] brought
[1:43:03] even said brother billy paul would say
[1:43:05] in jeffersonville he would tell me he
[1:43:06] said his dad would even iron the
[1:43:09] take here we go between services he
[1:43:12] would take his jacket and iron it almost
[1:43:14] pull it between the seats to iron
[1:43:15] the wrinkles out
[1:43:20] i tell you it just just really just
[1:43:23] i'm so thankful that all the things that
[1:43:26] he went through
[1:43:29] mostly jesus christ because that's the
[1:43:32] one who saved us brother brown didn't
[1:43:33] save us
[1:43:35] but i'm so glad that he did send a
[1:43:36] messenger in a day to open our eyes
[1:43:40] there's only one true savior and that's
[1:43:41] jesus christ
[1:43:43] and that's who we got to get into this
[1:43:44] morning
[1:43:46] like matthew 5 verse 5-6 it says blessed
[1:43:49] are the meek
[1:43:50] for they will inherit the earth blessed
[1:43:53] are those who hunger and thirst for
[1:43:54] righteousness
[1:43:55] for they will be filled not shall be or
[1:43:58] could be filled
[1:43:59] but will be filled blessed are the
[1:44:02] merciful
[1:44:03] for they will be shown mercy church we
[1:44:06] gotta get a true revelation
[1:44:08] of what jesus christ did in our day
[1:44:11] you know enoch saw it noah saw it noah
[1:44:14] was warned he said build an ark 100
[1:44:16] over 100 years just keep building you
[1:44:18] think about how crazy they thought he
[1:44:19] was
[1:44:20] i don't know if you've been over to the
[1:44:21] ark in kentucky i think it's in kentucky
[1:44:23] they just build the ark how many times
[1:44:25] they would come up to them probably say
[1:44:27] what are you doing we've never seen no
[1:44:28] rain there's not a first one
[1:44:30] but you know what brother you know
[1:44:32] brother noah had a forecast
[1:44:34] he saw a forecast this morning he saw a
[1:44:36] forecast in his heart
[1:44:38] and that's the same forecast the bride
[1:44:39] should be seeing this morning
[1:44:41] they should see a forecast this morning
[1:44:43] they see the heaven the heavens coming
[1:44:45] down and where you know they say that
[1:44:46] song where it says
[1:44:47] the will speed up and they'll slow down
[1:44:49] i believe that's coming church
[1:44:51] i believe no matter what they say about
[1:44:53] me or what they say i'm sold out for
[1:44:55] this message
[1:44:56] i'm sold out to the true word of god
[1:44:58] this morning
[1:45:00] we got to get to that way we got to get
[1:45:02] to that point where noah was
[1:45:05] built in the ark and they started
[1:45:07] talking about but he was sold out for
[1:45:08] jesus
[1:45:10] he kept building the ark no matter what
[1:45:11] they said but two by two
[1:45:13] two by two they started getting on this
[1:45:15] huge ark they started getting on there
[1:45:16] after this many years no rain
[1:45:18] and then he floods the earth
[1:45:21] but church i believe the art door is
[1:45:22] starting to close
[1:45:24] i'm not just here to preach a message of
[1:45:27] your uh just
[1:45:28] a message just to flood the altars
[1:45:30] whatever it is whatever's on your heart
[1:45:31] this morning you're more
[1:45:32] welcome but i'm here to tell you i truly
[1:45:35] believe the art door is closing
[1:45:38] and i truly believe i don't just get on
[1:45:39] the road just to travel
[1:45:41] i get on the road to say look the art
[1:45:43] door is closing this morning
[1:45:45] it could be the last service this
[1:45:46] morning that we'll be meeting
[1:45:48] the dead in christ shall rise and we'll
[1:45:50] meet him in the air
[1:45:51] this could be the very last service that
[1:45:54] we could get sold out
[1:45:55] and make one he's our one attitude talks
[1:45:58] about the one middle attitude could
[1:46:01] deter our destination
[1:46:05] and how we accept the word this morning
[1:46:09] but noah sitting here building this ark
[1:46:11] for so many years
[1:46:12] all this hate all this hate but he still
[1:46:15] stayed on track
[1:46:16] because he was sold out to jesus just
[1:46:19] like abraham and sarah 25 years
[1:46:22] she even went away and laughed but he
[1:46:24] said hey i'm sold out we're gonna
[1:46:25] if he said it that's it if he said he's
[1:46:28] coming for a bride i'm gonna be the
[1:46:29] bride
[1:46:31] if he said he's coming he's gonna be a
[1:46:33] rap shop
[1:46:34] we'll be in the rapture but we gotta get
[1:46:37] sold out to jesus christ this morning
[1:46:40] as the positions come this morning
[1:46:42] there's got a few other things to read
[1:46:47] but i'm just here to tell you this
[1:46:48] morning we got to stop playing open
[1:46:49] house with the devil
[1:46:51] we got to stop leaving our houses open
[1:46:53] for the devil just to
[1:46:55] ponder over i tell you a family member
[1:46:57] called me said
[1:46:58] you know something happened this was not
[1:47:00] even long ago and i'm just telling you
[1:47:01] excuse me for
[1:47:02] for experiences but i'm just here to
[1:47:03] tell you it happens to me happens to all
[1:47:05] of us
[1:47:07] and they called and they were they were
[1:47:09] fostered this and that they were human
[1:47:10] and
[1:47:10] they were like why do you protect your
[1:47:13] wife so much because i love her
[1:47:16] because we're one i'm the same way with
[1:47:19] the word of god in this message
[1:47:21] i love it because he found me one day
[1:47:27] and i got sold out to jesus and now i
[1:47:29] protect this
[1:47:30] more than i do anything because once you
[1:47:34] realize what we have in this day
[1:47:35] it'll change your life and once you get
[1:47:38] sold out to jesus christ
[1:47:40] and not leaving the house is open saying
[1:47:42] devil come in or come in
[1:47:44] and they play something softly just
[1:47:47] think about it for just a minute
[1:47:49] we can be in school for hours or we can
[1:47:50] be at work for hours but we can't give
[1:47:52] god
[1:47:52] an hour of our time
[1:47:56] just one hour on a sunday or wednesday
[1:47:59] or whatever it is
[1:48:00] sunday night whatever it is
[1:48:06] we'll read this in closing first peter
[1:48:09] chapter 2 it says but we are a
[1:48:12] chosen generation a royal priesthood
[1:48:16] a holy nation a peculiar people
[1:48:20] that we should show forth the praises of
[1:48:23] him
[1:48:24] who have called you out of darkness into
[1:48:26] this marvelous light
[1:48:29] what a marvelous light we have
[1:48:34] which in time past we're not people we
[1:48:36] were not a people
[1:48:38] but we are now the people of god
[1:48:41] which had not attained mercy but now
[1:48:43] have obtained mercy
[1:48:46] church i believe that comes off the
[1:48:47] scripture more than me and ever
[1:48:49] that he's called us out to a glorious
[1:48:51] light
[1:48:53] glorious message he's opened every
[1:48:56] genesis to revelation
