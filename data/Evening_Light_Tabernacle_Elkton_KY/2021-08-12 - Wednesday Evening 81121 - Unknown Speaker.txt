[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] lord i can't even walk without you holding my hand oh lord i can't even walk without you holding [Applause] down on [Music] amen is that how you feel in your heart tonight god bless you it's good to see each and everyone out tonight and we have several out tonight but the steve and sister becky are not here and steve said he had some sinus issues and uh he said he got tested for covert but he'd see everybody sunday so he's not positive so we appreciate that tonight and i know there's uh it's going very rampant i know there's several churches that have have a lot of people in them that are have are sick so we just want to remember the different ones and i haven't heard how the the group in johnson city are doing and i and the the group in oklahoma and i was watching on uh youtube last night or facebook last night uh brother steve shelley they had their they have a service on tuesday night and they just had it

you musicians appreciate it amen god is good isn't he amen i mean he loves the thankful lord serve a god like amen like he is we're good all right let's bow our heads kind heavenly father once again we come before your throne of grace lord desiring god that you just meet with us lord jesus as we have assembled ourselves together lord and in your name just ask god that you'll come in a special way speak to our hearts along the way that it might burn within us that we might know that it was you that's speaking to us lord and we ask god that we bless each one that has come out and for those that are not feeling well we ask god this special touch lord jesus from you father that they would raise up again to full strength full health and lord jesus to be able to enjoy the life that you have given the lord now lord we ask for direction from you from your spirit to lead us to guide us father help us to say just what you once said lord jesus and not to say anything we shouldn't lord bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart our assembling together now as we commit our hearts and our lives to you in jesus name amen and amen amen want to speak on a little subject tonight with the help of the lord there was a word just a word basically that came into my mind amen and i just began to think about it and lord just seemed to quicken it so we'll see what the lord will have for us amen and it'll go along with what we've been talking about about god building a habitation amen i mean believe that's what god is doing amen so that he could inhabit our hearts and our lives amen inhabit the church of god now when he does inhabit it we want to follow that thought for a minute amen we want to see what that's like amen so turn your bibles if you will go to the scripture that i just came to and came to my mind amen and i was thinking uh the word image amen the word image came to my mind amen and i was thinking about i mean when a person passes away and you know the preacher will say all kinds of things different things about that person most of the time i'm a lot of times i'll preach funerals and for the most part you'll say everything good about the person that you know or that you can at a funeral is not a good place to go the other way amen and so whether it's good or bad you just speak the good amen and let the rest fall where it may amen and you know but sometimes i've been at funerals and i've heard things said and so forth you know and i think it was even the prophet of god said that there's no uh really they live their lives and and people know what kind of person he was or she was right and no amount of words will change their mind about that you know because they live their lives and their lives said more about them than a preacher ever will or anybody saying anything you know but basically when when person is laying there you may look at that person and but you realize you're just looking at a person and one and everything about that person uh comes into your mind and you have an image in your mind of what that person was like right you know and this can happen not just in that case but i would probably say that in that case uh you know it would be more vivid perhaps than at any other time because you think about that person you think about his life you don't so much look at the person's uh outside you know that way as you think about the person's what character right the kind of character that he was the kind of person that he was what that person was like to be up close to to talk to to be around the atmosphere that that person created right and we all carry that atmosphere around us don't we amen and our our brother bam called it i guess an aura you know and there's just something about each one mccarra or we care a atmosphere amen and that's either a good atmosphere or a not so good atmosphere and we've heard probably god describe how that there's people he loved to be around and others not so much so you know i'm saying it so all of that comes in and i got to thinking about the image that a person thinks of when they look at that person and then i went over and it began beginning to think about the image of god you know you know if you could see god or if you would think about god what would come into your mind right what kind of an image would you have in your mind if you thought about god and then i thought you know this word image and the thought of an image is pretty powerful and we'll read it now and we'll see just how powerful that is in romans 8 in romans 8 and verse 28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate now notice all of this foreknowledge that we talk about all this predestination that we talk about and know about it goes somewhere right it has a purpose in it whom he did predestinate he he also did pronouncing it to be conformed to the image of his son amen so we see that word image there in relation to his son that anybody he predestinated anybody that he foreknowed he predestinated them to be conformed to an image right amen that image is to be an image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen you know i was praying back there as i was praying i got to thinking of how that here we are here on this wednesday night we've come out on a wednesday night again we've got another service again you know and perhaps we come and we just think well we have another service but you know we realize that this church amen and so i wanted to phrase it this way we come out and we're fixing to have one less service one less service we're here tonight to feel to have one less service because how many know one of these days this is all going to be memory well you know it's not if we're not going to be able to have service anymore it's going to stop all this is going to stop amen and there's just so many services that we're gonna have amen so tonight just takes one of those services off we get a little closer to that last one right just kind of like our breath every time you breathe you got so many that you got coming and every time you take one you're taking one less you're subtracting amen i got to thinking of how that amen like i think brother dave was saying that's what will it be when we get over yonder and join the throng upon the glassy sea we realize that was that way for paul and peter and all of those those those people are sealed away this evening in a different dimension right in their age now how many knows that when the prophet of god when brother brown seen his people in his age i don't believe he saw paul's age irenia's age martin said he didn't see all of them he just saw the millions for his age so i don't know how it works all i know is that they all are gathered in that age and just the thing with our little minds that they have been over there paul has been peter has been they've been over there under the author there in that place where they don't eat or drink and they're in a great place for almost 2 000 years well i guess it's over 2000 years now right it's over two thousand for two can you imagine being in one place for over 2 000 years uh to me brother pete i'd be thinking we're getting just a little fidgety come on can we do something else now but you know it's so perfect that i'm sure that there is never no tomorrow like the prophet said there was no yesterday everything is just now it's perfect it's beyond what you can imagine so they're perfectly happy where they are can i go a little down fantasy i landed my imagination a little bit would that be all right and then when we think on the other hand of cain huh nathan car we think about those people way back there that they have been in their nightmare for close to 6 000 years amen that's a long time let me know six thousand years that's a long two thousand years is a long time two thousand years in the land of bliss that be fine there's nothing wrong with that but to be in the other place that would be a whole different story amen and you know you realize you know all of us were just so focused we could just realize how temporary we are here how this is so temporary amen just a vapor that comes and goes that's all your life is it's just a little vapor that comes and goes amen and it really won't mean much at all it'll have been better for you and have to have been born if you don't have god if you don't walk with god amen so i got to thinking how that they've been waiting for all that time but you know how many knows the time is drawing nigh time is drawing nigh prophet said that paul's age will come up irene as his age will come up columbus age will come up amen luther wesley all those age will come up and we'll come up and fall right in line we'll all go meet the lord in the air amen won't it be something and we're looking for that time and i got to thinking of how you know it's getting to where uh antifa and different are attacking churches and so forth and like brother david said it's getting a little scary i imagine you're going to get a whole lot more scary yet amen and so we'll just have to watch that unfold you know but aren't you glad to be in god's hands and to know that the lord is leading you the lord is guiding you and so i got to thinking about this image of god amen the image of god and so god has predestinated for us of course we know a lot of this tonight but is it okay for me to go over it again amen and brother bannon and i got to thinking about this image and then i remembered hearing the message brother brandon preached in 1958 you'll have to scroll down and find it but i believe it's called images of christ images of christ amen and so and i got that now i'm not going to go down and pull anything out of there and do a study but because i want to go a little bit different direction amen but as we think about this the image of his son an image that's what it's all about it's all about god having us in a certain image when people look at you what do they see when they look at me what do they see what do they think one image pops into my mind in their mind right because it's really about the character and even about the character of god amen now we know in genesis 1 26 god said let us make man in our image amen after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image amen how many believes that's what we were created for we were to create it to be a amateur god a son of god you know when you have a little boy or a little girl or whatever it might be and you know most of the time a little boy says boy that's a that's a little johnny running around right there or a little pill or whatever it might be you know it's just the amateur of the father we hear words like he's the spitting image of his father or she's a spitting image of her mother or you know she's in the image of her mother or whatever it might be or chip off the old block or something that's what god is looking for he's looking for to bring forth what he says that he might be the first of many the first of many so we find that god created him in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them amen now this is where the prophet of god pulls in and he says you know when god made adam he made him both masculine and feminish well i guess some of them other folks that run with that wouldn't they and he had both both both of it both of it was in him until he took the rib out of the side and he took that feminist part and made a woman out of it that's right so as guys we just don't go around saying oh my we just don't do that right right why because it's something a moment we don't have the don't have one to have the same emotions and it makes you sick when somebody else does right because why we know that they have a feminist spirit on them unfortunately men can get feminist spirits on them and women sure can get masculine spirits on them amen and it's uh such a perversion of the image of god didn't brother bam say you know the women are cutting their hair off putting pants on and the man didn't get long hair amen so there was just a perversion of the image of god now we know that after the fall i mean it was after the fall now we could talk much about before the fall because we know before the fall adam was in the image of god he could speak to a mountain he could say this he could say that and it would all happen he had the power of god behind him but after the fall that image was broken you know right he was used to pet the lion he was friendly with the lion but boy afterwards he got scared of the lion he had to run up a tree because that lion he looked way too vicious to stick around right he had to go run for his life he was scared amen fear all don't think him in but all through the old testament god was trying to get a man back in his image wasn't he brother man appreciate masterpieces where i thought another one brother man preach a masterpiece amen talking about how god has been trying to build a masterpiece like michelangelo did amen that michelangelo had a picture of his mind his mind about how moses looked and just what he was when he had that perfect sculpture of moses he got oh so inspired took his hammer and smacked him on the knees and speak amen well michelangelo just wasn't quite close enough to god yet buzzy he thought maybe he could speak but he didn't speak did he no but he was inspired he said this is what it was look like and you know that's where it was in the old testament we had great men like david we had people like well even abraham was the first that was chosen by god he had the faith that god was looking for and that right oh he was so so righteous and so holy until he says you know because he has believed and he's because of his belief god accepted him amen but abraham certainly wasn't perfect was he no abraham he was a little liar his wife could talk him into stuff he she shouldn't have been able to talk into him hagar and so forth isn't that right and all of these children the ishmael's children you know that we still have to deal with today easy or not [Laughter] but anyway we know that all of that right and so you know but still it was not perfect he was not perfect but boy they did some great things didn't they there were some men like david that could kill those lions that man he had faith in god and he was a man after god's own heart and i don't even like to preach the bad stuff about him but we still have to sometimes right you know that he was a murderer and he was uh you know you know he took him another man's wife and everything else hey david come on man you can have 500 of them but just don't take another man's how about it right but no he had to have some other mans and they got into all kinds of trouble stuff but it was because of his repentant heart life thing i've heard other ministers say it too i believe it is but because of his repented art and wanting to be right right sure he made mistakes but he wanted to be right that's a whole lot more than a lot of people want to be amen and so because of that he was after man god's god's own heart it was represented in there and then you take samson that could kill a thousand philistines you know and he and he gave his strength to the lord is that right god used his strength and he was invincible right he was an image of god boy god can't be stopped the whole philippine filipino philip philistine army oh oh philistine army was scared of samson because i don't care how much you throw at him he's going to overcome all of you and that was just an image there was a little flicker show of a image of god and what god is really really like moses taking a stick and going down to egypt amen going down to take over moses was a great mighty man of god and he was greatly used until pharaoh had to fear him amen but what did he had he still had an imperfection he had a temper problem he smoked he smote the rock twice when he was supposed to just speak to it and brother braham said he broke all the scriptures hard to imagine but just because of his temper and it kept him out of the promised land amen and so forth from going over on down just different ones all the way down we'll come on the down to christ here till finally guess what finally jesus showed up is that right finally jesus showed up and when he showed up all this mysterious god of the old testament the god because how many know god is a pillar of fire he's a consuming fire that's what god is and many people have always wondered what this great god was like but in hebrews 1 let's go to hebrews 1. verse one god who had sun dry times in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets oh god had a great way of speaking to everybody back in the old testament sure many different ways but he had in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he had appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds how many believes that he made the world by jesus christ who being now notice who being the brightness of his glory that's who jesus was he was the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person amen he was so much like god that he said my knee and my father are one if you have seen me you have seen the father in other words i am the perfect expression of almighty god i come in the perfect image of god wow the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high so here we see that god finally finally found somebody that was in his perfect image a perfect image anyone and the first thing he does what have what's one of the first things that jesus does he goes up into a mountain matthew 4 i believe it is to be tempted by the devil right that's the first thing and this is where we could take a whole series we could take four or five service probably but i'm gonna go through this just as the holy spirit leads but that was the first thing the first thing that he did was taken up into it into the mountain to be tempted and try now i've got about five six seven things here wrote down that i want to test ourselves with to see whether we're in that image or whether we're not is that okay but first i want to go a little further let's just take christ we know that he overcome everything amen and that he went and he overcome death hell on the grave he overcame all of those things isn't that right and he uh you know ascended up into the heavens right he was lifted up on high and on the day of pentecost his spirit christ in spirit form again came back hello his spirit came back because he was about once again like he said i come from the pillar of fire and i go back to the pillar of fire in other words he said i come from god and i go back to god amen i go back to the form i was before and when paul's alarmed what did he see he didn't see jesus's face he'd seen a light a bright light struck him down and that bright light said i am jesus whom thou persecuted at the same time on the day of pentecost christ divided himself up in his people right in his people he divided himself up and what did he do when he filled peter up filled all those up amen they went out into the streets and preached the gospel amen this is where brother brahm talked about how that even i heard him saying it today i believe it was in masterpiece he talked about seeing that bride twice the first bride was beautiful the second was beautiful all in shape and everything except the very last fuel began to get out of step a little bit but got back in line he was fixing to rebuke him but before he did i understand they got back in line so forth but it was two two previews and he makes mention that that first fraud was perfect another place brother bam talked about that first church she was so much in the image of god i may believe that church was so much in the image of god until people could just walk in the shadow of peter and be healed wow isn't that right they looked like jesus they walked like jesus everybody took note that they had been with jesus i believe let me just say this if if there's anything people ought to be able to do when they look at you when they think about you they should say now that person is a christian that person knows christ just like they did to peter they took note they might be illiterate and didn't know their abcs but they took though that they had been with jesus amen so that first church it was in the image of christ they'll lay hands on the sickness shall recover if any uh if they shall take up serpents and it shall not harm them right paul what didn't paul get bitten paul was a prisoner he was a real good example of a christ christian and didn't say that paul was so much like christ that's why he was chosen for that church age messenger then brother went on down to those others people the people that ones that reflect that christ the closest to is the one that were chosen for the church hp amen not so much that way as it was they lived so close to god am i right god chose them and then we seen their lives that they lined up with that word amen but they reflected but brother brown says that that second eve fell and they're right she fell and went into the dark ages and it got so bad until when we came back up folks we had we had uh all kinds of wrong baptisms wrong gods wrong this wrong that martin luther boy i'll tell you what i could maybe show that film again sometime it was great had he was brought before that pope and that pope says well are you gonna renounce this or not he says i can't with a clear conscience couldn't do it something to that extent i can't do it can't go against my conscience and deny that because it's the truth oh he was a great but then brother bam said he smoked some and drank some huh he still had a drinking problem they thought it was all right to smoke and decent guy to the other wellesley come along and he was a little better it looked a whole lot better didn't it that's why he preached sanctification clean heart queen life and all these things he preached that they made it bring restoration to that masterpiece coming back up a little more to the image come on folks when your baptist friend comes out there and says oh praise be to god and lights up a cigarette it just blows the image of heart you know how many times i might as well just get personal with you brother i'll tell you what you don't know how much i use this chew dip right i still have nightmares of of somewhere in somewhere and and however i'll have a dip in my mouth i'm like what in the world is this thing about get it out of here now it's just a devil may break tormenting me you know because i ain't dip since i quit many many years ago but anyway but it would it would you wouldn't really believe their testimony you know if i come out here i mean a spittoon up here right hey there's people there's preachers sitting preaching there i'll say i got their ashtrays right there people don't think none of it but you and i would defile this temple and god will destroy you amen so on we go think about that there there was certainly not the perfect image it was great what it was great but then the rest they come along and boy well i'll tell you what that was okay but they denominated even they denominated and then a long time pentecost comes the restoration of the gifts huh but we know that the fullness of the holy ghost didn't come until the fullness of the word came is that right and people who oh man they were more happy about the gifts than they were the giver all the speaking in tongues the evidence and so forth and they harp down on that brother brandon come along and says you know it's not so much that because that man back there he can speak in tongues he can prophesy but he's living with another man's wife that ain't gonna that ain't gonna work it may wait for the holy ghost which is christ himself to come back into the church how many believes christ himself has come back into the church he absolutely has because you've got to remember even the prophet taught this that it's just because you don't do a lot of healing somebody else has been perhaps given the gift of healing he's given you the burden of prayer for that person and that person does what he's supposed to do it's a body work and i believe what god did through the prophet of god was a body work huh and so we had the fullness of the word come back the fullness of the word now brother bran taught that we had a lot of reformers but in this hour we had a prophet that come anymore and he's a divine interpreter of the word and we know if this prophet would have taught us something different from this right here we would have never believed it now we wouldn't accept it even an angel sometimes would come and talk to the prophet but he'd have to take it back to the work make sure that the angel is saying what that word said because paul said if anybody come and preach anything else if he's an angel from heaven if he preaches something different let him be a curse it has to line up with the word of god brother brandon preached these things and one time i believe he was a baptist boy of some kind i forget his name but he came up there behind him and says brother that could be the what is it the extra chapter of revelation i think we got 22 chapters or something any third 23rd chapter up that could be another chapter but he was saying he was off the word and i'm not sure if it was him but just after he spoke that is where that prophecy came up because thou has chosen the harder way and all that there's a different one's a frenchman different ones interpreted tongues and interpretation of kong he says that don't need interpretation that was perfect friend and they all wrote down what that spirit said huh christ coming down and proving no that wasn't no extra chapter that was the bible that he taught amen my aren't you glad for that i'm resting on that folks how many of you is resting i'm resting that the prophet of god taught what paul taught that's what they all said over beyond the curtain of time when he says well brother brown says if i'm going to be judged for what i have taught will paul be and they said yep paul's going to have to be preached or he'll be i have to be judged for what he has said well he said well praise be to god then i don't have nothing to worry about because i've saved and i said just what paul said amen whether it's predestination whether it's godhead or whatever it might have been amen so what do we see in this hour we've seen again the image of god restored in the bride in the church amen oh my and this just comes to mind because i want to go through a couple steps is that okay now i've got a page here that talks about one of the first things jesus did was overcome temptation by the devil and we learned how he overcame amen how many wants to follow in the footsteps of christ if you want to be in the image of christ you're going to have to act like him you're going to have to talk like him you're going to have to walk like him you're going to have to breathe like him you're going to have to love like him you're going to have to everything he does if you're going to be in his image amen one of the first things we learned is that when the devil tempted him he got his feather sense he didn't get his other sins with david huh he didn't get his fellowship with moses he got him he had got him to fall but this man here he could not get jesus to fall oh my he overcome temptation [Music] amen on the mountain whether it was making bread or whether it's popularity amen it was unless at the end of lust of the flesh it was all three of those that was presented to him amen and he's got his feathers changed probably god said he hit a hundred thousand volt wire when he come to jesus he said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god he overcame let me tell you if you are in the image of god you will overcome by the word of god how many believes that and by the word of your testimony every song of god you ever gonna get saved is because i believe the word said by his stripes amen that he shed his blood amen he forgot to love the world that he gave his only begotten son if i believe in him i will not perish but i have everlasting life you believe that with all your heart you come o you overcome by the word of god amen praise be to god remember the prophet of god was told don't you drink or don't you smoke or don't you defy your body in any way private work for you to do amen now i'm going to say something a little strong here but the prophet of god overcame before he got ever saved that right you know where can people go to if this hey because when that little girl said well you're such a you mean you don't go to dances and you don't smoke huh he says well you know he said give me that cigarette he tried to do it and a wind came and blew it out wouldn't let him remember when he tried to take a drink got hand got the shaking because he didn't want to be no sister sure but god was protecting his gift amen all right let's look at a couple more things how many knows that god first of all one thing about a characteristic of jesus christ was when he began to speak when he began to preach he did not come with a wishy-washy sermon he did not come with saying well this don't matter and that don't matter he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen if you're going to be in the image of god you're going to have to believe and live on every word another characteristic of jesus christ was he was not rich in this world but he was rich in god he didn't care so much about whether he had food or clothes is that right [Music] but he said you know oh great how little of faith that he had he was poor in this world but he was rich in god and that's the way we got to be amen we don't care so much about the things of the world as we do the things of god sure we're blessed beyond a measure isn't that right but we come on a wednesday night because we care more about god than we do this world if we possibly can we always want to do what the lord's what pleases the lord another thing amen remember one time he says have you got any meat they were hungry and so forth have you got anything to eat what did jesus say my meat is to do the father's will and they wanted to find out whether they had any food i want you to know more than eating food more than my necessary food it's his meat to do the father's will his passion was to do what god wanted him to do if you're going to be in the image of god that's going to be your passion number two another thing he says i always do that which pleases the father amen don't we all want to be able to say that i always do what is pleasing to the holy spirit because that's the father how many knows that's the father the father is the holy ghost when jesus shows the father he said the father dwelleth in me how many knows the spirit come down from up there up above and abode on jesus christ the bible says he was the fullness of the godhead bodily when jesus but when thomas says my lord and my god amen praise be to god he did nothing but what the father showed in his meat was to do the father did nothing but what the father showed him first how many knows that's where we fail a lot of times it's because we do things before god chose us to do it before he tells us to do it amen because i'll tell you right now if you'll do only that which the holy spirit shows you you'll be in good shape you'll be following the footsteps of the lord and i believe that's why it's so important and i'm trying to listen i don't know about every day i'm trying to listen harder every day i go down the road and i say lord i want a greater relationship today than i had yesterday i want a deeper walk with you lord than what i had yesterday because we're getting closer folks this comes to mind brother bam says you'll either meet him as a masterpiece that he's worked on or you'll meet him as a floating piece of driftwood to go into your final destination god's working on us how many believes that he's working on us do we always put god first is god first in everything that's a big thing how many knows that's a big thing we've said that a lot around here haven't we about putting god first and you know i just thought of another scripture that backs that up where the one of the first commandments was thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart all i might mind soul and strength you're to love him with all that you got that's putting him first amen because if you don't you'll get yourself in the way how many believe that amen brother brahma says god wants to mold and make us what he wants us to be but how can he do that how can god do that do you realize that when brother branham was here malachi 4 when jesus christ would come to the audience and he would discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart we don't have that gift anymore do we i don't say that it can't happen you know i'm saying but that gift of malachi 4 and that gift of that prophet that was created so close amen i i wish to god we could have prophet of god here doing that wouldn't you like that but to think that jesus christ would come down there knew that and then the preachers of that hour pentecostals of that hour would excommunicate anybody that would go to them services can you imagine that's why brother brown says you know how can he do that when we will stand still for him to do it we want to be our own master that's exactly what they want they wanted to do their own thing oh we should stop there we got to test that with ourselves don't we to make sure that we're not being our own master amen because when he comes folks and he's going to come images of christ brother bam says you know i believe he's coming i believe he's coming any time now he will come and he he's you say to me he says well i've heard that for so long but everybody says yes one of these days you're going to hear that for the last time amen you'll say that for one last time one of these days while i've been waiting for so long we've been looking for him so long one of these days is the last time and he'll be here and we'll either be in his image or we won't amen you see why i'm just taking a few things i have so many things that you could take the life of jesus christ and see whether we fit in that image or not because it's all about growing and right it's all about changing it's all about getting closer moving up a little higher that's what it's all about i don't care where you are i care about where you want to be and i'm telling you here i i know i need to grow and i know we all need to grow we need to get closer into that image amen amen and i believe this that we're going to be like enoch that had a testimony and like jesus enoch it says before he was translated he had this testimony that he pleased god forget pleasing me forget about worrying about whether the pastor is going to get onto you or not forget about that you start thinking about god and you think about whether you're pleasing him or not everything else will be just fine amen or this person or that person that's that's what's going to be important because if you're doing it amen just because you don't want people to know or think evil of you or whatever no that's not the right reason you want to do it because you want to be pleasing to the lord amen i was thinking mine how that sons of god are supposed to have the power of god how many believe that jesus had the power of god and let me tell you something how many brother bran i mean our age was the example he had the power of god like we haven't seen in any other age he was surrendered to god i believe he was in the image of god he was so much in the image of god until people began to wonder whether he was jesus or not but their minds were a little twisted when you think a man like that that's born of sexual desire is jesus but they did the same thing with john the baptist said are you him he had to say no i'm not that's what the prophet said no i'm not i wonder brothers and sisters how much people see jesus in us amen so talk about the power of god he had the power and favor of god with him until he could walk on water if the need rose amen he had the power over the elements the prophet of god in our day how many knows he had power on the mountain just that the storm was going to just blind him and bring him in and and he was barely going to make it back down the hill and the holy spirit says turn around and go back up the mountain he said who is that speaking to me because he couldn't hardly believe it all right no doubt the prophet had heard that voice many times it to me you would think well he would catch on yeah that voice listened to it but he wanted to make sure is that you speaking to me and he said yes go back up go back up had to tell him several times but he went right back up the mountain up up back the wrong way and he was there while i'm here and the holy spirit said speak to the storm amen folks when it comes to speaking mountains out of existence when it gets when it comes to moving mountains and having faith to move mountains and doing all that i don't know that brother adam ever did that one time outside of god telling him first i mean he believes you have to do nothing until the father shows you first because if you do it yourself you're probably going to be disappointed but when the father's told him speak to it and he says let it quit snowing let the sun shine for three days come back off the mountain they said man it was a huge storm coming i imagine it covered several states probably don't you i mean when they looked at the radar and then they say that it just mysteriously it just went away the prophet knew why because he had spoken out of existence amen told us what to do amen i'm thankful to have had that in this generation can i say something if we would go on another 500 years every church in the world would be talking about what happened in brother branham's ministry what god did in that manner's ministry they finally catch on am i right because just like the pharisees they talk about moses and so forth but it was always later on the catholics they bury you know they took up the bones of those priests that burnt joanne of arc you know and proclaimed her a saint so much later but it was too late then amen aren't you glad you catch it now see what god has done now in our generation because if you miss him if you miss what god is doing in front of you you missed it you missed god and the thing of it is god does it in such simple simple way such humble way that you have to look down and get way down humble to be able to catch it and to see it and let me tell you something there's a mania many a preacher that had a phd that rebuked brother branham you need to go back to grammar school you don't say how i don't know if it was all men you don't say amen you say ah amen you learn how to talk right you need to go talk right the brother baby says he pushed me just a little bit too much he says well i'm giving thousands to the lord millions are being delivered of sicknesses and diseases with my bad grammar what are you doing he wasn't doing much at all probably he had i'll tell you this he was way out of his place to correct god's prophet try to tell him you need to if god wanted him to have a good grammar school education he'd seen to it that he got it amen but it wasn't about the grammar school he needed that bad grammar to throw people off that thought they were so highfalutin and so much better than everybody else it was the power of god that mattered he says them people that i preach to don't care if you i say amen or all men it was pulpit wasn't it it was pulpit that's what it was pulpit or pulpit you know it's just a simple little you know maybe you're from indiana or maybe you're from florida i don't know we all talk a little different you know but anyway aren't you glad for the simplicity of god amen had the power of god to walk on water or the curse of fig tree or create fish and bread and that right he multiplied the fish and the loaves amen now i'm never ashamed to say that god told the prophet of god he says tell speak and your squirrel says you're hunting into existence speak where they'll be and brother brown he says okay let one come up out of here and go over a branch and a tree that they don't climb on and never on that kind of a tree come up there and stick that that y right there the other one go up here stitch this one this one over there hey you might get half one right per chance right you might say that no wow here comes a squirrel he goes up there and stops but when he's three four five times nah i don't think so gotta be god right of course he's gotta be god in the first place but anybody would want to be a critic then they had the power to speak into existence why then we have to ask ourselves because how many knows they called the children of the prophets we call us ourselves the children of the prophet i call myself a child of the prophet and they're right because i follow the prophet brother bram says you're my children i have begotten you to christ amen i'm not ashamed of it one bit no because he already seen all those redeemed over there that came in under that ministry amen so we ask ourselves tonight on this wednesday night as we come to another one less service that we're going to have makes you want to it just how it'll be but it'll be maybe i'll still be up there when the shutters down i don't know but it's coming all of those things is prophesied folks it's coming remember brother braham said mark it down with a iron pen on a steel mountain or something like that that these things are going to happen they're coming images of christ brother branham at the end of it he says brother he said america and then he said not just this nation but he said all nations they're done they're finished it's time for another one a kingdom that shall never end how many wants to be in part of that kingdom how many wants to be in the image of christ how many would say lord continue to work on me lord let me read my bible let me look at the perfect masterpiece and that's jesus christ brother branham he was a masterpiece he was he was he was very much in the image of christ but he's not the perfect masterpiece christ is the only perfect masterpiece brother ma'am still got to tell you and confess to you about his lies and their right about his disobedience in africa cost him years of hardship and so forth he was human but for a human that had a lot of mistakes he reflected christ greatly more than anybody else in this generation but you got to remember that example and that ministry was for who me it was for you it was for this time it's to give us strength for what we're facing for what's coming it was to mold us it was to shape us into the image of christ that's what god predestinated us to be that's to be the image of christ because god is how many believes god is coming for a masterpiece he's coming for a masterpiece he's coming for one without spot and without wrinkle husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word then he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish just like christ every day that is our hearts desires lord make me more like you don't you realize that's romans 8 28 calling out that's calling out to you you want to be in that image you want to be more like christ that's that predestinated seed wanting to be more like christ peter says looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace peace how many loves that word because if you have peace with god you are in a beautiful place a peace with god found of him in peace without spot and blameless make everything right every night before you go to bed right that's how you stay without spot without wrinkle confessing all your faults so when he comes at midnight or three o'clock in the morning you said your prayers you've made everything right you're washed by the blood of jesus christ and ready for him stand with me if tonight if you would with our heads bowed how many raise your hand say lord i am not in the image that i want to be not as close to the image of christ as i want to be lord and i'm raising my hand i confess lord i'm guilty and i'm sorry lord and i want to be more like you lord jesus i am predestinated lord you're calling me tonight to be more like you to be in the image of jesus christ to have the power of god to overcome all temptation to overcome sin to overcome everything lord and we know by your grace we will lord we ask god tonight that you would help us lord jesus that when people mention our name the image that'll pop in their mind is they've been with christ oh yeah that person yeah he's a christian i'll tell you what i had this dealing with him over here and and i'll tell you what i i couldn't believe it but i could tell by his transaction the business transaction that he was a christian lord help us to be able to have that in every one of our lives lord jesus that whatever we're doing wherever we are we're reflecting you and that image is portrayed lord and if we ever would lay in a casket whenever we would lay their god the people looking at us lord would say that person loved the lord they were a christian not have to lay there and say think well he was not well i'll tell you what and all these other thoughts lord help us we want to be right with you and we want to portray to this world the image that you have called us to be in lord forgive us where we're not father every hand that is up right now lord i ask god for forgiveness grace that we would go lord jesus from this place lord jesus and after tonight lord we would begin to say lord i want to have the kind of fellowship that adam had before the fall i want to have a deeper fellowship with you lord a deeper relationship with you lord i want more of the power of god in my life lord help me to have my priorities right lord we ask god that you'll do that to a heart in every hand and those out on the airwaves lord jesus may they at this time also i hope they're praying i hope they have their heads bowed and saying the same thing in unison saying god that's what i really want i want to be in your image the sisters they'll portray christ the brothers they'll portray christ whoever we are whatever we're doing lord it'll reflect the image of christ we ask these blessings and favors now in jesus christ's name amen and amen [Music] oh let me be pleasing to you [Music] let everything that i do [Music] be pleasing to you or i'm free
