for and just sometimes i say lord i try every day to thank him for his goodness and his mercy and you know i find myself sometimes thinking and you know what the devil robs us of the most and brother thomas when we come to the back we prayed and he said you know this is something brother branham said you could never do too much he said you could sing too much you could talk too much but he said you could never pray too much and you know that's what the enemy wants is to take our prayer life away and i said lord help me to pray and when i do help me to be thankful not always ask but be thankful for what you've done for the strength and health and a lot of people would say well why do you thank the lord for good health you have all these problems that's just little things in god's way i'm going to a body that don't have no problems brother glenn that's why i can say thank you lord and just keep believing and i heard brother branham say the other day he said don't give up no matter what you keep confessing that god's healed you and so tonight i'm confessing more and more lord i thank you for your healing tonight amen and i believe we have to do it if there's anybody that likes to beat us up it's ourself because we don't do certain things but i said lord just make me more like you tonight is that your heart's desire and man i pray the lord will just come and speak to our hearts tonight and just walk up and down the house and let's sing that little song as brother thomas comes fill my cup lord and i may want your cup filled tonight amen oh feel my cup lord [Music]

weather more you know yeah yeah it affects you more amen you appreciate it more amen praise the lord god bless you tonight god is good isn't he amen so we just greet you in the name of the lord i can't think of any announcements or anything amen so let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again grateful lord jesus to be assembled lord jesus with father the purchase of your blood lord those out of billions and millions of people that truly love you with all their heart father and want to completely surrender to you lord jesus and let you lead them and guide them father and we just desire tonight that you'll have your wonderful way lord jesus in the service we come in the name of jesus christ believing god that wherever we gather in your name there you'll be in the midst knowing you're here with us lord jesus even in us lord to the end of the age we ask now father that you just bless meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon a heart to minister on we ask god your blessings and favors in jesus christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of psalms 23 a very familiar scripture psalms 23 and i think i may want to try to read about four scriptures just to lay our foundation about four scriptures one is in psalms 23. amen verse 4 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and i staff they comfort me turn over to the book of joshua the first chapter if you would joshua 1. and i want to read 5 6 and 7 and also 9 5 6 and 7 and then 9 and there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life and as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and have a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide the inherit for inheritance to land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all of the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prother prosper whither ever so i thou goest verse 9 for have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee with whether so ever thou goest amen we're going to stop there and let you be seated amen and i want to talk about courage tonight would that be okay let's talk about courage there's another aspect that's as much of this as i've been gathering going over and so forth about the lord and his commandments so forth you know i would just meditate on the lord and this word came to me about courage you know and how that courage has uh such a major bearing in our life amen you know the other word i guess opposite of courage would be coward either have courage or you're a coward one or the other amen to not have courages to be afraid is to be scared amen and i want to read uh i'm going to read now philippians 1 i want to read this yet philippians and we're going to look at paul here for a minute philippians 1 and verse 2 beginning with 20 it says according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed amen but that with all boldness right how many knows that's what courage is it's boldness that's what paul's saying here with all boldness as always so now also christ may be magnified in my body whether it be in life or whether it being death for me to live is christ and to die is gain praise the lord romans 1 and 16. romans 1. i'm trying to think but i believe there's a scripture somewhere about jesus talking about if you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you and that right so a lot of times cowardness and uh and so forth has to do with being ashamed you know and especially when it comes to christ people are ashamed to confess him and so forth okay chapter one and let me see here 1-16 romans 1-16 paul says it this way all right for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also unto the greek amen so we see here paul talking about being ashamed he wasn't afraid he had no fear i mean those paul did not hesitate to stand up uh you know in whenever he was taken captive and so forth and certain gates certain places he was never ashamed of what he had been ashamed of before now we look we know that of course our fear and our scaredness and so forth our cowardice came after the fall amen there was a time when adam wasn't afraid of anything not right but after the fall we find that adam would begin to hide himself in the uh you know behind the trees and so forth you know in the in the garden and he was scared when he heard the voice of the lord isn't that right and then something that's the first place that fear came into the human race when man was separated from god when he had actually uh committed sin and fell from grace and so forth and he was away from god away from fellowship now fear set in you know and people might not think that they're you know that they were that they're scared but you know even brother bam said that our americans even americans are scared that right and how you can tell it's like a a young man that is going by a graveyard perhaps and he'll whistle you know i'll never forget we had a graveyard close to where i was born and raised and as i was growing up i would be scared to come up over this one hill right beside the woods and come up over this hill and in these woods there was a graveyard i remember making all talking or making all kinds of noise doing just what he said because you know i was just letting everybody out there know i am not scared you know and you know you know the truth of it there is you're making noises because you are scared you know and he says that's it that's how america is with all of these uh uh people what do you call them comedians and all of these jokes and everybody's laughing it has comedy and just everything to laugh everything's a joke he says all that is is you know going by a graveyard whistling because they know they got it coming they know they got it coming you know you know there's a god and i don't care who it is every man amen that is born of a woman and so forth born in sin they have that fear in them their word they're scared people are scared people are worried and they have right reason to be you know why they're worried because in their minds they know for the most part they know there's a god god made us that intelligent you know the cows may not know the horses may not know all the animals they may not know that there's a god but human beings know that there's a god now brother bam said that religion means a covering and that's why you'll find that in whether it was the indians or whether it's down in south africa wherever you go you find even the heathens are worshiping something in that right because they know that there's a god somewhere and they have this thing in them and they'll do all kinds of things to try to cover that scarce cover that fear up amen and we find it here in america think about it you know how many people know that the church they're going to is not right but they'll keep going because they're worried they want to cover up they want to go to church on sunday just to make themselves feel a little better and people on the other hand they get so busy with doing all kinds of things so they never sit down and like david said to meditate you know as i thought on my ways you know if people would begin to just think a little bit it would be scary think about it it would be scary if people would just begin to think about what they're doing where are they going to end that up at what's going to happen their lives i don't care if it's hollywood i don't care any of they all know they're coming down to that door of death amen they know that but tonight i am thankful aren't you thankful to know that you don't have to be scared jesus told me he told everybody he told moses that to be courageous have some courage don't be afraid how many times he said fear not and then what he said when when they woke him up on the scene he says fear not i am with you another all over the place over in the book of revelations he told john fear not i am the first and the last and i have the keys of death in hell and uh to think about it all the way down even it is even that we're even at a place where you don't have to be scared of death itself honestly for that you ain't got a thing to be scared about if you're a christian but that's if you are a christian you have absolutely nothing not even death itself didn't the prophet say ever since that he went over beyond the curtain of time he has never feared death amen you know and i may not have went beyond the curtain of time and seen all that but i believe that prophet i believe he was there i believe he saw those people and therefore i believe that i can be a beneficiary of that same fearlessness that i don't have to be afraid of death because i know what's over there didn't better damn say he says you know in his younger days he also also and i've seen it i've seen it on tape i've seen it in the quotes where he says you know now you won't be able to shake each other's hand you know and so forth because he says youth were like a cloud and he didn't know for sure just you know how we're going to be able to hug each other or shake hands or anything you know and and that's what it kind of kind of what it conveys because we're just a ghost but you know later on after that he realized no you do touch you do feel is they are real is what he said just beyond that last breath amen he's the most glorious place you could ever know amen my we think about the great heroes of the bible the great things that they did right how fearless they were right now the first scripture we read he says though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death david said now there are some things i'm scared of did he say that no david said i will fear no evil david had gotten the place he wasn't scared of any evil amen because no doubt he's had the experience with the lord and having slain a bear right and slaying a lion that was his enemy took his sheep and he says give me back my sheep he went and guarded from that bear went and got it from that lie and killed that lion let me ask you something let me just make the statement a true believer has the courage of a lion did you ever see lions on top of hippopotamuses and they'll get on top of a giraffe if they can they don't care what it is they think they're the biggest and the baddest in all of the jungle huh you're just about afraid of nothing and that's the way david was david you know he said i will fear no evil for what thou art with me and that makes the difference three things i want you to notice that makes a man fearless faith right faith and love there's another thing that actually brings you into a place of fearlessness and i i'll say this because i believe it's in fellowship fellowship with christ when i begin to think about courage even in our modern day we know george washington what did the prophet say he prayed all night before he got on that water went over there they attacked the enemy they had been defeated time and time and time again and that was one of our first big victories after somebody prayed all night how about daniel he prayed three times a day prayer will bring you to fearlessness i mean please it's about that fellowship that you have daniel that he wasn't afraid of those lions the three hebrew children they become fearless because of their relationship with almighty god they were so bold they didn't uh go up there and say well now we apologize for saying this king but no they said cake we are not careful about how we talk to you about this oh my he uh had a good way of putting it he says you know it puts me in mind of something that i was telling to people the other day he says i was getting to the spot to where i need more faith that's why i'm home for now and so forth god so looks like that when we pray for people that you apologize you say mr devil would you please just move over and get out of here please he said no nothing like that face got muscles and hair on his chest amen when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in there and apologize for this and apologize for that faith don't apologize faith makes it so it's not a wishbone it's got hair on each other it's muscle little oh my what did it do to goliath who is the bigger man that he was the little silly little bitty fellow he didn't look like the bigger man but he was the bigger man did he go up there and say now mr goliath i'm sorry that i got to do this to you no first the goliath took looked at david right and he threatened him he told him what he was going to do then david said yeah you come to me with a sword and a spear you know but that ain't nothing all right that ain't no it going it isn't going to help you any today because i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts he knew what it was like to have god on his side how many sad to have god on your side you ain't got to be afraid of nothing when you've got god on your side you are an invincible oh my isn't that what the problem of god said when you realize where you are you'll be an invincible army you're an invincible person if you've got god on your side you don't need a big great army oh my all you need is god moses found that out he didn't need any of the children in israel to rise up and rebel huh now i want all of you these rights to join me and tomorrow we're going to rebel and we're going to get sticks and saves we're going to get you know spears where we can we're going to no he didn't need any help it was just him and god went into pharaoh and guess what like believing the prophet said you know you didn't go down the fair and say would you please let my people go we've been down here doing this long enough no he says i tell you phil let my people go in the face of pharaoh would have the ability in a human way of thinking he'd have the ability to have him killed instantly huh but what i love about god is that he can go into anybody's mind and he can make him think how they need to think isn't that right i was shocked the other day when i when i read that about in deuteronomy where all the kings and all of them rose up they said that the army was like the sand of the sea and then later it says god put it in their minds to fight him because he was going to punish him for what they had done you see did you ever wonder why god would take and tell seoul to go down into the philistines into the army and so forth and go into a certain city and kill every man woman and baby take the babies and smash their heads up against the wall huh that's right genocide take the whole thing out you don't know how many times god dealt with them people isn't that right god knows he's god he's a just god i never questioned god but that's what it said with all these armies god was going in there and he was he he made them put it in their heart put it in their minds to do it even the bible says that he hardened pharaoh's heart to not let him go so there'd be more fleas more fires more everything all the way down to the firstborn being killed amen so how many glad to have a god that can take and make your enemy think the way that he wants them to think you've got nothing to worry about i don't care if it's a business deal i don't care if it's a job i don't care what it is god open source god closes doors when you're in god's care he watches out for you you've got no wonder jesus kept telling don't fear he even told his desire fear not what man can do to your body they may be able to burn you at the stake feed you like don't worry about what they can do to the body you worry about him that can kill both body and soul in hell fear him fear him that's the one to fear but in the new testament how many knows the disciples and everybody they were up in the other room and they were scared that maybe they were going to get dragged out too and and so forth but after the holy ghost came after the holy ghost came they became brave they became didn't they don't work cowards anymore listen how many of those brother that god hates a coward even brother bound that he don't like a coward somebody is always scared to do anything oh my is that all right oh that's right listen i admired that eagle because he was brave i do not like a coward they come to church and they act like christians then they go out in the streets and they don't even testify of jesus hear sinful men cursing and afraid to call them down for that uh now you know what to do when somebody curses how many know sometimes you just let it go sometimes you're better off maybe but when the holy spirit tells you to say something you say something i don't appreciate you using my lord's name and name like that huh god can't use a man like that he's got to have somebody that's brave how many believes that why do you think that's why uh god kept telling joshua don't be a coward don't don't be a coward be courageous amen another place for the bible says he read an old proverb or an old quote he says a coward dies 10 000 deaths when a hero never dies the coward's always scared running from every little thing as we would call it afraid of every little shadow and so forth but he says that's the way that's the way with the man who comes and professes that he has faith and is spooked at every little scarecrow devil that can put before him oh my he thinks i'm not any better after getting paid for i just don't i don't feel as well as i did yesterday what difference does it make if you've got real faith in your heart god's gonna keep his word all the hurts all the eggs all the pace all the shadows cannot amount to anything because you believe it with all of your heart i mean those symptoms are the worst thing for us a lot of times our worst enemy is the symptoms that we have after we get prayed for after we try to believe everything will go wrong we can't think we can't go wrong but don't be a coward another place he says you know god give you a checkbook to sign whatsoever things you ask in my name i will do it he says but are you afraid to fill it out don't be a coward god is more than willing to give it to you amen oh my praise the lord so we look we look at these men of the bible how many knows that faith the way that we faith comes by hearing right hearing the word of god like joshua like david amen not afraid to go up there and face that big life not afraid of the bear no fear there to me not to not be afraid what oh what a wonderful thing not afraid of hell not afraid of dying why because you have a fellowship with almighty god how many is glad for that tonight i certainly am we're living in a world brothers and sisters that you aren't really you can't you can't really not be afraid unless you are a child of god unless you are born again of the spirit i believe it says those that do wrong and sin he says there's a fearful looking for of the judgments and the wrath of almighty god they fear they're scared why do you think people are doing and acting the way they do amen listen to what i wanted to read a quote that you're really not right you're not right in your spirit you're not right as far as fear or any of those concerns now now they say too much religion will make you crazy you know we people have been told that don't read too much of that bible you know you'll get confused don't read too much bible it'll make you crazy huh too much of the wrong thing is what will make you crazy but the religion of jesus christ if you are crazy it'll put you in your right mind i mean these christ brings us back to the state that adam was see but you're not right until you're born again you're not mentally right until you are born again how many believe that you can't even think right unless you got the holy ghost folks i'll tell you what just get away from the holy ghost you lose your temper right it's temporary insanity you know when you get mad it's temporary insanity that's right you don't think what you ought to think you don't say what you ought to say you don't act like you are that the second you lose your temper because you can't lose the temper until the holy ghost first because it ain't the holy ghost and all that come on folks man is not right unless the holy ghost is there and i got to thinking about the conditions that our world's in a man is not in his right condition also he says until he's born again he's a beast at his heart isn't it something folks that 75 years i guess right around 75 76 77 years i think it was around 1945 that was the end of the second world war 75 years later we're still slaughtering each other civilization modern civilization i don't know if you watch the news or not but i've watched some of that uh ukrainian and so forth and see these old grandmas going out there with a big bag all they can carry and somebody on the other side trying to get them there's a big guard rail just like they have a guard rail you know and she can't get over it so she crawls under the guard we've got grandmas running for their life having to crawl on the guardrails mama's with their babies strollers are left people getting slaughtered left and right why because i don't care if it's america or if it's russia they're not born again they're still a beast in their heart they can still do those type of things they're capable of those type of things if they're not born again huh you think civilized what did let him say about civilization there's nothing there's gonna be a civilization that's not civilized that's not civilized is it war is not civilized and i know how many knows america ain't got much to say we've been fighting all along we're just as bad that's right amen but not in his right condition the world is not why can't how can we expect anything else blood test how many know if there's war it's going to be wars and rumors of wars all the way to the end because see people are brute they're beasts amen they have no fear of god in their lives they're not born again but i'm glad for the grace of almighty god aren't you how many know that paul paul at one time he was ashamed of christ he persecuted christ and everybody that claimed to be a christian and then god or the lord jesus christ struck him down on the road to damascus and said he was great set him straight and what it must have been for paul to begin to testify because really what my focus is tonight is that we should be less ashamed to testify of the lord jesus christ because let christ come and do something in your life let him do something in your life i guarantee you you won't be ashamed ever since i got born again i wanted to tell the world of how good christ is and what it's really all about not a shame that's right just to tell just you want to share you want to tell the world and it gives you that courage to do so let's look at a couple cowards for a few minutes people who were religious cowards one of them was nicodemus right he was a christian and he wanted to talk with jesus and no doubt he wanted to you know have a conversation with him but when did he go to when did he go see him at night in private folks if you're a christian you know you're not a private christian but he went at night to talk to jesus and so forth at least he did that much right but he came to at night he was ashamed he was saying to them the other one is that family that couple whose son was healed jesus you know laid his hands on him and he was completely healed when the pharisees come down and put pressure on him to say who is it that healed him because anybody that confessed christ during that time was excommunicated and what did they say they said he is of age ask him because say they were cowards they didn't want to be excommunicated and i've said before my goodness if my son was blind that whole time wouldn't you want to say i'll tell you and i ain't careful about how i'm telling you this i'm here to tell you this guy that y'all hate so much that's who it was his name is jesus christ i wouldn't be ashamed with you no you wouldn't want to be but yet they were ashamed they were not 150 committed my they were ashamed praise be to god you know and many times this bravery this having this courage that comes with the holy ghost can get you killed huh i mean it was down in the dark ages in the catacombs of rome when those people would be hiding down there hey if they wanted to just end it they come up and they confess they're a christian am i right and they'd have to give their lives 68 million that were not cowards they were not cowards they gave their life because of their courage amen how many believes we got to be bold paul said pray for me that i can that i'll be bold to speak what jesus has done so is it in this day when it comes to the message of the hour there's a lot of people that just kind of keep it quiet just kind of come around the edges of it well we can't believe no not just kind of i believe he was a prophet of god i believe jesus christ manifested himself through him like in no other age amen praise the lord think about it think about those who are so bold and john the baptist let's start with john the baptist john the baptist was one that was he he wasn't he wasn't afraid he was in prison how many remembers he was in prison and he came out before herod i believe it was and as the prophet of god said the lie everybody was saying don't say nothing don't say that don't preach on marriage and divorce now because he was married to his brother philip's wife and it wasn't lawful and what was it right in front of all of them john the baptist went up and said it's not lawful for you to have her and i don't remember just who it was it was uh there was another there was another woman to remember and it was i wish i would never remember i should have studied just suddenly a little bit closer but i forget just who it was it was a a woman and he got to dance with her daughter and she asked for her he said give ask for whatever she wants for her i guess to the half of the kingdom and she asked he said will you give it he said yeah i'll give it to you because of that woman she says i want the head about john the baptist and he went and chopped his head off so his courage got his head chopped off amen paul i mean knows paul because of his courage and boldness and not being ashamed ended up costing him his head right that's how job i mean paul was decapitated his head cut off peter he was brave he was bold i believe it was in uh acts of i'm not sure which chapter i've got it here even maybe we'll go to this one but in acts 4 and 13 says it this way after peter said neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus how many know it's outside you'll never i mean you'll never be the same you're still looking at the effects brother tommy we're still looking at the effects of somebody that's met the lord jesus christ and it has changed my life forever to my dying day i will be a different person to my dying day i won't be ashamed of the gospel of christ amen and peter they had take knowledge of him that they had been with jesus so peter had boldness and what was he but crucified what upside down you know maybe i get to know peter a little bit more but he was one of these outspoken guys wasn't he he'd stick his foot in his mouth more times and he was it was good for him that right because he says you know thou shalt never go and be crucified and so forth he says get thee behind me satan thou savior is not the things that be of god foot washing he says you know don't just wash my you will never wash my feet you're the you're the you're the king you know and when you i ain't gonna wash you're not gonna wash my feet then he says if i don't watch it no you're not [Music] peter and his last breath was the same way he says well he was he was crucified straight up do me upside down huh but jesus loved him didn't he he loved the character of peter he was a different character but god loved him he says christmas crucify me upside down and they did from what i understand amen gave his life like that song you know they gave their life's blood so that this god's book could shine it's dripping with blood it's dripping with blood this holy ghost gospel it's dripping with blood brother brahm said he had dave had a gun on his sided on him and that right he didn't but he said he wasn't worried i'm not scared he wasn't worried he would gladly die he'd gladly die for the gospel's sake and he knows it's one thing they're not going to pull that trigger you're not going to pull the trigger unless they get permission first and that's from their headquarters from my headquarters isn't that right aren't you glad that the devil can't touch you until he gets permission first aren't you glad that no matter what happens no matter what trial you have it has to have permission before it comes upon you so that no matter what evil no matter what comes you don't have to be afraid i will never be afraid god is my rock god is my refuge let me please that will never be i have to be afraid you never have to fear amen i'm glad for that aren't you praise be to god that you don't have to be afraid as long as you know jesus christ amen another thing that really that's through faith let's talk about love for just a little bit sometimes people mistake courage for love in other words they think it's courage when it's love it's not really courage yet it is how about in army in the military brother bryan would probably know this as well as anybody but from what i understand the bad thing that happens a lot of time is in a military is it's called a unit right a group of men group of people that get to know each other and they get each other's back they fight for each other they fight to keep each other alive and if you love your unit if you love those on your unit guess what this let's say especially i believe it was a story brother daryl told many times and talking about being in the army and and what a man getting hit out there he was out there in an open fire and he was down and one of them says i'm going to get him they said no you can't go out there no you can't go out there i'm going out there huh and he went out there and grabbed him and come back and says drop him dropped him he's too heavy he's too heavy he says no he's not too heavy he's my brother see with so much love his love for his family it's love for your unit it's love for your brothers and sisters that gives you courage amen but it's love how many knows love is more powerful than anything more powerful that's why paul said you know it's maybe not not so much courage as it is love he said what shall separate us from the love of god so tribulation persecution famine sword peril huh what's going to separate us it's not so much love but love produces it just gives you courage it's just there with it but it's love that it's the main force you all remember the story of the mother and the child the daughter that came back from college i believe it was and she was ashamed to show her friend her mom because her mom's face was terribly ugly y'all remember that and the train conductor after they got off and she was trying to shy away from mom right acting like she didn't know herself she just grabbed her by the arm and gave her what for isn't that right oh my told her you know i remember when your mom was twice as pretty as you are and when you was young when you was just a baby and the house was on fire and your mama to save you she loved you she went up through the flames through that fire came back completely and ended up disfiguring her but that baby lived how could that daughter ever be ashamed of her mom folks i don't know about you but that girl should have long before they ever came to a stop with that railroad she should have told her the story of her awesome greatest mother in the world so that when they got there the daughter says oh my goodness that is a hero right there look she did that for you go up to and shake her hand god bless you may you have a long life for loving your daughter that much i wish i had a mom like that huh so how many believes it's the love of god in the heart that pushes us that drives us that makes us not ashamed of the gospel gives us courage to witness other people around us about what god has done how many here will admit be honest that you've held back a lot of times when something in your heart said you should have spoke you should have given him a book brother branham's main main question to people was are you a christian why because he was concerned are you a christian are you a christian concerned about whether people are a christian or not his main concern was not to be afraid but look at an angle to be able to witness the people he said whether he's a picking pig farmer or a chicken farmer right or the atheist living up on the hill talk about the apple tree any way to try to witness to them and try to lead somebody to christ lord help us tonight to give us bravery give us courage not to be ashamed to reach out there and and put it out there and say jesus loves you god has said as a prophet in this generation i myself repent tonight say god help me there's many times that i've neglect that i haven't you know witnessed when i should have when i could it would it came into my mind you know maybe you should ask maybe you should tell that person about it i believe you have to be divinely led i do that but at the same time we need to have courage and not hold back amen because i believe we are the light of the world we are those that are supposed to be the witness to this world amen you think about all those who ended up it ended up costing their life i'll tell you this the homosexuals and all of them people they're not ashamed are they when they ought to be ashamed isn't that something how in president clinton's presidency how they really opened up the doors if i'm not wrong they said they could be in the military but they couldn't tell that they were and no don't don't tell don't ask don't tell policy i think it was clean either clinton or a reagan one of them to where now i believe the admiral or chief is i don't know what what it is it's either a homosexual or it's a transsexual one of them in our one of our highest of the military and you think that the enemy's going to be scared of us when we don't even know who we are what we are it's sad it's gone from there to our supreme court recognizing same-sex marriages boy the devil's clever isn't it how many knows it's time to get out of here folks it's time to it's getting worse all the time but the bride is getting more ready more ready how many feels like god is tuning you up like god is like coming down into the details of your life morning noon and night to make sure like daniel stay prayed up stay ready because you don't know when it's gonna happen amen the world is going to get worse and we're going to get more ready to leave here because it has to make those conditions amen everything going the way that it is it's just the fulfilling of scriptures amen you love him god bless you stand with me tonight if you will musicians if you'll come with our heads bowed let's go before the lord now i'm going to ask you i already did but i want to ask you again how many would just want to have more courage to be a witness for the lord jesus christ lord give me more courage lord don't let me hold back lord don't let me be ashamed of you or to call myself a christian or tell somebody hey if when they ask you to do something you shouldn't say no i'm a christian i don't do that are you a christian just to be more brave more bold for the gospel in this hour that we're living for it's time to let our light shine god bless all of those hands lord jesus we raise our hands to you tonight believe in god that we need to be bolder lord to spread this gospel paul he'd stand up and amidst the vulum and preach the gospel so did peter stand up and witness a man of the gospel of jesus christ they were not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to the jewish verse from the greek also lord help us to have that same attitude lord you're reaching out to all racists all of human humanity lord jesus and father we ask god did you help us just to reach out to our neighbor to our milk man to our mailman wherever it is lord just to try to be a witness to everybody that we can because time is short today is fast closing lord let us work while it's day for the night is coming we ask god to help us to be better workers for you in the name of jesus christ amen and amen i like that song because he lives i can face tomorrow
