[27:26] morning everybody
[27:30] as y'all can tell we've got some work in
[27:33] progress going on out by the Pavilion
[27:36] and
[27:38] everything uh we've got some new rock
[27:41] out there which praise the lord we got
[27:45] it a month ahead of the meetings but
[27:48] either way what we're going to try to do
[27:50] and what I would like for you to
[27:54] do is nobody go out there today uh
[27:59] walking through the rock brings the dust
[28:03] back in here takes it down to the
[28:05] fellowship building so it makes a pretty
[28:09] large extra cleanup so let's just stay
[28:14] off of that area the basketball court
[28:18] has also got a reinforcement wire on it
[28:22] and some uh rebaring stuff so don't even
[28:26] go over there
[28:28] I guess the only safe thing you could do
[28:30] is play volleyball but if you do that
[28:34] you need to walk in the grass do not get
[28:36] on the Rock
[28:40] okay everybody dear headlight look
[28:44] yeah okay all right I don't brother
[28:48] Steve don't like repeating himself so
[28:50] I'm I'm just trying to get everybody
[28:51] here all at one
[28:53] time and then also
[28:58] you see the tape on the
[29:00] floor
[29:01] U don't be picking it up it's there for
[29:05] a reason we're going to try to change
[29:07] these lights out and that helps us to
[29:10] put the benches
[29:13] back so I'm sure I'm I'm struggling here
[29:16] trying to remember
[29:19] okay
[29:21] uh ping pong
[29:23] table it's folded up in the corner we're
[29:27] not going to play
[29:29] pingpong on carry and
[29:31] Sunday because of
[29:34] food and everything and the way our time
[29:37] schedule runs we don't need to be
[29:40] worried about getting the ball out of
[29:41] the food and doing all that so we're
[29:44] good with that everybody understand
[29:46] that okay all
[29:50] right
[29:51] uh I want to cover gum chewing in the
[29:56] sanctuary that's getting a little bit
[29:58] out of hand so we need to back down on
[30:01] that and then talking out in the
[30:04] forer and Lolly gagging around out there
[30:08] before
[30:09] service what I mean by that is
[30:14] anytime 30
[30:16] minutes before service and prior
[30:20] to you need to be in here getting ready
[30:24] for service okay hey you know I'll take
[30:28] the blame on this I shouldn't have let
[30:31] it get like it's gotten but I know
[30:33] sometime people like to stand out there
[30:35] and visit with me and brother William as
[30:38] we're doing the door
[30:41] uh and it's gotten out of hand so we
[30:44] need to back back down on it when you
[30:47] come in if you have to go to the
[30:50] bathroom that's fine I mean that's what
[30:52] they're there for get your business took
[30:54] care of come on in the sanctuary and get
[30:57] ready for service
[30:59] it's
[31:01] uh the rules that we go by here is
[31:05] basically how brother brandham set him
[31:07] up I can I can take you
[31:11] to uh to how you had things set up there
[31:14] at the
[31:15] Tabernacle and that's how he
[31:18] felt and that would be pleasing and how
[31:23] he wanted things set up for the
[31:25] people and I think you'll profit from
[31:28] if you'll if you'll get in here and sit
[31:30] down and get ready for service you'll
[31:33] profit for you know so it's not just
[31:36] rules and
[31:38] regulations it's it's for
[31:40] furtherance of of you being prepared for
[31:44] the sermon and everything
[31:46] so
[31:48] U can't really think of anything
[31:52] else brother thank you brother John okay
[31:59] uh it's been brought to my attention the
[32:04] children even on Wednesday nights

[32:10] okay
[32:12] uh y'all are running everywhere I wished
[32:15] I could uh I do good to walk everywhere

[1:19:37] jerem no wait a minute not Jeremiah hold
[1:19:39] on a
[1:19:43] minute
[1:19:49] amen Matthew I believe it is let's go to
[1:19:52] Matthew Matthew will begin
[1:20:00] 19 Matthew
[1:20:05] 19 and I want to read one verse there
[1:20:08] and then we want to jump around just a
[1:20:10] little bit and then we'll see if we can
[1:20:11] with the help of the Lord tie it all
[1:20:13] together Matthew 19 and verse 8 says
[1:20:15] said and he saith unto them Moses
[1:20:18] because of the hardness of your hearts
[1:20:21] suffered you to put away your wives but
[1:20:23] from the beginning
[1:20:25] it wasn't so amen how many knows brother
[1:20:28] Brandon preached a message called it
[1:20:30] wasn't so from the beginning Amen on
[1:20:33] Genesis 1 Genesis 1 if you want to jump
[1:20:36] over there with
[1:20:44] me amen I hope and trust with what we
[1:20:47] are going to say this morning that it'll
[1:20:50] give us a new new
[1:20:52] appreciation or a further appreciation
[1:20:54] of what God has done in our generation
[1:20:58] amen not just in our generation but I
[1:21:01] trust that we can bring it down to every
[1:21:03] individual amen because you don't want
[1:21:06] it it's not all about somebody else
[1:21:08] getting something but it's what God did
[1:21:09] for you isn't that right as an
[1:21:11] individual each one of us as individuals
[1:21:14] amen and we uh no doubt but we'll take
[1:21:18] thousands of years Amen to really try to
[1:21:21] Fathom the greatness of God and the
[1:21:23] goodness of God
[1:21:25] amen and the grace of God because it's
[1:21:27] really all him amen I was thinking this
[1:21:31] morning amen uh you know earlier this
[1:21:33] morning just looking at everything and
[1:21:35] everything that your eyes look at
[1:21:37] everything you behold amen it's all
[1:21:42] something that God has created amen and
[1:21:44] sometimes we lose our appreciation for
[1:21:46] that the Simplicity of it but I think uh
[1:21:49] St first John talked about he says and
[1:21:51] without him there was not anything made
[1:21:54] that was made made amen so whenever
[1:21:56] you've got God on the inside here you
[1:21:58] realize where all the good things come
[1:22:00] from amen like he woke you up this
[1:22:02] morning like that song says and gave
[1:22:05] food on your tables when the bills came
[1:22:07] do there he was amen how many
[1:22:09] appreciates God this morning Amen in
[1:22:12] Genesis 1 and verse 9 it says and God
[1:22:15] said let the waters under the heavens be
[1:22:17] gathered together into one
[1:22:18] place he and let the dry land appear and
[1:22:21] it was so and God called the dry land
[1:22:23] Earth and he gathered together the
[1:22:26] waters and God saw the Seas and God saw
[1:22:29] that it was good and God said let the
[1:22:32] Earth bring forth grass and a herb
[1:22:34] yielding seed and a fruit tree yielding
[1:22:38] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[1:22:41] itself upon the Earth and it was so and
[1:22:44] the Earth brought forth grath and a herb
[1:22:47] yielding seed after his kind and trees
[1:22:50] yielding fruit whose seed is in itself
[1:22:53] after his kind and God saw that it was
[1:22:55] good amen in the evening in the morning
[1:22:57] was the third day may God add His
[1:22:59] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:23:01] can be seated this morning amen I want
[1:23:04] to read a few quotes before I give you
[1:23:05] my title just to lay a little Foundation
[1:23:08] amen and this of course is out of the
[1:23:10] church age book Amen brother bandam
[1:23:12] talking about the Ephesian Church age
[1:23:14] and how that God helped him by the
[1:23:17] anointing and enabling of the Holy
[1:23:20] Spirit he seen unfolded he says a
[1:23:23] pattern that runs through centuries and
[1:23:25] right into this present last day amen
[1:23:28] and that is how to determine the
[1:23:30] messenger of each age amen and and so
[1:23:33] forth and the Church of each age amen
[1:23:35] and so he reads the scripture he says
[1:23:38] you know in Hebrews uh 13 and8 it says
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:23:44] and forever Ecclesiastes 3:14 and 15 I
[1:23:48] know that whatsoever God doeth it shall
[1:23:51] be forever nothing can be put to it nor
[1:23:54] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[1:23:58] that men should fear before him amen
[1:24:01] that which hath been is now and that
[1:24:04] which is to be has already been
[1:24:08] amen and God requireth that which is PED
[1:24:13] amen so that's kind of a that's kind of
[1:24:16] a hard saying and that which is to be
[1:24:20] has already been amen so my idon this
[1:24:24] morning with the help of the Lord is
[1:24:26] going back to the original
[1:24:29] amen amen in the future we go back to
[1:24:33] what has
[1:24:35] been
[1:24:37] amen how many know brother Bram clearly
[1:24:39] said he says we're heading heading back
[1:24:41] to the Garden need them as hard as we
[1:24:43] can but heading back there is a process
[1:24:46] isn't that right we have to go through a
[1:24:49] process because amen we find out that uh
[1:24:52] well let me just read a little more now
[1:24:54] notice here he says here it is an
[1:24:56] unchanging God with unchanging ways what
[1:25:00] he did at F at the first he will keep
[1:25:03] have to keep on doing it until it is
[1:25:06] done for the last time he says there
[1:25:08] will never be a change apply that to the
[1:25:11] church ages the kind of a man that God
[1:25:14] chose for the first age and how God
[1:25:17] manifested in that man's ministry will
[1:25:19] be the example for all other ages what
[1:25:22] God did at the first church age is what
[1:25:24] he wants to do in all other
[1:25:28] ages Amen brother BRS establishes one
[1:25:32] thing that God doesn't
[1:25:36] change whatever he
[1:25:38] does whatever he says is the
[1:25:43] original amen the original is what we
[1:25:46] want to dwell on with the little with
[1:25:47] the help of the Lord the original or and
[1:25:50] we all remember brother B preaching a
[1:25:52] message amen that he amen took about six
[1:25:54] hours to speak on and he was trying to
[1:25:56] express to the denominational systems he
[1:25:59] says you'll understand where I'm at and
[1:26:01] what I'm trying to say he you know how
[1:26:04] many know brother BR tried his best to
[1:26:06] try to get his point across of them
[1:26:07] folks and apparently he
[1:26:10] didn't because where are they at today
[1:26:13] is that right but at least he had he SED
[1:26:16] a seed amen now let me just say this the
[1:26:20] original spoken word is the Original
[1:26:22] Seed amen so we realize God's word is
[1:26:26] the original everything he does and when
[1:26:29] he had the book of Acts uh when he uh
[1:26:31] the first church that came out the first
[1:26:33] messenger of Paul that came out that was
[1:26:36] original amen that was the way that it
[1:26:39] was supposed to
[1:26:42] be amen and we have a pattern we have
[1:26:46] something because I don't know about you
[1:26:47] but I like something
[1:26:49] genuine I like something
[1:26:52] pedigree something
[1:26:56] original amen I don't like
[1:27:00] highbrid I don't like something mixed
[1:27:03] now how many knows you cannot mix the
[1:27:05] word of God and
[1:27:09] expect un
[1:27:12] hybrid
[1:27:14] uh all right let me think
[1:27:18] here an
[1:27:24] results you can't hyb something and then
[1:27:26] expect original
[1:27:28] results it's not going to be bring
[1:27:30] original socks you got to go back to the
[1:27:32] original amen if you're going to have
[1:27:35] original song Amen and
[1:27:38] results praise the
[1:27:43] Lord amen
[1:27:46] amen I love this don't you just love the
[1:27:50] word of God I'm telling you it'll put a
[1:27:52] smile on your face when you just just
[1:27:54] begin to think about
[1:27:57] it I smil this morning because we have
[1:28:00] the original
[1:28:03] again we have been restored to the
[1:28:06] original
[1:28:07] again we know a mule can never breed
[1:28:10] itself back can it no and there's only
[1:28:13] one thing because you and I as a brother
[1:28:15] Braham says you know because of Eve
[1:28:17] hting the word of God mixing Thou shalt
[1:28:21] not surely die she mixed it
[1:28:25] Ain that right now God had told them to
[1:28:27] multiply let every seed bring forth of
[1:28:29] its G kind and so forth he had told them
[1:28:32] to multiply is't that right but Eve amen
[1:28:36] she mixed it and threw us into death and
[1:28:40] now we are born
[1:28:42] hybrid now notice how he said that she
[1:28:44] was supposed to bring forth the Sons and
[1:28:46] Daughters of
[1:28:48] God without going back and pulling up
[1:28:50] all those quotes but brother bam says
[1:28:52] but God Amen continued his program
[1:28:56] anyway and you come
[1:29:03] anyway I like that because we're not
[1:29:05] some we're not some offshoot or not part
[1:29:09] of the program or not part of the plan
[1:29:12] isn't that right and we didn't come the
[1:29:14] way we were supposed to because of
[1:29:16] hybriding but we came anyway but we came
[1:29:20] in a hybrid condition not the way that
[1:29:23] we were supposed to or originally
[1:29:25] supposed to
[1:29:29] come
[1:29:32] amen but praise be to
[1:29:35] God Amen we
[1:29:37] came
[1:29:38] anyway how many glad to be
[1:29:41] here I'm glad to be here I'm glad to
[1:29:46] know who I
[1:29:48] am I think we touched on it a little bit
[1:29:51] perhaps in the last sermon talking about
[1:29:52] a a mule and a pedigree horse and just
[1:29:55] the wiing of him and so forth and how
[1:29:57] that pedigree horse knows who his mama
[1:29:59] was his grandpa was and where he come
[1:30:01] from and where he's going a mule doesn't
[1:30:03] know what he is why because well am I am
[1:30:07] I a mule or am I no actually it's a what
[1:30:10] was it a horse breed to a donkey ain't
[1:30:12] that right so he's half donkey half
[1:30:14] horse and he's like well I'm not sure
[1:30:16] which I am am I a horse or am I donkey
[1:30:19] it made me think of what brother bham
[1:30:20] said about the churches ain't that right
[1:30:23] man they don't know where they come from
[1:30:25] and what do they produce but they
[1:30:27] produce and I want to say this that be
[1:30:30] oh my here we go churches because of
[1:30:33] hybriding how many knows brother Brandon
[1:30:35] was real hard on the churches because
[1:30:37] they had hybd the word of
[1:30:40] God is't that right and It produced a
[1:30:43] bunch of a bunch of uh neurotics bunch
[1:30:46] of crazy
[1:30:48] people amen and look and we can actually
[1:30:51] blame the the flow and the
[1:30:54] uh the sin wave that came in is because
[1:30:57] that people heard the truth heard the
[1:30:59] original word and rejected the original
[1:31:02] word and accept the hybrid word
[1:31:06] instead that's why we've got people out
[1:31:08] there running around with green hair and
[1:31:10] purple hair and every other kind of hair
[1:31:13] and they've got tattoos
[1:31:15] everywhere all painted up why because
[1:31:18] the church World
[1:31:21] fell because they didn't hold the way
[1:31:24] they were supposed to do and now what
[1:31:26] what we got actually oh my brother B
[1:31:29] said you know my Ministry has gone
[1:31:31] nowhere it's they they you say my
[1:31:33] Ministry is De than any of them he says
[1:31:35] you're right all Roberts's Ministries
[1:31:38] over with pretty much Billy Grahams
[1:31:40] listen to it and the spoken word is the
[1:31:42] Original Seed he says but what has
[1:31:43] happened is amen the word has been swn
[1:31:46] denominational word has been sown and
[1:31:48] the word of God has been
[1:31:50] sown he says now you watch it's all
[1:31:53] going to produ a a
[1:31:55] crop every seed is going to bring forth
[1:31:58] of its own kind God is Not mocked
[1:32:01] whatever you sow you're going to
[1:32:06] reap oh man aren't you glad that every
[1:32:08] day you listen to the message of the
[1:32:10] hour amen you listen to amen the perfect
[1:32:13] Faith perfect love am mean you listen to
[1:32:15] the statute of a perfect man amen you're
[1:32:18] feeding on original
[1:32:22] word and it's do
[1:32:25] it's having an effect it does something
[1:32:28] for
[1:32:32] you amen they breed it with this they
[1:32:35] breed it with man's ideas and everything
[1:32:37] else and we know that Paul was the
[1:32:40] messenger he was the prophet of the hour
[1:32:42] and he had the word of the Lord he had
[1:32:44] the original
[1:32:46] word it comes how many know the original
[1:32:49] word comes to the prophets Paul had the
[1:32:51] original word and he says if anybody
[1:32:53] come and preach anything anything other
[1:32:54] than what I've preached is that right if
[1:32:56] he's an angel from heaven let him be a
[1:32:58] cursed and that's what prop Propet of
[1:33:00] God did is he came came to take us back
[1:33:03] to restore or breed us back to the
[1:33:05] original
[1:33:09] word amen let me just read a quote if I
[1:33:17] could my mission that I believe that God
[1:33:20] has called me this is out of spoken word
[1:33:23] is I have to say some personal things
[1:33:25] today because that's what I told you I
[1:33:27] do see tell the world my mission I
[1:33:29] believe to the Earth is what is to
[1:33:33] forerun the coming
[1:33:37] word see the coming word which is Christ
[1:33:40] and Christ in him has the Millennium has
[1:33:44] everything right there because he is the
[1:33:48] word then he goes to three John uh St
[1:33:52] John 35 and so forth and he says let's
[1:33:54] read the scripture Jesus answers and
[1:33:56] said unto him verily verily say unto you
[1:33:58] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:34:01] the kingdom of
[1:34:03] God we know that's what the prophet of
[1:34:05] God did what God did amen he used
[1:34:07] brother brandom to take us back to the
[1:34:10] original
[1:34:14] word back the word the way that Paul
[1:34:16] said
[1:34:18] it the way that Paul preached it and he
[1:34:21] started it with the birth is that right
[1:34:25] so the days of hybridizing and putting
[1:34:27] your name on a church book is that what
[1:34:30] Acts 2 says and they were all baptized
[1:34:32] amen joined the church put their name on
[1:34:34] the boat
[1:34:35] no did they all go into some kind of a a
[1:34:39] six Monon period where they were
[1:34:40] studying and amen and being taught what
[1:34:43] they got to do and what they know they
[1:34:44] were pricked in their hearts right
[1:34:47] straight back to acts
[1:34:49] 238 the only way to join a church or to
[1:34:51] join to Jesus Christ is to be baptized
[1:34:54] by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:34:57] there's no other
[1:34:59] way if you want original result you've
[1:35:02] got to have original word if you want to
[1:35:06] be like the early Christians word and
[1:35:08] you've got to believe it the way that
[1:35:09] they believe that you got to let it come
[1:35:12] down in here the way they had
[1:35:15] it woo
[1:35:19] Glory all right now listen to what he
[1:35:23] said what kind of man God chose for the
[1:35:25] age and I'll say this the kind of
[1:35:27] Christians they were is what we want to
[1:35:29] be ain't that right we know now exactly
[1:35:32] from the word which was recorded by the
[1:35:34] Holy Spirit how that at first or the
[1:35:37] original
[1:35:39] church amen the original church was
[1:35:42] founded in how God manifested himself in
[1:35:46] her and the word can't change or be
[1:35:48] changed because God's word can't change
[1:35:50] but he goes to uh certainly uh talking
[1:35:54] about and we probably won't go into it
[1:35:56] maybe we will let me finish this out
[1:36:00] thus what the church was at Pentecost
[1:36:03] cost was the
[1:36:05] standard that is the pattern there is no
[1:36:09] other pattern no matter what scholar
[1:36:11] says God has not changed that pattern
[1:36:15] what God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[1:36:17] on
[1:36:21] doing there it is
[1:36:24] if you'll notice that brother Randon
[1:36:27] whenever he started to even preach on on
[1:36:29] these Church ages it started at 53 ad to
[1:36:35] 170 so what happened with the first 52
[1:36:41] years from what I understand in the
[1:36:43] message it wasn't the church
[1:36:46] age they were
[1:36:48] pure they were the pure Church the way
[1:36:50] we're supposed to be huh why do you
[1:36:53] think that even after lead AA God calls
[1:36:55] us out of that lead AA age go back to
[1:36:58] the way that they were before it ever
[1:37:00] even started rolling cuz the church age
[1:37:02] the first age fell a't that right we
[1:37:06] don't want to be in no Fallen condition
[1:37:08] they had been relaxed and they had been
[1:37:10] drifting and getting away from
[1:37:13] God oh my I don't know if I should let
[1:37:15] the cat out of the bag or not should I
[1:37:17] just go ahead and tell you you know when
[1:37:19] you're close to God and when you're
[1:37:20] right where you ought to be with God
[1:37:24] you are back to where you originally
[1:37:26] were supposed to be in fellowship with
[1:37:28] almighty God but the Devil comes and he
[1:37:31] is the interruptor of your walk with
[1:37:36] God oh maybe last week go had the Seal
[1:37:39] of the Lord I felt so good but I'll tell
[1:37:40] you what I spaid and I'm not what I
[1:37:42] ought to be I'm not what I was a week
[1:37:45] ago then you're not the original the way
[1:37:48] you're supposed to
[1:37:49] be I me it takes because the Devil he's
[1:37:53] absolute Master at getting you to
[1:37:56] fall getting you away from the walk that
[1:37:59] you're supposed to have on the daily
[1:38:03] bases get you away from the original
[1:38:06] walk that you are walking with him and
[1:38:07] the Zeal that you have you ask yourself
[1:38:09] the question oh there was a time when I
[1:38:11] just had the love of God in my heart so
[1:38:13] much and then I wanted to pet every
[1:38:16] bird I just loved everybody everything
[1:38:18] was so peaceful and so wonderful in my
[1:38:20] heart but now today I'm not so much that
[1:38:24] way
[1:38:27] huh how many knows it's easy to
[1:38:29] drift got to be careful not to drift
[1:38:32] because that's what the church age did
[1:38:33] that's what they did but what they were
[1:38:35] at
[1:38:36] Pentecost is what you and I want to be
[1:38:40] amen at
[1:38:42] Pentecost acts the book of Acts
[1:38:47] amen all right listen and I I notice and
[1:38:51] what the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:38:54] inalienable right many preach on our
[1:38:58] rights and so forth but I want to take
[1:39:00] the next verse and speak On It
[1:39:04] originally very next word is her right
[1:39:08] originally she had the pure word of
[1:39:13] God how many believe that you and I got
[1:39:15] the pure word of
[1:39:19] God it's
[1:39:21] unadulterated it's proven it's
[1:39:24] Vindicated God himself backed it
[1:39:28] up how do you know cuz it's exactly what
[1:39:30] Paul
[1:39:32] said it's what the Bible
[1:39:35] says
[1:39:37] amen what she had originally what she
[1:39:40] had she had the power of the spirit
[1:39:43] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:39:46] and Gifts of the Holy
[1:39:49] Ghost amen
[1:39:53] original church was not organized by man
[1:39:56] it was led by the Holy
[1:39:59] Ghost oh man I'll tell you what I don't
[1:40:02] know what it is about human beings they
[1:40:03] like for the preacher they like for the
[1:40:05] pastor to have all of the spirit and
[1:40:07] just tell them what to do and what not
[1:40:08] to
[1:40:09] do say they're okay and everything else
[1:40:12] no it's not you have to have the Holy
[1:40:14] Ghost you've got to be led by the Holy
[1:40:17] Ghost
[1:40:21] personally if you're not you're not
[1:40:23] where you ought to
[1:40:25] be
[1:40:26] amen and the Bible talks about 12
[1:40:29] different D diversities of gifts that
[1:40:31] should be in every local body how many
[1:40:33] believe that sometime maybe we'll get
[1:40:35] into it you'd be amazed that everybody
[1:40:37] that puts their little this that
[1:40:39] together and how well it works when
[1:40:41] everybody does what they're supposed to
[1:40:43] do amen we can't all stand up here and
[1:40:47] pro preach the gospel amen we can't all
[1:40:51] be a deacon trustee or the Sunday school
[1:40:52] teacher
[1:40:54] amen we all can't be privileged to be
[1:40:55] the ones that vacuums and cleans the
[1:40:58] house
[1:40:59] hello cuz they're honored how many
[1:41:02] believe they're as honored as anybody is
[1:41:04] that's exactly right but we've got
[1:41:08] different diversities and so forth we
[1:41:09] won't get into that but listen to what
[1:41:11] he says oh my listen he says now God can
[1:41:14] never change his ways his word won't
[1:41:17] never change his word will never come
[1:41:19] back to him
[1:41:20] void how many's glad for that when you
[1:41:23] place that word in your heart it will
[1:41:25] not come back
[1:41:28] void God is going to accomplish exactly
[1:41:31] what he said and I heard him say it in
[1:41:32] this in his spoken word he says if he
[1:41:34] said he's going to have a church without
[1:41:36] spot and without wrinkle that going to
[1:41:39] tell you right now somebody's going to
[1:41:41] manifest that if there's going to be a
[1:41:44] people amen that take a body change amen
[1:41:46] somebody's going to take a body change
[1:41:48] if somebody coming to the place of
[1:41:50] perfection that they're supposed to be
[1:41:52] woo
[1:41:54] amen he didn't call me to give my life
[1:41:56] and put my head to the chopping block
[1:41:58] amen or have to fight a lion or let it
[1:42:00] or whatever it might be but God called
[1:42:02] you and I for this age amen he called
[1:42:04] you to come to the way you're supposed
[1:42:06] to come to in this
[1:42:11] hour
[1:42:12] [Applause]
[1:42:18] Glory oh my aren't you glad there's
[1:42:22] something working in your
[1:42:25] heart that's God's
[1:42:28] word amen cuz how many knows every one
[1:42:31] of us is a seed there's no seed of God
[1:42:35] that will bring forth of its kind amen
[1:42:37] and if it's sewed in the right
[1:42:39] ground but brand him explained how to
[1:42:41] you know with the Baptist and Methodist
[1:42:43] and so forth he says there's no moisture
[1:42:47] there CU it takes the moisture of the
[1:42:50] Holy Spirit isn't that right to Quicken
[1:42:52] that word they might say they believe
[1:42:55] the Bible but the days of Miracles is
[1:42:57] passed and there's no such a holy no
[1:42:58] such a thing as the Holy Ghost you just
[1:43:00] Rob the moisture out of the church amen
[1:43:04] I'll tell you what you're never going to
[1:43:05] have not anything sitting in your pews
[1:43:07] but a dead
[1:43:08] sprigs they can't say Amen they can't
[1:43:10] say hallelujah they can't say Glory
[1:43:12] because there's nothing there that's
[1:43:14] glory god be
[1:43:16] about how many believes you need the
[1:43:18] moisture of the Holy Ghost you need the
[1:43:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're ever
[1:43:22] going to our Mount to Hill beans it's
[1:43:25] what quickens that word that's in
[1:43:28] there oh I'm so glad that we've got the
[1:43:31] word amen that's going to restore us
[1:43:32] back to the original amen edting that
[1:43:35] we're going
[1:43:37] to we've got a church on we've got a
[1:43:39] word that says look Eve disbelieve one
[1:43:42] word and we've got a word says if we
[1:43:44] could not disbelieve one word and expect
[1:43:47] to go
[1:43:51] back most pre she'll say well now God
[1:43:54] don't care if you cut your hair a little
[1:43:56] bit huh H God doesn't look at your
[1:44:00] outward

[1:44:25] man's word be a line mind the
[1:44:27] truth Jesus comes along says him Heaven
[1:44:30] and Earth are pass away but my word
[1:44:32] shall never pass away he says anybody
[1:44:34] that adds one word to it but says one

[1:44:51] God I thank God God that we have once
[1:44:55] again not Luther Wesley or philosophers

[1:45:05] Lord if I've told you the truth and if
[1:45:08] God don't come back it up then you ain't
[1:45:11] got to believe it that's what he
[1:45:14] said amen and like I said
[1:45:17] before but Bram says talks about this

[1:45:44] there wo that don't do something for us
[1:45:47] who follow that I don't know what will
[1:45:50] we ain't got to back down we don't have
[1:45:51] to have one not one one little smidgen
[1:45:53] of doubt in my minds but what is the
[1:45:57] truth amen I don't care how many
[1:46:00] preachers say well he was wrong here he
[1:46:02] was wrong
[1:46:04] there just shut up
[1:46:10] already that's right because you'll
[1:46:12] never convince a Son of
[1:46:14] God not somebody that's born again cuz
[1:46:18] if you're born again you cannot sin you
[1:46:20] cannot disbelieve because your seed
[1:46:22] remains in in you how many believes that
[1:46:24] that seed in there it can't disbelieve
[1:46:27] God it'll tell the devil to shut up go
[1:46:30] fly a
[1:46:34] kite y'all know what that
[1:46:36] means amen you don't want to hear it
[1:46:40] that's
[1:46:41] right praise be to God what she was
[1:46:45] originally at Pentecost is our
[1:46:47] inalienable right amen listen he says
[1:46:53] now he says the true Messengers will be
[1:46:56] the ones that come to the closest of
[1:46:58] Paul who is free of all men sold out to
[1:47:01] God Amen ain't that right isin't that
[1:47:03] something how the prophet of God could
[1:47:04] preach here Paul a prisoner of Christ he
[1:47:07] would take a message and talk about how
[1:47:09] that Paul was a prisoner of Christ he
[1:47:12] couldn't go here he couldn't go there
[1:47:13] without the Holy Spirit leading him I
[1:47:16] mean that's our example you can't go
[1:47:19] here you can't do this that or the other
[1:47:20] unless the spirit leads you to do it
[1:47:24] amen oh
[1:47:26] my you have to work from the original he
[1:47:29] says as like beets alike the true church
[1:47:34] will always be the one that tries to
[1:47:36] follow the steps of her Founders at
[1:47:38] Pentecost and her Messengers will follow
[1:47:41] the Apostle Paul first messenger of the
[1:47:44] first church age it's that simple and it
[1:47:47] is that wonderful see Jesus came and he
[1:47:51] died that he might bring us or breed us
[1:47:53] back Hallelujah and only the blood can
[1:47:56] do
[1:47:57] that I don't care how sinful you are
[1:48:00] born in sin shap and iniquity I don't
[1:48:02] care how many bad of Sensations and
[1:48:05] everything if without the flesh am mean
[1:48:06] it's all man it's got lust and
[1:48:09] everything else in it amen it has to
[1:48:12] take the blood of Jesus Christ to wash
[1:48:16] us to clean us to restore us and give us
[1:48:22] actual
[1:48:23] a new
[1:48:25] birth that's why you got to be born
[1:48:28] again
[1:48:30] amen be born again let me just stop
[1:48:33] there and we'll pick it up again in a
[1:48:34] minute if we can
[1:48:36] remember but you
[1:48:38] know each and every one of us every
[1:48:40] person in here is different from each
[1:48:44] other I don't care if you get identical
[1:48:48] twins there will be they will have
[1:48:50] characteristic difference a't that right
[1:48:53] nobody's exactly
[1:48:55] alike is that
[1:48:57] right so each one of us is an
[1:49:03] original they just don't make him like

[1:49:27] that amazing billions and billions
[1:49:30] billions of people and nobody's
[1:49:31] fingerprint is the same I mean is God is
[1:49:34] a god of
[1:49:38] variety I hate to disillusion you but
[1:49:41] brother Bram says man if you're he makes
[1:49:42] short people he makes big people he

[1:50:05] that and they wish they could gain
[1:50:07] weight and they can't gain weight why
[1:50:09] cuz they're made a certain
[1:50:13] way amen now don't I don't believe that
[1:50:18] we're going to be fat in heaven
[1:50:22] got one amen any others can I get some
[1:50:27] more why cuz that's something that we
[1:50:30] put on ain't that right what you are at
[1:50:32] 20 Amen in the Perfection of your body

[1:50:41] you about at the age of 20 years old
[1:50:44] ain't that right in your Prime that's
[1:50:46] what God took a picture of you as some
[1:50:49] of us will have this color hair and that
[1:50:51] color hair so all I can tell is get used
[1:50:53] to it a that
[1:50:58] right you're an original I like that be
[1:51:03] yourself how many these we need to be
[1:51:05] ourself brother bam talked much about
[1:51:07] you know people trying to impersonate
[1:51:09] other people you're not original anymore
[1:51:12] impersonate this preacher sometimes
[1:51:14] preachers impersonate other preachers
[1:51:16] and this that or the
[1:51:18] other huh but Tommy if I can just find
[1:51:22] myself
[1:51:23] find what I am and how I am I can't be
[1:51:26] like Brother Brad Brother Brad can't be
[1:51:28] like me hello we got our own ways we got
[1:51:31] our own and if we try to be like each
[1:51:33] other well we're going to make a big
[1:51:34] mess out of
[1:51:36] it that's
[1:51:40] right amen praise the Lord people aren't
[1:51:45] happy with the way that God made
[1:51:47] them ain't that right I was telling my
[1:51:50] wife I said she's Hollywood Holly with
[1:51:52] people that supposed to be models and
[1:51:54] everything else and they're still not
[1:51:56] happy with the theirselves and they'll
[1:51:58] put a artificial lip balm and everything
[1:52:00] else and cheek bombs and I told her man
[1:52:02] when they get done they look like some
[1:52:04] frog or
[1:52:07] something Ribbit
[1:52:11] ribit it's scary why simply because they
[1:52:13] weren't happy with how God made them how
[1:52:16] many believe you ought to be happy with
[1:52:18] what God made be happy with
[1:52:21] yourself amen then but it's important
[1:52:23] that every person finds out what God
[1:52:26] wants him to do and how you're supposed
[1:52:28] to do and the way you're supposed to act
[1:52:30] your personality not somebody else's
[1:52:34] personality didn't even brother Brown
[1:52:36] say you get a preacher out here whatever
[1:52:38] the pastor is you know amen a lot of
[1:52:40] times the people become like their
[1:52:42] Pastor not supposed to be that
[1:52:45] way unless it's by the power of the Holy
[1:52:47] Ghost now there's one thing that we have
[1:52:49] in common that is the Holy Ghost will
[1:52:51] make us all act the same
[1:52:55] amen do you know who I how I really
[1:52:57] found out who I originally
[1:53:00] was my originality how I found my
[1:53:05] originality y'all
[1:53:07] listening how do you find your original
[1:53:10] originality I guess there is such a word
[1:53:13] hopefully if not I don't really care
[1:53:15] that's just how I am sorry about
[1:53:18] that it is when I found him ain't that
[1:53:23] right CU my identity is in him when I
[1:53:27] saw Jesus that's who I wanted to be like
[1:53:30] why because I'll tell you what you know
[1:53:32] no matter how much you try not to but if
[1:53:35] you are born of your mom and your dad
[1:53:36] you're going to have characteristics of
[1:53:38] your mom and dad cuz you've got their
[1:53:41] genetics and I've got his genetics and
[1:53:43] when I found him and I say God I don't
[1:53:45] want to be like the old Thomas B that's
[1:53:47] hybrid I want to be like you God help me
[1:53:50] to be what you've made me to be you you
[1:53:52] made me to be your son help me to be a
[1:53:54] Son of
[1:53:56] God and I live like Paul I says the life
[1:53:59] now I that I live I live not of my own
[1:54:01] it's not my life it's his life
[1:54:04] now amen it's not my faith anymore it's
[1:54:07] not my love it's his life that's what I

[1:55:07] making necessarily I'm apologizing if
[1:55:09] I'm making fun but that's that's just
[1:55:12] nothing but the crowning of the
[1:55:14] devil ain't that right don't know who
[1:55:17] they are don't know which side of the
[1:55:18] fence as the prophet of God said Bel
[1:55:20] they belong on they need the grace of
[1:55:22] God they need
[1:55:24] salvation amen it'll help you amen it'll
[1:55:27] take all of that stuff away from you but
[1:55:30] what does it
[1:55:31] do preachers behind the
[1:55:35] pulpit let them kind of people be the
[1:55:37] preacher can you imagine letting
[1:55:39] homosexual be the
[1:55:41] preacher or women huh Pentecost how
[1:55:45] going look how Pentecost drifted Ain
[1:55:47] that
[1:55:49] right Paul said it's he forbid women to
[1:55:52] speak in church and so forth not to
[1:55:55] assert authority over man but go they'
[1:55:57] hybridized it now what did he got out
[1:56:00] there
[1:56:02] amen oh
[1:56:04] my bunch of
[1:56:07] harlots but Jesus came I like this Jesus
[1:56:11] came and he's the only one that can
[1:56:13] breed us back back to original
[1:56:19] again we're not born of Flesh anymore
[1:56:23] we're not born of sexual desire anymore
[1:56:27] now we come to church to be
[1:56:31] born how are we born young people how do
[1:56:33] you get born Peter said it this way 1
[1:56:37] Peter 1 and verse 22 seeing that ye have
[1:56:41] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[1:56:44] through the spirit unto unframed love of
[1:56:46] the Brethren see that ye love one
[1:56:47] another with a pure heart fervently
[1:56:50] being born again and not of corruptable
[1:56:54] seed but of Incorruptible you don't know
[1:56:57] how much brother bam said in this seed
[1:56:59] that if you're ever going to be back to
[1:57:01] original you've got to take the word
[1:57:04] that the Bible has for you ain't that
[1:57:06] right Jesus said you know come unto me
[1:57:08] all ye who are weary and heavy laden and
[1:57:12] I will give you
[1:57:13] rest he said I am the Water of Life that
[1:57:16] come down from If any man drink of this
[1:57:18] water he'll never thirst again the food
[1:57:21] that I have I am the bread that come
[1:57:23] down out of Heaven if anybody takes this
[1:57:26] amen he'll live
[1:57:28] forever so we
[1:57:30] see bringing into
[1:57:34] thought
[1:57:37] originally
[1:57:39] hello
[1:57:40] originally Adam and Eve didn't even have
[1:57:43] any clothes on did
[1:57:45] they didn't bother them none they didn't
[1:57:49] think nothing of it
[1:57:53] that's
[1:57:54] right but after sin came in then it was
[1:57:58] a different
[1:58:01] story
[1:58:02] originally Adam could say you know I
[1:58:05] don't like where that tree is come on
[1:58:06] over here be planted over here that
[1:58:10] right it would do it whatever he wanted
[1:58:12] he could just speak
[1:58:14] it and the Lord would come down in the
[1:58:17] cool of the evenings is that right and
[1:58:20] fellowship with him how did did you
[1:58:22] enjoy your day today oh Father it was
[1:58:25] just wonderful I'll tell you what Leo I
[1:58:28] really like
[1:58:29] Leo I'll tell you what he is my house
[1:58:32] pet Leo who Leo the
[1:58:36] Lion yeah oh big old furry coat isn't
[1:58:41] that
[1:58:45] right oh out down down shut that mouth
[1:58:48] you know maybe the breath wasn't bad
[1:58:51] then I don't know
[1:58:53] but that's right never have to have any
[1:58:56] fear there was no fear originally we
[1:58:59] didn't have any fear you didn't have to
[1:59:01] be scared of
[1:59:03] anything there was no condemnation in
[1:59:05] their
[1:59:06] heart no boy I did bad I I I'm scared of
[1:59:10] this that no there was no fear
[1:59:14] originally hello how many how many
[1:59:16] believes that a Christian we don't have
[1:59:17] to wait till get over there to go back
[1:59:19] to it no uh there no fear in love the
[1:59:23] Bible says if you got the genuine love
[1:59:25] of God and brother brandham Illustrated
[1:59:27] with the story he talked about the bull
[1:59:28] coming at him isin't that right he was
[1:59:31] no more scared of him than anything
[1:59:32] there was no fear when that love of God
[1:59:35] come down in his
[1:59:36] heart amen that's how I want to be how
[1:59:39] about you let's have the original love
[1:59:42] of God in our hearts let's have the
[1:59:44] original faith God never has to oh my
[1:59:48] think about this till the last one comes
[1:59:51] in he has he's never got to modify his
[1:59:55] faith for
[1:59:56] us well now let me improve my faith let
[1:59:58] me do this that or the other improve the
[2:00:00] Weaponry isin't that right no he never
[2:00:03] has to improve it because it's original
[2:00:05] every every aspect of it is
[2:00:08] original we miss it so many
[2:00:11] times there's even a song somebody wrote
[2:00:14] about the original Life The Original
[2:00:15] Seed amen that's what we need is
[2:00:17] everything
[2:00:19] original not mixed with anything
[2:00:23] else but there he
[2:00:25] was and how many believes that Jesus
[2:00:28] came to bring us back to that
[2:00:32] original to that original way that we
[2:00:35] were supposed to
[2:00:36] be
[2:00:39] amen oh
[2:00:42] my listen he says I'll give you a seed
[2:00:46] to the serpent the serpent had already
[2:00:47] defiled her he says but thy seed I'll
[2:00:50] give you a seed
[2:00:52] shall bruise his head he'll take that
[2:00:54] thing back
[2:00:56] again amen how many beli he's taking us
[2:00:59] back I just wish everybody could see
[2:01:01] that I've come to conquer and to correct
[2:01:05] what Eve
[2:01:08] did how many beli that was the prophet's
[2:01:10] Ministry also Jesus Christ through the
[2:01:13] prophet of God came to bring us back to
[2:01:16] that place amen the only thing the only
[2:01:20] thing that you and I lack or should lack
[2:01:23] was the change of this
[2:01:27] body because remember Jesus said after
[2:01:29] the blood and so forth he says was shed
[2:01:31] and so forth he said you know ask
[2:01:33] anything in my name and I will do it
[2:01:37] restored us back to Sons and Daughters
[2:01:40] of God again this is has a lot to do
[2:01:43] with realizing who you
[2:01:45] are amen how many believes we as a
[2:01:48] church as a group of
[2:01:50] people oh my pray for me pray for
[2:01:52] Brother Brad that we would preach the
[2:01:55] original so that we would have a an
[2:01:57] original product isn't that right we
[2:02:00] want to be like the original
[2:02:06] church that's a big responsibility on us
[2:02:09] ain't that right so Lord help me amen
[2:02:13] Lord help the ministry here to preach
[2:02:15] the original because if we don't have it
[2:02:17] how are you going to get it all right
[2:02:19] let me
[2:02:20] go I we won't go much further but a
[2:02:22] little bit more listen to what he says
[2:02:24] here that's right to correct what Eve
[2:02:26] did and the only way I can do it is
[2:02:29] through a woman
[2:02:30] that uh that believed the seed that'll
[2:02:34] believe the seed where that woman didn't
[2:02:35] believe it a woman that'll believe the
[2:02:37] word amen now we know that was Mary
[2:02:41] isn't that right Mary Let It Be unto me
[2:02:43] according to Thy
[2:02:45] word and not until this generation when
[2:02:48] that word came to its Perfection again
[2:02:50] now again we have have a church a people
[2:02:53] that says Lord let it be unto me
[2:02:56] according to your
[2:02:58] word and that right Lord let it be to me
[2:03:01] according to your word and that's how
[2:03:04] God's going to do it amen see I'm that
[2:03:07] Overcomer I'm the one that's come to
[2:03:09] give life that through my death and PID
[2:03:12] the penalty for what she did and through
[2:03:14] my life will be given to you and flow
[2:03:16] through and over you and you'll become
[2:03:19] sons of God and Daughters of God see as
[2:03:21] long as that seed is in there but you
[2:03:23] can't hybridize it with anything all of
[2:03:26] guns God's Sons must be the same yes sir
[2:03:29] to be born of the word and the spirit
[2:03:32] brings us back to that spoken word again
[2:03:36] Amen to be born of water and of spirit
[2:03:40] what does it do then it brings you right
[2:03:42] back again into that place where you
[2:03:43] should have been at the
[2:03:46] beginning back
[2:03:49] to original
[2:03:52] if you're born again you are back to
[2:03:55] being an original son and daughter of
[2:04:00] God how many thankful for
[2:04:02] that and then when you get to walking
[2:04:05] now let me just close with this when you
[2:04:07] get to Walking with God and so many so
[2:04:10] many illustrations I'd like maybe I'll
[2:04:12] do it this
[2:04:17] evening but when you're
[2:04:20] walking when you're driving in your
[2:04:25] car you're the only one in your
[2:04:28] car I do this a
[2:04:31] lot just praising him and say thank you
[2:04:33] Lord
[2:04:35] Jesus thank you for your goodness
[2:04:39] Lord I thank him for everything he's
[2:04:42] given me but most the biggest thing that
[2:04:43] I thank him for is the peace that he
[2:04:46] puts in your heart how many loves that
[2:04:50] peace that peace is it's just it it's
[2:04:52] passes understanding it's worth more
[2:04:56] than Trump's billion
[2:04:59] dollars how many know there's a lot of
[2:05:01] billionaires out there that are very
[2:05:04] very
[2:05:05] poor that are very very they're flat
[2:05:09] broke if they don't have God they're
[2:05:12] flat
[2:05:13] broke they're in a pitiful
[2:05:17] shape because they could give every last
[2:05:20] penny of it and it wouldn't buy one bit
[2:05:24] of peace or forgiveness ain't that right
[2:05:28] what you have is more valuable than any
[2:05:30] of
[2:05:31] that amen I thank God for that peace
[2:05:35] thank you
[2:05:42] Jesus amen we'll continue this on this
[2:05:45] evening
[2:05:46] amen I always deem it an honor a
[2:05:50] privilege
[2:05:52] to do what God has asked us to do Jesus
[2:05:54] said this do in remembrance of me as
[2:05:57] often as you take
[2:05:59] it because how many knows that it was
[2:06:01] because of that price that he paid on
[2:06:04] Calvary it's because of what he did on
[2:06:06] Calvary that we're even sitting here
[2:06:09] nothing could have ever come of anything
[2:06:11] if he wouldn't have been for what he did
[2:06:13] for us on Calvary for paying the price
[2:06:16] for us and we want to remember that amen
[2:06:19] as often as we take it amen
[2:06:22] amen amen so if you will stand with me
[2:06:24] for a
[2:06:28] minute with our heads bowed I want to
[2:06:30] have a prayer before I change the order
[2:06:33] to
[2:06:34] service what I was trying to say is if
[2:06:36] you're walking with God and the way that
[2:06:39] he originally intended for you to
[2:06:43] do if you have slipped from that
[2:06:47] originality I want I want to tell you
[2:06:49] something that I feel like the Holy
[2:06:51] Spirit impressed upon me to say and that
[2:06:54] is that if you're
[2:06:58] not where you should be in that state of
[2:07:03] originality your backslid not quite
[2:07:06] where you used to be the Lord Jesus
[2:07:09] wants to forgive
[2:07:11] you because if you re truly would repent
[2:07:15] this is the thought that he gave me if
[2:07:17] you truly repent because we have many
[2:07:20] shortcomings and failures years 490
[2:07:23] times a day he would forgive you for it
[2:07:26] that's how forgiving he is that's how
[2:07:28] much he loves
[2:07:29] you so if you have raise your hand say
[2:07:32] God I'm not where I used to be I'm not
[2:07:34] as close as what I should be I'm not the
[2:07:37] way that I should be and father I ask
[2:07:39] you to forgive me this
[2:07:41] morning I want to walk in the way that I
[2:07:44] was originally intended for me to walk
[2:07:46] with you daily and it's nothing but the
[2:07:50] devil that gets us sometimes times and
[2:07:51] causes us to slip to falter to fail and
[2:07:56] to backslide so to speak even as the
[2:07:59] church did so many times but we raise
[2:08:02] our hands this Sunday and maybe it was
[2:08:05] just in the last few days whatever it
[2:08:06] might be it don't matter but the Bride
[2:08:09] of Jesus Christ in this hour is checking
[2:08:11] up every hour we want to check up every
[2:08:14] week we want to check up every day every
[2:08:16] hour of the day say God don't let me
[2:08:18] slip let me walk in that walk and don't
[2:08:20] let the devil cause anything to come
[2:08:22] into my life that would cause a
[2:08:25] disfellowship between me and you but I
[2:08:27] want to be that original son and
[2:08:29] daughter walking with you you see these
[2:08:32] hands Lord they didn't raise it to me
[2:08:34] they raised it to you Lord seeing
[2:08:37] they're guilty but they surrender and
[2:08:38] they ask forgiveness Lord before we take
[2:08:41] this communion we want to make sure
[2:08:42] everything's right so that our lives are
[2:08:44] worthy of the gospel and are worthy of
[2:08:46] taking this so that we don't eat or
[2:08:49] drink damnation to ourselves Lord if
[2:08:51] there's any that's not worthy and can't
[2:08:53] take it I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:08:55] before the next communion service Lord
[2:08:58] that you would help them overcome and
[2:09:00] get to the place that they can Lord but
[2:09:02] Lord we they can do it right now if
[2:09:04] they'll just repent God we ask it in the
[2:09:06] name of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all
[2:09:10] unrighteousness and help us to walk like
[2:09:13] original Sons and Daughters were meant
[2:09:16] to be in Jesus name amen and amen you
[2:09:21] believe believe he forgives you he
[2:09:23] believes he loves you amen turn your
[2:09:26] Bibles we'll just turn to change the
[2:09:28] order to service at this time
