[20:07] thank you for that song I appreciate
[20:09] that I tell you brother Josh had it on
[20:11] his mind that song all last Wednesday
[20:13] and I had it on my mind to call him and
[20:15] you know sometimes you uh you just don't
[20:17] you just don't take heed to it sometimes
[20:20] but we ought to be a little more
[20:22] obedient when the when the you have a
[20:24] call and a feeling on you and
[20:26] something's pressing on you but
[20:27] sometimes we we neglect that and uh and
[20:31] the Lord blessed us tonight by giving us
[20:33] another chance so we appreciate that and
[20:35] brother Josh thank you for your practice
[20:37] and effort sister Becky sister Leo we
[20:40] appreciate that so we do want to speak
[20:42] tonight if we could take a look at part
[20:44] two uh on let the worshipers arise if
[20:47] you're turning your Bibles to Matthew
[20:49] chapter 2.
[20:53] all right
[20:56] I'll tell you there's really just no
[20:58] stopping point when you look at the
[20:59] worship and how to how you worship God
[21:01] and and how he's worthy of our worship
[21:04] and
[21:05] the types of worship and it just goes on
[21:07] and on and on and the Book of Matthew
[21:10] relays that to us probably as well as
[21:12] any book in the Bible and and if you
[21:14] look there's several places where people
[21:16] fell down and worshiped Jesus and and
[21:19] they they crawled to Jesus and and they
[21:21] laid down and they worship and it was a
[21:23] constant worship and he was answering
[21:25] their answering their needs not because
[21:27] they were begging not because they were
[21:29] praying but because they were just
[21:30] simply worshiping who he was and
[21:33] recognizing who he was Matthew chapter 2
[21:38] we talked a little bit last week in the
[21:40] book of Acts about manaean
[21:42] and how he was brought up with King
[21:46] Herod and so we're going to look a
[21:48] little bit at King Herod for a little
[21:49] while tonight as well Matthew chapter 2.
[21:52] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[21:54] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[21:56] behold there came wise men from the East
[21:59] to Jerusalem
[22:01] saying where is he that is born King of
[22:03] the Jews for we have seen his star in
[22:07] the east and we are come to worship Him
[22:13] and when Harry the king had heard these
[22:15] things he was troubled in all Jerusalem
[22:17] with him and when he had gathered all
[22:19] the chief priests and the scribes and
[22:20] the people together he demanded of them
[22:22] where Christ should be born
[22:25] and they said unto him in Bethlehem of
[22:27] Judea and thus it is written by the
[22:29] prophets and that and thou Bethlehem in
[22:32] the land of Judah are not the least
[22:34] among the princes of Judah for out of
[22:37] these shall come a governor that shall
[22:39] what's it say rule
[22:42] My People Israel then Herod when he had
[22:45] probably called the wise man inquired of
[22:47] them diligently what time the star
[22:49] appeared so now he's getting a little
[22:51] bit curious
[22:53] so King Herod he's he's starting to get
[22:55] a little curiosity sparking in him now
[22:57] the talks going around town
[23:00] and he
[23:02] sent them to Bethlehem and said go and
[23:05] search diligently for the young child
[23:08] and when ye have found him bring me word
[23:10] again that I may come and worship him
[23:13] also
[23:15] what about that
[23:17] Satan had his old tactics lying just
[23:20] like he did in the beginning saying he
[23:23] wants this child so that he can come and
[23:24] worship him when all along he's nothing
[23:27] but a murderer
[23:30] and when they had heard the king they
[23:32] departed and lo the star which they saw
[23:36] in the East went before them
[23:38] till it came and stood over where the
[23:41] young child was
[23:43] and when they saw the star they rejoiced
[23:48] with exceeding great joy can you imagine
[23:51] these Magis these three wise men as they
[23:53] see this story and it's standing over
[23:55] there and they they see this star and
[23:56] they begin to say there it is there's
[23:58] what we've been looking for all these
[24:00] years we knew it was a sign to come we
[24:02] knew that there was going to be a sign
[24:04] in the sky and now here it is praise the
[24:07] Lord
[24:09] and when they were coming to the house
[24:10] they saw the young child with Mary his
[24:13] mother and fell down and worshiped him
[24:17] and when they had opened their Treasures
[24:20] they presented unto him gifts
[24:22] gold frankincense and myrrh
[24:26] and when you look at that word fell down
[24:29] it means falling down and one
[24:32] translation says is they prostrated
[24:34] themselves meaning that they laid
[24:36] themselves down flat face down on the
[24:38] ground and and to show reverence and to
[24:41] show uh a submission
[24:44] these three wise men come and fall down
[24:47] face first before this child and
[24:49] submitting themselves to him and say
[24:51] we've been looking for the king of the
[24:52] Jews the star has shown and here you are
[24:58] and then another translation says they
[25:00] paid homage to him
[25:02] and when you look at that word homage it
[25:04] means to show special honor and respect
[25:07] shown publicly oh how many times we hide
[25:11] away our worship and our praise
[25:14] amen
[25:16] let's pray Heavenly Father we're just
[25:18] thankful Lord to be in your house once
[25:20] again and we just want to take this time
[25:22] and this opportunity to focus once again
[25:24] on you father and and to worship you and
[25:27] to lift you up and to see how we as your
[25:30] children and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[25:32] can give more of ourselves to you and
[25:35] take more of the emphasis off of us
[25:36] because if we lift you up you're
[25:39] constantly rewarding your bride Lord and
[25:41] Lord we just want to be we just want to
[25:43] be diligently in serving you we want to
[25:45] be faithful and worshiping you and
[25:47] lifting you up and giving you praise
[25:49] Lord and so we ask that you minister to
[25:51] our hearts tonight and lead us in that
[25:53] way we love you we appreciate you in
[25:55] Christ's name amen you can be seated
[25:58] so just to lay a little bit of
[26:00] background I'm going to try not to hold
[26:01] you as long tonight but to lay a
[26:03] background
[26:04] we look over here in the east
[26:07] and anytime you would go before someone
[26:09] of royalty or someone of importance and
[26:12] and you would take with you gifts
[26:15] and so here are these three wise men
[26:18] believing that this young child is going
[26:21] to be the king of the Jews it's not
[26:24] surprising that they bring lavish gifts
[26:27] and lay before him and the idea and the
[26:30] fact is that these three wise men brain
[26:32] gold frankincense and myrrh go when we
[26:36] see represents royalty
[26:39] frankincense or the incense is Divinity
[26:42] and then when you look at myrrh it means
[26:44] death now did the Magis know did they
[26:47] realize exactly what they were bringing
[26:49] but when we look at this we see now that
[26:51] we have a royal king of divine nature
[26:53] who will die for his people
[26:57] that's the gifts that they bring to
[26:59] worship and lay down at his feet now
[27:01] they were unaware of that but they had
[27:03] one thing on their mind I want to honor
[27:06] the king of Jews and I want you to
[27:10] understand I want you to notice that
[27:11] they presented the gifts to them to him
[27:15] it says they presented the gifts to him
[27:17] meaning Jesus this child
[27:19] and bring gifts and give to Mary
[27:22] they didn't bring gifts and gifts to
[27:24] Joseph
[27:25] they didn't they didn't bring gifts and
[27:26] give to all the people around no but
[27:28] many times we find that we give our
[27:30] gifts
[27:32] we give our talents to the things around
[27:36] us to the things of the world to the to
[27:38] the activities that take place around us
[27:40] and we give and give and give until we
[27:43] don't have time to give to God
[27:45] but these magi's coming so we're going
[27:47] to give you all that we got we're going
[27:49] to give you the gifts that we have to
[27:50] bring somebody once told me when I was
[27:53] thinking about this scripture ever come
[27:55] in my memory but somebody once told me
[27:57] when you say yes to one thing to one
[28:00] person you're saying no to another
[28:04] think about that
[28:06] the world people around you uh the
[28:09] things that you're involved in they will
[28:10] pull at you and pull at you and pull at
[28:12] you to all the effort that you've got
[28:15] you can pour into things that really
[28:16] doesn't matter
[28:18] and you're saying yes to those things
[28:20] but on the flip side you're actually
[28:22] saying no to God
[28:26] are you with me
[28:29] it says they fell down and worshiped him
[28:33] more important than the gifts that they
[28:35] bring was the fact that they worshiped
[28:38] Jesus
[28:40] and this must have been an amazing sight
[28:42] for Joseph and Mary
[28:44] to be sitting there and all of a sudden
[28:47] these three dignitaries come rolling up
[28:49] in fine Cadillacs
[28:51] this was a cattle train
[28:53] and they come rolling up there in a
[28:56] special way and now as soon as they see
[28:58] the Christ they bow down and fall at his
[29:02] feet
[29:03] can you imagine the thought going to
[29:05] Joseph and Mary's mind no doubt Mary has
[29:08] a remembrance of Her Mind of a Time past
[29:10] when she was visited by an Angel and the
[29:13] angel told her you're a virgin you shall
[29:14] conceive so Mary know who she was
[29:18] now she's beginning to see who he is
[29:22] because these my jobs have come and said
[29:24] we have seen in the skies we've seen in
[29:27] the stars that the king of the Jews has
[29:29] been born somebody's got to worship Him
[29:31] we sing that song Mary Did You Know
[29:35] she knew who she was now she sees the
[29:37] revelation of who he is
[29:41] and we look on one hand here
[29:44] it he displays an open
[29:48] and hatred and hostility
[29:51] from the very sound of Jesus's birth
[29:55] he's angry about this
[29:57] the chief priests and the scribes
[29:59] they're indifferent towards Jesus but
[30:02] these wise men seek out Jesus to worship
[30:07] Him
[30:08] this come at a great cost
[30:11] because they come at a great cause
[30:13] because they had realized if you look at
[30:16] the scripture they had kind of shunned
[30:18] away from what Herod was asking him to
[30:20] do come and tell us no I don't know we
[30:23] don't think you have the best of
[30:24] intentions here
[30:26] we're going to go worshiping you say you
[30:29] want to worship him but all you want to
[30:30] do is destroy him
[30:32] so they kind of shied away so now
[30:34] they're kind of wanted by Herod No Doubt
[30:37] and the wisdom that we can learn from
[30:40] these wise men his brothers and sisters
[30:42] that we're not satisfied at just looking
[30:44] at a star
[30:46] we're not satisfied at just looking at
[30:48] something shiny
[30:50] they saw the star and they done
[30:53] something about it
[30:56] they put themselves into action
[30:59] we determined last week that if you're
[31:01] going to worship God you have to have
[31:03] action involved so they fell down they
[31:06] prostrated themselves before the Lord
[31:08] they began to sing praises before the
[31:11] Lord we have to find ourselves actively
[31:14] worshiping God it's more than just
[31:16] sitting on a Pew like a nominal law
[31:18] it's more than just going through your
[31:20] day-to-day life but it's giving and
[31:22] giving and giving and giving
[31:25] I don't mean him giving to you I mean
[31:27] you giving to him
[31:29] that's where our worship is
[31:31] they rejoiced at this star
[31:33] and they arrived at this destination
[31:39] after they've been persevering for two
[31:41] years
[31:44] you know we want to think in the world
[31:45] also think and we know different
[31:47] Scholars no different the prophet told
[31:49] us different this was not an infant
[31:52] Jesus was a two-year-old 18 months a
[31:54] two-year-old child
[31:56] these Magi saw the star
[31:59] in the sky
[32:01] for two years they persevered and they
[32:04] traveled they went through the desert
[32:05] and and and had to put up with mocking
[32:08] and ridicule no doubt they went through
[32:10] little towns and little cities and they
[32:11] said what are you guys doing where are
[32:13] you going we're going to worship the
[32:15] king of the Jews
[32:17] are you talking about yeah there's a
[32:19] star in the sky do you see that star
[32:20] there's nothing in the sky no different
[32:25] Prophet said only imagine could see it
[32:29] but they said we're following the star
[32:30] there's no are you guys are crazy
[32:37] and they see this star and it leads them
[32:39] up there and they they begin to get
[32:41] there and they entered into worship
[32:45] and there's an urgency about their
[32:47] business
[32:49] it doesn't say they linger around
[32:51] they socialize for a while they
[32:54] introduce themselves told where they
[32:56] were from it doesn't say that it says
[32:58] they fell down
[33:00] many times we have a hard time
[33:02] persevering from Sunday to Sunday
[33:05] these guys are persevering for two years
[33:08] and then they fall down we say well we
[33:10] just can't get entered into Worship in
[33:12] the church we just don't sing long
[33:13] enough we don't we don't have that kind
[33:15] of music we don't have this we're not
[33:17] willing to put forth we're not willing
[33:19] to get in there and fall down into the
[33:21] worship that God is asking us to do
[33:27] and when they worshiped it was to give
[33:31] something
[33:32] it wasn't some kind of empty-handed
[33:34] adoration just saying oh well this is
[33:36] this is the Lord they've been you know
[33:38] it's been prophesied it's been said here
[33:40] he is
[33:41] it wasn't that kind of worship at all
[33:47] it was heartfelt
[33:49] it was heartfelt it hadn't meaning
[33:52] there was something about it that they
[33:54] they were so dedicated as they fall down
[33:58] and said I'm going to praise God
[34:01] and that's our attitude we have to have
[34:03] we got to praise God
[34:04] if we feel like God's against us
[34:11] we see this pattern
[34:13] over and over and we see the pattern
[34:15] that those who look Upon Jesus will see
[34:18] him those who truly see him will worship
[34:21] Him and those who worship Him will
[34:23] consecrate their substance to him
[34:25] think about that
[34:28] as we read this scripture here in
[34:31] Matthew 2
[34:32] looking at the birth of our Lord and
[34:34] savior I want you to pay special
[34:36] attention to the two contrasts of the
[34:38] Kings
[34:40] because brothers and sisters in the very
[34:42] beginning of time there's always been a
[34:44] contrast of Kings
[34:46] there's been a war between the Throne of
[34:49] God
[34:49] and the seed of Satan
[34:53] the Throne of God and the seed of Satan
[34:55] so here we see the contrast between
[34:57] Herod and Jesus
[35:00] Jesus
[35:03] is a newborn king
[35:07] so what is the question here
[35:10] the question here to Herod in his mind
[35:12] is kingship
[35:15] kingship and when the wise men came into
[35:18] the court of King Herod the first thing
[35:19] they said is the king of the Jews has
[35:22] been born
[35:23] and you look in your scripture King has
[35:25] a capital K
[35:28] and every time they address King Herod
[35:30] it's a little K
[35:33] how be little in this must have been to
[35:35] a King like Herod
[35:37] and his birth of Jesus and the arrival
[35:40] on his wise man Jesus is immediately
[35:42] identified as what a ruler
[35:47] they said he would rule his people
[35:51] and they never do announce it as a ruler
[35:55] he's a little K A little King
[35:59] and this kingship of Herod
[36:02] is Harsh
[36:04] think about the contrast this is a harsh
[36:06] harsh thing Herod is a tyrant
[36:09] let me tell you the life of a sinner is
[36:12] Harsh
[36:13] the life the way of a sinner is Harsh
[36:16] and Herod here is telling us that the
[36:18] Bible's telling us he is a tyrant and
[36:21] his tyrannical rule is characterized by
[36:23] an all-consuming desire to preserve his
[36:26] own status
[36:29] okay he's selfish
[36:31] Herod finds himself in a selfish
[36:34] condition that he wants his power He
[36:37] Wants to Rule and he wants to Reign and
[36:39] he will stop at nothing including
[36:41] murdering the innocent lives of every
[36:43] child under two years of age
[36:46] all right
[36:49] so as Christians
[36:52] we can look at this
[36:54] and we can look at Herod and say we
[36:56] don't want to be like a Herod
[36:58] there's nothing in me that wants to be
[37:00] like a Herod that I'm all consumed about
[37:02] myself
[37:05] because all he wanted to do was
[37:06] emphasize his life his way his living
[37:10] we put the emphasis on Christ
[37:14] listen to what Augustus the Roman
[37:16] Emperor said about Herod
[37:18] he said it was safer to be herod's Pig
[37:21] than herod's son
[37:26] how would you like that to be your daddy
[37:30] it was safer to be herod's Pig
[37:32] than to be herod's son
[37:38] so here is the king
[37:40] of dominance
[37:43] an authority
[37:45] a man who is who is overseeing a kingdom
[37:48] through
[37:49] a tyrannical rule of murder
[37:51] and violence
[37:53] to get what he wants and now all of a
[37:56] sudden the heavens begin to declare and
[38:00] nature begins to say there is a new
[38:02] kingship
[38:05] there's something happening
[38:07] the very stars and the sky are
[38:10] proclaiming and shouting to the entire
[38:12] world that we now have a gentle King
[38:16] we have a king now who loves we have a
[38:19] king who is Like a Shepherd who will
[38:21] save his people from destruction we have
[38:23] a king who is who has been born into a
[38:25] wicked and cruel murderous world so that
[38:28] you don't have to die
[38:30] and the world is proclaiming it listen
[38:33] to house birds and put this a stir
[38:36] begins as soon as Christ is born
[38:39] he has not spoken a word
[38:43] he has not wrought a miracle
[38:45] he has not proclaimed a single single
[38:48] Doctrine but when Jesus was born at the
[38:51] very first while as yet you hear nothing
[38:53] but infant cries
[38:56] nothing but the infant weakness still
[38:59] his influence on the world is manifest
[39:05] but
[39:06] for the universe
[39:08] to jump out a cater
[39:11] and a star to appear
[39:14] now we know it's more than a star
[39:16] it was the same as a as the pillar of
[39:19] fire that led the children of Israel
[39:20] that's what the prophet said it was just
[39:22] like the pillar of fire led to children
[39:23] of Israel it's the same kind of fire
[39:25] that was in the sky that was leading the
[39:27] magias but all of all of the world and
[39:31] all of the universe was declaring that
[39:33] Jesus
[39:35] is Lord
[39:39] Jesus has come and he gives his life for
[39:41] the sake of others while Herod takes the
[39:43] life of others
[39:49] we see this birth of Jesus
[39:52] and as we look at this birth of Jesus
[39:55] and we begin to see what Jesus was for
[39:57] and we begin to see that there is now
[40:00] these magias look I see this now and
[40:02] they as they arise they say that now
[40:04] there's life on the horizon
[40:07] that there is hope on the horizon
[40:11] do you see how things are changing now
[40:13] because the good will always outwin and
[40:17] overtake the evil
[40:20] no doubt how evil and how Wicked
[40:22] something can be God is always better
[40:25] and here they can see now that there is
[40:27] life and there's Hope on the horizon and
[40:30] for the Believers today I want you to
[40:31] know there is hope on the horizon if
[40:34] you're a Believer today and you've given
[40:36] your life to Christ and you worshiping
[40:38] God there is hope for you in this life
[40:40] in this world not in this world but in
[40:43] the world come
[40:45] life is on the horizon there is a land
[40:48] beyond the river
[40:49] that is why we worship
[40:53] it's not because I earned it
[40:55] it's not because you've done anything
[40:57] good it's not because you are married in
[40:59] it but it's because there is a lamb
[41:01] beyond the river because Jesus came and
[41:02] died on a cross and because of that
[41:05] there will be no more sickness no more
[41:07] sorrow No More Death no more no more
[41:09] crying No More Tears
[41:12] that ought to give us something to
[41:13] praise God about say hallelujah praise
[41:15] our Lord
[41:18] all right
[41:22] but the world now
[41:25] is worshiping Satan
[41:34] it's Satan's eating
[41:38] it's where all his little imps
[41:42] you know I heard brother random use that
[41:44] word and I thought what in the world
[41:45] does that word mean
[41:47] mischievous Little Devils
[41:50] laughs
[41:53] all of his mischievous Little Devils
[41:56] he said he's got Devils it's thrown down
[41:59] his powers
[42:00] he said he's got little amps out here
[42:02] you don't realize it
[42:06] and he goes in to listing these things
[42:10] and I hope it's not problems here but
[42:12] think about the world that we live in
[42:15] he said they go in and they said begin
[42:17] to smoke cigarettes and women out here
[42:19] and drinking and carrying on and you're
[42:22] poisoning your system
[42:24] he says you're ruining the whole
[42:26] Generations that will follow you you're
[42:29] up in your chance of cancer by 85
[42:31] percent
[42:32] and these little imps are all in control
[42:34] of this
[42:36] and they're worshiping these things and
[42:39] he said that back in there back then he
[42:41] said there was a preacher across the way
[42:43] there he didn't really give directions
[42:45] or uh exactly where but he said he's
[42:48] promoting square dancing
[42:51] and how do we see that music and
[42:54] entertainment has taken over today
[42:56] and he said back then it started with a
[42:58] little bit of square dancing and he said
[43:00] it all started when men were taking
[43:02] other other men's lives and dancing with
[43:05] them and pulling them up close to them
[43:09] you see how the perversion starts
[43:12] and they begin to worship that thing and
[43:14] all this is going on and he said you get
[43:17] out there and the women they get
[43:19] stripped down
[43:21] you know there's very little modesty
[43:24] in the world today
[43:28] and I know we've heard that for a long
[43:30] time
[43:31] but I have to say it's it's more vulgar
[43:34] and more perverted
[43:36] then anytime I've ever can remember
[43:45] what are they doing
[43:47] they're worshiping
[43:50] there is a God of this evil age
[43:55] and they are worshiping this God
[43:59] with the pollution that they do with
[44:01] their lives
[44:04] remember he says sin didn't begin on
[44:06] Earth
[44:07] sin began in heaven
[44:09] when Lucifer said I want a denomination
[44:14] I want to make it great and big and
[44:17] bigger than anything Michael has
[44:21] he says notice Lucifer in the last days
[44:23] is doing what he did in the first
[44:26] see he's not changed his character
[44:28] even though he's a fallen angel
[44:31] he still got the same characteristics
[44:34] and Lucifer wants to be worshiped and he
[44:37] says the first thing that Lucifer does
[44:39] is he tries to separate the fellowship
[44:42] of God and man
[44:45] think about that he tries to separate
[44:48] the fellowship of God and man to build
[44:51] him a kingdom and a great Splendor
[44:54] something is greater than Michael's he
[44:56] said have you got that he said now
[44:59] if you've missed it just hold up your
[45:01] hand because I want to say it again this
[45:03] is how important this is he says Lucifer
[45:05] at the beginning his purpose and heart
[45:08] was to achieve a brighter greater thing
[45:10] in heaven than Christ had
[45:13] um so brothers and sisters we can see
[45:16] here that Satan knows if he can drop a
[45:19] wedge between you and God
[45:24] he's on his Road
[45:26] if he can separate you from worshiping
[45:29] God
[45:31] he knows that there is hope that he
[45:33] could slide his little slick Weasley way
[45:35] right into your vessel into your house
[45:38] and to your environment and the next
[45:41] thing you know you won't no longer be
[45:42] worshiping God because that wedge is
[45:44] there
[45:46] something will happen and that little
[45:48] Holy Spirit the prophet said it'll just
[45:49] fly off like a little dove
[45:52] what is that that's Satan driving wedges
[45:55] in our life he's trying to drive a
[45:58] separating wedge between you and God
[46:00] because if he can get in there he knows
[46:03] he's got a chance
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] and this cycle is never broken
[46:11] this cycle won't be broken until we're
[46:13] in the millennium
[46:16] so we have to combat this we have to be
[46:19] aware of this and Satan driving his
[46:22] wedges in there because he wants more
[46:24] praise than God
[46:26] he wants more love than God he wants
[46:30] more followers than God
[46:33] he wants to be loved more than God
[46:40] serving the God of this evil age
[46:44] and what do they say oh I just love it
[46:49] they go to parties
[46:51] oh we had a great time we just loved it
[46:56] sleep with multiple men and women we
[46:58] just love it
[47:01] you know that's a big thing now
[47:03] um
[47:04] let me tell you it's going to be awful
[47:06] hot
[47:08] but they love it
[47:10] they're worshiping into this system of
[47:13] this God of an evil age and he says
[47:16] notice about the time that Jesus came on
[47:19] the scene
[47:21] Judas came on the scene
[47:24] remember I told you this cycle is never
[47:26] broken
[47:27] this cycle goes on and on and on it
[47:30] started in the heavens come down and the
[47:32] cycle begins to go on and on and he says
[47:35] I want you to notice the natures of
[47:36] these two Spirits Judas was a religious
[47:39] man
[47:41] he was on an Infidel he said he was a
[47:44] religious man and we know he was of the
[47:47] Antichrist spirit and he said he worked
[47:50] very close
[47:52] at the hand of Christ he was Christ
[47:54] right hand man
[48:01] he said did you know in heaven that the
[48:03] devil was God's right hand man
[48:07] so brothers and sisters
[48:10] I believe we have dominion I believe we
[48:12] have authority I believe we have power
[48:13] over Satan but we cannot underestimate
[48:16] him
[48:18] we cannot underestimate him he says
[48:20] Lucifer the son of the morning was given
[48:22] power
[48:25] and this power is to draw worship
[48:31] the reason that he brought sin in the
[48:33] world was he was able to take something
[48:35] that God had created and perverted it
[48:37] back into an evil thing and that started
[48:40] all the trouble in the beginning he said
[48:43] God before way back before the
[48:44] foundation of the world was ever laid he
[48:46] seen Satan the done that and in his
[48:48] pride he went over the North and set up
[48:50] a kingdom and fought against Michael and
[48:52] his angels the right hand of almighty
[48:56] God was Lucifer the son of the morning
[48:58] he said and God listen to this this is
[49:01] astonishing
[49:02] I know you've heard it but just listen
[49:04] God granted him almost co-workers with
[49:08] him he was a co-worker partly equal with
[49:12] him
[49:15] power
[49:20] almost co-workers with him only
[49:23] difference Satan could not create
[49:27] so here is Satan in the heavens before
[49:29] the foundation of the Earth
[49:32] and he sees day after day after day as
[49:35] he's standing by the right hand of God
[49:38] almighty and he sees and all he hears
[49:41] are the Angels worshiping holy holy holy
[49:46] Lord God Almighty we praise you Lord
[49:52] and this starts to weigh on Lucifer's
[49:54] mind
[49:55] and Lucifer begins to think hey he made
[49:58] me in such a way that I'm just like him
[50:03] he co-created me
[50:07] only difference is I can't create he can
[50:09] do all that but why are they not
[50:11] worshiping me
[50:13] and he begins to get out there into the
[50:16] minds of the Angels
[50:18] one-third of the Angels he goes into
[50:20] their minds and he begins to work on
[50:22] them hey all you ever do is praise him
[50:24] but what about me I'm as powerful too
[50:28] look at me putting all of the emphasis
[50:31] on himself
[50:32] and by that one-third of the Angels is
[50:35] encouraged to begin to start worshiping
[50:37] him and turn their minds away from God
[50:40] almighty
[50:47] foreign
[50:50] took something that God created and
[50:52] perverted it
[50:53] he said I want you to notice when Cain
[50:56] and Abel
[50:57] very beautiful picture of it Cain and
[50:59] Abel was nothing more than a pre-figure
[51:01] of Judas and Jesus
[51:04] and the next statement here was
[51:06] astonishing to me
[51:08] when we talk about
[51:10] worship we have to have a place of
[51:12] worship
[51:14] generally we call this the house of God
[51:16] the house of worship we have an altar
[51:19] brother says just as Cain killed Abel at
[51:23] the altar
[51:26] think about that he said Judas killed
[51:29] Jesus at the altar
[51:33] when we look at what the altar means it
[51:34] means the air a raised area and a house
[51:37] of worship where people can honor God
[51:39] with offerings
[51:43] so came to your brothers and sisters has
[51:45] come to an altar to say Abel in an act
[51:49] of worship
[51:53] same thing Herod wanted to do
[51:56] come tell me when this child is born
[51:58] because I want to go and worship him
[52:01] see it all matters what altar you're
[52:03] worshiping at
[52:06] you can worship and worship and worship
[52:08] and be worshiping at the wrong altar
[52:11] but God is the one who is Worthy
[52:14] of all our worship
[52:17] turn with if you would to Matthew
[52:18] chapter 4.
[52:30] Matthew chapter 4.
[52:34] very familiar scripture
[52:37] when Jesus was led up
[52:39] of the spirit Into the Wilderness
[52:42] to be tempted of the devil
[52:45] and when he had fasted for 40 days and
[52:47] 40 nights
[52:49] he was afterward unhungered
[52:53] so here we see Jesus had just come from
[52:55] the baptismal he was showing how to be
[52:57] baptized and was being and was being
[53:00] honored that way and he comes into this
[53:02] Wilderness Area and to get away and to
[53:04] just pray and meditate and he's fasting
[53:07] for 40 days and 40 nights and the Bible
[53:10] says he was hungered so now we see that
[53:12] Jesus is in a weakened state
[53:17] did you ever notice a lot of times the
[53:18] Temptation will come when you're in your
[53:20] weakened state
[53:23] when you're when you're something's not
[53:25] going right when you're sick that's when
[53:27] the temperature comes that's when the
[53:29] opportunities come
[53:30] when you're not quite where you should
[53:32] be with God when you're not quite
[53:34] worshiping the way you should be and
[53:35] praising God and living the life you
[53:37] should be living here's when the
[53:38] opportunities come for Satan
[53:41] and The Temper comes to him and said if
[53:42] you be the son of man turn these stones
[53:45] into bread
[53:47] and you know I won't rehearse at all but
[53:49] we'll go over it he says no no it's
[53:50] written I'm not going to do that I won't
[53:52] tempt my God and so then the devil takes
[53:55] him up and takes him up onto the
[53:56] pentacle it says if you be the Son of
[53:59] God if you be a son jump off
[54:03] and the angels will catch you before you
[54:05] even Dash your feet to the ground
[54:08] I said no no no no I shall not be
[54:10] tempted
[54:11] I will not tempt the Lord thy God
[54:14] and so then here I want you to look here
[54:16] and we'll pick up in verse 8. again the
[54:18] devil taketh him into an exceedingly
[54:20] high mountain and showeth him all the
[54:23] kingdoms of the world
[54:24] and the glory of them and said unto him
[54:27] all these things I will give thee
[54:32] if thou wilt
[54:34] fall down
[54:37] and worship
[54:38] me
[54:41] and Jesus said unto him it is written
[54:43] Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[54:46] only him thou shall serve what happened
[54:49] it says the devil leaveth him and be
[54:52] humbled Angels Came and ministered to
[54:54] him there's that word again ministered
[54:57] we talked about last week
[54:59] here Jesus was in a wicked state of mind
[55:01] being tempted over and over and over and
[55:04] Satan looks at it and and he says here
[55:07] all you got to do is is Fall Down and
[55:11] Worship me God Jesus
[55:14] and you can have all of this that I have
[55:17] dominion over
[55:21] you know from time to time we find
[55:23] ourselves in places
[55:25] we find ourselves at places where we'll
[55:27] be tempted
[55:29] and this is not a time that we're trying
[55:31] to prove something to God
[55:34] but it's a time when we're trying to
[55:36] prove something to ourselves and the
[55:38] Spiritual Beings watching us
[55:41] when you're weak
[55:44] then you'll be made strong
[55:46] it's through Jesus and brothers and
[55:48] sisters when we in our lowest points of
[55:50] Our Lives and we are become out as
[55:52] Overcomers and we overthrow the enemy it
[55:55] shows all of the Unseen World around us
[55:57] that we have victory that by his stripes
[56:01] we're healed and that my sins that were
[56:04] many they're all forgotten and these
[56:07] angels that set all around us begin to
[56:09] rejoice and those demons that were
[56:11] sitting there with them just gnawing at
[56:13] us
[56:14] they have to flee and those angels come
[56:17] down they begin to minister to us and
[56:19] say I'm going to lift as you have
[56:21] worshiped God
[56:23] don't think that there's not demons in
[56:25] there just like it is angels we talk
[56:27] about angels sitting all around but just
[56:29] the same as there is demons the prophet
[56:32] said at one point I was reading on this
[56:34] and he said there was two demons and one
[56:37] was on one side and one was on the other
[56:38] one it was a cancerous tumor and the
[56:41] other one was a cancerous spirit and
[56:43] they were trying to connect to one
[56:45] another
[56:46] and he said when he began to pray the
[56:48] angel of the Lord separated him
[56:53] so don't think
[56:54] these angels and these demons are not
[56:56] watching how you react to your
[56:58] situations in life
[57:00] they want to know they want to either
[57:01] Revel in your misery
[57:05] or they're going to glorify and the
[57:07] power you have of victory
[57:09] um
[57:10] he said let me tell you something on
[57:12] demonology real quick
[57:14] I know y'all like it when I preach on
[57:16] this but we got to preach on it
[57:19] the devil is just a real devil Jesus
[57:21] Christ as Jesus Christ the son of God
[57:24] he's the devil Heaven is just as real If
[57:27] Heaven's not real hell's not real he
[57:30] says it's it it's let me skip on down
[57:33] here he said but there's a day and
[57:35] there's a night as sure as there's a
[57:37] Christian there's a hypocrite as sure is
[57:39] there somebody that's genuine there's
[57:42] somebody that's impersonating there's a
[57:44] pro and a con a black and a white right
[57:46] on down through life and everything a
[57:48] true worship a false worship he said a
[57:51] false gospel a true gospel a false
[57:53] baptism a true baptism a make-believe
[57:56] dollar a genuine dollar he says that's a
[57:59] genuine Christian there's a genuine
[58:01] hypocrite he says it's just
[58:02] impersonating so you'll find it all goes
[58:05] together
[58:08] Judas and Jesus
[58:10] Herod and Jesus Cain and Abel Lucifer
[58:15] and God
[58:18] who will you worship
[58:21] who's going to get the glory in our
[58:23] lives
[58:27] this temptation here as Jesus is up in
[58:30] the up in the mountains there and Satan
[58:32] is tempting him
[58:34] this is this vision is an invitation for
[58:36] Jesus to take a shortcut around Calvary
[58:38] do you realize that
[58:41] if he would have just listened to Satan
[58:44] Satan told him I will give you all the
[58:47] lands that you see and all of its Glory
[58:52] you think he was showing him all the bad
[58:53] stuff going on
[58:55] no
[58:56] he was showing him what he wanted to see
[58:58] I will give you all of this if you will
[59:01] just fall down and worship
[59:04] me
[59:07] hmm
[59:10] Satan's wanting Jesus
[59:13] to do what the three wise men did to him
[59:17] you think about that what did it say
[59:19] that the wise man did when they went and
[59:20] they found Jesus they fell down and they
[59:22] worshiped him and now Satan is turning
[59:25] it right around twisting the words of
[59:27] the old liar and he's twisting the words
[59:30] and he says I'll give you all of this
[59:31] that I have dominion over if you'll just
[59:33] fall down and worship me
[59:36] in other words God transfer your power
[59:41] we don't need to transfer of power we
[59:44] need to harness the power that we have
[59:46] we need to harness the power that God
[59:48] has already given us and we find
[59:50] ourselves worshiping and allow God to
[59:53] reward us with power and authority
[59:57] so Jesus here he could lay claim to all
[1:00:01] of these kingdoms
[1:00:04] listen to this little saying here
[1:00:07] well listen to this Jesus could have all
[1:00:10] of these kingdoms everything that had
[1:00:12] been lost and been given and Satan had
[1:00:14] dominion over and he would have never
[1:00:16] had to suffer the first stripe
[1:00:19] they would have never pierced his hands
[1:00:21] with nails
[1:00:23] he would have never had to go to the
[1:00:24] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:00:26] he would have never had to cry not my
[1:00:28] will but thine Lord
[1:00:32] it was just that easy
[1:00:34] it was all laying right there at his
[1:00:36] fingertips
[1:00:38] let me tell you the danger is the
[1:00:41] greatest when the end is good listen to
[1:00:44] that
[1:00:45] the danger is the greatest when the end
[1:00:48] is good
[1:00:51] the danger of falling into temptation
[1:00:55] the danger of accepting a rotten
[1:00:58] business deal that you know is not right
[1:01:02] it it's when it looks real good
[1:01:05] here was Jesus and an opportunity right
[1:01:07] here this looks real good
[1:01:10] I can have everything I've ever lost
[1:01:13] no suffering
[1:01:16] that's temptation
[1:01:18] that's a Temptation that we can't
[1:01:20] imagine
[1:01:25] and all he has to do is give in the
[1:01:28] worship of Satan
[1:01:30] let me tell you how important worship is
[1:01:33] to Satan
[1:01:35] if you owned
[1:01:37] real estate
[1:01:39] throughout the county thousands and
[1:01:41] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[1:01:43] Acres with houses and businesses
[1:01:48] churches and events taking place and
[1:01:50] you're prospering and you you own all of
[1:01:52] this
[1:01:54] would you be willing to give all that to
[1:01:56] somebody just for them to fall down at
[1:01:58] your feet and say
[1:01:59] I love you
[1:02:03] because that's what Satan
[1:02:04] was willing to do
[1:02:06] worship is so important to Satan that
[1:02:09] he's willing to give up all the
[1:02:11] dominions of the world all the
[1:02:12] governments the prophet said he was the
[1:02:14] governor of the United States he's the
[1:02:16] governor of Russia he's the governor of
[1:02:18] all the countries out there it's all
[1:02:20] Satan's
[1:02:22] it's not Joe Biden
[1:02:24] he's just a puppet
[1:02:26] he's just a puppet in the hands of Satan
[1:02:29] it's not Donald Trump's I'm sorry to
[1:02:31] burst your bubble
[1:02:34] he's just a mouthpiece
[1:02:37] in the hand of what's happening in the
[1:02:40] world economy
[1:02:49] he says I will give you
[1:02:51] Satan has the authority to give this
[1:02:54] world and his government's back over
[1:02:56] to Satan's or to Jesus
[1:02:59] and all the kingdoms and all the worlds
[1:03:01] and all their glories
[1:03:03] but Adam and Eve
[1:03:05] gave the devil his authority
[1:03:09] think about this
[1:03:11] God gave adam the Earth as stewardship
[1:03:15] I said Adam I'm going to give you this
[1:03:16] Earth and everything that's in it I want
[1:03:18] you to tend to it I want you to take
[1:03:19] care of it I want you to to be the be
[1:03:21] the Lord of all this Earth
[1:03:23] and then Here Comes
[1:03:25] sin in
[1:03:27] and here we see the descendants of Adam
[1:03:29] and they they cast their vote for sin
[1:03:35] Eve she chose sin
[1:03:39] and all they had to say is it is written
[1:03:43] yeah
[1:03:45] yeah
[1:03:52] when Jesus was there
[1:03:55] and Satan is giving him the temptation
[1:03:58] and the Bible says that when he said
[1:04:02] I shall not serve any other God and the
[1:04:04] devil departed from him
[1:04:06] the Bible then turns around and tells us
[1:04:08] that these angels came and they
[1:04:09] ministered to him
[1:04:13] now I can imagine in my mind as as my
[1:04:16] mood as my mind is that these angels as
[1:04:19] we said were sitting all around watching
[1:04:21] this event unfold and trying to see
[1:04:23] exactly what what is he going to do
[1:04:25] and as he says those magic words and the
[1:04:29] devil departs and vanishes out of his
[1:04:31] presence the Angels must have come down
[1:04:33] there and they must have said we knew
[1:04:35] you could do it we knew you would do it
[1:04:37] we knew you would overcome we knew you
[1:04:40] wouldn't give us your lord your God your
[1:04:43] Almighty you're the Healer you're the
[1:04:45] deliverer do you see they begin to
[1:04:48] worship and minister to him and remind
[1:04:51] Jesus who he is
[1:04:53] let me tell you Jesus don't have to be
[1:04:55] reminded
[1:04:56] but he loves to be reminded
[1:05:00] I don't have to be reminded that my kids
[1:05:02] love me but I like it when they tell me
[1:05:05] I don't have to be reminded that my wife
[1:05:07] loves me but it sure sounds good when
[1:05:10] she tells me
[1:05:12] vice versa husbands
[1:05:16] let's look at some of these overcoming
[1:05:18] acts before we close if we could
[1:05:20] we look here in the book of Acts and
[1:05:23] you've got Paul and Silas
[1:05:25] now we look at Paul and Silas and
[1:05:28] the the the
[1:05:30] way of worship that they choose is by
[1:05:33] singing
[1:05:35] here's Paul and Silas
[1:05:38] in a prison in a dungeon hungry
[1:05:42] wet cold starving
[1:05:45] and this is no ordinary song service but
[1:05:48] here all of a sudden comes a duet from
[1:05:50] two men who were beaten and bruised and
[1:05:52] Shackled
[1:05:53] and their worship was so heartfelt
[1:05:57] and I can imagine as they were sitting
[1:05:59] down there and they said you know what
[1:06:00] Paul what Silas
[1:06:02] I'm one of them
[1:06:06] I'm one of them
[1:06:08] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:06:11] them
[1:06:14] really oh yeah I'm one of them
[1:06:17] I'm one of them
[1:06:19] praise God I can say I'm one of them and
[1:06:24] about that time I can imagine that that
[1:06:26] song reached up into the portals of
[1:06:28] heaven and gone from his very Throne
[1:06:30] began to tap his foot oh he's one of
[1:06:33] them they're one of me I'm one of them
[1:06:36] oh we're coming together and the portals
[1:06:39] of Heaven open up and the ministry of
[1:06:41] God come down to that prison and the
[1:06:43] prison walls were broken
[1:06:47] the bars couldn't hold them no more
[1:06:50] let me tell you Satan may try to hold
[1:06:53] you down but he can't hold your lips he
[1:06:56] may try to Shackle you and burden you
[1:06:58] but he can't hold you down because God
[1:07:00] Almighty hears your cries from the very
[1:07:02] portals of Heaven
[1:07:13] here's this little ill-famed woman
[1:07:16] the great one of the I feel it's the
[1:07:18] greatest story one I'm ever told in the
[1:07:20] Bible
[1:07:21] Well ill-famed Woman
[1:07:23] she looks over at the Pharisees house it
[1:07:25] says what's going on over there
[1:07:28] and she's looking over there at the
[1:07:29] Pharisees house what what's going on
[1:07:30] what's that crowd all about what's all
[1:07:32] this disorder about and the problem says
[1:07:34] she goes over there and she's just a
[1:07:36] little old ill-famed prostitute
[1:07:39] that says she begins to look on her
[1:07:41] tiptoes and she's looking over the
[1:07:42] shoulders of the man trying to see
[1:07:44] what's going on over in Simon's house
[1:07:46] and she looks over there and she looks
[1:07:48] and she says oh they're having a feast
[1:07:49] they're having a dinner look at all this
[1:07:51] wonderful food and there's her eyes peer
[1:07:53] over into the corner
[1:07:57] is that him
[1:08:00] is that him is that the one it looks
[1:08:03] just like him and I have heard so much
[1:08:05] about it is that the very one that said
[1:08:08] she was struck with such ambition she
[1:08:10] run to her house and she run up I was
[1:08:13] rickety stairs up into an attic where
[1:08:15] she lived
[1:08:16] I said she went over there and she
[1:08:17] opened up a chest and grabbed down into
[1:08:19] her and grabbed a little sock full of
[1:08:21] money
[1:08:21] and since she took off running down
[1:08:23] there she said oh I can't do this
[1:08:26] see how Satan tries to throw up your
[1:08:28] past
[1:08:29] when your Future's standing right before
[1:08:30] you
[1:08:31] he tries to throw up her past and Satan
[1:08:34] tells her says you can't do this because
[1:08:36] you're ill-fame he's a prophet he'll
[1:08:38] know exactly where you made that money
[1:08:43] oh
[1:08:47] she says oh there must be
[1:08:49] something wrong with me
[1:08:53] sight never tell you make you think
[1:08:55] something's wrong with you
[1:08:57] there's something wrong with me I can't
[1:08:59] do this
[1:09:01] I just can't do this I must be crazy
[1:09:04] and the tears began to flow down her
[1:09:06] cheeks and he said but I can't stand to
[1:09:09] look at him the way he looked
[1:09:13] and she said the tears rolled down his
[1:09:16] cheeks
[1:09:17] because nobody made him
[1:09:21] there said Jesus crossed over in the
[1:09:23] corner like a Wallflower and everybody
[1:09:25] passes by him and she said I've got to
[1:09:27] do something
[1:09:29] brothers and sisters when nobody else
[1:09:31] will praise God we've got to do
[1:09:33] something when all of the world is
[1:09:36] serving Satan and worshiping the evil
[1:09:38] age we've got to do something
[1:09:41] I don't care what your past is
[1:09:44] if you've been to Calvary do something
[1:09:51] he said listen to this he said you know
[1:09:53] there's something about women
[1:09:55] he said I wish to God they would use
[1:09:58] more of it because there's something
[1:09:59] about them they don't stand in Wonder
[1:10:02] like men do he said no men he said men
[1:10:05] try to stand around and figure it out
[1:10:07] but women do what's on their hearts if
[1:10:11] God lays something on your hearts women
[1:10:13] men children I don't care who you are do
[1:10:16] it
[1:10:18] she said I've just got to do it she
[1:10:20] picked up that little sock full of every
[1:10:22] penny she had
[1:10:24] every penny she had
[1:10:27] and she goes down to the street and goes
[1:10:29] into the store and the store keeper
[1:10:31] harshly looks at her and says what do
[1:10:32] you want
[1:10:36] what do you want
[1:10:38] and she says I want the best Alabaster
[1:10:41] Box you got
[1:10:43] precious
[1:10:45] I want the very best because he deserves
[1:10:48] the best
[1:10:49] I want the best perfume I want the best
[1:10:52] box you've got in the store
[1:10:57] it cost me
[1:11:02] that's what we want to do is give our
[1:11:03] best
[1:11:05] the prophet said give your best give him
[1:11:07] your best give him your best life get
[1:11:09] him your best songs give him your best
[1:11:10] talent give him your everything you got
[1:11:12] give him your feet give him your hands
[1:11:15] give him your eyes give him your mouth
[1:11:17] give him your ears give him your soul
[1:11:19] give him your heart give him your praise
[1:11:21] give him everything you got because he
[1:11:23] deserves the best have you ever heard
[1:11:26] that that's a lot of giveness give give
[1:11:28] give give I want to give everything I
[1:11:30] have to you God
[1:11:32] and this little woman here this little
[1:11:34] ill-famed harlot
[1:11:36] says I've got every penny I've ever made
[1:11:45] and the prophet said
[1:11:47] they all knew her
[1:11:51] I can't help but to wonder what he meant
[1:11:54] when he said that
[1:11:56] all the Pharisees knew her
[1:12:06] she took that little box under her arm
[1:12:10] they said she tucked it under her arm
[1:12:12] and she started knocking one with an
[1:12:15] elbow
[1:12:16] making her way get out of my way I've
[1:12:18] got a mission I'm on a boat I got
[1:12:20] somewhere to be and she's got that
[1:12:21] little Alabaster Box and she's knocking
[1:12:23] them Pharisees out of the way and so she
[1:12:25] just keeps moving and moving and moving
[1:12:27] until she gets to him
[1:12:29] brothers and sisters so many times we
[1:12:31] stopped before we ever get there
[1:12:32] sometimes we gotta just get our elbows
[1:12:34] up and start knocking demons out of the
[1:12:36] way and says I've got a right to get to
[1:12:38] the throne of God
[1:12:40] and she finds herself there standing
[1:12:42] before God
[1:12:44] the only place you could ever find rest
[1:12:46] for her soul and he says she finds
[1:12:49] herself helpless
[1:12:54] that's when I find myself worshiping God
[1:12:56] the most
[1:12:58] when I find myself hopeless and helpless
[1:13:01] and says she falls down
[1:13:05] she's falling prostrate down at Jesus's
[1:13:08] feet his dirty stinking feet that nobody
[1:13:11] cared about as she falls down there at
[1:13:14] his feet and the tears begin to run down
[1:13:16] her cheek because she's guilty
[1:13:21] and he said the tears begin to flow down
[1:13:24] her cheek and she's boo-hoo and she's
[1:13:26] crying what is she doing she's pouring
[1:13:28] out herself before God and she's
[1:13:30] worshiping God
[1:13:33] and she's boohoo and she's crying and
[1:13:36] she sees him sitting there with 30 feet
[1:13:39] and she's beside herself
[1:13:42] do you think anybody else in the room
[1:13:44] existed at that moment in time
[1:13:46] no
[1:13:48] and we got to get to a place in our
[1:13:49] lives that we don't care who's around us
[1:13:51] what's going on around us when it's
[1:13:53] between us and God that nothing else
[1:13:55] matters we get beside ourselves
[1:13:57] so that we can get to Jesus
[1:14:00] she was beside herself tears rolling
[1:14:02] down her cheeks and before you know it
[1:14:05] she was standing at the fountain of love
[1:14:10] foreign
[1:14:13] how good is our God
[1:14:18] these are dignitaries wouldn't even take
[1:14:21] time to give him perfume they wouldn't
[1:14:23] take time to wash the dust off his feet
[1:14:25] they wouldn't take time to let him wash
[1:14:27] his face they wouldn't give him all to
[1:14:29] anoint himself so that he was
[1:14:31] presentable but they left it cutting in
[1:14:34] a corner
[1:14:38] the very Fountain Of Love
[1:14:42] it's all in our approach
[1:14:45] it's all in our approach
[1:14:47] and she began to get so excited and her
[1:14:50] hair fell down
[1:14:52] and those curls all done up they fell
[1:14:55] down and she began to wipe his feet with
[1:14:57] tears
[1:14:59] as she began they didn't even give him a
[1:15:01] towel and her tears as she began to wash
[1:15:03] and massage his feet and her hair falls
[1:15:06] down and she wipes his feet with her
[1:15:08] hair
[1:15:09] to get the dirt and the manure off of
[1:15:13] his feet from the travels
[1:15:15] and she is worshiping and worshiping and
[1:15:17] he said what is that he said it's tears
[1:15:20] from a fountain of a pen repenting heart
[1:15:25] and she says I'm so wretched I'm so
[1:15:28] miserable
[1:15:32] oh Lord God
[1:15:34] and her glory laying at his feet wiping
[1:15:37] his feet
[1:15:42] tears streaked down her cheeks
[1:15:45] like fountains
[1:15:48] and says she picked up that Alabaster
[1:15:50] Box
[1:15:52] she wasn't done
[1:15:54] she wasn't done
[1:15:56] she was sitting there pouring out her
[1:15:58] heart to God and recognizing who he was
[1:16:00] not some dirty man in a corner but the
[1:16:04] Fountain of Life and she's now washed
[1:16:06] and ministered to him so she takes the
[1:16:08] alabaster box and breaks the lid off of
[1:16:10] it and pours the most precious all upon
[1:16:13] Jesus's face upon his feet as she begins
[1:16:15] to anoint him as she begins to wipe it
[1:16:17] with the oil signifying the Holy Spirit
[1:16:22] foreign
[1:16:25] Jesus
[1:16:27] listen to what the prophet said he said
[1:16:29] it was like a fountain running off her
[1:16:31] face and she's washing his feet she
[1:16:33] picks up the alabaster box and pours it
[1:16:35] all over she didn't just sprinkle it she
[1:16:38] pours it all all of her living all of
[1:16:42] her glory all of her money all of
[1:16:45] everything even all of her heart pouring
[1:16:47] the tears As She lays at Jesus feet
[1:16:54] I've said it's not always about singing
[1:16:58] it's not always about saying hallelujah
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:02] sometimes we just need to fall prostrate
[1:17:06] at the feet of Jesus
[1:17:08] and say Lord
[1:17:09] I'm a miserable I'm I'm a wretch I'm
[1:17:13] miserable without you I need that
[1:17:15] Fountain of love I need that Fountain of
[1:17:17] Life I need I need from you Lord because
[1:17:19] I know you're able
[1:17:23] and she
[1:17:24] five
[1:17:25] finds herself standing there I got
[1:17:28] something to say to you
[1:17:30] can you imagine how those words must
[1:17:32] have hushed the crowd
[1:17:35] no doubt all these Pharisees were
[1:17:37] watching as she's ministering to Jesus
[1:17:40] and he says Simon
[1:17:43] now that I've got your attention
[1:17:46] I've got something to say to you
[1:17:49] I come into your house you bid me to
[1:17:51] come so I came
[1:17:53] he said you asked me to come you know
[1:17:55] that's what we do if we ask for Jesus
[1:17:57] he's going to come
[1:17:58] are you ready to entertain him when you
[1:18:00] ask him to come over
[1:18:02] that's a good question
[1:18:04] Simon I got to tell you this you asked
[1:18:06] me to come over you bid me to come but
[1:18:08] you never gave me water
[1:18:10] you never gave me water to wash my feet
[1:18:12] I come into your chamber you never gave
[1:18:15] me all to anoint my feet and my head and
[1:18:18] my face you never gave me a kiss of
[1:18:20] Fellowship
[1:18:24] you did none of this for me but it's
[1:18:27] almond do you see this little ill-famed
[1:18:29] Harlot that you all know
[1:18:33] she has not ceased to worship me since
[1:18:36] she saw me
[1:18:38] she has not said words sin cease to
[1:18:41] worship me since I came into this room
[1:18:43] since she was able to make contact to me
[1:18:46] and I want you to know her sins
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:59] let me tell you if we just lay down and
[1:19:03] worshiped Jesus
[1:19:05] you'll find your sins are not as big as
[1:19:07] what you think they are
[1:19:09] I'm not saying we don't need repentance
[1:19:11] we need repentance just like she needed
[1:19:13] repentance we need the cross just like
[1:19:16] she needed a cross
[1:19:18] and Jesus went to that cross and some of
[1:19:21] the greatest
[1:19:23] words of worship that was ever uttered
[1:19:28] let's stand to our feet
[1:19:31] you love the Lord tonight
[1:19:42] I tell you I'm uh that story is one of
[1:19:44] my favorites
[1:19:45] and I'm humbled by it every time I hear
[1:19:48] it and every time I rehearse it
[1:19:50] the humility that that little lady
[1:19:54] I say a little later because she became
[1:19:56] a changed person
[1:20:01] the humility that she had to have in
[1:20:03] worshiping God
[1:20:06] but she just wanted to know
[1:20:08] I want to give you Lord the worship and
[1:20:11] the praise that is due to you
