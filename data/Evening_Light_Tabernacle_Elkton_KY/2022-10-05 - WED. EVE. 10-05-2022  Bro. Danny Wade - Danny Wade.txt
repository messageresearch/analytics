labereth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercising him he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in the heart so that no man can find uh the the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end I know that there is no good in them but but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it is the gift of God amen may God that is blessing to the ring the word you can be seated now the the title of the the service tonight is purpose it's just simply purpose that that's the the very the very title just such a simple title just purpose because I believe that that is that is simply the the Simplicity of of life is that one word purpose and and I believe everything that God has created he created it for a purpose now now even even uh the animals the the the elephants the the lions that everything that God created from the from trees trees create oxygen for us to breathe for us to live and the oceans the water so that at all life can and live all of these things have purpose from the food chain of animals because if if one of them wasn't there then the whole thing might collapse God made it so perfect that that everything works together in in the way that it goes and so and so um if all these things have a purpose how much more do us being made in the image of God being children of God Sons and Daughters of God how much more of a purpose has God given us as as those other things that that aren't as important not see me not as important as what God has made and God knew what he was doing when he made us for a greater purpose than all of those things foreign I heard this one time and it really hit me met men without purpose or men and women without purpose distract themselves with pleasure that's that is that's so true because if we we don't have a calling we don't have a purpose we don't know what in the world we're doing where we're headed then and we get to the place where we feel like we're we're nothing we just want to find something for Comfort some kind of distraction because we every human being everything has to have a purpose and a goal and and that purpose I'll get to to that in a little bit but here what um brother Brandon said he has a purpose in your life each individual that no that no one else on the face of the Earth can take your place God has got something for you you're you're made like that that you you was did that way for a purpose God is Sovereign in his work and he even in things different we different one from another we notice in the animal life we find out in the animal life there's one animal God made a beast of a burden like like the horse and he he has to work and the cow is a sacrifice and but the the lion the tiger runs a force without any labor or anything he made a great big animal like an elephant and then and made a little bitty it felt like a mouse now who is there to tell God what to do and how to do it he does it in his own way and and he makes the mountains he makes the deserts he makes disease he makes the planes he he makes one kind of tree hardwood palm and so forth he does it he makes men different he makes us each one a different place and a palm tree can never can never be a hickory a hickory tree can never be a palm nobody can take your place and you you shouldn't try to take anybody else's place because you are an individual to God and God has a purpose for you he made you thus you say why did he do it he is Sovereign he's got a reason for it being that way that that's exactly right right and and for I think for everyone for we always look at uh someone as as in like you see other people doing all these great things and we think I would love to do all that anything uh can I I somehow uh do that and sometimes we get to a place where we're trying to um trying so hard to get to some place and and and work our way way up to that that place the ace where it and when it's not even our calling in and I've I've had dreams in in different things when I was younger like I want to be a soccer player that that was about my my brother's or his idea as well we're gonna be a professional soccer players when they grow up we're we're gonna be and then I start thinking well maybe there's some way after realizing that that we should have something um to glorify God and maybe I could be this great big soccer player and then glorify God in that well well you know that that's the thing trying to find something and and then uh squeeze in your own little ideas well I can do it this way in my own way and and then we we start trying to do trying to glorify a God in a way the a that he doesn't want us to do it he has a specific way for us to specifically for us and on a personal level instead of of our own ideas and our own way of wanting to do things which us as human beings we always try to do something in in our way rather than God's way sometimes even if it is to glorify God and and that is that is true and let's see here God has a time and reason for for that time to fulfill all his words God knows just exactly what he's going to do we don't we just have to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows and there's nothing going and to go wrong with with that he he has a has plan to do it's all it all has to come about there has to be sometimes rugged and hard things to only bring out the real and true nature of that object and it most of the time it's if it's a well every time if it's if it's a calling it's not always easy and I I realize that it's not always easy some people think well if you it's something you're passionate about and it's a calling that you have you'll every single morning you're going to be happy to hear that alarm clock get up and you're going to be all all joyful about all the time and you're just gonna get to work and it's gonna be all cupcakes and rainbows and easy because you love doing it well someone put it like this well it might might be something that you're passionate about but you're always going to have struggles and you're always just as in in um I'll put it this way put in a different way but I'll put it this way it's in like you love to get to go this is a very hypothetical thing you love to go sledding let's say during during it it's it's like um there's lots notes how you love to go sledding you have to actually go up the hill and it's hard to go up the hill sometimes it depending on how steep that Hill is and get up the hill in order for you to slide down on the hill so it'll be hard to get to that place sometimes but it'll be something that that it will be something a calling is something that you will be passionate about you know even though it's not always easy you know rain is born in a jagged ragged lightning strobe thundering skies and if we didn't have rain we wouldn't live but you see what it takes to bring rain thunder lightning flashing anger and out of there comes rain a seed Must Die rot corrupt smell and go back to the dust of the Earth in order to bring forth New Life it takes the pounding of gold turned over and over back and forth and pounded until all the the dross is taken out of it not because it shines because iron pyrite what is known as full US Gold shines like real gold but you you put the two together and you set them one and you set them out to one side and you can hardly tell them apart but put them together and you you can tell it and the beater always has to beat till he sees his own image reflecting in the gold and God sets a time and a purpose for everything that he does there is nothing happening just accidentally to those that love the Lord and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie he said that that was so and everything has its time its season and it has its way and God is behind every move and and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong it's up to us those things are put Upon Us trials wonderings it's testing to see how we will react on an action amen um um the other day was a couple of weeks back I guess uh we're having a conversation at the at the barbershop it was a pretty a uh typical um Barbershop getting to know you kind of conversation and he he I was telling him about uh I'm gonna be I believe I'm going to be successful and I'm building this business this online business with my brother and stuff and and he was he was kind of giving me this lecture and he was telling me well are you passionate about bread boxes no not really I mean who is are you passionate about uh are you passionate about selling on Amazon well no not really and and he said well you know it's it's good to to get a job to get something that you want to want to do and make a living and and all that but he asked me what is your calling though and and and I said well I believe I'm called to be a preacher and he said why well why are you putting all your energy in trying to build this online business why are you putting all of your energy in doing this when and he said he said stop stop trying to be so focused on on how you're going to make money and start trying to focus on start focusing on on what your calling is and not calling will bring forth and you'll be blessed in that calling I thought wow that that's that really hit me yes he's exactly right focus on and I realized I I need to focus on my calling first on on what God has called me to do first before anything else before business before all these other things and and this is a barber he's not even much of a Christian either and he's telling me this and I thought wow you know uh he's exactly right but but he was also going on about uh telling me that that bread boxes are never going to sell so I thought you'd be surprised I mean you see a like there's a hundred thousand and searches at Bread Box a year a month on on Amazon but he was saying nah and nobody wake up in the morning it's like I think I'm gonna buy a bread box no I I told him well but we're a little bit deep into it right now we said you know we either make it but he told me you need to try something different as well you know because you can't just be doing that but don't just focus on on your on one I'm thinking and also I decided to learn to to do one thing really really well and you stick with that and and he said well like selling on Amazon's learn how to do that completely fully learn and everything he said he said I me as a barber he said he learned everything absolutely was became obsessed with being able to become a piper he said because that's what he believed it was his calling so I need to become obsessed about my calling and and just like like brother Brandon M said here he said give me a second here said hold yourself Clean and Clear to your calling stay with God's word and don't move for nothing and stay abide in your calling if he gives you a job out there as a farmer Farm good okay God bless you at it and pay your tithes and whatever it is your offerings to help the ministry go on if he made a mechanic out of you and bless you in that work stay with it and thank him for it see you just abide where God calls you and and I believe that there's there's many of you that that are already following your calling most of you probably especially saying that I'm in the minority of being a younger person so you know still starting out following my calling but but still it applies any to it to every one of us stick with with your colleague do the best that you can do at what God has gifted you to do amen this just what what it was just it's inspiration like I can I believe I I was thinking what what am I to preach on and then I started remembering it time and time again I kept seeing it even my own Barbershop at the barber shop telling me all these things so there are there are too many people that that don't know what their purpose is and don't care what it is and just live for themselves some people wonder what the point of life is that there actually there's a lot of people it's like what's the point in life and and I'm always thinking it's right in front of you this whole time and and yet they don't I don't see it because they're blinded by all the other things and all the shiny objects of this world and and then there are the people who wonder what their purpose is in life they believe that there's a purpose but they don't know what it is and and it's people that live their whole lives wondering what their purpose is in life believing that everyone has a purpose but always look in the wrong places always looking in the wrong places I know of so many people that that that are gifted talented there's lots of people that gifted it and and they don't follow it they're just like well I'm good at it but I don't you know I'm I don't see how it's ever gonna get anywhere in life you know it's it's the thing where where they're like well I don't know if I can you know I'm too shy excuses there's a lot of times people put excuses behind it to say that it's too hard to do it even though it's a calling and then and then and then one day God gets a hold of them and and and a lot of people run from their calling a lot of people run from especially as a calling to be a preacher they run from it I know someone and at a church camp he said he um you want to know something it was a a guy that I told him you you look like a preacher and he said well actually um uh during a service some someone well the preacher pointed it to me and prophesied over my life and said that you're going to be a preacher and he said he said well well I haven't I don't got enough like I don't guy enough evidence on that I'm just kind of waiting for something and I told him I I do believe that you're called to be a preacher I mean after especially after that I mean I you can wait for another state pray I told him yeah I told him pray for another sign stop just sitting there stagnant not doing anything about it if if you kind of feel that conviction on your heart pray hey that God will show you whether or you're meant to be a preacher or not all right now turn turn with me if you will to Romans chapter yes I think yeah the Romans chapter eight and verse 27. and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to those that love God and to them who are are the called according to his purpose amen I I believe that that because as we are are called to a purpose God God has set us apart set us apart he's he said and said and I chose you before the foundation of the world for this calling not not just to be a stagnant and and lukewarm type of Christian I chose you for a purpose I chose you first and for a greater calling and and it I I I felt that that burning in my heart when I I the the thing is that makes you have that that find out your purpose is getting closer to God and it was only until I started getting on fire for God that I found my purpose that that's it's that's how it is you have to get close to God otherwise how is God going to speak to you so sometimes he'll he'll speak to you and get you to a place where where you seek God and you seek to get closer to God and then and got to reveal things things to you when you get to the start seeking to do his perfect will that's how how you start figuring out what where your purpose is and and and once you figure out what your purpose is dude they're the best that you can and I think that especially us and people that get and to know that what their purpose is if if you're you can potentially lose that passion and lose that drive to to do it the best that you can and start slipping and start start fading out and and start getting in to a place where where we get distracted and and the and that the whole the whole goal for Satan is to to stop us from fulfilling our purpose on this Earth and and if he can do that get you to a place that that's the the whole point of what I was saying a men without purpose distract themselves with pleasure and that's how how it is not only to distract themselves with pleasure but they they go in and seek for a purpose in other things that are not their purpose and and when it's it's a horrible place to be into a place where where you know what your purpose is but you're not following it because of your own own thinking in your own desires and it's getting away from what and what uh your true purpose is and and what that purpose is is to glorify God all things were made to glorify God and anything then that is not glorifying God is not in in the purpose and it's not fulfilling in the the will of God it's stagnant it's lukewarm it's and and God doesn't want lukewarmness he wants everything that to glorify him it as a matter of fact even let's see here um the Proverbs 16 4 the Lord hath made all things even the wicked for the day of evil so even the devil is fulfilling the purpose of God even when wickedness on this Earth is fulfilling in the purpose of God and that that is and that is to bring out true character Out of Heaven out of us out of the the real ones to to that we would have a relationship with Jesus Christ and and bring out the best in us and and and the way God does that is by making it so that it's constantly evil around us that that um uh and the desire the human flesh desire to to do those evil things and to to be among the uh about among those those things but instead all that pleasure and everything else instead choose God and that's it how how God says it sets us apart to all those options are there but God knows those who who we are and chose us to to be apart from that and the reason that he I believe it's because predestination is God foreseen in the future of what the decisions that we would make and and that's how it is that predestinated scene God's uh seeing these people will choose me over or evil these people will will set aside all these worldly things and choose me and therefore I will bless them and therefore uh I will bring them in in a Rapture and I will amen help help me preacher [Applause] it's been because God set a purpose in US God's odds that purpose that that seed in us at the end that true desire that passion within us that that become that gets brought out in in the right season different callings can over different times in our lives sometimes like like my my purpose at one time was to speak speak and it still is but but even more so to to help those around me at my old job I used to work at and and help help them to grow closer to God and I believe I have and I've touched in people's lives through through that because because that was my calling at that time at that job and and wherever God puts you wherever God puts you God has a purpose in it and that's the and to glorify him and and I don't ever want I don't ever want to be set in a place that God put me and sit still and do nothing [Music] when God put a desire air down inside my flesh is like I don't know it's kind of uncomfortable see it's kind of uncomfortable I I don't feel I always feel like doing it but but then and then you but then you get yourself together and say but this is what God wants me to do and so I'm gonna do it and you and you do tell that devil shut up uh devil I'm I'm going to do what God has called me to do and and and just just having that prayer every night and and every morning that God help me to do your perfect will today help me to to do your will Lord if that is is that your true desire on your heart that that's going to come out sooner rather than later amen and because God gets you into that place and it must be a desired air down on the inside to do exactly that foreign I think this is yeah this is influence um 63. it's unscriptural for you you or I to impersonate anyone else right so be what you are and be a good one and fulfill your purpose so others can see you if you're if you're a housewife be a real one if if your husband be a genuine see and if you're a deacon be a genuine or a preacher whatever you are but don't try to take someone else's place and and over here uh in uh 58 the queen of the South it says here and if if that's a gift God's get give you Brethren stay with it that's where God wants you you'll never make an eye if you're in if you're an ear you remember that you'll only mess up the body until you get your right place and abide there in your calling if your Deacon stay Deacon you're a pastor say a pastor don't try to be something that you're not be just what you are if you're a finger or a fingernail be a good one God will give you your place in glory amen that is exactly right amen if y'all ain't going man go ahead and go ahead and amen myself see see uh in Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ that's a good works which God hath before Dane that we should walk in them for for by him in Colossians 1 16 where by him were all things created that are in heaven and are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominance or principalities or powers or things were created by Him and for him amen there is um you know I I felt that yeah well you can and some people think like this well God called me to do this but I don't think I'm cut out for this it's it's not it doesn't feel like it's something that I would be good at doing and I felt that because I had stage fright and I don't feel like I'm cut out for the job why would God pick me to do this and and and but the real the real thing is is that the re it's just like God uh take me he was he was really reaching fires like at the bottom of the parent well I'd have got no one else to do this I'm just going to pick Daniel over here to to do this as well he's not really much of a he's not going to really do very well but I'll just go ahead and call him no that's that's not it that that's if God called if God called you to to do it if God God placed that calling in your heart Whatever It Is God doesn't make any mistakes it he doesn't make any mistakes so even if you start out being horrible at whatever it seems that God called you to do horrible at it you keep on doing it as long as you know that it's got psychology to do that you stick with that and God's Gonna going to bless you and God's going to to prosper you in that because he has he has called you to do that and it's it it really is something to anything that we we do is think that we're we're not good enough for what whatever we're we're supposed to be doing and we we feel like we're not cut cut out for this we're not we can't do it like God wants us to do it and I'm not trying to say anyone's uh insecure here but we all get insecure sometimes about what we're supposed to be doing and feel like we ain't doing it good enough and and then and we we go to God why didn't you call me to do this this is is so hard why would you choose me for this it doesn't make sense just like like Jonah wants to wanting to run away from me because it seemed like such a difficult task he was supposed to go to a multitude of people um however many thousands it was and tell them and to repent and this is them it's like it was something that I believe it was something like God sending in this man to go to uh over to Sodom and get more and to to tell them to repent because it was the sin was so bad because God was going to destroy the whole place if they didn't repent and but God called what one man to go in and and tell them to repent and and they did but saw them Sodom and Gomorrah would wouldn't repent under any circumstances and that's why it was destroyed made but but that's the thing such a wickedness in that land and got a gay gave them a chance God God gave Nineveh a chance because as God gives Every Nation a chance God God gave United States a chance they rejected it they said we're not we're not going to allow this way and they shut it they shot Jesus Christ out and when they did that and that that's when it's it God knew that that they were going to reject him and therefore it was written in the Bible that it would be it would it would come to to this point but God still gave him a chance [Music] and and God also knew that Nineveh would turn from their wicked way and turn to a God but uh and God gives everyone and everything a chance and that's why God gave us a chance God uh instead of destroying everything and and just starting in New God God sent the Lord Jesus Christ that that he would have a greater that he would have a purpose instead of just throwing away of his creation because they turned their face against him but but God seen that there would be a people that that would follow his purpose and that would fulfill his purpose and and and so he created this New Covenant with with his people amen and so so uh many every a human being on on the face of the earth I believe has a purpose but they can choose to follow that purpose or reject it God had a purpose for for her and the whole world that uh Jesus Christ died for for the whole world not not just fast for for us but that the whole world and everyone in the whole world would have a chance to fulfill his purpose but but yet they rejected him and here uh in let's see and be not conformed to this world that be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what what is good and acceptable and perfect will of God and this is for everyone whosoever will let him drink of the the water the air that flows whosoever will and and Jesus in The Bride and say come and drink [Music] every human being has a purpose God had had a purpose for us God had a purpose for every everything all creation has a purpose even even the devil which is hard hard to believe but even the devil has a purpose because God doesn't want a bunch of robots he wants a bunch of people that chooses him rather than sin all right amen it's let's see and um Jeremiah 29 11 for for I know the thoughts and that I think towards you saying the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end in other translations it will say I I actually this is the one one verse I like another translation and and not I'm not of able to uh to what was it and not of evil but to to um Can someone not not to evil but uh to um is Prosper to to prosper you and and not to harm you yeah not able to to give you an expected end and that that just kind of it is a little bit more depressing than the Prosper you into but all right Romans well actually yeah um yeah Romans 12 2 and I don't read that anyways um see here thank you yeah I'll just start here listen I feel that that way too I feel that any man that's born of the spirit that loves God and loves his word has a purpose in that God has a purpose in turning Paul around did not he say I'm going to show in him his glory god had it at a purpose when he saved me I am determined to do his will not to add to it to take away from it Revelation 12 12 19 says whosoever shall do it will will be his part taking out of The Book of Life [Music] I'm determined to never add one thing and of my own opinion to that word I'm determined to read it just the way it is and ask God that I'll open in my heart and receive it work it through me Lord others my see mate become salty in something real in others might see yes sir now if if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute you can't have say you can't say well my my church is my absolute my Creed is my absolute if Christ is your absolute believe Christ's word there is no other way to do it yeah you know I think about the the time that he saved me I'll I'll tell you why I stand the way I do not to be different I made myself clear on that I hope I hope but the but when Christ saved me there were millions of people groping in sin when when he saved me he had a purpose in doing it he had a purpose in Saving me he he just seen in and ignore Ms like me and somehow or another when when there was plenty of smart men more able men men I could do it it me here or with not even hardly a doctor there's a Divinity and philosophy and so forth but when Christ saved me he had purpose in doing it or he'd have never saved me amen amen and if and if anyone in here that feels like and you're a little bit lost that you don't know what where your purpose is there's a just pray that God would show you the way and and have it in your mind and and in your heart I want to do the perfect will of God get get to that place where you're you're truly Desiring to do the perfect will of God amen um as the musicians come it's it it's like it's like this there's there there's people that out there that think that they can and do this and do they do that and they go out and be somebody pick somebody or be a preacher without it being in God's calling because they want to do something great for God but yet it's not in them and God didn't ever place it in them to do that and there's people that and Satan's out there to try to get a false a false false purpose and people those hearts to where they think I I'm called to do this and then to go and do something that is not their calling is not their purpose and and and it is in it's in Satan to to get people to Fall Away false purpose and give them false hope and and give them get all these people today out in the world thinking that they have some kind of of purpose and and yet I all that they do is is not is um glorifying Satan and they think oh I'm I'm this is my purpose this is my calling and yet it's not because uh Satan is out there to deceive and the Bible says that the whole world would be deceived if there were pasta and even the elect if it was possible but it's not possible and and we know that uh what our purpose is in this life and what God has called us as to do as a people and we will not be deceived into following a main purpose we we may end up going along on a vain purpose that is not our calling but but God will correct this one at one time or another and we'll figure out what our true purpose our true calling is as long as we truly are sincere before him in in seeking in that calling and and and then and and some some cases it's a different calling it in a different season that God has called on us too and and um even in the time we are now regardless of what what age we are different and calling in a different in time not I'm not talking about Divine and calling and the whole purpose of your life if it's sort of thing but in a a smaller sense as in like in this current circumstances that you're in that God chooses is to to bring glory to his name and and and like I was saying in like a different job in a different place in a different in in time and and to affect different people's lives foreign that way and and sometimes we don't see it and we pass up opportunities that God put right in front of us to share the gospel to different people and and yet we get so so prideful and it or get so shy in ourselves to think I can't do that I'm going way too too far out my comfort zone where even though you have it in you that that you're that's pulling you to that and and yet we choose to bottle up and just walk away I felt that that many I believe I felt that many times where you feel God pulling you hey go talk to this person pray for them and you just I don't want to get out of my company choose someone else to do that but that that's that's how it we I guess sometimes it's it's no that's just my own thoughts just walk away and and when God's been calling us for that that purpose in someone else's lives sometimes it is to to help someone else in their life and [Music] in um I'm I believe at one time at the place I I worked at it was a a I I've seen them uh a guy he was like this he was just holding his jaw he was and I said hey what was wrong what's with you know what what's up and he he would he said he said oh it's just I got too thick I got really bad toothache and I can't hardly work it's it's been bothering me for a while and and I and he said I'm going to go to the the dentist after a while after this and and then and after he walked out and I just felt like something on on the inside told me go pray for him I'm gonna go go lay it hands on doesn't the Bible say hey that that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall all of these things that added us as Christians can do now are supposed to do that that's our calling to do that the Bible says that when that these are the signs that will follow them in that belief and and as I felt that I I just had to and it just kept burning within me it just okay I was like I was kind of getting a comfort zone but I was like you know I I got I gotta I gotta do this it's just you know I I can't take it anymore it's it's just really burning it in the and I have to do it it's not it's not just myself I believe it's God telling me to do this and so I went up to him and and I I said hey uh you know I I first of all I asked him if he would say I I it was a while back I think I asked him um are you a Christian do you believe in in um God you believe in me well yeah I'm a Christian and and I said well let me pray for you then and and he said okay and and so I laid hands on it I prayed for him and he said so that feels a bit better and then after you left the and then it just after a little bit I was like I felt that Bernie within me again go you know pray over him again and it's like what you know I just prayed for him like yeah you know go tell him that if he believes he will recover don't just tell him uh I'll just pray for you and and I and I I and I finally went back to act him and I said do you believe that well I told him you know by faith if you have faith in enough to believe that you will be be healed you and you you will be healed in and and he said it said well oh yeah I told I I just went on and on about Chad if he has faith enough to to believe in if he will will recover and that then it is a a promise that that the Bible says and he said yeah okay and and I I I said and well let me pray for you again and and this time well it hands on him I just felt the the power of God I go through me and I said in the name of Jesus Christ you're healed and and and instantly he he said is oh my goodness it's completely better oh my goodness I I was I praise God that's um that's amazing and he just went on and on telling everybody that that what had happened he would just say and and when he went on uh he was saying hey Danny healed me and I told him no no I didn't I I said said Jesus Christ healed you and it was because of your faith and and and he said Ed well oh you're exactly right and I it that that's a one one of the most or the most powerful testimony is that I've had a healing Inc that I've I've witnessed I mean I say that I've witnessed it because it wasn't me that did it it was the power of God it was God doing it through me hey man it was I mean many times like that and that happened but if if God ever puts a burning in your in your heart to do something just just do it if you feel and you know it's right according to the Bible God Satan would never put in your mind to go and pray for someone Satan and once the opposite he wants you to to just give in and then he's opposite well you don't want to get outside comfort zone you know it's kind of awkward especially at work I mean what what are you doing you know people's gonna look at you people's gonna look at you funny and and and once I let all of that go once I let all that go and and I said I gotta do this because it's just burning in my heart and I feel the leading of the Holy Spirit to do this and you feel that and that conviction in your heart to do that just follow it it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks because the whole purpose of this life is to glorify God bring glory to God and and simple simply a put our Satan always tries to use our comfort in our area human and this to try to get us to not want to do it and be shy and not uh and not do it be too shy and to to want to just hide away in your comfort zone it and then hope hope that see we get scared that we make mistakes and we get scared that that especially a fully following what God has called us to do it and I I'm guilty of it too I get just before I get up here and sometimes I'm like I hope I don't make any mistakes but but that's that's how it is us as human beings we make mistakes and that and I I think I read somewhere the only person that doesn't make mistakes is the person that doesn't do anything and and so if if we follow what God has called us to do and that's all that matters it doesn't make it matter if we make mistakes we all make mistakes as human beings but if we can it doesn't matter if anybody judges us either and I have to take this in and and we we all have to take that in it doesn't matter if anyone judges us as long as we're following the purpose and the calling of anything that God placed in in our heart it doesn't matter if we make any mistakes we're going to make mistakes but we have to yield to his calling and yield to his purpose in in each and every one of our lives amen stand with me if you will let's pray Lord God I I I believe that you put this message on my heart for a reason and I I pray that that has been it's been a blessing too even if it's just been a blessing to one person as I said if I could help one person and if if you could help me to get myself out the way that I could just help that one person just that even if it's just one person I pray that it's it's everyone but if it even if you just touch that one person that was it's just really deep in the hearts of just one person doesn't matter who it is as long as As you can and do that Lord that's that'll be enough for me and Lord I pray that you'll help you'll help each and every one of us to fulfill your purpose that and that you're that god-given purpose that you put in each and every one of our hearts and and to not for us to not worry about making so many mistakes and looking like a weirdo in front of other people and and looking like this Holy Roller and all that and we us as human beings we don't want to have any Shame Shame is something that us that's in the human nature to run away from but let us not be ashamed of you Lord let us not be ashamed let us get and get to that place where we don't care what anybody else thinks that let's put this human and and nature of wanting to be a keep our have a have a um a um Persona that we put out in front of us that are um I can't think of the word but it's [Music] to to be it's that um [Music] this this place this person that that everybody else sees this image yeah there you go the image that we have want to keep our image we we get to the place where I I have this image and and I I don't want to let it down I don't want to anyone to think anything else of me I have an image to hold I have I have my status that I have but let Lord help us let that go when it's needed when you put that desire on our heart to to go to to minister to someone that needs it to not not be stuck with this this I I can't get out of my comfort zone I just want to be this this man that everybody's any scenes that everybody thinks is not weird and it's cool and and I'm putting this in the sense of uh uh a Young Person's kind of language kind of say but that's how how it is and and Lord help us help us to follow your purpose in each and every one of our lives and to do the best that we can Lord for your for your glory Lord for that is our purpose on it in this life in this life our purpose is to give you glory and honor all things were created for your glory Lord not our own not for our own our own image our own light like this and what what we want people to see us as this great big sick somebody or anything like that
