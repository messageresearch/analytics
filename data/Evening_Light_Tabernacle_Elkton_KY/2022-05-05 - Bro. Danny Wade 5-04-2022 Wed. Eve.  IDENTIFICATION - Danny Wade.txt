there my brother perishing hearing him saying and thought what an honor to be with the soldier in the presence of the lord and you know i was thinking i you know how we get in a hurry in our life and sometimes god just has to show us that we're in too big a hurry we're going to leave and i was trying to work and get everything done this week and give a testimony of how good god is to us and my back and my shoulder been bothering me so i went to chiropractor and i told him i said i've never spent this much money in my life for somebody to inflict pain on me and i was hurting so i thought well i'll just put ice on it and and talked to brother luke and he sent me a picture of his family and i'd called him and we talked for a while and and i thought well i'm gonna go mow one of my appointments i had didn't come through and i said because i don't want to wait till i get back and i always mow up the hillside and i was always do it real fast and i was going real fast and i i almost make it up and i just hit it reverse and come back down well when i did the mower started turning over with me on it i thought oh my god what have i done and it scared me because it was running so i thought well i couldn't get my hand to hit the button to push the blades off so like me i just jumped off and rolled went rolling down the hill and the lawn mower goes the other way and it shut off after i ejected from the seat the only thing that was hurt was my back and my pride and my neighbor they're never home hey buddy are you okay i'm fine thank you i got back on my mower and started and i said thank you lord for watching over us and it's right there but that little creek that runs through there and i could easily just roll off in there and i thought you know sometimes we just get in too big a hurry i said lord forgive me and thank you for watching over me i want to give him praise because he's always there he's our little in the valley he's whatever we need tonight whatever you need if you need healing if you need deliverance he's here let's stand tonight and sing that course as brother daniel comes tonight and in the presence of jehovah i don't know about you but i

amen amen um turn with me if you will to um revelations 3. and and we'll begin with uh verse 15. i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou were cold or hot so so then because thou art luke warm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesight that thou mayest see as many as i ha i love i rebuke and chasten these zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne you can be seated may god as blessing to the ring of his word um you know this is the uh this is the third time of uh me getting sick before service you know that just shows that that satan's scared he's he's scared that he's scared of um he's scared of my potential i believe i believe i believe that satan satan and must not know something that that might happen in tonight ain't um something that might might happen tonight that might change people's lives like he doesn't he doesn't want me up here satan doesn't and he'll do whatever he can to get to to to keep me out of this pulpit amen now um what we just read was um the about the church of this day now the people of this day um the churches um are lukewarm they uh and they don't know it they don't know who they are the the churches of this state uh the baptists the methodists all of them they don't know who they are and and there's there's people today that uh like the um p people all deciding that they're going to be they can't decide whether they're a male or a female they can't decide if they can't decide what um what gender they are and and they're like who am i like they're wondering who are they they don't know who they are and so so i was i was just thinking about this i uh the the churches of today don't know who they are they don't know who they are but but we do know who we are tonight if and they they think that well um you know we're uh you know and they said someone will say well i'm a baptist i'm a methodist or whatever i'm a christian right and but but yet this bible well we'll tell will say something different and and yet they they look at um a church or so someone else who who where do they look to to see who they are and now uh let's see what um here what uh brother branham said and and that's what we we want to look at tonight i want to look at me i want you to look at yourself that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times and i want to see myself in in god's looking glass and then how many how many wants to look in in god's looking glass see what what does god say who does god say i am not not who my church says i am who who my religion says i am because if anything will show you where you're standing it's hit this book there is no book like it because it is all truth i don't say that other books are not true but i i know this one is true it's all truth because it's the word of god now jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when when he reflected his life to us through through the word and what we should see when we look into god's mirror we should see ourself identified with him that's a perfect example amen when we um sometimes we we get caught up with like well i'm uh i'm um a carpenter i'm a i i do this you someone will ask you who who are you oh like my name is daniel wade i am a christian i um i am a person who um what whatever it's like it's like you'll go on about like you're this or that about like your character and who you are and when we we follow jesus christ we must follow this word he's the the perfect example so when and people look at you do they see jesus christ that's that's really the only thing that matters now jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through through the word what we we should see when when we look into god's mirror we should see ourself identified with him that's the perfect example i probably didn't read this twice but anyways um now i remember there's this person at work at the place i used to work at um her name uh was um autumn um one day i asked her if she knew jesus she said yeah she's a christian but yet yet i've seen her her life she she drunk and smoke and all this stuff and and i was surprised like why do you say you're a christian when when your life doesn't show it your life doesn't reflect who jesus christ is and and so i told her that that i i told her to be christian she would have to follow the word and she shut me down and told me she believes differently you know she just looks at the bible a little bit differently like um she says oh well you know if i follow jesus christ i believe that he died on the cross for me and that's it that's it that's all and but yet her her life doesn't show that her life doesn't show who her life reflects who she is see your life reflects who who you are it reflects who who you are and and if you aren't living according to this word then [Music] then and that doesn't mean it makes you a a liar when you say you're a christian but don't follow this word now but we find out that as as we go along through life that that our character molds the image that we are each one knows that you as as you live so so as your character molds you to what you are now now you have seen people that just love to be around yet they they might not exactly be in your bracket of society and again and they might be a different race the colored or the brown or the yellow but they're just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence because each person is a a little dynamo of their own and and you you put out an atmosphere and then and then you see people that that were not noble people but yet you were always glad to get away from them it's just that they they create an atmosphere around where where you are nothing nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like the atmosphere they they're in in their character creates whatever they are makes them what they are amen now um like i was saying um that they are um poor and blind and naked and they don't know it and and they um go on saying saying oh i'm a good person i i do this i do that well this this bible um if you don't if they don't follow this bible exactly then then um they're a liar and and when they when people say oh i'm a christian i follow god but don't follow this word and they're a liar excuse me amen um so uh in revelations 3 5 it says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and and i will not blow his name out of the book of life i will confess his name before my father be in before his angels satan will try try to tell us who who we we are he says you are nothing you you you claim to be a christian but yet yeah here you are failing all the time and and falling down and messing up look at you you're nothing but but uh someone who who's uh who pretends to be a christian you satan will try to tell you that you are not uh who who you say you are who you claim to be satan will try to pull you down and tell you that that you you are not who you are not a part of this bride you are not going into rapture satan will always put these things in you and try to to tell you these things that aren't true but don't listen to it because satan is nothing but a liar and and and this bible says you are sons and daughters of god and and whatever satan and tries to put in there tries to twist something he always tries to do that but but we gotta take god out of his word and believe it over everything that satan tries to say because as uh as you are chosen you are i i chose you before the foundation of the world i'll you are a a son you are my daughter you are says you are because this is god's word and that is god god speaking and god speaks through his word and and and if you believe that over everything satan tries to tell you then then um that then you'll be unstoppable satan won't be able to put anything in it and to stop you he won't be able to say anything to stop you if you just believe that word and and not accept anything that satan tries to tell you man there's some people that that say they try to they find their identity in different things there's people that i idolize hollywood stars they they fall they fall so so much in love with their idol that they try to look like them and act like them and if if if they would be like that about jesus the world would be in a better place i mean they they say well this is my favorite idol uh i i was kind of like that about uh my favorite rapper a long time ago i started rapping and i started trying to copy him and i even wore a hoodie all the time and that that wasn't in that time i i got that spirit of um rap music on me and i was was trying to rap i was trying i thought it was cool trying to look like and make the the rapper and i i mean come on somebody i mean we get like that that uh sometimes to where we we want to be like someone else we oh we like that person we like we like who they are we like everything about that person uh like let's say say you're a football player you want to be like uh tommy brady or someone like that you want to be a really good um football player or whatever because you want to be like them you think it's cool it's what whatever yeah and and and but jesus set the example he said follow me be like me do what what i do and and uh and and uh live like he he wants us to live follow this word that's his example that's what he wants us to do and and um sometimes we we we don't know where to go and we don't know which way to um to go we don't we don't always know what what the right uh things to do right things to say when you get put on on the spot and sometimes sometimes you say stupid things you'll do stupid thing and sometimes and and um but but we got to we got um follow uh uh this this word well anyways um let's see over here where uh okay okay okay here's here's another place what will what brother branham said um he's the same same jesus yesterday today and forever the same type of character a man that professes to be a christian must have a christ like nature if it isn't there's an another nature there and there which isn't christ-like if if you have the nature of a killer if if i told you i have the spirit of john dillinger some famous outlaw you'd expect me to have guns and and you it'd be dangerous to be sitting around on here where i was at because i i'd be a murderer amen once you get uh you you get we all get like a a spear on us to us we we all have a spear on us that we here uh like we're gonna be like that either you have the holy ghost or you got some um different spirit and if i told you i had the spirit of some famous mechanic you'd expect me to know what was wrong with your car if i looked at it if i told you the spirit of christ was in me i i must act like jesus you must act like jesus your character and conduct must be molded like that and this holy spirit molds that conduct when he comes into you amen so so um if you have a spirit then if you have the holy spirit who all everything who he is will become manifest in in your life and and once you identify yourself in this word you look at this word and you see yourself in it you see see that that's who who you are you follow exactly what this bible says is that that's when when you'll get to um your full identity where you're in the perfect will of god okay here in um first john 2 27 it says but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and he need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him as coming if you know and know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him amen so um we we've got to identify yourself in in his word now um sometimes we'll think that um like we won't know what we're doing sometimes but if if we are um if we identify ourselves in that word well and we'll get we'll um get in the perfect but anyways uh sorry if i'm starting off a little bit slow i'm kind of getting used to this all over again god made a man to desire to have an example and god gave him an example that that example is jesus christ to be identified with him see we are given we we all every single human being it's in him to desire to be like something i'm going to be like this great great big somebody i want to be like like i i want to be like the hollywood actors or whatever this everyone has an idol or or something something that they want to be like something that they they can look at and they identify i i think think i'm i see myself in that now we've got to get to a place to where we see ourselves in that word and we identify ourselves with uh jesus christ and that that's how how it is with the that is how it is with with the believer er when uh when people see you when people see me do they see jesus christ in me do they see a in my through my works do they see jesus christ in my works when people look at me do they see who jesus christ is being manifested through the things that i do now if we would be more like him then there there wouldn't be so many big shots in the world there wouldn't be any a hungry people in the world there wouldn't be any whiskey or drinking or gambling god gave us an example to be like but we refuse to be it now now that's what's the matter with the world they they got the desire god has given them but they've turned it in the wrong way it's time to turn and return back and get on the right road and get facing calvary nature proves it amen amen it's that's how it is this day and with the people identifying themselves with sin they they have to look at something they have to look look to something to identify themselves in and and it's it's been perverted to where er people's pain in in their faces and people cells um trying to look like something that they're not now a sinner knows he's a sinner and and um well not always because people there's centers i've met sinners that say they're they're a christian that's the worst kind of center that that that's going about sinning and and and claiming uh christianity he's nothing but a liar and but but the people atheists know that they're atheists and they say well yeah i'm an atheist i believe this i believe that they know who they are now that but the denominations and all of them they don't know who they are and and until they they figure out who they are that that's the first thing that you have to realize so that change can happen amen because it's it's something that they don't see if so someone is out on the streets and they're uh poor or they're naked they're blind and if if they don't know it how are they say how is anything supposed to change nothing's going to change if they don't see it and and that that's the first thing and repentance is turning from sin what what's uh what repent what is repentance if you you don't know what you're doing wrong and you think you're all right that that's the first step of getting into the condition of repentance now if people of this day with that great desire and great ambition to be a like somebody an example if they took christ as their example that then we would would have we would have every we could fi fi fire every police there was in the nation everybody would be meek and humble everybody would be kind and have brotherly love one for the other there there would be never be a divorce case ever played in our country there would never be any sickness they would we could dismiss we could even dismiss hospitals if everybody tried to make jesus christ their example we would have a need for nothing else but but the way things are that they don't know people don't know who they are and and people don't recognize it the pharisees they they um thought that they were so holy and righteous and and yet yet they didn't see who they they actually are even though jesus christ condemned them for for what what they did but but they didn't see who they are and and that's the first step to change who they are their their identity is still it's it's not not in where they should be so so that nature is in the man and he puts it on the wrong thing he he makes some man and you you know the bible said that we are cursed when when we make flesh our state when you try to make flesh your stay or put your trust in flesh the bible said you are cursed how well i know it's so easy to do it here's here's what causes a lot of it it is our newsstands for full of vulgar magazines our homes are full of pin up pictures our new screens are never censored they're wide open can crack any kind of jokes or or do things that that's terrible there's no um there's no cleanness among us anymore i i know you think i'm awful hard on that but it's so somebody has got got to be hard on it it's just got to be done and then all the these these things that they're putting out that through the media that um like we were talking about like the uh school system it's so so corrupt and and yet the younger generation is the next generation they're teaching uh kids is uh that they can choose what gender that they're gonna be what whatever they're they're training up a bunch of kids to be a a people that doesn't know who they are a bunch of children who who don't know who they are they grow up to be men women that don't don't even know know what gender they are it's it's gotten that bad now that the school system is teaching it and and that's why it's it's good to get to keep your children out of those those schools and and homeschool your children and it's it's gotten it's just gotten that bad just keep them out of it that and they're gonna grow up to to um unless unless they got the holy ghost they'll never know who they are when i was a little boy i read the the book of tarzan the apes mama had an old fur rug that mrs uh then had give her laid before the dresser i cut that thing up and made me a tarzan soup his suit and slept in a tree for a week i wanted to be tarzan but when i read the the book of lone star ranger i rode a broomstick out being a hobby horse trying to be the lone star ranger it's no no more than and what people will do it's it's what you read the music you listen to go into a restaurant in and this old rock and roll no wonder people are going crazy that's enough for to drive a human being crazy and then there's there's um so so many different things that they're trying to influence people to to be someone that they're not i i identify yourself with some movie queen and see where you'll be identify yourself with some cowboy or some teenager you'll see where you'll be but i challenge you to not not identify yourself with jesus christ in his death and his resurrection and you'll see where where you'll be at the resurrection for if we suffer with him we shall reign with him and god has given us the promise my whole desires to be like him amen if we get into that condition if we get into that condition and and to where all we we want to be on all that i want to be is is like him we we identify ourselves with with jesus christ that is who i i want to be that is the person and i want one to be like instead instead of looking at these other things these different and uh things out in the world that the world wants to be like the world says you should be like this you should do this you should you should do what we want you to do but we will not comply because as jesus christ has uh has came he has shown us how he wants us to be he has shown us the example he he wants us to identify ourselves with him and and when when he comes back he want one doesn't want us he doesn't want to see a bunch of people that went off to look at their to be something else identify themselves with something else he wants to come back and see himself a people that has decided to be just like him a people that is perfect now um perfect according to this word for it that follows this word exactly and and stays right with this word and nothing has not drifted from that like like humans to tend to do because it's our inner our nature but but once we become born again it's again it's uh against our nature or to do those other things we we start out as someone that then that isn't until where where um we're we're supposed to be until we become born again we and once you become born again you're identified yeah you your identity is changed that's why it's called being born again you're not no longer the person that you used to be and now you identify yourself as a christian you identify yourself as a son of god amen take me lord and mold me and make me shape me over again like the prophet that went down to the potter's house break me up and remold me that that's how i to be i want to be remolded by jesus christ i want to to be exactly like him i want to be christ-like i don't want him to come back and see me out here trying to look like snakes someone else i want one to to look like him and and that's how how we'll get into the condition to go in the rapture when and and jesus look god cannot god let's say um just like uh abraham abraham's uh wife when she laughed at what what uh at the word of the lord she laughed at it but god could not touch her because she was a part of abraham so so god cannot destroy us because we're a part of the lord jesus christ when he comes back he'll he'll see us in that condition to where we're a part of the lord jesus christ because that bride is gonna be a uh like like jesus christ we're they're going to be like him when he comes back if amen that's exactly where where the church stands today sold her word given character to satan for scientific man-made religion when she had the right as a church of god to stay with the word of god and have the holy spirit working among uh welding the body together with the word and love of god instead of that she sold out her birthrights like esau and took a denomination let her do it let her do it anything she wanted to do right just to be pop popular just to like her mother did in i see a rome god's word oh oh how it's entered into a pentecostal realm it's too bad but it didn't but it did it notice just a minute a nun in the catholic church that that woman to to become a nun and takes that last veil she she's absolutely sold out to that church she is so body and spirit property of that church she has an and no mind of her own and she can't have when she takes that last veil no ma no mind of her own no will of her own see out out here that satan makes them his his bogus and like the truth that the true church of christ the bride is sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in christ is in you what a difference amen that's how it's got to be until you've got that that mind of christ christ the mind of christ is in you amen and that's how how we got to get like we gotta get get the mind that's in jesus christ in it that you think exactly like he wants you to think you live exactly the way that he wants you to live and and to follow all this uh word exactly amen and to where we identify ourselves in that word and we we find today that the the modern church and modern world church the the modern world church and also that spiritual church are both impregnated to give birth to sons one of them a denominational birth to is going to give one of uh day two to these days at the world council of churches which will produce to that world the antichrist through a denomination that's exactly the truth i may not live to see it i believe i will but you young young people remember that you a minister say that that that that'll finally wind up and that is the mark of the beast when she forms that world council of churches and she'll give birth to her son the antichrist the other is impregnated by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a woman and is one the christ is one body the word that the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are are one now now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course and it is his will and his will is his word amen that that's how the bride's got to be identified and with jesus christ her mind is his mind and and she follows his word exactly amen now look at the so-called bride chosen by man and compare the spiritual to the natural of today a modern isabel bewitched by her ahab max factor beauties everything look at the church the the same way but a prostitute to the the word of the living god big denominations big buildings big money big salary all sold out men standing in the pulpit endorsing that that that's all all right and and let let them get by eye with it just to see that's all truly a blindly ought to see a church just exactly what the bible said would be said i am rich i said as a queen i in need of nothing and know us down not that thou are on that that are our poor miserable blind wretched naked and and don't know it if that that isn't thus said at the lord revelation 3 i've never read it that that's what she is and don't know it think of it if you tell a man or a woman on the street that that would start naked and tell them they were naked they'd say turn to your own business what why there's a mental deficiency there somewhere there is something that went wrong with their mind amen men when people get to that condition it's such a bad condition and and they'll say say that that they have need of nothing that they don't need anything they they're they're fine they look at them and they are in that condition but will not see it and therefore change will never happen and because of that amen and and so so and another thing uh that that word those words i have need of nothing that could mean like like i'm i'm okay i don't need anything you know i got all that i have need of i i lack nothing but but yet and uh even when with with the gospel even most people only go so far they're to where that um they're just saved and then that that's it they don't get filled with the holy ghost or anything else they just go to the first part they they love that part that says says um john 3 3 16 they love that part he who believes on the lord jesus christ i'll be saved and they love that part because um they they want to say that that well you just believe on him well i believe in jesus christ and and then they do nothing with that they just say well i believe that's it now i'm saying now i'm going to go to heaven they don't want to actually change or they don't want to change their life to to follow him they don't want to pick up the cross and follow him and it's just it just stops there and that's it there's a lot of people that like that this day as a matter of fact probably most christians are well so-called christians are like that they say well i'm a christian i identify as a christian well uh i could say i identify as a dog i'm not a dog but but it's it's in you it's what you do that shows that you are and and if they go around and do whatever they they want and go out in the in the world and and sin and drink and do all these things then they're they're not really a true christian and when you can read the word of god how how that people should do and this baptism the holy ghost that we have today and people what why they are why they look at you as if you were crazy you tell them you've got they they've got to be born again they got to believe the bible but yet people still still won't believe it they say well i believe my own certain way and i can and live my life with it in every way i want to live it first peter 1 2018 2 says see seeing ye have purified your souls in in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with the pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible sepa incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever amen when we've got to be born um and born again and not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god just like this it is like i have the this fear that i might um i always had this fear before i started preaching and stuff that um that i might mess up i might say something that i i shouldn't say i might um um because i'm going to be judged for everything i say but that's the thing god god puts that fear in in us that so that we won't say anything that we shouldn't say and and but that that's the thing god doesn't make any mistakes when he calls people he he he chooses his people for the right reasons even if they don't start out written very well or they don't god knows what he's doing when he chooses his people and and i believe god hasn't made a mistake he's the same jesus yesterday today and forever the same type of character a man that professes to be a christian must have a christ like nature if it isn't there there's another nature there that which isn't christ-like amen and um excuse me sorry reading the same things over and over again the bride is like into to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what what he is she is to reflect but but he what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her that she is all glorious within and without from beginning and ending she is the work of her lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of god how can one fathom it how can one understand it though though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for god has spoken it but not only is the candlestick of gold it is beaten gold handcrafted of beaten gold according to her blueprints which were spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ whichever people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely she has filled up the sufferings that christ has left her and left behind her her goods are de spoiled her life is in jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but in it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and and as god is malleable where is brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and and a joy forever by the trials and testings of this life amen as the musicians come first first john 5 5 4 and verse 4 to 5 says for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcome with the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god amen whoever is is born of the world will get away from from the things of this world and will cling to jesus christ and will identify themselves within the lord jesus christ and say say hey i i want to be like that and and not like anything else not idolize anything else not look to to other things and that that looked look nice amazed but but we'll cling into him amen and first john 2 27-29 says but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you that ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things that is true and no lie even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him and not not little children abide in him that what what when he shall appear we may have confidence not be ashamed for him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him amen let's pray lord lord jesus i pray lord that lord i know this this service
