[40:33] everybody
[40:34] a man when brother byler was saying that

[40:41] that's quite a bit
[40:43] hey man i'm just used to you know
[40:46] going and preaching to small groups and
[40:49] but uh
[40:50] we love the lord amen and we do trust
[40:53] them that
[40:55] wherever two or three is gathered
[40:58] and look
[41:00] i see more than three here
[41:02] hey man then
[41:04] yeah you know i don't think he has a
[41:06] choice
[41:07] he's got to be here
[41:08] amen and that's we do give god to thanks
[41:12] amen that he does come to visit us amen
[41:15] and to be with us to strengthen us and
[41:17] to
[41:17] give us the things that we need amen
[41:20] physically and spiritually amen he is
[41:23] truly faithful for that amen
[41:26] tell you what i need it
[41:29] you know
[41:31] you know
[41:33] there's been many times i used to say
[41:34] i'm just
[41:36] human i'm just human
[41:39] amen but you know i know there was a
[41:41] brother that kind of lectured me on that
[41:42] one time i was still young but i that's
[41:45] just how i always thought you know hey
[41:47] i'm just human i'm just human but you
[41:49] know some
[41:53] i'm just human but that is very true we
[41:56] are amen and uh but i believe we ought
[42:00] to look beyond that amen
[42:03] you know when you truly know
[42:05] what calvary really means amen let me
[42:07] tell you something you're a little bit
[42:08] more than human
[42:10] amen
[42:11] amen glory to god
[42:13] we we are we are those a man that can
[42:15] stand and and truly you know even look
[42:18] satan in the face and he could just
[42:20] vigil it right now you know we can say
[42:22] you know i've got a promise
[42:25] amen and it's a finished work
[42:28] glory to god
[42:30] amen and look and maybe the devil today
[42:33] just sees you as a human being
[42:35] in that flesh not perfect you know and
[42:37] that's very true but then the lord had
[42:40] given me a different insight
[42:43] amen he's giving me a different insight
[42:45] of i am you know who i really are amen
[42:48] i'm a part of the family of god amen i'm
[42:51] a child of god i'm a son of god amen
[42:53] glory and i have fallen air amen glory
[42:56] to god to these promises amen
[42:59] amen
[43:00] hello and and the satan's not stupid
[43:04] he knows you have amen but he knows the
[43:07] flesh
[43:08] amen
[43:10] he knows he can come around and
[43:12] you know and the
[43:14] support amen
[43:16] uh if i fall for it it's all it's my
[43:20] amen glory but i don't have to fall for
[43:22] it amen you know there's there's the
[43:24] psalms 22 amen but there's also psalms
[43:28] 23
[43:29] right
[43:30] amen now if you go home and read psalms
[43:33] 22 you're gonna you're gonna read where
[43:35] david just felt miserable
[43:38] yeah i mean he you know he didn't know
[43:40] where to turn he just was down depressed
[43:43] and well you know he just didn't know
[43:45] what was going on
[43:47] i mean he was talking about how he was
[43:49] just so dried up you know and
[43:52] but look david you know when you get to
[43:54] the bottom of the verse you can see
[43:57] david was stepping into chapter 23
[44:02] amen so you don't have to stay in
[44:04] chapter 22. you can
[44:06] you're entitled to it if you want to
[44:08] amen but you don't have to there's a
[44:11] chapter 23 amen
[44:13] glory for he is my shepherd i shall not
[44:16] want amen glory to god there's nothing
[44:18] this world can offer me amen once i met
[44:21] christ amen i know there's nothing out
[44:24] there i want
[44:27] amen glory to god and that's exactly how
[44:29] david felt amen look david had a kingdom
[44:33] that he could rule
[44:36] amen
[44:38] but that's not what he was looking at
[44:40] amen he had everything
[44:44] he had a palace
[44:46] he had a room that had all the treasures
[44:50] my think about that
[44:53] amen he could have never looked at those
[44:56] things and said what else could you know
[45:00] oh i'm sure the flesh could have thought
[45:02] of some things like
[45:03] there's a land over there i don't own
[45:04] yet i think i'll go over there and
[45:06] conquer it huh
[45:08] no but when
[45:10] he already see when he knew his god amen
[45:13] he could say the lord is my shepherd and
[45:14] i shall not want amen he i believe david
[45:18] when he stepped into chapter 23 he was
[45:21] satisfied amen he was content amen glory
[45:24] to god and we can do the same today amen
[45:28] amen yes we can there's a chapter 23
[45:31] amen glory and i hope we've stepped into
[45:33] that this morning amen
[45:36] hallelujah glory but like i said you can
[45:39] stay in chapter 22 if you want
[45:42] amen that's completely all up to you
[45:44] amen glory but i'm encouraging you that
[45:48] there is a chapter 23 amen glory
[45:52] hallelujah i'm just going to share this
[45:54] song with you
[45:57] amen glory
[45:59] you know i'm just kind of uh
[46:02] something i'm sure brother byler knows
[46:03] and have experienced things like this
[46:05] you get behind the pulpit and
[46:07] you actually walked out of that office
[46:09] not knowing what to preach
[46:11] you just got to really rely on the lord
[46:12] amen that we can study we can put good
[46:15] notes together we can
[46:17] you know even place the quotes in there
[46:19] just just right you know the way you
[46:21] would want it and amen but look it all
[46:24] has to be by the inspiration of the holy
[46:26] spirit amen glory to god that he knows
[46:29] amen and so i was
[46:31] i was looking at different notes there i
[46:33] said lord i'm now i said what do i do
[46:35] now it's like i thought it was this i
[46:37] thought you know but anyway
[46:40] so
[46:40] i you know i had been reading on
[46:43] something that i
[46:45] you know as many times i've read
[46:47] scriptures now i'll be honest i've never
[46:49] really sat down
[46:50] and read the bible from
[46:52] genesis to revelation not like that
[46:55] but as many times you study or you know
[46:57] you just go to this place and that place
[46:59] that place and you probably read the
[47:01] whole bot
[47:02] but there are things in the bible you'll
[47:04] just read and says well ask them i
[47:05] didn't see that you know i know i've
[47:07] read this
[47:08] and
[47:09] it just it just happens that way
[47:11] and then when you come across it and the
[47:13] lord deals with your heart
[47:15] then you start the thinking and you
[47:16] start to looking at your own life and
[47:19] that's just the way he is sometimes
[47:21] but uh i know that
[47:23] this is a memorial weekend and
[47:26] and we we came here to
[47:28] most of my wife's family is here in
[47:31] kentucky and
[47:32] and
[47:33] so uh
[47:35] of course
[47:37] before when i first met my wife we would
[47:39] come here and actually visit family they
[47:42] were alive we could go to their house
[47:44] and you know just fellowship and
[47:46] it's like it's sad to say that now we
[47:48] come here and so we can kind of look at
[47:51] the graves you know and
[47:53] it's not really the way you want
[47:54] fellowship but
[47:56] it is it's been giving us a time
[47:59] to where
[48:00] you know this weekend we can just go
[48:02] around and have some memories you know
[48:04] and
[48:05] but uh anyway
[48:07] so we were just kind of looking at
[48:09] different things she still has family
[48:11] here
[48:12] and
[48:14] but
[48:18] the lord is good
[48:21] and i know that sometimes we
[48:25] were there
[48:26] i i didn't witness calvary
[48:29] amen
[48:30] you know and
[48:32] maybe it would have been uh
[48:34] something you know but i don't know
[48:36] you know
[48:37] but i just know i won there
[48:40] the god plays something in my heart that
[48:42] even though i just read it in a book but
[48:45] to me it's not a fairy tale
[48:47] it really did happen amen
[48:50] amen and i thank god
[48:52] that it did really happen amen
[48:55] glory to god because that was the only
[48:58] way for me amen
[49:00] if there was no calvary i don't know
[49:02] brothers and sisters
[49:04] amen glory to
[49:06] god
[49:08] but i'd like to share the song with you
[49:10] i never saw amen i didn't see it
[49:13] i didn't see the mob
[49:15] you know i didn't
[49:16] [Music]
[49:19] amen but i'm glad he rose amen
[49:23] glory

[50:36] the crown of
[50:38] thorns that
[50:40] my
[50:41] jesus wore
[50:44] no
[50:45] when i
[50:47] didn't see
[50:48] the lord he
[50:51] was crucified
[50:56] no
[50:58] i
[50:59] never saw it
[51:01] [Music]
[51:02] but i believed
[51:04] for me
[51:06] he died
[51:08] amen
[51:11] every step he took
[51:17] [Music]
[51:18] to calvary
[51:25] [Music]
[51:26] every drop
[51:29] of blood he shed
[51:32] he shed
[51:34] for me amen
[51:38] there's a
[51:39] lot of things
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:45] i
[51:46] cannot see
[51:52] but i
[51:53] believe
[51:56] when he died
[51:58] he
[52:00] died for me
[52:05] every step
[52:08] he took
[52:10] o glory
[52:11] [Music]
[52:12] to calvary
[52:20] every drop
[52:23] of blood
[52:24] he shed
[52:26] he shed
[52:27] for me
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] there's a lot of things
[52:38] i
[52:40] cannot see
[52:43] [Music]
[52:45] but i
[52:46] believe
[52:49] when
[52:50] he died
[52:52] he died for me
[52:57] [Music]
[52:59] amen glory to god hallelujah
[53:03] praise god thank you brother
[53:06] praise the lord amen
[53:10] glory aren't you glad for that
[53:13] amen glory to god
[53:16] i believe jesus could have kept walking
[53:19] if he wanted to but i'm glad he stopped
[53:21] amen
[53:22] you know
[53:26] all through the bible
[53:32] jesus
[53:33] had always told them even the disciples
[53:36] that he was going to die
[53:39] amen
[53:40] he he had shared that with the disciples
[53:43] over and over even when he was you know
[53:46] you know
[53:47] and he he always had already told him he
[53:50] says i'm gonna die
[53:52] you know and he he's told him uh
[53:54] they're gonna come and take me and i'm
[53:56] going to suffer
[53:58] amen
[53:58] and he he shared that all the time
[54:02] you know he gave them that sign you know
[54:04] one day i'll be you know i'm going to
[54:06] die
[54:06] and even to the uh you know to the
[54:09] elders you know to those and he even
[54:11] told me he said you know you destroy
[54:13] this body and all
[54:14] he said destroy this temple and i'll
[54:16] build i'll raise it up in three days
[54:19] i mean he even witnessed to them of his
[54:21] own death of course they didn't
[54:22] understand it amen
[54:24] they said what do you mean he says it
[54:26] took years for us to build this temple
[54:28] you know and all of that and you mean
[54:30] you'll just you know we just destroy it
[54:32] you'll build it back up in three days
[54:35] of course he was talking about himself
[54:38] amen all through the scriptures you'll
[54:40] find how you know so you could see that
[54:42] jesus didn't fear death
[54:47] he didn't fear death i mean he told the
[54:49] disciples over and over even peter got a
[54:52] little upset one time when jesus was
[54:54] telling him and he says this can't be
[54:56] [Music]
[54:57] amen even jesus had to say satan get
[54:59] behind me
[55:03] amen
[55:05] but there he was you can see that he
[55:08] wasn't he didn't fear death
[55:11] that wasn't scaring him amen
[55:15] but you know there he was in the garden
[55:19] in agony
[55:21] praying to the father and and the bible
[55:24] talks about that his his sweat
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:27] was blood amen just dripping amen
[55:32] you could almost probably picture it in
[55:34] your own mind that if he was sweating so
[55:36] bad because you know but it wasn't the
[55:38] death that was carrying him it was
[55:40] because he knew amen that he was
[55:43] becoming sin amen
[55:46] he was had to take on your sin amen
[55:48] glory to god and he knew that there was
[55:50] going to be a point of time that he was
[55:53] going to be separated
[55:55] from the father
[55:59] that's what he didn't like
[56:02] he didn't fear death amen but to be
[56:05] separated from the father amen that's
[56:08] the part amen lord amen would this cup
[56:11] pass amen
[56:16] i mean all through his ministry he told
[56:18] them i'm gonna die i'm gonna die he
[56:20] wasn't afraid of that amen
[56:22] [Applause]
[56:23] but if even jesus amen glory to god
[56:28] didn't want that to happen how about us
[56:30] amen
[56:33] amen lord i don't i don't never want to
[56:35] lose amen i don't ever want to be
[56:37] separated from you amen
[56:43] glory and sometimes the people today you
[56:45] almost wonder hey man that they're doing
[56:48] the things that they're doing and it's
[56:49] like
[56:50] they don't know
[56:52] no worries
[56:55] of what they do
[56:57] knowing that the very things that that
[56:58] they do or what we do would separate us
[57:01] in and from that fellowship amen
[57:05] see jesus didn't want that
[57:07] he didn't want it so bad that he prayed
[57:09] in the garden that his own blood i mean
[57:12] the sweat that was coming out was blood
[57:14] just dripping down
[57:18] brother byler poppy when he was done
[57:19] praying he was probably covered with
[57:21] blood
[57:23] whatever garments he was wearing it was
[57:26] drenched in blood
[57:31] all because he knew
[57:34] amen glory to god but let me tell you
[57:36] something when he was hanging on the
[57:38] cross amen there was something happening
[57:40] amen what was going on he was becoming
[57:43] us as we were becoming him amen glory
[57:47] hallelujah
[57:49] amen think about it
[57:51] think about it amen as he was there amen
[57:54] he wasn't afraid to die but there was
[57:56] something that he didn't like at all and
[57:58] that was to be separated from the father
[58:00] amen glory and he said father he said
[58:03] god my god amen
[58:05] has forsaken me amen glory
[58:09] but there he was bearing the world sins
[58:13] amen on his shoulder he was becoming
[58:16] every sin out there amen glory
[58:19] and it was starting to separate him from
[58:21] the father amen glory and as you
[58:25] what's becoming him amen
[58:27] there you are
[58:29] becoming close
[58:31] to the father
[58:34] oh glory to god
[58:36] hallelujah
[58:38] something was happening on that day
[58:41] and maybe it happened more than 2 000
[58:43] years ago but it happened amen and gave
[58:46] me the chance today amen to have that
[58:49] fellowship with my father amen glory as

[1:00:03] one of my
[1:00:05] i mean the whole bible's my favorite
[1:00:07] book
[1:00:09] but sometimes you'll get into a book and
[1:00:11] it's like oh my this is my favorite then
[1:00:14] you'll get in another book and says oh i
[1:00:16] thought that was my favorite
[1:00:17] my favorite you know but you just
[1:00:19] learned the whole book's your favorite
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:23] and i like
[1:00:25] to read about
[1:00:26] joshua amen and
[1:00:29] and there's a lot of types in there man
[1:00:31] that you can really look at and
[1:00:33] but you know i come across a
[1:00:35] it's not i've never read it before
[1:00:38] but i just
[1:00:40] thought i'd read it again and it's
[1:00:41] joshua chapter 20.
[1:00:43] and there's only like nine verses
[1:00:49] and uh
[1:00:52] and i've read different scriptures
[1:00:54] of this especially in the book of
[1:00:56] numbers where it talks about the the
[1:00:57] city of refuge
[1:01:00] and so i was like you know even though
[1:01:02] i've read this i said well i've heard
[1:01:04] that i mean i've read that and
[1:01:06] i said but i've never really pursued to
[1:01:09] but just
[1:01:10] a couple weeks ago you know and i was
[1:01:12] just
[1:01:13] reading it and somehow
[1:01:15] the lord wanted to
[1:01:17] inspire me with it or i just somehow it
[1:01:20] stopped me in my tracks just to it's
[1:01:22] like well you know
[1:01:23] what is this you know
[1:01:25] but
[1:01:26] if you're there
[1:01:28] you have your bibles joshua chapter 2
[1:01:31] 20 there in verse 1 and there's about
[1:01:33] there's nine verses
[1:01:35] and
[1:01:36] some of these things i can't even
[1:01:38] pronounce and but we'll do our best amen
[1:01:42] so in chapter one there uh chapter 20 in
[1:01:44] verse one it says the lord also
[1:01:47] spake unto joshua saying uh speak to the
[1:01:50] children of israel saying a point out
[1:01:53] for you
[1:01:54] cities of refuge
[1:01:56] wherever i speak unto you by the hand of
[1:01:59] moses
[1:02:00] that the slayer that killeth any person
[1:02:04] unawares it says
[1:02:05] and unwittingly
[1:02:08] may flee thither says
[1:02:10] and they shall be your refuge from the
[1:02:13] avenger of blood
[1:02:16] and when he had and when he
[1:02:19] that
[1:02:20] does flee unto one of those cities shall
[1:02:23] stand at the entering of the gate of the
[1:02:25] city and shall declare his cause in the
[1:02:28] ears of the elders of that city they
[1:02:31] shall take him into the city unto them
[1:02:35] and give him a place that he may dwell
[1:02:38] among them
[1:02:39] and if the avenger of blood pursue after
[1:02:42] him then they shall not deliver the
[1:02:44] slayer up into his hands because he
[1:02:47] smoked his neighbor unwittingly and
[1:02:50] hated him not before time
[1:02:53] and he shall dwell in the city until he
[1:02:57] stand
[1:02:58] before the congregation for judgment and
[1:03:01] until the death of the high priest that
[1:03:03] shall be in those days then shall the
[1:03:06] slayer return and come into his own
[1:03:09] city and unto his own house
[1:03:12] unto the city from whence he fled
[1:03:19] verse seven and they appointed
[1:03:22] kadish
[1:03:24] and galilee
[1:03:26] in mount uh
[1:03:28] nephilim
[1:03:30] like i said these some of these things i
[1:03:32] can't pronounce but then we have and it
[1:03:34] also talks about uh
[1:03:37] shicham
[1:03:38] and mount the
[1:03:40] euphratem
[1:03:42] and there is a uh kirchaf abra i mean
[1:03:46] arba
[1:03:47] which is hebron
[1:03:49] in the mountain of judah
[1:03:51] and on the other side of jordan by
[1:03:54] jericho eastward
[1:03:56] they assigned bizir
[1:03:59] in the wilderness upon the land plain
[1:04:03] uh of the tribe of robin
[1:04:07] and ramoth and gilead
[1:04:09] out of the tribe of god i mean gad and
[1:04:12] golan this is angolan and bastion
[1:04:16] out of the tribe of manassas
[1:04:18] he says these were the cities appointed
[1:04:20] for all the children of israel and for
[1:04:23] the strangers amen
[1:04:25] and i wanna i want you to catch this for
[1:04:27] a minute in verse nine
[1:04:29] and where it says there he says these
[1:04:32] were the cities appointed for all the
[1:04:34] children of israel
[1:04:38] and i want you to remember this part and
[1:04:40] for the strangers
[1:04:42] that sword journaleth it says among them
[1:04:45] that whosoever killeth any person that
[1:04:48] una
[1:04:49] wears might flee he says thinner and not
[1:04:52] die by the hand of the avenger of blood
[1:04:54] until he stood before the congregation
[1:04:57] you may be seated and made a lord at his
[1:04:59] blessing on the rest of the reading of
[1:05:00] the word
[1:05:01] now i've read this before like i said
[1:05:03] there's just times i'll take a book read
[1:05:05] it and and if it
[1:05:07] you know then i'll just put it up but
[1:05:09] for some reason something struck me
[1:05:13] and
[1:05:14] we just kind of i've never preached it
[1:05:16] before this is
[1:05:18] you know i'm going to preach it to you
[1:05:20] amen and and i'm i'm depending on the
[1:05:23] holy spirit amen and that you know
[1:05:28] so
[1:05:31] you know looking at these things and
[1:05:34] so i even you know i'm i'm one of those
[1:05:36] two that if i find the scriptures i like
[1:05:38] to go see if brother branham's you know
[1:05:40] actually read it or if he even talked
[1:05:42] about it or maybe expound on it well i
[1:05:44] have found several different uh in the
[1:05:47] message you know in the where brother
[1:05:48] branham had talked about it he never
[1:05:50] really expounded he just talked about
[1:05:52] the same thing that you read that we had
[1:05:54] just read we get an understanding that
[1:05:56] these these cities were you know but
[1:05:58] first if you really look into uh history
[1:06:01] and because these were given to the
[1:06:04] levites
[1:06:05] they were actually given to the levites
[1:06:07] to take care of these cities they're the
[1:06:09] ones that were given the commission to
[1:06:11] actually put these cities together amen
[1:06:13] and you know because really during the
[1:06:16] time of the uh uh um
[1:06:18] in the wilderness when when
[1:06:21] there was uh there they were there at
[1:06:23] mount sinai man and there moses was up
[1:06:26] way up in the mountain and because you
[1:06:28] know they already told moses you go talk
[1:06:30] to god you know instead of god talking
[1:06:32] to us you go talk to god and when they
[1:06:34] whatever god tells you you you tell to
[1:06:37] us amen i mean they were already
[1:06:39] refusing grace because they wanted law
[1:06:41] amen so there we can see moses went up
[1:06:44] and he was there and and when he
[1:06:47] comes down he finds them what you know
[1:06:50] because it kind of took him a little
[1:06:51] while and and those people down it's
[1:06:53] like you know where's moses what's
[1:06:55] taking him so long amen so they figured
[1:06:57] well we'll just make us our own god amen
[1:06:59] and they made a calf amen glory and they
[1:07:02] worshipped that captain here's moses
[1:07:04] coming down amen with the word of god
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:08] the ten commandments and there he's
[1:07:09] gonna present it to them and he finds
[1:07:11] them amen worshiping idols amen glory
[1:07:16] i mean that's how far they've really
[1:07:17] rejected god
[1:07:19] and look
[1:07:20] in in the levites
[1:07:23] the levites were not part of israel
[1:07:28] they weren't amen they were there
[1:07:31] amen but when moses said who will stand
[1:07:35] with me
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:37] amen glory to god
[1:07:41] the strangers
[1:07:43] to israel
[1:07:46] the ones they wouldn't even claim as
[1:07:48] neighbors or or whatever it was amen but
[1:07:51] they were there
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:53] amen and there moses stood amen and saw
[1:07:56] what he said
[1:07:57] my
[1:07:59] then he says who will stand with me that
[1:08:01] will destroy amen
[1:08:05] the levites
[1:08:07] volunteered
[1:08:09] the levite side we'll stand with you
[1:08:11] amen and we'll go out and we'll destroy
[1:08:15] amen these idol worshipers
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:23] and then when it come time
[1:08:25] now moses is off the face of the earth
[1:08:28] and now we have joshua and here it comes
[1:08:30] to
[1:08:31] joshua's an old man
[1:08:34] it's time for him to to divide the lands
[1:08:36] among the 12 tribes amen
[1:08:40] amen and there's nothing
[1:08:44] in the where where where uh
[1:08:48] where he begins to divide there's
[1:08:50] hands where going to the levites
[1:08:55] they were not part of the twelve tribes
[1:09:00] amen but then joshua says throw each
[1:09:02] each try
[1:09:04] amen was to give
[1:09:08] to the levites
[1:09:11] willingly
[1:09:13] from their hearts amen
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:16] they were to give to the levites amen
[1:09:18] and i believe they were given like 46
[1:09:21] lands or whatever it is cities and all
[1:09:23] of that you know i'm not trying to go in
[1:09:25] very detailed in this because i don't
[1:09:26] want to take too much time and but there
[1:09:29] was also the six amen that were that was
[1:09:31] entrusted to them and they were to start
[1:09:34] this city
[1:09:35] and they were called the cities of
[1:09:37] refuge amen
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:43] and then so that if something was to
[1:09:45] happen amen so here the next step was to
[1:09:49] what set up our six
[1:09:51] cities amen of refuge amen three on each
[1:09:55] side of the jordan river amen where
[1:09:57] where the a man slayer amen might might
[1:10:01] flee from the adventure of blood
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:09] a man slave was someone who accidentally
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:12] killed another person
[1:10:15] and the avenger of blood was usually a
[1:10:17] close relative amen and then to this to
[1:10:21] the slain person who who saw and he he
[1:10:24] sought to avenge the death
[1:10:28] amen and if a manslaughter could flee to
[1:10:31] a city of refuge amen he found a
[1:10:34] sanctuary amen there until the death of
[1:10:37] the high priest then he could walk
[1:10:39] return to his native city
[1:10:42] safely
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:47] that's why i was
[1:10:49] and if we were to i don't know i'm sure
[1:10:50] it's being recorded if you give it a
[1:10:52] title we're going to title it christ
[1:10:56] amen the city of refuge
[1:11:00] christ the city of refuge amen
[1:11:03] glory to god
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:06] and you know the cities of refuge man
[1:11:08] are they are they're interesting amen
[1:11:10] and of the theological you know
[1:11:12] importance of it
[1:11:14] it was important amen
[1:11:17] because it had a it had a purpose
[1:11:21] and then it wasn't just something
[1:11:22] because they just was deciding to build
[1:11:24] cities it was important amen you know
[1:11:28] moses was commissioned to do this and
[1:11:31] then it fell on joshua amen and joshua
[1:11:33] commissioned it to the levites amen
[1:11:37] glory
[1:11:42] and so
[1:11:45] uh i wanted to go a little deeper
[1:11:48] and about
[1:11:49] you know these cities you know and
[1:11:52] and i was looking at a jewish commentary
[1:11:55] uh
[1:11:56] and how
[1:11:58] you know there's still some like maybe
[1:11:59] way back then that kept record of these
[1:12:01] things and i was just reading a little
[1:12:03] bit of these things and i'd like to
[1:12:05] share it with you amen
[1:12:07] if that's okay
[1:12:08] amen i hope it's sounding interesting
[1:12:11] already amen but we can see amen but we
[1:12:14] do have a christ amen we do have a god
[1:12:17] today we can run into amen he is our
[1:12:19] refuge amen hallelujah but they were
[1:12:22] they were here's these cities amen and
[1:12:25] and we also named them uh they they we
[1:12:28] read it in the scriptures amen and even
[1:12:30] the names uh i wanted to look at like
[1:12:33] what did they mean amen
[1:12:34] and uh so but here
[1:12:36] it was talking about this is number one
[1:12:39] it says the roads
[1:12:42] and remember now there's six
[1:12:45] and uh uh and there are
[1:12:47] three on each side of the uh
[1:12:51] the jordan the river
[1:12:54] and it was talking about it says
[1:12:57] the roads
[1:12:59] leading to the city of refuge
[1:13:02] were always kept
[1:13:04] through repair
[1:13:08] amen they're always repairing these
[1:13:10] roads
[1:13:11] amen now it's not because um
[1:13:15] i don't know how to really explain it
[1:13:17] but it was just because they had to make
[1:13:20] sure
[1:13:21] that whoever was fleeing and they
[1:13:25] that there would be
[1:13:26] nothing to hinder that person
[1:13:31] amen and they said the roads leading to
[1:13:33] the cities of refuge were always kept
[1:13:36] repaired it says and it says and
[1:13:39] required to be about 32 cubits
[1:13:44] that's 48 feet
[1:13:48] that's sometimes wider
[1:13:50] than some of the roads i drive on
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:56] i mean they've got roads here where they
[1:13:58] set the speed limits at 70.
[1:14:02] that's that's very fast
[1:14:06] 70.
[1:14:09] amen but even the city
[1:14:12] even the city has to take care of the
[1:14:14] the road kills the debris
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] use tires just falling everywhere
[1:14:22] and the cities are hired to make sure
[1:14:24] that you know nothing's gonna hinder
[1:14:26] your travel
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:32] sometimes there's an accident that
[1:14:33] happens
[1:14:36] yeah
[1:14:37] there's an accident that happens amen
[1:14:40] and that's the same with the devil
[1:14:42] always wants to jump in the middle of
[1:14:43] the road and cause some kind of trouble
[1:14:46] to delay you
[1:14:49] amen but here they're saying that it had
[1:14:52] to be 48 feet that's how broad it was
[1:14:54] they were making sure amen number two it
[1:14:57] says the obstructions were removed that
[1:15:00] might stay the the flyers foot
[1:15:03] or or hinder his speed
[1:15:10] had to be clean all the time
[1:15:13] that way that whoever that who's running
[1:15:15] trying to get to whatever city he's
[1:15:17] trying to get to
[1:15:18] he's going to be he's going to make it
[1:15:22] amen glory and he said
[1:15:26] there was going to be no no
[1:15:28] was it was was left he says
[1:15:30] and no rivers no rivers was allowed over
[1:15:34] which there was not a
[1:15:36] bridge i mean they were making sure
[1:15:39] these roads just ah and i was thinking
[1:15:41] of that brother byler and i was like
[1:15:44] glory to god hallelujah
[1:15:46] and now it was just coming to me to i'm
[1:15:48] like oh my lord glory
[1:15:54] i said what you've done for me
[1:15:58] glory and how you clear that path just
[1:16:01] so i could make it amen
[1:16:03] at whatever speed i'm trying to get to
[1:16:06] him amen there was going to be nothing
[1:16:08] hindering amen
[1:16:13] i believe there comes a time in a
[1:16:15] person's heart amen that they begin to
[1:16:17] realize they're going to need a refuge
[1:16:20] amen and who do i go to
[1:16:23] who do i go to amen glory to god
[1:16:30] number four it says at every turning at
[1:16:33] every turning there were posts amen
[1:16:37] erected it says bearing the words
[1:16:41] refuge amen to guide amen the unhappy
[1:16:45] man in his
[1:16:46] flight

[1:16:55] that's preaching this gospel

[1:17:03] get to the refuge amen do you know how
[1:17:05] many ministers out there that god has
[1:17:08] that it don't matter if you're trying to
[1:17:09] make a left turn or a right turn there's
[1:17:12] a minister pointing to christ pointing
[1:17:14] to the refuge amen glory
[1:17:19] and god has purposely set amen these
[1:17:22] ministers or whoever he's using amen to
[1:17:25] point its dis
[1:17:27] way
[1:17:28] it's that way glory to god
[1:17:34] and there is only one way
[1:17:38] amen and i can't point to anybody
[1:17:40] different
[1:17:41] than what brother byler would point to
[1:17:43] or any other minister as long as they're
[1:17:46] on the word of god
[1:17:48] but there are men out there that might
[1:17:50] want to confuse you and tell you it's
[1:17:54] this way and it's not that way god has
[1:17:57] only one way of a provided way amen
[1:18:01] and it's through our lord jesus christ
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:07] and we stand amen glory to god with the
[1:18:10] help of the holy spirit and we point to
[1:18:12] the refuge amen it's this way
[1:18:15] and there is no other way
[1:18:20] you might have to make a left turn you
[1:18:22] might have to make a right turn whatever
[1:18:24] it is but it has to lead to the same
[1:18:26] refuge amen
[1:18:33] glory
[1:18:36] they had signs
[1:18:37] those signs were put there and they made
[1:18:39] sure they weren't falling
[1:18:41] you know i've seen signs where last time
[1:18:44] there was a sign here now it's not there
[1:18:46] no more
[1:18:46] see it can't be that way
[1:18:49] the sign remains it's taken care of amen
[1:18:52] glory

[1:22:59] another amen and as the city of refuge

[1:25:23] anytime you want to i believe you can
[1:25:25] get to christ
[1:25:27] oh praise the lord amen look they're in
[1:25:30] first dawn in chapter two amen reading
[1:25:33] one and two
[1:25:35] and let's just look at this for a minute
[1:25:38] because
[1:25:42] here it says in in in chapter
[1:25:45] two of of
[1:25:46] first john in
[1:25:48] verse one it says my little children
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:54] does that make you feel special
[1:25:57] my little children
[1:26:00] and then there's
[1:26:02] he's not just standing there like as god
[1:26:06] he's standing there as
[1:26:08] as a father
[1:26:11] a father
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:16] my little children he says these things
[1:26:19] right unto you amen
[1:26:21] i he says right i unto
[1:26:25] sin not
[1:26:27] amen but the verse didn't stop there
[1:26:32] amen it doesn't stop there
[1:26:34] it's not like the verse is supposed to
[1:26:37] like here he's being a father he's
[1:26:39] calling us children and he said i don't
[1:26:42] want you to sin amen well don't stand
[1:26:44] there just like oh my what am i gonna do
[1:26:47] you know here's that thought amen i'm
[1:26:49] only human lord
[1:26:53] now look we're more than that
[1:26:57] amen yes i'm in this flesh and i'm going
[1:26:59] to continue making mistakes amen glory
[1:27:01] to god
[1:27:03] but let's just look at it he said my
[1:27:05] little children these things right i
[1:27:07] unto you that ye sin not and if any man
[1:27:10] sin
[1:27:12] look at this
[1:27:14] first he's telling us he doesn't want us
[1:27:15] to sin why is that that's because god is
[1:27:18] perfect
[1:27:19] that's right
[1:27:20] and you know that's what he'd like to
[1:27:22] bring us to amen remember we're becoming
[1:27:25] him
[1:27:26] amen and i like the part in the
[1:27:28] scripture where it says when he finally
[1:27:29] comes amen there on the cloud and when
[1:27:32] we see him we'll know him we'll know him
[1:27:35] because what because we'll be like him
[1:27:40] glory
[1:27:41] and god is going to make a way
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:47] and if you're part of it there's not
[1:27:49] going to be one hindrance amen in your
[1:27:51] path to get to that place man of
[1:27:54] perfection
[1:27:58] so he says these things right i unto you
[1:28:00] that ye sin not and he says and if any
[1:28:03] man sin
[1:28:04] we have an advocate
[1:28:08] with he says what
[1:28:10] with god
[1:28:14] now that's not wrong either
[1:28:16] but that's not the word used in that
[1:28:18] verse
[1:28:19] he said father
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] see he he's pointing to the very
[1:28:26] attribute yeah he's god
[1:28:30] and the only reason he's god is because
[1:28:32] he could be worshipped
[1:28:34] but god had attributes amen
[1:28:37] he longed to have you as his children
[1:28:39] part of his family
[1:28:43] and here it points out it's saying
[1:28:45] advocate he says with the father he says
[1:28:48] jesus christ the righteous amen glory
[1:28:51] and verse two and he says and he is the
[1:28:54] prophetiation of our sins and not it
[1:28:57] says and not for ours only but also for
[1:29:00] the sins of the whole
[1:29:04] world
[1:29:07] so you mean the world the whole entire
[1:29:10] world
[1:29:11] has access
[1:29:14] oh my
[1:29:16] yes they do
[1:29:18] god has made sure
[1:29:20] amen he's not just wanting to be god to
[1:29:23] the whole world but he is wanting to
[1:29:25] show them that fathership amen even to
[1:29:28] the whole entire world
[1:29:35] and by every day he's rejected
[1:29:41] every day
[1:29:43] amen they come up with a another kind of
[1:29:45] idea that it's this way
[1:29:47] or it's that way the homosexual says
[1:29:51] we have a way
[1:29:52] this group here says we have a way
[1:29:58] amen
[1:29:59] you got the atheists and the agnostics
[1:30:02] amen
[1:30:04] now the atheists just don't believe
[1:30:05] period
[1:30:06] don't believe in a god
[1:30:08] you know what eggnox is
[1:30:11] they're the ones that's halfway halfway
[1:30:13] kind of like
[1:30:14] maybe there is a god
[1:30:18] but an atheist just flat out will tell
[1:30:19] you no
[1:30:20] there's no god
[1:30:23] amen but eggnog they say man and that
[1:30:25] you know a
[1:30:28] an agnostic we'll take a plant eggplant
[1:30:31] i mean just totally dried up brother and
[1:30:34] they'll water it
[1:30:36] and say
[1:30:39] it might live
[1:30:44] amen
[1:30:45] now an atheist won't give it a time they
[1:30:47] won't give the time of the day to even
[1:30:49] water they just said it's dead
[1:30:53] amen but look we don't serve god
[1:30:56] because we believe there's a chance
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:03] it doesn't work that way look you either
[1:31:06] believe or you don't
[1:31:09] amen
[1:31:10] you don't ask god for healing because
[1:31:13] you feel like well there's a chance he
[1:31:15] might heal me
[1:31:18] that's the wrong way to approach god
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:24] it's already a finish work
[1:31:27] he's already healed us amen
[1:31:29] it's not by a chance that i'm going to
[1:31:31] tell myself it might work it might work
[1:31:34] brother byler if i pray oh my
[1:31:36] i'll pray for my brother i'll pray for
[1:31:38] my sister because maybe there's a chance
[1:31:41] amen glory
[1:31:45] no that's not how we serve him amen
[1:31:48] glory
[1:31:51] that's the way the world is
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:55] but i believe they're still people i
[1:31:58] believe
[1:31:59] amen the gospel is still to be preached
[1:32:01] i believe there's still souls that needs
[1:32:03] to be won amen glory
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:07] i believe every human being on the face
[1:32:09] of the world brother byler has a chance
[1:32:12] today amen
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:17] but one day
[1:32:18] yeah
[1:32:20] they will be gone
[1:32:22] amen one day but right now amen glory
[1:32:27] sometimes our attitude toward
[1:32:29] amen toward the way the world is you
[1:32:31] know sometimes that makes us look kind
[1:32:33] of bad
[1:32:36] sometimes we just got to go to god and
[1:32:38] say lord i know
[1:32:41] i know you can do it
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:45] our president biden is
[1:32:47] clear out of his mind but you have to
[1:32:49] say lord i know you can heal that man
[1:32:54] you can heal not only physically but
[1:32:56] also spiritually
[1:32:59] that man
[1:33:01] needs the holy ghost
[1:33:05] hey man
[1:33:07] you know but look
[1:33:09] the whole earth needs the holy ghost
[1:33:12] and there's still an opportunity amen i
[1:33:15] believe the path is still being cleared
[1:33:18] and then i believe the path is still
[1:33:20] being maintained amen glory i believe
[1:33:22] the signs are still being placed right
[1:33:24] there amen and there are those that god
[1:33:27] are using and saying this is the way
[1:33:28] amen glory
[1:33:31] he said i am the way the truth and the
[1:33:33] life amen glory
[1:33:36] that's who we point to
[1:33:39] now john gives us god's
[1:33:41] uh he says this is god's perfect
[1:33:44] standard here we just read the
[1:33:45] scriptures says my little children these
[1:33:47] things write eye unto you that ye sin
[1:33:50] not and if any man sin we have an
[1:33:52] advocate with the father jesus christ
[1:33:55] the righteous amen
[1:33:57] and he is the propitiation for for our
[1:34:00] sins amen
[1:34:01] and not for ours only but also for the
[1:34:04] sins of the whole world amen glory to
[1:34:07] god
[1:34:08] and john is trying to say and he's
[1:34:10] trying to give us here what he's trying
[1:34:12] to give god's perfect standard amen for
[1:34:15] his people and his his gracious
[1:34:18] provision amen in the the the the event
[1:34:21] of failure
[1:34:23] because we do sometimes fail
[1:34:27] and he wants you to know hey
[1:34:29] we have an advocate
[1:34:34] little children refers to all the
[1:34:35] members of the families of god amen
[1:34:37] glory when he's saying my my little
[1:34:40] children i can put my name right there
[1:34:44] glory to god amen god's perfect standard
[1:34:47] is then set forth amen in the words
[1:34:50] these things i write to you that ye may
[1:34:54] not sin
[1:34:55] that is his standards
[1:34:58] because god is perfect
[1:35:02] and we see because god is perfect so his
[1:35:05] standards for his people is absolute
[1:35:07] perfection
[1:35:10] he would not be god if he said these
[1:35:12] things i write to you
[1:35:14] so that you send just
[1:35:17] as little as you can
[1:35:21] no god doesn't want you to sin
[1:35:25] amen the lord jesus did this with a
[1:35:27] woman amen who had been caught uh in the
[1:35:30] act of adultery he said neither do i
[1:35:33] condemn you go and sin
[1:35:36] no more
[1:35:37] because that's what
[1:35:39] he wanted to
[1:35:40] see or do that was his standards god's
[1:35:43] not going to teach any other way
[1:35:48] glory
[1:35:50] hallelujah but at the same time the lord
[1:35:53] knows our what our frame
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:57] he remembers that we are all dust
[1:36:01] amen and so he has what graciously made
[1:36:04] provision for us in the event he says of
[1:36:07] failure and all of these things
[1:36:10] and this is the expression and the word
[1:36:12] says if anyone sins
[1:36:16] then we have an advocate
[1:36:18] with the father jesus christ the
[1:36:20] righteous an advocate is what is one who
[1:36:22] comes amen to the side of another person
[1:36:26] in time of need in order to help amen
[1:36:29] glory this is exactly what the lord
[1:36:31] jesus does for us amen when we actually
[1:36:33] sin
[1:36:38] amen now he's not patting you on the
[1:36:40] back and said it's all right god don't
[1:36:42] even sweep sin under the rug
[1:36:46] god's gonna deal with it
[1:36:48] he's our father
[1:36:51] going to spank us
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:55] if there's going to be anybody not
[1:36:57] spoiling the rod that's going to be our
[1:36:59] father
[1:37:10] he immediately comes to us in order to
[1:37:12] restore us amen to the fellowship
[1:37:15] with himself
[1:37:17] look god don't want to lose fellowship
[1:37:19] with you any more i mean you know and
[1:37:22] what you would want
[1:37:25] he wants to keep in contact he wants
[1:37:27] that amen
[1:37:29] but here notice that it does not say if
[1:37:32] any men confess
[1:37:34] his sins amen
[1:37:37] now as our advocate the lord seeks to
[1:37:39] bring us to that place where we do
[1:37:42] confess and what and forsake our sins
[1:37:50] but there is something very wonderful in
[1:37:52] this verse
[1:37:53] which we should not overlook it says and
[1:37:56] if anyone sins
[1:37:59] we have an advocate
[1:38:02] with the father
[1:38:05] he doesn't become an advocate because i
[1:38:07] confess my sins
[1:38:10] amen
[1:38:12] he is there as soon as it happens he's
[1:38:14] there
[1:38:15] as our advocate
[1:38:17] but there's something about the spirit
[1:38:19] amen that'll struck your heart that you
[1:38:21] will run to god and say i'm sorry
[1:38:25] you will confess and say lord i'm sorry
[1:38:28] amen glory to god
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:35] and here we even like i was telling you
[1:38:37] it doesn't even say with god
[1:38:39] but rather it says with the father
[1:38:42] amen he is still our father amen
[1:38:46] even if we sin
[1:38:48] see this reminds us amen of the blessed
[1:38:51] truth amen that through sin
[1:38:54] in a believer's life amen
[1:38:57] it might break the fellowship but it
[1:39:00] does not break the relationship
[1:39:05] amen
[1:39:07] look when a person is born again
[1:39:10] he cannot
[1:39:12] amen i mean he becomes a child of god
[1:39:19] so god is henceforth his father
[1:39:21] and nothing can ever amen affect that
[1:39:25] relationship a birth
[1:39:29] a birth is something that cannot
[1:39:33] be undone
[1:39:36] amen
[1:39:38] i can undo my natural birth
[1:39:41] amen
[1:39:42] i can't tell my mom and dad and say hey
[1:39:44] i i i just
[1:39:47] changed my mind i don't want to be your
[1:39:48] son
[1:39:52] i don't want you to be my mom you can't
[1:39:54] be my dad amen you can't change that
[1:39:57] amen now you might do things to break
[1:39:59] the fellowship you have even with your
[1:40:02] natural parents that you will not break
[1:40:04] the relationship
[1:40:06] you can
[1:40:11] amen until we are born again how many
[1:40:13] years born again
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:17] glory to god
[1:40:18] but as being born again do you still
[1:40:20] make mistakes i do
[1:40:23] and those mistakes amen sometimes will
[1:40:26] separate the fellowship i have with the
[1:40:28] father but it does not
[1:40:30] separate me from the relationship he
[1:40:33] remains a father i remain a son amen but
[1:40:36] until i can actually amen
[1:40:39] glory
[1:40:40] where i can approach him and maybe
[1:40:42] confess and say i'm sorry
[1:40:45] then i can gain that fellowship again
[1:40:49] amen glory
[1:40:51] look one of those cities is meant
[1:40:53] fellowship
[1:40:56] amen so if i want to gain fellowship i
[1:40:58] need to run back to him
[1:41:01] and say papa god i know i've broken this
[1:41:05] fellowship between you and i
[1:41:07] amen glory
[1:41:09] i want it back
[1:41:12] amen glory then let me tell you
[1:41:14] something he wants it back just as much
[1:41:16] as you do
[1:41:18] he couldn't handle it when adam and eve
[1:41:20] there and then broke their fellowship
[1:41:23] amen with the father
[1:41:25] amen
[1:41:27] glory to god and there was god telling
[1:41:29] them i'm gonna make a way i'm going to
[1:41:32] make a way amen there's going to be a
[1:41:34] city of refuge amen glory
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:41] we'll gain this fellowship again
[1:41:46] hallelujah
[1:41:49] you know as soon as
[1:41:52] soon
[1:41:55] but he is still a son by the fact
[1:41:58] of his birth
[1:42:00] amen but notice that our advocate is
[1:42:02] jesus jesus christ the righteous amen
[1:42:06] it is good to have a righteous defender
[1:42:08] amen
[1:42:10] look when satan brings some accusation
[1:42:12] amen against a believer you and i amen
[1:42:16] the lord can point amen to his finished
[1:42:19] work on calvary and say
[1:42:21] charge that to my account
[1:42:26] glory to god
[1:42:29] and the lord
[1:42:30] our advocate but what is also the
[1:42:33] appropriation well now i can't say these
[1:42:36] words
[1:42:37] for our sins amen this means that by
[1:42:40] dying for us and then he freed us amen
[1:42:43] from the guilt of our sins and restored
[1:42:45] us to god by what providing the needed
[1:42:48] satisfaction amen and by removing every
[1:42:52] barrier and then to fellowship amen
[1:42:54] glory to god
[1:42:57] he made sure that when you're running to
[1:42:59] that city of fellowship amen that the
[1:43:01] path there it was all cleared up for you
[1:43:04] you can run back amen hallelujah glory
[1:43:11] god can show mercy to us because christ
[1:43:13] has satisfied the claim of justice amen
[1:43:16] glory hallelujah there he hung on the
[1:43:19] cross he was becoming what sin
[1:43:22] oh he didn't like it because he was
[1:43:24] separating from his father
[1:43:28] if god if jesus felt that way how much
[1:43:30] more
[1:43:31] we should feel
[1:43:33] amen when we do sin and when we make
[1:43:35] mistakes amen
[1:43:37] glory to god we want to walk find the
[1:43:40] path back to the refuge amen glory
[1:43:43] and on your way back there yes the
[1:43:45] devil's going to try to hinder you amen
[1:43:47] glory but however you fall on your way
[1:43:49] there get up and keep going amen keep
[1:43:52] pressing on going to go
[1:43:54] don't give up
[1:43:57] hallelujah
[1:43:59] amen
[1:44:01] it is not often that an advocate or
[1:44:04] lawyer pays for the client's sin amen
[1:44:07] i've never had a lawyer pay for my
[1:44:08] mistakes
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:15] yet that is what
[1:44:17] our lord has done amen
[1:44:19] and most remarkable of all he paid what
[1:44:21] for them by the sacrifice of himself
[1:44:25] john adds that he is what the satisfying
[1:44:28] sacrifice amen not for our sins only but
[1:44:31] also for the whole world amen
[1:44:37] imagine god way up there saw calvary and
[1:44:40] when that blood was shed
[1:44:42] god said
[1:44:44] i'm satisfied
[1:44:47] and it wasn't just for a special group
[1:44:49] of people
[1:44:50] he said i'm satisfied
[1:44:53] i'm satisfied that it covered the whole
[1:44:55] world's sins amen
[1:44:59] glory to god
[1:45:03] oh hallelujah
[1:45:05] that's why brothers and sisters we've
[1:45:07] got to stay busy if it's a loved one if
[1:45:09] it's a family i don't care neighbor
[1:45:11] maybe you know they're not serving god
[1:45:13] but you can point to the path and you
[1:45:15] can give them the sign and say it's this
[1:45:17] way amen glory to god
[1:45:20] because they still have a chance
[1:45:23] don't give up on anybody
[1:45:26] amen glory to god hallelujah i don't
[1:45:28] know have i kept you too long brother or
[1:45:31] hey man
[1:45:32] maybe just five ten more minutes i don't
[1:45:34] know
[1:45:35] i think you guys only have a morning
[1:45:37] service
[1:45:38] everybody in a hurry to get to the
[1:45:39] mexican restaurant i don't know
[1:45:41] amen glory
[1:45:46] praise god
[1:45:47] well i tell you
[1:45:50] just like the disciples said you know to
[1:45:52] whom shall we go
[1:45:56] oh my he said you're the only one we
[1:45:59] know that's got the eternal life
[1:46:03] he says you're the only one
[1:46:06] this is the only path we know to run to
[1:46:08] it's to you
[1:46:11] glory
[1:46:13] amen
[1:46:15] and i believe that
[1:46:17] christ was preparing the way just like
[1:46:19] john the baptist was preparing the way
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:22] glory
[1:46:23] i believe christ had prepared the way
[1:46:26] amen had cleared it all up for you to
[1:46:28] run to him amen
[1:46:30] where are you going for eternity
[1:46:33] amen glory
[1:46:36] hallelujah
[1:46:43] now here
[1:46:46] now we know just because he was
[1:46:48] satisfied
[1:46:51] this does not mean that the whole world
[1:46:53] is actually saved
[1:46:55] that's a sad part we do know that amen
[1:46:59] but i believe we seek our own salvation
[1:47:00] with fear and trembling
[1:47:04] amen
[1:47:06] but i believe that we should always have
[1:47:08] the attitude to be ready
[1:47:11] to point and say this is the way.
[1:47:15] amen
[1:47:18] but we do know
[1:47:21] him being satisfied it rather it means
[1:47:23] that the work of the lord
[1:47:25] is sufficient
[1:47:28] in value to save all the world but it is
[1:47:30] only efficient to save those who
[1:47:32] actually put their trust in him
[1:47:36] amen
[1:47:37] it is because his work is
[1:47:39] sufficient for all men that the gospel
[1:47:43] amen can be offered to the whole entire
[1:47:45] world
[1:47:48] but if all men were automatically saved
[1:47:51] there would be need
[1:47:53] for the preaching i don't need to do
[1:47:54] this anymore
[1:47:56] that
[1:47:58] it needs saved
[1:48:01] amen
[1:48:02] so the gospel has to be
[1:48:04] preached amen
[1:48:06] it is interesting that you know
[1:48:08] that the superscription and of the uh on
[1:48:11] the cross was written
[1:48:14] in in so many different languages
[1:48:19] and why was god allowing that
[1:48:21] hey that way no one would have an excuse
[1:48:24] what was god doing
[1:48:26] hey that everybody saw a sign
[1:48:29] that this is the way glory to god
[1:48:33] amen
[1:48:34] greek or whatever latin and all of those
[1:48:36] hebrew
[1:48:39] amen it was all written
[1:48:41] it was to proclaim that to all the world
[1:48:44] that jesus christ is what the sufficient
[1:48:47] savior for all men
[1:48:49] everywhere amen
[1:48:52] they had a way to christ amen christ was
[1:48:54] accessible
[1:48:56] hallelujah
[1:48:57] glory to god
[1:49:00] now notice the parallels between the the
[1:49:02] temporal salvation offered
[1:49:04] the manslaughter here he says in the
[1:49:06] cities of the refuge and the eternal
[1:49:09] salvation offered to sinners and christ
[1:49:11] he says the road
[1:49:13] to the city were clear and well marked
[1:49:16] just like the way of salvation amen so
[1:49:18] that none would make a mistake or lose
[1:49:21] his life
[1:49:24] amen
[1:49:26] christ drove people amen to the city of
[1:49:29] refuge and many times a crisis is
[1:49:34] needed to drive people to the lord jesus
[1:49:36] for refuge amen
[1:49:38] and you think this colvin thing was just
[1:49:40] some accident thing
[1:49:43] i believe god was trying to purposely
[1:49:45] drive people amen to himself glory to
[1:49:49] god
[1:49:50] letting the people know hey
[1:49:53] i'm a refuge
[1:49:55] you can come to me amen
[1:49:59] and i believe
[1:50:01] i mean i've heard testimonies through
[1:50:03] the battle of kova amen glory there's
[1:50:05] people there's wives that had testified
[1:50:08] that said my my my husband wouldn't even
[1:50:10] go to church to me amen
[1:50:12] but because of colvin they had the live
[1:50:15] stream
[1:50:16] and the husband had the live stream with
[1:50:18] her and she and he heard the
[1:50:21] word he saw a sign this is the way oh he
[1:50:24] gave his life to the lord and he wanted
[1:50:26] to be baptized amen glory
[1:50:29] god knows what he's doing
[1:50:32] sometimes he does have to send some kind
[1:50:35] of crisis say man glory
[1:50:39] amen there was no neutral ground amen
[1:50:42] for the guilty person amen he was either
[1:50:44] safe in the city or subject to the wrath
[1:50:47] of the blood of that avenger
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:54] each individual is either safe in christ
[1:50:58] or under the judgment of god
[1:51:01] amen there's a scripture in john 3 36 it
[1:51:04] reads like this he says he that
[1:51:06] believeth on the son had everlasting
[1:51:09] life it seems so simple don't
[1:51:14] amen but this part here where it says
[1:51:17] he that believeth that has to be genuine
[1:51:20] it has to be real
[1:51:22] amen and i believe if a man or a woman
[1:51:25] does that
[1:51:26] god sees the heart
[1:51:28] god knows that person
[1:51:31] he promised he would give them
[1:51:32] everlasting life
[1:51:35] amen
[1:51:36] now and when i read scriptures like this
[1:51:38] i'm not talking about
[1:51:40] bride
[1:51:42] amen
[1:51:43] you don't have to be bride to make it in
[1:51:47] amen bride will go into the city
[1:51:51] amen that there's going to be those
[1:51:52] outside the city but i don't care
[1:51:55] lord if that my neighbor is supposed to
[1:51:58] be only outside the city somehow
[1:52:02] rip their
[1:52:03] hearts amen and get in there
[1:52:06] amen and if you're the neighbor then you
[1:52:08] ought to act right talk right amen and
[1:52:10] dress right or whatever amen whatever
[1:52:13] god has placed you there for a purpose
[1:52:15] to be a sign and say this is the way.
[1:52:21] we've got to have the right attitudes
[1:52:22] amen for our neighbor
[1:52:26] amen i believe if you believe you're
[1:52:28] saved how many here believe you saved
[1:52:30] amen the bible teaches us to what
[1:52:34] walk the talk
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:38] don't do all just don't be talking
[1:52:39] talking amen but actually walk your talk
[1:52:43] whatever talk you're claiming walk it
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:47] because people are watching
[1:52:51] amen glory to god
[1:52:54] praise god
[1:52:56] so there he says
[1:52:58] he that believeth on the sun says hath
[1:53:00] everlasting life and he that believeth
[1:53:03] not the son shall not see life but the
[1:53:06] wrath of god
[1:53:07] abideth on him it just seems like pretty
[1:53:10] flat pretty simple and it's the truth
[1:53:15] amen but god has given christ the power
[1:53:18] amen to grant everlasting life to all
[1:53:20] who believe on him amen this is one amen
[1:53:24] of the clearest verses amen and all the
[1:53:26] bible
[1:53:27] on how the person can be saved
[1:53:32] amen it is simply by believing
[1:53:36] in our lord jesus
[1:53:38] christ and as we read this verse say man
[1:53:41] we should realize that god is speaking
[1:53:45] and he is making a promise that can
[1:53:47] never
[1:53:49] be broken
[1:53:52] you understand that right
[1:53:55] amen
[1:53:56] god can say ah
[1:53:58] i didn't really mean that
[1:54:00] i changed my mind
[1:54:01] um if he said it he's got a abide by see
[1:54:05] god when he talks he does walk it
[1:54:09] amen glory to god
[1:54:11] to accept his promise is not a leap in
[1:54:14] the dark amen it is simply believing
[1:54:17] what could not possibly
[1:54:19] be false
[1:54:22] amen glory
[1:54:24] and those
[1:54:26] who do not obey the son of god shall not
[1:54:28] see life
[1:54:30] but the wrath of god abides on them
[1:54:33] already
[1:54:34] my my from this verse we learn that our
[1:54:38] eternal destiny depends on what
[1:54:41] what we do with the son of god
[1:54:46] we've got the signs what do you do when
[1:54:48] you see the signs and you ignore
[1:54:50] you are going to be lost
[1:54:53] you're going to be lost just like the
[1:54:55] world amen
[1:54:57] hallelujah
[1:55:03] he is making a promise amen
[1:55:07] and that promise is ours
[1:55:13] hallelujah now if we receive him i
[1:55:16] believe god gives us eternal life
[1:55:18] as a free gift
[1:55:22] remember that brothers and sisters a
[1:55:24] free
[1:55:26] gift
[1:55:27] i'll tell you what was on my mind what i
[1:55:29] wanted to preach it was going to be
[1:55:30] titled
[1:55:31] being identified by the gifts of god
[1:55:35] but i he he wanted me to preach this
[1:55:38] amen
[1:55:40] but it is a free gift
[1:55:43] amen
[1:55:47] if we reject him
[1:55:49] we will never enjoy
[1:55:51] everlasting life
[1:55:54] amen
[1:55:56] and not only so but god's wrath already
[1:55:58] hangs over
[1:56:00] fall at any moment
[1:56:06] notice that there is nothing in this
[1:56:08] verse
[1:56:09] about keeping the law obeying the golden
[1:56:12] rule or going to church
[1:56:17] amen
[1:56:20] what did he say there in the book of
[1:56:21] john in chapter 8 there in verse 24 he
[1:56:23] said i say therefore unto you that ye
[1:56:26] shall die in your sins for if ye believe
[1:56:29] not that i am he
[1:56:32] ye shall die in your sins
[1:56:36] amen here he solemnly warned them again
[1:56:39] they would die in their sins amen glory
[1:56:42] if they
[1:56:44] steadfastly refuse to believe on him
[1:56:46] there was no
[1:56:49] alternative amen glory apart from the
[1:56:53] lord jesus there is no way to obtain
[1:56:56] forgiveness of sins amen
[1:56:58] and those who die with sins unforgiven
[1:57:00] amen cannot possibly enter into heaven
[1:57:03] at last
[1:57:07] the word
[1:57:09] the word he is not found
[1:57:11] amen
[1:57:15] in this bird you know the he the word he
[1:57:18] in the original scripture if you have a
[1:57:20] really old bible i have one of those
[1:57:22] that actually folds three ways it's a
[1:57:24] really old bible my brother-in-law gave
[1:57:26] it to me and there's times i try to
[1:57:28] compare it you know there are some
[1:57:29] things in there you won't find but in
[1:57:31] that original bible you will not find
[1:57:33] the word he
[1:57:35] where he says i say therefore unto you
[1:57:38] where it says if ye believe not that i
[1:57:40] am he that he is not there it just says
[1:57:43] if you don't believe i am
[1:57:47] amen just like he told moses i am that i
[1:57:50] am
[1:57:53] amen
[1:57:56] it was pretty straight he said i am he
[1:57:58] said and you'll die in your sins
[1:58:04] glory
[1:58:09] but look
[1:58:10] [Music]
[1:58:13] but somehow
[1:58:16] even in there he says you know we can
[1:58:18] even see
[1:58:19] even if you go to the original word
[1:58:22] where that he is not there we see in the
[1:58:24] words where he says i am it's another
[1:58:26] claim to what deity
[1:58:30] by the lord jesus
[1:58:32] oh wow glory to god
[1:58:35] let me close at this
[1:58:37] amen i just want to read
[1:58:39] something to you
[1:58:41] it's a quote
[1:58:43] it's titled uh letting off the pressure
[1:58:46] and it wouldn't be how many years just
[1:58:49] gone through so much but now you can
[1:58:50] come to the refuge amen he's here
[1:58:54] where you can just
[1:58:56] you know let off the pressure
[1:58:58] you're safe now
[1:59:02] god has provided everything you need of
[1:59:04] amen
[1:59:06] you can relax
[1:59:08] amen
[1:59:09] that's one of the things there when
[1:59:10] david stepped into the chapter 23 amen
[1:59:14] where it says that they're in the midst
[1:59:16] of his enemies god has laid a table
[1:59:22] what's that what picture does that give
[1:59:23] you that means it doesn't matter how
[1:59:25] david is fighting his enemies what war
[1:59:28] he's going through god had placed a
[1:59:30] table where god said sit down david
[1:59:33] relax amen glory
[1:59:35] and watch me fight the battles for you
[1:59:37] amen glory
[1:59:41] i mean who places a table in the middle
[1:59:43] of the war
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:48] come on when you're about to fight a an
[1:59:51] army you know and well
[1:59:53] if you were about to fight a war do you
[1:59:56] think of a pizza and pork chops and or
[2:00:00] whatever
[2:00:03] now you're thinking about oh my is that
[2:00:05] the day i'm gonna die or or
[2:00:08] have i trained enough
[2:00:12] am i going to make it
[2:00:14] you'll be so nervous
[2:00:16] amen

[2:14:17] temporal lord the the the world is lord
[2:14:21] it's like the government's trying to
[2:14:22] take a freedom away
[2:14:24] one day it is going to be gone lord of
[2:14:26] god
[2:14:27] but there's one freedom we will not lose
[2:14:29] lord o god because we can look back
