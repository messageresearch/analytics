[2:40] amen and that is until i want no more
[2:45] amen how many of you ever got to place
[2:47] you didn't want no more
[2:49] and i can't really say that amen but
[2:52] i think it expresses that we appreciate
[2:54] amy and the lord's goodness thank you
[2:56] musicians
[2:57] amen praise the lord good to be in the
[2:59] house of the lord amen

[3:10] amen god is good isn't he amen felt a
[3:14] little better out there a little more
[3:15] bearable
[3:16] amen i thought anyway i wasn't in the
[3:18] woods or anything but
[3:20] no not that humidity i know we mowed we
[3:23] waited till about noon yesterday to come
[3:25] to church mow the grass because i like
[3:26] it dry otherwise it
[3:28] clumps up but at noon it was still just
[3:30] wet as you know
[3:31] ever so anyway so yeah the humidity but
[3:34] it does cause the grass to grow so
[3:36] that's all right
[3:37] amen praise the lord but god is good
[3:40] anyway
[3:41] amen i think the weather's got it
[3:43] cooling down just a little bit here the
[3:45] next few weeks
[3:46] so i think it'll be nice if it's as good
[3:48] as what they say anyway
[3:50] anytime you got mid mid 80s you're not
[3:52] too bad off
[3:53] amen praise the lord well i'm sorry to
[3:55] hear about that amen different ones
[3:56] getting that
[3:57] corona i don't know just how bad it is
[3:59] how bad people
[4:00] are have it you know but um you know you
[4:03] are starting to hear
[4:05] uh more of people having it i guess so
[4:08] anyway
[4:09] i think they're talking about it peaking
[4:11] here sometime maybe
[4:12] far too awful long amen the whole
[4:15] world's sick isn't it
[4:17] amen the whole world is sick i think
[4:19] it's certainly a
[4:20] uh applicable i guess spiritually also
[4:23] amen
[4:24] certainly is a sick world we're living
[4:25] in so but we're thankful for the lord
[4:28] how many thanks for the lord jesus
[4:29] christ
[4:30] amen all right but further without
[4:32] further ado let's just bow our heads
[4:34] lord jesus we come before you thanking

[5:35] to saint john
[5:39] saint john 14.
[5:52] amen how many likes to get together and
[5:54] talk about jesus i was thinking that
[5:56] song
[5:56] let's talk about jesus amen that's what
[5:58] we're going to do tonight let's just
[6:00] talk about jesus amen it's always good
[6:03] to talk about the lord
[6:05] saint john 14 1-6 let not your heart be
[6:08] troubled you believe in god believe also
[6:11] in me
[6:12] in my father's house or many mansions
[6:14] and if it were not so i would have told
[6:16] you
[6:17] i go to prepare a place for you and if i
[6:19] go
[6:20] and prepare a place for you i will come
[6:23] again
[6:23] and receive you unto myself that where i
[6:26] am there you may be also
[6:27] and whether i go you know and the way
[6:30] you know
[6:31] thomas said unto him lord we know not
[6:34] whether thou goest
[6:36] and how can we know the way jesus saith
[6:39] unto him
[6:40] i am the way the truth and the life no
[6:42] man cometh unto the father
[6:44] but by me may god it is blessings to the
[6:47] reading of the word
[6:49] amen i want to speak on the waymaker
[6:53] the waymaker tonight amen and so
[6:58] we want to this is going to be really
[7:00] like i said earlier we want to
[7:02] just talk a little bit about
[7:06] the attributes of god how many knows
[7:09] that god has attributes
[7:11] amen and an attribute from the best that
[7:14] i can
[7:15] understand is it's what a person is
[7:19] and what is in a person amen
[7:23] and so an attribute is something that
[7:25] would be displayed you know
[7:28] something that comes out of a person
[7:29] something that's manifested
[7:31] because it's in a person i think brother
[7:33] branham made it pretty
[7:35] uh clear in the way that he explained it
[7:38] that in him
[7:39] was to be father and that right so he
[7:41] had an attribute of being a father
[7:44] and but he didn't have any children so
[7:46] he couldn't be a
[7:47] father right you have to have a have to
[7:50] be
[7:50] have children to have a father and i
[7:53] just look at
[7:54] the natural for just a minute
[7:57] looking at myself or you could probably
[8:00] see yourself as this
[8:02] perhaps at least some of these things
[8:04] would be something that you are you know
[8:06] and
[8:06] one of my attributes would be that i'm
[8:09] a son all right
[8:12] i'm a son not my father
[8:16] right so i have children so i'm a father
[8:18] that's an
[8:19] attribute of me and a grandfather
[8:24] because i have grandchildren and then i
[8:25] also have a husband
[8:28] and i'm a brother
[8:32] all right i'm an uncle i'm a cousin
[8:36] i'm a friend all right
[8:40] and so you know if ever i
[8:43] perhaps save somebody's life they would
[8:46] say man you're my savior
[8:48] and that right if i fought in great
[8:50] battles like napoleon what you know you
[8:52] might be a warrior
[8:54] i'm not a fighter i'm not i'm not
[8:55] considered a warrior in that way but yet
[8:58] i am a warrior in the battle
[8:59] that is in the lord is that right and so
[9:03] forth and then perhaps a deliverer if
[9:05] you was to help somebody out of a hole
[9:07] and save them you would be at their
[9:08] deliverer so
[9:09] though all of those attributes is in us
[9:12] also how many knows that
[9:14] amen but um so that's what god is god is
[9:18] we know we're an amateur god
[9:20] he believes we're an amateur god and in
[9:22] the life in the world that we're living
[9:24] in we find that
[9:25] people are certainly glorifying
[9:29] the attributes that they have and
[9:31] they're right
[9:32] they have they're glorifying that but
[9:34] you know tonight we want to glorify god
[9:37] amen i believe that as we get older amen
[9:40] we realize that there's really
[9:42] less things in this world that
[9:45] perhaps impresses us as much as what it
[9:49] used to
[9:52] amen it doesn't mean as much to us
[9:55] anymore amen and as i as i get older i
[9:59] begin
[10:00] and you know when i preach this maybe
[10:01] over and over again but
[10:03] i begin to look at god and i get more
[10:05] impressed with god
[10:07] and what he is am right and the
[10:10] attributes of what god is
[10:13] amen what what he is and that's what we
[10:15] want to talk about tonight is
[10:17] one of his attributes all right well
[10:19] this is one of the attributes and this
[10:21] is
[10:21] of course just one you know and it but
[10:24] he has many he has so many
[10:26] i believe one place the bible talks
[10:27] about it on him was many crowns
[10:31] why because he's the king of kings he's
[10:33] lord of lords
[10:34] he's he's so much he's he has so many
[10:37] things that he
[10:39] is what we would call the best at
[10:43] there's nobody does it better than him
[10:49] amen i believe brother brennan one time
[10:51] whenever
[10:52] uh they had a healing service the one
[10:54] night and different ones got healed and
[10:55] so forth and then the next day
[10:57] they put that flyer out you know that
[10:59] brother branham was false and he was the
[11:00] fbi was going to expose him
[11:02] for being simon the sorcerer or whatever
[11:04] you know this all this rigamarole in it
[11:06] had everybody tell her up because they
[11:08] put them flyers on everybody can you
[11:09] imagine the riffraff that would that
[11:11] cause
[11:12] you know and those girls i guess some
[11:14] girls came to him you know that got
[11:15] healed or whatever they said brother
[11:16] brandon we don't know what to do we
[11:18] don't know what to do
[11:20] y'all remember that story and uh
[11:23] so he says you know last night sisters
[11:25] you saw jesus
[11:27] as a healer come to come to church
[11:30] tonight tonight
[11:32] you're going to see him as a warrior
[11:36] oh my you're going to see him fight a
[11:38] battle
[11:39] all right and y'all remember brother
[11:41] brown come up he says now i understand
[11:43] that the fbi
[11:44] is going to expose me tonight so i say
[11:46] to them if the fbi
[11:48] i'm not sure if it was exact words but
[11:50] something to the effect if i remember
[11:52] hearing it right he said so mr fbi man
[11:54] come on down now and expose me
[11:58] something to that extent so you can
[12:00] imagine the congregation and that right
[12:02] and how
[12:03] quiet they were and uh oh my everybody's
[12:05] at their edge there see what's happening
[12:07] here what's going to go on here you know
[12:10] and he says you know it isn't the fbi at
[12:13] all but what he says but it's nothing
[12:15] but a couple backslid preachers
[12:17] that have put this together you know
[12:19] they have put this together and put this
[12:21] out to cause disruption
[12:23] and the one of them sitting up there in
[12:24] the balcony up there with the white suit
[12:26] on
[12:27] the other one's sitting right over there
[12:32] that was jesus doing the battle right he
[12:35] knew exactly who it was
[12:37] because brother branham god would reveal
[12:39] to him exactly what it was
[12:40] and them guys coward and hello
[12:43] he coward
[12:48] found the door got out of there you know
[12:51] what it is that's what he said they did
[12:54] and then that was jesus fighting as a
[12:56] warrior
[13:00] now you know that's part of the reason
[13:02] brother brennan when he was here he
[13:03] he always he always said can anybody any
[13:06] time
[13:07] any place tell me come show me where
[13:10] when the holy spirit spoke through him
[13:12] that that was ever wrong one time i
[13:15] challenge you to come to me and tell me
[13:18] am i right how many knows that he was
[13:21] never challenged
[13:22] oh brother brandon was going to be
[13:25] challenged at one time because they were
[13:27] going to challenge him on the serpent
[13:28] see the waterhead those 70 preachers up
[13:30] there right
[13:31] but come to find out you know he had
[13:33] brother batman told him about not having
[13:35] the room in this side of the other
[13:36] they're not going to have the room and
[13:38] and so forth and there because the holy
[13:39] spirit warned him that there's a trap
[13:41] laid for him
[13:42] they did challenge him back in the day
[13:43] you know but he
[13:45] even challenged them back and says again
[13:47] this was a warrior situation
[13:49] and he says you know come on up now and
[13:51] anyone that wants to dispute the water
[13:53] baptism or the serpent seed is to come
[13:55] stand by my side
[13:58] now the angel i told brother brandon he
[14:00] says i will be by your right side i will
[14:02] be by your side go ahead
[14:04] that's the one time that the brother of
[14:05] anthem had the right and the permission
[14:07] from god
[14:08] to challenge him because most of the
[14:10] time in a dispute or a debate
[14:12] he didn't know part of it isn't that
[14:13] right if both word took it for him one
[14:15] time
[14:16] he said i'll take the challenge but but
[14:18] the band says i don't believe in this
[14:19] beating over this one time the angels
[14:20] told him yeah go ahead you go ahead and
[14:22] you go up there i'll be by your side
[14:24] and brother manager he said now come up
[14:26] here with your bible and stand
[14:28] by my side later on he says they're
[14:31] probably struck
[14:32] that angel would have killed him
[14:35] because they'd been standing right there
[14:36] by that angel let me tell you something
[14:38] people started walking up these steps
[14:40] and fall over down back a tobling
[14:42] he'd be saying okay anyone else huh
[14:47] would anybody else bring the bible up
[14:48] here welcome to it
[14:50] huh but let you know but they didn't but
[14:54] the mom says they were smarter than i
[14:55] thought they were because they didn't
[14:56] even come up and challenge it
[14:58] because that man that that friend of his
[15:00] that he had told
[15:02] that he would not get the room and there
[15:03] would be a certain kind of person
[15:04] sitting over here a certain kind of
[15:06] person sitting over here certain time
[15:07] person sitting over here when he got up
[15:09] he says y'all might want to do this with
[15:11] brother he says but he told me yesterday
[15:13] that man was going to sit there he told
[15:15] me yesterday that man was going to sit
[15:16] there he told me
[15:18] yeah that man was going to sit there and
[15:21] that'd be enough just can't dare anybody
[15:25] that right i'd back off too and so they
[15:28] did but that's just the way that god
[15:30] works
[15:31] and amen i mean he's glad to know
[15:34] that that's what you are following
[15:37] you're following the living god
[15:41] that the same god that was with israel
[15:44] over in the red sea and so forth
[15:46] that fought against pharaoh that father
[15:48] that david that fought against that
[15:49] goliath
[15:50] that very same god is the one you and i
[15:54] are following and serving this morning
[15:56] this evening
[15:57] amen how many is glad for a god that has
[15:59] attributes that takes care of things
[16:03] praise the lord but anyway so
[16:07] you know that then god says you know he
[16:08] always you know nothing
[16:10] and the point that i was wanting to try
[16:12] to get to that i didn't even get to yet
[16:13] but
[16:14] you know while he was alive sure he got
[16:17] challenged sure people said stuff
[16:20] but you know look at what people are
[16:22] doing today
[16:24] huh they're saying all kinds of stuff
[16:26] like he's a false prophet
[16:28] like this wasn't right over here right
[16:30] over there this out of the other at
[16:31] least don't mind
[16:32] you know why did you you know he was
[16:34] probably wasn't even here whenever he
[16:35] was here but
[16:36] they don't have that kind of courage hey
[16:39] man they did
[16:40] you know oh my it's just it's terrible
[16:43] i'd be scared for them if they were here
[16:46] amen i'm scared for them now you know
[16:50] that it's not going to be a good thing
[16:51] when they stand before god
[16:53] while he was living nobody said and
[16:55] remember
[16:56] remember how that god told moses he says
[17:00] you know that nothing's going to stand
[17:02] in your way
[17:03] and then when joshua took over the
[17:04] ministry he told joshua too he says
[17:06] nobody
[17:07] is going to be able to stand in your way
[17:10] and that brother bannon was told that
[17:11] same thing there ain't nothing going to
[17:13] be standing in your way
[17:14] nothing's going to stop you nothing's
[17:16] going to stand in your way of of going
[17:18] on because god is with you
[17:20] that's why the witch doctors over
[17:22] germany and different places that
[17:24] they would have the actual tent he was
[17:26] in coming up with wind and
[17:27] a storm that they brought up and brewed
[17:29] up and they were gonna blow it away this
[17:31] side of the other and the prophet would
[17:32] speak
[17:33] and calm the storm is that right
[17:36] why because those angels were there to
[17:39] make it right to make it good
[17:41] amen nothing was going to stand in this
[17:43] way
[17:44] praise be to god tonight praise the lord
[17:47] i
[17:47] aren't you glad tonight to know that
[17:50] you're serving
[17:51] the living god
[17:55] praise be to god now isn't it something
[17:57] in our scene here
[17:59] how that jesus was there and he was in
[18:01] the middle of jake john there
[18:03] and he got to talking about them talking
[18:05] to them and telling them they know that
[18:07] in my father's there's many mansions and
[18:09] if it were not so i would have told you
[18:11] but i'm going to go and i'm going to
[18:13] prepare a place for you
[18:15] let it be a piece a lot of message on
[18:16] preparedness and how to
[18:18] uh how to god before the foundation of
[18:20] the world notice even now this just
[18:22] comes to mind
[18:24] out of jesus said you know on the
[18:25] judgment day he says oh sheep on the
[18:28] right side and so forth
[18:29] he says enter into the joint of the lord
[18:32] that was prepared for you
[18:34] from the foundation of the world how
[18:36] many believes that
[18:37] amen that kingdom over there in heaven
[18:40] over there it has been prepared
[18:42] for you it is ready for you it is
[18:44] waiting for you
[18:46] god has prepared it already
[18:50] now i want to talk about jesus providing
[18:52] him to making a way the main thing we
[18:54] want to try to focus on if i possibly
[18:56] can
[18:56] and then it's the uh the the how did god
[18:59] always makes a way
[19:03] i listened to other man today on god
[19:05] making away men many different
[19:06] messages he spoke on but the one thing
[19:08] that stand out for me is that
[19:10] everything that we have need of no
[19:12] matter what it is
[19:14] god makes a way for it
[19:18] how many thankful for that i was sitting
[19:21] back there in my study
[19:23] and i just got you know got the writing
[19:25] down
[19:26] and then it says you know there is no
[19:28] question
[19:29] that he hasn't got the answer for
[19:35] there is no problem that he doesn't have
[19:38] the solution
[19:39] for
[19:44] why we ought to be running around the
[19:45] building right about now
[19:48] huh no matter think about you know how
[19:51] many questions
[19:52] go through our mind you know how many
[19:53] questions there is in the world
[19:55] sure there's a lot of questions but
[19:57] there's not one that he don't have the
[19:59] answer for
[20:01] [Music]
[20:05] i want to back up this a little bit
[20:06] because i believe that
[20:08] god is infallible
[20:11] talk about jesus is that all right that
[20:14] he's perfect
[20:16] all right so that just automatically
[20:20] almost is more than my fuse box can
[20:22] handle it wants to flip a breaker
[20:25] because it's so big huh
[20:29] to think that god cannot ever
[20:32] make a mistake i was thinking you know
[20:36] what
[20:36] if somebody would claim hey you know
[20:39] right here i can show you where he
[20:41] messed up
[20:43] or where he didn't hold and keep his
[20:45] word
[20:47] if you found one fault in god wouldn't
[20:50] that be terrible
[20:52] because that's making fallible just one
[20:56] isn't that right just one mistake
[21:00] just one word unfulfilled would make him
[21:04] fallible he's not
[21:05] he is infallible aren't you glad to
[21:08] serve a god like that
[21:11] oh my if he says something if his word
[21:14] says something
[21:15] it absolutely has to come to pass
[21:23] let me say something else if he thinks
[21:26] something huh if he thinks something it
[21:30] has to come to pass
[21:33] do you realize that if he didn't think
[21:36] of you
[21:37] being in heaven you're never going to be
[21:40] there
[21:42] why because he knew where you would be
[21:45] is that right he knows whether you'll be
[21:47] there
[21:47] or down yonder and if he thought of you
[21:50] up there
[21:52] all right then that's where you're gonna
[21:54] be
[21:56] period
[22:01] too much you're not right to think about
[22:04] it there ain't no way probably gotta
[22:06] tell you it's impossible for you not to
[22:08] make it
[22:11] you can no more pass away than god can
[22:13] pass away
[22:15] because his thoughts are eternal
[22:19] amen praise be the god
[22:24] oh my when i got to thinking about this
[22:26] and meditating on this i just
[22:28] about had me a jubilee
[22:31] oh my just think about it isn't it
[22:34] something that
[22:34] there's something in this world that you
[22:37] can meditate upon
[22:38] that can actually just get you to almost
[22:41] have a running fit
[22:44] and i don't know hardly anything in the
[22:45] world except this for sure
[22:48] this is the one thing that you can think
[22:50] about that you can meditate about
[22:54] amen you know what i did this week
[22:58] i tried to practice what i preached you
[23:01] know
[23:02] and i talked about how that we can get
[23:05] so
[23:05] busy with the things of the world that
[23:08] don't bring us joy am i right
[23:10] so busy with it until it brings a weight
[23:13] upon us
[23:14] and it actually can bring depression
[23:16] because the more you worry about stuff
[23:18] the more depressed you can get
[23:20] the more weight down you can get
[23:25] and i'm thinking about this should be
[23:28] taken care of and
[23:29] that should be taken care of and i could
[23:31] go do this and i said no
[23:33] thomas you're not doing it
[23:36] i had to make myself stay before the
[23:39] lord because i remember what the prophet
[23:40] said he says the minister shouldn't be
[23:42] so busy out there
[23:43] he has to have his quiet time he has to
[23:46] have that quiet time with the lord
[23:49] if he expects god to use him that he
[23:51] better have somebody
[23:52] said no no that don't need to be done
[23:56] i need to keep my mind on here why
[23:58] because you get so busy
[24:00] until you can't concentrate on the lord
[24:02] and i want to tell you something folks
[24:04] i don't care if you're laying in your
[24:05] bed at night think about the lord before
[24:07] you go to sleep as long as you can
[24:10] when you wake up they lay there an extra
[24:12] 15 minutes just to think about the lord
[24:15] it'll actually do you good david talked
[24:18] about meditating to him
[24:21] and the night watches and so forth while
[24:23] i'm leaping on the bed amen
[24:25] while i'm getting up wherever they're
[24:26] thinking about him
[24:28] it'll actually change your demeanor
[24:32] it'll change your atmosphere your wife
[24:35] will like you better
[24:37] your husband will like you better
[24:39] because you'll have a better attitude
[24:41] if you've been basking in the presence
[24:43] of god
[24:45] that's where the problem is if we don't
[24:49] drink the medicine that's inside the
[24:51] doctor's office as we sit on the
[24:52] doorstep
[24:53] and boohoo about not feeling good
[24:59] let me say it again because the prophet
[25:01] did he says you know they're not he
[25:02] described it that way that that's where
[25:04] the problem
[25:05] is is that people you know
[25:08] the solution is there it's right inside
[25:11] of the office there but they will sit
[25:13] on the doctor's doorstep and they will
[25:15] not go inside and take the medicine and
[25:17] they will actually
[25:18] die at the doctor's doorstep
[25:23] how many believe that this is the doctor
[25:25] this is dr jesus
[25:27] and he'll come to his door but they
[25:29] don't want to go in
[25:30] and get the things that he has to walk
[25:32] he's going to give them they still want
[25:33] a little bit of their own way
[25:37] and they will die right outside of the
[25:41] door
[25:42] how many of these doors open whosoever
[25:45] will let him come
[25:47] welcome hello it ain't got no call us by
[25:51] appointment
[25:52] just stay in your car and we will give
[25:54] you give us a call and we'll
[25:56] come out and help you hello how many is
[25:57] tired of that stuff
[26:01] i like to go and talk to a person you
[26:02] know but he's gotten that way
[26:05] no it's not like that it's come on in
[26:08] we got the medicine that'll cure your
[26:11] problem
[26:14] amen how many believe that all right
[26:17] and it's done me good lord just help me
[26:19] not to be too busy how many of us
[26:21] how many of you is with me you practice
[26:24] while i preach between now and sunday
[26:26] will you
[26:28] all right you practice a little bit
[26:30] taking more time the lord
[26:31] meditate on him let him reveal things
[26:34] give you fresh revelation
[26:35] get you a little revival going on
[26:40] how many wants of revival say lord i
[26:42] still need a revival
[26:44] i need a revival lord that's right well
[26:47] it's there
[26:48] amen praise be to god all right
[26:52] so we think about that and how that god
[26:56] has provided first of all
[26:59] the bible says this
[27:04] that without god there was not anything
[27:07] made that was made
[27:10] another scripture says that god has
[27:12] freely
[27:13] given us everything that he has made
[27:17] he has given us all things freely to
[27:20] enjoy
[27:26] which one of you parents if your child
[27:28] really wants something they'll get it
[27:29] for them
[27:31] now if you do it all the time you spoil
[27:33] them right but most of the time if you
[27:35] have a child and you really they really
[27:38] want something if you possibly can it
[27:40] makes them happy you're going to get it
[27:41] for them
[27:42] and that's the way our heavenly father
[27:44] is he knows he knew
[27:46] what you would want
[27:52] and so he made a way for you to have it
[28:01] think about it aaron's the seat that
[28:04] you're sitting on is it comfortable
[28:07] well god made it for you so you could
[28:10] enjoy your comfort everybody enjoy a
[28:11] comfortable seat
[28:13] yeah he made
[28:17] the cloth he made the material he made
[28:19] the wood he made everything
[28:20] we just put it together am i right all
[28:23] everything
[28:23] everything has been provided by him for
[28:26] us
[28:27] huh praise the lord
[28:31] air conditioning huh come on people it's
[28:35] hot out
[28:36] you ought to give the lord say thank you
[28:38] lord fair conditioning
[28:41] that's right think about it it was his
[28:43] goodness
[28:45] it's his grace i don't care what it is
[28:48] it all comes from him all good
[28:51] things come from god everything good
[28:57] everything bad
[28:59] comes from you know who we don't like
[29:03] him so much we don't talk about him
[29:04] around here too much
[29:06] other than we're rebuking him and
[29:07] kicking him out the door all the time
[29:12] that right yeah
[29:15] not those doors these doors
[29:19] that door that door that oh how many
[29:21] that's what's got to go out of god at
[29:23] the door of your heart get on out
[29:26] i am so depressed you got to get out
[29:29] devil
[29:31] i'm not wanting to be depressed anymore
[29:33] huh
[29:37] amen praise the lord but tonight we want
[29:41] to talk about the attribute
[29:43] of provider of
[29:46] providing a way and
[29:50] the waymaker i like that song they got
[29:53] out with he's a waymaker
[29:54] i mean at least he's a waymaker he's the
[29:57] way
[29:58] maker all right
[30:02] so he says listen there's no problem
[30:04] that he doesn't have the solution
[30:06] for
[30:14] wouldn't you love to say that tell the
[30:16] that to the white house
[30:18] there ain't no question that y'all got
[30:20] jesus can't answer
[30:22] there ain't no problem that you all got
[30:24] that jesus can't take care of
[30:28] huh there ain't nothing that he can't
[30:31] fix
[30:34] that's right praise be to god
[30:38] but what are they gonna do one place i
[30:40] really wanted to quote one i wanted to
[30:42] pull one quote out where brother braham
[30:43] says you know
[30:45] man just hates god's way
[30:48] humanity just hates god's way they don't
[30:52] like his way they don't want his way
[30:54] two two aspects i want to talk about
[30:56] with the help of the lord that is
[30:58] how that the lord always makes a way and
[31:01] the other one is
[31:03] people not accepting that way
[31:06] refusing that way just think about jesus
[31:10] here telling his disciples
[31:13] he says you know i go
[31:16] to prepare a place for you so there they
[31:19] were
[31:20] following their leader their leader was
[31:22] talking about
[31:23] leaving i'm not always going to be with
[31:26] y'all
[31:27] i'm going to leave but from now on he
[31:31] said
[31:32] you know the way all right you know what
[31:36] he said
[31:36] you know the way from now on
[31:41] where i go you know
[31:44] and the way you know
[31:47] thomas says lord
[31:51] we know not is that right
[31:55] straight up jesus you are so wrong
[31:58] huh that's what he said
[32:01] jesus just said you know where i'm going
[32:04] and you know the way
[32:05] thomas says nope
[32:09] we know not whether thou goest and how
[32:12] can we know the way
[32:15] huh
[32:20] thomas knew it and didn't know it didn't
[32:22] new did he know i guess
[32:30] and jesus said what
[32:33] thomas i am
[32:36] the way you're looking at the way
[32:40] you've got the way with you i am
[32:43] the way follow me
[32:46] and i'll take you to that place and i'm
[32:49] going to
[32:50] make ready a place for you i guess one
[32:53] of the last things i want to talk about
[32:55] tonight now maybe go ahead and just
[32:56] speak it now
[32:57] but that is that even in death isn't
[33:00] that right
[33:02] how many believes god has a place he
[33:04] doesn't leave you hanging
[33:05] now this is also what i wanted to say
[33:08] one of
[33:09] the scariest most
[33:12] shakenest most horrible
[33:16] places that you'll ever come to in life
[33:19] okay is you come to places you'll have
[33:23] questions that you don't have an answer
[33:25] for you'll have a problem that you won't
[33:27] have a solution for
[33:29] how many knows those are bad places to
[33:31] be
[33:33] you'll accomplish you'll come to a
[33:34] problem that you don't know how to fix
[33:38] you don't know how to overcome
[33:42] huh that's those are bad places to be
[33:48] but i'm so thankful that the lord said
[33:51] that he always makes
[33:52] a way
[33:56] the lord hears the red prayers of the
[33:58] righteous and deliver them
[34:00] and believe that
[34:04] i want to tell you something else
[34:07] and we're probably at that place we'll
[34:10] we'll probably come to that place
[34:12] no doubt but that will come to a place
[34:14] brother brad that we've never been
[34:16] before
[34:19] let me say this i believe that we'll
[34:21] probably come to a place
[34:23] that we never expect it to be
[34:28] because we don't know exactly how this
[34:30] thing's going to wind up
[34:33] we got our preconceived ideas but
[34:35] brother baby says when you think you got
[34:36] it all figured out mark it down
[34:38] you probably got it wrong
[34:41] and can you imagine if things is little
[34:43] different than what we thought
[34:45] how upset we might be like
[34:49] well it's not supposed to go this way
[34:51] right
[34:54] i didn't expect this to happen
[34:58] can i just say what comes to mind we
[35:01] expect the democrats to bring on the
[35:02] mark of the priest
[35:04] huh maybe it'll be the republicans
[35:08] huh you never know which way it'll go
[35:11] because we both
[35:11] we know one thing they're both led by
[35:13] the devil
[35:15] isn't that right it could go sharp right
[35:18] it could go sharp left huh
[35:22] could go any which direction but this
[35:24] one thing we know god's going to fulfill
[35:26] these scriptures
[35:27] one way or the other but this one
[35:30] comfort that we have one comfort that we
[35:32] can have
[35:33] and that is that if we come to that
[35:34] place like where god loves to bring his
[35:37] people
[35:38] he likes to bring you to places you
[35:40] didn't expect to be
[35:43] because if you're expecting it ah
[35:46] no problem right but if you're not
[35:49] expecting it
[35:51] that's where the hard thing comes
[35:54] to have to face issues and things that
[35:56] you are not expecting
[35:58] and that you do not know how to handle
[36:02] huh an illustration of
[36:05] and i heard brother ramsey and god make
[36:07] it away he's talking about the three
[36:08] hebrew children he says you know if they
[36:10] had a scripture where it says you know
[36:12] they're going to throw god's children
[36:14] into the fiery furnace and god's going
[36:15] to deliver them brother baby says it
[36:17] would have been easy but they had no
[36:18] scripture
[36:20] that said that that would happen
[36:24] he just said they had this one thing he
[36:26] says we don't know if he will but we
[36:28] know that god
[36:29] is able but says that's what you got to
[36:33] do
[36:33] amen if you're ever going to get
[36:34] anything from god you have got to know
[36:36] that he is able to do it
[36:42] you got to listen to that in 62 he says
[36:44] you know it's not that we just have to
[36:45] hope for it or
[36:46] maybe god will do it now you can come
[36:48] and say god your word is said it
[36:50] i'm trusting and i'm accepting it i'm
[36:52] believing what you have said
[36:54] god that's how we can come to him now he
[36:55] says amen
[37:00] so perhaps not expected perhaps they
[37:03] never
[37:04] expect that to be thrown all the way
[37:07] into the furnace
[37:10] huh i think i really think this is a
[37:14] good warning for us
[37:16] both people that are here and people on
[37:18] on the internet
[37:20] a warning for us and that is that we may
[37:23] come to that place that we are not
[37:25] expecting
[37:26] that we're not aware of
[37:29] huh but the important thing is going to
[37:32] be
[37:32] is that we trust in the one that is
[37:35] promised to make your way
[37:41] always promised to make
[37:44] a way
[37:48] so the three hebrew children they didn't
[37:49] expect it but guess what
[37:52] you know it wasn't the flood that came
[37:58] it wasn't the angel of water that just
[38:00] brought in a gully washer and drowned
[38:02] that
[38:02] fire huh wasn't that at all
[38:06] no they actually got thrown into the
[38:08] midst of the fire
[38:10] right and i'd like for some
[38:14] scientists to tell me what in the world
[38:17] how a person can be
[38:18] in the fire that is white hot
[38:22] right how many knows what white coals
[38:23] are i mean why
[38:25] seven times hotter than normal
[38:31] and just walking around there the flames
[38:34] licking all over their body and not even
[38:38] singing one little air
[38:44] somebody said praise the lord how many
[38:47] believes that that god can actually put
[38:49] you in the middle of something
[38:51] that if you are surrendered and i want
[38:53] to say this amen that that's what god's
[38:55] looking for if you really want to see
[38:57] the power of god
[38:58] he god is looking for somebody that is
[39:00] surrendered
[39:01] to him that is yielded to him
[39:05] the three hebrew they were completely in
[39:07] the hands of god
[39:09] and god took care of them
[39:13] took the fire out of the flames
[39:17] he was the creator of the fire he knew
[39:20] exactly what chemicals to bring out of
[39:22] it to take the heat out of it
[39:24] and they could walk around in about 68
[39:27] degree
[39:28] air conditioning huh
[39:33] that's right they didn't come out there
[39:37] if they had a little i don't know i
[39:38] don't wear no clone but whatever
[39:40] cologne a man wears or i guess it's
[39:42] clone right you don't want to wear a
[39:44] perfume perfume with a woman's but
[39:47] cologne come out there you still smell
[39:49] just like he went in
[39:50] shadrach meshach and abednego
[39:55] and not even what hair is since
[39:59] see in the middle of the way that you
[40:01] don't know how god's going to do it it
[40:03] don't matter how
[40:04] tall how complicated it is god will find
[40:07] a way
[40:09] god always makes a way
[40:14] how many believes that god made a way in
[40:16] the days of noah for
[40:18] people not to dawn he says go into the
[40:19] ark he'll be safe he made a way for him
[40:23] before he drowned everybody with the
[40:25] rain and the flood
[40:27] he warned them all and he actually made
[40:29] a way for him
[40:31] and not only made a way but begged them
[40:34] to come for
[40:36] 120
[40:45] every year that goes by those tapes
[40:49] are the long-suffering almighty god to
[40:51] the world
[40:56] god knew there's a fire coming how many
[40:57] knows god said it's gonna burn
[41:00] and what did he what did he do he sent
[41:02] jesus christ
[41:04] to save us and he sent malachi 4 to get
[41:07] himself out of the muck
[41:08] and the mire of denominationalism to
[41:11] pull us on out of there
[41:12] and to have us ready he sent the prophet
[41:15] just like he said noah
[41:16] before the flood came he said another
[41:19] prophet before the fire is going to fall
[41:24] amen
[41:28] those who accept god's way will escape
[41:33] how many believe that if you accept
[41:35] god's way
[41:36] if you go god's way that he provides
[41:41] god's way is not iffy it's not well
[41:44] maybe you might
[41:46] when you get in god's path and you
[41:48] follow him you're going to make it
[41:50] is that right just keep following him
[41:53] there's not going to be no your fans or
[41:55] butts
[41:56] but the thing of it is and we already
[42:00] know what
[42:00] brother bam said he says there's only
[42:02] two ways in this world and that's god's
[42:04] way in your way
[42:06] amen your way he said he's always wrong
[42:09] and his way is always right
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] his way is never wrong you'll
[42:17] never go wrong following god's way and
[42:20] you'll never go right
[42:21] following your own way
[42:25] it has to be god's way
[42:29] praise be to god but better batman
[42:32] mentions it and especially in the line
[42:34] of
[42:34] cain and then so
[42:37] many millions of people they do not want
[42:41] god's way they want to do it their way
[42:48] there is a way okay there is a way the
[42:50] true way
[42:51] is to follow christ to take up your
[42:53] cross and follow him
[42:55] in that right it might not be an easy
[42:57] path but it's a glorious path and i'm
[42:59] glad that god got me on it
[43:02] i would rather have it than any other
[43:03] way in the world
[43:05] but there's the other way the other way
[43:08] is hey man you're just gonna throw out
[43:10] god's way you're gonna do what you want
[43:12] live how you want
[43:15] drink all you want smoke all you want
[43:17] party all you want commit all the
[43:18] adultery that you want
[43:21] huh you're gonna do whatever you want
[43:23] and there's so many people
[43:25] that are that away and they don't worry
[43:28] about
[43:28] the consequences
[43:32] they don't mind reaping the consequences
[43:36] later on because there will be
[43:39] consequences
[43:41] churches and denominations the same way
[43:44] religious
[43:44] oh yeah you know we know that jesus
[43:47] comes and he vindicates and he proves to
[43:49] what the prophetic god was saying
[43:50] we know jesus always comes they no man
[43:53] can stand in the front of the prophet of
[43:55] god but the angel is there
[43:57] huh but we still want to do it our way
[44:02] my church don't teach that
[44:06] go ahead go your way think about it
[44:10] i'll hit it for the fire
[44:15] anything outside of god's way that he's
[44:18] provided
[44:19] will burn
[44:23] and the sad thing is just like it was in
[44:25] the days of noah
[44:29] no doubt but noah had scratched mark's
[44:31] sister johnny
[44:32] on the outside of the door scratching
[44:35] and clawing
[44:37] there was probably blood on the outside
[44:39] where they clawed until their fingers
[44:41] bled
[44:41] they were wanting to get in
[44:46] they were wanting to get in
[44:50] and i can say thus saith the scripture
[44:53] so will it be in this day
[44:56] because he says they'll call early
[45:00] they'll call but i will not answer
[45:02] they'll come they'll seek me but they
[45:04] will not find me
[45:06] they'll call upon me but i will not
[45:08] answer because when i did call when i
[45:11] didn't reach out my arm
[45:14] and regard it i didn't want it
[45:17] if i got to let my hair grow and be holy
[45:19] and live righteous and speak in tongues
[45:21] and
[45:22] and shout and be a christian and a holy
[45:24] i don't want all that
[45:26] they don't want all that well go ahead
[45:29] is that right
[45:31] but it's phenomenal how that that
[45:34] most of the people in this world want to
[45:36] go their way they don't want god's
[45:38] provided way
[45:39] they don't want the way that god makes
[45:41] they don't want the answer that god has
[45:44] they don't want the solution to their
[45:46] problem they love their problem too much
[45:53] amen oh my can i say something tonight
[45:57] amen if you don't want the solution if
[46:00] you don't really want the solution
[46:02] you're going to stay and love your
[46:04] problem
[46:06] but if you want a solution to your
[46:08] problem god has it
[46:13] in the medical world there is no
[46:16] sickness
[46:17] that god don't have medicine for
[46:21] let me believe that in god's medicine
[46:24] cabinet
[46:25] it doesn't matter if it's cancer it
[46:26] don't matter what it is
[46:29] huh leprosy
[46:33] even a foot needing to grow up huh
[46:37] that don't happen outside of a miracle
[46:39] isn't that right
[46:41] feet growing out or whatever it might be
[46:43] god has the solution for it
[46:46] it's there praise the lord let me just
[46:49] say what comes to mind is that all right
[46:53] just think about it now if god has got
[46:56] a remedy for every problem that we have
[47:00] it doesn't matter
[47:01] what it is
[47:05] but we really think about that he's got
[47:07] the solution
[47:09] and then we ask ourselves then why do i
[47:12] still have this problem
[47:13] well the prophet god taught us
[47:17] that if god ever healed a man isn't that
[47:20] right
[47:23] you ever healed a man on certain
[47:25] conditions
[47:27] if you meet those certain conditions
[47:30] you're guaranteed to get healed
[47:38] you need the holy ghost meet those
[47:41] conditions god is guaranteed he's got to
[47:44] meet it again
[47:45] [Music]
[47:49] he even told the devil's child
[47:53] that if you do what my child did i'll
[47:56] accept you
[48:02] he told cain do what you planted on and
[48:05] you'll be accepted
[48:10] humans are so hardheaded you can beat
[48:13] them over the head with a ball bat
[48:15] brother peter they still don't get it
[48:20] they still don't get it they refuse
[48:23] to get it
[48:27] humanity out let me tell you something
[48:30] outside of the children of god it's
[48:32] really bad
[48:34] it's chaos it's a brute piece world
[48:39] it's a dog-eat-dog world outside of the
[48:42] children of god
[48:45] disobedient to parents isn't that right
[48:48] traitors haiti high-minded lovers of
[48:50] pleasure more than god truths break
[48:53] everything in the book you name it
[48:56] they'll do it
[48:56] all they don't want
[49:00] the solution how many wants the solution
[49:04] say god i want the solution i want the
[49:07] way
[49:08] i want your way
[49:11] god don't let me have my way let me
[49:15] say this that this applies to your
[49:17] everyday life is what we're talking
[49:18] about here
[49:19] not just accepting salvation or getting
[49:21] the holy ghost no that's the way that
[49:23] you live
[49:23] every day has to be god's way for you to
[49:26] be a real christian or be a real
[49:28] real christian it's the way that we live
[49:31] every day it's the way we do every day
[49:33] it's the way we think every day
[49:35] that's god's way because he wants 100
[49:40] control of you amen
[49:45] praise the lord all right
[49:49] isn't it wonderful to glorify god i
[49:52] don't rather
[49:53] do that than some basketball player or
[49:55] some football player
[49:57] huh the nfl oh do you have nfl
[50:03] what are they all gonna do kneel next
[50:05] just tweaked the air right out of me
[50:07] didn't
[50:07] you i really don't care about watching
[50:10] them anymore
[50:16] that's right the whole world there's
[50:18] there's no glory in it anymore
[50:20] there's no there's no prestige there's
[50:23] no what he might call
[50:25] i don't know glory i guess you know
[50:28] why it's falling apart this is the only
[50:31] thing that we can glory in
[50:35] paul said you know we don't glory in
[50:37] ourselves paul was not glory in himself
[50:41] let our glory be in christ because he is
[50:43] worthy of what
[50:45] all the glory amen
[50:48] praise the lord all right it's no
[50:52] sickness that he doesn't have a way to
[50:55] heal you with
[50:57] amen as his servant i believe that more
[51:00] today
[51:02] than any time i believe it's just as
[51:04] good today
[51:05] as it was when brother branham was here
[51:08] it is but it's just up to the individual
[51:14] it's up to you it's up to me
[51:17] i've been healed hello folks i've had
[51:21] things in my side i wonder what in the
[51:23] world's going on
[51:25] hello for a long time
[51:30] sure what is it what is it that just
[51:35] he the lord is my healer he's my healer
[51:40] i ain't felt it in a long time and i
[51:42] trust i never will
[51:45] you don't know how many things god heals
[51:47] up and heals you with
[51:48] they say we all have cancer you know
[51:50] right
[51:52] and but sometimes it'll just work out
[51:53] extra and go up into something
[51:56] amen it's just like brother bam's wife
[51:59] remember
[52:00] she had that thing on her ovary but it
[52:02] wasn't until she did something with this
[52:05] it's pleasing to the lord the glory
[52:06] allowed that thing to grow
[52:08] huh it's all in the mercy and the grace
[52:11] of god
[52:12] all right let's go on so praise the lord
[52:17] amen there's no hunger
[52:23] that he hasn't got food to satisfy that
[52:26] hunger
[52:28] amen there's no thirst that he can't
[52:32] quench he has made it away how many
[52:35] believes it
[52:36] he has made a provision for everything
[52:39] that you have need of
[52:41] praise be to god hallelujah
[52:46] we don't always understand now the
[52:47] problem of god he makes a statement the
[52:48] bible clearly declares
[52:51] if you'll go with me let's go to the
[52:52] next thought here
[52:54] in first corinthians 10.
[53:02] first corinthians 10.
[53:09] it talked about how that israel that god
[53:12] wasn't very well pleased with them how
[53:13] that they were overthrown in the
[53:15] wilderness
[53:16] that's uh first corinthians 10 and
[53:18] around 5.
[53:20] god wasn't very pleased these were done
[53:23] for example sir that we wouldn't lust
[53:24] after evil things and so forth
[53:27] and then down in verse 10 neither murmur
[53:29] yet some of the murmured and were
[53:31] destroyed of destroyer
[53:35] amen now all these things happen unto
[53:38] them for example
[53:39] and they are written for our admonition
[53:41] upon whom the answer of the world to
[53:43] come
[53:44] just to go to show you how that god will
[53:45] take the same scripture and just give
[53:47] you a little something else through it
[53:49] we've talked about murmuring many times
[53:50] and this out of the other but did you
[53:52] realize that even in the murmuring
[53:54] even if they're complaining the snakes
[53:57] begin to buy them and they begin to die
[53:59] and they're right
[54:01] he sent them out there they were dying
[54:02] by the thousands and they called moses
[54:05] help us help us help us help us help us
[54:08] it's something about when a man yells
[54:10] for help
[54:11] god has an ear open isn't that right and
[54:14] what does god do he
[54:16] makes a way for him i mean
[54:19] even though they murmured he god made a
[54:22] way for them
[54:24] to be alive and they took a serpent and
[54:26] put it upon the pole
[54:28] and just said just look
[54:31] huh
[54:34] what if it had been me what if i had
[54:36] been amongst the group that murmured
[54:38] and complained the snake would have come
[54:41] and bit me
[54:42] i'm i'm dizzy i can't really get
[54:45] but i know that there's a there's a
[54:48] serpent on the paw just over the hill
[54:51] and if i just see that thing i'll be
[54:52] healed oh i'm i'm saying y'all
[54:55] can't barely see bump your head into a
[54:57] tree come back around
[54:58] and come on up and you know keep going
[55:00] and keep trying
[55:02] just come up over the hill and your eyes
[55:04] are almost too faint you look
[55:07] at that pole
[55:10] wow something sweeps over the pain is
[55:12] all gone
[55:13] and you're back to strength like you
[55:15] should be
[55:16] when you do anything to get to look on
[55:19] that pole
[55:23] jesus said if i be drifted up
[55:26] i will draw all men unto myself how many
[55:29] believe that you just look upon jesus
[55:31] and believe on him
[55:32] look and live look and live amen
[55:36] he was the type of that serpent that
[55:38] judged serpent
[55:40] on a pole that serpent that you bad
[55:42] nature that you and i
[55:43] should have been judged for there he was
[55:45] and took our judgment
[55:48] that's it was sin being judged and he
[55:51] was our judgment
[55:52] just look at that and you'll live
[55:56] praise the lord god made it way for him
[55:59] even though they were dying by the
[56:00] thousands
[56:01] he made a way
[56:05] you know god said one place separates
[56:07] yourself moses
[56:08] and i'll just destroy the whole bunch
[56:11] well if god chose to
[56:12] can you imagine he could choose not to
[56:14] make a way they'd all just drop dead
[56:16] except for moses
[56:20] but he's a mercy for god i'm thankful
[56:22] for a mercy for god
[56:23] we serve a god that cares
[56:27] he just simply cares don't ever think
[56:30] god don't care let me tell you this
[56:34] i believe that god cares more than your
[56:36] mom
[56:37] your dad your brother your sister your
[56:40] uncle
[56:41] your aunt your grandma your
[56:43] great-grandma god cares more
[56:45] than any of us
[56:48] he sure does amen
[56:52] i'm thankful for a god that cares now
[56:54] this is not where i was going
[56:56] verse 13 is where i want to go
[57:00] now notice there has no temptation
[57:04] taken you but such as is coming to man
[57:08] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[57:12] you to be tempted above that ye
[57:14] are able but will
[57:17] with the temptation also
[57:20] make a way amen
[57:24] praise the lord for the way of
[57:27] escape amen
[57:31] now
[57:35] that temptation is also used over in
[57:37] james let's go to james
[57:48] as a trial okay as a
[57:51] trial a temptation
[57:54] or a trial the bible says they were
[57:58] tempted
[57:59] in the wilderness is that right they
[58:00] were tested they were tried
[58:03] in the wilderness so whenever
[58:07] you come to a place of trial
[58:10] god always makes a way out
[58:14] james 1 and 12 says blessed is a man
[58:16] that endureth temptation
[58:19] for when he is tried
[58:23] he shall receive the crown of life which
[58:26] the lord has promised to them
[58:28] that love him
[58:31] how many knows that these temptations
[58:35] that come our way are more precious to
[58:38] us
[58:39] than gold
[58:46] more than your bank account more than
[58:48] you could have if he was a billionaire
[58:51] to be truly tested by almighty god
[58:54] it's worth more than any gold or you
[58:56] could silver you could have
[58:58] it's more precious
[59:02] all right my brethren counted all joy
[59:05] when you fall
[59:06] verse chapter one verse two when you
[59:09] fall
[59:10] into diverse temptations
[59:13] knowing this that the trying of your
[59:15] faith
[59:16] worketh patience
[59:24] amen a lot of some of you can sympathize
[59:27] with me on this
[59:29] i thought that when i had a flat tire or
[59:32] or back in the day my
[59:35] bank was overdrawn or uh
[59:39] something like that i really had a
[59:41] problem i had a trial
[59:43] or something happened that you know
[59:45] you'd have to suffer for a week or two
[59:47] perhaps
[59:48] your car breaks down and you don't know
[59:50] where you're gonna drive next
[59:53] but you know as you get older sometimes
[59:56] those trials
[59:58] they don't last for a week or two they
[1:00:01] maybe last for a year or two
[1:00:03] how i forget how long it was but the ram
[1:00:05] said that whenever he disobeyed in
[1:00:07] africa for years
[1:00:09] he had he was sick sick sick sick for
[1:00:12] years
[1:00:15] sometimes our trials and temptations are
[1:00:18] long
[1:00:20] and hard
[1:00:23] but just remember this the bible says
[1:00:25] that if you endure it
[1:00:27] huh if you can get through it and still
[1:00:30] be a christian love the lord more
[1:00:32] there's a crown waiting for you he's
[1:00:34] saying that's the kind of people god
[1:00:36] wants to live with
[1:00:37] that's going the kind of people that's
[1:00:38] going to be with god is the ones that
[1:00:41] can go through a long
[1:00:42] hard trial
[1:00:45] and james understood this well because
[1:00:48] he knew that one thing these trials
[1:00:50] these tests do is they give you patience
[1:00:55] because if you're not patient in a trial
[1:00:57] you're going to lose it quick
[1:01:00] huh you're not going to be able to
[1:01:02] endure
[1:01:06] and that's not the kind god wants to be
[1:01:08] with him but it teaches you patience
[1:01:11] that's why anymore i'm sure a lot of us
[1:01:13] along with myself
[1:01:14] that when anything comes up i'm patient
[1:01:18] in it
[1:01:19] just take it easy don't get all excited
[1:01:24] don't get all right up don't get all
[1:01:26] flustered
[1:01:27] huh i'm not going to do any good
[1:01:32] but i guarantee you one thing can i say
[1:01:34] something
[1:01:35] one thing i can do if you get all
[1:01:37] flustered
[1:01:38] it's not going to make it better it is
[1:01:40] going to make it worse
[1:01:46] all those of you with experience on that
[1:01:49] that's right you get flustered about it
[1:01:52] and you get round about it you only mess
[1:01:54] it up worse
[1:01:57] amen we've all got experience there
[1:02:02] so lord help us that's what james was
[1:02:04] saying here
[1:02:05] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:02:06] knowing this that it works
[1:02:08] patience and if you're a patient man
[1:02:10] through trials there's very little
[1:02:12] things that you can't go through
[1:02:14] if you're patient and something about
[1:02:17] james and patience but let patients have
[1:02:19] a
[1:02:20] perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:02:23] and entire wanting
[1:02:27] nothing how many knows that means like
[1:02:29] lacking nothing
[1:02:31] you'll have everything you need the
[1:02:34] bible talks another place about
[1:02:37] prophets and so forth being our examples
[1:02:39] who through patience
[1:02:43] obtained the promises amen
[1:02:47] like moses for 25 years like noah for
[1:02:50] 120 years
[1:02:52] through patience they obtained the
[1:02:53] promises
[1:02:55] praise the lord because guess what god
[1:02:58] don't want a two-week man in heaven
[1:03:00] well i'll tell you what i'm in heaven to
[1:03:03] two weeks now and you know i tell you
[1:03:05] what i i can't handle this anymore
[1:03:06] no he don't want someone like that
[1:03:10] no he wants somebody could be there a
[1:03:11] while
[1:03:13] somebody will endure the test of
[1:03:15] eternity
[1:03:18] you don't want no devil in there anymore
[1:03:19] he done had one of them
[1:03:21] that after a trillion years he decided
[1:03:24] you know i want to be like him
[1:03:25] i want to be a god i want people to
[1:03:27] worship me he got lifted up and pride
[1:03:30] was found in his heart
[1:03:31] and sin was firing in his heart isn't
[1:03:34] that right
[1:03:35] and he took two thirds of the angels or
[1:03:37] a third of the angels with him
[1:03:39] they got tired of heaven
[1:03:43] um got old to him
[1:03:47] church got old to him i don't know about
[1:03:50] you but
[1:03:51] i was looking forward tonight get
[1:03:53] together on a midweek this is the best
[1:03:55] part of the week
[1:03:56] getting together talk about something
[1:03:57] real
[1:03:59] something that isn't disappointing huh
[1:04:02] something that's got all the answers the
[1:04:06] lord jesus christ the holy ghost
[1:04:08] amen i won't keep you much longer let me
[1:04:10] just say this how many knows that
[1:04:12] brother bam said when you get the holy
[1:04:13] ghost how many knows jesus is the answer
[1:04:15] the holy ghost is the answer jesus is
[1:04:18] the answer
[1:04:19] he is the answer because why why is he
[1:04:22] the answer
[1:04:22] because he's got the prob solution to
[1:04:24] your problem he is the solution to the
[1:04:27] problem
[1:04:27] he can fix it he can take care of it rem
[1:04:29] says when you get the holy ghost
[1:04:31] he says you have now you you are then so
[1:04:35] to speak
[1:04:36] in possession of everything that you
[1:04:39] ever will have
[1:04:40] need of in this life's journey
[1:04:43] in other words the way is there the way
[1:04:46] is god will make sure that you taken
[1:04:49] care of for in this life's journey and
[1:04:51] in the world to come even in death how
[1:04:54] many knows he's already got your body
[1:04:55] prepared for you
[1:04:56] and when we go to crying over somebody
[1:04:59] here in the front of here
[1:05:00] and then oh man we're going to miss him
[1:05:02] at all we're just so depressed he said
[1:05:04] no we don't really realize it because we
[1:05:06] haven't seen it like brother branham had
[1:05:08] but that's the most glorious place they
[1:05:10] could ever be
[1:05:13] huh as a christian but that's just that
[1:05:16] beyond that last breath
[1:05:18] lies the world like you can't even
[1:05:20] imagine huh
[1:05:23] why because jesus don't stop taking care
[1:05:25] of his making ways
[1:05:27] just on this side no he makes the way
[1:05:33] we like control sister johnny's we like
[1:05:36] to have control of things
[1:05:37] that's one of the things that scares
[1:05:39] people to death about death
[1:05:41] all right you're no longer in control
[1:05:44] you're going to lay there
[1:05:45] and you're going to lose the ability
[1:05:48] like brother ivan did
[1:05:50] he lost the ability to move his hands
[1:05:51] and keep his hands in him or lose he
[1:05:53] lost the ability his
[1:05:54] body finally shut down finally shut down
[1:05:57] you come down there that death it just
[1:05:59] puts you in that corner
[1:06:00] isn't that right and then you're
[1:06:03] completely helpless
[1:06:06] you can't move your hand anymore can't
[1:06:08] move your arms anymore you can't speak
[1:06:10] anymore
[1:06:13] and you go on and you take that last
[1:06:15] breath
[1:06:17] and the spirit leaves comes out of the
[1:06:19] body
[1:06:20] how many knows you're in the hands of
[1:06:21] god but he makes a way
[1:06:24] he takes that soul and he puts it over
[1:06:27] into a perfectly young
[1:06:29] perfect body where he can't hug each
[1:06:31] other again and that soul
[1:06:33] goes into that other body because god
[1:06:35] makes a way
[1:06:37] i'm just glad that he does that he's the
[1:06:39] waymaker
[1:06:41] he gives that new body and our loved
[1:06:44] ones
[1:06:46] christians all christians they go over
[1:06:48] there and they're right there and they
[1:06:50] have another body
[1:06:51] they're not this body but they have
[1:06:53] another body that they can actually hug
[1:06:54] each other but a brand even brother
[1:06:56] brandon thought that ben and he taught
[1:06:58] it i seen i see the tape where he
[1:06:59] actually taught it
[1:07:01] that you know when you get over there
[1:07:02] you can't really pick cheek
[1:07:04] shake people's hands because you're a
[1:07:05] ghost or they're like a cloud or a vapor
[1:07:08] or whatever you
[1:07:09] just go right through it you know and be
[1:07:10] nothing there how are you going to give
[1:07:12] anybody hug
[1:07:12] it's just kind of a cloud it's kind of
[1:07:14] what he thought isn't that right
[1:07:16] until after division he says no
[1:07:19] it meets another hand when you grab
[1:07:22] somebody you hug them and that you
[1:07:23] actually
[1:07:24] have feeling in there right
[1:07:27] so i'm just glad for a waymaker that
[1:07:29] when you take that last breath
[1:07:32] that's what's so important to be a
[1:07:33] christian huh
[1:07:35] how many knows it's so important to be a
[1:07:36] christian because what
[1:07:38] if there's not a not a way made for you
[1:07:42] i could preach to you half an hour on
[1:07:45] where brother bram says what a horrible
[1:07:46] thing it is for a soul
[1:07:48] drifting on this sea of life with no
[1:07:51] pilot to guide him
[1:07:52] no waymaker no christ in here
[1:07:57] what a horrible life it is without the
[1:07:59] holy ghost
[1:08:01] he says the worst nightmare the worst
[1:08:03] thing that could ever happen for you
[1:08:04] would be to die out of this world
[1:08:06] without knowing god
[1:08:08] why there is no body there's no way for
[1:08:10] you there's no way made for you
[1:08:16] the unbelievers that refuse god's way
[1:08:18] they don't give them automatically a
[1:08:20] nice weight and that's what they're
[1:08:21] expecting
[1:08:22] i'm gonna have my way here and i'm going
[1:08:24] to have enough no no no you're in for a
[1:08:25] shock
[1:08:26] you're in for a surprise
[1:08:30] so then he says those people that had to
[1:08:32] have their own way
[1:08:34] do it your way you can have you can do
[1:08:35] it your way
[1:08:37] but when you come down to that death
[1:08:38] don't expect him to give you away
[1:08:40] we have a way we have a body we have a
[1:08:42] palace we have a place prepared for us
[1:08:45] am i right but they don't have a place
[1:08:48] and what is it
[1:08:49] what is it like it's just the same there
[1:08:52] as it is here
[1:08:53] it's a nightmare but the map says you go
[1:08:56] out there and that soul of yours
[1:08:58] right it's just floating it's just
[1:09:01] out there lost huh some of them
[1:09:06] try to go back into their body they want
[1:09:09] their body back because they want a body
[1:09:11] they need to be in the body
[1:09:14] but they can't come their their body
[1:09:15] their body's in the grave
[1:09:17] it's all gone they try to come back into
[1:09:20] this dimension
[1:09:22] and this you want to have just a little
[1:09:24] touch of spooky stuff
[1:09:26] yet tonight before you go to bed all
[1:09:28] right try not to get scared
[1:09:30] but abandoned tells the story of a car
[1:09:32] out in there is it arizona
[1:09:34] or somewhere out in the desert where a
[1:09:36] guy
[1:09:37] where a car hits the man with the
[1:09:38] overcoat
[1:09:40] and then right boom hits the man
