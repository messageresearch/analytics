TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign and the children can be dismissed for sunday school and if you'll go with me in the psalms we'll read psalms 120 and we're going to read 120 and 121. it's not that many verses psalms 120. psalms 120 in my distress i cried unto the lord and he hurt me what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue woe is me that i so drawn in messick that i will dwell in the tents of kidaro i am for peace but when i speak they are for war and if we'll just continue we're going to continue in 121 here too i i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my hell you will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forevermore god bless you may be seated brother brian morning brothers and sisters hope you've had a good week as we start another week for me so is you know that last two psalms we were reading there you know it's funny that we all seek peace and they seek war um last the week i lost my voice here i was telling them back there in the prayer room i opened something this morning and it totally took away my concentration um the offering last week was uh 5150 there are some people that have some gave me are going to give me some other stuff today but as we stand it's 51.50 so if we uh uh i've when i make that principal payment we'll probably be down to around 51 or 50 excuse me not 50. 61 or 62 thousand dollars if you return with me to romans the eighth chapter you know uh david is pretty prophetic prophetic in the things he said but some 4 000 years ago you know that's the thing about the word of god and the spirit of god what they were what they needed then and what we need now is the same thing the presence of the living god and our hearts and lives but i was going to read i'm in this a lot [Music] but i i was going to read this i hope i didn't lose my i hope i didn't lose my place here i get in such a hurry sometimes it's just that military nature about me um this is uh this was uh i was gonna read this thing this morning this is a lutheran preacher that had this devotional prior to world war ii and how how timely what he was thinking in this time how it is today in our time and i'll just read what he had to say it goes back to revelations the third chapter and the second verse and many of the securities which we thought were solid are crumbling in in these critical times so you have to think this man in his time was you know 1940 1941 so he's talking about the world then was crumbling before them with what was going on and around in the world and you bring it up to 2022 how how much worse is it now in our day and age and he goes on to say uh but there are eternal things that cannot go or will not go there are timeless everlasting sustaining values of god and we all have hearts and lives today that hasn't changed during the first century when the world was going to pieces and you know a lot of examples if you look at paul's time all the things you know the roman empire all the abuses that were given to the church in that day and age and brother bradham taught us that maybe it's we're not going to be like paul but the day's coming may be like paul's time but right now it's the battle in your mind this morning where you have to fight daily to keep all that negativity all that stuff it shouldn't be in your heart and mind you got to push it and keep it out and he goes on i lost my place uh during the first century when the world was going to pieces john wrote a message of cheer to the church of sardis strengthen those things which remain and what are these realities that will will not go first god's love you know that's in the message of the hour you know god loves us all he desires for you all to have a greater relationship this morning than you did yesterday morning i haven't persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus now that's in romans 8 you know it's one of those chapters those everlasting internal chapters that if any time you get a position in your life when you're really low in in your relationship that's one of those chapters that'll lift you up and it goes on he says here i don't want to keep rereading the same thing no matter what happens take refuge in the golden pledge that the love of god remains constant as a magnificent magnificent stabilizer for courageous living and then he and then this is the most important thing i thought for the time that we're in this morning and and i'll just this guy's a lutheran in 1940 so the second is the power of prayer someone asked about the this i don't know who this artist was this way artist what do you do when you lose your vision and that's the same for us this morning what do we do when we lose our vision when life is so hard then everything seems so dark and he goes on to say here i lost my place again he turned to his wife for the answer we kneeled down and prayed she replied the mightiest power in the world which can conquer anything is the power of prayer and that hasn't changed it's been that way for for the last 6 000 years no matter what position you're in this morning wherever you're at all you have to do is stop and pray and just believe that god's going to do something for you and then he goes on the third jesus christ he is the same yesterday today and forever and his truth remains that's the same for us today in the year 2022. you can't change that that's that's eternal and he goes on he's his truth remains his divinity remains his deathless message of salvation from california's cross remains no force on earth is powerful enough to overthrow him long after the sun has set in the skies forevermore his person his work everything for which he stands will remain and that you can't and this man that you know this is what almost 80 years ago but the truths the messenger of the hour all these great examples that we have doesn't change the fact that god is there for us every day of our life and he's more than able to minister into the needs that you need this morning and i was uh i'll jump here i hope i didn't lose my place but i took copied this and i was thinking this morning i'm going to read out of revelations the third chapter a couple of a couple of these scriptures here and i was thinking of what's going on in the world this morning and uh this is what the first couple of verses in the third chapter of revelation says and on to the angel of the church of sardo's right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works and thou has a name but thou livest in our dead so we stole my note thy works and he says thou livest and thou are dead and he goes on to tell him be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found my works perfect before god i know we're living in the last age but i'm thinking of what's going on in luther's time and and i have a thought about it i'll remember thought they received the herb hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come to thee as a thief and thou shall not know what hour i will come upon them and uh and then the last i'll read this fourth or earth thou has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me away for they are worthy and i took this out of the church age but i'm not going to read all of this this morning but i i wrote some notes the thing about the age you think of uh luther's time or wesley's time or paul's time that the thing that happens in any of these ages if you don't reach out in faith and receive the true baptism of the holy ghost your foundation isn't going to be right so that's how you wind up with the lutheran church you wind up with the churches after wesley or the churches you know all those different wind up with all those different organizations because they didn't move with god as god was moving and it's no different for us this morning you've got to move as god leads you in your life your family's life or church life whatever is if you don't move as god's revealing then you're going to be just you're going to be no different than these organizations and being a message believer doesn't make these rules not apply to you they rep apply to you just as much or to me as anyone else and i'll just read some of the things and i was just thinking i i wrote this thing bad things are formed in people's lives churches governments without it so if you don't move you know there's three works of grace if you don't move through the first two works and get sealed in by the baptism of the holy ghost then that's what happens to any government any church any individual the end your your foundation is wrong so everything that you are is wrong and he goes on and you have to move past the first two works and go into the final work of grace doesn't mean that you don't learn and you don't apply yourself every day in that walk but i'll just read i don't want to take a lot of time this morning i'll get started and i won't stop but this is what brother branham had saying it these are just a couple of bulletin bullets he had in this book and it's on page of 253 and he says i know thy works what are what are these works that came up before the lord and caused this displeasure well you know that each our age lap over into the next stage so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth and those were so and we're at the end now so all those things are just brought and are just heaping on top of themselves and then the leadership of the holy ghost was suspended by human hierarchy and that's what i'm talking about this morning if you don't move into the last stage that last step where you get sealed in by the baptism of the holy ghost you're going to be no different than any of these other examples that are here this morning and he goes the second bullet is on the pages the pure word of god and its free benefits to all men was disposed for that's what i was saying earlier for creeds dogma church order exec you can't break these fundamentals and the third one the worship of in the spirit and the gifts of the spirit and all that was pertains to the true community of fellowship of the saints was cast aside for the liturgy and literal light of worship pagan feasts you know it's racist attack but boy i can understand this a little bit and then the worship of mary i'm not going to read that the whole paragraph there my point being this morning as individuals this morning we all have to move past and i'll let me go to romans the eighth chapter that's where that that thing came from i thought i marked it this morning but i made an effort when i was a younger man some of the stuff i could i could save from memory i i don't try to say it for memory now anymore because i probably misplace it i think i don't have the right spot again i'll i'll just read these verses and sit down if you return me the romans the eighth chapter about the 33rd verse and you know it speaks for itself i you know i'm quick to say something like that whatever i say doesn't mean anything unless you can't bring it through the word of god and the message of the hour you know i'm not afraid to say that i will tell any man that and he goes on to say the 34th verse who is thee that condemneth of christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is ever at the right hand of god who make his intercessor for us so that's a comforting thought there that literally christ is sitting there for you today to do that for you as long as you are willing to put it on him you know a lot of times i i can only speak for myself i like to carry a lot of things you know i i don't think i'm worthy of this or that i i'm one of those people that likes to carry a lot of things sometimes you just got to let that burden go and he goes who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tributation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword as it is written for thy sakes we were killed all the day long you know we are counted as sheep slaughter so when you read something like that you realize in context you got to be close to jesus christ this morning and it goes nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power no things present nor things to come nor heights or depths or any other creatures shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and that's a comforting thought this morning so no matter what those circumstances are in your life this morning you know god knows him he knows what you need this morning he knows exactly what you need and all you have to do is reach out of faith and claim whatever god has for you this morning brother david it's good to see each and every one out this morning and man it's good to be in the house of the lord isn't it amen amen i sing that little course this morning oh say but i'm glad i'm glad jesus has come and my cup's overrun oh say but i'm glad this morning i know say but i'm glad

well what happens if something bad happens we're still in his hands this morning amen and you know when we were little kids we used to sing that song he's got the whole world in his hands he's got you and me brother and i still believe more and more that he's got me in his hands this morning and i i'm thankful for that this morning and amen we just love the lord and we missed last week we wasn't feeling good and i'll tell you i just i thought wow i thought i felt better and brother steve and brother thomas told me said you just need to stay home we don't need to see you give you give everybody what you got and i wouldn't give it to nobody not even joe biden what i had but anyways but i'm just thankful the lord's a healer this morning brother daniel and amen brother glenn brother coming this morning we have some prayer requests this morning we want to remember uh brother sean and sister patty and sean jr they're gone on vacation he said they'd be back thursday remember then and also uh uh brother parish and sister paris staring out here this morning you want to remember them in prayer this morning and uh also sister angie and sister peggy are other shut-ins this morning that god will be with them and also we've been having prayer for quite some time and i brought it to the church's attention mr carol jackson and the cancer had come back and she's completed four weeks of her radiation she has another week left and and there was another sister in their church there was five people in their church that had cancer and the lord healed them all and you say well if he healed him why did it come back on sister carol all i know is the enemy is scratching at the door again but she's claiming her healing and there was a sister in our church her name was sister patty and we've had prayer for her and and the lord healed her her of cancer and uh but she's always had to be on dialysis and you know how your mind works well lord if you could heal cancer why couldn't he heal the dialysis the problem and uh that's the way i feel sometimes i'm not questioning god you know how it is you because god's an awesome god he can do anything and and i was talking to brother truman asking him how sister carol's thing was going he said oh by the way brother david he said i just want to tell you a month ago he had told me when sister carol had come up with this that she was gonna have to go back for treatment he told me sister pat going through it and having a pretty rough time and she wasn't doing too good just to show you he said he told me the other day he said i just want to tell you he said sister patty's doing so well they put her up for a kidney transplant said she's doing really well god's an awesome god that's all i can say this morning you know we don't think like god does but i'm so glad that he cares for us this morning amen and you know brother job never done nothing wrong but god had to prove a point to the devil that job was a true and upright christian it didn't matter what came his way he was going to be happy in the lord anyway amen brother daniel would you pray with offering these needs this morning amen the old gospel ship i have good news to bring well i have good news to bring and that is why i sing all my joy with you [Applause] i'm going to take a trip in the good old gospel ship and go sailing through the air [Music] well i'm

have them brother russell and sister elizabeth and then here this morning amen we're gonna ask for the russell if he'd come and sing this morning and you man good morning saints i really hesitate to try and introduce a new song this assembly seems like you guys know every song in the book but i asked serenity and austin both this morning if you sing this and they didn't think so but they're probably wrong but we're gonna if it's hopefully it's a new song for you it's a song we were enjoying at home a lot jesus your name is power i love the little line that says your name will break every

is holy jesus your name brings a light jesus your name above every other jesus your name amen thank you no how many ever heard that before all right good god bless you this morning that's a good song amen now if i can learn how to sing it would be all right you know i was thinking i messed up that last song we sang and i kind of like brother brian i thought i remembered the words how it went and i was going down the wrong road so amen we're gonna have sister uh michelle and sister grace and the ones that's gonna sing this morning if they'll come let's see what next week oh well they told me this morning brother steve likes to do that to me so oh well amen that's all right he said you'll have to cut your part short since we're going to have them sing i guess he just didn't want me to sing anymore if you just told me brother steve we've been good amen god bless you let's stand this morning and amen love the lord with all your heart this morning amen and i just you know i i just don't know what to say but ain't god good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are but you know what he still loves us even when we mess up and he cares for us you know i i've reached the grand age of 60. never thought i would make it that far but i thought how many times has god spared my life and i look back and i look back and then i really looked back when i was about from 18 16 to 18 i thought wow how many times because of my ways did he take care of me and i'm thankful this morning god is good i sing that little course ain't god good to give us so many blessings as we welcome brother thomas this morning amen well i ain't got you [Music] to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are [Music] little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow once again well he's given so many blessings and deserving that's what we are we ought to thank you oh love and praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow [Music] that's what we are [Music] tomorrow amen because yesterday we're this is yesterday's tomorrow and so praise the lord god is good brother wallace god bless you good to see y'all amen i guess your parents your dad is here right there they are okay god bless you it's good to meet y'all praise the lord welcome amen i'm sure you've been in kentucky before amen but god bless you it's good to have y'all here very first time hopefully not the last amen so praise the lord amen would you like to give a word no okay all right god bless you all right praise the lord you can be seated this morning thank you musicians amen god is good isn't he amen i sure appreciate the lord i want to go over this with you with my paper this morning amen recently we had a person come up to uh it's actually a mennonite but he asked if we would sell that field back over here uh it's basically the fence line you were seeing my fence maybe a little bit left of that and then go across the back of the woods maybe all the way across to the other side of the creek all the way up our property line pretty much goes up behind those houses over there but he asked if we would sell it and i took it up with the trustees and the board and they all voted to basically bring it before the church for a vote amen i believe something like that ought to be done by the majority of the congregation at least i felt like it should amen and so anyway i'm going to show you just a little bit if i this this probably won't help you a lot but i'm going to want to show it to you anyway but that's why i described it just a little bit um kind of i guess you know because you know the land better than what you probably know this but i'll hold it up here would you help me you too let me see how we are here and you have to have i hope you're going to have to have glasses to see this one come on brother daniel hold this side for me all right so let me see where we're at here's our driveway right here um and then here's the church i think that's the old church the fellowship hall because our church would be up here but this is our volleyball uh net back here and so forth and goes all the way back to the woods right through there and then here's a pin down at the corner of that which down there okay and then what we would do is take from that pin probably come out to our septic system and then we go from our septic system straight across here so we have all of our woods and this field on the side and the graveyard we still have all of that over there it's just this back here and i know this is real rocky i mean you have to watch where you go or it'll tear the wheels off your tractor i've motored several times i'm not too impressed with it so i'm not going to miss it any if if you don't and so uh anyway that's what we're thinking about doing we have two buyers and men that are very interested so um we we don't know we'll talk to the board again and just decide on what price that we ask for but we're probably looking at around 50 55 000 somewhere in there it'll bring it within you know a year maybe maybe 12 000 if it was 50 it would be 12 000 if we get 55 it's only 7 000 we would owe salon church so we could get this knocked off amen so that's kind of direction i said well maybe this is an opportunity we know that in real estate right now it's at the peak and so we don't know what the future holds but if we could get out of debt i think it'd be nice but you decide we don't have to do it amen so you think we should keep on hang on to it we will but that's the idea okay all right so god bless you let me fill that up for me with you well i'm gonna have brothers david and brother steve come up and we'll just take a hand vote for this if that would be okay amen so if they would come up at this time amen and we'll have everybody close their eyes and so forth i'm just going to go back here for just a second and so forth but anyway we'll take to let them count the vote [Music] all right everybody that's in favor raise your hand this morning okay anyone not in favor and raise your hand okay you can lower your hands god bless you for the thomas all right thank you so we'll go ahead and see what we can do it looks like it is a go amen so we'll do get the most that we can out of with the help of the lord and and so forth um praise the lord god bless you and thank you god god bless you richly for that offering last weekend amen over five thousand dollars so that really knocked it down amen a lot on the principle and so that'll help us get us closer to the mark amen how many likes to pay off bills i don't know about you but i like to pay off bills i mean it's it's it's wonderful amen maybe we'll have a special meetings or something afterwards to celebrate once we get this place sold amen maybe we can get one of those those uh big name preachers in here some no i'm just i mean i've got a hard time getting them here i'll tell you what i've asked people many different times to come but amen they're very very busy so anyway praise the lord well i have something on my heart this morning that's really kind of a sincere urgent kind of a message amen and i know that uh i just you know it's kind of more of a solemn solemn uh and but branham talked about it called it it's almost scary i amen it's the word that he used amen and so um and we want to preach on and speak on modern events made clear by prophecy amen if we want to look at our modern events that are made clear by prophecy amen and so if you will stand with me we'll go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father we come before you this morning lord jesus knowing father that that which i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak on this morning is very serious and no doubt it'll cause us all to search your hearts father to see where we're at with you lord jesus and we think of the words that you spoke and how that you said watch watch many times you said watch look for you know not the day or the hour that your lord does come but if the goodman of the house would have watched he would have not suffered his house to be broken up and lord as we look this morning and as we're watching and waiting for you coming we ask god this morning you would just take the thoughts and meditation of our heart take your word lord jesus and and make it plain to the people and help us to be closer and get closer to you lord this morning than what we were when we come in those doors father forgive us of all sins all failures and trespasses god in jesus christ's name we ask these blessings and favors amen and amen all right so this morning we want to do and i'll be honest with y'all i you know i've got quite a bit of reading that i'd like to do and the reason that i like to do a little bit of reading is because you know we could take billy graham's uh word or robert's word great men we could take the words of great men but there's no greater that you can take that when jesus comes down after he says something and a man that'll say look if i've told you truth and jesus don't come you ain't got to believe me isn't that right he would say it in that manner that if jesus don't come and prove and vindicate that what i've said the truth you really you know it's just my word but if he comes and backs it up well you better believe it is that right so that's what we that's why i have so much confidence in the prophet of god and what he said amen and today with the help of the lord if you'll pray for me we're going to look at some things that's going on and it's going to be very political amen very political and if you don't think brother branham got political listen to jezebel religion amen boy he got really political amen and i realize and i know there's certain laws that if you promote a certain person or whatever amen they threaten to take your what is it called uh exemption or whatever away you know and and so forth and and i know one place brother bam says he knows he makes the statement you got a right to say that he says oh yes i do it's the word of god but taking the things and we're not promoting a man or this out of the other but one thing we are doing is promoting the word of god and taking the things that are out there that's happening amen and putting it with the word of god and seeing where we're at aren't you glad you we want to do that this morning with the help of the lord to see where we're at and and i hope you got a comfortable seat so we might go a little lengthy would that be okay amen i don't think that hurts oh my i'm gonna save something i heard brother i'm saying he was talking about uh uh uh what was his name now again anyway it was the pastor there at the church i should remember but anyway he was talking about how short of sermon he preached and he says man he only preached so long he says and then he quit he was just starting to get into it and he said that's a shame i was like wow he just rebuked the pastor for having short and says you know you know but that's the way brother man was he believed in putting plenty of plenty of it into it amen plenty of time so praise god let's turn our bibles if you will amen and i had a hard time really knowing just which scripture to go to because there's so many but this is kind of why i feel led to go and let's go to matthew 24 and so i don't know you know just pray for me in the next few services to see which way the lord wants me to go to continue this and go so far or what but i really wanted i wanted kind of to speak this on wednesday but i knew it would be long so i had another message laid on my heart and so i said i'll just take that one and we'll speak that wednesday amen and then do this this morning so we've been looking forward to this all right matthew 24. 30 let's go with 38 actually 37 let's go to 37 but as the days of noah were so also shall also the coming of the son of man be for in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken in the other left two women shall be grinding at the meal the one shall be taken and the other one left watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord does come but know this that if the goodman of the house would have known what watched the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour to think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and a wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his howl soul to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord fight when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make his him ruler over all his house and then of course we know if the evil servant says you know my lord delays he's coming amen and i'm going to tell you right now as a pastor i believe that that's what we have to watch people just think that it's going to keep going on amen amen and then and they kind of plan can keep you going on the believer is not planning on this thing going on he is planning to have this thing come down to close god bless you amen may god bless the reading of the word amen you can be seated praise be to god amen now remember brun place brother bab talked about it he made when he was speaking about the third poll okay he says now he was talking about the third pool and so forth he says i must lay and i'm not going to read that first part i'm going to read that later maybe but it says i must lay quiet now for just a little while remember who you who's listening to this tape amen you might see such a change in my ministry i believe it is 63. he says right away dropping back not going up but dropping back we're right at the age now it can't go any further and we have to wait here just a minute until this happens over here to catch up amen so you're talking to me that was a prophecy going forth that the word has went forth now but guess what we have to wait here and some things are going to have to catch up and i believe you and i believe this morning that we're at that catching up time i believe it has caught up and it's happening right there in front of us i don't want you to miss it i want you to but with the help of the lord to realize where we're at you know in this hour that we're living in each and every one of us knows what it's like to go to a certain place or travel to a certain place and it's pretty glorious because all you got to ask a person is can you give me the address is that right give me the address i can take it from there amen because you can program it into a gps and that gps huh isn't it nice it'll actually tell you 500 yards 300 yards and then it'll say turn it says take a right now this is where you do it you know i thought you know that soul in the natural i believe that in the spiritual realm god has given us the scripture i believe if he told us to watch the signs of the time if he gives us certain signs and certain things to watch i believe that if we catch that what if we miss it now how many knows the whole world missed the sign behold i'll send you a lie to the prophet before great and gratefully i i'm sure i'm not sure who it was either but brian or brother david mentioned how the the world has no clue they're really out there and they don't know where they're at or what what's going on other than it's getting more wicked but you know what's going on you know why it's going on i mean we all know why it is like it is the condition that we're in amen and so we've been given the scriptures we've been given the quotes i believe if we're prayerful that god will reveal it to us in the message of the hour where we are so that you can be ready [Music] amen and you know one of the things that uh one of the things and that really was a milestone to brother branham it was a real milestone and it was when kennedy when they elect kennedy in as president he had a lot to say about that amen he had a lot to say about it and um [Music] politically talking to black people talking about whether you're republican or a democrat and so forth and he realized that something was happening something had happened all right i'm going to change classes a little bit bear with me brother bam says now he says there was a time when america wouldn't have they'd known better than to have let that old prostitute that old harlot that's drunk with the blood of the martyrs huh now we're talking about we know that americans and so forth our forefathers we fled to america for what for freedom of religion to get away from the persecution of the church that killed 68 million basically away from catholicism amen to get away from catholicism and here brother ben says that old harlot the drunk with the blood of the martyrs killed them and the reason that they fled here for freedom they wouldn't have put up with nothing like that what was his name al shrapton or something like that ran for president just a little before that and they were still awake he said they no way they were going to have that they wouldn't vote that but now a little bit later brother ma'am talked about even letting the women vote and so forth for f kennedy you know when he was a ladies man he was all this side of the other hello he was smarter and everything else in the debate and so forth and he says and now he said you know i like like i said and the reason they fled here freedom they wouldn't have put up with nothing like that it shows that we're in a backslidden condition [Applause] amen the nation got backslid oh my i'm not going to go through the whole long spiel this morning uh of how that america paralleled israel is that right how that god gave them great kings and they inhabited the land and took over so forth you know uh and just like we did with the indians and everything a whole great man induces until he finally got away from god and now we pick it up where he got away from god where america got away from god and they got into a backslidden condition and he said even the pentecostals and so forth because even though brother bannon didn't vote he says he knew that all of these religious people that they do vote isn't that right and so forth nothing wrong with vote and so forth but listen he he says you know that they actually got in a backslidden condition a whole he says a whole nation to elect such as that of course and now he says you know some of you square back democrats will think this oh well he'll make a good politician head that might sound good but he says that's not according to the word of god and another place he talked about the different politicians you know how that they are sponsored by whiskey making and cigarettes and promising tax cuts this out of the other when they do get in they go ahead and cut taxes on what they promised and who supported them isn't that how politics works amen and that's what took them in there praise god oh my hallelujah oh my [Applause] think about that and another one he says now you see why my voice is going to be stopped pretty soon he thought perhaps somebody was going to shoot him for what he said but somebody's got to know it yes why revelations 2 20 she called herself a prophetess isn't that right i'm going to turn to that for a minute revelations 3 and i'm going to read that in verse 20. notwithstanding i have a few things against you because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication now notice he was talking to the second church age and to eat things sacrificed to idols and i gave her space to repent of her fornication she she repented not that happened i believe when uh you know all of those great prophets came to them in the church of rome and tried to get him to turn around but they wouldn't turn around they would not repent catholic church would not repent and i says behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repented their deeds didn't better ban talk about in this generation her children were given a chance to repent baptist methodist all of them they were all given a chance to repent many chances to repent but did they repent no they did not repent or they'd be sitting here this morning believe in god's works and what he did and now because they did not repent i will accept the repentance and i will kill her children remember it's not just about jezebel oh my you see why it parallels so much with america hello because it was that same jezebel system israel was all right until ahab married jezebel and how many knows that ahab was not really the figurehead he was not the really one the one that was in control it was that woman behind her jezebel look what we got in office today you see biden did this fight i don't do nothing except what he's told he can't read and talk unless he's so what dude he's got to be told when to shut up come on folks that's right and look at how much look at how much it is so there's somebody behind that driving it whoo now we'll give unto all mice that's right no no killer children with death and that all the churches may know that i am he which searches the reigns and the hearts and i will give to every man according to his works my so i will kill her children with death isn't that something he's going to cast her into and those that commit adultery into great [Applause] tribulation i mean those that promise the great tribulation period they're going to go into the great tribulation fear amen we have to ask ourselves lord jesus you know and i want to tell you something i truly believe that only those who have something in their heart the elect that are going to care about their walk with god everybody else gets lukewarm what do you got in here are you a sermon or god are you a seed of god if you are i believe it's time to be on your toes you need to be awake not sleeping not spiritually sleeping you need to be ready you need to be all perked up and ready to go that's what we got to be because we're right at the doors amen praise be to god all right let me go down this road a little bit in the first event jesus the whole world was corrupted with politics and religions and so forth and they wanted an anointed one so forth today russia wants a messiah isn't it something i everybody wants to be the greatest everyone wants to think they're the greatest it's that or the other they're one of the messiah and so forth what did what did america what do you want america you're crying the lioness what do you want isn't that what we're all doing especially the left and the right oh we want this and we want that and we want an educated genius and you've been wanting a political genius and now you got it though you had to invent a crooked voting machine to get it huh way back then think about it how did that go crooked vote so what did brother brown say he said you know crooked voting machine oh my look at what we got today oh just as crooked as you can be right now notice even the churches want a genius we won't get too much into that but everybody's trying to have the biggest name preacher in this that or the other sorry crept into the message you know everybody trying to be the greatest or just that or the other you sorry thing you if you'd realize a prophet of god has said you need to see how small you can get not how big you can get the further bigger you want to try to be the further away you get from god see how small you can be how humble you can be amen oh my but they all want a savior somebody to save him and so forth amen but you know what what you need is the savior that's just exactly what you need and god knows what you have needed is a savior and he send it to you and they don't want it we had a genius we had a superman it's christ through the body of christ through the prophet of god it's not brother man it's christ in him a genius that could tell you what to do when not to do it he can tell you your name where you from and everything else super super power nothing would stop whether storms needed to be stopped where bulls needed to be stopped or storms need to be stopped he could just speak the word and it was beyond there's something super yeah but they don't want that because they got to change their wicked ways they rejected what they were really thirsting for russia they reject what they're really thirsty all of the world rejecting what they're really thirsting for what they really need should i say they're thirsting because god put that thirst in there but they're just satisfied with the wrong thing don't they so where have we come to let's look at some of the prophecies here first of all amen look at here let me show you politics is at the end how many believes that he just said oh my let me show me today the nation this nation is the worst in the world for corruption and ungodliness oh my at that time we would have a national i guess i don't know of a universal what did he would call it would they get the women together and strip them down and their bathing suits is huge miss universe i guess you would call them right amen and russia don't strip them down he says everybody call everybody everybody was in it except russia and this dolphins ask him why not he says russia don't strip their women down before men a heathen ungodly nation bringing reproach upon we who call ourselves christian russia don't strip their women down out there like that and you've never seen shorts and stuff like that in russia unfortunately that's different today in there right but at that time they were more holy than what we were we were claiming to be a christian nation ma praise the lord politics corrupt the democrats republicans and all is low down you can't get a president but what conducts homosexuality he won't become president if you don't condone i mean he got to make everybody happy what is it it's a bunch of grass brother brandon was pretty frustrated here because he was talking it was during the time that they were trying to put him in jail because he would take tithe money put it in the church fund and so forth and run it through you know and they were trying to get him for it oh my can he talk about it listen so he says not politics corrupt the democrats both of them every person that works in it talking about the government that's not born again is of the devil you all know what our government is and uh whether it's the flu shot and so forth and if you're a nurse and you better take it or you lose your job huh and they're right anytime any kind of pressure they can put on you you talk about hypocritical we got such hypocrisy you know that we don't want to take a shot i don't want to i don't want to let you poke my arm and put some and i was just talking to somebody yesterday to talk to ambulance drivers and so forth and they would give people shots that had an ambulance and within two hours they'd be dead many nurses and people they're not going to tell you all the times that people drop dead from that stuff huh but when it comes to killing and murdering a bunch of little babies in the womb hello my body my choice leave me alone hands off of my body oh bunch cries out but when you stick your hands off my body too huh then they want to force you to it a bunch of hypocritical devils that's what it is is of the devil the devil said every kingdom in the world belongs to me jesus never did debate with him that's right the world is controlled by the devil and every man that works for the government again he says if he ain't a christian he's up the devil and working for the devil that's right every government you are of the devil led by the devil and go into the great tribulation period ready for the wrath of god and you're going to be destroyed with fire and most of them going to be burnt by russia most of them by russia amen i'll show you oh my now notice working for these these nations will all fall to jesus christ when he comes and there'll be a millennium praise be to god looking here today what they're going on hollering to me at me about spending money out there for christians and wanting to give me 20 years in prison for spending money to operate a religious group and whiskey and beer and cigarettes write off tens of millions of dollars to corrupt the nation they don't go after them they gave him money huh oh my and me preached righteousness standing at the door of jesus christ and sent me the one that sent me to penetration for and take stuff like that of the devil low down smart intelligence let them write it off on telepro television programs which corrupted the world send women to the dogs one of the greatest cursing nations ever had and they get by with it but send me to the penitentiary for preaching gospel and take a few dollars out of out to preach the gospel that people give me to preach the gospel with i'm not rich i can't write that out but yet they want to send me the country hold me two years got a trial coming up soon low down filthy god being merciful to him politics again he says low down nation corrupt that look what they're going to put soldiers in shorts now my politics war politics is at the end dictators is wrong politics is wrong political politics is wrong oh my he says why didn't they stay with a godly king like god gave david amen a godly king the great lord of england said why this democracy was formed said it's all right now but it'll come a time he said it'll be nothing it'll be all sales and no anger how many remembers when brother bam talked about how that that woman behind the head of ahab and america and so forth he says you watch them change the constitution change the laws well they come right out and say let's get rid of this carter constitution that part of constitution they change the laws to fit to make it fit what they want huh how many remembers they took it to where you don't have to get judged you don't have to have a 60 60 votes for a supreme court justice they decided and it was under harry reid he decided you know we're going to change this the filibuster i guess on that part and and vote and so forth and guess what you realize this money was mostly harry reid's harry reid's it was democrats fault that we got so many good conservative judges in because they changed the rules and then when come trump's time all these openings came up and we only needed the one majority because they did it thank god for a little bit of light huh just a little bit amen all right now i noticed i say a little bit but it's totally gone i mean it comes ain't gonna make no difference uh let me go on sorry all right so he says all sales and no anchor politicians stand on soap boxes on every corner with all kinds of crooked things that the uh that the corrupt government man was right that's exactly what's going on one man can go down through here you know and get drunk and tear up everything he wants to go down there and nobody is you know there's nothing said but you let a man go down there and try it you let a poor man go down there and try and they'll send him the dependent trinity he's talking about a two-tier two-tier justice system why you can they can murder people and if you've got enough money and who you are you ain't going to jail is that right oh my i think you know and i want to say this at this milestone we've had just had another milestone and and you all know what happened with the fbi raiding trump's residence down in florida to me that was a milestone something that had never been done in the history of our nation for the present government to go after a a adversary the top number one politician that's going to come after him and here they go and do something unprecedented something never been done to me that's a milestone because see folks how many knows that i think they need a straw poll in their convention and all that and they figured out who would perhaps take the next nomination i think desantis was at 20 something 30 maybe and trump was way up there on the 70s he was way up there so in that figure of speech he the number one leader for conservative movement christians and so forth he's the number one leader you know right and we see what happened we'll get into that a little bit deeper here in a minute all right now so he says now all right that's right a two-tier and then he says corruption low down fail amen forty percent of them homosexual think of it sodom and gomorrah again oh my it's supposed to be i wonder what takes place next aren't that what were you and i are doing we're at the place where we're wondering what's going to take place next when the next president comes in god give us a good godly man that's what we could say the best man that we could ask for as good as he can have we just had there was a reprieve for how many knows that a lot of times the judgments of god even in the old testament they would be held off for a few years but the judgments still come probably what we're experiencing a little bit of repeat but guess what it's still coming it's going to happen oh my give us a godly man old dwight ellison and watch the next thing that comes in we might have a rat then the next time sure enough woo be careful now respect to god you know think about it you realize i looked i i i asked siri i said how many catholic presidents have we had she said we have had kennedy and the last and and one more that's bite kennedy and vine that's all it said if that's accurate it's only our second one and he fits perfect what brother bannon described for kennedy as not being really the head but somebody behind it pushing it huh and even by the even but the brahms says now kennedy may not do it and bring a lot of these things in but there's one to come one that don't know joseph and what does that mean there's going to come a president don't know and don't have one respect for the constitution of the united states don't know what our forefathers fought for listen to jesse bell religion if you really want to hear it straight from so to speak the horse's mouth but he talked about it we have forgotten what we come for americans have absolutely forgotten what they came for and actually elected and made us a catholic country we're a catholic country according to prophet god amen all right i deleted that one because i had it on here all right let's stop and and come back here again i'm not going to be in a hurry is that okay we might have a rat next time sure enough but there's coming a pharaoh who doesn't know joseph remember that boy if we're not seeing that now we we are seeing it now people people that hate the constitution worse whenever trump was in everybody was we're having a constitutional crisis but it doesn't matter what unconstitutional things they do huh they don't crawl that cried out now no so what did say say next he says war is at its end i mean those can't even have a war anymore education let's go to education education is at its end how many believes that we're at the end juvenile delinquency oh my children there ain't no hopes for children they were probably pretty good back then in the 60s huh compared to today look at what they do today they're done gone insane you can't have no education you can't go down here at the school we have get a kid with an education you'll be twofold more hell when he comes out than he was when he went in amen let the teacher say something about it oh man he'll get killed he never even put in here they're going to kill they're going to have mass they're going to kill they're trying to go in there and kill as many as they can huh oh my the devil's got them he talks about uh education give the kids an education and so forth give them money for an education the devil's got them college the devil's got him brother brandeis how many knows that's exactly right i'm going to say it the teachers into colleges the devil's got them i'm going to say something you know i we heard very little about racism or anything like that during reagan and different ones you know right up to the obama administration the racism started in the obama administration whenever there would be a killing of a black person and so forth and then he would go and he would investigate the police and want to take their everything else uh and stood up for the murderers and everything else and look what we're at today okay now you can't hardly pass a day but a car rammed through a jewelry store and went and just ravaged it and took everything they can look at our uh what does it say i i don't have to quote but brother brown says you know this is the age of lawlessness he says this is going to be a lawless age look at where we're at look how that scripture is being fulfilled how they're not prosecuting and letting them write out no cash bill anymore just let them right back out on the street folks how many notes if you can't see the antichrist and the devil trying to tear this country to pieces through those that condone such you're blind as a fat because that's exactly what it is satan hates the freedom that you have he hates what america stood for he hates even her background and they want to destroy it completely the devil does but the thing of it is it's all going to go into the mark of the beast huh and we want to talk with the help of the lord about coming down to that squeeze that pressure amen and we're very close to it very coming very coming closer to it all the time all right child bearings that are in womanhood's out of hand mamas don't want to stay home and raise their children anymore don't make a lick of sense to me amen but listen birth control pact is everywhere and little dog says take its place i was reading yesterday somewhere on the same thing he was somewhere this american woman come in there with her poodle dog and put it on the table in the restaurant dirty filthy dog that's where he says that the tithe of the dog doesn't even come into the house of god and she'll go out practice birth control so she can go to parties and this that or the other and spend a thousand dollars for the doll praise god for us that are dogmas and we're glad people spend thousands dog business is good or it used to be anyway is that right well everybody was home and my gracious i'm gonna go ahead and just say we sold a dog on registered or nothing just a little old mud of a dog for three grand three thousand dollars they come from texas to get it somebody wanted a dog anyway i didn't but somebody did amen oh my but isn't it the truth people don't want no children you know i just we just sold a dog i think it is over in louisburg to a young couple a black man and a white woman of course that's what they promote right young they would have a dog and have a baby and raise it to look they don't even know what the lord is they didn't have parents to bring him to church folks you parents bring your children to church show your children godliness and so forth man i'm telling you what the devil's about he's a roaring lion how many knows the marriage and divorce is on a rampage that was one of the signs at the end marrying and giving in marriage one of the biggest tricks the devil will do is get a man or a woman to think that some other man or a woman would make him happier than what they got that is a lie of the devil because as soon as you break your vows as soon as you got you remember this you would be miserable for the rest of your days i don't care how pretty she is or how pretty he is you will be miserable because you'll be wrong in your heart amen your your wife is the best woman that you'll ever have if you're married to her now amen your husband is the best man that you will ever have get that in your mind because if you don't the devil will try to tear you apart amen womanhood morals there's no morals to it anymore amen women dressing evil and televisions all kinds of impersonations of evil people of hollywood all kinds of stuff pageants all at the end education at the end politics at the end wars at the end civilization's at the end oh all those things are at the end man what can we do next then what's next we're at the end of all things church life is at the end the formal churches at the end oh maybe stick just a little bit but the carnal esau church amen she come to her and how many of those are just all bunch of dead lodges out there anymore they don't preach the truth they're out there they can't go any further women in there dress like prostitutes she is a prostitute you realize the prophet oh my that's why i believe the father to god he says you know in her was all kinds of blasphemous names brother man says blackness methodist and presbyterian blasphemous names [Music] largest now notice gonna be a little strong hope everybody can swallow this can i say something some people don't like what the preacher says somebody don't like maybe maybe you don't like what i say well guess what i'd love for you to come up here and preach and say as much as i do and find out whether everybody likes what you said that all right so just hang on to your seats maybe not everything is quite do i know the way you think it ought to be or in the way that it ought to be but i'm doing the best that i can with the help of the lord you'll have to overlook me if i just you know mess up a little bit once in a while is that all right i'm here to tell you if you can't be faithful to the lord in the good times what about when the bad times come you're gonna these two pews would be empty and a heartbeat well i ain't gonna go down there they're fixing to throw rocks at us or or those burning things they're gonna slide us on fire well we need to be lit on fire a little bit of the holy ghost we won't care so much about the natural fire man the devil can take you out of church at every little bitty thing you ain't seen nothing yet can i say something man you you're a christian you're a child of god you need to make up in your mind i'm going to find my place in the house of god there ain't nobody going to take my place because i'm here to tell you right now if you lose your seat you at least gotta put somebody else in your place ain't nobody taking my place to find my place in the house of god i'm going to be faithful god like oh gabe remember amen the holy spirit said pastor i'm coming to the church i'm finding my place for the rest of my days i get sick of wimps and sissies and people that come and go and in and out if this is not no drive-through this is where you come to stay to serve god all the days of your life give him a hundred percent we're leaving here one of these days and there's gonna be millions of so-called believers set outside in the tribulation period and thinking oh my scares me to find people cold and stiff and hateful and mean and everything else claiming to be a believer you don't think your god's gonna take you like that you don't want nobody like that you're gonna be on fire folks you're gonna be hot if you're not you're going to be left behind and we're close folks when he went and traded that trump thing that was a signal even trump said they're persecuting me politically am i right that's right hannity and the different ones said man i'm telling you all of you what did hillary call us a bunch of uh what's he call us despicable no it was it was a different word deplorables there you go bunch of deplorables all of you deplorables and all of you that are conservative you better cross your t's that hannity said and dot your eyes because they're probably coming after you next if they'll do that to that what'll they do to you you're a whole lot less scared of him than they are you i mean they're a whole lot more scared of you of him than they are here all right i'll get straight all right are you all right now listen so now notice the cold formal all of those she said he said uh you know she's come to her end what is she doing head up into the confederation of churches we'll finally join with romanism to fight uh uh joint catholicism to fight communism huh now how many know all of those churches let the pope come to america or anywhere that does nothing to all of them they'll flock to that pope like you ain't never seen but the bible says they have already went into the ecumenical context those denominations are already part of that [Music] the image of the peace is already part of the beast amen so now this is what he says and pope john paul is called for all the churches to come back and they will and they'll unite themselves just exactly according what is thus saith the lord amen and the spiritual churches that it's in she's now coming to an end huh but that was never true if it's true now even the blood of jesus christ we're coming down to the end huh let's be honest when we see how many things is crept in the message probably in every one of our lives we could say hello we got to be careful about because your phone is a very dangerous weapon it is a weapon that can be used for the devil folks there's young people it's not sitting here this morning because of a telephone getting corrupted by the telephone and the tempting hour of temptation is so strong hello that it takes a genuine new birth to overcome what's out there young folks amen you got to get on no computer and everything else you got to write in your hand and everything it's a date you better have the holy ghost amen it's coming too in its end god look back into where she started with luther amen dallas wesley's sanctification baptism the holy ghost now at the end the spirit of christ is so in the church it's doing the same works that he did right back to the head again and ready for the church and the bride to unite and the coming of the lord jesus christ and the resurrection of the dead we're at the end i may believe that that's where we're at we're looking for the resurrection today praise be to god you see folks i just thought about this i think laying in bed last night i was thinking you know if you aren't in a rapture you're not even going to come up for a thousand years you get to be in your little nightmare for a thousand years after you go through the tribulation period because how many knows that's the first resurrection the rapture is the first resurrection all the deadly christ shall rise and every christian that is alive and remains into his coming they get caught up the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years thousand years because how many knows you don't come up to the judgment right not to laughter the millennium then it's the judgment folks i don't want to miss it do you no i don't want to miss it at all all right so everything's coming to an end then he says there is coming a time upon this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power of the first beast which was before it which was pagan rome it become palpa rome that this nation will do that we're going to go to revelation 13. amen let's go to revelation 13. branham describes now he takes a prophet i'm gonna know the prophet is the one that can take a book like revelation and tell you what it means he can give you the meaning of it that you can believe should i say a lot of people can give you meanings but i like when christ comes and proves it all right exercise all the power of the first now a lamb represents religion the lamb of god and remember it was spoke like a it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb after a while it received power and smoke like a dragon and exercised all the power that the dragon had it before and the dragon is rome always so don't you see roman denomination a mark protestant denomination an image unto the beast amen making a power that will force all protestants like a union and you'll have to be in this council of churches you won't be able to have any fellowship and it's practically that way now revelation 13 and let's go with uh laven and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and it had two horns like a lamb talking about the buffalo and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first peace before him and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed amen how many knows all you got to do is submit to the image of the beast because the image of the beast is com directly connected to the beast image of the beast catholic means universal don't it catholic means universal world is also universal a world council of churches all get together amen under catholicism all right dwell them to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he go do that great wonder so that he makes fire to come down from heaven on the earth and the sight of men and to see with them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do inside of men saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and causes many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed now we understand through the prophet of god that at some time or other we don't know just when or what what deal but the catholic church is supposed to bail america out right she's supposed to bail them out boy they're sure getting some we're we're making something to bail out aren't we yeah we just did the other day we're making a big bunch of bunch more to bail out but give it power see that one will give us power to do it so forth and notice and he causes all both great and rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their hand or in their forehead and that no man might buy ourselves save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name amen all right so we see that it will come down to a financial squeeze how many believe that this is to the philadelphian church age because i had the last church age before our age because that has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell on the earth welcome to the trying time from here on out i would say that that trying time is going to get greater and greater and greater would you like to see what the prophet said of how that's going to transpire only the elect he was talking about kitty from the hour of trent uh temptation page 3 13 on the church age book down towards the bottom he says only elect will not be full he says the temptation will come as follows the ecumenic move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless they're under direct or indirect denomination of this council i need everybody awake and listening very fast huh a lot of said in a little bit little groups will lose their charters their privileges etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people amen let that sink in until they lose all property spiritual rights now can i give you a wake-up call in this last bill that they passed i guess you know they're supposed to have 80 billion dollars 80 some billion dollars going to the irs to hire more agents and i've seen one of the strong left politicians say we need to give them more power than what we just did what in the world did they just do now how many knows that the department of justice the fbi has already been politicized under even the obama administration we they found and caught that they they were targeting the conservatives for audit they're right they said hey you can't do that they're already back then and now look at what they do is why wouldn't they do that much for the irs and then give them power just like the fbi is in the hand of the government and so forth and so forth we know that it's all already that way isn't that right now the irs comes down so that oh my to give them more power well that's the one that puts the squeeze on you isn't it we're going to come after you we need to give them more power so that they can come after you amen how many beliefs that's a wake-up call it's a wake-up call it's the squeeze they're forming it they're getting it ready in the politics and so forth putting it into law giving them all the power they need no doubt they can already confiscate it unless you doubt all your eyes across all your t's and got everything right amen so listen to what it says for example right now unless local ministerial association approves in in cases in most cities one cannot even rent a building or be have religious services to become chaplains in the armed service or hospitals it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable in the trinitarian ecumenical groups and as this pressure increases and it will i may believe it it will this pressure will increase it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege how many beliefs that that's the government that we're not facing a government that the first beast when you resist it you lost your life is that right you would be killed but he couldn't do that anymore under luther and so forth now it's through smoothness through slick and so forth and by just joining up with him or even agreeing with him makes you one with him i mean you got to watch who you agree with what you agree with because whatever you agree with is what you become and what you're partakers of and so he says it'll be hard to resist because they're going to put pressure on you and it's going to be pressure for people to give in amen it'll be pressure for churches to give in let me tell you something i'll give this place up in the heartbeat before i give up what i believe it'll be tempting dale no doubt no doubt it'll look all you got to do is sign here all you got to do is be a part of this and you can keep on going you better watch that amen you watch what you're part of all right now notice so he says revelation 13 plainly explains the lamb coming up out of the earth and other beasts come up out of the water thickness of multitudes of people this lamb come up where there was no people amen now remember it spoke like a lamb it was a limb received power and spoke like a dragon exercised all the power that the dragon had that's exactly what the dragon did if you don't comply to us we'll take your property we'll seize your property we'll do whatever amen the dragon before him and the dragon is always rome don't you see roman denomination the mark protestant denomination image unto the beast making your power that'll force all protestants into a union maybe i read this already and you'll have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship [Music] amen and it's practically that way now can you imagine him saying that way back then and on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of that all together that's exactly right because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes when the press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch then watch the third pulled in it'll be absolutely to the total loss how many knows it was the opening of the word the speaking of the word speaking squirrels into existence brother bannon made reference to on the third pool you say well we ain't going to be part of that why will we need the third pool then why we need to speak things faith we're going to have to have much more faith than what we do now huh now i want to show you where brother i'm even proud talks about how that that'll be the uh you know what causes us to have rapturing faith okay watch the press comes to a place you're pressed out watch the per it'll be for the bride and the church now we're closer than it seems to be i don't know when but it's real real close can you imagine brother batman after talking about thinking in kennedy's time that we're real real close let me see what he says here i don't know what it'll be it may not be me but i may be building the platform i may be taken before that time i don't know he says in that time maybe the coming week the holy spirit will come i don't know he may be next week he may be yet tonight i don't know when he'll come he doesn't tell us that but i do believe that we're so close that i would never die of old age yet at 54 years old i'd never die of old age until he's here where did that put us it puts us desperately close amen i'm gonna be we need to watch these signs we need to see these signs we need to see what's coming down the street and we need to be ready i want evening light cabinet i want every one of you to be ready for what's coming don't cut don't let it catch you off guard amen i i truly believe i would be the first one they would hit with everything they got huh always the leader they would come after every one of you and i'm telling you it's close it's so close that they dare to do something that ain't never been done before and they're getting it ready in the books and so forth and they've already already been guilty of it isn't that right i know one thing i'm really watching just midterms and i'm watching the next presidency because you know as well as i do that the way that things have gone it should change what if it doesn't that's a real sign that is so strong i've heard people say i've heard i've heard said that if if trump don't get reelected there will never be another republican elected politicians i'm not sure which one it was but it was well-known politicians made that statement maybe it's true maybe it's not but we're close i would never die of old age at 54. unless i was shot killed or something other way just old age wouldn't kill me until he's here amen praise the lord i think he'd be over 100 now i'm not wrong amen i want to say according to the scriptures everything has happened according to that vision i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world this message will bring christ back to the world aren't you glad to be in it thank you lord jesus so is the message to forerun the second coming of the lord praise the lord hallelujah you precious people just a little bit of politics again he was talking to the black people you precious colored people in the south how you voted you say you have no business saying that in the pulpit yes i have it's the word of god it's a stain on abraham lincoln the one that freed you i've always wondered that haven't you why the black people are all democrats there wasn't no democratic freedom and it's been proven that they really don't help them republicans will actually help them more than they will but they stay with it that's why i don't mind we're on national television today i guess as long as we're out there i thought about not that playing that this morning let abandoned preachers so i guess i will too let the chips fall where they may is that all right but listen he says to him he says listen to this the one that freed you laying yonder in that museum on a woman's stress and so forth and you sell your bird fries shame on you that's right shame on you and you people for politics because you're just a good democrat voted for something like that and sold your birthrights of americanism and christianity to give it over to that prostitute that run us into this nation and made us what we was see she's creeping in real easy until now she's on the throne how many knows now she's on the throne our leader is a catholic pelosi which is i guess acting president she's flying everywhere doing everything for him huh she's a catholic i read i did a study i asked here and she said there's about 80 catholic congress people already 80 of them huh creeping in i read another place he says every one in five americans are catholic [Music] one a five a fifth i guess could that be a fifth one a five that's a lot amen he used to we didn't have all of that now we got it on the throne and you and i are experiencing the only second catholic president that's there and don't they want to change the filibuster so that they can do whatever they want that's what that's the goal is do whatever they want amen my and how does it happen through a crooked loading through crooked voting amen that's a lot for me to say but i believe it i believe it it's sad isn't it that when people tell you one thing you've got to believe that it's exactly the opposite amen look at catholicism swallowing up swallowing them up swallowing up huh isn't that exactly what's going on up there they're swallowing this division up swallowing that department up swallowing this department up they're swallowing up everything they can and all i can say is swallow some more keep swallowing you can have it all because we're getting out of here because i know maybe wednesday we'll talk about the judgment of the great how many knows there's a judgment coming for all of that they're not getting by with it amen what are we going to do as missionaries going out younger trying to liberate south america and all over the world tommy osbourne and them trying to get people out of paganism and they can point their finger right back at our elected leader the same thing what's going to happen to this world he says it should shake every person in here how are we going to answer what's the missionary going to say to them you come here to liberate us from this when your own people put the very same thing in office on the throne we're now a pagan country once it's ever seen can we say ever since uh kennedy amen look back in the pages of history turn it back it's absolutely almost unconstitutional for to do it they would do it years ago we sold our christian rights to politics that's how the devil weaved himself in a ab was nothing but a figurehead to jezebel and that's all this will be can we say that's all this is that's right isn't it weird that even our even our fox news and different or says who's who's really running things around hey would somebody might tell me who's wrong well i got news for you i can tell you who's running things the catholic church is running things the pope is running things without going too far too much but how many knows that the catholicism holds the gold of the world they hold the goal of the world the jews hold the bonds and that right one day they'll make a pact and in the middle of the tribulation period they'll break that back amen but they hold the gold of the world how many knows those who hold the money give the orders amen those are the ones that rule all right nothing but jezebel brother van says ahab with nothing but a figurehead to jezebel that's exactly right picture constance you christians wake yourself up it's later than you think the conditions that we're in and how to let themselves get that way oh he says do you watch the wave of sin come in now amen oh my notice he'll conquer and almost has in his grip right now i wrote there another prophecy as we see this we see that it's almost in his grip right now amen just how is this going to happen is a little bit more evident but it'll be about your money they're going to try to make you do what you they want you to do because of that mighty benjamin friend sitting there in your wallet at least i hope you have a benjamin franklin i probably only have a george washington but because of money hello it'll be tempting to give in who wants to lose everything folks i don't know about you but when it comes down to that you can have it i'll find me a nice little cave or somewhere if i have to because i know god will bring a black bird around and have me a nice ham sandwich or something i mean it's got faith to believe that god's gonna take he says now the third pull we'll maybe preach on the third pull here soon but he says about the third pool is not gonna happen right now but when that squeeze comes you watch that third pull then how many believe we got to love one another we ought to be tied folks because if we are now we will be then we will need each other we will love each other we'll love god amen but it's important to do it now oh my almost has in his grip right now while he's still antichrist before he becomes incarnate beast how many and i could go through the scriptures won't take the time this morning we talked about woe to the inhabitants of the earth when that the beast come up to you oh to the inhabitants the dirt for the devil has come down to you oh my somewhere i have let me see here can i go a little longer thank you before he becomes be you talk about cruel punishment you just wait watch what them that's left here on earth will have to go through with there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth for the dragon rome spurted out water out of his mouth to make war with the remnant of the woman's seed huh wasn't you a message believer did you follow that prophet huh oh my that was left upon the earth after the bride had been selected and took out and that dragon made war with the remnant that did not want to come in it was hunted down another place he was says hunted down and killed like dogs huh killed hunted down and killed mine i believe if i'm not wrong i think most of you message believers that's been around here for a bit of time know he talked about those that if you don't make the rapture in order for you to even be saved don't even come up up until after that resurrection it'll be in somewhere after the resurrection or after the millennium in the judgment not the rapture part but it's foolish virgins and so forth those that actually give their lives amen let's hunt it down the real church will go through that the real church will go through that now aren't you glad i don't just stop there can i read the rest of it should i you want me to read some more i don't want to hear that the real church go through that if it was possible but you see they're under the blood by grace and it's not going through that no tribulation period for them the next thing for the church is the rapture praise be to god now watch at the same time that this guy's a conquering god's going to do something then too how many believes god did something in the middle of all this he has done a mighty work in the middle of all this i'm thankful for it to be part of it god's going to do something then too let's not just give satan all the credit here let's not talk about him altogether while this great thing is going on in this great system winding up in these organizations in the union so that they can pull themselves together now to me this is another scripture because we see the european union and all of those all the countries right right now who are they afraid of and who are they trying to persecute so to speak or boycott wrong communism they'll pool themselves together and stand against communism not knowing that god raised up communism to conquer them i've heard coming right out of the news and out of russia saying we'll we can blow them up and there won't be none of them countries and so forth and the union and all that even america threatening that if we participate in that war they've got some super stuff some real fast right threatening even nuclear now you look at how much we're giving and the missiles that we're giving ukraine and so forth to fight them and so forth i'm surprised they're not madder than they are i'm surprised they haven't thrown something at us and you better not support because you because they have said we are in direct military confrontation with russia pretty much said we're at war with him amen all right just in case you're wondering i'm in a two glasses i've went to the doctor came in and found out that just for regular seeing now hey man y'all are blurred to me so i got to wear these 125 glasses to see everybody out there clearly and then i got two twenty fives two fifties to read this so that you wonder why i'm changing i remember brother brian says i gotta change classes and i'm like lord of mercy i gotta change classes now but i don't want you to confuse with me doing this but he said he had a pair that he can look i guess and just transfer right you know let me say something real quick here uh before i know my life and everybody goes brother you lying you didn't go to doctor because i went to dr beiler that's what i did and i went to walmart and i got me yesterday i was uh studying it yesterday evening i said i put my 200 even on and i'm still blurry i said oh my goodness what's going on and so i says i gotta run to walmart and get 250s and then and of course things were blurry out there yet for me so i said you know what i said 175s i can't it's blurry when i look out there let me get one the lowest ones they got and see how that works and so i put 125s on i was like wow that's sunny and clear here are these ones yeah i'm seeing clear now you know praise god so i called myself a doctor i took care of it i said cause if a doctor goes and makes me wear blurred glasses i ain't gonna be where i'm gonna wear something i can see through so anyway i said i see the doctor's eye let me clarify that before i don't found he found a liar amen praise god all right so that's why i do that and so amen but i do want to save my blood sugar my blood sugar yesterday morning 1 22 122 130s 150s all in the good zone again by sheer diet because i did go to the doctor i did go to the doctor for my blood and so forth and and at first he uh she actually she said that she was going to prescribe me a as the smaller side as low dosage or mildest you know for controlling my blood and so forth and then she asked about cold and i said yeah i just had it and since that covered stuff it's when i all this mess come on me you know and so he says well look since it was covered in all she says we're not going to prescribe anything and we're going to see if we can't get it back down with just diet amen and so just a day later man it just dropped again and so i'm hoping for believing for the best aren't you amen and so y'all just pray amen i'm thankful for his grace praise the lord so we're going to keep a record of it all for two weeks and we'll see where we're at and go from there amen but i am thankful to amen to have been able to do it with the help of the lord on on grilled chicken salads the lord but anyway it helps when you diet right praise the lord amen god is good isn't he all right all right so we're down to the last one all right so i just want you to think about it as your pastor i don't want to lose any of my sheep i don't want to lose any of you so i feel like the lord laid this on my heart to give us all a heads up you know because brother bam did say one place he says i don't know if this one will do it or not he says but there'll be coming one and to me it looks like that one has come amen and so with every and they're doing everything they can amen to bring the squeeze down amen and so we're not afraid of it but it's a heads up and it's a like i said a turn by turn navigation saying hey look at there look there look at that be ready now be ready guys remember this one thing and i should focus on this because not only that time but many times brother branham said that when that squeeze comes it'll be to the total loss there come a time when you'll preach people won't be getting saved even though we're here isn't that right to the total loss so we want to be make sure that we're in that our lives are right that our lives are filled with the holy ghost we have that oil in our lamps amen that we're not foolish virgins because don't wait till the squeeze and then oh it could be too late then amen it could be too late then so you want to be ready this morning you want to be ready and awake amen and i want to say this again i want you to be sharp i want what i mean by sharp it's on your toes and ready not slothful and lukewarm and so forth like it's so easy to get because of the cares of life isn't that right amen praise the lord all right so now notice let me just read a quote here in closing now look god in his body christ christ in his body the bride that's what we've experienced now god made manifest in christ now christ made manifest in the bride how many beliefs that's what happened in our generation jesus christ completely clearly showed that it was jesus christ not a prophetess of prophet but it was the halo above it was christ in the body doing the very same works as it was in the days of lot in that sociality at the coming of the son of man in their right and the coming of the son of man talking about prophetic coming of christ and as god took from the body of adam the woman and she fell then god took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is the word and it's bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed that is why it's so important that thomas byler preaches only the word of god not my idea not your idea you're not you know it has to be the word of god because that's what we're married to that's what we're joining within the clouds and in the air is jesus christ and every word that he's ever spoken means everything to us and he's bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination creek no sir remember all we could get into it in revelations 18 uh the babylon had fallen had fallen had become the habitation of every unclean and hateful bird is that right that's what we're seeing out there but the bride he says come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues oh my i miss a lot i hope every man in here hears this tape and every woman will understand that see she's the second eve she's not breaking or spoiling her skirts of purity and holiness to her husband she'll stay with this word regardless of what anybody says you can have all the ecumenical consoles they can do whatever they want to but we're staying with the word saying with god amen moves that you want to in all the affiliate affiliations and they're going to now know this very next quote he says and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all churches amen shut up all churches you see that and the churches that's not in that denomination they'll use them for storehouses then amen my and if any man goes and offers prayer for anybody else that don't belong to ecumenical counsel we'll be shot on the spot a little hard to believe but that's what he said my and listen that's right like a lutheran minister said the head of it said it's right here you can read it right there he says don't make don't make any difference what they say the church will stand true to this light she's already proved it back under and she'll do it again how many knows down through those dark ages the real church of god they proved it pressure is good for us persecution is good for us brother brant says it brings out the best in us it's when we have it too soft and too nice is when we backslide amen amen she'll do it again in the face of everything of the word let all the ecumenical councils and everything else who will be gone she's going there she's gonna be there without spot and without wrinkle she'll stand there praise be to god let's stand this morning and amen like i said it's kind of a solemn moment realizing god realizing that just watching another milestone we're watching a little bit more of a getting a little closer getting a little closer all the time and to me what i feel this morning with heads bowed what i feel this morning is that god if the prophet prophesied just like jesus preaches a total loss last part of his ministry if that's coming up pretty soon where are we at this morning lord jesus i oh i pray that anybody that's not where they ought to be would raise their hands of god i'm not i'm not i'm not ready like i should be and i want to make ready right now lord i want to be ready father lord i want to be ready god bless your hands god bless you god bless you my hand is up but we want to be ready and we're watching you said watch watch watch watch watch keep watching don't get your eyes off of watching and be ready watch and be ready for you know not the day because he can come anytime i'm telling you he could come anytime to take his children home lord jesus now become one that raised their hand hands lord jesus to feel like they're not quite ready like they should be father and they want to get ready this morning i ask now lord jesus that you would forgive every sin any transgression anything they've done wrong lord jesus or not necessarily sinned or done wrong but just simply because of lord jesus because of the cares of life sometimes taking our eyes off of you the way that we that the way that it's not supposed to be we're not supposed to look at this world we're supposed to look at the world that is to come father this morning let's help us lord this morning to turn our eyes on you realizing god that everything you have spoken in the bible it is absolutely going to come to pass but we thank you lord jesus that you have given us insight father through prophetic eyes to be able to see when these things begin to happen lord look up for your redemption draweth nigh and father this morning we want to prepare our hearts not just here this morning in this moment but this afternoon when we go home tomorrow at work all day every day lord we want to always be getting ready and stand ready to meet you father for when you come lord jesus then we won't be lord jesus like the other part where they said the lord delays is coming well it's went this long so it'll probably no lord don't help us to have that attitude but to be right on our toes have our trim lamps trimmed and clear lord jesus bless each one now in jesus name amen and amen god bless you this morning amen brother david amen this is the evening time [Music]
