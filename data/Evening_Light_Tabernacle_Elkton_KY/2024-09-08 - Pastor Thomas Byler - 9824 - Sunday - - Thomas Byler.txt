TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning brothers and sisters if we'll just stand this morning maybe maybe brother Joe will open us in prayer this morning res morning problem just I amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school just have a little short Psalm here Psalm 20 short Psalm but a powerful Psalm sure is good to be in the house of the Lord this morning Psalm 20 the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of Jacob defend thee remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice SA we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all thy petitions some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God save the Lord let the king hear us when we call God bless you may be seated to Brother Brian morning brothers and sisters I hope it's you've had a good week and the week ahead you'll have a better week you know that Psalm there goes with those quotes that were on the thing this morning the sole purpose of everything our whole Endeavors in life is to have the very presence of Jesus Christ in our heart and life I mean there's nothing that can stand between you the believer as long as the Living God the Eternal God is living in the heart and life of you your family the church everything around you then there's nothing to be be afraid of and I was uh reading this this morning uh if you turn to the the prophet hay the first chapter this morning you know I was also listening to a a message this morning also and it really struck me what brother brandham had to say to that one Minister but I'll just read this chapter you'll have to forgive my pronunciations I listened to it you know on the Bible app but I know I'm going to mess up some of these words but this is where uh the Lord's talking to they've come out of uh Babylon you know they've come out of Persia they're in the new land and they're all worried about their own lives and everything that goes on with their own lives and they forgot the house of the Lord but I'm not thinking of it in in a natural sense I'm thinking of in this day and age how the the church and the people have forgotten in their own lives to build the house of the Lord in their own hearts and in their own lives and I'll just read what the prophet had to say as God spoke to him in the second year of dyus the king in the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by Hagi the prophet onto zerubabel the son of sheel the governor of Judea and to Joshua the son of jasak the high priest saying and this is what he had to say thus speak of the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the Lord's House should be built and and I'm not thinking in a natural sense I'm thinking in a physical sense form they then came the word of the Lord on BAGI the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your uh sealed houses and the houses and the house lying waste and he's talking about the house of the Lord but we're the house of the Lord this morning now therefore thus sayith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have sown much and bring in little that's speaks a lot to our lives you know you s a lot you do a lot but if you don't got God in your heart it's not going to prosper you got to go back to the source here and I lost my place but uh okay you've sewn much and you in little you eat I think I lost I I'm on the right spot you eat but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with a drink you're clothe you but there is none warm he that [Music] earnthenecklace the Lord where they could worship and it's no different for us I'm not thinking in a monetary way of providing I'm just thinking in our lives do do we do the things in our life that God ask us to do to be prosperous in the day that we live we all know what God ask us to do like brother Bram said your ABCs always believe Christ you know the things we need to do every morning every evening every day do we do we forget to do those things and then thus sayith the Lord theost can consider your ways go up to the mountain and bring wood and build house and build the house and and I will take pleasure in it and I will be glorified sayeth the Lord you look for much and lo it came to little and when you brought it home I do blow upon it why sayeth the Lord of hosts because of mine house that is a waste you run every man to his own house so it's the same thing in our own lives if if you're putting everything else in your life before the Lord you're going to be no different than these people in this day and age and he goes on to say therefore the heavens over you is stayed from due and the Earth has stayed from her fruit you know the blessings come does it always mean you're going to be blessed in everything you do no but the blessings come upon those that put God first in their life sometimes those aren't a natural blessing that could be a physical blessing and he goes on therefore the heavens over you is stayed from due and the Earth is stayed from the fruit fruit and I've called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon which the ground bringeth forth upon men upon cattle upon all the labor of the hands and then my pronunciations here then suub the son of shathi the Joshua the son of josac the high priest with all the remember of the people obeyed the voice of the Lord their God and the word of Hagi the prophet as the Lord their God had sent him and the Lord did fear be and the PE excuse me the people did fear before the Lord then spake Hagi the Lord's Messenger to the Lord's message unto the people saying I Am with You sayeth the Lord and and they begin to prosper when they did the right thing excuse me and then finishing these last few verses here it says and the Lord stirred up the spirit of zubar Ru and the son I'm not going to pronounce this word the same more never going to pronounce this word Sai the governor of Judah the spirit of Joshua the son of jeac the high priest and the spirit of all the REM of the people and they came and did the work in the house of the Lord of host their God and the 4 and 20 days of the sixth month and the second year of dyus the king and if you would turn with me over to 2 Thessalonians the 3 chapter but I was listening to that message um and I I wrote a note to myself this morning and it said faith in God we have to have faith in God and it's not something we can develop ourself God gives you every individual here this morning some form of Faith whatever that form of faith is you take that faith that God gives you you take it back to the word of God in the message of the hour and God will take that little faith and make it stronger each day in your hearts and lives you have to and you have to work in it every day to build that Faith to believe the promises of God but um I I just wrote what he was talking about I don't know I can't remember the name of the message but we all know the faith faith in God equals the power of Christ so faith in God will bring the power of Christ into your heart and into your life and it's not for yourself but it's for his kingdom and for his economy that he can benefit his people he uses you to benefit it's not something that we reach out in jealousy to grab for our own self God gives us to share with others and and the one thing I was also struck me about this uh about this message I was reading here in um third th thessal second Thessalonians the third verse I find as I get older I've have more time problems pronouncing words and he goes this is what Paul had to say here we know what the the second chapter talks it talks about the time Paul talks about this time we're in right now how the world has gone nuts and gone crazy and it goes back to what I was saying in in that chapter of Hagi and what brother Bram was talking about here if if you don't have the sense of Christ in your heart and life and you don't have the it's the blessings of God abiding upon you you your life will be like the world it'll just be a mess but when you have that you have something that keeps you on the road keeps you steady to go through all the trials of life and I'll just read what this chapter says in Thessalonians here it says finally Brethren pray for us that the word of the Lord may be have free course and be glorified even it is with you so Paul is telling the people just like brother brandham said pray for me that God will give me the Liberty to give back to you the word of God and the spirit of God it's all one big economy where we all have an equal part in it this morning and he goes on that you we may be able to deliver from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith and we know that truth you can take that scripture and see it in the world today and it goes on to say but the Lord is faithful who will establish you and keep you from evil so it's not yourself that's going to keep you from evil but if you trust God God will will keep you from evil and he goes on to say and we have confidence the Lord touching you that you do both do and will do the things which you we command and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ that's where're all at this morning now we command you brethren in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which we received of us when I read that scripture I think of my uh men andite and uh neighbors you know that they use that scripture in there a lot right there for you yourselves know how we ought to follow to follow us for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you and this scripture goes back to what brother brandham said and what what Paul said you follow Christ as I follow Christ he gave us an example neither did we eat any man's bread for not but rought with labor and Trava night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you so Paul was being setting the proper example not because we have not the power but make ourselves an example unto you to follow us for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat I guess if the government believed in the Bible that that' solve a lot of problems right there this morning and we go for here for before we hear that we are the same which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busy buddies but you can read this and see the world we're in this morning now them which are are such we commanded and exal You by the Lord Jesus Christ that which quietness they work and eat their own bread boy the world would be a lot better this morning if people just live that little scripture right there but ye Brethren be not worry and well doing and that's a really important that's something I think a lot about no matter what people do to you no matter what the circumstances in your life doesn't give you a reason to be hateful or to be disrespectful to other people that's what Paul is saying here this morning be not worry and well doing you can't be no matter what people do to you you can't be afraid to keep doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do and he goes on to say if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed but I guess a lot of people forget to keep going down with these other scriptures but count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother now the Lord of Peace himself give you peace Always by all means the Lord be with you the salutation of Paul with my own hand which is the token in every epistle as I Rise the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and I was just thinking I was listening to to that message this morning not wanting to lose anything here but um brother Brandon he was talking about he was dealing with these Full Gospel ministers and it really struck me how he answered these these ministers the and I could tell to these ministers he didn't say it but the way they were talking to him they had to be Church of Christ so they were basically trying to make fun of him saying well we've got a hospital full of sick people and we got graveyards full of dead people if you got faith like you say you should be able to raise the graveyard and and heal every sick person in the hospital and I I thought his answer really spoke truth to what I'm saying this morning um and it he wasn't being funny he was being honest with him he told those Brothers he said he said if that's true are he asked him first thing he asked Are You full go believers do you believe the word of God and you know of course they said they did well you know what he said he said well let's go walk into a bar this morning and I want you to exercise your Word of Faith this morning and save every soul in that bar this morning and I thought his answer is really true he was actually putting it back on them if they had Faith to believe the word of God then they should be able to go into any place in the world and convert every sinner in whatever that place was and I think he caught their attention when he said that this morning and the only thing I'll finish with this thing and like like those quotes that I know I say this a lot but everything we do in life it's meaningless unless you got the author of Life yourself abiding in your heart and life this morning brother David amen you love the Lord this morning me let's stand if we could this morning and it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen and we welcome our visitors this morning God bless you and want to sing This Little Chorus and I thought of it this morning and before I do I need to make an announcement before I forget that and it says uh evening like Tabernacle Fall Festival will be October 5th so just put that on your calendars that's the Fall Festival October the 5th amen this little course and then brother Brian said something and it brought it back to my memory in my life

his heart what you'll need for Wednesday amen amen how many believe that Jesus still has a table spread amen where the saints of God are fed amen amen and so he still calls for us to come and dine amen so we're thankful to be in the house of God this morning and amen and just uh what to by to try to express what the Lord's laid on my heart uh to preach amen and so um if you will let's just bow our heads before we open the scriptures we want to go to the author first father we come before you Lord we know that you are the author of this book lord and father to have the author in our hearts and in our lives Lord and to call you on the scene father to Lord to express and to say just what you want to say to your people this morning Father to your children so that we could eat so that we could Feast at your table Lord that we could come and dine Lord Jesus so that we could go away whole father we ask God that you would draw us closer to you this morning father and that we would go out those doors closer to you that than what we were when we came in Lord we ask God that you would help me to get out of the way and be you just Express father what you laid on my heart God to speak to the people and may we receive it father this morning we thank you and praise you for all of your goodness in Jesus name amen amen kind of a amen it's certainly I can't say it isn't something that I've ministered before but it's perhaps uh taken it maybe in a little different way amen that's that's all I about I do any more days is maybe just preach things that I've preached amen at a little different angle amen a little bit more God just reveals a little bit to me a little bit more and so yesterday while I was praying and Desiring and waiting on the Lord amen he gave me this thought amen and so that's where we started from and so we'll see what the Lord will have but if you will turn to Zachariah 4 Zachariah 4 amen for some reason this scripture came to my mind and it's just a portion just a portion of a verse amen one portion of the verse that I want to read Zechariah 4 4 and verse 10 for who hath despised the day of small things amen may God to add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen we want to talk about the day of small things day of small things amen praise the Lord amen so our thought goes of course back Amen to why the Lord Jesus Christ why God Almighty would even allow Humanity to fall in the first place is that right amen the Bible says that God's ways are so much higher than our ways his thoughts are so much higher than our thoughts amen but with the help of the Lord this morning we want to try to tap into the way that God thinks ain't that right amen the way that he thinks and he does and I believe in over in Hebrews I've said it many times amen when uh whenever Israel would not believe God when they came up to the Red Sea or when they didn't have anything to eat or when they didn't have anything to eat drink and so forth he says you know that they would not God promised that they would not enter into my rest because they have not known my ways amen how many believes that it's important for us to understand God ways and the way that he does things amen amen and so when we think about let me just start here also think about little things we think about big things amen big things small things a day have small things and now of course we know that God is a great big God he's bigger God than what your mind can ever comprehend your finite mind can't understand cannot comprehend the how great God really is amen amen just the one thought is trying to even think of how that he could have always been always been you know and so that's just almost unfathomable but he always was amen amen and so he made a great big world Amen we get are fascinated by the galaxies isn't that right the star systems and so forth and amen and uh uh I think Micah was talking this week and he was kind of talking about different things and and and pulling up quotes brother Glenn and and he pulled up one quote that brother Bram says he Al he said that one day they'll find out that they're not seeing way out there but that they're seeing in a circle ain't that right so you know he's a great big God and just the solar just out there it's great great big things which sa a serve a great great big God Heaven is his throne Earth is his foot stol he uh he he he encumbers all space and time amen that's really big to think that he is in all space all out there and in all time he he fills all time incomprehensible right even back to the Garden of Eden all of that time he fills all time and space the future the Millennium he's out there he's already there he's he's you know he's a great big God amen amen and so so we first realize how big he really is but the other thing is one thing that our prophet of God taught us was that the one thing that about God is he is so great in that so big that he can make himself so little and because he can make himself so little is what makes him so great amen and that's what we want to talk about with the help of the Lord a little bit this morning on each individual everybody here you know cuz he talked about a lot of times he says says if you ever talk to really great men brother Brams talked a lot of Great Men He says real Great Men amen will make you feel like you're the great man is that right because uh you know he they've come come to that place to where well they know they're great so they don't have to act great so they're humble themselves and talk about you and your things and and make you feel great I might as well go here while I'm on it but a lot of times I think about myself I think you know a lot of times we'll get in a conversation and we'll talk to people ain't that right amen and sometimes folks sometimes I don't even have to talk the other person does all the talk and talks all about himself I'll just say yeah right yeah right that's that's awesome brother that's awesome and I'm like Lord help me not you know get in a conversation where I always got to talk about me me me mine mine what I do this that the other but care about the other person what about you sometimes it's better to listen than it is to do all the Talking care more about what that person that's a great person and make you feel like you're great amen amen and so that's just a little touch on Small Things become small amen the day of small things amen so God dwells of course when you think about when we think about the world the world is always looking for big things people are always trying to be great bigger better nicer this that or the other never trying to be small never trying to be little amen or small in your own sight amen so let me just tell you one thing about Humanity each and every one of us amen we are taught in the Bible that he that humbleth himself or makes himself little God will exalt but he that exalts himself boy you're going to respect me I'm going to be a great no you're going to be brought down ain't that right isn't it strange and I just begin to think about little things and how that God is in those little things like humility not Pride but humility why the world don't have think much of humility do they no they don't think much of faith when you go to a doctor and you say I'm believing for my healing praise God they like well I'm not one of them religious Fanatics you know right they frown upon Faith so that's little to them but how many knows it's a big thing amen I wrote down here why why does God Amen uh demand of us and ask of us to have faith when it would be so much easier for him to just show us for you to be able able to see with your eyes but you know what I concluded that that would be easy wouldn't it it would be easy if you could just see it and not have to believe it but God expects greater things from us he expects more from us than to have to see everything to believe amen that's right that's why it's impossible to please God without faith because if you know that he is and that he is in the invisible realm God Amen says that we live not Paul said we don't live by faith I mean by the things that we see but we believe on the things that we have not seen amen amen so contrary are the ways that God thinks and the way that he does does than what we think so we realize as sitting here brother Tommy's Grandpa passing away death funeral homes a't that right getting old getting feeble our mind's slipping a little bit can't pronounce things the way we used to I can't hardly preach like I used to my mind ain't as fast as it used to be hello my voice sometimes I have to struggle just to have a voice you can hear the raspiness yeah even my voice is changing but all of this sickness sorrow all it was all part of God's plan part of God's plan that's right he allowed it as a matter of fact when he made Adam and Eve he knew that Eve would fall it took a a real absolute prophet of God to actually say that she he took her out of a rib because she was not the original creation but a byproduct amen and he knew that she would fall and he knew Adam would step out amen there was a purpose in it amen amen pray praise the Lord so we want to look at these small things if we can and I think we'll go to let's go to Luke six Luke six we know the birth of Jesus Christ amen the how that he was born in a manger isn't that right not in a hotel room in a big fancy place in a great luxurious thing but in a horse stable so to speak his very coming was in humility in meekness little small humble is that right that's where God dwells how many knows that God dwells in humility God doesn't dwell in great big fancy things for some reason we as humans we always have to have things fancier bigger better and all of that amen now let's just look at Jesus here now we know that he said uh that we should be as the master amen the disciples should be as the master if they persecuted me they'll persecute you if they loved you they'll if they love me they'll love you but if not you know they'll hate you like they haed me a't that right and when he begins to Proclaim blessings upon people the blessings this is in St Luke 6 and verse 20 uh verse 20 and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor amen for yours is the kingdom of God my wow I thought he'd make us rich I thought we'd become a multi-millionaire or he'd do great no but blessed are ye poor wow now some of the things that I'm going to say this morning is is uh something that well how do I would how would I express it something that we haven't really experienced or don't know because we're in a rich country we're lead AIA an age of riches amen I looked in my closet this morning thinking of uh all of those pairs of shoes that I've gotten you know all of those pairs of shoes all of those suits of clothes when the Apostle Paul had maybe he had to ask Timothy to bring his coat he had maybe one pair of clothes one pair of shoes you know isin that right we want to talk about Paul but instead of Rich he says poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh amen so he's saying man if you're weeping and then you're sighing and crying for the Abominations and the wickedness that the worlds and end and so forth and you've got the baptism the Holy Ghost now we are blessed person you're better off weeping now cuz then later on you're going to laugh amen is it something I just comes to mind but didn't Jesus say you know the last shall be first and the first shall be last so guess what God's calling you not to be first not to be the head and all that but to be last the least the base Amen in this world because as Christians I want you to you're a special class of people called to a special walk and our future is not here our fut future is over there amen those Dark Ages those 68 million Christians that died horrible deaths they were last they am mean they were burnt they were all of these things but when they come in the glory of God when they come with Jesus and all the Holy Angels all those who killed them that were first that were the boss that thought they were the dictators will look upon them and realize you know they are with God now we're first now you're last amen our glory is then not now this is man's day ain't that right this is Satan's Eden that's why you have the corruption that you do amen amen listen part of what brought me to this and this thought was the fact that I begin to think about brother brandham and how that you all remember when he was uh in his trailer one time and the back part of his little trailer he had a little typewriter that he would send people their mails back and so forth and he thought about Billy Graham he thought about or Roberts and their big universities and they got to have tens of thousands of dollars coming in to make it every day and they can't take little meetings they got to have so much to have a meeting ain't that right they have big universities and all that they were doing and he said look at me look at this what I've got a little trailer a little typewriter I have nothing I'm little and remember but Braham said I stay little I don't want all of that because I don't want to have to do I want to be able to go to a little group of 12 or so if a God calls me to go there I believe it was Shalom isn't it the Sarah Vista back there on the back side of desert I believe it was where he preached them great message of Shalom to just a very small group of people the the Bible says uh uh uh fear not little flock for it is the Father's Good Will to give you the kingdom amen straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life and few there be that find it Amen brother B I'm talking about and I want to just stop here because you know talking about poor brother brandham says I do appreciate every man that God I see poor people when they haven't got nothing and see them come up and get a nice home and an automobile and and uh you don't know how good that makes me feel just to see poor people he says I know what it's what it means to be poor I'm poor yet will die poor but what it means to me to see people when they've come up and God has blessed them it just shakes my heart you think about that you think about brother manam one time pulling off the out of meetings here because he got 10 $15,000 in debt and he promised he would never pull for money he'd never be one of them Beggars and so forth is that right course God said later on you know to for them to take up a offering and receive an offering that's okay a't that right but he didn't want no part of all of that so even brother Bram had to get his mind right about things but he didn't want all of that amen and then one time uh here's another place what yall remember uh that that big mission Bell wiy and all when God I believe somebody was healed in that in in in in that realm and somebody wanted to they had were they had $28 million I think and they wanted to give brother bam a million and a half dollars this is what he said he said I don't care what he owns sir my father owns the cattle on every Hill I don't have any need of the money see and he said I was just seeing your mother's home he said and yours here your parsonage you could use it I wonder how many message preaches would turn down a million and a half dollars they're probably millionaires already probably wouldn't even turn it down amen this wife yeah my mom needs it my family needs it I could GI this out or the other but there was a he wanted he brother Brandon was not about the money he was about your soul he was about getting you to Christ amen and said you could use it I said yes and when I need it father will give it to me I don't need it now and I refuse to look at that at it a million 500,000 in in one offering I'd rather take 50 cents or a dime from so and so and so and so and let everybody have a part in it then to take one big lot of money heartaches and headaches troubles and then you think well it's just too much he said it's just too much the curse of the love of it he talked about the curse of the Love of Money amen now I don't believe it's wrong to be rich I don't believe it's wrong to have a lot of money but in James you read James it says if you are rich you make sure you use it for the glory of God distribute to the necessity of the Saints if you use it right it's perfectly fine amen look how rich job was amen but to use it right if you are but I'm just going to point out this morning that most in the Bible weren't 68 Millions had to live in caves and dens of the earth and so forth Just To Survive you and I don't you ever complain we should never complain about anything remember butam said well he say we don't have it persecution enough we have it too easy if there's anything that makes people lazy is when they have a life of ease amen how many knows that's what we got to watch out we got to watch out for that the cares of riches and riches don't choke the word out of our Lives amen said he's met as many penes as he did millionaires people that are just hungry for money and money money money money amen now notice so and so everybody heartaches troubles the curse of the love of it I was born poor raised poor my people are poor I want to die poor huh I want that's what he said that maybe they have a misprint there but he said I want to die poor I hear a lot of brother him when he would say you know you know people give me money and so much I get for the church this that or the other and he says I turn it around and I put it straight into missions every bit that I can other than feeding my family and clothing my family I put it in the missions brother Brandon was missionary minded he believed in putting his extra money into missions if he did get any extra that's where it went amen my see the only thing that I do want when I die is Fai with God how many's with this there that's right favor with God that's all I want I brought nothing into this world it's certain that we can take nothing off that's true so what we get from the line of God is the only thing that we can take with us so if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or be popular amen oh I'm going to go ahead and stop it come but you know I wonder sometimes around the message people want to be popular popular we want the biggest church people want the biggest church the biggest crowd huh folks you can bet one thing this boy here listens to popular preachers huh to whether they're really being popular they're really serving God or not amen I'm going to do I'm going to go ahead and say this but I heard I heard one say you know if your church ain't on fire amen you need to leave that church I don't care what job you got you call it get out of there I'm like why you telling people that huh oh our walls are fixing the bus open and just that be careful be careful because if you go after that thing God will pull back God ain't in that amen one thing I've learned as a pastor here is that God builds his church God does the doing it has never got to be my carnality or myself to get into it and try to build it I want every person in here that God wants in here if he doesn't want you in here then you need to find a place where God does want you my Prophet the prophet of God taught me that each Pastor is uniquely built with his experence experience and everything for that area and I believe that and I'll I'll say this Brother Brad I believe each person sitting in the pews has to be uniquely built to sit under a crazy man like me yeah I believe it but if you're just in the will of the Lord Lord that's all we want ain't that right as long as we're in the will of the Lord we're happy and guess what we don't have to move no matter what comes or what goes no matter what storms blow and how many huff and puff and try to blow the house down and justess as me it's tried to happen it'll never happen as long as God has got our hand on us amen praise be to God so I think I thought that you might like that amen I thought that's right not that be have be big homes and popular but just pray that I can stay in the hands of God mold clay amen that he can mold me and use me in any way that he he's fit to do it I'll pray the same thing for you amen praise the Lord listen when we dig in and brother B was talking about going to the catacombs of uh of Rome and so forth and seeing those lives that people that gave their lives for the gospel and how they died and lived in those caves just to be able to live the little babies in the corners of those caves amen the little Church they had down in those catacombs and so forth dig up those lives of those great men back there how that they sacrificed he says you'll see how little you've done makes me feel ashamed of myself sometimes amen oh how we have to have everything so easy amen part of the fall of the creation was so that you wouldn't have it easy he made it hard those funerals are hard that sickness is hard toiling having to go to the work every day lay block cut trees down do whatever it is it's a labor it's a job things go wrong things go bad hello but he did it for a reason wo Glory aren't you glad God had it I I've always sat here that the plan was a good plan God has a good plan a lot of people probably wouldn't say that but I'll say it amen his plan was a good it wasn't no accident it was no oops well let me fix that no he knew exactly how it was going to be he knew you he knew every one of of us that would sit here this morning he know you needed to listen to it there's a even the purpose and the way that even uh the Lord brought this message to me amen I believe in the little things remember it's the little foxes that spoil the vine it's the little things that matter with God sure how many believe little things matter with God Amen I'm I'm going I'm going to finish reading this and go to the next one blessed are ye when men shall Pat you on the back and say oh man you're so nice no when men they'll hate you woo that's right and when they shall separate you from their company blessed are you and shall reproach you say and cast your out name out as evil for the son of man say woo Glory the people call you devil call you evil B Rejoice they called him be elub see the way the world L they gave him the lowest the littlest name that there was to give him the most horrible name the chief of devils that's what the world gave him the religious world the church world Amen why do you think they say he's a false prophet oh don't follow that false prophet it's easy to go with the denominational system that's an easy road but to suffer for the reproach to believe in a God is and a prophet amen God's always made it to where it's not easy every age it's never been easy to follow the right way amen we must go beyond and bear his reproach amen okay rejoice ye in that day and leap for Joy for behold your re is great in heaven for in like manner did they also to the false fathers unto the prophets but wo unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation amen what did David say he says don't let me be poor I might steal or don't make me too rich I might leave you just give me what I have need of how many likes that say Lord just give me what I have need of Amen woe unto you that are full now you don't need nothing for you shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for you shall mourn I can just imagine that this scripture was probably read a lot in the catacombs in the Dark Ages but for us to read it here and when we're full when we're rich when we have everything we have need of Amen one too you are full hunger laugh one to when men shall speak well of you for so did they their fathers to the false prophets I say unto you which he love your enemies and do good to them that hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you and unto him that smile the on the cheek turn the other also wow you talk about belittling when people belittle you speak bad of you if you're a Christian you better expect it Paul said all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution Jesus is telling you here the way that it's going to go amen so you're going to be ashamed or you're not going to be ashamed I'm not going to be ashamed I'm not I'm never going to be ashamed to say God sent a prophet in this generation any Christian any person out there God has sent a prophet in this generation and you need to hear him it's up to you whether you want to or not but Jesus didn't come and do all this amen for us not to tell the world about it that which you hear Proclaim on the housetop amen so I thought about this I thought wow even there as you can see will be the last in this world not first Not Top Dog amen First Corinthians I think I will cover another area while I'm covering it before I go into this other direction and I believe it's found in uh Luke 19 let's go to Luke 19 first actually yeah Luke 19 this has to do with the way that we handle money and I believe it's not just about money but it's about any detail of our life okay um Luke 19 we read the story of how a nobleman went into a far country and he gave his uh servants 10 servants he gave him 10 pounds and so forth but then in verse 16 when he came back then came the first saying Lord thy pound hath gained me 10 pounds and he said unto him well done thou servant thou has been faithful in a very little very little have thou authority over 10 cities how many believe he faithful to be it's we need to be faithful in the little things faithful in the little things God sees the Small Things amen he had 10 pounds and he gained no thy pound pound has gained me 10 PB so he took one pound took a dollar and turned it into 10 took a 100 and turned it into a thousand amen took a thousand and turned it into 10,000 all right and the second came saying thy pound has gained me five pounds he also likewise said unto him be thou also over five cities and another came saying Lord hold here this thy p i hel here this p and kept it laid up in an app and of course we know what happened to him he said take what he had give it to somebody else amen so we see here he says that even in talking about money in Luke 16 and verse 10 it says he that is faithful in that which is the least Is Us Faithful also in much he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much how many beli it's important to be right in the little things Lord help us to do the things that's right in the little things now something else I wrote down here about small small the day of small things even God's voice that leads you that guides you is called a still small voic he could have be audible I know he could tell us brother Troy hey I want you to don't do that do this do this you know he could tell us he could be audible but he don't want it to be that easy he wants you to have to listen how mean you got to listen I got to us ministers we got to listen we got to listen hard Lord what would you speak to the people tomorrow what do you want them to hear what do you want to say amen and that little still Small Voice will just speak amen our daily lives we need that small still voice God loves when you believe in him even though you don't see it even though you don't hear it audibly yet you hear it in here something here speaks to you amen amen amen yesterday I think Grace was at the table and I said day of small things the day of small things that's what the Lord my heart to speak amen Small Things little things humble things little things are humble things insignificant things isn't that right all right so be faithful in that which is at least is also in so if you'll be faithful in little things you'll be faithful in much how many believes that God cares of he talking about money I mean he wants you to be faithful with your money he wants you to spend your money right folks there's been time that I've been in debt and and and instead of paying a debt I'd go buy something else that's not a good way to do it but I said Lord I'm going to take this money another time I'm gonna take this money I'm gonna pay off my bill I'm gonna pay this bill off and you wouldn't believe the money did come afterwards I'm like boy thank you Lord why cuz God knows how you use your money if he's pleased with how you use money he'll give you more do the right thing amen I preach on money for some reason this morning but but isn't it true that uh a person you can be poor and yet you can have thousands of dollars in the bank poor people can have plenty of money in the bank if they manage it right but other people they can make pretty good money and not have a dime and be in debt up to your neck and everything else why because because you don't want man it's your money right we all know that you could be a millionaire you'd still be broke you're broke with whatever you have if you was a millionaire you'd still end up broke why it's because you don't manage it right you don't use it the way that you ought to but you can be poor and still be in good shape praise the Lord anyway that's free free monetary advice today pay your bills and instead of spending it on something else yet if you've got them praise the Lord be content with what God gave you maybe he'll give you more use it right you'll be rewarded amen praise the Lord now let's look at little things base things humble things nothings amen 1 Corinthians 1 1 Corinthians 1 how many knows that God most of the time and a lot of times calls to use in his Service Little People small people but Abraham said David was not a big man Samson wasn't this Hercules they were already little fellas so if you're a little fell insignificant don't feel like you're nobody you're a good Prospect for God to use greatly wasn't it Moody I believe was also a small guy he I think it's him the one that was in Chicago come out and had a r rasp in his voice or something and he couldn't talk right and and everybody man what who comes to listen to you he said they don't come to listen to me they come to listen about him Amen brother Brandon was a little fellow ain't that right Saul was a big man look what he did not too good God chose David on the back side of the desert a little fell small humble amen it says in verse 26 for ye see your calling Brethren how that not even many wise after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are even called huh that's right not the great big people most of the time they're not even called God don't even call that's what the B God don't even call him the Common People heard Jesus gladly God chose the foolish things like Faith ah you believe in faith you believe in God for healing it's foolish to the world Amen well some voice told me that I should do this or that oh such stupidity it's what people think world thinks may be small but God loves it God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty now you see how God thinks the base and base things of the world and things that are despised hath God chosen yay the things that are not to bring to not the things that are amen many examples how many knows that Moses was a nobody on the back side of the desert little little let me read this before we go on not long ago I was invited to Chicago by a group of saints to speak and some great Pentecostal Minister there with about four degrees from college and so forth he didn't want my little cheek chacker way of speaking up there before that great Council that David was going to have so they had a had a man from a great Bible school there to come up great Bible School of Chicago to make a speech the man said now he said what we would do come up there and he would belittle those people for about everything that he could think of and how the wrong they were for believing in the Holy Ghost and all that stuff like that before Pentecostal people he walked up there with his chest out and his collar turned around and a tuxedo sudon throw all of his notes out there on the platform and he had him a masterly fix and he could just explain the Bible away and God didn't know nothing about it and the first thing you know it didn't take with the people he kept saying something like that and and they just sat and looked at one another it didn't go with them kind of people them Pentecostals so after a while he seen that he was defeated and he got his stuff up under his arm walked off the platform his head down drooping huh he went up there big came down little drooping and all say sitting over by the wall said if he' to went up the way he come down he'd have come down the way that he went up that's just about the way it is too humble yourself see how little you can be how humble you can get humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will lift you up amen how many believes we have that we as human beings we constantly even though me that doesn't matter that self always wants to rise up always wants to rise up amen always like to let Pride come in pride comes in so easily you think you're somebody huh how many know brother Braham said he says you got to become a nobody we little think of everybody else better than yourself how many believes if you're a real Christian you think of everybody else as better than your own self amen that's right instead of thinking of yourself so highly we do I do sometimes we all do don't we we have to be careful about that amen see how little you can be not what you know amen just let yourself get humble before God Amen perfect strength by Perfect weakness let's talk about this for a minute God has choken chosen the weak things of the world to confound the wise how many believe that the weak things of the world the base things of the world the nobodies of the world to make some bodies out of you but no matter who you are you have got to become a nobody before God can make a somebody out of you I don't think I've got it no you all remember brother Braham says you know we got to get ourselves to onto Damascus dust realize you're a nobody and then he said and then keep yourself there keep yourself off your high horses amen praise the Lord that's right stay humble say Lord just keep me humble before realizing of myself I am nothing amen it's only what he makes of Us Praise the Lord Paul he said it this way for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear at least any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me and least I should be exalted above measures through the abundance of Revelations there was given unto me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me least I should be exalted above measure I know we don't know we think that was his eyes he couldn't never see right it's just something that bothered him all the time bothered him and bothered him and bothered him and bothered him that right for this thing I besought the Lord three times that I might that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in your weakness God takes the little things God takes your weakness Amen in Hebrew Hebrews it says in verse chapter 12 11:34 they quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword and out of weakness they were made strong amen wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens others listen others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Y moreover in bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were saw aund they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skin and goat skin being destitute Afflicted and tormented woo little despise cast out but that's where God is can you imagine one of us running for the president of the United States yeah I'm running for the president nope I don't believe believe in lgbs I don't believe in homosexuals and all of that you just lost the you just lost it because even Trump no matter he's got to go along with all that stuff huh we don't fit into that place at all that's how far the world is from a real Christian amen we're listen destitute Afflicted mourned of whom the world was not worthy they wondered about in deserts and in mountains in dens and caves of the earth huh thank you Lord that we've got it this nice amen seen yesterday where the person that predicted the last nine out of 10 presidents was right nine out of 10 times predicts that Harris is going to get it so don't expect things to get better don't expect it to go prices to go down hello I'm only think expecting worse until I get out of here and then the skies will catch fire so you noticed I said I'm not just I'm just expecting the skies to catch fire I'm expect to be out of here before the skies catch fire but it's going to get worse and worse and worse the prophet of God said until these Skies begin to burn all this amen but look at these that's right that's how they were that's how the Christians of long ago were amen but Paul let's look a little bit bit bit more about Paul first of all we realize that Paul he was a great man wasn't he he was a Pharisee of the Pharisee teacher of the teachers a man that was trained from childhood for the ministry to be an eloquent man and a smart and Brilliant to come before a class of people like the Corinthians and say I was with you and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in trembling amen listen to what he says brother baham says this about him a man who had turned the whole world upsite down the greatest missionary that's ever been known confessed that he was that he come in weakness boy we preach strength strong yes strong in the Lord weak in yourself amen because the only way that God can ever use us amen and I I and I titled this amen up before I titled it the day of small things staying with God staying with God how many knows it's a job every one of us once you're with God you got to stay there with him amen because it's so easy to get sidetracked to get lifted up and things all right praise the Lord a man who turned the world upside down the greatest missionary that's ever been known confessed he came in weakness not as a trained scholar but in weakness and in fear least he'd step off the path somewhere in much trembling because that he could not trust in his own ability ability amen how many believes that we cannot trust in our own ability as we as preachers we should be shaken up here we should be a little nervous God don't let me get in my flesh don't let me get in myself Lord help me just to say the things that you once said Lord let me stay in the spirit amen same way when we were around one another no matter where you are what you're doing Lord help me always when my mouth opens when I say something that it would be the Holy Spirit speaking and when I think something let it be God's thoughts let me help the make that other person feel better amen amen praise the Lord oh my all right oh I hope this gets down deep to us a quote I've read before both here and in the tape world too you've got to realize that you've got to become a nothing not a know it all amen I catch myself so many times talking to people they'll tell about experience and the first thing I got to do is open my big old blabber mouth and the experience the experience I had about such things yeah when you're 60 years old there's very few things you haven't experienced or went through before amen but Lord help me to listen to other people really that's it's just awesome Amen but not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody amen become dust get to the place that that you know you're nothing amen well you want a scripture for it how many wants a scripture for it he miss Jesus says without me you can do nothing you're nothing without him we're nothing without him it has to be the Holy Spirit doing it how many believes that amen I can do nothing without the power without the strength of almighty God then you in shape for living a humble simple I like that humble simple Christian life amen that's right right here it is that you're nothing and don't never rise above that amen that's the problem even didn't even brother Bram says a preacher will get up there preaching and he'll be humble and after a while he thinks he's a somebody and raise up and uh oh we fix to have a fall it's easy to rise above it is my message it's easy to rise above you realizing that you're nothing without Christ well he ain't going to talk to me like that he ain't going to do me like that just go ahead rise up let that old flesh come up what about when they come and smack you on your cheek somebody does you wrong hello we'll find out whether you're strong or not or whether you know because God this is what God loves to do he wants to prove us he wants to try us so he guess what he can't always let things be easy he allows things to get hard for a reason he allows trials you come your way to see what you'll do about it we know that because when he led Israel out of the land of Egypt the first thing he did is put him in a dead end right down to the Red Sea got him between some rocks and down in there couldn't go forward backwards couldn't go any which way and let him sit there he'll bring you to a hard place sometime between rocks and hard places to see what you'll do will you really have that which the world despises called Faith or not it may be little to the world but it's big to a Christian and it's big to God faith is Big to God and you got to have it to believe in the Unseen amen praise the Lord amen I'm just going to say what comes to mind wasn't brother brandham given a Cadillac and he just sat in the garage just sit in the garage just sat there he didn't want to rrive a Cadillac that mean you can't have a Cadillac I'm not saying that I'm just saying he didn't want to drive around in the Cadillac he went and preached to poor people over in Arkansas and everywhere else and he comes pulling up in the beautiful Cadillac wow that preacher is driving a nice car if it's just way he was amen it came to mind so I said it is that all right Lord help us humble ourselves can we humble ourselves amen praise the Lord okay so oh what a preacher this great man who sought God he said God I am weak I don't know what to do I just pray God strengthen me take my infirmities away from me and these things so I can be stronger and God spoke back to him said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness and Paul said I will glory then in my infirmities let me go can I take a little more time where it's time time's up already can I go a little longer this morning we'll go overtime this morning that all right M so Paul said he's going to glory in his hardships in his infirmities he said here into chapter four of 1 Corinthians verse 9 I think that God has set forth us Apostles last well the scripture for before that he says now ye are full now ye are rich now you have reigned as kings without us and I would to God that you did Reign that we might also reign with you but I think that God has set forth the apostles last as it were appointed unto death we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to Men We are fools for Christ's sakes but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honorable but we are despised even un this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are Buffet it and have no Dwelling Place thank God for what you have if you don't leave not with nothing else this morning you thank God for what he has what you have and be thankful for the grace of God that we aren't having to go out there and be shot and persecuted and burned at the stake how many believes we ought to be thankful for what God's given us CU those disciples on down through the ark eight you was not promis any kind of a flowery bed of ease amen don't allow your ease and how easy you do have it to drown out the Lord Jesus Christ do not allow the love of money to keep you from church to keep you doing the way that you're supposed to do because you're not supposed to have the people love money that's that's what's evil the love of money is the root of all not money itself but the love of it got to have it got to have it I don't care what it cost me what I got to do how hard I got to work ain't nothing wrong with believe in preaching everybody and our kids ought to be pushing them mowers whenever they're young and start them a little mowing business that's the way mine did and go from one to the other learn to work work hard hello I believe in people working I don't believe in people being couch potatoes and lazy but at the same time don't go to loving so money money that more than you love God dwell no certain Dwelling Places in labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted suffered is that right think about God had could have had the prophet of God he could have been a multi-millionaire and he didn't Paul look at what God did to Paul Paul had him in this kind of condition and he was the one that wrote the New Testament his number one Apostle so to speak that right no certain Dwelling Place even he says and he Paul would go into a city and built tents I believe it is work with his own hands to make his own way man God could have poured it on him he wouldn't have he could have had a life of e but God allowed it how many believes God allows the things this way amen that's right listen with our own hands being reviled we bless there's one one man person could that could do what Jesus said if we uh bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you and here Paul was saying that's right being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world little scum of the earth huh to the world the Christians the scum of the earth why do you think there's such an onslaught against the conservatives and Christians hate your guts do anything that shuts you down hello but guess what what's the scum of the earth and Satan is the cream of the crop for God how many believe that you're the cream of the crop you're the best because God is first for you you accept it what he did for you you have power over the enemy how many beli you got power over the enemy amen you don't succumb to the enemy that's right you have power power over the Earth how many believes you got power over the Earth you have been given Authority a dominion over the Earth so why aren't you the mayor why aren't you the governor why aren't you the president hello because that's not the Earth we're talking about Satan is the god of the governments Satan is the God of all of that but this is one Earth that you got control over over this is the Earth this is the world on which you're living in and you've got the power over all of this amen they aren't going to dictate they're going to tell you what you have to believe and what you can believe they might censor all of your Facebooks and everything else they might censor all of that well you can't say that you can't but they ain't going to tell you what you can say or think hello this is your world Amen don't tell me what I got to can or cannot believe nothing right no we'd lay our lives down for the truth wouldn't we amen that's right if they've why do you think Jesus said unless you're willing to take up your cross hello unless you're willing to die for me don't even bother trying to follow me unless you hate your own life also hello in other words that's where you got to become a nobody your life yourself has to die you got to die to yourself that's what that means by coming coming to nobody or a nothing that person has to die so God can live Jesus demanded it amen may we stay with him how many say God help me always to stay humble amen I proud I'm I want to say this morning can I give you a rose I'm proud of yall I'm thankful for the church here ministers come by and says man I love to go to that place I love to go to y'all's church after service everybody's so friendly kind stays around wherever we go there there there's no Fellowship like that in other churches other churches aren't near like that I'm say really well I'm glad that we got friendly folk nice folk hang around love each other there's just that atmosphere amen God bless you amen all right so that's right so Paul says I will glory in mine infirmity let me see if we can find that it's right here somewhere I think it was second Corinthians all right seeing that many glory after the flesh I will glory also you want to brag about something let's brag about something ye are ye suffer fools gladly seeing that you're wise for you suffer if a man bring unto you in bondage but ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take you if a man exalt himself if a man Smite you on the face I speak concerning reproach as though we had been weak how be it wherein soever any is bold I speak foolishly I am bold also are they Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so am I am of the Seed of Abraham so am I are they the Ministers of Christ I am more in labor in a more abundant in Stripes above measure in prisons and more frequent in deaths often how many know he was beaten he was stoned of five times received die 40 Stripes save one Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and a day I have been in the deepe in journeyings oftens in Perils of the water and per Perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen remember those uh Jews that bound themselves to an oath they would not eat until Paul quit breathing I guess they must have died or they didn't keep their word one because God kept him alive they going to get hungry in perils by the Heathen in perils in the city perils in the wilderness perils in the sea perils among my own false Brethren among false brethren in weariness and in painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not if I must needs Glory I will glory in the things which concerning that are concerning my infirmities amen amen can we say praise be to God it doesn't matter what you've went through he's delivered you out of it no matter how much sin you were in he has forgiven you and he's washed your sins away any problems that come away amen any troubles that you have don't let that just be a situation amen it's an opportunity to give God praise that's what Paul's saying all these infirmities and all my weaknesses and all my trials God gets Glory thank than you Jesus that's right amen oh I've got so easy I'm so lazy I'm so lukewarm I'm so I've got it so nice do we go clapping for that no no we clap it whenever we do have hard time we don't want them we don't ask for them but if God allows him to come our way and he will he allow things to come we give him praise and glory anyway because he promised to take it through amen that's what Paul did he gloried in his infirmities amen and if you'll notice I'll just jump over my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest in upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities [Laughter] maybe I shouldn't ask everybody to repeat that brother rad huh I you know I take pleasure in my infirmities no we probably don't Paul did that's what he said takes pleasure in his infirmities how many knows that would be real hard to
