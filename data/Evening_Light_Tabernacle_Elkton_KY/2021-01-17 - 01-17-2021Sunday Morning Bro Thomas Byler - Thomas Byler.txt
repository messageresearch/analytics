for brother brad amen next sunday morning amen so uh praise the lord god is good just good to see everybody amen and trust everybody's in good health amen it's certainly good to see the house so full this morning amen i know i'll tell you different times we've had that cove would go around here and i thought told different ones well maybe evening like tabernacle's done with that and then but it seems to still be jumping up here and there amen and so i know sometimes i think well you know maybe we should slack up on having services but uh but i tell you what you take wednesday night out and it's just too easy to leave it off so we're just gonna keep going is that all right amen praise the lord because we just do the days approaching amen today of his comings approaching could be any time we know he said many times he says he'll come in a day in an hour you're not expecting and we're living in the times that that could happen just any time so we need to be ready amen so we enjoyed the music thank you all for the specials this morning amen brother kenny good to see you this morning your son looks like he's about taller than you now so and them kids only say stay small do they sure do grow up fast amen so praise the lord so god bless you all i can't think of any announcer other announcement that i can think of so amen we don't want to keep you forever this morning but yet we want to try to express what the holy spirit's laid on our heart to speak this morning is that okay amen i trust that you've been praying for me because you know all of our song services and everything that we do all of our praying it comes down to this right here and that is for the servant of the lord to be yielded to god that he can actually speak to your heart amen and this is the part where the battle begins this is the battle part of it all and so we trust that we'll just be able to help and be in edify the body of christ amen so we'll just power heads lord jesus we come before you father this morning once again lord realizing lord jesus that this is our day this is our time father which we only have a short time here but lord we want to make the most of it father so this morning as we have assembled ourselves together in the name of jesus christ we ask god that you would keep your word father where you said wherever two or three would gather in your name there you would be in our midst lord jesus and father it is wonderful to see one another but to know that you are in army it's the most glorious thought and the most glorious thing that we can have is to have you right here lord jesus and father we do pray god that you're the same yesterday today and forever as the song that we sang lord that you would do like you did with those disciples on the road to emails father that you would speak to our hearts along the way lord may you speak to every heart this morning lord as we both yield ourselves to speak and father as those in the audience yield themselves to hear what you have to say father now speak we ask it in jesus name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will and we'll i think i'll just read about two or three scriptures amen so that we don't have to go back to it all the time and we'll just try to lay a foundation amen in matthew the third chapter matthew 3. uh okay donna you may uh make sure double sure with your headphones or whatever make sure that we are actually online amen because i know one time we for some reason when i came up began we had no sound stephen and right just no sound so we'll make sure that and amen so all right chapter 3 of matthew in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and then turn over to matthew 4 verse 17. actually let's go back to uh verse 15. the land of zebulon the land of nephthylum by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the regions of the shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand mark 16. afterwards verse 14 verse 14 16 14 afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and operated them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen over in luke 24 now notice in that last scripture that we read it said preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned but if you'll notice here that there's one thing that's left out there and that it didn't talk about repentance it didn't speak anything about repentance amen but yet we know that preaching the gospel and preaching the kingdom has to do with repentance isn't that right and that's what we're going to speak on this the help of the lord is repentance repentance just a simple little thought and we might call that the abcs of it all or just the foundation of it all but that's just what the lord laid on my heart to speak so i trust that it'll be a blessing to you luke 24 and we'll begin uh with verse 44. and he said unto them luke 25 4 verse 44. and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and of the prophets and the psalms concerning me then open to their understanding that they might understand in the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remissions of sins should be preached in his name amen among all nations beginning at jerusalem amen may god well evidence read rest and you are witness of these things and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye injured in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high amen god bless the reading of the words you can be seated this morning like i said uh last night as i've had been praying about what to speak on this word repentance came to my mind and and and so it just began to multiply amen and the lord seemed to just bless that thought and i says well you lord if that's what you want me to speak on that's what we'll speak on this morning with the help of the lord amen so we see here that uh you know there is another scripture and you know one you know baptism and repentance and the plan of salvation uh i mean it's the most important subject really there is when you think about it and that right and it's certainly a most controversial subject amongst many different groups of people a lot of people think of it different and see it different and you know and and if i might just repeat you know something that was told me this morning and as somebody saying you know the bible well you know i was told that you know the bible says if thou believest if i believe you know it doesn't really matter whether i'm baptized or not you don't really have to be baptized you know and my response was you know whether what i say isn't important and what you hear isn't important what you've been taught isn't important there's only one thing that really matters and that is what did god say about it that's only really mattered it's just what does the bible say about it i mean that's ultimately what's important it's not what i think or anybody else it's what the bible says amen amen and so we we realized one place that paul said when he was you know the the angels came and broke uh paul and silas out of jail you know and uh the policeman that was their guard was about to fall on him on his sword and kill himself because he knew it was death for him to let his prisoners escape and he's paul yelled out says don't do yourself any harm you know you know we're all here we're still here you know and that taylor asked him he says now what must i do to be saved amen and paul made this simple statement believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved amen how many knows that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved amen but it doesn't just say that in that certain place it also talks about repentance amen in that right and the remissions of sins and then it also talks about the baptism of the holy ghost when jesus come along we said you know unless a man is born again he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven again so we have the born-again issue that we have to do the doctrine of the new birth that we have to deal with and with the help of the lord if you don't mind i'd like to go into some of those things would that be all right strangely but i know we're having a baptism this morning and i said you know maybe the lord will just have us to go in that because one thing's for sure is the one desire that we have and that is that we want to be pleasing to god amen the first commandment of all commandments is that you're supposed to love the lord your god with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul and all your strength amen how many knows that's god's commandment amen that you're supposed to love him with everything that you got and that's what we want to do with the help of the lord but here he talks about that you're supposed to go and preach this gospel to every creature [Music] amen now notice the gospel preaching the gospel he didn't so go you into all the world and build churches make the nominations he said they built hospitals and all these other things he says go and preach the gospel to every creature now i'll say this that i truly believe that of everything that is done everything that we do everything that the church does still i believe the most important agenda that the church of the living god has is to preach the gospel the more important thing that we can do is to preach the gospel to every creature amen into all the world jesus said notice how he would after his resurrection amen after he comes back and he eats fish and so forth amen and then the last thing that he tells his disciples to do is to go and preach the gospel to every creature so it must be very important amen preaching the gospel is the most important thing that there is now over in the book of revelation john the revelator if you remember amen we won't get into reading it but you i think it's the fifth chapter he says you know when he found that amen that there he found that no man was worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof or to even look upon it in other words the whole plan of salvation the whole plan of redemption in other words all of humanity all right every one of us would be lost all right lost meaning that we would come to annihilation right there was no salvation for any of us there would be no salvation there would be no need of preaching the gospel if there wouldn't be somebody that would have been worthy to take the book and to open the seals amen and that would be worthy to pay the price for humanity are we glad this morning that there is somebody that was worthy because if it wouldn't have been for that worthy one amen there would be no sense in us coming to church you would be without hope amen you could not even come to repentance now the reason that i read these other scriptures about repentance is because if you'll notice the very thing that john the baptist did when he began to go and when he began to preach what was the first thing he said repent what was the first thing that jesus said when he began to preach the gospel repent repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand in other words if to repent from something is to turn around and go a different direction in other words stop you're going the wrong way how many know this world is heading headlong amen in a desperate way the wrong way you and i after we come to the age of accountability when you get to be about 12 13 maybe even younger nowadays but you'll begin to sin and you'll be able to you'll begin to do things that's wrong you'll realize that hey i have the wrong desires in my heart and i'm going the wrong way amen because until you come to this place amen of salvation isn't going to be any good for you because that's part of the plan of salvation that's the part that's part of preaching the gospel and to every creature is repent turn around amen so we see that go into all the world and jesus here clearly makes a statement of that it was christ that it was behold christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day that repentance and recimptions of sins notice your repentance and your remissions of sins should be preached in his name now let me ask you is his name father is his name son is his name holy ghost that's not his name is that right and so many people listen i've talked to people i don't know if i ever ran into one myself but there's pentecostals from what i understand because they're the ones that were supposed to get the revelation of acts 2 38 of the holy ghost and so forth and the baptism they were they were supposed to have it right but they ended up splitting into oneness twoness and trinity pentecostal trinity now that's what blows my mind how can you be pentecostal amen amen acts 2 amen and then still not understand the simplicity of matthew 28 and 18 of who the father is who the son is and who the holy ghost how could jesus possibly be still trinity but it's simply because people listen people have a certain way they see it they put a period behind what they believe and god can't deal with them anymore you put a period behind what you believe and guess what god can't deal with you anymore i've been preaching 30 years and there's more new things that god shows me all the time if i wouldn't be open for more revelation i'll tell you what i would become stagnant i'd become lukewarm amen but notice here he talks about how that and he talks about the name used name and what i wanted to say when i began to say this was this that some people will get plum upset not even come to your church amen they will just man they'll blast you to hell if you baptize in jesus name can you imagine a christian that would actually blast you to hell because you actually use the name of the lord jesus christ in baptism but he's the one that died for you he's the one that paid the price it don't take a genius to figure that out but what does it show let me tell you what it shows thomas byler it shows that they have a wrong spirit in their heart and let me tell you something you may not think it's very strong but catholicism i'll tell you what they they would kill you they would crucify you if you wouldn't do this cross embrace the cross and father son and holy is a trinity spirit it's actually a false doctrine spirit that they take and it's a hateful spirit don't get me wrong it is a hateful spirit the trinity spirit is all different people hate you if you don't believe in the trinity amen but let me tell you something but i'll tell you what we're in a whole lot of trouble if there's contradictions in here i'd rather take what jesus said than what peter said if there's a contradiction what can we really believe oh my but it isn't i'm not so thankful there is no contradiction my i'm a father amen i am a father i am a son and i am have the holy ghost but that's not my name and jesus says i want you to use the name of the father the son and the holy ghost i want you to use his name and when peter did it huh father being lord isn't that right know that the lord your god is one lord his name is is the lord the lord is the father and then jesus was the son lord jesus and christ is the holy ghost amen the lord jesus christ was perfect amen it doesn't even take a deep revelation you don't even have to have a spiritual awakening to see the baptism amen simple truth and then then you can say this that if anybody any show me anywhere anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father son the holy ghost now i got to rephrase it because even the prophet used that he said show me where anybody was baptized in the name of the father son the holy ghost that always needs to be said this way show me where they were baptized in the titles of the fathers on the holy ghost okay because if you say show me where they use the name of the fathers on the holy ghost every time they use the name of jesus christ they use the name of the father son the holy ghost they did use the name of the fathers on the holy ghost they used the name of jesus christ that's what they used but the titles of father son and holy ghost nobody ever used the titles of fathers on the holy ghost oh that's not really important then why did they say in the book of acts that there is no other name given under every whereby you must be saved not any other name is given it's not muhammad it's not all any of these others there ain't no name that you can get saved under except the name of the lord jesus christ the bible says that at the end every knee shall bow every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord that he is lord of all praise be to god all right so i didn't really mean to go in that direction but i just thought that's exactly true thinking repentance and remissions of sins should be preached in his name i am a happy man why because remissions of sins has been made available through the blood of jesus christ hallelujah aren't you glad for forgiveness i want you to know it doesn't i'm here to tell you i don't care what your condition outside of blasphemy of the holy ghost if you're still a monk in sin if you still have a heart that's not right with god this morning i believe there is mercy for you the day is coming when there won't be but i believe there's mercy for you this morning whatever your condition is outside of the blasphemy of the holy ghost if you're not what you ought to be praise be to god amen amen sister riva good to see you amen i met your husband he's a good man i really appreciate him gotten to know him the last few weeks i've gotten to be friends but i did i said well what about your wife have you got a wife he says yeah i got wife's history when he told me how good he was amen but anyway so praise the lord all right now think about this so he says repentance and remissions of sin should be preached in his name beginning where at jerusalem oh my we're going to go to jerusalem we know that they were in the upper room or in that right in the upper room and they were waiting for the baptism of the holy ghost came amen and it says that you know that you're the post supposed to wait there until you receive power from on high verse eight if chapter one says and you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and judea and in the other most parts of the earth now we realize that the whole pentecostal world was based on acts 2 amen and starting with verse 1 when the whole the pandey penny was cost was fully come they were in one place they were in one accord oh my i wanted you to know i absolutely believe that god could if he could bind us together with such unity even this morning i believe that even jesus's presence the holy ghost could come down here just like he did back then it is not just about a a god of history but it's a god of now if your heart will get right if my heart will get right god will come and he'll bring this place amen and many times i've heard of services where can holy ghost come so great until the place becomes smokey made a place this morning becomes smoky amen just may there be licks of fire may there be a pill of fire come among us if you can get your heart right get your mind right he didn't want a cart but that's what it'll take folks we're not just here to hear a preacher preach you're not just here to warm up here we're here to worship the lord our god that made us that give us breath that give us life and i believe that as time goes on the true elect people of god you'll draw closer to him closer to him we're not getting further away from god we want to get closer to god like brother david said i want a closer walk with him oh my i guarantee you the one thing you'll take out of every one of us is repentance that's right repentance repentance you're going one direction you need to stop going that way because let me tell you something there's only two ways in this world there's only two ways jesus says there's one that leads to destruction it's real white and there'll be many that go in there out there's a lot of people going the broadway yeah but the later way of life is a narrow way and it says and there be few that find it there's a few on this narrow path let me tell you what the broad way is you know what the broad way is the broad way it way is your way your way two ways one is your way and one is god's way amen two way directions now i want to say this let me tell you what hell is going to be full of hell is going to be full of people who want it to go their way but they still wanted salvation they also wanted god's way attached to their way huh they want to mix it up they want it both ways well i still want to do what i want to do but i want to be saved i want the holy ghost i want to be a christian but i still want to do this and i want to do that and i think that the bible means this and the bible meant that and this side or the other huh no it don't work that way because i want to tell you something the bible says that he deceiveth the whole world except for those who have their names written on the book of life from the foundation of the world see the devil is a deceiver and that's what the world is going to be mostly done by and that is they're going to be deceived they're going to think that what they're doing is right the way that they're going is right but it's going to be the wrong way amen when i begin to think about going the wrong direction now begin to think about how that it's basically it's like being on that river that comes down to the niagara falls and every one of us is on that river all right and we're all headed towards the niagara falls no way for you to survive all right and you've got a boat all right and you're going down there and you're floating down there and you're just having a good time the sun's shining everything's nice you got your little zipcode you're just a fish in the way you're enjoying life this is nice life is good and then there's somebody on the bank says hey you better be careful the falls is just up ahead huh and that's the preacher telling hey guess what you're gonna come down to the deathbed one of these days you're gonna come down to that far you're gonna come down to the place where i mean can you get on your desk all we can do is send you hospice huh coming down to hospice if time terrors you understand the rapture don't take place and you know you're not going to think about how much money you make you probably won't even think too much about your eye for your children you might be concerned about whether they're taken care of but your focus is not going to be on the things of this world anymore your thought is going to be i'm going to meet jesus jesus are you going to be here for me because they can't go with me i got to go by myself here this is a journey i got to make by myself i'm coming down to this place where i draw my wrath path what happens after that huh you see what would i what would you do this morning brother john if i told you brother john i'm dying i found out yesterday i'm dying what would you all think if i told you better i'm not very long doctor says i'm dying huh but you know that's exactly what i am that's exactly what you are i'm a dying man talking to a dying people huh so you see when you come to the house of god how many please this is a serious thing this morning is as serious as you being on your deathbed because that's what we're getting ready for we're getting ready for what's over on the other side we're not thinking about a job we're not thinking about we're finding out where are you at with god where are you amen tremendous place to be so you find a man on the shore calling you better watch out he says oh i'm okay i'm okay and the man on the river the preacher on the river side on the banks looks and guess what you have on your boat you're in a boat and guess what you have on your boat you've got a 200 horse mercury let's say 250 i like the big ones don't you 250 mark i'm telling you what it's fuel injected you hit that start button huh put that throttle on [Music] yeah that's why i'm up huh and all of a sudden you're going down he says that you only have a quarter of a mile you better crank that end it up and turn it around and the person on the boat says i don't know i've never used that engine i don't believe it'll run what would you do no no no crank it up you better try it try it you better you better crank up cause you got very long now i got my paddle here i got my paddle i got my weight let me do it my way just shut up i got my paddle i roll with huh that's what people are doing god will come and he'll discern the thoughts and intents of the heart he'll do miracles after miracles and that's just nothing doesn't mean anything to people anymore huh the woman that do well i'd love to hear the woman at the well when god did that in our generation hundreds and thousands of times but people will ignore it go ahead go away but god is calling you know and and guess what you say look you better you better turn around you're going the wrong way you're headed for the fall but see that kind of fall is eternal separation from god let's go to it's to go to a place that you'll call god help me you'll call mom dad god help me and there's no god there eternal separation from god and violation after the throne judgment so what does the preacher do well i tried to tell him i guess i'll go back up to my picnic they're just floating on down just let them go i told them they're going to crash you can't stand that far i told you to try to crank that engine up turn around repent repent ah no we don't go back to the picnic what do we do we run down the along the banks look come on please wake up you got it you got to turn around you got to repent you got to go a different direction you can't go your way it leads to destruction there's a way that seems right unto a man at the end they're aware of is death amen you're going you know and all you got to do is look i see the engine turn the key a little bit see the lights come on he turns the key i see light but i don't think it'll start i don't believe it huh what will happen to that man if you don't take faith if you don't believe he'll go off let me tell you something that 250 mark amen that is called faith amen that little engine is called faith if thou canst believe he that believeth shall be saved and then he that takes the key and turns it amen if let begin to say god i believe your word i believe your word i believe every word that's the problem today if people don't believe every word and jesus said man shall not live by portion of the word that you want to take no but man shall live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god should a man live by amen i don't care what part of this salvation forgiveness a pardon how many believes that this book is a pardon from almighty god whosoever believeth shall be saved that's the everybody didn't have your name or anybody else's name now god wrote your name down because he knew what to do with it or whether he wouldn't that's how he could write your name on the book before the foundation of the world because he's infinite he knows everybody that had had that desire that would want it he knew he knows those who wouldn't care see kane let me talk to you about cain for a minute cain was the kind of guy that wanted his own way but yet he wanted salvation or he never had a church cain had a beautiful church he brought flowers he brought sacrifices and he made the altar call and then he had altar called he had all kinds of things at the altar for sacrifice sure he wanted to be right but he still wanted his own way he was a religious man that's the way people are today people they want god they want to go to church they want to feel right sure but they still want to have their own way amen they want to take their cigarettes with them they want to take their drugs with them they want to take their lusts with them they want to all kinds of things they don't want to repent amen repentance amen repentance now before i go into my main thought i want to go to um let me see here acts 2 i guess it is because we will talk about the new birth for just a minute repentance and the new birth because you know how many knows that repentance is truly what leads you to the new birth so many people don't want to repent but they want the holy ghost they don't want to repent if they're wrong and so forth but they still want to be saved and you can't you got to be willing to repent and turn around it takes a turning around acts 2 now we know that peter had the keys of the kingdom in that right i give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven and here he is unlocking the door amen and peter of course after they were baptized with the holy ghost because you're not really willing let me tell you can we just go slow here you're not really ready to be a witness for christ until you get the bad baptism of the holy ghost because we could talk about hey you need the baptism the holy ghost what if i was up here and didn't have the baptism and holy ghost well you know it would just be sad wouldn't it yes it would but you have to have the power let me tell you something one thing that the holy ghost does it gives you the power to become the sons of god it gives you the power to be a witness and so they had gotten the holy ghost and then they went outside amen and this is where actually the pentecost let me just say this this is where the pentecostals make their mistake is acts 2 and verse 4. now that's their theme scene scripture he says and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave to motherings now you wasn't really a member of the church you wasn't really a pentecostal you weren't really born again to them unless you had that speaking in tongues they honed down and says unless a person or when a person does speak in tongues it is the evidence they got the holy ghost that's what they made they made actually a church doctrine out of it amen everybody knows they honed down and says that's the evidence of the holy ghost oh read verse 4 let's see if it reads that and verse 5 says then this is the evidence that you are born again no i didn't read anything like that it's just that they and other places listen the other places they they were speaking in tongues many places they did speak in tongues but speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost amen it is believing the word of god that's what the evidence is amen now so we'll not go too much on that but listen that's where they made the mistake was to to actually indoctrinate and come up with a thought that the bible never said because as we know the prophet said man he's seen witch doctors take infants go up and let them speak and unknown tongues interpret it and drink blood out of the humans call and they were speaking in tongues why did they have the holy ghost no they didn't hello that's not the evidence of the holy ghost it could happen speaking in tongues there's nothing wrong with speaking in tongues amen so he got filled with the fire peter preached we're not going to go through all of that but he went and preached a great message to all of the israelites okay and then at the end of his message in verse around verse 36 peter says in the ending he says you know therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god has made all right god has made this same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ amen that's why we say he's the lord jesus is lord lord of all and christ he's the anointing now notice then when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren how long do we have to go and and go to some instruction class for about six months that what he said which i watched people say you know because we want to make sure we never baptize somebody that ain't really dedicated i don't want to either we want to make sure that whoever's repenting but guess what that's not in your power amen you don't unless you can read minds unless you know that way hey i know if this person's genuine sincere or whether they're not and guess what i guess peter would have been pretty busy because three thousand souls to baptize in one day it had been busy counseling and i like to consult with somebody see how sincere they are but listen he says men and brethren what shall we do peter said unto them join church just believe that's all you need to do no he said repent first thing you've got to do if you want to serve god is turn from all your wicked ways amen you gotta it's it's part of this repentance is part of dying to yourself that's why a new purse is placed taking place you are dying to your thoughts your ideas your life god is fixing to buy you because you're selling you're selling out to god you're selling your everything to god you're repenting of everything say god i don't want to think my thoughts i want you to have control of my life anything that's wrong lord shall make and i'll do right am i right repent turn around every one of you has to turn around quit doing the things that you're doing and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive what the third part of the plan of salvation amen repent believe and get filled with the holy ghost you're not really complete without all three you have to repent you have to make a public confession that you believe the lord jesus christ and you're giving your heart and life to the lord by water baptism amen because i'll tell you what how many knows it's the blood of jesus christ that paid for your sins you mean some people think that when you that the actual water cleanses you huh the actual water doesn't cleanse you that's just an outward showing it's just one of the few things that god has asked us to do such as foot washing amen to communion and the baptism that's what he asked us to do amen be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the holy ghost brother bam coming in contact with a lot of people who says brother branham we just speak where the bible speaks we're silent when the bible's silent but we're here to tell you that the ones that ever got the baptism the holy ghost with the 12 disciples now all i know is the man must not have read his bible a whole lot isn't that right because you go to acts 10 amen the house of cornelius everybody got filled with the holy ghost over in acts 19 amen paul talking to those disciples they got baptized with the holy ghost a lot of people are more than he says well look what about that and they try to say that the holy ghost isn't really for today it was just for back there how many knows that's all false doctrine i'm here to tell you when jesus said that many false prophets many false christs shall arise and deceive many it was absolutely the truth anybody that speaks to you contrary to this is a false teacher amen it's a false prophet it's a false christ remember this brother bannon when he went beyond the curtain of time and he's seen all of those the converts of history out of this generation amen and and so forth and when he reached over there he says are these all my converts and so forth and the angel said and brother man says i want to see jesus he says you can't see him he's higher up but before you get to see him you're going to have to be judged on what you preached every leader will be judged on what he preached how many knows that's why i tried to just say what and he said what paul did and i can go right back this is what we teach right here the body of the bible if brother branham didn't teach something out of the bible it's wrong but listen and listen and he says you know what he said my brother ram says i'm gonna have to be judged for what i preached he says well he has the angel well will paul have to be judged for what he preached and the angel said yes he will and the man says well praise be to god hallelujah we're going to be okay because i just preached what paul preached and those millions of souls that he seen over there all yelled out we are resting on that we're resting on that that you preach what paul preached not what somebody you know everybody every one of us has a thought that's why there's so many different denomination churches is because everybody has an idea everybody has a thought and you follow that thought follow that idea it'll split this church up quicker than what you can shake a stick that's why all the divisions are out there because people go with their ideas that's why pentecost failed the absolute devil got in amongst them and one and became a trinity and one thought they split over church things because one thought that god was coming on the white horse as he talks about him coming from the heavens of heaven on a white horse and others say no he went up in there's a cloud and he'll come back and say you're wrong i'm going to go over here and start my own church boy that's about as weak as the broth of a chicken of the shadow of a chicken that starved to death come on folks that's not but the devil gets in between our little bitty differences we gotta come back to the word of god how many please we gotta come back to the word of god cause that's our foundation there's nothing no other foundation lead than the foundation of the word of god amen praise the lord so we see here he says and you shall receive the baptism of the holy ghost how does the new birth come in here then how do you say well brother balor if you're going to be saved you're going to have to have the new birth because jesus said so that's exactly right let's go see what jesus said when nicodemus in the third chapter of john came to him at night he says unto him rabbi we know that there are a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him oh my the bible says that they'll come in that day and say heaven we cast out devils haven't we done this that or the other jesus will reply depart from me ye that work iniquity you know to do better but you didn't those are the kind of people that jesus is going to turn aside when you know that you ought to do better but you don't nicodemus and those rulers nicodemus confess we know that you're from god because nobody could do this unless they were of god but we're still not going to accept it even though we know to do better huh they confess it didn't he except god be with him and jesus answered and said on him verily verily i say unto you except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven and of course nicodemus said can a man go back into his mother's womb a second time jesus says verily verily ex i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit amen how many believes you've got to have the holy ghost to be saved amen the holy spirit has to come down into your soul amen not just on your flesh not just on your body but down into the outermost parts of your soul and change your very nature what did paul say about it paul said in the eighth chapter of romans he says but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his how may believes that praise the lord and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your more mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you well that's what we need more of is the quickening power of the holy ghost in our life to bring us to life amen how many knows that when jesus christ accepts your repentance this is the difference between the holy ghost receiving the holy ghost or not receiving the holy ghost because in the old testament if you'll notice that sacrifice that they had and they brought had to be without blemish and the sacrifice that you bring to god is god here i am i repent of all of my own ideas my own thoughts that sacrifice that you make has to be acceptable almighty god when he accepts your faith that i believe in you lord i give you my life amen he will confirm that he has accepted your faith that your engine has started hello and he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire you can push that throttle down and say i'm not on that direction no more i'm heading towards life praise be to god and he comes and baptizes you and you get born again and i believe it was the scripture he says if if you then be risen in christ set your affections on things above and not on things below man for you are dead and your life is hid in christ through christ jesus i'm glad to have that your life is hid in christ when you get the baptism of the holy ghost i truly believe that's the only plan of salvation is through the cross of jesus christ through the remission of your sins comes amen remissions of sins comes by your repentance and your faith in the lord jesus christ and by giving him your all not part but every bit of yourself amen revelations the first chapter if you want to go with me there is amen repentance let's look at a couple more things on repentance revelations 2. revelations 2 and we're talking about the first church age here which is the ephesian church which started 50 years after the day of pentecost isn't it something in it strange that time wasn't even recorded in that time frame it starts at 53 because it had the pure word of god undefiled the way it was supposed to be for a little while and then according to verse 5 or verse 4 they've had patience they had labored they had not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love they went down into dark ages remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent amen and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and remove a candlestick out of its place that first church they had simply gotten away from god and what did they have to do it talks about how that their fervent desire to please god amen not their desire to please the world or the neighbor but their desire to please god they love god with all of their heart mind soul and strength and that began to fade away i wonder how many sitting here this morning that could actually say you know there was a time in my life where i was a lot closer to god than i am now then what the spirit say to you the spirit tells you repent there's only one thing to do don't keep going the direction that you're going turn around do something different how many noses us older folks especially we get set in our ways we're like steel i mean that you know it's it's shaped and it's formed and then it hardens and when that still hardens it just stays right in that position that's how a lot of folks are we have habits we have ways that we do things and we never change them yet i believe the holy spirit speaks to us and he tells us hey you know you need to do that a little different than what you do you shouldn't be doing it that way huh this goes deep because i want to hear i'm here to tell you something that as we go into layout of cih over in the layout of ch the last church age which we'll go ahead and read the last church age which we are which is where we are unto the angel of the of laodiceans right he thinks saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god 3 and 14 15 now and i know that works at thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou art cold or hot how many believe the lord really loves to have a real close relationship with you he just doesn't like this mediocre relationship with us he wants you to be hot for god he wants you to be on fire for god amen but because thou art lukewarm and folks i'm here to tell you that's the age we're living in can i tell you what comes to my mind and heart of why we are because we used to be able to read our bibles isn't that right three four hours a day we used to i've heard of people being able to pray all night long just feasting on the word and i'll be absolutely honest i'm getting to where i love to read more and i like to study more and more and more and more because our minds are on the things of this world so much that's why we're in the condition because our minds are somewhere else the devil's got us so busy with everything else that we don't have time to really get down and fellowship with god fellowship with the holy spirit because you know that god did all of this for one reason and that is to have fellowship with you and me that's what he did it for so he can have fellowship with us and he desires to have fellowship with us on a daily basis but we're so concerned with the things of the world i'm too concerned with the things of the world to have a three-hour prayer time to have a 15 20 30 minutes almost how many would confess i i'm gonna have to repent i'm gonna have to take back time amen with my i want to get i got to get back to the place where i love to read the word i want to get back to the place that i read this bible and oh my i didn't see that before because how many knows that without the holy ghost this doesn't do a lot of good it takes the holy spirit in your heart to read this when it feeds on this because it's the only thing the holy spirit feeds on is the word of god amen you can't happen i just love this but the devil's got it tricked by stealing all our time and then when you find that the love that you once had for the lord isn't what it should be your walk with the lord isn't what it used to be amen not cold or hot but i because you're not been because you're lukewarm i'll spew thee out of my mouth what a horrible feeling what a terrible feeling when you've wandered so far away from god that you don't really even feel him anymore it's a horrible place to be the age which you are and i are living now is rich and increased with goods remember go over in revelations the 18th chapter and he talks about that woman where all the world is made rich through the abundance of her delicacies hello all her goods all these goods everything all the good little things that we have it's all owned by the devil all the things we listen to this we drive the best cars we wear the best clothes we eat the best food we live in the best places let me ask you this what about our spiritual prayer that's where we need to be rich what was it the prophet said he says you see we take a bath once a week and we'd pray every day and that right we was have decent shape we might have stunk a little bit on the outside but we were sweet and kind to each other and we waved to each other on the road we shake each other's sand we greet each other in the marketplace but now we take a bath twice a day and we got the biggest farm and we just walked right on by everybody don't pay attention to nobody huh we might stink on the inside and smell good on the outside i believe prayer changes things how many knows how many would say i need a closer walk with god and after this morning i am determined i'm going to repent and i'm going to ask god to help me turn change the direction that you're going you have to change something how many with me this morning you could look at your life and could honestly say lord not only do i need to but i promise you this morning to make some changes all you need to raise your hand remember do it don't just raise your hand do it make some changes because you'll never get different results if you keep doing the same thing over again amen that means you're crazy i don't want to preach no crazy people amen to work you know to think you're going to differ different results praise the lord how many know i just lord help us not only does the sinner need to repent not only does the world need to repent this message is still the gospel is still repent or perish to the world repent or perish before i don't say this let me go into another avenue for just a little bit because there was a voice that came out of heaven and screamed in revelations 18 come out of her my people come out of denominational systems come out of man-made systems amen come and join yourself to meet the word of god i'll come and i'll prove myself alive like never before oh my so that you can know it's the truth but you've got to get out of those man-made systems because they're going over the fall they're not going to make the rapture let alone be in heaven when the truth is presented before you you turn it down you remember you separate yourself from god right there when you know something's the truth and you won't do it you separate yourself from god he knows your heart he'll play it back on the day of pen on the day of judgment amen so he has cried out to he says pentecost pentecost how god would have hovered you but you would not amen he says now you're dead he cried out to the churches in this generation repent turn around from the direction you're going you're your man-made systems they're just barnyards that's whole thing people but the egos come up higher come on up come out of the man-made system come out of something that thomas bottler might teach you that's contrary to the word come away from any other man that will teach you something that's contrary to the word because your very life depends on it jesus came in this generation he proved himself alive so much more than when he was here on earth amen he walked the shores of galilee world over 500 000 in india and africa challenged the buddha that seeks to change all of them says you come and open this blind man's eyes and i'll follow your religion but if the lord jesus christ will i proclaim and say that he's not dead but he is alive and he's here and he's proven himself he'll heal up in his eyes will you accept the lord as your savior amen let me tell you and upon that the world will burn that rejects it and does not believe the lord jesus christ you don't believe what jesus did in disgeneration you do not believe jesus amen because remember whatever you do with jesus today is what you'd have done it with him back then amen how many believes the church world needs to repent america needs to repent but they're not gonna prophet already proclaimed that she won't repent there's only one thing left for her and that is fire she's gonna burn amen but there's still individuals in churches god's children are still in those churches that god is still calling to come out come out and meet me at midnight there was a cry given come me out to meet the bridegroom come out of denominational systems come out my man made things repent amen notice he's talking to the church they're rich they're increased with goods and they don't think that they need anything they're in good shape they feel like they're okay um notice it says that they're wretched if verse 17 follow me and i'm skipping a few words because i'm bringing in on the back part of this they're wretched they're miserable they're poor and they're blind now back to the beginning of that and it says and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked imagine a person out there miserable blind walking around in the streets naked wretched miserable poor dirty filthy just miserable just horrible naked and you go up and tell him hey don't you know you don't have any clothes on no don't leave me alone my church don't teach that huh i'm fine it says they don't know it they don't even know their condition that's the worst part is that they don't even realize it how many knows many are going to go into the tribulation period and our government and all governments of the world they're propelling this one world government you can believe that and it'll soon come to where the bribe will be pushed out hello the tribulation will be sitting there there'll be a lot of people that'll go into that tribulation period thinking that they wouldn't be there but you and i can't take a chance as christians i don't want to take no chance say god search my heart i preached a message here the other week and talking about how that we have got to search our soul all the way down to the inner world let the holy spirit come and search your soul and see if there's any ways in there that are unlike god because we were so prone to deceiving ourselves it's easy to deceive yourself make you think you're okay when you're not these people deceive themselves why because they thought they were okay they thought they were rich they were increased youth good god's blessed me with a great business god bless me with that god bless me with this that or the other and let me tell you something i got to go a little further can you hang in with me this morning i feel like this is of the lord and i believe we need it everyone here how many knows i believe everybody there is here this morning god meant for you to be here this is what i'm preaching i didn't know what i was going to preach until during the night last night i said lord i don't know what you want me to preach but i've always just relied on you that's where he brought this this simple thought that we need to repent god is calling and he's trying to do let me tell you god is trying to do a detailed work on his people because we're fixing to get out of here folks jesus is fixing to come and he is coming down into every one of our lives and to ask us are you really in love with god like you should be how many wants to know if you're really in love with god this is my next my next part before we go into the baptism turn to saint john with me a couple scriptures that gear us and tell us whether we're really in love with god like we should be and what god tells us that we're going to do if you really love him because people think that they can do whatever they want to do and still call themselves christians believe what you want to believe no you better come god's way because it's like jesus said the wise man built his house upon a rock and he talks about the wise man that builds his house upon the rock is the guy that actually doeth the will of god not his own will but does god's will obeys what god said do saint john 14 and 13 14-13 let me see where we're at now i want you to understand this this is also going to be an answer to your question of why god don't answer your prayers has anybody ever had wondered lord why don't you answer my prayers lord it seems like i asked this but i didn't get it i i have you you know y'all are holier than i am then this morning if you don't have that lord i i've asked that it didn't seem like i got it lord what did i do wrong where did i miss it sure because i don't know about you but i'd like for the lord to answer my prayers i don't want to ask him this so he starts with verse 13 whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son how many knows god really wants to work miracles among us because it only does one thing in that it really brings honor and glory to the name of jesus christ sure it does so ask anything in my name and i will do it and then he says but if you love me keep my commandments last week in different places i heard brother says you know abraham he went out there and he didn't leave his father and my brother you know at home and like he was told to do and he never really was fully blessed until he fully obeyed god he makes a statement i truly believe it's true you'll never really be fully blessed until you fully obey god what he said do and you can't really say that you love him properly unless you do what god said there and i'll tell you what okay so there's one scripture if you love me keep my commandments saint john 13 34 he also says a new commandment i give you that ye love one another amen how many believes that if you truly love god that you'll love one another you'll love people people are the hardest things to love they really are and it takes the holy ghost for you to love somebody that's going to smack you on the cheek we are so full of mistakes in that right every one of us even as friends amongst friends a lot of times we hurt each other but you got to love enough to forgive love enough to say i'm sorry huh we're complicated but yet he says do the hardest thing there is to do and love one another and he can only do that by the holy ghost as i have loved you love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another there's another way let's look at another one in first john i believe it is way back in first john my my my i'm rushing here and we're going to leave off some potatoes and beans that we could be eating on so anyway i may pick it up if the holy spirit keeps me in mind okay because i want to go back to revelations just as a finale during revelations about that church age um in first john three there's many scriptures here that's really good also first john three actually let's start with chapter two first john in verse 3. hereby know we that we know him how many wants to know that you know i know that i know it all right hereby know that we know him if we keep his commandments he did say it i know him and keepeth not his commandments is it what that's right they're a liar because anybody that really loves the lord wants to do what he tells you to do how many believes that and the truth is not even in him how many knows that when you have the love of god in your heart you got the holy ghost you love church you love to assemble yourselves together you love to praise the lord give him honor and glory you'd love to come down and come 30 minutes early and get on your knees and say god if i've done anything wrong lord forgive me lord and anoint the preacher to say and say what i have need of hearing let me ask you this if god spoke to you this morning do you feel like that request was honored that god will actually speak to hearts if we're just listen amen all right that's right and the truth is not him over another another scripture in 3 21 will begin actually you know when it comes to ask what you will but keep my commandments you'll find it in chapter 3 verse 21. yeah beloved if our heart condemn us not be confidence towards god how many believe you really need to search your heart make sure that you can have confidence towards god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight how many knows enoch was trained translated the bible says and enoch was not amen for he walked with god and he had this testimony and that is that he plea your pastor this morning is to say if you're not walking every day with him like you should god give you that walk with god and may everything you do be pleasing to god i believe when you walk like that i believe that's what you can ask and god will honor what you ask for amen in closing i want to cap it off with revelations the third chapter of the layout of ci age i didn't quite finish that they're miserable poor blind and naked in verse 18 he says i counsel thee the buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment how many knows that white raiment is only one thing and that is when the holy spirit comes into your heart he forgives you of all of your sins and the very life that was in jesus comes into your heart that's the only righteousness that we have that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint the eyes with thyself that you can actually see the condition that you're in how many believes it's a blessing when god shows you that you're not what you ought to be thank you lord for showing me where i'm not where i ought to be because man i could have just went right on there and be lost but he shows you where you're not where you ought to be he gives you eyes have to be able to see it and then after he says all of this gives them all their conditions and so forth he says now as many as i love i rebuke and chasten amen somebody said about the prophet of god he says why are you always rebuking people and and hammering on this and hammering on that why are you always doing that this is why because love is corrective love is corrective if the lord loves you he's going to rebuke you when you feel like ah preacher's stepping on my well that's good thank the lord somebody cares about you otherwise i say it doesn't matter how y'all live just believe the lord jesus christ you'll be saved huh throw me out of my head brother steve it's a lie don't just do how you want just say you believe no live for the lord with all your heart amen as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore be diligent be zealous and say it with me repent be zealous and repent say god help me the seal listen the zeal to serve god in this hour is for you to turn around from any way that is unlike god and that is displeasing to god amen praise the lord we're thankful that god still touches hearts like sister donna back there that wants to give her heart to the lord wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ want to give her her all amen but you know we're going to baptize her in the name of the lord jesus christ but what about before we do that let's talk about just what about the rest of us that just really need a closer walk and realize i have some things i need to repent of i need to turn around from some of my ways when i hear of uh church's message churches folks that have not had any services hardly at all since last march for over a year message church is closing up who'd have thought i thought only denominational churches close up because there's not really anything coming anymore huh let me tell you when that happens he better come back quick or there won't be any faith left upon the earth somebody don't love the lord like they ought to that's right i don't know about you but i'd find me a church somewhere to go to i want everybody to know i love the lord isn't that right because you've got the holy ghost brother brahm says you can't wait for them doors to open he said you can't they can't chain you out of the door you're gonna be there i want my brother's sister so no i love the lord huh you don't come for a month of sundays and so forth don't try to tell me you love the lord your action shows you don't because if you i love the lord you're going to love your brothers and sisters you're going to be doing everything for the kingdom of god that you can because i'm here to tell you this world and the goods of this world it's all going to pass away it isn't going to matter it's only what you have done for christ the way you have lived for him that's going to make a difference you love him i know your hearts and i was kind of burdened but listen the holy spirit i would just want god to keep speaking to our heart are you all up there in the balcony is that good for you y'all enjoy the holy spirit speaking to you how many just wants a closer walk with god how many will say lord search my heart of god see if there be any wicked way in me lord how can i get closer to you lord how can i empty out more how can i repent more so that more of you can be in me lord show me and then when i go about monday guess what where i used to just get up and i wouldn't pray or read my i'm going to start reading my bible when i come home from work i'm going to make it my my my main love of my life is going to be to read god's word to pray and to have a fellowship with him rather than worrying so much about my job i'm going to make some changes in my life amen can i just say what comes to mind dog business we have a little dog business and it's so easy to you know people say hey can i meet you on sunday morning troy knows all about this probably can i meet you sunday morning or sunday afternoon decided i'm so sorry you'll have to come on monday or something i know you gotta you gotta schedule around you gotta say god here because you'll be so busy and everybody else in that different bed you'll get so busy with something i don't have time for church i don't have time to come to the house of god trick of the devil and i'm here to tell you so many times the holy spirit will speak what the church has need of and people aren't there and they'll never hear it and he'll grow on in darkness amen i believe it's important folks that we as christians we have need to repent to amen repentance because that's how you get the remission of your sins that's how you change let the fire of the holy ghost ah i can't hardly quit but you know the only way that you can take that steel that's been molded and that's hard the only thing that'll reshape that steel those ways that you have that just don't change that need to be changed it's the sweetness and the fire of god to come down and soften you up make you soft for god say god i didn't realize i was that way but i am lord lord reshape me mold me change me lord amen me and my son were coming back from missouri the other day and we went to buy a little dog oh my about waiting to buy a little dog for caleb and we got over there brother steve and we ended up coming back with five all right but anyway i was we went five hours one way and i told the lady i said see you got any others that you might sell might be ready to go he said well i got these two mamas that are ready to go you know and you know how it is they've gone you got a mama and it was a real cheap prize i said yeah we'll take them also you know and we got over there i changed my mind about the one and so forth but anyway we ended up finding four met all four and we was heading back and it was snowing the worlds were white almost dark before we were even leaving west plains coming back and as we were going down the highway we looked i looked on the side of the road and there was a little dog a beagle dog and i knew something was bad wrong he had his back end laid down he had just his front end up like that almost he was standing beside in a nice swale ditch over there beside the highway and i said there's a dog he's hurt he's got to be hurt he wouldn't just be in that snow he'll freeze to death caleb says go on dad don't you stop let him die he ain't your problem though i says no way i said i can't do it i can't see a beagle there's in the snow freezing to death and not having compassion not having enough love to stop for him and so he stopped and he had gotten hit poor thing showed in the snow kind of where he had breakfast back in or whatever and he was over there and he let me come over there talk to him and pick him up and i looked at the back leg and right where his foot goes out like be our ankle i guess he was just straight sideways i kind of picked it up and it was just felt pretty bad but you know we put him in the back of the truck we still had room in the back yeah we still had room that's why i said five not this four but you know you would normally think just let it go you know but i believe it's the holy spirit god in your heart just doesn't matter what it is you have compassion you have love i mean how many beliefs you really want to be soft we want to be have that tenderness about our hearts so anyway we ended up bringing him home because the owner of the of the he had a tag and a phone number he says man i haven't seen that dog for seven you haven't had any for seven years and no idea who's he was and what it was but he needed help so we brought him back and so he's at the vet now we prayed for him the vet says look his leg is broke so bad it's sideways completely sideways attendants are probably torn best thing for me to do is come all the way up and cut the whole leg off i says i can't do that doc i says i may have to put him down i don't know but i'm trusting the lord and i'm just giving the lord a chance to heal him and i believe it can be done don't you and i said let's put a splint on it he says give me a few days and he knew it was a charity thing and he saw yeah you know he said he's gonna have it a few days for maybe i know what he's i know the doctor and i know he's gonna go in there and do whatever he can to try to help help that poor thing because whether or not that egg really works right good or not probably determine his future so but i'm just praying you know it'll all have mercy on him amen but just to see something like that then i see think about the world think about people that are not saved and they don't know what it's like to walk with the lord they don't know what it's like to be born again at 20 years old like i was in a 59 to love him more than ever and still want a closer walk and and people out there you know we had a friend of ours that we grew up with i guess caleb and the different ones they knew him pretty good chester the young man about 24 years old amen and he had tattoos everywhere and and he was in nashville and he went was crossing the road of somebody we knew well you remember chester money have you heard about chester that he actually passed away but he was going across him he got hit by a car you know and he was on life support i guess and his neck broke but you know he didn't make it i was like you think about where he might be you know if he wasn't right with the lord at that young of age you know where we know that when you pass over there's no more no more trying that anymore this is the hour this is the time to be ready and to make ready amen and you feel so bad say lord jesus i sure hope somehow or other he made things right before he passed away but it was certainly a certain sudden thing but listen of all the times and all the ages that has come and gone by here you and i are this is our time this is when we live for the lord how many say lord help me to do the best i can with the short life that i have i want to give god my all amen that's my heart said our lord lose me live for you keep me tenderhearted but i can have love and sweetness and kindness and understanding amen keep me moldable lord mold me help me to believe all your word god bless you we'll change the order to serve us here amen if uh i won't read any scriptures anymore because we already went through all of that so we'll just change the order service if you'll stand with me let's have a word of prayer lord jesus we come before you father and i pray right now god every heart and every hand that was raised that they want to make a change they feel that there is a change that needs to be made in their life to make more room for you to need to repent of perhaps simple thing as time lord being taken away from them to where they don't have that relationship with you like they should we ask god do you forgive us lord for we've not walked with you like we should lord we're not as hot as what we should be lord we don't love you as much as what we should fathom we ask god that you give us a deeper love for you father a greater dedication and we repent lord jesus of all of our wrong this morning and ask god that you'll saturate our heart our soul our families and our children how they would feel the presence of god lord upon moms and upon dads and they would say dad i want what you got mom i want what you got whatever it is that you got i want it maybe be that salty father to our neighbors and to those who work for us or who those who are around us lord we ask god that you'll just bless each and every one this morning we do thank you for this wonderful time this is the best two hours that we have spent all week lord is to be in your house with your people talking about you and the great grace and love that you have for us lord and as we change the order to service now we ask you a blessed our sister and she gives her heart to you lord jesus and that you'll baptize baptizer with the baptism of the holy ghost as she believes and she repents of all of her sins in jesus name we ask it amen and amen you can be seated if all those that
