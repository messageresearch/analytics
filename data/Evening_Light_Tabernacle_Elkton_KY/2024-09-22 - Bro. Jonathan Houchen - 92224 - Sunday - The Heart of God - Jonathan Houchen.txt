in his house again this morning just want to thank brother berer again for the opportunity to stand before you thank you musicians enjoyed the the the service last night brother Tommy that was the testimony was outstanding if you call it a testimony seemed a little bit like a a sermon going on there but uh I enjoyed it it was very good uh and then brother Thomas gets up behind him it's always it's always great to get up behind uh a brother that's taking his time and your time and uh you know but uh that was okay it was it was great the uh uh it was it was really really good I've been struggling I kept going back and forth on what am I what am I going to speak on what am I going to speak on and and uh you know I know we we joke about this you know as as ministers and things of you know just coming out to the pull pit still not even sure what I'm going to what I'm going to speak on and but it's a serious thing thing it's not something to be taken lightly I believe there's there's Souls at stake and as brother Tommy made a comment I I'm not here to play church I believe he sent me here I believe he ordained this moment before the foundation of the world for a reason and so it puts pressure to make sure you get out of your way his way and and not pick something wrong not get in front of him but just with brother Tommy started out and he was on this sermon and then he was on this sermon and then he was on this sermon on this sermon but he started targeting in on one and then when brother Thomas got up it was pretty clear what I was supposed to preach so just going to try to take the thought that they were going with and just keep going with it but uh you all pray for me as as we uh work through this and um we're going to start in uh Genesis 3:15 we're going to read about four scriptures here and then I'll let you sit down you know I was in um I think it's been about a month ago Sarah and I went to West Palm Beach and I don't know if you guys know brother Jack Duff or not but he's there in West Palm West Palm Beach and just a a really really good brother if you ever if you're ever down there make sure to stop in but a it's a it's a black church and uh so my when I travel to West Palm Beach I normally kind of amp the dressing up a little bit to try to keep up with my brothers from West Palm Beach I'm not toned down nearly as much there as I am here today and uh um but I mean those Brothers know how to dress you know so so uh as I'm there there's another brother there in Buon Beach that he had asked me to minister and I had only brought one outfit and uh it wasn't something that I would typically preach in but I walked into brother Jean's office there in Boon Beach and I told him I said brother I said I only brought one outfit I said I hope this is okay and I thought his answer was so perfect brother Thomas he looked at me he said I don't care how you're dressed I just want to hear the word and I hope that's what we're here today for not to show off the way that we're dressed or see how somebody else is dressed or hear from a man but to hear the word of God that's what I'm here for so Genesis 3:15 and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel this is one of my favorite scriptures it's showing that God before the foundation of the world knew that this fall was going to happen and he made a Plan of Redemption before it ever happened the world has just been created people have just been placed on the world the fall has just happened and yet he's talking about the one that's going to come to redeem us John 11 we're going to read 47-52 John 11: 47-52 then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a counsel and said what do we uh what do we for this man doth many miracles if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them named Caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation and not for that Nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad that's us he didn't just die for them he died for us a a a god of today brother Thomas John 34-17 John 314- 17 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world not to condemn us but that the world the entire world not just us sitting here not the church down the street the entire world but that the world through him might be saved Matthew 18:14 last one Matthew 18:14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish he doesn't want to see one of us one of anybody he doesn't want anybody to perish A Plan of Redemption for everyone that everyone in the world that would believe on him would have eternal life let's pray dear heavenly father Lord as I take this this simple thought Lord and just try to express it to your your children here father Lord I pray that that I would just move out of your way father and that you would just express your thought to them Lord Lord I pray that you would just take complete and total control of this service Lord take control of every spirit that would be in this building father Lord any doubt any any any anxieties any any anything that's not pleasing father that would hinder this service Lord I pray that you would just move it out of the way father Lord I pray that our thoughts and just everything about us would be centered around you right here right now Lord father I pray that you would just be with me just speak through me Father we love you with all of our hearts Lord in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated thank you you know I noticed last night as we had uh what seemed to be some people there that may not be sitting here this morning some people that had kind of gathered you know as as brother Tommy was was giving his uh his testimony there know people were listening and people always want to hear you know what the Lord has done for somebody but when brother Thomas got up and he started preaching the word all of a sudden the place started emptying out you know these are people of the world and through ignorants they started to leave because that's not what they want to hear they didn't want to hear what brother Thomas was warning them about they just wanted to hear the good things that God does for us that's what they wanted to hear but I want to as we sit in this church this morning I'm not preaching to the world this morning I'm preaching to message believers but is that good enough we're sitting here and as we go through this sermon I want you to keep in mind we're not the world we're message Believers and we're sitting in a message church but is it good enough the title of my sermon this morning is the heart of God and what I'm wanting to talk about here is what is the heart of God what does the heart of God look like what are the characteristics of the heart of god so let's identify First who who is the heart of God 1955 the unwelcomed Christ now I want to say something to you Jesus Took the lowest place of flunky Hallelujah that proves to me he was God he took the lowest place to wash feet now I'm dropping down a little bit to paragraph 72 here still talking about the same thing find out there ain't much good about us when you think of him becoming a footwash flunky the lowest there was he really in heart was the highest there was he was the heart of God and became the lowest paid footwash flunky so brother brandham is here saying he's saying Jesus Christ was the heart of God okay so now brother brandham also goes on to talk about how Jehovah in the Old Testament was Jesus Christ of the New Testament right okay I've got a quote here but we we'll just keep going with this you guys know where I'm talking about so where I'm going with this if if if if god Jehovah Christ Elohim these are all God right so the characteristic the heart of God is going to act the same in Genesis as he does in Revelation he's going to act the same in judges as he does in Matthew he's never going to change it doesn't matter what figure he's taken on who what body he is using the his heart is going to continually be the same Through the Ages same as it is today same as it will be tomorrow he doesn't change right so now that we've had that we've got this part established let's start talking about what are the characteristics of the heart of God and before I jump into that I'm going to tell you about a a a picture a painting that me and my wife got as a gift this isn't necessarily uh Inspire this sermon but as I looked at this painting it just went so well with it so I'm going to describe this painting to you okay and it's a painting that we got as a gift and it's from GH Africa okay and I'm GNA as if I'm standing behind the painting so you guys are looking at the front as you see this painting one of the th first things typically that pops out is the ark okay there's clouds in the sky the water the waves are crashing ing around everything crashing onto the ark crashing onto a mountain there's a bolt of lightning coming down over here there's a mountain the sky is really dark okay I've asked several people because I knew when I looked at this painting there was things that just popped out to me real quickly so I started checking to see if it was this just me or was this with with everybody so as I started showing this painting to people it's pretty evident that the same things that popped out to me were the same things that popped out to other people almost every single person saw the same thing almost exactly in the same order the first thing was the ark so let's look at this for a minute because the first thing that people see are the ark and I'm going to say that this is a characteristic of the heart of God is compassion okay there's an arc here because of his compassion for his creation he did not want to lose a one and I'm got a lot of scripture here that I'm just going to kind of maybe I'll read it all maybe I won't I'm going to throw out the the the scriptures if you guys want to write it down and go back and read it later that that's great Genesis 6 uh 613 and 14 and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh is come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth he asked him to make an ark so because of his compassion for the human race because of his compassion he was providing a way of Escape okay because he cares for us he cares for his creation going right back to Genesis 3:15 before the foundation of the world because of his compassion he was already making a Plan of Redemption knowing that we were going to fall knowing that we were going to have to have something to redeem us instead of in i he could have come down in the garden and said okay I'm just going to wipe these two out and I'm going to start over but because he had compassion he made a way to get back he because he loves them he loves us he doesn't want a one of us he doesn't want to lose one because of his compassion Matthew 14 14- 21 and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick I'm not going to read this whole thing this is the the the five 5,000 okay he's standing there with a group of it's more than 5,000 5,000 men that didn't count the women and the children I don't know that's a lot of people but because of his compassion they he was moved by his compassion he healed their sick can you imagine the prayer line that looked like over 5,000 people and he prayed and healed their sick and then didn't stop there the discip come to him and say hey we're in a desert there's nothing to eat we need to send these people away but because of his compassion no don't send them away let's feed them the disciples are thinking are you kidding me we don't have enough food here to feed the 12 of us how are you going to feed over 5,000 people but because of his compassion for the people bring it to me 12 baskets of food I believe it was that was left over but that's his compassion Luke 7 11 11-15 and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called Nan and many of his disciples went with him and and much people now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her her weep not so he's walked into a city there's a funeral going on he doesn't know this this woman he doesn't know this person that's died but he sees the situation and he has compassion for her she's a widow she doesn't have a husband now she's lost her son I don't know if she had more kids it doesn't say but he had compassion for her and there was nothing that she did to deserve what he was about to do there's nothing that she could do to earn what he was about to do but he walks over and the Paul Bears just move out of his way and he raises a man up from the dead because of the compassion for that woman a woman a one lonely woman but that it didn't matter if it was five ,000 people or if it was one his compassion still stood so on compassion we've talked about the Plan of Redemption that he's made because he's compassionate he loves us he needed to find a way for us to get back something to redeem us back build a boat even after he'd seen how evil the world had gotten his compassion he did not want anything anyone to die so he laid it on a man's heart to build a boat so that as many would come was welcome when before the destruction of Sodom Abraham comes to him and he's asking him if I can find 50 you guys know the story he says find me 50 I'll save them all because of his compassion what about 40 30 20 if I can find 10 if you can find 10 people I will save the city I will not destroy them because of his compassion Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane brother brandham says that that that Jesus died more in Gethsemane than he did in Calvary why his compassion the even the thought when you go back take this cup from me I don't want to do what I know is coming believe brother Tommy touched on this last night I don't want to do this but in the same breath not my will but yours be done the compassion god Jehovah Christ doesn't matter Old Testament New Testament it's the Same Heart of God the second thing people see in this painting is the storm the clouds how dark they are the waves that are crashing on the ark there's a lightning bolt that's shooting out of the sky and a young man pointed out how it splits and goes around the ark it didn't hit the ark and I thought about this what was that another characteristic of the heart of God Mercy he's a merciful god he had a boat he he laid it upon the heart of a man to build a boat to save people that if you will get in this boat you will you will not uh you'll be safe from this storm that's coming because of his Mercy Genesis 6:5 to7 and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on Earth and it grieved him at his heart it repented he regretted the fact that he even made man because he saw how evil they had become and yet through his Mercy he would was providing a way of Escape Genesis 18:32 and he said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this once peradventure 10 shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it if for 10's sake just we were talking about just a minute ago Abraham just pleading with the Lord don't destroy if you can find 10 because of my Mercy find 10 and I'll spare them all Luke 171 12-19 and he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were leopards which which stood AAR off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us we know this story 10 leopards they come to him they're asking for Mercy all he does is tell them to go and show themselves to the to the priest he doesn't say you're healed he doesn't say anything he just says go show yourselves as they're walking away they realized they're clean they realize that they're healed because of his Mercy they asked for mercy and he provided Mercy one turned around and came back to him he asked him where are the other nine but show me in the Bible where it says that they the the Le lepry came back on him he still healed them because of his Mercy it didn't matter that they didn't come back and thank him they still remained healed because of his Mercy they asked for mercy and he provided Mercy Mark 10:46 to 52 and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bmus the son of TUS Sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me again another person Jesus did not know this man he's walking through a city and this man starts screaming have mercy on me and because of the mercy of Jesus Christ the mercy of the heart of God he stopped and said bring him to me even though the crowd is telling him to be quiet no bring him here he's asking for mercy and I can provide that mercy so as we look at Mercy another attribute another characteristic of the heart of God even though he regretted making Men He Saw where the the the sons the sons of God see the daughters of of man and they they mingle with them even though they knew not to do that but they did it anyways but even with that he sends a man to preach for 120 years about something that had never happened before what did he even say the what there was no word for this it never happened before how do you what how do you to people the the the sky it's going to start crying the water's going to start falling out of the sky these people are like what are you talking about there's did Noah make up 60 years in thinking okay I got to make up a word for this so now he starts preaching it's going to rain people and everybody's going I don't even know what that is but he preached for 120 years God had this man preach for 120 years because of his Mercy that anybody that would listen come into this Ark he sent two angels into Sodom just to see if they could find enough because he would spare it find 10 because of his Mercy he healed people time and time again whether they deserved it whether they didn't deserve it whether they thanked him or didn't thank him he would still heal them because they would ask for mercy and he could provide Mercy for them I needed Mercy brother Tommy if you listen to his testimony he needed Mercy we all at some point in our lives needed Mercy I would be a divorced man not standing here before you today if it was not for the mercy of the heart of God [Applause] the third thing people notice in the painting as you look at the ark and you realize there's people in that Ark why are the people in that Ark because of his grace another characteristic of the heart of God grace where would we be without his grace Genesis 68 but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord as as God's looking around sees all of this evil but this one man found Grace and you know that Ark was open to anyone that would come the grace was there for them but they would not accept his grace it was there but they wouldn't accept it Genesis 1917-19 and it came to pass when they had brought them from brought them forth abroad that he said Escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and lot said unto them oh not so my Lord behold now thy servant hath found Grace in thy sight and thou Hast magnified the mer thy mercy which thou has showed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I die lot he did nothing to deserve this Grace lot knew better and yet he stayed in a city city that was so evil that God was going to destroy this place and lot knowing better stayed there with them because of wealth because of his Comforts he would not separate himself from them lot did not deserve Grace but because God is so full of grace he gave them a way of Escape Mark 59 and he h and he asked him what is thy name I couldn't leave this one out brother Tommy and he answered saying my name is Legion for we are many Legion of me you've heard this this man did nothing to deserve the grace of God it was just simply the fact that before the foundation of the world God had looked down through time and he saw this man and he knew the decision that this man would make if he could just be freed and so by the grace of God by the grace of the heart of God he spent a trip to go over the sea to one man that's Grace nothing he could have done to deserve it there was nothing he could do to deserve that but the grace of [Applause] God acts 9 1 to8 I I'm not going to read this whole thing and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went to the high priest desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that he found any of the way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound to unto Jerusalem we know this story this man saw on his way to round up Christians to round up Believers to put him in prison to have him put to death a man that stood and held the coats of the men that stoned Stephen to death that man and yet the grace of God was powerful enough to cover that sin I can't imagine being Paul having to live with that on my conscience but for the grace of God I am what I am that's what he said but for the grace of God that's the grace of God Luke 23 39 to 43 and one of the Mal factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying Dost not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy King Kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise a convicted criminal sentenced to death reached out at the last moment of his life and the Heart of God hanging there that did not deserve it he did nothing to deserve what was happening he did it because of compassion he did it because of mercy and now hanging on the cross he shows his grace to a man that did not deserve it in his dying breath he's asking will you give me Grace and he was granted I don't know what that man's life looked like up to that moment I can tell you he got there for a reason and yet in this last last moment a few hours after that he was in Paradise because of the grace of God we could tell story after story of the what the grace of God has done what it's looked like in our lives we love Grace we need Grace I needed Grace I needed Grace if not more than anybody sitting in this room I needed Grace I did nothing to deserve what he did for me but yet here I stand and I say just like Paul I because of the grace of God I am what I am compassion Mercy Grace the characteristics of the heart of God the fourth thing that people see in this painting this mountain it's over here to the side as you start looking at the painting a little closer you start realizing that there are people on this mountain their hands are up and they're crying out they're looking at they're looking down at the ark they're climbing to the highest part that they can get to because the water's Rising this thing that they'd never heard of before in their life was happening the rain was falling and the waters were rising and because of God's compassion because of his Mercy because of his grace the way of Escape was right there and they didn't take it but what what are they looking at now the anger anger another characteristic of the heart of God now some people would say wait a minute anger that's a sin no anger is not a sin anger is an emotion and it is a characteristic of the heart of God numbers 25 1:5 and Israel Abode in chidam and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab and they called the people unto sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bow down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto bpor and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and the Lord said unto Moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord against the Sun that the the the that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel and Moses said unto the judges of Israel slay ye everyone his men that were joined unto bpor this is the anger of God kill every single one of them that joined into this or I'll take every one of you out I'll kill you all he's a jealous God his anger was kindled against his people because of the way that they were acting he brought them out of Egypt with his compassion with his Mercy with his grace and yet now they're turning away from him and the other characteristic of the heart of God the anger started to be kindled mark 11 12 to 14 and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet this is when he's coming down from from from his his time there he hasn't ate in a while he sees a fig tree Christ a man a Hungry Man The Heart Of God a Hungry Man and as he walks up to this fig tree and it has no figs on it I you can call maybe he got hangry you know the man was hungry and he got mad because this tree did not have figs on it and he cursed the tree because he was angry this wasn't a temper tantrum he was mad and he cursed that tree it's you know types there's a type here the treated was not producing fruit the way it's supposed to be producing fruit so he cursed it and the tree Withers up and dies you guys getting the type here right his anger John 2 13-6 and the Jews Passover was at hand anded Jesus went up to J Jerusalem and he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the Changers of money sitting and when he had made a scorge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables he saw this happening in the Lord's house and he got angry I was sitting in a service one time and a brother was preaching and and he he asked he asked the it's a dangerous thing when you asked the congregation something but he asked the congregation you know because he was talking about temper and he said you know did did Jesus did you ever see Jesus have a temper and a man yelled out what about when he was in the temple this wasn't a temper this was he was mad he had every right to be mad was anger and because of the anger he did what needed to be done what anybody should have done he grabbed some cords put them together and started beating people out of there through the tables over not in my house so another characteristic of the heart of God anger how many times did Moses stand in the breach for the PE for the children of Israel because he got angry with them so many times he would have just destroyed them if it would not have been for Moses Noah Sodom he always makes a way of Escape when he starts getting angry and he knows that the end is coming the is only going to allow this to go on so long he will always make a way of Escape but it's not because he's not angry prayer however can change things Moses did it time and time again a god of anger about to destroy his own people and yet a prophet would stand there and pray and it would change the mind of God would change some he had already made up his mind what he was going to do and yet prayer would change his mind the last thing that people see in this painting it was the last thing I saw in this painting in fact it took me a day before I ever even saw it here's the painting The Ark the storm the waves crashing in on the Ark on the mountain the clouds the lightning you see the people on the mountain and then you realize what they're looking up at because up here in a cloud there's a face and it's an angry face it's the face of Wrath which is another character istic of the heart of God is wrath Exodus 32 7-1 and the Lord said unto Moses go get thee down for that people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them I think it's very interesting that in this moment right here and the Lord said to Moses go get thee down for the thy people which thou brought out of Egypt if I remember right at the burning bush this conversation looked a whole lot differently Moses is doing everything that he can to not go do this because he's not capable of doing it and God is trying to convince him you all you got to do is go I'll take care of it from there because he was going to bring them out God was going to bring it out but now he's telling Moses the ones that you brought out of Egypt they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed there unto and said these by these be thy Gods oh Israel which which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and the Lord said unto Moses I have seen this people and behold it is a stiff necked people brother Thomas read a scripture last night where Christ says the exact same thing now therefore let me alone that my wrath May Wax Hot against them and that I may consume them and I will make of thee a great nation he's telling Moses step aside I'm angry with them I've done I've showed compassion I've showed Mercy I've showed Grace but now it's time for wrath I've had enough get out of the way I'm going to destroy every one of them but I'll raise you up another Nation Moses and Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people which thou Hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with with a mighty hand it's almost as if he's reminding the Lord as his servant I didn't bring them out you did and you brought them out for a reason he sees the wrath of God is coming John 213- 16 we're going back to the to the uh the Passover here the money changers you know as as as as Jesus walked up on this scene and he sees what's going on in his in the in the house of God he starts getting angry and he starts binding those cords together why because the Wrath was coming the Wrath is what starts beating the Wrath is what starts turning the tables over that's the Wrath the same thing uh uh with the with the fig tree you know he walks upon the tree the anger was there because there's no figs the Wrath part was the tree withered out withered up because wrath is a characteristic of the heart of God Revelations 61 12-1 17 and I'm going to read this in the King James and I'm also going to read this in the Amplified and I beheld when he had opened the six seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sack sackcloth of of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a srel went in in it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand same same Revelation 6 15 to 17 and the Amplified then the kings of the earth and the Great Men of the military commanders and the wealthy and the strong and everyone whether slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains and they called out to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the righteous wrath and ignation of the Lamb for the great day of their wrath and and Vengeance and rep retribution has come and who is able to face God and stand before the Wrath of the Lamb this is speaking to the end times what's coming people these are great men I this could be the president of the United States for all I know didn't matter if you were poor didn't matter if you were Rich you are in a situation right now that you cannot get out of the wrath of God is now upon you and there's nothing you can do to escape it he's already tried with his compassion he's already given you Mercy he's already given you Grace but now the Wrath is upon you the doors to the ark are now closed and the rain has started to fall can you imagine being those people in that day Noah and his family have now went into this Ark and everybody has been making fun of this man for 120 years and all of a sudden a raindrop hits you in the face what was that and then another and another what was the last thing that these people were seeing it was the wrath of God he did everything he could to save because not he doesn't want to see one of them lost even through his anger he doesn't want to lose one but they would not accept anything that he provided for them and now the last thing that they're seeing is the wrath of God the children of Israel wandering around in the desert until the entire generation died off the last thing that those people saw was the wrath of God all of the miracle they traveled with a prophet they traveled with the pillar of fire food fell out of the sky everything these people had seen the the the compassion for those people those were his chosen people the compassion the mercy the grace that he had and all of the signs and wonders they saw and yet the last thing that they saw was the wrath of God the people in Sodom living an moral lifestyle we know what they were doing the homosexuality he gave them every opportunity I know in the in the message that you know homosexuality that's like a phobia don't get too close to that guy I might catch that Moses stood in the gap for these people who's standing in the gap for them he could not step over Moses that's what brother Bram said he could not his wrath could not step over the prophet who's standing in the Gap now the Bride of Jesus Christ that's us and we're running from him like we're going to catch something the Wrath is coming the last thing those people saw was a ball of Fire coming at them after he had given them every opportunity even through his anger but here comes the Wrath this is always the last thing that people see I don't know who those people were there last night the ones that got up when he started preaching on what I'm talking about right now but they did not want to hear that part they want to sit in their little churches or their big mega churches and all they want to do is hear how good God is what God can do for a man that doesn't deserve anything no I don't mean that brother Tommy and I didn't deserve it either but that's all they want to hear is how good he is they want to hear about his Mercy his grace his compassion they don't want to hear his wrath is coming why does he always send that warning why does he always make that way of Escape because he's already angry his anger's already been kindled before that moment he knows that the that destruction's coming he knows I'm only going to deal with this so much but I'm going to give you every opportunity before the Wrath hits Noah day he sent the ark he had a man preach for 120 years about something that had never happened the days of Sodom he went down he sent some angels to see if they could find anybody so what about today if he never changes the Ang ER is what comes first people then he provides the way of Escape there would not need to be a way of Escape if there was no anger why did he send William brandom a way of Escape his compassion was to send William branam his Mercy was the fact that you would hear it his grace is the fact that you're sitting here right now what comes next people the Wrath 1962 presuming but they say oh he is a good god he is a good God but don't you presume on that he is a God of Justice too he is a good god like a little teenage boy said not long ago said you know God is so good he just don't care what I do nonsense He does care what you do yeah you say God is a good God God is a good God but we hear too much of that today God is a god of wrath he is a god of judgment he was God enough to go down there and take Israel right out of the mouth of death and turned right turned turned right in the wilderness and let them rot because they wouldn't follow him God has a good God was a good God to pull you Pentecostals out of them organizations but you turned right back around and acted like your Mammy so you're rotting in it there's a tape recorder going on here it goes around the world you know I'm not sure I'm not so much speaking here now but you rot right in it then come tell you the truth then you don't believe it here it is wrote right here see in the word yes sir there's a tape being recorded right now that's going to go around the world because his wrath is coming he's a god of wrath 1963 is your life worthy of the Gospel now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it and he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy then there's only one thing left and that is Judgment brother bam talks about how you will have to crawl over every boundary every obstacle that he puts in front of you to go to hell and we find that man has done that in all ages it's happened most every age in the Bible when God sent Noah his servant and made a way of an escape for all the people who wanted to be saved but the people only laughed and scorned at Noah but God made the way but they had an excuse it wasn't according to their to their modern thinking it did it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made made excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the Days of Elijah they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today we're in a message church we believe the message right because of his compassion his Mercy his grace he's made a way of Escape his wrath is coming next but let me give you some good news 1959 thinking on our way we don't mean by that that we're going to heal anyone we believe that by the grace of God we're going to let them know that God has already healed them and they are just they and they are just accepted it then just as we're trying to let the sinner know that God loves him and he's already saved him if he will just accept it it's the work that Christ finished at Calvary when he made that all sufficient word saying it is finished the whole Plan of Salvation all that could be done for mankind by the heart of God was finished when Christ said those words God's plan was is completed we just have to have faith to receive what he has finished for us the sin question was settled at Calvary sickness was settled at Calvary eternal life was settled at Calvary everything we have need of was settled at Calvary because of his compassion because of his Mercy because of his grace he's already shown he's angry he would have never sent William Brown of if there wasn't anger if we didn't need a way of Escape he would not have needed to send him he's done everything he can possibly do to let us get out wrath is coming so my question Church is are you ready because it's coming nothing's going to stop it nothing can stop it the Wrath is coming you look at the the the world in its condition today as as brother Thomas just said last night brother Bram said how much worse can it get before he's going to be obligated to raise up Sodom and apologize to him how much longer do we have his compassion he sent us a prophit his Mercy he's allowed you to hear it he's allowed you to hear it the one sitting right here he has allowed you me to hear it because of his Mercy because of his compassion you're sitting here right now because of his Mercy each and every one of us because of his grace he's extended the grace but the Wrath is what follows are you ready when the Rapture takes place the world is not going to know what happened there's going to be so few people brother Brown talks about this it the world even if there was a million of us gone that's nothing 8 billion people on this planet a million people gone is nothing the world is not going to have the first clue as to what happened it's just going to start getting worse and worse and worse can you it's this bad now and his spirit is still here what will it be like when he removes his Spirit from this place I do not want to be here I will not be here when the Rapture takes place though the world will not know what happened but you will you think about that church the people sitting in message churches that all of a sudden on Sunday morning because they only come to church on Sunday morning when they show up and half the people aren't there or maybe five or six aren't there and then they call this church down the road hey you know is is uh you know are these people over there cuz you know our pastor's not here we're ready to have church but our pastor's not here we're just wondering uh and then them saying about uh you know it's funny we're having the same problem here and you start calling and then fear is going to set in because it's not going to take a whole lot to figure out what has happened I talked to I've talked to to to people and when I ask the question are you ready and the answer is I yeah I believe I am I believe I'm ready I I I think I think I'm ready and then I point out this quote and I it's really how can you be certain that you're ready is is more of the question and and when I point this quote out let me just read it 1963 questions answers on the seals someone said well there is no need for me trying it brother brandham said there's only one only be one saved out of Jeffersonville see now see it's showing a parable that isn't that isn't it there might be thousands saved I don't know I hope every one of them is saved see but don't know but here is the way I want to believe it I am that one you believe the same for you if you don't then something's wrong with your faith you're not sure what you're doing and I hear people say well if there's only one going out of Elton well it's got to be that man right there it can't be me but if I knew he was coming right now brother Thomas I'm sorry I'll pray for you brother because I'm the one going I don't care where I'm at I don't care if I'm in Jeffersonville I'm sorry brother Joseph I'll be praying for you brother I'm the one going when I ask that question to you the answer should come back the same I'm sorry brother Jonathan I'm the one going if if you're sitting here today and you're not able to say that if you're not sure if you're not so sure that I am the one going something's wrong something's wrong with your faith and I'm telling you that wrath is coming so I'm asking you don't leave this building today there's an altar right here it can handle every person in here if needed to be don't leave here until you're saying I'm sorry brother Thomas I'm sorry brother Jonathan it's me let's pray dear heavenly father Lord I've tried to take this simple thought Lord that you've given me Lord and I'm trying to convey to your your your children father your people people father that Lord we know that you're a compassionate God there wouldn't be a one of us sitting here if it wasn't for your compassion your mercy and your grace father but Lord

of the Lord and I just want us to be ready I want to I don't want anyone to take that lightly there's a reason you sent William brandom to us there's a reason that we have tapes and recordings of him judgment's coming you sent the way of Escape father I pray that each and every person here Lord if they don't know that they know that they know father I pray that they don't leave this Church Father until they they they work it out with you lord lord I pray that every single person in this building that when I cross over that I see every one of them there Lord that is my prayer father I thank you
