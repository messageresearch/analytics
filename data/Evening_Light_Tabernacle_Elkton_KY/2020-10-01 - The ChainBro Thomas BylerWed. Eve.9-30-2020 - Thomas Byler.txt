amen god bless you good evening good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody tonight amen praise the lord i don't know why it just seems dark in here but i think all the lights are on so it must just be me amen probably because it's dark outside we're not used to that maybe that's what it is amen praise the lord i hope you all enjoy the wonderful fall weather that's what i've been looking for all summer right there amens and i will just stay that way we'll be all right god bless you trust everybody's feeling well as far as i know most everybody is so praise the lord we're glad for that amen can't think of any announcements so let's just bow our heads kind heavenly father once again we approach your throne lord jesus desiring god that lord as we speak to your people father this evening lord and as they approach the throne of grace throne of god father and to bring themselves and to present themselves before you we ask god that you would just look at every heart look at the motive and the objective every heart and life tonight lord and we just desire god you'll minister lord to our needs speak to us the thing that we have need of and lord we just ask god that you've helped me to step out of the way that you'd use your gift lord jesus and father that you would lord be a blessing in the edification of the body of christ thank you for all that you do we praise you we love you for all that you do father and what you mean to us it is such an honor and such a privileged lord to be able to get away on a midweek service lord and not to have to stream but lord we just to be able to assemble ourselves together and to worship you in spirit any truth father we just ask god tonight the thought that i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak on that you would just have the preeminence and say what you once said father in jesus name we ask it amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will and we'll go to matthew the fourth chapter i believe we'll begin and i just want to take tonight the little phrase that brother branham made and i think i may have preached on this not so often long ago uh the phrase that he made and when he made this statement the statement that he made actually about his chain being its strongest at its weakest link so tonight we're going to call it the chain just the chain amen and so but i actually want to speak about several different chains if we have time amen but we want to talk about the chain matthew 4 verse 1 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterwards a hunger and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread but jesus answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god may god add his blessings to reading words you can be seated amen so this evening i want to start with talking about the chain of the word amen the chain of the word amen god's word is like a chain amen and so i'm going to read a met a quote out of the message called harvest time it says now let's now go back in genesis which is genesis means the beginning we find that god gave his each family eternal life as long as they stayed in the word and lived by this word amen so now i read that in in matthew because that's going to be our middle of the book where jesus talked about it in the middle of the book talking about the word of god amen but now we want to go to genesis for just a minute we won't go to the actual scripture but we know that god had commanded them that thou shalt not eat of this tree neither shall you touch it at least ye die isn't that right that was the word amen and satan comes along and he says thou shalt not surely die so brother man says look as long as they live by this word but they broke it so he says and just one link in the chain of promises death struck them which was a promise also he says it's a chain all right it's a chain god's word is a chain and um he says and you're you're hanging over hell with it all right now let me stop there i'm going to take my time tonight is that okay and i want to go down before i read the rest of this and kind of give you a description and i would like to almost change this description a little bit but um i'm going to read it the way brother bam said it first now this is very strong but just listen close no that's not the one he says listen that's like taking a man and you're hanging by his feet and he's got his hands in heaven i don't just understand that quite right but and you cut him half in two or break off a toe whatever you're hanging on to you're hanging on the very bottom of it bottom part and you break that chain anywhere you're gone see now bear that mind so as brother bam talks about hanging on a chain we can imagine and and probably in the old days we've seen movies of people that were perhaps hanging by a rope and that right that rope was perhaps brittle and it'd be begin to fray i'll remember it would fray and and man it was a high anticipation of the person definitely going to fall over the cliff because this rope's frayed you know it's got a weak spot in it it's cutting on the edge of the rocks or something you know that's kind of what i imagine you know and it's like uh you know it'd be like hanging on a chain perhaps you got a hold of a hook or something on the bottom of that chain now you know and brother i'm talking about be cutting two or if you break it anywhere is what he's trying to say if you break that anywhere he's gone you know and so if you cut the toes or whatever but in this case if you had a hold of a hook perhaps you can't even get this other hand up and you're hanging there by just four fingers you know and those fingers are eventually going to cut off but lord help me if there's someone is something swinging through the air and it hits those four fingers and smashes your four fingers how many knows you'd probably be gone right because your whole body is hanging on by your four fingers it's just by hanging on with that so bab describes this he dramatizes this as being hanging over hell your soul is hanging over the burning blazes right i mean fire a pit of fire over hell and so your whole soul is hanging on the chain and you're hanging there amen and you wouldn't want a weak link in that chain you want that chain to be strong but if that chain you know they could have big old round hooks like that or round circles really big chain it could pull a bulldozer but if one of those was made out of something perhaps just the two chains wired together a little bit you would not be concerned about any part except for that wire together place right you'd be very concerned about this wired together place where the weak spot that's what we're going to talk about that weak spot that weak link in the chain amen and i just want to say this that that is satan's territory of triumph satan's territory of triumph amen in people's lives all down through history has been their weak spot amen their weak part in their life amen and here with the word of god let me finish this if i may amen this coats irritating my neck with this i may have to go back to the old lapel down here i don't know but anyway so now notice so now i notice he says now you're hanging over hell with it he says and that's the only thing that will carry you through all right is every word of god every word how many knows that there was a great fall because one word was broke there was a weak link in that right now will you and i know that that weak link was eve god created a weak link he knew she would fall you know right he created it that way but still put him on fremont basis free moral agency to choose which way you want to go but now notice so he says now when the believer becomes a make-believer and lives in on one word that's contrary to this he cuts his fellowship with god i mean blaze that in in the old testament to break one the least commandment you've broke them all you're guilty of one and you're guilty of them all amen so it's just that one place he says and you cut your fellowship off with god it meant by taking one word that's contrary to the word of god and i like it down here he says it's very strong but listen close he says one word one word of god was first in the bible god said one word separated man from its eternal life chain amen he talked about a loop eternal life chain he was linked together amen but it broke that you know right we came down into time and one day god will bring it back together but it broke that broke his eternal life broke the whole chain plunged the whole human race into death because one word was broken because of that one place eve just disbelieved one word she actually believed a word she wasn't supposed to believe all right it wasn't that she didn't believe any you know any of she believed that god said thou shalt surely perish she believed that but then satan comes in there and then he adds a word and she believed the extra word thou shalt not surely perish she believed to not and it brings it all into this chaos that we're in so because the one word is why we get gray hair we get old we die one word broken and now notice here in the middle of the bible jesus comes along and he says and he's 40 days hungered starving to death all right because you know during the time that he was uh you know he talks about i believe it was afterwards he was hungered all right yeah it does say verse two it says and afterwards he was a hunger in other words he wasn't hungry until then but afterwards he got really really hungry and then satan tempted him to make uh stones into bread amen just the same temptation that he brought to eve he brought to jesus and that is to obey him to believe him to become servant to him but what did jesus turn around and say he said that man shall not live by bread alone but man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen and it's pretty strong because i believe you and i are living in that hour that the bride of christ is going to believe every word he says he's got to believe every word in order to take us back to eden again now there was at times i mean there was a time when martin luther john wesley and amish and mennonite and everybody else so they were ignorant of what the truth really was god winked at people's ignorance but not here in the end time not after he came and proved it over and over what was the truth ignorance is no excuse anymore now your soul hangs over hell of whether or not you believe every word of god amen and let me just put it as strong and straight as he did cuts off his fellowship with god remember your faith in this word is like a chain and it change is strongest at its weakest link that's right it's the strongest right there because that's all it'll hold amen and if there's something in the word that's puzzling you something that you heard different but they said oh the days of apostles them things are all gone by when the scripture says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't let that be a weakness fortify it and hold it amen how many believe justifications believe one word misplaced one word is eternal death it's very serious and wrap your life into it because that's the only thing that'll take you over the flames of hell that's right amen pray the lord so now notice let me finish this here so and when this chain is broke with adam and eve the first family now remember they didn't break a sentence they didn't break three words only one word man shall hell man shall hang over hell by every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's where man's eternal destination is determined why he'll hang by that chain or he'll hang by a creed and if there's any creed mixed into that chain that's where the weak lick is amen and you're gone now notice if you'll notice that brother abandonment towers the end of his ministry 1964-1965 this is where he preached like this this is where he got very straight with any creed any dogma amen when he preached the god chosen place of worship there's no other place god will meet you only in christ will he meet you amen he got really straight no creed can be mixed anymore come out of there come out of there and you know be about not particularly since all right so now notice he says again now he says the day that you put into you anything besides the unadulterated word of god into your soul that's the day you're separated from god amen praise the lord so we see that the word of god how many knows the word of god is a chain and only our faith in that word amen amen and the way that we follow that word and the way that we live by that word and i tell you what i was thinking about how much of of different things that the holy spirit's been telling us of how that we ought to feed even sunday did you notice our brother how he said that you know the holy spirit is saying that you know we really amen we've got to labor we've got the hunger we've got to study we got to read we got to meditate on these things more how many believe that that's what the spirit's been telling us that we have to focus more on it amen and think about it more amen there's amen peace there's joy in it and that's where you get your joy is in your prayer life and and your time with the lord and feeding on the word of god all right so another so i wanted to cover that let's see i want to have i want to cover about four different subjects tonight one of them of course the word is to talk about the chain of the word amen and the other one is the chain of your character all right the chain of your character the chain of the church all right and just the difference several different chains that brother bam talked about now the second one i want to go to is over in ii peter let's go to second peter and this is another place that it's mentioned about us chain being its strongest at its weakest link and brother branham is preaching on the stature of a perfect man all right statue of a perfect man so we'll try to go through this all right second chapter second book of peter chapter one verse five and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to brotherly unto godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity now notice and if these things be in you and about they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ but he that lacketh thee things and i want to dwell on that for just a second or two maybe but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he is purged from his old sense there's another one over in in first corinthians i want to go to because this will go along with this amen because this brother bannon went down and teaching the statue of a perfect mind i think you all know where i'm going because you have probably have listened to this message quite a few times but i want to i want to pick it over to paul because paul actually bears this out about their uh about that weak link even in a person's character all right because this is what i call a person's character it's called the statue of a perfect man right and it's uh let me just go over here the statue of a perfect man uh it also has to do with the ages each one representing it we know that the first one is faith the second one is virtued in knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and the holy ghost and perfect love amen of course the first one brother bam talked about was faith you know faith and so forth having virtue knowledge temperance and having all these things but he mentions it and he talks about you know if anywhere in these amen that you have a weak place amen and let's just say that amen you have you have a lot of these characteristics you've got faith you've got knowledge you've got virtue amen but let me just read it and and i'll talk to you about let me let me let paul explain it 13th chapter of corinthians paul said you know even though if i speak with tongues of men and angels if i lack something you know right in other words if there's something not there that's supposed to be there right so you can have tongues but if you don't have charity he meant you're already going to go down it's not going to work i have become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and do i have the gift of prophecy and i understand all mysteries and all knowledge and don't have all faith so that i could remove mountains if i don't have charity i am nothing so i believe paul's saying about what the prophet of god said that if you've got a weak place in there that's where the chain breaks amen that's where your character is mar and if you'll notice peter says that if these things be in you and about they'll make two that you are neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ brother bam says oh my let me see um i can just uh right here brother babe says what is it if if all these things really are in you and about he says this is really what what you are he says what is it then full of love and full of the holy ghost walking around what is it it's a stature that uh that unbelievers can look at and say now there is a christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you've never seen a kindly or sweeter godlier person brother baby says when you have these things you become the perfect tabernacle of god to dwell in and to live in how many wants that but as i said i wanted to dwell on second peter the others he that lacketh thee things he that lacketh he thinks in other words he when you say that you're a christian and you lack these things it's like you're saying that i am a christian i'm i'm just going to take for illustration you're going to say that you call yourself a cow i'm a cow all right but listen when you open your mouth a moo doesn't come out a s the winning of a horse you know right if you had a different sound coming out you'd say look he calls himself a cow but he sounds like a horse all right and his ears are straight up in the air and this cow's ears are drooping all right he don't look like a cow he don't sound like a cow you know you don't act like a cow you don't have a other like a cow you don't just don't look like a cow and that's what it's like for a person that likes the thing if you lack neat things amen it shows that there's something wrong there but notice so we talk about character and that's our character whenever we have faith you might have faith to move mountains but i sure hate that person over there huh oh i believe god i believe that oh hallelujah but there's another area that's just not right huh what it brings what we would call a um brother talked about a stick that's come on a corn stalk and it's deformed it right a deformed stalk and that's what we become if we lack these things in our weak like we weakness that's what we've become and i'm going to stop there for just a minute because it comes to my mind i think about david how many knows david was a man after god's own heart the bible says he was a man after god's own heart in other words i i from what i understand god liked david a whole lot god really liked david he was he was the guy but guess what david had a weakness he had a weak place and because of that weak place he brought reproach upon the whole nation not to mention amen his weakness brought amen it brought sin in and it brought chaos in amen it brought all kinds of destruction in him and you know saw absalom trying to take over the kingdom and that the kingdom divided and not eating his wives being ravished by everybody and everything it was terrible all because of that one weak place and how many knows it's those times like i said that place of weakness is where the devil's place of triumph is that he was shouting the praises oh the devil was having him a good time oh yeah yeah after god's own heart right you know yeah the devil was triumphant you know he was he was man he was just having a he loves those places the devil loves your weak places he knows where your weak places are amen how many is just a fervent prayer to god and a complete dedication to god and the strengthening of that weak lick is the only thing that will strengthen it and make it stronger because if that breaks no matter how much faith you got no matter how much you can preach or whatever it might be when that weak link comes it just brings a reproach on the whole thing amen and that's the way it was with david he had a weak spot and how about moses you know moses was a great man he went down in the face of pharaoh he was a mightier of god but he had a problem he still had a weak place in his life and it was called his amen temper finally whenever god you know and moses different times had a lot of patience but he also had this temper and one time you know when they uh they irritated moses for the last time and he got plum mad and he said must i fetch you water out of this rock and he smote the rock and he smote it again when it didn't come and god said had said speak to the rock and then right yeah it said speak to the wrong and it'll bring forth water and he smoked the rock twice break the whole pattern of god's word brother ham says and because of his temper he didn't go into the promised land he was saved and all but listen he had a weakness and that was where the devil prevailed that's where the devil triumphed is in that weak place and that's where the devil has his fun with you and me that's where he tries that's his victory for us to have weak places in our life huh and when we give into that weakness satan triumphs and he has his jubilee amen you know you think about how glorious david was but yet the shame that he wrought before because of his weakness same way with moses the man that he was the stature of god and speak like god and spoke for god and yet because of that god wouldn't let him go in because of that issue that he had and what about samson how many days do you think about samson how the mighty warrior he was i mean out there i don't like the might like to see the movie sometime of samson you know how he killed those thousand philistines and man just bashed their heads in and just swell heap upon heap heap upon heap he slew him huh he'd get a big old pile of them and he'd trip trip over and fall down he's getting started another pile start another foul and start another part just keep slaughtering just unbelievable superman but this superman was brought down because he had a weak place he had a weakness for delilah isn't that right amen and because of his weakness he ended up grinding at the mill had both of his eyes taken out and he was grinding at the mill and going around and around around the devil's slave because of his weakness god help us tonight amen how many believes that we don't want those weak places we do we want we want to have that chain strong all the way through amen praise the lord so brother bam says listen he says that's right if you possess one of these and you can say well i got this and i got that i have this but he says looky here you miss one place and that's where she breaks amen that place where you haven't got what you're supposed to have that's where it breaks and all of your strength and all of your greatness is only as strong and as good as the weakest place that you have wow that's as a way of deflating you a little bit don't it doesn't mean anything the only thing that means anything is how strong are you really amen praise the lord all right talk about the chain of the church the church body how many knows that over in uh first corinthians not 13 but we're going to go to the 12th chapter and you could read a lot here but i'll just read a couple of them it's okay i think everybody knows that pretty much the story but 12th chapter 12 verse for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ how many knows just as a physical body that's what he's talking about for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether it be we've found they're free and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen and you know it talks about the food shall say this side or the other but let's just say that in this body perhaps your kidney doesn't work right huh or whatever it might be in verse 26 says if there's one member of that body that suffers all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all members rejoice with it huh and i remember you know brother ivan and where they said it was located the cancer was located now i forget the the different organs but it was between his uh uh liver i think in the next place that it's supposed to go to right in there and they they said it was inoperable they can't operate you know because of where it was and i thought you know most of the times a lot of times whether it's a perhaps a lung or perhaps it's a it's one of the organs they can just take that organ out and hey guess what you get to live another 20 30 years but if you have one organ that's infected one organ that's weak right amen it can destroy the whole body kill the whole body because of that one place that one weak place amen and i'm going to say this you know as i get older we realize i realize that you can't eat this stuff that you used to eat as much you have to be more careful about what i eat you know um i thank god you know that by god's grace you know i have cousins different ones a couple of them have sugar diabetes different things and so forth but you know and but here lately i you know i i like to go to arby's i love arby's what is that called that that that uh chamoca that's a mocha you know in a sandwich or then i went by burger king and burger kings had their whopper on sale for two for five dollars you know and anywhere you go you buy a sandwich it's seven bucks i said but this is a good deal you know and and this is pretty good looking whopper my wife says you know that's pretty good got lettuce and onion tomato and i've been chowing down on whoppers now i've been eating pretty good and so i made it a habit you know i wanted to go eat my something but then you know here about two weeks ago i think i may have told some of y'all i don't know who all but i couldn't sleep i was laying on my back and i was getting numbness in my left arm a little bit on my right my chest begin to hurt real bad shortness of breath a little bit i almost called sister hannah i almost said what you know what are the symptoms of a heart attack because this is your feeling like someone just about what it did and i knew there's a i've had i've had a lot of heart pains or different things before but this was it stayed there all night all morning all the next day it was just really i was concerned you know that this was coming down and of course i got to thinking about all the whoppers all that fast food that i've been eating you know that just goes to show you off a lot of fast food folks you want to die quick but anyway and and you know the thing that i got from about it by god's grace you know i said honey all right this is it no more whoppers and by god's grace i've said i've got to change my knot and anybody that i think i told tommy i said pray for me and i've you know i have this and so forth i said you know i don't i don't believe i got to go in i'm not going to i don't want no stance huh i don't want no stance i don't want to do all that i want to spend 50 000 scoping myself you know if i'll just go on a diet probably be alright reagan if i just eat right and diet you know and so forth you know and i thought you know that is so true spiritually i mean you just jam anything else down there and you're not going to be a healthy christian it's not good for you it's going to kill you if you just jam anything amen you got to be careful about what you eat amen and if it's so naturally it's that way spiritually how many believes you've got to make sure you eat good food and you'll be healthy and i've been doing that for about two weeks and i ain't had a pain and i think i've been getting slowly better ever since and it lasted only about two days i think after i really cranked down and drank a bottle of vinegar and a few other things that you know just really and uh you know bring some of that stuff to clean you out i said what's the fastest way to clear out your arteries you know and then you drink some of that stuff you'll really hate to drink that's what's good for you stuff you don't like you know some of them church servers that really step on your toes that maybe you don't like it but that's probably good for you isn't that right but anyway i learned that and i thank god for it you know but and so just anyway so i hope that helps somebody but think about it so the body if you have one part you know that doesn't work right it ended up killing the whole thing and that's the way it is even in a local body even in a local church when you have one person perhaps huh one person that's weak one person said sick how many knows that when you come in those double doors your atmosphere affects the whole service it affects everybody it affects the kind of service that we have when you're when you're either down or defeated or sick or weak or not spiritual you haven't been eating the way you should and you're just sick spiritually huh how many knows it affects everybody sure it does and i thought about this one statement brother manna made about the church in ephesians parallels our joshua is what we're very familiar with but the bible says your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your on misbehavior of unconfessed sin huh come to church all unconfessed and all my just all the listen it affects everybody unconfessed a few believers you can cause this church to bitterly fail huh how many believes that i mean please lord help us don't let me be the weak link in a body or a local body lord strengthen me when i come around amen to everybody i want to encourage people i don't want to be a downer to everybody or you know have sin in my life and you know sit there perhaps with doubt or frustration or whatever but be there with the holy spirit and pull from the gift of god cause somebody to get saved because i'll tell you right now when sinners come into the church they feel the atmosphere of the church people feel the atmosphere how many knows you can feel the atmosphere it don't take long to get each other's atmosphere and see what kind of atmosphere you hit amen and tell how healthy we are praise the lord that's right cause the church to brittlely fail and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it amen so lord help us all to remember each and every one of us god help us strengthen that weak spot amen that area where the devil perhaps can get you down get you depressed it may be it may be fear it could be any number thing it could be anything with any of us amen i don't know what your weak power spot is god does and you do amen how many how many know how many is with me you know where your weak spot is your weakness is amen it may be just simply that you don't take time to pray like you should amen perhaps not patient amen whatever it might be let me talk just a little couple more and we'll we'll bring it to early close tonight but about 30 40 minutes amen i thought well this should be about 30-40 minutes that's what brother brown said was a real good service so maybe we'll have a good 30 40 minute service tonight all right i better hurry and keep my word preachers shouldn't lie but anyway talk about just a couple more how many of those when you join the military let's just talk about the chain of the military command how many know that when you go to church when you go to join the military perhaps you're hunchback and you're crippled or whatever he might be hello you think they're gonna accept you why because you'd be a weak link in the chain you'd get somebody killed maybe several of them killed because you can't perform and do what needs to be done to keep every everybody has to be equal strength and so when you join the military they find a i've heard people that you know that had too flat-footed you know all kinds of things that they used to not let you in now of course nowadays you know it's terrible who can go up in there huh how'd you like to join the military amen and have your bunk beds there and find out there's one on top and one on the bottom of your bunk that's transsexual or something all but they just said anything you know that ain't gonna the morals the the morale of the people used to be all of that but now it's terrible isn't it but used to be man it had to be so strong so big not too short and all these other things you know because it's got to meet a criteria so that you don't have a weak spot because people's lives depend on it and i want to tell you something else i believe that's the way it is in a church amen when you've got a weak spot in the church it can cause people to die spiritually backslide because of a stumbling block amen people not being what they're supposed to be amen i hope we can all say lord jesus help me a little bit more tonight to strengthen that weak spot so i don't have a weak spot amen because that's you know i know satan's got a punch coming but brother brahm says that's why you pray so much more over that weak spot amen one more one more illustration beside the military i want to talk about just let's just say a football game take take a football game and you know usually it's a team that doesn't have any weak space places no weak spots in the chain because you all have probably watched football some of you guys have car races some of them maybe this out of the other but i've watched football several times probably won't this year not even kneeling anyway but they better watch them on the internet but anyway so listen so you see these football players you see these teams and when there's one wide receiver that can't keep up with the other wide receiver right in the nfl everybody's lightning fast anyway and if that wide receiver isn't fast enough that's going to be a place that they always use that wide receiver and they're going to throw him and throw him and they're going to be touched down after touchdown because of that one weak place huh so why do you know that's why they always it's amazing sometimes to watch them and to know that they'll come up they'll they'll be right on top of each other the defense one he'll be right there with another offense man and they'll be running and they'll do this or the other and perhaps they'll just jump up and knock the ball up just before he gets down and gets him you know and it's because it's equally matched let me tell you something if you're going to be equally matched with the devil you better not have any weak spots because the devil will absolutely take those weak spots into your life and destroy you with them if you can amen he'll have his victory he has his triumphs over our weak places how many believes that that's brother bam says you know a chain is only as strong as its weakest link amen so i just my it's just a thought that brought brother man i mean the lord jesus christ brought to my heart i thought about brother brown a statement that he made about that that chain that has that weak place and i don't know about you but in my heart i say lord jesus don't let me have a weak spot my brothers and my sisters are counting on me how many believes that we're counting on each other not to have those weak places and to be strong so that the lord can have complete control amen i was going to quit this quarter after i gotta mention this of just a little bit about joshua but abraham when he was talking about this in ephesian sparrows joshua he says you know when they went over and they captured jericho and they went around that city of seven times he says they didn't even need a band-aid that right no band-aids for the fingers usually we have to have amputations we have to have mass burials for all the people that got killed people hack and cut in every which direction and everywhere you can think of in a battle but these didn't even need a band-aid that's how perfect the battle was when there was no sin no weakness and the next one they went up to the ai i believe it was the next battle they fought amen and they were not supposed to take anything no gold no nothing but guess what aitkin took a little wedge of gold and all this other stuff and took it and he hit it and because of that one weak link 34 men or 38 men lost their lives right because of that weak spot amen my wouldn't it be something if they could have keep kept on winning everybody battle never needing a first aid kit never needing a band-aid how many believes that i believe that we can have complete victory in our lives if we'll cover that weak spot and say god make my weak spot stronger amen god bless you tonight let's stand musicians if you'll come
