[19:21] thank you amen appreciate the lord
[19:25] and for his goodness amen and so
[19:29] we want to give a little uh
[19:32] a little report before we get into the
[19:34] message this evening
[19:36] um brother steve langley i he came here
[19:39] this evening
[19:40] uh but he said that sister becky
[19:44] got a text just a few minutes ago that
[19:47] her co-worker had went in
[19:48] she had the sniffles i guess and the
[19:50] cold like symptoms and stuff so she went
[19:52] in and got tested
[19:53] she tested positive for the cobot so
[19:56] that puts brother steven's
[19:58] sister becky pretty much in quarantine
[20:00] for a couple weeks so it's getting
[20:01] pretty close
[20:03] so uh i've got i prayed about it today
[20:06] and i was just kind of
[20:07] trying to feeling the leading the lord
[20:09] and um
[20:10] i thought well maybe we should just have
[20:11] a virtual service tonight you know
[20:13] and so but i didn't i says well we'll
[20:15] have a service tonight and then we'll go
[20:17] from there
[20:18] but uh after brother steve saying that i
[20:20] kind of wondered whether you know i said
[20:22] but anyway so no i think you know
[20:26] uh i know different ones we've got
[20:28] brother brad in them
[20:29] i've got brothers sister hannah and them
[20:31] um
[20:32] you know that are working directly with
[20:34] the patients and everything so
[20:36] it's getting real close if we ever did
[20:38] dismiss services or anything now would
[20:40] be a time amen
[20:42] but i don't want to necessarily dismiss
[20:44] the services but after
[20:46] next week next wednesday and everybody
[20:48] listening on the internet next wednesday
[20:49] we will not have service because i plan
[20:51] on
[20:52] i've wanted to go see brother jewel for
[20:54] a while so i'm going to make a trip down
[20:56] there and see whether jewel probably
[20:57] next week
[20:58] providing they don't have no code right
[21:00] around there but uh anyway
[21:02] so and then after that so there'll be no
[21:04] serve wednesday of service next week but
[21:06] after that
[21:07] and we'll let you know next sunday
[21:09] because this is the kind of thing you
[21:11] just have to kind of play by ear and
[21:12] that's what i've been kind of doing but
[21:14] i think we're at the place to where
[21:16] you know if uh it's okay with everybody
[21:19] on a wednesday night for the next
[21:21] little bit we'll just do the uh the
[21:24] internet service okay
[21:25] so that'll cut our services in half uh
[21:28] but yet we'll have be able to
[21:30] have some kind of service on wednesday
[21:32] because a lot of these a lot of our
[21:33] people is already on
[21:34] on the quarantine and all and so i think
[21:36] that would be a good way to go
[21:38] amen i know when it first went around i
[21:40] disap
[21:41] agreed with it and i wanted to barge on
[21:43] you know and
[21:44] because if you have two or three people
[21:46] or two three thousand in the state of
[21:48] kentucky
[21:49] you know that's not really any reason to
[21:51] cut things back or watch yourself too
[21:53] much
[21:54] but right now as you know it's it's it's
[21:56] out there amen
[21:58] and so is that okay with everybody we'll
[22:00] just plan on doing that
[22:02] we'll uh not have a service next
[22:03] wednesday and then after that
[22:05] we'll go virtual unless i tell you
[22:07] different that's only on a wednesday
[22:09] we will have sunday morning service here
[22:10] okay but again i want to tell anybody if
[22:13] you know you've been in contact with
[22:14] anybody
[22:15] uh be please be courteous it'll be all
[22:17] right the lord will understand if you
[22:19] just stay away a little bit amen
[22:21] you don't want to spread it amen so
[22:23] praise the lord
[22:25] so is that all right all right sounds
[22:28] like a plan
[22:29] so all right let's bow our heads and uh
[22:31] oh another one more thing i don't know
[22:33] the exact
[22:35] uh details yet because we haven't got
[22:37] all the results back but we did get a
[22:39] really good report
[22:41] from sister jeanette and what they found
[22:43] amanda and they didn't say they had
[22:44] found cancer or anything or even that
[22:46] tumor said that there was not that thing
[22:48] down there but she does have a i believe
[22:50] she called it a hernia
[22:52] a hernia that isn't that right that has
[22:54] to be operated on or has to be taken
[22:55] care of but they do have some other
[22:58] stomach lining tests that they've sent
[23:00] vanderbilt i believe to get tests and
[23:01] find out what that is or
[23:02] what they are but uh i mean it's looking
[23:05] good right now so praise the lord amen
[23:07] and so we're rejoicing for that amen and
[23:10] we certainly
[23:11] are praying for sister susan that the
[23:13] lord will just do a miracle for her
[23:15] amen because he is a miracle working god
[23:18] amen everybody doing good good glad to
[23:21] hear it amen so god bless you tonight
[23:23] just have a little thought
[23:24] amen this evening for just a little bit
[23:26] so let's bow our heads be
[23:28] go before the lord kind heavenly father
[23:31] we come before you lord jesus we ask god
[23:33] once again as we meet two or three
[23:35] people that gathered in your name
[23:36] we believe lord jesus that you'll meet
[23:38] in our midst father and that you'll come
[23:40] and that you are here lord
[23:42] and we just pray father that you would
[23:43] give me the ability that's only by the
[23:45] holy spirit to speak to your people to
[23:47] feed them from the word of life
[23:49] we ask god for a special protection for
[23:51] sister becky lord as
[23:52] lord she's been right close to a
[23:54] co-worker father that's had the virus
[23:56] lord you know lord jesus some get it
[23:58] extreme some not extreme that's all in
[24:00] your hands as your prophet has said that
[24:02] all of those things are in your hands
[24:04] lord but we ask god for protection for
[24:06] sister becky and brother steve
[24:08] we ask that you just be with them in a
[24:09] special way father and lord and
[24:11] the others working at the nursing home
[24:13] each one father we ask god you continue
[24:15] to protect them we thank you lord jesus
[24:16] for
[24:17] watching over them so far and we believe
[24:19] that you will continue to do so lord
[24:21] and we just ask god that you just
[24:23] continue to lead us and guide us by your
[24:25] spirit father
[24:26] lord until lord we get to leave this
[24:28] pest house of the world
[24:30] father and we thank you goodness and
[24:31] your mercy we can't tell you how much we
[24:33] love you
[24:34] how great a god you are and as we've
[24:36] heard the prophet say today there's no
[24:38] words in the english vocabulary
[24:40] how do we conform words to express how
[24:42] much we really we just want you to know
[24:44] we really appreciate you father and we
[24:46] ask now father that you just take the
[24:48] words lord jesus i feel
[24:49] you've laid upon my heart to speak on
[24:51] and bless it to somebody's soul father
[24:53] in jesus name
[24:55] amen and amen all right if you will turn
[24:58] to the book of matthew and i will
[25:00] just start with the scripture that i was
[25:01] reading today
[25:03] amen when something kind of struck my
[25:05] heart amen
[25:06] and i begin to just go from there so
[25:10] we want to do a little bible study on
[25:12] what i call
[25:13] secret places secret places
[25:18] amen how many know that god is a
[25:21] secret god amen he is hardly ever seen
[25:26] amen he's hid he hides himself
[25:29] amen and he hides himself in different
[25:32] places
[25:34] and different things we want to look at
[25:36] that and
[25:37] and also tonight's focus is going to be
[25:40] on
[25:43] our hearts and what we are in our secret
[25:47] places
[25:47] amen so in matthew 6 if you want to with
[25:51] me
[25:51] uh i was going to read the whole chapter
[25:53] but i'll probably come back and pick up
[25:55] a few of the scriptures that
[25:57] were spoken of beforehand beforehand
[25:59] here from 1
[26:01] chapter 6 of matthew 1 to 4 but we'll
[26:04] start on
[26:05] verse 5. when thou prayest
[26:08] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[26:11] for they love to pray standing in the
[26:13] synagogues
[26:15] and in the corners of the streets that
[26:17] they may be seen of men
[26:20] verily verily i say or very i say unto
[26:22] you they have
[26:23] their reward but when but thou when thou
[26:26] prayest
[26:27] enter into thy closet and when thou has
[26:30] shut
[26:31] thy door all right here you are in a
[26:34] secret place
[26:35] pray to thy father which is
[26:38] in secret amen
[26:42] so he is in secret
[26:45] and thy father which seeth in secret
[26:49] shall reward thee openly but
[26:53] when thou but when you pray use not vain
[26:55] repetitions as they heathen do
[26:58] for they think that they shall be heard
[27:00] for their much
[27:01] speaking be not ye therefore like unto
[27:04] them for your father
[27:06] knoweth what things you have need of
[27:08] before you ask him
[27:11] after this man i therefore pray ye our
[27:13] father which art in heaven hallowed be
[27:15] thy name
[27:16] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[27:19] earth as it is in heaven
[27:21] give us this day our daily bread and
[27:23] forgive us our debts
[27:24] as we as we forgive our debtors
[27:28] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[27:30] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[27:32] and the power and the glory forever
[27:35] amen notice how jesus picks up on verse
[27:38] 12
[27:40] for the next verse he says and forgive
[27:41] us of our debts as we forgive our
[27:43] debtors
[27:43] then he talks about being led in
[27:45] temptation delivering for people but he
[27:47] picks it back up in verse 14
[27:49] for if you forgive not forgive men their
[27:52] trespasses your heavenly father will
[27:54] also forgive you
[27:56] but if you forgive not mend their
[27:57] trespasses neither will your father
[28:00] forgive your trespasses moreover when
[28:02] you fast be not as the hypocrites of a
[28:05] sad
[28:05] countenance for they disfigure their
[28:07] faces
[28:09] that they may appear unto men the fast
[28:12] verily i say unto you
[28:14] they have their reward but thou went
[28:17] thou
[28:17] fast this anoint thy head and wash thy
[28:20] face
[28:21] that thou appear not unto men to fast
[28:25] but unto thy father which is in secret
[28:28] notice there it says it again
[28:30] your father which is in secret and thy
[28:33] father which seeth
[28:35] in secret shall lay shall reward thee
[28:37] openly amen reward thee openly
[28:39] may god add his blessings to the reading
[28:41] of the word you can be seated this
[28:43] evening
[28:45] amen praise the lord no wonder they
[28:47] could in the old testament just read
[28:50] the scrolls and it would get people
[28:53] excited amen
[28:54] how many knows that sometimes just by
[28:56] the reading of the scrolls and the
[28:58] reading of the word
[28:59] the people would get inspired and they
[29:01] would really go to worshiping the lord
[29:04] amen because we know that when i'm
[29:06] speaking well you might have a question
[29:08] about it
[29:09] but when you're reading the word there's
[29:11] absolutely no question
[29:13] am i right it is absolutely the truth
[29:16] you can absolutely count on it
[29:18] so praise the lord for that so i want to
[29:21] look at this for just a minute
[29:22] it talks about how that first of all
[29:25] he's talking about
[29:26] prayer he talks about uh
[29:31] fasting isn't that right he talks about
[29:33] fasting and in
[29:35] verse one he also talks about doing alms
[29:37] talks about
[29:38] several things that he tells us to do in
[29:41] secret because our heavenly father
[29:44] amen he is in a secret place amen
[29:49] there's something about those places
[29:50] those getaway places
[29:53] amen i believe it's where we get molded
[29:56] it's where we get
[29:57] shaped it it is um
[30:01] a molding place you know because most of
[30:04] the time
[30:04] a lot of times if you aren't careful as
[30:06] a preacher
[30:08] amen you'll preach to please the people
[30:10] or you'll be in the public and you'll do
[30:12] it for
[30:13] perhaps whatever reason you know the
[30:15] wrong reason
[30:16] same as if you would ask a person to
[30:18] come up here and pray well
[30:20] most of the time all of us know that
[30:22] person will probably try to pray our
[30:24] good prayer
[30:26] because he's in front of everybody right
[30:28] and everybody's hearing him and so you
[30:30] know sometimes we get that in our mind
[30:32] and
[30:32] automatically you know you get into the
[30:34] mode of you know
[30:35] let me pray a prayer you know maybe
[30:37] that's impressive
[30:39] it's our human nature let me know it's a
[30:41] really prayer prayer
[30:42] that's not not what we're to do brother
[30:45] branham even told us how to pray
[30:47] amen remember he says when you get up
[30:49] i'm not sure if it was in front of the
[30:51] people there in a church
[30:52] might have been what he was talking
[30:54] about in church maybe in church order
[30:56] conduct order and doctrine some of y'all
[30:57] might notice remember this more than me
[30:59] but
[30:59] he just specified he says when you get
[31:01] up when you pray for something
[31:03] especially for your food or whatever
[31:04] don't pray for the governor of the satan
[31:06] for this and that yeah i mean
[31:08] are you with me tonight oh y'all
[31:10] remember that says you know because you
[31:12] don't
[31:12] don't you know you can do that in your
[31:14] closet you know come up and
[31:15] ask the blessing upon the service and
[31:17] this out of the other the needs whatever
[31:19] it is you know
[31:20] you know but it isn't about being drawn
[31:22] out
[31:27] so how many realizes tonight that god
[31:30] doesn't like
[31:31] put on he don't like you know you don't
[31:35] like uh
[31:36] you know uh somebody that's putting on a
[31:38] show
[31:39] he wasn't one to put on a show the
[31:42] prophet of god never put on a show he
[31:44] was all just
[31:45] he was always himself and i'll tell you
[31:48] what any preacher or anybody that really
[31:50] if you're going to be a christian the
[31:51] best
[31:51] the way that's the way to be the your
[31:53] best is to be yourself
[31:56] just be what god made you it isn't about
[31:59] great swelling words it's not about long
[32:02] prayers or
[32:03] you know you know and most of the time
[32:06] you find that people that are like that
[32:08] have pride huh there's pride in there
[32:14] you know and pride really disfigures you
[32:17] you know it just makes you look like a
[32:19] fool a lot of times
[32:21] but i don't do nothing for you humility
[32:24] does
[32:25] i mean god dwells in humility he hides
[32:28] himself in simplicity
[32:30] hides himself in humility hides himself
[32:33] in the secret place
[32:34] he says when you pray you know don't go
[32:36] out there in the streets like the
[32:37] pharisees did
[32:38] the pharisees the hypocrites they went
[32:40] out there and then maybe a bigger be the
[32:42] big drum says everybody we're gonna pray
[32:45] now
[32:47] not in heaven we prayed ideal just get
[32:50] everybody to repent
[32:51] and turn from their wicked ways well
[32:54] maybe you need to turn from your we get
[32:55] way of being an immigrant
[32:59] you know and it's just all hypocrisy
[33:01] it's all just a show
[33:03] and so you know that's what they were
[33:05] doing that's what jesus said they do you
[33:06] know and
[33:07] he says you know whatever you put on a
[33:09] show whenever you do that
[33:11] artificially you got your reward
[33:14] you know and you know how does it say it
[33:18] says
[33:19] i tell you they have their reward and he
[33:21] says that you're
[33:22] that's not even going to give him a
[33:23] reward over there so it's the thing that
[33:26] we do
[33:26] in secret that god sees and so
[33:30] i guess if i was to make a statement
[33:32] tonight it would be
[33:34] you are what you are in your secret
[33:37] place
[33:40] when you're all by yourself nobody else
[33:44] around
[33:45] huh you are what you are at that time
[33:51] you're as strong as you are at that time
[33:55] that's when god's looking because how
[33:57] many knows god never quits looking
[34:00] amen maybe when you do something bad he
[34:01] will but listen he always sees what you
[34:04] do
[34:05] amen there's nothing hidden from god
[34:09] and he loves you know and i might say
[34:12] that god might hear
[34:13] prayers that are said out loud but he
[34:16] especially hears prayers
[34:18] that are even prayed quietly
[34:22] huh because we know that he knows the
[34:24] thoughts of our mind
[34:27] you know he said right there he says you
[34:28] know don't
[34:30] use vain repetition you know
[34:33] and i remember i we always used vain
[34:35] repetition at home
[34:37] the amish there some of the worst for
[34:39] using vain revenue we have a
[34:40] prayer book and my dad and it was always
[34:44] nice i don't care if it's
[34:45] even repetition it's always good to get
[34:47] on your knees and my mom and dad and
[34:49] we'd always have a habit of getting on
[34:51] our knees in the evening and in the
[34:52] morning
[34:53] and dad would read out of the prayer
[34:54] book and it'd be a long prayer
[34:57] um
[35:07] children forgave him and sinners on and
[35:09] on and on and on and it was all german
[35:11] high german
[35:12] you know and i did it's a prayer you
[35:14] know at least you're praying but
[35:16] don't do a good when you do that same
[35:18] one every morning
[35:19] same one every evening and he says don't
[35:21] be written and the prophet even taught
[35:23] us you know what he told us
[35:24] he's not like the catholics that have a
[35:26] repetitious and always reputation
[35:29] but he's brother brahm taught us he says
[35:31] when you pray pray from down here you
[35:33] ain't fully
[35:34] god everybody knows your heart he
[35:37] already knows what you have need of
[35:40] amen so just be real
[35:43] amen i like this because he says listen
[35:47] pray you know in your closet one place
[35:51] it says enter into thy closet
[35:56] amen and you ain't even got to tell
[35:59] anybody you go into the closet
[36:02] just get away somewhere brother venom
[36:04] how many knows brother branham had his
[36:06] secret place
[36:07] called the cave and he would go there
[36:10] and that was his secret place
[36:12] nobody could ever find it and when he
[36:14] went to talk to the lord he'd go
[36:16] spend a day or two
[36:21] let's just soak that in real good
[36:23] brother jeff wouldn't it be nice
[36:25] if we'd say hey i'm gonna be gone for
[36:27] two days you know you won't see me
[36:30] don't never mind where i'm going i'm
[36:31] just gonna be gone you gotta know what
[36:33] i'm doing
[36:33] but i'm going to pray you know just go
[36:37] talk to the lord for a day or two how
[36:39] many believes you do it's good
[36:42] you do is real good i believe you get
[36:45] further with god if you take more time
[36:48] and pray because you know sometimes you
[36:51] know you go and you pray like that and
[36:52] sometimes it'd be a long time before the
[36:54] lord had even come or the angel lord
[36:55] come to brother madam
[36:58] how many believe you ought to have your
[36:59] secret place you ought to have your
[37:00] secret place
[37:01] same as the family altar brother bam
[37:02] says you ought to have your family altar
[37:05] you got to have in the mornings you have
[37:07] your time of prayer and so forth your
[37:08] family other you all
[37:09] have that you ought to have your own
[37:10] secret place in your own secret time
[37:12] that you go with the lord because that's
[37:14] what god is looking for
[37:16] he's looking for the sincerity of our
[37:18] hearts he's looking for how real
[37:20] we are amen in our places of quiet in
[37:23] places of what we call our time me time
[37:27] or rather
[37:28] let that be time that you spent with god
[37:29] and i tell you what you'll be a better
[37:31] person
[37:32] you'll be a better christian because
[37:34] that's where you draw your resources
[37:36] how many believes that that's like you
[37:38] know uh
[37:40] to draw your resources that's where you
[37:41] get your power from
[37:43] it's your prayer life it's your
[37:44] communion life with god it's that
[37:46] secret place god loves secret places
[37:52] amen god made himself so mysterious
[37:57] until guess what even him and his
[37:59] existence
[38:00] was a mystery to people for thousands of
[38:04] years
[38:05] his very being was a mystery to people
[38:09] because he hid himself huh
[38:12] i mean i was about even jesus said
[38:14] talking about revelation says
[38:15] you know i thank thee father for you
[38:17] have hid thee things
[38:19] from the eyes of the wise and prebuden
[38:21] and then revealed unto babes such as
[38:23] would learn
[38:25] the mystery of godliness the mystery of
[38:28] christ
[38:28] all of those things that things even god
[38:31] himself
[38:32] hides himself so now let's
[38:35] look talking about prayer he says you
[38:38] know if you go in there
[38:39] and you pray you ask god some for
[38:43] something he says
[38:45] notice your father which is
[38:49] in secret and thy father which seeth
[38:54] in secret shall rework thee openly
[39:00] amen i believe that's when you're really
[39:02] getting somewhere
[39:05] amen nobody knows just you and him
[39:09] all alone by yourself praying
[39:12] of course we know it doesn't hurt other
[39:14] believers around you have a prayer
[39:16] meeting pray
[39:16] god will hear all that sure but some of
[39:19] the most special times according to the
[39:21] scripture
[39:22] is when you are by yourself alone
[39:24] somewhere and you have a talk with
[39:27] god talk it over with him
[39:30] and then watch god answer you not
[39:33] privately
[39:35] but answer you openly
[39:38] praise the lord
[39:43] because you know how many knows there is
[39:46] absolutely
[39:47] nothing hidden from god over in matthew
[39:51] 10
[39:51] and verse 25 he was talking about
[39:56] it says it is enough for his disciple
[39:58] for the disciple to be as his master
[40:00] and the servant as his lord if they have
[40:03] called the master of the house be
[40:04] aldebar how much more shall they call
[40:06] them of his household fear them not
[40:08] therefore for there is nothing covered
[40:12] that shall not be revealed and hid
[40:16] all right there's nothing here that
[40:19] shall not
[40:20] be made known
[40:23] huh so how many knows that nobody is
[40:27] hiding anything from god
[40:31] no
[40:34] you know even job how many knows that
[40:38] job
[40:39] was accused of being a secret
[40:42] sinner a secret sinner
[40:48] now he believes that probably a lot of
[40:50] those in the world
[40:52] there's a lot of people that claim to be
[40:55] christians but secretly they're sinners
[40:59] huh maybe nobody ever knows about maybe
[41:02] never even finds out about it but god
[41:04] knows
[41:05] you're not fooling god
[41:09] and they'll accuse you because of all
[41:11] the troubles
[41:13] that he had on him
[41:16] amen because of all the bad things that
[41:19] happened to him
[41:23] his friends said hey you know joe
[41:27] you got to have some secrets in
[41:29] somewhere
[41:30] that's why this curse is on you because
[41:34] it looked like a curse right
[41:35] it looked like it i'm the powerful hand
[41:38] of almighty god
[41:40] correcting job but no job knew in his
[41:44] heart right
[41:45] he knew in his heart that he had made
[41:47] sacrifice
[41:48] that he had made prayer that he had done
[41:50] everything that god had required
[41:52] and perhaps more because he would make
[41:54] sacrifices for his children
[41:57] just in case they sin
[42:01] i hope every one of us as parents do
[42:04] that for our children
[42:06] huh if my children lord have sinned
[42:10] please forgive them lord that's making a
[42:12] sacrifice for your children say god
[42:14] forgive them draw them closer to you
[42:15] lord ask for your sin
[42:17] ask for the sins of your son or your
[42:20] daughters or whoever it is
[42:22] make sacrifice for because we want
[42:24] everything clear
[42:26] you know right but job is accused of
[42:28] being a
[42:29] secret sinner but come to find out he
[42:32] wasn't amen
[42:33] it was just that god had a lot of
[42:35] confidence in job
[42:38] amen all right so he says there's
[42:41] nothing
[42:42] hidden that isn't going to be made known
[42:45] and so forth
[42:47] all right let's look at chapter six
[42:50] again a little bit further can we
[42:53] so it says on down it talks about that
[42:56] when you fast
[42:58] amen don't do like the hypocrites
[43:01] he says they actually disfigure their
[43:04] faces
[43:06] wow i
[43:10] don't know what this figure perhaps
[43:13] put sackcloths in the ashes maybe
[43:15] they'll just put ash all over them
[43:17] you know and ruffle their hair all up
[43:20] and just
[43:20] you know
[43:25] see if everybody's looking yeah
[43:29] right well that's what he said they do
[43:31] it for a show
[43:32] they make themselves look like they're
[43:33] oh they're pious
[43:36] huh they're so pious they're so
[43:39] religious
[43:41] but yet they do it they've been seeing a
[43:42] man jesus says no no no no
[43:44] anoint your help
[43:47] your head with oil isn't that right and
[43:50] and
[43:51] smell good huh
[43:54] don't smell like a skunk don't look like
[43:57] a hideous heinous
[43:59] whatever you know by disfiguring your
[44:01] face and looking hideous
[44:03] no but look good look clean
[44:06] you know and don't even let them know
[44:08] you're doing the fast
[44:11] hey brother sister no i can't eat this
[44:16] oh you just lost your reward because you
[44:18] done
[44:19] wanted somebody that well yay brother
[44:21] yay
[44:22] you're awesome you're really wonderful
[44:25] great for you
[44:26] hey you had your reward god says forget
[44:28] it that's not what i'm looking for
[44:31] secretly in your heart to do it for the
[44:34] lord
[44:35] how many believes the lord really really
[44:37] likes it
[44:38] when you do things secretly that nobody
[44:41] else knows about it
[44:43] for him do it
[44:46] for the lord as unto the lord secretly
[44:50] and not for show and not for wanting to
[44:52] be popular
[44:53] or whatever it might be god really likes
[44:56] that
[44:57] how many believe that you can't do
[44:59] anything for the lord
[45:02] that he don't see that he doesn't really
[45:04] appreciate
[45:06] praise the lord so he says they
[45:07] disfigure their faces
[45:09] barely i say unto you they have that
[45:12] their reward but when thou fast anoint
[45:15] on head with oil and
[45:16] wash thy face that thou appear not
[45:19] unto men to fast in other words they
[45:22] can't notice it
[45:23] but unto thy father which is in
[45:27] secret how many believes that that's
[45:31] where god's supposed to be is down in
[45:32] that secret place of the heart
[45:35] right there he's in that secret place
[45:38] a quiet place that's where god is
[45:44] amen and thy father which seeth
[45:48] in secret shall reward thee
[45:51] openly praise be to god
[45:55] amen so we see that god
[45:58] is a god that is in secret
[46:02] he dwells in secret place
[46:06] amen in a secret place he is
[46:09] hid god is hid even to the world today
[46:13] you know that he is hid
[46:16] and let me just say this that actually
[46:18] god is hid to
[46:19] everyone that he hasn't revealed himself
[46:22] to huh
[46:26] because as i was saying sunday like
[46:29] like jesus said about peter he says
[46:31] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[46:33] you but my father which is in heaven
[46:35] has revealed this to you am i right
[46:39] so whenever god begins to show himself
[46:42] he dwells in secret let's follow on that
[46:44] for a little bit god dwells in secret
[46:46] he dwells in places that people don't
[46:48] even recognize that he is
[46:51] but god dwells somehow how maybe god
[46:53] dwells somewhere
[46:54] sure he does but as i was saying
[47:00] he said to peter his flesh and blood has
[47:02] not revealed this to you
[47:03] and moses had a mother that taught him
[47:07] the bible
[47:08] every day he had a mother that would
[47:11] teach him
[47:12] everything about the bible but he didn't
[47:15] have a personal revelation of it did he
[47:18] because his mama was flesh and blood
[47:20] revealing it to him and that right
[47:22] flesh and blood teaching it to him but
[47:26] he needed something more than that
[47:29] am i right sure he needed something more
[47:32] than that and
[47:32] on the back side of the desert brother
[47:34] man said he learned more in five minutes
[47:36] time in the presence of god
[47:38] then he had learned all down in the down
[47:41] his whole
[47:41] life he learned more right there
[47:45] because why revealed himself to him amen
[47:49] moses got a hold of something that he
[47:51] could never be
[47:52] stopped after amen
[47:56] that's just like amen a person that
[47:59] perhaps is raised in a message and you
[48:01] hear it
[48:02] and you hear it you hear about salvation
[48:04] you hear about the new birth
[48:06] you hear about the infilling of the holy
[48:07] ghost but if you ever
[48:09] experience it huh
[48:12] it's no more mama's experience that is
[48:15] experienced
[48:16] it's yours experience it's god making
[48:18] himself known to you and that's where
[48:20] brother brahm said that even the new
[48:22] birth is a revelation
[48:24] how many knows that even the new birth
[48:26] is a revelation
[48:27] god revealing himself to you and he said
[48:30] that's faith
[48:31] faith is a revelation amen because when
[48:34] he reveals him tell you it
[48:35] absolutely builds your faith to know
[48:38] that god is real
[48:39] praise the lord so we see you in
[48:42] acts in the book of acts
[48:46] i'm just going to read something here
[48:48] talking about
[48:50] how did god for how many knows that god
[48:52] for about 4 000 years he was very
[48:54] mysterious to people
[48:56] very mysterious god they see him in the
[48:58] pillar of fire
[48:59] they seen him by a cloud by the day
[49:02] pillar of fire at night
[49:03] moses heard him talking out of the bush
[49:05] and so forth
[49:07] but they really wondered who this was
[49:09] and even even the disciples it was a
[49:11] mystery god was even a mystery to the
[49:13] disciples while jesus was walking with
[49:15] him
[49:16] amen and i want to pick that up here in
[49:19] a minute about the greeks that came and
[49:20] wanted to see jesus and they want to see
[49:22] him
[49:22] but in acts 17 i want to read you where
[49:26] these and like some of these words i
[49:27] can't
[49:28] pronounce so i'm going to try the best i
[49:31] can
[49:31] act 17 let's do a little reading here
[49:36] let me talk about paul
[49:41] at athens
[49:48] in verse 16 now while paul waited for
[49:50] them at athens
[49:53] 17 chapter 17 verse 16.
[49:56] now paul waited for them at athens his
[49:58] spirit was stirred in him
[50:00] when he saw the city holy give it holy
[50:02] give it to idolatry
[50:04] therefore disputed here in the synagogue
[50:06] with the jews and with the devout
[50:07] persons and in the market
[50:09] daily with them that met with him then
[50:12] certain philosophers of the
[50:15] epicreans and of the s
[50:19] stocks encountered him and some said
[50:23] what will this babbler say others
[50:27] some he seemeth to be of some said or
[50:30] fourth
[50:31] of strange gods because he preaches unto
[50:35] them
[50:35] jesus and the resurrection and they took
[50:38] him and brought him
[50:39] unto araga arapagas
[50:42] saying may we know what this new
[50:44] doctrine whereof thou speakest is
[50:47] for that bring us certain strange things
[50:50] to our ears
[50:51] and we know we would know thereof what
[50:53] these things mean
[50:55] notice the parentheses in verse 21
[50:59] for all the our athens
[51:02] and strangers which were there spent
[51:04] their time in nothing else
[51:06] but to either tell or hear
[51:10] some new thing then paul stood in the
[51:13] midst of mars hill
[51:14] and said you men of athens i perceive
[51:18] that
[51:18] all things in all things you are
[51:22] too superstitious for as i passed by
[51:26] i beheld your devotions and i found an
[51:28] altar with this inscription
[51:30] to the unknown god see that's about as
[51:33] much as the people knew about
[51:35] god a new to god somewhere but he's
[51:37] unknown he's a mystery
[51:40] they still don't know who he is what he
[51:42] is what he's like
[51:44] amen whom therefore he ignorantly
[51:48] him declare i am
[51:51] to you in other words let me show you
[51:54] who this
[51:54] unknown mysterious hidden god is
[51:58] amen praise the lord
[52:03] i mean aren't you glad that through
[52:04] jesus christ we can know who god really
[52:06] is
[52:07] amen because he was perfectly expressed
[52:10] in jesus
[52:11] so he says now notice god that made the
[52:14] world and all the things therein
[52:16] seeing that he is lord of heaven and
[52:17] earth dwelleth not in temples
[52:20] made with hands neither is worship with
[52:23] men's hands
[52:25] as though he needed anything seeing that
[52:27] he giveth to all life and breath
[52:30] and all things praise the lord
[52:33] i like that the lord of heavens
[52:37] and earth amen notice he describes him
[52:39] as the creator
[52:42] and all things that have made of one
[52:43] blood all nations of men for to dwell
[52:46] on all the face of the earth and has
[52:48] determined
[52:49] the times before appointed
[52:51] predestination
[52:53] and the bounds of the habitation
[52:54] sometimes paul will use
[52:57] great wisdom in the way that he brings
[52:59] it before the people
[53:01] that they should seek the lord if haply
[53:03] they might feel after him
[53:05] and find him amen how many knows the
[53:08] lord wants you to find him he wants you
[53:10] to seek for him
[53:12] and to look for him amen isn't that what
[53:15] we do a lot of times in prayer
[53:17] that's what brother bam says i'm going
[53:18] out to the lord i'm seeking the lord and
[53:21] and i'm going to go out there and just
[53:23] pray and pray until the lord comes you
[53:25] know
[53:25] he was seeking the lord amen and find
[53:28] him though he be not far
[53:30] from every one of us for in him we live
[53:33] and move and have our being
[53:37] let's all read that together for in him
[53:41] we live and move and have our
[53:44] being how many believes that's really
[53:46] being in god
[53:49] in him we live we move we have our being
[53:52] as certain also of our own poets have
[53:54] said
[53:55] for we are also his offspring
[54:00] for as much then as ye are the
[54:01] offsprings of god we ought not to think
[54:04] that the godhead is like unto gold or
[54:05] silver
[54:06] or stone graven by art and man's devices
[54:09] tell them to get rid of their
[54:11] idolatry and the times of this ignorance
[54:15] god winked at but now commandeth all men
[54:18] everywhere to repent i like that that
[54:21] was paul preaching there at
[54:22] athens saying man right now he's calling
[54:24] on all of you to repent just like
[54:27] what um jonah did at nineveh
[54:30] told him to repent or perish here paul
[54:32] is saying it's now time god's calling
[54:35] you all to repent
[54:36] this unknown god that y'all don't know
[54:38] really who is
[54:39] i'm telling you who he is
[54:42] because he had the point of today into
[54:44] which
[54:45] notice he talks about judgment brings
[54:47] judgment judgment day
[54:49] because he has appointed a day into
[54:52] which he will judge the world
[54:54] in righteousness by that man whom he has
[54:58] ordained doesn't really come out and say
[54:59] jesus yet does he
[55:01] by the man whom he has ordained whereof
[55:03] he has given
[55:04] assurance unto all men
[55:07] in that he has raised him from the dead
[55:11] that's right he's been preaching that
[55:12] jesus god raised christ from the dead
[55:14] wrote you so he's saying this is your
[55:16] assurance that he's going to judge the
[55:18] world by jesus christ
[55:21] the one that he has raised from the dead
[55:24] and he has given the assurance of it
[55:25] because he raised him from the dead
[55:27] and when they heard heard of the
[55:28] resurrection of the dead yeah some
[55:30] mocked
[55:30] and others said we will hear thee again
[55:33] of this
[55:34] matter some of them stayed with him and
[55:37] the others departed
[55:39] that was his message to them people
[55:41] right there
[55:42] amen how many knows a plan of god
[55:47] it was also hidden
[55:50] amen and you and i
[55:53] see more of it know more of it than
[55:56] anybody has in any other generation
[56:00] huh because those seven hidden
[56:04] mysteries have been revealed
[56:07] the plan of god is a secret it's been a
[56:09] secret
[56:10] from the foundation of the world it was
[56:13] a secret
[56:15] and even though paul brings out
[56:17] something here that i want to read over
[56:18] in
[56:19] if you go with me in uh let me see which
[56:22] one
[56:23] i want to read first
[56:27] let's go to ephesians 3.
[56:30] ephesians 3 what i want to
[56:34] my thought on this is that god is making
[56:37] everything known through
[56:41] not the political world not
[56:44] necessarily the denominational church
[56:47] world
[56:48] but the manifold wisdom of god is made
[56:51] known
[56:52] by and through the church
[56:56] amen
[56:59] all right let's um let's start
[57:02] with verse 1.
[57:06] for this cause i paul the prisoner of
[57:08] jesus christ for you gentiles
[57:11] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[57:13] grace of god which is given to me to you
[57:15] words
[57:16] in other words if you've heard my story
[57:18] of the grace that god showed me
[57:20] on the damascus road all right how that
[57:23] by revelation he made known unto me the
[57:25] mystery where as i wrote before in few
[57:28] words told him a little bit about before
[57:31] whereby when you read you may understand
[57:33] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[57:36] which in other ages was not made known
[57:39] unto the sons of men
[57:41] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[57:43] apostles
[57:44] and prophets by the spirit that the
[57:47] gentiles
[57:48] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[57:51] body
[57:51] and partakers of his promise in christ
[57:54] by the gentiles
[57:55] and he was letting them know that hey
[57:56] the gentiles are part of this too
[57:59] how many is happy for that tonight
[58:01] because you and i are a gentile
[58:04] we are born gentiles but john we'd be
[58:07] having clubs on our back according to
[58:08] the probably god
[58:10] long-haired clubs on our back beating
[58:11] each other up you know
[58:13] just a bunch of heathens either
[58:16] worshiping
[58:17] huh isn't it something that you know
[58:21] in the old testament and and you know
[58:24] how did he
[58:25] he had chosen israel right he had chosen
[58:28] that was his chosen nation and everybody
[58:30] else was gentiles
[58:31] they were all heathens but god chose
[58:33] that little thing but
[58:34] after the death of christ he opened it
[58:36] up for
[58:37] all of mankind amen
[58:41] i'm thankful for that tonight aren't you
[58:43] if god had mercy on whosoever will
[58:46] let him come amen so god loves
[58:50] all humanity not just the jews but all
[58:52] of humanity he loves
[58:55] amen thank you lord amen thank you lord
[59:00] all right so now let's look at this that
[59:02] the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[59:04] and of the same body whereof i was made
[59:08] administered according to the gift of
[59:09] the grace of god
[59:10] given unto me by the effectual working
[59:13] of his power
[59:14] unto me who am less than the leaked of
[59:18] all saints
[59:20] how many knows paul had the right spirit
[59:22] he didn't think he was better than
[59:23] everybody else
[59:25] he called himself the least of all
[59:27] saints and yet in that time we all know
[59:28] he was the greatest
[59:30] and there i wrote almost the whole new
[59:33] testament
[59:35] amen he was above peter
[59:38] because he put peter in his place amen
[59:42] all right and lisa to say is this grace
[59:45] given that i should preach among the
[59:47] gentiles
[59:48] the unsearchable riches of christ and to
[59:52] make
[59:52] all men to see what is the fellowship of
[59:55] the mystery in other words that you
[59:56] could
[59:57] look behind and that you could see what
[1:00:00] was hidden before
[1:00:02] which from the beginning of the world
[1:00:04] has been hid
[1:00:06] in god amen
[1:00:10] hidden god who created all things
[1:00:14] by jesus christ to the intent that now
[1:00:18] unto the principalities and powers in
[1:00:20] heavenly places
[1:00:22] might be made known by the church
[1:00:25] the manifold wisdom of god
[1:00:28] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:00:36] people have a hard time identifying
[1:00:39] themselves who they
[1:00:41] are where they belong who they want to
[1:00:44] be
[1:00:47] the unveiling of god at the end of it
[1:00:50] brother bam
[1:00:51] talks about how that the unbeliever
[1:00:53] doesn't see
[1:00:56] what where god is veiled they make fun
[1:00:58] of us and so forth
[1:00:59] they make fun of the sisters long-haired
[1:01:01] brothers the way they do and so forth
[1:01:03] but they're failing to see where god is
[1:01:05] veiled
[1:01:06] but you know when i was reading this
[1:01:08] when i thought about this
[1:01:10] how that all the mysteries of god all
[1:01:13] the hidden things
[1:01:15] of god has been made known
[1:01:18] not by the us government not by the
[1:01:22] king of england but by the church
[1:01:25] of the living god amen how many is
[1:01:28] thankful
[1:01:29] to know the manifold wisdom of god
[1:01:32] whether it's the godhead whether it's
[1:01:34] serpent seed whether it's predestination
[1:01:36] whether it's whether your name is on the
[1:01:37] book or not and so forth
[1:01:38] all those mysteries have all been made
[1:01:40] known
[1:01:41] by the church it's not hidden anymore
[1:01:44] not here anymore god has made it known
[1:01:47] it's something that he would hide it for
[1:01:48] as long as what he did
[1:01:50] now paul talking here you know he talked
[1:01:52] about how the gentiles would come in
[1:01:54] now let me look at another one but let
[1:01:57] me uh
[1:01:59] uh let me read this here's quote before
[1:02:01] i go into my last scripture of the night
[1:02:06] because people have always wanted to see
[1:02:09] god
[1:02:10] even the disciples wondered who this
[1:02:12] father was isn't that right
[1:02:14] and then brother bam talked about the
[1:02:16] greeks that wanted to see him
[1:02:18] all right they wanted to see god
[1:02:22] and they came to jesus and he says now
[1:02:25] notice the very words that jesus
[1:02:27] reported back to them
[1:02:28] all right philip and the other ones they
[1:02:31] got stirred up listen these people they
[1:02:32] got stirred up they were very
[1:02:34] i wanted to go into all of that but it
[1:02:35] was people that were the greeks and so
[1:02:37] forth they did a lot of studying they
[1:02:39] had a lot of
[1:02:40] uh teaching and all of that stuff all
[1:02:43] the modern stuff but they were had
[1:02:45] something in their heart stirred because
[1:02:46] they had heard about jesus and the
[1:02:48] miracles that he was doing so
[1:02:50] they wanted to go see him and when they
[1:02:52] come to jesus he reported back to them
[1:02:54] for they come to see who he was and they
[1:02:57] could not see him
[1:02:58] he says they seem to form huh
[1:03:02] i mean they looked at jesus they looked
[1:03:04] at his body
[1:03:06] they seemed to form
[1:03:09] but he was in his temple god
[1:03:13] was in his temple and he was veiled
[1:03:16] in human flesh in other words he was hid
[1:03:20] in the human flesh and he
[1:03:24] tells these greeks what does he say he
[1:03:27] says
[1:03:27] unless a corn of fall in the ground
[1:03:30] it abideth alone
[1:03:37] now i'd be uh to be totally honest with
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:40] i don't believe them greeks had a clue
[1:03:42] what this man was talking about
[1:03:44] a corn of wheat falling in the grind and
[1:03:46] abiding alone
[1:03:48] huh probably in their mind
[1:03:51] it was well yeah we're pretty smart
[1:03:54] we know that hey you got to put a piece
[1:03:56] of corn in the ground
[1:03:58] or it'll abide by itself and then it'll
[1:04:00] bring forth yeah we know that much
[1:04:02] but they didn't get the true picture of
[1:04:03] what christ was saying
[1:04:05] in other words he was saying if you
[1:04:07] really want to see me
[1:04:09] here's your parable
[1:04:12] amen all right let me go on
[1:04:16] here's your parable and die
[1:04:20] it abides alone and the hour is come and
[1:04:22] it will soon
[1:04:23] be that the son of man will be glorified
[1:04:26] and he must pass
[1:04:27] from this earth and except this hour
[1:04:30] comes you'll never be able to see it
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:38] here why they couldn't understand they
[1:04:40] couldn't why
[1:04:41] why he couldn't couldn't to see jesus
[1:04:43] because
[1:04:44] he was masked god was
[1:04:48] masked the greeks wanted to see a god
[1:04:51] and here he was but they couldn't see
[1:04:53] him
[1:04:53] because he was because of the veil but
[1:04:56] the man says that's the same thing
[1:04:59] today they can't see him
[1:05:02] because of the veil
[1:05:05] it's over their face those greeks were
[1:05:08] masked
[1:05:09] or jesus was masked to those greece he
[1:05:12] said except the corner of wheat fall in
[1:05:13] the ground
[1:05:14] it abides alone they couldn't understand
[1:05:17] how
[1:05:18] why they couldn't see him they stood
[1:05:20] there stood a man
[1:05:22] they come to see god and they seen a man
[1:05:25] they couldn't see god but god was veiled
[1:05:27] to them
[1:05:28] now keep that in your mind god was
[1:05:31] veiled in a
[1:05:32] man they could say man no man can do the
[1:05:36] works
[1:05:36] except to be of god nobody can do it
[1:05:39] their sins are man and yet the works
[1:05:40] were manifested see but they couldn't
[1:05:42] understand
[1:05:43] that god was will listen he says he's
[1:05:46] veiled brother brahm says now
[1:05:48] he's veiled in a man
[1:05:52] he as he always was veiled
[1:05:55] but god was veiled to them he was in
[1:05:58] his human temple god was in a human
[1:06:02] temple
[1:06:03] now be very careful because he's the
[1:06:06] same
[1:06:07] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:10] how many knows that when you listen to
[1:06:12] the unnailing of god
[1:06:13] there is nothing
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] blessed and began veil in human flesh
[1:06:21] manifesting himself and all they seen
[1:06:24] was a kentuckian
[1:06:28] a hillbilly that's all they saw most
[1:06:31] people but there was so much more
[1:06:33] because god was veiled in the man
[1:06:37] amen how many believe that we got to be
[1:06:40] careful
[1:06:41] that you don't miss god because you do
[1:06:44] not see him in the temple
[1:06:46] that he failed in
[1:06:49] amen you got to watch what you do how
[1:06:52] many knows you got to watch how you
[1:06:54] treat each other because
[1:06:55] god is in his temple i mean
[1:06:59] god is in his temple and everybody that
[1:07:02] has the holy ghost
[1:07:04] is his temple amen
[1:07:09] praise the lord the world don't see it
[1:07:14] and as i was saying a while ago never
[1:07:16] finished my thought talking about people
[1:07:18] not wanting and not knowing who they are
[1:07:19] and what they are
[1:07:20] i tell you what right now if you know
[1:07:22] that you're a son of god and this has
[1:07:24] been revealed to you and showed to you
[1:07:27] god has made himself known to you you're
[1:07:28] the most blessed person on the face of
[1:07:30] the earth
[1:07:31] there's no greater honor that you can
[1:07:33] have no greater honor can be bestowed
[1:07:36] upon you for you to believe that you're
[1:07:37] a son and daughter of god
[1:07:39] and this that you are part of the plan
[1:07:41] of god
[1:07:42] amen not the bad part so it's not
[1:07:46] not not not what's predestinated you
[1:07:48] know
[1:07:49] uh unto wrath because there's that's
[1:07:52] that too but
[1:07:52] you're predestinated to be a son and
[1:07:54] daughter of god
[1:07:56] folks i'm telling you what there's no
[1:07:58] reproach that i won't take
[1:08:00] there's nothing that i wouldn't do just
[1:08:02] to be identified with that amen
[1:08:05] praise the lord but anyway so listen
[1:08:07] though he says now notice
[1:08:08] how many knows it was the way that they
[1:08:10] treated the lord
[1:08:12] so i got wrote down here watch how you
[1:08:13] treat each other amen
[1:08:15] as you have done unto the least of these
[1:08:18] you have done unto me
[1:08:20] how many believes that as you do a child
[1:08:22] of god i believe that's where the
[1:08:25] squeeze comes i believe that's where the
[1:08:26] trick is and
[1:08:28] recognizing that god is still in human
[1:08:31] flesh
[1:08:31] in each other amen and if you have the
[1:08:34] holy spirit you'll be careful
[1:08:36] amen to always it may treat each other
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:40] amen okay so now notice
[1:08:45] he says god is always veiled amen today
[1:08:48] and forever god hiding himself in
[1:08:50] simplicity
[1:08:51] yet hiding himself from the world yet he
[1:08:54] was veiled to the world
[1:08:56] but those around him that were
[1:08:57] predestinated could see but as he says
[1:08:59] notice the greek says we would see jesus
[1:09:00] and he says a corner of wheat has to die
[1:09:02] and fall
[1:09:03] you have to die to your own ideas you
[1:09:05] have to get out of your own thoughts
[1:09:07] like those disciples they couldn't
[1:09:08] explain about eating the flesh and blood
[1:09:10] of the son of god but they were
[1:09:11] convinced that he was the son of the
[1:09:13] living god
[1:09:15] amen so he says listen he has to die we
[1:09:18] realize that jesus had to die is that
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:21] because when he died on the day of
[1:09:23] pentecost
[1:09:24] many more he wasn't alone anymore
[1:09:28] if you really wanted to see jesus it was
[1:09:30] when he was in his body
[1:09:31] amen doing the same works he did before
[1:09:35] praise the lord how many believes that
[1:09:37] jesus christ
[1:09:38] the son of god is a secret place the
[1:09:42] holy ghost
[1:09:43] is a secret place if you and i
[1:09:49] are living in a secret place
[1:09:54] and that secret place is christ
[1:09:59] amen one more scripture in closing
[1:10:03] in colossians actually i apologize for
[1:10:07] that there's two more let me finish this
[1:10:09] other one
[1:10:10] paul says in colossians 3 and
[1:10:14] verse 26 even the mystery which has been
[1:10:16] hid from ages and from generations
[1:10:19] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:10:22] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:10:25] riches of his glory in this mystery
[1:10:27] among the gentiles the mystery is christ
[1:10:31] in you the hope of glory
[1:10:34] amen christ is veiled he's hid
[1:10:38] in the secret place of your
[1:10:41] heart and my heart
[1:10:44] amen in colossians 3
[1:10:49] in verse 1 if you then be risen with
[1:10:51] christ seek those things which are from
[1:10:53] above
[1:10:54] where christ sitteth at the right hand
[1:10:56] god
[1:10:57] set your affections on things above and
[1:10:59] not on things
[1:11:00] on earth for ye are
[1:11:03] dead here's the quote scripture i want
[1:11:05] to get to for ye are dead
[1:11:07] and your life is hidden
[1:11:12] with christ in god
[1:11:19] remember one place brother bam talking
[1:11:22] of the
[1:11:23] intervale the holies of holies he talked
[1:11:26] about
[1:11:27] how that when christ died that veil was
[1:11:29] rent
[1:11:30] nobody could go back in that secret
[1:11:31] place but now every believer is to go
[1:11:34] back there behind
[1:11:35] that veil when you get in behind that
[1:11:38] veil and you're in christ he says the
[1:11:40] world comes
[1:11:41] shut off to you amen you don't hear the
[1:11:44] sounds of all over the world anymore
[1:11:46] you're any kind of glory in that secret
[1:11:49] hidden place
[1:11:51] amen and even the bible says that if you
[1:11:53] are a new creature and so forth he says
[1:11:55] that you are dead
[1:11:57] and your life is hid with christ in god
[1:12:00] now how many knows that in only the way
[1:12:02] the holy spirit is what covers us it's
[1:12:04] what hises is the holy ghost
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:11] because the life it says that you're
[1:12:12] dead how many knows that i can think of
[1:12:15] the stuff i used to do all the things i
[1:12:17] used to do
[1:12:18] i'm not going to mention them but it
[1:12:21] wasn't good
[1:12:22] you know
[1:12:25] but you know all of those things are
[1:12:27] covered and i i don't you know the only
[1:12:29] the only way
[1:12:30] that i could ever come out whatever that
[1:12:32] could ever happen is if like brother bam
[1:12:34] says you know
[1:12:34] around the tabernacle they had gotten so
[1:12:37] they had grieved the holy ghost away
[1:12:39] he said some of those folks out there
[1:12:41] the least little thing would set them
[1:12:43] off
[1:12:43] is that right in other words bring out
[1:12:45] that old man again
[1:12:48] how many knows the old man the devil
[1:12:50] tries to bring that old man
[1:12:51] alive again sure he does he tries to get
[1:12:55] that man to be alive again
[1:12:57] and show himself again i don't i don't
[1:12:58] know about you but i don't want that i
[1:12:59] don't want that i want him as dead as
[1:13:01] midnight
[1:13:02] i want the old time i don't want you to
[1:13:04] ever see the old thomas pilot
[1:13:08] amen didn't that go for every one of us
[1:13:11] i don't want anybody to see the old you
[1:13:13] i want that person so buried and dead
[1:13:17] and that life is gone when you bury
[1:13:19] something it's hid it's gone
[1:13:22] amen and the life that we have now
[1:13:26] it's hidden in christ
[1:13:30] amen you love the lord god bless you
[1:13:33] let's stand tonight
[1:13:35] musicians if you'll come
[1:13:42] how many thankful for that hiding place
[1:13:45] the hiding place in christ hidden away
[1:13:50] and how many knows that there's a secret
[1:13:53] catching away of the bride even that's
[1:13:56] going to be a secret
[1:13:58] when she is taken away
[1:14:01] huh
[1:14:04] i trust and hope that when that happens
[1:14:07] every one of us
[1:14:08] knows it is that right i don't ever want
[1:14:11] that to be a secret to me
[1:14:13] no because i'll be going it's not going
[1:14:14] to be a secret but to the world it's
[1:14:16] going to be a secret
[1:14:17] because like brother brown says man
[1:14:19] somebody else just become up missing and
[1:14:20] they'll just say well
[1:14:22] i guess it's just another one of them
[1:14:23] things you know
[1:14:26] but it's to be like a thief in the night
[1:14:28] it'll be a mystery it'll be a
[1:14:30] secret catching of his bride taking
[1:14:32] their way into the skies and the world
[1:14:34] will just continue on
[1:14:35] in their riots and their chaos
[1:14:40] amen but first time he believes that
[1:14:42] your life has to be hidden god
[1:14:44] it has to be in that secret place amen
