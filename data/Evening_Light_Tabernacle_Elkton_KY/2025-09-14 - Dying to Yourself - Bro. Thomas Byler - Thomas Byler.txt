========================================

Like Satan tried to offer Jesus all the kingdoms of the world. Just no Calvary. All these will I give you if you'll just bow down and worship me. Think about it. He was going to give it to him. Isn't it something how it took a prophet of God I ain't never heard it before. How it took a prophet of God to tell you that that shows that he the kingdom belong to him. that he's got control of them because he offered him. He couldn't offer him if he didn't have them, but he tried to offer him. Even brother Brand taught, he says he'll offer you going to church, be a good member. He'll try to offer you being a trustee, a deacon, a preacher. Just don't go to Calvary. Just don't die to yourself. Why? Because that still gives him access to your life. Still access to controlling you. [Music] And there's millions, I wrote down here, billions of people that take that offer, claiming to be a Christian without a Calvary, without dying to themselves. You got to die. How many know Jesus died for you? You owe him to die for him. That's what you owe. Amen. He won't accept anything and anything less. He went to the cross and he says if you're not willing to take up your cross, Amen. then don't bother coming. You ain't going to get it unless you're willing to die. Die to your thinking. Die to your plans. Die to your life. Die to your goals and ambitions. Amen. Sure you can have goals. Sure you can have visions. God is first.
