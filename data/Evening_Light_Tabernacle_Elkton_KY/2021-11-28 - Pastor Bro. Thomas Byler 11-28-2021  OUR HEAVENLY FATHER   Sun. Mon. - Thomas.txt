========================================

me jump up here to the fifth chapter of john i was reading that uh devotional it's a couple of days ahead and i was just thinking this morning i was thinking we're a few days away from from december 7th and it's hard to believe that that was 80 years ago where the united states was attacked by japanese forces uh 80 years ago was pretty quick i guess before you know it i was just telling jeanette this morning you know a young man that was on one of those ships in pearl harbor if he was 19 or 20 years old then he'd be 100 years old today you know and that just seems like a short time ago but uh let me uh read get to hear first i hope this is the right one if you wanted to where this quote comes out if you wanted one of the messages faith is our victory and it's october 4th 1958 let me just read a few of these scriptures here before i go off on a tangent here and it starts at the first verse here it says whoever believeth that jesus christ is the christ and born of god everyone that loved him that begotteth love with him and also he that is begotten of him by this know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for the for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his and his commandments are not grievous so whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcome with the world even our faith and who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus christ is the son of god and it goes kind of what the brothers have been preaching the last week you know everyone has to come to that relationship with what you believe but i was just reading this this morning uh and it comes out of the december sixth devotional and uh i'm just this first paragraph really struck me and you know the world that we're in was has so many diversions out there it's pulling people left and right they have no foundation anymore in their lives they're just all over the place and i'll just read what brother branham had to say here when you come to him don't come as a floater and that's what the world is right now everyone's a floater they're here they're they're never consistent walking down the road in the middle of the road i'll go up and try it and see if it works you'll never get nowhere when you come with this kind of determination that you are sold out stock and barrel when you're tired of the world and sin and unbelief and the frustrations and doubts that come to the living god with an anchor surely tightened in the rock of ages and brother thomas and all the men of the preach across the pulpit have taught you that you got to have that anchor you have to have that post in the ground where you know that you know that god has done it for you if you don't have that then you're going to be floating like brother branham's saying here in your relationship with jesus christ but once you meet the master then you'd settle like this people talk about and i'll go on and read this here holy spirit there you pull you into the presence of the living god that you will give you a faith that'll overcome anything that is in the world sickness disease even death itself and i can see in the age that we're living this morning that is really important that you have that foundation that you have that anchor in your soul i know i say it a lot but you have to have that anchor in your soul and he goes on to say here you say that you said death brother branham that's what i meant death was it not lazarus who was laying dead in the ground and that already corruption set in when jesus said to martha well where have you buried him and if you don't doubt you shall see the glory of god and i believe the same thing today whatever your need is if you don't doubt i'm sure that god i i know that he'll meet your need do not do not tell you not to doubt he said he said to jairus that day if you only believe you will see the glory of god then faith overcomes death faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustration faith is the victory over the world i know in my own life that's really important to victory over frustration i find as i get older i can only speak for myself i wind up getting more frustrated in the things that i do and he goes on to you say john when he wrote that he did not have any troubles he did not have any have to deal with the folks that i deal with when we know this isn't true you know john's day was just as bad as our day or our day might be worse in a in a mental sense but his in a physical sense and the same thought you may not have to overcome the same thing but he never excluded them for he said this faith is the victory that overcomes the world and the whole thing how is it it's faith in it right above it when we have the written word of god laying before us and the holy spirit performing and showing the resurrection of the lord jesus you know that happens in every heart it's this morning if you're believing and what the vine promises written there whatsoever thing you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it what do you have to do then have faith just not floating faith and that's what i was thinking about not floating back and forth in what you believe but your your foundation is firm and you're moving forward not just make a make-believe faith but a real faith now faith is the conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peace maker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what does the conqueror conquer the victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down the override to handcuff to throw into prison it means that sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it and you have whipped it and you you're greater than it and that's the most important the same things that possessed you 20 35 or a year ago shouldn't be possessing you today you should be moving forward in your relationship with jesus christ brother david i love you lord and lift my voice i stand this morning [Applause] and i live [Music] oh my soul [Applause] [Music] in what you hear let it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear once again oh i love you lord yes i do and i live my voice [Music] [Music] rejoice [Music] let

come before you lord jesus once again thankful to be assembled again in your name lord jesus and father but so wonderful to know that wherever two or three are gathered there you are in our midst lord we just desire god that you'll come lord and speak to us along the way that our hearts might burn within us as they did on the road to emmaus lord jesus we believe that you can do the very same thing today that you are the same yesterday today and forever lord and we just surrender ourselves to you lord not this morning asking god that you'll have your divine guidance and your divine way this morning lord jesus and lord speak through me lord jesus and hear through to hear the years of the years lord father have accomplished that which you have purposed for this service to accomplish lord knowing father that you knew exactly how what this would be like and how the setting would be lord you know all about it lord and we just ask for your perfect will lord pray for brother tommy lord just give him courage give him strength lord jesus this morning father we ask god that you completely deliver him lord give him his complete healing lord jesus we love you lord and we commit ourselves to you now bless the opening of the word meditation of our heart in jesus name amen and amen amen amen this morning we want to continue on our series that all right amen and so this morning um i wanted to speak on the creator god the creator but it kind of amen uh went into something a little different but i mean it certainly will have to do with the great creator but uh if you will turn your bibles to i think we'll go into isaiah first let's go to isaiah the 9th chapter and then we'll give you our title another one of god's attributes we're talking about god's attributes for those of you who haven't been here for the last few services we've been talking about the attributes of god all that he is all the different things that god is amen you know he's the everlasting father he's the prince of peace he's he's the creator he's redeemer and he just goes on and on and on this morning we want to read in isaiah 9 um and beginning with verse 6. amen for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace that there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the seal of the lord of hosts will perform this amen may god had his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen and we'll title this this morning the everlasting father amen we want to talk about our father amen talking about god as a father amen so that's what we want to speak on amen over in the book of ephesians over in the book of ephesians i want to go amen in chapter four if you'll notice there it said that he was the ever lasting father amen and in ephesians 4 and verse 4 says there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling there's one lord one faith one baptism and one god and father of all you all amen so how many believes there's one father only one father amen this is a very interesting thing you know because even jesus when he was here on earth he kept talking about the father i do nothing but what the father showed me first and kept talking about the father and the disciples were you know they couldn't couldn't stand themselves anymore and uh he says they asked he says you know show us the father and it'll satisfy us they wanted to know who this father was amen and so you know that you know trinitarianism you know and and you know there is such a thing let me say this there is such a thing as god the father the son and got the holy ghost amen how many believes that now most of the time when you say those words us believers we're like whoa stop watch out you know amen but truly there is one god the father the one god became the son and in the holy ghost is god because the bible says that which is conceived of mary is of the holy ghost right so the holy ghost was jesus's father that's right so the holy spirit is the father amen and we know that all he did all that god did was go into different offices amen so god the father father how many know the father is not a name son is not a name this name of the holy ghost is not holy ghost amen or christ should i say how many knows the name of the holy ghost is christ that's right praise the lord but anyway we don't want to go into that too much but notice here how he says that he is father of all i like that and the next phrase i also like he says who is above all this father is above everything how many knows in the family who's the head of the house the father the dad he is responsible for that family he's the head of that body ahead of that family who is the head of the father christ who's the head of christ come on now the bible clearly says the head of christ is god that's right amen because we're all under authority amen but anyway so we want to talk about the father for a little bit and i really don't want to keep you all day but this might take a little bit because when we we want to we want to transition from the father to his children right but we want to just talk about how that the father is above all amen and through you all and in all and through you all he is above everything there is nothing above god amen and over in isaiah if you'll notice a little phrase that he says he says the government shall be upon his shoulder the way that prophet god explained that was that in other words the rulership is upon his shoulder in other words if the burden of rumorship is on his shoulder how many knows that the burden of ruling is on his shoulder and brother ben described in some wife getting married and putting her veil off of her face onto the man's shoulder showing that he now takes responsibility complete responsibility for it he is responsible for all her burdens are on him now right and so that's the way it is with god all of your burdens are on god's sober all of your cares are on god's shoulder amen aren't you glad for that i'm very thankful for that over and let's go to another one in uh matthew we'll talk about the father a little bit more here in matthew 6 and verse i believe it's all the way over here in 26 jesus says behold the fouls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they amen but random he talked about a bird and you know how that the birds how did they have don't have arthritis or or or diabetes and you don't see them on crotches and wheelchairs and all these things you know and you don't see a bird worrying about things amen you know consider the foul look at the foul how they're taken care of now you know there's something about a father naturally speaking in a family if anybody ought to get gray hairs it's the husband it's the father why because he worries about or cares about every detail of that family every little detail amen and when we get neglectful about things that's where we end up paying for it when we neglect those things that are needful amen amen a lot of times it's just a just not necessarily finances or clothing or shoes or perhaps affection perhaps the emotional part hello of our wives or spouses different things you know you know i've learned one thing and one thing i've learned in your life and that is when your wife has to yell a little bit you better listen a little harder yeah because you raise their voice they get allowed because they want to get your attention you know they're not just doing it because you know they like to yell at you no they're trying to get to get the sound through they're trying to get you to hear what they really have need of what they really want how many believes that the wife really had to have the same thing right and then when the husband perhaps get a little loud hey listen honey huh well listen honey didn't work listen honey oh boy i didn't mean to go here but here we go you know brother banner talked about the church and so forth and i think the pastor neville brother neville or one of them that was the pastor and he said brother brother neville is real timid and he just talks softly but i i don't have a problem saying sit down all right brother brandon he'll get loud he'll get he'll get right frank brother brandon did because he was a little built a little different he meant how many knows he didn't mind screaming you know come on i heard my people he didn't mind calling them lodges instead of churches he maybe he got a little harder you know but listen so the father amen he cares your father is intricate how many believes that god cares our heavenly father cares about you you ought to be very happy this morning that you have a heavenly father as i got to thinking about this subject i got to thinking about how that this world has daddy issues this world has daddy issues that's the whole thing is any issues because how many knows there's only two fathers in this world there's only two fathers one of them is god and the other is the devil because listen to this if you remember the scribes and the pharisees they began to say that he was illegitimate born and he has the devil on him don't we say well and he got into this out of the other and they said you know jesus said if you were abraham's seed you hear what i said you know because they kept saying we are but we have abraham as our father jesus said if abraham was your father you would hear my words but because my words don't have any place in you you're not abraham's not your daddy then that was your daddy that's getting plain that's getting rough telling them your daddy is the devil if the devil is your father listen to me very carefully because jesus said my sheep they hear my voice let me tell you something if you are of god and if you are a son of god if he truly is your daddy when you hear the truth you will hear it and you will accept it period if you do not accept the truth when it's presented to you remember your daddy is the father of lies and that all you'll accept is lies deception huh oh bible said that but it doesn't really mean it not the devil that's what they believe well the bible says there's only one god how many know there's only one god let me just read another one we'll try to pick this up a little bit here if we can i believe it's in i hope i wrote this the last one down i know i had it looked up first corinthians first corinthians i know it was in first corinthians eight number verse four we'll start with verse four according as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one people don't know that do they they have three different gods now there's only one god amen what's his name jesus that's his right his name is jesus when thomas fell down and worshiped him says my lord and my god let me tell you something you could have believed in more than one god if he says no no no don't worship me worship the father only he just said that you could have believed something like that but he never did he accepted the worship am i right because he was god amen the fullness of the godhead the bible says dwells in him amen if you've seen me you've seen the father oh my oh my getting ahead of myself but then i say it and at that day there will come a day there will come a day jesus said at that day you will know that i am in my father my father is in me i am in you and you are in me so where is the father this morning he's right in your heart that's where he is think about it where is the father right here when i pray i don't pray to a god that's way out in the eons of spakes if that is where he is you are praying a prayer of repentance because he's not in there but when he's in there you don't have to go very far to pray he's right there he's the holy ghost and he's right in your heart that day you'll know that i am in the father i'm you are and he is in me and i am in him you're in me and i'm in you you'll find out we're all one don't get me excited here but brother brett i've got my father's blood running through me oh brother had don't i've never had to be a man come and join the byler family i was pouring the violer i've got violent blood i've got violent flash i've got filer looks i've got milor actions no that's right i look in the mirror sometimes i say a little bit of my dad right there in my nose or in my lips or my eyes i see a little my dad huh that's right how about spiritually that's the way it is people ought to look at you and say boy i'll tell you you look a little like jesus oh my now notice but one for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be many gods do you hear that the bible says to be many gods amen and many lords but to us there is but one god the father amen god the father how many believe that god is the father of all there is nothing that was made outside of the father he's the head of it all of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him my point of reading that was that there is only one true god all the others are amateur gods even moses when god told moses you're going to be like god huh or instead of god and aaron's going to be a prophet huh and that's where the catholics get ins vicarious philadelphi instead of god they think they're instead of god they act as instead of god second thessalonians the second chapter says he's gonna sit in the temples of god showing himself that he is god he's going to take the place of god but what's he doing let me tell you what he's doing he's imitating your place he's imitating our plates because we are the ones that are the amateur gods we are here instead of christ in instead is that right he is using you he's using me not the antichrist amen because it's always a dollar bill fake dollar bill has to look like a real dollar bill amen but think about this back to matthew just for a second there let me finish that scripture can we oh my the fowls they don't gather they don't reap you don't gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeded them are you not much better than they thank you jesus i mean you really don't have to worry about stuff your heavenly father is taking care of you he is watching over your health he is watching over your finances he is watching over your attitude he is watching over your spirit he is keeping you from harm he is protecting you he's watching over you amen oh hallelujah aren't you glad for that oh man which of you by taking thought can add one statute to his stature and why take he thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they dwell not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow's cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe yet clothe you o ye of little faith never take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where with all shall we be of a clothe come on folks let's be real honest this is what we think about most of the time where am i going to live what am i going to wear what am i going to drive i'm going to pay my bills huh it's time to take on god's thoughts quit worrying so much about that quit thinking so much about that you got to do that i mean we all got to work you don't work you don't need sure we got to do all of that but that is not your primary thought pattern huh or where shall we be close but these are the things that the gentiles seek after for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you if you really want to be blessed just seek the kingdom first put god first in everything and that all the rest be secondary then god will take care of you i'm afraid that we have taken care of ourselves so much until we don't rely on god to take care of us we go ballistic if something doesn't quite go the way we want it to go when we want it to go how good it wanted to go or if something goes badly wrong we lose it also praise be to god all right let me turn a little bit so we know our heavenly father cares about us he's over everything he's the watcher of he's our heavenly father amen in genesis 1 26 and god god said let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the file of the air over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and he blessed them and god said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it amen and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth hallelujah how many knows that we were original to have to be the god of the earth he was the god of heaven but god gave adam the authority over everything how many knows he could say to a mountain be moved and it would be moved he could say peace be still and it was still just like jesus did huh he could just speak the word and it would be done he got to name all the cows and the cattle the horse and everything else that's right so god gave him a dominion he gave him authority over the earth but you know what we have a problem with today this after the fall when we didn't come the way that we were supposed to by the way of the spoken word and we came by sexual desire after the fall we know that we were born wrong amen we fell from that place that we were supposed to be a ruler oh my hitler he had it in him he had a natural way of thinking about it supremacy huh supreme overall rule what did japan the same way they wanted to rule they thought they were supreme they were wanting to rule all china's got a little taste of it right now they like the rural world sure building up their army the way that they are that's just the carnal man folks i have new for you there's going to be one that rules it's going to be god amen but god give us a dominion now after fall man lost that now we do good to rule over our flesh but how many believes that we as fathers we as sons of god we should be like god and rule that we should subdue every enemy under our feet amen i mean the more i got into this subject tomorrow i realized i needed to have an altar call we all need to be at it including myself because i believe god put it this way to church as far from the place that it should be preached on the adoption series four times and he talked about how did we got to learn our place in christ where we belong to be amen that's right now notice let me just read you a quote or something too scary amen remember when a man is saved he becomes eternal life in his heart and as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then that god begins to spread in you then you become a son of god amen a man was made to be a god huh do you know that he's in the image of god he's a son of god we don't realize what a son of god is it's to be god-like it's to be like oh i like that so oh to be like him oh to be like him amen i love that song wish i could sing it better know it better but if you have a if you've got god at all ninja you have a desire to be like him amen to be like god amen he was in the image of god he's like him and he was given a dominion dominion over the whole earth he ruled the earth he ruled the animal kingdom all the kingdoms all but the kingdom of god above remember he's our heavenly father amen and he was god he was an amateur god a lesser god how many knows what different satan the devil before he was kicked out of heaven when he was god's right hand i believe the prophet said he deviated nothing with god he had all the authority god had except one thing he couldn't do what was it create amen he could not create the devil cannot create that's the difference he has to take it's what is created and make something with it and that's what man does he take something that god has already created why because we as uh not only are we amateur gods but we're also amateur creators we love to make things build things and boy oh boy country talk here boy oh boy you talk about what man has created what man has made what we have gone to in the last 100 years think about we can't we can't fathom okay you and i can't fathom just a little lifespan we had do you realize there was 2 000 years from the time of christ that we went through and the way all the way up to the late 1700s or or 1800s close to 1900s right right right right about that time is when they begin to invent things and find things and stuff they had never invented for truth out why didn't they get smarter quicker huh it's quite something isn't it all god holds it back he don't let no benjamin franklin's come and thomas edison and all of them come until it's time for the light to be in minute until all these things is to be invented in that right he held it back to all of that wisdom knowledge shall be in the increase in the end time is what the bible says now right and there we are right there how that man has progressed and what we've built and man you look at the skyscrapers and look at everything they've done and all the inventions even to our cell phone hey remember when we first started out all we had was the uh uh what do you call that you go boop what's that call morris code yeah that telegraph telegraph right and you know i mean that was can you imagine you know to where we had the phones on the wall we had dial all the numbers up right now folks if you want to have three four people online you're gonna tap them all in right my look at the cell phone look at where we went to why because man is a creator you know it's in him to create it's in him to evolve because why there's one big difference between you and the animal kingdom guess what they're still back in the dark ages the birds and all that they do things that they have always done the very same way we seem to have done the same thing for all of that time huh but it was in man to be creative to be like god in the image of god we were created now think about what we would do if we would take the spiritual side of that if we would take the spiritual side and if we would progress because we have an intelligence folks i mean those our intelligence doesn't really have a barrier unless you figure things out that's why we're flying 300 people in the airplane through the air from one side the other there's really no barrier we are we are a person we are we have been given reasoning we've been allowed to reason and that could be good and that can be bad isn't that right but actually god has put it put that reasoning in there to make every rich person responsible and accountable and to be able to judge them for the decisions that they make the choices that they make called free moral agency female agency comes in there amen and man becomes accountable you know for what he says isn't that isn't that crazy this world like brother brian saying it's it's the world's getting crazier all the time who'd have thought that somebody as crazy as would think that you need to get rid of the police that it would actually happen surely that wouldn't happen right but yeah it's happening and it was crazy yeah it was dumb we embrace dumb ideas what do we get killed that's right death amen but anyway all right so think about it intelligence god allowed us to be able to figure things out to grow to advance i'm just glad that god made a way that we could make a choice and advance because without calvary how many knows it didn't matter how much you knew no matter how much you wanted to you could never advance spiritually why because he was born and since shaping the becoming the world speaking lies no matter how much you tried to overcome no matter how much you tried to rule your spirit you could not rule your spirit the bible says he that rule of his spirit is stronger than the man that takes a city huh can control yourself [Music] and i want you to know that god's children god's sons oh they're led by the spirit of god and they have the power of god to overcome [Music] to rule to have dominion amen over amen let's talk about this for just a minute the power to create right the power to create now we know that god is the only one that can create out of nothing but do you realize that man that has been reconciled to god the if you're uh adam you know we know that he couldn't he couldn't create any more it was all lost but christ the second man adam brought us back into a relationship with god now and i don't think ever i don't think ever that i know us even in brother-in-law's not about ministry but christ's ministry when he was here by the brand i mean brother bram said how did he and multiplied it right he multiplied it but in our age god seemed fit to take one of his sons in that right and give him the word of creation isn't that right give him the power to create how many knows where i am with your creators brother bands before i pick that back up i want to say this he says it this way did you ever see people that you just love to be around you just love to be around them because they create an atmosphere around them who was it brother ted when he was here ministering talked about and i read the same thing that's why i knew he was accurate but he talked about how that brother bam said he said we're coming to meetings sometimes and there would be such an atmosphere there such an expectation such an atmosphere that before brother brandon would ever come out amen that everybody would be healed already huh why because the people created that atmosphere they come believing they didn't worry about their their work yesterday they didn't care about whether the electric was on or what their bill was due they cared about getting a hold of god [Music] what does it go to show you it doesn't matter about the preacher it don't matter if the preacher is here or not you have the power to create such an atmosphere i mean though sure we want power to do like the prophet god and speak squirrels into existence huh listen out there brother banham loved hunting he loved hunting squirrel and so god used a squirrel folks if it had been me it'd have probably been a big buck huh or it had been a 14 pound pass i'd sure like to have a 14 bomb as i have been wearing this lake out and all i've been catching is these 12 inches huh if it's me he opposite thomas just speak it and you'll have what you want huh praise be to god i'd say over there by that lily pad i'm gonna throw my lure right over there and guess what i'm just gonna put a hook on it nothing on the hook i want to make sure it's god i just throw that hook in there and i'm going to catch a 14 pound bass huh if god would have said it i wouldn't be afraid to say it if the unction wasn't here listen people i believe that we are supposed to be in the place of being able to speak these things because the god said that the whole world is groaning romans 8 says they're groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god the world is dying for the sons of god to be manifested and we ourselves are groaning folks i know you're groaning i watch this church and i know that oh it's so easy to just kind of slip backwards don't slip backwards folks don't get impatient now this is a time to keep pressing on don't slack up don't lock up which way are you going are you going backwards this morning or are you going forward huh one or the other it's time that we become sons of god it's time it's that time of the manifestation of the sons of god and by the man said that hey you say well my crop is burning up and then let the holy spirit come and inspire a brother and say well i give you a reign in the name of jesus [Music] brother jim's dad brother jimmy's dad he knows he testified up here talking about he says you know for some reason he'd done something amen and god told the prophet he says you give that man what he wants that's what we need we need the holy spirit to tell us to speak don't just speak on your own you won't get nothing but if he says it you'll get what your hearts desire you can say i give it to you in the name of the lord we've had a manifestation of it we've had an example of it i got to thinking about folks i'm here to tell you this message shouldn't make us lukewarm and backsliding this message ought to make us look like jesus christ act like jesus christ [Music] how many believes it what did jesus say about it let's see what jesus said about it jesus said i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also you see where we need a good old altar call come on folks ask yourself are you doing the works that he did have you got the love like he does have you got the power like he does do you look like your daddy do you act like your daddy huh because i am here to tell you and i believe the prophet said that means absolutely verily verily i say unto you and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto the father oh my here is what a son of god is to look like amen the great father had children this is what we're to look like verily verily i say unto you that whosoever what else whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do amen how it believes it's time to speak the word let the holy ghost get so much of the holy ghost in there until he can say just say this just say that because the one thing that is son of god we as children of god we as amateur god we as amateur creator are not is independent we are not independent we are not on our own we are powered with god's power we are filled with his spirit he does these things to us it's not us doing it oh and i want you to brag about my father let me prank about my daddy a little bit a little scrawny man by the name of david he was a nobody but yet he killed a lion and a bear and he killed that goliath and afterwards everybody was like david you are such a great man you are such an awesome man he said no it's not me he's the one that's awesome it makes you look awesome but it's not you that's awesome it's him that's awesome because he surrendered to him what we need is people completely surrendered to god so that god can use you how many believes that the goal of a father the goal of a mother the goal that they have is what let's leave what their goal is herein is set forth the love of god page 355 to church facebook hearing it set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own hey amen i knew i was talking to but before i got married before i thought about getting married i wasn't ready to get married i didn't want to get married i didn't want nothing to do with marriage but one day that all changed and that right it changed and i said i don't want to be by myself no more i want to share my life with somebody right how many knows that's the way god feels he don't want to be alone he wants to be with somebody he wants to have a family got married oh my this is awesome it's beautiful satisfying fulfilling just have a companion know what love's all really all about it's just awesome but after about two years go by something else hit me something else let me see i'd like to have a son i'd like to have children huh right this is a desire i would like to have children it must be kind of how god feels right it's by himself but he wants children amen notice he desired a family of his own a family of sons and daughters sons like himself amen and before him lies all mankind has one lump of clay and out of that same lump of clay he will now make vessels of honor and dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing and those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained huh how many believe that before we're ready to speak things before we can even get to the place of adoption and speaking things we have to have some fatherly care oh yeah fatherly cares what we have to have then those chosen ones born of a spirit trained to conform to the image in their walk huh you know i take that walk what that walk means to me i don't know what that walk means to you but that's a steady forward motion another not just a sunday or wednesday christian no but you're every day walking with god that's what i see that walking is meaning something you do every single day it don't change when you go out those doors no that's where it starts that's where you put into practice what you've been here listening to that's right in their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy amen he chases with nail scar hands sometimes his potter must take this vessel that he is working on and thoroughly break it down oh my i don't know any christians but that has that time in their life i did we did brother joe but john all of us we've all had that time where god has to break you down he had to break brother branham down brother branham was he was out and praying for the sick and walking the power lines and baptizing people and preaching the gospel like you ain't never seen isn't that right but yet he lacked when it came to obeying what god said when those people in mishawsha indiana said come and preach here come and preach god opened the door wide open and he refused to go through it because of his mother-in-law and god had to teach him a real lesson took his wife and baby was that a terrible thing yes that was a terrible thing and yet it was the best thing god could do because how many knows where they are now are they in a much better place much much better place amen that's right yet god had to teach him he had to break him down so much until the devil tempted him to say i'm god's going to be that way i'm not going to serve him i don't know if i can go on amen huh he has to thoroughly break that vessel down that he's working on that he may rebuild it exactly how he desires it oh listen church listening evening light tabernacle that's god's desire that's what he wants to do in your life he's come into your life to rebuild you to the way that you're supposed to be god have mercy on me huh because i know i need some rebuilding i'm sure you do too i'm making look at your life but this week i was thinking because i'll tell you right now most people don't never take a good look at themselves i know we're supposed to look to christ but sometimes you need to take a real good look at yourself and see what kind of person you really are and i guarantee you this most of the time it'll send you to your knees and saying god i don't want to be like that huh don't just ignore it well that's just how i am that's blindness uh if it's not the way that god wants you to be you're not allowing god to work on you if you're a son of god remember this you're gonna get worked on how many believes that you're gonna get worked on [Music] that's the bible have you forgotten hebrews 12 and five have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto us on two children my son despise not now the chastening of the lord nor faith when thou art rebuked of him huh boy sometimes the lord would be so hard till we just feel like quitting just quitting huh christianity it's not supposed to be this hard huh yeah we'll find out what you're made of don't faint be patient [Applause] oh my those weapons how many of those weapons our children didn't get the weapons the reason why god renegades the reason this generation as the prophet of god has gone completely insane is because a lack of discipline a lack of parent teaching am i right too many one two three four fives usually what you know what you know what you should say the second time that ought to get him going you ready for this what did i tell you [Laughter] that's that you said i know what that means right because if i kind of tell you what did i tell you they know the next thing is i'm not telling you and again i'll make you happy to do it folks how many know we need to be taught to need to be taught obedience oh my anyway i didn't mean to go down that road but still it has to do with parenting right the outcome let me tell you something the most satisfying the most wonderful thing that a pair can have is to have his children loving the lord serving god doing the right thing that's the most rewarding thing that a parent can have oh my that's your goal that's your ambition that's god's goal that's his goal for you that's his goal for me be to the place to where christ reflects so much until when he says say that you can say it and it's there because it wasn't just for brother branham it was for you and me too he's not the only son of god can i say something thank you brother joe think about how did god use the prophet of god so much he was so much in his image he looked back but so much like jesus there was a group of people that even to this day in this message think that he was jesus christ [Music] brother almost had to go off the field and say don't you say that about me it makes me antichrist but he looks so much like christ he could discern the thoughts and tense of the heart like jesus did folks not so long ago i was close to some of those people that kind of leaned that way and i heard them at the dinner table say well brother branham healed this person when brother branham healed that person and i knew how they lean i was like brother bantam didn't heal nobody if brother brandon was here he says i can't heal nobody you can't heal nobody it was jesus that healed them they want to so healer is in town he's not the healer christ is the healer but it's still a compliment because they said the same thing about john the baptist heart now the christ or do we look for another what is it you know because i am not i'm not worthy it's time to shunt i shoot right but so much in this image till some went off the deep end and we're wrong hello and i fear for those people can't believe something like that and be okay with god no no no no no let me tell you better repent anybody would be listening there you lean that way your chance of heaven slim god's not going to have you worshiping a man or an idol and have you some other god other than him huh what was it i heard some kind of a was it my wife said it i guess facebook or whatever there was a little saying that says you know people expect to live in the mansion over there with him but they won't come to his house down here hello you can't come to his house and you want to live in a mansion with him over there i thought may that happen up there's something i've been wanting to ask each and every one of you i want to ask you a question how much do you love jesus how much do you love jesus because remember it's not just about coming to church and paying your tithe and being loyal it's about how much you love jesus because that's what causes you to do all those things right however much you love jesus is how much you adhere to him it's your walk everything about it senders around your love for him and it shows in every one of us isn't that right amen if you love the lord you can't wait for them doors to open amen you can't wait to hear another sermon you can't wait to say amen let me tell you something we're in trouble when the amends die down when the hallelujahs die down when the church gets cold and stiff and starchy folks let me just go back a little bit and talk about creating an atmosphere amen if we could come to church amen with our spirits ready but that atmosphere don't start in church that atmosphere starts right at home it starts with your spouse it starts with your wife or your husband the atmosphere that you have with each other and that you have with your children and atmosphere with your prayer life so that when you walk in those doors you bring that atmosphere with you [Music] do you sit there with that attitude you're going to be a damp wit rag is that right we come with an atmosphere about us folks i want i want people when they get around me to not feel thomas byla because i'm as much of a grump as anybody but i'm here to tell you if crisis in here is hey how are you how in the world are you we can't get any better right peace be to god live or die we're we're in his hands we have a heavenly father let me give you a great big old hoe i love you i love your brother huh god bless you huh an atmosphere creators the power to create each and every one of us power to pull god down you love the lord amen do something get your hanky out while he's brother get your hanky out take your colder out praise be the god hallelujah all right can we start preaching let's talk about sons of god and how that we're so proud of our daddy aren't you glad aren't you proud of your papa let me tell you about my daddy you know what children are always doing my dad is and my dad died now the girls they'll say my mom this and my mom that they look up to mom she said ride their idol right well that's the way it is in the kingdom of god let me tell you about my daddy amen my father which is in heaven but the children of israel hungry he fed up he raided birds out of the heavens and fed them until their bellies were full they said and said praise be to god but them kids got to complain and while their toothpick was in their mouth picking the meat out well i tell you what there's no water around here there's no drink moses why didn't you bring us out here so that we would die here isn't there enough graves in egypt do you see why god wanted to just kill them all right out but to go off go get he wouldn't have done it if they wouldn't have deserved it but moses was like christ and he stood in the bridge in there right which isn't it sad let me tell you isn't it sad brother joe isn't it sad brother john to think that those 2 million all of those people are not going to be in heaven they're not going to be in heaven isn't that exactly what the prophet confirmed what jesus said yes and they're everyone dead but says that meant totally separated from god when jesus himself said yes and there everyone dead dad we had five we minor in the wilderness and we had this out of the other yeah but jesus said they're everyone dead with lazarus he said he's it huh that's right so even that that's sad only two that made it out of the original bunch now let me clarify this because what people don't understand is the children that didn't know any better they were the ones that went in joshua and caleb and the children went in but not those parents not mom and daddy not them old fighters always fighting fighting fighting fighting they didn't go in amen all right all right praise the lord so where we're at oh my what about oh thank you think about this but listen folks lord's really good this morning when we think about david when we think about david and how that god was pleased with him right god he was a man after god's own heart and god laid it on his heart to go after the goliath and all of these people all of his brothers thought boy he's going to get killed that ain't no good right but god had confidence he had he loved david and he gave him a mighty victory he brought goliath down for him now i want to say something else that is like the three hebrew children listen to this the three hebrew children were going to serve god even if it meant death let me say this way if i can it wasn't so important that the three hebrew children lived that wasn't what was important or died the important part was is that they trusted their daddy they trusted god whether they would live or whether they would die it was all fine by them i believe that's the way it is even the prophet made the statement live or die sink or swim where faith is in him i believe that's a real big step in being a mature son of god that it's not about whether he live or whether you die it's about whether in death or life whichever way it goes huh just like my wife caleb when he was born god we don't know if he's going to live so i'm giving it to him i'm giving him to you if you want to take him take him that's the way we got to feel about ourself god if you're going to let me die if you want me to die i will die but i'm going to die trusting you huh our faith is completely in god our trust and our hope is completely in father god am i right remember this is the kind of faith jesus asked us to have what so every things you ask you shall receive brother branham when he was so sick isn't that right brother brandon was so sick in his stomach he kept being sick and sick and sick the doctor says if you eat one big solid chunk of food you gonna die and he got around the table now i'm not sure brotherhead probably knows but what kind of food they were eating but hand me them taters hand me this beans hey hand me that stuff he i sing on it and he says by his stripes i am healed his mama he says i'm gonna eat it mama mama said don't you eat it son don't you eat it you're gonna die i want you around live or die i trust him he ate them right mama crying mama crying maybe she didn't have faith like he did but liver died he was eating them he was trusting the lord he was believing the lord and then right he spit it back up oh the image i got he would spit it up in his hand oh you're gonna stay down huh right by his throat i'm healed by his throat i'm healed and what happens he got healed god honored he says that's my boy when those three hebrew children went up into the fire father god was proud he says that's my son that's my children that's what i'm looking for live or die i will serve him what does it matter if you die you go to a better place anyway you want to make sure you're just right with god right oh my how maybe we have room for growth we need to grow amen that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires but it is love that is his love another way of love there is not how many knows we human beings we as christians me as a pastor of 30 years we still need chastening we still need rebuke we still need direction we still need correction because it won't be till tuesday or something or that and i'll probably miss my morning well i hardly ever miss that but maybe my noon prayer or thinking about him as much as i should hello we are so prone to backsliding we're so prone to getting away from god listen to you people that wanted to renew the joy of your salvation somewhere you've lost joy think back where you what you did did you neglect prayer meeting did you neglect reading your bible neglect praying at your home asking the blessing at the table huh oh my it's so unbecoming of christians no matter where you are by your head and pray i'm sure every one of us have been restaurants and well do i want to bomb my head what do you want to do none of us no doubt are ashamed of that right i don't care if the worst atheists die or whatever i wouldn't care if they throw me out amen i'll be respectful for them not make them hear my prayer maybe i have a silent prayer unless i'm in the group i don't just get up there and say god bless this food now some of them might need that but anyway listen to this let's go on and if ever listen wherever you left that joy whatever weeded it out whatever little bitterness come in nobody knows you got to go back to that place and say this is where i lost my joy this is why i lost my faith in god lord help me to repent oh my this is where he says you know that when you get saved the holy spirit comes in there that eternal life and as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then god begins to spread in you then you become a son and daughter of god amen praise the lord we cannot be reliant upon ourselves we have to rely on him it's time to get back to sons and daughters of god back to where jesus said if you ask anything in my name i will do it did he say you will do it no he said you will ask and i will do it well we get where we miss demarcus we ask and we think we're gonna do it no you're not you're gonna ask ask and you shall receive not and it shall be opened unto you amen when i see how god was in our prophet i see how he was when i read this message and i study this message i realize brothers and sisters that it's not just about what was in him but it's what's in you what's in me and i don't know about you but i'll say lord i want to get to that place to where i speak just let the holy spirit come let him tell me to say something and say it let it happen let me tell you something how many believes that that can happen for any sister in this church any young people in this church it can happen to you god can do it through you if you'll surrender completely to god and be pleasing to him how many believes but he's gotta he's gotta work on us a lot of time before we get to that place brother branham had to be worked on very hard before he got to that place amen had he right how many members had he write the same way god said tell her ask her what she wants and give it to her amen speak the word and it'll be so whatsoever you ask it'll be done so search your heart this morning ask yourself where are you as a daughter of god where are you as a son of god where are you in your character where are you in your atmosphere where are we as where are we at this morning evening tabernacle in atmosphere what do we bring to church with us do we bring our cares our worries our frets or do we bring the atmosphere of peace and the holy spirit so that god can move on the scene because how many knows brother troy we have dire situations we have things that we absolutely need miracles for amen i believe he's a miracle-working god i believe the same yesterday today and forever i think my wife pointed out to me a quote where he talks about you know god did everything he could do brother man says i've done everything i can do now it's up to you whether you accept that or not whether you receive it or not it's completely up to you because everything else has been done i mean as god has showed us the example i truly believe he's shown us an example of what a son of god is like through the prophet in his generation and of course his son jesus christ himself but in our generation christ was in him i don't know that was christ not the brother adam brother ram could heal he couldn't tell you where he was from he wouldn't know the first thing about you unless the holy spirit come unless jesus came because he's still the holy spirit is the designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart not a man amen i want to be more like him oh i want to be like him i want to be like him don't you want to be like him stand with me this morning praise the lord with our heads bowed eyes closed don't think about anything else right now except where you're at with the lord where are you at with the lord are you in love with him do you love him as much as what you should are you close to him close remember romans 8 i didn't get to it but he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son that's what we've been predestinated to be and when you ask to be that remember that's his desire also you can't ask a miss on that because that's god's desire that is to be like him to be in his image the works that he did you do also how many would say i'm not where i should be i confess i'm not where i should be should be i don't know if you're backslid i don't know where you're at but you know where you're at say god i'm not where ought to be this morning my hand is up lord we all need to grow we all need to come closer to you lord we want to see the reflection of christ in our lives above anything above any riches above any worldly possessions no none of those things matter to us what matters to us that christ is reflected in our hearts our lives our atmosphere our words our actions towards one another in everything god we want your reflection to be in our hearts and our lives lord you see every hand lord and i knew i knew when i read this and seen this i still see lord jesus where i definitely need a change of reflection i need to change i need to lord let you have greater power in my life lord surrender more to you than what i have lord and i ask god this morning you'll see every hand and every sin every failure now will drop in the blood of jesus christ because they raise their hands in confession of their faults and their failures and saying god i come here to see where i can become better lord to find my bad places and to let you the holy spirit come into my life in a greater way never to look at somebody else and expect it out of them but to expect it out of our self lord out of me the husband the father of my house that's
