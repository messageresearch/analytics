[48:20] good to be back here to see everyone
[48:21] again hope everyone's doing wonderful
[48:24] getting ready for winter time is that
[48:26] good yeah I'm going to read out of
[48:28] Philippians the second chapter starting
[48:31] to the fifth verse be about four or five
[48:33] verses there some of you probably could
[48:35] quote this it's just very very well read
[48:38] and preached
[48:41] on Philippians 2 and verse
[48:44] 5 let this mind be in you which was also
[48:49] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[48:52] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[48:54] with God that means not something to be
[48:56] grasp at like oh I got to be equal with
[48:58] God I'm God but he said I'm going to let
[49:00] that go but made himself with no
[49:02] reputation and took upon him the form of
[49:04] a servant was made in the likeness of
[49:07] men and being found in fashion as a man
[49:10] he humbled himself became obedient unto
[49:14] death even the death to the Cross
[49:17] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[49:19] him and give a name which is above every
[49:21] name you can have a seat if you
[49:23] like tonight I want to speak on the saw
[49:26] it proving who you
[49:28] are proving who you
[49:32] are Jesus saw himself in the word as he
[49:36] grew up he recognized who he was and and
[49:38] and the Word was revealed to him more
[49:40] and more until he
[49:41] recognized what his purpose in life was
[49:44] yeah and he humbled himself to that
[49:48] purpose brother and sister every person
[49:50] who's in The Bride is going to come to a
[49:52] place where they recognize their purpose
[49:54] in this life and will humble yourself to
[49:56] that purpose and it takes humbling cuz
[49:59] most of the time a lot of the times it
[50:00] requires us doing something that we
[50:02] really don't want to
[50:04] do prefer I prefer not doing that God he
[50:07] said I didn't ask
[50:09] you I'm telling you right but now you
[50:12] have a choice to do it or not now if you
[50:14] don't do it you can be like join or run
[50:15] away but he's gonna get you he's gonna
[50:17] bring you back he said no no come on
[50:19] back I like how he said he being found
[50:21] in fashion as a man brother and sister
[50:24] we find our El we grow up we were
[50:26] fashioned as a man we recognize that oh
[50:28] my goodness look what kind of a person I
[50:30] am because the more you want to serve
[50:32] God the more you see how weak and evil
[50:35] and nasty that own nature is and how
[50:37] selfish and how it just wants to have
[50:39] its own way and we find oursel in a a
[50:41] fashion as a person fallen in a fallen
[50:44] condition and yet we want to serve God
[50:46] because something inside of us said but
[50:48] I want to be a Christian but I'm
[50:50] struggling to do it how do I go about
[50:52] this you do it the same way God did that
[50:54] Jesus did you find your purpose purpose
[50:55] and you find what he wants for you and
[50:57] you walk in that purpose and he will
[50:58] bring you to that place let this mind be
[51:01] in you which is in Jesus Christ what is
[51:03] that m not something I'm want to be
[51:05] something great I'm G to humble myself
[51:06] recognize that if he doesn't do the work
[51:08] in me it's not going to get done there's
[51:10] nothing I can do to make myself
[51:11] righteous I'm gonna have to depend
[51:13] solely on him and he's gonna promise to
[51:16] bring me
[51:17] through right second Thessalonians in 2
[51:20] chapter Paul says he now we beseech you
[51:23] Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[51:24] Christ and by our Gathering Together
[51:26] unto him that ye be not soon shaken in
[51:29] mind or be troubled neither by Spirit
[51:33] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[51:35] at the day of Christ is at hand and so
[51:38] what I want to look at this is Paul is
[51:39] saying you need to know who you are so
[51:41] that you are not going to be shaken and
[51:43] troubled and distressed and worried
[51:45] because oh my goodness look around you
[51:47] look around you say we are in the midst
[51:48] of a hurricane here the whole world has
[51:51] gone insane and here we're sitting like
[51:52] in the eye of the needle and we're
[51:54] thinking what's going on going to happen
[51:56] what's going to happen next yeah that's
[51:59] right and you're right it has gone
[52:01] crazy and yet we have the front row sea
[52:04] watching scriptures being fulfilled in
[52:07] our name scriptures that were prophesied
[52:10] thousands of years ago and today you can
[52:12] look at them and say this is happening
[52:15] today have you noticed the anti-Semitism
[52:17] the whole world has gone against Israel
[52:20] they're supposed to United States we're
[52:23] going to turn against them sooner or
[52:24] later and when we do I don't want to be
[52:26] here please God that's right that's
[52:28] right but we're going to lead the way
[52:31] because right now we're the one thing
[52:32] that's holding now we'll still support
[52:34] Israel wait till we turn against them to
[52:36] everyone's going to fall into line I
[52:37] mean besides ones already there we're
[52:39] watching the scripture because every
[52:41] nation will come against Jerusalem
[52:42] friends it's happening right in front of
[52:44] our

[55:56] friends I'm not making this church a
[56:00] book you got to know who you are now you
[56:04] got to know who you are let me read what
[56:05] brother Bram said can we do
[56:07] that he said he's asking this question
[56:09] he says how many Christians are here
[56:10] raise up your hands all the Believers
[56:13] raise up your hands everywhere oh I
[56:14] suppose that's wonderful it looks like
[56:15] 100% so he's preaching to a bunch of
[56:18] Christians he said now if you're a
[56:19] Believer I believe that I know what the
[56:22] greatest curse that's on the church
[56:24] today it's not knowing what they are oh
[56:27] wow it's a curse because if you don't
[56:30] know who you are you don't know where
[56:31] you're standing you can't stand there
[56:33] because something comes along it's going
[56:35] to wash you right away it's going to
[56:36] blow you right over you need to know who
[56:38] you are where you're stand it has to do
[56:39] with placing and and adoption in your
[56:41] position in Christ he said you might you
[56:43] need to know that he said now with the
[56:44] help of God this afternoon I'm going to
[56:46] help you to place the believer
[56:48] positionally in Christ what his
[56:49] authority is in Christ these are things
[56:51] that we must know and brother and sister
[56:53] I hope we all do by this time yeah right
[56:56] but tonight we're going to look at this
[56:57] a little bit and see proving how do you
[56:59] know who you are how do you prove who
[57:00] you
[57:03] are he said now this this epistle the
[57:05] letter of Ephesians written to Believers
[57:07] not the outside world this is Believers
[57:09] that's why I brought this afternoon
[57:10] first I test and see if there's group of
[57:12] unbelievers and siners want speak it
[57:13] here he said now try hard Christians to
[57:16] understand that this day that the
[57:18] message has been placing the believer in
[57:20] positionally placed the whole message
[57:22] has been putting us in Christ placing us
[57:25] there so we know who we are so that when
[57:27] the storm comes against now by the way I
[57:29] said we have it easy I was talking
[57:30] naturally spiritually you're fighting
[57:32] the hardest battle that's ever been
[57:33] fought because what's going on is we
[57:35] have it so easy it's so easy just to
[57:38] kind of relax and take it easy because
[57:40] we got all the takes we got the Bibles
[57:42] we can pray we can do all this stuff so
[57:44] we get lazy we get laad isical and Satan
[57:47] hits us and hits us and his and some of
[57:49] the times we don't even realize that
[57:51] what are is considered our day to-day
[57:53] walk we are being hounded by demons and
[57:55] just like well this is just natural we
[57:57] don't even realize the thoughts that
[57:59] constantly pump our mind it's not normal
[58:02] other ages haven't had to put up with
[58:04] this like we do but we got it so easy
[58:06] and we don't even think about it and we
[58:07] just kind of get desensitized and we
[58:09] fight this battle we fight that we fight
[58:11] that and we don't even think about it
[58:13] but all the time oh sometime we think
[58:14] about it things get really rough don't
[58:16] get me wrong but so many times just go
[58:18] through I had a good day today why I
[58:20] only fought about 10,000 demons you
[58:21] don't even think about it but you
[58:23] did
[58:29] is positionally putting us in a place if
[58:31] every believer in here was in their
[58:32] place now I'm just going to break it's
[58:34] going to break it off a little bit if
[58:37] every believer knew their place he said
[58:39] the lady on a cot the man with the
[58:40] crutches along there there would not be
[58:43] a feeble person in this building in the
[58:45] next 20
[58:48] minutes if every man could simply find
[58:51] his place his or her place in Christ
[58:53] Jesus what a difference
[58:55] it would
[59:02] make that is our inheritance that is
[59:06] Rapture and material that's what needs
[59:08] to happen friends because we're going to
[59:09] have to get to the place where you know
[59:11] you are to such a place because you have
[59:13] to have rapturing faith rapturing faith
[59:16] is greater than any of us have ever
[59:17] experienced yet friends because it's
[59:19] going to change its body but everyone
[59:22] has to have it because a little unbelief
[59:24] here it'll little unbelief there it's
[59:25] going to it's going to it's going to
[59:27] hinder it and so friends that's going to
[59:30] be gone either you're going to come to
[59:32] this place so you're going to be gone
[59:34] that's what the storm that squeeze
[59:35] that's coming it's going to squeeze some
[59:37] people right out the door it's going to
[59:38] squeeze the other people right up into a
[59:40] Rapture but you need to know who you are
[59:42] because otherwise you will be gone this
[59:44] ain't playing God's Not playing this Ain
[59:46] playing Church let's have a picnic let's
[59:49] go do this friends this is where it
[59:51] comes down to where you need to know who
[59:52] you
[59:53] are
[59:57] he he goes on he says now I know he said
[59:59] I felt your mind rolling fast he could
[1:00:01] tell what people were thinking he said
[1:00:02] now brother Brandon I know where I am
[1:00:05] you think you do see that's it if you
[1:00:07] did it would be
[1:00:09] different it would be different this is
[1:00:12] for all of us friends and nobody said
[1:00:14] well I got but figured out no one else
[1:00:16] does we're all coming to this place and
[1:00:18] this is one reason you didn't pray for
[1:00:20] your pastor more than anything else
[1:00:22] except Revelation because you can't get
[1:00:23] higher than him yeah he's leading the
[1:00:27] charge you make sure you hold him up
[1:00:29] before the Lord and keep those demons
[1:00:30] off so he bring the word to preach it to
[1:00:32] get you to this place because the way
[1:00:34] you're going to get here is by the
[1:00:35] preaching of the word is going to
[1:00:36] produce it yeah that's right
[1:00:45] amen he says little
[1:00:47] babies I got a little one back there
[1:00:49] just learned to walk he'd bump and fall
[1:00:51] down get back up he thought he was doing
[1:00:53] something great I was that way one time
[1:00:54] time but now I'm a man I put away
[1:00:56] childish things he said we got to come
[1:00:59] to full Doctrine I like good old
[1:01:01] shouting meetings where we just clap our
[1:01:03] hands and Shout have a good time have a
[1:01:04] wonderful service and the things dance
[1:01:06] on the bubble as it word but wait all
[1:01:09] right then when The Showdown time comes
[1:01:12] you don't know where you're
[1:01:14] standing just because you can shout and
[1:01:17] dance and have a wonderful service does
[1:01:19] not mean you know where you're
[1:01:21] standing it's the word friends it's the
[1:01:23] word brother here brother brand today he
[1:01:25] was talking about how the false ones can
[1:01:27] Pro produce the same signs as the real
[1:01:30] ones it's not the signs it's the word
[1:01:32] that tells the difference and when you
[1:01:34] know where you're standing you can stand
[1:01:35] on the word and be salad there and just
[1:01:37] because you and you might dance one time
[1:01:39] you might dance for another two years
[1:01:41] but it doesn't matter if you dash or not
[1:01:44] CU you know where you're
[1:01:46] standing you can't build your confidence
[1:01:48] because you danced and shouted and
[1:01:50] screamed and felt anointings that's no
[1:01:52] Foundation to stand on that's why so
[1:01:55] many people going to be deceived because
[1:01:57] that's what well I know I have it
[1:01:59] because I jumped and shouted in church
[1:02:00] so do
[1:02:03] frogs yes it is he said let's get back
[1:02:06] and find out let's find out what's
[1:02:07] making us do that get back to the
[1:02:09] foundation and see where you are I'm G
[1:02:12] I'm gonna turn to uh second Peter here
[1:02:15] real quick and read a little bit second
[1:02:16] Peter the first chapter just to save
[1:02:19] time I'm not going to read everything
[1:02:20] but he verse four says whereby are given
[1:02:22] un to us exceeding great and precious
[1:02:24] promis that by these you might be
[1:02:25] partakers of the divine nature have an
[1:02:27] escaped corruption that's in the world
[1:02:28] through us so he said these promises we
[1:02:30] are partakers of these promises which
[1:02:31] means you believe him and then when you
[1:02:33] believe him produces a new birth which
[1:02:35] is that divine nature and through that
[1:02:36] you escape the corruption then it goes
[1:02:38] on to say now besides this give all
[1:02:40] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[1:02:41] he goes through all these virtues that
[1:02:43] you need to add to your new birth once
[1:02:45] you're born again then you have to go
[1:02:46] through just add The Virtue add this the
[1:02:48] strength which comes through
[1:02:51] trials right that's right he says for in
[1:02:55] verse 8 for if these things be in you
[1:02:57] and abound they make you that ye shall
[1:02:58] neither be baren nor fruitful in the
[1:03:00] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:03:01] if he lack us these things liketh what
[1:03:04] the revelation of who you are and the
[1:03:06] these these virtues that are that are uh
[1:03:09] molded into you through your trials you
[1:03:11] go through he said if you lack these
[1:03:12] things you cannot see you're blind
[1:03:14] cannot see far off have forgotten you
[1:03:16] apprach from those sins verse 10
[1:03:18] wherefor the rather brother give
[1:03:19] diligence to make your call and election
[1:03:21] sure for you to do these things you
[1:03:23] shall never fall what's he saying you
[1:03:25] got to make sure you're calling an
[1:03:27] election it's sure you got to make sure
[1:03:29] you know who you are now I got to ask
[1:03:30] you a question can you call
[1:03:33] yourself can you elect
[1:03:36] yourself then how do you make it sure
[1:03:38] what's he talking about because if you
[1:03:40] take this from a carinal perspective and
[1:03:42] I used to look at it this way I got to
[1:03:45] add all these virtues and I got to make
[1:03:46] my call election sure how am I supposed
[1:03:48] to go about doing that well I got to try
[1:03:50] really hard I had all diligence I got to
[1:03:52] make sure I have faith what come I my
[1:03:54] virtue I'm going to work on my
[1:03:55] Temperance I'm going to work on my no
[1:03:57] quit it you ever try to do that in your
[1:04:00] own strength try to make yourself a
[1:04:02] better person I'm gonna give myself
[1:04:05] character you give yourself a
[1:04:10] headache then what are you supposed to
[1:04:12] do how do you make your call election
[1:04:14] what he saying if you need to make sure
[1:04:16] you know where you're standing on the
[1:04:17] Revelation that God called you and he
[1:04:20] elected you and he told you that and so
[1:04:23] when anything comes against you you
[1:04:25] stand firm on that and say Satan I know
[1:04:28] where God put me I'm not getting off of
[1:04:30] here that's what he's talking about you
[1:04:33] make a call electure by knowing that
[1:04:35] it's been revealed to you who you are
[1:04:37] not CU you bubbled ass not because you
[1:04:38] felt an anointing not CU you had a
[1:04:40] baptism because Jesus Christ told you
[1:04:43] personally exactly who you
[1:04:46] are that's how you can stand there and
[1:04:49] friends when you can stand there then
[1:04:50] when you go through the trial you'll
[1:04:52] have the right attitude and it will for
[1:04:54] your your virtue and your Temperance and
[1:04:56] all this brother love it will mold that
[1:04:58] into you because you stand there with
[1:04:59] the right attitude knowing that this is
[1:05:01] for my good and nobody's gonna take this
[1:05:04] away from me and then you humble
[1:05:06] yourself and go to your cross you had
[1:05:08] the same mind in you that Jesus had he
[1:05:10] found himself in likeness of a man he
[1:05:12] humbled himself and you can do the same
[1:05:15] when you recognize who you are if you
[1:05:17] don't know who you are you're going to
[1:05:19] bail that trial you're going to have a
[1:05:20] bad attitude you're going to be
[1:05:22] impatient with drivers like I was today
[1:05:24] God have mercy and you're GNA like
[1:05:26] you're going to fail it and say well
[1:05:28] let's try this again bring me another
[1:05:30] bad driver oh feel got impatient again
[1:05:33] bring me mother bad driver are we're
[1:05:34] gonna get this right after a
[1:05:40] while some of you know what I'm talking
[1:05:43] about all you human beings
[1:05:46] do hey
[1:05:48] man it's true friends this is how it
[1:05:51] happens and how do I do it you know what
[1:05:52] humbles me down I recognize who I am
[1:05:55] yeah Phil this is for your good why
[1:05:57] don't you figure this out okay it's all
[1:05:59] about the attitude you take okay let it
[1:06:02] go
[1:06:07] yes and then Satan comes and says I
[1:06:09] thought you're a
[1:06:11] Christian if thou be the bride of
[1:06:14] Christ that's how it came to Jesus if
[1:06:17] thou be the Son of God change it you're
[1:06:20] hungry change the stones and if thou be
[1:06:23] the son of prove it to
[1:06:25] me that's right when I say proving who
[1:06:29] you are I am not talking about proving
[1:06:31] it to the devil who cares what he thinks
[1:06:32] about
[1:06:33] you you got nothing to prove that a liar
[1:06:37] if you could prove it he won't believe
[1:06:39] it anyways that's the spirit of this AG
[1:06:41] they look at the fact this is fact and
[1:06:43] they say I don't want to believe it that
[1:06:45] way I don't like it that way and they'll
[1:06:46] turn and believe something completely
[1:06:47] different because they just don't want
[1:06:49] to believe the fact that's what's going
[1:06:50] on in this world that's why the whole
[1:06:52] thing over there with Hamas and all that
[1:06:54] they going to look at the facts that I
[1:06:55] don't like the facts I'm going to
[1:06:56] believe something different
[1:06:58] that's he's exactly right Satan's the
[1:07:01] same way he's an author of
[1:07:05] that he don't he don't care what you
[1:07:08] prove he's gonna he's never gonna be
[1:07:10] satisfied if thou be the Son of God if
[1:07:12] thou be the most come down off the cross
[1:07:14] and prove it to us we'll worship you
[1:07:16] we'll believe you no they wouldn't have
[1:07:19] they find a reason not to because Christ
[1:07:21] can be flashed right in front of a
[1:07:23] person's face today I'm talking about
[1:07:24] they look right at you and all they see
[1:07:26] is some
[1:07:27] old body of person they say well I don't
[1:07:30] see any difference in you oh yeah you're
[1:07:31] a little different but I I'm satisfied
[1:07:34] with my
[1:07:36] religion I'm satisfied and a tradition
[1:07:40] veils and from seeing
[1:07:43] it brother B says this the holy spirit
[1:07:46] makes every movement like Christ it'll
[1:07:48] make you Christlike the fruit of the
[1:07:50] spirit is love joy peace long suffering
[1:07:51] goodness meekness gentleness patience
[1:07:53] faith faith those things are what the
[1:07:55] Holy Spirit controls our
[1:07:59] emotions emtions our emotions he's
[1:08:02] supposed to we're supposed to Humble
[1:08:03] ourselves so he controls our emotions so
[1:08:06] when I get impatient in traffic I like
[1:08:08] surrender relax and he comes and takes
[1:08:10] over and says Phil it's
[1:08:12] okay it's okay you're gonna get there
[1:08:15] three seconds later than you would have
[1:08:16] got there if you you yeah is and when
[1:08:20] you look at it from that perspective
[1:08:21] it's like man Phil you are an idiot
[1:08:27] but that's the way we do we get tore up
[1:08:28] about oh he said something she said
[1:08:31] something about me oh my goodness do you
[1:08:33] did do you think of oh my and we get all
[1:08:35] this stuff and thoughts go you ever you
[1:08:37] ever dve down the road and a thought
[1:08:39] comes and you start wondering if that
[1:08:41] really happened or not and then you
[1:08:42] start dwelling on it and next something
[1:08:45] that
[1:08:48] never it's just it's just ridiculous and
[1:08:51] that's the way Satan fights us because
[1:08:52] our minds are are weak yes the prophet
[1:08:57] told us our minds are weak he said if
[1:08:59] our bodies are not weak and our brains
[1:09:01] our minds being coming week two yeah sat
[1:09:03] knows what he's doing
[1:09:05] yes our emotion not so much jumping up
[1:09:08] and down you could do that as shindig
[1:09:09] will bring that to you but the Holy
[1:09:11] Spirit brings you into operation or in
[1:09:12] control of God that you walk in
[1:09:15] peace amen yeah we can walk in peace in
[1:09:19] the midst of this world friends we can
[1:09:22] walk in peace the Holy Spirit
[1:09:24] humble ourselves and let the Holy Spirit
[1:09:26] take control we can have an inner peace
[1:09:28] while our mind is on fire our bodies are
[1:09:31] are tore up and all this stuff go
[1:09:32] whipping around but we can turn inside
[1:09:34] and find out there's peace in
[1:09:36] there all he wants to do is say I got
[1:09:39] you covered will you just allow me to
[1:09:41] have control here and I'll give you some
[1:09:43] peace but the reason we don't have peace
[1:09:45] we're so tore up we're worried we're
[1:09:46] stressed because we're trying to control
[1:09:48] a situation every time we worry it's
[1:09:51] because we want to try to control the
[1:09:53] situ situation we want to know how God
[1:09:55] is going to do this how you going to
[1:09:57] hand this God are you sure you got this
[1:09:59] are you sure you got this I don't know

[1:11:57] did then what are you worried about well
[1:11:59] when oh now you got to put a time limit
[1:12:01] on him yeah yeah this is human nature
[1:12:04] friends this is what we all fight I hope
[1:12:06] you all know what I'm talking about if
[1:12:08] you're way past this and you just let
[1:12:09] the rest of us catch up
[1:12:13] okay he said he said uh you walk in
[1:12:15] peace and in love and in Joy with
[1:12:17] longsuffering goodness meekness gentle
[1:12:19] patient you see it isn't something that
[1:12:21] you
[1:12:22] do that's the key to the whole message
[1:12:24] tonight it isn't something that you
[1:12:29] do it's something the Holy Spirit does
[1:12:32] in
[1:12:33] you you
[1:12:35] see
[1:12:37] Hallelujah you don't prove nothing you
[1:12:40] don't have to prove anything to anybody
[1:12:42] when I say proving who you are it ain't
[1:12:44] you proving it it's him proving who you
[1:12:47] are he vindicates at who you are take
[1:12:49] your hands off the wheel and let him
[1:12:51] drive the car quit trying to prove
[1:12:54] you're a Christian quit trying to prove
[1:12:56] that you're a bride quit trying to prove
[1:12:58] all this stuff because you're just
[1:12:59] falling in Satan's trap well I got to
[1:13:01] live good enough to be bright I got to
[1:13:03] do this to be bride I got no you need to
[1:13:05] stand on your election that God told you
[1:13:08] you are elect and you say I will stand
[1:13:10] here and let him do all those he
[1:13:12] promised to do that's what he's asking
[1:13:15] for not for you to go and prove who you
[1:13:18] are on you see it's no longer an
[1:13:22] intellectual thought of your own it's a
[1:13:24] subconscious movement of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:26] oh I wish I could shout the Praises of
[1:13:28] God around the world to that that's
[1:13:30] right it says subconscious something
[1:13:33] just naturally comes yeah and the more
[1:13:36] we can get out of the way the more
[1:13:37] naturally it would live our out you said
[1:13:39] I just want to wish I love more I love
[1:13:41] more I want to love more the only thing
[1:13:44] that's keeping I'm talking about you
[1:13:45] Christians born again the only thing
[1:13:47] that's keeping you is your own self
[1:13:48] being in the way the love is in there it
[1:13:51] was in there it was came to life when
[1:13:53] you're born again the love of God is
[1:13:55] there to love everyone just the same way
[1:13:57] Jesus loved people and it's there for
[1:14:00] your for your enjoyment if you would
[1:14:02] just quit your own stuff
[1:14:09] yeah and what keeps
[1:14:12] love is when you're protecting
[1:14:16] yourself Jesus showed the greatest love
[1:14:19] when he completely quit protecting
[1:14:20] himself he didn't want to Jesus did want
[1:14:23] to but he said okay I'm G spread my arms
[1:14:26] and take it I'm gonna love
[1:14:28] everybody and what keeps me from
[1:14:30] expressing love is when you might hurt
[1:14:33] me amen when you said something to hurt
[1:14:35] my feelings when you did something that
[1:14:37] I didn't like when I'm holding a grudge
[1:14:39] anything like that that's what keeps
[1:14:41] love from manifesting itself talking
[1:14:43] about the love of God something else
[1:14:46] that keeps it is our human love yeah
[1:14:49] because our human love gets in the way
[1:14:51] of God's love especially when it comes
[1:14:52] to family
[1:14:54] and we're ready to compromise we're
[1:14:56] ready to do something maybe to make
[1:14:58] exception because well that's my family
[1:14:59] that's my
[1:15:01] family come on right sometime you got to
[1:15:05] have that tough love and say yeah you're
[1:15:07] my son you're my daughter but listen
[1:15:09] this is the word of God right here we're
[1:15:10] gonna stand on the word daddy you just
[1:15:13] don't love
[1:15:15] me one day you'll
[1:15:18] see one day you'll
[1:15:20] see I think being a parent today is the
[1:15:22] hardest job the world to do it right I
[1:15:25] when I train where I work you know we we
[1:15:26] take care of kids I tell the people
[1:15:28] there I said being a good parent is
[1:15:30] extremely difficult there's so many
[1:15:33] influences on the kids and right here it
[1:15:36] is this is a gate to
[1:15:40] hell not I'm not saying get rid of it
[1:15:43] I'm saying control it if you can't
[1:15:46] control it get rid of it till you can
[1:15:49] all
[1:15:50] right boy Ione PL of saying that that's
[1:15:54] all right thank
[1:15:56] you let's keep going here all right
[1:15:59] we're going to look at Ephesians a
[1:16:00] little bit and brother bradam he was pre
[1:16:01] preaching out of Ephesians positionally
[1:16:03] placed in the church he said Ephesians
[1:16:05] parallels Joshua in that Joshua took the
[1:16:09] children of Israel and he placed and he
[1:16:10] gave their inheritance in the promised
[1:16:12] land remember that was the type of the
[1:16:13] Holy Ghost and so now Ephesians it plac
[1:16:16] the the Born Again Believers in Christ
[1:16:20] tells us who we are it tells us our
[1:16:21] inheritance tells us what we have
[1:16:23] and so we're going to read through here
[1:16:25] a little bit but before we do when
[1:16:26] brother Brandon was preaching
[1:16:27] this he says this a little bit more
[1:16:33] water all right he says now watch this
[1:16:36] Matt now I'm gonna do this read this and
[1:16:37] then I'm go back and talk we're going to
[1:16:39] read through Ephesians what what brother
[1:16:41] BR was talking about okay watch this
[1:16:43] master teacher
[1:16:45] Paul the first thing he does is knock
[1:16:47] out all the idea of Falling
[1:16:52] Away right amen you're not going to fall
[1:16:55] away friends what did it say when you
[1:16:58] make your call in election sure you will
[1:17:00] not fall keep you from falling that
[1:17:01] means falling you don't make mistakes
[1:17:03] but he's not going to fall away when you
[1:17:04] think you're going to fall you're going
[1:17:05] to find out you're standing on a rock
[1:17:07] you can't get off that rock it's already
[1:17:09] been
[1:17:10] sealed so he says you're not going to
[1:17:13] fall away quit have quit allowing Satan
[1:17:15] to give you that heart to whip on your
[1:17:17] mind and say you're not bride you're not
[1:17:19] bride if you're a bride you w be done if
[1:17:22] you're bride you would have done that
[1:17:24] those thoughts you having you know
[1:17:25] that's not yeah yeah I don't see it I
[1:17:27] just don't see you being bride you
[1:17:28] better just go for Plan B maybe you can
[1:17:31] get foolish virgin that yeah you're not
[1:17:33] gonna make
[1:17:34] it he doesn't know the future friends
[1:17:38] that's right you ever have him trying to
[1:17:40] get you to be afraid of what might
[1:17:41] happen yes yeah this might happen that
[1:17:43] might happen that he don't know the
[1:17:46] future he don't got no crystal
[1:17:48] ball right he doesn't know well this is
[1:17:52] probably going to happen to you this is
[1:17:53] probably gon to happen to you this oh
[1:17:55] shut
[1:17:56] up one of my favorite quotes lately

[1:18:20] way we need to talk to the devil he

[1:18:25] I'm going to cause this and I'm going to
[1:18:26] cause that you ain't going to do nothing
[1:18:28] the only thing he can do is what my
[1:18:30] father allows you to do you servant
[1:18:34] boy you ain't
[1:18:36] nothing come on don't be afraid to talk
[1:18:39] to him like oh what if he comes against

[1:18:42] against you hard and in hatred then
[1:18:44] you're in a wrong place he should hate
[1:18:46] you with all his
[1:18:47] might you're his destruction you're the
[1:18:50] thing that's keeping him from getting
[1:18:52] back to Heaven you're you're the one
[1:18:53] who's going to see kick him off into
[1:18:54] that place out there where he don't want
[1:18:56] to be friends we are the ones who we are
[1:18:58] there's utter destruction you're sitting
[1:19:00] here this this evening and he's out
[1:19:02] there and he's going crazy he's roaring
[1:19:04] like a li but he got no teeth why
[1:19:06] because he cannot get to the bride of
[1:19:09] Christ but but bad things happen for of
[1:19:12] course bad things happen we're human
[1:19:17] beings y That's right so he comes said
[1:19:20] you know if you know bad things going to
[1:19:21] happen if you keep being a Christian
[1:19:24] have you seen the unbelievers out there
[1:19:26] you think they're living a life of ease
[1:19:29] look at the bad things that are
[1:19:30] happening out there the difference is
[1:19:33] when bad things happen to us we have a
[1:19:37] resource their resource likes to see
[1:19:40] them

[1:20:00] of miserable
[1:20:03] pleasure all right he said knock all

[1:26:02] get back on CH verse seven in whom we
[1:26:04] have Redemption through his
[1:26:07] blood not through our works his blood he
[1:26:10] did it the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:26:13] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[1:26:16] had to bound towards us in all wisdom
[1:26:18] and Prudence having made known to us the
[1:26:20] mystery of his will
[1:26:24] the mystery of his will this is what
[1:26:26] brother BR said he said the mystery of
[1:26:28] his will he's preaching adoption he said
[1:26:30] now it's not just a little thing it's a
[1:26:32] mystery God's will is a mystery and each
[1:26:34] man has to seek out the will of God for
[1:26:37] him or herself it's God's mystery he say
[1:26:40] what is this mystery of his will that's
[1:26:42] between you and

[1:26:51] believe this way we are all in our
[1:26:53] individual walk we see you know
[1:26:56] different different levels of our
[1:26:57] character development we see this little
[1:26:59] this Revelation this person sees it here
[1:27:02] and I you this brother might have a
[1:27:04] revelation he had it for 10 years I
[1:27:05] might not get it for five more years and
[1:27:07] all of a sudden that quickens to me but
[1:27:08] I see something he don't see and it just
[1:27:10] goes with it because it's all it's
[1:27:12] individual we're all not like step by
[1:27:14] step we're all walking our own pathway
[1:27:17] and let just go ahead and encourage

[1:27:33] Spirit The Mystery of his will is for
[1:27:35] you an individual in your life
[1:27:41] personally he has made it known to us
[1:27:43] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:27:44] good pleasure which Heath purposed in
[1:27:45] himself his pleasure purposes and in
[1:27:47] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:27:49] fullness of time he might gather
[1:27:51] together in one all things in Christ
[1:27:53] both which are in heaven which are on
[1:27:54] earth even in him brother and sister we

[1:27:59] ready to gather all things in heaven and
[1:28:00] all things in Earth together and we're
[1:28:02] going to get out of here

[1:28:06] yeah in whom we also have obtained an
[1:28:11] inheritance give yourself an inheritance
[1:28:13] have you done that I think I'm gonna
[1:28:15] give I'm gonna inherit something what
[1:28:16] can I give myself you can't give
[1:28:18] yourself an inheritance someone has to
[1:28:20] give it to you yeah
[1:28:22] he's predestinated you to have an
[1:28:25] inheritance The Inheritance is this word
[1:28:28] off the page living in here that's the
[1:28:31] life of Christ that is Christ that is
[1:28:33] your inheritance that's his will for
[1:28:35] your life however that works out in your
[1:28:37] life but your inheritance is Jesus
[1:28:39] Christ
[1:28:41] himself my what what more could a person
[1:28:47] want we have an attain inheritance being
[1:28:49] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:28:51] of him who work all things after the
[1:28:52] counil is his own will it's his will is
[1:28:55] his Cel it's his inheritance is his
[1:28:57] predestination his grace it's his love
[1:28:59] it's his blood is his
[1:29:02] forgiveness now we find out what he
[1:29:04] wants from us that we should be to the
[1:29:06] trust of his GL who first trusted in
[1:29:08] Christ in whom ye also
[1:29:13] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:29:15] Truth The Gospel of your
[1:29:17] salvation that's all he's asking you
[1:29:20] you've heard the gospel of TR the word
[1:29:22] of Truth The Gospel your salvation he
[1:29:23] said now trust me all these things that
[1:29:25] I said please believe
[1:29:27] me trust me that I'm doing
[1:29:30] this
[1:29:32] yes in whom also after that ye
[1:29:35] believed that's what he wants you hear
[1:29:39] the preaching of the word you hear the
[1:29:40] word and you believe and you trust him
[1:29:42] he's going to do this and you believe in
[1:29:44] that rock that's a faith that's a rock
[1:29:45] you're standing on and that's all he's
[1:29:47] asking us to do amen Trust
[1:29:52] and believe that's how you prove who you
[1:29:56] are because there's something inside
[1:29:58] that rock this rocked hard it's Can't Be
[1:30:00] Moved it's that election it's that
[1:30:02] Revelation and that is your proof
[1:30:05] because Satan can't get you to fall away
[1:30:06] from that he's doing everything
[1:30:10] else everything
[1:30:12] else yes trust
[1:30:15] me sister Becky I'm gonna fix the roof
[1:30:19] trust
[1:30:20] me it's that
[1:30:23] simple that's why that's why he makes it
[1:30:25] so everyone no no you don't have to be
[1:30:27] smart you don't have to be educated you
[1:30:29] don't have to have all this this
[1:30:30] knowledge of the message you don't have
[1:30:32] to have you know oh I've read all the
[1:30:34] the the the messages I read the Bible
[1:30:35] four times I've done all this I Pray no
[1:30:38] no no no
[1:30:39] no
[1:30:40] trust this is what I'm doing believe it
[1:30:44] yes it's the hardest thing for a human
[1:30:46] being to do is just let
[1:30:48] go yeah let go take your hand off the
[1:30:52] wheel there you go lord it's like
[1:30:54] driving your car down the road and he's
[1:30:57] your
[1:30:58] co-pilot you know what you're doing
[1:31:00] every
[1:31:03] tree yeah but if I trust him to drive I
[1:31:06] might have a wreck have you seen your
[1:31:09] car yeah that's right you do nothing but
[1:31:13] wreck when you're driving it yes that's
[1:31:15] right get out of the seat switch seats
[1:31:17] let him
[1:31:19] drive and don't be a backseat Drive
[1:31:21] driver he don't need you to tell him
[1:31:26] how just go along for the
[1:31:29] right it's too simple isn't it it's just
[1:31:31] too
[1:31:32] simple that that that's I'm I'm
[1:31:35] convinced of this the message believers
[1:31:37] who missed the
[1:31:39] Rapture couldn't get simple
[1:31:42] enough yes they had to figure something
[1:31:44] out they had to have some sensation they
[1:31:46] had to have something that they could do
[1:31:48] they had to be something well the way I
[1:31:50] sing the way I I preach the way I pray
[1:31:53] you know it's something that I can throw
[1:31:54] into it that could get simple enough
[1:31:57] just to drop down and say I trust you I
[1:31:59] believe you yes and your word here you
[1:32:02] place in me right here I know where I am
[1:32:04] I've been predestinated I've been
[1:32:05] adopted I've been forgiven all these
[1:32:08] things this is where I am in Christ
[1:32:09] tonight because you did it
[1:32:15] all and then he wraps it up after you
[1:32:18] believed you sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:32:21] of promise sealed away can't get
[1:32:24] out oh
[1:32:27] my
[1:32:30] sealed you recognize when you're sealed
[1:32:32] you can't no one can break that seal
[1:32:34] right then what are we worried
[1:32:38] about what are we stressing about well
[1:32:42] what about my kids what about this what
[1:32:43] about that what about that that's just
[1:32:45] Satan trying to get you to lose your
[1:32:46] peace of mind that's
[1:32:50] right brother B says this for you have
[1:32:53] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:32:55] to fear oh wonder if I can just hold out
[1:32:58] oh if I can just hold out you ever feel
[1:33:01] that way if I can just hold out to the
[1:33:03] Rapture just just hold out he said hold
[1:33:07] out
[1:33:07] nothing it ain't whether I held out it's
[1:33:10] whether he held out I'm in him now well
[1:33:14] will you say well I if I'm in him now
[1:33:15] you Presbyterian say oh we always
[1:33:17] believe that but your life proves that
[1:33:18] you're not unless you walk the kind of
[1:33:19] life that he walked you believe the same
[1:33:21] gospel he
[1:33:23] preached and if you're trying to hold
[1:33:25] out is because you're not walking the
[1:33:26] right kind of life you're not seeing
[1:33:27] enough Christ in you he said I just got
[1:33:29] to hold on just try hard I got to try to
[1:33:31] overcome this I just got to try to
[1:33:33] overcome this I just got to try to
[1:33:35] over there we go friends there we go but
[1:33:38] you have to overcome yes you do have to
[1:33:40] overcome how do you go about it trust
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:43] believe yes he said he said he's already
[1:33:47] done this for you he's got you in the
[1:33:49] body all that Holiness he's he he gave
[1:33:51] you Holiness before him and and all
[1:33:53] these things he already promised this is
[1:33:54] what he sees and we're still struggling
[1:33:57] well I got to do this no brother friends
[1:33:59] you just got to believe what he
[1:34:01] said but it's a battle of course it's a
[1:34:04] battle because in spite of all the
[1:34:06] evidence Satan brings against you you
[1:34:07] stand there on the word and say yeah but
[1:34:08] I still believe the promise I was prayed
[1:34:11] for I give this to the Lord and I
[1:34:13] Stumble and fall stumble and fall but I
[1:34:15] know one day I'm going to stumble and
[1:34:16] fall for the last time because I have a
[1:34:20] promise has placed me in the body and I
[1:34:23] can't get
[1:34:24] out the Lord amen
[1:34:28] amen oh my let me read read you one more
[1:34:32] quote and I'm G be done
[1:34:34] here L church church brother Ram says
[1:34:37] remember we have shown clearly All
[1:34:39] Through the Ages that even as Adam and
[1:34:40] Eve fell before because they left the
[1:34:42] word so the Ephesian age fell by turning
[1:34:45] slightly from the word until with every
[1:34:47] age continuing turn away we have a final
[1:34:49] repudiation of the word by the World
[1:34:51] Church system system we know that has
[1:34:52] happened the World Church system has
[1:34:54] turned completely over to the image of
[1:34:56] the Beast or the Beast itself there's no
[1:34:59] light
[1:35:01] anymore there's not the leot Dean age
[1:35:04] ends in the blackout of the word thereby
[1:35:06] causing a departure of the Lord from the
[1:35:08] midst he stand stands outside calling to
[1:35:12] his own who follow him by obedience to
[1:35:15] the
[1:35:15] word after a short and Powerful
[1:35:18] demonstration of the spirit this little
[1:35:20] Hunted and persecuted group will go to
[1:35:23] be with
[1:35:25] Jesus short and Powerful
[1:35:28] demonstration when that third pull comes
[1:35:30] into effect full effect and you're going
[1:35:33] to see the bride do
[1:35:36] exploits what does that look like having
[1:35:38] a
[1:35:39] clue I don't even worry about it how
[1:35:43] much is that going on right now it could
[1:35:45] be happening right now as far as the
[1:35:46] what we're defeating the devil and all
[1:35:48] kinds of is that what it is is going to
[1:35:49] be something more than that I don't know
[1:35:50] and neither does anybody else so don't
[1:35:52] let anyone try to talk you well this is
