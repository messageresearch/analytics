[28:31] again Lord Jesus always grateful to be
[28:32] able to approach your throne of grace
[28:34] Lord and bringing up our requests before
[28:37] you father in a harsh desire tonight
[28:38] Lord as father that you'd be with each
[28:41] and every one Lord of those prayer
[28:42] requests that's been mentioned earlier
[28:44] father we ask God you just be with him
[28:45] in a special way and we believe God that
[28:48] you'll do exceedingly abundantly above
[28:50] all that we could ask or think father
[28:52] Lord you'll meet with us tonight Lord
[28:54] that you'll speak through my lips Lord
[28:56] Jesus and use my heart mind father to
[28:58] speak to your children the things that
[29:00] you once said tonight to encourage us to
[29:02] strengthen us Lord that we might be
[29:04] closer to you might be you ready for the
[29:07] Rapture that lays ahead Lord and father
[29:09] as we come into your house we ask God
[29:11] that we just know that you're here
[29:13] father because you said you would be
[29:15] wherever two or three would be gathered
[29:16] you'd be in our midst we ask God that
[29:18] you just give us unction of the holy
[29:20] spirit for what to speak tonight in
[29:23] Jesus name amen and amen amen I feel
[29:26] like I have a new message amen tonight
[29:28] amen and so I always like new messages
[29:31] amen amen I was thinking earlier I says
[29:34] evangelist you know you could take some
[29:35] of these good messages at least it gets
[29:37] laid on your heart and you could just go
[29:39] all over the country and preach it amen
[29:40] amen and preach one sermon probably for
[29:42] a month or two you know but I mean when
[29:45] you're a pastor well you just can't
[29:46] preach the same message everything every
[29:49] sermon so you always digging a little
[29:51] deeper amen amen trying to get up some
[29:54] some fresh meat amen I always like fresh
[29:56] meat fresh
[29:58] amen when the Lord just lays something
[30:00] on something on your heart amen and once
[30:03] again it's a little simple thought but
[30:05] amen I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[30:07] amen
[30:08] if you will let's turn our Bibles in our
[30:11] scene is going to start amen at Calvary
[30:15] amen
[30:17] so I have
[30:19] um different stories I want to tell but
[30:22] I'm going to start with Luke 23
[30:26] amen we'll go to Mount Calvary and look
[30:29] amen what the Lord will have for us
[30:32] amen and so but a jewel has booked the
[30:35] flight for the first of next month amen
[30:37] so he's going to be up here
[30:39] ministering for us the first of next
[30:41] month Lord willing
[30:43] him
[30:44] and so we look forward to seeing him
[30:46] amen
[30:47] amen so
[30:50] Let's uh go to Luke 23
[30:53] and verse 39.
[30:56] and this is the thought that began in my
[30:58] mind Amen in my heart amen this is what
[31:01] started it and so then we go from there
[31:04] amen and one of the male factors which
[31:07] were hanged railed on him saying if thou
[31:11] be Christ
[31:13] save thyself verse 39 if you're still
[31:16] look at verse 23 verse 39 say thyself
[31:19] and US amen
[31:23] now notice how he says and us
[31:26] so he wanted to be saved didn't he
[31:28] amen but there's still something wrong
[31:31] with his repentance isn't it
[31:33] I mean there's something wrong with that
[31:35] because maybe he just wanted to come off
[31:37] the cross and maybe go do the same
[31:39] things he did before
[31:41] amen
[31:42] amen so but the other answering rebuked
[31:47] him saying thus not thou fear God seeing
[31:51] that thou art in the same condemnation
[31:54] and we indeed just before we receive the
[31:57] due reward of our Deeds but this man has
[32:00] done nothing amid
[32:02] and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me
[32:06] when thou cometh into thy kingdom and
[32:09] Jesus said unto him verily I say unto
[32:12] thee today Thou shalt be with me in
[32:15] Paradise amen
[32:17] may God had his blessings to the reading
[32:19] of the word you can be seated
[32:21] amen
[32:22] and
[32:25] at night I want to speak about so close
[32:29] yet so far
[32:32] so close yet so far amen
[32:36] so I was mentioning that to my wife and
[32:38] she says you know what what uh
[32:43] what is good what is close
[32:46] are almost good for
[32:51] it's the saying is close is no good
[32:54] except for
[32:57] there you go
[33:02] and the attitude that came along with it
[33:05] amen Christ will bring it to pass and
[33:08] this man had the right attitude and he
[33:10] said the right words can you imagine
[33:12] living all your life and and doing all
[33:15] of the things that he
[33:16] has done
[33:18] but yet because
[33:19] lots of nine words you're granted
[33:23] eternal life
[33:24] to have Jesus and see in Paradise
[33:31] can you imagine
[33:33] what a reply what a sweet
[33:37] sound
[33:38] that must
[33:40] have been
[33:42] yeah
[33:46] and isn't it something how that all he
[33:48] asked the Lord to do is to remember him
[33:50] just remember me
[33:53] is that right
[33:55] but you know something else that I got
[33:58] he said look man you are here and we're
[34:01] getting what we deserve but that man
[34:02] ain't done nothing
[34:03] [Music]
[34:05] the Bible say one place you know if you
[34:07] confess me I'll confess you if you stand
[34:10] for Christ Christ will stand for you
[34:13] and he was standing up for Christ
[34:17] we didn't hear him make big confessions
[34:19] about what he had to understand all he
[34:22] asked is remember me and Christ knew
[34:25] what was in his heart didn't he
[34:28] therefore he ex totally erased all of
[34:31] his sins and told him that you're going
[34:33] to be with me Paradise today that man I
[34:37] don't care how much pain he was in and
[34:39] out condition he had reason for
[34:42] rejoicing and being happy
[34:44] because he told him he's going to be in
[34:46] Paradise
[34:48] but you know
[34:50] this is a double this is a I want to use
[34:53] this for a
[34:55] this is a a doubling
[34:57] example tonight
[35:00] amen of of people that were right at the
[35:04] break and right at the edge come so
[35:07] close
[35:08] but yet didn't make it hear this man can
[35:11] you imagine if the other Thief would
[35:12] have had the same attitude
[35:14] he could have been granted
[35:17] eternal life by nine words
[35:21] all right
[35:26] so close
[35:27] nine words
[35:33] sometimes it's even less words than that
[35:36] that have been spoken
[35:37] people missed Heaven by just seven words
[35:40] some of them are
[35:41] some of these examples are only seven
[35:43] words nine words
[35:45] amen the difference between Heaven and
[35:47] Hell life or death
[35:53] amen
[35:55] but what a glorious thing it was for him
[35:59] and how many believe that when we get
[36:00] only get to meet this man right here you
[36:03] know
[36:04] I don't wanna
[36:06] just take a rabbit Trail but remember
[36:08] the story of those that atheist and the
[36:11] little girl coming home
[36:13] from Sunday school about
[36:15] what was it about that fish swallow and
[36:18] Jonah or whatever you don't really
[36:20] believe that or the man said young lady
[36:22] he says well he said you know and she
[36:23] says well when I get to heaven I'll I'll
[36:25] ask him is that right
[36:28] and well he said well if what if he
[36:30] ain't there and she said well then
[36:32] you'll have to ask him
[36:35] Maybe
[36:39] you talking about
[36:43] the babes right
[36:47] oh my
[36:49] God but think about it you know think
[36:51] about this here and I just really love
[36:52] it because just it's just so close I
[36:56] thought it was so close
[36:59] everybody talks about it
[37:02] would be so close
[37:04] the real thing it would deceive the very
[37:06] elected if it was possible
[37:09] it's just one decision away
[37:13] just one choice away had the right
[37:16] attitude
[37:17] if I just said the right thing in
[37:19] another story
[37:23] person was
[37:25] uh right close so close
[37:29] yet so far
[37:32] it's the story of the rich young man
[37:35] that came to Christ wanting eternal life
[37:37] remember
[37:39] and behold this is in chapter 19 of
[37:42] Matthew verse 16 19 and 16. and Bill
[37:46] what came and said unto him good Master
[37:48] what good things shall I do that I may
[37:50] have eternal life notice how he was
[37:52] Desiring eternal life
[37:54] and he said
[37:57] him why color stop me good there is none
[37:59] good but one and that is God but if thou
[38:02] will enter into life keep the
[38:04] Commandments he saith unto him which and
[38:06] Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[38:08] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[38:10] steal Thou shalt not bear Falls with
[38:15] so the young man saith unto them all
[38:19] these things have I kept from my youth
[38:22] huh
[38:24] wow this guy was righteous
[38:30] huh to be able to look Jesus in the face
[38:32] and say I've committed kept all of these
[38:34] from my youth
[38:36] and Jesus never know you didn't never
[38:38] disputed it
[38:40] tell us how close he was it reminds me
[38:42] of the virgins remember the virgins ten
[38:45] merges five were foolish some were wise
[38:48] notice how they were virgins they were
[38:50] pure they were clean
[38:52] they lived totally lives let me tell you
[38:55] how many
[38:57] a lot of people that don't do a bunch of
[38:59] wrong things they live holy lives they
[39:02] live clean lives
[39:04] they just lack one thing and that's oil
[39:07] in their limbs how many knows when they
[39:09] go to Knocking on that door
[39:11] that's the only thing that didn't get
[39:13] them in was not having all in their life
[39:16] folk don't you can't just live a
[39:17] righteous and holy life and be clean and
[39:19] all you've got to be baptized with the
[39:22] Holy
[39:22] ghosts
[39:25] so this man asks oh
[39:28] that's the question I've done this from
[39:30] my youth what lack I yet can we
[39:34] definitely say Amen the boy was asking
[39:36] the right questions
[39:40] and that's a question that every one of
[39:41] us should ask tonight Lord where do I
[39:44] still lack
[39:46] because how many knows that you know
[39:50] uh let me think
[39:54] what's almost perfect
[39:58] how would you describe almost perfect
[40:07] I would say imperfect
[40:11] you're not perfect if you're not you're
[40:12] almost perfect but you're not so you're
[40:14] imperfect
[40:15] it's like
[40:17] being ready right
[40:19] looking for something a little bit
[40:20] different brother Glenn
[40:22] because you're almost there but just not
[40:24] how about the Rapture well I almost made
[40:26] the Rapture did you you know I didn't
[40:29] help you admit that you almost made it
[40:31] but I was almost ready
[40:33] [Music]
[40:42] how'd you notice that when the devil
[40:43] came almost right it was 99 and he's a
[40:47] white lie
[40:50] what is another description of a white
[40:52] lie
[40:55] it's just plain alive
[40:59] it's still alive
[41:02] and there's we say white lie
[41:05] because we're trying to do
[41:08] describe it as being
[41:11] right
[41:13] because you think white if it's a lie
[41:14] it's still black
[41:17] [Music]
[41:20] folks I want you to understand something
[41:22] the Bible says it in this last days
[41:24] people will live such a life
[41:27] the ones that's even the thing that's
[41:30] deceit
[41:31] leaving it's gonna be almost
[41:35] huh
[41:38] what was it that young man testified the
[41:41] other day amen I believe it was David he
[41:44] was talking about how that day we're
[41:45] talking about these two Jesus or Jesus
[41:48] and the father and they got talking
[41:49] about the father amen because if you
[41:51] come with that give come if you come up
[41:53] with two plus two equals something
[41:57] different than four hello and if you
[41:59] come up with Doctrine plus Doctrine and
[42:01] you've got more than one God you've got
[42:03] it wrong
[42:06] one baptism
[42:09] I am God besides me I know nothing is it
[42:13] your Redeemer Christ was Our Redeemer
[42:15] everything more than that
[42:18] you have got a problem
[42:19] of course it takes oh my let me night
[42:23] just comes to mind can I go on here
[42:25] before we finish this story
[42:27] but even the disciples how many knows
[42:29] that Jesus was with the disciples
[42:32] and they were so close to him but yet
[42:35] they didn't know him
[42:37] anybody said he said if I've been so
[42:39] long with you then you don't know who
[42:41] the father is
[42:42] yeah
[42:43] we're so close but they still didn't
[42:46] have it
[42:52] it's like
[42:54] arguing with somebody that is is
[42:57] absolutely set
[42:59] you gotta
[43:00] have ties in the titles out
[43:04] Matthew 28 go into all the one preaching
[43:07] gospel Every Creature baptizing them to
[43:09] find us on the Holy Ghost
[43:12] you still ain't got it
[43:14] it's so close but yet
[43:16] just like that thief on the cross he was
[43:20] right there
[43:23] all they had to do say you have her
[43:25] still
[43:26] on me
[43:28] he was right there
[43:30] Simon the fairest
[43:31] they send his servant out there I tell
[43:35] Jesus that invite him to dinner he says
[43:37] I wonder when that servant came to Jesus
[43:39] or he just gave him the note or just
[43:41] give him enough
[43:42] what's up
[43:46] want you to come to dinner tomorrow
[43:48] night and off you win confident many
[43:52] how they got in the presence of Jesus I
[43:54] don't want to fall down I am he had his
[43:57] chance he was right there so close
[44:01] but where is he today
[44:03] amen
[44:06] so close
[44:07] yet so far
[44:14] well we can certainly bring it down to
[44:16] our age
[44:18] Christ was so close
[44:20] he was so close to everybody
[44:23] he was Jesus himself was so close to all
[44:27] these churches
[44:28] those ministers in Chicago
[44:31] huh
[44:41] and yet all those places are hard not
[44:45] right there
[44:46] and one time brother man was preaching
[44:48] in my many many different times he was
[44:50] preaching it says and he would preach
[44:51] his sermon and he would say now how many
[44:53] ones
[44:54] does it come and give their hearts to
[44:56] the Lord when I come up front and give
[44:58] their hearts to the Lord would you
[44:59] discernment or anything like that
[45:02] and just a few of them would come and he
[45:04] said that hurt him
[45:07] what was brother Benham doing brother by
[45:09] Adam was trying to get people that you
[45:10] don't go by sight
[45:13] huh
[45:15] too many Thomases you got to see before
[45:17] you believe and then after what place I
[45:20] heard him he says after discernment then
[45:21] they would come and he says you've been
[45:23] deceived
[45:25] deceived
[45:27] yeah because you're just going by sight
[45:30] how many knows we don't go by sight
[45:33] whether you see it or not you know it's
[45:34] the word of God you know Christ is here
[45:37] say I want to give my heart to God I
[45:39] don't have to see anything
[45:41] amen
[45:43] my
[45:44] believe anyway it's more blessed
[45:47] to believe and not have Saul he told
[45:50] Thomas
[45:50] that have seen him believe
[45:53] amen oh my
[45:57] God so we see here what like I yet and
[45:59] Jesus said I didn't see him if thou will
[46:02] be perfect go and sell that thou Hast
[46:07] and give to the poor
[46:12] just what
[46:13] Sydney
[46:14] but can we say
[46:16] come on let's go just like he did to
[46:18] Peter John
[46:19] come on follow me
[46:22] huh give him the invitation to come and
[46:25] follow him
[46:32] let me tell you something
[46:38] and he knew where that young man lacked
[46:41] he knew that he loved his treasures and
[46:44] he loved the things of the world
[46:46] huh that's why Jesus said uh
[46:49] Saint John's there it says love not the
[46:52] world or the things of the world of your
[46:53] man love the things of the world the
[46:55] love of God ain't in him
[46:59] can I say something it's not if you love
[47:00] the things of the world and it takes
[47:02] more of your time of God in your home
[47:05] heart
[47:07] huh
[47:09] these
[47:11] two she's come
[47:13] a different time do I have to you don't
[47:16] go to church
[47:18] I have a hard time believing that you're
[47:19] a Christian
[47:22] because if God's in your heart you can't
[47:24] wait
[47:25] for them doors
[47:27] that's where God say Amen
[47:31] amen
[47:32] amen
[47:36] all right so he says go and sell at thou
[47:39] house and give to the poor and thou
[47:41] shalt have treasure and come and follow
[47:44] me and the young man heard to say he was
[47:48] away sorrowful for
[47:51] be a great possession
[47:53] sure it was a bunch of stuff
[47:56] sure was a lot he was a rich man
[47:59] foolish
[48:01] that is
[48:07] another Revelation today or this week
[48:10] hell is going to be full of wishful's
[48:14] thinking
[48:15] people are going to do a lot of wishing
[48:18] over there
[48:21] huh
[48:22] they'll wish they had done different
[48:25] that rich young man whoever he is let me
[48:28] tell you I'm sure he is one
[48:30] wish
[48:31] she
[48:33] had made the right choice
[48:36] he wished
[48:38] autonomy
[48:39] right there
[48:41] and I missed
[48:44] how do I know that about the wishing
[48:47] thing because remember Jesus said there
[48:49] was a man that fared well brother man
[48:51] said the young man
[48:52] and got richer and everything
[48:55] else but
[48:56] went to hell Lazarus he was went to
[48:59] heaven isn't that right
[49:01] and the rich man lifted up his eyes and
[49:03] hell and so forth and that's lives were
[49:04] just come give him some code water on
[49:06] his tongue and so forth and then he got
[49:07] them preaching to Abraham and descend
[49:09] louder
[49:12] my brother not come to this place he all
[49:14] of a sudden wished he had a chance to
[49:16] tell people not to come to this place
[49:19] you know
[49:21] you know I really think that that story
[49:23] ought to convert the whole world
[49:25] there's that story right there applies
[49:27] to everybody that ever hears that story
[49:33] he went to hell he would lift up he said
[49:35] oh God I want somebody to go back and I
[49:37] want you that they would believe him
[49:40] that Abraham says he
[49:41] got the law and the prophets and Abraham
[49:45] clearly told him he says you are wrong
[49:47] if they will not believe the law and the
[49:49] prophets neither will they have to leave
[49:51] until one raised from the dead how about
[49:53] in our day God raised 12 13 people from
[49:56] the dead and people still all believe
[49:59] foreign
[50:03] Nicodemus was another one that came
[50:06] close
[50:09] got the Jesus got to be born again Jesus
[50:12] said
[50:12] how can I be born in this Saturday with
[50:14] you listen
[50:16] and
[50:18] I mean it was it because Nicodemus told
[50:20] on them
[50:22] he says we know and you are a teacher
[50:25] sent from God because nobody can do
[50:27] these things
[50:29] let's see what is a god they knew he was
[50:33] of God
[50:42] gonna be a lot of preachers in this
[50:44] generation that knew
[50:45] that he was the prophet of God
[50:47] that he could have never done those
[50:49] things with the seventh grade education
[50:50] all his hates and totes and fetches and
[50:53] uh straw tick beds and
[50:56] hello all the things common hillbilly
[51:01] could have never went even so sad ended
[51:04] up doing it I hated
[51:07] huh I hope he did
[51:10] because if he couldn't have seen that
[51:12] hey God did fulfill his will is that
[51:15] right
[51:17] I don't know though
[51:19] I don't know though because he wanted to
[51:22] have brother Brandon ordain women
[51:23] preachers and brother Branham quit the
[51:25] church because
[51:27] so it looks a little bit questionable
[51:29] don't it
[51:30] but a man can repent so hopefully that's
[51:32] what he did
[51:34] but notice
[51:35] how close I mean it's a Pharisees
[51:38] well they were right there time and time
[51:40] again
[51:45] he's late in the grave his nose on
[51:48] forsaken it
[51:53] throws the stone away and breaks the man
[51:55] out
[51:57] everybody
[51:57] ought to fall on their knees
[51:59] cause I'm here so it's got to be today
[52:03] disappointed
[52:05] disappointed
[52:07] wishing
[52:09] in hell that they had made a different
[52:11] choice
[52:14] amen how many knows
[52:17] people can laugh and Mock and they can
[52:19] worship the devil openly they can do all
[52:21] of those things but know this God's
[52:23] going to have the last laugh
[52:29] amen the last laugh that's right I will
[52:32] laugh at your calamity
[52:33] when your distress comes on you
[52:37] huh all of a sudden you go from where a
[52:40] a devil outfit and into a saint you fall
[52:43] down you'll be laughing
[52:47] huh
[52:50] because God is Not mocked by the man
[52:52] sows that will he also reap
[52:56] amen
[52:59] just that one thing
[53:01] one two three four five six seven eight
[53:04] nine ten eleven and then come and follow
[53:07] me just a few words
[53:09] come and follow me
[53:18] in life as
[53:21] believer a Christian
[53:23] when God asks you to forsake all I'm all
[53:26] yours or not do that's what I'm here to
[53:28] do
[53:29] because that's what God demands how many
[53:31] believes that
[53:32] you're not willing to forsake all your
[53:34] own ideas your own previous teaching and
[53:36] everything to follow me
[53:40] I'm not the gonna well
[53:42] he wasn't quite right but I'm gonna go
[53:44] ahead and take him in they ain't gonna
[53:45] be that
[53:47] almost no almost with God
[53:50] amen
[53:54] and that Prophet says there's no black
[53:56] white bird
[53:57] no sinner saint
[54:00] you're either Saint or
[54:02] sinner
[54:05] how many knows that when you're filled
[54:06] with the Holy Ghost
[54:08] if God accepts your repentance and he
[54:10] washes you why the blood of the Lamb
[54:12] father God said you're the very
[54:13] righteousness of God
[54:15] you're as righteous as God is righteous
[54:18] but it's his righteousness in you and I
[54:21] now we don't go wrong saying I am so
[54:23] righteous we don't feel that way we
[54:25] don't we don't do that but we know that
[54:27] that's the truth
[54:29] that's the word of God
[54:33] amen
[54:34] yeah
[54:39] the very righteousness of God
[54:42] before coming out here you
[54:45] were worshiping and singing and let me
[54:47] tell you something no matter how common
[54:48] it seems to come to church no matter how
[54:50] much comedy seems to sing amazing right
[54:53] when we cut together like this we
[54:55] worship we're doing the greatest thing
[54:58] and be done
[55:01] I can't hear you we're doing the
[55:03] greatest thing can be done when we come
[55:05] to church worship God praise him and
[55:08] love him and hear his word
[55:10] there is no higher order
[55:12] days not he's not greater
[55:15] than that the preacher I'm the Holy
[55:18] Ghost give you the word of God and for
[55:20] you to receive it
[55:23] he that believeth shall be saved he
[55:25] doesn't even
[55:29] so close
[55:32] just one choice away
[55:35] one choice
[55:37] between hell
[55:39] in heaven
[55:40] one decision
[55:43] that right
[55:45] and you're defined by the decisions that
[55:48] you
[55:52] because we know when
[55:54] Pharisees wouldn't accept the Lord my
[55:57] word has no place in you if Abraham was
[55:59] your father
[56:02] is not Abraham but you are of your
[56:05] father the devil
[56:12] that's right
[56:18] you know
[56:20] bothered today
[56:22] that's why you don't believe me
[56:25] I would always choose what we do
[56:28] oh my I don't want to wish to you
[56:31] the wish for something is to almost get
[56:33] it maybe
[56:35] no you'll have to wish
[56:37] brother Danny I heard your sermon on
[56:39] don't try to have faith I was listening
[56:41] to the house
[56:46] do it believe
[56:49] I thought he must have been let's see
[56:51] that
[56:52] that's right don't just try do it
[56:58] praise be to God
[57:00] amen
[57:03] all right
[57:05] my
[57:11] my Israel
[57:13] Israel was so close
[57:15] how many weeks ago said two weeks
[57:18] two weeks Journey
[57:20] something like that from what they were
[57:23] to where they were supposed to go
[57:25] still wondering 40 years later there
[57:29] were shout clouds
[57:30] but because of the condition that they
[57:32] were in oh my when I think about it the
[57:34] Bible the word of God is so close it's
[57:36] right there
[57:40] Deliverance is right there
[57:42] the Holy Ghost is right there
[57:46] quit wandering you're complaining your
[57:50] negative attitude your unbelief
[57:53] this has been mentioned several times
[57:56] about brother Bannerman that's one man
[57:57] was I've been seeking the Holy Ghost
[58:03] Say he answered him correctly didn't he
[58:07] there must be doubt in there
[58:12] what are you doubting for cause the
[58:15] minute you genuinely believe
[58:17] so you genuinely believe God is
[58:20] obligated that he
[58:22] will fill you with the Holy Ghost
[58:24] it's only doubt that keeps you from your
[58:26] promises
[58:34] it's our greatest enemy is that doubt
[58:37] unbelief
[58:39] amen
[58:43] and they're lack of believing
[58:52] did you ever meet somebody that just
[58:54] absolutely has no self-control
[58:56] huh
[58:58] that's how Israel was
[59:00] whatever the flesh desired that's
[59:02] but they
[59:04] do and every time they felt like
[59:05] complaining they got hungry and oh man
[59:07] they dude
[59:09] thirst and left no Shout self-control
[59:18] I'll tell you what God don't like it
[59:20] I'm great about you
[59:24] amen I don't care if you got to repent
[59:27] of something every day you repent of it
[59:29] God will see that repentance you see you
[59:31] got great he mean it
[59:33] huh
[59:35] oh my but notice
[59:37] that's how Israel was they were weak
[59:40] except for a couple of them isn't that
[59:42] right
[59:43] because we all know that because oh my
[59:47] let me tell you I believe rapturing face
[59:48] in this message
[59:51] when we see what God has done into
[59:53] Miracles and all that and that's what
[59:55] brother Brandon refers to look at what
[59:56] God's done if that don't give you
[59:57] rapturing faith I don't know what will
[1:00:01] I'm not
[1:00:02] Almost Persuaded that this message is
[1:00:04] true of God I'm an almost persuaded that
[1:00:07] that killer fire that you see is the
[1:00:09] very God that let the children
[1:00:11] not in the wilderness with the pillar of
[1:00:13] fire it's a same Pillar of Fire
[1:00:16] I'm 100 can be 100
[1:00:19] it's
[1:00:21] oh my
[1:00:22] and I want to pull up how many would see
[1:00:25] Jesus
[1:00:26] a bunch of times
[1:00:29] and he talked about those
[1:00:31] the Greeks
[1:00:34] that they came up to the disciples and
[1:00:36] so forth
[1:00:37] Jesus
[1:00:39] we would see Jesus and he kept they're
[1:00:43] saying look whatever Jesus did yesterday
[1:00:45] that's what he would do today
[1:00:48] and then he would do it at the end this
[1:00:49] every class would come and say not skip
[1:00:52] it's him if they wanted to see him you
[1:00:55] can see him
[1:00:57] I wonder where those Greeks are today
[1:00:58] did they really accept him did
[1:01:01] they receive him
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:05] well what about this generation
[1:01:08] he certainly was here he was in front of
[1:01:10] everybody
[1:01:12] what do you think brother Brad a man
[1:01:14] when he would say now he is here
[1:01:17] I'm waiting on him now he's here
[1:01:21] that was him that was Christ
[1:01:24] that was Jesus
[1:01:27] in the form of the Holy Ghost in his
[1:01:30] body
[1:01:31] which is called the church
[1:01:33] doing what brother bam says he said
[1:01:35] Greater Works indeed shall you do we're
[1:01:37] more working you know right the body was
[1:01:40] going to do more Works than what Jesus
[1:01:42] himself did here on there and he
[1:01:44] certainly did ten times the size of
[1:01:46] Pentecost
[1:01:50] and what about the 500 000 or so an
[1:01:53] African different ones that through
[1:01:55] their Idols down under dust

[1:02:46] just couldn't get himself to do it
[1:02:49] the Rich Young Ruler he just couldn't
[1:02:51] get himself to do it
[1:02:55] I want to jump on top of this pulpit
[1:02:58] when you think about the fact that God
[1:03:00] put something in you
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:07] to help you with that they just can't
[1:03:10] cross that line
[1:03:12] they just can't make that decision they
[1:03:14] don't want it
[1:03:17] they might be
[1:03:20] like being so much so until he killed
[1:03:21] him
[1:03:22] then when God says well Hey where's your
[1:03:24] brother he says I don't know am I My
[1:03:26] Brother's Keeper lie to God
[1:03:30] right to his face
[1:03:33] what a horrible person huh
[1:03:38] foreign
[1:03:45] a woman is that five husbands just mired
[1:03:49] up people won't even come and drink the
[1:03:51] same time she does but when he comes out
[1:03:53] there when the light flashes it costs
[1:03:55] her death she accepts it
[1:03:59] man I'm here to tell you when the Son of
[1:04:01] God hears the truth he can't help
[1:04:03] themselves they're gonna accept What God
[1:04:05] Says
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:07] that's the difference
[1:04:11] oh the world don't want to hear it but
[1:04:13] it's the truth there's children of God
[1:04:15] in the Earth
[1:04:16] there is Children of the devil the
[1:04:18] children of the devil will never
[1:04:20] want it they won't accept
[1:04:22] it
[1:04:24] no matter how plain it is
[1:04:27] no matter how
[1:04:29] open it is
[1:04:35] deniable it is
[1:04:40] don't get me down in the message of
[1:04:42] people around this message hello
[1:04:45] huh
[1:04:46] comes right down to where people live
[1:04:51] amen
[1:04:54] okay praise the Lord
[1:04:57] you love him
[1:05:01] amen if it's not quite perfect it's
[1:05:04] imperfect it's
[1:05:06] perfect
[1:05:10] not almost perfect
[1:05:12] almost or just about
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:18] you know I believe can I just say
[1:05:19] something comes to mind I believe that's
[1:05:21] why people don't get the Holy Ghost
[1:05:23] they try so hard but God knows there's
[1:05:26] still
[1:05:27] that they're not willing to turn loose
[1:05:28] of
[1:05:30] they're not letting go
[1:05:33] amen has to become the way that he wants
[1:05:35] you to come
[1:05:36] and when you do
[1:05:38] God will give you the baptism
[1:05:41] I'm so glad for that
[1:05:44] um
[1:05:47] all right
[1:05:49] let's go to another story
[1:05:52] a core story it's going to require a
[1:05:54] little bit of reading so go with me the
[1:05:56] book
[1:05:57] acts if you will I want to read this
[1:05:59] it's kind of false testimony
[1:06:03] and we want to get to the almost
[1:06:07] 26.
[1:06:15] ax
[1:06:16] okay let's go with number
[1:06:19] chapter 25 and then we'll go to verse
[1:06:22] then Agrippa said I'm too fast that he
[1:06:25] died
[1:06:26] oh shall hear him
[1:06:28] verse 26 then Agrippa said unto Paul
[1:06:34] permitted to speak for thyself then Paul
[1:06:36] stretched forth his hand and answered
[1:06:38] for himself
[1:06:40] think myself happy King Agrippa because
[1:06:43] that I shall answer for myself boy ball
[1:06:46] had confidence
[1:06:48] isn't it right remember Jesus said
[1:06:50] whenever you're brought before the Kings
[1:06:51] don't think about what you're going to
[1:06:53] say because the Holy Ghost will give you
[1:06:54] what you have to say
[1:06:56] and Paul certainly believed that and he
[1:06:59] certainly manifested that scripture
[1:07:02] I think myself happy King Agrippa
[1:07:04] because I shall answer for myself this
[1:07:06] day before thee touching all the things
[1:07:08] whereof I am accused
[1:07:13] of the Jews especially because I Know
[1:07:17] Thee to be expert in all Customs beseech
[1:07:21] you to hear me patiently
[1:07:24] my manner of life from my youth
[1:07:27] which was at the first among my old
[1:07:30] Nation at Jerusalem
[1:07:32] all the Jews they all know my manner
[1:07:36] and now I stand and I am judged for the
[1:07:39] hope of the promise made of God under
[1:07:41] our
[1:07:42] notice how he says God made the promise
[1:07:45] under our fathers and that's what I'm
[1:07:46] calling question about
[1:07:47] unto Rich a day and night hope to come
[1:07:51] for which hope
[1:07:53] say King Agrippa I'm accused of the Jews
[1:07:58] why
[1:08:00] should
[1:08:02] it be thought a thing incredible with
[1:08:04] you that God should
[1:08:07] do many
[1:08:08] things contra
[1:08:12] pieces of Nazareth
[1:08:14] which thing I also did in Jerusalem and
[1:08:17] many of the Saints did I shut up in
[1:08:19] prison having received
[1:08:21] and when they were put to death I gave
[1:08:24] my voice against them
[1:08:26] and I punished it and being exceedingly
[1:08:29] mad against them upper
[1:08:32] execute
[1:08:33] them even and to these people
[1:08:37] how many knows
[1:08:39] he was missing the mark
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:43] on as I went to Damascus with authority
[1:08:47] and commission from the chief
[1:08:49] priests at midday okay I saw in the way
[1:08:52] a light from heaven above the brightness
[1:08:55] of the sun shining round about me
[1:08:58] and them which journeyed with me and
[1:09:01] when we were all Fallen to the earth I
[1:09:03] heard a boy speaking banging into you
[1:09:05] Bhutan Saul Saul I persecuted
[1:09:09] it is
[1:09:11] hard for thee to kick again the pricks
[1:09:14] and I said whom our thou Lord and he
[1:09:17] said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest
[1:09:21] but rise and stand upon thy feet for I
[1:09:25] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[1:09:26] to make thee Minister and the witness
[1:09:29] both of these things which thou has seen
[1:09:32] and of those things in which I will
[1:09:34] today delivering thee from the people
[1:09:37] and from the Gentiles
[1:09:39] unto whom now I sent thee to open their
[1:09:43] eyes and to turn them from Darkness to
[1:09:47] light
[1:09:49] and
[1:09:50] from the
[1:09:51] power of Satan unto God
[1:09:55] that they may receive forgiveness of sin
[1:09:58] faith that is in Me whereupon O King
[1:10:01] Agrippa
[1:10:02] I was not disobedient unto the Heavenly
[1:10:06] visioned
[1:10:08] now let's stop there for a minute
[1:10:09] Chicago one place brother banham
[1:10:12] begin to go and he was you know either a
[1:10:14] Minister's a breakfast or somewhere
[1:10:18] and
[1:10:20] he began to open up
[1:10:22] the services
[1:10:24] dead and he read these
[1:10:28] picture
[1:10:29] I was not a disobedient unto the
[1:10:32] heavenly vision
[1:10:34] and they knew that he was going to tell
[1:10:36] the story of how that voice spoke out of
[1:10:39] a tree don't smoke or just this is where
[1:10:42] the Lord came to him and so forth and
[1:10:43] until five preachers took off the back
[1:10:46] row and how they went okay you might
[1:10:48] hear none of that
[1:10:51] think about that foreign
[1:10:55] just saying look I'm gonna tell you is
[1:10:58] what I seen but God told me
[1:11:01] just like Paul did

[1:11:14] master
[1:11:15] 's
[1:11:16] Jerusalem
[1:11:17] in other words he preached to him
[1:11:20] and throughout all the coasts of Judea
[1:11:22] and then to the Gentiles that they
[1:11:24] should repent and turn to God and do
[1:11:26] Works meet for repentance
[1:11:29] for these causes
[1:11:31] the Jews caught me in the temple and
[1:11:33] went about to kill me having therefore
[1:11:35] obtained help from God I continued unto
[1:11:38] this day witnessing both the small and
[1:11:40] great saying none other thing than those
[1:11:43] things which the prophets and Moses did
[1:11:45] say should come in other words I'm just
[1:11:48] saying what they said this conch was
[1:11:49] good it would come he should be the
[1:11:51] flight
[1:11:52] unto the people and said with a loud
[1:11:56] voice Paul mad

[1:12:02] Festus had to cut it
[1:12:05] then yeah you're mad much learning has
[1:12:08] made me mad
[1:12:11] but he said I am not mad
[1:12:15] most noble Festus but speak truth

[1:12:39] Agrippa do you believe the prophets I
[1:12:42] know you believe the prophets

[1:13:09] he's
[1:13:10] saying man I almost did
[1:13:14] I was that close I knew it was the truth

[1:15:53] the door

[1:15:57] one thing world you only have to do one
[1:16:01] thing one thing

[1:16:14] amen and he doesn't open up I like that
[1:16:18] to him but openness will I come in
[1:16:21] and I will accept with him
[1:16:27] whoa
[1:16:28] butter why do you get sick
[1:16:31] excited why
[1:16:33] why because I'm stepping with him
[1:16:36] every day I'm something about him and I
[1:16:39] got my mind the penny reveals these
[1:16:41] little snuggies to me and the guy that
[1:16:43] he's just talking to me he's shopping
[1:16:46] with me he's shopping with you

[1:16:54] Lord more
[1:16:59] it can change your whole day your whole
[1:17:01] you can make everything so much better
[1:17:03] all right but nobody's knocking off he's
[1:17:07] not just standing there quiet
[1:17:09] foreign
[1:17:20] open
[1:17:22] your heart
[1:17:24] see that's right the word of God Is
[1:17:26] Right
[1:17:27] that's the truth
[1:17:29] and let him in
[1:17:32] so close
[1:17:34] so close
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:40] open at the Welsh
[1:17:44] she was far away from God
[1:17:47] she was far away that thief on the cross
[1:17:49] he was far away
[1:17:51] in his spiritual State he was a sinner
[1:17:54] condemned to judgment
[1:17:57] but yet
[1:17:59] he came to Christ same with the woman at
[1:18:02] the Welsh she was so far stupid in sin
[1:18:05] but yet when Christ come
[1:18:07] along
[1:18:11] aren't you glad that you're not like the
[1:18:14] Pharisees he said about the Pharisees he
[1:18:15] says these people drawn onto me with
[1:18:19] their lips but just a few inches in
[1:18:22] their heart is far from Monday
[1:18:26] they come close with their lips but
[1:18:29] their hearts sway somewhere else
[1:18:32] outwardly they appear righteous before
[1:18:36] that
[1:18:38] but in we're legit to live up and inside
[1:18:40] there's their heart is a sepulch it's a
[1:18:44] tomb and inside of that is nothing but
[1:18:46] dried old bones the outward says on
[1:18:49] their righteous and they're holding and
[1:18:50] they're alive in God but inside there
[1:18:53] are better than that and that's the way
[1:18:55] a lot of so-called Christians are
[1:18:58] foreign
[1:19:01] but it's the inside that has to be alive
[1:19:04] how many knows you can come to church to
[1:19:06] sing songs and all that but clear are
[1:19:08] you at
[1:19:09] here
[1:19:13] are you
[1:19:14] close to him in here
[1:19:17] is that alive in there or is it full of
[1:19:19] dead men's bones
[1:19:20] now I'm here to tell you there's that if
[1:19:22] you don't have Christ you're going to be
[1:19:24] dead
[1:19:25] because we were all dead in sin and
[1:19:27] trespasses at one time
[1:19:28] we really aren't alive until Christ
[1:19:30] comes in
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:33] in closing
[1:19:35] Paul said in Ephesians 1 and verse 11
[1:19:37] wherefore remember that ye being in
[1:19:39] times past Gentiles in the flesh
[1:19:42] who are called uncircumcisioned by that
[1:19:44] which is called the circumcision in the
[1:19:47] flesh made with hands
[1:19:49] that at that time ye were without
[1:19:51] covenants of the promise having no hope
[1:19:54] and without this word
[1:19:56] no
[1:19:58] so I'll tell you what if you're saved
[1:20:01] tonight you can look back
[1:20:03] you know the time you know the place
[1:20:05] when you were without hope without God
[1:20:07] in this world
[1:20:09] you are far away
[1:20:12] act from God
[1:20:13] we were Gentiles that the public God
[1:20:15] said we were clubs on our back
[1:20:18] but who loves you got a caveman and huh
[1:20:22] worshiping idols
[1:20:25] huh
[1:20:27] but notice without hope without God in
[1:20:29] this world but now in Jesus Christ he
[1:20:32] who were sometimes found oh
[1:20:35] our midnight
[1:20:39] by the blood of Christ
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] that's right so close yet so far and so
[1:20:47] far yet
[1:20:49] so
[1:20:51] close
[1:20:53] I would yeah I would rather be so far
[1:20:57] and yet so close then I would be so
[1:21:00] close
[1:21:01] and yet so far
[1:21:06] they were close and now they're far
[1:21:10] far away
[1:21:14] amen
[1:21:16] I'm
[1:21:17] May believes you need to
[1:21:19] listen to that still small voice
[1:21:22] God wants to talk to you he wants to
[1:21:24] fellowship with you
[1:21:26] he wants to steal
[1:21:29] I've noticed his church here which is
[1:21:31] kind of a little bit maybe we're
[1:21:32] discouraged what it never did so
[1:21:34] we get that way
[1:21:37] but let me tell you encourage you
[1:21:38] tonight
[1:21:39] start stepping with him a little more
[1:21:42] have that personal relationship
[1:21:44] s
[1:21:50] a talk back with
[1:21:52] you may not have a tree to run her car
[1:21:54] whatever it is it don't matter when you
[1:21:57] get that Joy Bell's ringing folks when I
[1:21:59] begin the Lord begin the show
[1:22:02] one boy that nine words that he said he
[1:22:05] didn't go to hell he went to her death
[1:22:07] bed on his deathbed so to speak
[1:22:10] amen he was God's child and then Jesus
[1:22:14] said today you'll be with me and with me
[1:22:16] I like that in Paradise
[1:22:18] stand with me
[1:22:20] musicians who come
[1:22:27] Noah's day no doubt when the rains came
[1:22:30] they came knocking at the door don't you
[1:22:31] think
[1:22:34] they were just aboard away
[1:22:37] just aboard away
[1:22:39] I ever think that thing was
[1:22:42] isn't that right
[1:22:43] but they had turned it down too many
[1:22:46] times
[1:22:49] and the doors to get in
[1:22:52] but what this heart for me
[1:22:54] amen there will be weeping and wailing
[1:22:57] from that door
[1:23:00] let God show you where you still lack
[1:23:05] how many please God do what God does
[1:23:08] yep I truly believe that's what God does
[1:23:10] we were talking about multiplication
