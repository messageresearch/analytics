[11:36] you brother brother
[11:56] Brian if you turn with with me to uh
[12:00] First Kings the 8th
[12:17] chapter know I was uh sitting in my
[12:20] study this morning and I was just
[12:25] thinking with with everything that goes
[12:28] on in the world and everything that we
[12:32] see with in the world you're seeing out
[12:36] there in a natural sense what happens
[12:38] when there's a lack of true leadership
[12:41] whether it's governmental
[12:43] leadership whether it's Church
[12:45] leadership what you see out there in the
[12:47] world going on this morning is what
[12:49] happens when there isn't real leadership
[12:52] in the world and it's no different in
[12:54] the Church of God there isn't real God
[12:57] inspired leadership the world world is
[12:59] you'll be in chaos and the world is in
[13:01] chaos this morning but I was just
[13:03] thinking uh if you starting about the
[13:07] about the 30th verse here this is where
[13:10] uh Solomon is dedicating the temple and
[13:13] they hadn't had an experience with the
[13:15] Lord in hundreds of years they hadn't
[13:18] had an experience like this with the
[13:19] Lord since the time of the Tabernacle in
[13:22] the wildness with Moses when the actual
[13:25] spirit of God came down and blessed the
[13:27] temple where the people couldn't even
[13:29] Minister but this is the scriptures that
[13:33] Solomon gave to the children of Israel
[13:35] and these scriptures have changed this
[13:37] word of God is just as effective today
[13:39] for the people in Israel this morning as
[13:42] it was for them 4,000 years ago but I'll
[13:45] just read this is what Solomon had to
[13:47] say and he this is been inspired through
[13:51] Solomon he says and he goes on to say
[13:54] here I said about the 30th verse you
[13:56] know me I have a tendency to read too
[13:58] much but then it's not my word it's
[14:00] God's word hearken thou to the
[14:02] supplication of thy servant and of thy
[14:04] People Israel when they shall pray
[14:06] toward this place and hear thou in
[14:08] heaven Dwelling Place when thou hearest
[14:12] forgive so he's telling the children of
[14:14] Israel when they're in times of great
[14:16] distress great problems in their Liv
[14:19] they to look toward the temple to God's
[14:21] temple in a physical sense and pray and
[14:24] believe to God for deliverance it's the
[14:26] same today if if
[14:29] they would do what all the children of
[14:31] Israel did for thousands and thousands
[14:33] of years God will give them Deliverance
[14:35] to hearken thou to the supplications of
[14:38] thy servant and to the people of Israel
[14:40] when they shall pray to other place and
[14:42] hear thou in heaven thy Dwelling Places
[14:44] when thou hearest forgive and if any man
[14:46] trespassed against his neighbor and an
[14:48] oath be laid upon him to cause him to
[14:50] swear oath come before thine alter in
[14:53] this house then here in heaven and do
[14:55] and judge the servants condemning the
[14:58] wicked bring bring his way upon his head
[15:00] justify and righteous to give him
[15:02] according to the righteous and and he
[15:04] goes on I'm not going to read the and he
[15:06] goes but this thir third verse speaks to
[15:09] today when the people of Israel be SP
[15:11] down before the
[15:13] enemy because they have sinned against
[15:15] thee and shall turn again to thee and
[15:17] confess thy name and pray and make
[15:20] supplication unto thee in this house
[15:22] then hear thou in heaven and forgive the
[15:24] sin of thy People Israel and bring them
[15:27] again onto the land which thou gavest
[15:29] them onto their
[15:31] fathers I'm not I I have to catch myself
[15:34] I wind up reading the whole whole thing
[15:36] and I was just thinking this
[15:41] morning without without
[15:45] faith there there's no hope for us this
[15:48] morning without faith in Jesus Christ I
[15:50] mean
[15:51] there's there's nothing you can count on
[15:54] out there in the world there's nothing
[15:56] really you can hold on to the only thing
[15:58] you can hold on to his faith in Jesus
[16:00] Christ this morning and as you know I
[16:03] know I say this a lot I I don't mean to
[16:05] say this a lot but in the world that we
[16:07] live in this morning if you're trusting
[16:09] in anything out there in that world this
[16:11] morning then you're going to be a
[16:12] miserable person on that day but what it
[16:15] does for me is I realize allows me to
[16:18] examine myself and to realize
[16:23] that we might just have I know we've
[16:26] anyone my age or younger or older has
[16:29] heard it for 40 50 60 70 80 years you
[16:33] know that he's he'll be here tomorrow
[16:35] he'll be here the next day and we live
[16:38] each day knowing that he'll be here
[16:40] tomorrow and be here the next day but
[16:43] what that quote saying this morning
[16:45] brother bram's quote about how the
[16:48] church in his day had seen so many great
[16:50] Miracles and seen so much of what God
[16:52] had done in their lives that they were
[16:54] getting complacent even in front of all
[16:56] the Miracles they were Bec in complacent
[17:00] and that's where we don't want to be
[17:01] this morning and I I'll just read this
[17:03] chapter in John um the Epistle of John
[17:07] the first Epistle of John the thir
[17:10] chapter and also the devotional this
[17:13] morning uh that if that old devotional
[17:16] well it's not old one that's been we've
[17:18] had for years it also goes back to
[17:20] Philippians chapter 4 but I'll just read
[17:22] what brother John had to say this
[17:24] morning behold what manner of love the
[17:27] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[17:30] should be called the sons of God
[17:33] therefore the world knoweth us not
[17:34] because it knew him not and that's the
[17:36] same thing out there in the world this
[17:38] morning they don't they don't know the
[17:40] Lord but you do know the Lord and the
[17:43] only thing way they're going to see the
[17:45] Lord is through your life this morning
[17:47] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[17:50] doth not yet appear that we shall be
[17:53] what we know what when we shall appear
[17:55] we shall be like him for he shall see
[17:58] him as as he is and that's everyone's
[18:00] hope this morning goes on to say and
[18:02] every man that hath this hope and him
[18:05] purify himself even as he is pure so
[18:08] that's what each of us is doing this
[18:10] morning that's why we're here this
[18:12] morning that God could look into our
[18:14] hearts look into our lives this morning
[18:16] and make not you can't make yourself
[18:19] better but he's going to make you better
[18:21] this morning I hope
[18:23] I lose my place here and whosoever
[18:27] committed in Trust transgresses also the
[18:30] Lord for the sin is the transgression of
[18:32] the Lord and you know that he was
[18:34] manifest to take away our sins and in
[18:37] him is no sin whosoever abideth in him
[18:40] sinth not and whosoever sinth hath not
[18:43] seen him neither know him so I I can
[18:47] only speak for myself but if you find
[18:49] yourself this
[18:51] morning after reading this six verse
[18:55] doing things that you know are contrary
[18:56] to the word of God and you have to apply
[19:00] myself including have to apply this
[19:02] scripture to myself this morning goes on
[19:06] to say let oh children let no man
[19:09] deceive you he that do righteousness is
[19:12] righteous even as sth from the
[19:14] G for this purpose the Son of God was
[19:18] manifested that he
[19:21] might destroy the works of the devil and
[19:25] whosoever is born of God that not commit
[19:27] sin for his seed remaineth in him and
[19:29] that's my hope this morning he cannot
[19:31] sin because he's born of
[19:33] God and this children of God are
[19:35] manifested in the children of the devil
[19:37] who whosoever do not righteous this is
[19:40] not of God neither he that loveth not
[19:43] his brother so Paul um excuse me John is
[19:46] telling us here as we examine ourselves
[19:49] through these scriptures I'm reading
[19:50] this morning every individual here this
[19:53] morning knows where you're
[19:56] at and
[20:02] that's other and I don't have a lot to
[20:05] say this morning but I was just thinking
[20:06] this morning you know we live in I'm not
[20:09] saying that there isn't problems where
[20:12] we live you know in
[20:13] this
[20:15] whe it's Todd County or Christian County
[20:19] sometimes As
[20:21] Americans we don't realize how life can
[20:24] change so fast and so quickly where you
[20:26] can go from a a minute of being in a
[20:30] peaceful
[20:31] environment from being in an environment
[20:34] where everything around you was fall
[20:37] falling apart we that's what that quote
[20:40] talks about it happens in the church not
[20:44] receiving fresh
[20:45] Revelation from the word of God you're
[20:47] not staying with the word of God that
[20:50] you get so restful so that you're not
[20:53] striving to do better each day and what
[20:57] I was thinking this morning
[20:58] we have no hope in this world this
[21:00] morning as you what's going on in Israel
[21:02] this morning what's going on in Ukraine
[21:04] what's going on all over the world us As
[21:07] Americans we're no better than anyone
[21:09] else in the
[21:11] world doesn't mean that it couldn't
[21:13] happen to you tomorrow so what I'm
[21:15] trying to say this morning outside of
[21:18] your relationship with Jesus Christ this
[21:20] morning what's really important this
[21:21] morning maybe I'm not saying that your
[21:24] family isn't important to you but the
[21:26] most important thing for every
[21:27] individual here this morning and for
[21:29] myself is not to become complacent in
[21:31] the age that we're living this morning
[21:33] that you have to strive in faith to be
[21:36] close to the Lord every morning because
[21:38] you know you could wake up tomorrow and
[21:40] the United States could be in Revolution
[21:42] too and then what are you going to be
[21:44] trust in you going to be trust in your
[21:45] government you're going to be trusted in
[21:47] your state who are you going to be
[21:48] trusting in well we all know our only
[21:51] trust is in Jesus Christ this morning so
[21:54] what I'm trying to say is as
[21:59] long in this 21st century I'm I realize
[22:03] that there's no hope in the in the world
[22:06] that we live in and I sometimes As
[22:10] Americans we have a false sense of
[22:12] security this morning what you see going
[22:14] on in the world could happen here
[22:15] tomorrow too so you have to live each
[22:19] day I know it's
[22:20] hard some people that all they've ever
[22:23] known is the you know most Americans all
[22:27] they ever know is little town or maybe
[22:29] the state they lived in and it's hard to
[22:32] for them to Fathom how things can change
[22:34] so quickly but what I'm trying to say
[22:37] this morning no matter what happens if
[22:40] your faith is residing in Jesus Christ
[22:43] this morning the world can fall apart
[22:44] around you to you and your relationship
[22:46] this morning brother
[22:53] David the Lord this morning amen amen
[22:56] let's stand this morning if we could and
[22:59] sing that little chorus I Love You Lord

[49:03] [Music]
[49:05] Saints I probably sung this here before
[49:07] I can't remember we're here so much now
[49:09] but this is a song that I always
[49:12] associate with the Welsh
[49:14] Revival brother BR mentioned that a lot
[49:17] you remember when the Americans went
[49:18] over to Wales to find out about the
[49:20] rails Revival and he talks about the
[49:21] little policemen that they got off the
[49:23] ship the first guy I saw was the
[49:24] policemen and they asked him where's the
[49:26] Welsh Revival and he says I am the Welsh
[49:28] Revival you've arrived and brother B
[49:30] would quote that so often but the Welsh
[49:33] Revival this song's tied to me because
[49:36] history started in 1904 at a little uh
[49:39] young people's meeting is where that
[49:41] Revival broke out and there was a young
[49:43] lady there named Annie Evans and this
[49:47] was 1904 but it was just a testimony
[49:49] meeting with young people and she stood
[49:51] up and said I just want to say that I
[49:53] love the Lord Jesus with all my heart
[49:55] and that was said with such conviction
[49:59] she was a new convert that that's what
[50:01] spawned that great Revival just a little
[50:04] single girl there in Wales my Jesus I
[50:08] love these always tie these together my
[50:12] Jesus I
[50:15] love thee I

[1:05:01] happening ain't that right seeing all
[1:05:03] these things that's happening knowing
[1:05:05] you know that is all coming to an abrupt
[1:05:07] end father what what would you do if you
[1:05:09] wasn't the Christian then he also makes
[1:05:11] a statement he says I don't see any
[1:05:13] reason why anybody wouldn't want to be a
[1:05:15] Christian amen why would a person not
[1:05:18] want to be a Christian amen and so we
[1:05:20] want to talk about what how blessed we
[1:05:22] are just to be a Christian amen I
[1:05:25] believe that when you are a Christian
[1:05:27] you are the most blessed person upon the
[1:05:30] face of the Earth you're more blessed
[1:05:32] than the siks the James the Muhammad
[1:05:35] Buddha any other religion in the world
[1:05:37] they're not even close to compared to as
[1:05:40] blessed is what you are if you're a
[1:05:42] Christian amen so hallelujah amen I've
[1:05:46] been a Christian since I was 20 years
[1:05:48] old I'm about 62 now and I'm very happy
[1:05:51] to be a Christian I'm glad that I have
[1:05:53] been a Christian most of my life amen
[1:05:56] except for the first 20 year 18 years
[1:05:59] amen that was a big waste of time amen
[1:06:02] the only time worth anything is the time
[1:06:03] that you get to spend with God Amen so
[1:06:06] God bless you this morning we just want
[1:06:08] to take our time amen we want to take it
[1:06:11] slow and easy I wrote down here slow and
[1:06:16] easy you know the thought that came with
[1:06:18] slow and easy was brother bam said that
[1:06:20] Jesus was never in a hurry so let's take
[1:06:23] it slow and easy and not be in hurry
[1:06:25] about this amen and we get more amen
[1:06:28] amen don't let's not eat like I do at
[1:06:31] home gobble it up a that right take it
[1:06:34] slow Savor the flavor amen praise the
[1:06:37] Lord God bless you this morning it's
[1:06:39] good to be a Christian this morning amen
[1:06:41] and I don't know uh you know we could
[1:06:43] take a month of sermons or more than
[1:06:45] this Amen on this but amen we'll just go
[1:06:49] as long as we possibly can enjoying what
[1:06:51] God has given is that right and we want
[1:06:54] to turn our Bibles right back to the
[1:06:55] same chapter or and the same verse
[1:06:57] pretty much am mean where we started off
[1:07:00] with and that's Genesis 1 amen amen how
[1:07:03] many knows the word of God is eternal
[1:07:06] Amen brother B says man you can just
[1:07:07] take one scripture I guess I believe he
[1:07:10] said it if I remember one talking about
[1:07:12] you can take one scripture on it for for
[1:07:15] many many many years amen and I think
[1:07:18] this is just an example uh of that we're
[1:07:20] going to take just the first five verses
[1:07:23] this morning in the beginning God
[1:07:25] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:07:28] the Earth was without form and void and
[1:07:31] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:07:34] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:07:36] face of the waters and God said let
[1:07:38] there be light and there was light and
[1:07:41] God saw the light that it was good and
[1:07:44] God divided the light from the darkness
[1:07:47] and God called the light day and the
[1:07:51] Darkness he called night amen and in the
[1:07:54] evening and in the morning were the
[1:07:56] first day may God add blessings to his
[1:07:59] reading of the words you can be seated
[1:08:00] you know I was back there studying just
[1:08:02] before I came out amen and I thought you
[1:08:05] know uh there where God said you know
[1:08:08] and God called the light day amen how
[1:08:12] many believes that we're of the
[1:08:14] light if we are of the light then we are
[1:08:18] day people right we're day people not
[1:08:22] night people
[1:08:24] and then I got to thinking of a
[1:08:26] scripture God just kind of quickened the
[1:08:28] scripture to me amen and that was found
[1:08:31] over in U way over in the book of
[1:08:36] Thessalonians SE uh Thessalonians and
[1:08:39] I'll just read this what Paul said here
[1:08:42] he says now you know we're day people
[1:08:44] not night people in verse chapter 5
[1:08:47] verse 5 he says ye are all the children
[1:08:51] of light amen and the children of the
[1:08:56] day amen isn't that something how God
[1:08:59] will just use and and speak amen how to
[1:09:02] we're typed here as being day people and
[1:09:05] uh day people of the day and not of not
[1:09:07] we are not of the night nor of Darkness
[1:09:11] amen therefore let us not sleep as do
[1:09:15] others but let us watch and be sober for
[1:09:19] they that sleep sleep in the
[1:09:22] night how many beli the world out there
[1:09:24] is
[1:09:25] sleeping they're fast asleep how many
[1:09:28] knows when the
[1:09:30] bridegroom came amen there was a shout
[1:09:33] that went up get up and midnight out
[1:09:35] wake up how many believes it's time for
[1:09:38] the world to wake up amen especially the
[1:09:42] Christian to wake up realize where we're
[1:09:44] at amen sleeping and uh notice therefore
[1:09:48] let us not sleep as do others but let us
[1:09:51] watch and be sober for they that sleep
[1:09:52] sleep in the night and they that are
[1:09:54] drunken are drunken in the night I
[1:09:57] believe a prophet even said you know
[1:09:58] roaches and all of these bugs and even
[1:10:00] Jesus mentioned that you know how that
[1:10:02] you know we're not of the darkness we're
[1:10:04] not creatures of the darkness you know
[1:10:06] and he's at the nightclubs and all of
[1:10:09] that I believe he said one place he see
[1:10:10] know people that think they're alive and
[1:10:12] living and they go out at night and say
[1:10:15] boy this is the life no that's not life
[1:10:18] that's the night life is death is that
[1:10:20] right so now he says but let us who are
[1:10:26] of the day amen how many believes we're
[1:10:28] of the
[1:10:30] day amen be sober putting on the
[1:10:33] breastplate of faith and love and for an
[1:10:37] helmet the hope of salvation for God has
[1:10:40] not appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:10:42] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:10:46] died for
[1:10:47] us that whether we sleep or whether we
[1:10:50] are awake or sleep we should live
[1:10:52] together with him wherefore Comfort
[1:10:53] yourselves together and edify one
[1:10:56] another even as also ye do amen praise
[1:11:03] the Lord another scripture amen is found
[1:11:06] in
[1:11:08] Ephesians and I want to just go talking
[1:11:12] about how that read another scripture
[1:11:14] and came in talk
[1:11:15] about how that we are a new creation God
[1:11:19] created the heavens and the Earth amen
[1:11:21] and then we know that through Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ in the New Testament amen Christ
[1:11:26] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:11:29] isin't that right amen we're part of
[1:11:31] that new
[1:11:32] creation how many believes that you're a
[1:11:35] new creature in Christ amen all things
[1:11:37] have passed away behold all things have
[1:11:40] become new now notice in
[1:11:43] Ephesians
[1:11:45] Darkness but now are ye light in the
[1:11:48] Lord walk as children of
[1:11:51] light amen
[1:11:54] for the fruit of the spirit in all
[1:11:56] goodness and righteousness and Truth
[1:11:58] proving what is acceptable in the Lord
[1:12:01] and have no fellowship with the
[1:12:02] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:12:05] reprove them for it is a shame to even
[1:12:07] speak of those things which are done of
[1:12:09] them in
[1:12:11] secret amen so Paul says there's some
[1:12:15] things that you don't shouldn't even
[1:12:16] talk about don't even mention it it's so
[1:12:19] terrible it's so filthy you don't even
[1:12:21] want to think about it you don't want to
[1:12:23] hear it amen oh on he says but all
[1:12:28] things that are approved are made
[1:12:29] manifest by the light for whatsoever
[1:12:32] doth make manifest is light amen amen
[1:12:36] how many know Jesus said he said they
[1:12:38] don't want their Works made manifest
[1:12:40] because they're of Darkness they hate
[1:12:42] truth because truth sheds light on
[1:12:45] Darkness if you come to church you're in
[1:12:48] the wrong place if you like to hide
[1:12:51] sin if you like to do evil and so far
[1:12:54] they in the wrong place because that
[1:12:55] this is where those things are made ma
[1:12:57] manifest amen this is where we want amen
[1:13:01] but he talks about he that is of the
[1:13:03] light light loves the light because so
[1:13:04] that his deeds might be made manifest
[1:13:06] that they're righteous amen so now
[1:13:09] notice here all right now whatever doth
[1:13:13] make manifest is light wherefore he
[1:13:15] saith awake thou that sleepest I didn't
[1:13:19] even realize these two went together
[1:13:21] that well but it says awake thou that
[1:13:23] sleepest and
[1:13:25] arise from the dead amen and Christ
[1:13:30] shall give thee
[1:13:31] light amen what I want to speak on I
[1:13:34] really want to talk about amen about
[1:13:36] three different things amen this morning
[1:13:37] with the help of the Lord amen one of
[1:13:40] them is going to be amen what it means
[1:13:43] to have that experience on the backside
[1:13:46] of the desert amen and then the other
[1:13:49] one I want to talk about being not
[1:13:50] dismayed amen and I want to talk about
[1:13:52] the an of the Soul amen talking about a
[1:13:56] Christian amen and we realize and I talk
[1:13:59] Wednesday we talk about how how and now
[1:14:03] just noce listen to
[1:14:07] this he says no
[1:14:11] man has a right to preach the gospel
[1:14:15] amen no person has a right to call
[1:14:17] themselves a Christian until they can go
[1:14:20] back to that certain place in their life
[1:14:22] where come on that sacred Sands at the
[1:14:25] backside of the
[1:14:28] desert amen the backside of the desert
[1:14:30] and I thought well now you know we
[1:14:32] realize that's figuratively speaking
[1:14:35] unless of course you live in
[1:14:37] Arizona amen and you actually have a
[1:14:39] literal backside of the desert
[1:14:41] experience out there and you meet God on
[1:14:43] the back side of the desert because we
[1:14:45] know Moses was on the backside of the
[1:14:47] desert and that's where he got his
[1:14:50] experience with
[1:14:52] God amen but you know you know and he
[1:14:56] talks about how that and I want to I
[1:14:57] want to try
[1:14:59] to just follow the leading of the spirit
[1:15:02] because we want to talk first about am
[1:15:03] me talking about what it really mean to
[1:15:06] have that experience on the back side of
[1:15:09] the desert because it in uh uh uh it
[1:15:13] encumbers I guess it would say encumbers
[1:15:16] so much there is so
[1:15:20] much involves amen
[1:15:24] all right knows that he has met God
[1:15:29] I you to get this sacred Sands at the
[1:15:33] backside of the desert when he meets God
[1:15:36] face to
[1:15:38] face amen there's not enough devils in
[1:15:42] hell that can take that ever take that
[1:15:44] away from
[1:15:46] him then Wednesday night we got to
[1:15:49] talking about how that he makes a
[1:15:51] statement when brother B preach
[1:15:53] possessing all things amen and he talked
[1:15:55] about all the gates that the Seed of
[1:15:58] Abraham shall possess the gates of the
[1:16:00] enemy and it tells it's actually a
[1:16:02] promise of God thy seed shall possess
[1:16:05] the gates of the enemy amen he says now
[1:16:08] no listen if you really are a Christian
[1:16:10] there's not enough devils in Hell Amen
[1:16:13] to keep you from possessing every gate
[1:16:17] of the
[1:16:19] enemy glory and let me tell you
[1:16:21] something as I talk about how that you
[1:16:23] you talking there's a lot of devils out
[1:16:25] there there's not enough reinforcements
[1:16:28] in hell to stop a real
[1:16:30] Christian there wasn't enough chariots
[1:16:33] in Egypt to stop Pharaoh from getting
[1:16:36] those people delivered was there amen it
[1:16:38] didn't matter if he was a
[1:16:41] superpower praise be to God why because
[1:16:43] he had a real experience with almighty
[1:16:46] God and that's what it takes a born
[1:16:49] again experience how many knows that's
[1:16:50] what that means amen having an
[1:16:52] experience with with God on the back
[1:16:53] side of the desert it means that you
[1:16:56] have met
[1:16:58] God and not only met God because we know
[1:17:01] that uh uh you know you know that every
[1:17:03] time you come to church amen you either
[1:17:05] you go you leave a different
[1:17:08] person everybody that come to church
[1:17:10] goes out those doors a different person
[1:17:13] it's either better or it's
[1:17:16] worse amen and when you come in contact
[1:17:19] with almighty God something happens oh
[1:17:23] he touched me he touched me and oh my
[1:17:26] something happened and now I know he
[1:17:29] touched me amen and he made me
[1:17:33] whole oh my you know can meet God you
[1:17:37] can meet
[1:17:39] God Amen and go away a lot worse
[1:17:45] person not always a better person Young
[1:17:48] Ruler he was not the same after he met
[1:17:50] him he was never the
[1:17:55] same
[1:17:59] amen Cain was never theice he was never
[1:18:02] the same you'll never be the same when
[1:18:04] you hear hear the truth folks oh
[1:18:08] my how many knows we as human beings
[1:18:11] young people you know might think you're
[1:18:12] just going to have a good time you're
[1:18:14] going to live like this after the other
[1:18:16] I'm free from God I don't have to do not
[1:18:18] you know you know you will answer you're
[1:18:20] accountable for every action that you
[1:18:22] ever make and you will give an account
[1:18:25] for it
[1:18:26] someday the difference between a
[1:18:28] Christian and a non-believer amen that
[1:18:30] are our sins go up to him beforeand unto
[1:18:35] judgment aren't you glad to judge amen
[1:18:38] and to get put in the sea of God's
[1:18:40] forgetfulness they drop in the blood
[1:18:42] bleach of Jesus Christ never to be
[1:18:44] remembered no
[1:18:46] more what does inumber to mean On The
[1:18:49] Backs side of the desert it means so
[1:18:51] much oh my it means that you found the
[1:18:54] pearl of P pice it means that you have
[1:18:56] come you have forsaken everything like
[1:18:59] Jesus said amen to go and follow
[1:19:05] him all right let's just start on
[1:19:08] that amen praise be to God when you meet
[1:19:13] God when God commissions you when God
[1:19:15] does something for you you'll never be
[1:19:17] the
[1:19:18] same
[1:19:20] amen and you know how many knows that
[1:19:22] there's a lot of people that try to get
[1:19:23] the Holy Ghost try to get
[1:19:26] saved try try try try there's a lot of
[1:19:29] people that try try try try and it's
[1:19:32] very
[1:19:33] hard sometimes it's very
[1:19:35] hard sometimes it's very
[1:19:39] difficult but Ephesians
[1:19:41] 1 and verse uh let me see here I think
[1:19:46] I've got it wrote
[1:19:47] down right here one and six it says to
[1:19:53] the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:19:56] wherein he ha made us
[1:19:59] accepted in the
[1:20:03] Beloved how many believes that God has
[1:20:05] to accept you when you come to God when
[1:20:09] you meet him on want to meet him on the
[1:20:11] back side of the desert you have to get
[1:20:14] accepted just like man if you buying a
[1:20:16] house so forth go to the bank you know
[1:20:20] the bank says you've been accepted
[1:20:23] you've been accepted how happy you are
[1:20:25] you know because you've been accepted or
[1:20:27] you've been rejected you've been
[1:20:37] denied amen when when a Christian or a
[1:20:40] sinner comes going to reject him amen
[1:20:43] didn't the prophet of God say that when
[1:20:45] a person comes to Christ and he
[1:20:47] genuinely has faith in almighty God Amen
[1:20:50] and that faith is genuine in his
[1:20:52] sacrifice is exactly the way that it's
[1:20:54] supposed to
[1:20:56] be what is a perfect sacrifice a perfect
[1:20:59] sacrifice is when you meet God's demands
[1:21:01] amen that you're willing to forsake all
[1:21:03] to follow him you don't you you love him
[1:21:06] above father mother brother sister
[1:21:07] anybody else he that that doesn't even
[1:21:10] he you got to forsake your own
[1:21:13] life to follow him and if that sacrifice
[1:21:17] is right God will accept it and he'll
[1:21:19] consume
[1:21:21] it W think about it and says you know
[1:21:26] he's obligated to give you the baptism
[1:21:28] of the Holy Ghost right there and then
[1:21:31] you ain't got to ter all
[1:21:34] night when God accepts that sacrifice
[1:21:36] that repentance that's what it means on
[1:21:39] the back side of the desert it means
[1:21:42] that you've got to come by the way of
[1:21:44] Acts 238
[1:21:51] SS
[1:21:53] don't it when he accepts it he consumes
[1:21:58] it he consumes that
[1:22:03] sacrifice he forgives you of all your
[1:22:10] past and then you can say you ask me why
[1:22:13] I'll be happy in a trillion years from
[1:22:16] now I'll say because my sins are
[1:22:20] gone there underneath the
[1:22:24] blood it happened at the cross of
[1:22:27] Calvary now there's far remov just
[1:22:30] darkness is from
[1:22:31] dawn oh aren't you
[1:22:33] glad folks I'm here to tell you we ought
[1:22:36] to be we got to be the happiest a
[1:22:39] Christian is the happiest human being at
[1:22:45] Walmart cuz there ain't very many happy
[1:22:49] there the happiest people everywhere
[1:22:51] whever you are you're the happiest
[1:22:53] person we should be the happiest people
[1:22:56] to know that you haveed from death life
[1:22:59] that's what it
[1:23:03] means
[1:23:05] my it means that
[1:23:07] you have come God's way if any man will
[1:23:11] come after me let him deny himself and
[1:23:13] take up his cross and follow me how many
[1:23:16] believe you have met those demands if
[1:23:18] you really met him the reason people
[1:23:21] don't really meet him is there're some
[1:23:22] clitch there's some cat
[1:23:25] somewhere
[1:23:27] huh not quite dead to self anymore still
[1:23:30] not quite dead because God will baptize
[1:23:33] you with the Holy Ghost if that
[1:23:34] sacrifice is Right
[1:23:37] amen take up the cross and follow me for
[1:23:40] whosoever will save his life shall lose
[1:23:42] it and whosoever will lose his life for
[1:23:44] my sake shall find it for what is it pro
[1:23:48] if a man shall gain the whole world Amen
[1:23:51] and lose his own soul
[1:23:53] or why would a give a man exchange under
[1:23:54] of his soul I mean every how many knows
[1:23:56] when you come to God you see God I want
[1:23:58] to give you my everything I want to give
[1:24:00] you my
[1:24:02] life doesn't matter what my brother my
[1:24:05] pastor my mom my dad doesn't matter who
[1:24:09] you disconnect like Abraham did from all
[1:24:11] friends and
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:15] family how many knows our our family is
[1:24:17] the closest thing to us that's
[1:24:20] right that's what he said if you me more
[1:24:22] than you love your very best thing that
[1:24:24] you'll ever love you're not worthy of me
[1:24:27] how many believes that you got to be
[1:24:29] worthy when you come to Christ it's got
[1:24:31] to be a worthy place you got to be
[1:24:33] worthy worthy of the
[1:24:37] acceptation Paul said let us walk worthy
[1:24:40] of vocation wherewith we are called
[1:24:42] let's walk as Christians because there's

[1:26:20] God all right so that's right many
[1:26:25] things Jesus said is that
[1:26:27] right um I'm not
[1:26:32] sure there's another one in
[1:26:38] John in John Jesus said in five and
[1:26:42] verse
[1:26:43] 24 he says verily verily I say unto you
[1:26:46] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:26:48] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[1:26:50] life and not come into the judgment
[1:26:53] condemnation but has passed from Death
[1:26:57] unto
[1:27:00] life that's when you really come to life
[1:27:04] we were dead
[1:27:06] before
[1:27:09] dead what did Peter say we're Lively
[1:27:13] Stones don't don't don't don't you feel
[1:27:15] like the devil just like to Swindle you
[1:27:17] down and just keep you kind of dead and
[1:27:21] just depressed and he loves to try to
[1:27:24] depress you
[1:27:25] and put fear and depression on you and
[1:27:28] everything else and but Jesus says we're
[1:27:31] Lively Stones we're alive in Christ not
[1:27:34] dead we're in
[1:27:37] heav Heavenly places not hellish places
[1:27:41] we was in hellish places before now
[1:27:43] we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:27:48] there's just so much that happens on
[1:27:51] that backside of the
[1:27:53] desert amen praise be to God and I love
[1:27:58] him for it don't
[1:28:00] you
[1:28:03] amen Paul said in Ephesians 2 you have
[1:28:07] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:28:09] and sins amen where in times past you
[1:28:13] walked according to the course of this
[1:28:14] world according to the prince of the
[1:28:16] power of the air the spirit of them that
[1:28:18] now not now worketh in the children of
[1:28:22] of
[1:28:24] Disobedience amen so we're once dead now
[1:28:27] we're alive we were in darkness we were
[1:28:31] children of the darkness but now we're
[1:28:32] Children of the
[1:28:34] day I was telling my wife I'm on the way
[1:28:36] to on the way to church here and then I
[1:28:38] got another Revelation that whenever God
[1:28:40] accepts you whenever he accepts you he
[1:28:43] pays the
[1:28:46] price he pays your
[1:28:49] Ransom amen and I think about a week or
[1:28:52] two ago I was preaching on he is our the
[1:28:55] one that has ransomed us amen and I
[1:28:58] talked about he maybe I I kind of
[1:28:59] dramatized it as him going to the devil
[1:29:01] and breaking down his door and going in
[1:29:04] there and grabbing us out of there but
[1:29:06] that's not really the way it
[1:29:10] is that's not really the way it
[1:29:13] is because you know if he paid the
[1:29:15] ransome that means he didn't just come
[1:29:17] and rescue you he didn't just you know
[1:29:20] but he had to pay the price
[1:29:22] in other words devil had a right to hold
[1:29:25] you and the God didn't come in there and
[1:29:28] grab you the devil had a ride on
[1:29:32] you and unless he got that slip unless
[1:29:36] he paid the price you would go
[1:29:40] nowhere but when he paid the price on
[1:29:43] Calvary he paid my Ransom and he sent me
[1:29:47] free he is mind that that's what Calvary
[1:29:50] did how many that that's what happens on
[1:29:54] the back side of the desert when God
[1:29:56] takes you out of the devil's pawn shop
[1:30:00] he oh
[1:30:05] my
[1:30:06] amen my God is good isn't
[1:30:10] he God is
[1:30:12] good
[1:30:14] amen now back to Genesis for a
[1:30:18] minute let's look at verse one again in
[1:30:21] the beginning
[1:30:23] God
[1:30:24] created the
[1:30:26] heavens and the Earth didn't he he
[1:30:30] created the
[1:30:32] heavens and the Earth praise the
[1:30:38] Lord and
[1:30:40] now in Ephesians 2 and verse
[1:30:44] 10 it says that we are his
[1:30:48] workmanship
[1:30:50] created
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:55] cre I'm saved you he was doing the work
[1:30:59] he
[1:31:00] was when he paid that price amen when he
[1:31:03] be took the burden of paying for you and
[1:31:08] and accepting
[1:31:09] you he was creating you we are created
[1:31:14] by
[1:31:16] Jesus
[1:31:18] Christ unto good work which God ha for
[1:31:21] ordained
[1:31:24] that we should walk you know what he's
[1:31:25] building out of
[1:31:27] us he's building a temple for him to
[1:31:30] dwell
[1:31:31] in creating it according to verse 22 he
[1:31:35] says he says now therefore you are no
[1:31:38] more strangers and foreigners but fellow
[1:31:40] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:31:42] household of God and are built upon the
[1:31:44] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets

[1:33:18] what you done and on all of that he says
[1:33:20] it quick

[1:47:04] not about and fum and worry about
[1:47:08] things amen a Christ rest it'ss all
[1:47:12] praise the Lord then he
[1:47:14] tells the story I love to tell that is
[1:47:17] by coming that him coming by Harbor one
[1:47:19] time and he was in the plane he looked
[1:47:21] down there amen and the sails had been
[1:47:22] let down on this on this boat and so
[1:47:24] forth and what a storm was on that sea
[1:47:26] she was tossing and so forth that ship
[1:47:28] was rocking back and forth she had some
[1:47:30] waves that would go in some W would go
[1:47:32] under and everything else and he said oh
[1:47:35] I wonder what it is and the fellow next
[1:47:36] to me said he says he's got a Seeker see
[1:47:38] a sea anchor on it therefore the ship
[1:47:42] cannot
[1:47:44] sink y'all sit tight now think about it
[1:47:49] you're in Christ you can't
[1:47:58] sink you won't
[1:48:01] sink oh why I'll tell you why because I
[1:48:04] don't know I don't care what kind of a
[1:48:06] boat it is amen but I'll tell about out
[1:48:08] there in the ocean amen if there's a
[1:48:10] storm coming am me they let down their
[1:48:11] anchor amen they might get mud it just
[1:48:14] it might get a hold of a tree branch and
[1:48:16] it'll just tear that loose you know but
[1:48:18] it don't need a round rock and all jump
[1:48:21] over Round Rock but it needs to rock
[1:48:23] with a little Cliff amen so that anchor
[1:48:25] can grip and I'm going to tell you right
[1:48:27] now that anchor Amen in that rock that
[1:48:29] we have Amen in the Cliff of the Rock
[1:48:31] Amen we had a we had a slit right in
[1:48:33] there amen and when you go in there and
[1:48:35] you're part of that when he grips that
[1:48:37] what he did amen it'll never let
[1:48:40] go that's what you and I are we are
[1:48:43] anchored in the C Jesus Christ in the
[1:48:45] Clift of The
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:49] Rock
[1:48:51] in my way of thinking we probably have't
[1:48:54] the
[1:48:55] nicest of any Christians of any
[1:48:58] age even Luther had to run for his life
[1:49:01] and watch because they was trying to
[1:49:02] kill
[1:49:05] him is that right Bloody Mary come up
[1:49:09] and killed all those all 300 was it
[1:49:14] ministers and things trying to get rid
[1:49:16] of Christianity and reinstate
[1:49:18] Catholicism or
[1:49:20] and killed they knew what it was like to
[1:49:23] have it rough to have it hard because
[1:49:25] this world is not my home and you're not
[1:49:28] welcome here how many knows we're not
[1:49:30] welcome here and they're going to let
[1:49:32] that us know that after a
[1:49:34] while shut places like this down oh look
[1:49:38] at what they're doing already if they
[1:49:40] can shut the police force down they can
[1:49:42] shut churches
[1:49:44] down
[1:49:46] amen my praise the Lord
[1:49:51] all
[1:49:52] right let's talk about this before we go
[1:49:56] a little further on the anchor let's
[1:49:57] talk
[1:49:58] about not being tossed how many believe
[1:50:01] that we don't we don't want to be tossed
[1:50:03] about in Ephesians 4 he says you know he
[1:50:06] gave the five-fold ministry for the
[1:50:07] perfecting of the Saints and so forth
[1:50:09] till we all come to the unity of the
[1:50:10] faith to the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:50:12] to a perfect man andto the statue of the
[1:50:14] perfect the the fullness of Christ that
[1:50:16] we henceforth be no more children
[1:50:21] tossed to and
[1:50:23] fro brother Bram says
[1:50:26] listen a Christian does isn't is not
[1:50:29] tossed about a Christian doesn't run
[1:50:31] from place
[1:50:32] to a Christian doesn't fuss and fume and
[1:50:36] worry about
[1:50:39] things amen here even Paul was talking
[1:50:43] to Ephesians he says you know a real
[1:50:45] Christian man that Is Anchored In Christ
[1:50:47] I mean you're not tossed to and fro and
[1:50:49] carried about out with every wind of
[1:50:51] Doctrine by the sight of men anden
[1:50:54] you're not easily
[1:50:55] moved
[1:50:57] woo you don't get shook up too quick I
[1:51:01] manyan those make Believers get shook up
[1:51:05] right I'm
[1:51:07] GNA read this and then we'll talk about
[1:51:09] being dismayed all right Jude 1 and
[1:51:15] verse five it says and I will therefore
[1:51:17] put you in remembrance though ye once
[1:51:19] knew it how that
[1:51:20] the Lord having saved the people of the
[1:51:22] out of the land of Egypt afterwards
[1:51:25] destroyed them that believ not now how
[1:51:27] many know they were make
[1:51:30] Believers sure they were all part of
[1:51:32] Israel they were all they all took part
[1:51:34] of the Red
[1:51:36] Sea
[1:51:39] amen they all loved dancing and going
[1:51:43] out of Egypt praising
[1:51:46] God but what happened God begin to work
[1:51:50] on their emotions I mean because your
[1:51:52] emotions need to stay in check your
[1:51:54] feelings have to stay in check we need
[1:51:56] to be there's one thing about it and I
[1:51:58] want to I want to take probably a sermon
[1:51:59] on and talking about the character L Le
[1:52:02] the one thing a Christian has his
[1:52:06] character what he do bring him right
[1:52:09] down to where they would be scared a
[1:52:11] trap called the Red Sea so to how they
[1:52:15] would do emotionally God wants to know
[1:52:17] how you do emotionally amen
[1:52:21] how well you control your emotion but
[1:52:23] they didn't believe let me tell you
[1:52:24] something if you aren't a Believer
[1:52:26] you're not going to do so well cuz this
[1:52:29] world lives by their emotions by their
[1:52:32] feelings why do you think road range is
[1:52:34] so crazy out there because they ain't
[1:52:36] got control
[1:52:37] enough to control
[1:52:40] themselves one thing the Christian does
[1:52:43] is have some
[1:52:44] self-control praise be to God oh my I
[1:52:48] thought
[1:52:51] about that not just
[1:52:55] on I don't know how much of the other
[1:52:57] we'll get but we'll just go as far as we
[1:52:59] can praise the Lord now notice believe
[1:53:02] not even the angels which kept not their
[1:53:05] first estatement left a habitation has
[1:53:07] reserved an everlasting chains under
[1:53:08] darkness of Judgment of the great day
[1:53:10] Sodom and Gomorrah how many knows that's

[1:57:46] tree no fruit Jesus curs it didn't
[1:57:52] he now what you do cut it
[1:57:57] off and then what Israel happened that's
[1:58:00] what happened to Israel none of them
[1:58:02] made it into the promised land Bible

[1:58:21] not tossed like the Angels were not
[1:58:23] tossed like Egypt was is that right not
[1:58:26] Egypt but even Israel how they were
[1:58:28] tossed with their emotions every time
[1:58:30] something come along they'd open their
[1:58:32] mouth run their
[1:58:34] mouth I think as James said he that
[1:58:36] controls his tongue is a perfect man if
[1:58:39] you can control this you've got to have
[1:58:41] something down here you g to have to be
[1:58:42] anchored how many believe that
[1:58:46] amen uh carried about of winds trees
[1:58:51] whose fruit withered without fruit twice
[1:58:54] the plucked up
[1:58:57] by their root their own
[1:59:03] shame wandering stars to whom is
[1:59:06] reserved the Blackness of Darkness
[1:59:13] forever help us Lord
[1:59:16] Jesus amen but preach a m called is your
[1:59:20] life worthy of the Gospel how many wants
[1:59:22] a worthy
[1:59:25] life
[1:59:28] amen did you know that certainly you've
[1:59:30] seen people that you just love to be
[1:59:32] around you don't know why that loving
[1:59:35] type of person my next thought is that a
[1:59:38] real genuine
[1:59:40] Christ has the atmosphere around them
[1:59:44] just as a
[1:59:46] church has an atmosphere about them a
[1:59:49] Christian has an atmosphere about
[1:59:53] them
[1:59:55] amen oh
[1:59:57] my a loving type of person have you seen
[2:00:00] that that's right you like to be around
[2:00:03] them they create that Atmosphere by the
[2:00:05] life they live the way they talk their
[2:00:07] conversation then you've seen those who
[2:00:10] every time you just shun them he says
[2:00:12] all the time they want to talk about
[2:00:14] something evil or talk about
[2:00:18] somebody
[2:00:21] that's right I think every one of us is
[2:00:23] older now we know that when you go to
[2:00:25] talking about now you know brother
[2:00:26] Wallace you know brother
[2:00:29] John you know brother Joshua as soon as
[2:00:32] somebody says somebody's
[2:00:35] name red
[2:00:37] flag soon as somebody talks to says
[2:00:40] something about somebody ears are up is
[2:00:42] it good or is it
[2:00:45] bad
[2:00:47] amen that's right because cuz the devil
[2:00:50] lives there he'll tear families apart
[2:00:53] he'll tear friendships apart Bible even
[2:00:56] talks about a Whisperer and somebody
[2:00:58] that tells tales and somebody else
[2:00:59] separates Chief friends did you know
[2:01:02] what they said about you you

[2:01:09] know you'd be listening to anything good
[2:01:11] they had to say about you and say he
[2:01:13] said this about you that was good that's
[2:01:15] Christian make believer he'll say things
[2:01:17] that's ugly or that's wrong

[2:01:30] they're doing is going to tell some
[2:01:31] dirty joke or some about talk about some
[2:01:33] woman or something like that you just
[2:01:35] hate to get around them see they create
[2:01:38] seemingly pretty nice people but they
[2:01:42] create that atmosphere the things that
[2:01:44] you think on the things that you do the
[2:01:47] actions the things that you talk about
[2:01:49] creates the
[2:01:50] atmosphere is your life worthy of the
