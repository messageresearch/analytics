[19:45] facebook about some clothing items
[19:48] they're in the back sunday school room
[19:52] uh i requested that we just have them
[19:55] back there for a month
[19:57] i figured that'll give y'all sisters
[19:59] time to
[20:00] to go through it they're all just for
[20:02] girls
[20:04] so sorry guys no hunting clothes but uh
[20:08] either way i know uh
[20:12] brother branham said the deacons and
[20:14] stuff are responsible for
[20:16] food and clothing and finances of the
[20:18] church and so when it was
[20:21] mentioned to me about the clothing items
[20:23] i said that'd be
[20:24] fine so they are back there in the back
[20:29] classroom sister jessica's classroom and
[20:32] uh
[20:34] so anybody like to go through them the
[20:36] boxes are marked
[20:37] everything is marked for sizes
[20:40] but brothers just keep
[20:43] in mind it might take your wife
[20:47] a little bit to go through it so give
[20:50] her time
[20:52] we don't want to end up with everything
[20:54] still sitting back there a month from
[20:56] now
[20:57] and somebody says well my husband
[20:59] wouldn't let me
[21:01] take time to go through it so
[21:06] and also for the election all the
[21:09] offices
[21:10] will remain the same
[21:14] i don't know if y'all know how that's
[21:15] handled
[21:17] but after all the ballots are turned in
[21:20] i have been the only one
[21:23] that looks at the ballots counts them
[21:27] and then i put them in a sealed envelope
[21:29] and marked the date on them
[21:31] and they're turned in to brother brian
[21:33] and they're put
[21:34] in a safe place brother thomas nobody
[21:37] else sees them
[21:38] so any questions
[21:42] anything they can be pulled out and you
[21:44] can look at the results but you can just
[21:46] ask me
[21:47] and if you have any questions about them
[21:52] amen and also this morning we're having
[21:55] communion and foot washing the ladies
[21:59] will go to sister grace's classroom
[22:04] instead of sister jessica's for the foot
[22:06] washing

[53:25] it means for me as a pastor it's an
[53:28] honor amen

[53:32] parents
[53:33] to see what you watch your family grow
[53:34] up and serve the lord and watch the

[53:37] mature and and get filled with the holy
[53:39] ghost and
[53:40] amen find a kind of good job and amen
[53:43] it's just a blessing from the lord amen
[53:46] amen so let's just bow our heads this
[53:48] morning kind heavenly father is
[53:51] we want to now open your bible and
[53:53] father ask god that you would just
[53:56] lord say what you once said this morning
[53:58] father come in a special way we know
[53:59] that
[54:00] lord if we would just read the word
[54:02] without the spirit father it would be
[54:04] dead lord
[54:05] but father the holy spirit we just asked
[54:07] to come in a special way and anoint lord
[54:10] the service anoint me lord to minister
[54:13] the word
[54:14] father that lord the ones that are
[54:16] receiving would also father be able to
[54:18] receive it
[54:18] further than just in their mind or in
[54:20] their head but father that it would sink
[54:22] down into their souls lord jesus and we
[54:24] would
[54:25] be drawn closer to you and then into a
[54:27] greater
[54:28] relationship and a greater fellowship
[54:30] with you lord to
[54:32] become more like our father and lord as
[54:35] we remember you this morning
[54:36] as we observe the communion this morning
[54:38] father and do
[54:40] what you have asked us to do father we
[54:42] ask you to bless every portion of the
[54:44] service this morning and each one
[54:46] that has come into your house and each
[54:48] one lord that loves you in the bottom of
[54:50] their heart father
[54:51] he wants to give their all to you lord
[54:53] we just ask god that you
[54:55] bless each and every one lord we just
[54:57] commit ourselves to you now in jesus
[54:59] christ's name
[55:00] amen and amen turn to first corinthians
[55:03] if you will
[55:05] first corinthians
[55:14] we'll go to the 11th chapter we're going
[55:17] to read maybe half of the communion
[55:19] chapter and then
[55:20] maybe the other half
[55:24] amen i believe communion is something
[55:27] that is important to do
[55:28] amen because jesus asked us to do it
[55:32] amen
[55:32] the same as he asked us to baptize that
[55:35] right
[55:36] to wash feet to have baptism and so he
[55:39] commanded them to do that
[55:40] and he also asked us to do this part
[55:43] amen
[55:44] and so i believe that all christians
[55:45] should take
[55:47] the communion to remember the lord all
[55:50] right
[55:51] now in chapter 11 of first corinthians
[55:53] and verse 23 paul says
[55:55] for i have received of the lord that
[55:57] which also i delivered unto you
[56:00] that the lord jesus the same night in
[56:02] which he was betrayed took bread
[56:04] and when he had given thanks he break it
[56:06] and said
[56:07] take eat this is my body which is broken
[56:10] for you
[56:11] this do in remembrance of me after the
[56:14] same manner also he took the cup and
[56:16] when he had stopped saying
[56:18] this cup is the new testament in my
[56:20] blood
[56:21] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[56:24] remembrance
[56:25] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[56:28] and drink this cup you do show the
[56:29] lord's death
[56:31] until he come amen may god add his
[56:34] blessings to the reading of the word you
[56:36] can be seated this morning
[56:39] amen i want to begin with
[56:43] just a couple of different thoughts on
[56:46] this
[56:47] and i want to talk as we think about uh
[56:50] the lord's death and what
[56:53] he's asked us to do in remembrance of me
[56:57] and that we're remembering his death
[56:59] amen but he did for us
[57:01] so i want to speak a little while with
[57:03] the help of the lord
[57:05] on what he did for us amen and then what
[57:08] he told us some of the things that he
[57:10] told us
[57:11] amen and also what he for what he did
[57:14] for you
[57:15] personally amen because somebody knows
[57:17] that if
[57:18] what he did i mean if a person doesn't
[57:21] ever apply that to their life and
[57:23] it never becomes a revelation of what he
[57:26] did for them
[57:27] they never benefit at all
[57:30] and there will be billions of people
[57:31] like that that never really even benefit
[57:34] from what he did amen so if god comes
[57:38] down and he has mercy on you and he has
[57:40] gives you a revelation of what he did
[57:42] if he saves you amen then
[57:45] that is something that is special and i
[57:48] believe that through the eons of time
[57:51] or not time but through the ceaseless
[57:54] eternity i won't see say i won't say
[57:57] through the ceaseless
[57:58] uh you know times to come because it's
[58:02] not going to be
[58:02] time it's going to be eternity amen
[58:05] it'll be the thing that
[58:07] we worship and praise god for and that
[58:10] is for what he does for you
[58:12] on a personal basis because let me tell
[58:14] you some how many knows that not
[58:16] everybody experiences what you have
[58:18] experienced
[58:19] not everybody reaps the benefit of what
[58:22] he did
[58:23] and so as he tells us to remember it's
[58:26] kind of strange isn't actually saying
[58:28] now look i want you to do this and i
[58:29] want you to observe this
[58:31] in remembrance of what i did for you
[58:36] amen now we know that in the old
[58:39] testament ever since the fall
[58:41] in the garden of eden ever since that
[58:43] time you know that they got promised
[58:45] that
[58:46] uh you know that they would be getting
[58:48] messiah the messiah would be coming and
[58:50] he would be a savior and
[58:52] and they always looked forward they were
[58:54] always looking forward now prophet
[58:56] brought us not brought this out
[58:57] and showed us that they were looking
[58:59] forward to the coming of the messiah
[59:01] he they were looking forward to coming
[59:02] and him saving them from their sins and
[59:05] and redeeming him and all of the things
[59:07] that they were gonna do
[59:08] all right but then after calgary after
[59:11] he paid the price and after he
[59:13] died on calvary ever since then amen
[59:16] all you know every every ev ever since
[59:19] that time
[59:20] from the 2000 years ago on everybody
[59:23] always
[59:23] looks back we look back to calvary
[59:27] to what he did for us and that's what we
[59:30] are remembering
[59:31] is we are remembering what he
[59:34] did amen amen both in his life
[59:38] and in his death praise god
[59:41] amen we know that uh you know what he
[59:44] did for us let's first of all look at
[59:45] what he did when he came to the earth
[59:47] and
[59:47] how that we know that jesus christ when
[59:50] he was came to the earth
[59:51] that he came from god in that right he
[59:54] came out from god he came out from the
[59:55] spirit
[59:56] because that which was conceived of mary
[59:58] was that of the holy ghost
[1:00:00] so that little germ that was created in
[1:00:02] the womb of mary was a spoken
[1:00:05] word seed isn't that right it was the
[1:00:07] actual
[1:00:08] manifestation of god in a in a sun
[1:00:11] form because he went from the father to
[1:00:13] the son and then he came down and he
[1:00:15] began to
[1:00:16] amen we know it's coming from god and
[1:00:19] going on he came from
[1:00:20] the majesty so to speak of all of the
[1:00:23] glory of heaven
[1:00:25] god came down and became what for you
[1:00:28] what did he do he became a servant
[1:00:32] i mean he knows that that is what he
[1:00:34] came down and he
[1:00:36] came down and he became a servant he was
[1:00:38] he went from being the richest and the
[1:00:40] greatest
[1:00:41] to becoming the smallest
[1:00:45] all right he became the least
[1:00:48] amen he became the last
[1:00:51] he received the lowest name
[1:00:55] that anybody could give anybody which
[1:00:57] was the chief
[1:00:59] of devils they called him beelzebub
[1:01:03] they called him illegitimate they called
[1:01:07] him a bastard son
[1:01:08] isn't that they called him all kinds of
[1:01:10] dirty names amen he had a dirty name
[1:01:12] on to him amen and he went so low and he
[1:01:16] became such a servant
[1:01:17] he wasn't trying to be great and he
[1:01:19] taught us one of the things he told us
[1:01:21] and taught us
[1:01:22] he said that the last shall be first the
[1:01:25] first and the first shall be last amen
[1:01:27] amen and there are many different things
[1:01:29] that we could go into for all morning
[1:01:30] long
[1:01:31] talking about you know they that are
[1:01:32] last they're going to be first and so
[1:01:34] forth and
[1:01:35] and all the things that you know blessed
[1:01:37] are those that hunger and thirst after
[1:01:38] righteousness and
[1:01:39] blessings are those that are persecuted
[1:01:41] for righteousness sakes
[1:01:43] you know and and those that have not in
[1:01:45] this world they're gonna be
[1:01:47] those that are hungry in this world
[1:01:48] they're gonna be full there and all
[1:01:50] these different things
[1:01:51] but let's focus first of all on the
[1:01:53] servitude of jesus christ
[1:01:55] how god became a servant of all
[1:01:58] and he even said and he even told us
[1:02:01] that if you're going to be a great
[1:02:03] christian if you're going to be like him
[1:02:06] he said let him that is the greatest
[1:02:08] among you
[1:02:09] be the servant of all
[1:02:12] how many knows that that's right let the
[1:02:14] greatest become a servant so
[1:02:16] amen we're looking now at becoming a
[1:02:18] great person but we'll be listening to
[1:02:20] seeing
[1:02:20] about being we don't care about no
[1:02:22] greatness amen we just want to be a
[1:02:24] simple humble christian
[1:02:26] amen loving the lord and
[1:02:29] so that's why in the foot washing part
[1:02:31] if you'll notice
[1:02:33] you know when peter when he came to
[1:02:34] peter amen and peter says thou
[1:02:36] shalt never wash my feet why because
[1:02:39] peter looked at him as you're the master
[1:02:42] you're our lord you're our leader and
[1:02:44] you're not gonna come down
[1:02:45] here and wash my feet i'll wash yours
[1:02:48] i'll be your servant
[1:02:49] but no he says you know if i washed he
[1:02:50] not thou has no part with me
[1:02:55] amen and but he says you know in peter's
[1:02:57] mind he you know and then
[1:02:59] he actually become what brother wash
[1:03:01] flunky
[1:03:02] amen we know back in that time one of
[1:03:04] the lowest jobs you could get wasn't
[1:03:06] mcdonald's or burger king
[1:03:07] it was to become a foot wash funky at
[1:03:10] somebody's house
[1:03:12] amen just to have to wash somebody's
[1:03:14] dirty feet uh you
[1:03:16] all know hey man if you had to do that
[1:03:17] on a daily basis for
[1:03:19] you know every hour of the day everybody
[1:03:21] come somebody else all you do is go in
[1:03:23] there and scrub their feet
[1:03:25] you know we'd probably be wearing
[1:03:27] plastic gloves and everything else
[1:03:29] because we want to at least stay clean i
[1:03:31] don't know if they had all of that back
[1:03:32] then
[1:03:35] but they would go down there and wash
[1:03:37] one another feet how many knows that
[1:03:39] whenever that harlot mary i believe it
[1:03:41] was come in there
[1:03:42] amen she seen that nobody was washing
[1:03:44] his feet you're not right
[1:03:45] amen nobody was washing feet he was
[1:03:48] mistreated
[1:03:50] oh my we talked about respect wednesday
[1:03:53] night but you know i believe that
[1:03:55] amen jesus does not get the respect
[1:03:58] that he deserves
[1:04:05] no think about it look at the world
[1:04:07] everything that he's created everything
[1:04:09] i don't care every sinner i don't care
[1:04:11] every one of them they would not have a
[1:04:13] breath
[1:04:13] in their mouth they wouldn't have any
[1:04:14] food to eat they wouldn't have a roof on
[1:04:16] their head if it wasn't for almighty god
[1:04:18] but yet they can't give him that honor
[1:04:20] and that glory
[1:04:22] amen they'll eat like brother man says
[1:04:24] like he said somebody that i guess he
[1:04:26] ran into it
[1:04:27] amen at the dinner table just begin to
[1:04:29] eat you know and enjoy the food and so
[1:04:31] forth and didn't even pray for it he
[1:04:33] says it reminded him
[1:04:34] of a pig under apple tree and never
[1:04:36] looking up to see where the owl will
[1:04:38] come from
[1:04:39] never being thankful for where it came
[1:04:40] from i believe that's
[1:04:42] one part of looking back and remembering
[1:04:45] things because when you talk about
[1:04:47] remembrance how many knows remembrance
[1:04:49] has to do with the past
[1:04:54] remembrance has to do with the past amen
[1:04:57] and i'll tell you what i
[1:04:59] oh my amen
[1:05:05] when you begin to think about the past
[1:05:09] and when you begin to think about this
[1:05:11] body
[1:05:12] that was broken for you
[1:05:16] he lived a life of servitude
[1:05:19] he lived a life of example of what a
[1:05:22] christian should be
[1:05:23] i mean you can read the matthew mark
[1:05:25] luke and john
[1:05:26] you can read the life of jesus and you
[1:05:29] can know
[1:05:30] how you're supposed to be
[1:05:38] oh because his life was a reflection
[1:05:42] of how we're supposed to be because
[1:05:43] we're sons and daughters of god
[1:05:45] we look back oh my we remember
[1:05:48] let's remember this morning we're going
[1:05:51] to remember this morning
[1:05:57] because this is the time to remember now
[1:06:00] is the time to remember because there
[1:06:04] will be
[1:06:04] people that don't remember don't
[1:06:08] think about it don't want to think about
[1:06:10] it
[1:06:11] blot it out of their mind what jesus did
[1:06:13] for them
[1:06:15] but you know how many knows that in hell
[1:06:18] they're going to remember
[1:06:21] what's going to make hell so bad
[1:06:24] is the things that the people remember
[1:06:27] how many knows our conscience and our
[1:06:29] mind if it gets messed up
[1:06:31] we can be really miserable people
[1:06:35] that's right if you have a you know a
[1:06:38] guilty conscience if you have
[1:06:40] something bad things that happen in your
[1:06:42] past you know or whatever you know
[1:06:45] you know all kinds of things people get
[1:06:47] nervous people have breakdowns people
[1:06:49] go crazy because of things they remember
[1:06:53] and if you let me just talk about that
[1:06:54] for a minute remember over in uh
[1:06:57] in the bible where he talks about that
[1:06:59] rich young not rich young ruler but the
[1:07:01] rich man in lazarus i believe in the
[1:07:03] beggar you know that didn't have any
[1:07:05] comfort the only comfort he had was the
[1:07:07] dogs licking his sores
[1:07:11] ah that feels good look at some bulldog
[1:07:14] that feels so good
[1:07:16] huh but he laid at the rich man's gate
[1:07:19] you know and
[1:07:20] he would drive out in his cadillac and
[1:07:22] his nice escalator or whatever it was
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] he'd drive on past him you know he'd
[1:07:27] leave him sitting on the sidewalk
[1:07:28] never give him nothing never give him no
[1:07:31] medicine never helping or anything you
[1:07:32] know
[1:07:33] and he prospered you know but the bible
[1:07:35] says that he went to hell
[1:07:36] in that light and he lifted up his soul
[1:07:38] in hell and seen abraham afar off
[1:07:42] huh and he said give me a little water
[1:07:44] you know i want
[1:07:45] just a little you know i like that song
[1:07:47] it's just just one drop of water
[1:07:50] is all that he wants anymore just one
[1:07:52] drop of water
[1:07:53] even just one drop of water it's all he
[1:07:55] wanted
[1:07:58] amen but he wasn't gonna get there was a
[1:07:59] goal fix you know and
[1:08:01] amen and abraham says you know i can't
[1:08:03] help you because there's a goal fix
[1:08:05] between here but remember in thy
[1:08:08] lifetime how that thou
[1:08:10] has things so good
[1:08:13] you know but this lazarus i believe his
[1:08:15] name was he's this beggar he didn't have
[1:08:17] a
[1:08:18] good life you know and he was in heaven
[1:08:20] and he wanted him to come and comfort
[1:08:22] him a little bit you had it good but he
[1:08:23] had it bad
[1:08:24] now remember how things had and then
[1:08:27] what did he try to say become a
[1:08:29] missionary go tell my brothers
[1:08:31] go tell my my family not to come to this
[1:08:34] place
[1:08:35] how many believe that's what we're doing
[1:08:37] right now is we're telling people
[1:08:39] don't go to that place
[1:08:43] this is the voice this is when you hear
[1:08:45] don't go
[1:08:46] down that downward spiral don't go down
[1:08:49] that road brother madam said whatever
[1:08:51] you do don't go down that road you can't
[1:08:53] imagine hell being that bad
[1:08:58] because by tomorrow we may be having a
[1:09:00] funeral for you
[1:09:01] or for me you have no idea
[1:09:05] and then what you remembered whether you
[1:09:07] remembered what god did for you or
[1:09:09] whether you ignored it
[1:09:10] will come back in your mind because this
[1:09:11] is the time of opportunity
[1:09:14] how many believes we're a privileged
[1:09:15] people
[1:09:17] i want to tell you in the name of the
[1:09:18] lord i believe that we under
[1:09:20] we take for granted the privileged
[1:09:23] people that we are why
[1:09:27] i'll tell you why we are a privileged
[1:09:29] people is because
[1:09:30] over in the old testament before christ
[1:09:32] died on calvary shed back his
[1:09:34] uh holy spirit upon us before that time
[1:09:37] it didn't matter how much they wanted to
[1:09:39] overcome sin no matter how much they
[1:09:41] wanted to confess their sins and make
[1:09:43] but
[1:09:43] they'd always have to get a lamb they
[1:09:45] would have to kill it
[1:09:46] and amen they'd have to make a sacrifice
[1:09:48] but they could never change that nature
[1:09:51] that was on the inside it could never
[1:09:53] change what was really living in there
[1:09:56] that had to be a miserable bondage
[1:09:59] that had to be chains of circumstance of
[1:10:02] sin that couldn't break
[1:10:04] hello but afterwards you and i
[1:10:07] now until he takes and until he rises
[1:10:10] from that mercy
[1:10:11] that he's on now we are privileged to be
[1:10:14] able to approach his
[1:10:16] throne without killing any lamb because
[1:10:18] the lamb has already been slain
[1:10:21] the body has already been broken
[1:10:24] he has already paid the price amen
[1:10:30] amen and then that
[1:10:34] hopefully we'll get to it i don't want
[1:10:35] to go in a hurry is that all right can
[1:10:37] we take our time
[1:10:39] amen can we stay till three o'clock
[1:10:43] huh i said i'm just getting permission
[1:10:46] i'm not saying that's what we're going
[1:10:47] to do
[1:10:52] oh my when i get to do that oh my i just
[1:10:55] tell you
[1:10:55] what i think about the goodness of god
[1:11:00] when i think of the goodness of jesus
[1:11:03] and all that he has done for me
[1:11:06] then my soul cries hallelujah
[1:11:10] praise god for saving me
[1:11:16] amen when you begin to think about the
[1:11:18] goodness of jesus
[1:11:20] what he's done for you what he did for
[1:11:23] you
[1:11:25] amen what did he do
[1:11:28] first of all that's what he did and he
[1:11:31] lived a life
[1:11:32] he was a perfect man and what happened
[1:11:36] all of a sudden we're going to take him
[1:11:38] now let's take him a little further
[1:11:40] let's take him past his life
[1:11:41] amen because so he told us many things
[1:11:44] but
[1:11:45] one thing that he did for us is amen we
[1:11:47] know that he was
[1:11:48] the perfect spotless lamb of god
[1:11:53] amen and there was nothing like it there
[1:11:56] was
[1:11:56] nothing like it that god would
[1:11:59] condescend and that he would come down
[1:12:02] in the form of a man a form of a sinful
[1:12:06] man and then they begin to
[1:12:09] accuse him isn't that right
[1:12:12] they accused him of all kinds of things
[1:12:17] now let me ask you this and so they
[1:12:20] accuse you of
[1:12:21] things and and did did he ever say did
[1:12:24] those pharisees ever say well let's just
[1:12:26] forgive him
[1:12:29] you know he made himself god but we're
[1:12:31] going to forgive him
[1:12:33] no how many knows that at the time of
[1:12:35] the crucifixion that was the time that
[1:12:38] uh romans would always release one of
[1:12:40] the priests on earth and let him go free
[1:12:44] you know and they could have done it
[1:12:46] they could have said let him go free now
[1:12:48] i know that but let him go free but he
[1:12:50] says who do you want me to release jesus
[1:12:54] and they said release barabbas says he
[1:12:56] was a murderer
[1:12:58] they would rather have had barabbas a
[1:13:01] murderer
[1:13:02] released oh my
[1:13:05] which is also a type of what has
[1:13:07] happened in our day
[1:13:09] denominations they would rather have
[1:13:11] gone with man-made things that kill them
[1:13:14] rather than the vindicated proven son of
[1:13:16] god
[1:13:17] the messiah showing himself again and
[1:13:19] alive among us
[1:13:21] that same thing happened today but they
[1:13:23] wanted a barabbas they released him they
[1:13:25] didn't
[1:13:26] so i wrote down here that jesus was
[1:13:30] unforgiven
[1:13:34] he was unforgiven so that you could be
[1:13:37] forgiven
[1:13:42] how many we are human let me tell you
[1:13:43] something we as humans we have a
[1:13:46] real tendency to slip
[1:13:51] what does the bible say be careful that
[1:13:53] you do not let these things
[1:13:54] slip we have a tender thing this is
[1:13:57] things
[1:13:58] to let it slip and why do you think
[1:14:01] jesus asked us to remember things
[1:14:03] we need to refresh our memory sometimes
[1:14:07] of what god has done for us the
[1:14:10] opportunity that we have
[1:14:12] and i could begin to understand why even
[1:14:14] the prophet would tell us
[1:14:16] that we ought to be the happiest people
[1:14:19] on the face of the earth
[1:14:25] why because of the opportunity that you
[1:14:27] have
[1:14:28] because of the privilege that you have
[1:14:30] this morning
[1:14:35] amen the privilege because
[1:14:38] of what he did
[1:14:45] amen this duke in remembrance
[1:14:48] of me amen this body
[1:14:53] this bread which represents my body
[1:14:55] which is broken for you
[1:14:57] now that was he unforgiven they did not
[1:15:00] forgive him
[1:15:01] he was not forgiven even though he
[1:15:04] wasn't didn't really have any guilt
[1:15:06] but they charged him with sin that was
[1:15:09] as he became sin
[1:15:11] that right he became sin for us
[1:15:15] and then what did he do they went he
[1:15:17] went to judgment
[1:15:19] i mean he went to judgment and he
[1:15:22] actually
[1:15:22] suffered the wrath of even almighty god
[1:15:25] he was judged
[1:15:27] he was not forgiven he was not only was
[1:15:30] he judged
[1:15:31] but he was condemned not only was he
[1:15:34] condemned
[1:15:35] but he was actually killed is that right
[1:15:39] he was actually sentenced and that
[1:15:41] sentence was
[1:15:43] carried out imagine paying for a sin you
[1:15:47] didn't do
[1:15:48] dying for something you didn't do
[1:15:52] how many knows that that when we were
[1:15:54] yet in sin
[1:15:56] and trespasses christ died
[1:15:59] for us amen
[1:16:03] even while you were a sinner
[1:16:06] oh my he died for you he paid the price
[1:16:11] and that's why we sing so much about i
[1:16:13] know it was the blood
[1:16:15] i know it was the blood i know it was
[1:16:17] the blood for me
[1:16:19] one day when i was lost he died upon the
[1:16:22] cross
[1:16:22] i know it was the blood that's why he
[1:16:25] says this
[1:16:25] the cup is the blood of my new testament
[1:16:29] the new testament in my blood do you
[1:16:32] still remember
[1:16:33] because you wouldn't have any
[1:16:34] forgiveness if you wouldn't have shed
[1:16:36] his blood
[1:16:39] amen and that blood
[1:16:43] has the power to forgive you
[1:16:47] 490 times a day
[1:16:55] huh sometimes think god ain't going to
[1:16:58] forgive me
[1:16:59] i you know the thing of it is we don't
[1:17:01] forgive ourself we're harder on
[1:17:02] ourselves than god is
[1:17:06] huh
[1:17:10] but people give up on god is what you do
[1:17:13] you know when he is you
[1:17:16] have no idea the mercy and the grace
[1:17:19] that he has
[1:17:20] when that woman was caught in the very
[1:17:22] act of adultery she should have been
[1:17:24] stoned according to the word but she had
[1:17:27] mercy for it didn't he
[1:17:29] did he oh my think about he didn't
[1:17:31] condemn her
[1:17:33] she should have died she had been stoned
[1:17:36] but his grace reached out to her isn't
[1:17:38] that right
[1:17:39] his grace reached out to her and said
[1:17:41] neither do i
[1:17:42] condemn thee he became condemned
[1:17:46] so that we could be justified so that we
[1:17:48] could not be condemned
[1:17:52] amen how many knows he came so that he
[1:17:54] whosoever believeth in him
[1:17:56] saint john 3 i believe it is saint john
[1:17:59] 3
[1:18:00] 16. he you know he came into the world
[1:18:03] not to condemn the world but that the
[1:18:05] world through him might be saved
[1:18:08] praise the lord how many believe we need
[1:18:11] to remember
[1:18:12] these things because people
[1:18:15] take their salvation for granted
[1:18:19] how many of the best thing that ever
[1:18:20] could happen to you is for god to save
[1:18:23] you
[1:18:24] to fill you with the holy ghost to give
[1:18:26] you forgiveness
[1:18:27] of your sins
[1:18:32] praise be to god how many is glad that
[1:18:34] it doesn't matter now
[1:18:36] and man you don't have to come through a
[1:18:38] certain uh
[1:18:39] temple and sacrificed all these animals
[1:18:42] it was a bloody mess
[1:18:43] no all you got to do is fall on your
[1:18:46] knees and come before the throne
[1:18:48] amen and you can be granted forgiveness
[1:18:51] and grace right there
[1:18:54] anytime anywhere it don't matter if
[1:18:56] you're on a job it don't matter if
[1:18:57] you're driving down the road wherever it
[1:18:59] is
[1:18:59] amen god is available now to you
[1:19:03] jesus christ came to make himself
[1:19:05] accessible to you
[1:19:07] amen praise the lord listen to what he
[1:19:10] did
[1:19:12] and what he did for you amen
[1:19:18] praise be to god
[1:19:21] he became poor ain't that right
[1:19:27] he became the lowest he took
[1:19:30] your judgment he took your accusation
[1:19:35] because everything that he was accused
[1:19:37] of we were guilty of
[1:19:39] we were guilty of sin lying and stealing
[1:19:43] and cheating and everything else in the
[1:19:45] book
[1:19:46] and he became our sin took our judgment
[1:19:50] took our condemnation and took it to
[1:19:53] calvary
[1:19:56] oh my you would think that if the world
[1:20:00] really would grasp
[1:20:01] everybody out there would really grasp
[1:20:04] that god so loved the world that he gave
[1:20:06] his only son that whosoever would
[1:20:08] believe in him should not perish
[1:20:10] but have everlasting life how many knows
[1:20:13] that
[1:20:13] brother bran preached a message called
[1:20:15] why and on the judgment day god's going
[1:20:17] to ask
[1:20:17] so many people why didn't you
[1:20:20] he's going to ask him why i had so much
[1:20:24] love for you i gave my life for you on
[1:20:26] calvary
[1:20:27] but you didn't have any respect for that
[1:20:29] at all
[1:20:33] isn't that right why did you not respect
[1:20:35] that why didn't you
[1:20:36] realize that hey that was for you
[1:20:40] well i just didn't think i could that's
[1:20:42] where you made your mistake
[1:20:44] brother you send yourself to hell by the
[1:20:48] judgment that you make
[1:20:50] amen so what do you do he
[1:20:53] actually was hung on calvary force he uh
[1:20:56] was
[1:20:57] unforgiven so that you could be forgiven
[1:20:59] of your sin
[1:21:01] amen took our punishment and not only
[1:21:04] that but he went to hell
[1:21:07] i mean as he went to the bottom to the
[1:21:09] lowest regions of hell
[1:21:11] he went all the way down he went into
[1:21:13] death he took suffered death farts
[1:21:16] amen it didn't work i am that one that
[1:21:18] was to come i'm the one that's
[1:21:20] heard about coming right in
[1:21:24] lifetime there why because he went to
[1:21:26] the lowest health
[1:21:28] that he went into hell but god has
[1:21:30] exalted him and i believe he's in the
[1:21:31] friend gave him a name
[1:21:33] that is above any name there is no name
[1:21:36] in
[1:21:36] all of the earth like the name of jesus
[1:21:39] christ
[1:21:41] no other name given under heaven why be
[1:21:43] who must be saved and every niche about
[1:21:46] every tongue shall confess
[1:21:48] that jesus christ is lord

[1:22:11] don't care what you say
[1:22:12] jesus truly is lord
[1:22:16] he is lord of all he will descend so
[1:22:19] high until the souls that are the under
[1:22:21] the altar brother brandon was caught up
[1:22:22] in that dimension about 40
[1:22:24] 20 feet up he's seen millions of saved
[1:22:26] christians
[1:22:27] and then he wanted to see jesus he says
[1:22:29] you can't see that him yet
[1:22:30] he's up a little higher than that he was
[1:22:33] taken
[1:22:34] way up there sitting at the right hand
[1:22:36] of god sent back his holy spirit
[1:22:38] upon you and me amen that's where we get
[1:22:42] into some of the things that he did for
[1:22:44] you
[1:22:45] oh i'm so happy about what he did for me
[1:22:49] oh there's billions of people out there
[1:22:51] this morning that don't got the baptism
[1:22:53] of the holy ghost
[1:22:54] don't know the grace of god in their
[1:22:56] heart they're so far away they're
[1:22:57] miserable
[1:22:58] they got to mark themselves up they got
[1:23:00] to do their hair or style they got to
[1:23:02] wear all kinds of crazy clothes every
[1:23:04] which way
[1:23:06] why because you're missing that
[1:23:08] satisfied i'm
[1:23:09] satisfied why because god had mercy on
[1:23:13] me
[1:23:16] praise be to god let's get into
[1:23:18] something just a little bit deeper
[1:23:21] how many knows that whom the lord called
[1:23:24] he also predestinated
[1:23:26] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:30] maybe i'll just read that let me just
[1:23:31] read that in ephesians
[1:23:33] we're going to get into what god knew
[1:23:36] because god knows the end from the
[1:23:37] beginning
[1:23:38] he knows everything amen
[1:23:42] ephesians 1 and verse 3 it says blessed
[1:23:44] be the god and father of the lord jesus
[1:23:45] christ
[1:23:46] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:23:50] blessings
[1:23:52] in heavenly places in christ
[1:23:56] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:24:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:06] everybody keep your seats now don't
[1:24:08] gonna run around too much so once you
[1:24:09] get out of
[1:24:10] here
[1:24:13] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:24:16] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:24:18] before him
[1:24:19] in love amen we know that according to
[1:24:22] revelations 18 he says our names that
[1:24:24] were put on the land book of life
[1:24:26] from the foundation of the world god
[1:24:28] knew who would want it and who would not
[1:24:31] want it
[1:24:32] amen and he put those names down that he
[1:24:34] knew we wanted because that's who he
[1:24:36] really died for
[1:24:37] was the one that he knew that would want
[1:24:39] it
[1:24:43] you ought to be the happiest person in
[1:24:45] the world if you have a desire in your
[1:24:47] hearts and
[1:24:47] that's what i want about being popular
[1:24:50] that's what i want about being rich
[1:24:52] that's what i want above everything else
[1:24:53] is i just want to know
[1:24:55] that i know my master i just want to
[1:24:58] know him greater i want to have
[1:24:59] accept what he has done for me
[1:25:02] huh and to know that he comes down and
[1:25:06] doesn't work in each one of our lives
[1:25:07] because how many knows
[1:25:08] we all got to get down on our knees and
[1:25:10] say here i am lord
[1:25:12] forgive me in my sins fill me with the
[1:25:15] holy ghost
[1:25:17] and i'm here to tell you if that ever
[1:25:18] happens it is a divine
[1:25:20] act of almighty god it's not by your
[1:25:23] good works
[1:25:25] it's not even by your desire well i'm
[1:25:28] going to try no
[1:25:29] god has placed that desire in there
[1:25:31] already because he knew who you was
[1:25:34] amen they put that name on the book
[1:25:38] amen we failed to realize that what he
[1:25:40] did on calvary
[1:25:42] and when he paid that price and when he
[1:25:44] actually redeemed you
[1:25:46] now he knows he actually redeems you
[1:25:49] when you
[1:25:50] and him become one the holy spirit which
[1:25:52] is god's very own life
[1:25:55] it's jesus christ it's who it is the
[1:25:57] pillar fire when that little fire comes
[1:25:59] down into your heart
[1:26:00] you too become one
[1:26:03] hello and this is what he does
[1:26:07] for you amen remember what he did
[1:26:10] amen on calvary for the whole world and
[1:26:13] then you remember what he did
[1:26:15] for you specifically
[1:26:19] amen never shall
[1:26:23] forget the day amen when jesus rolled
[1:26:27] all my burdens away how many i'll never
[1:26:29] forget the day
[1:26:31] amen because i'll tell you right now i
[1:26:33] can take you to the time
[1:26:35] and i can take you to the place where
[1:26:37] the lord saved me
[1:26:38] by his amazing wonderful grace
[1:26:42] and calvary become real to me what he
[1:26:45] did was real to me and this morning i
[1:26:47] want to honor him
[1:26:48] i want to remember what he done
[1:26:52] amen because if it wasn't for that then
[1:26:56] none of us would have had a chance to
[1:26:58] make heaven or to for there to be a
[1:27:00] rapture
[1:27:01] that's why it was a finished work the
[1:27:03] work was finished
[1:27:04] isn't that right it is done
[1:27:08] it was the type host the blood is the
[1:27:10] typo
[1:27:11] so much spoken about the breaking of his
[1:27:14] body
[1:27:14] about the blood that was shed for me
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:18] how many appreciates the blood that was
[1:27:21] shed for you

[1:27:36] want to read a scripture out of the book
[1:27:38] of romans
[1:27:40] i like the way that paul put it he had a
[1:27:43] revelation also
[1:27:44] it was paul he was a rascal
[1:27:49] he was zealous he was throwing people in
[1:27:52] jail he was going from city to city and
[1:27:54] getting christians and putting them in
[1:27:56] jail
[1:27:57] he was holding the coats of everybody
[1:27:59] that went there and grabbed rocks

[1:28:36] thousand years bright shining shining as
[1:28:39] the sun will have no less days to sing
[1:28:41] god's praise
[1:28:42] than when we first begun
[1:28:48] has your enthusiasm for your salvation
[1:28:51] diminished have you forgotten
[1:28:55] what the lord has brought you from
[1:28:58] where he picked you up
[1:29:01] amen he brought me out of the miry clay
[1:29:04] set my feet on the rock this day
[1:29:07] amen i think people do
[1:29:10] and their worship begins to dwindle
[1:29:18] i was thinking you know one of the
[1:29:19] greatest things that you're going to
[1:29:20] hear is people worshiping and praising
[1:29:22] god in a church
[1:29:23] for what he has done worship
[1:29:27] thanks giving back to god thanking god
[1:29:30] for what he's done
[1:29:32] amen i believe y'all's first song
[1:29:35] amen as i will enter his gates with
[1:29:37] thanksgiving
[1:29:38] in my heart i will enter his courts with
[1:29:40] praise and i was just thinking back
[1:29:42] there
[1:29:42] and that's writing these things down of
[1:29:44] the things that we have to be thankful
[1:29:46] for
[1:29:47] the things that we ought to do not
[1:29:48] always asking god for more and god give
[1:29:50] me this and god no begin to fake him
[1:29:53] thank god and praise him don't come to
[1:29:56] church
[1:29:57] with no praise in your heart how
[1:30:00] horrible a sound is to be in church and
[1:30:02] never hear no amen
[1:30:04] oh it's a horrible sound it's
[1:30:08] gives me the goosebumps
[1:30:11] this is cold in here nobody gotta
[1:30:15] praise the lord brother
[1:30:17] [Music]

[1:30:20] we get over to heaven i'm gonna run and
[1:30:22] scream and jump i'm gonna kick my feet
[1:30:24] sideways upside down and everybody
[1:30:26] do flips probably we're gonna have a
[1:30:28] time
[1:30:30] amen that's exactly right
[1:30:33] joy unspeakable and full of glory is
[1:30:35] what it is
[1:30:37] and we walk around with our faces what
[1:30:40] is wrong with us
[1:30:42] i'll tell you what's wrong with us we
[1:30:43] have forgotten what the lord has done
[1:30:46] for us
[1:30:47] we have forgotten where he has hewed us
[1:30:49] from
[1:30:50] amen oh my when i think about it
[1:30:55] i was lost and not without god or his
[1:30:58] son
[1:30:59] but he reached down his hand for me
[1:31:02] marvelous grace grace marvelous grace
[1:31:08] grace that is greater than all my sins
[1:31:11] and my failures
[1:31:13] amen aren't you glad for him
[1:31:17] paul says in chapter 5 of romans he says
[1:31:19] therefore being
[1:31:20] justified by faith how many knows he
[1:31:23] rose
[1:31:24] for our justification when he rose
[1:31:27] that sealed it he justified
[1:31:31] another made it right because if he
[1:31:33] didn't raise none of it would have been
[1:31:35] any good
[1:31:36] but raising he justified freely forever
[1:31:41] we have peace with god
[1:31:44] how many know there was a time when you
[1:31:46] and i were not at peace with god
[1:31:48] god was not at peace with you as long as
[1:31:50] you're living in sin
[1:31:52] god is not at peace with you if you're
[1:31:54] not right in your heart
[1:31:55] god is not at peace with you there's a
[1:31:58] battle raging
[1:32:00] huh because god
[1:32:04] and sin can't live together
[1:32:07] amen no
[1:32:10] it has to be dealt with
[1:32:16] isn't it nice that we don't have to
[1:32:17] bring a bunch of goats a bunch of sheep
[1:32:20] come in here and grab somebody to get a
[1:32:23] knife and cut their throat and blood
[1:32:24] splattering everywhere
[1:32:27] huh kind of nice
[1:32:31] thank you jesus everybody say thank you
[1:32:32] jesus
[1:32:35] all you have to do is have faith right
[1:32:38] that's all you got to do
[1:32:39] is have faith in what he did for you on
[1:32:41] calvary
[1:32:44] how many say i believe lord
[1:32:47] i receive lord thank you jesus
[1:32:52] listen we have faith
[1:32:56] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:32:57] jesus christ and by whom we also have
[1:33:00] access by faith into this grace wherein
[1:33:03] we stand
[1:33:04] and rejoice in the hope of the glory of
[1:33:08] god
[1:33:11] not only so but we also glory and
[1:33:13] tribulation
[1:33:14] knowing that tribulation works patience
[1:33:17] praise be to god how many knows we all
[1:33:19] need that
[1:33:20] once you're saved god does the work in
[1:33:22] you and he allows things to come your
[1:33:24] way
[1:33:26] i'm going to say it again it is good for
[1:33:29] us
[1:33:29] for something to happen that you don't
[1:33:31] agree with
[1:33:33] it's really the best thing can happen
[1:33:35] because we're going to find out just
[1:33:36] what you're made of
[1:33:40] because god knows there's a lot of
[1:33:41] things i don't agree with
[1:33:44] but is what is your attitude towards it
[1:33:47] huh what's it do to you does it get you
[1:33:49] all upset
[1:33:50] oh something wrong there
[1:33:55] boy brother i tell you what said
[1:33:57] something to me i don't
[1:33:58] well that's good for you it's good for
[1:34:01] us to get the rub the
[1:34:02] hair up the wrong way see we have that
[1:34:11] right it's good for tribulation trials
[1:34:15] oh yeah somebody to disagree with you
[1:34:21] uh yeah disagree with you oh boy we just
[1:34:24] don't like that do we
[1:34:27] why brother michael
[1:34:31] i don't care there's no two men that
[1:34:33] think alike perfectly all the time i
[1:34:35] said
[1:34:36] no well you have two different heads
[1:34:39] there's two different opinions two
[1:34:41] different thoughts a lot of times
[1:34:43] so much so that from what i understand
[1:34:45] god usually don't send two prophets at
[1:34:47] the same time
[1:34:49] even peter and paul had such disputes
[1:34:52] until they had to go to their separate
[1:34:53] ways
[1:34:54] they were both men of god
[1:34:58] that agree you're going to agree with
[1:34:59] everything but what's going to be your
[1:35:02] attitude that's a big question
[1:35:04] and that tells you whether you're right
[1:35:06] or not
[1:35:07] amen listen to this so we have
[1:35:11] tribulation we don't just glory and all
[1:35:12] that
[1:35:13] but we uh we praise god
[1:35:17] in tribulation amen
[1:35:21] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:35:22] patience and patience experience and
[1:35:24] experience hope
[1:35:26] and hope make maketh not ashamed because
[1:35:28] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[1:35:29] hearts by the holy ghost
[1:35:32] amen for when we were yet without
[1:35:36] strength
[1:35:37] in due time christ died for the ungodly
[1:35:42] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:35:44] one die
[1:35:46] yet pre-adventure for a good man some
[1:35:48] would even dare to die
[1:35:50] but god commendeth his love towards us
[1:35:52] that in that while we were yet sinners
[1:35:55] christ died for us
[1:35:59] much more than being now justified by
[1:36:03] his blood
[1:36:04] amen how many believes that's what we're
[1:36:06] remembering this morning
[1:36:08] remember his blood is what helps you
[1:36:11] and the only chance that you have of
[1:36:14] standing
[1:36:15] as though you never did it in the first
[1:36:18] place
[1:36:22] folks i am glad to have the revelation
[1:36:24] to know that if
[1:36:25] justification isn't forgiven
[1:36:27] justification is as though you had never
[1:36:29] done it
[1:36:30] in the first place
[1:36:37] i love these thoughts these thoughts of
[1:36:39] god are awesome
[1:36:42] amen to think peter that i remember that
[1:36:44] stuff
[1:36:45] i remember that stuff and i hate even
[1:36:47] think about my past but i know that god
[1:36:52] don't remember it
[1:36:54] amen huh i'd have to remind him
[1:37:00] huh say what because he forgets
[1:37:03] puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:37:09] that ought to put a smile on all our
[1:37:11] faith that arabic is happy to know that
[1:37:14] if you're forgiven and god has justified
[1:37:16] you amen it's though you have never done
[1:37:18] it in the first place
[1:37:20] so if it comes into your mind just shut
[1:37:22] it out
[1:37:24] just shove it out say no
[1:37:27] because i'll tell you this that's where
[1:37:29] the biggest battle is right here
[1:37:31] the things that you allow to come into
[1:37:33] your mind
[1:37:34] is where your battle is the things that
[1:37:37] you think about is where your battle is
[1:37:39] amen all right
[1:37:42] on down and if
[1:37:46] not notice much more than yet we were
[1:37:49] said sinners
[1:37:50] much more than verse 9 being not
[1:37:52] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[1:37:54] from the wrath
[1:37:55] from wrath through him for if when we
[1:37:58] were
[1:38:00] enemies
[1:38:02] we were reconciled to god by his the
[1:38:05] death of his son
[1:38:07] much more being reconciled we shall be
[1:38:09] saved
[1:38:10] by his life and not only so but we also
[1:38:14] joy in god through our lord jesus christ

[1:42:35] if anybody's praying folks or has prayed
[1:42:39] amen how many knows over in heaven it
[1:42:41] talks about the
[1:42:42] the that vial is poured out which was
[1:42:44] the prayers of the saints
[1:42:47] amen so i believe when you're making
[1:42:49] investments and when you're praying
[1:42:51] amen for me and for the service hey i
[1:42:53] believe that god begins to pour it out
[1:42:55] say here i'm hearing that prayer right
[1:42:56] now
[1:42:59] because i don't want to come up here
[1:43:00] just to give a speech
[1:43:02] or some intellectual talk or just
[1:43:06] take a certain message pick it and
[1:43:08] preach it i don't want to just do that
[1:43:10] i want to say what god wants me to say
[1:43:13] on a preach discernment that we all
[1:43:15] have need of hearing
[1:43:18] a timely message a word in season
[1:43:22] how precious it is in season because you
[1:43:25] can do that all day long just pick
[1:43:26] something of this that or the other
[1:43:28] but we want the leading of the spirit we
[1:43:29] want him to have the preeminence in our
[1:43:31] life
[1:43:32] how many believes that because of what
[1:43:34] he did because of calvary because of
[1:43:36] remembering him amen we have been
[1:43:39] brought back into
[1:43:40] sonship of god
[1:43:45] i don't oh my i just feel like i'm about
[1:43:48] supposed to be that tall in god and i'm
[1:43:51] about
[1:43:52] that tall you know
[1:43:55] why brother violet because i know that
[1:43:57] that when he died for us in that bible
[1:43:59] and everything in there when you're
[1:44:01] reconciled to god
[1:44:02] you have you you have a right to every
[1:44:05] redemptive blessing that adam lost
[1:44:08] and he believes we're reconciled back to
[1:44:10] god amen we have fellowship with god
[1:44:12] because that's what communion is really
[1:44:14] all about the prophet god said you know
[1:44:16] it's not so much a taking of the bread
[1:44:17] of wine but it's about communion
[1:44:19] it's about fellowship it's about having
[1:44:22] a relationship with god
[1:44:23] amen and talking to god getting together
[1:44:26] to church
[1:44:26] amen with brothers and sisters and
[1:44:28] fellowshipping around the word of god
[1:44:30] and speaking to god and not just praying
[1:44:33] and talking to god and telling him but
[1:44:34] he says sometimes we need to stop
[1:44:36] and listen to what he's got to say back
[1:44:41] i'm going to ask you a question this
[1:44:43] morning how many this morning
[1:44:46] so many times we'll
[1:44:49] pray and pray and pray but you don't
[1:44:51] give it 30 seconds to a minute
[1:44:57] to listen and be quiet and hear back
[1:45:00] because the prophet of god said he said
[1:45:01] he was
[1:45:02] he was horrible about not doing it and
[1:45:04] he says when he would do it he received
[1:45:05] some of his greatest blessings
[1:45:07] when he would actually listen for god to
[1:45:09] speak back
[1:45:11] how many knows it's important how many
[1:45:12] is guilty this morning yeah we pray but
[1:45:14] i don't listen enough
[1:45:16] my mind my hands are up y'all say my
[1:45:19] prayer and amen
[1:45:20] i'm gone no stay there
[1:45:23] and listen see what because how many
[1:45:25] believes god wants to speak to you
[1:45:28] he wants to speak to you any of us that
[1:45:31] are spiritual
[1:45:33] know that god can speak to you in many
[1:45:35] different ways
[1:45:37] many different ways he can use a tape he
[1:45:39] can use the bible he can use your
[1:45:40] brother he can use his answer he can use
[1:45:42] the pastor he can use many different
[1:45:44] he can use the you know things that are
[1:45:47] happening in your life
[1:45:48] he can use nature he can use whatever
[1:45:50] but when you hear that voice
[1:45:52] and you know it's god speaking
[1:45:56] me and my wife we was in a situation
[1:45:58] here in the last few days and i didn't
[1:45:59] know what to do with it
[1:46:02] you know do i do it this way do i do it
[1:46:04] that way do i do it this way i don't
[1:46:06] know just how to treat this situation
[1:46:08] but i waited on the lord i waited
[1:46:12] and waited and just like that little
[1:46:15] letter i wrote to you years ago when i
[1:46:17] was in florida with my wife
[1:46:19] talking about the evening like
[1:46:20] tabernacle shall stand
[1:46:22] that inspiration struck amen
[1:46:26] and i began to just say the words
[1:46:29] those are the words that i used and the
[1:46:31] things that i did
[1:46:32] and it all worked out good hello
[1:46:36] but you have to wait on the lord don't
[1:46:38] be in a hurry
[1:46:40] don't get in a rehearsal in a bustle
[1:46:41] don't do things in your own self
[1:46:44] you let the make sure that it's the holy
[1:46:47] spirit doing it
[1:46:48] and it will be done right it will come
[1:46:51] out right because he never does anything
[1:46:54] wrong
[1:46:56] amen always comes out right when the
