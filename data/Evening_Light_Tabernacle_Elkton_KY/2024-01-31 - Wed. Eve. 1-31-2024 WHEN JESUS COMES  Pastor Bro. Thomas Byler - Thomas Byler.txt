and so we uh amen came back and we were in Springfield Kentucky amen and uh my truck all of a sudden the front endend it sounded like the wheel was gonna fall off grinding and stuff and the automatic brake system light and the anti-skid lights came on which it had been doing a little bit of that but I don't know what it is but it sounded like a bearing or or the axle was about to break loose or something and we we managed to skimp all the way home amen got into the driveway with any sooner so the Lord brought us home right amen so we got the bug this morning this evening come to church and got up the gas station and a bunch of steam comes up on the engine I'm like oh boy what is it now is we went under there and I guess a little plastic thing had broke loose it was saking water and I went and pushed it a little bit and that's all it took it just broke right off I had my white shirt and everything that's two down I already had a van in the shop so I got three of my vehicles down good thing I have four so we're down our last leg but we got some kind so we're just get that I told Brother Ste Steve amen I come in early I come in time for prayer meeting after all of that but so it was a good thing we left the house earlier and I got my cup of coffee over at the five star I like that bold stuff you know and so can't do without it but anyway so we got that and amen praise the Lord good to be here good to be in of the Lord amen good to have a church that's alive amen how many glad that there you have we have a church that's alive in Christ because the fact is there are some out there aren't just it's just ply dead folks might as well close them down that's a big thing to say but that's the truth amen but you know I thinking you know we're I'm I'm a blessed Pastor to be able to preach amen because you're alive amen we're all alive in Christ amen and so we're real glad and happy for that tonight and so amen uh praise the Lord God is good I can't think of anything else let's just go before the Lord in prayer kind Heavenly Father we once again are so grateful Lord to be able to Bow our heads to close our eyes and to speak to you father Lord I ask God that as we try to just try to get a grasp father of the privileged people that we are tonight and of the treasure that we have in this earth and vessel father we ask God that you just help us to convey it in the way that you want to convey it Lord and say what you once said tonight help me to just completely get out of the way father Lord Jesus and you just take your word father and Bless the people with it help us as we draw closer to you you'll not go out the same so Lord whatever change that is we believe God that it'll be Lord and I already feel it that it won't be for the worse for us but it'll be be better God that we'll leave here a better people than what we come so we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word the meditation of a heart and that which we feel you've laid on our heart to minister tonight just give us the ability that only the Holy Spirit Can Do Lord Jesus we do remember all those that are sick and Afflicted Lord bless them Lord in a special way in Jesus name amen and amen if you will just a simple Anytime You Preach anything out of the word of God it's always good amen praise the Lord turn to St John if you will St John let's go with the 11th chapter and the 17 th verse then when Jesus came he found that he had laid in the grave 4 days already may God had his blessings to the reading of the word you can preceed it tonight amen I want to title this when Jesus comes when Jesus comes amen one place I believe the Bible says that the spirit of Christ of God is the spirit of Prophecy amen how many knows that Spirit of Prophecy prophecy that right things that's ahead am comes we know that the prophet also taught us that God has before the foundation of the word world alloted a certain word for every age that right every age has a certain word amen so Christ is going to be made manifest in that word that he has spoken now I won't go into detail I didn't go into the study of it but you know brother Braham talked about how that you as a Believer as a Son of God are the manifested word of God you're the light for your day Jesus says you are the light of the world Amen because it's no longer Jesus walking on the shores of Galilee it's Jesus now walking in you and you become the light of the world Amen praise the Lord that means that the current that's flowing through the light so to speak amen through that switch and so forth the spark that it takes Amen to light up those lights amen that has to be running through your body if that's not in your heart then you're just a church member amen how many know we've got many of those churches churches churches people are filled up with nomal Christians without that spark that brother Tommy talked about amen without that spark to ignite it I me know so gasoline is part of the mechanics amen it's part of the mechanics just like the oil's part of the mechanics but that spark amen that is a dynamic it takes amen that Supernatural power Amen to make that gas move and that's the way the word of God is we need the spirit of God to come to ignite it and make it live amen amen how many knows that for th thousands of years the first coming of Christ was prophesied all through the Old Testament of how he was coming how he's coming how he's coming talk more about his second com did his first coming isin that right talked about his second coming so how many know there's another coming of Christ amen I want to say that Christ is always coming and he's always [Laughter] here it just comes to me now but how many knows he's always was he he was he is and he will be amen so he's all praise the Lord amen and so we're going to look at that and I'll pick up that thought perhaps right there a little bit in a little bit if the Lord wants me to talking about amen Revelations 1 and verse 7 says it this way behold he cometh amen here's another coming when Jesus comes W praise the Lord my my my my we could stay here till I don't know when amen how many's glad that we believe he's coming but I also believe that he's here he's here yes amen Sometimes some we pray too far away we believe too far we overreach so many times amen we overreach amen all right let's look at this this coming he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pi Ned him amen woo how many knows he's talking about the unbeliever he's talking about those that killed him amen every eye I let's stop there a minute we know every knee is going to bow now it said that every eye is going to see him you know how they deny him oh they want to put him away no no no no no no but they're going to have to look at him someday aren't you glad that you're looking at him a little bit sooner than that I'm glad that I already got a look amen because when you look now you had to live the stone that that come out of the mountain he says that stone amen if you that Stone Falls on you or if you fall on the stone I believe it is Say it'll Crush you it'll break you but he says on whom the stone will fall it will grind him to powder I would rather fall on the stone and let it break me amen I don't want to be ground to powder because there's coming a day that he'll grind to powder amen oh how thankful we ought to be I would think just before I came out here I thought you know you could be at uh I don't know IND these 500 if you could be at a Super Bowl you could be at a great event all of the great great events that you could possibly imagine that you could be at but I believe you're in the greatest place that is on the face of the Earth sitting in church yeah it does something to you you're sitting there and you're doing the greatest thing that there is to do amen that is to exalt his name that's to glorify God that's to praise him that's to feed on God feed on things that are Eternal I thought that's exactly if you've got Christ in your heart you can't be in the better place all right well praise the Lord every eye I shall see him and they also which Pierce him and all the kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so so it amen I am the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end aren't you glad that you are part of the word of God Amen amen part of the word of God we want to look at that what happens when Jesus does come to you last week even the heavens that you're going to is going to be changed even the heavens that we're going to is going to pass away Behold a new heavens and a new Earth that we're going to dwell on this Earth is going to have to be renovated and so forth amen and when Jesus comes when he meets you when you come in contact with Jesus what was the prophet that you know man can come in the presence of God and ever remain the same how many believes that's why it's so important the presence of God is so important when he comes a he changed me pretty near 40 years ago I guess it was and this world has never been the same ever since Mighty Jesus came well this world this world it's just never been the same never will be the same it'll always be changed I mean believe God comes to transform when Jesus come he comes to transform oh my let me let me try to get some of these starters out of the way shall we even so amen everybody when he comes he's coming with clouds every I shall see him there's another place I just was looking at the coming of or coming of Christ looked across the page there in Jude there in the last chapter it says Enoch also the seven from Adam propit side of the saying behold the Lord cometh with 10, thousands of his Saints W how many SE themselves there do you see yourself in that scripture I want to be the one that's with him coming I don't want to be on the other end I want to be with him when he comes how many believe that you'll be with him in the Judgment judging the world that's right amen I believe that's how the bride and the Church of God will have to do with judging the whole world they'll be there at the Judgment with him just a little thought but aren't you glad that on that day you'll really have Del will really be Justice nowadays there's no justice isn't that right did you all hear Trump saying some some little defaming word supposedly cost him $81 million for saying something he should have said how many people are saying stuff they shouldn't said oh my wow I'd be flat broke they have to put me wait forever they wouldn't have enough years to put me away for the stuff I've said amen M but over there every secret of the heart will be made known manifest amen there's not going to be any conniving it's all going to be clear when he comes with his 10,000s of his Saints to ex execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed huh W think about it look at what you done I did them ungodly things yeah homosexuality was ungodly all this trans stuff is ungodly they may not want to hear it here but they're going to hear it over there it's G to convince them of all the ungodly stuff that you did that's right amen oh my that's right and of all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him man I heard somebody on YouTube just say something filthy about the Lord Jesus Christ boy if I had the chance I said and do you think that you really do think that he rose again and stuff if he did you're in trouble for that words that you spoke and not even the idle word goes by without getting recompensed for it and then you want to speak against him you won't get away with that you want to say stuff you will answer for that every word that you speak speak against God yeah you go have your he today but guess what the day how many's looking for today is coming we're looking for what is coming with Christ we're enjoying what is here amen but there's more to come amen I believe there's more to come I want to be ready for what's coming amen I'm looking I'm looking at things like the debt and so forth they said under Reagan maybe s trillion or something like that I want it to pick that up 7 trillion under Reagan and then and on up to Clinton 13 and 20 and all up well brother bam in 65 said we were going to we're paying taxes on on 40 years ahead back then if you looked at back then I don't know if it was a trillion even it was in good shape compared today then I heard brother BR saying on the tape he says man we're going to run that debt up we're going to be busted somebody's going to pay it off and he says we're going to be indebted to him huh so me know there's a squeeze coming that's right that Financial squeeze don't you get your hopes on this world better keep your hopes on Christ amen amen I can't help it Wonder just how how many hard times that you and I going to actually face it before we get out of here you better be ready folks you better have that anchor down deep amen be very sure your Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock W amen and if you are a believer that has seen God bring you through every trial and through every test amen then your anchor already held how many knows it's going to hold cuz you are part of the you are are that word that he spoke of that's coming I will have a church without spot without wrinkle or any such thing how many believe you are a part of that I'm part of that so glad for for it oh my that's right his coming won't be so nice for them will it no it won't be a ni thing or Pleasant thing at all when he comes amen when he comes Bible talks about how that he is cut out of the mountains and he will grind the Nations to powder crush them to powder destroy them all when he comes amen and how many knows that'll be under the Sixth Seal under the six seal any of us that understand the seals know that that is a tribul period pride is gone at that time there all of need nature lets loose let's find out what happens and I beheld when he opened the six seal this is in six and verse 12 chapter 6 verse2 of Revelations and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair the moon became as blood the stars of Heaven fell upon the Earth my my my maybe we're going to have some asteroids and so forth coming and hitting the Earth be a scary thing won't it news channels all of them be up there talking about oh there's one coming our way everybody there's going to be fear and scare like you ain't never imagined we don't know just where it's it but get ready it's F maybe while they're still talking it'll hit and just annihilate them things like that it'll be scary day when he comes amen my the stars of Heaven fell upon the Earth even as a fake tree castes her untimely fakes when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll wow when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the Earth the Great Men the rich men the chief captains Mighty Men every Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains to the rocks and the mountain fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne can we say something the tribulation period sets in and they know the end is here and they didn't always it isn't them that's doing it they know it's God that's doing it they're going to become Believers they're going to become Believers that hey God is coming after our hide we're doomed and they go going into dance and caves do you think they'll want to be a judgment do you think they'll want to see him no they won't want to see him it's not not going to be a desirable for thing for them me a crown of righteousness and so forth and all those that love his appearing how many believe we love his appearing we love and we look forward to his coming brother Glenn when brother Brandon was here somebody said the believer said and the Chan said you know you're talking about Christ he's fixing the come you're here everybody he said well my goodness I think they opened their mouth and spoke a lot about themselves isn't that right pretty much old and hey I'm not ready that scared me I'm not ready to be him no the real Believers anticipate him you live every day looking for him you wake up in the morning have your cup of coffee say God is this the hour that you come and I'm waiting on you [Music] Lord when he comes it'll be a glorious thing for the believer there is no hope for this world outside of the coming of the Lord I mean Lees that's the only way of Escape that's the only out is the coming of the Lord can we say something all us message folks probably not near all going to go oh not all the message folks is going gonna be a lot of disappointments hello but I don't know about you and I don't know about you me I want to say God God help me and get me ready I don't care if I drawn as long as this isn't overdrawn amen I want this full I want this not half empty I want it full of Christ I don't want to miss it and I don't believe I will how many has seen God lead you in your life guide you amen and you believe that he has began a good work in you how many believes he's going to finish it brother Phil it ain't gonna be it ain't G be it's going to be finishing the work cuz his word cannot tell he can when I think about that that's right he started a work he's kept me through every Brier patch he's kept you through every Brier patch we've had a lot of Brier patch a lot of hard times lot of hard things that you went through we should all be sitting around I tell you what I don't think there's any Bel such a thing as a Christian you know I have could name his name died sorrowfully bad somebody that wasn't the message and he got to where he he said that wa from church and everything I don't care how many Hypocrites are in the church I don't care how many false people are around that doesn't do away with the real there's a real brothers there's a real sisters there's a real Church there's a real God there's a real Holy Ghost There's real Grace There's real Mercy There's real forgiveness unforgiveness only hurts you not the other person bitterness only hurts you not the other person anyway that's kind of off the subject but it's right on maybe but the Holy Ghost you love him isn't God great I trust you have a day I can take you to the time and I can take you to the place where he came to me showed me his Amazing Grace and I've never been the same amen changed and if you're a Christian even Paul says we are changed from glory to glory even Into His Image I don't care how long you have known him how he's come but he keeps coming to you and he keeps changing you every time you come to him how why do you think that when you come to church or you go worse you say well no I'm leaving the same no I beg to differ with you if you're leaving the same you're leaving worse right cuz that's just another time that you didn't get anything from God and you just got a little CER a little harder yet to not listen to the Holy Spirit that's exactly right be easier for you to try to think that you're de the next time but it'll just make you a little bit worse sorry can't leave the same just like the Rich Young Ruler when he came to him he should have been prepared huh the Rich Young Ruler should have been prepared when he came to Christ to count the cost I don't know if he was in that service or not but he said let him come the court unless you're willing to forsake father mother all for Mak not worthy no doubt maybe he had heard that maybe he didn't I don't know but when he came to him and he asked him for eternal life he wanted eternal life but I'm telling you what if it meant going to the Cross dying or whatever it meant he should have been willing to do it but he liked his riches just a little too much because he was a good boy he was better than most Christians he never broke any of those Commandments that's saying a lot it's saying a lot when you look Jesus in the fa and said not committed ad commments right and did Jesus one time say ah you're lying no he could have he said you're lying about this and you're lying about that you failed there but he kept all the Commandments but Jesus being God knew where his weakness was he knews where his hang was that's why he didn't ask like Z is and everybody else that give half of their riches to the poor did did somebody wrong they pay him seven times this that or the other Jesus said I want you to go and sell all the thast a l do you realize brother John that if he said 50% the man might have done it 25% whatever might he might have di said that sounds like a deal to me but when he said all it was just a little too much and Jesus revealed that in his heart he wasn't willing to forsake all you're not worthy of being my and he went away amen and he was never the same again praise the Lord my my my when Jesus comes amen the tempter power is broken for all is changed when Jesus comes to say let's sing that at end how many believes that all gets changed when Jesus comes zakus remember Jesus come to zakus and he was up in a tree you like the drama a that brother Bram gave of him up there trying to hide so that everybody could see him but he was still up there Jesus come walking right under it stopped come on you little squirrel get out of there like is come on now I'm coming to your house today I know you might be a little shamed or whatever it is but I know your heart come on down he come on down and went to his house how many be when Jesus comes to do it yeah he wants to stay at your house I'm glad that when he come for the fil he never leaves said I'll oh my I'm glad that he come listen all down through the word of God came to the prophets you know and and this that and the other all came the word but when the word comes he not only comes to them but it also comes to you comes to every heart Amen on praise the Lord he comes when he does he makes a change in this case with Lazarus he was dead four days wow I've heard said sometimes people are dying at the hospital bed and we'll make the statement well as long as there's life there's hope as long as there's life as long as they're breathing there's hope that's not right is it brother Phil that's just an incorrect statement I don't care if they've been for [Applause] hello how many believe it doesn't matter what your situation is or how bad it is the thing that you need is for Jesus to come for him to show up and do something and it'll all be changed praise the Lord amen let's talk a little bit about how privileged we are amen now before I read this before I give you the scripture away and you read it before I do how many knows in the Old Testament whenever well put it this way in the Old Testament God was with them with the disciples God was with them David when he killed Goliath God was with him Moses when he went down to Egypt to take over God fear not how many Joshua Joshua don't fear for I will be with you now God is with you you ain't got to be scared of nothing amen we are a priv people when Jesus comes amen you but I want to take you a little bit further than that in Chapter 14 verse 16 abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not needed knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you amen see the distinction he said he dwelleth with you and and or Comm and the conjunction that brother bam talked about he says and there's a conjunction and shall be in [Applause] you glory be with you as one thing in you is a whole different story amen and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more yet but ye shall but ye see me because I live ye shall live also my and at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye in me and I in you glory to God so when he comes folk when he come to you and when he come to me he didn't come to be with us he come to be in US Glory I thought about this while I was on vacation down there I thought you know we're such a privileged people because a lot of time Get Down On Our Knees we say oh God I there I need help with this I need help with that help me Lord and we're reaching way out there brother B said when Jesus prayed he prayed to the father that was in him so it's not way out there it's right here talk to him he's right here oh my think about it boy that is it's you realize that brother bam Christ mystery of God revealed talked about am me how did the mystery of it all according to the scriptures he said Christ in you is the mystery of Christ revealed the whole mystery of it is that God is in [Applause] you we try to f f God out there no God is right there he can hear you just [Music] fine your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words ever will why do you think that when you think about him he comes near like those that were Ro they were talking about him they had it caused him to come folks I'm here tell if we had our minds on God more we'd have more Revelation we'd have more goel what pouring down in if you had your mind on him but you're too busy with everything else we let the cares of this world suck the spiritual life out of until we look like those that were in the uh under Hitler's what is that the Holocaust thank you we're looking like Holocaust people huh dried up like brother B says somebody say well praise be to God and the lady in the back man sh send Shivers over somebody everybody turned their head like wow what's that all about huh dry up suck the life of Jesus Christ out of us we got to realize we got to come to realize that everything that you ever have need of is where in you right right here oh my aren't you glad you ain't got a Peter in that all the rock the ship was rocking it was W they took everything out they couldn't we was taking on water but he described he one more dip and we're going down one more see that water coming and we're no down they went back to the back Jesus wake up that we perish I I don't care what's your problem I don't care if you're r at the break of going down Jesus cares and he always shows up most of the time in the darkest hour how many know in The Darkest Hour most of the time that's when he shows up when you're in brings him on the scene that brings him on the scene our problem is that's most of the time when we begin to call upon him a that right but God is right there yeah I don't care what the condition is what your situation is most of us but for most of us probably it's a closer walk with God we could all raise our hand say I need a closer walk with God I'm not where I ought to be with God pration I'm not waiting for everything to break down I'm not waiting for health to break down the doctor tell me I need I got cancer no I'm not waiting on that God I need you more now father I want a relationship with you every single day walk with you talk with you have fellowship with you we can have that you can have that if you don't have that ask yourself why you don't have that what's robbing you of that time prayer amen meditation do you meditate upon to bed when you go to bed when you get up when you meditate on it enough amen my he comes he comes is it something brother bam in his hour talked about the churches and everybody had it in the Articles you know of how that we need a prophet we need a prophet we need God to come we need a Revival we need all this God sent it to him and they didn't even recognize it they didn't even see it when it happened is that what he said they failed to recognize it they're reaching up there somewhere amen and when it was right there I think that happens to us with us a lot of times we don't get what we desire or whatever we fail to recognize the presence of almighty God didn't brother preach message called recognizing the presence of almighty God when you Rec recognize the presence of almighty God whatever you have a bad day recognize his presence say this is just a little trial this is just a test God I know you this cuz I'm so glad when you go through I don't care what it is but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels how many believe he got a treasure you got the greatest treasure that ever could be ever could be had Trump with his billions of dollars could never spend every last time and get what you have more than any wealth of the world is the greatest treasure we have this treasure Paul said in Earth and vessels I like that that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us oh my brother Phil if you really want to go downhill as a preachers come up here and just say I I I you know I is not get a bunch of eyes huh the holy spirit will just back off you'll end up going boy that sure didn't work so good if you come up this way huh you went out that's not God was with me I would came home buing God God used me huh remember brother man said that one Theologian whatever he came up all self shirt and how y'all doing I'm a great somebody and I'm G to teach y'all really some good stuff Anda used a bunch of big words they were all like they just weren't getting it no just fell flat amen and he went back like that said if he to come up like he went he went like he came up Lord help us to die to oursel this is to an honor the glor is of him how many pow is of him he is worthy not you and I I don't care what message preacher is is you get a bunch of message pre Preachers think oh there a big shot this go down God don't put that up with nobody by God's grace brother random never did get up there did he he kept himself under the Damascus dust that's why God used him his whole life never claim to be some big shot big somebody very humbly if you would say it and it would be under the anointing to call himself even a prophet I'm not ashamed to call him a prophet he was a mighty Prophet one of the greatest prophets of all time God used him to finish it up hello like he used Noah to finish it up the first time God used brother brah to finish it up the last time amen the end end of the whole world as we know it a greater finishing up than ever Prophet ever was but not of us we are troubl on every side yet not distressed perplexed but not in despair ped but not persecuted persecuted but not forsaken amen cast down but not destroyed always bearing about the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body isn't that the har Cry of the Bride today God live through me let the to live through me let me be the light of the world let me have a smile on my face let me have the right atmosphere about me get all this darkness and the shadow of this down away from me when you come in your boat he's in the ship whatever need you have wherever you are just wake him up say Lord Jesus are you sleeping I'm calling you on the scene Lord come and do a mighty thing like you always do amen praise the Lord that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies amen amen praise the Lord you love him tonight amen ye are a god little children and have overcome how many glad to be part of the Overcomer group overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so how do you overcome these things how many knows it's not you but it's the one that's on the inside of you I really pity anybody that doesn't have the Lord Jesus Christ because guess what they're on their own they can only do as much as what they can do and that's it but when you come to your end you're by no means set your end you have resources you have somebody that you can call on and he can change your situation completely Oh my Jesus on the mainline call him on the phone is that right Jesus is call him up right just anytime that you need him all you got to do is call him up brother says when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost it's like a tree that's planted all you got to do it was water it just to have Christ on the inside oh Bo that brother B I heard that so often and so often I've said it so often and so often but I'm here to tell you it's never old to me it's never old never will be old Christ in us the hope of glory tribulation distress what's going to separate you if God is for you who could be against you if God is in you what do you got to be afraid of if you ain't got nothing to be afraid of what in the world are you so quiet to think that he's going to take care of every problem that ever comes your way nothing shall be impossible for you cuz he is on the boat that's why we make noise cuz he's in the ship he's on the boat he's in the control tower he's running the ship he's not my P my co-pilot he's my pilot I'm in the passenger seat riding along [Applause] he won't he won't do you like I did my wife tonight coming to church looking at the phone or something I don't know what it was for a second and I had to jerk over keep that little car from going off she got on to me a little bit and I laughed I I shouldn't have if that's wrong you know but anyway I said I understand you got upset because we about you know about wrecked or whatever you know not very nice huh I manyan know the Lord never r that to to keep the straight road amen the God is so good butam said in closing he says you know just in the darkest hour that's when Jesus comes he talks about look at the world that we're living in the darkest hour the darkest hour that's when he comes look at the Revival that's going on in a lot of the churches of the message I'm here to tell you brother Phil we could have all the Revival up here in the pop you want to but if it didn't happen out there it wouldn't go nowhere God has to move on the congregation he's got to move with all his people that's what makes the difference Glory tonight y'all was just singing songs and you heard y'all yeah y'all were clapping before the preacher ever comes out before any good word he spok you ready give it the Lord Praise Glory that's help you ought to come come ready and worshiping God e more of the Holy Ghost in This Darkest Hour as the devil is pressing on his children and on his people I seen where the popes Pope said that we're all God's children and somebody put on there false Doctrine call it false Doctrine now I thought that congratulations because that's exactly right he didn't read his Bible Jesus says you're of your father the devil huh there's the devil's children and there's go we're not all God's children no no you're welcome to homosexuals and everything else let me tell you something he's right in a certain aspect from his world and his God yeah yeah they all of them kind is that God's children the devil God but not almighty God Amen because that's who they're worshiping it's the devil no wonder he can take I was shocked that he would do that that he would actually bless and tell his Bishops to bless samex marriage and so forth huh wow that's a new one a new low for them but what do you expect right Presbyterian Methodist having homosexuals and all of that yeah all going to the one big unclean birge going into a cage of unclean amen but God doing something do you feel it do you feel it brother phille there's a move is going on God is finishing his work he's getting somebody ready for the Rapture and I'm not looking for something great spectacular something no I believe it's g to be so simple if you ain't careful you'll Overlook the thing a simple humble little lady watch under whatever some nobody Christian person just walking daily with the Lord and loving him all of a they go missing hello be gone oh the thought of it is coming he's coming soon in the Clouds Of Glory to take all his children home can I just dramatize one more before we go when the Rapture takes place we know that all of Paul's Saints will come up all of irenia group will come up Martin all of them all of them brother B like a parade they'll all come forth ain't that right brother Brandon's group will come up that's right he's seen millions that angel said those are your converts Millions isn't that right and then there'll be a few of us hello there'll be a bunch over there millions of going up when the Lord comes but there'll be just a few very very few butram said that'll see their loved ones I highly that all of us is going to see oh we all see all of our loved ones no I don't think so I hope so but maybe it' be one or two three or four I don't know but the actual those that actually see those loved ones amen and actually gets translated it's just going to be a few people I don't know who I don't know if we're all going to see it or not I I I don't correct that I hope we all do amen because I don't know I don'ts they'll come forth and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up changed in the atams so once again I want to close with this think about what God has done and is doing in your life because it's all wonderful brother Danny you got a testimonial I met God and I know God on a personal basis all of us no matter who it is B boy I tell you what I really believe he's got the Holy Ghost I believe the comes he'll come but what about you how many knows about what it it's a personal relationship you got to have that personally young people you got to have that personal walk with God he needs to be in you just like he is in the preacher your mom and dad whoever it is needs to be in you how many believes we need a daily walk with the Lord no we don't need to be on top of the mountain and this that and the other the next day all in the dumps in church one day and out the other and no no no a walk steady daily walk with God like Enoch walked and he pleased God and was not how many raise your hand say God help me I want to be pleasing to you preacher don't never have to cut preach on cutting hair he'll never have to wear tell you how to dress and how not to dress it's your Des desire I'll never see it cuz you'll dress right you'll do right you'll Act Right amen you'll love people you'll get along with people ain't that right why because you want to be pleasing to him and be ready when he comes amen amen I pray for every one of us yes I want us all to go I want us everyone to be there amen and how do I do that by telling you get yourself ready you be ready I can't do that only you can do that the bride makes herself ready ain't no parent can beat the Holy Ghost into a child can't legalize it into a holy ghost no you can just guide them teach them amen in the way that they should go God bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you'll come how many's glad to have the Holy Spirit on the inside have Christ there so that when whatever Rises up he can change that situation you don't have to call him oh God fill me with the Holy Ghost Oh Come From Out y somewhere and change no from right here Lord I'm giving it to you now change that situation for me touch me heal me whatever it might be amen cuz he's still in the business of coming when he is en lighted how many pleas I got on that a little while God and never me mentioned much of it but even when a guy like that Pharisee invited him to come he came amen how many believes that when you invite him to come he comes when you get up in the morning say God I want to commit this day to you Lord and guide me and Lead me every he'll come he always comes where he's invited to come amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we do realize father we're living in a very scary hour we're living in a Time father where we'll either be taken up or we'll be left here and we I feel the Holy Spirit burning in my heart with warning signs Lord Jesus with a sense of warning God that Lord Jesus we feel for those who are not going to be ready Lord Jesus our heart just goes out to those
