that they tried one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the eleven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ears and closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are more value than many sparrows but ye that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god and when they bring you into the synagogues and unto the magistrates and powers take ye no thought of how or what things you shall answer or what you shall say and the c and one and one of the companies said unto him master speak to my brother that he divideth the parents inheritance with me last one together and he said unto them take heed and beware of

this morning amen praise the lord it's another beautiful day amen that the lord has made we will be rejoice and be glad in it amen we just want to say uh we're glad to have brother tommy with us this morning brother tommy thompson amen brother earl you all remember about he said about three and a half years ago uh you know as we went up there around the madisonville area um erlington right i think i kept calling it arlington during the funeral it's not r it's an e i mean a it's an e so erlington up around madisonville i think he lives right about three miles from sister angie's so we've been talking the last couple of weeks and uh amen so he's been you know we've been fellowshipping and there may be somebody that wants to get baptized and so forth but so he come to visit us this morning and he's been talking to me about his experiences in brother branham's meeting so it's rare that you find anybody anymore that we're actually in brother branham's meetings amen and and i think he was right there behind brother wade when he died and amen got you know through the prophet raised that man back up and so he's got a lot of testimonies and so maybe sometime i told him maybe he could give a little testimony of a few things that happened but and so we'll just pray about that is that all right but anyway we want to welcome him and then his friend larry god bless you amen good to see you see you and have you with us jason and megan good to have you all this morning amen and praying everything works out for you amen amen that i know i'll tell you what i'll tell you we i can't over emphasize enough as a pastor i'll tell you i truly believe that as the hour is getting later and the world is getting darker it's important that you have a good church home him in somewhere where you go to church and get fed all the time amen because it's time to buckle up the armor as we see that day approaching amen we need to buckle it up and just get ready and so amen this morning it's i'll tell you this morning's message it's just something i uh i don't know why but i truly believe that the holy spirit is leading us in a direction uh towards his coming amen i believe his coming is real soon i believe it's real close at hand amen and i mean we're talking about something major unlike anything we've ever seen amen and so we want to dwell on that this morning and as i begin to study and pray just what the lord want to have me to say and the quotes and the scriptures that i want to read and so forth i know that with what we have here i just pray that the lord just help me to get out of the way that he can use me to say what needs to be said and may his presence come down anoint the words amen anoint every heart to receive the word how he believes that's how it works amen that we might go from here better people than what we've come because we do believe that god has sent a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ amen and so a minister has to be out of the way that god can use and we desire that god will just do that amen in a special way so amen i know it's simply tremendous amen and i don't know if i yes i'll just i'll just say it the way that the prophet described it he says you know the responsibility that god has given us in this day to bring this message amen that's something i i had this quote wrote down but i thought just you know this is the way i feel and i believe the prophet felt this way too as ministers and as i get older amen and i know my days are shortening up i feel the responsibility greater than i ever have felt to press it on we must do it we must get down to in and everywhere and go out and tell the message tell the people that jesus christ is coming amen felt it greater than ever back then how much more do you think it's important this morning amen and he's coming soon amen that's right and there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord and so that's what we're going to focus on amen you know as long as the lord wants but especially this morning on on beginning ready for the coming of the lord i believe it's time to be ready for his coming amen i truly believe that god has sent malachi 4 to dress and to get us ready for his coming amen let's bow our heads and pray father we come before you lord jesus once again this morning lord assembling ourselves together a solemn assembly lord jesus knowing god that this is what you have ordained father that we would assemble ourselves together and that we would open your word father and you would speak to our hearts we asked god this morning that you would help me lord jesus just to get out of the way even as your prophet did lord jesus you spoke through the spirit through him father the words that we have needed to hear father we ask god to do the same again for we know that you're not dead but you're alive and remain the same forever lord we ask god that you just bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon our hearts to speak on father about the tremendous and the great responsibility and the tremendous thought father of you coming lord jesus and how that you're going to have a church that's without spot without a wrinkle or any such thing that we would be holding without blemish at your common lord we just ask god that you'll just bless the reading of the word now as we open the bible and as we set our hearts and our minds completely on you lord and lord we erase and we shut out everything in every care of this world father and we want to ask god to help us to completely get shut in with you lord this morning and that you would speak to us lord jesus walk and talk with us along the way for we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen let's just go to matthew if you will the 25th chapter amen and i'm going to have to take my ink pen if i have one here i guess i don't amen but i'm gonna have to i mean if somebody got an ink pen amen i want to try to try to stay straight on this as i can amen thank you brother david praise the lord matthew 25 amen matthew 25. then shall the kingdom of heaven be enlightened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made amen knows we believe that truly we've heard the midnight cry we have made heard the midnight cry through malachi 4. behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and those 10 virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish virgins said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise ants are saying not so least there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh amen may god at this blessing said reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen you know this was a parable that jesus spoke and that he uh gave just after he gave the parable of the fig tree and he gave us the example as that it would be like it was in the days of noah that people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark amen you know there are so many different aspects of the coming of the lord one of them is we know that the prophet taught us that jesus's final ministry and the people that he preached to last was to the total lost amen he went down to the regions of the lost and preached to the souls that were in prison how many remember brother barron preaching a message called souls in prison now amen and he wondered even the prophet of god if you listen that he wondered whether he was preaching to the souls that were in prison even there that he was preaching to the total laws he says could it be friends could it be and think of how long ago that was amen but we realize that there will come a time and the scripture for is found in revelations amen all the way at the last chapter it talks about amen he says let him that's holy be holy still that's him that's unjust beyond just still let's him that's filthy be filthy still so there's coming a time when people are going to be what they are amen how many believes this morning amen now is the time to prepare amen one of these wouldn't it be something that if you got stuck right in the condition that you're in right now be a terrible thing amen if you're not completely in christ amen amen we're living in an age and our brothers and sisters when we look around and we see both in the political realm and in the whole world realm and especially especially in our own nation we see how that gross darkness that the prophet god talked about but it is getting darker and darker and darker amen and isaiah as you know in isaiah uh you know we find in isaiah 60 how it says there it says arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee i truly believe that the glory of the lord rose upon this generation it rose upon those who did hear the midnight cry and came out how many believes you got to come out god calls for people to come out go out to meet him what was we called out of we were called out of man-made denominations man-made systems because all that's all that most churches are they're man-made systems and then especially i mean you can look and you can look amongst the amish and the mennonite and some of them are allowed steel wheels on their tractors some of them can't have rubber tires and oh my there's so many different everybody's just putting their own interpretation to the word of god and the bible says come out of all of that and if we come out of that we come out of whether it's baptist methodist presbyterian he says come out of her my people how many beings we got there's a time there's a calling out that's taking place god is calling us out amen and what is he calling us out to do to meet him go ye out to meet him why that shows that he's outside he's out there somewhere amen praise the lord like i said there's a lot but i'm just going to try to follow the spirit the best i can is that okay after these things i saw an angel angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with his strong voice amen babylon the great is fallen and it's fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in the clay the cage of every unclean and hateful bird but a man says that's the churches brother why are you always talking about the churches well you always talk about churches brother brahm says the most lethal the most led deadly and the most deceiving thing upon the face of the earth is a church that's not right with god it's more lethal than anything you can know because look at all the people that goes there and they get taught false doctrine and are deceived amen just up here in town talk to my banker and they were going to have to take a vote on whether they're going to allow homosexuality preachers that's how bad and hateful and unclean it has gotten right go back and listen to what the problem said what he where he was going with it amen i believe it was in the invisible union of christ in the bride and he talked about how that a woman right a female woman had the devil used eve in that right to bring down the whole creation he brought death through eve eve is a type of the church he said and that church that gets out of his place is the most deceiving thing upon the face of the earth that's why it's so important about what church you go to because you're going to believe what they say isn't that right and you're either going to be saved through that or deceived by what is taught amen so that's why i always talk about this because you know and you didn't have to back in the 50s or the 60s when brother braham says that even pentecost is dead that they have went into the mark of the beast amen way back then you wouldn't have thought but guess what everything has taken its course it's running its course and it's showing how wicked and evil and unclean it really is amen in the world that we're living in we're seeing it especially in our politics how that amen the whole world even people amen that are you know out there even they are no they know that everything that is is being completely flipped around i read wednesday night i believe it was how that the devil's whole kingdom his whole ambition is to destroy god's kingdom the devil fights everything that's godly everything that's right he fights it and now we're at a place where everything that is right is called wrong amen and everything that is wrong is called right see that it shows how powerful the devil is getting and not only that but it'll get so bad and i was thinking about this how bad is god going to let this get how many knows it's going to get worse because in 57 but the bible says not there ain't no hope for america she's going to go down get down down down and every one of us have been involved in the political spectrum a lot of people have been involved in this people in the political spectrum i have been involved in the political spectrum because i truly believe that what we're seeing hello is the last of the good things going away and it grips us it affects us it affects a lot of message people to see the last of it going away and we're seeing that total darkness coming in like a flood amen it could get so so much until if you don't acknowledge and so forth and take part part of their evil they want to persecute you and they're right and not only will but look look at how bad sodom had gotten before god destroyed them when those men came down there those angels came down into sodom and man to get blood out and so forth remember that they almost beat lot's door down and they didn't want his daughters we want those men and we want to know those men that's how evil it has gotten amen so it's going to probably go a little further it's going to get even more evil because the sin of the amalekites and so forth that sin the cup of iniquity has to get completely full because god is going to get it let it get really really really wicked and i got to thinking of how that you know it is time you know and i believe for us as believers for the first place we knew that it wasn't going to turn around and i told my wife don't let that bother you don't think about that it's not supposed to get better no matter how much you think this might go by we could go this way we could get no no it's not supposed to get better there's nothing but judgment proclaimed upon our nation and this whole world not just this nation but upon the whole world this just comes to mind but is that okay amen there ain't no telling me amen it would just take a day or two for the stark market to crash and that great recession that the prophet of god talked about he says there are coming recession unlike you've ever seen amen everybody forfeit all of their rights just to have something to eat and then unless you belong to them and do what they want you to do you won't be able to buy or sell those scriptures could come into play so easily and it could happen any day amen so it's pl it's certainly time for everybody to get their eyes on jesus turn your eyes upon jesus look full upon his wonderful face amen and all the things of this earth will go strangely them as you look at the into the light of his glory and grace amen so we see this darkness there is darkness that's coming upon the earth it means it is so dark until it may grow starkness upon the people the course the direction that the world is going and the word direction that you're going is completely opposite how many beliefs even us as a church we as a group i mean it's important that every individual knows that hey i'm heading in a certain direction don't just sit at a place where i don't really know which direction amen you need to know which direction that you're going because the direction that we're going is not the flip make right wrong and wrong right we're like the prophet god says it's time to call black black and white white how many believe that it is time that we line up with this word 100 that's the direction that we want to go amen that we are going have been going and we'll go less of ourselves and more of him my message this morning is letting him live 20 21 letting him live amen all the songs went along with it amen that's right letting him live we're going to look with the help of the lord amen what is it going to take what's it going to take well don't we all want to know what it's going to take because we're talking about something here that the bible talked about jesus talked about brother bam says he spoke more of the second commentators first when he was going out of this world he began to talk more about his second coming and i believe that you and i are going to see that second coming two things are going to let me just say this again i've said it before two things is going to happen in your life you're either going to go in the rapture or you're going to get left behind you're going to stay right here and you're going to fulfill that prophecy the prophet of god made when he says you know their time will come when people will say well wasn't there supposed to be a rapture look how bad it is look at how it is wasn't that supposed to be a rapture and that voice will sound back he says it's already happened and you missed it amen two directions two places we're going to end up at we're going to end up in the body change moment in the twinkling of an eye or we're going to be left behind left behind what a terrible thought of being left behind how bad will it get how long will jesus let it go jesus let it go so bad he let it get so dark in the days of noah that out of the whole world only eight people were saved only eight jesus says when i come back to the earth will i even find any faith will i even find any faith and i think anybody of any of us knows that knows the message of this hour knows brother branham narrowed it way down to just a few amen few that make it that's why this morning that's why i tremble that's why i shaken myself god if it's just going to be few lord help me to be ready i want to be ready because i'm going to tell you right now you know as we go down into this and as we get closer to and when we come down to that place you remember one of these days it isn't going to matter that about how much money you make how many you've made or what you've done in this world it won't mean anything let's not wait until it becomes no good our money is no good anymore before we decide well what did i do for the kingdom of god what did i do for the lord how did i live for that's the only thing that matters isn't that right it's how that you live for the lord the only thing that matters amen praise the lord oh yeah so we want to look with the help of the lord we want to look and what it's going to take to be there because truly like i said i i want everybody here i want everybody i'm going to work on i'm going to try to make try to get get everything ever do all i don't want nobody's blood on my hands i want to do everything that i can i want to be right and i want every one of you to make me to make it also i know that's not in my hand but my job and what i am to do as a minister of the gospel amen is to try to bring us to perfection remember what i preached the other sunday and about perfection amen how that god requires it i mean how god it requires that token and he requires amen that we stand right and just before god and amen he says where can i take you to the branham tiger and here's as filthy and dirty as the rest of them are there's only one place that god will meet you only one place god will accept you and that is in christ jesus it's the only safe place amen all right that's right there is not one glimpse of hope of this world surviving no i mean it is going down let me say it this way this is what i thought of when i come up with now to come up with but i felt like when the lord laid this on my heart it's like there's this big boat perhaps like hawaii perhaps there's this big ship amen that is docked but guess what hawaii is beginning to rock hawaii is beginning to shake and every scientist says that it would be a matter of time that that whole island is going to go down and everybody's coming out of the mountains everybody's coming out everywhere because that boat is fixing to leave and anybody that's on the boat is the only one that's going to survive i call it the old gospel ship it's time to get on board get on board the world's going down and the only thing that's going to survive it is the lord jesus christ that's where you and i stand today we didn't get to experience world war ii we don't know what it's like to have all of that chaos and all of that all of that but listen you are going to experience the end of the world if you stay here you're going to know what the tribulation period is like if you're not ready the bible says be ready how many places it's time to get ready i believe it's more relevant now i see that we get ready praise the lord how many believes there's a countdown that's right god is counting it down amen through seven church ages count down amen we got four stages of getting ready one of them was justification how many thank god for justification luther came out and he believed that you got to be justified prophet god preached it and he made it so justified it's as though you've never done it in the first place god has to do a work we're justified and they were sanctified [Music] praise the lord oh my i thought that maybe we need to preach a message of wesley preach a little of wesley because people i want you to know something we got to be sanctified god has to have this heart clean without holiness see how you see god no man shall see god without holiness amen a holy person what'll they do they'll dress right they'll look right they won't wear any more clothes they'll do all of that but a person that's unholy a lot of times does the same thing it's not your dress that makes you holy you dress right because you are holy people can dress right and do all of that and still not be holy that's not the kind of sanctification i'm talking about i'm talking about the blood of jesus christ coming down in your heart and cleansing you from all sin god is not going to take you into into heaven all dirty and mired up in sin and unbelief not going to take it how many of us are going to bless oh my brings me to another scripture i've got a whole list of scriptures here that i want to first of all go through with you on those that aren't going to be there people that won't be there people that will be disappointed you want to take a little trip with me let's go to matthew let's go to matthew 8. i was thinking how that how many believes that the holy spirit causes you to search your soul it causes you to search yourself i believe in philippians before we read this one i'm going to read you this one paul says wherefore my beloved as he have always obeyed not as in my presence only is philippians 2 verse 12. but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen another place it says see if you be in the faith or not because i want you to know something i want to tell you something there's going to be billions and billions of christians so-called that deceive themselves and they're going to be disappointed on that day how many believes you as a christian that's not something i'm looking for i'm not looking for to come to that place and be disappointed i thought of that scripture where there was two uh that went to the uh temple to pray right and there was the pharisee or there was this one that said lord i thank you that you haven't made me like this man that i'm not a sinner and that i'm paying my arms and i do this and i do that and i thank you lord that you didn't make me like everybody else and then there was the other guy beating himself in the chest oh god forgive me all right and sinner huh lord forgive me and what did jesus say that guy's gonna get something right there he recognized how he was and i don't care how much of a christian you are look at all the times that even the prophet of god said forgive your unworthy servant unworthy servant and i believe that when you're a christian that holy spirit causes you to search your heart and realize hey when i look at myself and i say lord what am i doing i'm almost 60 years old what have i done for the lord look at the opportunities that i've missed to witness to people didn't say he says if you're not witnessing to people if you're not getting people to christ you have failed you have failed if you haven't bring bought people to christ amen and it makes you realize it makes you see your own fault and where you're not where you ought to be and it helps you to actually get closer to god you can humble yourself and realize because i'll tell you what when you really look at yourself you realize god i am really not worthy i don't know why you even have me preach lord but you know i don't feel worthy but this one i think i do lord is repent of my sin if i know i have any show me where i'm wrong lord i want to be right how many is with me this morning show me where i'm wrong lord i want to be right because this isn't going to matter about anybody else it's going to matter about you [Music] it isn't going to matter about your husband and it's not going to matter about your wife according to the bible one will be in the bed and one will be left and one will be taken your wife may not be going brother sister your husband may not be going hello it's important that you in your heart say god do i know without a shadow of a doubt that i'm living the way i don't live that i have what i'm supposed to have to make this rapture that was brother branham's entire goal that was his ambition was to get people not just the church but to get him to christ and to get you and i ready how many believes that to meet him he didn't point like this he pointed up he pointed us to christ amen first disappointment and i say this about deceiving themselves because even jesus said he said by their fruits you shall know them can i say this by your fruits you can know amen check your own tree see how the fruit's growing see how much love is there see if you have a passion for the lost see if you have a lot a passion for the lord see how much you love god see how much you love church then brother baby says if god is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open and to get in there and to worship the lord and to fellowship around the word of god and fellowship with your brothers and sisters that's the holy ghost it makes you reach out to others they said you can't hardly chain them doors shut you want to get in ah let me let me in that person's in love with god i mean i believe it takes sincerity it's going to take more sincerity for us and it's going to take more prayer and it's going to take a much greater dedication out of every last one of us in 2021. we're way down the road how many knows that every one of us we need a greater dedication and a more sincere walk with god we need to get our eyes more off the things of the world and more on a god and i've got a quote direct quote from the prophet says telling us that not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that lord lord haven't we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many mighty works these people cast out devils perhaps maybe all kinds of things happen but yet still didn't make it you know why i'll tell you why because they didn't look deep enough they didn't look deep enough because what did the lord say depart for me that work iniquity you still knew that you wasn't right in other places huh you knew there was places in your heart in your life that you wasn't right and you ignored those places those kind of people is going to be left outside amen i believe it's so searching time it's heart searching time listening to the prophet of god this week he say makes a statement with abraham that he took lot with him he took his dad with him right when god when god says leave your kindred leave your family leave every last one leave them all you and sarah y'all come out that's what i'm calling and he brought a bunch and we had all kinds of problems but the problem the point was not until he separated from those people that god had told him to separate did god ever fully bless him and brother man makes a statement he says know this know this that we will never you will ever be fully blessed until you fully obey what god said do you'll never be fully blessed until you do what god said do how many needs improvement huh i don't think any hand could hardly go up that stay down it's not to know that you are somewhere where you can do a little better than what you're doing that's not what saves you your works don't save you no but what you do when you have that desire it shows there's something down there and that you love the lord is that right shows he's done the work for you and what you do is in love and appreciation to him amen oh how we need to love the lord more the most greatest event ever is the rapture because how many knows that's also the resurrection god's been waiting for it for 6 000 years he's been waiting for that time the biggest thing that ever happened is going to happen you say well calvary was it calvary went and bought something all right calvary repaid for something i don't know about when you when i pay for something brother jeff i like to go get what i paid for i ain't fully happy until i get what i paid for how many likes to get what you pay for well that's when jesus comes for the purchased procession according to ephesians 1. rapture is when he comes and possesses that which has been purchased do you realize how long god's been waiting to be with you you know how long god has been waiting for those that brother brown seen in that other dimension millions of people that believe the message that god sent in this hour and all of those converts millions of them there they don't even see jesus they're under the altar because remember when brother bannon was translated 20 foot up there and he's seen all that and he says well i want to see my lord i want to see jesus he says you can't see him yet he's still a little higher and you'll have to wait because we're going when we get to see him we're all going to get to see him together how many believes that that's the truth amen and so the lord god has been waiting for this moment that lays ahead of us amen i'm gonna say like the prophet of god said and that is what's laying a hit for the unbeliever is a horrible thing that you could ever imagine and for the believer come on folks it's not just well it'll be pretty good no it's awesome it's going to be the greatest thing ever more than you can ever imagine lays ahead for the believer for those who love god the greatest time lays ahead the horriblest time lays ahead for the unbeliever but the greatest time lays ahead for the believer oh aren't you glad listen even jesus said the key thief he don't come but to kill to steal and destroy you know the devil is nothing but a perverter he perverts everything he's the one that perverted the original word to eve thou shalt not surely die he perverted he's an absolute pervert amen what do you think we used to call people that were of a different sex like that perverts because that's what they are they're perverts huh living in the world will get you shot for saying stuff like that yes you'll just have to shoot me because i'm gonna tell the truth you're not going to heaven god don't god don't sanction that he loves you but he don't love your sin he don't condone your sin and you'll never force that upon a believer either i would rather die than to be forced upon like without such a thing as that that's exactly what they're trying to force the devil's trying to force you're looking at the manifestation of the devil trying to force a market a beast and force people into evil it's an absolute truth that the devil is fighting the kingdom of heaven you know right all the way to the end and this is all about he doesn't the devil doesn't care about how much chaos the world is in do you think that the devil's going to take over and everything's everything's going to run smoothly after that he's got what no it's going to be total chaos because that's what the devil always brings his total chaos and ruins of nations the only thing he cares about is that people come to his side and go to hell with him that's what he wants he wants to take as many to hell with him as he can but he can't have you and he can't have me but it's time folks it's the time oh yes amen i believe the time has come don't you that we quit playing church that we get ready there can't be any put on it's got to be real what's down here has got to be real amen okay so maybe another scripture on this before we go into what it's going to take to be ready um let's go to matthew 13 i just feel the solemnness of the hour don't you i just feel like something could happen anytime i feel like it's the holy spirit for one thing in me calling out and it should be a rebound in every believer that it's time to be ready it's time to lay all foolishness aside how many believes that there's going to be outer darkness where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now we already know that that darkness and that outer darkness is right here what is this look at that completely dark out of darkness is when the bride goes up because somebody knows if there wasn't somebody that still needed salvation that still won that salvation why would god put up with it any longer until that last one that really desires it that's god's elected unless till that last one comes in god's not going to take the blood off the earth how many knows there's blood covering the earth but when that one comes in folks talk about shutting the door how many knows that that the door was shut in the days of noah the door was shut we're living in the hour when the door is gonna get shut amen and all those outside like i said all those outside they'll be in outer darkness there won't be any light whatsoever there'll be no mercy whatsoever i believe it was also the prophet of god in uh souls in prison now talk about how that he says look at the episcopalian look at the nomination look at how they're coming for that oil he says it's at that time it's too late that's one of the things made him wonder if it was too late because the bible says remember they come for it but they never get it they never get it look how far down the road you and i are way down the road some people believe that mercy was over around 1963. isn't that right some people thought hey there's no more mercy his brother bran was teaching the seals and so forth and he was talking about when he rises to take that book and to open it mercy's over into our mind we would have thought hey mercy was over but let me tell you some aren't you glad that they were wrong aren't you glad that the prophet came back and says don't you ever believe it's all over shall we stop preaching now don't you ever believe that you keep working until he says quit amen and here i am now right here i am got saved in 1980 something i believe god is still on the throne i believe there's still mercy and when he shuts the door it's going to be shut folks i know people who have went off in the false doctrine even in this message amen accept that there's no hope for this one or that or the other folks i'm very i'd be very careful about that god the only one that has a right to do that that's almighty god as long as you've got breath in your body amen and god doesn't hold you accountable and he does and amen uh lay blasphemy upon you isn't that right there's still mercy for you amen i believe our brother was talking talk about somebody he knew that amen was it your dad thought he would with no salvation for him maybe he'll testify sometime but you know brother ramsey you know it came along and hey don't think there's no hope for you when there's still hope for you but when god shuts the door we're living in the age when god is going to shut that door it's going to be over with there's going to be nothing but gross darkness upon the face of the earth and they'll be cast out into outer darkness and that's what i want to talk about look at those who will be cast out into outer one of them is an unprofitable servant how many knows brother bab says you know i wasn't there to hear him come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest i wasn't there to hear that but i want to be there when he says well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord if you could just get the world to know that what god said is gonna come to pass it can't fail then you could shake their head and you could actually get in the hey maybe it is real you know i you know it's true that's what we try to do this morning shake every one of us and make you realize hey it's coming it's coming it's coming he's coming like the prophet god says that's what we need to do let the world know jesus is coming he's coming back and he's coming back for people that are ready that have taken this message and dressed themselves not just talked about it not just say you believe it but man says that just means you can read it takes more than that all right before we get into that let's just go look at here where are we at it's matthew 6 no not 6 but 13. 36 jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field remember the one went out and sowed good seed and the other one out and sowed bad seed he and said unto them he had soweth the good seed is the son of man amen the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the terrors are the children of the wicked one people don't believe in seed they don't believe that the devil had a seed or that cain according to first john 3 12 not as cain who was a murderer the bible says not as cain who was of the wicked one that's where the lineage of satan seed came in through cain amen of the wicked one and no matter how much mercy god had for him god came down and not just talked to adam and eve but he came out to down to the serpent isn't that right and even to cain after he murdered his brother he says you know if you'll do what your brother does hey you'll be accepted [Applause] he walked away from it the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned into fire so shall it be at the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them that do iniquity i want you to know something that them that do iniquity are certainly bundling together and then he'll cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth but then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear amen let's go to another parable verse 47 a kingdom again the kingdom of heaven is like an antoinette that was cast into the sea and gathered every kind which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels and cast the bed away so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just do you realize that realistically speaking the righteous and the unrighteous there is a great golf fix between them anymore the golf is getting bigger and bigger and bigger folks i want you to know if i came up here and i condone some of that stuff that's going out there y'all kicked me out of here quite fast and i could say whatever why you know that that ain't right if you was to say certain things i know that you ain't right what is it there's a gulf the gulf is getting greater but guess what it's getting darker and darker and that's why it's so it's the time to shine the least little light shines brightly in the darkness that's what you and i are we're lights in the darkness okay so he says listen sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth how many knows there's a fire coming both the heavens and the earth shall be on fire it's going to be a furnace of fire that they get cast in malachi 4 said behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven in that right yea and all that do wickedly amen shall be ashes under the soles of your feet but malachi 4 i want to read that just right quick is that okay but it says it shall be stumbled in the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts malachi 4 1 and it shall leave them neither root nor branch but verse 5 says but behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord brother says whenever a sign whenever a prophet comes on the scene remember judgment is closed at hand one of the signs one of the sure signs that we know that the great and dreadful day of the lord is real close at hand it's because of the fact that he sent that prophet when that prophet comes on the scene lift up your heads fire's fixing to fall it's not far off i mean he believes that it's not far off but you and i aren't supposed to be here amen when that atomic bomb cracks oh blurb says one of these days people will run out in the streets and they'll see those streaks going here another street going over there another street going over there and they'll look and they'll say it's atomic bombs they're coming and it'll be all over with just a few times just a few minutes he's sitting in america completely burnt over completely broke everywhere amen that's what's going to happen if you stay you stay and you get burned in the furnace of fire they'll be weeping they'll be wailing and gnashing of teeth amen i'm gonna pass by this one here or just at least maybe quick comment in matthew 22 he talks about the wedding that was made and there was somebody in there that didn't have a wedding garment and he was cast into outer darkness there'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of thee amen if you don't have the robe that you're supposed to have don't expect to go in the rapture not your own righteousness not your own way not your own will amen but his righteousness what is his righteousness his righteousness is this he died on calvary for the sins of the whole world am i right and in that life and when he died it was a blood cell and a spirit that come from that blood cell that goes back on the believer i mean believes that and that is the very spirit of god when he accepts and he forgives you of your sins the holy spirit comes into your heart amen and that holy spirit is what makes you righteous not your own works the only thing that makes you righteous is the holy ghost and until he accepts you and gives you the holy ghost you have not been accepted you are still as filthy as filthy rags amen so the robe if you don't have the rope folks you're not going to be going you better have the robe on otherwise they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth amen oh my prophet god said we're going to be full of something in that right we're going to be full of something now i want to go for the next little bit and talk about the other side is that okay and i scared the liver out of you hey i'm here to tell you you need to get that in your heart hey you know if i'm getting left to that's what i'm that's what i you can expect you can expect your heart to drop you can expect to know that you didn't sure there's not going to be any spirit left are you there won't be nothing for you to live for you talk about suicide like you ain't never seen whenever that time comes people will be killing each other they'll be killing themselves by the millions because there's nothing to live for anymore amen you don't want to be left behind your entire focus your entire life believe in brother ben preach christ the mystery of god revealed how it's christ should be the very center of everything that you do everything you think your whole life christ should be the center of it all because there's nothing else to live for there's nothing else that's going to stand when it's all said and done amen so church get your your eyes on jesus and get ready praise the lord all right so those are people that won't be there people who deceived themselves they told themselves they were right when really they knew they weren't and you can look you can you can go on brother bam's message and you take a message and this bible that's how i check myself check yourself according to the word of god and the message that god sent to this generation amen and see if you line up with that see if that's your heart's desire amen because if it isn't anywhere in here if it isn't that's what we're here for this morning amen to work out our own salvation make sure you're saved the believer does that we're not scared that hey we got to do this saturday no we rely on the lord jesus christ but we want to make sure that we're right with the lord as believers you do that otherwise you may not care make believer unbeliever you don't care and people will deceive themselves and be totally disappointed on that day how many have you ever done that how many you ever take a good look at yourself did you like what you saw me neither but you better take a look at yourself and then you need to look at him because even the prophet says don't just look at yourself man you'll be a failure of total but you look at him and say lord jesus i accept your righteousness lord cha change me from what i am how many knows you're going to have to do some changing this year every one of us is going to have to make some changes changes brother batman make a statement after you told us about beyond the curtain of time brother bam says that's what bothers me though to preach to you people don't remain on the same condition that you've been going in amen think about it but about a preaching preaching preaching preaching people wouldn't change he says look you've got to change something's got to change here amen we've got to change oh my praise the lord god has to come down and do a change in our life now after how many knows that after brother ben preached all the revelation of the seven seals huh then he preached desperation the token leadership and so forth when he came to the token what did he say this is the most relevant up-to-date most important message up to now the token that's what i want to talk about for a few minutes the token he went back to israel when they put the their the death angel was coming into the land in that right and all the firstborn was going to get skilled and he says put slay the lamb take the blood put it on the lenthil of the door and the lentil is the top and on the post and man smear it on there and put it on the top because anybody that isn't behind that will die i don't care how much israel you are i don't care how much of promise you have i don't care what my deal is with you it's all null and void if you don't do this the prophet god comes along and that's us amen and paul was the same way paul in 1st corinthians 13 talk he says you know though i can understand all mysteries don't you understand all the mysteries though you have faith to move mountains and brother bam in the token says you mean i can do all this and still be lost that's exactly right you can have faith to move mountains cast out devils and all these other things but you still ain't got what it takes you better have the love of god in your heart isn't that right but do i have not charity do i give my body to be burnt but if i ain't got this i'm still zero when he preached that token he says you know it doesn't matter how good you are how much faithful you are in church on how you dress what good deeds you've done how much missionary how much preacher you are he said you could be a preacher in this pulpit hello but then you come up here and say well the holy ghost was just for the twelve huh you can be a preacher but yet if you don't feel i believe that full word remember it's going to do you no good amen that's right now notice one thing that he said about i want to just make a couple points on here if i would if you don't mind one of them was it was required that they apply the token isn't that right and number two was that the token token is displayed in public now let me just talk about john 3 nicodemus came to jesus by night isn't that right and he says uh what must i be do right and jesus says you must be born again you must be born again he didn't know for sure what to do and he says i come to i go back in my mother's womb no he says unless a man is born of water and of spirit he will in no wise enter into the kingdom somebody knows without that token without the holy ghost you're not going not going without the holy ghost and number two the second part of it is the way the the token is a positive identification that the lamb has been killed so in other words jesus on calvary and you believing in jesus and saying you believe the only thing that tells you positive that the lamb died for you is when god baptizes you with the holy ghost the holy ghost is a positive token he says that the lamb has died because how many numbers it don't matter how much he died a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon amen and if you haven't got the holy ghost god has never accepted your sacrifice yet come on folks preach with me amen when you get the holy ghost only when you get the holy ghost that is your sign that hey that is for me he died for me you can say you believe all you want to you can say your message believe it all you want to you can say you believe the message all you want to not gonna do you any good unless token comes down and verifies that you believe amen so notice the holy ghost is a positive token that your land died and that you received the token upon yourself for his very life is in you there's no make believe there's no put on huh no impersonation of it oh may god help me both present and into tape to pin that down that no matter you might have preached the gospel you might have cast out devils you might have spoke with tongues you might have shouted you better dance in the spirit but without that token huh say i can do it yes that's exactly right paul said you could you can even speak in tongues and interpreting tongues though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am nothing don't you rely upon that amen it's the token no matter how much you've done how good you are the wrath of god still is going to go right over top and get you only thing that's going to be recognized is the token it is a token that the price has been paid that's been required the price that was paid for was the life of jesus christ he gave his life and his spirit comes back upon you as a token that you have received then you carry that token with you on wednesday night and sunday night and whenever you get around people that you think you ought to pack right around don't sound right does it no not just on sunday it's all the time you have the token oh my you say well i'm uh you say i still believe i am a believer that's all right but if you reject that token let me tell you something that's his service today unless the token is in the on the door there is a spiritual death gonna strike hello there's a spiritual death that's gonna strike amen if you don't get that token put on your door all churches are headed back to it to the world council of churches they're going back to catholicism let me know we've got another catholic president now catholicism when we had the first one you know what brother baum said that makes us a catholic nation amen oh my listen and only those who are genuine born again are going to stay out remember you pentecostal denominations because they're already in it shows they are dead they're perished they went back they put him outside the door pentecost put put jesus outside of their door revelation 3 behold i stand at the door and knock he was put outside the church jesus would come down and tell you what your problem was where you come from over and over and over again and it says don't you go to the brother band's meeting see it's fortune telling he put him out it wasn't brother playing them telling you that was jesus telling them who they were and what they were it was a sign of the messiah he's looking for the token because the only thing that they relied on was tongues don't you rely on speaking in tongues or nothing else but let the token itself be there the person of jesus christ letting jesus live in 2021 how many believes that we need to let jesus live i'm going to finish just here in a second but i want to look at what paul said it's got to be biblical right paul said in philippians maybe it was galatians galatians 2 i believe it was paul said 2 and 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but it's christ that liveth in me and we believe that's 20 21 for us i'm alive but guess what it's not me living my life it's christ living out through me greatest battle ever fought says the devil really doesn't have any strength or power unless he has somebody to work through how about god how many knows that we're god's temple know ye not that you are the temple of the holy ghost you are god's temple the only jesus people's going to see is when they look at you your reaction and action to whatever it is it's the only thing that's accepted but christ liveth in me and the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who gave he loved me and gave himself for me praise the lord listen don't rely on just speaking in tongues no the token has to be there the person of jesus christ the faith of jesus christ not just this that but circumcise your whole baby what is it brother ma'am says that causes people to be halfway christians and lukewarm it's because their own ways get mixed up into it let me tell you something i believe every one of us is growing into the full stature of christ into the fullness of christ that means until god governs to every part of you who's with me lord i want you to govern every part of me every part of my life i want you to have supreme control god could have brought us to the earth and have us to fulfill his perfect will do the right thing every time but we were born completely wrong the carnal mind is enmity against god we have to learn to surrender ourself to his will how do you think we're ever gonna get along with god up there you're gonna are you gonna go up there and say now god i think you ought to do this you ought to do that i don't think this is a good idea and i don't think that was a good idea no god doesn't want to argue with you huh lord whatever you want lord i want to do thy will as a song so i want to do thy will take me mold me make me break me lord but i want to do your will because jesus says only those that do my will will enter in not your will not your way how many knows this isn't the hour this is the time amen that you must be born again by the baptism we got to completely die to our own thinking into our own ways more now than ever come on folks i don't need to hear an amen from you that ain't nothing are you going are you going with me then you're going to have to die to your own thinking you're going to have to die to your own ways you're going to have to die you're going to have to be crucified to yourself and to the way that you want to think that's not what heaven is going to be full of it's a bunch of people that want to do it their way that's why we got the chaos that we do that's why we don't have brotherhood like we do that's why every church goes their own way because they don't come subject to what god said let me tell you something one thing that this mess this does you see you gotta forget what the army's taught you you gotta forget what your denominational brothers and sisters do everybody else told you encounter what god said and prove and vindicate it that's what you gotta come to that's what god's coming for somebody to set aside their own ways their own thoughts their own lives and let christ live that's let christ live he wants to live he wants to bring joy unspeakable he wants to take the gloom out of your life he wants to bring peace in your life amen satan come to destroy but i came to give life and that more abundantly i believes he's here to give you life more abundantly joy unspeakable it doesn't matter how chaotic how ugly how sinful how wicked the world gets or what they're trying to pressure you into you are sealed and with god take my head off but don't take christ from me and then paul said for you to live his christ to die is gain because i know what's right on the other side amen you loving this morning that's what it's going to take if you're going to be in the rapture a complete death to yourself and just christ to be living his life out through you that's the token the only thing that he's coming for amen praise the lord how many believes it's time to become the message not to say you believe the message same with the bible don't just say i believe the bible it's time to become the bible brother baby says don't just say comes this far and say well i believe the message you obey the message come into christ you see i believe every word you said brother madam that's good but that's just being able to read oh i believe every word you say hey has that belief that you say you had has it brought the holy ghost in your heart because i guarantee you if you believe the word the word of god he will fill you with the holy ghost amen that's the only thing he's not going to ask if you did you believe huh the bible says the devils believe and tremble they know it they believe it they believe it a whole lot more than people do huh it's when the holy ghost comes in i mean it's time to have possession of the holy spirit take the message take it into your heart you must have the token the very life that was in christ being you when i see that i will pass over you and sweep you up and take you home oh my there we all are everything is pointed up exactly the truth i have not lied to you i have told you the truth and god has testified that i've told you the truth but many miracles and signs that he did amen and not just that but everything the prophet taught was absolutely scriptural by one handshake by one signing your name on a book are we all baptized into a church no you come into this church by one spirit first corinthians are we all baptized into one body and members in particular amen now remember i'm your brother i'm a man i'm just a man just like y'all but somebody's got to bring it somebody's got to say it he says that wasn't my voice it was his choice i've told you the truth and he's testified it right back to be the truth when we see these things upon the earth today oh people this is the last hour get that token over you quickly as you can oh my get in that token get in the token and we see the great end sign of the time at hand warning us time is at hand take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't never speak evil against another one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for them right quick we are together in this with god be brothers and sisters live godly live like daughters of god live like sons of god live sweet kind and humble let no evil come in your mind and in your thinking just dismiss it it knocks on the door take it away amen show your token and keep walking and say i'm under the blood amen brothers and sisters don't remain in the same condition he says listen i've seen tens of thousands of visions signs and wonders and none of them have ever failed oh my how many knows if it's god it's not going to fail if you can conjure it up oh it's going to fail but if god spoke through the prophet it was god speaking it couldn't fail i don't know why i want to keep saying this but i'm going to say it again and i may not get it exactly right but this is the the surrounding of it brother branham called a woman out one time and he told her the number of her address where she was at where she had where she lived at and after the service a sister come up and said sister he told you wrong about your address you got your address wrong this is you know i moved just the other day that address is correct oh and that's just one of thousands thousands of things things like that amen that's happened that god would come let me tell you something what god has done in this generation oh my the books couldn't hold it all the things that's happened is that right all the things that's happened what god did and what he did and so forth and it'll bring on the destruction of the world because people will not believe what god did to disbelieve what god has done hey if i do something you just believe it that you ain't going to go to hell for that at all when you disbelieve what god does that's a whole different story that's why this world is going the way that it is i was listening to first and second samuel the other day and i remember and they went through the place where uh they wanted a king over them you know because god would speak to samuel right and he'd tell them where to fight how to fight and what to do and so forth in that right and god was their king samuel was their prophet but they didn't want it that way that's the way god had ordained it to be amen that's how it was supposed to operate but they wanted the king and god says go ahead and give them one they've not rejected you but they rejected me and i believe that's the way it ought to have been in our world when god sent brother branham we wouldn't have to worry about russia china or anybody if we dismissed our president huh and said this is the guy that's going to run things we've been in good shape isn't that right if the whole nation would have been like solomon the queen of the south came all the way from the other most parts of here the wisdom of solomon isn't that right that's who should have been the leader god's prophet that's how god meant for it to be amen and the same way today the churches the ones that claim to love the lord rejected and crucified this word and what christ did in this generation that's why it's going down but there's a group of people how many please you're a part of that group of people that say god that's what i want i want to i want to do whatever you want me to do lord let me say this in closing he mentions you know the one thing that we got to have and we know that love is corrective am i right it takes a lot of courage sometimes just like it did with john the baptist when he uh told that that king he says it ain't right for you to have her you know right preach marriage divorce and it cost him his head and one thing christians will do is stand up for what's truth stand for what's right isn't that right love is corrective that's why he jesus said in revelations the third chapter as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent because we certainly need i don't know about you but i need more rebuking lord you're not thomas you're not doing as much as what you should you're not praying like you ought to you need to be more sincere amen okay i'm gonna finish this over here you should love one another first up here death is in the land today judgment is waiting she's pending amen how many has ever had a sale pending this sale is pending it's just kind of waiting there the judgment and the wrath of god is just waiting isn't it something how that god was so patient in the days of noah he didn't want anybody to be lost he let it go on and on and on and on until guess what he says i better take somebody right nobody gonna be saved and eight of them made it out of it he said that about that are they he's going to be very patient but he's going to have to come and catch us away or there will be no flesh saved will i even find anybody with faith on the earth judgment is waiting she's pending atomic hydrants hydrogens and all kinds of disasters is waiting for the nations all the nations and god is moving his church i mean he believes that and now the tokens got to be applied oh my except the man be born of the spirit and of water he will in no wise enter in you should love one another believers should separate themselves from the world don't be afraid to be different in the world you we don't oh my i when i got the lord to begin to pour this out on on me i said boy i'll tell you what right i we just don't fit in more and more and more we don't fit in here how many is ready to go let me say lord even so lord come and then people that's listening to this tape women men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe me now quit fussing with one another believe the message of the bible believe jesus christ love and honor and respect one another i mean is that something that's totally gone men respect your wives respect your homes bring your homes together and so forth notice we are not just to come together to talk about the message they are to come together to apply the blood apply the token that's what you must do pastor neville i'll put my name brother byler the congregation trustee deacon you brother and it's time to lay aside all the foolishness of the world i mean it's time to get more sincere time to lay aside everything else we've seen enough now we're positive sure that the token must be applied without it you're going to perish you must perish that is the only thing oh don't just come together and say i believe it get beneath it get into it for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body praise the lord i've seen tenth of thousands of visions signs and wonders none of them ever failed he's foretold me things it's and it's never failed to happen exactly that way i'll bring any man to trial for that that's right but you listen to me thus saith the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter how many religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done whatever you've done how many knows that the holy spirit god is love if you don't have the love of god in your heart like you should this morning i believe when we have the altar call and when we raise our hands say god i don't have enough love that i should have i mean at least you should have we all could use more of the love of god whatever you've done it won't count for nothing it'll take perfect love so whatever you do lays out everything else until you're just so filled with the love of god till you can love those he said who hates you but i'm going to put it this way until people can false accuse you lie about you and actually have you killed and just before they kill you you don't oh you know what it ain't right they're not just before they kill you you have so much love in your heart you can say god don't lay this to their charge forgive them for they don't know what to do that's what jesus did when they stoned stephen when jesus told when stephen told them the truth and preached them says you always resist the holy ghost you know and so forth and they got so mad at him dude stoned him and just before dying he says forgive them why he had that perfect love that no matter what anybody else did they were so in love with god they could love everybody even their worst enemy how many wants to be that way god bless you stand with me tonight this morning musicians if you come let everybody bow their heads and for the next few moments of everything that we've heard now is the time for us to be serious for you to search your heart ask yourself of all that has been said how much did the spirit speak to your heart maybe it didn't mean a thing then this probably won't be a lot of good but if in your heart the word somewhere something that's been said touched you said that's right that's right that's me i need to repent here i need to make this right i need to change here if you had the holy spirit speaking to you this morning then how about as with you have a bow head very sincere say god i have a need i want to be ready for your coming lord i believe i'm your child father i raise my hand and say god i'm guilty i'm not what i ought to be lord but i want to change i don't want to stay in the same condition that i've been going i want you to come and change my heart oh god make it ever new lord give me so much love for my heart god until i won't have animosity against anybody no matter what anybody would ever do god i would never hold any grudge because of the peace of god that's in my heart [Music] is there anybody here

life and my heart father i want you to show me where i'm wrong god i don't want to get over there and be deceived and be disappointed i want to have men know that i have searched my heart that the
