[45:28] um
[45:28] see here
[45:31] the cliastes chapter three
[45:49] to everything there is a season and a
[45:54] time to every purpose under the the
[45:57] heaven
[45:58] a time to be born
[46:01] and a time to die a time to plant in a
[46:05] time to pluck up that which is planted
[46:08] A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time
[46:12] to break down and a time to build up
[46:14] a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[46:17] time to mourn and a time to dance a time
[46:22] to Cast Away stones in a time to gather
[46:24] stones to together a time to embrace in
[46:28] a time to refrain from embracing a time
[46:31] to get in a time to lose a time to keep
[46:35] and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend
[46:38] and a time to sow a time to keep silence
[46:42] in a time to speak a time to love and a
[46:46] time to hate a time a a time of war in a
[46:51] time of peace
[46:53] what profit hath he that worketh in that
[46:56] wherein he labereth
[46:59] I have seen the travail which God hath
[47:01] given to the sons of men to be
[47:03] exercising him he hath made everything
[47:06] beautiful in his time also he hath set
[47:10] the world in the heart so that no man
[47:13] can find uh the the work that God maketh
[47:17] from the beginning to the end I know
[47:19] that there is no good in them but but
[47:22] for a man to rejoice and to do good in
[47:24] his life
[47:26] and also that every man should eat and
[47:28] drink and enjoy the good of all his
[47:31] labor it is the gift of God
[47:35] amen may God that is blessing to the
[47:38] ring the word you can be seated
[47:45] now the the title of the the service
[47:47] tonight is purpose it's just simply
[47:50] purpose that that's the the very the
[47:53] very title just such a simple title
[47:57] just purpose because I believe that that
[48:01] is that is simply the the Simplicity of
[48:06] of life is that one word purpose and and
[48:12] I believe everything that God has
[48:14] created he created it for a purpose
[48:19] now now even even uh
[48:22] the animals the the
[48:26] the
[48:27] elephants the the lions that everything
[48:31] that God created from the from trees
[48:33] trees create oxygen for us to breathe
[48:36] for us to live
[48:38] and the oceans the water so that at all
[48:41] life can and live
[48:43] all of these things have purpose from
[48:46] the food chain of animals because if if
[48:49] one of them wasn't there
[48:51] then the whole thing might collapse God
[48:53] made it so perfect that
[48:56] that everything works together in in the
[48:59] way that it goes and so
[49:02] and so
[49:04] um if all these things have a purpose
[49:07] how much more do us being made in the
[49:10] image of God being
[49:12] children of God Sons and Daughters of
[49:16] God how much more of a purpose has God
[49:18] given us as as those other things that
[49:21] that aren't as important not see me not
[49:25] as important as what God has made and
[49:28] God knew what he was doing when he made
[49:30] us
[49:31] for a greater purpose than all of those
[49:34] things
[49:36] foreign
[49:42] I heard this one time
[49:46] and it really hit me met men without
[49:48] purpose or men and women without purpose
[49:52] distract themselves with pleasure that's
[49:55] that is that's so true because if we we
[49:57] don't have a calling we don't have a
[49:58] purpose we don't know what in the world
[50:00] we're doing where we're headed
[50:03] then and we get to the place where we
[50:06] feel like we're we're nothing we just
[50:09] want to find something for Comfort some
[50:12] kind of distraction because we every
[50:14] human being everything has to have a
[50:16] purpose and a goal and and that purpose
[50:20] I'll get to to that in a little bit but
[50:24] here what
[50:26] um brother Brandon said
[50:29] he has a purpose in your life each
[50:32] individual that no that no one else on
[50:35] the face of the Earth can take your
[50:38] place God has got something for you
[50:41] you're you're made like that
[50:44] that you you was did that way for a
[50:48] purpose God is Sovereign in his work and
[50:51] he even in things different we different
[50:54] one from another we notice in the animal
[50:57] life we find out in the animal life
[50:58] there's one animal God made a beast of a
[51:01] burden like like the horse and he he has
[51:05] to work and the cow is a sacrifice
[51:08] and but the the lion the tiger runs a
[51:11] force without any labor or anything he
[51:13] made a great big animal like an elephant
[51:16] and then and made a little bitty it felt
[51:18] like a mouse
[51:20] now who is there to tell God what to do
[51:23] and how to do it he does it in his own
[51:25] way and and he makes the mountains he
[51:28] makes the deserts he makes disease he
[51:31] makes the planes he he makes one kind of
[51:35] tree hardwood palm and so forth he does
[51:39] it he makes men different he makes us
[51:42] each one a different place and a palm
[51:46] tree can never
[51:48] can never be a hickory a hickory tree
[51:51] can never be a palm nobody can take your
[51:54] place and you you shouldn't try to take
[51:56] anybody else's place because you are an
[51:59] individual to God and God has a purpose
[52:01] for you he made you thus you say why did
[52:05] he do it he is Sovereign he's got a
[52:07] reason for it being that way
[52:10] that that's exactly right right and and
[52:14] for I think for everyone for we always
[52:17] look at uh someone as as in like you see
[52:22] other people doing all these great
[52:24] things and we think
[52:25] I would love to do all that anything uh
[52:29] can I I somehow uh do that and sometimes
[52:32] we get to a place where we're trying to
[52:35] um trying so hard to get to some place
[52:38] and and and work our way way up to that
[52:42] that place
[52:43] the ace where it and when it's not even
[52:46] our calling in
[52:48] and I've I've had dreams in in different
[52:51] things when I was younger like I want to
[52:54] be a soccer player that that was about
[52:57] my my brother's or his idea as well
[53:00] we're gonna be a professional soccer
[53:03] players when they grow up we're we're
[53:05] gonna be and then I start thinking well
[53:07] maybe there's some way after realizing
[53:10] that that we should have something
[53:13] um to glorify God and maybe I could be
[53:15] this great big soccer player and then
[53:16] glorify God in that
[53:18] well well you know that that's the thing
[53:21] trying to find something and and then uh
[53:24] squeeze in your own little ideas well I
[53:26] can do it this way in my own way and and
[53:29] then we we start trying to do trying to
[53:31] glorify a God in a way the a that he
[53:35] doesn't want us to do it he has a
[53:36] specific way for us to specifically for
[53:40] us and on a personal level instead of of
[53:44] our own ideas and our own way of wanting
[53:47] to do things which us as human beings we
[53:50] always try to do something
[53:52] in in our way rather than God's way
[53:54] sometimes even if it is to glorify God
[53:56] and and that is that is true
[54:02] and
[54:04] let's see here
[54:10] God has a time and reason for for that
[54:13] time to fulfill all his words God knows
[54:17] just exactly what he's going to do we
[54:20] don't we just have to receive it as he
[54:22] gives it to us but he knows and there's
[54:25] nothing going and to go wrong with with
[54:28] that he he has a has plan to do it's all
[54:34] it all has to come about there has to be
[54:38] sometimes rugged and hard things to only
[54:42] bring out the real and true nature of
[54:45] that object
[54:47] and it
[54:49] most of the time it's if it's a well
[54:52] every time if it's if it's a calling
[54:55] it's not always easy and I I realize
[54:58] that it's not always easy some people
[55:01] think well if you it's something you're
[55:03] passionate about and it's a calling that
[55:05] you have you'll every single morning
[55:07] you're going to be happy to hear that
[55:08] alarm clock get up and you're going to
[55:10] be all all joyful about all the time and
[55:12] you're just gonna get to work and it's
[55:14] gonna be all cupcakes and rainbows and
[55:16] easy because you love doing it
[55:19] well someone put it like this well it
[55:23] might might be something that you're
[55:25] passionate about but you're always going
[55:27] to have struggles and you're always just
[55:29] as in in um
[55:32] I'll put it this way put in a different
[55:34] way but I'll put it this way it's in
[55:36] like you love to get to go
[55:39] this is a very hypothetical thing you
[55:42] love to go sledding let's say during
[55:44] during it it's it's like
[55:46] um there's lots notes how you love to go
[55:48] sledding you have to actually go up the
[55:50] hill and it's hard to go up the hill
[55:52] sometimes it depending on how steep that
[55:54] Hill is and get up the hill in order for
[55:56] you to slide down on the hill so it'll
[55:58] be hard to get to that place sometimes
[56:01] but
[56:02] it'll be something that that
[56:06] it will be something a calling is
[56:09] something that you will be passionate
[56:11] about
[56:12] you know even though it's not always
[56:14] easy
[56:16] you know rain is born in a jagged ragged
[56:21] lightning strobe thundering skies and if
[56:25] we didn't have rain we wouldn't live but
[56:28] you see what it takes to bring rain
[56:31] thunder lightning flashing anger and out
[56:35] of there comes rain
[56:37] a seed Must Die rot corrupt smell and go
[56:41] back to the dust of the Earth in order
[56:43] to bring forth New Life
[56:46] it takes the pounding of gold turned
[56:50] over and over back and forth and pounded
[56:53] until all the the dross is taken out of
[56:56] it
[56:57] not because it shines because iron
[56:59] pyrite what is known as full US Gold
[57:02] shines like real gold but you you put
[57:06] the two together and you set them one
[57:09] and you set them out to one side and you
[57:12] can hardly tell them apart
[57:14] but put them together and you you can
[57:16] tell it and the beater always has to
[57:19] beat till he sees his own image
[57:22] reflecting in the gold
[57:25] and God sets a time and a purpose for
[57:28] everything that he does there is nothing
[57:31] happening just accidentally to those
[57:33] that love the Lord and are called
[57:35] according to his calling see we are
[57:38] predestinated and everything works just
[57:41] right for that because he cannot lie he
[57:44] said that that was so and everything has
[57:48] its time its season and it has its way
[57:51] and God is behind every move and and
[57:54] sometimes you think that everything is
[57:56] going wrong it's up to us those things
[57:59] are put Upon Us trials wonderings it's
[58:02] testing to see how we will react on an
[58:06] action
[58:09] amen
[58:10] um
[58:12] um the other day was a couple of weeks
[58:14] back I guess
[58:16] uh we're having a conversation at the at
[58:20] the barbershop it was a pretty a uh
[58:22] typical
[58:24] um Barbershop getting to know you kind
[58:26] of conversation and he he I was telling
[58:28] him about uh I'm gonna be I believe I'm
[58:32] going to be successful and I'm building
[58:33] this business this online business with
[58:35] my brother and stuff and and he was he
[58:38] was kind of giving me this lecture and
[58:40] he was telling me
[58:41] well are you passionate about bread
[58:44] boxes
[58:45] no not really I mean who is are you
[58:49] passionate about uh
[58:52] are you passionate about selling on
[58:54] Amazon well no not really and and he
[58:58] said well you know it's it's good to to
[59:02] get a job to get something that you want
[59:04] to want to do and make a living and and
[59:07] all that
[59:08] but he asked me what is your calling
[59:12] though
[59:13] and and and I said well I believe I'm
[59:16] called to be a preacher and he said
[59:19] why well why are you putting all your
[59:22] energy in trying to build this online
[59:25] business why are you putting all of your
[59:26] energy in doing this
[59:29] when and he said he said stop stop
[59:33] trying to be so focused on on how you're
[59:36] going to make money and start trying to
[59:39] focus on start focusing on on what your
[59:44] calling is and not calling will bring
[59:46] forth and you'll be blessed in that
[59:48] calling I thought wow that that's that
[59:51] really hit me yes
[59:54] he's exactly right
[59:56] focus on and I realized I I need to
[1:00:00] focus on my calling first on on what God
[1:00:03] has called me to do first before
[1:00:05] anything else before business before all
[1:00:08] these other things
[1:00:10] and and this is a barber he's not even
[1:00:13] much of a Christian either and he's
[1:00:15] telling me this
[1:00:17] and I thought wow you know uh he's
[1:00:20] exactly right
[1:00:24] but but he was also going on about uh
[1:00:29] telling me that that bread boxes are
[1:00:31] never going to sell so
[1:00:34] I thought you'd be surprised I mean you
[1:00:37] see a like there's a hundred thousand
[1:00:39] and searches at Bread Box a year a month
[1:00:43] on on Amazon but he was saying nah
[1:00:47] and nobody wake up in the morning it's
[1:00:50] like I think I'm gonna buy a bread box
[1:00:52] no
[1:00:55] I I told him well but we're a little bit
[1:00:57] deep into it right now we said you know
[1:00:59] we either make it but he told me you
[1:01:01] need to try something different as well
[1:01:03] you know because you can't just be doing
[1:01:04] that but don't just focus on
[1:01:07] on your on one I'm thinking and also I
[1:01:11] decided to learn to to do one thing
[1:01:13] really really well and you stick with
[1:01:15] that and and he said well like selling
[1:01:18] on Amazon's learn how to do that
[1:01:20] completely
[1:01:22] fully learn and everything he said he
[1:01:25] said I me as a barber he said he learned
[1:01:27] everything absolutely was became
[1:01:29] obsessed with being able to become a
[1:01:31] piper he said because that's what he
[1:01:33] believed it was his calling so I need to
[1:01:36] become obsessed about my calling and and
[1:01:39] just like like brother Brandon M said
[1:01:42] here he said
[1:01:44] give me a second here
[1:01:46] said hold yourself Clean and Clear to
[1:01:49] your calling stay with God's word and
[1:01:52] don't move for nothing and stay abide in
[1:01:55] your calling if he gives you a job out
[1:01:56] there as a farmer Farm good okay God
[1:02:00] bless you at it and pay your tithes and
[1:02:02] whatever it is your offerings to help
[1:02:04] the ministry go on if he made a mechanic
[1:02:07] out of you and bless you in that work
[1:02:09] stay with it and thank him for it see
[1:02:12] you just abide where God calls you and
[1:02:15] and I believe that there's there's many
[1:02:17] of you that that are already following
[1:02:19] your calling most of you probably
[1:02:21] especially saying that I'm in the
[1:02:24] minority of being a younger person so
[1:02:26] you know still starting out following my
[1:02:29] calling but
[1:02:31] but still it applies any to it to every
[1:02:34] one of us
[1:02:36] stick with with your colleague do the
[1:02:38] best that you can do at what God has
[1:02:40] gifted you to do
[1:02:46] amen this just
[1:02:49] what what it was just it's inspiration
[1:02:52] like I can I believe I I was thinking
[1:02:56] what what am I to preach on and then I
[1:02:59] started remembering it time and time
[1:03:00] again I kept seeing it even my own
[1:03:02] Barbershop at the barber shop telling me
[1:03:05] all these things
[1:03:07] so
[1:03:10] there are there are too many people that
[1:03:13] that don't know what their purpose is
[1:03:15] and don't care what it is and just live
[1:03:17] for themselves
[1:03:19] some people wonder what the point of
[1:03:21] life is
[1:03:23] that there actually there's a lot of
[1:03:24] people it's like what's the point in
[1:03:26] life and and I'm always thinking it's
[1:03:29] right in front of you this whole time
[1:03:30] and and yet they don't I don't see it
[1:03:33] because they're blinded by all the other
[1:03:35] things and all the shiny objects of this
[1:03:37] world
[1:03:38] and and then there are the people who
[1:03:40] wonder what their purpose is in life
[1:03:43] they believe that there's a purpose but
[1:03:46] they don't know what it is and and it's
[1:03:48] people that live their whole lives
[1:03:50] wondering what their purpose is in life
[1:03:53] believing that everyone has a purpose
[1:03:55] but always look in the wrong places
[1:04:05] always looking in the wrong places I
[1:04:07] know of so many people that that
[1:04:10] that are gifted talented there's lots of
[1:04:14] people that gifted it and and they don't
[1:04:17] follow it they're just like well I'm
[1:04:19] good at it but I don't you know I'm
[1:04:22] I don't see how it's ever gonna get
[1:04:24] anywhere in life
[1:04:25] you know it's it's the thing where where
[1:04:28] they're like
[1:04:30] well I don't know if I can you know I'm
[1:04:33] too shy excuses there's a lot of times
[1:04:36] people put excuses behind it to say that
[1:04:39] it's too hard to do it even though it's
[1:04:42] a calling and then and then
[1:04:45] and then one day God gets a hold of them
[1:04:48] and and and
[1:04:50] a lot of people run from their calling a
[1:04:53] lot of people run from especially as a
[1:04:56] calling to be a preacher they run from
[1:04:59] it I know someone and at a church camp
[1:05:02] he said
[1:05:04] he
[1:05:06] um
[1:05:06] you want to know something
[1:05:08] it was a a guy that I told him you you
[1:05:12] look like a preacher and he said well
[1:05:16] actually
[1:05:18] um uh during a service some someone well
[1:05:23] the preacher
[1:05:24] pointed it to me and prophesied over my
[1:05:27] life and said that you're going to be a
[1:05:30] preacher and he said he said well well I
[1:05:33] haven't I don't got enough like I don't
[1:05:35] guy enough evidence on that I'm just
[1:05:38] kind of waiting for something
[1:05:40] and I told him I I do believe that
[1:05:42] you're called to be a preacher I mean
[1:05:44] after especially after that I mean
[1:05:47] I you can wait for another state pray I
[1:05:50] told him yeah I told him pray for
[1:05:52] another sign stop just sitting there
[1:05:55] stagnant not doing anything about it if
[1:05:57] if you kind of feel that conviction on
[1:05:58] your heart pray hey that God will show
[1:06:01] you whether or you're meant to be a
[1:06:03] preacher or not
[1:06:08] all right now turn turn with me if you
[1:06:10] will to
[1:06:13] Romans
[1:06:16] chapter
[1:06:19] yes
[1:06:21] I think yeah the Romans chapter eight
[1:06:25] and verse 27.
[1:06:36] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:06:39] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:06:42] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:06:45] according to the will of God and we know
[1:06:49] that all things work together for good
[1:06:52] to those that love God and to them who
[1:06:55] are are the called according to his
[1:06:58] purpose
[1:07:01] amen I I believe that that
[1:07:05] because as we are are called to a
[1:07:09] purpose God God has set us apart set us
[1:07:13] apart
[1:07:14] he's he said and said and I chose you
[1:07:19] before the foundation of the world for
[1:07:22] this calling not not just to be a
[1:07:25] stagnant and and
[1:07:27] lukewarm type of Christian I chose you
[1:07:31] for a purpose I chose you first and for
[1:07:35] a greater calling and and
[1:07:39] it I I I felt that that burning in my
[1:07:43] heart when I I
[1:07:45] the the thing is
[1:07:48] that makes you have that that find out
[1:07:51] your purpose is getting closer to God
[1:07:53] and it was only until I started getting
[1:07:57] on fire for God that I found my purpose
[1:08:00] that that's it's that's how it is you
[1:08:03] have to get close to God otherwise how
[1:08:05] is God going to speak to you so
[1:08:08] sometimes he'll he'll speak to you and
[1:08:09] get you to a place where where you seek
[1:08:13] God and you seek to get closer to God
[1:08:15] and then and got to reveal things things
[1:08:18] to you
[1:08:20] when you get to the start seeking to do
[1:08:23] his perfect will that's how how you
[1:08:26] start figuring out what where your
[1:08:28] purpose is and and and once you figure
[1:08:31] out what your purpose is
[1:08:34] dude they're the best that you can and
[1:08:40] I think that
[1:08:44] especially us and people that get and to
[1:08:49] know that what their purpose is if if
[1:08:51] you're you can potentially lose that
[1:08:53] passion and lose that drive to to do it
[1:08:57] the best that you can and start slipping
[1:09:00] and start start
[1:09:02] fading out and and start getting in to a
[1:09:06] place where
[1:09:07] where we get distracted and and the and
[1:09:11] that the whole the whole goal for Satan
[1:09:15] is to to stop us from fulfilling our
[1:09:18] purpose on this Earth and and if he can
[1:09:21] do that get you to a place that that's
[1:09:24] the the whole point of what I was saying
[1:09:27] a
[1:09:28] men without purpose distract themselves
[1:09:30] with pleasure and that's how how it is
[1:09:32] not only to distract themselves with
[1:09:35] pleasure but they they go in and seek
[1:09:39] for a purpose in other things that are
[1:09:41] not their purpose
[1:09:43] and and when it's it's a horrible place
[1:09:46] to be into a place where where you know
[1:09:50] what your purpose is but you're not
[1:09:51] following it because of your own own
[1:09:54] thinking in your own desires and it's
[1:09:57] getting away from what and what uh your
[1:10:00] true purpose is
[1:10:02] and and what that purpose is is to
[1:10:06] glorify God
[1:10:08] all things were made to glorify God and
[1:10:10] anything then that is not glorifying God
[1:10:13] is not in in the purpose and it's not
[1:10:17] fulfilling in the the will of God it's
[1:10:21] stagnant it's lukewarm it's and and God
[1:10:25] doesn't want lukewarmness
[1:10:27] he wants
[1:10:31] everything that to glorify him it as a
[1:10:34] matter of fact even
[1:10:38] let's see here
[1:10:40] um
[1:10:48] the Proverbs 16 4 the Lord hath made all
[1:10:52] things even the wicked for the day of
[1:10:54] evil so even the devil is fulfilling the
[1:10:56] purpose of God even when wickedness on
[1:10:59] this Earth is fulfilling in the purpose
[1:11:02] of God and that that is
[1:11:05] and that is to
[1:11:09] bring out true character Out of Heaven
[1:11:11] out of us out of the the real ones to to
[1:11:15] that we would have a relationship with
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ
[1:11:18] and and bring out the best in us and and
[1:11:21] and the way God does that is by making
[1:11:24] it so that it's constantly evil
[1:11:27] around us that that um uh and the desire
[1:11:32] the human flesh desire to to do those
[1:11:34] evil things and to to be among the uh
[1:11:37] about among those those things but
[1:11:40] instead all that pleasure and everything
[1:11:42] else instead choose God and that's it
[1:11:47] how how God says it sets us apart to all
[1:11:52] those options are there but God knows
[1:11:54] those who who we are and chose us
[1:11:59] to to be apart from that and the reason
[1:12:01] that he I believe it's because
[1:12:03] predestination is God foreseen in the
[1:12:06] future of what the decisions that we
[1:12:08] would make
[1:12:09] and and that's how it is that
[1:12:11] predestinated scene God's uh seeing
[1:12:15] these people will choose me over or evil
[1:12:18] these people will will set aside all
[1:12:21] these worldly things and choose me and
[1:12:24] therefore I will bless them and
[1:12:26] therefore uh I will bring them in in a
[1:12:31] Rapture and I will
[1:12:35] amen help help me preacher
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:42] it's been because
[1:12:45] God set a purpose in US God's odds that
[1:12:49] purpose that that seed in us at the end
[1:12:52] that true
[1:12:54] desire that passion within us that that
[1:12:57] become that gets brought out in in the
[1:13:01] right season
[1:13:04] different callings can over different
[1:13:07] times in our lives sometimes like like
[1:13:11] my my purpose at one time was to
[1:13:16] speak speak and it still is but but even
[1:13:20] more so to to
[1:13:23] help those around me at my old job I
[1:13:26] used to work at and and help help them
[1:13:28] to grow closer to God and I believe I
[1:13:31] have and I've touched in people's lives
[1:13:34] through through that because because
[1:13:37] that was my calling at that time at that
[1:13:39] job
[1:13:40] and and wherever God puts you
[1:13:44] wherever God puts you God has a purpose
[1:13:47] in it
[1:13:49] and that's the and to glorify him
[1:13:55] and and I don't ever want I don't ever
[1:13:57] want to
[1:13:59] be set in a place that God put me and
[1:14:03] sit still and do nothing
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:06] when God put a desire air down inside my
[1:14:10] flesh is like I don't know it's kind of
[1:14:12] uncomfortable see it's kind of
[1:14:14] uncomfortable I I don't feel I always
[1:14:17] feel like doing it
[1:14:19] but but then and then you but then you
[1:14:23] get yourself together and say

[1:17:00] amen if y'all ain't going man go ahead
[1:17:03] and go ahead and amen myself
[1:17:08] see see uh in Ephesians 2 10 for we are
[1:17:11] his workmanship created in Christ that's
[1:17:14] a good works which God hath before Dane
[1:17:17] that we should walk in them
[1:17:23] for for by him in Colossians 1 16 where
[1:17:27] by him were all things created that are
[1:17:31] in heaven and are on earth visible and
[1:17:33] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:17:35] dominance or principalities or powers or
[1:17:38] things were created by Him and for him
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:45] there is
[1:17:47] um
[1:17:50] you know I I felt that
[1:17:53] yeah
[1:17:55] well
[1:17:57] you can and some people think like this
[1:18:00] well God called me to do this but
[1:18:03] I don't think I'm cut out for this it's
[1:18:05] it's not it doesn't feel like it's
[1:18:08] something that I would be good at doing
[1:18:09] and I felt that because I had stage
[1:18:11] fright and I don't feel like I'm cut out
[1:18:15] for the job why would God pick me to do
[1:18:18] this
[1:18:19] and
[1:18:20] and and but the real the real thing is
[1:18:23] is that
[1:18:26] the re it's just like
[1:18:29] God uh take me he was he was really
[1:18:32] reaching fires like at the bottom of the
[1:18:34] parent well I'd have got no one else to
[1:18:36] do this I'm just going to pick Daniel
[1:18:38] over here to to do this as well he's not
[1:18:41] really much of a he's not going to
[1:18:44] really do very well but I'll just go
[1:18:46] ahead and call him no that's that's not
[1:18:49] it
[1:18:50] that that's if God called if God called
[1:18:54] you to to do it if God God placed that
[1:18:57] calling in your heart Whatever It Is God
[1:19:00] doesn't make any mistakes
[1:19:03] it he doesn't make any mistakes so even
[1:19:06] if you start out being horrible at
[1:19:08] whatever it seems that God called you to
[1:19:09] do horrible at it you keep on doing it
[1:19:12] as long as you know that it's got
[1:19:13] psychology to do that you stick with
[1:19:15] that and God's Gonna going to bless you
[1:19:17] and God's going to to prosper you in
[1:19:20] that because he has
[1:19:21] he has called you to do that and it's
[1:19:26] it it really is something to anything
[1:19:29] that we we do is think that we're we're
[1:19:32] not good enough for what whatever we're
[1:19:35] we're supposed to be doing
[1:19:37] and we we feel like we're not cut cut
[1:19:40] out for this we're not we can't do it
[1:19:42] like God wants us to do it and I'm not
[1:19:46] trying to
[1:19:47] say anyone's uh insecure here
[1:19:51] but we all get insecure sometimes about
[1:19:55] what we're supposed to be doing and feel
[1:19:56] like we ain't doing it good enough and
[1:19:59] and then and we we go to God why didn't
[1:20:01] you call me to do this
[1:20:04] this is is so hard why would you choose
[1:20:08] me for this it doesn't make sense just
[1:20:11] like like Jonah wants to wanting to run
[1:20:14] away from me because it seemed like such
[1:20:15] a difficult task he was supposed to go
[1:20:17] to a multitude of people
[1:20:21] um however many thousands it was and
[1:20:24] tell them and to repent and this is them
[1:20:27] it's like it was something that I
[1:20:29] believe it was something like God
[1:20:31] sending in this man to go to uh over to
[1:20:33] Sodom and get more and to to tell them
[1:20:35] to repent because it was the sin was so
[1:20:37] bad because God was going to destroy the
[1:20:39] whole place if they didn't repent
[1:20:42] and but God called what one man to go in
[1:20:46] and and tell them to repent and and they
[1:20:49] did but saw them Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:20:52] would wouldn't repent under any
[1:20:55] circumstances and that's why it was
[1:20:57] destroyed made but
[1:21:00] but that's the thing such a wickedness
[1:21:03] in that land and got a gay gave them a
[1:21:07] chance God God gave Nineveh a chance
[1:21:12] because as God gives Every Nation a
[1:21:16] chance God God gave United States a
[1:21:18] chance they rejected it they said we're
[1:21:21] not we're not going to allow this way
[1:21:24] and they shut it they shot Jesus Christ
[1:21:26] out and when they did that and that
[1:21:30] that's when it's it
[1:21:32] God knew that that they were going to
[1:21:35] reject him and therefore it was written
[1:21:37] in the Bible that it would be it would
[1:21:39] it would come to to this point
[1:21:43] but God still gave him a chance
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] and and God also knew that Nineveh would
[1:21:51] turn from their wicked way and turn to a
[1:21:54] God but
[1:21:56] uh and God gives everyone and everything
[1:21:59] a chance and that's why
[1:22:01] God gave us a chance God uh instead of
[1:22:06] destroying everything
[1:22:08] and and just starting in New
[1:22:11] God God sent the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:22:14] that he would have a greater
[1:22:18] that he would have a purpose instead of
[1:22:20] just throwing away of his creation
[1:22:22] because they turned their face against
[1:22:25] him but but God seen that there would be
[1:22:28] a people that that would follow his
[1:22:32] purpose and that would fulfill his
[1:22:34] purpose
[1:22:37] and and and so he created this New
[1:22:40] Covenant with with
[1:22:43] his people
[1:22:45] amen and so so
[1:22:49] uh many
[1:22:51] every a human being on on the face of
[1:22:54] the earth I believe has a purpose but
[1:22:57] they can choose to follow that purpose
[1:22:58] or reject it
[1:23:01] God had a purpose for for her and the
[1:23:06] whole world that uh Jesus Christ died
[1:23:09] for for the whole world not not just
[1:23:13] fast for
[1:23:15] for us but that the whole world and
[1:23:17] everyone in the whole world would have a
[1:23:19] chance to fulfill his purpose
[1:23:24] but but yet they rejected him and
[1:23:32] here uh in
[1:23:35] let's see
[1:23:40] and be not conformed to this world that
[1:23:42] be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:23:45] your mind that ye may prove what what is
[1:23:48] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:23:51] God and this is for everyone whosoever
[1:23:54] will let him drink of the the water the
[1:23:58] air that flows whosoever will and and
[1:24:01] Jesus in The Bride and say
[1:24:04] come and drink
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:09] every human being has a purpose God had
[1:24:14] had a purpose for us God had a purpose
[1:24:17] for every
[1:24:20] everything all creation has a purpose
[1:24:24] even even the devil which is hard hard
[1:24:26] to believe but even the devil has a
[1:24:29] purpose because God doesn't want a bunch
[1:24:32] of robots he wants a bunch of people
[1:24:35] that chooses him rather than sin
[1:24:41] all right
[1:24:53] amen it's
[1:24:56] let's see
[1:25:14] and um Jeremiah 29 11 for for I know the
[1:25:20] thoughts and that I think towards you
[1:25:22] saying the Lord thoughts of peace and
[1:25:24] not of evil to give you an expected end
[1:25:26] in other translations it will say I I
[1:25:31] actually this is the one one verse I
[1:25:33] like another translation and and not I'm
[1:25:36] not of able to uh
[1:25:40] to
[1:25:42] what was it
[1:25:44] and not of evil but to to
[1:25:47] um Can someone
[1:25:50] not not to evil but uh to um is Prosper
[1:25:54] to to prosper you and and not to harm
[1:25:58] you yeah
[1:26:01] not able to to
[1:26:04] give you an expected end and that that
[1:26:06] just kind of it is a little bit more
[1:26:08] depressing than the Prosper you into but
[1:26:15] all right
[1:26:18] Romans well actually yeah
[1:26:21] um
[1:26:22] yeah Romans 12 2 and
[1:26:25] I don't read that
[1:26:28] anyways
[1:26:30] um
[1:26:33] see here
[1:26:46] thank you
[1:26:57] yeah I'll just start here listen I feel
[1:27:00] that that way too I feel that any man
[1:27:03] that's born of the spirit that loves God
[1:27:05] and loves his word has a purpose in that
[1:27:08] God has a purpose in turning Paul around
[1:27:11] did not he say I'm going to show in him
[1:27:15] his glory god had it at a purpose when
[1:27:18] he saved me I am determined to do his
[1:27:21] will not to add to it to take away from
[1:27:23] it Revelation 12 12 19 says
[1:27:28] whosoever shall do it will will be his
[1:27:32] part taking out of The Book of Life
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] I'm determined to never add one thing
[1:27:38] and of my own opinion to that word I'm
[1:27:40] determined to read it just the way it is
[1:27:43] and ask God that I'll open in my heart
[1:27:46] and receive it work it through me Lord
[1:27:49] others my see mate become salty in
[1:27:52] something real in others might see yes
[1:27:55] sir now if if he is our absolute there
[1:27:58] can be no other absolute you can't have
[1:28:00] say you can't say well my my church is
[1:28:05] my absolute my Creed is my absolute if
[1:28:08] Christ is your absolute believe Christ's
[1:28:11] word there is no other way to do it yeah
[1:28:15] you know I think about the the time that
[1:28:18] he saved me I'll I'll tell you why I
[1:28:21] stand the way I do not to be different I
[1:28:23] made myself clear on that I hope I hope
[1:28:26] but the but when Christ saved me there
[1:28:29] were millions of people groping in sin
[1:28:31] when when he saved me he had a purpose
[1:28:34] in doing it he had a purpose in Saving
[1:28:38] me he he just seen in and ignore Ms like
[1:28:42] me and
[1:28:44] somehow or another when when there was
[1:28:47] plenty of smart men more able men men I
[1:28:51] could do it it me here or with not even
[1:28:55] hardly a doctor there's a Divinity and
[1:28:58] philosophy and so forth but when Christ
[1:29:00] saved me he had purpose in doing it or
[1:29:04] he'd have never saved me
[1:29:09] amen amen and if
[1:29:12] and if anyone in here that feels like
[1:29:14] and you're a little bit lost that you
[1:29:17] don't know what where your purpose is
[1:29:20] there's a
[1:29:22] just pray that God would show you the
[1:29:27] way and and have it in your mind and and
[1:29:31] in your heart I want to do the perfect
[1:29:33] will of God get get to that place where
[1:29:35] you're you're truly Desiring to do the
[1:29:37] perfect will of God
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:44] um as the musicians come it's
[1:29:49] it it's like it's like this there's
[1:29:52] there there's people that out there that
[1:29:55] think that they can and do this and do
[1:29:57] they do that and they go out and be
[1:29:59] somebody pick somebody or be a preacher
[1:30:02] without it being in God's calling
[1:30:04] because they want to do something great
[1:30:05] for God but yet it's not in them and God
[1:30:08] didn't ever place it in them to do that
[1:30:11] and there's people that and Satan's out
[1:30:13] there to try to get a false a false
[1:30:16] false purpose and people those hearts to
[1:30:19] where they think I I'm called to do this
[1:30:21] and then to go and do something that is
[1:30:23] not their calling is not their purpose
[1:30:25] and and and it is in it's in Satan to to
[1:30:31] get people to Fall Away false purpose
[1:30:35] and give them false hope and and give
[1:30:38] them
[1:30:39] get all these people today out in the
[1:30:42] world thinking that they have some kind
[1:30:44] of
[1:30:46] of purpose and and yet I all that they
[1:30:49] do is is
[1:30:50] not is
[1:30:52] um glorifying Satan and they think oh
[1:30:55] I'm I'm this is my purpose this is my
[1:30:58] calling and yet it's not
[1:31:00] because uh Satan is out there to deceive
[1:31:03] and the Bible says that the whole world
[1:31:06] would be deceived if there were pasta
[1:31:09] and even the elect if it was possible
[1:31:11] but it's not possible and and we know
[1:31:15] that uh what our purpose is in this life
[1:31:18] and what God has called us as to do as a
[1:31:21] people and we will not be deceived into
[1:31:23] following a main purpose we we may end
[1:31:26] up going along on a vain purpose that is
[1:31:29] not our calling but but God will correct
[1:31:32] this one at one time or another and
[1:31:34] we'll figure out what our true purpose
[1:31:36] our true calling is as long as we truly
[1:31:38] are sincere before him in in seeking in
[1:31:43] that calling and and and then
[1:31:46] and and some some cases it's a different
[1:31:50] calling it in a different season that
[1:31:53] God has called on us too and and um even
[1:31:56] in the time we are now regardless of
[1:31:59] what what age we are different and
[1:32:01] calling in a different in time not I'm
[1:32:03] not talking about Divine and calling and
[1:32:07] the whole purpose of your life if it's
[1:32:09] sort of thing but in a a smaller sense
[1:32:11] as in like in this current circumstances
[1:32:14] that you're in that God chooses is to to
[1:32:17] bring glory to his name and and and like
[1:32:21] I was saying in like a different job in
[1:32:23] a different place in a different in in
[1:32:25] time and and to affect different
[1:32:28] people's lives
[1:32:30] foreign
[1:32:35] that way and and sometimes we don't see
[1:32:39] it and we pass up opportunities that God
[1:32:41] put right in front of us to share the
[1:32:44] gospel to different people and and yet
[1:32:46] we get so so prideful and it or get so
[1:32:49] shy in ourselves to think I can't do
[1:32:52] that I'm going way too too far out my
[1:32:55] comfort zone where even though you have
[1:32:57] it in you that that you're that's
[1:32:59] pulling you to that
[1:33:01] and and yet we choose to bottle up and
[1:33:04] just walk away
[1:33:05] I felt that that many
[1:33:08] I believe I felt that many times where
[1:33:12] you feel God pulling you hey go talk to
[1:33:15] this person pray for them and you just I
[1:33:18] don't want to get out of my company
[1:33:19] choose someone else to do that
[1:33:21] but that that's that's how it we I guess
[1:33:25] sometimes it's it's
[1:33:26] no that's just my own thoughts just walk
[1:33:29] away
[1:33:30] and and when God's been calling us for
[1:33:33] that that purpose in someone else's
[1:33:34] lives sometimes it is to to help someone
[1:33:37] else in their life and
[1:33:39] [Music]
[1:33:41] in um I'm I believe at one time at the
[1:33:44] place I I worked at it was a a
[1:33:48] I I've seen them uh a guy he was like
[1:33:51] this he was just holding his jaw he was
[1:33:54] and I said hey what was wrong what's
[1:33:57] with you know what what's up and he he
[1:34:00] would he said
[1:34:01] he said oh it's just I got too thick I
[1:34:04] got really bad toothache and I can't
[1:34:06] hardly work it's it's been bothering me
[1:34:08] for a while and and I and he said I'm
[1:34:12] going to go to the the dentist after a
[1:34:14] while after this and and then and after
[1:34:17] he walked out and I just felt like
[1:34:20] something on on the inside told me go
[1:34:23] pray for him
[1:34:24] I'm gonna go go lay it hands on doesn't
[1:34:27] the Bible say hey that that they shall
[1:34:31] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:34:33] recover they shall
[1:34:36] all of these things that added us as
[1:34:38] Christians can do now are supposed to do
[1:34:41] that that's our calling to do that the
[1:34:44] Bible says that when that these are the
[1:34:47] signs that will follow them in that
[1:34:49] belief and and as I felt that
[1:34:53] I I just had to and it just kept burning
[1:34:56] within me it just okay I was like I was
[1:34:59] kind of getting a comfort zone
[1:35:02] but I was like you know I I got I gotta
[1:35:05] I gotta do this it's just you know I I
[1:35:07] can't take it anymore it's it's just
[1:35:09] really burning it in the and I have to
[1:35:11] do it it's not it's not just myself I
[1:35:14] believe it's God telling me to do this
[1:35:16] and so I went up to him and
[1:35:19] and I I said hey uh you know I I first
[1:35:24] of all I asked him if he would say I I
[1:35:27] it was a while back I think I asked him
[1:35:30] um are you a Christian do you believe in
[1:35:32] in um God you believe in me
[1:35:34] well yeah I'm a Christian and
[1:35:38] and I said well let me pray for you then
[1:35:41] and and he said okay and and so I laid
[1:35:45] hands on it I prayed for him and he said
[1:35:47] so that feels a bit better and then
[1:35:49] after you left
[1:35:51] the and then it just
[1:35:53] after a little bit I was like I felt
[1:35:57] that Bernie within me again go you know
[1:35:59] pray over him again and it's like what
[1:36:01] you know I just prayed for him like yeah
[1:36:04] you know go tell him that if he believes
[1:36:08] he will recover don't just tell him uh
[1:36:11] I'll just pray for you
[1:36:12] and and I and I I and I finally went
[1:36:17] back to act him and I said do you
[1:36:20] believe that
[1:36:22] well I told him you know by faith
[1:36:25] if you have faith in enough to believe
[1:36:28] that you will be be healed you and you
[1:36:30] you will be healed in and
[1:36:33] and he said it said well oh yeah I told
[1:36:36] I I just went on and on about Chad if he
[1:36:40] has faith enough to to believe in if he
[1:36:42] will will recover and that then it is a
[1:36:45] a promise that that the Bible says and
[1:36:48] he said yeah okay and and I
[1:36:51] I I said and well let me pray for you
[1:36:54] again
[1:36:55] and and this time well it hands on him I
[1:36:59] just felt the the power of God I go
[1:37:02] through me and I said in the name of
[1:37:04] Jesus Christ you're healed and and and
[1:37:07] instantly he he said is oh my goodness
[1:37:11] it's completely better
[1:37:16] oh my goodness I I was I praise God
[1:37:20] that's
[1:37:22] um that's amazing and he just went on
[1:37:24] and on telling everybody that that what
[1:37:29] had happened he would just say and and
[1:37:31] when he went on uh he was saying hey
[1:37:33] Danny healed me and I told him no no I
[1:37:36] didn't I I said said Jesus Christ healed
[1:37:39] you and it was because of your faith and
[1:37:43] and and he said Ed well oh you're
[1:37:45] exactly right and I
[1:37:48] it that that's a one one of the most or
[1:37:52] the most powerful testimony is that I've
[1:37:55] had a healing Inc that I've I've
[1:37:59] witnessed I mean I say that I've
[1:38:01] witnessed it because it wasn't me that
[1:38:03] did it it was the power of God it was
[1:38:06] God doing it through me
[1:38:09] hey man it was I mean
[1:38:15] many times like that and that happened
[1:38:18] but if if God ever puts a burning in
[1:38:22] your in your heart to do something just
[1:38:24] just do it if you feel and you know it's
[1:38:27] right according to the Bible God Satan
[1:38:30] would never put in your mind to go and
[1:38:31] pray for someone
[1:38:34] Satan and once the opposite he wants you
[1:38:36] to to just give in and then he's
[1:38:39] opposite well you don't want to get
[1:38:41] outside comfort zone you know it's kind
[1:38:43] of awkward especially at work I mean
[1:38:45] what what are you doing you know
[1:38:46] people's gonna look at you people's
[1:38:49] gonna look at you funny and
[1:38:51] and and once I let all of that go
[1:38:55] once I let all that go
[1:38:57] and and I said I gotta do this because
[1:38:59] it's just burning in my heart and I feel
[1:39:02] the leading of the Holy Spirit to do
[1:39:04] this
[1:39:05] and you feel that
[1:39:07] and that conviction in your heart to do
[1:39:09] that
[1:39:10] just follow it it doesn't matter what
[1:39:13] anybody else thinks
[1:39:14] because the whole purpose of this life
[1:39:17] is to glorify God bring glory to God and
[1:39:21] and simple simply a put our Satan always
[1:39:26] tries to use our comfort in our area
[1:39:30] human and this to try to get us to not
[1:39:33] want to do it and be shy and not uh and
[1:39:37] not do it be too shy and to to want to
[1:39:40] just hide away in your comfort zone it
[1:39:42] and then hope hope
[1:39:45] that
[1:39:46] see
[1:39:48] we get scared that we make mistakes and
[1:39:51] we get scared that that especially a
[1:39:55] fully following what God has called us
[1:39:57] to do it and I I'm guilty of it too I
[1:40:00] get just before I get up here and
[1:40:02] sometimes I'm like
[1:40:05] I hope I don't make any mistakes
[1:40:09] but but that's that's how it is us as
[1:40:13] human beings we make mistakes and that
[1:40:15] and I I think I read somewhere
[1:40:17] the only person that doesn't make
[1:40:19] mistakes is the person that doesn't do
[1:40:20] anything
[1:40:22] and and so if if we follow what God has
[1:40:25] called us to do and that's all that
[1:40:27] matters it doesn't make it matter if we
[1:40:28] make mistakes we all make mistakes as
[1:40:30] human beings but if we can it doesn't
[1:40:33] matter if anybody judges us either and I
[1:40:35] have to take this in and and we we all
[1:40:38] have to take that in it doesn't matter
[1:40:40] if anyone judges us as long as we're
[1:40:42] following the purpose and the calling of
[1:40:44] anything that God placed in in our heart
[1:40:46] it doesn't matter if we make any
[1:40:47] mistakes we're going to make mistakes
[1:40:50] but we have to yield to his calling and
[1:40:53] yield to his purpose in in each and
[1:40:56] every
[1:40:57] one of our lives
[1:41:01] amen
[1:41:03] stand with me if you will
[1:41:09] let's pray
[1:41:11] Lord God
[1:41:14] I I I believe that you put this message
[1:41:17] on my heart for a reason and I I pray
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:21] that has been it's been a blessing too
[1:41:24] even if it's just been a blessing to one
[1:41:25] person as I said if I could help one
[1:41:29] person and if if you could help me to
[1:41:32] get myself out the way that I could just
[1:41:35] help that one person
[1:41:37] just that even if it's just one person I
[1:41:40] pray that it's
[1:41:42] it's
[1:41:43] everyone but if it even if you just
[1:41:47] touch that one person that was it's just
[1:41:50] really deep in the hearts of just one
[1:41:53] person doesn't matter who it is
[1:41:56] as long as As
[1:41:59] you can and do that Lord that's that'll
[1:42:03] be enough for me
[1:42:06] and Lord I pray that you'll help
[1:42:09] you'll help each and every one of us to
[1:42:12] fulfill your purpose that and that

[1:42:17] put in each and every one of our hearts
[1:42:21] and and to not for us to not worry about
[1:42:23] making so many mistakes and looking like
