everyone is [Music] is um 2.5 oh my god [Music] [Music] leave me in that teach me salvation [Music] oh this way foreign is [Music] is foreign [Music] [Applause] is this morning in my office but uh let me not get ahead of you know people myself the first couple of verses i was just saying it was kind of funny the people in our land said they jesus christ foreign for they shall be mercy blessed are the pure heart for they shall see god and blessed are the peace but they should be called the children of god you know think about christian spirit if you don't want to be in conflict every day of this life with other people it wants to make peace doesn't mean that you can make people think like you do or believe like you but you don't ever want to have a state of thought or a state of war either with your neighbors or brothers you want to you want to get a uh blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you my man shall revive persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you father is [Music] [Music] the world you should be afraid to tell people and you know that not to be judged sunshine and coordinate and make my season's work to glorify your problems that i've come to destroy i've come enough to destroy them a lot of people overlook simple scriptures like that and they go on the very last stance of having a haircut now one job and nobody should pass them along through it all and then he goes off and says whosoever therefore shall break whatever the least of the commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever is showing indeed and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of inside that he needed to do on the [Applause] in the age double lift i was going to jump over here to the i think it's the 23rd chapter here and then i was going to go back here to my channel when i was listening to that message this morning and the thing that struck me he was talking about the family and this was in 1988 i was born all the way back in 1958 talking about the family the basic family group in the united states in the 1950s i worked in 2022 and you know that's 53 years ago from there and he was talking about how women are eliminating war and there's no virtue out there back in 2022 and he always said that the satan in himself was destroyed the relationship between children and their father and father he wants to break that error because once you break that down then there's nothing to hold you anymore and that's what we see today in 2002 and made they tell women now that they don't need a father that the state will take care of them and their children and we're going to point down our own country where the state says our children teach their children the state will do it for you all right and as you can see that isn't working really well in many of the other countries in the world once you break down that relationship with the children there's no stability of their life you know the thing about god thank you whatever we do but i'll just read these scriptures here so i don't say something i shouldn't say anything jesus goes on and kills the people i don't know i'll just jump right here [Laughter] and this is in daniel the fourth chapter of the 27th verse wherefore lord let my counsel be acceptable unto me and break all of my faith by righteousness by showing mercy to the poor [Music] [Applause] god's knowledge this morning and he goes on saying the need [Music] this morning in fact if you have any homes in your country or in your town disappointment [Applause] have to get anymore with it but you can get better in jesus christ i think it works you only want people to be happy and want them to be successful but no matter what happens out there you can't let other people um stand if we could and amen it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning it's i believe we just about got everybody back from being sick with covid and just appreciate the lord watching over all of us this morning and before i forget i'm having an announcement this morning and these are at the back uh they're for the offices of the church and uh brother thomas would like for you to take one and have it turned back in next sunday morning and uh you'll see you can read it and see what's going on this this morning so we just pray that y'all just got our hearts and lives this morning and amen and we just appreciate the lord and i just thinking his brother brian was talking about the world in his condition and brother woody was back there he had his guitar and he said you never know what you're going to see or what you're going to hear in the world today i thought lord just help us to be ready to go home this morning amen let's sing that little course if we could this morning praise him praise him praise him in the morning amen is that what your heart's desire is this morning amen well praise him oh praise him praise him in the [Music] new morning praise him oh praise him praise until the sun goes down love him why don't you love him oh love him love you in the morning love him

time praise him oh crazy the sun goes down hey man you love him this morning amen amen god is good this morning and you know i was thinking as we were saying that everybody brought their instruments this morning and that's good that makes me excited and i know it makes the lord when we worship him this morning you know i've seen a little video the other day at a pentecostal preacher and i kind of chuckled because the second one i've seen of him i knew that he had been reading brother branham's books and listening to him but he was talking about sports and it was kind of funny because i like baseball and some of you like different things but he said you know he said you'll go to those games and you'll pay all that money and so you'll act like a wild man but he said when you come to church you're just and he sit down on the monitor and just sit there and he said you don't and he said this is something that's life everlasting for your heart life what the lord's done for you this morning i thought that's true but i'm so glad that he lives in our heart and life this morning and we're going to sing that praise him again but this time i should say we're not going to sing it we're just going to play our instruments this morning if we could we'll pray [Music] everybody together if we could this morning oh why don't you praise him oh praise him oh praise me in the morning praise him [Music] one more time if we could this morning why don't you pray [Music] oh praise him oh praise him in the morning praise him in the noontime [Music] him oh praise him oh praising till the sun slows down well i'm so glad that jesus set me free i'm so glad that jesus set me free when i'm so blind that jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah jesus set me free well oh satan had me bound but jesus

it's next sunday the first sunday so we're on track amen good to see everybody out this morning amen isn't it a beautiful day amen well i'll tell you i do feel like the lord's laid something special on my heart this morning amen so we're going to forget about time all right and just see what the lord will have for us amen because i do feel like in the last i don't know two three days i guess they've been pondering it and uh so when i went uh i would thought i had the thought in my mind and when i went and pulled up uh something i was looking for and punched in the word and the very first one that they came up with exactly what i was looking for so i was like well i mean then others just he was all falling in line i was like well lord i believe that's what you wanted to speak on amen but i appreciate brother danny amen everybody appreciate brother danny preaching amen amen i think he's doing good so far amen and so we appreciate him a young man that wants to give his heart and his life to the lord and to serve god amen it's a great thing amen amen and brother brad also god bless you appreciate his help i want to say that we appreciate having those two ministers and also for all of our trustees all of our deacons and every all of our sunday school teachers and musicians everybody i want to thank everybody for all that you do for the lord amen all of our special singers is that right anything that blesses the church anything that ministers to the body of christ god bless you amen all of you amenders all of you smilers all of you whatever you do to pull from the gift of god god bless you amen how many believes it takes all of us pulling together amen i'm very happy i want to thank each one those that are getting voted for and so forth i want to say i believe that the lord is pleased with everything and it's certainly running in harmony you don't know how much a pastor appreciates when things run in harmony amen i want to thank this church for all of you people that uh let me be pastor amen amen let me leave amen because i'll tell you what we all got our ideas about stuff you know but you know it's hard to say sometimes but if they don't vote you in as a leader try not to do that amen and i don't not anybody is but it's it in our own mind when you're talking to somebody remember each one of us thinks we're right and we're all have different ideas sometimes you know and those are the kind of things you got to lay aside you know i mean you have to ask yourself this question that is is god blessing it amen are you even edified by it is god in it amen because if that that's the way that it is well it doesn't have to be just the way you think or i think amen amen but we want what god thinks am i right so god bless you amen and i do appreciate for this last year and and the blessing god has bestowed upon us i do know that god is blessed in a way here in the last decade or so i guess uh even especially in the finances and so forth amen like we didn't see for many over a decade that we did see god blessing us we've you know we ran into the 5 000 or two maybe but now it's ten thousand fifteen thousand sometimes that we have in the bank and that's a real blessing because and i know that god's god blesses those that give amen and we're just thankful for that and and a special thanks to brother brian also because we know it's a lot of work we we do work but when he does that paperwork every week and pays all those bills every month he does an exceptional job amen and i don't know why in the world we didn't get together and say hey let's up this uh payment plan a little bit quicker amen and but actually because just since we i told him to do it we was over a hundred thousand what was it less than a year ago but down to what 80 or something 79 78 praise the lord so you know how happy that makes me it just like took a big old bite out of it amen i mean i believe it's going to get bit down real quick amen so god bless you i don't mean to keep you standing too long but i didn't want to sit you down but i just want to say that god bless you this morning it's good to be a christian this morning i want to say that i believe that a church like this amen the way that it's set up is of god amen and our coming together and worshiping and being edified it's god's plan how many believes that it's god's plan and you can't you can't better that you can't change that and expect to be blessed amen amen and so i'm just thankful for god amen and that he's with us it's getting late in the hour how many knows we're we're getting late now amen 77 brother bams ought to be over with here we're in 220 20 20 20 22. hello it's getting late and i believe god is doing something i believe god is doing god didn't quit god did not quit when brother barron left no he did not quit he's not quitting now he's working on his people now if you are his people i'm talking to you he's working on you how he believes you're his people amen and he's working on us and it seems like the last few services that we've had even with all of us all three of us minister scott's just been focusing on talking about a closer walk with god amen amen i believe it's true that it's time for a closer walk and this will it may be again be a center towers a closer walk with god amen so god bless you this morning real good amen let's bow our heads lord jesus first of all we want to thank you lord for those who lord have overcome clover lord and are feeling better again lord jesus and father we give you gone and glory lord for all that you do and for healing us lord like you do father there's a few out yet lord jesus they're not feeling well lord and but there's sean lord has had to go home with his neck and so forth and we ask god that you just be with him just now lord in the name of jesus christ we ask god that he would be better before this service is overlord and that would leave him lord jesus and he would feel good we ask god that you bless every heart every soul that is coming to your house according to your word not forsakingly assembling ourselves together lord jesus but so much some more as we see that day approaching so we thank you lord for those who were able to make it out this morning and lord we just ask your blessing upon the reading a word the meditation of our heart that which we feel that you have laid upon our heart to speak on this morning may it bless your people in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen and amen all right turn your bibles if you will and we'll go to um the book of matthew i only have like i don't know i i i they're targets and i picked up a few more scriptures but i don't have a lot of scriptures but i do have quite a few quotes that i'd like to read this morning if the lord will permit amen matthew 11 [Music] 28 through 30 and i want to talk to you this morning about the power of a surrendered life the power of a surrendered life surrender amen that's going to be our thought matthew 11 and 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest amen aren't you glad for that take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in the heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light hebrews 4. 9 through 11. i think the prophet god said he was waiting for the leaves to quit turning amen you can hear him ruslan we don't want to leave you out nine four and eleven hebrews four and i'm sorry for hebrews four chapter four verse nine through eleven there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god he for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore amen to enter into that rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief may god that is blessing instead of reading the word you can be seated this morning amen i want to say things that i've said many times here before but once again i feel to say it again is that okay as we strive to get closer to god and like we said i think on our last service with every tick of the clock you get closer to god with every tick is that right because you only have so much time and we know that even even if you don't see god till after the thousand years right even if you don't come up until after the second in but in the first resurrection but you come up in the second resurrection which we know the sinners up here they're still going to see god because the bible says every eye shall see him and though that pierced him that'll look upon him right they're all going to come face to face with god so they're going to meet god that's right whether it's our president whether it's nancy or chuck schumer or all of our uh elected officials all of them they're all gonna stand before god and they're gonna have to confess that he is is that right everyone's going to have to stand before him one day blah blah blah blah blah say what you want but you're going to stand in front of them that's there's no question about that amen and all of your blah blah blah you're going to have to answer for everything else is blah blah this here is yay amen how many knows this is the truth amen so we're not looking for that time we don't want to be in that place we want to see god amen in the first resurrection amen any time now i may believe we're going to see him any time now even when brother ben went beyond the curtain of time he wanted to see him i want to see my match i want to see jesus you can't have a little sneak peek you can't go up beforehand kind of look no we're all going to see him at the same time that right amen and we're going to meet him in the skies so shall we ever be with the lord and that's what we come to church for this morning is to get ready to meet him how many believes that the prophet of god was uh ordained and sent to dress the bride to get the bride ready amen you reckon if uh you reckon the churches out there are ready to meet him no no they're not ready to meet him they dress like prostitutes look like prostitutes go to church you're gonna have to turn your head with the way the women are dressed that's right if you've got the holy ghost turn your head that's not the house of god that's not the church of god god ain't going to marry a prostitute he's not going to you know marry something like that he's going to come with a people that is humble that loves him with all of his heart amen praise the lord so let me just start with saying this amen and i'm thinking it was either the greatest battle ever fought for some reason my printer don't put the title on it but um the problem of god says it this way there's little things that we do all right and that's what we come to church for amen we have a purpose to come in church don't we everybody come for church if you look for criticism talking to criticize you'll certainly find plenty but the purpose listen this is what we come to church for is to find how where our fault is amen what our fault is and the things that we might better ourselves amen i believe that don't you amen find our weak places our weaknesses to find our bad places boy i sure wish he'd quit preaching on me oh my looks like he's doing his job right right that's right but that's you you know the holy spirit knows how to talk to you he sure does to find our bad places to find our weak places let me say this to find those places that are not yet surrendered to god oh my god i want you to know there is immense everything lays in jesus christ everything lays in a surrendered life to almighty god [Music] because i'll tell you if you're even going to accept him even if you're going to have faith in god you have to surrender to faith and that right you got to choose not to disbelieve and you're going to have to choose to believe that god said it so you surrender to what god said and with that comes a great reward right there is nothing like being surrendered to god i don't know what teacher was but i believe he was preaching not to go long ago mentioned that maybe it was brother brad i don't know but there's a saying that they said the world has yeah i think it was him the world has yet to see now i won't be able to paraphrase it perfectly what it's like the power that a man would have that's completely in the hands of god are completely surrendered to god and you know one thing i thought about when he said that is we did see we did see the power that a man would have completely surrendered to almighty god and that was brother brethren that's right praise the lord oh my aren't you glad for what god let me tell you something if it wouldn't have been for god malachi malachi 4 this would be done with it would be over with he says least i come and smite the earth with a curse in other words if i don't send him i'm gonna curse the whole thing huh but he did that because he knew that we would need it you know it's different it's one thing for a preacher to come here and preach and say stuff but it says that the god showing them witness witnessing the apostles i believe it mark he says through signs and wonders and miracles god comes and backs it up when god comes and proves something huh and i've talked to people that got revelations that have all went off into the left field of this message hello and they'll come up with sayings right and you have to take their sayings or what the prophet said who do you think i'm going to go in i always tell them well if it's according to your word i still want to see the vindication i want to see god come down here and open blind eyes and discern the thoughts intents of the heart then maybe i could believe what you said but i wouldn't even believe it then if it was according to the word huh but here a man that did that would speak the word and it would be according to the bible and god himself would come down and vindicate it you just believe that you're worthy of hell brother bam says that is then sin amen it's sin to disbelieve now after god himself comes down and does that praise the lord amen so praise the lord we want to talk about victory amen these we've been talking about the battle space isn't that right battles we have to fight right and man sometimes it just seems like you can't barely we just struggle and labor and fight and paddle and paddle and battling we should didn't the bible say didn't we read that he says let us labor let us struggle let us have a burden let's be heavy later oh i just can't take it no more then god says take all of your mess take all of your bird and take all of that come and cast it upon me come up to me all these that are weary and heavy laid in that you got burdens and so forth and what will he do when you come to him when you surrender to him he will give rest oh my i've got a couple questions here let me see where they are i might have a hard time this morning to keep involved with this but i got three questions all right first of all what is the meaning of surrender what is this not meaning what is the what's the symbol of surrender how many knows what the symbol of surrender is that's it brother joe your brother dave we got two that know what the symbol of surrender is is that it everybody should understand what that means when that cop comes up chases the guy down he gets perhaps out of the car amen and he gets on the ground or what are you standing up trying to get up what does the cop say hands up right get your hands up because they don't want it oh no gun they don't want it on the weapon they want to see that you ain't got a hold of nothing huh and also that you're surrendering oh my we let that talk politics shall we because that's a real mess huh that's a real mess with our cops with our police and the disrespect they get you know it's like they expect every cop to be good when have you been in any organization or even in this church where everything was just right even here are three kinds of believers hello no they're not all good but you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater amen all right we're going to get right off of that now [Music] he says surrender the symbol is surrender and get your hands off of anything that makes me feel good when i think about that's what god wants you to do get your hands off of it and let him do it [Music] i knew it was going to be good this morning praise be to god you love him the second question question number two what does victory sound like amen i i i am not hearing anything what does it sound like [Applause] glory that's what it sounds like you know in new york when all of our soldiers came home you know from new york and they seen the statue of liberty do you know what they did and they were screaming and hollering and carrying on you ain't never heard the likes there's also always a great noise that happens in every battle but there is a victory you've got the shout of victory in the camp [Applause] that's what we need it's the shout of victory can i tell you story about this taking our time brother venom up says about 15 years ago tonight i was standing on this platform and there was a big chart and i was teaching all right everybody now this is what the holy spirit does perhaps and this is this and this is that we like that i like to teach there's times for teaching but that's what he was doing he was teaching and there's a little pentecostal group come from louisville and i never did believe in them people dancing the way that they did and there's a little lady come on out there and play the piano and they got to go to play a little special and beat on the little thimbles and the washboard i could just hear it just they got a little rhythm going all right and some of them beat on a tin can and i was very much of a critic of it and so i thought what's going on and the woman come up to play a special she got the plan and the lady got the beaten on the washboard and this little old blonde headed girl jumped up out of the floor and she began to dance in the spirits and me sitting there in the seat of the scornful and i said no i wish you'd look at that and i've been telling in my church until they was all wondering what i was going to do about it and i kept looking at her and i thought oh look at that now if that isn't something making a tavern out of my church i was sitting there not knowing any better i wasn't saying nothing but i in my heart i was thinking it and so i watched her there for a while i was dancing and the first thing you know i said now wait a minute i wonder if the ladies got any scripture for that folks i don't care what you talk about where you go what you think what you do you always ask that question is there a scripture for it how many believes that no matter what you do you think or what revel by the scripture and so that was good scripture for it not beginning to thinking about the scriptures and i said where where was dancing ever ordained that the first place in the bible and that's right and i thought well what made them dance not seeing that the children of israel when they crossed the red sea miriam looked back and seen all her task maskers grow take a look back this morning look at all those things that you don't have to battle with anymore look at smoking look at that drink and look at that whiskey drinking look at all those things you don't never have a problem with they're dead they're drowned folks it it's it's it's tough if you really got victory to stay quiet i don't know how people would do that just blow up if i didn't have a way to vent my feelings oh yeah let's get to the good part all the taskmasters drowned she picked up a tambourine and begin to dance oh my and beat this tambourine run down the shores just the dancing and all the daughters of israel following her dancing i thought that's victory oh my that's victory i seen david when his sweetheart sitting up there behind us here and fanning herself looking at her cute little boyfriend david standing out there and here come the ark amen like brother graham talked about a while ago come across the hill when david seen it coming he danced around and around and around why she said you embarrass me after a child never did have any children god didn't want any like that he says if you don't like that watch this and around and run around he went you know what god looked down from heaven he says david you are a man after my own heart i mean that's what god is if that was what that if god if david was like god's own heart then you what god likes for his children how many knows that god loves for his children to have exceeding great joy there's nothing that makes and the child is just as happy as they could be that's when the child mom and dad is happy when the children are happy they have joy in their life and that's what god wants this morning he wants you to have joy this morning i want to show you about god's help how did you have joy that okay now i'm telling you this this hits me it'll hit everybody i don't think there's anybody this message won't hit that it won't be a blessing to amen now notice oh my god look down says you're a man after my own heart that's right and i thought you know there's one thing that's the matter with me i haven't got enough victory are you with me this morning that's the problem because i don't believe in shouting put on i don't believe in screaming and acting no don't act just let it come from here they come here first and then let it come out because we're not here to uh impersonate act like something you're not i wanted to be real and genuine amen but he said maybe i just don't have victory and i got to sit in there and i got my old methodist foot oh when the sage go marching in when the state are marching listen to what he said he got nothing before the patent the first thing you know god is my judge before i know what was going on i was out there on the floor dancing around that girl you think i get out of order you should be around brother bannon for a little bit no not out of order dancing is not out of order shouting is not out of order screaming is not out of order amens are not out of order hallelujahs are not out of order that's what god loves god inhabits the praise of his people oh my first thing you know he was out there that's right that's right then i said god take me out of the old seat of the scornful and let me look at anything sensibly before i ever pass judgment anymore praise be to god aren't you glad for that so the third question i already answered but how does victory act that's what that victory acts like oh glory hallelujah it'll make your scream shout and everything else let me lie to you can i lie to you this morning what if i told you last sunday i was watching the football game i didn't watch it don't watch it don't really keep up for any more since they can't even stand for the national anthem yeah that's right but anyway and there's one certain team one and the those that lost were shouting and those that one were just not a peep out of them it would be a lie wouldn't it no it wouldn't be that way at all why they would come out of their bleach and just slap each other on the hand and scream and shout especially if it was the last play even though all they needed was three points or a a what is it the next point like to go in and mix it just by one point amen in that running back then he's heading from the 10 to the five he's getting beat back he keep take it in make it in huh and he comes over there and he just mad he gets hit he just falls down and he slams the football on that little corner pig and the empire says touchdown you think everybody would stay in their seats i guess that's pretty good you silly defense why couldn't our defense stop that guy you'd be disappointed the other guy were like yeah that's the way to whoop him that's the way to run through him that's the way to make it the losers would always say oh such fanaticism they're getting too carried away they have got too much emotion huh but i works in church sometimes i'm gonna get so happy in the spirit and those that don't knock knocks and they're just like he's just too emotional amen that is what victory looks like like by the day the harder the battle the sweeter the victory [Music] oh my we have to battle things sometimes for a lifetime years sometimes decades we battle things you know and it's all comes down to this one thing it's fighting your greatest enemy it's what you're doing your biggest enemy that you got is yourself you are your biggest enemy oh my trying to conquer that guy as a job oh he's a job i want you to know praise the lord but i may believe it can be done so much so that almost every time that jesus talked about if you come to him huh he never got to talking about the devil he got to talking about yourself [Music] huh he says if any man come after me he says you know he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me he didn't love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy man he that think if not his own cross and followed after me is not worthy of me he that find us his life shall lose it how many believes that you've got to die to yourself you got to lose your own lives huh let me tell you something that's many times people will come to the place of suicide most a lot of times people will find god there because they're so miserable they're so tired of their life they don't want it anymore and they'll put a guy in their head and they'll blow their brains out but instead of doing that why don't you just fall down and surrender your life to god i'd say here i am i'm done with my life i'm completely surrendering to you i tell you what god can come to fill you with the power of god you'll never be the same again everybody has to come to the point of death everybody's gotta not just come to the point of but you've got to die to yourself if you're ever gonna have the power of the holy ghost if you're ever gonna have victory you gotta come to the death of yourself and completely surrender because you are going to surrender i mean those you are going to surrender the bible says nobody lives to himself nobody dies to himself you either live for god or you live for the devil if you're going to live for god you got to die to the devil and to yourself that's right every time what will a man get in exchange for a soul huh you got to make an exchange i mean please you got to give something you got to surrender something if you're ever going to have something from god oh my i was thinking about this and i was thinking about how that you know salesman will tell you hey you know you know we're going to give you this for free folks you tell me i'm getting something on the free i'm hanging up on you on the phone i'm straight up my hang up on i i i like by the red i don't like to get too honest here in the pulpit when it comes my own fault but sometimes we do but i've gotten to the place after i tell them no i am not interested huh no i am not interested we know that you want to make a donation so could you take a lesser rotations no you know i just hang up what part of no don't you understand i am not interest don't tell me i'm interested when i'm not i want to tell them i haven't yet but i haven't i want to tell some of them say look if i answered all of y'all's calls all i would do is could y'all just please stop do you feel like that sometimes please stop soliciting i tried to be nice but sometimes people i'll tell you what i love i love those mechanical you know where it's a machine talking to you i mean i don't even feel bad about it for the whole head up on the machine a little bit for a human maybe but machine no problem at all i even asked him sometime this is a machine just to check it out one time it wasn't lily was kind of funny no no i'm i'm using i i got confused i'm speaking through a a automated uh machine or something and i still hung up i just said i guess he was still a machine oh my but anyway y'all know what it's like you love the lord all right let's go let's have another story amen let's talk about how many beliefs have you got to surrender to god and and every aspect of our lives let me just let me just read you the last quote that came to my mind before i came out and i wrote it down here i'll go ahead and read it you will never be fully blessed until you fully surrender brahm he says you'll never be fully blessed until you fully obey right and obedience is surrender how many believes that to obey is to surrender in ephesians he says wives submit yourselves to your husbands for the husband the head of the uh wife is the husband the head of the man is christ right everybody has their order ephesians 5 submitting submitting submitting yielding to amen children obey your parents servants be certain subject to your masters and everything and then paul at the end says finally be strong in the lord if you're completely submitted in the place that god wants you to be you will have the power of almighty god but you'll never do it we'll never do it until we look back in our lives amen and we see where those areas are that are not surrendered amen that are not surrendered to god and i had wrote down in here and since i'm in the 60s club now any of us that are in our 60s or older brother urban don't we look back don't we look back and see all the mistakes that we've made that's right you get a 20 20 hindsight after 60 you get 20 20 vision of your pass it begins to bear down on you huh and you begin to see the things that you wish you wouldn't have done the things that you wish wouldn't have happened you begin to see how you really are you begin to see where you're at with god you see your faults better when you get close to god this is not just for older folks hello but you begin to see where you have areas that are not surrendered to god i want to make a statement can i make a statement anything that the word of god says that you don't do is the undersurrendered part of your life don't expect the power of god don't expect the full blessings of god expect a lukewarm halfway mediocre mediocre so to speak kind of a christian life if it's not surrendered you are not going to get the blessings that you deserve that you could have if it was the other way and i believe it's time to get closer to god i believe it's time for a complete sunrenderer don't you amen so we find here that it comes and has to do with our life every aspect of our life amen all right let's talk about a story brother branham said he says i met a woman some years ago in a 10 cent store and she was about 60 years old looked about 30 years old and i says how do you do sister she says well brother venom i've got two sons and that's darkness that's older than you are and honest to goodness she didn't look over 30 years old and she said well here's what it is when i come to christ and when i was about 12 years old i sat down and i thought about it i studied other religions but one well i found when i found the true one i come to christ and i gave him my case i gave him my soul my all to him and she says i never had a worry since said that he promised to take care of all my problems didn't say cause all your cares upon him he'll care for you yeah and she said if he's not big enough to do it then i know i'm not big enough to do it so what's the use of worrying about it see christ promised that he'd take care of all your cares catch your cares on him so what are you worrying about don't worry worry builds up pressure and pressure blows up so just cast your carries on him and quit worrying them amen in this he says this wasn't letting him off pressure he says you know you say well brother brandon he says i just want her brother around he says don't wonder how many knows well i wonder about that don't wonder i mean you ain't gotta wonder i wanted to don't wonder the words true the word is true god is right you just let jesus just let off the pressure commit your case to god and go on as if it was all over don't build a pressure it's gonna blow up if you don't amen how many believes that all so many of our troubles and cares and things that we battle with they're over when you completely surrender to christ the reason we still have battles like we do a lot of times is because we're not dead yet we are not dead yet because and let me say this that this goes in more of a it's not because you're not born again hello because a lot of us that are christians that have been many years in christianity who knows that you still have areas like that you know you still battle with things as a matter of fact a lot of us have weaknesses the protoband talked about we have that weak spot that weak link somewhere that you have to pray about right and that you have to overcome just like a young convert oh my i'll tell you what god brings us and he allows us to go through these battles to bring us to the death of ourselves we just can't do it no more because as long as you can try to do it you'll fail because we know that if god don't take something from you you're going to have it the only thing you can do is completely surrender it to god but if you're in the least little bit alive yet hello least little bit unsurrendered that's why let me say this this is another aspect of it to where you can go extreme with one way or the other but this is the balance of it is that even though you overcome these things as long as you're in this flesh how many of those that you'll still have a battle you'll still have to overcome you will have to die every day you will have to surrender every day isn't that right because if you don't surrender every day as long as this is here it's still bothering it's still going to try to come up but i let me say this i am convinced that if we have the spirit of god in us like romans 7 talks about our flesh it's weak that's we would not that we do so many times like brother brad says you know i'll be honest with you sometimes i don't want to come to church i'm the pastor and i'll be honest with you sometimes this don't want to go to church but i guarantee you if i've got a hot message or if i'm right with the lord where i should be i'm going to go to church it's because i am not surrendered like i should be because just the cares of life can get you that way from monday to wednesday hello but when you're surrendered i'll tell you when you're surrendered to the holy ghost the way that you're supposed to be a naked woman could come in front of you and you would turn your head huh which we know the prophet taught that a woman barely dressed is more sexy than a naked one naked one is just land it's just there you know but there's still something there covered up just a little bit that's what they do out there right they might as well run naked because they practically are anyway amen how many believes that you get the holy ghost it gives you the power to look the other way are you with me you get enough of the holy ghost it'll give you the desire to be with your brothers and sisters in church it'll give you a desire to learn more to get more of the word and advance in christ it's when we become unsurrendered in some part of our life amen i might as well i'm gonna do it anyway if i have two glasses i'm gonna say where's my pair of glasses put another one up welcome to 60. y'all needed that that's just to lighten you up what's coming amen praise be to god hallelujah just don't come out in my barn all right i have me a dancing shouting fit out there having me a good time in the lord amen tell you what makes you feel good you love the lord a daily how many believes it's a daily surrender because the first thing you know that prayer that you used to pray don't pray anymore in the morning that thought on the lord and that dedication runs away with you here if you aren't careful amen praise the lord i don't know about you but i want the dance of victory i want the shout of victory i want the joy of being so much in christ until i can rest from all of our labor i mean the bible says he who has entered into the rest has thank you ceased from all his labors it's not you doing it anymore it's him that's what we want what a bright hope you have what a bright future brother glenn what a bright future that you have you don't have to pierce your ears and do this nose and tattoo yourself up and look like a rooster or a chicken or paint your hair blue and let your heart get blue let your your world get blue to be empty and to end up in a burning lake of fire that's not your future your future get closer to god get more joy and eventually get the body change go into heaven and live trillions of years come on people that's way too quiet glory hallelujah that's your future what a thing you rejoice about but this is the quietest place for the grain you'll ever be amen in the lake of fire he's gonna be weeping away gnashing of teeth when you get to heaven it's gonna sound like thunder because the people are praising god and worshiping him and glorifying him because he was their victory [Music] that's right i like to start here brother john i like to start here [Applause] praising god worshiping the lord give him the honor the glory that's through him oh my i've got things i have to surrender yet can i say something usually when i say something i forget what i was about to say but maybe i'll remember it this time don't never say it can i say something but i'll try to remember this time i told micah back there i told him i said sometimes i'm in that pulpit now i have a thought and i'll say can i say something and then the next second other bread i have to talk about blood of jesus christ or something because i forgot it completely what i was going to say you don't know it because i don't tell you till this morning oh my now where was i right i remember yet brother branham was so surrendered to god that he wouldn't even want to break the speed limit he was so surrendered every aspect of his life that he wouldn't even break the speed limit huh folks i gotta pull my foot back all the time i haven't gotten there yet brother tommy i still gotta do a lot of repenting when i'm on the road cars you angels out there i'm very glad you got them angel weave you know but can i say something oh yeah i know some voice will whisper to you well they'll let you go over eight miles an hour you know they won't stop you that voice will tell you that but you won't find it in a quote oh oh my another one he says when you break the law you sin that's what he said huh you sinned you missed the mark that's the truth y'all want the truth pray for me i like to tell the truth that's the truth and god honored the man how many believes you honor god god will honor you how many believes we need to honor god more by doing what he said if you don't do what he said you're not surrendered you're not a complete christian you're kind of a halfway christian and i thought about when i said this i wanted to say this because you could take a quote where brother bam says god don't have there's no black white bird there's no this that or the other but i will say that some of us are halfway christians incomplete all right let me how many wants greater victory in your life all right here we go here we go this is the part i want to get to on this whole quote i'll just read a certain certain thing here moses when he was called by god he was a total complete prophet how many knows brother bam says that he was complete and total prophet but we also know that moses had a area yet didn't he called the temper and moses in all of his faults all of his failures his people got to go in but he didn't imagine a leader like that joshua and caleb and some of the children went in now the vast majority didn't right because they had disbelieved too many times but now joshua and caleb did but because that he had a temper and he smote the rock twice he wasn't supposed to smite the rock twice and so forth and and so forth he he didn't get to go in now he's saved and so forth but he didn't get to go into the promised land but he was surrendered just like samson i mean no samson was surrendered to god what can god do when a person surrendered well you could do like samson back in the old testament samson the public god said that he gave god his strength but he gave delilah his heart he loved delilah and delilah finally got to him way down there in his heart but he gave me strength to god and he could kill a thousand philistines he could kill ten or twenty thousand if the knee grows right he became invincible unstoppable full of the power of god as all i get older i get weaker but i want to be stronger and i want to be stronger in the lord how about you i want to be stronger in the lord i want more of the power of god in my life amen all right when god sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything he has need of how many believes that's true for our christians he's equipped you with everything that you have need of to be a complete christian not halfway not a lukewarm christian he put something if he's a preacher he'll put something in him to preach with if he's a teacher he'll put something in him to teach with if he's a prophet he'll put something in him to see visions with god always equips his man then just like you if you are a christian god don't make any halfway christians god makes complete christians i mean that's his desire is that every one of us is completely surrendered to the lord god don't make halfway preachers but a preacher can be halfway oh how many knows that god makes his children's christians but sometimes they're halfway christians but it's not god's intentions for them to be that way it's their own ways that got mixed up in the plan of god for their life i want to rephrase that it is some of their ways that are not yet surrendered to god is that all right some of your ways are still there their ways are not surrendering to god that's why oh i want to say thus saith the lord that's why you're not what you ought to be that's why i'm not what i ought to be because there's still some of my ways in there meaning to scream like that i don't believe it takes screaming to get that to you i believe i can whisper it but god help us to hear it one form or another let us hear it in here and down in our hearts that if you're not the kind of christian that you ought to be you still have a lot of uh defeats and so forth because there's areas in your life that's still not surrendered to god because god will have you victory over anything that comes your way if you're surrendered to god the way you should be there is nothing that you can't overcome there is nothing that you can't go through if you're completely surrendered to god but if you're not completely surrendered to god you'll blow up you'll lose it huh temptation will get you amen let me tell you something over in the previous age before leodycia i believe it was that god told that age he says and i will keep you from the hour of temptation huh let me tell you something about how many beings that we're in the hour of temptation we're in the hour of temptation pornography and everything that's out there is the hour of temptation man there's millions of dollars to be made that you're if you want to if you want to be a penny here or a millionaire you know there's all of that that you can go up the temptation of these things lust of the flesh the pride of life amen the hour of temptation is upon us if you want to overcome there's only one way that's to surrender submit yourself obey god amen okay it's their own ways it got mixed up in the plan of god it's why people are what is halfway half hot have cold there you go thank you it's lukewarm just kind of a halfway christian god will use whatever part you give him how he believes that he'll use whatever part to give him he's appreciative of it but he wants all of you he wants how many doors and door every door of your life he wants control he wants it all surrendered you didn't have business a lot of us have businesses right is that right he wants that business to rendered to god everything is above board everything's right that right and it doesn't take the place of god amen everything whether you're working for somebody whether you're a wife whether you're a child god wants you submitted he wants you to surrender amen submit yourselves one to another the bible says what the prophecies god say submit yourself to your pastor folks sometimes i i gotta tell people people that quit church or whatever sooner or later i gotta confront them i gotta talk to them if they're not going down the wrong way my job is to tell you you're not going the right way you can quit this church and you still live in this area i want to tell you something i'm still your pastor as long as god doesn't need to be here in this area i don't care i am your pastor think about it jesse bell elijah was her pastor whether she liked it or not [Music] oh my mine i did it i've done it listen this is your job not that you desire to be a drug i don't like to tell people stuff but oh my let me just say my sister some of that that was going on here in the church it got to the place where i couldn't hold my peace i had to go up there and confront him just tell them what it is how it is this got to stop did i want to no i had to when you see there's something that's wrong you see something brewing ain't right it comes in here what do you think sometimes i come out here and i say things it's kind of harsh folks if i didn't and i towered down because well that person that's got this is going to hit pays a lot of time they might leave huh if i did that you should vote me out that's right not fit to be up here what did brother braham say just comes to a moment he says a preacher amen that won't preach the truth will compromise for that he says he ain't he ain't worth it amen but how many is that i mean if we actually have that if we have a trustee board we have a deacon board we have a song that we have we have a church sense of god we ought to be the happiest people to know that he's not us it's god thank you jesus thank you lord there's no big eyes don't literally use it's all of us working together for the kingdom of god it's the fivefold how many knows god put the five-fold ministry in the church for what for the perfecting of the saints you think you don't have to have a pastor if you won't submit to a god-ordained pastor you are not submitting to god don't try to tell me that you are you're lying god's not going to say well i told you to listen to him but you ain't got to just listen to me that make him a liar because he said to listen to it now he says you don't have to huh god's not like that he's perfect isn't he god equips us how many believe it now notice moses he had made him a complete prophet for a complete deliverance and moses was completely surrendered into the hands of god that's the reason that it made him what he was he was so completely in god till god could trust him oh my god could trust him i wonder this was going to be my closing argument argument i'm not a lawyer here but this is going to be my closing statement amen let me hold off on this and read another one would that be okay it's where brother emma's talking about how that we make excuses for our weaknesses right well i'm just not able i'm not worthy i'm not this out of the other that's where you got to get to before god could ever use you he says we take these excuses and say well i can't do this and i'm insufficient god takes that very thing to do the job with that's what he chooses to do it with because before god can use you you got to become nothing a nobody dead to yourself the important thing one of the important things that we must master master how many please you guys there's things that the christian has the master you gotta master it remember this and especially you young preachers and land members alike there's one thing that you've got to master if you expect to fulfill god's desire in your life that's so precious to me this morning isn't it to you to know what god has said if you really want god's desire to be fulfilled in your life we all do don't we i want god's desire to be fulfilled in my life this is what you must do and that is you have to master human ability human ability all of us many of us we have seen people who put their hands into things and try to make it this way and make it that way what do you have chaos god's not in it at all folks if there's something that you just can't do nothing about what do you do you don't do nothing you commit it to god but other people are not like that if there's nothing they can do about it they'll do something else they'll keep trying stuff keep making it worse oh we're getting down home now aren't we until it's a complete nightmare and it does nothing but destruction it is not god it is satan not your human ability folks i have learned when i can't do anything about it put it in god's hands as a matter of fact i got to get to the place brother to where it's not me trying to do something about it say lord you see it you see what this is huh and as a pastor sometimes i let things go a little long people in church how can you let this go on how can you did you say that in the other huh how about paul's she had somebody follow him for a long time huh they said get rid of her do this together he waited for the right time you have to wait for the holy spirit to do it because if i do it i'm going to tell you off i'm going to really give it to you lay you down and cut you up and throw you out and spit you out that's what thomas byler would do but the holy spirit comes he says things in a nice way that's the truth and it's hard and it's cutting but it's with love so that it can be received how many believes that bringing correction one thing that pastor has to do is bring correction with love because if it's not with love some of y'all already know what that's like because i've done it and i've had to repent let's not bring that up again shall we it's under the blood but it's truth sure the thing about a pastor in the congregation is we're not going to be perfect until we get out of here huh none of us are going to be perfect if you expect to follow a perfect leader huh well you're just in for a real shock not going to happen folks by god's grace god shows me where my weaknesses are he shows me where my faults are does he you i know the areas i need to surrender do you know i thought about the altar call this afternoon it is afternoon after 12. to give us a moment to think back look back look at yourself look at your areas that you know that is unsurrendered wouldn't that be good to have a little altar call this money let me finish first shall we we must master the thought of human ability we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that god can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul and body and spirit i believe that every part of you has to be surrendered to almighty god everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order that he can work his will in you and in me now that's hard i know because we're always wanting to put our part in in the truth well i think well but i think get about five men together in a circle and talk about a subject what do you think well i think this the other one well i think that well i think this well i think that well i think that may be a little bit different we all have our input but thanks be to god that i am a preacher that says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus paul said that ye be like-minded how do we do that brother glenn by coming to an agreement my id ain't no good your idea ain't no good this is the idea this is where we meet this is where we come to well what does the word say about it amen then we can be one amen y'all are starting to wear down it's already 20 after only 20 after here i am that's my fault i looked at the clock you didn't i'm the bad guy i'm not supposed to be watching the clock amen a complete surrender all right i'm going to skip that one and go to the last one let me look over my notes i haven't looked really at him yet but i want to look at him make sure that i didn't really miss something i really want to speak on i don't think we'll sing that but it's a song that says perfect submission perfect delight all is at rest how many wants to live there i want to live there perfect submission perfect delight all is at rest i'm thankful some of us we don't have the problem but tommy can testify of how long it is that he hasn't smoked huh others said we could say well i've come over this i've overcome that and it's been so long and i've had no battle with it praise be to god how many believes that we can get more and more of ourselves so surrendered to god that we don't battle with some of these things that we do and then when you get to that place remember daily don't let it slip back because your flesh will want to slip it back huh where was i was somewhere it was at the dollar store and i come in there and they played my favorite rock and roll when i was out in the world there was certain music that was like my favorite i really liked that and they played and they come across here in my flesh you hear that that used to be pretty good that's what the flesh wanted to say but my soul says block that out huh block that out die to yourself you don't enjoy that anymore that don't sound good anymore huh daily die surrender paul said bring every thought that comes into your mind captive to the word of god when something comes in when the devil gives you a certain thought block it out right there surrender right there and you won't have any trouble with it because brother bam talked about how that our flesh i mean those sacha perfect man tempers patience memory reasoning all of that works in here you let one of those open the devil jump right in there and he'll go down there and root and take your victory from you temptation it'll take you so far and man if you lead to temptation it'll take you and it'll bring forth death amen you won't have joy rob you and all those places that's what i'm trying to say this morning you have to surrender every day amen praise be to god and let me just tell you this you know with what brother danny was talking about he says no matter how many times you fall you get back up i've been there i know what that's like and that's exactly what you do you keep on going you don't think you're a son of god you don't feel like a son of god you get back up and believe you're son of god again huh and keep trying keep laboring until you manage to whip yourself and you manage to actually yield and surrender yourself to god i believe it'll happen don't you i believe it happens amen but bless god brother sister johnny bless god the day that you overcome that faith praise be to god the victory when you actually overcome it you ain't got to deal with it anymore but everybody said it's like a jet going through a sound barrier right man every nut will creak and crack in the wings feed like shimmy or shake and everything but all of a sudden boom glory a lot of us have that testimony one day i come to the other and boom it was all done huh that's how it's supposed to be what they got just takes it off and then it's free sailing you have rest i'm glad that's over with i'm glad i'm done with that amen and every one of us has a little something somewhere i believe this morning maybe some bigs man i don't know what it is i don't care if it comes down to your speed limit huh i'll be the first confess that's you know little bitty you say little bitty no it wasn't to the prophet you know god said draw nigh unto me and i will draw an eye to you how many beliefs he's there and it's not his fault that we're not closer than we are it's ours if you want to get closer to god you're going to have to do the drawing you're going to have to say god this is not an area that i want in my life this is a bad place in my life now emily that's what we come to search for is fine are bad places so that we can go out here like brother joe's prayer believes a better person will we come in amen that's what i desire i believe god so what god's teaching and telling us in closing i wonder this morning as christians now notice the last one that i stopped before my closing quote he was so complete in god till god could trust him i wonder this morning as christians if we have yielded our own will yield ourselves so completely to god till god could trust us to a place that he has put us i wonder this morning of myself i like that preacher that preaches to himself even the prophet of god if i could be so yielded to god to god could trust me huh with giving me the spoken word say to that couple that's been kissing and sloppering over each other on the front pew and won't quit when you ask him two or three times get reason to get upset you have reason to be angry now say whatever you want to that couple that it'll be if it had been ananias sapphira the hands that carried your husband out are here to carry you out boom she fell down and died brother branham what did he say looked at him god i don't know i don't think he told him i don't know if he told him sure or not god told me whatever i say to you will be folks that'd be enough to make me pass out i'd die right there somebody told me that oh my lord i'm gonna die huh that reason to be scared out of their wits but he says and i forgive you i forgive you for that maybe brother tommy maybe we'll get to see the video on that the youtube on that of what their faces looked like after he forgave him the continents of their faces to realize they have been spared death maybe they came to the altar and repented i don't know it doesn't say that they did but still they should have is that right but brother brandon was at a place that god he was so surrendered that god could trust him with the spoken word elijah didn't do so well and they made fun of his bald head i cursed you kids in the name of the lord right and she bears come and ate him because god honors his prophet's word amen can he trust you can he trust you with that kind of power myself so you looked he could trust me brother neville could trust our trustee board our deacon board because how many knows that we're in a position like that you have power if you have any of your own abilities you do anything in yourself you will bring chaos a pastor the same way i get in my flesh i will cause chaos troubles god help me never i wanted to have a little more time but paul and this is something i have felt in my heart that i feel in my heart because even brother brown said he had this fear he had this fear i mark this when fear is okay sometimes it's good to be have fear if it's the right of her kind of fear fear god and keep his commandments paul said i come to you in fear and in trembling and in weakness motherboard said that was because he was afraid that he would end up doing something in himself something of his own ability or maybe he's put a stumbling block in somebody's way we as christians should be afraid that we do something that isn't right that puts a stumbling block in somebody's way how many is with me or it helped me to be a good example so that those that see what i do can follow in those footsteps you should be afraid of what you do you should fear be scared that you're gonna do wrong you should be scared that you'll do something in yourself and get on your knees and say god help me to stay surrendered don't let me do anything in myself trusted trees trustee board deacon board our members of our church we all have a place and we've got a duty amen brother bam talks if this church believes in a certain thing or group we should not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble then that member should never touch a deck of cards we don't believe in drinking he should never he should turn his head completely from drinking if we do not believe in gambling or smoking the member of this church should never touch a thing like that god gives complete deliverance and he will do it if we will completely surrender ourselves and if we will completely deliver ourselves into his hands then god can live on us the hope of glory and he can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way amen you love the lord i'm just praying about this last thing here amen i feel to stop there well stop there stand to our feet let's do that look at your life those areas that the sweet holy spirit talks to you you do things that you know you shouldn't do you don't come up to the word of god the way that you should see i'm not the prophet or i could tell you exactly who it is and what it is but i do know that god is right here he knows your mind he knows your thoughts he knows what you're thinking he knows what your problem is or where you lack where your bad place is think about it look at yourself and you know while we're looking at ourself even the prophet says you got to be careful about looking at yourself it's pretty depressing and you won't get nowhere you got to look to calvary but before you can fix something you got to see what the problem is as you look at yourself and you realize you're not where you ought to be in this area i'm not where i ought to be i remember your members and i wanted these closed eyes and so forth i want to say this yet that is brother brown talked about he says we have tapes on this on the conduct of the church and how that we ought to assemble ourselves together and meet with one another and he says you know come together and fellowship one with another and he makes the statement he says don't stay home and i know we have an internet here and so forth and i know because of the pandemic are held early they want need to be safe and i don't have a problem with that and so forth but when you've got perfectly healthy people that won't come on wednesday won't come on they just stay at home but so lazy perhaps that they won't get off their pillow or won't get out of their recliner and go to church when the prophet said don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't wait for those doors to open to get out there and to fellowship with your brother and your sister let me say this sure it's easy it's so lazy so easy to sit in a recliner and be in church all i have to say to somebody that could be a church like that and isn't you are lukewarm and what does god do with somebody that's lukewarm he doesn't want he spews it out god is not pleased that when you can be in church and you're not it's lukewarmness it's halfway you did good you put it on it on and i listened to a preacher but you wasn't hot enough to get up out of your chair and go to church let the people know that you love the lord maybe it's that maybe it's just in that area or somewhere else in some other aspect let me tell you church i as your pastor i want people that can if you can be home wednesday night you need to make it a habit four o'clock to nine o'clock is god's time he gives you all the way from sunday afternoon to wednesday to four o'clock but let that be god's time make time for god we make him for sunday morning most of us that's good we give god that but we have a wednesday night service if you can be you should be show god that you're real serious about drawing closer to him i understand the sickness if you're sick or something but people that are feeling well and doing well but just too lazy to come i rebuke that in the name of jesus christ you're not where you should be and you're not doing what the prophet said do what the bible said do that you ought to be in church now let's just leave that and think about other areas in your life this morning that's not surrendered and when you surrender remember when one military takes over another military they say now i want you to march over this way i want you to come to here or go to there this morning if you're not surrendered you want to completely don't do it unless it's with all your heart completely surrender every aspect of your life the way that the prophet said we should why don't you step out of your seat and come forward saying i'm coming up and standing before christ so to speak let everybody know that i'm surrendering my life this morning i have areas in my life that's not surrendered and i am surrendering them now bless you god bless you god bless you i'll tell you what i'm coming over here with you there's little areas still things that god's working on that i need to surrender i'd be a happier person if i just would you'd be a happier person if you just would if you just surrender those places that steal yourself your ability your carnality if you just surrender you'd have so much more of the holy ghost you'd have so much more of god you'd have so much more joy this is your chance this morning to raise your hands up now and say god i surrender to you i surrender to you lord jesus now you see us the international sign of surrender lord is to raise our hands we're taking our hands off of our life we're giving it to you lord we come to you this morning we bring our burdens we bring our cares to you lord we bring our battles and every all of our defeat we bring them to you say god we can't do it we have to have you to do it and we surrender our time we surrender our mind we surrender our heart we surrender our soul we surrender our all to you right now in the name of jesus christ we surrender lord to you and ask god that you will help us to fulfill your will in our lives by our surrendering to you lord and so that the neighbors will be able to see that crisis in us everybody around us will be able to see christ in us lord jesus that's what we desire this morning lord each one of us with our hands up god you see him everywhere we now surrender and we do not do it just in word we don't just do it in coming up here but lord when it comes to action next week lord in every day we are going to put it into action not just lip service but of god we mean it with all of our
