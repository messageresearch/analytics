sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art how great thou [Music] are amen praise the Lord amen good evening good to be in the house of the Lord again amen trust you're having a good week so far that'll be all for the music thank you musicians amen I tell you what it just feels so good don't it just to sing those songs of Zion amen from my heart knowing that the very voice that you have the very words that you speak amen the very desire to worship has been placed all been given to you by God it's all been given to us amen wasn't for him we wouldn't have any of it amen how many appreciates God Amen we want to speak on something we've spoken of of course before I don't feel like this is new but amen I was um out in my barn this morning and just kind of meditating on what to speak on and amen I heard uh a noise coming and I thought one of the girls maybe was had their little phone or something coming out to the barn or whatever maybe with some music on or whatever and I listen listen a little harder no it wasn't coming from that it was coming PL back from Micah's House amen and uh so Caleb was back there mikah wasn't back there just Caleb was back there and he was playing some music sounded like he was listen fixing to listen to a preacher or something and and I got to thinking of uh of uh how how that in the hour that we're living in how that people are beginning to worship God more amen and praise him for his goodness and and I be begin to think what brother Diggs had said and amen and and stepping into the vision and how that in this hour it seems like young people and you just hear about it and see it different churches of how people are really pressing in amen there seems to be a move of God going on how many beli there's a move of God going on people are getting ready because the amount of pressure that the devil is putting on people amen is forcing even the Believers to uh put on more pressure Amen on themselves and and to draw amen from the power amen that's available to them amen and so cuz Satan certainly is like a roaring lion if seeking whom he may devour but at the same time we're pressing into it amen and I got to thinking about this song Amen and this is going to be basically my title amen I I begin to think about that song Let the worshippers arise amen me as I was listening that begin and then the Holy Spirit just begin to kind of pour some things out that we're going to share tonight for a little while amen with the help of the Lord so the way that I've thoughted in my mind of going is I might speak about 30 minutes to 40 minutes and me and have at least 15 minutes or so of worship afterwards maybe now that's the way I think but you know it doesn't always turn out that way but amen so we'll just follow the leading of the spirit with the help of the Lord tonight would that be okay amen and I got to thinking of how much this really matches in with amen with what brother Diggs has said about stepping into div vision and and so forth thought well but this could be almost be part two amen of that kind of different direction because his was amen towards amen the blessings and the promises of God but this evening if you will before we turn the Bible let's just bow our heads and talk to the author Lord Jesus we come before you Lord Jesus thankful that be once again assembled together in Your Name Lord and knowing father wherever two or three are gathered in gathered together you promis that there you would be in their midst and Lord and we believe believe that with all of our heart father once again that we ask God that you'll come Lord Jesus and speak to us along the way Lord help me to just get out of the way Lord that you might use my lips and my thoughts and your word to convey to the people what you have in mind that you want to speak Lord and let every ear be open Lord Jesus both those who are present and those who are out there Lord Jesus listening Amen on the internet Lord we ask God that you just bless each and everyone that hears this word tonight for we ask it in Jesus name amen amen now I'm uh at first I was going to title it let the worshippers arise amen but I told them to put it on the internet as the song that the Angels cannot sing the the song The Angels can't sing amen and our our scene so to speak amen because I always like to look at it kind of that way our scene amen takes us back perhaps all the way Amen on the other side of the rapture it takes us all the way into the presence of God it takes us to the throne of God in Revelations if you will go to Revelations 5 and we want to read uh one there and then in Revelations 19 amen amen and we want to look uh when we come before the Throne of God when we come up before the throne after all of this is over with amen and we come home to be with the Lord amen how many's looking forward to that I believe one of these days that that will this will be a reality it'll certain be a vision that we step into amen Revelations 5 and we'll begin with verse 11 and remember this is the scripture that brother brandham took and preached on talking about how that the lamb amen took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne ain't that right amen talking about a strong Angel proclaiming who's worthy to take the book and to loose the seal so amen and on down from that then in verse 11 it says and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about The Throne of the beasts and the elders and the number of them that was 10 thousands times 10 thousands and thousands of s thousands amen saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and which such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever amen and the four beasts said amen and all the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen amen we talk about let the sh worshippers arise but here we find the worshippers falling down before him isn't that right amen praise the Lord over in Revelations 19 once again if you'll notice in chapter 5 it says and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about The Throne so this was had to do with right around the Throne of God amen amen now we know that there is a throne of God and I think I taught this on a few weeks ago how that there were three Thrones that brother Braham talked about it one was in heaven one was in Jesus Christ and his other Throne now where God's Throne is now is in The Believer ain't that right and his people is where God's Throne amen amen that's where he is and so when you think about this you think about amen uh all that is going on even now but here in Revelations 19 and again we want to look at where the throne is amen now in verse 19 and verse four it says and the four and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen here's the very same thing isn't it am amen and Hallelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his Saints amen so we see a call to worship don't we a call to praising God Amen and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and that's the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord our God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a rated fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated hopefully you have said long enough to where you won't get weary sitting for a little while amen praise the Lord I like that you know there's it's just amazing how many scriptures even though I don't perfectly understand it but how that me we can go all the way over to Revelations 18 I believe it is where there was an angel's voice that comes forth and he calls for us to come out of her ain't that right and brother brandom even brings that down to our present time amen even as we would look at this verse seven amen or verse verse eight where it talks about she was it was granted her that she should be ar raay and fine linen clean and white how many believes that amen even even the verse before that getting ahead of our eles he says let us be glad and rejoice for his wife has made herself ready how many believe that's ongoing am mean I believe that is going on presently amen oh my so my thought my my my objective my thought this evening is going to be talking about who he is and why the worshippers Praise Him amen why because there's always a reason amen amen and I truly believe in beginning here I believe that uh we're living in an hour I believe in this end time hour so much has been opened to us so much Revelation has been given to us amen and one of those Revelations I truly believe is that amen that we find out that it's all about him amen now a lot of times we talk about well it's mine it's you he did it all for you and so forth but if you really grasp that and if you really get a comprehension of how that he did that for you the response going to be that you realize that it was all him to begin with brother Braham taught us how that in God in the beginning that God had attributes isn't that right and in him was an attribute to be a father so when we talk about what he is and that's what we wanted to talk about a little bit with our help of the Lord is what God is he is amen he uh he's a father he's a brother amen he's a friend he is Alpha he is Omega he's a deliverer isn't that right amen he's a deliverer he's a savior he's a redeemer and tonight with the help of the Lord also I I I want to speak what I would have called amen even as brother Braham said whenever Paul was saying unto the Saints which are at Ephesus he was talking to a special class of people and tonight I want to talk to a special class of people amen and it's going to be to those if you're talking about real worshippers of God Amen we're talking about the people who have experienced what God is what God is amen praise the Lord and what he means to you praise the Lord and I like that word word let Amen Let the worshippers arise I thought about that word let amen what if you let something happen if you let a person do something isin't that right right you're opening up a way for him you're allowing something there's like a open door to it let it happen or don't let it happen ain't that right so let this be done amen so I read I I wrote some things down here but I want to read Revelations 1 and 22 and it says verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come amen when I was writing this down I felt like the Holy Spirit quickened to me that we're living in this hour and we're living in the hour when the spirit and the bride say come Lord Jesus amen and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely and ain't that right now how many knows when you get to heaven amen you're going to not need the things that you need now no so this is a scripture that talks about if there's somebody that thirsty come on and drink come and take of the Water of Life freely let him come the bride say come let him come even so I don't know about you but how many is ready for him to come on let him come come and even to call to the world let you come if you want to come come now cuz there'll could be a time folks soon that it'll be too late they won't be coming anymore it'll be done amen but we're living in the hour when even the spirit and the bride say let him come Amen to the world let him come praise be to God Amen praise the Lord Lord now now I said it's to those who have experienced what God really is amen I'm going to take it slow tonight is that okay take it slow what brings praise if you'll notice here going back to our scripture it talks about about these thousands upon thousands of people both in chapter 5 and also over in Revelations 19 amen it talks about all these voices and especially five and verse 12 they say with a loud voice not quiet but a loud voice amen so how many knows when we get a little loud well just excuse us because we're going to get a little loud when we get over there like brother kidre says you know maybe we could get a little loud over here we don't have to wait for it all over there no huh but now sometimes we get loud most of the time I preach I listen to myself streaming sometime and I'm like man do you got to scream to the top of your voice the whole time them folks is going to sayen he's always screaming at us well that's all right amen I thought brother kidre he says you know I'm a runner I'm a runner I says well I'm a jumper I'm a jumper I'm a jumper in the screamer amen oh my that's right everybody to on whatever the Lord leads you to do ain't that right amen praise be to God so we look at this and we see in the first voice that comes out amen when we qu when we get over there when we get over there what are we going to do what are we going to do when we get over there we're going to praise him for what he has done and for he for who he is amen we ain't going to have to preach no more Brother Brad preaching is going to be all over with no more calling to Sinners no more preaching Deliverance no more preaching healing no more any of that all of that'll be done with no more pre uh preaching message of reconciliation amen we have to do that over here but when we get to over there and we all gather around the throne what do we do we begin to worship we begin to praise him with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain that's the first words comes out Worthy is the Lamb that was slain and we have a song so that we sing many times worthy worthy worthy the lamb that was slain don't you just love that why we're already singing it but we're going to sing it some more when we get over there amen worthy the lamb that was slain why because you realize where would you be if you wouldn't have the benefits of that Lamb slain amen I want to talk about Deliverance here a little after a bit too am me how that he is the deliverer how many he's the deliverer amen but let the Saints amen sing Worthy is the Lamb that was slain Amen to receive power huh think about what our politicians and stuff do they'll pull every dirty trick and everything in the book to what receive power because they want to be in power but we say Jesus is worth of all worthy of all power let him have all power let him have all authority because he is worthy Buddha Muhammad none of them guys are worthy only Jesus is Worthy because why because he's the one that laid down his life for you and I so he's worthy nobody else is worthy only him amen like brother Braham said he says that God didn't send somebody else down you know no he came down in flesh himself made him his own flesh dwell in there fullness of the godhead was in him and he God died so to speak of course the spirit can die but just he made him a flesh so he could die and suffer for our sins we are saved by the blood of God Amen Worthy is a lamb to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing in other words he's worthy of everything honor let's talk about honor for a minute because you know uh the Bible talks about you know a son honth his father but you've not honored me that God says how many believes him as a father is we ought to honor him as God honor him as a father honor him bring honor to him bring Glory GL to him as a deliverer as a savior as a redeemer bring glory and honor and praise to him for he's worth it come driving down the driveway this evening and I thought you know God here we come on a Wednesday night we come to worship you we come to praise you because you worthy that's why we do it because we want to do it huh God is worth the sacrifice he is worth our time look at what he's done for us amen praise be to God all that he is oh my do you understand how it would take many services just to go over through some all of these things that God is but we're just going to touch a few of them is that okay amen praise the Lord amen because we love him it's about praise praising God for our experience isin that right because how many knows that's what it's all about it's our experience with God experience him as a savior amen let me read you a quote brother bam says it this way I'm going to read the second quote first I'm going to have a couple quotes on where brother baham talked about the angels and how that they can't sing the songs that you do they can't worship him the way that you and I do now notice he says now this is the this is Bible times he says since the holy spirit's come is constantly Bible times let me jump on down here he says but someday when life is all over this uh the story will be told up yonder in glory when the song of redemption is sung amen oh I can almost see the time when Jesus comes to Earth and the redeemed stands in his presence with uplifted hands amen how do you like the way brother kid says you know we ain't got to wait till get over there to raise our hands in his presence uplifted hands it happens over here it's going to be right at home when we get over there when we stand in his presence lift our hands brother baham says that same story Redeemed by Grace when the angels will stand a circle around the earth with bowed heads not knowing what we're talking about my they never needed to be redeemed it's you and I that needed redeeming it was you and I that Christ died for that's the reason we can sing Redeeming Grace amen I've got a few of those songs ready we sing redeemed redeemed Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb redeem redeem his child and forever I am am don't you just love to sing to him oh redeemed how I love to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb how many beli we stand redeemed one thing I want to say before I don't and that is we should be so thankful for the position that God has put us in for the place that he has put us amen what a wonderful place that we are at where we're at in Christ tonight amen my all right now notice here so he says uh that's the reason we can sing the angel knows nothing about it oh my my he says you talk about Redeeming Grace when our shoulders straighten up the wrinkles come out of our body amen old gray hairs all vanished oh my look at what he done for me that's a good question isn't it what has Christ done for you remember the woman that was forgiven of all of her sins s Harlot washed his feet and so forth amen and I think it was uh Jesus asked Simon if I'm not wrong he says who's going to love him the most and Jim say the one that he forgave the most so if you were stooped in sin and so forth and God delivered you how do you have all that much more reason to praise God even more amen I want to say something the Angels don't know what it's like to be in a deep dark tunnel of life amen and and no sight of of light anywhere we're you know living in a in a dark place so to speak ain't that right amen so to speak what we call seeing a light maybe at the end of the tunnel whether it's help or whether it's the train coming ain't that right how many believes and how many thankful for the light that it's not a train it was God coming to deliver you amen how many thank God for his Deliverance amen I stand here tonight amen because God delivered Thomas berer out of the paws of the bear and out of the mouth both of the lion and a lot of us have been delivered out of all of the same thing glory to God thank you Lord Jes that's why I'm here I'm here to tell you the devil tried his very best to destroy Thomas berer and his life and his wife and his family hello and he tried to destroy you amen but how many's glad no God we praise him because of his holding power he begun a good work he is going to finish it and that's why we praise Him amen we got lots of reasons to praise him we ought to praise him in the morning praise him in when we get over there it's going to be a noisy Place why because we're going to praise him before what he has done over here we're still held back huh how many closer to God today or tonight when you came to church and you was Sunday night when you left I like the amens that's nice but most of the time you might say well look I had all kinds of flat tires and everything else and I have a lot of trouble and I've just got a little blue here I need another boost here from church huh but aren't you glad that we can get closer to God because those things they kind of bog you down they keep you know because we should always have worship God and come into the house of God and not go backwards but keep right on up amen but amen when we ain't got to go back to work we ain't got to worry about any kind of finances we ain't got to about any of that then it won't matter if it's 8:30 9 10 11 12 Monday Tuesday Wednesday all we're going to do is worship God and praise God for all eternity how many believe that we're going to praise him for all of eternity for what he's done for who he is because I want you to understand I think the one of the revelations is we realize is it's not about what you're able to overcome or do it's all about what he is able to overcome and do through you all you got to learn is to surrender to almighty God if you can do that God can do just some really really wonderful things amen sinner has to accept the his pardon isn't that right that's right so he says listen look at what he's done for me talk about Redeeming Grace you'll hear my voice I know you will W not only mine but everyone you'll hear their voice when they sing the story of Redeeming Grace oh how he redeemed Us and how we only have the attributes of it now we're only got it the down payment so to speak the earnest of it but someday it'll be full payment how many believe that we've got the down payment already of the Resurrection we've got the down payment of Heaven why because we are in Heavenly places already in Christ Jesus and that's why we praise him that's why we worship him let the worshippers arise let the sons and daughters sing amen what does the Bible say they sang to him a new song even the Bible says Sing to him a new song amen amen listen Aaron well I'm going to skip that one to say it next maybe someday when life is over friend I've often wondered what'll take place when all the redeemed of all the ages stand around when we crown him king of kings and Lord of lords when angels will stand with bowed heads not knowing what we're talking about they don't know what it is to sin they never fail amen how many knows we know what it was like to be lost amen and we are so grateful not just for a little while no we'll be grateful when we've been Tak 10,000 years there that he came and he found us how many believ that he is the finder he is my finder he's the one that found me that's why we can sing amazing gra house sweet to sound that say the right I once was lost but now I'm found don't ever let that get old to you we were lost you were lost lost but now you're found not just found for a little while how many's glad that we have we we praise him and we worship Him amen because he has picked us up he had found us and we're in the palm of his hand and nobody can pluck us out of his hand ain't nobody G to pluck us out of his hand oh my we're standing in a position where he has a hold of you he he picked you up he's got a hold of you thank you Lord amen and we're standing now in a position I love the position that God has put us in let me tell you a little bit about your position the devil can't touch you can't put anything on you can't let anything happen the devil can't do anything unless he's got permission from God Amen because even job remember he had a hedge around job he was protecting job is that right he says what you know you've got a hedge around him you had to give him permission to do it in uh second Thessalonians he says he who now leth will let amen how many believes that God is the letter he lets or he don't let and if you speaking about the Antichrist he said he only now lets he who let let until the holy spirit is taken out of the way then God is going to come and consume him with the brightness of his coming and destroy him with the brightness of his coming amen praise the Lord I'm glad that God let me worship him the way that I do I'm glad that he allowed me to come to him the way that I've come to him amen that he has found me picked me up and delivered me delivered you amen praise the Lord and now let us rise Amen Let the worshipper arise let us rise and the one thought that I had this week hope it does you good is this that God didn't come Jesus didn't come to the platform millions of times and vindicate the word of God for it to stay on tapes no he came so that it would get in hearts and get in flesh and that it would get in people amen and we God help the day speed the day that message believer that followed the message become the message I heard God send a message yes and it's right here may we come to the fullness of Christ let us rise and come to the fullness of Christ cuz he puts in the church five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints till we come to the fullness of the stature the full stature of the measure of Christ how many wants to go there Lord help me I want the fullness of Christ in my life I want his full faith I want all the love of God I want to be exactly the way that God wants me to be in every circumstance and situation amen praise the Lord all right let me finish this here they don't know what it like to sin they never fell they were never lost so they won't be able to when we sing Amazing Grace how sweet they'll have to hang their heads and listen wonder what that was like I'm going look over at him say wo Glory I know what it's like to be lost but I know what it's like to be found amen praise the Lord we'll be singing when the redeemed are gathering in washed like snow oh how the anthems will raise how we'll raise our Heavenly anthems in that City in the sky when the redeemed are gathering in amen how many we're believe we're in our soul now that's why we can sing that song and I love to sing that song we'll probably end up with that maybe when to redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all how will we all be quiet no how we will shout and how we will sing when the redeemed are gathering in why do you think we are we're gathering together now how many are gathering together the redeemed are gathering together and we're singing already we're going to be right at home praising him and worshiping him without all these chains of these cares that we have on our legs ain't that right this very thing right here is a chain tying me down amen tying you down this up here battle all the time with the thing up here ain't that right you battle with this you battle with that you always kind of battle won't be over there we have a glorious body like unto his own glorious body amen praise the Lord amen amen all right Redemption Song how many pleas will sing Redemption Song they don't know what it's like to be have to be redeemed they never fell they don't know what it's like to be lost they were never lost but we who were has been lost have been found and redeemed and claimed back and brought out of the devil's pawn shop by the glory of Jesus Christ how many believes that we were once held everyone in here we were once held by the devil and you couldn't get free you couldn't quit sin you couldn't do it if you tried how many believes that God had to come down to you personally and reveal himself to you and set you free that's why we're going to praise him that's why we rise and worship him because he set you free you couldn't come out amen I'm going to jump over a little bit on a different thought for just a minute but I'll come back with the help of the Lord I wrote down here and you know may our children and their children experience Our God how many prays for your children that's right amen we pray for our children we believe for our children we teach our children from youth we teach them everything God's word says what the prophet said what the message said and I wrote down here you know if one of our children end up in hell they're going to say boy if he gets down there he says he they will be panting he says he says they'll say God this has been so rough and so hard and so miserable trying to get there because they had to jump over Mama's Prayer Daddy's prayer everything they had been taught every barricade that God put up and if you die and go to hell and you're going to go there miserable but we're going to believe that's not going to happen ain't that right amen young people listen you might as well give your heart to God because Mama's prayers you're going to have to fight Mama's prayers you're going to have to fight Mama's Faith amen that God's going to do something for you and give you a real experience how many our children have to have the real experience of being set free they've got to have their own personal experience with God and we as parents pray for that more than anything else let them get experienced sometimes they have to come to a hard way we don't want them to go there but one way or other we trust God will get him amen so that they can have the song of praise and be a part of those who rise and worship God Amen that's right we know what the prophet God said he says if you go to hell you're going to have to fight your way to get there have to fight fight your conscience have to fight every sensible thing in your mind I was thinking you know that the world is without excuse God shouldn't have to come down and discern your thoughts and intents of the heart and do all these things to get you to believe you ought to be able to see the Sun and know the rotation of the Sun never f m you should be able to look at nature and say God I believe you I'm good I have 100% Faith In You Lord there ain't nobody can make no ain't nothing can make that happen that can't happen by chance there's a God that's doing that and that has the whole of it if you can believe that God God will come down on the inside of you and transform you amen but God does all these things to try to get people's amen try to get people's attention just to get them to believe does all these things to get people to believe in him amen oh my I believe it's time for the redeemed to stand up and worship and give thanks with a grateful heart remember now over there it says it's time to give him thanks give thanks be glad give him thanks and praise for all the good things he has done give thanks with a grateful heart give thanks to the Holy One give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ Christ his son and now let the weak say I am
