TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But we're going to get into it here. So we we look at the life of Job here and immediately when we begin to think about Job, immediately what comes into our minds where we think, "Oh no, poor pitiful Job. Poor pitiful Job." And and our mind goes to a place of trials. Our mind goes to a place of hardships and heartache and pain and remorse and agony. But those I want you to realize tonight, brothers and sisters, those are just words for the result of the circumstances in his life. It does not describe the kind the character of the man Job. It does not describe anything about the life of Job. Because brothers and sisters, Satan may say a lot of different things about the and use words to describe what you're going through. He will come to you and he will begin to throw words at you based on the situations and where you're at in your lives. You take a person that loses their job. Satan may come to them and say, "You're a failure." You take a You take a person that that that that's been falsely accused. He may come to you and say, "You're angry." You take a person where things aren't going well in their life, and he may come and he may look at you and say, "You're depressed. You're depressed. You're stressed. You're overwhelmed." Do you see what I'm saying? These are descriptive words of a circumstance for things that we're going through in our lives. There may be times when Satan even looks at you and says, "You are a lost cause. You are hopeless. Don't even try. Quit." These are the kind of words that he throws out at us. But brothers and sisters, when God SPOKE OF JOB, GOD DID NOT USE ANY of those words of negativity. He knew what Job was GOING TO GO THROUGH. HE DID NOT use any words of doubt, but he said, "Listen, there is nobody on earth like him." There is nobody on earth like him. He is perfect and he's upright. He fears me. He is a man that is skeweth evil. Brothers and sisters, the devil may call you a lot of things in this life. HE MAY CALL YOU A LOT OF THINGS, BUT GOD calls you my son. He calls you my daughter. HE CALLS YOU MY CHILD. HE CALLS YOU MY LOVE, my sweetheart. He calls you forgiven. He calls you He calls you saved. And he calls you sanctified. He calls you filled with the Holy Ghost. THAT'S WHAT GOD'S calling you today. Perfect and upright through God. You say, "How do we get perfection?" Through God. Don't ever make a mistake about the circumstances. Don't let them the the the circumstances tell you who you are because the circumstances don't define you. It's the word of God. It's the life we live. It's the songs we sing that defines us.
