the lord that'd be good god bless you amen both here and on the uh internet everybody god bless y'all richly amen i want to speak on something that i just heard brother brandon making a statement that kind of stuck with me and i decided that i'd like to take a sermon on at one time amen and so he made he was preaching and he says he said makes the statement that sometimes preachers and sometimes people i mean they paint too pretty a picture for christians amen and make it sound like it's too easy and they make it too easy for christians amen and so tonight we want to look at the christian life amen i call it the christian life and how to how rugged a christian life is amen and so we'll go over things that we've certainly heard before but i just trust it'll be a blessing to you amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father once again assembling ourselves together as you have asked us to do in your name and you have promised god when we do this that's wherever two or three would be gathered in your myth that would be gathered there you would be in our midst lord and father we just desire lord jesus that you would just look upon every request every need the lord that's represented father we know that you know every need that's here lord and in the heart of every person we just lord ask god that you would meet that need lord and then father if there's anyone that you'd like to speak to we ask god you just speak the hearts tonight lord and minister to them by the way of your word lord and help us to be better christians lord tonight after we leave than what we've come and we just ask god you're blessing upon the reading of the word now in the name of jesus christ amen and amen if you will turn your bibles amen we'll begin with the book of hebrews amen the book of hebrews the second chapter hebrews 2 and we want to dwell on this for just a little bit here at the beginning amen so the idea is that the christian life how many knows it's actually a rugged life it's not a flowery bed of ease is it no that's not what it is amen and i thought i thought uh you know because what i'm going to say and and things that i'm going to read it's going to it's pretty uh pretty rough really amen and i thought since by god's grace a lot of the things that we read amen you and i aren't really experiencing i mean we don't see it in our age amen at least not yet and we trust that before some of these things happen that we would be gone so anyway we'll start with hebrews the second chapter hebrews 2 and first i want to talk about uh taking things for granted amen and letting things slip and so forth neglecting things and so forth and that you know before we get into some of these other scriptures hebrews the second chapter verse one through three it says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard at least at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great as salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen my god it is blessings to reading of the word you can be seated amen that word earnest in that verse one if you'll notice he says we ought to give them more earnest heed amen we might use another word for that and call it serious yeah we have to be more serious about what we have heard how many knows that as a person amen uh in a hole in a hole i believe that christians are serious amen amen now we realize that you can be seriously wrong you know right there's a lot of people that are serious but they're seriously wrong but at the same point and at the same time if you want to get anywhere with god or get anywhere period the one thing that you can't be is somebody that's just a gesture or just a joke or take everything for a joke and laugh about everything you have to have a certain amount of sincerity i mean believe that you got to be sincere and that's what he's saying here he says you know we ought to give very earnest heed to things that you hear not uh because we as human beings i'll tell you this right now as human beings we're the slippiness people in the face of the earth all right you know because if we didn't slip if people would actually learn from their mistakes all right if we would actually take things serious you would look at history and you would look at what happens and you would try not to repeat it isn't that right but how many knows that humanity humans in general have an absolute tendency to repeat the same mistakes amen no matter how much they know it no matter how much they've seen it no matter how many how much they uh you know you know and uh i'll tell you i mean it's just amazing how that people will actually do the same things over and over again amen because they don't take it to heart they don't take it serious amen and so we can look at several different examples you know because and i want to talk about negligence you know insincerity leads to negligence right negligence amen and taking things for granted you know people just take things for granted and so and they pay for that how many knows that whenever you take things for granted you pay for it when you neglect things you end up paying the price people all the way back in noah's time how many knows they they expressed and they uh really expressed this to the fullest extent of actually neglecting something that was vindicated and proven something that was absolutely the truth amen they neglected to hear noah isn't that right and because of their negligence amen they took it for granted they just took noah for granted amen and for 120 years god was merciful to them in that hour amen and listen so it says in verse 2 if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience right received a wreck a just recompense of reward how shall we escape so it talks about angels that spoke things angels would come and they'll speak things even in the old testament whether it was to moses and different ones angels would come and they would speak amen in every transgression amen received a recompense a just recompense of reward so whenever you like to hear and whenever you uh you know take things for granted whenever you're not serious about things there's always a great penalty that comes with it now you take this salvation that he's talking about how that the lord came and he's what he do what the salvation was that you know that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe him should not perish but have everlasting life now how many knows there's a there's a penalty there's a there's a reward that comes with not hearing the son of god and this gospel amen there's a reward that comes with it he that believeth shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned now what if the whole world would take these things serious huh where would the world be at if everybody actually took it serious was serious about it and realized that you know you shouldn't take this for granted because it is going to happen if you neglect it you are going to perish you're going to lose your life amen all right so i believe there's a level of sicilia that we gotta approach god with amen truly have to do so now notice um you know even you know you just take many different examples you know people just take god's word for granted they don't take it serious the bible says that in the last days there will be scoffers and that right there was they there were scoffers in the days of noah amen that made fun of noah they'll be scoffers in the last days saying where is the promise of his coming you know god ain't coming god's word ain't true you know what people say and that's what people thinking you know you know for since the fathers fell asleep all things remain that they weren't they're absolutely taking it for granted they're not taking it serious amen oh my but you know how many knows that we realize that it's going to happen it's coming it's going to happen so we take it serious tonight that's why we come to church on wednesday because we realize this world's going to end and we need to have our eyes on another world we need to have our eyes on what's going to happen if you know your electric bill is going to come due in about two weeks guess what you're gonna make sure you got money to pay for it you don't neglect it man because if you neglect it they'll come and shut off they'll come and shut your power off if you neglect to see and take care of something that you see coming in the future amen so we look at this you look at the storm in florida you know that man he just neglected it he took it for granted that hey this storm ain't gonna do nothing only thing he had to do is get in his car take his family and go for a little ride for maybe 24 hours because those storms don't last all that long you know just go somewhere else for a little bit but no he couldn't do that he wasn't going to believe no matter what they said he was going to be absolute negligence he was going to take it for granted amen he's not going to take it serious what did he call it cost him his life his wife's life his children's life because he didn't take it serious amen he was slothful about it he was he just kind of let it slip he let it slide you do that and you pay the price amen and i thought about that and i thought about how that you know we're living in a lay odyssey age we're living in that age that certainly has let things slip when you let things slip you just kind of become wishy-washy you become like a jellyfish let me tell you it leads to negligence leads to unappreciativeness i'm thankful must amen and you would be amazed at how that people will take their very life the very very life to take for granted amen people perhaps you know uh you know perhaps know that smoking is bad for your health but they'll do it anyway people understand as long as they're healthy they don't think about it but when it comes upon them then it's a different story and you know people are just not serious about it you becomes lawful you become unthankful now the bible says in romans the second chapter that you know there's a group of people that though they knew god they did not want to retain god in their knowledge but they became unthankful and when you become unthankful you beget let down on unappreciated on being appreciative of god that the whole world has done that amen we come and we're living in that out we're living in an age when everybody is just slothful all right they're lukewarm because why they're rich and increased with goods and we don't appreciate and i hope after tonight's sermon that we will truly appreciate amen everything that god has done for us everything that he does for you every day because i'll tell you now you don't really appreciate your health until it begins to slip away then you're going to see the the best doctor you'll get the best energy to try to fix your problem because you don't want that problem now unfortunately there's problems we can't solve like getting old and getting gray air now you can fix it yeah you can fix it i guess and go get hair dye and diet you know problem solved right but you're still getting old you ain't gonna change that you might change the color of your hair but you ain't gonna change the wrinkles on your face you aren't gonna change the fact that you don't have the strength that you once did amen oh my yes sir the closer the 60 we come the more we realize it amen y'all enjoy your 50 and 51 to 52 and 53. i'll tell you what you better do what yeah i think what was it my father-in-law said one time he said you know whatever you do you better do it before you get to be about 45. huh well i thought i was real pretty good at 45. i'll tell you but i'm gonna tell you whatever you're gonna do you better do it before 55 because after 55 you're going to find out because i know from experience that you don't have the energy you don't have the strength that you used to have i've been trying to get on a job at the house all summer long because it's been too hot you know but i've been trying to get down and i'll get on the fir and i'll go do one or two things in here here it is two three o'clock in the afternoon already i can't get nothing done anymore brother joe time flies so fast it is going by the day just fought you know oh my i get something done and do a little bit something on tuesday hey here's wednesday so guess what today we don't work we study we pray you know we got about thursday and friday saturday you know and then when we flies it flies but you better enjoy it because when you get up there in the upper 50s folks you are going to slow down amen but anyway that's just a tip for you baby huh but we're living in an age and i thought about this because i want to talk about the christian christian life the christian life and what it really is and what it really means because brother man says you know we paid 2 20 a picture for being a christian too burning a picture for being a christian and you know i want to just say this right off the top i believe that a christian goes through some really really hard things period all right but yet in all of them going through these hard things he is asked to be sweet and to be kind one to another to be gentle and to be patient and to be long-suffering to be meek in the hardest things that you can ever imagine experience experiencing in life huh and i'll read you what what what the things that jesus said you know we're going to go through and i thought about that why did we paint it so pretty and i thought well i'm going to take some of the scriptures and we're going to go through and find out what a christian you know has to face so let's go with me if you will let's go over to matthew we'll begin in matthew now there's a there's a lot of things i'm going to start with start with this but i'm going to bring out quite a few different things that's heart that's rugged how many bloods brother bam says that a christian life is a rugged life it's a hard life huh it's not an easy life like people think now like i said sometimes we don't even appreciate it we we we forget you know some of these things that a christian that goes with being a christians because of the fact that we live actually living in an age where we're not facing some of the things that the bible talks about them having faced all right for example martyrdom all right example we're not going out here and having our head chopped off and being fed the lions being burned at the stake are we so some of those things that you know it it some of those things it talks about how that he would change his strategy and rather than killing you if you don't bend he would try to become partners with you and get you to join them and so forth and with flatteries he would take many all right so let's go to matthew and look at the one one thing that's kind of hard and rough already in chapter 10 of matthew it says after he says a lot of other that i want to i want to i want to point out but we'll point this out first it says in verse 38 he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me i'm told that the early christians actually drug a cross around as a symbol of taking up their cross huh he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it now most of the time our concept is that look you've got to die to yourself right that's losing your life two aspects of this you can look at it two ways one is of course we know that you gotta die to yourself back then it could also be applied very literally huh that if you're not willing to lose your life and to actually die isn't that right if you're not willing to be kong on the cross like peter was that right if you're not willing to come this far then you're not worthy of following me that's sometimes let me tell you something you might not think so but you just try sometimes amen that when your flesh wants to have its way you try dying to it and let the holy spirit have it you'll find out there's a battle there not always so easy you don't get to have your way you have to die to yourself that's rough because isn't that right and then if you'll notice up in verse 24 we'll pick up a couple more things he says you know the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord it is enough that the disciple be as his master and the servant as his lord if they call me be out or the master of the house beals him up how much more shall they call them of this household so you know christianity is always kind of nice it ain't bad when everything's going good and everybody's patting you on the back and telling you how great a person you are but what about when somebody begins to call you a devil what about when they rub you the wrong way because i'm guaranteeing you this one thing that people's going to rub you the wrong way all right fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and here that shall not be known in other words you know they may think that they're getting away with something but don't worry about it it'll all be made manifest amen whenever whenever there's somebody wrong about something let me tell you something they would try their utmost to prove to the world that they're right but a christian ain't gonna do that huh you just leave it to the lord don't worry the lord take care of it so he says just watch you know there ain't nothing here you know we're not trying to hide something we're not trying to push our way or trying to force a certain way of seeing things amen because remember jesus was called blg bub and and and jesus called them of their father the devil said their heads of the devil amen so now notice and what i tell you in darkness that speak in you in light and what you hear in the ear that preach upon housetops and fear not them which kill the body hello but they're not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul and verse actually it's not here but i'm going to read it one more scripture i'll pick up another one huh i thought it was right here all right so john romans there it is in luke the 6th chapter verse 4 it says the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master [Laughter] how many of us always are praying to be like i want to be like you lord i want to be like you i want to be like you huh the bible says that's what you should be if you want to be perfect then be as close to what jesus was as you possibly can know that that's what i read pretty much there won't you if you want to be perfect then you got to be like your master that's the right desire to have is i want to be like you lord but you just got to be willing to be ready with what comes with that amen all right let's look a little another thing that's hard another thing rugged about a christian that's not easy back in matthew 10 again same chapter and we'll go down to verse 34. he's talking about who shall deny me and so forth but i want to come to this because he talks about think not that i am come to send peace on earth i am come not to send peace but a sower i mean when you become a christian you may have to quit hanging with the crowd that you're hanging with maybe the crowd that you're hanging with you're going to tell them hey i became a christian i guarantee you they'll probably say well we ain't hanging with you no more you ain't our friend no more you most likely don't have to separate from them they'll probably separate from you that comes along with being a christian and starting out as being a christian is you got to be able to this fellowship or get away from everything that ain't like christ he didn't come to send peace i come to set a man at variance against his father daughter against her mother daughter-in-law against her mother oh my gracious you mean becoming a christian means that you might have odds with your family yeah that's what jesus is saying get ready here it comes it ain't a flowery bed of ease because i'll tell you right now ain't nothing as thick as blood huh you know what the good part about it is it's a family can bitterly disagree but they still love each other i mean no just because that you disagree with your family and what they think and the way they believe or whatever it might be don't mean you don't love them i don't care who it is amen but still there's a variance notice he said there is there's a difference there amen that's right even in your family and a man's foe shall be they of his own household be ready for it your foe may be your sister your son your daughter brother sister i don't know it just depends on who's following the lord and who isn't but how many knows right don't persecute bride christian don't persecute christian that's right amen no all right so we find there in that we find that it is that's the beginning of some of that ruggedness that we face some of the hardship that we face amen how many of those like brother bam says that god never promised us a flowery bit of ease no no he sure didn't let's go on to matthew or luke 6. let's look at a few things here and over in luke what jesus said sometimes when i read these scriptures why i almost feel bad of how good i have it huh how many leaves you got it good let me tell you something all of us got good i don't see any policemen coming in here and dragging us out and putting the steak up and burning us huh you got it good soy listen jesus said it this way 6 verse 17 and he came down with them and stood well yeah and stood in the plane and the company of his disciples and the great multitude of people out of judea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre inside them which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went out virtue of him and he healed them all and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are ye that hunger now for you shall be filled amen amen it reminded me of what brother branham said about our missionaries that are out in the foreign fields don't have but a meal or two a week and they ain't got no shoes on their feet trying to spread the gospel and brother branham got all over us americans and we waste all of this waste that we have brother branham was missionary minded wasn't he he thought about that they were hungry huh blessed are you if you're hungry now because you will be filled jesus pointing to the other world hello blessed are ye that weep now for you shall laugh amen blessed are you when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner did they their fathers also unto the prophets huh so if you're spoken evil against you're up the wrong way bad things are said about you how many knows that's where the rub comes people say not good things about you that's easy to serve the lord when everybody's saying good things about you amen i might just say this it comes to my mind but you can never be in the hall of fame until you first go through the hall of critics amen you have to be able to take criticism you have to be criticized how many believe that i believe every christian that stands for the right thing is going to be criticized by somebody you know one thing i see is that our government our government isn't shutting us down right now we're not really being persecuted by the government but there's still people that don't like you if you stand for the right thing nobody believes that if you stand for the truth there'll be people that'll hate your guts that will hate you it might be locals it might be somebody or article it could be anybody but if you really stand for the truth and i'm gonna tell you i think it's boiling up because i'll tell you people uh people you know they hate christians they don't want you to tell them anything about god and if you do they'll hate you this world is full of hate so he says but one to you that are rich huh that are rich brother brown says that the bomb in america is a millionaire he's rich folks i don't know about you but if i was starving i would go to the dairy queen if i was a bum i'd probably go to dairy queen after dark and i'd go look for that hamburger that didn't have a pickle on it that that customer came back in there and threw a iraq fit about said i said pickle like this doesn't have any pickle i remember don she was a almost a manager at a burger king and she found you know you know anything crazy you read it in the news right nowadays where people get hostile and slap hit the workers because they didn't have enough mustard or something what is the world coming to yeah you even read it in news where they got assaulted because they didn't have a certain something or other on their sadly but like mother bram says you know they can go in the garden garbage pile they have lots of food but over there in india and he says you reach out they can't find it anywhere they couldn't get it if nothing and yet you throw out all those burgers and throw out all that food just because something wasn't quite right yeah i'd probably be a dead bum with food poisoning but i'd find food somehow but he said we're rich he said even a bomb would be rich in america even those beggars is that right but how many thankful for what god has given you amen that's right for you have reached your consolation in other words you've got it nice huh how about lazarus was it lazarus the rich young ruler and lazarus you know laying at his gates isn't that right one had it terrible the other one had so much but yet he wouldn't even feed that man he was so steady he wouldn't even feed that man he probably said you know you know you could get you a job i don't know about you but i always make sure that they can get a job and work before i help them out you know but if he really is a bomb help him out huh if he really needs help and that man really need help he had sores everywhere and he wouldn't even help him and guess where they ended up the rich man he had his consolation remember in that lifetime that thou had stole these good things but lazarus he didn't have anything so jesus said whoa unto you that are rich now now we realize that there's a balance in all of that isn't that right nothing wrong with having plenty but if you use it for the kingdom of god well until you are full for you shall hunger one to you that laugh now y'all go ahead and mock go ahead and laugh but you're gonna cry yeah we may have to bow our heads we may have to take all that they peace at us and everything that they say and they spit on us pluck our beard hang us on the cross kill us 68 million down through the dark ages and remember folks that this persecution and this killing of christians went on for 1600 years is that right it wasn't around till 1700s when martin luther came that they actually quit killing christians the romans did that right they began to quit killing them they couldn't do it anymore because there was too many governments rising up that would stop it that would harbor people that wanted to have free for the freedom of religion so for that all of those years folks it was a terrible terrible thing that the children of god suffered folks you couldn't meet like this if you met you had to meet somewhere in private ultimate really private kind of like china right now isn't that right persecute you they'll put you in jail maybe even kill you for having a church service that's kind of what it was like for 1600 years that's why thank god you know for as much freedom as we have yet here because slowly but surely we see it deteriorating and we realize that eventually they'll shut you down they will persecute you eventually amen all right so woe unto you when man when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers unto the false prophets so we see that the christian life whenever everybody pats you on the back and nobody ever says anything bad about you jesus says whoa whoa maybe you're so doty and so lukewarm you don't say anything you know about anything no matter what anybody does they like you i like you you know but when you stand up for the truth people don't like you when you do the right thing people don't like you amen so we see that and it goes up for course on to saiyan but i say unto you love your enemies do good to them that hate you how many knows that's a rugged life it's not easy to love your enemies i wrote this down here and i said it's not easy in yourself to love your enemies it's not easy at all but if you've got a holy ghost it becomes easy how many beliefs it becomes easy yes it does because i believe that it has to be something that you do from your heart do good to them that hate you that does kind of goes rough don't it in the flesh that goes really rough to actually look for an opportunity to do something good to somebody that hates you wow that's a rugged christian life isn't it bless them to curse you pray for them that despitefully use you and on the hymn that smiteth you on the right one cheek all for the elsa other also most of us are offering my right hand right with the knuckles kind of pulled out right after one cheek got smit we'd offer him a hand for a fist here you go that would be yourself but that's the self jesus said that you got to die to even one place he says you've got to hate your own life also huh even hate your old life how many would say oh god i i hate the old time i don't want nothing to do with him that's right i want nothing to do with that guy i want nothing but christ's life but it takes a rugged christian rugged to be able to turn to the other one also if somebody shoes you at the log and takes your coat the bible says give him your cloak also can you imagine hey here's you i'm here's my coat here's my cloak would you like that too here you can have that too why because what's coming over there god will have ten cloaks for you over and him you ain't worried about it amen all right shall we go a little further okay and so forth all right so that's right and that's as much as i want to go there because we could go down here the whole way down and what what the christian life is and judge not that she shall not be condemned condemned not that she will not be condemned and so forth forgive and he shall be forgiven yet but i want to go to saint john if you would let's go to saint john i have a few more scriptures here we won't keep you too long tonight but let's just go through this saint john 15 and jesus once again gives a description of what a christian life really is what it's going to be like what you can expect to face 15 and verse 18. it says if the world hate you you know that it hated me before i hated you amen if you were of the world the world would love his own birds of a feather flock together hey how many know some certain people have you just pat them on their back and everything else you know oh they love you man they like it but rub that the wrong way one time a little bit find out what they're really made of because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you how many knows if this world is full of hate that's right there's a lot of people out there that hate christians amen remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will persecute you amen they will if you stand for what's right you can expect persecution if they have kept my saying they will keep your saying also amen in other words if they would agree with me they would agree with you but all these things will they do unto you for my sake because they have not known him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had had no sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he that hateth me hated my father also remember this if you truly are a christian standing for the right thing whoever hates you hates your god also he also hates your father amen all right let's go to paul quick shall we let's go over to paul and see what he says about the christian life let me um let me do let me read you a quote the quote i have right here before i read that last scripture brother branham and mighty conquer edmonton alberta i guess it is 1957. he tells the story of having gone to rome we are told that the church was progressing all the time under persecution i crossed the river and went into rome and i went down to the san angelos catacombs i'll tell you what if i ever went anywhere on a tour or somewhere in the world to see that's where i would like to go look i'd like to walk those catacombs i'd like to see those bones amen i'd like to see it because i know that's my brothers and sisters that gave their life for what they believed i went down there and while we were going through the catacombs and seeing the tombs where the bodies had been buried of the people that had died under persecution and at the corners with little short graves of course that was the babies i went over into the coliseum there i stood where they used to make the decision on whether the man was to die or not to die after they made him fight to the death and when he had decided that the man should die the gladiators would hang their thumbs out over the walls and would push the thumbs down that means or meant that the man must die one that fought the other one until christians fighting christians until one would be down and ask whether his life should be spared or not they thumbs down they and they would kill the christian and as i stood there my heart was moved and i raised my hands up to god and i says oh god be merciful the gladiator said thumbs down but i'm saying hands up raise him up oh god in triumph at the last day i mean those they love not their lives unto death over revelations it talks about thou shall have tribulation 10 days there was 10 10 years just before constantine i believe it was where hundreds of thousands that they killed and slaughtered in that way i mean kill them you talk about a bloody genocide just because they were christians and that right all of those people died they didn't have a good not like we do but let's remember when we have little trials when we have little things come up don't let that shake you we've got it very nice compared to what they have amen i appreciate what god has done for us now notice triumph on that last last day for you promised that you would do it that precious faith of the early church that was pure gold pure gold that faith of pure gold said the bible that was tried in the fire and how they would open the pits of the great arena setting like that only in the bleachers as well we as we would call it and the great massive place down there they would burn them up to the stake they would open the doors in the traps of the hungry lions and tigers and they would rush forth on a praying bunch of christians and just drag them from bone to bone and the faith of those people stood firm and in the midst of all that the church growed mightily all the time talk about taking things for granted we take how nice we have it for granted how good we have it we take it for granted don't realize that this is all just a very beautiful thing that the lord has allowed amen but yet remember when somebody criticizes you whenever you get persecution that's all things it's so supposed to be but ibm says and after constantine come over and liberated them from under the roman persecution and united to church and state together there's where we got catholic to begin with and when they did the church lost more grounds in 10 years than it had gained all through the persecution brother baby says if there's anything that makes christians lazy soft jellyfish lukewarm unappreciative amen is when they are on a flowery bed of ease but the man makes this notable statement we don't have persecution enough how many knows persecution brings out the best in you it's good for you trials just like trials are good for you tests are good for you i pray that god has brought many of us through trials and tests that we have passed that we don't need to take many more amen that's right but abram says we don't have it hard enough because it's always at this chain is strongest at its weakest link any man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his true characteristics will show when he's under persecution or pressure see if you can get him riled get him all riled and stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got temper it'll show itself if he's me congenital it'll show itself put him under pressure let somebody disagree with you once see how you open your mouth let somebody do you wrong one time slap you one time see how you open not your mouth and are like jesus amen if he's meek in general it'll show itself put him under pressure once and god puts all his children under those tests how many believes that i believe one of the big tests we have is lukewarmness big test we have is riches so much to be had and so much more to get until we find out maybe if our interest and our sincerity and christ dwindles and we become more interested in the things of the world amen rather than making sure that when we come to the house of god we have a worship heart of worship amen heart of praise heart of thanks for all that god is and what he does to us daily and that we have it actually better than what we deserve but god help us not to let this lukewarm just lay out and see a rich age drowned out your christian life let you become lex and lazy and dodie huh lord help us how many is with me lord don't let me get that way amen paul said it this way he says in ii corinthians 4 he says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed oh my paul fixing to have his head chopped up he kept his cool he was all right he said i'm more than willing to go up and have my head chopped off huh i'm willing to go i'm willing to suffer remember when jesus called paul he says i will show him the great things that he's going to what suffer for me i mean those if you're going to reign with him you have to suffer suffer with him if any man will live righteous in christ jesus not quite the right words but he says he will suffer persecution amen yet not distressed we are perplexed that's why i said at the beginning in the worst scenarios that we get god is expecting us to stay gentle and kind and meek patient long-suffering forgiving amen the sweetest people on the face of the earth in the most horriblest conditions how many believes that's what a christian is christian faces the most horrible things but yet because of the god that he has and the god that he serves he's the most gentle most meek amen one place the bible talks about just your steadfastness in the midst of those trials shows the world what you got persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live always are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal body amen god bless you let's stand tonight musicians if you want to come i wonder if with our heads bowed tonight if you would just search your heart and ask yourself this question have you allowed this laodicea aged to perhaps allowed your spiritual life to become dodie your worship perhaps to god dodie your prayer life lacks perhaps you've become lazy for prayer and for supplication and reaching out in the spirit you're not where you ought to be and you'd want to raise your hand to jesus and say god help me i don't want to become that lord don't let softness don't let this rich age that we're living in caused me to be diligent become lazy spiritually come to church and i can't raise my hand can't praise you can't lord really pull from the gift of god just kind of humming along just kind of going along god don't let us be like that lord jesus you see the hands tonight minds of god don't let me get that way for this what that's what this age is geared to do to the christian to drown them out in the cares of life in the riches of this world and all of the to get so bogged down in all of this until we become far away from you lord i'm thankful i'm appreciative lord take for granted lord jesus your goodness lord jesus for every breath that we have lord jesus help us to be real christians father like stonewall jackson i believe it was this talk to him lord and he was so appreciative that lord so thankful so close to you he said he wouldn't even take a drink of water without thanking god for it lord he wasn't negligent he wasn't wishy-washy lord it was because he was anchored in you and i play god in this hour lord you take each and every one here tonight on this wednesday night service lord and help us god as we repent lord if we've been dodie if we've become lacks lord and lord jesus realizing god you have never promised that's a flowery bit of ease if anything you have promised this death in this world lord jesus but we realize god that we're living in the age when lord we're not having to suffer in that way by god but lord we're having to suffer lord because of the lukewarmness that the devil tries to bring upon us and father we ask god did you just keep us on fire keep us on on fire jesus don't let us be soft don't let us be don't be let us be unthankful lord jesus not to be negligence and to take everything for granted lord jesus god help us to realize we're blessed to be able to live in the hour that we do to serve a god like you and you have chosen this lord not to burn at the stake or lord to be fed to lions but you have chosen us for other in this last hour to withstand all that this wave all of these lord this way that the devil has thrown at the world lord jesus riches and increased with goods and people think they have need of nothing they all think they're all right but they don't realize what's ahead but your people do realize what's ahead and they're preparing for it we're preparing for it lord and that's to meet you in disguise lord jesus before this tribulation period sets in father we ask god to look beneath every heart and every hand lord tonight lord we ask god that you would just help them lord each one that feels like perhaps they have become a little lazy spiritually lord jesus that you'd help them god to tonight before going to bed lord if they just go to bed lord without praying god met tonight they go home lord and may they have a real good prayer meeting before we get into bed lord thanking you for the day and thanking you for all your goodness lord jesus and for the freedom that we still have lord and the persecution that we don't have and lord we just thank you father for everything god realizing if we did have persecution law we know that the holy ghost in you would stand lord we would take it whatever it whatever whatever would be your will but lord i ask god that we tomorrow morning father whatever whatever it is that's causing us to be lazy we ask lord that you would help us to change things make a little change father in our itinerary lord jesus in our schedule father for we can't believe that we will keep doing the same thing and getting different results lord we ask god that you forever draw us closer to you father forgive us of where we're filled lord forgive us the word we relax lord jesus when we ask god we keep us on our prayer bones lord jesus and they close to you father as we walk through these treacherous times father these most dangerous times father we ask god to seal and keep everyone hidden away by the holy spirit in you lord keep us gentle keep us loving keep us kind keep our hearts tender lord don't let us get cold and indifferent lord jesus keep a soft before you lord jesus as we walk we keep our
