in uh what's in verse 1 we'll start with verse 1 to 14. to everything there is a season and a time to every that any purpose under under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant in the time to pluck up that that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh I think I got this off of it too a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones in a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and the time just to sow a time to keep silence in the time to speak time to love and a time to hate time of war and a time of peace what profit hath you any that worketh in that wherein he labereth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that that no man can find out the word that God made kids from the beginning to the end I know that there is is no good in them that and but for a man to rejoice and do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all of it is labor in the gift of God I know that that whatsoever God do it it shall be forever nothing can be put to it no anything taken from it and God do with it that men should fear before him amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated a time in life we have at a time to be in sin a time for justification sanctification repentance in a baptism of the Holy Ghost and then a time to Backside in a time to get back up again and what happens after you receive the the Holy Ghost tonight I'd like to speak on the subject of time to stand still in a time to fight for what God has already given you Psalms 46 and verse 10 says be still and know that I am God I just that those words right there be still and know that I am God I will will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in Earth first of all what does standing still doesn't mean that we don't do anything then there Comes A Time in your life when you repent in our baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and then you receive the Holy Ghost you you and you know what to do in life I believe that that there also comes a time when we want something in our life and we we try to make it happen without first praying about whether it's God's will to move forward with whatever you are wanting there comes a time when we try and make something happen and we forget that God is is there behind the scenes keeping you from things that you shouldn't have and preparing things that you should have I believe that God has defended Us in battles that we don't even know about God is always behind the scene in every situation fighting for us and wanting us to hand over the Reigns and and hand over control and stand still and let God yeah now brother Brandon said someone said not long ago give me a threat in a certain city and said if if you don't quit preaching Divine Healing we'll throw a bomb on the platform I said the smoke won't dry till I'll be in glory I said that's all right why do we fear my if God before you who can be against you you know it's written in the Bible it's better than a that a millstone be hanged at your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea then then offend one of these that believe in me signs shall follow them that believe me touch not my anointed do do my prophets no harm if you fight God can't fight stand still let God fight he will bring it to pass amen and he will put every critic everything the same deeply do you believe him Brethren let's settle down in faith no that that does not mean that that we stand still and don't do anything to tonight I would like to speak for a few more moments in on what truly means to stand still it doesn't mean to not do anything and it also doesn't mean to try and lose this probably am [Music] at this brother Brandon I'm speaking again it's probably a many man sitting here tonight that if he he'd done what what God told him a long time ago he'd be preaching the gospel somewhere do something don't understand still get out if if you're not uh if you're not a preacher testify do something somewhat don't stand still if you're washing dishes why testify to the neighbor and get out and pass tracks do something don't stand still what is it in your hand get doing something and whatever is at your hand use it whatever is in your hand don't stand stand still instead of going after what isn't in your hand there are always things in life that we that we want and things that God has all given us there comes a time to stand still and there comes a time to stand still and defend what God has already given to you children of Israel in bondage for 400 years they Stood Still and waited on the Lord God on the Lord God sent them a deliverer and Moses did exactly what God told him to do and it was time for the children of Israel to stand still and let God move through Moses and Aaron and and bring them out of the land of Egypt that and then when Pharaoh said to leave Egypt it was time to go forward in what I had given to them our upstanding still is having something to stand still in the children of the Israel had Stood Still for over 400 years and now it was time to move forward because now that they knew that that what God's will was when you you know that that you're in the will of God move forward into the land that God has already given you it's a time to go forward in what God is already given into you in a time to stand still a time to stand still and wait on the prophet to do what God Said us to do that the children of Israel were at the the Red Sea and God had told them that they were free and and now the army of Egypt was upon them and they said said have you brought us out of Egypt to die Exodus 14 10 to 14. 10 to 14 it says and when Pharaoh Drew and I the the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou uh dealt uh with thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt it is not the it's not this word that we we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for for it it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he today for the Egyptians whom he have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever the the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace regardless of where the children and were were in natural circumstance fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord why because the children of Israel were in the place that that they were supposed to be and God was going to fulfill his word regardless oh if we we would just if we would just not take any regard of what was going on in our natural lives and only talk about God's god promise I can't imagine Joshua and Caleb at the Red Sea they weren't the one we can't move forward they were the ones saying God is going to deliver to us why not because it made sense or because the natural circumstances light up to fulfill God's word but rather that God had placed the children of Israel in such a place where they couldn't anymore do anything in their own ability and now they literally couldn't do anything except to stand still and Moses told them them to stop complaining and stop talking about how bad of a situation you are in fear ye not and not stand still and see the salvation God was telling them to stand still stop talking about your situation do nothing except stand still and I will make things happen and most just put forth his staff because God said so and and God carted the waters and the children of Israel went forward on dry ground and and then then when they got across the army of Egypt went on this that same ground and God put the waters back and swallowed up the army of Egypt there was a situation where the only thing to do was just to stand still and let God fight their battles and just let God make things happen no one can and make make things happen and change your circumstances like God can first first you must be in the right place and that God wants you to be in in order to stand still and let God fight your battles God likes to put his people in impossible situations where unless they do something in the natural they'll lose or at least that That's what Satan wants them to feel when in reality God sets it up that that way so that we will have full faith in God regardless of circumstances even when God puts them in the situation where every natural element says they'll lose they can't they can just stand still and let God move I can imagine and Satan tempting Moses and saying you dead lead them out here to die Satan we are in the right place and regardless of Pharaoh's Army is a foot from the people God said and that he would deliver us it doesn't matter what natural circumstances say we aren't looking to what the circumstances say we are going to look at what God Said Amen now as in number uh 13 in uh 26 it said uh to 33 it says and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron into all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the Wilderness of puran to Kadesh and brought back a word unto them unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they they told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people uh be strong that dwell in the land the cities were walled and very great and moreover we saw the children inact there the male the male kites dwell in the land of this in the South and the Hittites in the the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell in the sea and by the coast of Jordan and and Caleb Still the people before Moses and said let let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it the men that went up and and with him said we we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we there Comes A Time to fight for what God has already given you fighting for what God has already given you is standing still in what God has already given you that this was the time to fight for what God had already given them they're stronger than us kid they're stronger than us Caleb said good I wouldn't have it any other way why not because Joshua and Caleb were thinking in their own ability but they were thinking about what God's ability to bring to pass what he had already gave prominent he he is the the word so so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes the word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man Josh and Caleb were going to take the land because they and they called those things which be not as though they were and they said God will deliver us they didn't care what the mountain said or how big the mountain was God said so they were standing still and fighting for what God had already given them at the same time it's a paradox how can you fight for what you don't have in the natural and stand still at the same time because when you move forward in faith saying hey not God is more than able to give you what that mountain instead of talking about how hard it is in the natural that's when God brings it to pass Joshua and Caleb had the Revelation that they really weren't supposed to ever think logistically about whether or not they could take the land all they had to know was whether or not God had given them the land and all they had to do was just just to stand still in the right place and God would make it happen too many times this the children of Israel got to uh stinking thinking thinking about the logistics of whether or not they could take the land when it it comes to the victories that God gives us we aren't supposed to try try and try and figure out whether or not they can logistically do it but rather say God gave it to us and that settles it standing ain't still putting yourself in a situation where you don't have to the Natural ability in yourself to win the battle and and you must completely yield yourself to God in order to win a victory and that's when God takes the abilities and that's and puts you and he puts it in in you and amplifies them and with his ability and it's the same as God speaking it's the same as God himself fighting the battle amen and cut every obstacle from Human things that they they they might be connected like in the Garden of Eden uh oh man I was going to choke it but this is brother Brandon speaking but I'm I'm going to say man man is omnipotent you don't believe in that but but he is a man fully surrendered to God as omnipotent did not did not he say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you you can have what you've said what happens then into omnipotence meet when God odd and man come together two omnipotence got to shake some what whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he's promised it that he said it in in his word it creates the power that that goes up yonder and brings things to past things that is not it makes them as though they they are because two omnipotents have met that there he stands oh isn't he wonderful amen Not Another Part of standing Stills is waiting for God to bring his will to pass and not doing anything to try to make it it happen while waiting this is hard for even it's hard for me to do in life it's hard for me to see what God wants me once for me and wait for God to bring it to pass instead of just trying to make it happen myself so had the same problem standing still is doing what God told you to do and only what God told to do what God told you to do not adding to God's will or altering the program because you're impatient but waiting on the Lord to fulfill his will regardless of what changes in life Saul was supposed to do and what Saul was supposed to do to wait for Samuel before he offered a burnt offering watch as Satan and stacks natural circumstances against Saul to try and get him to alter the program of God and not stand still and wait for Samuel regardless of any timing or of any anything the whole thing was a test to see whether or not Saul would wait on the Lord regardless of circumstances and that that told him to hurry up and offer the burnt sacrifice 1 Samuel 13 8 and 14 says and he tarries seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but Samuel came not to to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and Saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me in peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the offering behold Samuel came and and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Samuel said what has thou done and and Saul said because I saw that that the people were scattered from me that thou camest not within the day and days appointed in that Philistine the Philistines gathered themselves together at uh Mitch Match that therefore said I the the Philistines will will come down now upon me to gilgal and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done foolishly thou Hast not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God can you imagine uh Saul offering a burnt offering and hasn't done the and what God had commanded him to do even though it seemed like a good gesture which he commanded thee and now what would the Lord have established that Kingdom upon Israel for forever I I like the the film of David what when Saul says well I had to do something I I can imagine it's all saying to Samuel so I'm just supposed to wait for God even if the enemy surrounds me I'm just supposed to stand still and wait for God when it makes sense to alter God's program I'm just supposed to stand still and wait on God even if the Philistines are charging at me it was time for Saul to stand still and let God fight his battles for him I I believe that the Philistines would have attacked the camp I saw was waiting on Samuel to get there and and what would have just prayed to God and when they were running at him with swords and shields said said Lord you you said to stand still and wait on on Samuel before I offer the sacrifice I will do so I believe God would have sent lightning from Heaven to in order to stop those Philistines God wanted to see if if Saul would stand still even when Saul could win the victory without God but but um but now that thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord hath that sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou Hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee then then God gave Saul another chance and Saul didn't attack it enough so Saul went from one extreme to another one Samuel uh 15 to 2-3 says thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember there that which Emily did it into Israel how he laid wait for him in in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and she camel and asked one Samuel 15 13 says and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I I have performed the Commandment of the Lord and and Samuel said and what meaneth then then this bleeding of the the sheep in mind he used and the loading at The Oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them from the male kites for the people spared the the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and and the rest we have utterly destroyed and Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on wherefore then did thou not obey the voice of the Lord but but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel yeah I've obeyed the voice of the Lord and and have gone in the way the Lord sent me and have brought a gag the the king of amalekites ml account and and have utterly destroyed the male amalekites but but the the sport but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief the the things which got which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and kill gal and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is rather and is better than sacrifice into heart hearken and then then the fat of rams for a billion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the the word of the Lord he hath also rejected thee from being King Saul had a problem standing still in what God had given him and wanted to instead go on on what what he thought instead of standing still and what God had told him to do in in um 11 Samuel um second Samuel 11 and and uh one one to verse two it says and it came to pass after the year was expired at the the time when when kings go forth to battle and David sent Joe up and he and his servants with him in All Israel and they destroyed the children of Amon and besieves rabba but Terror but David Terry still at Jerusalem at a time when David was supposed to be fighting for what God had already given him David got got to trying to alter God's program and get something in his own ability instead of um standing still and letting God fight his battles for him in verse two it says and and it came to pass in an evening time that David arose from off of his bed and walked upon the roof of the the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon we all know this story David didn't stand still in what God had already given him but when confronted with it David humbled himself and Stood Still In what God had already given him David said I have sinned against the Lord and that was all David didn't stand still but when he made that mistake he repented the right way and then Stood Still and let God God make things happen and he he had a son named Solomon David did much worse than what Saul did what was the difference how they repented Saul repented and and so so called and didn't want to stand still David repented and said that he had sinned and didn't add justification to his repentance he said that I have sinned against the Lord and then shut up second Samuel of um chapter 12 and 13 says and David said unto Nathan I have sinned and against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also has put away thy sin and thou shalt not die that child that child died though need to stand still in what God had given him took that permissive will and turned it into his perfect will and date and David after or that he had a son named Solomon and what what can I learn from that what can I learn from that fight for what God has already given me and stop trying to make extra things happen God has already given me many things to fight for in my life and and many things to stand still in what and let God move in them and that's what I need to do two and and when natural circumstances say it can't happen that's when I need to say that God gave me gave this to me and whether or not it lines up in an actual realm God's God so and God will bring it to pass and all I need to do is stop worrying about what I don't have I get back to fighting for what I already have amen I believe that that worry is a form a form of sin worries praying to the devil praying is when when you thank God for what you already have and call all those things which be not as though they were in the in the positive and and Satan takes that and converts faith into worry believe that as Satan always tries to get us the war against to to start thinking into it to ourselves of that that I I gotta go and do something and and keep trying to push towards something that and we when we do that we when we do something outside of God's will I'll try to make something happen that God wants us to stand still and trust in him when we try to to get ourselves ourselves and try to do it ourselves and try to put push towards a place where we're like I'm I'm tired of waiting let me let me try and I I fell into this many many times and let me see what I can do it and keep trying to uh push for something and and keep trying to go after something when God said to stand still when when you know oh deep down that you're supposed to stand still and believe and stand still and trust that God will bring it to pass that God would will oh oh oh that God will bring it to pass to us no matter what uh and and when is our duty to stand still and believe the word in that place that we should stand still and wait and we go out and try to make it happen ourselves have faith stand still and fight for what God has already given you and God will make everything else come to pass in his time Proverbs 3 3 verse 5 then to six trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thy known understanding and all thy paths acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy past look at amen God will direct your paths we need to stop worrying about what's going to happen in the next few years stop trying to Satan always builds up this word this word what's going to happen what's going to happen in the future and what's going to happen we try to try our best to make this and that happen and do this and and and try to build our our own future outside of what what got it uh what we know that God wants us to do and when we do that we can we decided God's perfect willing into his permissive will like just like David did just uh just like sold it what what just like Saul did what he thought thought it would be a good idea to to go and and outside of God's perfect will when it seemed like he should get a fight we went here if he just said Stood Still he would the Philistines would overcome him and and attack him and and and kill him in his his army but but yet God God told him to stand still and wait for Samuel but he didn't it's so it's uh so even when when everything it looks like it's going against you everything around you is is going against you when God told you to stand still and God told you to wait on him well wait wait on Samuel until to arrive before wait on Samuel to arrive and and then and but but Saul refused to do that because Saul was scared so so sometimes feel if fear will get to us that we that we act in fear because we don't know what what God's doing what we don't know what God's gonna do so we act in fear and say that let me just do this let me just do that when God says stand still I will fight your battles amen now look look at the center of my way woman God promised her her a son now now I can see her her husband put that little old side nights and he helped her and and she put her lip in there and lifted her up she she said on the little old donkey and and pushed a little shawl across her face kiss him goodbye and brushed his tear him air back and said don't don't cry don't don't you cry mother what's the matter don't you don't you cry what well well you how are you taking it so lightly dear um my my heart feels the same as yours but there's something happened there's something in me that tells me I must see the man of God right away and she said and to the servant they led the mules the the music course and said no no you run along in front and and don't you even stop to check up unless I tell you on on up she went I can see her her going around just trying on this little mule singing the praise of God oh my and an old Elisha set back there and been reading this the scroll on the scroll down down and you know what all had taken place setting back there gehazi I think that's how you pronounce the name I'm not sure but we'll just go with gehazi studying at the the door nodding I can see Elisha rub his eyes and look out he said gehazi yes master he he jumped up said here here comes the Shona might go see what what she wants ask her if everything's well with her and her husband and her child so God honestly went out a little little piece that said is all well with thee is is all well with thy husband is all well with the child what what you're going to say sister what what you're going to say well well now if I'm counting on intellects I say oh merciful god oh My Baby's Gone but there's something down in me says say something different she she said all is well amen amen everything 's all right oh my that ain't casting down reasonings that that's making in the world that calls ridiculous that's what science would say was crazy but she got what what she asked for so what difference does it make she said everything's all right everything's just perfectly all right and amen and she spoke in power and and said as things as if it and he was already well because she believed that that man of God would raise her child up she because she believed because she believed with all her heart and and spoke things as if if they already were she got what she got what what she was looking for amen she said I stand still and fight for what God has already given me she didn't let natural circumstances change her demeanor at all God promised her the son and nothing was going to make her her say oh is not well the baby is already a dead thought all is well all is well is not meant to be based on natural circumstances it's based on God's ability to bring it to pass talking to someone that asked how it what what how I was doing and even though in the natural it wasn't that great I was I said that I was it was great because that's what God would say when you don't know what what to do or say don't think about how big a mountain is don't think about how hard the trial is or what what your mind is telling you think what what God would say if I asked him whether or not everything will be all right there is no natural circumstance that can stand against God [Music] amen and if if we get to that place where we're looking to what what God would say what God can do and wait we know that that God is able to and you speak things uh you speak to that mountain and you you say hey tell that mountain to move it will move because because it is thus saith the Lord because just as brother Branham to M said it is it is not not me speaking Inc but it is God speaking through me if we if you is speak to that mountain speak to your mountain and say say be thou remove and not doubt in your heart it shall come to pass if you if you have the Holy Ghost within you that is that is God speaking through you and you and you speak with authority and you just tell that mountain and and you tell us that to get thee behind me Satan I'm not gonna doubt today I'm not going going to to give into your lies I'm not gonna worry about it I I'm just going to speak things as a in the natural they aren't but I'm gonna speak things as if they are amen and there there is no natural circumstance that can stand again Mark 5 and 13 verse 35 too so 43 says while he gets and yet speak that came from the ruler of the synagogue how how certain and which said thy daughter is dead why trouble us out of the master any further as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and he he refers he suffered no man to follow him say Peter and James and John the brother of James and he they come into the house of the the ruler of the the synagogue and seat the tumult and and then that wept and wailed greatly and what when he was coming he he saith unto them why maketh ye this Ado and Weep the damn soul is not dead but sleepeth and they and they laughed in this corn but but when he had put them all out he he take it the father and the mother of the the damsel excuse me and and then that where with him and entereth in in where the damself was lying and he took the dams up by the hand and said unto her uh excuse my pronunciation talitha uh Kumai which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and and straight away the damself rose and walked for she was at the age of 12 year years and they were astonished with great astonishment and and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that that something should be given her to eat it doesn't matter what the circumstances are we aren't supposed to try and figure out how to make God's will come to pass we're not supposed to fight for we're supposed we're supposed to fight for what we already have and let God fight for what what we don't have if we try and make things happen on our own we will mess things up yeah God can make things happen better than we can every single time now Daniel what what do you mean if I want a certain something to happen in my life and I truly believe that it is God's will to happen the best way I can make it happen is I fight for what I already have read read my Bible and pray and listen to the prophet of God every single day work hard at work and spend time with the family that God has already given me and stand still and fight for what I already have and if God if it's God's will God will make it happen and I don't need to worry about it truly standing and still is giving the Reigns to God for him to make things happen according to what his will is and not my will strengthened everything that I have and and God will bring the rest to pass and if it and if it isn't his will good if something is God's will then God will bring it to pass and not me amen musicians if you'll come I'm thinking of a Great Hero that's too too often forgot about in our reader met many of you men and women about out those brother Primus we can't believe we'll be able to remember him it happened in Switzerland many years ago Switzerland what was some Germans that went up there in the mountains they didn't want war they just went up to be a peace loving people and that they are still a peace loving people and one one day when the aliens come in they were going to take their land from them the Swiss and from their home and come down into The Valleys to meet their oncoming Army and oh it must have been one pitiful site that that day to see a handful of little Swiss backed up against the mountains with clubs and sticks in it and rocks and old um uh I'm forgive me my pronunciation um uh Sith or Scythe blades to fight with and and some and and coming to meet them coming Army so great that it was so perfectly trained till like to look like it breaks up every man for fully covered by God great great long trained Spears in front of them every man perfectly in step and and hear the little Swiss stood not knowing what what to do and finally there was a young fellow stepped up by the name of Arnold forget my pronunciation of his name um ride vehicle read German name I can tell would know how to say and he said man of Switzerland and this day I'm going to give my life for for my nation he said and hit this morning over across the mountain I kissed my wife goodbye and my three little children for the last time I'll never see them again and he said I want you all to look after them in this day but this day I must give my life for Switzerland and they said Arnold Von winkleride what will you do he said you just follow me and fight with all you've got found until he found the very deepest spot of the Spears and he raised on toward heaven and and screamed at the top of his voice Make Way for Liberty and and he started running and he screamed again Make Way for Liberty and as he rushed towards the army with his hands up in it and his open bosom and to the spears more than a hundred Spirit weeks for him and he grabbed them and with his arms and throwed them into his bosom and there died with those Spears and his brothers I'm such a gallon display of heroism routed at the aliens and and they they went to Pieces but and the Swiss running in their clubs and and beat the Army out of the nation and and they've never had a war since real Victory a real conquer it's a seldom ever ever compared and never exceeded such a display of heroism the Lord Jesus Christ already gave you and I live victory over everything so instead of worrying about out and fighting for what you don't have still and fight for what God has already if you're worried about the outcome of something that you can't change then fight for the outcome of of something that that you can change make happen and what what you can make happen and what what can can what can you make happen and what can't can you make happen you can have a positive attitude excuse me okay excuse me that hey I got technical issues here okay I'll go back to it if I'm of something you can't change then fight for the outcome of something that you can change make happen what you can and make happen what can what can you make happen you can have a positive attitude you can pray and you can you can listen to a tape you can read your Bible you can and give a loved one and a hug instead of worrying about what you don't have stand still and thank God and strengthen what what you already do have and if the other thing that you're hoping for is God's will then just stand still and let God make it happen amen stand me with me if you will let's pray Lord God Lord God I pray and pray Lord every battle that and we're going through if anyone's going through any bad pray
