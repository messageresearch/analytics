TRANSCRIPT
========================================
true history maybe brother joe will open us in prayer uh the children can be dismissed for sunday school we'll turn the scripture to psalms 119. we're going to read one through 16. blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgment wherewithal shall young men cleanse his way by taking heed there unto according to thy word word have a hidden mine heart that i might not sin against thee with my lips have i declared all the judgments out of thy mouth i will meditate meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways i will delight myself and thy statutes i will not forget that word god bless you may be seated brother brian yes brother troy's being nice to us we didn't read that whole song you know uh in some hebrew to traditions as a young man you've got to be able to recite the whole the whole song but you can't be born mistered until you can recite that whole song so i guess we get off easy i i was gonna before i get started since this is the first sunday in august i'll let brother thomas talk about it but i've expanded everything that was been given for missionary offering and i and i sent it up to uh by believers church he can explain to you how he how he set up the offering so that was a like i told you a couple weeks ago we gave a 700 check to one of the brothers going overseas and then i sent a 7 300 check to bible believers for the missions that he dedicated as of this morning after the payment goes in the principal amount left on the church will be 86 000 and about 877 dollars and i just want to let you know this month in august and going into september so that means the payment for one september or the 10th of september in october i'll probably stick to the traditional payment because there's a lot of expenses that come out of the church uh these next couple of months and some of those expenses are insurances due by the 30th of september and the lord has blessed us enough without paying you know the slight interest payment if you do it in the quarterly assessments i've been able to pay it off but including the liability in the building it's depending on any year it's anywhere from 38 to 39 hundred dollars and then we have the summer and winter fill that i do for the heat and that's just right around the corner now and usually depending on what we have left from the last year last year we only had like we had we didn't spend it all we had like just shy of 300 so i'll just add to that and it usually takes about anywhere from 28 to 3 800 to get through a winter season with the propane that's both for this building and the fellowship hall and then one of the other reasons why i won't make a lot of expenditures in august is because of the uh youth meetings that were that were wanting to have in september so i try to leave the general fund alone and i was also going to let you know you some of you know this you can tell when i get really really busy uh because i haven't been able to make a deposit in four weeks so tomorrow i'll make a deposit for the la i thought i'd let you all know that i'll probably be dropping a deposit this morning uh tomorrow morning for the last four weeks so i'll be honest with you i've been extreme i'll be honest the way it works every time i'm doing the church books on a saturday and i'm ready to go to the bank my phone just blows up for the rest of the day it just it's just the way it happens sometimes but if you return with me switching it here this morning if you return with me to ephesians the fifth chapter but before we we get into reading i'll just read this first but you know a thought come to me this morning and i was just reading this but i'll read a few of these verses this morning i'll try to keep my pronunciation correct i know i read really fast be there for followers of god as dear children walk in love as christ also had loved us and have given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for our sweet smelling savior but fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not be once named among you has become saints and that really speaks for our day that we live in you know god expresses us to keep ourselves pure and unspotted from the things of this world doesn't mean that you don't live out in the world but you take you take that extra step as a christian to make sure you don't let it defile you neither neither filthiness nor foolish talking or jesting which are not convenient but rather giving thanks for this we know that no whoremonger or unclean person or covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god and i was i wrote this up thought down this morning and uh i was just thinking of the age that we live in every i wrote down some scriptures it goes back to the second thessalonians the second chapter and the 11th verse and it goes back to hebrews the 12th chapter and the 13th chapter with what we see this morning going on in in churches in governments in families and lives what's going on god told the people he told the hebrews he told christians through their messengers that if they didn't heed the word of god as it was going to be given to him they'll walk in the light as god gives him life that he was going to send him strong delusions and what we're seeing right now is those spirits shaking everything out there in the world there is no foundation unless you're in christ outside of that you don't have a foundation in this world to stand upon this morning and you can see it in government in churches i i don't want to be repetitive but you can see everything being shaken this morning that can be shaken and it's not being shaken like a earthquake a physical earthquake but that also means that also but in a spiritual sense and in a mind sense all the foundations that you once knew as an american citizen or you knew as a natural church not a real church believer but enough all those ideas everything all those truths are being have been shaken well you have no foundation to lay upon and it's leading the people in directions that you had thought that they would never go before so it's a really uh and if you go back to and goes also to second timothy the third chapter when it talks about the state of the age that we're in this morning we're outside of christ there is no hope for us you've heard the messages that have come from the ministers i mean for the last couple of months or the last couple of years and it's all got a simple proof principle to it you have to be in christ and there's the only hope there is i know i say that a lot i don't mean to be but i can't say it enough our only hope your only hope is in jesus christ outside of that if you're counting on anything else to help you get across that great divide one day just like it's not going to work but uh i'm gonna turn back here in my bible if i didn't lose my place but you know the the first thing that's been shaking in the world that we have this morning is our government is being shaken you have what it's doing in a government sense in a citizenship way is that you don't have any confidence in either party or in any direction that they're going because they lie to you they change their opinions they do one thing and yet they say another thing so that your trust in them is totally you can't trust them anymore you've been shaking in that aspect when it comes to the financial world they don't live by the same rules they want you to live by so they've shaken that confidence you might have in that you see churches fall and churches rise so if you're if you're just a natural believer or a make-believer you don't have no confidence in that anymore so it's made the world a neurotic place that it is this morning and the only way that you can have a pure mind in a sane mind as again i'm going to say it again but i can't say it enough he said you got to be in jesus christ completely you got to be sold out like everyone's been telling all the preachers have been telling you the last couple of weeks you've got to be sold out to vote jesus christ and him only but i can't you know i can't say that enough you know you you can't force yourself in it you just got to yield yourself into it but i'm just reading some of these scriptures that deal with what i was talking about this morning you know we all have to have purity of mind purity of spirit purity we just you know it's not it's a big word but basically you just gotta you gotta be what god wants you to be and you know i can't tell you what that is i can only think and know what god wants me to be um i'll just read i have this thompson chain reference bible so i can read some of these you know psalm 24 the third verse who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in this holy place who have he that hath clean hands and a pure heart and that's really important clean hands basically clean hands is that you you don't have anything to do with it it's everything that god's done for you to make you clean and a pure heart and you know that's what the only way you can have a pure heart is if god has changed the heart that's in you you have lifted up his soul who has not excused me i'm going to read this wrong who have not lifted up his soul onto vanity nor sworn deceitfully and that's totally opposite of this age people revel in the fact that they lie to you they they still harm you they cheat they enjoy it people out there in the world but you know that's not how we're supposed to be uh matthew the fifth chapter and the eighth verse you know this is the sermon of the beatitudes jesus said blessed are they are blessed are the pure heart for they shall see god and then first tim uh first timothy the first chapter and the fifth verse now the end of the commandment is charity of a pure heart and of a good conscience of faith unrefined and then this uh first timothy the fifth chapter and the 26th verse it says lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partake of other man's sin and keep thyself pure and when i when i look at a scripture like that that has to do with your inner reactions whether they're christian men or women or they're the men and women you work out there in the world with you you've got to be careful what you people try to lead you to do if you know it's wrong then you know you got to walk the other way i mean i know it's the younger you are i know that's a harder thing to do the younger you are it's harder to walk the turn your back on the crowd and go the opposite way when you know they're doing something wrong but if you've got christ in you leading you i'm not saying it's going to make it easier but it gives you the confidence that you're doing the right thing and then peter the first chapter and the 22nd seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit into unframed love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart and that's how you know everything when it comes to a pure heart deals with how you interact with other people you know that you don't you from a pure heart from a loving heart wanting to see people be better than they are at that point and then and then i'll just read a couple of these other scriptures that you know god's looking for us to have a spotless life in the things that we do and he goes on to say job the 11th chapter and the 15th verse for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spy yea thou shall be steadfast and shall not fear and then ephesians the fifth chapter the same chapter i was reading from this morning that he might present it to himself a glorious church not have a spot wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish and then james the first chapter in the 22 seventh verse your religion undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the followers and the widows in their afflictions and to keep himself unspotted from the world and i believe i read this one before but i'll read it again and finish here wherefore beloveds excuse me wherefore beloved see seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found in him in peace so everyone knows what they're at this morning god knows where you're at this morning whatever that need is that you have or whatever that desire god knows what it is this morning and if it's a pure desire that and and it's something that you need from god i know that he's more than able to provide whatever need we have there this morning you just gotta trust them i know that's people say that a lot that's hard to do i mean i i can raise my hand you know i'm not i'm one of those people that tries to do everything in his own strength and sometimes in my own way but that's sometimes i wake up some mornings or i get into doing something and i realize that i'm not doing it the way that god wants me to do it i'm doing it my way and then you got to be man enough or have that enough to say hey you're wrong and turn around and go the way that god wants you to go brother david amen you love him with all your heart let's stand and sing that course all my hope is in jesus this morning if we could oh my hope is in jesus oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins are forgiven oh i've been washed by the blood are you thankful for that this morning oh my hope is in jesus name thank god my yesterday's gone

praying that god will speak to our hearts once again and then you that were here wednesday night you were extremely blessed and i would just tell you if you weren't here to hear what god had to say

but i really enjoyed singing it and i enjoy it and i try to try to sing do our best and you know i was thinking this the word comes forth and brother brad preached wednesday and the different ones is

all the songs that come in my heart my mind this morning we'd be here for a while but lord what's pleasing to you this morning we got plenty to sing they got plenty to preach but what what is it god what do you want it's not what i want this morning the only thing i want is being the perfect will of god in my life that's all i want that's the only desire i have this morning because if you if you're a millionaire you're going to lose it you're going to die someday but if you have god you have everything that you need this morning and to be in his perfect will that's what i want to be this

sean be able to come back to church he's been battling that enemy trying to give him that cat's been scratching back at the door for his neck and just remember sean as you pray every day that the lord just help him to overcome that and give him healing in his body amen the devil don't like to take the word no he doesn't like the he knows he's defeated but he's going to keep on crying with all this all that's within him someone asked for the brandon said they said talking about that one that said yeah they had something good to say about the devil and they said how's that so he's a good adversary and he's definitely that this morning but pray the song service been a blessing to you this morning appreciate your worship and praise this morning and pray that god will just speak to our hearts and let's sing that little course turn your eyes upon jesus as brother thomas comes this morning all turn your eyes upon jesus in his wonderful faith [Music] [Music] in the light of his glory and grace god bless you my friend [Music] first days and anniversaries everybody has a birthday in august if you want to come up we'll sing for you all [Music] do right a happy birthday to you maybe [Music] happy birthday amen how about an anniversary wedding anniversary in august anybody get married in august all right huh it was too hot huh yeah i guess so i waited until some other time so all right well praise the lord amen good morning good to be in the house of lord good to see everybody out again this morning amen i told willie when i come in the door i said i got to wear a jacket it's cold out there well compared to what it's been that was a pretty nice breeze this morning amen praise the lord i think the next couple days is supposed to go down to 61 or something maybe it'll hit 59 i like 59 so i don't know about you but i like i'm looking forward to the cool breezes coming again amen praise the lord amen so i believe prophet god said we're trying to avoid a hotter place right amen so for sure um let me see i can't think of any announcements i guess uh i'm sure brother john i'm going to have a meeting sometime here in the next couple weeks probably amen and so i know brother luke gibson i think he's gonna bring a busload of kids i mean i was told this morning maybe around 50. so looks like we're going to have a i mean good turnout amen and so amen it'll have to something bad will have to happen for us to cancel it so hopefully things won't get any worse we are trying to be a little careful i know we've had a few sicknesses go around so i've asked the deacons maybe just not to greet anybody coming in so that anybody that would like that it would make everybody more comfortable but other than that we'll probably keep going amen i did not get communion ready this morning so we won't have any to lord willing after uh be septem october probably because next month first of the month will be in our special meetings so we'll probably pick it up back then again amen so we're certainly glad for what the lord amen for just knowing and having the lord in our hearts amen how many appreciates the lord jesus christ amen and so amen let's stand this morning we'll just get into the word let's bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again lord grateful to be able to assemble ourselves together lord having the right to do so the privilege of doing so lord and to be able to minister lord jesus according to the conscience that you have given us lord jesus according to your word father and we just ask god that you'll bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you have laid upon our heart to speak bless each one that has made the effort to come out lord and we ask god that lord brother steve you just touch him and raise him up again lord and anybody that is sick lord we just pray father just touch them lord jesus and we just ask god that all the different requests lord you know each and every one of them we ask god for mercy and grace lord and father now as we open your word we ask you to bring us the invitation and speak through us lord and speak to us the words of eternal life we ask it in jesus name amen and amen amen alternative you will to genesis 3 genesis 3. amen this is a subject i spoke on probably many years ago but i want to speak on it again amen genesis 3 and we'll begin with verse 22 and the lord god said behold the man is become one of us to know good and evil and now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword with which turned every way to keep the way of life now over in the book of ephesians book of ephesians the second chapter ephesians 2 and we'll go 12-14 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ he is our peace who have made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this amen i seem to be fading out a little bit i want to title this the barrier breaker the barrier breaker amen and basically we want to talk about barriers amen this morning for a while would that be okay let's talk about barriers for a while amen and i begin to think about all the different barriers that life has and there's a lot of different ones amen and so we certainly don't think that we'll have time to but just touch on maybe five or six of them perhaps but i got to think about the first barrier that ever was amen was caused by the devil amen isn't that right and the first barrier that god had to put up was right there in genesis you know right so he put a flaming sword and so forth and a sword that turns both ways he drove them out of the garden of eden and said you know unless he takes of the tree of life also and lives you know we all have to protect this amen you cannot come back into the presence of god and eat of the tree of life and live forever amen because of the sin that they had committed now uh and then i also read there in ephesians talking about how that god between israel and the gentiles that god had taken a wall down you know we know that it all is a partition right a wall is something that divides amen and so that's what it was with uh you know what what happened there was uh god had to put up a wall and but satan caused it he actually caused them to get a place of sin amen and and not be right with god and have to be separated from the presence of god amen and that was that was a very very tragic thing because we know that for almost 4 000 years that barrier was up is i right and i believe it was in the seal of god brother branham talks about how that those angels in that in that time in genesis how that they kept the way of life and kept you out but he says you know after pentecost and after calvary those angels now were saying come on in come on in come on in and that right come to the tree of life amen because that barrier was taken away in christ that barrier that we had amen and being away from god and it was a terrible thing because they could never get back they could not get back to where they were amen and i began to think about this and how that there's a lot of so many different barriers in life and i got to thinking about the interstate system and i don't know about you but i like the interstate system amen they created the interstate system and you know when you get going on a road you're supposed to be able to go from one point to the other amen and never have to stop amen not have to stop just keep right on going unfortunately today that's just not true is it amen because of all the traffic jams and everything and all the road work and they'll put up barricades and they'll put up uh walls and things like that to make you go down to one lane and they'll squish you in wherever they want to go and and all these things it's all it's a it's actually these barriers push you into amend certain lanes or down the one lane and then you get slow and so forth you know and i got to thinking about how that that's the same thing that happened there amen in genesis how they got forced into its condition into a situation that they couldn't get out of amen amen they got in a bad place because of sin amen now we know sin itself you know it is also a barrier how many knows it's superior it's called the sin barrier that god called that sin barrier now we'll maybe talk about it here a little bit later but you know that's the worst barrier of all is the sin barrier amen it's what actually keeps people separated from god amen and so but the devil causes it now there's a lot of different chara a lot of different things you know and and the devil he likes to put up roadblocks he likes to cause division he likes to bring a barriers between people isn't that right is i call it the indifference indifference barriers because we're all different a lot of times we we could talk about the race barriers how that there's so many different races uh you know there's a red black well i don't even know all the colors i guess right now yellow and white isn't that right all the different creases there is and and always the language barriers people you know people go to rattling on the conscientious of us because since episodes saw us in our vacuums for saying what team's all been we've got one hand to understand back a few there right but there's an area that if you don't understand that language it's all a bunch of gibberish and all right and so there's a barrier there but guess what you know it conservative cell and then all of a sudden i talk that well i understand that perfectly good right you don't understand one it's like wow that's what i like to hear amen and so we find there's all kinds of different ones but you know one thing about it is and god does put up separations you know right he does burn up some laws he does because god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief then we have also barriers of uh what i call the birds of a feather amen because as the prophet of god said you know that birds of a feather flock together a unbeliever and a believer have how much in common they don't have nothing in common why because the unbeliever he likes to drink he likes to smoke amen and he likes to cast up but like excuse me he likes to cuss and use terrible words and that's not something you like to hear you don't like to be around we just don't have a lot to talk about if you're going to talk about smoking or drinking or partying and all of that amen i like to talk about oh my didn't we have a good church service wednesday night then we have a good service didn't god speak see that's what i'm talking about and but the mother unbelievers they'd be like oh man i don't want to go to church you know because my man he's going to condemn me and down my soul to hell and everything else and i'll be damned and i don't want to hear all that you know and so that's why we have believers amen there's a barrier between believers and unbelievers but you know the thing of it is what i like this morning is that if we walk in the light as he is in the light huh now i want you to notice the word w-e all right we right that's more than one that's us if we amen me and you if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have what how many knows there's a fellowship barrier amen darkness has no fellowship with light light has no fellowship with darkness praise be to god amen and but the thing of it is if two people walk together in the light they will have fellowship i don't care how much i get at odds with you i don't care how much of a spat or a fight that you and i have i'll tell you what we don't talk to each other for weeks maybe maybe i don't know are you listening but i guarantee it it's one thing that if we get back under the blood if we get out to back walking in the light amen then guess what we will have fellowship again because the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness but now if i stay out of the light i see out from under the blood you might get under the blood and say brother i'm sorry that i did you wrong amen but if i'm not under the blood boy you ought to you was wrong that's right you were wrong and you're terrible you know now i gotta go huh on one part somebody's under the blood but the other guy is not coming under the blood because if he came under the blood he would say you know i was wrong too i'm sorry for this i didn't you know and then you'd have fellowship again but if one person does not come under the blood if one person don't get to walk it back in the light you have no fellowship [Music] oh my oh what a savior they're saying that's special about we have a savior aren't you glad that you've got fellowship this morning you know folks how many of us will say this morning that we were kind of hoping and then we're kind of looking and we're all hoping that things will get better we just love for inflation to come back down i'd love for a two by four cost twelve dollars but maybe three dollars like it used to huh amen i'd like for all of that to happen but from the looks of it how many knows that it's probably just not gonna get better oh we'd like for cover to all be gone and we you know we'd like to get back to normal but it's probably just not going to happen huh because if it ain't it'll be something else amen because how many knows that we're it's going to be at a time of trouble it is we're living now in the days of a time of trouble amen are you thinking about the united states in trouble therein but you got to realize something that this whole world is in trouble amen and let me tell you something like brother brown says there truly is absolutely no hope except for in jesus christ that's the only hope there is there ain't no other hope oh i was thinking yesterday's you know of how to maybe you enjoy your farm maybe you enjoy this that of the other but you realize that you're made out of the dust and you're going to go back to the dust the only chance you have is christ oh man and you think boy i'd like this to last forever but nothing lasts forever in this world [Music] it's all temporary all this will be history and it's getting together like this one day all billion it'll be history i was thinking back in the office and there's three ways out of it i'm getting somewhere there's three ways out of here huh that's to pass away before the rapture comes or to go into rapture or to have to go through the tribulation period huh that's the only three ways out of here but i don't know about you but i like i want something that is forever and lasts forever how many want something to last forever and we don't realize that that is eternal life that god came to give us eternal life he offered it to the world you and i oh my if i was if you've never heard it before if you've never heard this here this morning what i'm fixing to say ever before you would probably really get to thinking about it is that god offers to you this morning eternal life eternal life isn't that right to live eternally for things never to stop for things not to pass away oh my then when i thought about in the midst of all this amen really having only a promise of things getting worse because remember that the bible talks that it will be in a time of trouble like there was never since the foundation of the world that israel will be delivered tribulation period it's going to get worse worse and worse you thought the mark of the beast was going to come in when everybody's got plenty of money everything's going good huh folks we've got to spend more money we got to get in a tighter pitch i think they're about to do it huh they got to make it worse before something's going to happen so where they can bring in that mark of the beast nobody buy or sell huh but the thing when i thought about that when i thought about there is no hope in this world and then that you think that you have the god of hope amen that if you pass away you drop dead before i'm done preaching this morning god has a place jesus says i go and i prepare a place for you aren't you glad this morning that god's got a place prepared for you amen that if this barrier of this veil of this flesh drops amen you're going to come over to the other side of that barrier and it's going to be unlike what you could ever imagine how many knows heaven is unimaginable but yet we here keep our mind too much on the things that temporal and not the things that's unimaginable beautiful we take it for granted we're so busy with our fortune we forgot what jesus said amen oh my that was a good message brother and i brother brad amen i appreciate brother brad and his ministry praise the lord so listen so the devil causes all kinds of barriers my but it's a struggle but this morning i got to thinking about it and i thought about how good god is to us how wonderful it is to think that you have fellowship with almighty god that you're a child of god amen that it made me think you know lord we preach a lot we do a lot but really in my heart i feel like i just want to thank you lord i just wanna thank you lord for saving my soul making me whole thank you lord amen i believe that we ought to spend more time thanking god praising god being appreciative of god of what he is and what he means to you oh my praise be to god let's talk about another veil found in first corinthians the veil that god has put now how many knows that a veil is something that's perhaps like moses put a veil over his face so he can't see it it's a barrier that's what a veil is it's a barrier and in second corinthians the third chapter and verse 13. not as moses which put oh put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolish but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil on taken away in a reading of the old testament which veil was done away in christ but even unto this day now notice paul saying even unto this day he says when mo that the veil is upon their hearts nevertheless when it shall return to the lord that veil shall be taken away now how many know that israel as a nation was blind right they had a veil over their eyes and they just will not and they cannot see that jesus was the messiah can you imagine a veil that has lasted for the last 2 000 years and they have wandered through the nexus just like the scripture said they would because of rejecting the messiah amen they have wandered through the nations because of all their stubbornness and everything they've done huh being killed by the millions by hitler and so forth driven back to their homeland and they still oh my just can't see it that is the worst barrier of all it's just not being able to see it why do you think jesus said blessed are your eyes for they say oh my because i'll tell you what like like the prophet god said if you inherited a great big uh factory and so forth or whatever it is a warehouse and then had everything imaginable in there amen it wouldn't do you one bit of good if you can't get inside the building and that's the way it is with christ it doesn't do you a bit of good if you can't get inside of the building do you realize that people in denominations and so forth amen they can only go so far because they don't believe the full word of god because with the fullness of the word comes the full birth of jesus christ comes the full blessing of almighty god and israel could not see it they were blinded amen to this day they won't hear the gospel because they have that veil taken over put over their eyes how many of us gentiles we're not supposed to have a veil over our eyes we're supposed to have our eyes wide open praise be to god and that's what paul was saying in ephesians there he says listen that we at that time we were without christ we were aliens from the commonwealth of israel in other words god had a chosen people how many knows that that was his people and i'll tell you what he didn't deal with you he didn't deal with me i don't know if i was a greek i don't know if just what i was we were anglo-saxons but you know just what we were just gentiles like the prophet said we carried clubs on our back and we didn't believe god we worshiped idols and everything else in the book listen paul says that we were without hope without god in the world my what a terrible place for us to be and we had no connection with god we had no connection with israel amen but listen but paul says but now in christ jesus you who were sometimes way off are made nigh by the blood of jesus christ amen for he is our peace who have made both one and has broken down that middle wall of petition between us in other words he has broken down amen that divider that divided the gentiles from acquiring fellowship with god and like my brother said last time he talked about how that their blinds were blinded since you and i could come in that wasn't just for a day or two that's been the last 2000 years but one of these days paul said that god's going to take that veil away one of these days and then it's like trying to explain somebody some something to somebody and if you're like me sometimes you have to have to explain about the third time you finally get before you finally get it now exactly what was it did she said how would you oh my but all of a sudden you'll say oh yeah yeah okay i see and that's what iz going to do when their eyes are open when god lives that veil did you ever try to preach the gospel to somebody tell them about the message of the hour or whatever amen and boy even people amen who believe in the trinity if they have that evil trinity spirit you realize those folks will excommunicate and everything else if you baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ and they think it's supposed to be false on the holy ghost they got an attitude with it huh and they're so hard you just can't get in there oh my people have that barrier amen a barrier of unbelief and most of the times according to the brother to god it is because of previous teaching their teaching of their mom their dad or their church well we aren't taught it that way that's not the point the point is that if you're of god you love the truth of god you come to the word of god if you are god's child amen but i thank god this morning that you don't have that level can i just what say what i don't have wrote down just comes to mind have you eye i believe there's those who think their eyes are open who think they do see but they're still completely blind that's scary we know that's the truth out there in the domination world but especially even amongst the message huh because how many knows your life proves who you are it proves who you are how many beliefs that's why we ought to inspect ourselves see if we are in the faith or whether we're not see if our life bears the fruit of the spirit amen see if it copes up with the word or if you're really just a hypocrite [Music] i wonder i wonder this morning if a hypocrite really knows he's a hypocrite because it would seem like if he was he wanted quit being hypocrite amen unless he's just happy being that way but most of the time it's they're blind they don't see their own fault my and you know what the bible declares there'll be millions there that thought they were right and they weren't so god help us because only the elect won't be deceived the bible says it would be so deceiving that if it was possible the elect would be deceived was it billy graham i'm thinking with billy graham brother brown said it was going out there and preaching that eve saw deceiving even the elect that are being deceived and he begged to differ letterbomb said i beg to differ with him on that that's not scriptural the bible says if it was possible the elect would be deceived but it's not because they're delayed they'll have their eyes open i believe that to go to the rapture you're going to have that little specialized site amen that little eyesight folks it isn't to see everybody else's fault you know that specialized side is going to have 20 20 vision back at you those three fingers that point back at you see god where am i at with you how do i look to you lord open my eyes take that veil away praise be to god aren't you glad for that veil that was taken away you know man wanted to see god man that worship god israel worship god right and then they went into the temple and now there are three barriers i've got that back there yet but there was a first court with the labor and the sacrifice place to burn the offering and so forth it was the second building so to speak that had this candlesticks on it and the shoe bread and so forth and then behind that one was badger skin isn't that right a whole big old curtain made out of badger skin amen and anybody that kept it behind that drop dead outside of moses or those who were special anointed how many knows when you got in behind that second barrier before you go back behind that barrier you had this walk a certain pace no doubt but your head had to be a certain way you had to have the bells you had to have the right lower clothes you had the right to have upper clothes you had to have the right anointing on you everything had to be right because if oh my am i wrong or did they put the rope on his leg just in case he did drop dead nobody else would take you know they'd have to take him back out of there because if they went in they'd die too so nobody we'd have a bunch of bad people in there put something on here hey if he ain't quite right god ain't happy with it he'll drop dead and yet you have the holy spirit right in your heart how many knows they were praising god with abraham and they were saying abraham is our father our father and moses is our prophet and so forth and all they disputed with jesus and so forth and after calvary knows that when jesus died what happened when he died when he flamin when he passed away when he died the bible says that there was an earthquake and that veil was rent it was torn too because they were saying where's my god where's our god where's our god amen but they didn't realize that he was on calvary in plain view that's where that song comes from be all behold the man of sorrows oh behold him in plain view [Music] oh somebody wrote a song about it holiday was in plain view and they couldn't see them [Music] but when that veil was rent god said come on in now we can have boldness you can come boldly before the throne of god by the precious blood of jesus christ but you got to come just a certain way amen that only accepts you a certain way my wife she's been following facebook and so forth and a few statements that people will make even my relatives i hope they're listening this morning people that'll say god will accept you and love you just the way you are you ain't got to change he loves you just the way you are a certain point yeah he does love you the way you are sure he loves you but if you think you're going to come to god and stay the way you are what came to my mind i says honey well look at this way let me see israel after the resurrection after peter went began to preach on the day of pentecost after he told him you his wicked hearts and hands have killed the christ and so forth and god has raised him back up and they all said well what can we do to be saved y'all wanted to come back to god they wanted to be saved right and they said many better what shall we do and peter said god accepts you just the way you are is that what he said stay just how you are god loves homosexuals he loves lesbians he loves whatever it is he accepts you and you can just stay that way no he did not he said the first thing you've got to do is to repent first thing you've got to do is turn away from all your wicked ways get rid of your set goals depart from iniquity and i will receive you saith god the very first thing you've got to be willing to do is stop everything you're doing wrong you've got to completely change and die to yourself or you'll never come it's nothing but the devil's doctrine that is the devil's doctrine god loves us all just how we are huh no he doesn't say look i want you to start doing this right and that this that or the other and then i'll accept you no come as you are but you got to come and the first thing you got to do is repent say god i accept you and i absolutely turn from all my wicked ways if you don't come there you're gonna burn in hell we like my wife said he ain't gonna have no homosexual avenue down there he ain't gonna have no lesbian avenue over here he's not going to have no all of this mess that's not what heaven is going to be like no none of that is going to enter into heaven no whoremonger no none of that is going to happen has any part in the kingdom of heaven you just break one word and god can throw you into hell one word i like brother brad brother brian they're talking about a complete surrender god is looking for a complete surrender how many bees out this morning anything short of that it ain't nothing but the devil's lie the same one he took that told me oh god loves you he won't surely kill you uh ain't nothing about the devil's life folks the bible says the first thing you do is you got to be willing to forsake mom dad and sisters and your own life also if you're coming to me no you don't get to stay the way you are you get to come the way you are but you don't get to stay the way you are not with god isn't that the truth oh hallelujah faith be the god brother bad if we could ever just break through that sound barrier we're going to talk about that barrier of a jet amen they go so fast and it feels like every boat's gonna come here there is such a struggle god i've been trying to get the holy ghost and i don't feel like i am again oh i just started struggling i'll tell you why one of these days you'll burst just hang in there just say god i believe i'm saved i'm filled with the holy ghost and i don't care how long you're saying just keep believing it god will come down and say i take it when you get filled with the holy ghost he'll give you the peace that passes understanding joy [Applause] you'll say it's easy not to want to smoke and drink and do the things of the world it's easy to come into the house and god it's easy to crank up my car it's easy to say let's go to church amen let's praise god that's not just and be dumb driven cattle let's give god praise he's worthy of praise when you get over yonder we're gonna be screaming and shouting hey man it's gonna sound like thunder let's find her a little over here excuse me just getting carried away a little breaking through the sound barrier amen how about beliefs that's what we need get on our knees say lord take me through that sound barrier amen give me that tax that barrier of unbelief oh the devil will tell you i don't care how long you've been a christian you ain't really christian you think you're a son of god but you're not really look what you did look at your smart gun oh he's a master at pointing you to your faults jesus is a master at pointing you to calvary he's a master and not pointing you to yourself but pointing to him and what he's done hallelujah aren't you glad for that praise be to god but we gotta get past that sometimes it takes prayer it takes a little time for us to just get beside ourselves i'm gonna let the glory roll when the road is called in glory i'm gonna get beside of myself when i get beside of myself amen my this flesh this flesh pulls you down the holy ghost lifts you this is always a this is such a downer huh it always desires the wrong thing that's why the bible says not fulfilling lust of your flesh and of the mind everything you can think of don't satisfy that don't satisfy the desires of this flesh why because it's wrong oh my people want to say well you can do whatever you want to god loves you anyway boy you're weaker is weaker than eve ever thought about me it took a lot more than that to deceive her he had to come down to just one word to preach the whole gospel except one little word that ain't even anything or here or close to one word you love him aren't you glad that dale was rent and now the flaming sword that flaming what is the sword the sword of the word the fiery word says come on back says come into christ come into christ come into christ it's the only place of refuge that barrier has been taken down amen but we love our chicken coops we love our barriers we know what we can do and what we can't do i like that don't kids like that kids like that well i know that if i don't take that garbage out of that he says take it out boy my backside's going to get lit up so i ain't going to fuss about that daddy said stick the garbage up yes daddy grab it and go out there no problem we like our barriers but you know sometimes god does something different it's not just a certain box huh like brother bam says you know it takes a mason mason can lay a straight line or anybody can lay a straight line but he says it takes a real mason to turn corner all right take a corner to lay that corner lead i remember years ago woody when i when i was i worked for a guy up in ohio and he let me lay block for a summer and i did a horrible job i couldn't hang it hardly and anyway i ended up going down the floor and applying as a labor getting six dollars an hour them guys saying block i'm getting 12. my gracious you know what i'm saying and work twice as hard don't guys just hey my mother ain't quite right stir it up would you ah then my masons there's some picky guys i'm gonna give me this and give me that that's nice you know but anyway so one day i picked up a troll i said i can do this i think and i was in labor i went in there i laid a corner up i leveled it i measured it the right height it was square it was everything and one of the guys says hey you can't do that you're not an apprentice okay bye i said i went over to another mason somewhere else they didn't know me from adam i'm a mason i'd like to be have a job you are okay come start tomorrow forget all the riff raff recruit the apprenticeship and right from there i'll leave everybody for a while you know how we are but that's how i got the limbach i realized hey i can do this i don't have to do this i can do this but i can't do it for this guy he wants to work in that some other channel but it takes a corner to taste a real mason let me tell you something how he believes it takes a real child of god to turn the corner and the israelites couldn't turn that corner how many knows when the messiah came they want to keep on going they wanted to keep their priesthood they wanted to be the big shots in the church they want pride in everything else when it was time to humble themselves and fall before jesus chao physicists and all of them guys need to fall down like this and say jesus i worship you i believe you're the son of god i believe you're the messiah that was to come that's what they should have done but instead they called him beelzebub huh oh jesus i believe that you are god that's too much for churches today even they don't think he was god remember thomas said my lord and my god and jesus never said no no don't call me that that's for the father somewhere else jesus never refuted it because the fullness of the godhead dwelled in him bodily even the disciples didn't understand his father stuff all the time i mean you know she took a little explaining took a little revelation to understand the godhead and he says you mean i've been with you so long and you still don't know me huh he says if you've seen me you've seen the father for it's not me that does the works but it's the father that's up there huh did he say that no it's the father that dwelleth in me he's in me praise be to god aren't you glad to have him in you folks and let me just say this again i've said it before the best thing you got in this world is christ the holy spirit in your heart that's the thing you got the very best thing we have is for christ to be in you if you have that revelation you are a blessed person because jesus said a lot of them have ears but still there's a barrier there they still don't hear a lot of my eyes but they still don't see how many times i was just reading yesterday before brother ram says you know the very same jesus that did the very same signs when he walked the shores of galilee he's here dude not a different sign not a different work but the exact same thing we have christ with us again today and in the service you do it let me tell you something there's nothing greater than that to have evidence of like god that way in the congregation and in every service because that couldn't just be said anywhere anywhere am i right god did that through malachi 4. it could be something isn't it going to be something when the judgment stands and this generation says well i didn't see no god i didn't do this out of the other there'll be a lot of preachers burning hell because they didn't tell their congregation what god did huh but god did in this generation because i guarantee you this god's gonna say no i send you a prophet i've indicated myself more than what i ever thought of doing while i was on here on the earth seven times around the world ten times more the day of pentecost that was your message that's what god will tell this generation thank god for lifting the veil amen praise the lord i think that clock is either stopped or something so i don't have my phone so we're just going to go until i'm done here comes quarter after one right amen praise god you love him this morning all right praise be to god so we look at that look at uh how he said if veil was over their eyes how many knows the gentiles now have a veil over their eyes but a brand preached on the unveiling of god this is really the new the mystery of christ is christ in you the hope of glory the unveiling of christ in every generation at every turn has been god working in his people every one of you that claims and know not just claims or no's let me put it this way every one of you that's filled with the holy ghost dedicated your life to god you are a christian remember this you are christ to your neighborhood you are the unveiling of god to your community let that sink in how many would say oh me oh me lord help me oh me help me lord to be a good reflection of you so that people could see beyond this veil verbum says it's always the veil that hides it it's because of the veil the people don't see it well now y'all from down i understand y'all come back and see us you know y'all come back now joe is nice out there show what are we doing kentucky hillbilly language and some of the phds just couldn't see behind that veil the god was hid behind that rail he was hid behind the simplicity of a kentucky hillbilly oh god you are awesome you said you hide it from the wise and the fruit you said you you used the low people to you know to rebuke the heart you scored in this last generation you picked out a kentucky hillbilly all of his hints and coats and fetches and carries huh what did he call it some kind of a feather bed or a straw mat a straw tick i didn't even know what a straw tick wasn't that a lot got begin to thinking about a straw tick all right i believe that's something like what we had we have take two sheets and just sew it all up except one corner and stuff a bunch of straw up in there and it's fat as a tick there's your bed i guess that's right all of that over in california over in hollywood speaking that language but yet god would come down god was veiled in flesh in this generation he is still veiled in flesh am i right and i'm so thankful for that aren't you glad praise be to god lord help us i'm going to touch on this perhaps in closing two two thoughts i want to just touch on doubt doubt the barrier of doubt which is what sin the barrier of sin what would happen if you would get past to bear your sin what might be possible somebody tell me preach for me what might be possible if you get past the barrier of unbelief very good all things are possible for them to believe with you nothing shall be impossible if you can have faith if you'll get past the doubt if you need healing oh hallelujah you need the holy ghost you need to join your life this morning right now right here get past that barrier and you'll go out those doors with joy unspeakable and full of glory you'll have peace that passes understanding everybody go like this we're all just there you go praise the lord i don't like you just hunkered down like i heard that before it's going to take more than that if we're going to really break this barrier wave your hand do something but snap out of it and let's believe with all of our hearts all things are possible god is gonna take you he's gonna take me through this wicked all this horrible sodom condition and he's gonna have his pure and spotless that's what i believe i mean one of these things we're gonna break a barrier unlike you have ever seen that's why we're gonna be walking brother troy and all of a sudden a sharp feeling will come over us and we'll have our glorified body amen so we understand the prophet is when you die you go and you get a theophany body the thought theophany body comes back and picks up that dead body that they buried only that dead body that's buried it's not going to be like a dirt that has to be pushed back up because we can go through doors walls whatever you want without moving it huh amen every atom every molecule it'll be changed and if you're alive and remain you're just gonna disappear are you with me we're gonna break that barrier one of these days how many is looking for that amen it better happen before another 15 years i'll probably have to go by the way to the grave but either way as long as i have that quickness power in me it's all right how many knows you don't have to fear this chaos you don't have to fear things being worse they are but let me tell you you don't have to fear that you can bust past the barrier of fear because you've got hope you know where your future is you know who you love and who is with you who leads you who guides you amen let's do this one more thing in closing and that is the barrier of indifference how many knows we're all different and sometimes we don't like certain people huh i'm going to look up there because if i look at you you're thinking i've been singing i'm talking about you but isn't it the truth we're different we have personalities some of them are like me loud and voiceless like peter and then there's john love one another children love one another you gotta love one another you know folks i don't care you know some of us amen brother others huh there's people sometimes we just you have to be careful even with your holy ghost that doesn't get a hold of you well that was just so much different for me i don't know if i really like it huh that's how we are in our carnal nature in it we don't like each other perhaps because we're so different right how many does that cause all the pentecostals become one the student of three minutes brother bam says one's riding one camel hump the other one's a cantaloupe a two-camel hump and if you ain't on the two camel hump well you just ain't going sweet camel hop i mean a three-hump camel all right let me get my story straight [Music] that's right oneness twoness trinity or whatever it might be right maybe not see eye-to-eye you know i've disagreed with people before people have disagreed with me before but you can always sense their spirit whether they love you or whether they got the right spirit or not now if you disagree with people and they got the wrong attitude you can sense that and even if they were right you'd still know they're wrong because they can't shake your hand they don't really like you can i just say what comes to mind a quote comes back brother bam says something but it is a very horrible thing just to dislike somebody just to dislike them i don't like them that's not good you should love people it don't matter if they smack you it don't matter what happens or how they treat you you should still love those folks because when that dislike comes in there can we know that that's that's a hatred well i don't like that person might as well say i hate that person you don't like him amen i don't know how brother branham could last sunday talked about hothead you don't want people to be lost brother bam says he wouldn't wish hitler to have to go to hell huh and after what he did boy i've had all kinds of imaginations what i thought the man ought to have destroyed families by millions it was horrible that's all which and he has a little chance of being there but you don't wish them a curse you don't wish anything like that on anybody so let's realize brothers and sisters evening night tabernacle let's realize we're all different huh don't try to make that family like your family don't make that person like you ought to be like me can i go a little further because us human beings we are very prone to think that in our little group and our little thing hey this is the right way and everybody else is wrong i was listening to question answers and and i hadn't heard that brother band speak brother brad speaking like that but he talked about question answers 64 to believe it was he has about four different ones and i was listening to it last night and when he was talking about how that the bride is elected but there's still the other church that goes through the tribulation for purification and so forth amen then there's a there's a foolish virgin assistant there's different ones same god is the judge isn't that right i just want to be in the elected i'm just say god i want to be in the rapture i want to be by your side if that be your perfect will amen but what i'm trying to say is this i don't care if it's mennonite i don't care if it's homies i don't everybody thinks that this is it right and didn't the disciples do the same thing when they were walking with jesus and there was another man somewhere casting out devils and doing stuff and he says hey what about him stop him he ain't supposed to be doing that and jesus said nobody can talk likely of me and god back him up let him alone god's using him amen praise be to god amen as far as belonging to denominational system bill abraham says that the bride of jesus christ the elected of jesus christ you cannot be a member you can't belong to the denominational harlot system and be the bride of jesus christ at the same time amen to the different category why no more brother glenn then if i come up here and i begin to say end well now look god don't look at you sister so if you want to trim your hair a little bit that'd be all right but bam said one place if you want to have a little color if you want to have a little called that bi huh color your hair yeah he made that statement but let me tell you something if i come up and i push that it ain't no time before it gets away carried away i don't push i say get it as far away from the edge of that cliff as you possibly can you cut your hair your wife or your husband has a right to divorce you and put you away amen brother branham i think even even brother brown i love the way bill graham stayed with the word because there was a woman once one plate said she was a hair salonist and women wanted to have to cut their hair and she asked how can i should i cut the hair or should i he said can't tell you i don't have the word of the lord on it it just says for you not to cut your hair i want to stay with the blueprint until he give her personal advice i can give you my opinion i like that but stay with the word of god but bam says so if jezebel was the only one that ever painted her face god fed her to the dogs so if you paint your face up like jezebel remember your dog meat folks this is not on the script so i don't know who needed that i would rather be as plain jane i would rather have my hair slicked back and look like a peel onion and have the holy ghost than to be a beauty queen and be used by the devil well anyway i should say a handsome dude i guess for me but you don't want to be no beautiful you love the lord is it not good in these perilous times that you can have joy in your heart to know without a doubt that you're following a path that god came and proved and vindicated and that your heart is right with god this morning one of the first things i want to come out to say this morning that just comes out of mind i'll do it in closing but i feel like i just want to thank you lord all i wanna do is love him so glad i feel his love for me every day my heart will praise him when i think about where god has brought not just me but you are you listening where god has brought this church this god has brought this church through the biggest bunch of briar patches through the hardest things that's right i want to tell you something that says the spirit the devil tried his absolute best to shut this place down every i'm the pastor i watch over the shepherd and i over the sheep i know what's going on and i know that he almost pulled out every trick in this pouch to try to do it and folks it sure wasn't me it sure wasn't us that held it together it was god it was god when i think where he's brought us through and how good he's been to us he's so good and i was that's the first thought i had lord you have been so good to us i just want to thank you lord i felt good and i thought yeah we had some bad times too but god brought us through the hard times doesn't matter whether it was bad or good whatever folks i will leave this place tomorrow i will resign tomorrow and go somewhere where i can believe that that church is of god amen believes it no i'm not resigning don't interpret that i love what god has called me to do i appreciate it i appreciate y'all i thought about the other day he said you brother brother you need to tell everybody that you that you appreciate them not with you that's right because i got my faults folks far from perfect but anyway i believe god has a purpose in it all you know sometimes i wonder do you ever wonder why god made you the way he made you brother brad you're a different man all of us are different that's okay you know but i know that even the prophet of god said that god will pick a prophet like jonah for what he's doing i tempered and wanted god to go ahead and kill them all and destroy them i did my job not do your destroying god says boy you have to right out of the wrong attitude somebody who didn't want the job ran and had to go get swallowed by uh whatever but whether it was elijah whether it was moses whatever whatever it was always has his man so sometimes i wonder who i am i am then another way another way says well i there must be a reason for it brother bobby you are so hard-headed the boys will tell you dad i told you three times to do it this way and you still don't do it that way i'm sorry son i'll try again hard-headed i don't hit it but maybe there's a purpose in it i just hope that god doesn't let me be hard-headed to his will and it's perfect well amen that's why i want to be the spirit moves spirit moves just move it with him amen praise be to god you love him and i don't know why i said those things but i do know that this life is real folks the goodness of god to you is real we need to appreciate his goodness because guess what that's what you're going to hang on to from here on out the things of this world is going to get worse the world's going to get worse and i believe it'll go into complete calamity how many believe that the world is going to completely lose it not just america i'm talking about the world because england and those places they allowed homosexuality long before we ever thought about doing it they had all of that mess long before we did because john wesley and those take to gospel they turned them down and then guess what they went into chaos we're experiencing the going into chaos because of rejecting the prophet of god and our generation but it's world wide so can i say this this morning as your pastor dig your roots down deep not based on anything else but your relationship with god your prayer life every day amen your walk is so important open the eyes of my heart lord to see where i'm wrong where i need to get ready how many believe you've got a spot somewhere in your life that still needs to get a little more ready for the rapture amen i know i do let's stand this morning we'll stop musicians if you'll come and this just comes to mind is it okay even as satan in our past has tried to destroy us how many knows he's not going to let up he may not be as raging as he was but every individual in here everybody in here remember this if you're walking the path you're supposed to walk that doesn't like it he's not going to leave you alone if you've got a good marriage the devil will do his best to destroy you got a good home the devil will do his best to destroy you got a good church the devil will do his best to bring barricades divisions paul said let there be no divisions among you everybody have the same mind be one amen let's bow our heads i wonder before i pray how many want to move just a little closer to the lord say lord i just want to move a little closer to you lord just a little closer and i want to thank you first of all not just asking everything but i want to thank you lord for how good that you have been to us lord for always leading us and guiding us and for always making a way whenever we would come up and walk against the wall whenever we come against the barricade lord you'd always help us through lord many of us we look at our lives of where we were five years ago lord jesus and where we were with you in other ways lord jesus and we say father we want to thank you lord jesus i just want to thank you that's what we want to do is just we want to thank you lord and we want to be more grateful and we want to worship you more we want to praise you more we want to give more thanks to you for your goodness and that we can truly believe in our hearts that we're yours lord that you're leading us you're guiding us through these terrible waters these troubled times that are just getting worse we thank you father and i ask god that you would just put your hedge around every individual and don't let the devil do anything but what you allow we ask god that you continue to lead to guide us forgive us of our failures where we're not where we ought to be yet we look at our lives we say you know this has got to go that's still got to go my attitude still gotta improve whatever it might be we lift our hands to you and say lord bring us closer closer closer closer until one day we'll look upon your face and we'll see you face to face we'll say jesus it is so good to see you it is so good to be home we've been a pilgrim and we've been a stranger but now we're home all the saints of all the ages our loved ones will come forth we'll break through the barrier of mortality into immortality we which are alive and remain will break that barrier of mortality step over into another dimension we'll speed up and they'll slow down lord we ask god that you just continue to lead us and guide us forgive us cleanse us keep us pure before you as we walk this path lord father the upcoming meetings that we have lord we ask god that you bless those meetings father in a special way be with brother as he prays about the messages to bring lord give him traveling mercies father we ask god that you just be with each one of us father as we begin now father in the next four weeks to set our minds upon it when the time gets close not to be too busy cut back on our work schedule so that we can pray more that you'd come and move in a special way for the highlight of the whole thing lord will be when you move into services when you come down and you change young people's lives father when you feel with the holy ghost whatever it is that you want to do lord when you deliver when you give victory we ask god you just give us a real outpouring of a revival lord like we've never had lord and god that people would be drawn closer to you and getting ready to get out of here so that our young people could get a real start for the years that are left here they could have a real foundation a real start a real rock to anchor their lives upon we ask god that you just bless lead in guide now as we give you honor and glory in jesus name amen and amen god bless
