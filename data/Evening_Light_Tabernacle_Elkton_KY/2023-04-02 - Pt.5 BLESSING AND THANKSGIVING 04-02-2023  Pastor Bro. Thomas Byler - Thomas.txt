just one second if you folks don't mind we have the best Church in the world when Sherry got her news my mind took me to the darkest place and Brother David and brother Thomas pulled me out just by talking and praying so I want you to know we love you and we appreciate all of you and I'm going to try to not be crying up here Brother David makes me cry all the time okay well I'm gonna do a song and it's kind of to it's definitely to our Lord in heaven but it's also to brother Thomas and to Brother David and it's called Mercy came down because after they spoke Mercy did come down to me so I'm ready if you are sister Becky [Music] troubled in life so twisted and sway [Music] say bye and lie too I sincerely on the bottom of desperate no hope could be found on what I had no answers Mercy came down Mercy came down and cleansed all my sins the blood of the Lamb made me whole again oh I stand redeemed his grace I found all because Mercy Mercy came down [Music] I did not deserve his help from above cause I had rejected a gift of his love he looked past my fall he saw sin had me bound when I could not go up Mercy came down [Music] Mercy came down and cleansed all my sins the blood of the

found all because Mercy Mercy came down [Music] oh and redeem his grace I found all because Mercy [Music] Mercy came down Mercy came down amen praise the Lord up in heaven amen those kind words and brother Glenn called the other morning and you know usually when brother Glenn talks to you it's he's all and I said oh something ain't right that's not the brother Glenn that I know he's never he's never down he began to tell me and and you know I we're a servant one to another we love one another we pray for one another we help one another and I didn't know what to say the Lord just kind of spoke to my heart and said you need to pray because what else can you do but pray I never will forget when I was in Arkansas I was on the fire department and brother Donnie Reagan was preaching at our service our church service and that night we had a call and it was raining so hard you couldn't see and if it was raining that hard now I wouldn't leave the house but I was a lot younger then and we I passed the ambulance and we got there and and they always teach us in and volunteer when you go to a wreck or you go to a situation it might be your family or someone you know when we got there it was the lady that worked with my dad she was a secretary and they were Pentecostal people and they were real good and lightning had struck a tree and it fell across their Suburban and his wife and his kids were in the Suburban he looked at me and he said David what are we going to do I said I don't know but I said I only know of one thing to do he said what's that I said it's time we pray it was pouring down rain and we just stood there and we prayed his Pentecost and he started speaking in tongues and one of our other volunteer fire department he came over and he was Baptist when he heard us prayed in him speaking in tongues he left but you know all that Mary had wrong with her she wore neck brace for three days and that was it because God is an ever-present health in the time of trouble you can say a lot of things and it won't do a bit of good but you can never pray that it won't do some good because our Prophet taught us he said there's one thing you can never do too much of he said let's pray so when somebody in this church comes on your heart you fall on your knees and you pray for them you know I got thinking we went out there at the store yesterday and had that time that brother Tommy had had on his heart and tried to witness for the Lord and I began to think I thought you know I come home yesterday I thought man what a refreshing day to be in the presence of brothers and all we talked about was the Lord I said wow what a refreshing day I just felt refreshed and then of course sister Martha and brother Irvin won't like this but I'm going to say it anyways and they fed me lunch and of course they wouldn't take no money and it was good and uh I knew they wasn't going to take nothing because if I'd have been going to build it I would have put a lot more on it because I like a big sandwich and I thought you know you can't take advantage of someone that's being nice to you so I just was happy but when I build one at home it's I don't know if y'all ever seen those the comics that the Dagwood sandwiches about this tall that's me but I did appreciate brother Irvin and them and their Hospitality they're always so nice and you just about have to fight them to make them take money if you get anything in that store and I pray the Lord bless you I really appreciate all they do for the service of the Lord don't you and let's give them a hand this morning amen let's stand this morning and amen we just love all of our heart this morning and amen just I just just get excited thinking of the good things that God has in store for us this morning amen let's sing at courses brother Thomas comes God is good all the time he puts a song of Praise In This Heart of Mine amen don't you love him this morning well God is good yes oh all the time he puts a song of Praise In This Heart of mine God is good all the time the darkest night is [Music] [Applause] good oh he's so good all the time well if you're walking through the valley oh yes there are shadows all around oh yes do not be for he will guide you oh he will keep you safe and sound for he has promised he never leave you nor forsake you and his word is true God bless you all the time it's [Music] just someone Praise In This Heart God is good all the time light will shine God is good oh he's so good all the time amen good morning good to be in the house of the Lord amen musicians let's do birthdays and anniversaries this morning if y'all can be seated amen I wrote it down this time so I wouldn't forget amen amen so everybody that has a birthday amen welcome to April amen praise the

two two years just get him get just getting started raise the Lord 42 2 and 42. ah happy anniversary to you a happy anniversary [Music] every day of the year a happy anniversary happy anniversary to you and the best one you've ever had happy anniversary y'all amen praise the Lord amen God is good isn't he I think that'll be all for the music we'd wanna have sister Sherry give a testimony and maybe an update amen so we all know where it's at amen amen as we watch the Lord do miracles for her amen so if she would just give us a little testimony this morning and give us a report on things amen thank you uh first I want to I do better singing than I do talking so sorry um first of all I'm at peace God's given me peace that's something I never thought I would say when I hear bad news about me my first thought usually is that okay it's bad I'm gonna I'm gonna have to die and nobody cares but because I know God and God's given me the peace that I I really need and I'm I'm very much at peace with whatever happens um I went to the hospital probably about a week and a half ago and they had found a mass on my colon two masses uh in two separate spots and I was asked but all I said that I needed to see a doctor asap and because he thought he might have been metastasized is that how you said and um so I was able to get the doctor the next morning I got to see her and then she referred me to a surgeon who I got to see two days later so everything went very quickly the surgeon decided that instead of a biopsy right away he wants to do a colonoscopy and in that colonoscopy if he can find a piece of that mess he'll go ahead and snip it I'll stay all night at the hospital and then they'll do a biopsy if you cannot get it then I'll have to go back a few days later and have the biopsy um but his options have been that if it's not cancer then he'll just probably take a piece of take him out and that's it if it is cancer and I'm not afraid of that word um then he will have to do a uh he's going to uh give me some chemo to help shrink everything down so he might be able to take it out that way I'm at peace because I know God's with me I've turned this over to God it's in his hands and whatever happens whether it is or is not cancer means makes no difference to me because I know the Lord and I know God will take care of me if I have to go through chemo or whatever I got his hand he's got mine and he'll help me through that whatever it is I just ask that you continue your prayers and I thank you all for the prayers that I've had we've had many many people praying and I want to thank you for that but anyway that's God is good he's awesome one of my favorite Bible verses is Psalm 27 1 is the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear I Don't Fear The Devil he wants to give this to me God allowed it and God allowed it for a reason I don't know if it's for me or maybe for my husband who is having a hard time with it but I know that he's he's done this for a reason and I'm just going to trust him no matter what the reason is but thank you all for your prayers I do appreciate them [Applause] again we wanna amen I uh was praying and I thought well I think I'm done with that series amen and so I thought about going into that Sevenfold personage of Christ amen and Revelations the first chapter but amen as I meditated and prayed I just felt the spirit moving to amen and I I think I've touched on it before and maybe spoke a little bit on it but there's one more thing that I'd like to pull out of this series on the worthiness of the Lord amen amen so we're going to turn our bibles if you will and it'll be um speaking on blessing amen and I'd like to include thanks amen Thanksgiving because that's another word that was put in there amen that he's worthy of Thanksgiving and he's worthy of a blessing isn't that right amen and so I want to cover blessing for sure this morning I want to talk about the blessing amen uh and so Revelations once again we want to read the same scriptures that we have read but we want to read it again and then go from there amen and I do have uh some Old Testament different Old Testament scriptures and I've got some good really good Bible reading that we have that I'd like to do this morning Amen to try to cover this and there's two sides to this there's really is really um but I've I've spoke so many times on the one side that I may touch on the one side a little bit but I wanna touch more on the second side the first side is how that we're blessed amen and the other side is how we are to bless him amen because he's worthy of blessing amen and we want to look at that part more this morning amen perhaps in what we are because we know many many places that we could go to even in the Book of Revelation this blessed he that readeth amenity to hear the words of the prophecy of this book amen Jesus Christ saying blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are these all these different uh things that we're blessed by amen and so we know uh and just maybe a sense of humor a little bit I remember when I was in Mennonite we would sing this song uh praise God from whom all blessings flow amen praise God All Creatures here below Grace Father Son and Holy Ghost amen I was like well we won't sing that song but amen and we know that praise God from whom all blessings flow isn't that right we know all blessings flow from almighty God amen and we certainly are blessed of God Amen but this is more centered towards amen not God giving us but what comes back you know how many God knows is really focused on that how that God is worthy of of these things amen and I don't know about you but if you invested in something you'd expect a return in that investment wouldn't you amen and so we want to look with the help of the Lord a little bit on my how God has invested himself and what he has invested amen and in this world I know that God is going to get exactly back I mean what he expected whenever he began to invest isn't that right but there's an on the other side on the bad side and those who do not love God and those who are on Satan's side we realize that God really doesn't get any respect does he amen amen and so uh we'll talk about that a little in a little bit amen amen and so let's read here in Revelations uh fifth chapter I want to Revelations 5 11-12 and then go seven uh chapter 7 and verse 12. now notice here and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne amen who liveth forever and ever I'm sorry I'm reading the wrong scripture all right chapter 5 verse 11. amen and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousands times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb to receive not all of these things he's worthy to receive amen he's worthy to receive that's why I say we want to focus on what he gets back isn't that right amen receive power and riches now I never did Cover riches so much and wisdom even wisdom I don't believe I've covered too much but I did a little bit and strength amen and honor and glory and blessing amen and I'm going to look at that word blessing with the help of the Lord this morning amen before we take communion and so forth the other one is found in chapter seven and we'll begin with verse 10. and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to Our God which stood upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell down before the throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen and blessing amen amen and blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving there's that Thanksgiving word and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen God bless the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen amen we want to look at this and I think about how blessed how many believe that we're the last people you know I believe the prophet made a statement he says how that we are a privileged people amen now a privileged people amen is a blessed people amen not underprivileged but privilege amen is a blessed people you and I we of course think about how God has blessed us amen and we want to return with the help of the Lord blessing back to him and we're going to go ahead if you will turn with me if you got your Bibles follow me along amen y'all see all those tabs right that's how many scriptures we got so we could just do nothing but reading scriptures amen and as a matter of fact I'm not sure if I'm gonna go to that scripture it may be in Nehemiah where it talks about I believe they flip took about a fourth of a day in just reading the scriptures amen amen and the power of God came down I think in a mighty way but let's turn first of all the first one we've got here is in Deuteronomy the 8th chapter and we'll hey I've got mark down here one through 20. we want to read about 20 scriptures amen and we want to just take some thoughts here with the help of the Lord all right and I'll I want you to notice how there's a lot of these scriptures that tie in with the new testament amen amen so even though they're out of the Old Testament and some people think it's not relevant you'll find that a lot of these scriptures will pull out by Paul and mentioned over in the New Testament so chapter 8 verse 1 it says in all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do well we're not under the law anymore oh but think about the New Testament how many of those it says it talks about well let me just I I really just comes to mind that it actually is going to say it for me in verse 4. all right so think about this you shall observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers now we all know that we've got a promised land that we're supposed to go in and possess don't we so we have a promised land that we're supposed to go in for the uh and class can I just treat you like a class this morning amen what is what is the Promised Land the Holy Ghost brother John that's right the Holy Ghost remember where is it found where do you find that this this is the promise anybody can tell me where it's found Acts 2 38 and you shall receive the golf if he gives up the Holy Ghost for the promise amen the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen so that's the promise right there that's where the promise of the promised land is you shall possess the land and thou shalt remember all the way remember all the way which the Lord thy God let thee these for 40 years in the wilderness amen now I'm going to just say it ahead of time one thing that as we begin to think about blessing God the Bible here is telling us that we need to remember something because we're going to raise a little bit about toraha it tells us to bless him and so forth but now here it's telling us and remember how that God has led us these 40 years amen Faith the Lord I think Brother David said he's buried 42 years no doubt he was a Christian when he got married so he's been going about 40 years there's probably a lot of us in here how many in here has been serving the lord for 40 years 40 years yeah quite a few of us isn't it amen so how many believe that God has led us for 40 years so we can put our name in there and I didn't look at what God is on and how he had let you remember don't forget amen now notice by God let these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee that's right and to know what was in thine heart hey man everybody can shout praise God I'm a Christian you know but in time we find out what's in your heart don't we When Trials and tests come we find out what you're really made of thank you very much that's the truth amen praise the Lord we find out what you're made of many times uh and this just comes to mind didn't write this down but brother Bannon preached a message on time tested memorials didn't he he talked about people who are tested by time and proven by time and they're memorials because they were simply tested by time amen all right to know what is in our heart whether thou with us keep his Commandments or no amen and he humbled me and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou knew is not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man now here's the answer Alice coming to you remember that man does not live by bread alone but only but by every word that proceed is out of the mouth of God this man lived by see how it's tights right over in the New Testament amen if he said it back then amen he means for us to obey every command that he has said and the congregation said amen praise the Lord so that's pulled over even Jesus made that very pulled that thing Jesus himself pulled it out of the Old Testament man shall not live my bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I remembered in verse 4 by Raymond whacks not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years how many can look back and realize oh my this is one reason why we glorify him we Magnify Him we praise him we bless him because he's the one that is Led you he's the one that sustained you we have all come out of hard times every one of us can look back in our lives realize hey there were some times that we about went hungry we know what it was like and have be able to have me Affair and not have a whole lot wonder why it's gonna work out amen and he made a way isn't that right he made it away for us aren't you glad for that and for these brothers and uh Israel they their their feet wouldn't swell and their their brainment wouldn't wax old now and then Thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasing his son so the Lord thy God chastenethine how many knows that's New Testament Hebrews 12 I believe it is you know that as a father chasing his son so God chastens you and I if you be without chastisements then you are bastards amen oh my God can't correct you then you're not his child if you won't take correction you won't humble yourself the correction amen therefore thou shall keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him praise be to God for the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water a Fountains of depths that spring out of valleys from you how many believe there's lots of good fruit Amen in this wonderful Holy Spirit land that you and I are in it is full of good things folks I'm telling you if you don't know oh my praise be to God I hope God chose you good things and land of Wheat and barley and Vines and fig trees and pomegranates and a land of olive oil and honey Elaine wherein Thou shalt eat bread without scarishness how many believe that we're living amen we have a seven course meal because food has been starred up for you and I in this generation God told Mother Venom store this food up and you and I we are eating better spiritually then we have in Luther's age Pentecost or any other out amen if you are absolutely spiritually if you're hungry spiritually it ain't God's fault it's your own fault he has given us everything you can imagine okay amen [Applause] that's the truth ain't it we have so much more didn't it probably God said you know was Luther we were in water and Ankle deep ah brother Benham he talked about how he could really swim remember he says Daddy I can swim I can swim and he went out into some mud puddle and jumped in there and splashed around in a mud puddle he said get out of there son what's wrong with you baby he says one Luther we had a little bit of water to him Wesley but then a little more Pentecost we had but now we've got water we can take knives in I'm gonna be we got word that you can just plunge right on in and swim and not hit the bottom if there's plenty God has provided us with plenty in this land you're not supposed to have scarceness huh praise be to God I'm glad for that He blesses us with that amen let me just say because we are either one thing or the other God places before of us before us two things blessings or cursings you're either blessed or your curse that right no other thing either bless or cursed in Deuteronomy 28 it says and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of thy God to observe to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set the high above all the nations of the Earth can I just stop for a minute now how many of those brother bam taught in in um uh what is it I forget not which message it was God God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and he told to talk about Abraham and how Abraham how many knows indeed God said to Abraham in these shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and even Abraham himself could not be what fully blessed till he fully obeyed is that right and here look what he's saying whenever you diligently

happy person oh we're blessed but it's time to give back to the blessings of God a little bit amen I haven't even got to you have one part yet and we will only if we'll see what we have time for all right let's continue on Deuteronomy shall we we're not we're gonna we're not going to cover all these other but if you want to know contrary when if you want to know the other side of that redrub a Deuteronomy 28 the second half he says but if you don't do what God says then you're going to be cursed when you come in and when you go out and everywhere you go how many those of you ain't got the Holy Ghost it don't matter where you which direction you go it's cursing's everywhere amen all right so back to Deuteronomy 8 and we'll begin with verse um nine a land wherein thou shall eat bread without scares the Thou shalt not lack anything in it amen a man whose stones are iron and out of whose heels thou mayest dig brass and when that is eaten and are full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he had given me Hallelujah God gives you everything and then he says now that you got everything it's time to get back a little bit it's time to praise him it's time to say bless your holy name blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know I was over there yesterday supporting brother Tommy and his Outreach and we were sitting there in the cabin they had about four of them so I knew that was taken care of I said I want to get out there amongst the grow up the crowd I grabbed my Bible and put it up under my arm and went out there yesterday everybody trying to find somebody to witness to amen you know it's kind of funny the reaction you know how that people would look at you you know and say what's that guy doing with the Bible you know now you know what I thought you know I thought all of your little toys all your access didn't hammers that you're selling all of your your implements and all of this other stuff that you're just having a you know don't mind about getting blowed away and I'm sure it was raining it'd probably stand in the rain and you know for enjoying the things that God has made and so forth but when a man comes with the very God that give you everything that you have to play with you think that's kind of weird huh isn't that how human beings are we enjoy the creation but we don't you know we are shy of the creator huh I'm not ashamed amen of my creator praise the Lord anyway we got to talk to a few people but you know you can just tell whether people really want to talk about it or not amen but anyway so I was thinking look at what God has done how many knows everything we have it's been given to us by God in of all the places and I think I'll still go to it if I have time of all the times and the places that we worship God we worship because he is the creator of all things that's why we worship him because he's the Creator amen okay I'm uh I know I stop a lot but these scriptures here here I just I like to just milk them so to speak amen praise the Lord oh would it be all right Donna I'll tell her that yesterday you know and I appreciate our prayer band I really appreciate our prayer band and yesterday after Donna ask everybody to pray and boy she's got a lot of good response and everything and the Lord just intervened and got a lot better and so forth and I said well are you going to tell them that it's good now the Lord's you know he said no I'm I'm a little greedy when it comes to prayer I'm a prayer Hogue price tomorrow you know I thought that's good that's good that's nothing wrong with playing some more amen which it needed to be a little bit more but by God's grace amen it's wonderful to know when people pray God answers I mean how many believes that and I think it's wonderful I think that's one of the greatest things right now is amen that we got going is that prayer group amen that when somebody has a need everybody goes to praying amen so when you have eaten an Artful verse 10 then shall bow bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he has given thee beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God huh in not keeping his Commandments his judgments and his statues which I commend thee this day at least when thy is eaten and are full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy hurts and thy flocks have multiplied and thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied in all that thou has is Multiplied then thine heart be lifted up and now forget the Lord thy God which brought before out of the land of Egypt but we'll say the land of scarceness huh praise be to God how many glad from the house of bondage who led thee to the great and terrible Wilderness wherein where fiery serpents and scorpions and drought and there was no water who brought before us water out of a rock of Flint who let who fed thee in the wilderness with Manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do the good in thy latter end now look at verse 15 who let these two touch great and terrible Wilderness amen you see how does that come over in a hard time yeah amen we sing the song Amazing Grace isn't that right through many dangerous toils and snares he has already brought me he has brought me safe that's far how many brothers he said he's gonna lead you safely through he split you to where you are so don't forget God remember it's not you it's God that's leading you it's God that's protecting you he brought you through
