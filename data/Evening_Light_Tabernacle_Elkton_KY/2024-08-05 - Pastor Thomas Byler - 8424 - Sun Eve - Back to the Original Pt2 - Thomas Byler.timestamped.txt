[50:34] could would that be
[50:36] okay amen and we'll read uh 1
[50:38] Corinthians if you will 1

[50:57] chapter
[50:58] 4 I'm sorry it's not 1 Corinthians it's
[51:01] second Corinthians 2
[51:12] Corinthians 2 Corinthians 4 and verse 6
[51:16] for God who commanded the light out to
[51:18] shine out of Darkness has shined in our
[51:21] hearts to give the light of the
[51:23] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[51:24] face of Jesus Christ but we have this
[51:27] treasure in our Earth and vessels that
[51:31] the Excellency of the power may be of
[51:33] God and not of us we are troubled on
[51:36] every side yet not distressed we are
[51:39] perplexed but not in despair persecuted
[51:43] but not forsaken cast down but not
[51:46] destroyed always bearing about in the
[51:49] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[51:51] the life also of Jesus might be made
[51:53] manifest in our bodies for we which live
[51:57] are always delivered unto death for
[51:59] jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus
[52:02] might be made manifest in our mortal
[52:05] body may God add His blessings to the
[52:07] reading of the word you can be seated
[52:10] amen this morning we understand that
[52:13] brother Brandon when he was preaching on
[52:15] hybrid religion he talked about how that
[52:18] uh the age that we're living in that it
[52:21] actually uh you know the food that you
[52:23] eat amen affects your body am mean I
[52:26] think anybody here knows that your diet
[52:29] amen is a major part amen of your health
[52:34] amen I think brother Tommy I think I've
[52:36] seen it somewhere about what is it what
[52:39] is it uh 20% exercise 80% diet or
[52:42] something like that somewhere in there
[52:45] so and that's about what it is isn't it
[52:47] is it the diet that we have daily that
[52:50] affects us and the the hybrid corn the H
[52:53] I read where brother's talking about the
[52:55] Corn Flakes and everything else that we
[52:56] eat amen and it how it affects
[52:59] us amen but you know I want to start out
[53:03] with saying this that you know when I
[53:05] was talking about original I want to
[53:07] touch on that for just a little bit if I
[53:08] could a little bit because we look at we
[53:11] look at a lot of original as far as in
[53:14] God's program and in God's plan and the
[53:17] things that God said when he said let
[53:18] there be let every SE bring forth of its
[53:20] kind and so forth and he put all of
[53:22] those things in their places now you can
[53:25] you can go right outside this back door
[53:27] here and just go about 15 20 yards right
[53:29] up there ain't that right and uh in the
[53:32] fall of the year when these acorns drop
[53:34] isn't that right and you know you can go
[53:36] and plant those again and they'll
[53:38] produce other trees amen and so every
[53:41] seed brings forth of its kind all of
[53:43] nature it's in its original condition
[53:46] not not not that it you know I know it
[53:49] has death in it but it's still in the
[53:51] place that God has put it amen just like
[53:53] the animal kingdom all of the all of
[53:55] those they do exactly what God put the
[53:58] Instinct in the nature in them to do
[54:00] amen and in that it's all awesome and
[54:03] unique amen uh all in the in the
[54:06] universe in the galaxies the Sun the
[54:08] moon and all of out there the Stars they
[54:10] all hold their place they stay where
[54:12] their God had put them and we know that
[54:14] the things that uh how was it uh uh we
[54:17] know that the world that now is Peter I
[54:20] believe said is kept by the word of God
[54:22] in other words things stay in their
[54:25] orbits and stay in the place that
[54:27] they're supposed to be because the word
[54:30] of God ain't that right they're
[54:32] submissive to the word of God now and I
[54:35] want to just bring it down to the church
[54:37] how many believes that if the church you
[54:38] and I the people of God the Church of
[54:41] God when we're submissive to the word of
[54:43] God Amen and then we operate and we uh
[54:47] conduct ourselves and do exactly and the
[54:50] way that he originally planned for us to
[54:53] do is that right amen just like
[54:55] forgiving another of our debts and sins
[54:58] and trespasses If any man had all
[55:00] against any even as Christ forgave you
[55:02] forgive the forgiveness is there is that
[55:04] right and as long as we're in that
[55:06] context and so forth we're in that
[55:08] original state and things certainly work
[55:12] the way that it's supposed to work Ain
[55:14] that right how many likes when things go
[55:16] the way that you're supposed to go amen
[55:18] now we would have a serious problem if
[55:21] if on the back row or anywhere here we
[55:23] knew that there was two men sitting to
[55:26] together married right we have we'd have
[55:30] issue with that or two
[55:33] women huh things would be out of cater
[55:36] you know and and look at the world look
[55:38] at where the world is in that outside of
[55:41] the church outside of and you rub
[55:42] neighbors with it and every every day
[55:44] and look at where they're at and the
[55:46] chaos that they're in the turmoil that
[55:49] they're in amen so praise God for being
[55:53] in the place that God wants us to be
[55:56] amen and
[55:57] so let's let's just pick up a couple
[56:00] things here maybe before I go and read
[56:01] these these quotes that I really want to
[56:03] lay a foundation for but we want to look
[56:05] at I this is where I didn't get to this
[56:07] morning but we want to take a couple
[56:08] examples with the help of the Lord amen
[56:11] of how that God calls us to a certain
[56:15] place
[56:17] amen he ordains us gives us so to speak
[56:20] an original position that he wants you
[56:22] to be
[56:24] in just like
[56:26] uh uh you know even Satan in heaven
[56:30] isn't that right and the angels the
[56:32] Bible says in Judah I believe the Angels
[56:34] which kept not their first estate in
[56:39] other words they they they didn't stay
[56:40] in the original position that God wanted
[56:43] them to be
[56:46] in amen how many believes that it's very
[56:48] very important for every man to be in
[56:51] the position and hold the position of
[56:54] headship in the home and is that right
[56:56] it's very important that a woman stays
[56:59] in her
[57:00] place cuz anytime you get any of that
[57:02] out of cater you know and uh you know
[57:05] that's why you've got what you got out
[57:07] there brother brah talked about a woman
[57:09] out there on the street a policeman no
[57:11] business being out there doing all of
[57:12] that ain't that right but everything
[57:15] when as long as that's in that state
[57:17] that it's supposed to be in amen then
[57:19] God is behind it God blesses it amen we
[57:21] can have husbands wives we can have
[57:23] families we can have children we can
[57:25] raise our children amen and and and
[57:29] under the nourishment of God and watch
[57:31] them grow up to be
[57:33] Christians for them to have happy
[57:37] lives Amen to understand the mercy and
[57:40] the grace of almighty God you know I
[57:42] thought boy I you know I was thinking
[57:44] you know how how how you know some of us
[57:47] are having children and I'm thinking
[57:49] bringing children into this age in your
[57:52] mind it's almost crazy
[57:56] but I thought you know as long as you
[57:58] plan on educating them as long as you
[58:00] are watching over them the way that they
[58:02] are supposed to be watched over then you
[58:05] got something still amen you just have
[58:07] to watch that you don't you know the
[58:09] public schools and everything else right
[58:12] but see you can still do it it's still
[58:14] something that is in our nature to have
[58:16] children we should have children amen we
[58:18] have a desire to have children and so
[58:20] forth it's just a terrible age amen so I
[58:24] thought you know all of that look at how
[58:26] how that everything has it its place
[58:28] even the church has its place that it's
[58:31] supposed to be in amen and then uh you
[58:35] you know we could go into detail of how
[58:37] the devil doesn't like
[58:44] that I want to get your
[58:46] attention the devil doesn't like when a
[58:49] church has a group of people that love
[58:52] one
[58:52] another when they get along with each
[58:55] other
[58:56] they don't gossip about each other they
[59:00] don't think bad things about each other
[59:03] huh they don't say bad things about each
[59:06] other but they are unified group and
[59:08] I'll tell you right now uh any preacher
[59:11] it's a job to make sure that that stuff
[59:13] stays
[59:14] out amen because if you don't it'll
[59:17] creep in amen the devil will try to get
[59:20] in there any way that he can amen and
[59:23] then when you're walking along like
[59:24] Brother David said look at our worship
[59:26] service my anybody come up here and
[59:28] begin to lead songs when the church is
[59:29] all in it and sing it it's inspiring
[59:31] it's you know it's
[59:34] inspiring and that's the way that it
[59:36] should be
[59:38] amen amen we want we want it to be that
[59:41] way but you know it's like I said the
[59:45] devil's business to try to get in there
[59:47] somehow and get you out of that original
[59:49] state that you're supposed to be in how
[59:52] about let's take one example amen of
[59:54] course we won't go all the way way back
[59:56] to the Garden of Eden we haven't got all
[59:58] night but let's go up to David bring it
[1:00:00] all the way up to David and how that he
[1:00:02] was on the back side of the desert he
[1:00:04] had such a relationship with almighty
[1:00:06] God that God told Samuel to go and take
[1:00:09] that anointing oil Ando my king you know
[1:00:11] and how he did with all of his Jesse's
[1:00:13] family and so forth but all come down to
[1:00:15] him and he says yeah I got one more but
[1:00:17] he's out there you know he's kind of to
[1:00:19] run of the family and you know and so
[1:00:21] yeah well bring him in that right but he
[1:00:23] brought him in and anoint him with oil
[1:00:25] and how did he went you know and and end
[1:00:28] up going down to the Philistines and uh
[1:00:31] not the Philistines but to the battle
[1:00:33] that his brothers were in whenever they
[1:00:35] were all uh surrounded by the big giant
[1:00:38] you know and and and being intimidated
[1:00:41] by the enemy and he come in there and he
[1:00:43] says you know he looked at that us he
[1:00:46] said what is wrong with you guys why are
[1:00:47] you all shaking in your shoes and hiding
[1:00:49] out in your fox holes and everything
[1:00:51] like that and and they said well this
[1:00:54] giant man I'll tell you what nobody
[1:00:56] wants to take it and he's challenged
[1:00:58] them you know uh that that if let's not
[1:01:00] let everybody die but let's just get two
[1:01:03] of two people Let them fight and whoever
[1:01:05] wins the other one will become servant
[1:01:07] you know and and they had an agreement
[1:01:08] and David you know of course he had a
[1:01:11] couple of experiences on the back side
[1:01:12] of the desert so to speak ain't that
[1:01:14] right how many believes it's important
[1:01:16] to have those backside of the desert's
[1:01:17] experience with almighty God Amen so
[1:01:20] whenever whenever your brother or your
[1:01:23] sister perhaps comes up against a giant
[1:01:25] you don't have have to be there shaking
[1:01:27] with you know you say no brother I'll
[1:01:29] tell you our God is big enough to take
[1:01:31] care of your problem he's big enough to
[1:01:32] fight this devil that you're fighting I
[1:01:35] don't care what it is whether it's
[1:01:36] nervousness or whether it's h anxiety or
[1:01:39] whether it's depression or whatever it
[1:01:41] might be there you are and you can be an
[1:01:44] encouragement ain't that right amen you
[1:01:46] can be an encouragement because you've
[1:01:47] had a bear and a lion that you've dealt
[1:01:49] with amen or or so and there he was
[1:01:53] David you know innocent little David and
[1:01:55] and he come down there and my what what
[1:01:58] what that all was about and and I'll
[1:02:01] tell you what right now it had to be a
[1:02:03] tense moment it had to be a very unsure
[1:02:08] moment whenever David said he would take
[1:02:11] him and no doubt but the gossip went
[1:02:13] through the whole Camp yeah there is
[1:02:15] somebody that's going to take this giant
[1:02:17] on you know and it's a little water boy
[1:02:20] it's the water boy the water boy is
[1:02:21] going to take him
[1:02:23] on yeah he's bringing them food food and
[1:02:26] water right and stuff and and the water
[1:02:28] boy is going to take him on water oh no
[1:02:31] you
[1:02:32] know and man he had to be
[1:02:34] unsure is that right but David you know
[1:02:37] went out there with a sling that right I
[1:02:40] don't care how close he got it was
[1:02:43] unsure and this little guy oh got K all
[1:02:47] armies of Israel here he's coming he's
[1:02:49] going out there y'all pray hard pray
[1:02:51] let's
[1:02:53] pray is that right they all be praying
[1:02:56] and they went all out there and and
[1:02:58] David got closer and got closer and got
[1:03:00] closer and and uh my my if there's such
[1:03:04] a s thing as video in heaven I would
[1:03:06] like to see that replay don't wouldn't
[1:03:07] you I want to hear him saying I'm going
[1:03:09] to kick you and I'm going to feed you to
[1:03:11] the birds with the end of my Spear and
[1:03:13] this that or the other am I a dog that
[1:03:15] you bring me this little little runt out
[1:03:18] here to fight me and all that other he
[1:03:19] said and David says you know I don't
[1:03:21] come to you in a sword and Spiel but I
[1:03:23] come into you in the name of the Lord
[1:03:25] and to say I'm a take your head
[1:03:27] off that's right now I'm going take your
[1:03:30] head
[1:03:31] off amen and I can just hear it going
[1:03:35] through the Foxhole hey he said he's
[1:03:36] going to take his head off he said he's
[1:03:38] going to take his head off he's going to
[1:03:40] take his head off and and all of a
[1:03:42] sudden guess what you know maybe the old
[1:03:44] John Rose up and he was flicking his
[1:03:46] muscles and everything and David went to
[1:03:48] slinging a't that right got his little
[1:03:50] sling
[1:03:50] out this work
[1:03:53] before flung it up there and everybody's
[1:03:57] eyes were on it ain't that right
[1:03:59] everybody's eyes were on it and I'll
[1:04:00] tell you what there might have been some
[1:04:02] kind of a
[1:04:05] thud when it went right between them
[1:04:07] that little helmet with a little Gap
[1:04:10] helmet with a little Gap and it I'll
[1:04:12] tell you what you talk about Bullseye
[1:04:15] is't that right it went right in there
[1:04:17] and he probably went stiff you know and
[1:04:19] so forth and they were wondering whether
[1:04:21] it ricocheted off did it Ricochet off of
[1:04:25] huh but when he fell backwards and the
[1:04:27] dust flew
[1:04:29] up boy can you imagine I want you to
[1:04:33] understand the way the prophet of God
[1:04:34] said that was giv them all inspiration
[1:04:37] because they all come up out of their
[1:04:38] fox holes went after the Philistines and
[1:04:40] chased them all wait till dark I I
[1:04:43] understand Ain that right amen and
[1:04:45] conquered them ain't that right and
[1:04:46] that's the way it is in our day hello
[1:04:48] brother Braham said he was like that
[1:04:50] David amen God used him like to be that
[1:04:52] David amen that while everybody was
[1:04:54] saying the days of Miracles past there's
[1:04:56] no such a thing as the Holy Ghost God
[1:04:57] don't heal anybody anymore he says well
[1:05:00] you just come and watch come and see
[1:05:02] amen amen and then what did that do
[1:05:04] Tommy Osborne Tom all these other
[1:05:06] brothers that did give all this
[1:05:07] inspiration and amen they went out
[1:05:09] healing amen it giv them inspiration
[1:05:12] here we are in 2024 brother Tommy needs
[1:05:14] still giving people inspiration hey they
[1:05:16] could bring a giant down we can bring
[1:05:18] Giants
[1:05:20] down
[1:05:22] Glory that's right amen you look at the
[1:05:25] book of um Revelations he says you know
[1:05:27] because Thou Art lukewarm and art
[1:05:29] neither cold nor hot amen you are
[1:05:31] miserable wretched poor blind look at
[1:05:33] what it cost look at that Church's
[1:05:36] condition because they did not stay with
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:40] original because they mix stuff I mean
[1:05:43] it does not work to mix anything with
[1:05:45] the word of God I want to tell you
[1:05:47] something tonight that it doesn't work
[1:05:49] for to make you for you to mix any kind
[1:05:51] of a sin or anything that's contrary to
[1:05:53] the word of God if you mix it in your
[1:05:55] life you will become dead you will
[1:05:58] become weak you will become like Samson
[1:06:00] as one of everybody else if you cross
[1:06:03] that word it doesn't mix but there was
[1:06:06] David and the inspiration to come from
[1:06:09] an man all the way at being Saul's uh
[1:06:12] you know Music Man and comforting him in
[1:06:15] all the things that he did is't that
[1:06:17] right getting Spears throw it at him and
[1:06:19] everything else all the way to becoming
[1:06:22] the
[1:06:23] king finally after all all that Fame and
[1:06:26] popularity cuz you know the Bible says
[1:06:28] that I will begin to glorify you I will
[1:06:31] begin to magnify you anybody and God had
[1:06:34] it takes God to do that and he would did
[1:06:36] that with David and allowing him to slay
[1:06:38] slaying those Giants and things am mean
[1:06:40] he come all the way up there to be the
[1:06:42] king and oh my how that he was at home
[1:06:45] perhaps and his armies were fighting for
[1:06:46] him and everything else until one day
[1:06:49] guess what he was out by on a rooftop
[1:06:51] somewhere and he seen a woman taking a
[1:06:54] bath
[1:06:56] ain't that right now one thing brother
[1:06:58] Bram said it was best sheba's
[1:07:01] fault that's what he said because first
[1:07:05] of all she shouldn't have been somewhere
[1:07:06] where somebody can see her taking a
[1:07:08] cotton picking
[1:07:09] bath well he didn't say cotton pick and
[1:07:11] I put that in
[1:07:13] there is't that right but anyway that's
[1:07:16] right that's what he said but then then
[1:07:18] because of that David what did he do he
[1:07:22] fell ain't that right he let sin come in
[1:07:25] in the mind he just thought he could
[1:07:26] keep on
[1:07:28] going but how many knows that goes to
[1:07:30] show that when you mix sin amen there's
[1:07:33] a it's a terrible thing it don't work
[1:07:37] and even though he thought that it was
[1:07:38] hid it wasn't
[1:07:40] hid God sees it how many know God does
[1:07:43] that in our life amen God sees our he
[1:07:47] sees everything about us amen you can't
[1:07:50] fool God you can fool yourself and fool
[1:07:52] others but you can't fool God Amen in
[1:07:54] that example we see how that David
[1:07:56] because of that mixing boy I'll tell you
[1:07:58] what my he brought a reproach upon the
[1:08:01] cause of Christ ain't that right and man
[1:08:04] for years he suffered terribly because
[1:08:07] of that
[1:08:09] mixing how nice it would be in the re
[1:08:11] reason I'm bringing this in is how nice
[1:08:13] it if it have been if David would have
[1:08:15] been stayed on
[1:08:17] track how many believes it's important
[1:08:19] to stay on
[1:08:22] track once you get on track stay on on
[1:08:26] track I like what Paul said having done
[1:08:29] all to stand stand therefore having your
[1:08:32] lines G about with truth and having all
[1:08:34] the shield up having your faith up to
[1:08:36] where you can quench all the fiery darts
[1:08:39] of the wicked amen cuz how many knows
[1:08:42] that every one of us is oh we might be
[1:08:44] as spiritual as the brother random
[1:08:46] was huh but listen even he was fallible
[1:08:50] how many knows as long as you're human
[1:08:52] you're fallible even the prophet was
[1:08:54] fallible and he made mistakes he did
[1:08:57] things he shouldn't have
[1:08:59] done amen how nice it would have been
[1:09:01] for blood brandom he would have had a
[1:09:02] lot less stomach trouble and a whole lot
[1:09:04] of less pain and Agony for the next few
[1:09:06] years if he had just listen to the god
[1:09:08] listen to God and not going on up there
[1:09:10] with those men that time in Africa amen
[1:09:14] how much he how much better better off
[1:09:16] brother Brandon would have been and this
[1:09:18] is not in the notes it just comes to me
[1:09:19] as I'm thinking but what about brother
[1:09:22] brand look at brother brandham in his
[1:09:23] early Ministry when even his wife said
[1:09:25] look go with you I I'm with you I
[1:09:26] married you and I don't care what my
[1:09:28] mama said called him a bunch of trash
[1:09:30] this sat or the other but brother ran
[1:09:31] him listened to his mother-in-law and
[1:09:33] man oh
[1:09:35] man did it ever cost
[1:09:38] him he was even going over a Falls
[1:09:42] fixing the head over a Falls because his
[1:09:44] engine in his the boat wouldn't start
[1:09:46] that voice keep saying he he says you
[1:09:48] know what kind of trash is what kind of
[1:09:50] try I'm sorry I'm sorry that I listen to
[1:09:52] her isn't that right and finally that
[1:09:54] thing started up his wife child no
[1:09:58] matter how much he prayed God still took
[1:10:00] him home amen and I like that word took
[1:10:03] him home amen they're not lost I mean he
[1:10:06] didn't lose them he just separated them
[1:10:08] from them for a while amen God was
[1:10:11] teaching him and the pain and the agony
[1:10:14] amen it comes when you mix anything else
[1:10:16] in your life other than the word of God
[1:10:19] Amen because we're not supposed to mix
[1:10:21] anything else with it amen praise the
[1:10:24] Lord
[1:10:26] amen now let's let's look at this
[1:10:28] scripture here for a few
[1:10:30] minutes well I won't go into Samson
[1:10:34] daythan achen Moses Peter a't that right
[1:10:39] even Peter he kept saying oh you know
[1:10:42] not my hands only but also my hands not
[1:10:45] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:10:46] head always putting something in it and
[1:10:48] whenever he after his new birth he cided
[1:10:51] kind of with the Jews and being
[1:10:53] circumcised and and and keeping some of
[1:10:55] the law and Paul had to come and said
[1:10:57] men what are you doing Paul had to
[1:11:00] correct Peter didn't he that's right
[1:11:01] even he got in trouble with Paul because
[1:11:03] he was you know going back to a little
[1:11:05] bit of the law and trying to lean to him
[1:11:06] and so forth and it but didn't do him
[1:11:08] any good amen but all of those but we
[1:11:11] won't go so much into that we want to
[1:11:12] talk a little bit about let's talk about

[1:12:10] something that's mixed you got to spray

[1:14:08] prayed up and then you'll do like the
[1:14:10] prophet says Ah he didn't mean to do
[1:14:12] that she didn't mean to do that that's a
[1:14:15] good way to keep that bug right off of
[1:14:18] you because the devil wants you to get
[1:14:20] that bug he wants you to have that
[1:14:21] attitude or that
[1:14:23] bitterness that's what he wants
[1:14:29] amen another place I was reading about
[1:14:31] how you don't have to Baby people he was
[1:14:33] talking about well SI sister tells
[1:14:34] somebody else to come come to church
[1:14:36] sometime you come with me and then I'll
[1:14:38] go with you sometime brother says you

[1:14:44] hybrid
[1:14:46] amen hybrid we don't want to be hybrid
[1:14:48] do we no we don't want to be hybrid we
[1:14:51] want to be original amen rugged
[1:14:54] Christian
[1:14:57] amen all right now let me see where
[1:14:59] we're at praise the Lord what's a hybrid
[1:15:03] all right don't have to be stay sprayed
[1:15:05] and stuff like that it's original a
[1:15:07] plant you don't have to spray it because
[1:15:08] it's good and healthy it's a good and
[1:15:11] healthy bug brother Bram is talking to
[1:15:14] his doctor friend he says what makes
[1:15:16] disease come into the human body as I'm
[1:15:19] told by my precious doctor friend of
[1:15:20] mine and I'll go on and listen he says a
[1:15:23] book in his office he had where he keeps
[1:15:25] all of these books of the lead latest
[1:15:27] stuff on medicine he says what it is
[1:15:30] what makes uh brings diseases and
[1:15:32] sickness is
[1:15:33] weakness he says your body you say well
[1:15:36] my body's really run down you'll take a
[1:15:39] cold right quick isn't that the truth
[1:15:41] you get so War out so that's when it's
[1:15:44] the easiest time for a bug or a sickness
[1:15:47] or a cold or something to come in and
[1:15:50] how many knows that applies
[1:15:52] spiritually spiritually when you're
[1:15:54] spirit weak that's the easiest time for
[1:15:57] a bug to crawl on you or a disease to
[1:16:00] come in amen see and because that
[1:16:04] weakness in your body produces a mucous
[1:16:06] out of your glands and then that old
[1:16:07] cold germ beds itself and you got a cal
[1:16:10] but if that body was strong it would
[1:16:12] throw away amen that cold germ it just
[1:16:15] couldn't touch it you so you see God
[1:16:18] constructed a man in the first place and
[1:16:20] he was immune from any disease but
[1:16:22] unbelief in science and education has
[1:16:24] took it away from him amen praise the L
[1:16:27] remember you don't have to pet
[1:16:30] Christians Christians are
[1:16:35] rugged there are men and women of God
[1:16:37] who stand for God regardless of what
[1:16:40] anybody else has got to say about it you
[1:16:42] don't have to beg them and persuade them
[1:16:45] perfume them or baby them around that's
[1:16:48] hot bed plants he says that's not good
[1:16:50] at all they'll never produce anything
[1:16:52] the next one he talks about he says and
[1:16:53] he was talking about took a bird for an
[1:16:55] example but he another place he talks
[1:16:57] about eggs how that a hen can baby those
[1:17:00] eggs and roll them and you know get on
[1:17:03] top of them eggs and just baby them and
[1:17:06] oh my until she's so starved hardly she
[1:17:08] can't even hardly get around anymore but
[1:17:10] if them little eggs if she hadn't been
[1:17:12] with that rooster before them eggs and
[1:17:13] if they aren't fertile all the baby and
[1:17:15] in the
[1:17:17] world they'll still never produce
[1:17:20] anything
[1:17:23] amen amen
[1:17:27] I'm going to say it it comes to my mind
[1:17:28] I'm the pastor of a church and I'm here

[1:22:49] women are becoming the whole generation
[1:22:51] BEC extinct almost if we keep going the
[1:22:53] way that we are and that's just about

[1:23:30] exactly like the even the church has
[1:23:31] come to it just a bunch of hybrid
[1:23:34] they've crossed it with the B baptism of
[1:23:36] the Holy Ghost for church affiliation
[1:23:38] and like I said a while ago once again
[1:23:39] recapping on Revelations there he says
[1:23:42] they had become neither cold nor warm
[1:23:45] but lukewarm therefore and knowest not
[1:23:47] that thou wretched miserable poor blind
[1:23:49] and naked because they
[1:23:51] mixed amen how many believes if you get
[1:23:53] lukewarm you're going to going to be
[1:23:54] mixed not worth a whole lot
[1:23:59] amen but real men of God are rugged
[1:24:02] listen to what he says
[1:24:04] now he saw this was actually the last
[1:24:07] quote on a certain quote that I wanted
[1:24:09] to bring when it looks like everything's
[1:24:11] gone wrong God's giving you a trial he's
[1:24:13] got confidence in you you're not a
[1:24:15] hotbed plant you're a hybrid you're a
[1:24:18] real Christian God's giving you a test
[1:24:21] see what you'll do about it
[1:24:25] remember now God counted you worthy when
[1:24:28] you have a test now don't fail this you
[1:24:30] to get this when you have a trial or a
[1:24:33] test it shows the grace of God you that
[1:24:37] you have found favor with
[1:24:40] god
[1:24:42] wow I had a sticky P Sticky Thing up
[1:24:45] here he says well I'll be glad for the
[1:24:47] day that we don't have to preach on
[1:24:48] trials and troubles anymore wouldn't it
[1:24:51] be nice if I could come up and say no
[1:24:53] there's no trials no test no no hard
[1:24:55] time no as long as you're alive and
[1:24:57] sucking air you're going to experience
[1:24:59] tests and trials and hardships things
[1:25:01] are going to come your
[1:25:02] way but whatever comes your way amen is
[1:25:07] allow of God I hope every one of you
[1:25:10] have a absolutely problemist week this
[1:25:13] week I hope everything goes
[1:25:15] good amen but I sure ain't going to
[1:25:18] promise it God only knows what we're
[1:25:20] going to face this week what you're
[1:25:22] going to face this week but if you do
[1:25:25] have a test you do have a trial I want
[1:25:27] you to understand something that you
[1:25:29] found favor with God according to the
[1:25:31] prophet of God and God believes that
[1:25:33] you'll stand the test just like job said
[1:25:37] man he said God said he's a perfect
[1:25:39] servant there's none like him in all the
[1:25:41] Earth there's nobody like job he's a
[1:25:44] perfect man he's my pride and
[1:25:48] joy how many knows Paul man he knews
[1:25:51] what it was like to be forsaken stripes
[1:25:53] and imprison ments and all these other
[1:25:55] things he knows how to both have have
[1:25:58] plenty and how to suffer need and when
[1:26:01] he said that there in Philippians I
[1:26:03] believe it is he says I have learned
[1:26:04] this one thing I have learned to do that
[1:26:07] is in whatever state that I'm
[1:26:10] in I'm still
[1:26:13] original I'm content whatever state
[1:26:17] whatever comes my way I'll stay in my
[1:26:20] place that God has placed me I won't let
[1:26:23] it move me
[1:26:24] how many believes a real uh genuine
[1:26:28] person of God not a hot plant amen they
[1:26:30] can fulfill reel I mean Romans 8 he says
[1:26:33] you know that uh you what shall separate
[1:26:35] is from the love of God persecution
[1:26:38] distress ain't that right all these
[1:26:41] things nay not life not death not
[1:26:43] anything shall be able to separate me
[1:26:45] from the love that is in Christ Jesus
[1:26:47] that is a real
[1:26:49] genuine son and daughter of God i' bet
[1:26:53] plant can can't take one little slap one
[1:26:56] slap on the
[1:27:01] cheek but Peter I mean Jesus Promised
[1:27:04] You this and he lifted up his eyes on
[1:27:05] his disciples and said blessed be ye
[1:27:08] poor for yours is the kingdom of God
[1:27:10] blessed are ye that are hungry now for
[1:27:13] ye shall be
[1:27:15] filled he never said no you're never
[1:27:17] going to suffer need you're never going
[1:27:19] to be hungry he said blessed are you if
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:22] do amen he knew what it was
[1:27:25] coming a that right I mean the very
[1:27:29] Master our Master our Lord was hung on a
[1:27:33] pole and crucified false accused isn't
[1:27:36] that right he died under capital
[1:27:39] punishment because of false
[1:27:44] accusations false testimony
[1:27:48] lies so when people lie about you don't
[1:27:50] let that they lied about him too hung
[1:27:53] him on on the tree and every one of the
[1:27:55] disciples except John the Revelator amen
[1:27:57] were killed in some terrible manner P
[1:28:00] Paul even having his head cut
[1:28:03] off
[1:28:05] amen I always thought that was a pretty
[1:28:08] good quick way to go brother
[1:28:10] Woody have one of the big old axes come
[1:28:12] up there and just a good sharp knife
[1:28:16] you'd feel a little sting and be about
[1:28:17] it

[1:28:22] huh I don't want to burn though I don't
[1:28:24] like the find idea of
[1:28:28] fire but how many knows down through
[1:28:31] Dark Ages they got roasted on
[1:28:33] poles roasted
[1:28:36] alive but you couldn't get that hot hot

[1:29:50] a lion lot of Christians had to fight
[1:29:53] lions
[1:29:54] thrust through with the sword killed in
[1:29:57] every manner if there's ever was amen
[1:30:02] people that died ruthlessly under and
[1:30:05] the most horriblest ways it's
[1:30:07] Christians

[1:30:14] bride goes ain't that right woe to the
[1:30:17] inhabiters of the earth then for the
[1:30:19] devil has come down to you and he knows
[1:30:21] that he has but a short time but bram's

[1:30:25] somebody if you don't have permission
[1:30:27] they'll shoot
[1:30:35] you but rugged Christians you take him I
[1:30:40] remember martyr's
[1:30:41] mirror I got to have a book I don't know
[1:30:44] if we have books like that brother but
[1:30:45] get us some original martyr mirror book
[1:30:48] back there Abraham Lincoln he was he
[1:30:51] was molded brother Bram says because of
[1:30:54] Godly mother the Bible and the fox's
[1:30:56] book of
[1:30:57] Martyrs I remember many times amen
[1:31:00] sitting by the coal stove in the winter
[1:31:02] time and wind whistling and everything
[1:31:04] else and going through martyr's mirror
[1:31:05] book and looking at those that were
[1:31:07] coming and having their head come back
[1:31:09] up out and their bellies were already
[1:31:11] fat and full from water and they had
[1:31:13] made them suck water and drowning them
[1:31:16] trying to get them to recant is't that
[1:31:18] right but you can't drown it out of a
[1:31:21] genuine pure bread
[1:31:24] no you can't you they' rather suck their
[1:31:26] lungs full of water and go over to the
[1:31:28] other world than to succumb to the
[1:31:30] devil's temptation of giving in because
[1:31:32] they're fixing to drown or be buried or
[1:31:36] burnt or have uh you know the what is
[1:31:40] that thing something that closes in on
[1:31:43] you it's got razor blade and spikes and
[1:31:46] and it comes together and kills you in
[1:31:47] that way or if you said something
[1:31:50] against the Pope that had a barrel lined
[1:31:52] with razor blades to roll you around
[1:31:55] in Cruel punishment amen cruel things
[1:31:59] they
[1:32:01] suffered but to hell why because there's
[1:32:05] something in there they wouldn't give up
[1:32:06] for the world how many's with me tonight
[1:32:09] there's something in my heart here that
[1:32:11] I won't give up for no pleasure for no
[1:32:18] Lea no matter how tempting it might be
[1:32:22] to just to be live a life of these no
[1:32:25] huh rugged Christians are rugged they're
[1:32:29] pedigree I like pedigree Christians
[1:32:31] brother brandom said
[1:32:34] amen all
[1:32:36] right see job he was God's servant he's
[1:32:39] my pride and joy sure Satan said if he
[1:32:42] gets that's because he gets what he asks
[1:32:45] for said let me have him once I'll make
[1:32:47] him curse you to your face I'll just
[1:32:49] make him curse you God said he's in your
[1:32:51] hands but you can't take his life see
[1:32:53] God had confidence in job amen and it
[1:32:58] goes to show that if you do have a trial
[1:33:01] if you do have a test it's because God
[1:33:03] has
[1:33:04] confidence in
[1:33:07] you amen is't that a wonderful way to
[1:33:09] look at it and say you know man I'll
[1:33:11] tell you what I didn't see this
[1:33:13] coming but that's always the time the
[1:33:16] ones that gets us right the ones we
[1:33:17] don't see
[1:33:20] coming and no matter how ready we are
[1:33:22] we're not ready
[1:33:24] we thought we were ready but we're
[1:33:29] not and the best oh boy here you go
[1:33:32] listen carefully the best trials are the
[1:33:34] ones that you really can't control don't
[1:33:36] have no control of you can't change it
[1:33:39] if you
[1:33:41] tried no matter how you try how hard you
[1:33:43] try you can't change it those are the
[1:33:46] best ones because if you could you would
[1:33:49] that's when you find out what you're
[1:33:50] really made of
[1:33:56] um May I'll just say what comes to my
[1:33:58] brain right now if you ain't tough you
[1:34:01] aren't going to make it in this
[1:34:03] world
[1:34:05] Amen that's right you have to be
[1:34:08] tough amen tough to defeat and come
[1:34:12] against evil and things that want to
[1:34:14] upset you and tear you
[1:34:17] apart amen that wants to change your
[1:34:22] character amen
[1:34:26] and we won't let the devil do it will
[1:34:29] we no even Jesus didn't bless us a
[1:34:32] flowery bed of ease he said blessed are
[1:34:35] you when men shall hate you and shall
[1:34:37] separate you from their
[1:34:39] company amen and reproach you say bad
[1:34:43] things about you cast your name out as
[1:34:46] evil for the son of man sake Rejoice ye
[1:34:48] in that day and leap for Joy for behold
[1:34:51] your reward is great in heaven for in
[1:34:54] like manner also did their Prophet did
[1:34:56] their fathers unto the prophets but woe
[1:35:00] unto you that are rich and that you have
[1:35:02] reached your consolation woe to you that
[1:35:04] are full for ye shall hunger woe unto
[1:35:07] you that laugh now for ye shall mourn wo
[1:35:10] unto you when men all men shall speak
[1:35:12] well of you for so did their fathers to
[1:35:14] the false prophets so you think in the
[1:35:16] Dark Ages you realize that those people
[1:35:19] were made to look as uh evil people
[1:35:24] they had to die as evil
[1:35:28] people amen a whole lot like today if
[1:35:33] you're conservative or a Christians
[1:35:34] they'll try to make you look like you're
[1:35:36] a hater that you're evil that you're
[1:35:39] wrong huh not only that and then they
[1:35:43] would have to actually give their life
[1:35:44] they were hungry they suffered hunger
[1:35:47] amen but over on the other side it's
[1:35:49] going to be different amen how many beli
[1:35:52] that we're in this hour you and
[1:35:55] I we have it like bu Brandon I'll just
[1:35:58] quote the prophet of God we have it too
[1:36:01] nice our softness doesn't do a lot for
[1:36:05] us no that's why you better be double
[1:36:10] praying I'm just going to say it this
[1:36:13] way if you have it really nice you
[1:36:14] better get to praying real
[1:36:16] hard because it's easy to get soft in
[1:36:19] that time off guard in that time lazy in
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:26] time
[1:36:28] amen help us
[1:36:31] all brother Bram talked about the dog
[1:36:34] lady I call her the dog lady because he
[1:36:37] called her a dog remember that woman
[1:36:40] came to him and want to be healed want
[1:36:42] healing and and and he says you know
[1:36:44] it's not meat to give the children's
[1:36:46] bread to dogs their generation their
[1:36:50] their race was to him call them dogs but
[1:36:53] B says boy the Pentecostals they have
[1:36:55] huffed and blo and they have never come
[1:36:56] back there again but that didn't shake
[1:36:59] that woman's Faith cuz he said that she
[1:37:01] was not a hot bed plant she was pedigree
[1:37:05] she had real faith and she acknowledged
[1:37:07] yeah that's all we are that's
[1:37:10] right that's right you don't want to
[1:37:12] give the children's bread to the dogs
[1:37:14] but guess what even the dogs like to eat
[1:37:16] the crumbs that fou from the master's
[1:37:19] table at first he wouldn't even answer
[1:37:22] her remember that amen and then he says
[1:37:24] that you know and my why and that we get
[1:37:27] that famous saying the same famous
[1:37:30] phrase that amen she had the kind of
[1:37:32] faith that God himself couldn't
[1:37:36] stop because those were discouraging
[1:37:39] stopping
[1:37:40] words but yet she had the kind of faith
[1:37:43] that God couldn't even stop her brother
[1:37:45] brand preached on perseverance that's
[1:37:48] what God loves to see in his children
[1:37:51] perseverance down in here that when the
[1:37:53] going gets hard guess
[1:37:56] what oh I won't never forget I I forget
[1:38:00] I think it was when I came back
[1:38:03] from that tent meeting over there in
[1:38:06] Virginia amen and and and I came back
[1:38:09] and preached on how that when a when you
[1:38:11] put pressure on a
[1:38:13] Christian it just makes them
[1:38:16] stronger amen when Wind Blows against a
[1:38:19] Christian it just makes their Roots get
[1:38:22] deeper it works the exact opposite of
[1:38:25] what the devil wants it to work he wants
[1:38:28] you to have road rage he wants you to
[1:38:30] get mad and upset and blow up but
[1:38:33] instead it makes you get on your prayer
[1:38:35] bones and get deeper in
[1:38:37] God Amen how many's glad for that for a
[1:38:41] Christian that's how those things
[1:38:43] work but for an unbeliever in a hot bed
[1:38:46] plant like brother bam said I think
[1:38:48] somewhere right here he says no wonder
[1:38:51] Peter said these fiery trials why count
[1:38:53] it all Jo Joy it's more precious to you
[1:38:56] than gold and all these many times many
[1:38:59] times we Hy and we
[1:39:02] Haul he says but that's just something
[1:39:05] that's God God has given you to overcome
[1:39:08] he knows you'll do it he's put his trust
[1:39:11] in
[1:39:12] you
[1:39:15] amen trials and tests and things that
[1:39:18] come your way they're just to see
[1:39:20] whether you're a hot bit plant or not
[1:39:23] they're just there to see whether you
[1:39:25] really have the goods that you claim to
[1:39:27] have or whether you're not if you're a
[1:39:29] pedigree Christian ain't that
[1:39:34] right 68 million of our brothers and our
[1:39:38] sisters stood to
[1:39:40] test of physical
[1:39:42] harm physical harm most of us probably
[1:39:45] can handle all kinds of things but the
[1:39:47] one thing that we would Sherk at is I
[1:39:50] you know if he's going to put a knife to
[1:39:51] my throat if he's going to put have G
[1:39:53] gone to me if he's going to threaten me
[1:39:55] with my life then
[1:39:57] I we wouldn't be used to that would we
[1:40:01] and hopefully we won't have to because I
[1:40:02] don't think the bride will go through
[1:40:03] that those type of things but you need
[1:40:05] to understand that back in the day you
[1:40:07] had better be ready for those type of
[1:40:09] things amen down through those ages all
[1:40:12] the way to Luther they tried to get
[1:40:14] Luther amen but he had some princes and
[1:40:17] some other countries that gave him Safe
[1:40:19] Harbor a that right kept and protected
[1:40:21] him because the ones that did what he he
[1:40:23] did before him ended up getting killed
[1:40:27] he was just one of the first ones that
[1:40:28] the Lord says no this is my messenger
[1:40:30] I'm going to keep him alive ain't that
[1:40:37] right and does anybody ever say it
[1:40:40] hardly ever you wouldn't hear it hardly
[1:40:42] politicians nobody says hey what about
[1:40:45] it you Catholic religion that killed 68
[1:40:48] million so-called Christians down
[1:40:51] through the Dark Ages ain't that
[1:40:54] right oh they keep hush
[1:40:57] hush why probably because they've got
[1:41:00] the majority of the power even over our
[1:41:02] country and we probably don't even know
[1:41:04] it ain't that right even as the prophet
[1:41:07] of God said amen let's stand
[1:41:14] tonight musicians if you'll come and see
[1:41:18] if you can pull that song up Lord I want
[1:41:21] to be a Christian in my heart in my my
[1:41:25] heart I like that song Don't
[1:41:28] you a real genuine Christians there's
[1:41:31] another song I wouldn't mind singing

[1:41:39] would like to be a millionaire with a
[1:41:41] million to be stole but I'd rather be an
[1:41:44] oldtime Christian than anything I know
