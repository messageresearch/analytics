school everybody if you want to be dismissed for Sunday school amen you got a Lael for you good morning we'll uh turn and read Psalms 37 we'll read verses uh 1- 24 fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass he shall bring for rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prosper in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied the wicked Borth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord with his hand brother Brian Lord bless you all be seated sorry you know I was uh thinking as we read that Psalm excuse me there was a script scure there uh on the 16th scripture there little that the righteous manad is better than the riches of many Wicked so that just lets me know as a Bible believer what wherever God puts you you got to be satisfied in in life you and it's pretty simple you know you see a lot of people might be doing better have more whatever that doesn't mean anything if God has just given you a little and you're happy in it that's all you really need you don't need any more than that and I was thinking you know what brother Thomas was praying about you know sometimes we get in a hurry so much in our life that we miss the little things that God does for us that you know I know for myself being a service tech all these years I'll get in a hurry to go somewhere and there'll be always that one driver that's driving 50 miles an hour keeping you from getting to where you need to be and then you get in a hurry and all of a sudden three or four miles down the road there's a T-bone accident well you might have been the person in that accident if you had if you'd been in a hurry sometimes we forget how much God cares for us and desires to see us prosper in our lives that we shouldn't be in a hurry to do things we just should commit everything that we do every day into the hands of a living God and at the as I was I was thinking this morning on the that first slide this morning of that little country church and I was reminiscing you know it's what been about 34 32 years ago we were in a little Country Church like that you know how time goes so fast sometimes we went from The Little Country Church where you had to share the bathroom with the groundhogs to what we have here this morning so you God has really blessed us this morning and through those blessings we're able to bless his people back at the same time we shouldn't be always taking we should be given back and it was talking about Works without faith you know faith without works it doesn't mean anything everything that God gives us should be to make us successful and want to help one one another but if you would turn I'm off my point but if you would turn with me to Luke the 20th chapter here if I can find my place this morning and uh this one Parable here I'll read this one Parable here this morning this is the chapter where Jesus this is that last couple of weeks and Jesus is in the temple teaching we all know the Pharisees wouldn't accept his teachings but I I'll uh starting about the seventh verse here this morning also I was thinking you know the world we live in before I get started you know brother randam always taught in his messages he always would go back to the Stone Age you know they had the wheel and the Stone Age and then they had the oxen the plow and everyone plowed with the oxen and a wooden plow and that that was their state of technology and that was for hundreds of years thousands of years and then they were able to domesticate the horse and saddle and bridle it and plow and move with it and then they went from the horse to the combustion engine and before the combustion engine the steam engine from the steam engine to the combustion engine and and the electric engine at that time and then he talked about we're in that rocket age where they had chemical Rockets chemical power to be able to move it speeds what what the Earth revolves around about 24,000 miles an hour the speed that kind of speed and I was just thinking this morning well well past the chemical rocket age I mean you're almost in the point where things happen instantaneous like you're not not being a going real crazy you're almost like can warp drive everything that's happening around the world this morning and it just lets me know in my heart that every day is important for me to be in the right position that God wants me to be in this morning that my heart is sealed in in in his grace and in his kingdom this morning and anything outside of that ain't worth worrying about this morning but uh the world that we live in is such a deceitful place it's trying it's trying to bind every bind us every day into things that really don't matter if you're not careful the world will bind you will make you miserable take away your Victory if you let it and before you know it the more the more it binds you it just keeps binding you it never looses those binds so the thing about being a Christian this morning is being free in Jesus Christ this morning if you don't have the freedom in Jesus Christ this morning then you that's what you're here for this morning is to be free like brother Smith said last week you know you have to have that Liberty however God expresses it through you you need the liberty of the Lord this morning but I'll just read what this has to say this morning and uh this is Jesus gave the other Parable they were asking him by what Authority he did the things he did you know and this is starting at about the eth verse and Jesus said on neither tell I you by what Authority I do these again then he speaks this Parable then then he spake to the people this Parable a certain man planted a Vineyard and let LED forth a husbandman and went into a far country for a long time that's speaking where we're at this morning also and at a season he sent a servant to be a husband and should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandman beat him and sent him away empty and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and ENT treated him shamefully and sent him away empty and again he sent a third and wounded him also and cast him out you know that speaks to the Pharisees also speaks to the world we live in this morning and they said the Lord of The Vineyard what shall I do will I send my beloved Son it may be that they will rev him and they will see him but when the husband men saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the hair has come let him kill him that the inheritance might be ours so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the Lord of The Vineyard do unto them he he shall come and destroy these husband men and shall give the vineyard to the others and when they heard they they said God forbid and then this is what I was thinking about last week and he beheld them and said what is this then that this is written the stone which the builders rejected is the same become the head of the corner and whosoever shall fall upon this Stone shall be broken but who who soever it shall fall it will grind him to powder and that's basically what I was thinking that's our choice this morning you either fall on the S on the stone and you let God break you this morning or one day that stone is going to fall upon the whole earth and it's going to shatter it to pieces and you have that choice we all have that choice this morning and you can jump to Peter first Peter the second chapter here I think I got the right place here I might have been thinking too much and then yeah it's the second chapter of uh first Peter I mean these scriptures mean as much today as they did in Peter's Day wherefore laying aside all malice and all G and hypocrisies and envies and evil speakings you know all the scripture that we read whether it was in Moses's time or in our time it continually is fresh and it speaks to our hearts every day that's right if you keep yourself open and as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that you might grow thereby and you can only grow by the word of God if you if you're one of those Christians that reads it on every Sunday morning and puts it away the rest of the week that's going to be your growth that's as big as your plant's going to be but you have to read it daily and it goes on to say it so be that you have tasted the Lord is gracious to whom coming as onto a living Stone disavowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also are Lively stones that are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ that's where we're at this morning wherefore all also if the contained in the scriptures behold I lay and Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded and this goes back to the 20th chapter of Luke this is the choice we make every day and he goes on unto you there fors which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient that stone which the builders disavow the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where on they were appointed but you are a chosen generation a royal Pethood a holy nation and this is really important not that you make yourself peculiar but God just through his changing your heart and life makes you a peculiar person to the people that you're around they look at you and they see something in you that they might want something in you that's different that makes you peculiar and it's not you doing it myself not repeating myself but it's really important it's not you doing it it's God in your heart changing you and making you who he wants you to be in the age that we live in this morning and uh CH uh I'm going to re repeat myself here I'm let me find my place peace I lost my place here yeah you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people you should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of the darkness into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but now are a people of God which obtained mercy and and now have obtained Mercy dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims again I mean this time and time again through the scriptures abstaining from freshly lust which war against the soul and having your conversations honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers they may by your good works which show be beheld the glory god in the day of visitation so you don't know I'll just finish with this thought you know a lot of times you know we get it in ruts in our lives we get in circumstances but that man out there or that woman out there he's watching you when you he sees the Hard Knocks eating you in your life he's watching you seeing how what your character is and seeing how you react to the hard situations in your life he's and if he sees you acting like the true Christian you are going through the struggles of your life you be surprised how much that changes people in the life if you just be the example for them this morning so may God bless you all Brother David amen you love the Lord this morning yes it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen I just appreciate the Lord this morning and little chor come on my heart as with Brian was teaching Sunday school this morning and we're a blessed people this morning and that little chorus come

thin over the years through a lot of bumps and hills and valleys and mountains at the end of the road we're going to be standing handin hand Victorious thank the Lord if you have your Bibles this morning we're going to turn to Mark chapter 12 and I'm going to I'm going to plagiarize a little bit this morning I know the president got in TR in trouble doing that at least your president he ain't mine but um some some of y'all didn't catch that I didn't vote I didn't vote him in so ain't my president I got one commanderin-chief his name's Jesus would uh Mark 12:42 very familiar story but I'm going to take a little bit of different turn from it this morning so so don't try to get ahead of me Mark 12:42 and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites now if you don't know what a m is it's not what's on chickens okay one might is one F of a penny one fifth or 20% of a penny she gave two as her offering what wasn't much we don't have any in our currency less than a penny that's the lowest it goes but in their currency she gave two mites which was one m is one fif of a penny which make a farthing verse 43 and he called talking about Jesus he called unto his disciples and said unto them verily I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want she wanted to throw it in she wanted to give an offering it wasn't a ritual it wasn't something she had to do she gave it from her heart the Bible says from her want she did cast in all that she had even all her living let's bow our heads Eternal Father we stand here today helpless in your sight Lord I'm I'm just a vessel I'm just a uh jar of clay this morning God fill me up with your word this morning to speak to these people the things that you would have them to hear not only anoint me to speak your word but anoint them to hear hear what the spirit would saith unto the church this morning as I submit myself to you may they submit themselves to you as well whatever you want to say you have full Liberty this morning to say we give it to you may every heart every life be blessed those streaming those that would archive may you bless them as well we give this service to you we be give careful to give you the praise honor and glory in Jesus name and the church said amen God bless you you can be seated this morning I'll try to keep track of the time um I'm going to I'm going to take a a a thought or a a line from our military uh the Marines some of you we got veterans I'm sure here this morning but the slogan for the Marine Corps is all gave some but some gave all I want you to let that sink in for just a minute all gave some but some gave all it's easy to give some out of an abundance it's easy to give some a $5 bill ain't much to a millionaire but you got a widow woman that's raising eight kids on three jobs $5 bill lot of money to her it it all depends on what you have and if you give it from the want of your heart not out of I have to do this or I have to no God never makes anybody do anything he wants you to do it from an open heart when Moses I'm going to have you turn to several scriptures this morning when Moses was going to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness Moses called the people to bring their offering so they could build the church you know this church don't run off of love you don't pay the light bill out of love gets quiet when you talking about money people just do you know I'll give you a statistic money is the number one Topic in the entire Bible talks more about money in the Bible than any other topic see how quiet it is that's what it needs to be talked about cuz got too many stingy folk think they put a dollar bill in offer and think they' done something 10 statistic I've been a pastor 24 years I read a lot of Statistics St statistics say that only 10% of the congregation supports the entire church 10% some of you putting locks on your purses and your wallet right now throwing away the he ain't getting none of mine I don't want it he does and it ain't just about money my friend see when you do something for God you you need give your all love the Lord thy God with all your heart with all your soul come on somebody with all your strength don't just come to church and raise your hand a few few times say Amen six times I and say I've done something you ain't done nothing when you come to church put your all into it worship God in spirit and TR from your heart when you leave he here be as sweaty as the preacher oh y'all just sit there and some of you take your your morning nap on Sunday morning shame on you that's right sitting there on Facebook shame on you some can give a little some can give you know all can give some there's only a few that can give all Jesus makes a note of this little widow woman that threw in two mes a fifth of a penny each now these other rich men were throwing in from the abundance of their treasury no big deal drop in a 50 or 20 $100 bill no big deal to them they got an abundance they gave some but she gave all he said she gave all her living now if I was to preach the book of Acts this morning as if we was in the book of Acts then people brought Peter everything got no Bible readers here signed over their property to him remember Anan and Safar they didn't have to tell him a lie they didn't even have to give him out all the money from the prophet just don't lie to God but they were willing the other people were will willing to to come in and lay their treasures at Peter's feet if if I preach that which is in the Bible I wonder how many people would be willing because that's what he's looking for obedient heart willing heart when the Rich Young Ruler come to Jesus he said what must I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said Keep keep the Commandments I wonder how many this morning can answer him the same way the Rich Young Ruler did he said all these have I done from my youth there ain't a person here that can say you've kept all Ten Commandments from your youth but he had that testimony all these have I done for my youth and Jesus looked at him and said one thing one thing only that thou lackest yeah he wasn't willing now Jesus didn't require him to give everything that he had but he wanted him to be willing to give everything that he had you see the difference God don't require it but he wants you to be willing cuz I'm tell you you could drop right now with a heart attack and what work you ain't taking your money with you only one thing you're taking with you my friend is character and character is not a gift it is a victory so therefore you got to fight for it you ain't taking a dime with you we measure people in society by how much they own or or how many toys they have how many trips they've been on how many times they've been around the world and in the Caribbean and here and there and there God God God don't measure people like that he rebuked Samuel when Samuel went down to Bethlehem to find a king and King seen the the old son of Jesse eliab and he said surely th this is this is the man that God has chose to be king because the standard at that time was King Saul Head and Shoulders above all of Israel and so eliab was a good-sized man so Samuel was was uh measuring eliab up against Saul and God said I have rejected him I I don't look at man like you look at man we need all of us this morning under the sound of my voice we we need to empty our pockets of rocks ain't a person here got a right to throw a rock at nobody for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God don't you look down your nose on somebody that's struggling with something you struggled with something you fought demons you had ISS issues you had Pro problems and you wanted somebody to pray with you and for you give them time to be Sanctified sanctification is a process come on somebody a birth is a process Justified Sanctified baptism the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit himself it takes time time give them time work with them pray with them love them you know remember brother Ram talking about Papa Cox brother Charlie's daddy and he said Papa you let me baptize you I'll buy you all the cigarettes you can suck quiet in here he told him he said you let me baptize you because brother bradam knew if he he he got in touch with the Holy Ghost he wouldn't have no more desire for second cigarettes you let me baptize you papa Cox and I'll buy all your cigarettes see we preachers today are so proper and Prim and we can't say things like that but I do because I'm a renegade and I don't care what anybody thinks about me you can take your opinion of me and shove it down the sewer because I don't care what you think about me I I care what you think about the word I'm preaching to you cuz I ain't I ain't I I ain't perfecting you the word is perfecting you so therefore I don't care what you think about oh he's a hard preacher you ain't been listening to many tapes I've been accused of being a heart breacher he brother Daniel's got no love this is the house of correction those I love I rebuke and I chasen says the Lord that's what love is you love your children you correct your children Lord this woman woman out of the out of the abundance of her heart she wanted to give all that she had some gave all gave some but she gave all like I said it's not just about money when you come to church when you're witnessing to somebody at least act like you're happy about about your religion at least act like it be salty Shine Your Light there may be a seat of God in there come on see the Comm the Great Commission is not just to ministers go you into all the world it's not just to preachers you have your own congregation in your world that you preach to every day of your life and it's your lived voice the testimony that you live in front of the of them is preaching to them and in many ways you reach more people than we can cuz I I don't live here I'm not I'm not in your everyday world I don't work with you I don't know your co-workers I don't know know your intimate family but you do so it's up to you to Shine the Light it's up to you to be salty come on somebody the the it ain't up to the preachers to do it all we're not nians we don't take the power from the people every Christian has the authority that a pastor does if your child falls on the driveway and breaks it his leg on falls off a bicycle whatever falls out a tree playing TOs and whatever you got to write anoint him with oil pray for him right you don't have to wait for brother berer call call on God and God will raise him up he'll hear a Mama's Prayer he'll hear a daddy's prayer he'll hear a lay man's prayer but see we we want to put the you know like when God came down to Adam and said what hast thou done and Adam said that woman you gave me everybody wants to play the blame game and put off on somebody else on want somebody else to take care of it they don't want the responsibility they want don't want the monkey on their back so to speak it's easy to do that that woman you gave me he's actually blaming God for the fall if you you hadn't give me that woman there wouldn't have been a fall we do the same thing we grow up we come we become men and women we get married and we got we got Hang-Ups we got issues we got habits and we blame it on our parents I got this from my daddy it's genetic Holy Ghost stops genetics Holy Ghost stops culture remember brother brand in Africa preaching them half naked women in in the audience they didn't know no different they weren trying to be sexy that's how they dressed that was their culture and he said how many wants to receive the Holy Ghost and they raised their hand and came back the next night dressed covered up he didn't tell them to do that God the Holy Ghost in them told them to cover up if you ever get a real taste of the the Holy Ghost the desire for that nonsense will leave you you don't have to quit it he'll quit it for you that hunger that craving that desire for alcohol and drugs and women ging he'll take it from you if you're willing to give it to him you got to be willing to give it up and he'll take every one of them from you this morning I've had my hangups I've had my dependencies I've had my demons I struggled with with that I couldn't overcome by myself so I had to come to a place said God I'm giving it all to you because the battle is yours said Little David David was no match for Goliath you're no match for the devil but my God is more than a match for the devil if you'll be willing to lay it on the to say God I can't do it take it from me take the desire from me and you'll never do it again after brother Brandon baptized PO papax he never smoked again because he knew what the Holy Ghost would do inside of him it ain't you getting cleaned up to take a bath well well I'll come to church as soon as I stop doing this no you need to be in church while you're doing it and let the Holy Ghost change your nature change your desire because if there if there's anything you can do to get into heaven Jesus died in vain there's nothing you can do you cannot be good enough to get into the kingdom go of God he paid the price and we get the reward I remember a story I might have told it here it's been a while since I've been here but Bear's repeating there was a man that had just got saved and he started ministering to drug addicts and alcoholics and people like that he he was he was a horrible addict addict himself and so he was the one Church giving his testimony and a man come up to him after service and uh he said uh brother so and so I'm struggling with marijuana he said uh do I have to quit smoking dope to accept Jesus and the preacher looked at him said no some of you ain't getting it I'm going to rewind it do I have to stop smoking dope to accept Jesus he said no he said the man asked me three times do I have to smoke stop smoking marijuana to accept Jesus he said no then then he pulled the joint out of his pocket the marijuana joint the doobie back in the day that's what they called it right he pulled it out of his pocket and waved it in front of the nose of the man man had just been delivered from it and he's going I rebuke you in Jesus name I rebuke you in Jesus name he said do I have to stop smoking this to accept Jes he said read my lips no and and the adct said I don't understand why I don't have to quit this to accept Jesus one of the most powerful things come out of a a human mouth was these words do you have to get cleaned up to take a bath cuz if you can clean yourself up you don't need a bath that's right because you quit it on your own you'll pick it back up on your own but if he takes it from you you'll hate from that day forward you'll never desire it again and you got to give it all give it all to him say Lord I can't do this on my own I give it to you take it from me take the desire from me it's it's been millions of people stop smoking C cigarettes and through them in the woods and watch where they landed threw a half bottle of liquor in the woods and watch where it landed so they could go back in the middle of the night pick it up they didn't give it up they just going through the motions people coming to church ain't even Sav they're just going through the motions because they don't want to go to hell I don't go to church because I'm scared of hell I already deserve hell whether I come to church or not I'm not worthy of heaven I'm not worthy of Mansion I'm not worthy of golden streets Gates of Pur walls ofest I'm not worthy of that that on my best day it's only by Grace any of us are going to get there not of Works lest any man should boast you can't be good enough for Christ to receive you because God himself don't see you he sees the blood anyway because if he seen you he would never accept you in your condition but thank God he don't see me he hears my voice coming up through the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you he didn't open the door and look inside he was looking for the token he was looking for the life he was looking for the blood and once he seen the blood he passed over them that's what he's looking for today the token life and once he sees the life he'll pass over you remember now you you go read Exodus 12 and find out who the death angel really is the death angel my friend is is not Satan because God said behold I will pass through Egypt this night and I will Smite all the firstborn go read it I'm a Bible reader I know what I'm talking about behold I will pass through Egypt this night and I will Smite on the first woman that don't have the blood on on the doorpost in Atlanta God's the one doing it you know who's going to bring Vengeance and wrath on this generation it ain't the devil it's God I promise you you don't want to be here under the Vengeance and the wrath of God Satan has nothing on God when it comes to wrath and Vengeance that's why even the elements that you can't see are going to burn with a fect heat in the Millennium excuse in the uh tribulation I promise you you don't want to be here and and we even see pre-tribulation things going on now now I'll be real careful when I say this but under this current presidential Administration uh almost 12 million illegal immigrants now I'm not in any any shape form or fashion racist every every body All Nations tribes tongues colors races or will be in the body of Christ and I have no problem with immigrants coming to this country if I was an immigrant I'd want to come to this country but do it the right way don't do it illegally nearly 12 million under this Administration has snuck in illegally and now they're killing and rap raping a kids and a women brute beasts and they're doing nothing about it so here we are living inia and the Bible says Luke 17 as it was in the days of Noah go look what was happening in the days of Noah days of violence and the days of of uh lot perversion and violence what got them both R running over the cup like brother B said in his prayer somebody tried to take up P Trump last night but see if if if God has ordained for him to be be be the 47th president ain't nobody going to take him out nobody going to take him out because understand this all politics is of the devil oh I'm a republican Republicans are of the devil too all politics I'll let you Republicans uh cool down a minute they're all of the devil they tell lies just as much as the Democrats do just to get in office have a place of authority make laws tell you what you can and can't do and we're living in this hour to where now our country is flooded with illegal immigrants that are doing things you you you uh no doubt you heard of the young girl at University of Georgia just a month or two ago Lake and Riley 20 minutes from my house raped and murdered ille illegal immigrant nothing's being done Camala Harris supp to be the Zar of the Border she's been there one time in three and a half years they're just letting them flood in but if God's got a man that's going to stop it Satan can't take him out understand this your vote didn't get nobody in and your vote ain't going to take nobody out God if God wants a certain man in he's going to get in see 1960 when JFK got voted in by a woman's vote prophet God tells it was the wrong man voted in got tape listeners here this morning he said they voted the wrong man in that's why he got killed he was the wrong man God took him out God's in control of the all the politics he has to set up the stage for the tribulation he has to get men in position to turn against against Israel like they're doing now have you ever seen so many Palestinian Flags in your life and this country supposed to be 100% pro-israel they ain't somebody's got to set the stage for a Rapture to make this country turn against Israel because God told Abraham everybody that blesses you I'll bless and everybody that curses you will be cursed there got a coming day that America will curse Israel and God has already cursed America 1963 indictment brother brother said I won't even pray for her anymore she's gone burn over territory Revival is over in America hello somebody his wife said well aren't we Americans brother Ram said no we're Christians we are not of this World we're only in it John 17 Jesus told the father he said they are not of this world just as I am not of this world I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger but I'm coming back to where it will be my world I I wouldn't want this world if you give it to me in the in the condition that's in right now but let the fire burn it over and we can start from scratch so this widow woman I'm going to move on this widow woman gave all that she had all her living and Jesus made a not of of this little widow woman that gave in two Ms a fifth of a penny he acknowledged her in front of all these rich men and these rich men gave way way more money but according to what they had they only gave a little they gave some but she gave all now I'm going go to a scripture that's going going to shake some of you so put your seat belt on Exodus 25 Exodus 25 verse1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man listen again that giveth it God ain't taking it God ain't making you cry Uncle okay okay I'll give him one the offering no it's got to be willingly of every man that giveth it willingly willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering and this is the offering which he shall take of them gold and silver and brass and he goes on all the things he took up for an offering turn to chapter 36 of Exodus verse three now Moses put certain men in charge of building certain things in the Tabernacle they were talented Carpenters or brick layers or whatever they were and he he put these men in a place to start building the t uh Tabernacle in the wilderness verse verse number three now let's start verse two Moses called Biz and a holab and every wise-hearted man in whose heart the Lord had put wisdom even everyone whose heart stirred him up to come up to uh uh unto the work to do it and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary to make it with all and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning I'll go on verse four all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made and they spake unto Moses saying the people people bring much more than enough for the service of the Lord I have never told my people you're bringing too much money and I know he ain't either I don't know of a church under under the blue skies of Heaven that ever told their congregation stop giving off you're giv too much I guess I just need to read the Bible for you the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to make listen and Moses gave commandment and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp saying let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the S Sanctuary so the the people were restrained from bringing all gave some but some gave all sounds like to me all of Israel gave all because Moses had to put a stop to taking the offering tell them hey we got enough we got enough don't bring no more offering now for when I I started the church at Pastor in 2000 March 12th 2000 obviously I didn't have no people in position I didn't have no deacons no Tres no officers I was everything I did it all right thousand foot uh office building I started the church in so I did everything until it got people that was qualified to be deconstruct and what more and so I knew every dime that was coming in I still do uh for the most part and sometimes on Wednesday night you know Wednesday Wednesday night is the night that people mostly backslide see I'm not judging this church by how many is here I want to come on a Wednesday night see brother Bram said if you love the church you come on Sunday morning if you love the pastor you come on Sunday night if you love God you come on Wednesday night [Applause] [Music] oh but brother it's a drive for me all gave some Sunday morning ain't much of a sacrifice to come to church but Wednesday night is uhhuh but if it was vacation you'd make room in your schedule if it's something you wanted to do somewhere you wanted to go you'd make room in your your schedule but you can't make room for Jes Jesus's house in your schedule oh it's my overtime you ain't taking overtime with you matter of fact if you take take take it away from God to make more money money is your god not God well I got a raise I got I got a promotion and I can't get off you tell your boss God comes first well he might fire me then God's got a better job for you you stand for Jesus and Jesus to stand for [Applause] you I don't know who this is for I'm just following the leadership of the Holy Ghost this is my notes I don't make notes brother L I preached for brother Luke Gibson years ago I had a 3x5 index card on the table he he said what God's name is that I said that's my not had you he said you've lost your mind then he then he handed me his notes and it was a stack of papers about 15 pages High I said my God man what do you do read it line by line he he said almost he said you can take my notes and preach my sermon I said here preach Mine He's like I ain't got that much faith brother so every now and then I I'll take a shot in my office I'll take a shot of my you know my notes for the service upcoming and I'll send it to him I said now go preach this tonight see everybody's got their own different gift Works a different way I work by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost wherever he wants me to go that's where I go this man this man preaching this morning got all kind of Limbs on the tree that's where he told me to go yeah can you imagine being in a church service for just one time and Pastor get up and say look this morning we're not taking up an offering be because everybody's giving just way too much money that's essentially what Moses said he the Bible said he restrained them from giving I wish to God that God had that idea about me he's given too much but most of the time he looks at us and say they ain't giv enough but if it's something you like something you enjoy some kind of hobby something you do you put your heart and soul into it and then you're proud of your work you're proud of what you done where's Jesus at in the whole process where have you put Gody do you really love him with all your your heart all your soul all your mind all your strength is he first seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then he'll add all these things to you it's not that God wants you to be poor I don't believe that I got because I've got scriptures and sermons on Prosperity the right way Pro Prosperity is in the Bible you read what you s that's Pro prosperity and he that reap he that Seth bountifully reapeth bountifully he that Seth sparingly reapeth I can't you know but but Thomas I I don't know why these people drive these nice cars and I have a clunker and I have a you know not a nice house I don't have nothing well let let me see what you're giving away let me let me see the willingness of your heart to give till it hurts see the concept you have to understand here in jesus' parable about it wasn't a parable a real happening but he made it into a parable The Widow's might it wasn't about how much she gave it was what she had left see these other men could put a lot of money in because they had a lot left over but when she put hers in she had nothing left over same principle applies when Elijah went down to zerath First Kings 17 and ask the Widow for I drink of water and they're in a Fame and they're in a drought right this man caused Leisa a Ahab blamed me for go get me a drink of water as she's going he said now bring me a cake while you're at it she turns and says I only have enough for one more and me and my son are going to eat it and die so what was God required a willing heart to give her last meal and ain't so much what she gave what did she have left over nothing so then she had to completely depend on God for her needs because he prophesied you put me first God first and the meal will not run out the cruise will not run dry come on somebody until the famine was over she never ran out of meal she never ran out of oil because she she gave everything she had I want to be found faithful in giving everything when I leave service this morning I'm going to be drain dry of every ounce of energy I got and say I gave it to God I gave it to the ministry I give it to the people I held nothing back two weeks ago I was doing a prayer line at brother Donnie's and before the prayer line was over we had pray probably 300 plus people they had to take me to the hospital in an ER in a in a excuse me in ambulance to the ER because of a a a condition the doctor say I have I was coming in and out they was doing chest compression they could couldn't find my pulse three times and I put everything I had when what I didn't know know these people's needs but I laid my hands on them and I pray prayed with everything that I had I was dripping wet with sweat Brother JD witson brother Donnie's head Deon come to me say brother and you okay I said give me a few more minutes I want to pray for a few more people about five minutes later brother J come back he said brother Daniel come on he didn't ask me he said come on cuz he'd been watching me I was fixing to pass out so he grabbed me as soon as he grabbed me my legs gave away and I nearly fell on the floor another brother grabbed me under this arm They Carried me brother Donnie's uh office and ministering oxygen to me because I gave every I ain't bragging on me I'm been telling you what happened because my nature is when I do something I put everything into it when I was in high school and played play ball I put 110% in in every sport I played that's why I stayed hurt all the time see people don't that don't get hurt in sports ain't doing nothing I'm dealing with things now at 53 that happened when I was in high school because I put forth so not just cuz I wanted to win I wanted to give my best I wanted to give everything that I had thank you Lord and some sometimes we feel like that's not inadequate in whose eyes who you trying to please don't do things in front of people so you can be seen giving something don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing do it in secret go to brother brother with an envelope say give this so so but don't let let them know where it come from cuzz see Jesus said that's what the Pharisees do just to make a show I used to have listen uh like I said almost the quarter Century I've been a pastor and I and we'd go out to e eat after service and certain ones just certain ones they would hand me their tithe check at the dinner table in front of 15 20 people and I'm like this is not the place to do that this is not the place for you to show off you're giving the your tithe to the pastor there's a time and place for all things that was only do it for a show cuz everybody that seen him doing it wanted to know how much the check was for you don't do you don't do things for the kingdom of God for popularity you don't do it for money when I first started evangelizing 1997 I was uh 1998 excuse me uh March of 1998 I was 2 almost 28 I had SE several ministers I had a lot of confidence in come to me and give me some advice and counsel and uh about the ministry and one of in particular he's gone on to be the Lord now he come to me he told me straight up he said brother Daniel a real true man of God a real true called man of God his ministry his ministry is not about his name and lights it's not not about him preaching every Revival it's not about Stardust it's not about money it's not about Italian suits it's not about alligator shoes it's about servitude where has that gone in religion today no we got celebrities in the pull pit now right I told you listen this about you know he might not not invite me back but he told me to obey the Lord there only celebr only celebrity I know is Jesus Christ period I've had people from overseas you know people from overseas they just you they think Americans are just you know wonderful people and every white person is Rich that's just how they think so I've had I've been to different meetings and brothers coming to me and want their picture taking with me well that makes me feel really bad I don't like doing that I've actually gave my autograph before I don't like doing that because I'm nobody now I gave my autograph for playing the bass not for singing just to let you know I never given My Autograph except Sig in a check while I pre for my preaching I was traveling with brother Terry and sister Vicky playing the bass for him back back in the mid90s and this this young person was going around getting all the singers and M musicians uh in in Notebook get their autograph so she come to me and I give it to her and I thought I was somebody I'm giving my autograph wo I'll be on TV next I'm on TV every week now it's called the internet and so I've had Brothers to come to our church from the Congo from East Africa from all kinds of different places uh you know around the world being in the states at certain times of year come and visit our church and want their picture taken with with me I it's hard for me to do that because I know as I'm preaching the word of God it's not me it's him working through me I don't want to receive none of his glory it all goes to him anything that I have ever done in my my life that's good he done it through me I take no credit for anything I've ever done in my Ministry oh brother Daniel I was at a meeting and you prayed for me and God healed you that's right God healed you it had nothing to do with me it wasn't my prayer it was your faith don't give no glory to me cuz you'll get me in trouble with God cuz he don't share it with no man we've raised up God's in the in in the message and they've become Idols of worship and some people won't even go to a certain meeting unless certain preachers is preaching see I took I took I got a word from the Lord back in January of this year and I I won't go into the details but I took six months uh I only preached two or three times uh that month January February all the way all the way through June because I was getting physically so wore down that this brother came to me and God gave him a word to me and I knew it was uh because they just diagnosed me with the S SI he he he was Balling on the phone he brother Daniel I don't know how tell you this I'm just going to tell you how it happened and after he told me I said brother I take that that's from the Lord so I took kind of uh half sabatical only preached half of the services each month from January to June trying to take a break and let me tell you something friend that it it's over now I'm full back full time again but during those six months I didn't get an ounce of rest I took it off I wasn't going to preach as much kind kind of take a break you know even Jesus did that remember he said let let's go away to get get a little rest brother brand went hunting to get take some rest well I felt like after 24 years I needed a little break cuz if you ain't careful as a pastor you burn out and then the people take the pastor for granted and the pastor takes the people for granted so let it let it go every now and then that's right let him have a break every now and then but you don't get a break from coming to church I'm going to take a break for six months from coming to church you'll be in the hail ho out there somewhere drink drinking booze but I was so I had gotten to a place to I had studied so much and been in in the word so much that you'll get burned out and then preach to the people and seems like they get worse they don't really but that's what the devil's telling you they ain't listening to you they doing what they want to do and I know some people do but if I can get a group of people brother Tom that's all Sheep No goats Among Us oh brother Daniel but brother Ram said there's three types of Believers in every church that's right but he didn't say had to stay that way because the Bible said the sheeps and the goats were together but he sent his angels to divide them I believe there's coming today that that in true message churches the shepherd will only be preaching to sheep you see I've dealt with people over the years about giving I'm get back back on money for a few minutes and just for a few minutes so take the Deep breather see God and when Abraham went down with 318 of him his soldiers went down rescued lot remember the story when lot got taken by the by the five Kings of ker laom word came to Abraham that his nephew and the family had been taken so he he armed his 318 men went down there slaughtered the king got lot and spoiled the enemy got all the spoils got you know all their stuff and on his way back home he met MDC right Genesis 14 go read it and the Bible says he gave MDC tithes of all listen to me carefully this was not his income from work this was an in increase he got this stuff from the enemy people think they only have to pay Ties on what their work gives them a paycheck no any increase if you find a $20 bill laying on the ground you better pay $2 on it the Bible says he gave a tenth of all see many people have wondered for years why aen got in so much trouble with God why aen and his family his wife his children his oxes his asses his camels every animal he had anything connected with aen was burned in the valley of aor which means the valley of trouble anything anybody connected with achen was burnt to death why why such a severe punishment because Jericho was God's tithing the first city they come from come to was Jericho oh I just blew somebody's mind go read it Joshua the first city they come to was Jericho when you get any increase the first 10% belongs to God that's right so aen essentially stole tithing from God that's why the severe punishment he didn't steal from man he stole the tithing from God because it was the first fruits of Canaan Malachi 3 says will a man rob God that's right I wonder how many people are sitting in message churches aren't being taught right about money about giving about off off and about tithing it's our responsibility as the ministers to teach you right because this is God's money you're not giving your tithe to brother Tom and it's none of your business what he spends it on CU you know he ain't boozing around with women and going he he he don't do that kind of stuff I got 100% confidence in this man come on your pastor I got 100% confidence in this man that he's living right am so when you pay off the top the first thing when get your paycheck you get birthday money you get anniversary money whatever the increase the first 10% belongs it ain't even yours it never was yours well I gave my ties to God no you didn't you gave God back his ties amen it never belonged to you in the first place and God set it up personally that way why brother Daniel because when Abraham paid tithes to MDC the Bible said Levi while yet in the Lo of Abraham paid ties while he was in seed form in his great-grandfather so God attributed the the Levites to receive tithes did you did you know when when Israel got into canaan's land the tribe of Levi did not get any inheritance not one piece of dirt was theirs but all other 11 tribes paid 10% to the tribe of Levi and that's how they lived and if everybody pays their ties right it'd be a whole lot better he' be a whole lot better better off God set it up that way so I'm a in school I was an idiot I I didn't study for anything I mean I got by like job said by the skin of my teeth I graduated by the skin of my you don't think that's in the Bible job says it by skin of your teeth I didn't say I just wanted to make a f+ D+ rather and just make it through and get out of that hell hole I hate a school and then call cused me to be a preacher and I got to St study up almost every day of my life that's what Paul told Timothy study to show th s approved oh man you mean I got a study I I thought I got out of that no so I studied um statistics again about super mega what they call mega churches in America and most of you uh even in this part of Kentucky you've probably heard of Joel ol I call him Blinky if you've ever watched him over 30 seconds you know why I call him Blinky do you know how much on one Sunday one he's got over 20 thou 25,000 members on one Sunday they take up over th this is an average now sometimes more sometimes less but average one Sunday not the month of the whole month one Sunday their average offering is $600,000 on one Sunday you want to keep the lights on you want to get the nice air flowing while it's 110 degrees outside but you're expecting somebody else to pay the bill oh this is all I got uhuh that's when God blesses at the most some of you remember a man named Henry green brother Henry Green from Ruth Ruth North North Carolina okay brother Henry green was the most giving man I've ever met my my life and I learned a principle from this man about giving the law that God set up god Set this law up Galatians 5 so it whatsoever a man SWS that's what he's going to reap and this man was very blessed so people would call him wealthy I got no problem with that but how he attained his wealth was because he knew how to sow he knew how to give and this was his saying this was his uh you know whatever you call you know uh slogan when I find my resources dwindling dwindling down I look around me to see what I can give away some of y'all didn't hear that when I find my my resources start to dwindle down I look around to find something I can give away if you ever understand the true law of sewing and reaping not out of guilt not out a have to but a willing heart God loves a cheerful do you know that's the nature of God is to give for God so loved the world that he that's the nature of God God's not a taker God is a giver when you go into a relationship with God he he's not worried about what he can get out of you he he want he wants to give you salvation he wants to give you the Holy Ghost he wants to give you blessings he wants to give you Deliverance that's the nature of God he don't take he gives I didn't marry my wife for what I could get oh now he's getting on marriage every Tuesday night 7:30 stand in line counseling sessions in my office if two people get married that are takers it'll never work you have to have a level of your nature and your character that is a give her cuz there going to come a day y'all going to have an intense moments of fellowship and you're going to have to

go shopping for her we go to the clearance [Laughter] rack help me help me Jesus help me help me Jesus help me through this service so I [Laughter] live see understand this when you go into I don't know why I'm going this way he's telling me to so I'm following his lead leadership you go into a marriage with with the attitude of what I can get out of it you go into a marriage what can I put into it to make this marriage better it ain't always the woman's fa well bless God she ain't under subjection well let me talk to you for 30 minutes nine times out of 10 when I had marriage counseling the man always blames the woman for not being in subjection nine time almost 10 times out of 10 she can't find her place or she won't find her place then I swivel my chair over to him and I catch eyes with him then I catch his spirit and I ask him have you found your place because she can't find hers until you find yours so don't blame her on not finding her place if you ain't ain't found hers she's the a a a type of the body you're a type of the head and if the head's on backwards the body is going to walk backwards and there's been many a married couple left my office with the man mad at me he's no longer mad at her because I put him in his place you deal with the head first then work your way down if he's in his place and she's got a problem then we'll deal with that but I if I can ever get the head in his right place I'll never have to talk to the wife cuz she'll she'll find her place by your example but you got to lead right in order for her to follow right listen you don't go into her marriage 50/50 because listen what's the other 50 going to each of you's got to give 100% for it to work right marriage is work and you in order for it to work correctly biblically you can't just give some you got to give all you took a vow until death do his part I will go after no other somewhere along the line we started taking one another for granted somewhere along the line we started taking church for granted somewhere along the line we T started taking our pastor for granted and you human nature is you only miss something when it's gone you don't appreciate it while it's here you ought to appreciate that man right there if he's telling you the pure unadulterated truth I don't care if he steps on your toes every service you you got to thank God for a God called man that will teach you the principles of the Bible get you ready for a Rapture and a body change I've seen people so disrespectful to their Pastor so disrespect I'm thanking my God this is a representative of Jesus Christ brother brother Ram said these words when he comes out of the office he is the Angel Messenger to that church how would you treat an angel if you met one treat him the same way he's bringing you word of God from the throne the mind of God and it ain't easy get in the mind of God sometimes we have to study and study and pray and meditate and fast and study and pray and and the skies are breath we don't know what to preach nothing's coming then Wednesday night comes and we come to our off office we still ain't got nothing we're saying God time's running out I have I know brother Tom has to I have walked out that door not knowing what I was going to preach and God quickened a scripture to to me that's it scripture you mean you didn't read a quote no I don't have to read read a quote every purpose if you think a man of God has to read a quote every service you are a cult the Bible is still our absolute we ain't Catholics well let me hurry oh they took the clock down bless you no there's a little one there 54 54 year eyes can't hardly see that one y'all did that on purpose didn't you get him one he can't read let me move on this is this is a very powerful quote and now wind it down 1963 uh at Christmas time uh 12:22 of 63 brother R preaches a sermon God's gifts always find their places he said I say that that to us today the things that we bring to him identifies what our thought is about him I'm goingon to read it again some of you is snoozing a little bit the things that we bring to him I identifies what our thoughts is about him so we've already had the song service right we've already had the time to worship God that identified you in his presence whether you worshiped or whether you didn't that tells him what you think of him that's good your gift he was talking about the wise men gold frankincense of myrr identified his livelihood what what he come on Earth to do deity and service to die their gift identified what they thought about him what is our gift telling him that we identify as a true worshipper oh uh brother Daniel I I'm I'm a real quiet person I'm I'm you know I'm backwards then then they get out on the parking lot they're the loudest one gossiping okay so you're telling me that when you get to heaven around the throne you're going to be meek and quiet and humble and say thank you Jesus they GNA be calling me Flash Gordon because I'm going be running around D with that King David Joe Crab wrote a song when it's my time I'm going to take my time when it's my time to kneel At His Feet I'm going to take my time I ain't in no hurry why do when we come to church everything has to be on a schedule so many minutes for song so many minutes for prayer requests so many minutes for the sermon so many minutes for the doxology and if we get out on time we'll be beat the Baptist to the restaurant why do we why do why do we put God in a box and say the song service only last so many specials so many uh uh congregational songs don't get a long-winded brother up there to pray he's going to pray for the governor and the the mayor and the president and well brother Ram said that but because what what we've done over the years if a man preaches over an hour all all of a sudden he gets a reputation he's long- winded how many times have you watched a movie or anything that was over an hour and you never got up to go potty it's amazing how our bladders know where we're at and what we're doing and it only bothers Us in church when you leave here this morning the question's going to be ringing in your ears what did I give him as a gift this morning it tells him who I am I'm identified by my gift do I do I want to give him my all or I want to keep somebody I want do like a can to dig in the earth and put some back cuz that's where the Babylonian garment was and the wedge of gold and piece of silver was in the earth he hid it in the earth he thought nobody knew about it I'm going to hold on to this I'm just going to do this in secrecy go off somewhere nobody knows about it you can't go anywhere where God sent I can't see you you're always being watched by God you ain't hiding nothing from nobody so why even try go ahead and surrender there's something pulling you to surrender go ahead and raise your hand I surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I give everything to you everything I own everything I'm renting everything the bank own that I live in it's yours I give it to you I give you my mind my thoughts my actions my words all belongs to you I I don't want to be in control of nothing because I make a mess out of my life every time this is powerful friend as I Clos this down he said the things we bring to him when you came to church what did you expect to get here when you got here just another normal Sunday morning service going through the rituals traditions of men going through the motions you know exactly what Brother D David's going to do s sing this many songs you going pray call Brother B out going to have Sunday school all the things in order and it becomes a ritual a tradition of the elders so so you can go ahead and make reservations at the buffet because you know about how long the service is supposed to last what about when God gets involved and the Holy Ghost Falls you ain't going to look at your watch then things we bring to him Iden ifies what our thought is about him he said you understand what I mean if you believe with all your heart every word of that you'll identify it by giving all that you have to it you remember I Clos and you remember when the Queen of Sheba went to meet Solomon go read this go go read the passage of scripture and I did the math I I don't remember the exact number but as well into the millions of dollar dollar that she gave to solom as a gift as an offering she had heard so many things about this wise man so she wanted to see for herself and she brought gifts to to identify what she expected to see when she got there she didn't go there empty-handed you don't come to church just to see what you can get from God what can you give to him your worship means everything to him because if we don't worship him he's not God God is an object of worship and if we don't worship him he he's not God we got so many things in leosia Rich and increase with good have need of nothing we we've got something for everything we've got resources we can pull from God's nowhere what what if we was in a third world country and needed a loan and needed you know food needed this where you going to go there's no resources then then people have to have faith in America we we don't really need Faith because we got so many resources to pull from people are making millions off of YouTube kids making millions off Instagram this generation Z don't even know x z whatever it is they don't know uh about dirt under their fingernails callous hands the only calluses they have is on their thumbs from texting huh but let me take up for the Youth for for just a second it ain't the youth's fault it's parent delinquency time to grab the Hickory again my Bible tells me if you beat him with a rod he won't die oh but brother Daniel we're we're more civilized than that really the man this man right here is a product of a belt the only time out my dad knew about was while he was whipping me he took a breather he took time out and then start am mening whipping me again I wasn't crying loud enough cuz you know if you have if you have an advanced notice on your whipping you go put seven pairs of underwear on well somehow dad has a little bit or mom has a little bit of discernment and they go a little lower and on the back side of your hamstring oh Jesus oh God how it hurts a little bit higher mom a little bit higher then they get down to the calves cuz you're moving around then jumping around jump from bed to bed hanging from Chandelier jumping from bench to bench trying to get right from that bed D Daddy just stand there in the middle I got I I I got to come back to him eventually he just wait on me son you it's getting more licked the more you act stupid more licks you going to get come over here bend over the bed and take it like a man I ain't a man I know that's why I'm whipping you cuz this generation knows no consequence for the things they're doing they get off with everything parents don't correct them police don't give them a ticket the the government lets them out of jail there's no consequence so if you think there's no consequence go ahead and do it but the generation I grew up in there was consequences for wrongdoing for sinful living and you prayed they wouldn't find out cuz you you knew the consequences my daddy told me because back then in the 80s if you uh they they still paddled kids at school yeah see he was raised the same way I was my daddy looked at me said boy you get one home soon as you get home you get another one and amen it yeah and the reason that I I never went out in the world never been drunk never been stoned never been out in the world with wild women bars and all that kind of stuff CU Mom and Daddy corrected me I KN knew there was consequences to wrongdoing the reason this generation has gone wild nuts free tearing down stat stes destroying Parks destroying monuments and all kinds of what what kind of people do this they're out of their mind it's because of parent even brother Bram said about those kids of 42 children that the she Bears killed that Elisha called out was be because they heard their parents talking about Elisha calling calling him that old Baldhead where are these young people getting these ideas from where they get eight years old all of a sudden boy says I want to be a girl my dad would have knocked me from one end of the trailer to the other boy you was born a boy and you're going to die a boy and if you say it again you might die today I brought you into this world bless God I can take you out of this world but the people the parents today are endorsing it asking the kids they're born a certain gender ask you you you want want to remain a boy do you want to remain a girl we'll pay for the surgery what kind of morons what kind of insanity that all all of us are rubbing shoulders with if if if ever there was a time we need to be closer to God than ever it's right now [Applause] 20 years ago You' never you'd NE never made me believe we'd be facing the things we're facing right now never in a million years what I have believed because I'm going to tell you friend when when my mom was pregnant with me in I was born in 1970 and back back then they was under a Pentecostal Pastor that didn't believe in doctors and Medicine stuff like that so I was born at home with a midwife so my mom didn't have all the prenatal stuff and all the stuff that women have today and so when I was born into this world um my mom B birthed my older brother and myself at home so she she didn't have the you know child care and stuff like that uh that people have today and so and I came into this world and I was raised you know from birth all my life from the time I was birthed till right now I've been in church never one time in my life have I left church you know what I'm saying for a season like some people do just leave church and go out in the world I've never went out in the world done things the world I've done things that were wrong I'm not perfect you get you get my drift people sitting in pews still seeing you know make mistakes I never claimed to be a perfect man but I claim the blood but there come a time in my life I've seen my mama's uh relationship with the Lord I've seen my daddy's relationship with the Lord I had true examples in my home of what Christians really were my mom would come and me their bedroom was on one end of the trailer me and Jonathan's bedroom was on the other friend up up until I was about 15 16 years old my mother would come and cross her legs Indian style and sit in the floor between Jonathan and my room and sit in the floor and pray all night long I would wake up in the middle of the night hearing my mother praying in tongues and now we see most Christians day a according to statistics the only prayers they have during the week is over their food preachers are resigning left and right because of a preacher's life can be a very lonely life everybody looks up to the preacher but it's sometimes could be a very lonely life you can be at the top be the head be the one that calls the shots it ain't all that's cracked up to be because with that position brings great responsibility see not only do pastors have to give an account for their home they give an account for yours too everybody that sits under that man he gives an account for the entire flock to be the door to the flock to represent Jesus John chapter 10 the great door read represent Jeremiah 23 God said I will send you pastors according to my heart and the responsibility that goes along with that's what's wrong with to with today's generation they don't want responsibility they want to make the baby but they don't want to take care of the baby see they'll give some but not all it's easy for all to give some if we took an offering right now probably most of you you would get something there might be one here this morning that you need to give all spiritually you just G him a piece of your heart a piece of your heart see doors and door 1961 brother brother said if he's not Lord of all he's not Lord at all you got to open every door surrender everything to him I was telling brother Joe this story and I'll end with this back in 2012 12 after I broke my back and recovered through rehab I was preaching a meeting a youth camp and don't don't everybody don't get nervous some of you probably hear something like this for the first time but don't get nerves okay uh God still got everything under control we had altar with slap full from one side of the building to the other I don't know how many kids I prayed for and I was done I was spent not a dry place on me when I walked my shoes were squishing from sweat I'm went back to the back of the pool uh platform to sit down sit down for a minute while uh some of the other ministers were ministering to the young people and all of a sudden this demon manifested itself in this 15y old girl and she started talking in deep voice like a man and I knew what I knew what it was cuz I had had not not been directly uh connected with that but I'd seen it done two times in my life and you know Mom didn't W raise no fool I I ain't the sharpest knife in the drawer but I'm in the drawer y'all feel me I ain't the sharpest knife but I ain't no idiot either you don't do something unless God tells you to do it when you dealing with demons like that you better know God sent you you go to you know go to other countries or witch doctors and sorcery and all that Stu kind of stuff goes on you you better know beyond the shadow of that God God's with you you get yourself in a mess of trouble so I wouldn't go down there then my other brothers were praying with her I wouldn't go down there and that and I was a speaker that night I'd already preached so I went back and uh to the back of the platform and I just stood there and watching them pray for cuz I would going to go go down there unless God told me to and all of a sudden I'll Stand Before the Throne of God telling you the honest truth I felt two hands on my shoulder blades push me and I looked behind me I thought who who who's pushing me not a soul behind me I said okay Lord I'll go I walked down them steps the girl's eyes were rolled back in her head you can see the white of her eyes only she spit at me she tried to bite me it was all I could do I was 5' 10 and a half weigh 180 200 lbs going to the gym three times a week this this this is before all my surgeries and fairely stout young man back then is all I could do to hold that girl's skinny little arms remember what brother brand said about demon-possessed people they have the strength of 10 men is all I could do to hold her hand she was trying to hit me and choke me and spit at I just barely missed her spit spit right by me trying to bite me so I knew it you know I've been preaching for 10 years uh no 12 13 years at the time pastoring 12 so I looked at her I was trying to get her attention because I knew the demon had possessed her it it it had taken over her like the Holy Ghost takes over Believers the devil ain't got the Monopoly on possessing people she was doing what the devil in her was making her do it was the demon that I was talking to I was dealing with not her so I looked I I asked some somebody around me I said what's her name tell me her name so they tell me what it was I don't remember uh what her her name was but any I called her by her name and she was wrestling and she was fighting and she was struggling and when I called her name she stopped and her eyes came back down and she looked at me and I call as I called her name she said yes I said do you want to be delivered and she said in her voice she said in in a female voice she said yes right behind that that demon said no this is what I did cuz see the anointing is not emotions direct quote the anointing is not emotions it's supreme power in control and I knew God had sent me down there so I was not alone so when I said do you want to be delivered she said yes that demon said no I said you shut up I ain't talking to you God bear record one day it's on it's on his record that's exactly what I told that de devil you shut up I ain't talking to you I said sis do you want remember a willing offering a willing heart you have to want it for him to give it to you he's not going to force it on you the second time in in her natural voice female voice she said yes and then again the devil said no I said I thought I told you to shut up I'm not talking to you I'm talking to her and she said she wants to be delivered so guess what devil you've got to go and I had remembered when Jesus met Legion on the shores of gadera after crossing the sea with the storm you know the story Jesus didn't have a prayer meeting he didn't have time to fast all he said was come out and I remember that so I told that demon I said come out in Jesus name come out in Jesus name and something inspired me and I got back on the platform about this High and a brother was singing I said could I say something just for a second he said sure brother Daniel so I said I told the the group of young people in the audience I I I said on the count of three we gonna say the name of Jesus five times every one of us say Jesus five times one two three Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and the whole time we're we're calling out that name that devil is going absolutely nuts no no don't call that name no don't call that name so I went back down there after that and I got that demon to look look through her eyes at me some some me I ain't going to believe this I really don't care and I said all right big boy who do you see in front of you and in a man's deep grup voice this demon said Jesus I said who do you see before you he said Jesus I said that's exactly right I am his representation so I have the authority to cast you out boom demon leaves her I told you that to to make this point she had been dabbling on the inter internet on things she shouldn't have been dabbling with entertaining things she said shouldn't been entertained and so she was given her all into this lifestyle by doing that that opened a door for that demon to enter into her because she was given her all to it but when she declared I want deliver that that opened another door well Glory I wanted her to declare I want Deliverance the devil was done after that if Jesus knows from your heart you want to be delivered there ain't enough devils in hell that can keep you bound friend I prayed for drug addicts I prayed for alcoholics I prayed for people off the streets I know what they deal with I've seen them I I I've worked with them I pray prayed with them it's a pitiful sight and it's a horrible de demon that I despise CU I want to say I want to see this same person turn their life around by the Holy Ghost and put as much energy into the word of God as they do into the drugs that's right if you're going to give everything to the devil why you can't you give everything to God when you was out in the world you gave everything to the devil whatever he told you to do you done it wherever he told you to go if you had the money you went what about the word of God I don't want to just give some I want to give my [Applause] all things we bring to him identifies our thoughts about him when you come to church bring your bring your worship with you bring your praise with you and listen do it from your heart not just because other people are raising their hands it it it don't matter if you do the only one raising your hands you a't here for nobody else but Jesus this is y'all's time of visitation your day of visitation take full advantage of it because he said but two or more would Gather in my name I personal Pera will be there in their midst so while he's here because we know he can't lie get what you need while he's here don't leave without getting what you need because he's here to give you what you need but see some people have to be pushed all the way to desperation because they're so bound remember I some of you still pulling so I can't quit yet remember when the maniac in Portland Oregon come on the platform with brother Rand had done broke a preacher's jaw escaped out of mental institution come up there right Toe to Toe with brother BR a place where he could have got his Deliverance come on that's right brother random could have just spoke Deliverance as a Vindicated prophet and if that man had a wanted Deliverance that demon had to leave but he didn't take advantage of the opportunity he called him a snake in the grass and taught him you bring up the wrong tree which is a lion Hound do and brother randam said you'll fall over my my feet the remember the police police was coming down to get him he said no no no this ain't physical this is not flesh and blood this is a spiritual warfare stay where you're at cuz he knew where he was at and if that man would have opened up his heart to Jesus right there at the feet of brother brandham he was have been delivered even with brother brandham saying you go listen to it even with brother brandham saying Satan come out of the man he said it friend I've been in this message a long time I heard a lot of tapes I know what he said he said Satan come out of the man but Satan didn't come out of the man why that man worshiped that devil so he didn't have to obey brother B's voice because the man he was in didn't want him out but if you want Deliverance this morning it's here if you want it if you want freedom this morning it's here if you want it let's stand y'all excuse me I have to stay hydrated every head bowed every eye closed every head bowed I don't hardly ever do this if you're here this morning oh Jesus oh Jesus if you're here this morning maybe you've been coming to this church a while or message churches for a while or maybe you're straight out of the world it makes no diff difference of your past where you come from who you are what your name is what your bloodline is makes no difference all Jesus is looking for is a person that will give their all not just some all can give some but only a few can give all if you're here this morning and have to be honest with yourself you know yourself better than anybody you can say in your heart I've never fully surrendered my life to Jesus but today is my day and I want to fully surrender every in my life go God bless that hand God bless that hand oh my Jesus Oh my Jesus hands oh Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus have your way Lord have your way Lord Heavenly Father I was up at 4 something this morning couldn't sleep try to find your mind and your will for the service which direction go easier than others to get I'm preach it sometimes we have to wrestle and wrestle all through the night Lord I tossed and I turned and got up and laid back down got up I couldn't rest so I just begin to meditate on you in the service this morning God what do you want me to say I don't want to offend nobody I want to be too crude too rude I but I want to tell them the truth it's my duty to tell them the truth it not whitewash it not compromise they need the truth because only the truth can make them free and now I know after the E somehow I found I found your will for this service and it wasn't what I was going to preach Friday night when brother Tom asked me I thought of another S I would just go this way you know when last night you was trying your best to change me and you did I thought Lord preach that in another I don't long or in but I want to tell the TR truth as you give me the truth and you every hand that was raised in your presence no doubt God I believe from Honest Hearts they didn't raise them to me I didn't see every hand but you did and more importantly you seen the heart behind the hand and father there's one thing I know about you that if people would just come as they are you'll receive them when the covered in mud and manure and all kinds of fings but far off he ran and embraced him he didn't care he was covered in piger and mud and everything else he Embrace him maybe there's that that one this morning that's coming home maybe there's half a dozen I don't know God you you're the one that looks at the heart but I know you spoke to people this morning by the effect
