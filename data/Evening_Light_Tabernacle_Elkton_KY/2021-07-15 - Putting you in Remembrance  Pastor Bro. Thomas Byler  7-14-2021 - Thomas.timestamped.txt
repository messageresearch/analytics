[50:36] on sealing our driveway amen
[50:40] okay so i uh been wanting to go in a
[50:44] certain
[50:44] direction with us with a thought and i
[50:47] begin to go down that way and
[50:49] and it kind of veered off so we'll just
[50:51] see which way the lord wants to go is
[50:52] that all right amen
[50:54] uh sometime i wanted to do a recap or a
[50:58] review i mean preach on a review on a
[51:01] lot of the things that we've ministered
[51:03] on the last several years and
[51:05] take some of those subjects and ask
[51:06] questions about it and
[51:08] just kind of look at it again and and
[51:10] kind of have a quiz
[51:12] on it you know it's what i wanted to do
[51:14] and maybe just have a review
[51:16] kind of to see what we've learned you
[51:18] know right
[51:19] amen because you know if you don't
[51:21] remember what you learned you probably
[51:23] doesn't do you much good amen but anyway
[51:26] um kind of went in a different direction
[51:29] so we'll just see what the lord will
[51:30] have
[51:31] tonight but amen let's just bow our
[51:33] heads and go before the lord in prayer
[51:35] lord jesus we come before you father
[51:37] once again thank the lord jesus to be
[51:39] assembled with your children
[51:41] the blood thought of your calvary and
[51:44] the price that you have paid lord
[51:46] to be able to speak to them lord jesus
[51:48] we know that that's a real
[51:50] honor and a real things of reverence
[51:52] lord and respect father we really
[51:54] appreciate it

[52:00] he really does need a touch from you
[52:02] lord and lord the same with brother
[52:04] shawn father we ask god that you touch
[52:06] him lord in a special way father
[52:08] knowing god they're not feeling well the
[52:10] lord they just need your healing gordon
[52:12] may they claim your healing may they
[52:13] just believe that they buy your stripes
[52:15] they are healed
[52:16] and begin to claim it and go forward
[52:18] with that lord
[52:20] for we know that it's all by faith
[52:22] father lord tonight we just ask god that
[52:24] you come and speak to us along the way
[52:26] lord that our hearts might burn within
[52:27] us as you speak to us lord
[52:29] we want to ask god that you just use me
[52:31] father for your honor for your glory
[52:32] lord tonight again
[52:34] minister twist the word of life that we
[52:36] might go here go from here a better
[52:37] people than what we've come
[52:39] we ask these blessings in jesus name
[52:42] amen
[52:42] and amen turn your bibles if you will to
[52:46] second peter
[52:49] ii peter
[52:56] amen like i said again my mind has been
[52:59] towards doing kind of a review think
[53:02] about it and
[53:03] reviewed of course we all understand
[53:05] what that means that's just to look at
[53:06] it again
[53:07] to look at it again
[53:11] and so this is the scripture that came
[53:14] to me when i began to think about that
[53:17] ii peter 1.
[53:20] now there's there's peter's
[53:26] what do we want to call his take so to
[53:29] speak
[53:30] on on review and remembering
[53:34] and then there's paul's that i want to
[53:35] take tonight with the help of the lord
[53:37] that's found
[53:37] in first corinthians i think is the 10th
[53:40] chapter
[53:41] and we'll get to that in a minute but
[53:42] let's read here first
[53:45] second peter 1 and verse 5.
[53:48] and besides this giving all diligence
[53:51] add to your faith
[53:52] virtue and to virtue knowledge
[53:57] excuse me and to knowledge
[54:00] temperance and to temperance patience
[54:03] and to patience godliness and to
[54:06] godliness
[54:07] brother kindness and to brotherly
[54:09] kindness
[54:11] charity for if these things be in you
[54:13] and abound they make you that ye shall
[54:15] be neither
[54:16] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[54:19] of our lord jesus christ
[54:21] but he that lacketh thee things
[54:24] is blind and cannot see afar off
[54:27] and have forgotten that he was purged
[54:30] from his old sins
[54:32] wherefore the rather brethren give
[54:34] diligence to make your callings
[54:36] an election sure for if you do these
[54:39] things you shall never fall
[54:41] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[54:44] unto you abundantly in the everlasting
[54:46] kingdom
[54:47] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[54:50] wherefore i will
[54:52] not be negligent to put you always
[54:55] in remembrance of these things
[54:58] though ye know them and be established
[55:02] in the present truth
[55:04] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[55:06] this tabernacle to stir you up by
[55:09] putting you in remembrance
[55:12] amen knowing that shortly i must put off
[55:16] this my tabernacle even as our lord
[55:19] jesus christ has showed me
[55:21] over i will endeavor that ye may be able
[55:24] after my deceased to have
[55:26] these things always in
[55:29] remembrance amen may god had his
[55:32] blessings to the reading of the words
[55:33] you can
[55:34] be seated
[55:38] so my first question to you tonight is
[55:42] it says that he that lacketh thee
[55:45] things in his blood and he's blind and
[55:47] cannot see afar off so
[55:50] we see that a person that doesn't have
[55:52] the things
[55:53] in that right that they don't they don't
[55:56] have these
[55:57] what is the purpose what what caused
[56:00] them
[56:01] to not have it amen
[56:05] what happened that he doesn't have these
[56:08] things
[56:09] well it says he that lacketh thee things
[56:12] can't seem
[56:13] far off and hath what
[56:17] forgotten that right
[56:20] he has forgotten that he was purged from
[56:24] his old sin so this is not
[56:26] just somebody that's a sinner right
[56:30] this is somebody that once was cleaned
[56:33] up
[56:34] once knew what it was like to have his
[56:37] sins remitted
[56:39] amen but yet he lacks these things one
[56:42] and
[56:42] first thing i want to want you to
[56:44] understand here is that
[56:46] peter begins to explain and and he wants
[56:49] to
[56:50] uh wants us to basically what we might
[56:53] say that he wants us to grow amen
[56:57] how many knows that our the whole our
[57:00] whole
[57:01] christian walk is a
[57:04] walk of growth
[57:08] amen it's always about growing
[57:12] amen and peter says that we're to add
[57:15] all these things to us and if we
[57:18] don't and if we don't if we lack these
[57:20] things
[57:21] amen then we cannot see a far off we're
[57:25] blind
[57:25] and we have forgotten that we have been
[57:28] purged
[57:29] from our old sins
[57:32] so now peter is very concerned about
[57:35] this because
[57:36] i think if we would ask and brother
[57:38] david was mentioning it
[57:40] that especially it seems like the older
[57:43] that we get the more forgetful
[57:44] we've become amen
[57:48] for example today i had all my things
[57:51] all wrote down
[57:52] right had all these things wrote down
[57:54] and when i got to church
[57:56] i realized i forgot my notes
[58:01] and i don't know about you but uh today
[58:03] i was mowing the lawn you know i was
[58:05] doing the lawn taking a little break and
[58:07] you know and and and boy i tell you that
[58:09] thoughts just begin to come and i
[58:11] middle of my lawnmower i stopped the
[58:13] engine and i said if i don't go wrote
[58:14] this down i'll never remember
[58:16] so i'll stop that more i'll run to the
[58:18] house and and get a tablet and i'll
[58:20] write all that stuff down you know and
[58:22] and then i'll give me a tablet and the
[58:24] ink pen and stick it in my pocket you
[58:25] know and go out there and
[58:27] and whenever the lord just begins to
[58:28] pour it out all right that's thumps down
[58:30] well
[58:31] it doesn't help you much if you don't
[58:32] bring your tablet right
[58:34] but we're just very i don't know about
[58:36] you but we're very forgetful prone and i
[58:38] i'm more so i guess i probably uh
[58:42] i don't want to diss myself too much
[58:44] here but i am forgetful above
[58:48] average
[58:50] we got another one think that you know
[58:52] it's just above average i mean it may be
[58:54] average to be forgetful but
[58:56] i just tell you what sometimes i think
[58:58] that i'm just above average forgetful
[59:01] it's terrible i don't like it amen but
[59:04] anyway and no doubt that peter knew
[59:07] that we're forgetful he knew that
[59:11] humanity is forgetful the first
[59:13] church they were forgetful
[59:16] amen and so boy peter really expounds on
[59:19] it he says you know
[59:21] i'm not going to be let neglec negligent
[59:25] he says to put you always in remembrance
[59:28] of these things though ye know them and
[59:31] be
[59:32] established in the even though you know
[59:34] it
[59:35] i'm still gonna remind you again
[59:39] i like that that's peter's type of
[59:41] preaching isn't it
[59:43] now i know y'all know this but we need
[59:45] to go over it again
[59:47] why because we have a tendency to forget
[59:51] i have another question for you tonight
[59:52] you ready
[59:54] all right what are the two best schools
[1:00:01] raise your hand sister hannah you might
[1:00:04] have had it
[1:00:12] hard
[1:00:15] yeah that's what i'm looking for the
[1:00:18] school of hard knocks we've all heard it
[1:00:19] at school right
[1:00:21] it is a great school
[1:00:24] because you know we can preach it all
[1:00:26] day hello but you don't really learn it
[1:00:28] just from preaching
[1:00:29] you know you have to and i call the
[1:00:32] other one
[1:00:33] the other school is the school of
[1:00:34] experience
[1:00:36] right you know the school of experience
[1:00:39] because hey when you get
[1:00:41] you know and be really when you think
[1:00:43] about it
[1:00:44] the way that we learn the best is not
[1:00:46] from a lot of times the things that we
[1:00:48] succeed in
[1:00:49] but in our mistakes in our
[1:00:52] failures you know right sometimes
[1:00:56] our failures are our best teacher
[1:01:02] all right how many knows and this just
[1:01:04] came tomorrow comes to mind
[1:01:05] um was it james thomas
[1:01:09] edison is he the one who created light
[1:01:11] bulb
[1:01:12] thomas says right i mean i'm told that
[1:01:16] he would try a thousand different things
[1:01:18] and thousands of different things he
[1:01:20] tried
[1:01:21] to make it work now i don't know about
[1:01:23] you but that's a whole lot of failures
[1:01:26] right but it taught what did he teach
[1:01:28] him he taught him that
[1:01:29] this isn't right this isn't gonna work
[1:01:31] all right let's go on to something
[1:01:33] else and that's the way it is in my life
[1:01:35] that's why it is your life
[1:01:37] when you fail at something you realize
[1:01:39] hey that's not gonna work
[1:01:42] all right let's try something different
[1:01:44] now because that didn't work
[1:01:47] insanity is to do the same thing
[1:01:50] expecting different results
[1:01:53] when i think about this subject
[1:01:56] let me just say something else while i'm
[1:01:58] at it and that is
[1:02:00] another question for you
[1:02:04] what happens to those who don't learn
[1:02:07] from history or the past
[1:02:12] you know we've gotten a bunch of sounds
[1:02:14] here y'all a lot of them
[1:02:15] you're bound to say make the same
[1:02:18] mistake
[1:02:20] isn't that right and that's the way it
[1:02:22] is in your life that's the way it is in
[1:02:24] my life if we don't look
[1:02:26] from our mistakes if we don't remember
[1:02:29] am i right and that's why we do
[1:02:31] sometimes we we do things over and over
[1:02:33] again is because we don't remember hey
[1:02:35] last time it didn't work
[1:02:38] huh and then we do it again and then we
[1:02:41] do it again
[1:02:42] how many knows that was the church ages
[1:02:44] the church ages brother bam talked about
[1:02:46] how that
[1:02:47] you know every time did every revival
[1:02:50] oh the people got free they get them
[1:02:52] we're getting out of their old dead
[1:02:55] churches and all that get the fire going
[1:02:57] in their hearts again and boy they were
[1:02:59] just happy and free
[1:03:01] but it wasn't no time until they were
[1:03:03] like a dog
[1:03:04] turned to its vomit according to james
[1:03:07] we human beings we're
[1:03:08] we can be like a dog that turns to his
[1:03:10] vomit
[1:03:12] all right and and go back to doing the
[1:03:16] same thing again
[1:03:18] amen so how many beliefs it's important
[1:03:21] to remember
[1:03:23] and then a lot of times you need to look
[1:03:24] back amen now
[1:03:26] we don't preach on looking back a lot
[1:03:28] because we believe in looking forward
[1:03:31] but there's certain things and certain
[1:03:32] things that you need to remember
[1:03:34] things that you need to look back on
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:38] and do you need to bring back into
[1:03:41] your mind amen
[1:03:45] you know because the fact of the matter
[1:03:47] is um
[1:03:49] if if you lose your joy there's a reason
[1:03:52] why you lost your joy
[1:03:54] and you need to remember what is that
[1:03:57] you lost your joy
[1:04:00] because if you don't remember what it
[1:04:02] was you'll never be able to find it
[1:04:03] again
[1:04:06] oh my let me just reach a little little
[1:04:09] thing that buddha bam said about
[1:04:10] captain uh that was machine gunned and
[1:04:13] and he was dying his lungs were filling
[1:04:16] up and the chaplain he said to this man
[1:04:18] that was gunned down he says captain
[1:04:20] do you know god he said i once knew him
[1:04:23] and this is i didn't have much time to
[1:04:25] look this up but he says well
[1:04:26] when did you know him he said uh i can't
[1:04:29] think
[1:04:30] said where'd you leave him he said
[1:04:32] you'll have to go back to where he left
[1:04:34] him to find him
[1:04:36] and remember in another place brother
[1:04:37] bam said he was done he said i can't
[1:04:39] remember
[1:04:40] and this this this preacher was really
[1:04:42] mean and he was really hard on him
[1:04:46] he said yeah you better remember
[1:04:49] hurry up hurry up he said remember
[1:04:51] you're dying you only got a few more
[1:04:53] minutes
[1:04:53] and you're going to pass out he was just
[1:04:56] really hard on him
[1:04:57] you better remember hurry up remember
[1:04:59] well i don't know about you but that'd
[1:05:00] be hard to do
[1:05:01] i'd make my own motherboard nervous if i
[1:05:03] would die and he told me hurry up
[1:05:08] he pressed him he pressed this man you
[1:05:10] need to remember
[1:05:11] where you left him you need to think
[1:05:13] about back
[1:05:14] about where you left him at
[1:05:20] hallelujah come on folks how many notes
[1:05:24] oh my that's what that's for every one
[1:05:26] of us
[1:05:27] out there too if you remember well there
[1:05:30] was a time when you just had the peace
[1:05:32] of god
[1:05:33] and the joy of god and the love of god
[1:05:36] in your heart and boy it was just the
[1:05:38] greatest feeling in the world but today
[1:05:40] you're all mucked down
[1:05:42] huh you're not as happy as you used to
[1:05:45] be you're not what you used to be
[1:05:47] tonight you better remember
[1:05:50] the only way you'll ever get back to
[1:05:52] that place is to go back
[1:05:54] down memory lane and try to remember
[1:05:57] where you left him at
[1:06:00] otherwise you'll go on in your mind and
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] got to go back remember where you left
[1:06:07] him that's what he was telling him
[1:06:09] he says your lungs are filling up sir
[1:06:11] you better think
[1:06:13] uh quiet and fast
[1:06:17] so he laid there a little bit and said
[1:06:18] and the great peace come over his face
[1:06:20] and he says i remember
[1:06:22] i remember where i left him and he said
[1:06:25] what
[1:06:25] was it at he says start right there and
[1:06:28] he says
[1:06:29] now i lay me down to sleep i pray the
[1:06:32] lord my soul to keep
[1:06:34] if i should die before i wake i pray the
[1:06:37] lord
[1:06:38] my soul to take he drawed his last
[1:06:40] breath
[1:06:41] as the gurgles of blood filled up his
[1:06:44] lungs
[1:06:45] and he died what did he do he found
[1:06:48] jesus right
[1:06:49] where he left him amen that's where the
[1:06:52] church will find him
[1:06:54] amen it's where you left him think back
[1:06:59] how many remembers there in uh
[1:07:01] revelations there and we're talking
[1:07:02] about the ephesus church the first
[1:07:04] church age he says
[1:07:05] you've lost your first love remember now
[1:07:09] where you fell from and go
[1:07:12] back and do the first verse
[1:07:17] huh go back remember
[1:07:22] amen i like that that's what peter was
[1:07:25] trying to tell them i want you to
[1:07:26] remember
[1:07:27] after i'm dead and gone i want to do
[1:07:30] something here
[1:07:32] he says knowing uh and i think it meet
[1:07:35] as long as i am in this tabernacle to
[1:07:38] stir you up
[1:07:39] by remembrance and that's my title
[1:07:41] tonight stir you up
[1:07:43] by remembrance
[1:07:48] praise the lord
[1:07:51] your mind how many knows your mind and
[1:07:53] your memory is
[1:07:56] it's quite a thing it'll either bless
[1:07:59] you
[1:08:01] bring joy to your heart
[1:08:04] or it'll bring condemnation and sorrow
[1:08:06] and
[1:08:08] despair is that right
[1:08:13] you know we've got several different
[1:08:14] young people starting up in church here
[1:08:17] i got to thinking about what i wanted to
[1:08:18] tell them
[1:08:20] and it really goes for all of us no
[1:08:22] matter what age you are
[1:08:24] it's a good time to start try not to
[1:08:27] make any mistakes
[1:08:30] don't do things especially that you know
[1:08:32] that's not right and do it anyhow
[1:08:34] because you'll regret it and you'll have
[1:08:37] a lot of regrets
[1:08:38] and the more you do it the more regrets
[1:08:41] you're going to have to have
[1:08:42] have as you get older
[1:08:45] hello and regrets are a horrible thing
[1:08:48] to live with
[1:08:51] amen because even though god is very
[1:08:54] forgetful
[1:08:56] god is forgetful i'm glad he's forgetful
[1:09:00] whenever your sins go into the blood of
[1:09:01] jesus christ he forgets
[1:09:04] but you don't the devil will try to
[1:09:07] bring those memories and those things
[1:09:08] and those failures back into your mind
[1:09:10] till the day that you draw your last
[1:09:12] breath
[1:09:14] if you can't he'll make you miserable
[1:09:16] with it
[1:09:17] i wish i had that quote brother by him
[1:09:19] said think right do right act right and
[1:09:21] you'll turn out right
[1:09:23] but if you do any of the others it ain't
[1:09:24] going to turn out right
[1:09:26] amen how many wants to remember that
[1:09:29] lord help us to remember
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:34] praise the lord so he says now notice
[1:09:38] knowing that i must shortly put off this
[1:09:40] tabernacle
[1:09:41] he knew he was going to go away here
[1:09:43] because the lord had showed him
[1:09:45] that moreover i will endeavor that ye
[1:09:49] may be able
[1:09:50] after my deceased to have these things
[1:09:52] always
[1:09:54] in remembrance praise me to god
[1:09:58] whatsoever things are good whatsoever
[1:10:01] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:10:02] a good report
[1:10:04] amen if there be any praise if there be
[1:10:06] any virtue
[1:10:07] think on the things
[1:10:14] amen praise be to god
[1:10:22] because why
[1:10:25] tell me what you think about all day
[1:10:28] what do you think about all the time
[1:10:31] where's your mind at all the time
[1:10:34] and i'll tell you who you are
[1:10:37] because the bible says as a man thinks
[1:10:39] in his heart
[1:10:41] so is he folks you can hide a lot of
[1:10:45] things
[1:10:46] but do thoughts is what you really are
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:53] my and i'm glad aren't you glad
[1:10:58] that we can remember go back and
[1:10:59] remember what god has done for you
[1:11:06] what god has done you remember the rock
[1:11:09] that you eschew from remember where he
[1:11:13] was
[1:11:15] amen now peter
[1:11:18] peter here when he goes to tell him what
[1:11:20] to remember he talks about this
[1:11:22] then he also talks about how that you
[1:11:24] know how that he was there when he heard
[1:11:26] that voice saying this is my beloved son
[1:11:28] in whom i am well pleased and we have
[1:11:31] not
[1:11:31] we have not followed cunningly devised
[1:11:34] fables
[1:11:36] we were there we saw he talked about his
[1:11:39] experience
[1:11:40] never forget that what you're following
[1:11:42] is not something
[1:11:44] false it's not some cunningly devised
[1:11:46] fable
[1:11:49] amen it's not what people want to say
[1:11:51] about brother bannon ministers that's
[1:11:53] been ministers for 20 years
[1:11:55] 25 years pastor perhaps they want to
[1:11:57] turn their back and say well
[1:11:59] brother branham was a false prophet huh
[1:12:03] say oh you want to we're not following
[1:12:04] some divinely cunningly devised fable
[1:12:07] thou's healings weren't fake that
[1:12:09] discernment wasn't fake
[1:12:11] that was not some cunningly devised
[1:12:13] fable
[1:12:14] when somebody wanted to trick him in the
[1:12:16] audience and congregation remember and
[1:12:18] wrote all that stuff on their
[1:12:19] notes and so forth and prophet says last
[1:12:21] night he was at a certain table
[1:12:23] you and somebody else and he uh yeah
[1:12:24] hello
[1:12:26] huh now we're not following some
[1:12:29] comingly devised
[1:12:30] devised fable but we're following the
[1:12:32] lord jesus christ
[1:12:34] i think it hooves us to remember what
[1:12:37] god has done how many knows that god is
[1:12:39] immemorial he is in
[1:12:40] some remembering things because even
[1:12:43] when the children of israel well there's
[1:12:45] many of them the feast of the passover
[1:12:47] was to be observed
[1:12:48] from generation to generation to
[1:12:50] generation so that people would remember
[1:12:53] what god did at that time when he
[1:12:56] delivered them out of egypt and when the
[1:12:57] firstborn was slain
[1:12:59] and when they had the passover lamb and
[1:13:01] so forth isn't that right
[1:13:02] he wasn't him to remember that this is
[1:13:04] the time that i
[1:13:05] delivered you
[1:13:11] you don't never want them to forget
[1:13:15] but let me tell you something about a
[1:13:16] forgetful people even if god said
[1:13:19] about them as they were forgetful and a
[1:13:21] stubborn
[1:13:23] israel was stubborn and forgetful
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:34] so let's just follow israel for a minute
[1:13:36] let's go ahead and go
[1:13:38] let's turn if you will with me
[1:13:44] this is paul's version of how that we
[1:13:47] need to remember
[1:13:49] to me it is anyway and it's found in
[1:13:52] first corinthians the ninth chapter
[1:13:54] first of all in the verse 24 first
[1:13:56] corinthians 9
[1:13:57] 24 he talks about how to know you not
[1:14:00] that they would run in a race run all
[1:14:02] and so forth and then the last verse but
[1:14:04] i keep under my body
[1:14:06] and bring it into subjection at least by
[1:14:09] any means when i have preached
[1:14:10] with others i myself should be a
[1:14:13] castaway
[1:14:14] now look at where paul goes here where
[1:14:17] does paul go
[1:14:18] when he thinks about wanting to be able
[1:14:20] to finish this race
[1:14:22] is that right that what we're interested
[1:14:24] in he goes to israel
[1:14:27] and he says moreover brethren i would
[1:14:29] not have you to be ignorant how that all
[1:14:32] our fathers were under god how they all
[1:14:35] passed through the sea
[1:14:36] how they were all baptized unto moses in
[1:14:39] the cloud
[1:14:40] and in the sea and they did all eat the
[1:14:43] same spiritual
[1:14:45] meat and they all drank the same
[1:14:47] spiritual drink
[1:14:48] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:14:50] that followed them and that rock was
[1:14:52] christ but with many of them god was not
[1:14:55] well pleased for they were overthrown
[1:14:57] in the wilderness now deep things notice
[1:15:03] now these things were our examples to
[1:15:06] the intent that we should not lust
[1:15:07] after evil things as they also lusted in
[1:15:11] other words he said let's go back in
[1:15:13] mine
[1:15:14] let's remember what israel did and then
[1:15:16] how that even after god delivered them
[1:15:18] out of there
[1:15:19] on the egypt and he brought him right
[1:15:20] over to the red sea
[1:15:22] amen they got down and they got in that
[1:15:24] place of trial and they got into that
[1:15:26] place of past
[1:15:28] and that right they didn't know which
[1:15:29] way to turn
[1:15:33] they were basically going like what do
[1:15:35] we do what do we do what do we do what
[1:15:37] do we do i don't know
[1:15:38] what are we gonna do moses what are you
[1:15:39] gonna do what are you gonna do
[1:15:41] god let him get to that place
[1:15:45] and what did they do they forgot
[1:15:49] they didn't think about it what had just
[1:15:52] happened
[1:15:53] how god had brought them out isn't that
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:57] what god had done and how he had slain
[1:15:59] the first one how he forgot about the
[1:16:01] blood they forgot about the flag
[1:16:03] they forgot how they had shouted and
[1:16:06] sang and oh my
[1:16:09] and that right what a wonderful time
[1:16:11] they had
[1:16:12] and what did they do to begin the murmur
[1:16:18] oh my let me tell you something when we
[1:16:20] forget
[1:16:22] where we come from we begin to murmur
[1:16:26] we forget sometimes we don't think about
[1:16:28] where we were
[1:16:30] we're not content where we're at
[1:16:34] because we don't remember where we were
[1:16:48] folks when i think about where i was
[1:16:52] and now where i am
[1:16:56] you go ahead isn't it much better
[1:17:00] isn't it much better aren't you sitting
[1:17:03] in a much better place tonight than what
[1:17:06] you used to be
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:11] all right stir you up
[1:17:14] stir you up by remembering
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] amen let me just tell you the story
[1:17:26] this is i think about this a lot
[1:17:31] and i use this at different times but
[1:17:33] remember the little beagle i picked up
[1:17:37] because god talks about israel and how
[1:17:39] did i found you in a waste howling
[1:17:41] wilderness wounded and bleeding
[1:17:44] is that right and that way pick her up
[1:17:46] i'll never forget coming back home and
[1:17:48] seeing that little big dog there in that
[1:17:50] swell snow
[1:17:51] covered sitting there skinny
[1:17:55] and i said there's something seriously
[1:17:56] wrong with that though
[1:17:58] to sit there no hope
[1:18:01] going to die
[1:18:02] [Applause]
[1:18:05] and never forget caleb you know
[1:18:08] the reason caleb told me not to pick him
[1:18:10] up because scale is the kind you know if
[1:18:11] you're going to give it 100 and not at
[1:18:13] all because when you get that dog
[1:18:15] he's yours for a lifetime you're
[1:18:17] responsible for him 100
[1:18:19] you know how it is we went back and
[1:18:22] picked him up
[1:18:23] that dog being a strange dog allowed me
[1:18:25] with a broken leg straight sideways to
[1:18:27] pick him up
[1:18:28] and put him in the back of the truck
[1:18:30] with the lid on and so forth put him in
[1:18:32] a comfortable place brought him home
[1:18:33] take him to the doctor take him to the
[1:18:35] bed amen
[1:18:37] vet kind of want to cut his whole hang
[1:18:39] my ham off the whole leg's got to go
[1:18:41] i said i don't want to do that let's
[1:18:43] just fix it up and put it in the splint
[1:18:45] and
[1:18:45] if i have to shoot him later because he
[1:18:47] hobbles along and he has a miserable
[1:18:48] life i'll have to maybe do that
[1:18:50] but let's do that let's just put it in
[1:18:52] his plate and now
[1:18:54] when i think about it that guy is fatter
[1:18:56] than what he should be
[1:19:01] i won't even tell you some of the other
[1:19:02] but i'll tell you what you know
[1:19:05] he let me pick him up didn't bite me or
[1:19:07] whatever you know and
[1:19:09] what i think about that that was me
[1:19:14] amen in the world lost not knowing which
[1:19:17] way to go
[1:19:18] amen fixing to die so to speak no hope
[1:19:22] god came down and picked me up he picked
[1:19:25] us up out of the deep miry clay
[1:19:28] he took us to his hospital and he give
[1:19:31] us joy
[1:19:32] and give us peace he gave us happiness
[1:19:36] he would he tied up our wounds isn't
[1:19:38] that right
[1:19:39] he come to heal the brokenhearted
[1:19:42] oh my
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:49] and that dog was so scared of me that he
[1:19:52] would
[1:19:52] urinate on himself wherever he was every
[1:19:54] time i approached him
[1:19:57] he wasn't used to people he sure didn't
[1:20:00] know what love was
[1:20:02] oh my i pet him and i said i'm gonna
[1:20:04] take care of you and i did all this
[1:20:06] talking to him you know and
[1:20:08] you're my dog now you know i'm gonna
[1:20:10] take care of you
[1:20:11] and isn't this nice this is nice
[1:20:30] i thought that's us sinners isn't that
[1:20:32] right
[1:20:33] isn't this nice isn't it nice to have
[1:20:37] the holy spirit to have peace
[1:20:39] when the world's falling apart and in
[1:20:41] our mind it bothers us because it's
[1:20:43] completely turning sodom and gomorrah
[1:20:47] world is falling apart but here in the
[1:20:49] midst we have hope
[1:20:51] we have peace we are in the nest of
[1:20:54] jesus christ
[1:20:55] safely tucked away
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:03] aren't you getting to where you just
[1:21:04] about don't want to look at the news
[1:21:06] anymore it's too depressing
[1:21:09] i think we'd be better off just keeping
[1:21:10] that out of our mind
[1:21:12] amen when i when i think about the
[1:21:14] reality of how
[1:21:15] sodom and gomorrish's it's getting it's
[1:21:18] like wow this is just past me even
[1:21:20] wanting to know anymore just
[1:21:22] you know my
[1:21:26] but anyway so let's go back to israel
[1:21:30] here
[1:21:30] god brought them out picked them up
[1:21:34] they were mud dabbers made slaves of
[1:21:37] their
[1:21:38] sons and their daughters and did
[1:21:40] whatever they want with them beat them
[1:21:41] anytime they wanted to beat them whoop
[1:21:43] them whatever they wanted to do with it
[1:21:45] they did they were slaves
[1:21:48] and here's the first little thing that
[1:21:50] comes along
[1:21:51] and they forget all about her they're
[1:21:54] right
[1:21:58] amen and i want to say tonight that we
[1:22:00] repeat
[1:22:02] the same things over and over because we
[1:22:03] forget
[1:22:05] we don't think about it a lot of times
[1:22:09] amen we need to think about it we need
[1:22:11] to remember
[1:22:13] and then they come guess what and after
[1:22:15] that you know they god delivered them
[1:22:17] with a mighty hand through the red sea
[1:22:20] and it wasn't very long that he allowed
[1:22:22] him to get a little hungry
[1:22:24] and that right and then they begin to
[1:22:26] murder they forgot already look what god
[1:22:28] did they should have never
[1:22:30] had a complaint they should have
[1:22:32] complete faith in god
[1:22:35] and never he said my god is more than
[1:22:37] able
[1:22:38] they should and in that right isn't that
[1:22:41] what the
[1:22:42] joshua isn't that what caleb did at the
[1:22:44] cadiz barnea when they did it for the
[1:22:46] very last time remember when the spies
[1:22:48] came back and they had to go say
[1:22:50] remember what god did did god bring us
[1:22:52] out he's more than there but he tried to
[1:22:54] give it in their mind because
[1:22:56] us human beings we are so hard at it
[1:23:01] so hardheaded do you realize today that
[1:23:05] we know who pharisees
[1:23:07] is tribes are you know right
[1:23:11] we know who hypocrites are we know who
[1:23:13] they are we know who describes the
[1:23:14] pharisees of this they are
[1:23:17] but described pharisees don't because
[1:23:18] they don't learn from history
[1:23:21] amen it doesn't take it's very vivid
[1:23:25] it's
[1:23:25] very plain there but they don't see it
[1:23:28] and that's
[1:23:30] i guess what peter said if you like
[1:23:32] these things you can't see a far off
[1:23:35] and you have forgotten that you has
[1:23:36] purged from your old sins
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:40] how many believes that if that faith and
[1:23:44] uh virtue and godliness and temperance
[1:23:46] and already things
[1:23:48] if they're not in you then you're not
[1:23:51] growing like you should be
[1:23:56] you're not fruitful like you should be
[1:23:59] in the knowledge of having him and
[1:24:01] claiming to be a christian
[1:24:02] you're not fruitful if those things
[1:24:06] aren't in you because you have come to
[1:24:07] the place that you're supposed to come
[1:24:08] to
[1:24:10] you have forgotten that you was purged
[1:24:13] from
[1:24:13] your old sins
[1:24:16] and even paul says these things are for
[1:24:20] our example that we shouldn't do like
[1:24:22] they did
[1:24:23] neither be idolaters as some of them
[1:24:26] were as it is written
[1:24:28] people rose up sat down to eat and to
[1:24:31] drink and to
[1:24:31] randy rose up to play neither let us
[1:24:33] commit fornication as some of them also
[1:24:35] committed
[1:24:36] and fell in one day three and twenty
[1:24:38] thousand
[1:24:40] neither let us tempt us as some of them
[1:24:42] tempted and were destroyed of serpents
[1:24:43] neither murmury
[1:24:44] some of them also murmured and were
[1:24:46] destroyed of the destroyer
[1:24:49] now all these things happen unto them
[1:24:52] for examples
[1:24:53] and are written for our admonition what
[1:24:56] so that we
[1:24:57] will remember remember what that just
[1:25:01] because you believe in the prophet just
[1:25:03] because you believe in the cloud just
[1:25:04] because you believe all of that
[1:25:06] that's not going to be enough
[1:25:09] just because you claim to be in the
[1:25:11] message that doesn't put the message in
[1:25:13] you
[1:25:14] i just don't want to claim the message i
[1:25:16] want the message to be
[1:25:17] in me
[1:25:23] and not just 20 years ago 30 years ago
[1:25:25] my mother had an experience back then no
[1:25:27] i wanted a fresh experience with god
[1:25:30] today
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:34] every day a fresh experience and i'll
[1:25:36] tell you you get away from prayer
[1:25:38] you get away from that commitment to god
[1:25:41] and you find yourself cold and
[1:25:42] backslidden
[1:25:44] but you need to remember where you left
[1:25:46] off serving god in the amazing that you
[1:25:49] did
[1:25:50] when you had the joy of the lord in your
[1:25:52] heart
[1:25:55] and come back to it
[1:25:59] the reason people never change you can
[1:26:01] come to church go about the same
[1:26:03] am i right because you might hear
[1:26:06] with your ear but you have to apply it
[1:26:10] to your life if you fail to apply it
[1:26:14] next sunday you might be enlightened
[1:26:16] well wasn't that a good service
[1:26:18] but you come back the next sunday or the
[1:26:20] next wednesday the same as you've always
[1:26:23] been
[1:26:26] huh think about it don't change
[1:26:32] now i don't know about you but change is
[1:26:35] hard for me
[1:26:36] change is hard for you
[1:26:41] you can try to change your colors all
[1:26:43] you want to you're just going to shine
[1:26:45] and brighter
[1:26:46] those spots you know but you can do
[1:26:50] something to change and that's pray more
[1:26:54] that's recommit yourself to god
[1:26:56] rededicate yourself
[1:26:59] are you with me now i'm saying that in a
[1:27:01] low voice but it should be
[1:27:02] penetrating our horrors how many's ever
[1:27:04] had to rededicate their self
[1:27:06] oh yeah we gotta rededicate we gotta get
[1:27:09] a refilling of the spirit a lot of times
[1:27:11] because if you don't get a refilling
[1:27:13] hello
[1:27:15] unless you're full you're completely
[1:27:17] full that's wonderful
[1:27:20] it's going to shine all over your face
[1:27:22] it's going to show
[1:27:24] but if you need a refilling it'll also
[1:27:26] show
[1:27:30] amen
[1:27:33] remember where god brought you from
[1:27:36] amen and where you are today
[1:27:40] remind me lord because i'm human i have
[1:27:42] a tendency to forget
[1:27:47] we we had great service at camp well why
[1:27:50] don't you have a great service tonight
[1:27:52] maybe you forgot something
[1:27:56] we come home from a revival we don't
[1:27:58] forgot
[1:28:03] oh i know that preacher was god no he
[1:28:06] wasn't all that good
[1:28:09] no because guess what i have felt like i
[1:28:13] have took
[1:28:14] totally flopped preaching well that was
[1:28:16] a flop of a message
[1:28:19] i really didn't never get off the air
[1:28:21] the ground
[1:28:22] never began to fly huh but somebody will
[1:28:26] come up and say
[1:28:27] brother bob that's the best message i
[1:28:28] ever heard
[1:28:30] that was really good i really enjoyed
[1:28:32] that
[1:28:35] so you see folks half of this about you
[1:28:38] and whether you get into it or not or
[1:28:40] where you're there with it or not or
[1:28:41] where you are at amen how many that's
[1:28:44] the way with our services that's because
[1:28:46] amen and when everybody gets where it's
[1:28:47] supposed to be then you'll have a good
[1:28:48] service
[1:28:50] but we forget how can i bring that
[1:28:54] revival here how can we have healings
[1:28:56] here
[1:28:56] amen if you bring god and you'll bring
[1:28:58] faith there the same thing
[1:29:00] happened remember
[1:29:04] peter said i want to stir you up
[1:29:08] by putting you in remembrance
[1:29:12] oh my how many loves good memories
[1:29:16] precious memories
[1:29:19] how they linger
[1:29:23] how they ever flood my
[1:29:26] soul in the stillness
[1:29:31] of my pillow
[1:29:34] i begin to think of how is god is so
[1:29:38] merciful and so great and so
[1:29:40] awesome and in the midst of the midnight
[1:29:44] my soul is blessed because i remember
[1:29:47] i think about god i think about what he
[1:29:50] has done
[1:29:51] i think about where he brought me from i
[1:29:53] think about all of his miracles
[1:29:57] huh all the times he's picked me up when
[1:30:02] i fell on my face
[1:30:05] all the times i didn't deserve
[1:30:07] forgiveness but he forgave me
[1:30:10] huh oh my
[1:30:15] other people might not even forgive you
[1:30:16] brother glenn they might not forgive you
[1:30:20] but god will forgive you human beings
[1:30:23] aren't as forgiving as god is
[1:30:26] aren't you glad for that i'm glad for a
[1:30:29] god that is full of grace and mercy
[1:30:32] or you wouldn't be performing that pew
[1:30:34] tonight you'd be at a tattoo parlor
[1:30:37] huh who knows where you would be
[1:30:43] praise the lord so he says notice
[1:30:48] so he says these things happen unto them
[1:30:50] as in the 40 samples
[1:30:51] and are written for our admonition upon
[1:30:54] whom
[1:30:55] the end of the world it says worlds
[1:31:00] no it does say world the ends of the
[1:31:02] world
[1:31:04] are come amen
[1:31:08] so we need to remember
[1:31:12] it wasn't just your experience with god
[1:31:14] yesterday that matters
[1:31:18] i mean believe that not just your
[1:31:20] relationship not just the fact that he
[1:31:22] brought you out
[1:31:23] not just the fact that he did what he
[1:31:24] did but what is he doing for you today
[1:31:27] amen what is your experience when god
[1:31:30] brings things here
[1:31:31] into your uh down your path so to speak
[1:31:36] what do you do with that when things
[1:31:39] happen to us
[1:31:41] we'll do two things one of them is
[1:31:45] and this is the normal reaction i will
[1:31:48] call it the first reaction
[1:31:50] our first reaction is to act carnally
[1:31:52] because that's just the way we are
[1:31:56] right the second one
[1:32:00] is to act intelligently
[1:32:03] right or spiritually
[1:32:10] if we how many know how many uh ever
[1:32:13] said the phrase
[1:32:15] on second thought well on second thought
[1:32:19] how many knows we need that a lot of
[1:32:21] times we need that second thought
[1:32:23] because if we say something or we do
[1:32:24] what we feel like or whatever
[1:32:27] folks especially myself we all have a
[1:32:29] tendency to have a foot in our mouth
[1:32:31] don't we
[1:32:33] but sometimes we'll take a second
[1:32:35] thought and we'll say no
[1:32:36] i shouldn't say that huh no that's not
[1:32:40] the right reaction
[1:32:43] because most of the time when we act
[1:32:45] initially a lot of times
[1:32:47] we'll have to apologize a lot of times
[1:32:50] we'll be saying
[1:32:51] i'm sorry right
[1:32:56] but we think about it we remember
[1:32:59] huh get a second thought about it
[1:33:02] get in the right gear then we can act
[1:33:04] correctly
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:09] otherwise we have a lot of stories in
[1:33:11] our life
[1:33:13] we need to remember ah no that's just my
[1:33:15] first nature
[1:33:17] lord you take control of it if that
[1:33:20] israel would run that look
[1:33:21] at where they'd have been at they'd have
[1:33:24] been pleasing
[1:33:25] to god i don't know about you but that's
[1:33:29] my interest i want to be pleasing to him
[1:33:32] i want to be pleasing to him
[1:33:41] all right we got 15 minutes let's pick
[1:33:44] up my original thought a little bit
[1:33:45] i feel like i come to that spot amen
[1:33:51] just a couple questions things that
[1:33:53] we've taught over the years
[1:33:55] that i've taught that we've experienced
[1:33:59] so the one question tonight is you can
[1:34:01] raise your hand if you think you have to
[1:34:02] what are we here for what is this world
[1:34:06] to us what are we here for
[1:34:11] what's it all about
[1:34:16] pleasing the lord all right anybody else
[1:34:19] got something
[1:34:22] how many notices go ahead
[1:34:27] to be a light yes to be a light
[1:34:30] but what i'm looking for is that this
[1:34:32] world and the way god has allowed us to
[1:34:34] be in this fallen condition is for what
[1:34:36] it's approving and it's a testing ground
[1:34:40] i believe this is only a testing ground
[1:34:44] and getting us into what molding us and
[1:34:46] shaping us
[1:34:47] isn't that what a test do that's what
[1:34:49] like boot camp does it gets you ready
[1:34:51] for what's ahead
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:54] oh my sometimes we forget that that's
[1:34:58] all it is
[1:35:00] sometimes we think this is our home this
[1:35:03] is where we live no it is not where we
[1:35:05] live
[1:35:07] it is only a temporary stay
[1:35:11] we're pilgrims and we're strangers
[1:35:14] in this place we're seeking a city where
[1:35:17] there's no
[1:35:18] amounts
[1:35:25] no sinners the sinner had refused to
[1:35:29] heed the call
[1:35:31] and that right it's a place of molding
[1:35:34] us
[1:35:35] and to the image of jesus christ
[1:35:38] question number two what is it some of
[1:35:40] the things that we preached so hard and
[1:35:42] so much on
[1:35:44] and that is about trials
[1:35:48] boy we've sure hamlet that haven't we
[1:35:50] tests and trials i've preached a lot of
[1:35:52] it
[1:35:54] because this church 10 15 years ago
[1:36:00] was not where it was supposed to be
[1:36:03] and god sent us trials
[1:36:06] he allowed tests to come upon us that
[1:36:09] shook us to our very core
[1:36:11] amen isn't that right
[1:36:13] [Applause]
[1:36:15] he saw so to speak beat us
[1:36:19] beat us what is the purpose of beating
[1:36:31] get the dross out of the gold
[1:36:35] we're like beaten gold remember what the
[1:36:37] prophet taught about character
[1:36:38] i already gave you the answer on that
[1:36:41] but god it beats us he allows us to be
[1:36:43] beat i don't know but i don't like
[1:36:45] really like meetings steer rough
[1:36:49] it is tough it is absolutely very
[1:36:52] little fun
[1:36:57] what did the bible say it endureth for a
[1:36:59] season
[1:37:00] it's hard for a season but it produces
[1:37:03] to
[1:37:04] reproduce eternal life
[1:37:08] i'm can i get off my subject just a
[1:37:10] little bit i want to tell you about our
[1:37:11] trip a little bit
[1:37:12] i'm talking to you about a good day
[1:37:16] and a bad day we had a good day we had a
[1:37:18] bad day
[1:37:21] and uh so we took micah's boat borrowed
[1:37:24] micah's boat
[1:37:25] i had to go up the rivers visit my amish
[1:37:27] cousins and so forth saying
[1:37:29] selena over there and and so anyway i
[1:37:32] got everything got my fishing tackle
[1:37:34] everything loaded up and that right
[1:37:38] got all the way to tompkinsville about
[1:37:40] two hours away
[1:37:41] pulled over the gas station to get a
[1:37:43] little something looked over in the boat
[1:37:45] and i realized
[1:37:46] that i had forgotten the vote key
[1:37:53] the vote key i forgot to vote we're
[1:37:55] gonna have a fun time paddling this
[1:37:57] thing
[1:38:00] bad day how my heart set you know you're
[1:38:02] just gonna but no i said no i'm not
[1:38:04] gonna i said my k
[1:38:06] micah call michael you got a secret key
[1:38:09] somewhere though to hit someone in this
[1:38:11] boat
[1:38:12] i know you got to no
[1:38:15] nope you got to come all the way back
[1:38:17] good
[1:38:18] i know i ain't doing that i refuse
[1:38:22] all right let me begin to look up
[1:38:24] marinas and marinas you know i'm gonna
[1:38:26] figure this thing out
[1:38:27] change the ignition i'll do something
[1:38:29] i'll run you 500 bucks
[1:38:31] dad nah
[1:38:35] there was a little old hippie dude there
[1:38:38] in the gas station and i said
[1:38:40] many marinas and so forth and i gave him
[1:38:42] a tip for give telling me about where
[1:38:44] everyone is and
[1:38:45] so we headed towards the mom says i'm
[1:38:46] going i'm 30 minutes from my location
[1:38:48] i'm going to go all the way down
[1:38:50] we're going to go down there and go up
[1:38:52] the other way a half hour i'm going to
[1:38:53] go past
[1:38:54] my place half hour the other way because
[1:38:56] i got confident we can fix this thing
[1:38:59] 500 bucks oh it is going to be expensive
[1:39:01] here
[1:39:03] and so we got down there we got to the
[1:39:05] city where we were going to stay at
[1:39:08] and i seen a gas station with a bunch of
[1:39:10] boats and ski-doos and some
[1:39:11] four-wheelers and just uh
[1:39:13] you know looks like a country hit guy
[1:39:15] that maybe fix this stuff so i went in
[1:39:17] there and i talked to them and
[1:39:18] i said hey you have any idea i told him
[1:39:20] my situation i forgot my key
[1:39:22] you know it's an older boat is there any
[1:39:24] way i can get ignition he says is there
[1:39:26] any marinas around
[1:39:27] he said he said well there's one way up
[1:39:29] there he says but this car quest over
[1:39:31] here might have it
[1:39:32] right this car quest around the corner
[1:39:33] has some boat ignition keys and mica's
[1:39:35] whole panel comes
[1:39:36] loose with six screws you pull it up and
[1:39:38] pull it off and
[1:39:40] and the ignition goes in there and you
[1:39:41] take one cap loose and you pop it off
[1:39:43] and there's about six seven different
[1:39:44] wires in there and that's way too smart
[1:39:46] for me
[1:39:48] hey i was thinking wow i was thinking
[1:39:50] screwdrivers you know
[1:39:52] anyway it ain't gonna work with six
[1:39:54] different wires but anyway
[1:39:56] so we went to car quest and looked at
[1:39:59] some and now that ain't gonna work and
[1:40:00] he says well let's come over here and
[1:40:01] come over here and
[1:40:02] he got me over there to that one and i
[1:40:04] took it apart and i looked at it and i
[1:40:05] said that looks like it let me take it
[1:40:07] out there and look at
[1:40:08] and it matched perfectly that was
[1:40:11] perfect match
[1:40:13] and micah's 500 turned into 27 dollars
[1:40:17] for the chef
[1:40:18] it was a glorious day we had a really
[1:40:20] good day
[1:40:21] that's a good day you know i just had a
[1:40:24] screwdriver and i did it myself just
[1:40:26] copied each one right off the bat and
[1:40:28] boom there we go we're ready to play
[1:40:29] here now right
[1:40:31] it was a good day everything you all
[1:40:33] worked out
[1:40:34] praise the lord kept my composure didn't
[1:40:36] get down too bad
[1:40:38] even though i was what did i call myself
[1:40:40] i don't even want to repeat it probably
[1:40:42] but anybody
[1:40:44] uh incompetent or something you know
[1:40:48] but that's a good day so anyway
[1:40:51] uh but there was another day then
[1:40:54] another day
[1:40:56] we was fishing and we was kind of
[1:40:58] closing the day out and we was going
[1:40:59] down there and
[1:41:00] i was going this big river and i was
[1:41:02] going to really catch some proud yeah
[1:41:03] i'm gonna gotta catch me a fish because
[1:41:05] i ain't caught one all weekend you know
[1:41:07] even though i
[1:41:07] you know don't catch one it's not all
[1:41:09] that bad in the hot summer brother jeff
[1:41:10] knows it's real hard to catch him in the
[1:41:12] summer
[1:41:13] especially totally blind because i had
[1:41:15] no depth finders or any of that
[1:41:17] technical stuff that i probably couldn't
[1:41:18] read
[1:41:20] anyway we was going down there and for
[1:41:21] some reason everything could go wrong
[1:41:23] went wrong
[1:41:24] and i was just throwing them lures on
[1:41:26] and we just
[1:41:27] current current going fast and
[1:41:32] you couldn't really you could stop and
[1:41:33] go back and get your lures but man i got
[1:41:35] snagged
[1:41:36] one after another reject i ripped it's
[1:41:39] loose that i just couldn't get it right
[1:41:41] you know
[1:41:42] and i was just fishing away and so one
[1:41:44] these the one time i
[1:41:46] pulled that lure back out of that thing
[1:41:48] so hard it come flying
[1:41:49] and come and stuck me in the leg i
[1:41:51] immediately went through the pants
[1:41:53] into the skin i couldn't get it out
[1:41:57] i said well i will fix it later
[1:42:00] i cut it i kept no
[1:42:06] bad day right murphy's law not
[1:42:09] everything goes right right
[1:42:11] oh yeah you heard it all again but
[1:42:14] anyway so
[1:42:15] we went on on down and once i got to
[1:42:18] the conclusion that i'm not going to get
[1:42:20] a fish
[1:42:22] and so we've seen the storms moving our
[1:42:24] tarts are
[1:42:25] feel like it's going to rain or whatever
[1:42:27] so it will go and this
[1:42:29] this river is foggy so trust me it was
[1:42:31] dangerous once again we had fall
[1:42:34] not where we were but around the band
[1:42:35] boy we got foggy and we was looking you
[1:42:37] know because
[1:42:38] man you're going pretty good clip and so
[1:42:41] anyway we got back to
[1:42:42] back to
[1:42:46] my wife always sitting beside me my
[1:42:48] little love bird
[1:42:50] anyway she's sitting there beside me you
[1:42:51] know and i had forgotten about this hook
[1:42:53] being in there
[1:42:54] and when i come up to where we was going
[1:42:55] to put the boat in and i was going to
[1:42:57] get up
[1:42:57] i got up like that and moved up and up
[1:43:00] towards the lake
[1:43:04] oh gosh it really hurts
[1:43:10] so we were really together we would
[1:43:13] really
[1:43:13] love birds
[1:43:18] but anyway i thought what what else then
[1:43:21] it started pouring
[1:43:26] pray the lord anyway right all right
[1:43:28] it'll try
[1:43:30] i thought i'm gonna tell the church
[1:43:32] might find a good day it's not a bad day
[1:43:45] ripped it out of mine i guess
[1:43:49] i realized it's just on my pants and oh
[1:43:50] i'm not hooked okay now i just cut that
[1:43:52] thing off and
[1:43:54] that's precious little thing i had to
[1:43:56] take the pliers and get it just right
[1:43:57] and
[1:43:58] quick you know did it quick it wasn't
[1:44:00] too bad we got it all straightened out
[1:44:02] got back in the hotel and everything
[1:44:05] praise the lord anyway
[1:44:07] but you you question i mean those you
[1:44:09] question sometimes you know
[1:44:11] what like i was a sin lord what i do
[1:44:14] whatever i did lord forgive me you know
[1:44:17] i like for things to go good and come
[1:44:19] together
[1:44:20] and so forth but you know and it all we
[1:44:23] just praise the lord
[1:44:24] you know that he watched over us because
[1:44:26] i'll tell you what it could have been
[1:44:28] you know with that fog and everything it
[1:44:30] was dangerous and everything
[1:44:31] you know with that fog and all so i
[1:44:32] thank god for his protection
[1:44:35] amen and how many knows like i think his
[1:44:38] brother brian talked about we have our
[1:44:39] highs we have our mountaintops oh my
[1:44:42] because you know before all of that
[1:44:43] happened when we was going
[1:44:45] me and her was just rejoicing because we
[1:44:47] we do despair at a moment more
[1:44:49] some spare moment going and leaving and
[1:44:51] go on a trip more when we were younger
[1:44:53] but we hadn't done in a long time but
[1:44:54] this kind of showed
[1:44:55] give us an opportunity to just get away
[1:44:57] a little bit and he says let's take it
[1:44:58] let's go ahead and
[1:44:59] just relax a little bit you know and and
[1:45:01] so but we was just singing and laughing
[1:45:04] and having
[1:45:04] fun on the way down until tompkinsville
[1:45:07] and then that happened and it was a
[1:45:08] little bit
[1:45:09] a little bit different until we got the
[1:45:10] ignition and then it was back to cloud
[1:45:12] nine again you know
[1:45:13] but anyway no matter what how many knows
[1:45:15] you just have to trust the lord
[1:45:17] commit your life to god and walk steady
[1:45:20] and don't let things bother you just
[1:45:22] if you possibly can and just always
[1:45:25] react in the way that the holy spirit
[1:45:28] runner wants you to react
[1:45:30] how many tonight would say lord help me
[1:45:33] remember
[1:45:34] the things of god let's remember
[1:45:37] everything that because god has done how
[1:45:39] good he's been good to us
[1:45:41] amen you take brother perish take me a
[1:45:43] lot of times we'll
[1:45:44] re-talk about our experience with god
[1:45:46] isn't that right
[1:45:47] because it means so much to us it
[1:45:49] inspires us to know
[1:45:51] what god has done and how he's sustained
[1:45:53] it's how he's kept it how he's molding
[1:45:55] us and how he's shaping us
[1:45:57] amen because you wouldn't really know
[1:45:59] you really wouldn't know
[1:46:01] what you are unless those hard times
[1:46:04] came
[1:46:05] amen and man is what he is what
[1:46:09] under pressure so god allows those times
[1:46:11] of pressure in our life
[1:46:13] to see how we react see what kind of
[1:46:15] attitude we take
[1:46:17] because ultimately jesus wants to live
[1:46:19] with people that are like him
[1:46:22] and that's what he we here at the church
[1:46:24] are striving for
[1:46:25] is to be in his very image
[1:46:30] allow god to change you
[1:46:33] don't make the same mistakes don't
[1:46:37] not learn from history amen
[1:46:40] because if you don't learn from history
[1:46:42] you're bound to repeat it
[1:46:44] god bless you let's stand tonight
[1:46:48] musicians if you'll come

[1:52:33] felon
[1:52:35] around him and i said one of them said
[1:52:39] if you who you are you'll get us down
[1:52:41] and save yourself and us too and i said
[1:52:44] the other one
[1:52:45] you know i said he said i belong here
[1:52:49] but you don't and i said you know he
[1:52:52] realized what god had
