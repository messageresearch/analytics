[29:23] i feel led to see if we couldn't have a
[29:26] spring get together again
[29:28] i know we hadn't done it for the last
[29:30] couple years but if you all remember you
[29:31] used to have it like a fish fry
[29:33] so
[29:34] i'm hoping me and my wife get to go down
[29:36] to florida maybe here in about three
[29:38] weeks or so and and we'll try to catch
[29:40] as many as we can
[29:42] but we need brother jeff and everybody
[29:44] on board to go get us some fish
[29:46] but anyway anyway we'll get some fish
[29:48] one way the other we got to buy him but
[29:51] would everybody like
[29:52] that everybody wanna have a spring get
[29:55] together
[29:56] all right and i'm and so we're just
[29:58] putting our feelers out
[30:00] to see when everybody can be here
[30:02] because we'd like to have everybody here
[30:03] if at all possible so if you can't clear
[30:06] your schedule or if you
[30:08] you know if you can
[30:09] and that's going to be easter weekend
[30:11] easter weekend that's the 16th of april
[30:14] that's in about six weeks
[30:16] 16th that's easter weekend or
[30:19] the week after if it works out better
[30:20] for the week after we'll do it on the
[30:22] 23rd of april okay so the 16th or the
[30:25] 23rd
[30:26] and
[30:28] what we'll do is we'll post it on our
[30:29] website and i think everybody can

[30:35] 16th or 23rd and then we'll work from go
[30:37] from there would that be all right

[30:42] amen been a long time since we've even
[30:44] had a hardly a fellowship in or anything
[30:47] and i think that by god's grace it looks
[30:49] like the covet is about pretty much gone
[30:55] don't everybody shout at once now
[30:58] that's awesome isn't it just to know
[31:00] that we ain't hearing a bunch of that
[31:01] mess anymore i'm certainly glad i i
[31:03] almost act silly when i go to a public
[31:05] place i want to say
[31:08] nobody wearing masks that's so nice
[31:11] nice
[31:12] you know but i don't want to act as full
[31:13] but i don't know what to do but i'm glad
[31:15] not to see all that stuff i'm glad to be
[31:17] about pastor that you know you know
[31:18] there for a while we didn't know whether
[31:19] it was going to last forever or what's
[31:22] going to go on you know
[31:24] amen but it was i mean it was something
[31:26] real and this last surge i think was
[31:28] about as bad as the first surge you know
[31:30] and so but anyway we're just thankful
[31:33] to be over it some of us gotta know what
[31:36] it's
[31:38] all about in that right

[34:45] get the bear with me they just asked me
[34:47] to do this
[34:49] he asked me to do two or three chapters
[34:51] so i hope you can bear with me
[34:55] uh
[34:56] before i get started though since i'm up
[34:58] here anyway i wanted to share a little
[34:59] testimony i told brother tom i wanted to
[35:02] and
[35:03] you know god just keeps inspiring our
[35:05] faith but one day i got a letter in the
[35:07] mail and i had already been telling
[35:09] tammy that so i just want to believe
[35:11] that you know god he can he can
[35:13] take care of these doctor bills you know
[35:16] and one day i got a letter in the mail i
[35:17] got the letter and opened it and said
[35:19] this is a letter being sent to notify
[35:21] you that your request for financial
[35:23] assistance has been approved and that's
[35:25] all i read i put it up i took a picture
[35:27] of it and sent it to her
[35:29] and she was like does that mean
[35:31] and this is for the icu bills you know i
[35:33] had multiple doc i went to three
[35:36] different hospitals and then i had a
[35:37] life flight homeless bills but this just
[35:39] mainly the icu bills and i kept
[35:41] wondering what they was going to be like
[35:42] when they came in and uh
[35:46] i didn't think much more of it and i was
[35:48] working and stuff and she was like does
[35:49] that mean they're forgiving i'm like i
[35:50] don't know i mean he just says we're
[35:52] approved and this is another miracle
[35:54] about the whole situation because i
[35:55] haven't even had got my taxes back yet
[35:58] so i haven't even applied for any help
[36:01] and uh then the next morning i'm sitting
[36:03] there getting coffee
[36:05] and the letter was laying right there
[36:06] and i'm sitting there getting my coffee
[36:08] and it says
[36:09] it has
[36:10] i read the rest of the letter i didn't
[36:12] even read all the letter that day and it
[36:13] says we have applied the charity as a
[36:16] write-off to this account and it is now
[36:18] closed
[36:20] and that's
[36:22] [Music]
[36:23] [Applause]
[36:26] god is still raising our faith up and
[36:28] get us ready to get out of here
[36:31] but hebrews 11
[36:33] 1 through 10.
[36:55] now faith is the substance of the things
[36:58] hoped for the evidence of things not
[37:00] seen
[37:05] through faith we understand that the
[37:07] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[37:10] the things we which are seen are not
[37:12] made of the things which do appear
[37:30] by faith enoch was translated that he
[37:32] should not see death and was not found
[37:34] because god had translated him for
[37:37] before his translation he had the
[37:39] testimony that he pleased god
[37:53] by faith noah being warned of god the
[37:55] things not seen as yet
[37:57] moved with fear prepared an ark to save
[38:00] to the saving of his house by the which
[38:03] he condemned the world and became heir
[38:05] of righteousness with which
[38:08] is by faith
[38:22] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[38:24] promise and as in a strange country
[38:26] dwelling in the tabernacles with isaac
[38:29] and jacob the heirs with them
[38:31] him of the same promise
[38:34] for we look for a city which have
[38:37] foundation whose builder and maker is
[38:39] god
[38:55] you know after reading something like
[38:57] that what do you have to worry
[38:58] about i mean i know don't get me wrong
[39:01] this world we live in wants to work make
[39:03] you worry about things
[39:05] but what do you really have to worry
[39:07] about
[39:08] if god is in you
[39:10] then you're he's going to take care of
[39:12] it doesn't mean you won't have pain
[39:14] doesn't mean you won't have suffering
[39:16] just means that he's there with you
[39:18] through it
[39:19] um
[39:21] kyla
[39:22] wrote something down last week before
[39:26] i started but
[39:29] you know i was thinking in the world
[39:30] that we're living
[39:33] if you want to turn with me to second
[39:35] timothy the third chapter
[39:38] but i wrote this down
[39:41] one of the scriptures we
[39:42] read last week
[39:44] when jesus was teaching the disciples
[39:46] and and
[39:48] and all the children of israel at that
[39:50] time
[39:51] he gave a prophecy on what would happen
[39:53] to jerusalem and then when you when he
[39:56] told his disciples when you see the
[39:58] enemies surround it
[39:59] uh flee and don't even look back because
[40:02] of what's going to happen and you know
[40:04] and i was thinking
[40:06] those
[40:07] disciples and those
[40:09] people in that day they knew to leave
[40:11] the city when the romans were starting
[40:14] to encircle the city that day so they
[40:16] had a
[40:18] knowledge so they wouldn't be there on
[40:20] that day when that suffering happened
[40:23] and sometimes
[40:24] god is warning us
[40:26] not to be in certain places so we don't
[40:28] go through the judgments that other
[40:30] people go to but do we always listen i'm
[40:33] thinking and i was also thinking this
[40:35] morning
[40:36] uh i was
[40:38] jumping over here this has nothing to do
[40:41] i was just sitting there this morning
[40:44] and as everyone sees what's going on in
[40:47] the world this morning
[40:49] or the last couple of months but i was
[40:51] thinking there's never been a time like
[40:53] this
[40:56] and we we see what's going on in in
[40:59] ukraine and was but what i was thinking
[41:02] about is
[41:04] everyone thought that the mark of the
[41:06] beast or the you know where they could
[41:09] actually keep you from buying and
[41:12] selling it you know we've heard that for
[41:14] hundreds of years for the last 30 or 40
[41:16] years but you can see it being applied
[41:19] to a whole nation right now to that
[41:21] russian nation right now where they're
[41:23] making it almost impossible for them to
[41:26] buy or sell because they have a they
[41:28] don't agree with what they're doing i'm
[41:30] not taking the side here but and then
[41:33] you can see it on our own country and
[41:34] you can see an encounter if you if
[41:36] you're one of those canadian truck
[41:38] drivers they've actually destroyed your
[41:40] livelihood they've put them in jail
[41:43] they've taken their rights away and does
[41:45] anyone do you hear anything about it
[41:47] they completely took a class of people
[41:50] and took all their rights away where you
[41:52] know you don't hear much about it and
[41:54] even in our own country i'm i'm not like
[41:56] i said i'm not taking side left or right
[41:59] but those people that were there on
[42:01] january 6 they're still people sitting
[42:03] in jail this morning that have been in
[42:05] jail for over a year for some minor
[42:08] offenses now they don't think they were
[42:10] minor but they're still sitting in jail
[42:12] over a year without trial so
[42:16] what i'm trying to say who would ever
[42:18] thought that we'd live in a in a time
[42:20] where things like this could happen they
[42:22] could just
[42:23] in a second
[42:24] take away your bank accounts take away
[42:26] everything that you've worked your whole
[42:28] life for and you just seeing their
[42:29] ability they if they can do it to a
[42:32] whole nation just imagine what they
[42:34] could do to our country or any other
[42:36] country if they took it
[42:38] decided that they were gonna make an
[42:40] example of you
[42:42] and i was also thinking
[42:44] you know we believe things that
[42:47] to the people even our own country we
[42:49] believe things that are
[42:51] that they can't accept if you believe
[42:53] that homosexuality is wrong
[42:56] there's places that you would have a
[42:57] hard time getting a job if you believe
[42:59] that homosexuality is wrong certain
[43:02] behavior is wrong you'd have a heart
[43:04] you'd either have to be totally quiet or
[43:06] you wouldn't you wouldn't do well in
[43:08] certain places that and even in our own
[43:11] country this morning but i was uh just
[43:13] going to read this
[43:15] this uh i was just thinking i'll read
[43:16] this 13th chapter of revelations but
[43:20] what i was also thinking there's been no
[43:22] other time in the time of man where you
[43:25] can see everything that's going on in
[43:28] the world whether everyone has got it
[43:30] here this morning either got a tablet
[43:32] that you're reading the bible offer or
[43:34] you're reading it off your phone that
[43:35] very same instrument allows you to see
[43:38] what's going on so when you read these
[43:40] scriptures and paul in the days of john
[43:43] or paul you know you people for the last
[43:46] thousand years were trying to say how
[43:48] could everyone know what's going on
[43:50] across the total face of the earth well
[43:52] you have that ability this morning that
[43:54] you can see what's happening in ukraine
[43:56] you can see what's happening in china
[43:58] you can see what's happening in south
[44:00] africa you can see the whole world in a
[44:02] little digital device that everyone
[44:04] carries with them nowadays but i'll just
[44:06] read what this says here in this 13th
[44:09] chapter
[44:10] and i stood upon the sands of the sea
[44:12] and i saw our beast rise up out of the
[44:14] sea having seven heads and ten horns
[44:17] and upon his horns ten crowns and upon
[44:19] us that's the name of blasphemy and the
[44:22] beast which i saw was like a leopard and
[44:24] his feet were
[44:25] just the feet of a bear in his mouth as
[44:27] the mouth of the lion and the dragon
[44:30] gave him his power and his seed and his
[44:31] great authority and you all know the
[44:33] message
[44:34] i'm not having a separate thought here
[44:36] but what i'm saying is
[44:39] you have an ability now to see this
[44:41] happen all across the world with your
[44:43] digital devices you know in paul's day
[44:45] all they knew
[44:47] the news was in their general area now
[44:49] you know the news all the way around the
[44:51] world and i saw one of his heads as if
[44:54] it was wounded to death and his deadly
[44:57] wound was healed and all the world
[44:58] wandered after the beast and that's
[45:00] where i'm going
[45:02] the whole world wandered after the beast
[45:04] and the world's the same way with the
[45:06] the ability that we have right now you
[45:09] can wonder after the things that are
[45:11] happening in the world it should give
[45:13] you solace to know if you're in christ
[45:15] then you have something greater
[45:18] for yourself and the world has
[45:20] and as they worship the dragon they gave
[45:23] power on the beast they worshiped the
[45:24] beast saying who was like on to the
[45:26] beast and who was able to make war with
[45:29] him
[45:29] you know and
[45:31] financially that's worse than people
[45:33] shooting at you if they take your
[45:35] financial ability away from you they
[45:38] take your ability for commerce to
[45:40] exchange goods for services they take
[45:42] that away from you what are you you're
[45:45] going to be either going to have to live
[45:46] out in the woods providing for yourself
[45:48] or you won't be able to provide for
[45:50] yourself and it goes on to say
[45:53] and there was given unto him my mouth
[45:54] speaking great things and blasphemed me
[45:56] some power was given on to him to can
[45:59] you continue 40 in two months and he
[46:01] opened his mouth and blessed me against
[46:04] god a blasphemous name and his
[46:06] tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[46:08] and you see
[46:09] i'm i'm not encouraging it but you can
[46:11] see this on your tablets and on your
[46:12] phones every day where people blaspheme
[46:15] the word of god and blaspheme the things
[46:17] that we hold dear to ourselves and it
[46:19] goes on
[46:20] and it was given on to him to make war
[46:22] with the saints and to overcome them and
[46:24] the power was given unto them
[46:27] over all kindreds and tongues and
[46:28] nations and all that dwell upon the
[46:31] earth shall worship him whose names were
[46:33] not written in the book of life of the
[46:35] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[46:37] world and if any man here let him hear
[46:41] it goes he leadeth into captivity he
[46:43] should go into the p he that killeth
[46:45] with the sword must be killed with the
[46:46] sword he that is patient and faith of
[46:49] the saints
[46:50] excuse me i didn't read be killed
[46:52] here is the patience and the faith of
[46:54] the saints and behold another beast came
[46:57] out of the earth and he had two horns
[46:59] like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon but
[47:01] my point being i'm not going to read
[47:03] this whole chapter is i was just
[47:05] thinking of the last couple of months
[47:08] what we see going on in the world
[47:10] whoever thought there would come a time
[47:11] in the world where they
[47:13] could isolate a whole country like
[47:16] they've done over the situation in the
[47:18] last month have
[47:19] almost made it impossible for that
[47:21] country to to thrive as a country well
[47:25] you're
[47:26] one individual is far worse than a
[47:28] country if they can do that to a country
[47:30] imagine what they can do that to an
[47:32] individual or to a group of people so
[47:35] the only hope we have is in christ so i
[47:37] was gonna jump over here to timothy the
[47:39] third chapter
[47:41] this morning i'm not
[47:43] wanting to take a lot of time i know i
[47:44] have some pet peeves i say all the time
[47:46] i don't mean to be a repetitive um
[47:50] i'll just i'll just i want to read i'm
[47:52] not going to read the beginning because
[47:54] it kind of deals with what i read out of
[47:55] revelations
[47:57] but paul starts at about the ninth ninth
[48:00] first year in the second
[48:02] timothy the third chapter
[48:04] but they shall proceed no further for
[48:06] their following shall be manifest onto
[48:08] all all men as theirs also was
[48:12] and he's talking to timothy here and
[48:14] he's saying but that was fully
[48:16] you know my doctrine manner of life
[48:18] purpose faith long-suffering charity and
[48:21] patience paul's basically telling
[48:23] timothy
[48:24] just like brother branham told us and
[48:27] you know to look on to paul as we look
[48:29] on to brother brown as an example and he
[48:32] goes on persecutions afflictions were
[48:34] came on to me
[48:36] and antonaki and forgive my
[48:37] pronunciation like them and listeria
[48:40] what persecutions i endured but of all
[48:43] them all the lord delivered me yea and
[48:45] all that
[48:46] will live godly in christ jesus shall
[48:48] suffer persecution are we any better
[48:51] that's the thought that comes to my mind
[48:53] we're no better than paul or anyone else
[48:55] but the but evil men and seducers shall
[48:58] act worse and worse deceiving and being
[49:00] deceit but continue down the things
[49:03] which thou has learned and has been
[49:05] [Music]
[49:07] assured knowing of whom thou has learned
[49:09] them and that from a child that was
[49:11] known the holy scriptures and whether
[49:14] you're a 60 year old man that's come to
[49:17] christ or you're a 15
[49:19] year old boy or girl that's come to
[49:21] christ you can you have to apply these
[49:23] scriptures
[49:24] for that was known the scriptures which
[49:26] were able to make thee wise unto
[49:28] salvation through faith which is in
[49:30] jesus christ all scripture is given by
[49:32] inspiration of god
[49:34] and is profitable for doctrine for
[49:36] reproof
[49:38] for correction for instruction and
[49:40] righteousness that the man of god may be
[49:43] perfect and thoroughly furnished onto
[49:45] all good works so this right here in the
[49:47] message of the hour you you have what
[49:49] you need you have what you need to be
[49:52] strengthened every day so you can fight
[49:54] the battle of faith that we deal with
[49:56] and uh
[49:57] you know there there might come a time
[49:59] where you're forced whether to accept
[50:01] their doctrinal i'm not going to call it
[50:02] doctrinal but to hold the
[50:05] job you
[50:06] out there in the world that might come
[50:08] to a point
[50:09] where you might have to confess things
[50:11] that you know that you can't confess or
[50:13] hold that job or to keep your bank
[50:15] account so you've got to be ready for
[50:17] that day i you know i'm i'm not that old
[50:20] i'm
[50:21] early 60s i never thought i'd see a day
[50:23] where the stuff that's going on in our
[50:25] own country i know i'd say this a lot
[50:27] but i can't you can't be surprised
[50:29] anymore you don't know what tomorrow is
[50:31] going to bring but we do have a hope and
[50:33] that hope is in christ itself that if
[50:35] your hope is in that there's nothing
[50:37] that's going on it can be
[50:40] uh
[50:41] it can be not let it dismay you when you
[50:43] look at it you say this is crazy why
[50:45] they keep doing this it keeps getting
[50:48] worse or worse well we don't have any
[50:50] promises for it to get better but we do
[50:52] have a promise to get out of here that's
[50:55] the only promise we have that really

[1:04:09] for god's grace and mercy and
[1:04:16] you know we
[1:04:17] we serve an awesome god this morning
[1:04:20] and you know i was thinking about
[1:04:21] tommy's testimony and
[1:04:24] i began to think back in
[1:04:26] in times whenever
[1:04:28] we went through hard trials and
[1:04:30] we wondered how we
[1:04:32] how things would go
[1:04:35] and we used to burn propane i hate
[1:04:37] propane i don't even have it anymore
[1:04:39] because i just don't like it
[1:04:41] and at the end of time we'd pray
[1:04:44] think lord if you don't undertake we're
[1:04:46] going to be cold
[1:04:48] and i've seen the lord move in a special
[1:04:50] way
[1:04:51] and what brought that to mine was this
[1:04:53] morning brother andrew glover put a
[1:04:54] thing on
[1:04:56] facebook this morning he said if god
[1:04:58] could turn water into wine he can take
[1:05:00] care of your gas tank where you need to
[1:05:01] go
[1:05:02] so we need to all believe
[1:05:05] and you know i thought you know what
[1:05:07] your problem is and i'm talking about me
[1:05:09] said you've got too much and you don't
[1:05:11] have enough faith like you need to have
[1:05:14] because when it's truth when it comes
[1:05:16] push to shove
[1:05:18] he's never let us down
[1:05:20] we've always failed i have i can't speak
[1:05:23] for you but i have failed many times
[1:05:25] but our heavenly father has never failed
[1:05:28] he's always kept his hand upon us he's
[1:05:31] always led us and guide us in the right
[1:05:32] way
[1:05:34] and i was talking with sean the other
[1:05:36] day and
[1:05:37] we were texting and
[1:05:39] and he told me some things on his heart
[1:05:41] i said i want to tell you
[1:05:44] i said you make sure it's the will of
[1:05:45] god i said because
[1:05:48] i've told this many times i didn't lose
[1:05:50] i didn't move here years ago like the
[1:05:51] lord wanted me to
[1:05:53] i moved here about 16 years ago but a
[1:05:54] long time before that he laid on my
[1:05:56] heart to go
[1:05:57] and i didn't i said you know i said he'd
[1:05:59] give me a good old-fashioned spanking he
[1:06:01] beat the far out of me
[1:06:03] and i said i make sure now that i'm in
[1:06:06] his perfect will because i don't ever
[1:06:08] want another spanking like that
[1:06:10] and i said you just be sure and pray and
[1:06:13] if it's in god's will
[1:06:15] he'll take care of the problem
[1:06:17] and i said don't be like me and get in
[1:06:19] the way
[1:06:20] i can only say that by personal

[1:21:04] amen good to be in the house of the lord
[1:21:05] that'll be all for the music
[1:21:08] i tell you i hope your hearts are full
[1:21:10] of expectation and anticipation this
[1:21:12] morning and not only for the service
[1:21:14] today but for the coming of the lord
[1:21:17] uh brothers and sisters i don't know
[1:21:18] about you but for me the coming of the
[1:21:20] lord is
[1:21:21] more real today than it's ever been in
[1:21:23] my life
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:26] as we look and and see the things that's
[1:21:28] going on around the world and
[1:21:31] and i'm going to bring out some of those
[1:21:32] things today and
[1:21:33] and look at those things and but we as
[1:21:36] christians
[1:21:37] we should be striving and working and
[1:21:40] pushing and dedicating ourselves and our
[1:21:42] and our brothers and sisters others
[1:21:44] around us
[1:21:45] in a you know in a greater way to the
[1:21:47] word of god like we've never pushed
[1:21:50] before
[1:21:52] you know brother byler i was telling him
[1:21:54] he recently spoke on being precise and
[1:21:56] and living with precision and
[1:21:58] and two or three days in a row i worked
[1:22:00] woke up in the morning the first thing
[1:22:02] that hit my mind was man we're so close
[1:22:06] the message he preached on precision
[1:22:08] just really stuck with me and you know
[1:22:10] and
[1:22:11] you know that's important that we are
[1:22:12] precise
[1:22:14] it's important that we're precise
[1:22:16] because there's many in this world that
[1:22:17] claim christianity
[1:22:19] there's many in this world that claim to
[1:22:21] be pride
[1:22:23] many put a claim
[1:22:26] you know the bible tells us there's
[1:22:28] churches churches and brides brides and
[1:22:30] and you know but for many it's just
[1:22:32] claim
[1:22:34] it's just a claim
[1:22:38] you say well how do you know that why
[1:22:39] are you being so critical how do you
[1:22:41] know that i know that because when you
[1:22:43] see scripture
[1:22:44] and you see prophecy begin to be
[1:22:46] fulfilled around them
[1:22:48] they can't handle it
[1:22:51] they can't handle what's really
[1:22:52] happening around them and you begin to
[1:22:54] watch and fear
[1:22:56] and nervousness it begins to set in on
[1:22:58] them
[1:22:59] and they begin to tremble
[1:23:02] at the very word that they claim
[1:23:07] did you think about that
[1:23:09] and i was thinking about myself you know
[1:23:11] and and
[1:23:12] i think you know they're focusing on the
[1:23:14] event
[1:23:17] and not the finality
[1:23:21] the events shouldn't matter to us
[1:23:25] it's the main event the finality
[1:23:28] that we should be looking for because
[1:23:29] the bride she's looking up
[1:23:32] the bride of christ is looking up she
[1:23:33] begins to make herself ready when all
[1:23:35] these things happen there's no fear it's
[1:23:37] no trembling it's dressing herself she's
[1:23:39] getting herself ready and she's
[1:23:41] beginning to look and she's she's saying
[1:23:43] i'm anticipating because the groom is on
[1:23:45] the way in and i'm looking for this
[1:23:47] grand finale this main event the rapture
[1:23:54] let me ask you do you fear russia do you
[1:23:56] fear what's happening
[1:24:02] do we watch do we know do we concern
[1:24:04] sure we are
[1:24:07] but are you scared what are you scared
[1:24:09] of if you're living in christ
[1:24:11] what are you scared of
[1:24:13] turn with me to philippians 2.
[1:24:16] how many loves the lord this morning
[1:24:19] philippians 2.
[1:24:21] i'm going to read out of philippians i i
[1:24:23] tell you what i
[1:24:26] this is going to be one of those
[1:24:28] messages that it's a this is a series
[1:24:31] it's a first half and a second half
[1:24:34] part one part two all in one day
[1:24:38] i told joyce yesterday i tell you we was
[1:24:42] we was running a few errands and should
[1:24:44] never do that on the saturday before
[1:24:46] sunday when you preach and
[1:24:48] i i told her i said man i wish the lord

[1:24:59] yesterday and
[1:25:00] you know i was trying to we just we
[1:25:02] needed to take about an hour and a half
[1:25:03] to run to clarksville and do a few
[1:25:05] things that had to be done and get over
[1:25:07] there in sam's and
[1:25:09] what should have took a
[1:25:10] 30 minutes was an hour
[1:25:12] uh you know loaded up all over
[1:25:15] onto the counter and they said well your
[1:25:16] membership's expired you got to go to
[1:25:18] the member's counter so take everything
[1:25:20] off the
[1:25:21] go to the membership counter you know
[1:25:23] just those kinds of things and it's just
[1:25:25] like your nervousness and stuff wants to
[1:25:27] set in but
[1:25:29] if you've got philippians 2 this morning
[1:25:31] say amen
[1:25:34] let's look at verse 4.
[1:25:37] look not every man on his
[1:25:39] own things but every man also on the
[1:25:41] things of others
[1:25:43] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:25:47] in christ jesus i want to focus a
[1:25:49] portion of our service on that let this
[1:25:51] mind be in you which was also in christ
[1:25:53] jesus who being in the form of god
[1:25:56] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:25:58] god but made himself of no reputation
[1:26:01] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:26:03] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:26:06] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:26:09] humbled himself
[1:26:11] and became obedient unto death
[1:26:14] even the death of the cross i want to
[1:26:17] speak this morning on
[1:26:18] jesus finding lost things jesus finding
[1:26:22] lost things let's pray heavenly father
[1:26:26] we're just thankful to be in your house
[1:26:27] this morning and have a place that we
[1:26:29] can come and worship and fellowship with
[1:26:31] brothers and sisters of light precious
[1:26:33] faith
[1:26:34] brothers and sisters that are committed
[1:26:36] to living a holy life a life that would
[1:26:38] be pleasing to you and lord a life that
[1:26:41] we would reflect on ourselves and look
[1:26:43] and say how can we get closer and and
[1:26:45] make adjustments and corrections and as
[1:26:47] our pastor preached recently on being
[1:26:49] precise in the way we live our life lord
[1:26:52] we're just it's just an honor and a
[1:26:53] privilege to be able to fellowship with
[1:26:55] people like that
[1:26:56] lord we just want to commit ourselves to
[1:26:58] you this morning as the word goes forth
[1:27:00] may it sink down into our hearts to draw
[1:27:02] as close to you if there's somebody here
[1:27:05] that
[1:27:06] that that don't know you're somebody is
[1:27:07] not as close to you as they once were
[1:27:10] for somebody that's maybe just drifted
[1:27:12] lord we just asked or that you would
[1:27:13] just come down and speak to their heart
[1:27:15] our hearts
[1:27:16] because we're we're human lord and and
[1:27:19] we just seek and and long to be close to
[1:27:21] you lord there's nothing like knowing
[1:27:23] that when we call upon your name that
[1:27:25] you can that you'll wrap your arm around
[1:27:27] us lord and pull us close to you lord we
[1:27:30] just want to tell you we love you and
[1:27:31] appreciate you in jesus
[1:27:34] name amen
[1:27:35] amen you can have your seats
[1:27:38] so looking at the scripture here
[1:27:41] um just to lay a foundation
[1:27:44] paul is telling us that if we're going
[1:27:46] to be like christ
[1:27:50] and
[1:27:50] if we're called according to his purpose
[1:27:52] if we are the elect if we're the bride
[1:27:54] if we're the chosen few and and brothers
[1:27:57] and sisters if that's what we're
[1:27:58] claiming this morning then we're going
[1:28:00] to have to have that same mind that
[1:28:02] christ had
[1:28:04] and and and we're going to have to walk
[1:28:06] like him we're going to have to talk
[1:28:07] like him we're going to have to act like
[1:28:09] him we're going to have to conduct
[1:28:10] business like him we're going to have to
[1:28:12] love like him we're gonna have to
[1:28:13] forgive like him
[1:28:14] are you with me this morning
[1:28:16] and as we look at these things you say
[1:28:18] well we've heard that for years
[1:28:21] you're right
[1:28:23] and what we do we take scripture
[1:28:26] and we take these things knowing we have
[1:28:27] a goal in mind we have a place that
[1:28:29] we're trying to get to and knowing how
[1:28:32] that we've got to do these things so we
[1:28:33] begin to take scripture and we break
[1:28:35] down that scripture and we find
[1:28:36] something in the scripture that we can
[1:28:38] type to it and something that can lead
[1:28:40] us along the way because we look back at
[1:28:41] the saints of old and we say if they
[1:28:43] could do it
[1:28:44] we can do it
[1:28:47] god gave us examples placed back way way
[1:28:50] way way way back before we were ever
[1:28:52] born this says there is a way for you to
[1:28:54] be what you should be
[1:28:56] so imagine here if you will
[1:28:59] this man jesus
[1:29:02] so humble
[1:29:05] and so obedient to the word
[1:29:08] so let me tell you you're going to have
[1:29:10] to have the same kind of humility and
[1:29:12] obedience
[1:29:13] if we're going to be like him
[1:29:15] and as we look at this i imagine if you
[1:29:17] will jesus
[1:29:19] coming down from the throne of heaven
[1:29:21] and becoming a man and we look at this
[1:29:24] and we see that jesus was set enthroned
[1:29:27] in heaven's glory
[1:29:29] and there was nobody there to tell jesus
[1:29:31] what to do
[1:29:32] there was no rules for him to
[1:29:35] to have to obey because somebody said
[1:29:37] this was jesus's home this was his
[1:29:39] territory this is god's own domain and
[1:29:42] jesus leaves heaven's glory
[1:29:45] to be found himself in the appearance of
[1:29:47] man
[1:29:48] and becoming obedient to the death that
[1:29:51] was set before him that's what our
[1:29:53] scripture tells us here that he
[1:29:54] fashioned himself as a man
[1:29:57] and brothers and sisters he indeed
[1:29:59] humbled himself
[1:30:00] and we look at this jesus humbled
[1:30:02] himself when he took on
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:04] the form of man
[1:30:06] jesus could have come as anything he
[1:30:08] wanted to
[1:30:09] think about the cr the creation that he
[1:30:11] had in a heavenly being in a heavenly
[1:30:13] place the angels the arab the cherubs
[1:30:16] the seraphims all up there think about
[1:30:18] the golden the golden city as you
[1:30:20] picture jesus and he could have come
[1:30:22] down as any kind of high authority or
[1:30:24] dignitary to set such a standard that
[1:30:27] nobody could ever reach but what did he
[1:30:28] come down as as a man
[1:30:31] humble as a man he was humble that he
[1:30:33] was born in an obscure and oppressed
[1:30:35] place he was born into poverty and
[1:30:37] despised by his people he didn't have to
[1:30:40] come and be born
[1:30:42] in a stable
[1:30:44] but because of his humility he found
[1:30:46] himself being born as a child in a
[1:30:49] stable
[1:30:52] he was humble
[1:30:54] think about this by submitting himself
[1:30:57] into obedience
[1:30:58] as a child in a household
[1:31:06] we have hard enough time telling our
[1:31:07] kids what to do and listening
[1:31:10] jesus finds himself having to be humble
[1:31:13] as a child he finds himself humble as
[1:31:16] he's learning to practice a trade
[1:31:19] as a carpenter
[1:31:20] he finds himself humble we can go on and
[1:31:23] on with the temptations he endured
[1:31:25] the temptations like that you and i have
[1:31:27] to go through
[1:31:29] because he didn't have to
[1:31:31] but the bible said he would have to take
[1:31:33] on all manner of temptations as man
[1:31:35] should take on
[1:31:36] and so there's jesus coming down in
[1:31:38] humility he was humble in the agony of
[1:31:40] his death think about the cross
[1:31:43] how humiliating that would be to be the
[1:31:46] king of glory
[1:31:50] and now you're wearing a crown of thorns
[1:31:54] now you're wearing a purple robe
[1:31:56] scarred with scarlet blood stains think
[1:31:59] of the agony and the humility and the
[1:32:01] shame as the public mocked him and
[1:32:03] humiliated him and he's enduring all
[1:32:06] this agony as a sacrifice on the cross
[1:32:08] what a humbling experience
[1:32:14] turn with me to luke if you would
[1:32:16] chapter 15.
[1:32:18] and here's where we'll base our
[1:32:20] second portion
[1:32:22] it's all going to tie together by god's
[1:32:24] grace
[1:32:28] luke chapter 15.
[1:32:33] very familiar parable a lot of times
[1:32:35] this portion is
[1:32:37] is uh not not preached on a lot
[1:32:40] this portion of it
[1:32:42] luke 15 and 8
[1:32:45] and 9.
[1:32:47] and you're going to have to bear with me
[1:32:48] today because i've got a lot of reading
[1:32:50] i got a lot of quotes i've got a lot of
[1:32:52] prophecies i've got a lot of facts i got
[1:32:54] a lot of stuff that we're just gonna
[1:32:55] have to share to lay the foundation okay
[1:32:58] so stay with me
[1:33:01] luke chapter 15 verse eight and nine
[1:33:04] either what woman having ten pieces of
[1:33:06] silver she loses one piece does not
[1:33:09] light a candle and sweep the house and
[1:33:11] seek diligently till she find it
[1:33:14] and when she had found it she called her
[1:33:16] friends and her neighbors together
[1:33:17] saying rejoice with me for i have found
[1:33:20] the peace which i had
[1:33:22] lost
[1:33:24] now when brother brown preached this
[1:33:25] message on luke 15 8-9 in 1957
[1:33:30] he says this may seem like a very odd
[1:33:32] scripture for the second coming of
[1:33:33] christ
[1:33:34] but it's speaking of the second coming
[1:33:36] of christ and this great subject that we
[1:33:38] have here here before us now is one of
[1:33:41] the most vital subjects in the entire
[1:33:43] holy writ
[1:33:46] the second coming of christ
[1:33:48] and a lot of times we we we think that a
[1:33:50] lot of times it's the death burial and
[1:33:52] resurrection and those things are
[1:33:54] important but he goes on to say that
[1:33:55] this is one of the most important vital
[1:33:57] subjects of the entire holy writ there's
[1:33:59] nothing so important as the coming of
[1:34:01] the lord jesus for if it does not come
[1:34:04] we have been found as false witnesses
[1:34:07] if it does not come our dead that are in
[1:34:10] the graves they're perished
[1:34:12] if it does not come there's no hope left
[1:34:15] for us if jesus does not visibly come
[1:34:17] the second time
[1:34:21] and he said in very this light in this
[1:34:24] very light of the second coming is so
[1:34:25] important and he's preaching this around
[1:34:27] easter so he's talking about the holy
[1:34:29] week of easter coming up and so forth he
[1:34:31] says as it's approaching that jesus when
[1:34:33] he was approaching at the very first
[1:34:35] time the shadows of the cross he spoke
[1:34:37] very little of his death burial and
[1:34:39] resurrection and he spoke more on his
[1:34:42] second coming than he did his death
[1:34:44] burial and resurrection
[1:34:46] he says so in the light of this it's a
[1:34:48] very important subject
[1:34:49] [Music]
[1:34:51] i never really thought about it i never
[1:34:53] really realized it until i read that
[1:34:56] that jesus spoke very little of the
[1:34:57] death burial and resurrection but time
[1:34:59] numerous times over and over and over he
[1:35:02] speaks about his coming back and his
[1:35:04] return because it's such a special day
[1:35:06] and a main event in the history of the
[1:35:09] gospel
[1:35:11] the second coming of the rapture of
[1:35:12] christ he says they can come at any time
[1:35:15] he said now i could miss that by a year
[1:35:18] i could miss it by 20 years i could miss
[1:35:20] it by a hundred years
[1:35:23] let me stop and let me stop this just
[1:35:25] comes to me and i want to
[1:35:28] you know people want to debate
[1:35:31] the prophet the prophecies the message
[1:35:36] there's no debate to be had
[1:35:38] the things i'm about to read you
[1:35:41] was preached in 1960
[1:35:43] and we know the things that were said
[1:35:45] were before that in 1930 or 19
[1:35:49] back in
[1:35:50] early days
[1:35:52] when the prophecies went forth
[1:35:54] but people want to try to debate they
[1:35:56] want to try to find a loophole they want
[1:35:58] to find some way that this stuff don't
[1:36:00] line up
[1:36:03] and my thought to you this morning is
[1:36:06] there's nothing that lines up any closer
[1:36:09] there's nothing that comes
[1:36:11] even close to being able to there's
[1:36:13] nobody ever spoken words in 1940 1950
[1:36:17] 1960 that could be
[1:36:19] what we're looking at today like this
[1:36:21] message right here
[1:36:25] and so that to me there's no debate to
[1:36:27] be had
[1:36:29] so listen as we read these
[1:36:32] i could miss it by 20 years a year or 20
[1:36:34] years i could miss it by 100 years i
[1:36:36] don't know where i like his honesty
[1:36:38] that's what tells me
[1:36:40] that this is genuine
[1:36:42] because he can honestly when he don't
[1:36:44] when he honestly doesn't know he'll tell
[1:36:46] you he honestly doesn't know when it's a
[1:36:48] prediction versus a prophecy there's a
[1:36:50] big difference there
[1:36:52] and he says
[1:36:54] but i'll predict according to the vision
[1:36:56] and and and the way things are
[1:36:58] progressing i say it'll be sometime
[1:36:59] between 33 and 77.
[1:37:02] he said at least this great nation is
[1:37:04] going to strike a war and that's how
[1:37:06] it's going to blow it to bits
[1:37:08] he said it's pretty close it's awful
[1:37:10] close i could be wrong i'm predicting
[1:37:13] everybody understand that
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:18] he said but the lord showed me a vision
[1:37:19] of a great powerful woman in 33 on paper
[1:37:23] and he said roosevelt would help cause
[1:37:25] the war the world to go into a war
[1:37:28] these these things i'm fixing to tell
[1:37:29] you are important to the next half of
[1:37:30] the script or the service so listen
[1:37:32] close how mussolini would make an
[1:37:35] invasion into ethiopia and he would take
[1:37:38] it
[1:37:39] but he would come to a disgraceful end
[1:37:40] and how that the three isms nazism
[1:37:42] fascism communism would all wind up in
[1:37:44] communism and how there are here
[1:37:47] remember
[1:37:48] remember how many here remembers
[1:37:50] uh me saying that and i tell you
[1:37:53] watch russia
[1:37:55] watch russia king of the north
[1:37:58] watch russia
[1:38:00] watch russia king of the north
[1:38:04] he says again watch russia king of the
[1:38:06] north how many has heard me say it he
[1:38:08] said you owe timer see back there in the
[1:38:10] early part of the church watch russia
[1:38:12] king of the north and see what he would
[1:38:14] do for all those islams heap up into
[1:38:16] russia
[1:38:18] he said now this nation would finally go
[1:38:20] to war with germany and germany would
[1:38:23] build the concrete wall you know all
[1:38:25] that happened to took place the
[1:38:27] americans would take an awful beating at
[1:38:28] that line and the brethren at the time
[1:38:30] of the roy roberson and them and asked
[1:38:32] what happened uh he said but finally i
[1:38:35] said we'll we will overcome and we'll be
[1:38:37] the winner in the war between us and
[1:38:38] germany talking about the world war ii
[1:38:40] he said now
[1:38:42] at that time as science would really
[1:38:44] progress
[1:38:47] they did make an atomic bomb and
[1:38:49] everything
[1:38:50] i said during their progression they
[1:38:52] would make cars that began to constantly
[1:38:55] begin to shape like an egg
[1:38:58] and why don't we hear these things
[1:38:59] preached on much anymore
[1:39:01] i can remember hearing these things
[1:39:03] preached on when i was 17 18 20 25
[1:39:07] but for somewhere down the road we've
[1:39:08] gotten kind of away from seeing the
[1:39:10] things that's been placed before us
[1:39:13] i see these cars as shaped like an egg
[1:39:15] and finally they will invent a car that
[1:39:17] won't have a steering wheel in it
[1:39:19] a scene
[1:39:21] he's seen a family going down the road
[1:39:24] in a glass top car great big fine
[1:39:27] looking roads and fine car has anybody
[1:39:29] seen the new tesla y model or the s
[1:39:32] model
[1:39:34] glass from front to back
[1:39:38] it's one big glass as far as you can see
[1:39:42] the whole thing
[1:39:43] and you know what it's kind of shaped
[1:39:45] like an egg
[1:39:48] i'm not saying tesla's what he saw but
[1:39:50] we're seeing what he saw
[1:39:54] and they were sitting there looking at
[1:39:55] one another and the car was running by
[1:39:57] itself
[1:39:58] and going right on around the curves and
[1:40:00] everything he said they've got the car
[1:40:02] now it's already invented
[1:40:05] he said they've got the car and he said
[1:40:07] oh how science will progress
[1:40:12] brother glenn just got a new vehicle
[1:40:14] one of them nice ones
[1:40:16] i like that vehicle
[1:40:19] we we just got us a new one
[1:40:24] and it is amazing
[1:40:28] and if any of you got any uh our old one
[1:40:30] was old one so i don't know maybe i
[1:40:31] don't know how
[1:40:32] how modern this technology is
[1:40:35] but we can hit cruise control
[1:40:38] and we go driving down the road then we
[1:40:40] hit another button that recognizes the
[1:40:42] lines on the road
[1:40:44] so if i veer over
[1:40:46] it tells me to get back
[1:40:49] well i can push another button
[1:40:52] and i can let go of the steering wheel
[1:40:55] and that thing will drive itself
[1:40:59] i said look at this
[1:41:04] just just
[1:41:05] went on for it went on for quite a while
[1:41:07] and then bbb please place your hands on
[1:41:09] the steering wheel oh okay
[1:41:14] but i didn't have to
[1:41:16] the car was doing it itself brother
[1:41:18] glenn yours do it
[1:41:20] if you're like me have you figured out
[1:41:21] those buttons yet
[1:41:27] but that goes to the next thing science
[1:41:29] is progressing
[1:41:30] technology is progressing science
[1:41:32] progresses in that day he said i seen
[1:41:35] now you
[1:41:36] don't you ladies don't get mad at me
[1:41:38] when i say this
[1:41:40] i'm just repeating what he said
[1:41:42] but when you look back you can see the
[1:41:43] truth
[1:41:44] they're going to permit women to vote
[1:41:47] and by voting they're going to
[1:41:49] elect
[1:41:51] the wrong man some of these days
[1:41:54] he said and you did that at the last
[1:41:56] election when the woman voted in kennedy
[1:41:59] and he said now
[1:42:01] you'll see
[1:42:02] crooked machines and things they fixed
[1:42:04] up
[1:42:06] and the fbi
[1:42:08] exposed it
[1:42:11] does anybody remember this last election
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:18] if if that don't strike a nerve right
[1:42:20] there
[1:42:22] fbi expose it
[1:42:25] and he said they won't do anything about
[1:42:28] it
[1:42:28] because they're afraid they'll lose
[1:42:30] their job
[1:42:33] that are rotten to
[1:42:35] the core
[1:42:40] so think about this
[1:42:42] think about what we're seeing taking
[1:42:44] place in front of us
[1:42:46] the very day that we're living in and
[1:42:47] brothers and sisters everything to the
[1:42:49] human race after the cross of calvary
[1:42:52] rests solemnly upon the second coming of
[1:42:55] the lord
[1:42:58] and there's religions all over the world
[1:43:00] and there's different motives and
[1:43:02] different objectives different
[1:43:03] theologies and christians
[1:43:05] but christians around the world should
[1:43:07] base it upon death burial resurrection
[1:43:09] and the second coming of the lord jesus
[1:43:12] christ
[1:43:14] living today
[1:43:16] in the shadows
[1:43:18] we
[1:43:20] i can't stress it enough and i'm going
[1:43:22] to say it over we are living in the
[1:43:24] shadows of the second coming of christ
[1:43:31] let's listen to this there's not one
[1:43:34] hope left for the church outside of the
[1:43:37] second coming
[1:43:39] the world in itself it's
[1:43:42] listen to this
[1:43:43] this this ain't even a word this wasn't
[1:43:45] even a word it's still not a word he
[1:43:47] used this word and my computer flagged
[1:43:49] it and said this is not this is not a
[1:43:51] word
[1:43:52] and i don't know if i can say it the way
[1:43:53] it's written
[1:43:55] the world is in its wild
[1:43:57] pandemonic
[1:43:59] condition
[1:44:02] did we just go through a panda pandemic
[1:44:06] did we just go through two years of
[1:44:08] covet
[1:44:10] two and a half years of a pandemic in
[1:44:11] the world he says in a wild
[1:44:14] have you ever lived such a wild
[1:44:15] experience we just went through
[1:44:18] as this panda pandemonic
[1:44:21] condition
[1:44:23] he says it has gotten completely out of
[1:44:26] control
[1:44:28] in every man-made organization of the
[1:44:30] world
[1:44:31] he says kings
[1:44:33] can't hold their kingdoms dignitaries
[1:44:35] can't hold their their dictators can't
[1:44:37] hold their people democracy can't hold
[1:44:39] people anymore there's nothing left
[1:44:41] but the second coming of the lord do you
[1:44:43] see the prophecies happening
[1:44:46] so let me challenge you this morning are
[1:44:47] we living the way we want to be living
[1:44:52] because if you agree with me that we're
[1:44:53] right at the brink of the greatest event
[1:44:56] that's ever happened
[1:44:58] since the existence of mankind
[1:45:01] and you claim to be a part of it
[1:45:04] you claimed you told me you claimed it
[1:45:08] are we where we want to be
[1:45:13] because he says it's the most horrible
[1:45:14] time for the unbeliever
[1:45:19] and the center
[1:45:21] that ever witnessed because the doom
[1:45:24] time is close at hand
[1:45:27] but it's the most blessed time for the
[1:45:29] believer it's the most blessed time for
[1:45:31] the people that believe the word of god
[1:45:33] and who live the word of god because
[1:45:35] there's two factors he says on this
[1:45:37] earth tonight the lord is coming to
[1:45:39] condemn one and he's coming to take away
[1:45:41] the other
[1:45:43] so where do you stand this morning
[1:45:47] he said if i want to know what time it
[1:45:49] was
[1:45:50] i'd look at my watch
[1:45:53] i said what we do we got an appointment
[1:45:55] we got somewhere important to be
[1:45:57] what
[1:45:58] time is it what time is it honey i got
[1:46:00] to be here what time is it oh let me see
[1:46:01] it's uh it's 15 until
[1:46:04] 12.
[1:46:06] is that right
[1:46:09] it's 15 to 12.
[1:46:12] he said if i if i want to know what day
[1:46:14] it was
[1:46:16] or what what day of the week it was or
[1:46:18] what month
[1:46:20] when he said i would look at a calendar
[1:46:23] and he said if i want to know the
[1:46:24] approaching the time of this great event
[1:46:26] i would look at the word of god
[1:46:29] he said and that tells me
[1:46:31] that time is at hand
[1:46:35] for the bible says when these things
[1:46:36] come to pass lift up your head your
[1:46:38] redemption is not time is at hand
[1:46:40] brothers and sisters we if we can't see
[1:46:44] how close we are i think we're probably
[1:46:46] as blind as bats
[1:46:49] i think god has allowed
[1:46:51] iphones
[1:46:53] technology
[1:46:55] cars
[1:46:56] these things that were prophesied he's
[1:46:58] allowed us to see him
[1:47:00] as an awakening to the hour we're living
[1:47:03] in
[1:47:04] and i thought to myself the other day
[1:47:06] how thankful when i said that the the
[1:47:09] the coming of the lord means more to me
[1:47:10] today than it ever has i thought how
[1:47:12] thankful should i be that this was
[1:47:14] revealed to me that i could see
[1:47:18] because churches all around the country
[1:47:20] churches all around the world do not
[1:47:22] have this knowledge
[1:47:24] or they don't accept this knowledge
[1:47:31] so there's soon there's coming a day
[1:47:35] that life will no longer exist
[1:47:37] as we know it the life will no longer
[1:47:40] matter
[1:47:42] you know those jobs you go to
[1:47:46] that you labor
[1:47:48] at they won't matter
[1:47:52] you know this body that you died all the
[1:47:54] time and you watch what you're eating
[1:47:56] you lifting weights and you run you're
[1:47:57] trying to get yourself in shape and
[1:47:59] you're trying to do all these things
[1:48:02] it won't matter
[1:48:06] all that money we're working hard to
[1:48:08] make
[1:48:10] it won't matter
[1:48:12] all that you try to do for organization
[1:48:14] and church
[1:48:18] that's what he said
[1:48:21] it don't matter
[1:48:22] you know i can remember it wasn't too
[1:48:23] long ago i had
[1:48:27] community-based services and
[1:48:28] organizations wanted me to serve on
[1:48:30] boards they want me to serve on this
[1:48:31] board and that board and and be a part
[1:48:33] of this organization to help push the
[1:48:35] community and so forth
[1:48:36] and so i was thinking i was serving on
[1:48:38] three boards
[1:48:39] uh
[1:48:40] and and and coaching baseball and doing
[1:48:42] those things you know what i found out
[1:48:45] those boards
[1:48:46] didn't matter
[1:48:50] i may be blackballed in the community if
[1:48:52] anybody sees that
[1:48:53] they try to do good work and they're
[1:48:55] doing good work for the community
[1:48:57] i'm here for that's not the work i'm
[1:48:59] sent to do so i had to let those
[1:49:02] boards go because those things are
[1:49:04] coming to a time that all of that stuff
[1:49:06] is about to vanish
[1:49:09] and jesus said
[1:49:10] they ask jesus what'll be the signs how
[1:49:13] will we know and he tells them he said
[1:49:15] here's what the sign will be
[1:49:17] he says the time will come when there
[1:49:19] will not be a stone left up on another
[1:49:21] you'll hear of war
[1:49:22] wars rumors of wars pestilence
[1:49:25] earthquakes and diverse places
[1:49:29] you see it's written
[1:49:32] it's right there for us to read in black
[1:49:33] and white
[1:49:35] but people don't want it
[1:49:39] because they think
[1:49:43] life matters
[1:49:44] when i say that i mean here
[1:49:47] your jobs your careers
[1:49:50] your accomplishments
[1:49:52] your money
[1:49:55] and we hear these things preached on
[1:49:57] over and over but so sometime down the
[1:50:00] road this is going to become a reality
[1:50:05] jesus began to speak to him he said the
[1:50:07] time will come wars rumors or pestilence
[1:50:09] earthquakes and divers places and he
[1:50:11] says when you see the fig tree
[1:50:14] putting forth its bud
[1:50:17] the jews now he says the jews have been
[1:50:19] scattered all around the world in great
[1:50:22] numbers millions
[1:50:24] in germany in italy united states all
[1:50:28] over the world
[1:50:29] and god as he did in the early days
[1:50:32] hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:50:35] he hardened mussolini's heart
[1:50:38] on the jews and the jews were ousted
[1:50:41] from italy he hardened hitler's heart
[1:50:44] they were ousted from germany he
[1:50:47] hardened stalin's heart and they were
[1:50:49] ousted from
[1:50:50] russia let me read you this current
[1:50:53] article in the jerusalem post
[1:50:56] as tensions between ukraine and russia
[1:50:58] began escalating in november some
[1:51:00] israeli officials said that they were
[1:51:02] preparing for a wave of mass immigration
[1:51:05] from ukraine were at least two hundred
[1:51:08] thousand
[1:51:09] who are eligible to immigrate to israel
[1:51:11] under its law of the law
[1:51:14] of return for jews
[1:51:16] for their relatives according to the
[1:51:19] european jury
[1:51:21] jewry
[1:51:25] you know those jews have to go home
[1:51:31] that's scriptural
[1:51:33] those jews have to go home
[1:51:36] and we don't understand why things
[1:51:38] happen maybe the way they did when you
[1:51:39] don't look through these eyes
[1:51:42] but when you look through these eyes you
[1:51:44] see the purpose of stalling
[1:51:46] you see the purpose it has nothing to do
[1:51:48] with a nation it has nothing to do with
[1:51:50] germany it has nothing to do with russia
[1:51:52] it has nothing to do with ukraine it has
[1:51:53] to do with god and israel and him
[1:51:56] getting his people where they should
[1:51:57] have never left in the first place
[1:52:00] it's all calling them back to a place so
[1:52:03] that the rapture can happen
[1:52:06] you are seeing prophecy scripture being
[1:52:09] fulfilled on a day-to-day basis
[1:52:15] he says now
[1:52:17] 62 years ago
[1:52:20] he said i have a picture at home
[1:52:23] and he said it's called by the scientist
[1:52:25] three minutes before midnight
[1:52:28] if the scientific world has said that
[1:52:30] the clock has went around until it's
[1:52:31] three minutes before midnight
[1:52:34] he said
[1:52:35] do you know what has anybody looked that
[1:52:37] up i looked it up i thought well if they
[1:52:38] had it back then i won't see what this
[1:52:40] thing looks like
[1:52:41] so it's the doomsday clock the
[1:52:43] scientists created 75 years ago
[1:52:47] and he's looking at this clock and it
[1:52:49] says they said because of the atomic
[1:52:51] powers that they've made he said that
[1:52:53] the atomic the oxygen the atomic and all
[1:52:55] those great powers they could harness
[1:52:58] and 62 years ago
[1:53:01] said we had three minutes
[1:53:03] left
[1:53:06] on the clock
[1:53:08] now this clock fluctuates depending on
[1:53:10] how things are going in the world
[1:53:12] okay
[1:53:14] so at some time back in i don't know
[1:53:15] maybe the uh early late 80s and 90s the
[1:53:19] clock went down to 17
[1:53:21] things were pretty good according to
[1:53:23] scientists
[1:53:26] now
[1:53:27] i looked at it
[1:53:28] we're 100 seconds
[1:53:35] 100 seconds on today's world
[1:53:38] clock based on atomic powers
[1:53:43] based on leadership around the world
[1:53:48] listen now
[1:53:50] he says
[1:53:51] they've got enough power
[1:53:53] 62 years ago that they could harness
[1:53:56] they could completely cause the
[1:53:57] annihilation
[1:53:59] in five minutes time
[1:54:01] they could absolutely tonight there
[1:54:02] could not be one living person on the
[1:54:05] entire north american continent in 30
[1:54:08] minutes
[1:54:11] now let me ask you does your job matter
[1:54:17] does the car you drive matter
[1:54:20] now i'm not teaching
[1:54:22] slothfulness i'm not telling you to
[1:54:24] any way you want and don't take care of
[1:54:26] your stuff and i'm not telling you that
[1:54:28] you go to work you try to do the better
[1:54:30] that's that's the way god intended it
[1:54:33] but in the grand scheme of things
[1:54:36] what matters is where you stand
[1:54:39] what matters is the life you're living
[1:54:41] he says because in 30 minutes time it's
[1:54:43] laying right in the bunch of hands of
[1:54:45] infidels
[1:54:46] who hate us
[1:54:50] they hate us
[1:54:51] he said and besides that we've got
[1:54:52] barges and ships set around all over
[1:54:55] siberia hungary in different places
[1:54:57] where our ships are sitting loaded with
[1:54:58] the same type of missiles
[1:55:03] just like that
[1:55:05] let me tell you putin's lost his mind
[1:55:11] listen
[1:55:12] 60 62 years ago
[1:55:16] they right in moscow could direct
[1:55:18] missiles guided by stars and radar they
[1:55:21] could
[1:55:22] exactly on 4th street in lowell if they
[1:55:24] wanted to
[1:55:25] you know that's not too far away i can
[1:55:27] be in louisville about two hours
[1:55:30] and those kind of bombs carry quite a
[1:55:32] punch
[1:55:34] he said what would happen my brother if
[1:55:35] that great missile turning would take
[1:55:37] place in this country and receive a
[1:55:39] shake and at the same hour we would turn
[1:55:42] loose of the same thing and shake it on
[1:55:43] the other side and we're living on a
[1:55:45] little bitty bitty tiny thin crust
[1:55:47] anyhow because the earthquakes
[1:55:50] have eaten away and hollowed out
[1:55:54] the earth
[1:55:58] he said it's hollowing out like an egg
[1:56:01] you ever tried to squeeze the egg that's
[1:56:03] full you can't hardly do it but you
[1:56:05] squeeze the egg that's had the yolk
[1:56:07] blown out of it you can just crush it
[1:56:09] easy
[1:56:10] and he says it's sitting there just like
[1:56:11] an egg and she'll make one big burst and
[1:56:13] then as eight thousand miles of thick
[1:56:16] lava
[1:56:17] will spew into the air and do exactly
[1:56:20] what god said would take place
[1:56:23] we're at the end time
[1:56:25] that's where we're at
[1:56:27] no way to stop it
[1:56:34] i don't know if i get uh
[1:56:36] concerned
[1:56:37] or chuckle a little bit
[1:56:39] or i don't know what what i feel when
[1:56:41] you talk these things to people
[1:56:44] and they act like this this part of the
[1:56:46] scripture don't exist
[1:56:48] they like jesus on a cross
[1:56:50] that forgives them of the bad things
[1:56:52] they do
[1:56:53] so that they can go out and do it again
[1:56:55] and get forgiven again
[1:56:58] but they don't want to hear the part
[1:57:00] where it all comes to a glorious sin
[1:57:03] there's very few people that are excited
[1:57:04] about what's happening
[1:57:06] but the bride of jesus christ is
[1:57:08] actually on this on the verge of
[1:57:10] excitement you know that bride when
[1:57:12] she's waiting in that chamber she's
[1:57:13] excited
[1:57:15] she's she's dressed herself she's got
[1:57:16] her garment on she's
[1:57:18] living with anticipation of the wedding
[1:57:21] and the marriage is fixing to happen and
[1:57:24] that bride is sitting there waiting for
[1:57:25] this and there's no way to stop it
[1:57:29] there's no minute they're going to get
[1:57:30] up there and says whoever thinks that
[1:57:32] they shouldn't get gary just now's your
[1:57:34] time to speak that's not going to happen
[1:57:37] nobody's stopping this marriage
[1:57:39] nobody's gonna stop this when it happens
[1:57:41] he says you can put a eisenhower in
[1:57:44] every country it'll never stop it
[1:57:48] the fig tree is putting forth her buds
[1:57:51] let me tell you this
[1:57:54] you can put a trump
[1:57:56] you know some people want to think trump
[1:57:58] is the answer to it all
[1:58:01] let me tell you what the prophet said no
[1:58:03] way to stop it
[1:58:08] well
[1:58:09] i've heard that before
[1:58:11] we've had wars before we thought that
[1:58:14] was going to be the end of the world
[1:58:15] we've
[1:58:16] we've seen all these things where we've
[1:58:18] had earthquakes that shook california
[1:58:20] we've had earthquakes we've had
[1:58:21] terrorist attacks that shook our nation
[1:58:23] we've had all this stuff
[1:58:26] so why when or why is it even going to
[1:58:29] happen
[1:58:31] it's going to happen
[1:58:33] let me tell you there's going to be a
[1:58:34] date there's going to be one time
[1:58:36] there's going to be that last earthquake
[1:58:38] there's going to be that last war
[1:58:40] there's going to be that last jew that
[1:58:42] goes back to israel it's going to happen
[1:58:46] be ready when it happens the prophet i
[1:58:48] was reading somewhere else he was
[1:58:49] talking about he was in california for
[1:58:51] some meetings and he was sitting in a
[1:58:52] barber shop and the jars and the
[1:58:55] canisters started to come off the shelf
[1:58:57] he said i got up and i run to find my
[1:58:58] wife he said this could be the last one
[1:59:06] so there's going to be a last one
[1:59:08] you said were you sure doom and gloom
[1:59:10] this morning and
[1:59:12] no
[1:59:13] i'm just trying to make sure my bags are
[1:59:15] packed
[1:59:17] i'm trying to make sure your bags are
[1:59:19] packed i'm trying to make sure this
[1:59:20] morning that we don't miss that trip
[1:59:22] because we we can't afford to miss that
[1:59:24] trip we can't afford to miss he said why
[1:59:27] don't you miss it
[1:59:29] we don't want to be here when these
[1:59:30] bombs start falling
[1:59:32] the bride will be gone before that first
[1:59:34] one hits on 4th street in louisville let
[1:59:35] me assure you of that
[1:59:40] just know where you're at
[1:59:43] because if anything in my life is out of
[1:59:45] place i want to find it
[1:59:47] if anything is out of place or i've lost
[1:59:50] something that i have to have to make
[1:59:51] that trip i want to find and i want you
[1:59:53] know jesus finds lost
[2:00:00] jesus is telling the story
[2:00:05] in the 15th chapter and he's explaining
[2:00:06] about the lost sheep to the pharisees
[2:00:09] and you remember they got angry at jesus
[2:00:12] they got angry at jesus because he was
[2:00:14] explaining about these lost sheep
[2:00:17] and they got angry because jesus sat
[2:00:19] down and ate with these people
[2:00:22] he went to the lost
[2:00:24] he went through those people and he ate
[2:00:26] with him and the pharisee said i can't
[2:00:27] believe that you would be around those
[2:00:29] such sinners as that
[2:00:36] and he started sharing a story about a
[2:00:38] foolish sheep
[2:00:40] a foolish sheep
[2:00:42] that had wandered off
[2:00:44] on his own
[2:00:47] now if i were to ask you to raise your
[2:00:49] hands
[2:00:50] how many foolish sheep have we had in
[2:00:52] here
[2:00:54] yeah
[2:00:55] both of mine go up
[2:00:58] this foolish sheep that had wandered
[2:01:00] away from the shepherd
[2:01:02] and it wandered off foolishly away from
[2:01:04] christ and away from the word of god and
[2:01:06] isaiah says all of us are like sheep
[2:01:08] that have gone
[2:01:09] astray
[2:01:11] so we can't point fingers
[2:01:13] there's no finger pointing this morning
[2:01:17] if you're looking at something look at
[2:01:18] yourself in the mirror and say where am
[2:01:20] i
[2:01:21] that's our challenge this morning
[2:01:24] and this this
[2:01:27] wandering sheep leaves out from the from
[2:01:30] the herd from the flock
[2:01:33] but you know god
[2:01:35] who's rich in mercy
[2:01:38] he couldn't stand to see that that
[2:01:40] little sheep over there wander all by he
[2:01:42] knew what was in store for that sheep
[2:01:46] and god goes
[2:01:48] down just like he has for you and for me
[2:01:50] and he goes down there because he's got
[2:01:51] a heart for the people and he pulls that
[2:01:54] little sheep back into the flock
[2:01:57] and nurtures them
[2:02:00] why is it sometimes when
[2:02:02] people leave church and they come back
[2:02:03] we have a grudge against them
[2:02:08] yeah
[2:02:10] it'll be a day of rejoicing
[2:02:12] when someone who has left or went out
[2:02:14] and done things and got into a position
[2:02:16] in their life and strayed away from god
[2:02:18] and god goes out and pricks their heart
[2:02:20] and pulls them back into the flock
[2:02:23] it'll be a day of rejoicing say another
[2:02:26] one is saved
[2:02:28] another one won't suffer destruction
[2:02:33] but sometimes we look at them through
[2:02:34] eyes like
[2:02:38] here they are
[2:02:39] i see you
[2:02:43] oh me
[2:02:47] but jesus
[2:02:48] finds lost things
[2:02:53] jesus didn't stop
[2:02:54] there with that lesson
[2:02:59] you know because these pharisees
[2:03:01] they were critical
[2:03:03] anything he said they want to criticize
[2:03:07] so they couldn't settle for what he had
[2:03:09] said in the example he just gave so he
[2:03:10] began to give another example there and
[2:03:12] he began to tell these religious leaders
[2:03:15] something else that he wanted them to
[2:03:17] see and he wants us to see
[2:03:20] and without taking a breath he goes
[2:03:22] right into the scenario about a woman
[2:03:23] who had 10 coins
[2:03:25] and she lost one of them
[2:03:28] now when we read this in the bible
[2:03:31] it reminds me of sophomore year of
[2:03:34] algebra
[2:03:36] martha had 10 coins and she can't find
[2:03:38] them all she lost one she gained two how
[2:03:40] many did martha have
[2:03:44] but when we read
[2:03:46] this story we begin to look at this
[2:03:49] and see what exactly happened because
[2:03:51] jesus looked at it and he says there's
[2:03:53] one missing
[2:03:55] because he called it the lost coin
[2:03:58] he said there's one missing
[2:04:00] you say well what's the big deal she's
[2:04:02] got nine more
[2:04:06] but there's something special about
[2:04:07] these coins
[2:04:10] it's more than just having a monetary
[2:04:12] value
[2:04:14] to these coins
[2:04:17] these coins that we're talking about
[2:04:21] shows that a woman was engaged or
[2:04:23] married
[2:04:26] they didn't wear wedding bands like we
[2:04:28] wear
[2:04:29] his brother brown said if a woman is
[2:04:31] married she should wear a wedding ring
[2:04:32] as a sign she's married
[2:04:43] he says that's to keep other men from
[2:04:45] having anything to do with her they look
[2:04:47] at her and they say she's a married
[2:04:48] woman
[2:04:49] in those days they didn't have wedding
[2:04:51] rings they had what called a tablet
[2:04:53] and they put it on their head
[2:04:55] ever seen the pictures of the women from
[2:04:57] the middle east they've got the band
[2:04:58] that runs across their head
[2:05:00] it's usually a golden band or something
[2:05:02] that's woven with gold threads and then
[2:05:04] it has little dangly things i thought
[2:05:05] that was to make those when they danced
[2:05:08] because you know they they like to dance
[2:05:10] and
[2:05:11] over there
[2:05:13] don't tell me you've never watched
[2:05:14] anything biblical movies where the
[2:05:16] women's always dancing
[2:05:20] but i thought it was to make a jingle no
[2:05:22] it's to signify that they're married
[2:05:24] it's to signify that they're engaged and
[2:05:26] so these coins they had on around their
[2:05:28] head told everybody i'm taking boys
[2:05:31] don't flirt with me
[2:05:35] and so here these these coins are that
[2:05:37] are around their head they had really no
[2:05:39] monetary value they could have been gold
[2:05:41] it could have been silver it could have
[2:05:42] been any kind of metal that there was it
[2:05:44] didn't really matter but it showed a
[2:05:46] site just like a legendary some people
[2:05:47] get one carrot some people get two cats
[2:05:49] some people get
[2:05:50] they carry it
[2:05:53] you get what you get you don't throw a
[2:05:55] fit
[2:05:55] so monetary value had no part with these
[2:05:58] coins
[2:06:03] and they got these right here placed
[2:06:05] around their forehead
[2:06:06] but these coins had certain value
[2:06:10] spiritually
[2:06:12] scripturally
[2:06:14] and the prophet said the first one was
[2:06:16] the coin meant the love to her husband
[2:06:20] the second one was a pledge a virtue to
[2:06:22] live clean for him
[2:06:24] the third fourth fifth ninth and tenth
[2:06:26] they all had things he said i don't have
[2:06:28] time to go into it look go to galatians
[2:06:29] 5 if you want to look it up fruits of
[2:06:31] the spirits where he's going with that
[2:06:33] he says his love joy peace long
[2:06:35] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[2:06:37] patience
[2:06:38] the tablet was supposed to be worn in
[2:06:40] church
[2:06:42] brotherly love
[2:06:45] kindness
[2:06:48] godliness patience temperance knowledge
[2:06:50] virtue faith
[2:06:52] now are you with me
[2:06:56] and if we were to look back into the
[2:06:57] culture in the days of jesus
[2:06:59] we would see that these coins were so
[2:07:02] special
[2:07:03] they wasn't coins like we would just
[2:07:04] throw into a jar
[2:07:07] no they wasn't that kind of coin they
[2:07:09] had meaning
[2:07:11] i like my coins i'm the kind of guy that
[2:07:13] goes to the restaurant or whatever and
[2:07:15] if they say it's ten dollars
[2:07:16] from eleven dollars if i got a nickel in
[2:07:18] my pocket because i want my 95 cents
[2:07:20] back
[2:07:21] my wife's just opposite she'll dig out
[2:07:24] 99 pennies
[2:07:25] before she'll give them a dollar
[2:07:32] but i like my coins but that's not these
[2:07:34] kind of coins these coins were important
[2:07:37] sign of engagement just like the statue
[2:07:40] of a perfect man
[2:07:43] these virtues are important
[2:07:45] they signify something
[2:07:47] they announce to the world who you are
[2:07:51] just like it announced to the world this
[2:07:53] headdress of this ten coins announced
[2:07:55] i'm taking it
[2:07:56] this announces to the world we're taken
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:06] so to lose one of these coins
[2:08:09] will be like you ladies losing your
[2:08:11] engagement ring
[2:08:15] boy do i have a story
[2:08:19] my
[2:08:20] wife takes hers off probably like most
[2:08:23] of you do when she cooks or whatever
[2:08:26] so she comes in
[2:08:30] i can't find my ring
[2:08:32] what was you doing patting out hamburger
[2:08:35] me
[2:08:38] that don't sound good
[2:08:43] we look and we look and we look
[2:08:45] and we find it that's where'd you put it
[2:08:46] she's always laying on top of the coffee
[2:08:48] maker
[2:08:51] that's where i always put it it's not
[2:08:52] there did you make coffee no i didn't
[2:08:54] make coffee i didn't i didn't know it
[2:08:56] didn't didn't lose it don't blame me
[2:09:00] so i go looking at a coffee maker and i
[2:09:02] look i look down inside this little
[2:09:04] crevice
[2:09:06] and how that ring got in that crevice
[2:09:08] i'll never know
[2:09:09] but i could see it down in there
[2:09:13] i fished it out
[2:09:15] good to go
[2:09:17] a few days later
[2:09:18] i'm eating at the table she's doing
[2:09:20] something over by the dishes
[2:09:22] and i almost choked and spit food
[2:09:24] everywhere because i see her ring laying
[2:09:26] on the floor and our dog is fixing to
[2:09:28] lick it and pick it up
[2:09:30] not good
[2:09:33] oh oh
[2:09:34] your ring
[2:09:35] okay i'm just about to spit food
[2:09:37] everywhere
[2:09:40] so she picks it up well how did i
[2:09:43] it's never come off my finger before i
[2:09:44] was just washing my hands i said it's
[2:09:46] cold out your hands are shrunken
[2:09:51] so my mom makes her this little dish
[2:09:53] that she can put her ring in now and
[2:09:55] it's
[2:09:55] set there so she can know where it's at
[2:09:57] and it shouldn't get knocked off but we
[2:10:00] go down to plant flowers the other day
[2:10:03] and i said you got your ring on
[2:10:06] yeah yeah i'm i'm making sure they'll
[2:10:08] come off
[2:10:09] somebody's gonna get a golden pot of
[2:10:11] flowers that's all i can say
[2:10:15] so
[2:10:17] the value
[2:10:19] the ring
[2:10:20] the tablet
[2:10:23] it would be like you lose your
[2:10:24] engagement ring
[2:10:27] so you can imagine why it makes complete
[2:10:30] sense
[2:10:31] that this woman once she sees that this
[2:10:33] coin is missing
[2:10:35] that she begins to tear her house
[2:10:36] completely apart upside down
[2:10:39] and the focus on this is not the woman
[2:10:43] the focus is on the coin
[2:10:46] jesus is not worried about the one he's
[2:10:48] worried about the coin she's lost
[2:10:51] and jesus is trying to point this out to
[2:10:53] the to the people to the pharisees he's
[2:10:55] talking to that this parable is about
[2:10:57] things that are lost
[2:10:59] because it signifies something in her
[2:11:01] life that she's either lost one her
[2:11:03] virtue she's lost uh
[2:11:05] her dignity
[2:11:07] and and keep in mind that jesus finds
[2:11:09] lost things don't forget that and he's
[2:11:12] drawing our attention to this lost coin
[2:11:19] you know sometimes monetary value
[2:11:22] versus
[2:11:23] heart value
[2:11:24] is a big difference
[2:11:29] because let me tell you
[2:11:33] if i lose one of these coins
[2:11:38] that's going to hurt
[2:11:41] i can't buy that
[2:11:45] it's taken years
[2:11:49] for me to get some of those coins
[2:11:53] and some of them i've just got a very
[2:11:55] small portion of
[2:11:59] so sentimental value
[2:12:02] these coins come through the trials
[2:12:05] you've been through
[2:12:07] these call you learn faith when you're
[2:12:09] in the gutter
[2:12:11] is that right
[2:12:12] you learn faith when you're in the
[2:12:14] gutter your virtue
[2:12:16] you learn that as you've been to grow in
[2:12:18] christ we get on out there to patients
[2:12:20] some of us are still just really really
[2:12:22] really thin on patients
[2:12:26] brotherly kindness
[2:12:33] let me move on
[2:12:36] brotherly kindness
[2:12:38] we've all got room to grow
[2:12:41] but i can tell you one thing
[2:12:44] under no circumstance i want to lose any
[2:12:46] of those because when i lose those my
[2:12:49] whole character changes
[2:12:52] well at least mine does
[2:12:56] if i begin to lose my brotherly love i
[2:12:58] find fault in people
[2:13:01] if i begin to lose my faith i can't
[2:13:03] overcome any obstacles
[2:13:06] if i lose my virtue i begin to live any
[2:13:09] way i want to live
[2:13:10] when i lose my knowledge i begin to
[2:13:12] doubt the word
[2:13:14] are you with me you see how important
[2:13:16] these are it's just like that woman that
[2:13:18] was so important and she was loaded out
[2:13:20] looking into
[2:13:22] me cleaning doing some things around the
[2:13:23] house and looks into a little looking
[2:13:25] glass that sees
[2:13:26] that coin's gone
[2:13:28] you see how subtle and how quick it
[2:13:30] jumps up on you
[2:13:34] listen to
[2:13:35] what this what he says visit again he
[2:13:37] said it was getting close tonight and
[2:13:39] close to dark and her husband will be
[2:13:41] coming home soon and if he found one of
[2:13:43] those coins listen
[2:13:46] you know what it meant
[2:13:47] it meant that she was marked as a harlot
[2:13:53] that puts a new meaning i'm not losing
[2:13:55] any of these don't
[2:13:56] it if it's all new meaning i'm not
[2:13:59] losing any of these she would be marked
[2:14:01] as a harlot it would show that she had
[2:14:02] been defiled and she would be seen by
[2:14:05] the people because her priest would come
[2:14:07] and and that seen and witnessed it and
[2:14:10] who the one who brought a witness would
[2:14:12] come to the priest and she if she was a
[2:14:13] married woman and he would take the tab
[2:14:15] the coin out of her tablet
[2:14:19] so that everybody she come in contact
[2:14:22] with
[2:14:23] would know
[2:14:24] what she'd been doing
[2:14:27] if she'd been out flirting showing she
[2:14:29] wasn't true to her husband they took it
[2:14:32] out
[2:14:33] and when the husband come home and found
[2:14:35] that she would be marked he would
[2:14:36] divorce her immediately and had nothing
[2:14:39] to do with such a woman
[2:14:40] he did not want such a woman
[2:14:45] you know christ is coming back for a
[2:14:47] bride
[2:14:49] that wears that tablet
[2:14:52] and if we're not following that tablet
[2:14:54] what are we marked as
[2:14:57] and if we lose one of those and christ
[2:14:59] comes out and he says ah
[2:15:01] you look really good except for
[2:15:06] put whatever you struggle with
[2:15:10] so that shows us the important
[2:15:12] and the prophet said it's better for the
[2:15:14] church to be examining ourselves and to
[2:15:16] see our purity to see our loyalty to
[2:15:19] see our devotion
[2:15:20] because all most of the world he says
[2:15:23] that you look and he said you look at
[2:15:25] the rest of the world in the christian
[2:15:26] church and they're associating with
[2:15:27] things out in the world and you can
[2:15:29] hardly tell one from the other
[2:15:32] this is what distinguishes us one from
[2:15:35] the other
[2:15:36] this is what when you walk out on a
[2:15:38] day-to-day basis that people can say hey
[2:15:39] that person's different
[2:15:41] that person is different they believe
[2:15:44] they have faith he said i've never seen
[2:15:47] such faith as in a person as that
[2:15:51] you know i seen a guy the other day
[2:15:54] he talks about about that guy but he
[2:15:56] just went up and he called him brother
[2:16:00] and told him he loved him
[2:16:10] how many times
[2:16:12] let's just go on
[2:16:15] how much easier is it to say hey you're
[2:16:18] doing me wrong you knock your teeth out
[2:16:21] that's what happens when you don't have
[2:16:23] that statue
[2:16:26] he says the church is lollying around
[2:16:29] and the church has no conscience anymore
[2:16:31] you can't hardly wake them up and it
[2:16:33] says the bible said they would come into
[2:16:35] that condition when they would say lo
[2:16:37] our lord delays is coming and they'll be
[2:16:39] devouring abiding at one another and so
[2:16:41] forth and fighting around we don't have
[2:16:43] that and
[2:16:44] we don't want that how do we keep that
[2:16:46] from happening
[2:16:48] follow the statue
[2:16:54] no doubt
[2:16:56] when this woman
[2:17:02] sees this coin missing out of her tablet
[2:17:05] it says she immediately lit a candle
[2:17:08] and she grabbed her broom
[2:17:10] brother says i think we got some people
[2:17:11] that need to light a candle and grab a
[2:17:13] broom
[2:17:15] around the message
[2:17:17] around churches
[2:17:19] because she knew what was coming so she
[2:17:21] got her can you imagine i imagine every
[2:17:23] candle in the house was burning
[2:17:26] every light in the house was on and i
[2:17:28] imagine the
[2:17:30] dust was fine as she was trying to find
[2:17:32] this coin so that she could replace it
[2:17:34] into her tablet we need people that are
[2:17:36] willing to search and fight and dig and
[2:17:39] do whatever it takes to get that stature
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:44] she sweeps the whole house out searching
[2:17:46] it with tooth and cone a fine-tooth comb
[2:17:49] i should say turning the house upside
[2:17:51] down
[2:17:52] she didn't look for it like some of us
[2:17:53] men look for things
[2:17:57] honey where's this at it's in the
[2:17:59] cabinet i don't see it
[2:18:01] it's right there on the second shelf
[2:18:03] shelf i don't see it
[2:18:06] you're looking right at it where
[2:18:12] somebody had that happen this week it
[2:18:14] looks like
[2:18:18] no she swept she was diligent she was
[2:18:21] working hard i've got to find it i've
[2:18:22] got to find it and if we as christians
[2:18:24] and believers would get that in our mind
[2:18:26] we've got to have it we've got to have
[2:18:28] it we've got to find it we've got to
[2:18:29] possess it in our in our possession
[2:18:33] our lives would be different
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:38] this woman depicts the holy spirit
[2:18:43] the holy spirit is what makes you dig
[2:18:45] and what guides us
[2:18:47] and leads us and gives us that makes us
[2:18:49] look for these things the holy spirit is
[2:18:51] what pricks our heart and says you don't
[2:18:53] have brotherly kindness
[2:18:55] the holy spirit is what pricks our heart
[2:18:57] and says you need more patience
[2:19:00] you're short with people
[2:19:02] your temper's too short your fuse is
[2:19:04] just about this long we need to lengthen
[2:19:07] it out
[2:19:08] that's the holy spirit that works and
[2:19:10] draws towards men
[2:19:14] and aren't you thankful
[2:19:17] when the holy spirit pricks your heart
[2:19:21] and you can come right back and pick up
[2:19:23] right where you left off
[2:19:26] you can find it
[2:19:28] it's sitting there waiting for you
[2:19:30] but what a lot of times people do they
[2:19:32] get away they stray or they they do some
[2:19:35] of this stuff on the statue of a perfect
[2:19:37] man they really they get out there and
[2:19:38] they're doing things
[2:19:40] that they shouldn't be doing they get it
[2:19:42] back
[2:19:43] and they're like well i'm home i'm
[2:19:45] returned
[2:19:47] that's all you ever hear of it
[2:19:49] that's not what it says she done
[2:19:52] this woman when she found this coin with
[2:19:55] virtually no value
[2:19:58] monetary it says that she found it she
[2:20:01] called her friends she called her
[2:20:03] neighbors and she said rejoice with me i
[2:20:05] have found my coin
[2:20:10] so why don't we do that find ourselves
[2:20:12] this morning begin to praise god a
[2:20:14] little bit more for the things in our
[2:20:15] lives thank you god for giving me faith
[2:20:18] thank you god for giving me patience
[2:20:20] thank you god for all the virtues thank
[2:20:23] you god for godliness because the world
[2:20:25] is missing godliness
[2:20:29] thank you god for love
[2:20:40] so that little coin
[2:20:43] we said yeah she had nine what did she
[2:20:45] need one more for
[2:20:47] had no value right we didn't determine
[2:20:49] whether it was gold silver it didn't
[2:20:51] matter what it was made of
[2:20:52] let me
[2:20:53] tell you you've got to have every one of
[2:20:56] these
[2:20:59] and one is no more valuable
[2:21:01] than the other
[2:21:05] and you say well i
[2:21:06] i know i don't have as much faith as
[2:21:08] brother so and so he can pray and stuff
[2:21:10] happens
[2:21:11] it didn't say you had to have
[2:21:13] abundant
[2:21:15] it didn't say you have to have
[2:21:17] every one of those has to be in complete
[2:21:18] perfection
[2:21:20] you just gotta have some
[2:21:23] the woman next to her all her template
[2:21:24] may have been solid 14 karat 21 karat
[2:21:27] gold
[2:21:28] and hers may have just been hand beaten
[2:21:30] silver
[2:21:31] but she had it
[2:21:35] so don't look at this and think i can
[2:21:37] never achieve it because i'm not here
[2:21:39] i don't have love i don't have enough
[2:21:41] love if you've got just an ounce of love
[2:21:44] you're on the right track
[2:21:46] keep building on it keep growing on it
[2:21:48] keep doing those things
[2:21:50] and when you get it why don't we look at
[2:21:52] this thing as we look at this whole
[2:21:54] situation this tablet and the world it's
[2:21:56] in why don't we look at this and just
[2:21:57] say well let's just have a heavenly
[2:21:59] celebration
[2:22:01] a heavenly jubilee
[2:22:09] so this morning
[2:22:12] talking about this tablet
[2:22:17] maybe you don't feel like much
[2:22:22] you don't look like much
[2:22:25] maybe you don't have a whole
[2:22:28] full row of
[2:22:29] coins in your tablet
[2:22:34] you've lost it somewhere
[2:22:37] jesus finds lost things
[2:22:42] all you've got to do is ask
[2:22:44] you see how
[2:22:46] simple it is
[2:22:49] get your broom out
[2:22:51] light your candle
[2:22:53] it may cost you a work
[2:22:55] it may cost you a little dedication it
[2:22:58] may cost you a little commitment
[2:23:00] but whatever you do don't you miss it
[2:23:03] we've determined what the hour we're
[2:23:04] living in we've determined by prophecy
[2:23:06] by scripture we're close
[2:23:10] you say well i heard that 16 20 30 years
[2:23:13] ago
[2:23:15] that means we're 30 years closer
[2:23:26] i tend to believe that
[2:23:27] when that coin
[2:23:29] fell off of her headdress
[2:23:32] off that tablet
[2:23:35] god knew exactly where it landed
[2:23:40] because god don't lose things
[2:23:42] he's not like me when i lay my keys down
[2:23:44] somewhere and i can't remember or i lay
[2:23:46] something down
[2:23:48] that's not god
[2:23:50] he finds lost things let's stand to our
[2:23:52] feet
[2:23:58] if the bible says his eye is on the
[2:24:00] sparrow
[2:24:01] he's watching over you
[2:24:04] if the bible tells us every hair of your
[2:24:07] head is counted
[2:24:09] he knows you
[2:24:12] so he knows where you are this morning
[2:24:15] i don't have to ask i don't have to make
[2:24:17] an altar call
[2:24:19] it's not necessary
[2:24:21] because you
[2:24:22] know where you stand
[2:24:24] you know the life you're living
[2:24:27] you know the hour
[2:24:29] that we're living in
[2:24:33] so you know if you need to
[2:24:35] get your light out
[2:24:37] and you know if you need to get your
[2:24:39] broom out
[2:24:41] and start cleaning house
[2:24:44] let's bow our heads
[2:24:47] heavenly father
[2:24:49] we're so thankful this morning
[2:24:52] to have a revelation
[2:24:54] of the world around us
[2:24:57] so many are roaming in darkness so many
[2:24:59] are
[2:25:01] wondering what's going to happen next so
[2:25:02] many are fearful of what's about to
[2:25:05] happen
[2:25:06] in this world
[2:25:10] but lord i
[2:25:12] i want to be like that little woman that
[2:25:15] went to searching for that coin this
[2:25:16] morning
[2:25:18] if i know there's something that's not
[2:25:20] right in my life if i know there's
[2:25:21] something that's not lining up with you
[2:25:23] and i've lost that fire i've lost that
[2:25:26] the the joy of my salvation
[2:25:29] if i've been back
[2:25:31] slit or if i've just slipped some on you
[2:25:33] lord
[2:25:35] i want to find it
[2:25:36] i want to work hard lord i want to to
[2:25:38] sweep the house clean i want to turn it
[2:25:40] upside down to be able to find that coin
[2:25:42] because whatever happens lord i need
[2:25:45] these stature
[2:25:46] on this poster behind me lord
[2:25:49] i need that statue of a perfect man i
