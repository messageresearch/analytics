[38:24] to come together to worship you and to
[38:26] speak of your word father according to
[38:28] our conscience not
[38:29] according to what somebody else would

[38:35] spirit and in truth father
[38:38] we just ask god that you would just help
[38:39] us tonight now to take advantage of this

[39:04] our hearts to speak this evening we ask
[39:06] god you

[39:08] bless your word above all father
[39:10] and we just ask god that you just bless
[39:12] each one now in the name of jesus
[39:14] christ amen amen turn of your bibles if
[39:18] you will
[39:20] we'll go to the book of romans i had a
[39:23] little thought
[39:23] and then i thought well i don't know
[39:25] about that you know
[39:27] and got to thinking on it again
[39:30] and there's just something kind of said
[39:32] yeah
[39:33] go ahead and speak on that amen so
[39:35] that's what we're going to go with
[39:37] tonight is that all right
[39:39] amen and so romans the 6th chapter
[39:45] romans 6.
[39:58] verse 16 know ye not that to whom
[40:02] ye yield yourselves servants to obey
[40:06] his servants ye are to whom ye obey
[40:09] whether of sin unto death
[40:14] or obedience unto righteousness
[40:17] but thank but god be thanked that ye
[40:19] were the servants of sin
[40:22] but ye have obeyed from the heart that
[40:23] form of doctrine which was delivered you
[40:27] being then made free from sin he became
[40:29] the servants of righteousness
[40:31] i speak after the manner of men because
[40:33] the for the infirmity of your flesh
[40:35] for as ye have yielded your members
[40:38] servants to uncleanness
[40:39] and to iniquity and unto iniquity even
[40:42] so now
[40:42] yield your members servants to
[40:44] righteousness unto holiness
[40:47] for when ye were the servants of sin you
[40:50] were free from righteousness
[40:52] what fruit had ye then in those things
[40:55] whereof ye are now ashamed
[40:57] for the end of those things is death
[41:01] but now being free from sin he became
[41:04] servants to god
[41:06] you have your fruit unto holiness and
[41:08] the end
[41:09] everlasting life for the wages of sin
[41:12] is death but the gift of god is eternal
[41:15] life through jesus christ
[41:17] our lord amen may god add his blessings
[41:20] to the reading of the words you can be
[41:21] seated
[41:22] tonight we want to talk about the wages
[41:25] of sin
[41:26] amen and you know i was just going to
[41:29] read
[41:29] chapter 16 verse 23
[41:33] for the wages of sin is death but the
[41:35] gift of god is eternal life through
[41:37] jesus christ our lord
[41:39] but don't you agree that having read
[41:41] these other scriptures it really
[41:43] clarifies just what
[41:45] paul was trying to say amen
[41:50] that's right because he first of all he
[41:51] begin to talk about how that
[41:53] you know whoever you yield yourselves
[41:56] and whoever you obey whether it's sin
[41:59] unto death because how many knows that's
[42:01] where sin leads you to
[42:02] is death or of obedience
[42:06] unto righteousness so he's going to say
[42:09] basically telling us that we're going to
[42:11] go
[42:11] two different directions amen wages of
[42:14] sin
[42:15] leads to nothing but death and the other
[42:17] one obedience leads to holiness
[42:20] leads to righteousness he clearly says
[42:22] that one of course
[42:23] is uh you know you're the servant of sin
[42:26] which is
[42:27] no doubt but the devil and evil and
[42:30] unrighteousness which leads to death and
[42:31] the other one
[42:32] makes you a servant of god unto
[42:35] righteousness amen
[42:37] and he says ye have your fruit unto
[42:40] holiness
[42:41] and the end
[42:44] everlasting life amen the wages
[42:48] of sin is death
[42:52] amen now there's three things that a
[42:56] there's a saying about sin and i'm gonna
[42:59] do a little bit of a
[43:01] class tonight would that be okay there's
[43:03] three things that sin will do
[43:05] to you all right are you all familiar
[43:08] with the phrase
[43:09] a couple of the phrases that are made
[43:11] from sin and where it takes you and so
[43:13] forth
[43:14] does anybody know any of those phrases
[43:17] raise your hand
[43:19] sister hannah anybody else no emilyn i
[43:21] don't think you know it yet but
[43:23] maybe all right you're further advanced
[43:26] and i thought your mom and dad would
[43:27] teach you if you did
[43:30] uh all right so sister hannah can you
[43:33] tell me one of the phrases about sin
[43:36] just one
[43:39] that's right okay now has anybody got
[43:42] any
[43:42] another one raise your hand
[43:48] no anybody else a sec there's three
[43:53] phrases
[43:53] go ahead josh that's good
[43:57] it'll keep you longer than what you want
[43:59] to say there's one more
[44:03] that rhymes with the stay
[44:10] there you go brother it'll cost you a
[44:13] whole lot more
[44:14] than what you want to pay so that's what
[44:16] we're going to talk about tonight amen
[44:18] talk about those three things how far
[44:20] that's in will take you
[44:22] how long that sin will keep you and
[44:25] how much it'll cost you and so i got to
[44:27] thinking about that and i said
[44:28] ah how are you going to make a message
[44:30] out of that
[44:31] anyway and then the lord just quickened
[44:33] it again says yeah that's that's good
[44:35] amen and so
[44:36] amen you you pray for me tonight is that
[44:38] all right
[44:40] and we're going to go through the
[44:41] scriptures amen and just look at some of
[44:43] these things
[44:44] amen especially now we and and we know
[44:47] that
[44:47] all unrighteousness is sin and
[44:51] i remember the prophet of god making
[44:52] this statement he said that
[44:55] you know the definition of sin means to
[44:59] anybody know it raise your hand
[45:03] sister becky no
[45:07] not exactly what i was looking for um
[45:10] sin the definition of sin
[45:13] what does it mean
[45:21] okay uh you'll probably remember
[45:22] remember a brother said that it was to
[45:24] me
[45:25] means to miss the mark it means to miss
[45:28] the mark amen in other words
[45:31] and i was thinking about this today
[45:32] about missing the mark and the bible
[45:34] talks about we pressed hard to mark for
[45:35] the prize of the high calling of god
[45:38] now let's say that and i hated to think
[45:40] about something that
[45:41] uh you know when you're when you're
[45:43] missing a mark on something to miss them
[45:46] it just reminded me the best uh analysis
[45:49] that i have of it
[45:50] would be you know shooting a bow or
[45:52] something and we're always trying to get
[45:53] that bullseye right woody we're trying
[45:55] to get it right there in that middle if
[45:56] our bow don't shoot right in that
[45:58] little black dot in the middle you know
[46:00] you know you're missing it now
[46:02] in our in our world with the deer and so
[46:04] forth while anywhere around there i'll
[46:06] probably get it but
[46:07] if you're truly a marksman and let's say
[46:09] that if he was trying to blow a bridge
[46:11] up he was trying to do something great
[46:13] and he
[46:13] had to hit just that little round thing
[46:16] before it would explode before it would
[46:17] do anything
[46:18] you know if it missed just a little bit
[46:20] it would never go off it wouldn't
[46:21] it would it would not it would do no
[46:23] good it would be absolutely null
[46:25] and void if you miss that little area
[46:28] and that's the way it is with the word
[46:30] of god am i right that if you miss
[46:32] what that bible says in that right just
[46:34] a little bit while it's a million as
[46:36] good as a million miles off
[46:38] amen and so that's means to mr mark and
[46:40] so forth but another one is analysis
[46:42] uh truly is unbelief is uh
[46:46] unbelief is to sin amen because
[46:49] that is the um uh the number one should
[46:52] we see the
[46:54] car of all sin or the sin itself
[46:57] amen is to disbelieve god's word
[47:01] amen so the first thing we know that uh
[47:04] if you
[47:06] mark 16 says go ye to all the world
[47:08] preach the gospel he that believeth and
[47:11] is baptized shall be saved and he that
[47:14] believeth not shall be damned
[47:17] so you are you know how many knows just
[47:21] think about that and how many people
[47:23] missed a mark right there
[47:25] that if you don't believe god you're
[47:27] gonna die
[47:30] if you don't believe the gospel you are
[47:31] gonna die
[47:33] and what i mean by dying i don't mean
[47:34] just take you know taking your last
[47:36] breath i'm talking about your soul
[47:38] being annihilated and becoming
[47:39] absolutely extinct
[47:41] nothing anymore in the second death that
[47:43] kind of death
[47:45] amen the soul that sinneth it shall
[47:46] surely die it'll come become annihilated
[47:49] in that lake of fire so that's what's
[47:51] going to happen to everybody
[47:52] that misses that mark amen amen and so
[47:56] uh the wages of sin the wages of all
[47:58] unbelief
[47:59] is death amen that's the ultimate death
[48:02] in them but all we know also know that
[48:03] god is commanded as many many
[48:05] commandments
[48:06] and to miss any one of those is also sin
[48:08] amen
[48:09] and now we have mistakes we have
[48:11] failures and so forth brother branham he
[48:12] makes a statement he says but
[48:14] it over in the i don't know this is just
[48:17] coming to mind i don't have this
[48:18] i haven't wrote down but we know that
[48:20] over in the book of john it says he that
[48:22] is born of god sinneth not
[48:25] for his seed remaineth in him and i
[48:27] didn't understand that for the longest
[48:29] time
[48:30] amen because he says if you're a seed of
[48:32] god you do not sin
[48:34] and i didn't understand that and the
[48:36] prophet comes along and he
[48:38] defines what unbelief is and what that
[48:40] sin that that is
[48:41] is talking about is that a son of god
[48:44] cannot
[48:45] disbelieve the word of god
[48:48] amen even before i come in the message
[48:51] even before i understood i heard
[48:52] anything about the prophet
[48:53] in my heart and my soul it was i believe
[48:55] this bible i believe it from giver to
[48:57] giver
[48:58] and i even believe the cover as the old
[49:00] black man said isn't that right
[49:01] it says the holy bible and i believe
[49:03] it's holy you know and so
[49:05] you know but that's the original that's
[49:07] the sin amen that's your actually i
[49:09] believe that's the original sin is
[49:11] unbelief
[49:12] because long before eve ever had an
[49:14] affair she didn't believe god's word
[49:16] we call adultery the original sin
[49:18] because that's what was the result for
[49:20] disbelieving of god's word
[49:21] but the original of course was disbelief
[49:24] amen
[49:26] so anyway and then what i was trying to
[49:28] say was now all
[49:30] christians and even everybody we as
[49:32] christians probably said every
[49:33] we have sins huh but we don't have sin
[49:37] and i was like well how do you explain
[49:38] that well sins is the failures that you
[49:41] have daily
[49:42] where you miss the mark daily that's
[49:44] sins failures
[49:45] men but the sin it was talking about to
[49:47] disbelieve god's word that would be
[49:49] death
[49:50] amen so we have christians have sins but
[49:52] they don't have that sin that it's
[49:53] talking about
[49:54] all right so my my my
[49:58] my we could stay here until about 12
[49:59] o'clock
[50:01] praise the lord so
[50:05] praise the lord well shall we start
[50:10] so we find out that it is it means
[50:13] to make miss the mark and
[50:16] you know let's just take a few
[50:19] characters in the bible
[50:20] and i'll at the end of the sermon
[50:23] perhaps towards the end of it
[50:24] i want to take brother branham as an
[50:26] example
[50:28] but i want to take let's just take
[50:31] oh go to first sam second samuel
[50:34] if you will how many knows that david
[50:38] was a man after god's own heart david
[50:41] was a
[50:42] mighty man of god now
[50:45] we all know this is a good thought
[50:48] we all know that god knows everything
[50:50] right before god ever picks a person
[50:53] to be a leader huh he already knows what
[50:57] that guy's going to do all the
[50:59] way through all right all the way
[51:02] through he knew
[51:04] everything that david would do
[51:07] you know right and we would ourselves
[51:09] say well if god knew david was gonna do
[51:11] what he did would he just not pick him
[51:13] huh but yet god still chose david
[51:16] to be the king he meant he was after his
[51:18] own heart and david was really a mighty
[51:21] man of god he really was
[51:22] because it was what david was in his
[51:24] heart amen
[51:27] and so we know that david
[51:31] he sinned against god isn't that right
[51:34] he sinned
[51:36] and because it says that he was
[51:41] one day after there was a big war that
[51:43] was one and so forth and
[51:44] it says that david went on the roof of
[51:46] his house
[51:47] and he saw a woman bathing
[51:52] bathsheba bathing and she was very fair
[51:55] very beautiful woman
[51:58] and david sent messengers and so forth
[52:01] and
[52:02] he went and got bathsheba and he had an
[52:05] affair with bathsheba
[52:07] and then of course that was really
[52:09] really bad
[52:12] and then bathsheba writes back and tells
[52:15] him that
[52:16] you know i'm pregnant
[52:20] and so david tries to cover up his sin
[52:22] all right
[52:23] so we see a man here sin
[52:27] taking a man now it's beginning to
[52:31] keeping him longer than he really wants
[52:32] to stay
[52:34] david perhaps wanted to have this affair
[52:36] and so forth and that was going to be it
[52:39] but guess what something happened right
[52:42] and it wasn't over yet now this thing
[52:44] isn't going gonna be over with for a
[52:45] while
[52:46] it's not gonna be over for a long time
[52:48] it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot worse
[52:50] than he ever thought and that's the way
[52:51] sin
[52:52] is how many knows that
[52:57] even the prophet said that sin is
[52:58] beautiful sin is beautiful
[53:01] few it is uh it's pleasant
[53:05] to the eyes like he said it was it was
[53:08] pleasant to the eyes and so forth and
[53:09] you know that's why sin is but it's also
[53:12] very deadly
[53:15] now the wages of sin will ultimately
[53:18] kill you and it costs you
[53:19] a whole lot more than what you ever
[53:21] really want to give it'll truly keep you
[53:23] longer than what you still want to stay
[53:26] in that right and ultimately be death or
[53:28] the gift of god is eternal life notice
[53:31] one is costs you a whole bunch and it
[53:33] ends up killing you
[53:34] the other one is a free gift it's
[53:37] totally free don't cost you nothing
[53:39] and it gives you perfect life who would
[53:41] want to
[53:42] who would not want the last one amen
[53:47] so anyway
[53:51] and then so david had to do a cover-up
[53:55] job
[53:56] he had to start to keep this thing
[53:57] covered up so what does he do
[53:59] he calls uriah home and i think his
[54:03] captain was named joab if i'm not wrong
[54:06] and so he told him to come on home you
[54:09] know and give him a report
[54:10] of how the war is going and so forth he
[54:12] gave him a report and says all right
[54:14] you're right i did a good job go to your
[54:16] house now
[54:17] go home and enjoy yourself you know
[54:21] and he send him away with the meat and
[54:24] everything you know but
[54:25] uriah just laid it at the king's
[54:27] doorstep somewhere somewhere on the
[54:28] outside he wouldn't even go home
[54:31] and he said look here's the captain
[54:33] here's your captain and
[54:34] here's the armies of israel and they are
[54:36] out there and they're in danger and
[54:38] they're in battle and they're
[54:39] fighting from my lord
[54:43] he's been enjoying my family and all of
[54:46] that i'm not going to do that not while
[54:48] he was that kind of a dedicated man i
[54:50] mean was that what uriah was a real man
[54:53] wouldn't even want any of that because
[54:55] he wanted to be at his post of duty
[54:58] that right he wouldn't go so the next
[55:00] day when they came back and told david
[55:02] said you know raya won't go he won't go
[55:04] back to his house and so forth and
[55:06] and so forth and so david
[55:10] made a feast he had a dinner with him so
[55:12] here david is
[55:13] having to have lunch
[55:18] with the man that he cheated with his
[55:20] wife
[55:22] that had to be an awkward situation
[55:26] things got awkward how many know sin
[55:27] gets awkward really weird
[55:30] strange and it says that they no doubt
[55:33] drank a bunch of wine because it says
[55:35] that david got him grown
[55:37] he says i'll get him drunk and then
[55:38] he'll go home you know he got drunk but
[55:40] he still went and laid in the same place
[55:42] he was the same kind of man drunker's
[55:43] over
[55:45] huh so then
[55:48] david tries his best he said i got to
[55:51] cover this thing up harman knows you
[55:52] don't cover anything up
[55:55] now be sure that your sins will find you
[55:58] out
[56:00] he'll find you out and
[56:03] so then he does what does david do he
[56:05] says all right this ain't gonna work
[56:06] he ain't gonna go so i'm gonna send him
[56:08] back and david pens her letter
[56:11] and told his captain he says you know i
[56:12] want you to go up close to the city
[56:14] and i want you to take put him up in the
[56:16] worst the best of the enemies
[56:19] fighters take a group up to the best of
[56:21] the enemies fighters
[56:22] and then withdraw him so that he'll get
[56:24] killed direct orders
[56:26] and he seals the envelope and who does
[56:29] he give it
[56:30] to to take back
[56:33] uriah uriah
[56:37] carries his death sentence
[56:40] back to the captain
[56:44] that was pretty bad that was terrible
[56:47] see folks you'll get in deeper
[56:50] than what you want to get in it'll keep
[56:53] you
[56:54] longer than you want to stay
[56:58] amen and it'll take you further than
[57:01] what you want to go
[57:02] keep you in that place longer than you
[57:04] want to stay
[57:07] so he goes back and he gives the captain
[57:11] the paper the envelope the envelope he
[57:13] does exactly what david says
[57:15] uriah gets killed is that right
[57:18] iran gets killed and his wife
[57:21] finds out that your eyes dead and she
[57:23] mourns for a little while and right
[57:25] after she mourns and it's done with the
[57:26] morning time
[57:30] david sends after her and brings her
[57:31] into his house and marries her
[57:34] she becomes his wife all this all he's
[57:37] well
[57:38] huh david thought always well
[57:41] but all was not well i imagine david
[57:45] didn't feel so good right then do you
[57:48] couldn't feel so good having to give
[57:50] uriah get your eye in the eyes
[57:53] and here's a paper maybe he had some no
[57:56] doubt he had somebody else do it
[57:58] but he was still his doing amen
[58:01] it was still his doing amen
[58:05] one to another to cover it up to cover
[58:07] it up just couldn't cover it up
[58:09] so guess what he thought he had gotten
[58:11] away with it but god told nathan
[58:13] isn't that right go to david and tell
[58:15] him a little story
[58:17] about how that there was one rich man
[58:19] and one poor one had herds and flocks
[58:21] and so forth
[58:22] and this rich man got a friend to come
[58:24] in
[58:25] some company to come in and he went and
[58:26] got that poor man's little lamb
[58:29] hello he said he slept with the lamb
[58:32] and the lamb drank out of his cup
[58:36] in other words they did everything
[58:37] together he didn't mind licking the
[58:39] little lamb schlava
[58:40] he was set in love with his little lamb
[58:45] out of his cup ate up and slept with him
[58:47] oh my just this was all it was just
[58:49] oh my you know but he went and got that
[58:52] one
[58:54] and let me see if i can find the
[58:55] scriptures
[58:59] yeah and david's anger was greatly
[59:03] killed and kindled against the man and
[59:05] he said he
[59:06] shall surely die
[59:10] huh that's what david said he shall
[59:14] surely die
[59:17] see nathan caught david off hard
[59:22] david was the king he was for righteous
[59:24] he was doing things and so forth but
[59:25] he had something that he had done and he
[59:28] told this story and he wanted his
[59:30] judgment on it
[59:31] and then nathan says david
[59:37] thou art the man and thus saith the lord
[59:41] god of israel i anointed the king over
[59:44] israel i delivered thee out of the hand
[59:46] of saul
[59:47] and i gave thee my thy master's house
[59:50] and a master's wives unto thy bosom
[59:53] and gave thee the house of israel and of
[59:55] judah and if that had been too little
[59:57] i would moreover have given these such
[1:00:01] and such things oh my
[1:00:05] how many notes when you sin against god
[1:00:06] you're gonna cut yourself short
[1:00:09] god's gonna cut off some of the things
[1:00:10] that he would have given you
[1:00:13] have got so much more if you wouldn't
[1:00:16] have fallen into sin
[1:00:20] are you with me tonight i would have
[1:00:22] given you more
[1:00:26] wherefore has thou despised the
[1:00:28] commandment of the lord
[1:00:29] to do evil in his sight that has killed
[1:00:33] uriah the hittite with the sword and has
[1:00:35] taken his wife to be thy wife
[1:00:37] and has slain him with the sword of the
[1:00:39] children of heaven
[1:00:41] amen in other words he's you know
[1:00:44] now therefore here's your punishment
[1:00:47] it'll cost him a lot more than what he
[1:00:49] wants to pay
[1:00:50] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:00:53] depart
[1:00:53] from thy house in other words you're
[1:00:56] never going to have
[1:00:57] a moment's peace in your lifetime
[1:01:04] it'll keep you a whole lot longer than
[1:01:07] what you want to stay
[1:01:11] a lifetime many times i can show you
[1:01:14] where
[1:01:15] it's for a lifetime amen
[1:01:18] because god has despised me and has
[1:01:20] taken the wife of uriah the hittite
[1:01:23] to be thy wife thus saith the lord
[1:01:25] behold i will raise up evil
[1:01:27] against thee out of that own house there
[1:01:29] is the first one
[1:01:30] how many knows absalon and oh my he had
[1:01:33] a big division
[1:01:34] his kingdom was divided for a while
[1:01:37] it was terrible terrible things david
[1:01:39] went through
[1:01:40] all that things that he suffered he had
[1:01:42] time to reflect
[1:01:44] and think about what he had done it was
[1:01:47] costing him
[1:01:50] dearly amen
[1:01:52] in the end if the world would just
[1:01:54] realize if everybody would just realize
[1:01:57] sin isn't worth it
[1:02:01] it's just not worth it
[1:02:06] for what little pleasure whatever little
[1:02:08] it might give you
[1:02:09] the torment that comes with it it's
[1:02:11] never worth it
[1:02:14] you sow to the wind and you reap a
[1:02:17] whirlwind
[1:02:18] i remember and i've said it before here
[1:02:20] brother brahm says watch anybody's life
[1:02:22] whatever you sow you're gonna reap
[1:02:25] with whatever measure you might it shall
[1:02:27] be measured to you again with whatever
[1:02:29] judgment you judged you will be judged
[1:02:32] blessed are in a merciful for they up
[1:02:34] shall obtain mercy
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:39] out of that known house and i will take
[1:02:41] thy wives before thine
[1:02:42] eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and
[1:02:44] he shall lie with thy wives
[1:02:46] in the sight of the sun for thou ditched
[1:02:50] it secretly but i will do this thing
[1:02:52] before all israel and before the son
[1:02:56] and david said unto nathan i have sinned
[1:02:58] against the lord and nathan said unto
[1:03:00] david
[1:03:01] amen the lord hath put away
[1:03:04] thyles thy sin thou shalt not
[1:03:08] die so did the lord forgive david
[1:03:11] yes he did he forgave david otherwise
[1:03:14] he'd have been a dead man
[1:03:17] but he was going to get punished for it
[1:03:19] remember another place
[1:03:20] i think it was whenever he numbered
[1:03:22] israel that right
[1:03:24] and he says no david you shouldn't have
[1:03:26] done that now how do you want to be
[1:03:28] punished
[1:03:28] do you want the enemy to take over you
[1:03:30] and defeat you at battle so long or
[1:03:32] do you want to do this that or the other
[1:03:34] but i think was a plague that he
[1:03:36] said just let a plague strike thousands
[1:03:39] upon thousands upon thousands of people
[1:03:41] died
[1:03:43] because of his sin
[1:03:46] it's costly sin is very
[1:03:49] costly amen
[1:03:54] thou shalt not doubt shalt surely
[1:03:57] not die amen
[1:04:03] it's astounding amen
[1:04:06] all right let's go to another one shall
[1:04:10] we i want to go to saul
[1:04:13] first samuel
[1:04:16] first samuel 16.
[1:04:29] let's go to 15 first now saul was a
[1:04:32] different kind of a character
[1:04:34] saul was a little like
[1:04:38] brother branham's friends that went
[1:04:40] hunting
[1:04:43] and you know brother brandon the
[1:04:44] characteristic of brother branham is he
[1:04:46] loved to shoot guns and go to the range
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:49] he could drive tax with the 22 nine
[1:04:52] times straight
[1:04:53] the same bullet in the same hole
[1:04:56] that's what he liked to do right
[1:05:00] he liked to do that he was in one time
[1:05:02] they were just scattering everywhere and
[1:05:03] boy he was
[1:05:04] tore up nervous and don't understand why
[1:05:06] what was going on
[1:05:08] even was crying why can i get anything
[1:05:10] on
[1:05:12] i'd like me brother woody i can't get
[1:05:14] that message to shoot right i just guess
[1:05:16] i gotta buy a new bow
[1:05:19] all i need is to stick one arrow one
[1:05:21] deer why spend a thousand dollars on
[1:05:22] that well
[1:05:23] just one good shots all i need but me
[1:05:25] you know how it is you want something
[1:05:26] new
[1:05:27] you get frustrated you want you want
[1:05:28] that perfect shot
[1:05:31] man oh my but he was that way he wanted
[1:05:35] to he wanted that
[1:05:36] perfect shot and then he was squirrel
[1:05:38] hunting one time and he was
[1:05:40] out there hunting and he was waiting on
[1:05:41] squirrels to come and they wouldn't come
[1:05:43] at the right place and he was tr
[1:05:44] you know and i think he missed one shoot
[1:05:47] him right in the
[1:05:48] eyes i had to be at 50 yards where he
[1:05:50] don't shoot
[1:05:51] and then when he's at that yardage you
[1:05:53] know he puts him right in the eye just
[1:05:54] takes him right out
[1:05:55] he says they're friends down there you
[1:05:58] know they got a bunch of squirrels
[1:06:00] he only hadn't got any you know but they
[1:06:02] were down there and they would
[1:06:04] they didn't care where they hit it i
[1:06:06] don't know that they didn't have
[1:06:07] shotguns but you don't mean
[1:06:09] there goes the squirrel with a shot boom
[1:06:12] yeah i got it we all pick out the
[1:06:14] bullets later
[1:06:16] that's kind of you know just just kind
[1:06:18] of half shot just hit him anywhere he
[1:06:20] says you know
[1:06:21] that's fine with them that's how saul
[1:06:24] was
[1:06:26] saul thought that he could come close to
[1:06:27] hitting and it'd be good enough
[1:06:30] is that right i don't want to go too
[1:06:34] long on this but
[1:06:37] i'll read it before i read this other
[1:06:39] let me just say this
[1:06:41] so we know that the amalekites
[1:06:45] god had sent saul on his first mission
[1:06:47] to go down to the malachites
[1:06:49] to kill the king of ag and to wipe them
[1:06:51] all out man woman and child
[1:06:53] animals sheep oxen everything wipe it
[1:06:56] all out
[1:06:57] now he did it and then
[1:07:00] paul ended up bringing a gag back he let
[1:07:03] the people take some some moments of
[1:07:04] some of the spoils
[1:07:05] they brought sheep back to sacrifice to
[1:07:08] the lord and all those type of things
[1:07:10] they didn't do exactly what god had said
[1:07:13] to do
[1:07:17] amen i think this is a good lesson for
[1:07:20] all of us
[1:07:21] that's the way each and every one of us
[1:07:23] should be lord help me to do exactly
[1:07:25] what your word
[1:07:26] said to do not pretty close or about or
[1:07:30] it's good enough
[1:07:31] no let's not be that way god's not
[1:07:34] pleased with that
[1:07:36] he wants us to do just what he asks us
[1:07:38] to do
[1:07:45] why sometimes god would take and he
[1:07:46] would destroy a whole nation like that
[1:07:48] about this
[1:07:49] wipe them all out kill every last man
[1:07:51] woman and child
[1:07:53] and he had some might have said man
[1:07:55] that's kind of
[1:07:56] ruthless isn't it
[1:08:00] isn't that kind of extreme they refused
[1:08:04] so god don't say well i try to figure
[1:08:06] out why no just do what i ask you to do
[1:08:09] mean like the men of nineveh isn't that
[1:08:10] right give them a warning god is fair
[1:08:15] you know but anyway like i said it's a
[1:08:18] thought
[1:08:19] so anyway god tells
[1:08:24] samuel that he repenteth him that i have
[1:08:25] set saul up to be king for he has turned
[1:08:27] his back from following me
[1:08:29] has not performed my commandment and he
[1:08:31] grieved samuel and he cried unto the
[1:08:32] lord all night
[1:08:33] and when samuel rose up early i'm sorry
[1:08:36] chapter 15
[1:08:37] verse 12 is where i'm at
[1:08:40] first samuel and when samuel rose up
[1:08:43] early to meet saul in the morning he was
[1:08:45] told samuel saying saul came to cam
[1:08:47] camel and behold he has set up a place
[1:08:50] and he's gone about and passed on going
[1:08:51] to gilgal
[1:08:52] and samuel came to saul and saul said
[1:08:55] unto him
[1:08:56] blessed be thou of the lord i have
[1:08:58] performed
[1:09:00] the commandment of the lord
[1:09:03] had he commanded had he done it
[1:09:06] and samuel said then what meaneth
[1:09:09] this bleeding bleeding of the sheep in
[1:09:12] my ears
[1:09:13] and the lowing of the oxens which i have
[1:09:17] which i hear in other words i shouldn't
[1:09:20] be hearing the oxen
[1:09:22] i shouldn't be hearing the sheep what is
[1:09:24] all this done if you commit obey the
[1:09:25] commandment of the lord
[1:09:32] i don't know about you but i think we
[1:09:33] should all search our hearts and say why
[1:09:34] is this in my life
[1:09:36] what's this going on why am i like i am
[1:09:39] huh maybe i haven't command obeyed every
[1:09:42] command like i should
[1:09:45] maybe that's why
[1:09:48] first he thinks he did then he down in
[1:09:52] verse 22 let's just jump up a little bit
[1:09:58] and samuel said has the lord as great
[1:10:00] delight in burnt offerings and
[1:10:01] sacrifices
[1:10:03] as in obeying the voice of the lord
[1:10:05] behold to obey
[1:10:07] is better than sacrifice amen and to
[1:10:10] hearken
[1:10:11] than the fat of rams
[1:10:15] for rebellion is at the sin of
[1:10:17] witchcraft and stubbornness is as the
[1:10:19] iniquity and idolatry
[1:10:21] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:10:23] the lord he also has rejected thee
[1:10:26] from being king amen what
[1:10:30] a cost think about it
[1:10:34] saul never got a second chance god never
[1:10:38] gave all a second chance
[1:10:40] first time he messed up like that he
[1:10:41] says that's it because god knew what was
[1:10:43] on saul's heart and how he was
[1:10:45] because you've done this you have been
[1:10:46] rejected
[1:10:50] being
[1:10:55] amen that's a pretty costly
[1:10:58] price for some sheep
[1:11:02] and some oxen
[1:11:06] an egg that he kept alive also and a gay
[1:11:09] come up to samuel and says
[1:11:10] oh is there not enough death now is the
[1:11:13] stenches the horribleness of death
[1:11:16] past now and samuel
[1:11:20] talk about chopping somebody up folks it
[1:11:22] just got ruthless in the old testament
[1:11:24] how many knows
[1:11:24] it was some ruthless times we're talking
[1:11:26] about genocide we're talking about
[1:11:28] hacking people to pieces it's just that
[1:11:30] he told a
[1:11:31] he says as you have made many a woman a
[1:11:34] widow
[1:11:35] all right and many a child many a mother
[1:11:38] childless i believe it was
[1:11:40] so your mother will be childless today
[1:11:43] and i can just see it now samuel taking
[1:11:45] some hatchet and tacking that guy all
[1:11:47] the pieces
[1:11:49] that's how you obey god do what he says
[1:11:52] amen and then saul says please come
[1:11:56] and stand before the congregation me and
[1:11:58] bless me and all this
[1:11:59] said i ain't he begin to walk away
[1:12:01] samuel lit and
[1:12:02] saul grabbed the hem of his skirt and it
[1:12:04] ripped
[1:12:06] that right and he says as you have torn
[1:12:08] this so is your kingdom ripped
[1:12:10] from you and given to your neighbor
[1:12:13] somebody
[1:12:14] better than you
[1:12:18] sting right a real sting somebody that's
[1:12:21] better than you
[1:12:25] i don't bend my glasses crooked so if
[1:12:28] you're on me crooked forgive me
[1:12:30] okay and if you'll notice in chapter 16
[1:12:33] to go on
[1:12:34] it says but the spirit of the lord
[1:12:36] departed from saul
[1:12:38] and a evil spirit from the lord troubled
[1:12:42] him
[1:12:43] not me knows this spirit never did leave
[1:12:46] saul it always came
[1:12:48] and it haunted him the rest of his days
[1:12:52] i thought man aren't you glad that when
[1:12:54] you catch a spirit that torments you a
[1:12:57] spirit that just
[1:12:58] man it drags down makes you feel
[1:13:00] horrible wouldn't it be terrible if god
[1:13:02] would allow that
[1:13:03] to stay on you forever
[1:13:07] that would be good would it we all know
[1:13:10] what that is
[1:13:12] but saul was that way god sent a bad
[1:13:14] spirit on him to torment him
[1:13:18] and he had that tormenting spirit all of
[1:13:20] his days
[1:13:22] and he had to have music played to
[1:13:24] soothe his spirit
[1:13:25] and to calm that spirit he had to have a
[1:13:28] musician
[1:13:29] and guess who was choking
[1:13:32] david let me ask you did that music do
[1:13:36] any good
[1:13:37] one place and it says that yeah it
[1:13:39] calmed him but next time he was playing
[1:13:41] what did saul do
[1:13:42] that spirit still jumped on him he
[1:13:44] grabbed the javelin over
[1:13:46] on the side and he flung it even as hard
[1:13:49] as he could
[1:13:50] he was going to spear him to the wall
[1:13:52] paul had a bad attitude
[1:13:55] saul had a bad spirit on it was a
[1:13:58] horrible spirit
[1:13:59] why because he was jealous of david
[1:14:02] when they sang about oh saul has killed
[1:14:04] his thousands
[1:14:07] a saul has killed his thousands
[1:14:12] but david is tens of thousands
[1:14:18] didn't they sing yeah they mean
[1:14:20] something about david tell them who
[1:14:22] they saw was like i hate that guy
[1:14:28] oh he hated david because he was a
[1:14:30] better man
[1:14:31] he had mistakes he had failures he was a
[1:14:34] human being
[1:14:35] amen once brother baby said that
[1:14:39] really david's fault the
[1:14:43] woman should have not been anywhere
[1:14:46] bathing where everybody could see her
[1:14:48] isn't that right she would do she could
[1:14:51] have seen herself
[1:14:51] covered stayed inside take a bath
[1:14:56] amen it's just what he said
[1:14:59] but david should have still resisted
[1:15:01] shouldn't he that's right
[1:15:03] he had to go through a lot of jumps he
[1:15:06] had to go through a lot of hoops
[1:15:07] and david still tried to cover it up a
[1:15:09] lot but it
[1:15:10] covered something up and you've got
[1:15:12] something away with but how many knows
[1:15:14] you're not gonna get away with it he
[1:15:17] says the day will come that hour will
[1:15:18] come that all that was done in darkness
[1:15:20] and secret
[1:15:21] all will be made manifest everything's
[1:15:23] going to be made manifest
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:30] so that's so lo thank the lord that
[1:15:34] god can we can go down to prayer say
[1:15:37] lord jesus
[1:15:38] help me help me if you gotta
[1:15:42] torment you oh my thank god for
[1:15:45] repentance
[1:15:46] the holy spirit
[1:15:50] amen that can come back and hey
[1:15:55] heart amen
[1:15:59] oh my let me see
[1:16:02] there's so many
[1:16:08] but let's take another one let's go to
[1:16:13] aegin in joshua 7.
[1:16:16] joshua 7. how many knows aiken was
[1:16:18] aching for or breaking
[1:16:20] because he had taken something that
[1:16:22] didn't belong to him
[1:16:25] amen aiken trans god
[1:16:29] 18 and he caused the death of i think 36
[1:16:32] men
[1:16:34] that right they had the greatest
[1:16:37] victory over jericho right
[1:16:41] not even a band-aid nobody even got a
[1:16:43] little scratch
[1:16:44] didn't even need a band-aid box
[1:16:47] all right and they took jericho took the
[1:16:50] whole city
[1:16:51] by simply going around at seven times
[1:16:53] blowing the trumpets the wall fell and
[1:16:54] they surrendered
[1:16:57] the next time but utterly destroy
[1:17:00] don't take nothing out of it and guess
[1:17:03] what aiken got down in there and he
[1:17:05] found some go a gold
[1:17:06] wet this chunk brother brad this chalk's
[1:17:10] big enough
[1:17:11] that i never gonna have to work again it
[1:17:13] was his retirement

[1:17:31] wagon
[1:17:32] hey son come over here help me grab this
[1:17:34] thing and put it over there i know just
[1:17:35] how big it was but
[1:17:37] it was big enough to cost him a lot more
[1:17:40] and he wanted to pay
[1:17:44] and as far as keeping him to stay it was
[1:17:47] forever
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:52] so how many knows after the 36 died
[1:17:56] they said sanctify we got to figure out
[1:17:58] who it is they went from tribe to tribe
[1:18:00] to you know down all the way down to
[1:18:02] families and it came the agent
[1:18:06] and it showed that it was j aiken and
[1:18:09] joshua said unto ache in verse 19 of
[1:18:12] joshua 7 joshua 7 19
[1:18:16] and joshua said unto achan my son give i
[1:18:18] pray thee glory to the lord god of
[1:18:20] israel
[1:18:22] and make confession unto thee unto
[1:18:25] me now what thou has done hide it not
[1:18:28] from me
[1:18:28] and achan answered joshua and said
[1:18:31] indeed
[1:18:34] i have sinned against the lord god of
[1:18:36] israel
[1:18:37] and thus have i done and what i saw
[1:18:40] among this was a goodly guard
[1:18:42] a bible ownish garment and 200 shekels
[1:18:45] of silver
[1:18:46] and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weight
[1:18:50] then i coveted them amen
[1:18:53] how many knows that covetousness bible
[1:18:55] says thou shalt not
[1:18:56] covet
[1:19:00] and took them and behold they are hidden
[1:19:01] in the earth in the midst of the tent
[1:19:03] and the silver under it and so joshua
[1:19:04] sent messengers
[1:19:08] tent and the silver under it
[1:19:11] and they took them out of the midst of
[1:19:13] the tent and brought them unto joshua
[1:19:15] and unto all the children of israel
[1:19:17] and laid them out before the lord and
[1:19:19] joshua and all israel with him
[1:19:21] took aitkin the son of sarah
[1:19:25] zebra and the silver and the garments
[1:19:29] the wedge of gold his sons his daughters
[1:19:33] his oxen his asses his sheep his tent
[1:19:36] and all that he had and he brought them
[1:19:40] unto the valley of achar
[1:19:42] and joshua said why hast thou troubled
[1:19:45] us
[1:19:45] the lord shall trouble thee this day
[1:19:49] and all israel stoned him with stones
[1:19:52] and burned them with fire
[1:19:54] after that they had stoned him with
[1:19:56] stones amen
[1:19:58] and they raised a heap of stones unto
[1:20:00] this day so the lord turned from the
[1:20:02] fears
[1:20:02] of his anger wherefore the name of that
[1:20:04] place is called the valley of a car
[1:20:07] unto this day
[1:20:10] my my my think about aiken having to
[1:20:13] look over at his wife
[1:20:16] honey boys children servants
[1:20:20] i'm sorry i shouldn't have done it
[1:20:25] it's going to cost all of you your lives
[1:20:29] you're all going to get stoned to death
[1:20:31] gonna throw rocks at your head and your
[1:20:32] body until
[1:20:33] you are dead and then they're gonna burn
[1:20:37] this with fire
[1:20:38] and put it all on the heap and put a big
[1:20:40] old pile of rocks
[1:20:42] see folks cost a whole lot more than
[1:20:46] what again
[1:20:47] would have wanted to pay if he had
[1:20:49] thought about that if he didn't know
[1:20:50] what was coming right
[1:20:52] he just says
[1:20:56] don't you dare son pick up one sliver of
[1:20:58] that silver
[1:21:00] don't you take that babylonian garment
[1:21:02] don't take don't touch that
[1:21:04] i guarantee you if every one of us
[1:21:06] realize hey that's what
[1:21:09] sin is stay as far away from unless you
[1:21:12] can
[1:21:14] because it'll only lead to death and
[1:21:17] sorrow
[1:21:18] amen that's exactly right
[1:21:23] aiken was aching for a break-in
[1:21:26] and certainly that's what happened his
[1:21:29] wife his children
[1:21:30] all of them weeping crying having to pay
[1:21:33] the price
[1:21:36] it took him further than they wanted to
[1:21:37] go kept them longer they wanted to stay
[1:21:41] and cost them everything
[1:21:45] another one number 16
[1:21:54] nathan and korra
[1:22:07] nathan and korah
[1:22:12] they gathered themselves together in
[1:22:13] chapter 16 of numbers
[1:22:16] they rose up before moses with with
[1:22:18] certain of the children of israel
[1:22:19] 250 princes of the assembly
[1:22:23] famous in the congregation
[1:22:26] well-known men people that were
[1:22:30] of high standing high regard 250 of them
[1:22:35] nathan and korra got to side with them
[1:22:38] and they gathered themselves together
[1:22:40] against
[1:22:41] moses and against aaron and said unto
[1:22:44] them
[1:22:45] he take too much upon you seeing that
[1:22:47] all the congregation
[1:22:49] are holy every one of them and the lord
[1:22:52] is among them
[1:22:52] wherefore lift ye up yourselves
[1:22:56] above the congregation of the lord
[1:23:00] amen might not look like a very big sin
[1:23:06] huh just to say look all the
[1:23:08] congregation is why do you put yourself
[1:23:10] up over everybody
[1:23:13] why do you have to be the big shot huh
[1:23:16] we want to be big shots too he can talk
[1:23:19] to us too
[1:23:22] um see the problem is is when you talk
[1:23:26] against the lord
[1:23:28] something that the lord is doing now if
[1:23:30] it's not the lord not the lord
[1:23:32] you ain't gonna worry about it but if
[1:23:33] it's the lord
[1:23:36] and his doing that's who you're dealing
[1:23:39] with
[1:23:39] you're dealing with god they made a big
[1:23:43] big mistake amen
[1:23:48] moses heard it he realized how bad it
[1:23:51] was that he fell on his face
[1:23:53] isn't that right and he said we'll see
[1:23:56] who's holy
[1:23:57] and who's righteous and he says take
[1:23:58] your fire put incenses on it and whole
[1:24:02] all of that
[1:24:05] and we're not going to
[1:24:09] read all of that what he did but in
[1:24:11] challenging him see who is right
[1:24:13] who's wrong but in chapter and verse 19
[1:24:15] of the same chapter
[1:24:17] and korah gathered all the congregation
[1:24:19] against against them
[1:24:21] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:24:23] congregation and the glory of the lord
[1:24:25] appeared unto all the congregation and
[1:24:27] the lord spake unto moses and to aaron
[1:24:29] saying
[1:24:30] separate yourself from among this
[1:24:33] congregation
[1:24:34] that i may consume them in a moment
[1:24:39] how many knows god wanted to
[1:24:42] take him out in a second
[1:24:48] god was pretty mad what we call angry
[1:24:51] that's right he was pretty angry he says
[1:24:54] just separate yourself
[1:24:56] and i will wipe them out in a second
[1:24:59] god could have done it
[1:25:04] and they fell on their faces and said oh
[1:25:07] god the god of the spirits of all flesh
[1:25:09] shall
[1:25:09] one man sin and will thou not and will
[1:25:12] thou be wrath with the whole
[1:25:13] congregation
[1:25:15] huh in other words
[1:25:18] moses was standing in the gap in that
[1:25:20] right he was
[1:25:21] playing the part of jesus christ for
[1:25:23] mankind because certainly we look at
[1:25:25] mankind and
[1:25:26] they certainly deserve to be taken out
[1:25:28] in a moment
[1:25:30] but moses says look give him a chance
[1:25:33] give him a chance
[1:25:35] just because somebody does that don't
[1:25:37] take them all out
[1:25:40] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:25:41] okay go ahead and speak unto the
[1:25:43] congregation and tell them
[1:25:45] get you up from about this tabernacle of
[1:25:47] corn nathan
[1:25:48] in a byram get you away from them
[1:25:51] and moses rose up and went unto nathan
[1:25:54] and byram and
[1:25:55] the elders of israel followed him and he
[1:25:58] spake unto the congregation saying
[1:25:59] depart i pray you from the tents of
[1:26:01] these wicked men
[1:26:03] and touch nothing of theirs least ye be
[1:26:05] consumed
[1:26:06] in all of their sins
[1:26:10] so they got him up from the tabernacle
[1:26:12] of korra and ethan abay ram and
[1:26:14] every side and dathan and byram came out
[1:26:16] and stood in the door of their tents and
[1:26:18] their wives and their sons and their
[1:26:20] childrens
[1:26:21] and moses said hereby shall you know
[1:26:23] that the lord has sent me
[1:26:24] to do all these works for i have not
[1:26:27] done them
[1:26:28] of my own how many beliefs that's so
[1:26:30] important
[1:26:31] it's not something that you do as a
[1:26:33] human is something that the god does
[1:26:38] and if they be visited like all of his
[1:26:41] men are visited
[1:26:42] then says the lord not sent me but if
[1:26:44] the lord make a new thing in the earth
[1:26:47] open her mouth and swallow them up with
[1:26:50] all that are pertains unto them
[1:26:52] and they go down into the quick into the
[1:26:55] pit
[1:26:56] then tell you
[1:27:02] and it came to pass as he had made an
[1:27:05] end of the speaking stop right there
[1:27:06] let's go back for a minute
[1:27:07] if you'll note notice that
[1:27:13] it says verse 26 i believe it is
[1:27:18] he spake to the congregation said depart
[1:27:20] i pray you from the tents of these
[1:27:21] wicked men and touch not there at least
[1:27:23] you be consumed with their
[1:27:24] so they get up from the tabernacle so
[1:27:27] most of the people from the sounds of it
[1:27:29] actually left left him
[1:27:32] they actually got out of there how many
[1:27:34] knows when you know something's wrong
[1:27:36] get out of there anything that's wrong
[1:27:38] get out of there
[1:27:40] get away from it amen
[1:27:43] and nathan and bioram came out in
[1:27:45] citizens for us okay now
[1:27:46] now notice back up here so most of them
[1:27:48] left
[1:27:50] came over to moses verse 31 and it came
[1:27:54] to pass as he had made an end of
[1:27:55] speaking all these words to the ground
[1:27:57] clave asunder
[1:27:59] that was under them and the earth
[1:28:03] opened up her mouth and swallowed
[1:28:06] them up their houses and all the men
[1:28:10] that are pertained unto korah and all
[1:28:12] their goods
[1:28:14] they and everything that are pertained
[1:28:17] to them went down
[1:28:18] alive into the pit and the earth closed
[1:28:22] upon them
[1:28:23] and they perished from among the
[1:28:25] congregation
[1:28:27] that was one time they should have kept
[1:28:28] the mouth shut
[1:28:31] and realized hey god has chosen
[1:28:34] moses to be the leader he doesn't need
[1:28:37] no input
[1:28:38] brother bran said that these guys were
[1:28:40] trying to make a denomination
[1:28:43] that's what denominations are
[1:28:45] denominations are something
[1:28:47] outside of the will of god something
[1:28:49] that god didn't appoint
[1:28:50] god didn't choose man made it
[1:28:54] amen you can go all through the bible
[1:28:57] all down through you can find
[1:28:58] denominations denominations
[1:29:00] man-made denominations amen
[1:29:05] oh we're not done yet are you ready
[1:29:07] everybody awake yet
[1:29:09] got another 10 minutes
[1:29:13] and all israel that were round about
[1:29:16] them fled
[1:29:16] at the cry of i don't know about you but
[1:29:19] i can almost hear the screams
[1:29:22] as they go into a bottomless pit as the
[1:29:24] earth swallows them up perhaps right
[1:29:26] down straight to that lava i don't know
[1:29:29] but they went right straight hit it says
[1:29:31] pit
[1:29:32] isn't that right go down quick
[1:29:36] into the pit
[1:29:39] screaming and hollering moms children's
[1:29:42] little children little girls
[1:29:44] little boys this is a little strong for
[1:29:47] our young ones maybe
[1:29:48] but anyway y'all need to learn sooner or
[1:29:51] later
[1:29:52] that you really want to obey god and do
[1:29:55] what god says
[1:29:56] amen
[1:30:01] for fled for the cry of them in other
[1:30:03] words i can see the crowd running away
[1:30:05] just going out into the woods and
[1:30:06] running from that place let me get away
[1:30:08] from here
[1:30:10] am i right for they said least yours
[1:30:13] swallow
[1:30:14] us up also now let me ask you this there
[1:30:18] was some the 250 men apparently
[1:30:20] didn't go down in the pit 250 apparently
[1:30:25] stayed above but read with me on
[1:30:29] verse 35
[1:30:32] after the earth is closed and everything
[1:30:34] else and there came a fire
[1:30:37] from the lord came out a fire from the
[1:30:39] lord
[1:30:40] and consumed the 250 men
[1:30:44] that offered incense that weren't called
[1:30:47] to burn incense they thought they could
[1:30:50] but they weren't called to it
[1:30:52] amen it says it consumed them
[1:30:55] folks i don't know about you but seeing
[1:30:56] that many come out
[1:30:58] that happening would be quite something
[1:31:02] so then there was a peace offering made
[1:31:05] and all these other things right
[1:31:07] want to find out what happened next
[1:31:09] morning
[1:31:11] next morning okay
[1:31:15] after a memorial i guess
[1:31:19] verse 41 says but on tomorrow all the
[1:31:22] children
[1:31:23] all the congregation of the children of
[1:31:25] israel
[1:31:26] murmured against moses hello
[1:31:30] they were still not happy with god's
[1:31:33] leader
[1:31:36] even after god vindicated and proved him
[1:31:38] in that way
[1:31:39] they were still not happy with him how
[1:31:42] many knows that the children of israel
[1:31:44] they were the murmurous bunch you ever

[1:33:51] that these people realize that the cost
[1:33:54] of sin is not worth it

[1:34:02] pit thought boy oh boy i should have
[1:34:05] never thought that
[1:34:07] huh i should have never opened my mouth
[1:34:10] why couldn't i just be happy following
[1:34:12] what god has ordered
[1:34:16] but it was too late terrible
[1:34:19] price to pay and stay
[1:34:23] forever
[1:34:31] folks let me tell you something god
[1:34:33] didn't have mercy for you
[1:34:34] and for me every day we'd be in the same
[1:34:37] day
[1:34:39] god didn't forgive us of our failures
[1:34:40] and our sins we'd be in a pit
[1:34:43] we'd have a evil spirit on us we'd be
[1:34:46] worthy of death
[1:34:49] but i thank god he don't kill us he may
[1:34:52] punish us let me tell you something you
[1:34:53] backslide
[1:34:54] you get away from god you don't obey you

[1:34:59] not a dodie grandpa like me
[1:35:04] oh my that's right he just has children
[1:35:09] not grandchildren and he does punish but
[1:35:12] he doesn't kill
[1:35:14] that punishment most of the time is
[1:35:15] correction how many knows
[1:35:17] whom he loves he chases corrects
[1:35:21] chastises rebukes you don't just let
[1:35:23] your child say
[1:35:25] every time he does something wrong sorry
[1:35:28] sister natalie your children say sorry
[1:35:30] mommy mommy and you say
[1:35:32] that's okay all right you asked
[1:35:34] forgiveness
[1:35:35] and he does it again oh that's okay you

[1:35:40] right michelle and woody y'all do you
[1:35:43] forgive him every time
[1:35:45] hey once in a while you had a
[1:35:46] forgiveness
[1:35:49] you get grace can't no whip in this time
[1:35:52] but the next time it's whipping
[1:35:54] and all right sure there's some great
[1:35:56] there
[1:36:00] and a lot of times it's look i'll tell
[1:36:02] you what i'm going to have mercy on you
[1:36:04] instead of 15 we're going to make a 7
[1:36:06] wax

[1:36:17] sorry
[1:36:17] oh i'm sorry oh i'm sorry because they'd
[1:36:20] be getting away with it
[1:36:23] amen anyway i don't know who needed that
[1:36:25] but there it is
[1:36:28] so that's right so now notice and it
[1:36:30] came to pass when the congregation was
[1:36:32] gathered against moses against aaron
[1:36:34] after saying you have killed him that
[1:36:36] they look towards the tabernacle of the
[1:36:38] congregation and behold the cloud
[1:36:40] covered and the glory of the lord
[1:36:43] appeared
[1:36:44] in other words these people's voices got
[1:36:47] god's attention
[1:36:48] i mean those our voices it gets god's
[1:36:51] attention
[1:36:54] and moses and aaron came before the
[1:36:56] congregation before the
[1:36:57] tabernacle of the congregation and the
[1:37:00] lord spake unto moses saying
[1:37:02] get you up from amongst this
[1:37:04] congregation that i may consume them in
[1:37:07] a moment
[1:37:10] second time in what two days twice in
[1:37:13] two days if god says just come over here
[1:37:16] let me ask you something what if moses
[1:37:18] in there and would have went over there
[1:37:21] it's been over with let me ask you
[1:37:24] something what if jesus wouldn't come to
[1:37:26] the cross
[1:37:28] we'd have been done but he stood in the
[1:37:31] breach for us
[1:37:33] i thank god that he stands in my breach
[1:37:35] for me every day
[1:37:37] i thank you for the grace that's still
[1:37:38] there and when you do something wrong
[1:37:40] when you fail
[1:37:41] you can go to your knees and you can be
[1:37:42] forgiven
[1:37:45] how you know sometimes bad things happen
[1:37:47] we don't understand
[1:37:49] hey lie it's happened to me it's
[1:37:51] happened to you it's happened to all of
[1:37:52] us
[1:37:52] we go through things that we don't
[1:37:54] understand whenever we do that whenever
[1:37:56] i do that
[1:37:57] i say god i don't know if this is
[1:37:59] punishment for what i have done
[1:38:01] then let me bear it and be patient isn't
[1:38:04] that right
[1:38:05] because sometimes it probably is
[1:38:08] amen teaching us
[1:38:13] hey you don't want to do things that's
[1:38:15] contrary to the word of god or you'll
[1:38:16] pay
[1:38:18] all right if i'm going to get to my last
[1:38:19] story i better hurry here but it's
[1:38:22] that god once again would ask the same
[1:38:25] thing
[1:38:26] they fell on their face before the lord
[1:38:27] they took a censor they ran up to the
[1:38:29] censor to the altar
[1:38:30] put it on there quickly unto the
[1:38:32] congregation said make an atonement for
[1:38:34] them
[1:38:35] for there is wrath going out amongst the
[1:38:36] from the lord and the plague has begun
[1:38:39] and aaron took moses commandment and ran
[1:38:42] into the midst of the congregation and
[1:38:43] behold
[1:38:44] the plague was begun among the people
[1:38:46] and he put on
[1:38:47] incense and made an atonement for the
[1:38:49] people and he stood between the dead
[1:38:51] and the living and the plague was stayed
[1:38:55] now they that died in the plague were
[1:38:57] fourteen thousand
[1:38:59] seven hundred besides them that died of
[1:39:02] the matter of korah
[1:39:04] amen doesn't say how many cores family
[1:39:07] was but it was two or three families but
[1:39:08] this was
[1:39:09] fourteen thousand men that it cost
[1:39:13] because they once again murmured and
[1:39:16] complained
[1:39:17] it cost dearly
[1:39:21] dearly that it cost
[1:39:24] how many knows every time sin will cost
[1:39:27] you
[1:39:28] ultimately it leads to death it's more
[1:39:31] it takes you further than you want to go
[1:39:34] it costs you more than what you want to
[1:39:36] pay
[1:39:37] and it keeps you a whole lot longer than
[1:39:40] what you want to say
[1:39:43] amen one more story the prophet of god
[1:39:47] i'll just repeat this
[1:39:48] brother branham when he was 20 21 years
[1:39:50] old married his
[1:39:51] the love of his youth how precious
[1:39:55] the love of your youth is precious

[1:42:13] and he told his wife and his wife on it
[1:42:15] to go and

[1:42:49] tell you some how many knows did god
[1:42:51] give him the gift of healing he had
[1:42:53] given him faith he had discernment that
[1:42:54] he could discern the thoughts of
[1:42:55] people's hearts
[1:42:56] and that would ignite the faith of the
[1:42:58] people so much that they know jesus
[1:42:59] christ was there and people would get
[1:43:01] healed they would get saved
[1:43:02] and multitudes hundreds and thousands of
[1:43:05] people
[1:43:06] that didn't get it because he wouldn't
[1:43:08] go when the holy spirit
[1:43:10] said go he disobeyed god
[1:43:14] and then there was a ohio flood y'all
[1:43:17] remember that
[1:43:17] he was he said he predicted that the
[1:43:19] river would come up at 20 20
[1:43:21] 22 feet at spring street or whatever and
[1:43:23] everybody laughed ain't never been that
[1:43:24] i ain't gonna get that eye
[1:43:25] but the water got that high he was
[1:43:27] trying to help people and everything
[1:43:29] else and his
[1:43:30] motor wouldn't start on his boat he was
[1:43:32] coming towards them falls out there
[1:43:34] he could hear the roar and he was crying
[1:43:36] god forgive me forgive me forgive me
[1:43:38] just before going over god let him start
[1:43:39] it up take up the river
[1:43:41] as a result of it all we know that his
[1:43:43] wife ended up getting the disease and
[1:43:45] dying
[1:43:46] and she was at her deathbed in that
[1:43:48] right she was there dying
[1:43:50] god refused his prayers all kinds of
[1:43:52] horrible things happened
[1:43:54] and there he was when he was right there
[1:43:56] and if you'll remember his wife when she
[1:43:58] was
[1:43:58] uh when he went in there and he says
[1:44:00] hope hope hope don't die on me or
[1:44:02] whatever
[1:44:02] or come back here he's calling on her
[1:44:04] and pray for us is that talk to me and
[1:44:06] she came back from wherever she was
[1:44:08] and she says honey why did you call me
[1:44:10] back
[1:44:11] it was such a beautiful place she said
[1:44:14] it's such a beautiful it's what you
[1:44:16] preached about
[1:44:17] it's so beautiful why did you call me
[1:44:19] back
[1:44:22] and she says you know honey what did she
[1:44:24] tell him
[1:44:25] you know where we made our mistake
[1:44:28] you know i'm here all of this
[1:44:32] is because you didn't go when god said
[1:44:33] he wanted you to go
[1:44:36] you sinned you missed the mark
[1:44:39] this is what it's costing
[1:44:42] and i said honey at the resurrection you
[1:44:44] stand over at the gate
[1:44:46] when you see abraham isaac and jacob
[1:44:48] come in when you see all the saints come
[1:44:50] in
[1:44:50] stand there by the post and see in case
[1:44:52] keep saying bill bill
[1:44:54] i'll have the children and i'll meet you
[1:44:56] there that was my last date
[1:44:58] with my wife how many knows that went
[1:45:01] with brother branham
[1:45:03] all the days of his life
[1:45:06] to know that that was his fault because
[1:45:08] he listened
[1:45:09] to his mother-in-law
[1:45:14] rather
[1:45:16] the voice of god the voice of god
[1:45:19] that we hear that still small voice
[1:45:22] and listen to that voice because if we
[1:45:24] don't we
[1:45:26] pay the price
[1:45:30] that was my last date with my wife by
[1:45:32] god's help
[1:45:34] i'll keep it she went to be with god we
[1:45:37] taken her down there to the undertaker
[1:45:39] and then they come by and they said
[1:45:40] billy your baby's dying too
[1:45:42] and no i said no no it can't be i rushed
[1:45:45] to the hospital there laid my little
[1:45:46] baby
[1:45:47] dying oh my my heart he says the way
[1:45:51] of a transgressor is hard
[1:45:56] remember that when god calls you go on
[1:45:58] no matter what anybody else says
[1:46:00] you serve god i laid my hands on the
[1:46:02] little baby and i said god please don't
[1:46:04] take my baby let her live
[1:46:06] she was my little darling and i couldn't
[1:46:08] stand to see her go
[1:46:10] and it looked like a black sheep came
[1:46:12] down in front of me
[1:46:13] another place he says you know is at
[1:46:15] that time the devil whispered in his ear
[1:46:18] said god don't love you because the
[1:46:20] devil knew
[1:46:22] not to tell him that there ain't no god
[1:46:24] he knew there was a god there was no
[1:46:26] question but the devil knew just what to
[1:46:27] tell him
[1:46:27] he doesn't love you he don't hear your
[1:46:29] prayer he don't care about you
[1:46:32] and the devil tried to put it in his
[1:46:33] mind he says if that's how god's going
[1:46:36] to be
[1:46:37] that right he never said it it was just
[1:46:39] something that came in his mind
[1:46:41] but he says the lord gave the lord taken
[1:46:44] away
[1:46:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:46:50] but he came down and i couldn't stand to
[1:46:52] see her go and it looked like a black
[1:46:54] sheep came down and then i raised up i
[1:46:56] put my hands on my head and i raised my
[1:46:57] hands up to god and i said god
[1:46:59] i'm so sorry that i have done the way
[1:47:01] that i did
[1:47:02] forgive me please keep my baby here with
[1:47:04] me i love her
[1:47:06] there lays laser mother dead don't take
[1:47:08] my baby too i promise you i will preach
[1:47:10] i don't care what the world says my
[1:47:12] heart was breaking
[1:47:14] and i know i had to reap what i sowed
[1:47:16] and i put my hand on the baby again and
[1:47:18] said god not my will but thine be done
[1:47:21] and the angels came and packed her away
[1:47:25] amen the way of a transgressor
[1:47:29] is hard the wages of sin
[1:47:33] is death stand with me tonight
[1:47:41] musicians if you want to come let's bow
[1:47:44] our heads
[1:47:46] and think about the sweet holy spirit
[1:47:48] that is in our hearts
[1:47:50] that tells us things on a daily basis
[1:47:52] that sometimes
[1:47:54] we miss and we pay for missing those
[1:47:57] voices and for
[1:47:59] not heeding the voice
[1:48:02] of the true son of god the true holy
[1:48:04] spirit in our hearts
