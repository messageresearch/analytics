[0:00] If you read the scripture, it says the
[0:02] devil is after us day and night. He's
[0:05] working every single day going to God
[0:07] back and forth. Hey, did you know Isaac
[0:09] did this? Did you know they did this?
[0:10] And God says, "Hey, I paid the price. My
[0:12] blood shed on Calvary. I paid the
[0:14] price." The devil says, "Hey, do you
[0:16] know they made a mistake?" Well, guess
[0:17] what? They asked for forgiveness. I paid
[0:19] the price. It is a paid work at Calvary
[0:22] for every sin that you'll commit
[0:24] tomorrow and then you committed in your
[0:26] past. It's a the cross is a
[0:29] three-dimensional cross. It's for your
[0:31] past. It's for your tomorrow. And it's
[0:33] for your present. It's a cross that
[0:35] presses all sin. Everything that you've
[0:38] committed, young people, if you made a
[0:40] sin, make it right and move on.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Don't live in that. The devil wants to
[0:46] make you live in a state of fear and
[0:49] anxiety. I've never seen so much anxiety
[0:52] between the young people and the the I
[0:55] want to I want to cut myself. I don't
[0:57] know why I'm saying it. I want to do
[0:58] this. I want because anxiety is in the
[1:02] land. They want to keep you. The devil
[1:04] wants to keep you busy. Say, "Hey,
[1:06] there's a better Hey, this is church is
[1:08] better. This boy I date is better." But
[1:10] I'm here to tell you, you've got the
[1:12] best vineyard. You have the revelation
[1:14] of the hour.
