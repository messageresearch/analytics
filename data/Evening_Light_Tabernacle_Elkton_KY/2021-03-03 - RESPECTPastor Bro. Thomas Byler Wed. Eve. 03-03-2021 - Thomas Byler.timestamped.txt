[33:07] speak on it perhaps just one more time
[33:09] would that be okay
[33:13] excuse me so if you will turn your
[33:15] bibles to matthew 10th chapter
[33:18] matthew 10.
[33:31] we want to read from the 10th chapter
[33:33] and beginning with verse
[33:36] 40.
[33:40] he that receiveth you receiveth me
[33:43] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[33:46] that sent me
[33:48] he that receiveth a prophet in the name
[33:50] of a prophet shall receive
[33:52] a prophet's reward and he that receiveth
[33:54] a righteous man in the name of a
[33:56] righteous man shall receive
[33:58] a righteous man's reward and whosoever
[34:00] shall give
[34:02] to drink unto one of these little ones
[34:05] a cup of cold water only in the name of
[34:08] a disciple
[34:09] verily i say unto you that he shall in
[34:11] no wise
[34:12] lose his reward turn to chapter 18
[34:16] matthew 18.
[34:20] put this down a little bit lower micah
[34:24] 18 and verse 4.
[34:30] whosoever therefore still humbled
[34:32] himself as a little child
[34:34] the same is the greatest in the kingdom
[34:36] of heaven
[34:37] and whoso shall receive one such little
[34:39] one in my name receiveth me
[34:42] but whosoever shall have been one of
[34:45] these
[34:45] believed in me it were better that for
[34:48] him that a millstone were hanged about
[34:50] his neck and that he would drown in the
[34:51] depth of the sea
[34:53] what went to the world because of
[34:55] offenses for it must needs be that
[34:57] offenses come
[34:58] but woe to that man by whom the offense
[35:01] has come
[35:02] may god add his blessings to the reading
[35:04] of the word you can be seated tonight
[35:06] like i said i want to just talk for a
[35:07] little while on respect
[35:09] amen and so
[35:13] amen we uh this of course is talking
[35:15] about
[35:17] here is talking about
[35:21] the ones that jesus sends because i know
[35:24] that
[35:25] god knew that he would be glorified
[35:29] amen he would be crucified that he died
[35:33] and he'd raise again then he go back
[35:35] into the pillar of fire i come from god
[35:37] and i go back to god he says he went
[35:39] from the pillar of fire back to the
[35:41] pillar of fire and paul of course seen
[35:43] that pillar of fire on the road to
[35:44] damascus
[35:45] amen and so we know that jesus christ
[35:49] came back on the day of pentecost
[35:51] and he is living in the hearts of his
[35:53] people amen
[35:55] so we see that god was talking here in
[35:57] the aspect of
[35:58] his people and how that as we respect
[36:01] one another we respect god
[36:04] amen and especially the children of god
[36:06] amen
[36:07] however you treat one of those but i
[36:09] want to start with
[36:10] go way back amen perhaps with the
[36:13] origination
[36:15] the origination of disrespect now i'll
[36:17] talk about disrespect for a little while
[36:19] and then maybe the other half will talk
[36:21] a little bit more about respect but
[36:22] disrespect
[36:23] of course originated in heaven amen
[36:29] this respect origin
[36:32] was spawned should we say spawn
[36:36] from something called pride amen
[36:43] how many knows that pride is is you get
[36:45] lifted up in pride as they call right so
[36:49] all of a sudden you're higher than
[36:50] everybody else or better than everybody
[36:53] else you know
[36:54] you get lifted up in pride and and you
[36:56] become disrespectful you're thinking
[36:58] you're better than
[36:59] anybody else over in the book of james
[37:02] uh
[37:03] i believe it was it talked about how
[37:04] that you know if some if a man comes to
[37:07] you
[37:07] to your church or whatever and and you
[37:09] know he has
[37:11] really bad clothing and he's not dressed
[37:13] good and
[37:14] you know you set him in the lower seats
[37:16] you know uh
[37:17] you know i don't know i guess maybe this
[37:19] would be the lower seats i don't know
[37:21] but
[37:21] iron man helping you put him up in the
[37:23] balcony you know but anyway we'll just
[37:24] use that as an illustration but one
[37:26] comes in and he's all dressed up he's
[37:28] real nice you know and
[37:29] you find the best place james was
[37:33] and don't have respect a respect or a
[37:36] person
[37:38] because god himself is not a respecter
[37:40] of persons
[37:42] amen how many knows he's not a respecter
[37:44] of persons
[37:46] amen and you'll find that over in the
[37:48] book of acts of 10th chapter where
[37:51] peter went to the house of cornelius
[37:54] which was a roman centurion
[37:56] which i guess it's over 100 people to be
[37:58] a centurion something like that and so
[38:00] he was an absolute gentile is that right
[38:02] he was a gentile he was a roman
[38:05] and when when when uh this centurion and
[38:08] when this
[38:08] the cornelius whenever he uh uh he did
[38:12] alms and he prayed and fasted i think
[38:14] for about four days and
[38:17] god hurries heard his prayer and the
[38:19] angel came to cornelius and said you
[38:21] know
[38:22] that your arms have been heard and
[38:23] you've been heard god has heard you
[38:26] you know and whenever you know peter he
[38:28] was having this
[38:29] vision of not eating things that you
[38:32] know that's not clean and so forth yet
[38:33] just come out of that
[38:35] when all of a sudden you know the thing
[38:37] of it was not to
[38:38] hang out with gentiles or not to be with
[38:40] gentiles because you're
[38:41] pollute yourself and so forth but the
[38:43] angel came and says no no more no more
[38:45] that
[38:46] you know and then then some of the
[38:48] runners came from the house of cornelius
[38:50] amen they were looking for him and then
[38:52] they found peter
[38:53] and peter went back and preached to the
[38:55] house of cornelius and so forth
[38:57] and he says uh for surety i know now
[38:59] that god
[39:00] is no respecter of persons or of nations
[39:04] but he absolutely i don't know exact
[39:06] words i could read it here in a second
[39:08] but
[39:08] he talks about anybody that respects god
[39:11] or any nation that respects god
[39:13] god will respect them it doesn't matter
[39:14] who it is
[39:16] am i right and so god is not a respecter
[39:18] of persons and you and i can't be a
[39:20] respecter person
[39:21] i don't care if it's a millionaire or if
[39:23] it's obama out there in the street
[39:25] as far as god's concerned that soul is
[39:27] just as valuable one or the other
[39:29] right and in the world you and i are
[39:31] living in we're living in a
[39:33] massive massive i mean display
[39:37] of disrespect
[39:40] how many knows it's just total
[39:42] disrespect out there
[39:43] and the prophet even taught us he says
[39:45] you let children become
[39:46] get to the place that they disrespect
[39:48] their parents isn't that right
[39:50] he said that family is all tore to
[39:52] pieces
[39:53] why because there's no respect there has
[39:55] to be respect
[39:56] if there's no respect anymore that means
[39:58] there is no love there anymore because i
[40:01] want to tell you
[40:01] just as pride brings disrespect love
[40:05] brings respect it brings uh
[40:08] consideration and
[40:09] understanding it puts you in the other
[40:12] person's shoes
[40:13] makes you feel for the other person
[40:16] amen and and what i thought about when i
[40:19] thought about love bringing respect
[40:21] i thought about how that brother branham
[40:23] was in that field
[40:24] in that right where this killer bull had
[40:26] killed a black man and they went and put
[40:28] him in somewhere else and he found
[40:29] himself in the middle of that field
[40:31] with no tree and no gun on his side and
[40:34] no fence close
[40:36] and this bull was stomping his feet and
[40:37] he was blowing his nose and he was
[40:39] fixing to come
[40:40] and brother madam was scared first or
[40:42] whatever he reached for his gun this out
[40:44] of the other he says he realized he
[40:45] couldn't do nothing so what do you do
[40:46] he just pray god this is how i'm
[40:48] supposed to go help me to go bravely
[40:50] and he says something come down and
[40:51] swept over and he said it was love
[40:54] and brother bannon began to talk to the
[40:56] bull
[40:58] hello folks i want you to know some
[41:00] disco has gone to every one of us
[41:02] whether it's friendships whether it's
[41:04] brothers and sisters
[41:05] where it's families if you really get
[41:06] the love of god in your heart
[41:08] amen you're going to have a respect for
[41:10] that person you're going to try to
[41:12] feel where they're coming from how many
[41:15] of those half of our arguments stem from
[41:17] not being able to understand each other
[41:19] or trying to get our point across
[41:22] and not understanding what the other
[41:24] person is saying
[41:26] a conversation and an argument will go
[41:28] so much better
[41:29] if you'll say yes honey i understand
[41:31] what you're trying to say so this is
[41:32] what you're trying to say to them
[41:34] and if you've got the correct answer
[41:35] you're honey your wife's eyes are going
[41:37] to get about that big and said really
[41:39] you got it right wow
[41:44] because we're so used to not having an
[41:46] understanding not going
[41:47] not having the other person to be able
[41:49] to understand what you're saying
[41:51] go ahead brothers amen this word here
[41:55] that's the truth in it yeah and but if
[41:58] you could understand what that person's
[41:59] but you'd have your things to get along
[42:01] a lot better
[42:02] amen and i'll tell you you know you find
[42:04] out during this cove at times when
[42:06] amen and me me and my wife are together
[42:08] a lot lately we're together a lot and i
[42:10] realized this
[42:11] you know for us to really have harmony
[42:14] i'm going to have to be very considered
[42:16] an understanding of her
[42:18] all right there's going to have to be a
[42:19] whole lot of love going on here
[42:21] that's right little not a lot of
[42:22] consideration and everything vice versa
[42:24] amen because if you don't amen it can be
[42:27] stressful
[42:29] that's right because if you don't get
[42:31] along real good it's stressful being
[42:33] together a lot huh
[42:37] but anyway let's get off that one shall
[42:39] we but anyway so what i'm trying to say
[42:41] is
[42:42] brother bannon was understanding he put
[42:44] himself in the bull's place
[42:46] and he began to say look this is your
[42:48] territory
[42:49] all right god put it in your brains and
[42:52] in your instinct and in your nature
[42:54] to protect your ground i mean he was
[42:57] understanding where he was coming from
[43:00] why because he had the love of god and
[43:02] him and he had so much love that he had
[43:04] so much respect
[43:05] that he began to tell that bull i
[43:07] apologize that i intruded upon your
[43:10] territory
[43:12] you know what that means that means
[43:13] because i kind of say with him
[43:21] that bull understood perfectly what he
[43:23] was saying
[43:26] hey it might have been a different
[43:27] language but he said it
[43:30] let me tell you god can interpret it to
[43:32] him same way with the hornets how many
[43:35] remembers when the hornets when he was
[43:36] there and he bumped against the fence
[43:38] and those hornets come up out of there
[43:40] and they were coming for him he said i
[43:43] apologize that i'd be disturbed too
[43:46] hello i mean our lives would be a whole
[43:48] lot better if we had more of the love of
[43:49] god in our hearts
[43:51] we'd have a whole lot more respect
[43:54] and that right and so he began to
[43:56] apologize he said now in the name of the
[43:58] lord i
[43:58] i'm working here trying to get in my
[44:00] yard mode but go back to where you come
[44:02] from
[44:03] hello and somehow or another i believe
[44:05] it was prophet said i don't know how
[44:06] they heard it
[44:07] but they did what they were told they
[44:09] went right back to where they were
[44:12] amen oh but i love to tell the bull
[44:15] story
[44:16] i love to tell the bull story because
[44:17] batman says that will come running at
[44:19] him isn't that right
[44:20] he come charging at him i mean i can
[44:24] just see that big back
[44:25] black bull by the time i know that big
[44:27] old black bull look
[44:28] coming just getting it you know
[44:31] so formal i understand in that bull just
[44:34] before he got to him
[44:35] he put his feet down and plowed into
[44:38] that ground
[44:39] and come to a stop
[44:43] and uh he looked this way did he look
[44:47] that way
[44:50] where did that guy go i don't know if
[44:54] you can see where
[44:54] he was looking around but hey man what
[44:57] is it i mean believes that god can do
[44:59] just that folks
[45:00] he can he can make a way when you don't
[45:02] think there's a way
[45:04] jesus if he needed to he can walk right
[45:05] in the middle of a bunch of people he
[45:07] was trying to kill him
[45:09] amen so we look at that and
[45:12] you know and what brought this respect
[45:15] in the very beginning
[45:18] amen was that i guess it must have
[45:21] become commonplace to
[45:22] the satan and all of those angels heaven
[45:25] in that perfect
[45:27] perfection in that perfect life in that
[45:30] perfect presence of god
[45:33] i cannot imagine any angels
[45:36] having discontent
[45:40] being discontent
[45:44] huh and maybe they weren't
[45:48] maybe they weren't discontent but satan
[45:51] the devil
[45:52] amen remember he was up there
[45:55] and it says that his heart was lifted up
[45:58] with pride
[45:59] and in uh isaiah 14 i believe it gives
[46:02] it says he says he said in his heart i
[46:06] will be like the most high
[46:09] i will exalt myself my throne above the
[46:11] stars of god i will be like the most
[46:13] high
[46:13] he wanted to be like god he got up
[46:15] lifted up in pride
[46:17] and perhaps began to think that he was
[46:19] as good as god was
[46:22] huh he was as good as god was
[46:26] and you know god just doesn't deserve
[46:28] all the worship he just don't deserve
[46:30] all that
[46:34] and he got lifted up and he become
[46:36] disrespectful to god
[46:39] and what did he do he went through
[46:42] heaven and he began to tell the other
[46:45] angels you know
[46:46] you ever notice how god always gets all
[46:48] the glory we don't get no more glory
[46:51] and he sowed that discontent he sowed
[46:54] that seed of discord
[46:57] he sowed a disrespect
[47:00] the minute that he got lifted up in
[47:02] pride and he got out of his place
[47:05] he began to have disrespect for god
[47:10] amen i believe it's over in the book of
[47:12] jude
[47:13] it talks about now over in the book of
[47:16] jude
[47:17] it talks about basically it starts from
[47:19] the angels
[47:22] actually verse starts in verse 4. it
[47:24] says for there are certain men kept in
[47:26] unawares who were before of old
[47:28] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[47:31] men
[47:32] notice turning the grace of our god
[47:36] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[47:40] lord god
[47:41] and our lord jesus christ i will
[47:43] therefore put you in remembrance though
[47:45] he once knew this how that the lord
[47:47] having saved the people out of the land
[47:49] of egypt afterwards destroyed them that
[47:51] believed not
[47:52] and the angels which kept not their
[47:54] first estate
[47:55] but left their own habitation hath he
[47:58] reserved in everlasting chains
[48:00] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[48:02] great day so we see here
[48:04] that the angels didn't keep they didn't
[48:07] stay
[48:07] in the place that god had called them to
[48:10] be
[48:12] they changed their mind they went from
[48:14] one
[48:15] to another he went from one state of
[48:18] mind to another state of mind
[48:20] they did not keep their place they lost
[48:23] their respect now remember those words
[48:28] lost their respect
[48:32] amen how many believes you have to be
[48:34] careful
[48:35] not to lose your respect
[48:39] because when you lose your respect amen
[48:42] then you also lose your love
[48:45] that's right and you become
[48:48] disrespectful
[48:50] arrogant and just like these angels and
[48:53] like israel
[48:55] so now notice i want to
[48:59] read verse 12 first because it says
[49:02] woe unto them for they have gone in the
[49:04] way of cain perished in the gain saying
[49:07] of cora
[49:08] spots they are in your feast and charity
[49:10] when defeats you feeding themselves
[49:12] without
[49:13] fear now remember that fear is a
[49:15] reverence or
[49:16] a respect i mean at least the fear of
[49:19] the lord
[49:20] is the beginning of wisdom i'll tell you
[49:22] this right now the world is in the
[49:24] condition that it is because they
[49:27] lack respect for god
[49:32] people don't even have respect for
[49:33] themselves anymore
[49:35] people just don't have any respect not
[49:36] for their self
[49:39] amen it's terrible but here it says
[49:43] feeding themselves without reverence or
[49:45] fear clouds the eye without water
[49:47] carried him out of winds
[49:49] trees whose fruit is withered twice dead
[49:52] tucked up by the roots and so forth but
[49:55] he talks about cain talks about natural
[49:57] and brute beasts
[49:58] michael the listen to this it talks
[50:01] about uh
[50:02] sodom and gomorrh giving themselves over
[50:04] the strange flesh
[50:05] i mean they lost their respect these
[50:09] filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise
[50:12] dominion or authority in that right
[50:16] and speak evil of dignities
[50:19] of authorities yet michael the archangel
[50:22] when contending with the devil
[50:24] he disputed about the body of moses
[50:26] thirst not bring against him a railing
[50:28] accusation but said the lord rebuked you
[50:31] hello am i right here or did the angels
[50:35] or were they careful about what they
[50:37] said to the devil
[50:40] did you read that with me listen let me
[50:43] read it again because that's the way i
[50:44] read it
[50:45] michael the archangel when he was
[50:47] contending with the devil and he was
[50:48] disputing about the body of moses thirst
[50:50] not bring against him a rattling
[50:52] accusation
[50:53] all he said was the lord rebuked you
[50:56] huh he watched his mouth
[51:00] i want to tell you out of our mouth
[51:03] flows
[51:04] the the ooze of disrespect when somebody
[51:08] becomes disrespectful watch their mouth
[51:12] they will blah blah blah blah tells
[51:14] anything about anybody with any regard
[51:16] and spread the poison everywhere
[51:19] disrespect
[51:21] amen and you got to watch what you say
[51:25] that i'm going to know that because one
[51:27] little offense targets the son and
[51:28] daughter of god
[51:30] and god's going to get you for it you'll
[51:32] dearly pay for it
[51:34] you have to be very careful what comes
[51:36] out of our mouth even the devil
[51:38] i know about you but i don't like the
[51:39] devil a whole lot
[51:42] but yet according to this you got to
[51:43] watch what you say
[51:45] just like you say come on devil you
[51:47] better watch what you say
[51:49] huh you challenge him you better be
[51:52] careful
[51:53] just the lord rebuke you the lord the
[51:56] lord is my shield
[51:57] he'll take care of you huh
[52:01] but i believe we can say things that we
[52:03] shouldn't say we can get ourselves in a
[52:05] lot of trouble
[52:06] when we open our mouth when we shouldn't
[52:10] amen and so that's what the devil did
[52:11] now notice over it came down in the
[52:13] garden of eden so we know that
[52:15] he took two-thirds of the angel or third
[52:17] of the angels of heaven
[52:18] he actually persuaded to become
[52:20] disrespectful and god
[52:22] thrown them all out now i'm trying to
[52:24] get to heaven
[52:25] they got thrown out of heaven i'm
[52:28] looking forward to going to heaven
[52:29] [Music]
[52:31] how many knows church and being a
[52:33] christian is heavenly places in christ
[52:35] jesus if you're in christ
[52:38] amen church is one place that's supposed
[52:39] to be a heavenly place in christ
[52:41] if church gets old to you i've said many
[52:44] times heaven's gonna get
[52:46] old to you church gets common to you
[52:49] heaven's gonna get common to you because
[52:52] you're gonna be there a long
[52:54] long long long time
[52:57] huh satan was there who knows how long
[53:01] god help but never to get old but the
[53:04] prophet of god said don't never let the
[53:06] word and the message of the hour to
[53:07] become
[53:08] common to you amen
[53:13] praise the lord let me just say this
[53:15] while i come to mind because you know
[53:16] brother brother bam taught us that when
[53:18] we come to the house of god
[53:19] amen when our children cry too much
[53:22] screaming and hollering
[53:23] they're not supposed to keep in here we
[53:25] got a nice little cry room go back there
[53:27] that is disturbing to everybody beside
[53:29] you
[53:30] huh respect that right amen a lot of
[53:33] churches when you come to church
[53:34] 30 minutes before we've had a few here
[53:37] 30 minutes before tonight
[53:38] i could point them out to you but listen
[53:42] when we come he says to come early why
[53:44] because it's the time
[53:46] of consecration it's a time of respect
[53:51] a time now knows respect is reverence
[53:55] so you don't come in the 30 minutes
[53:56] before and hey brother john
[53:59] i wasn't logging today huh
[54:02] i didn't like you you know you didn't
[54:04] get run over by a skit or anything
[54:06] but just talk about everything and
[54:08] anything
[54:10] broadband says come in here quiet
[54:13] he says it'll mess up the service if you
[54:15] do those things
[54:17] coming reverently quietly respectfully
[54:21] to what what is it to take your mind off
[54:25] of the things of the world
[54:27] take your mind off of all of the cares
[54:29] of life
[54:30] come in early and let me just say world
[54:33] you know if our church
[54:34] services are hurting it's probably
[54:36] because of that
[54:38] because we don't pray enough about
[54:40] service
[54:43] ask each one of you tonight ask yourself
[54:45] how many minutes you spent
[54:47] actually praying for tonight's service
[54:51] no i'm going to rebuke a little here but
[54:54] if a lot of us locally here
[54:56] if we need to pray long and we just say
[54:58] hey you know i need to go
[55:00] because that's what the holy spirit had
[55:01] told you to do
[55:03] huh because that's part of the reason i
[55:05] don't like the council service on the
[55:06] wednesday night didn't really want to in
[55:07] the first bit
[55:08] but kobe kind of pushes into it because
[55:10] once you get out of something it's easy
[55:12] to stay out of it
[55:13] you start failing church and it's easy
[55:15] not to come to church
[55:17] it's much easier next time not to come
[55:19] to church and i'll tell you what your
[55:20] excuses for not coming
[55:22] will get thinner and thinner and thinner
[55:26] smaller and smaller and smaller what is
[55:28] all that it's all a disrespect to
[55:30] almighty god
[55:32] we used to go through storms snow storms
[55:34] and floods just to get to church
[55:36] huh but now we got our well just the
[55:39] smallest slightest thing will keep us
[55:41] out
[55:42] how many believe showing up for church
[55:44] it means you're respecting god
[55:46] amen if you can't come and you're at
[55:47] least on the internet look at that's at
[55:49] least a respect to god
[55:52] but anyway come pray how many believes
[55:55] it's irrespect that's what the prophet
[55:56] of god taught us the respect
[55:59] amen a respect for almighty god
[56:02] because he sees everything we do
[56:05] he sees everything we don't do
[56:09] amen he's not a respecter of persons and
[56:11] yet
[56:12] if you respect him he will respect you
[56:17] amen he will hear you just like the
[56:20] house of cornelius
[56:21] he prayed he did alms and he did
[56:23] everything he could and god heard him
[56:25] for what he did
[56:26] god hears us for what we do he sees
[56:30] us for what we do so how many will do
[56:32] that after the night everybody
[56:34] let's remember come early get on your
[56:37] knees
[56:40] pray read your bible get your mind off
[56:43] come you know because when you respect
[56:45] god remember
[56:46] you come and you're beginning to expect
[56:49] something to happen
[56:50] you're expecting brother byler or should
[56:52] i say the holy spirit through brother
[56:54] byler
[56:55] to say something that he didn't know
[56:59] amen something that exactly what you
[57:02] needed
[57:04] and when you catch that amen you had a
[57:07] hollow praise to god
[57:09] thank you god that's right because i
[57:12] mean believes that's how god works
[57:14] amen now i'm gonna tell someone brother
[57:17] glenn here
[57:18] he had the nerve to pick on me i'm gonna
[57:20] pick on him i like that
[57:22] remember last time i told my until i was
[57:24] preaching out there about respecting
[57:26] your wife and have
[57:27] you know i opened the door for her and
[57:28] so he picked on me a little out of turf
[57:30] he said i was talking brother bob
[57:31] he got come on and he said brother i
[57:34] tell you what i'll be trying 40 years to
[57:36] get my wife to open my door for me you
[57:38] just messed that up
[57:39] you sent me back about another 20 years
[57:44] because you know that was just funny it
[57:47] tells you it shows you they're listening
[57:48] right
[57:49] how many believes that is we respect one
[57:51] another and we respect god
[57:53] amen when you love god you will love one
[57:56] another go read first the second time
[57:58] john says so much that it's impossible
[58:01] for you to say that you love god and not
[58:05] love your brother you say you love god
[58:07] and hate your brother he says you are
[58:09] a liar and if you love your brother you
[58:12] will respect your brother
[58:15] you will respect your sister it brings
[58:18] you respect
[58:19] amen one place better i'm talking about
[58:22] respect and so forth he says you know
[58:24] cast your
[58:24] if you want somebody to say something
[58:26] good about you say something good about
[58:28] them
[58:29] he says because it's like casting your
[58:31] bread upon the waters
[58:32] and it will come back to you people will
[58:34] say something good back at you
[58:37] amen and then another brother from
[58:39] canada sold brother branham
[58:40] the first time i had ever read that i'm
[58:42] 45 almost 60 years old never knew that
[58:44] this was
[58:45] a saying but catch your bed upon the
[58:47] waters and they'll come back to you
[58:49] buttered
[58:54] i like that that's right the bread will
[58:56] come back and it'll be bothered
[58:58] that's right amen sometimes people say
[59:00] disrespectful things about you and
[59:02] everything
[59:03] just keep your mouth shut and try to say
[59:04] something good
[59:06] that's the real victory that we're
[59:07] looking for because watch out then
[59:09] people will ever
[59:10] actually have a be able to respect for
[59:12] that as you respect others others
[59:15] respect you
[59:17] praise be to god but that came on down
[59:20] it come down on the
[59:21] in the eve how many knows that eve fell
[59:23] because
[59:25] she began to not believe what god said
[59:30] just to not believe what god said is a
[59:34] disrespect
[59:35] it is an absolute disrespect to not
[59:38] believe what god said
[59:40] and eve didn't believe it
[59:43] she did believe something else she
[59:46] believed the devil
[59:48] when he told her that you're not really
[59:50] gonna die
[59:52] now let's say let's say this for sure
[59:55] that the devil
[59:56] called god a liar
[1:00:00] huh because god said you're going to die
[1:00:03] then i said no
[1:00:04] he's not you're not going to die
[1:00:07] no that god just said that made him a
[1:00:10] liar
[1:00:11] and the devil's lie over god's word it
[1:00:14] was a disrespect was it
[1:00:16] it was a complete disrespect and we of
[1:00:19] course know that cave which was of that
[1:00:21] wicked one the bible says which was of
[1:00:23] that serpent
[1:00:24] before he was turned he was of that
[1:00:26] wicked one
[1:00:28] and even after he brought his fruit and
[1:00:31] he brought his
[1:00:31] uh offerings amen the bible says that
[1:00:35] god had respect abel
[1:00:37] and on his offerings but on came
[1:00:40] god had no respect
[1:00:43] why because it was the incorrect worship
[1:00:47] oh boy that's a good sermon incorrect
[1:00:50] worship how many knows the
[1:00:51] incorrect worship of god i don't even
[1:00:53] accept it from you
[1:00:54] it has to be the right worship it has to
[1:00:57] be the right sacrifice the right
[1:00:59] offering to god
[1:01:01] amen and so yet not respect
[1:01:05] and then god came to god came to cain
[1:01:10] and talked to cain said hey cain
[1:01:14] i know you're a little bit mad here
[1:01:16] you're roth
[1:01:18] your continent's fallen he says but why
[1:01:20] don't you worship the way your brother
[1:01:21] does
[1:01:23] and i'll i'll accept you i'll accept you
[1:01:28] but can't do it he didn't even have to
[1:01:31] respect
[1:01:31] after god told him how to do it to do it
[1:01:34] that way
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:39] my my mind so we seen that respect
[1:01:42] coming on down
[1:01:43] coming on down on down disrespect all
[1:01:46] the way to
[1:01:47] uh israel how many knows israel was very
[1:01:51] disrespectful to almighty god it's
[1:01:53] respectful
[1:01:56] that most of them are eternally lost
[1:01:59] the bible says many places they enter
[1:02:01] not into rest because of our unbelief
[1:02:02] they perish because of their unbeliefs
[1:02:05] and they're right because of their
[1:02:07] unbelief they perished
[1:02:09] god had moses to come and bring the
[1:02:11] children of israel out of egypt in that
[1:02:13] right with a mighty hand
[1:02:16] how many knows those fleas those frogs

[1:02:54] your stuff and go

[1:03:00] he would and brought them out
[1:03:02] out of the land of egypt brought him all
[1:03:04] the way to the red sea and when they
[1:03:05] come to the red sea

[1:03:42] us out here so they can kill us out here

[1:03:52] disrespecting moses they were just
[1:03:54] disrespecting

[1:04:06] cora got nathan got lifted up in pride
[1:04:09] also
[1:04:10] and he was spiritual he knew how to pray
[1:04:14] he had the holy ghost so to speak he
[1:04:16] felt like he was right with god
[1:04:18] he says you're not the only holy man
[1:04:19] we're only two
[1:04:21] you know you take too much upon yourself
[1:04:23] and they open their mouth
[1:04:25] they weren't happy with it they weren't
[1:04:28] content with it
[1:04:29] with the way that god had ordained it no
[1:04:32] it had to be their way
[1:04:34] and boy do we ever get in trouble when
[1:04:36] we think that something's got to be
[1:04:37] i'll tell you what god brings things
[1:04:40] against us
[1:04:42] against the way that we think it ought
[1:04:43] to be you know that
[1:04:46] just to see how we'll react to it
[1:04:49] just to see our reaction
[1:04:53] to see if we're really dead or not or
[1:04:56] we're alive
[1:04:58] amen sure he does and trump trust
[1:05:02] me god is a master at it
[1:05:06] he'll do it when you don't think he's
[1:05:08] doing it he'll do it in a way you ain't
[1:05:10] expecting it to happen
[1:05:13] amen but he's going to trust and try
[1:05:16] every son that comes to god
[1:05:18] must be tried must be tested amen
[1:05:22] nathan said man this ain't right it
[1:05:24] ought to be this way
[1:05:26] this is not the way it's supposed to be
[1:05:29] he opened his house
[1:05:31] with disrespect about marion amaran
[1:05:35] miriam and aaron i mean i was there
[1:05:36] disrespected moses
[1:05:38] and he made a little snicker and a
[1:05:40] little fun about who moses married
[1:05:43] what color she was and so forth and that
[1:05:46] they were struck with leprosy
[1:05:50] isn't that right miriam i think a
[1:05:54] prophetess and so forth
[1:05:55] aaron god's right hand is his right hand
[1:05:58] man so to speak but yet they were both
[1:06:00] going to be dead because of their
[1:06:01] disrespect
[1:06:03] see we open our mouth when disrespect
[1:06:06] comes in here
[1:06:08] when disrespect sets in you can believe
[1:06:09] one place it's gonna show it's coming
[1:06:11] right out of our mouth
[1:06:13] that's where it comes from came with
[1:06:15] date and came with eve it came with
[1:06:17] man just all kinds of miriam aaron
[1:06:23] how about here's one you remember
[1:06:26] the elijah that cursed those 42 children
[1:06:29] that came out
[1:06:31] listen to this brother babe says it this
[1:06:33] way he liked them in the name of the
[1:06:34] lord because
[1:06:35] not because of the children but because
[1:06:38] of the irreverent
[1:06:39] parents that brought the children up the
[1:06:41] way to disrespect god
[1:06:44] one thing i don't care if it's thomas by
[1:06:46] eiler i don't care of what your last
[1:06:48] name is
[1:06:50] every one of us is more and greatly
[1:06:52] affected by the way that you was raised
[1:06:54] and what you think
[1:06:58] you are greatly affected by it by the
[1:07:01] way you have respect or not whether you
[1:07:03] think you're better than everybody else
[1:07:04] or not or whether you're humble or
[1:07:05] whether
[1:07:06] whatever the your pattern of thought
[1:07:08] most of the time
[1:07:09] is directed to the children from the
[1:07:12] parents
[1:07:13] amen so how many knows that's why it's
[1:07:15] so important to bring your children
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:19] now none of our us parents were perfect
[1:07:22] you
[1:07:22] probably aren't perfect but when you see
[1:07:25] where you're wrong at how many notes
[1:07:26] that's where you want to change
[1:07:28] it say let me follow the bible
[1:07:30] scriptures if i'm not doing something
[1:07:32] right let me get back to the way the
[1:07:33] bible tells me
[1:07:34] amen because my parents were wrong i'm
[1:07:37] probably wrong
[1:07:38] but we're here to try to straighten some
[1:07:39] of that wrong out
[1:07:42] amen irreverent parents that brought the
[1:07:45] children up to disrespect god
[1:07:46] two she bears come out and killed 42 of
[1:07:49] them
[1:07:50] how many knows 42 children that's a
[1:07:52] pretty big chunk of children
[1:07:54] that's a bunch can you imagine the
[1:07:57] bloody mess that it was
[1:07:59] it wasn't no pretty sight for them to
[1:08:02] get
[1:08:02] killed by bears and why
[1:08:06] that's right because of irreverence god
[1:08:09] demands respect
[1:08:10] and when they disrespected the prophet
[1:08:12] they just disrespected him
[1:08:14] no matter what if they didn't believe it
[1:08:15] they ought to have kept their mouth shut
[1:08:17] stay away from it but no they had to put
[1:08:20] in their nicholsworth
[1:08:22] huh i mean those that's where we get
[1:08:24] into troubles when we want to put in our
[1:08:26] nicholsworth this is what i think
[1:08:29] i ain't even got a thought coming i
[1:08:31] wanted what the holy spirit wants i
[1:08:33] follow the holy spirit
[1:08:35] and if i don't trust me god will get
[1:08:36] onto me for i mean
[1:08:38] that's for every one of us i don't want
[1:08:40] my nickel's worth i don't want my input
[1:08:43] let god do it amen but listen
[1:08:46] they had to say something that they
[1:08:48] ought not to have said and that's what
[1:08:51] why it happened so notice
[1:08:55] um
[1:09:03] let me see here did i miss something
[1:09:08] yes here it is they have been taught
[1:09:11] to snicker and to laugh and to make fun
[1:09:16] like the children of today too many
[1:09:19] of them found of a street meeting amen
[1:09:23] they'll make fun of their preaching of
[1:09:25] the gospel amen
[1:09:27] they were taught to snicker and to make
[1:09:29] fun and laugh
[1:09:31] and so forth and if you remember what he
[1:09:32] said what they said to elijah was thou
[1:09:35] ballhead go up double head go up
[1:09:39] it wasn't elijah was it it was elijah
[1:09:42] elisha
[1:09:43] because they were talking about elijah
[1:09:44] growing up like elijah did if i'm not
[1:09:46] wrong
[1:09:46] but listen he called him a bald head
[1:09:48] bald head
[1:09:50] what them kids even were taught to
[1:09:52] disrespect
[1:09:53] an adult how many knows we don't teach
[1:09:55] our adults
[1:09:57] because back in the olden days
[1:10:03] and get back slap right there you go it
[1:10:06] won't be disrespect anymore
[1:10:09] nowadays you have to be careful i guess
[1:10:10] unless you live on the farm like i do
[1:10:14] but listen those kids weren't taught to
[1:10:16] respect they were taught
[1:10:17] to make fun ah that's just old elijah
[1:10:21] that's just uh you know brother branham
[1:10:24] hello
[1:10:25] that's just that seventh grade educated
[1:10:27] hillbilly you better watch what you say
[1:10:29] isn't that right
[1:10:32] and think about this and this just comes
[1:10:34] to mind because
[1:10:35] here god had enough love to tell us
[1:10:39] the true path in this generation by
[1:10:42] sending malachi 4 and going
[1:10:44] world over with the power of god
[1:10:47] healing back in pointing us right back
[1:10:50] to the bible and nothing but the bible
[1:10:51] in that right
[1:10:52] and proving and vindicating with powers
[1:10:55] and and healing and so forth
[1:10:58] discernment the very same thing with the
[1:11:00] woman at the well your name is so-and-so
[1:11:02] all the time to the very last messages
[1:11:05] that he ever preached
[1:11:06] what the denominations do they had such
[1:11:09] disrespect
[1:11:10] until they went so to speak into their
[1:11:13] basement
[1:11:14] their denominational basements and said
[1:11:16] it ain't even happening
[1:11:19] then they ain't shining the sun ain't
[1:11:21] shining out there
[1:11:22] these things aren't happening you know
[1:11:25] he ain't a prophet
[1:11:29] as you respect god's people
[1:11:32] god's prophets that's the reward that
[1:11:36] you get
[1:11:36] accordingly isn't that right if you give
[1:11:39] a cup of cold water to one of god's
[1:11:41] children you can't help one another
[1:11:43] you can't give you want to eat anybody a
[1:11:45] cup of cold water without losing your
[1:11:47] reward
[1:11:49] amen remember the shunammite woman
[1:11:53] the tsunami woman she had respect for
[1:11:56] the prophet
[1:11:57] and she realized that he was a man of
[1:11:59] god
[1:12:00] amen we believe he's a man of god and
[1:12:03] they build him a little building
[1:12:04] a little addition come on and so forth
[1:12:07] and what did uh
[1:12:08] elijah say to gehezei said go ask her
[1:12:12] what she wants
[1:12:15] amen can you imagine asking the prophet
[1:12:18] of god
[1:12:19] amen probably god telling you what do
[1:12:22] you want
[1:12:24] you better be careful amen because your
[1:12:27] wish will most likely be granted
[1:12:30] is that right she says i haven't had a
[1:12:33] child
[1:12:35] what did she get she got a child and
[1:12:37] about 12 years later the devil just said
[1:12:39] hey i'll get rid of this little boy
[1:12:41] i'll he'd kill him from sunstroke
[1:12:44] and my head my head out in the hot sun
[1:12:47] and his head hurting
[1:12:48] symptoms of a sun stroke and killed the
[1:12:50] boy

[1:13:08] okay all is well

[1:13:31] over that boy i'm not sure if it's seven
[1:13:33] times or something like that he sneezed
[1:13:34] coming back to life
[1:13:36] amen why because she had respect and she
[1:13:40] received
[1:13:41] a prophet's reward i want to ask you
[1:13:44] something what do you think
[1:13:46] that we have received by accepting
[1:13:50] a prophet in this generation the prophet
[1:13:52] that god himself sent
[1:13:53] and came into the platform almost every
[1:13:55] time and proved and vindicated to be
[1:13:58] true amen
[1:14:01] my we can be free we don't have to worry
[1:14:03] about what church is right what religion
[1:14:05] is right
[1:14:06] we know what is right this bible is
[1:14:08] what's right
[1:14:09] god has come and he has proved that
[1:14:11] that's what's right nothing else
[1:14:12] not my word not nobody else else's word
[1:14:15] is right but that is right
[1:14:17] amen oh my not to mention
[1:14:21] think about this let's think about a
[1:14:22] couple more
[1:14:24] how about the uh another
[1:14:27] widow got a res uh a prophet's reward
[1:14:31] called the widow
[1:14:35] that had that one son remember elijah
[1:14:39] went and he went to the mountains and so
[1:14:40] long and afterwards used to go down into
[1:14:42] this city a widow old sustainer
[1:14:44] he come walking down the sidewalk and
[1:14:46] there was a winner there and she was
[1:14:48] fixing her last meal they're right
[1:14:52] fixing her lego he said what he got well
[1:14:54] i got a little meal
[1:14:56] and a little oil here you know we're
[1:14:58] about to starve it's
[1:14:59] you know we've not had rain for three
[1:15:01] and a half years we're about to die
[1:15:04] oh you know he said i got enough for one
[1:15:06] more cake for me and my son we're gonna
[1:15:08] eat it and die
[1:15:11] and you know what this prophet said this
[1:15:13] prophet said well bring me one first
[1:15:18] oh you got enough for you and your son
[1:15:20] one more meal bring it to me would you
[1:15:23] bring it to me whoa
[1:15:26] why that would get some people critical
[1:15:28] with me
[1:15:30] when i get critical you can really get
[1:15:31] critical you know but no he said bring
[1:15:33] it here
[1:15:35] and that right and she was gonna do it
[1:15:37] she went and she says okay
[1:15:38] you say so she must have seen something
[1:15:41] in the man
[1:15:42] for thus saith the lord huh
[1:15:45] maybe she had done turned maybe she was
[1:15:47] going in to get that meal maybe she was
[1:15:48] ready
[1:15:49] but for thus said the lord the meal will
[1:15:52] not dry
[1:15:52] up and the oil will not dry up until
[1:15:55] this drought is passed
[1:15:57] i think it was three and a half years
[1:15:59] she got this scrape
[1:16:02] scrape scrape probably three times a day
[1:16:05] i don't know but i i'm gonna ask her how
[1:16:08] much gay weight
[1:16:09] weight she gained how much weight did
[1:16:12] she get in that three and a half years i
[1:16:14] grant you you could probably eat all on
[1:16:15] that barrel you wanted to
[1:16:17] huh jesus was sustained why
[1:16:21] it was a prophet's reward i don't
[1:16:24] believe there's anybody
[1:16:26] that is in a place of authority like a
[1:16:28] prophet of god or a wise man
[1:16:30] or a scribe right or even
[1:16:34] you just the children of god doesn't
[1:16:37] have to be part of the fivefold ministry
[1:16:39] i know the fivefold ministry is a gift
[1:16:40] that's given by god isn't that right
[1:16:43] that's exactly right it's a gift given
[1:16:44] by god and then there's you know but
[1:16:46] every one of us it doesn't make
[1:16:48] me special just makes it's just that god
[1:16:49] has given me a gift i'm just like
[1:16:50] brother branson i am just
[1:16:52] a sinner saved by grace i am just your
[1:16:55] brother
[1:16:56] that's it you know if i want to be
[1:16:58] anything higher than that
[1:17:00] i'm going up too high i'm just your
[1:17:02] brother and god has placed a gift in me
[1:17:04] to actually minister to you to edify you
[1:17:07] to help you to be a blessing to you amen
[1:17:10] not an indictment
[1:17:14] but he says if you'll just give a cup of
[1:17:17] cold one
[1:17:18] but he says you know woe to the world
[1:17:20] because of offenses
[1:17:21] now offenses are going to come huh
[1:17:25] wouldn't it be nice if there was never
[1:17:26] no offenses
[1:17:28] nobody ever crossed you nobody ever
[1:17:30] rubbed you the wrong
[1:17:32] way you know got your goat so to speak
[1:17:36] just really that's really
[1:17:38] you know it can pop where a boss just
[1:17:40] tries to annoy you
[1:17:41] blames you for stuff you it could be
[1:17:43] anything over and over again
[1:17:46] maybe even get you fired boy now that
[1:17:48] would be really something wouldn't it
[1:17:51] it'd be a good question to ask can you
[1:17:53] say well god i don't know why you
[1:17:55] allowed this to happen but
[1:17:56] lord just forgive them forgive them huh
[1:18:00] you know what i can tell you about
[1:18:02] what's liable to happen
[1:18:03] can i tell you what's liable to happen
[1:18:05] what's liable to happen is two days
[1:18:07] later
[1:18:08] all of this comes out and the main boss
[1:18:10] finds out what he was all about
[1:18:12] and he also finds out what you're all
[1:18:14] about he says hey thomas i want you to
[1:18:16] come up here
[1:18:17] i fired him i want you to take his place
[1:18:20] that's what's liable happen when you
[1:18:22] commit your problems to god
[1:18:24] and when you fear him and you don't get
[1:18:26] your gun out and want to shoot somebody
[1:18:28] for doing your own like most people do
[1:18:29] nowadays
[1:18:30] get it to god and trust god in it have
[1:18:32] respect how many ways we need
[1:18:34] more respect for god
[1:18:38] amen i i remember
[1:18:42] and parts what really brought this
[1:18:45] message to me
[1:18:46] all right where i got this message to
[1:18:49] preach this tonight was
[1:18:50] i was out in my garage
[1:18:53] and i've been doing work and we've got
[1:18:55] some posts there and i was leaning up
[1:18:56] against the post
[1:18:57] like that just thinking about the lord
[1:19:02] how good he is and the honor he's really
[1:19:04] worthy of
[1:19:06] how many know he's worthy or really a
[1:19:08] whole lot more honor than when we give
[1:19:09] him
[1:19:10] the ball game they get a lot of honor
[1:19:12] car races to get a lot of honor they get
[1:19:14] a lot of respect
[1:19:14] people go crazy boy they worship their
[1:19:17] sports
[1:19:20] huh but when it comes to worship
[1:19:24] he deserves more than what we give him
[1:19:26] he deserves everything
[1:19:28] i was leaning up against there i was
[1:19:30] thinking about the respect i was
[1:19:32] thinking about how this in this world
[1:19:33] our
[1:19:34] political world nobody has one bit of
[1:19:36] respect
[1:19:37] that's why it's so tore up
[1:19:40] it don't matter if somebody's a racist
[1:19:42] or not if it's to their benefit they're
[1:19:44] going to call you a racist
[1:19:46] huh they're going to call you stuff you
[1:19:49] and that's
[1:19:50] very disrespectful huh
[1:19:53] but i was thinking about respect and
[1:19:54] respect to god and i got leaning up
[1:19:57] there and i think i thought
[1:19:58] i remembered what brother branham said
[1:19:59] that on a saturday night he much respect
[1:20:01] for god
[1:20:03] that on saturday night about 11 o'clock
[1:20:06] he would respect the sabbath so much
[1:20:10] which we know the sabbath is actually
[1:20:11] saturday but our sabbath is the first
[1:20:13] day which is sunday
[1:20:15] he respected sunday that resurrection so
[1:20:17] much until
[1:20:18] he was a sinner boy and he says well i
[1:20:22] guess
[1:20:22] it's raining it's pouring maybe it was
[1:20:24] lightning i don't know
[1:20:26] but he had to go he had muskrat traps
[1:20:28] and all of that down along the river
[1:20:30] he had fish traps i guess of some kind
[1:20:33] he says well i'm going to have to go
[1:20:34] down there and get all them fish that's
[1:20:36] on the line and
[1:20:37] get them traps all snapped because i'm
[1:20:40] not going to get one on the sabbath day
[1:20:42] he had that much respect for god i said
[1:20:45] lord
[1:20:46] help me lord help me where am i
[1:20:50] at where is my spect
[1:20:53] lord help me to have more respect for
[1:20:54] god and everything i do
[1:20:56] in the words that i say and the way that
[1:20:58] i live and the way that i dress
[1:20:59] and every conduct that i have let my
[1:21:02] life let me resp i want to respect for
[1:21:04] god
[1:21:05] because i'll tell you what everything
[1:21:06] else will fall in place and then i
[1:21:08] thought about this one more scripture i
[1:21:09] hope this is a blessing to you remember
[1:21:11] that
[1:21:11] young one servant boy came up
[1:21:15] or was it the rich young ruler might
[1:21:16] have been the rich young ruler that come
[1:21:18] up to jesus and says good master what
[1:21:21] shall i do to be saved
[1:21:23] what must i do to inherit eternal life
[1:21:26] and jesus turns and says he says there
[1:21:28] is none good
[1:21:30] but one and that is god when i thought
[1:21:33] about the disrespect that this world has
[1:21:35] just the chaos that it's in and i
[1:21:38] thought you know
[1:21:39] not only is is it can you apply it like
[1:21:42] there's none
[1:21:43] good but god but there is nothing
[1:21:46] good but god
[1:21:50] nothing is good but this respecture
[1:21:52] isn't good
[1:21:53] respect is of god right so that's good
[1:21:55] love is of god's good
[1:21:56] everything that's good is of god
[1:22:00] without without you know unless it's you
[1:22:03] know if it's good
[1:22:04] then it's of god if it's bad you know
[1:22:06] there's just nothing else there's
[1:22:08] nothing else
[1:22:09] you're not nothing good except god
[1:22:11] should i say amen
[1:22:13] that's respect is just one of the things
[1:22:15] that comes from god
[1:22:16] love is one of the things that comes
[1:22:18] from god
[1:22:20] love your love will make you put
[1:22:21] yourself in
[1:22:23] other people's shoes it'll help you to
[1:22:26] be
[1:22:27] understanding it'll help you to have
[1:22:30] compassion
[1:22:32] it'll make you to be forgiving and
[1:22:34] loving
[1:22:36] you won't hold grudges you won't have
[1:22:38] bitterness none of those things have any
[1:22:40] place
[1:22:41] in a person's heart
[1:22:45] amen amen both here
[1:22:49] and out there listen i truly believe
[1:22:51] that even around the message people are
[1:22:54] losing their respect for almighty god
[1:22:56] and that's why they are getting further
[1:22:59] and further away
[1:23:01] from god amen
[1:23:05] and i'll tell you this it'll be only the
[1:23:07] grace of god
[1:23:08] that holds you that keeps you
[1:23:12] that tells you hey you're not what you
[1:23:14] should be you don't have respect for god
[1:23:16] like you should
[1:23:17] amen i think our 30 minutes earlier
[1:23:20] and so forth and coming here it's just
[1:23:22] one sign of where we're at
[1:23:25] hello it's just a sign
[1:23:29] that's right because even me you know
[1:23:32] because
[1:23:32] sometimes i you know a real sacrifice is
[1:23:36] to get up and go when you don't feel
[1:23:38] like it
[1:23:39] how about we all do what we feel like
[1:23:41] huh
[1:23:42] we wouldn't come to church half the time
[1:23:43] would be a whole lot we don't do but you
[1:23:46] just don't do that we should be taught
[1:23:48] not to
[1:23:49] have more respect than that
[1:23:52] have more respect than just to do what
[1:23:54] your body feels like doing
[1:23:56] do what the holy spirit tells you to do
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:00] amen god bless you we're gonna let you
[1:24:02] out five minutes early how's that sound
[1:24:04] let's stand amen let's stand
[1:24:10] let's bow our heads
[1:24:14] and let's go before the lord
[1:24:18] and as we bow our heads i think about
[1:24:20] malachi i believe it's the first chapter
[1:24:23] and god says you know a servant has a
[1:24:27] respect
[1:24:28] for his master a son has a respect for
[1:24:31] his father and so forth but he says
[1:24:33] where's my honor
[1:24:35] where's my respect i wonder how many
[1:24:39] tonight
[1:24:39] just look in your heart and realize you
[1:24:41] know i have
[1:24:43] lost my respect my reverence
[1:24:48] for god and i want it back right here
[1:24:51] and right now and it's raised my hands
[1:24:53] to god
[1:24:54] give it back to me lord i want that
[1:24:56] respect for you lord jesus
[1:24:58] because i know that with respect for you
[1:25:00] everything that could possibly
[1:25:03] be good will come into my heart it'll
[1:25:05] fill and saturate me lord
[1:25:07] but if i lose my reverence for you god
[1:25:10] things will just get worse i'll get
[1:25:12] worse my attitude will get worse my life
[1:25:14] will get worse
[1:25:17] oh my it's just well it's a terrible
[1:25:18] world to live lord you see every hand
[1:25:20] tonight
[1:25:21] jesus lord give me more respect for you
[1:25:24] my hand is up lord i just ask god that
[1:25:26] you help me father
[1:25:28] your servant just to have a much greater
[1:25:30] respect for you father
[1:25:32] and i thank you lord for helping me take
[1:25:34] more time just to read and pray and
[1:25:36] not just come 30 minutes early to church
[1:25:38] but to take time out
[1:25:40] in the day to meditate upon you to pray
[1:25:43] to you lord
[1:25:44] to find a place to find a feedback to
[1:25:47] find a salt bag something out in the
[1:25:49] garage just somewhere
[1:25:50] hideaway just to drop on my knees and
[1:25:52] say lord here i am
[1:25:54] i love you lord i worship you father
[1:25:57] you're such an
[1:25:58] awesome god all good things come from

[1:26:06] you and thank you for
[1:26:07] all that you do and have done lord and

[1:26:10] caught up in the things of this world
[1:26:13] and in the cares of life
[1:26:15] and god we give it respect we give so
[1:26:18] much respect to so many
[1:26:22] other things that don't mean anything
[1:26:27] really don't bring us joy there's only
[1:26:29] one thing that brings us joy that is to
[1:26:30] be right with you
[1:26:32] to have the holy spirit in our heart to
[1:26:34] be able to go home tonight
[1:26:36] having confessed all of our wrongs and
[1:26:38] made everything right
[1:26:39] leaving for lord and being able to say
