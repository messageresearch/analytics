[0:00] named by the name of Elijah. Aren't you
[0:02] glad that we had a prophet of our day
[0:05] and he would stand and preach the word.
[0:07] He would bring the word. He didn't have
[0:09] a whole lot of money, but he didn't care
[0:11] about the money. He cared about souls.
[0:13] And that's where you should be. Every
[0:15] one of us should be going, I want to get
[0:17] another soul into the kingdom of God.
[0:21] We should all, no matter who you are,
[0:23] preacher or not, we should all be
[0:24] striving in the same direction.
[0:27] But it seems like a lot of us will have
[0:30] our vineyard set up and we'll plow all
[0:32] day and we'll believe the message of the
[0:34] hour and then someone come up to you in
[0:37] the message. Well, then they say this
[0:39] and then they say that or take the
[0:41] prophet's word out of contents or well,
[0:43] we don't really need to go to church.
[0:45] No, when brother says when them doors
[0:47] are open, you Christian cannot miss a
[0:50] church service.
[0:52] I tell you why. I I believe people are
[0:54] hearing some other different things and
[0:55] this and that. And I'm here to tell you
[0:57] the Bible says as the days are
[0:59] approaching
[1:01] more so we should be coming to the house
[1:03] of God.
[1:05] I tell you why we should be protecting
[1:07] our vineyard. I'm here to tell you to
[1:08] tell you saints that we should protect
[1:11] our vineyard, our home. What God has
[1:13] gave you, what God your business,
[1:15] everything you got, give it back to God.
[1:19] Protect your home front.
