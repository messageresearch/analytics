Honorable and glorious and his righteousness endureth forever he hath given me unto them that fear Him He will ever be mindful of his Covenant The Works of his hands are Verity and judgment all his Commandments are sure he sent Redemption unto his people he hath commanded his Covenant forever holy and Reverend is his name and this one together the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and good understanding have all day that do his Commandments his praise and Earth forever man um I guess I better leave that up I was thinking I had a mic though sorry if you would turn with me in your Bibles we'll do a little a little lesson this morning out of the book of Romans chapter one hope you've had a good week some of you have anyway God's been good to us all there you go uh the book uh I've been studying myself in the Book of Romans and kind of looking and and going that direction but and just reading what different Scholars and different uh theologians different ones and prophet and different ones said about it and uh you know the book of Romans is is probably one of the uh considered one of the greatest books in the Bible written books of the Bible some different ones I'll just give you some of the things that said Martin Luther he prays it he said it is the chief part of the New Testament the perfect gospel the absolute epitome of the Gospel um uh someone else that is the compendium of Christian doctrine uh anyone who understands this epistle any so anyone who understands this letter he has a passage open to him to the understanding of the whole scripture and the it's also been said it's the most profound work in existence so it just goes on and on and on people's read this and I think what is so intriguing about the book of Romans uh is you've got Paul writing it after Paul had been preaching for around 20 years I think it was they think uh he preaches out of the starts writing and preaching to the Romans this is a place that was uh he did not found the church in Rome uh but it's thought posted in the book of Acts that there were Romans around during during the time on the day of Pentecost and those those Romans had went back and started a church kind of on their own kind of took what they had and what they knew and went with it and now Paul's excited to come and talk to these Romans now so let's read if we could out of Romans 1 and we'll read about 17 verses as I go down through there uh Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God which he had promised before By His prophets and holy scriptures concerning his son Jesus Christ Our Lord which was he's made of the seat of David according to the Flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of Holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received Grace and apostleship to the faith among all nations for his name among whom are ye so-called of Jesus Christ to all that be in Rome beloved of God Called to be Saints grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers making requests if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you I long to see you and I may impart into you some spiritual gift to the end may be established that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual Faith both of you and me now I would not have you be ignorant Brethren that oftentimes I purpose to come to you unto you but was let hitherto that I may have some fruit among you also as among the Gentiles um that are both the Greeks anti-barbarians both the wise and the unwise so as much in as me is so let me start that so as much as in me is I'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith so when we read this we it's really astonishing to me that as Paul writes is because you know Paul he wasn't always the most upstanding Christian uh he thought he was in his ways uh but it took it took God coming down and striking striking Ms all and and there's a conversion that took place and he himself had to start going through the persecution and so then he says you know this is after he stoned Stephen and all this has happened and he's he's persecuting and Steve and stoning and then he comes up and and basically now he's writing this letter and says I'm a new person I'm a new man and this is where all of us as Christians have had to have found ourselves and as you read through this scripture here you see different things and I want to read to you uh just something here that in in August of 1513 there was a monk and he was studying in the book and he went and he was studying in the Book of Psalms actually the Psalms 31 and this monk was who we know as Martin Luther and he's reading in Psalms 31 and he's reading there and in Psalms 31 it says envo Lord do I put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness and as he read this this passage began to confuse him and this passage begin to uh make you think in God's righteousness uh how can I be delivered if it's God's righteousness how can I be delivered when God is so great God is as it's amazing God can do anything I can't be nowhere near that so how can I even find myself standing before God I'm not good enough to be before God and I think a lot of times young Christians especially they find themselves in a place that they say how can I come to church how can I go to the functions how can I do these things because I'm not good enough well let me ask you how many of us ever was good enough we're never good enough but it's but but then as he began to read this Luther goes down and he begins to then reflect back on what was said in Romans 1 17 and he looked at this and it says the righteous of God is revealed through faith for faith that is written he who through faith is righteous shall live so it's by our faith that we stand on a day-to-day basis it's not by anything we do it's not by any of our merits it's not by our good works it's not by our offerings our tithes but it's simply by faith that we can look at the cross the same cross that Saul had to look at when he's sitting there and persecuting Christians and he looks and he said there is something to this cross how do I get to work how do I get to where Jesus was and it was by his faith and he begins to preach and give this back out to the to the Romans so it's really an amazing thing as Luther begins to read this Luther said he said day and night I pondered it until I grasped the truth that the righteousness of God is the righteousness whereby through Grace and sheer Mercy he justifies Us by faith he says therefore I felt myself to be reborn that I have gone through open doors aren't you thankful that the veil was rent and now there's an open door that we can step into just like just like he did as he began to look at this and he he steps right through that open door and says now I'm in a paradise I'm in a place that I know who God is just by reading the one scripture in Romans 1 17. goes on down through here we'll look at this in in May of 1738 there was a failed minister a failed Minister and a missionary and he went to said he reluctantly went to a small Bible study and someone began to read Martin Luther's commentary kind of rehearsing exactly kind of what I just told you and here this failed missionary sits there and he says to us he says later he says while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ I felt my heart strangely warmed he said I felt that I did trust in Christ and Christ alone for my salvation and an assurance was given to me that he had taken away my sins even mine he says that was John Wesley John Wesley had to come to a place just like all Christians have to at some point in time you have to come to that place that you say by Faith by his Mercy by his grace my sins are taken away even mine as wicked as mean as rebellious as honorary as we are as human beings come on Church it's by this right here it's just by faith that we can go before Calvary we look at this here and uh going back into the book of Romans here in the first chapter I'm going to break down just a few of the scriptures here and and because Paul it's an amazing I mean I think uh as I'm digging into this I've been reading it and getting on these commentaries on this and it's it's really astonishing of what Paul is doing here but he says in verse 7 he says to all that being wrong beloved of God Called to be Saints and that stood out there because these Believers it says were called to be Saints they were not Saints did you hear what it says they were called to be Saints Paul didn't go preaching to a bunch of righteous holy people none of us come to church righteous and holy but by God before the foundation of the world and the Lamb's Book of Life he says I called you to be brought so right here the very scripture here is leading us to have our to build our faith as Paul looks at this and he says they were called to be Saints he says first I want to thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world can we say that this morning can we say that our faith has been spoken of throughout the whole world what do people say about us in our communities how is our faith speaking before us that's something for us to think about there because these Romans who who was not founded upon a a Christian believer didn't come in there and found it it was a group of Believers on the day of Pentecost that Saul they saw what was happening they went and founded the church but now their faith has been known and spoken of around the whole world so where does our faith speak for us this morning think about that verse 15. so as much as in me I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are in Rome also Paul was ready he was ready to take a stand he was ready to spread the word now think about all he'd been through this is after he'd been preaching for they think like I said 20 years think about the persecutions he had been through but yet he comes before these Romans and he's put in the back of his mind no matter what I've been through no matter the valleys no matter the mountains no matter the rivers I've had to cross no matter the hardships I've had to face I'm here and I'm ready to preach the gospel are we ready to spread the gospel this morning the good news of Jesus Christ because that's what the scripture is telling us it's given us encouragement to preach the gospel for I am not ashamed of the Gospel we have to be careful with that one because we find ourselves in tight situations sometime and and before you know it maybe you're just not quite ready to step out there and speak exactly what you want to say you may be just a little bit standoffish I found myself in those places that I'm not comfortable sometimes spreading or saying exactly what I feel and what I should say I'll give you an example just comes to mind last week Joe's had to go to the to my work with me they'd never seen her some of them hadn't so if she goes in there we take care of business and I come back the next day and this woman says hey hey hey come here come here I gotta ask you something it's personal oh boy are y'all Pentecostal what's all of our answers sometimes most of our answers we're non-denominational we follow the scripture and that's about where we leave it that's where I left it and I thought you know maybe I should have went a little bit deeper into what I really do believe and then we'll see what my work really thinks about me what they really believe about me and she said well I just wondered because I saw how your your wife was dressed so there's your witness going before the world there's your faith and your witness and your testimony going before the world but I just thought you know that that we have to have that boldness that we're not ashamed everywhere Paul went he wasn't ashamed whether it meant prison whether it meant beating whether it meant scourging whatever it was he was not ashamed for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first also to the Greek that and then we'll finish with the just shall live by faith the prophet I said I was looked this up and he says talking about the just shall live by faith he said we should be unfolding he said God 's Spirit pouring out not just one little gusher not just one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation of just shall live by faith alone or sanctification or even the gifts of the Spirit he said but revelation after Revelation power after power glory after Glory he said that's the way we ought to be on our road ready for the translation he said but we not careful he said we linger around we back down to the old things and say well we just keep going back he said no let's go go forward so as he's looking at this scripture he's a he's talking about the great things that Paul is talking about and the things that that Luther saw and the things that John Wesley saw oh and he said but for us we're a step further than that now we've gone beyond where that was at but now we the bride of Jesus Christ have been not seeing ourselves a little bit farther we're even farther than just having the gifts of the spirits we need the Justice I live by faith we need sanctification we need clean lives we need clean living we need those things in our life but it's more than the gifts it's more than clean living it's moving on forward with God so as we look at that this morning let that be our thoughts as we think and and uh if you read into the book of Romans and you start digging into that I hope you enjoy I think you'll find that there's a lot of good information in the Book of Romans so God bless you Brother David this morning sure did appreciate that this morning sing that law course and this course come on my hardest Brother Brad was speaking and he has forgiven me I'm so glad he

heart and you know but you know I get to thinking about and I thought well Maybe some uh they don't they didn't have as much to be forgiven as you maybe that's why you get really excited sometimes but I'm just glad he set me free this morning and I just I look back in my life and and I just say thank you Lord for your goodness and your mercy and you know I had I always told people if having good parents would have let you enter in I said I'd have skated in with the best of them but it didn't work that way I had to be born again just like my mom and my dad was I had to have the Holy Spirit in my life and I'm so glad I had a witness someone to point me in the right direction you know and I'm just so glad that I was born and had a family like I did and you know we weren't we weren't rich but uh you know there's a saying going around about people being drugged and I said well that's the way I was I was drugged to church I was drug here and Drug bear if it had anything to do with God I was drugged there it wasn't whether I wanted to go or not it's just I need the opportunity to be there that's the way my dad said it my dad had a saying he said as long as your feet slide under my table my rules apply he said I don't care if you're 50 years old and you live here you'll do things my way it's the highway and uh and I said yes sir but I was so glad that he lived a life in front of me that was pleasing to God and he taught me what it was to be a Christian and amen I'm just thankful this morning and I just appreciate him let's sing that song and shouldn't have read him no the glory

word of God Amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we just humbly come before you once again approaching your throne of grace Lord Desiring God that you'll just have your perfect will father in the service this morning Lord may you be in every word that is spoken father every action and every thing that is done may it glorify and bring honor and Glory To Your Name Lord and we just ask God that you'll bless each and one that has made the effort to be able to come out Lord into your house Lord Jesus to hear your word and those listening bless them Father and we ask God you'd help me just to get out of the way Lord that you might speak the words of a life father what you once said and what you feel Lord to express to the church this morning may the spirit speak this morning for we ask it in your precious name amen and amen want to continue a little bit on our thought from Wednesday I just couldn't get away from that amen amen and so we want to go here you know take a little flame thought kind of and go in a little bit different direction but amen if you will turn your Bibles we'll go to the book of Ephesians amen and we want to read a scripture of course uh that we picked up off of the thought of him who let us we let until he be taken out of the way talking about the power of God and how that he is in Supreme control amen amen there is nothing that hasn't been put under his feet isn't that right nothing that hasn't been put under feet there's nothing that he didn't conquer praise be to God Amen and this morning it'll be kind of a challenge to us with the help of the Lord Ephesians 1 and we'll begin with verse 20. which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above amen I like that word far don't you far above all principality amen and power and might wow it's just talking about power and might in that right and Dominion any Authority whatsoever amen and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and have put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church amen which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all may God add His blessings through reading your words you can be seated amen now I want to talk a little bit with the help of the Lord and and look at this from Paul's perspective because Paul had uh he's the one that mentions that here in Ephesians again he mentions and in the Colossians amen and then we go back over into the book of Hebrews with the help of the Lord and and see what he has there but in Ephesians again he mentions in chapter 4 verse 11 and unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended upon High amen notice Paul picking it up again talking about what happened when Christ descended upon High amen he says he led captivity captive amen praise the Lord let me know if something really happened something really happened today that Christ rose from the dead and when he ascended oh my and he gave gifts unto men isn't that right he gave gifts unto man down in verse 11 it says um well maybe we'll read verse 10 and he had in he had Ascent descended it's the same also that ascended far above all heavens amen how many knows there's different levels of Heaven sixth Dimension where the Saints are under the altar he goes up to the seventh heaven Paul talked about the seventh one I believe it was that he might feel all things amen and he gave some of course Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers amen Psalms right there we see what what God gave back as gifts when he ascended on high so if a person is a pastor a teacher a prophet whatever it is I mean that person's just your brother he's no different than anybody else except that God has placed a gift in that man's life is that right amen and you either have that gift or you don't have that gift amen it's something that's divinely given brother bam taught the gifts and rep and uh callings are without repentance the Bible says amen and so it's placed there from your birth praise be to God amen and so even this morning truly if I'm a pastor go called of God then that's something that you're uh feeding on that's something that is a blessing from God amen who knows that teachers are blessing from God evangelists are blessing from God prophets are a blessing from God where would we be without the fivefold ministry this morning amen everybody just kind of do their own thing I guess you know but it's what now notice what it's for for one thing it says it's for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man amen little big word for us human beings but it's there amen I believe it don't you unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now notice I like this and I want to just pick this up because this fight for Ministry and this what God gave was that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and through praise be to God and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by this light of men and the cunning crafting is why but whereby they lie and wait to deceive now notice how many know that anybody that's a Christian anytime there's a gospel priest it was the Colossians the Ephesians it don't matter what it was amen there would always be trying to amen the same as it is in African different places from what I understand that where the message has gone forth there's always false doctrines and always fall things that are trying to get in to rob you of the real blessing that's yours here he talks about that we don't be tossed to and fro because there's going to be an attempt at Deception for you the devil's going to attempt to deceive you with not something uh uh just out there in sinful world but something that is a Doctrine that's false false Doctrine and so forth and I remember when I first come in and this is kind of off the line of but perhaps just what the Lord wants but amen when I first come in a message and brother John steaming and even beginning to build the church we had just a few people there and and just and small but you know we had maybe then a few more families coming it wasn't no time until some of those folks that came in some of those good families seeming like God all caught up in false Doctrine amen and so you know it goes around the devil's just always there to try to knock you out of the real solid thing but notice how it says that a real five-fold Ministry is not going to go off somewhere but it's going to keep you from being tossed to and fro makes them solid edifying in the body of Christ amen so now this is like I said this is not really what I want to go but I thought that was good how did he let captivity captives and that really caught my mind whenever the Lord kind of brought me that you know what are you giving up there he took captive and that doesn't really need any explaining everybody knows that that which you were kept captive by he put it in jail aren't you glad for that that he put yeah put it in jail the thing that kept you bound he bound it oh my God that's right where you used to have no joy right not the devil tries to come and steal you if you ever do it but as long as you keep him out he can't come in he can't never rob you again because you've got him in the place you want him amen I like that now over in Colossians we'll get to our thought here in a minute over in Colossians again I was reading a chapter the other day amen because how many believes that we ought to read every day and I you know yeah I believe in not me but bam says maybe read a chapter or two but I believe that was a book or two don't hurt amen and so you know whether I'm in the stand perhaps somewhere you know I just like to read amen and and so I read the whole book of Colossians and as I was reading down through here I'll pick some things up that I thought went really long with what uh ministering Wednesday and where I kind of got my thought of going further a little bit in part two perhaps but uh and also in uh well I won't get into that but in the other Bible that I have which is I don't even know the name of it but it has an explanation of what this was sent to the Colossians 4 the intent that it was and all of the different things the doctrines that they were having to deal with and so forth about Jesus not being Divine and all of that but anyway so Paul is trying to get across to them that Jesus Christ was the fullness of God Amen and now notice in in verse 9 of chapter 2 it says for in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him amen ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power you know as I was studying there's another scripture that came to me about you know that Christ has is above every principality and every Power Jesus on his last uh when he came to the 11 in verse 16 of Matthew 28 and then he uh then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when he saw them they worshiped him but some doubted and Jesus spake and said unto them saying now notice notice what Jesus says to them after not having been absent from them right now he says all power is given unto me in heaven and earth praise be to God aren't you glad aren't you glad that all power he has all power he's not a power but what is his given unto him in heaven and in Earth that's another place to dispute the two different gods if there's another God somewhere we ain't got no power because Jesus said he had all the power amen all power is given unto me in heaven and earth and then he says go into all the world and preach the gospel isn't that right amen so he wanted to know that beyond the power of God was going to be behind them amen now notice back to Ephesians I mean Colossians next in Colossians if you want to try to follow me I can wait on you but you know Colossians 2 amen now we just read Mercy Lavin or yeah verse 11. for he is the head of all principality and power and then he goes on talking about just you being dead in your sins and so forth and how did he blood it out the hand writing of ordinances verse 14 that was against us which was contrary to us and took it all out of the way nailing it to the cross and having spoiled I like this word spoiled I mean how many believe that Jesus was a spoiler of the devil's little party he did absolutely spoiled everything the devil had when he went to Calvary instead of uh taking it you know without a Calvary when he when he went there he spoiled all the devils stripped him of everything he had any kind of Rights on and then we're doing now I think Ramsey we talked about we're dealing with it powerless enemy it defeated enemy is what we're dealing with so he says in having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it made me think of that song oh are you in the church triumphant yo quiet are you in the church try out for triumphant means Victorious are you in the savior's bride if you're not then come and be baptized into the body and forevermore abide I'm glad this morning to be in the church triumphant amen it isn't necessarily a local body but it's those who have been baptized into Jesus Christ's Spirit they're in the church triumphant they're Victorious they're the kind of people that don't have to have Victory a little bit of angry they have complete Victory cause what Jesus does anything he does a thorough job he does the perfect job and when God comes and doesn't work in you he does the perfect work [Music] praise be to God aren't you glad Hallelujah so I found that there and I found from Paul talking again about Christ coming and spoiling principalities and triumphing it over them Hallelujah he was talking about the law did people judging you in meter and drinking that has a little bit to do with what they were dealing with and so forth he needed to just clear all of that up don't let nobody judge you in a holiday or new day or or Sabbath days which is your shadow of things to come and so forth amen and I went down to verse chapter three is where I want to get my message she says that if he then Paul says if ye then be risen with Christ Hallelujah now when we skip the whole lot we skipped a whole lot when he talked about you are dead you were dead in your sins and trespasses you had the quickened I mean you you've risen with him even he says if you've died with Christ and you Rose it with Christ tonight amen not quite after 12 so it's still morning but we're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen and now if you are risen with Christ seek no things which are above Hallelujah come on think about it now he explains what we're to seek up there amen we're to seek something up there what are we gonna what are we supposed to seek up there where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God in other words Paul's telling us to look up now look up a little bit where Jesus ascended on high let captivity captive spoil every principality and he's about the Bible says he's above the heavens of Heavens now he's way out there praise be to God he's up of all the dimensions there are he's above every dimension he's in the highest dimension amen there's hell there's the reasons that are lost there's the regions of the saved and that's then there's up there where he is above every Dimension that is he is oh he is in the highest Dimension praise be to God this morning we want to look at what he's doing up there amen Paul said look above and also and I've named this seek those things verse 2. it's set your affections on things above not on things on the earth setting our affection huh that okay let's talk about setting our affection because you know I know that that's where the problem leads it's not with God it's where people's affection is it's where they love it it's where the exposure it it's what they desire or don't desire is where the problem is amen I thought of our thought this morning look every one of us is here because your effect affection is right your affection wants to be in church [Music] that's why we sit here because this is where our affection he says let your affection now we know for affection and conscience and memory and reasoning is one of the five five uh um five feelings not feelings what do you call it huh said Thank You census one of the five senses of not the body but of the spirit see taste feel hear and smell but my faction causing that something in the spirit realm and that's where the problem is is what the spirit realm of people amen oh my so now let's look at what Paul's talking about here for a minute but Paul's talking about how that we're supposed to look up seek those things which are above where he is sitting at the right hand of God turn with me to the book of Hebrews and Hebrews 3 Hebrews 3 and 1. I'm just about going to have to try that mark off some of these so I can keep this straight Hebrews 3 and 1 says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling considered the Apostle and high priest of our profession Jesus Christ how many knows in the book of Hebrews Paul talked a lot about thou Christ and his high priest position how did he is our high preached isn't that right how many knows he is our high priest he has now notice who is faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all at his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in so much as he who has builted the house have more honor than the house amen says this for every house is filled up by some man but he had built all things as God is God and Moses barely who is faithful in all of his house was as his servant for a testimony of those things which were before spoken after but Christ as a son over his house whose house are are you with me we now may believe that we are his house and Moses was faithful in what he did and he's saying that Jesus as this high priest he's faithful in his house amen whose house are we if we hope faster for confidence and the rejoicing firm unto the end let's go over to chapter four chapter 4 and verse 14. notice here he says seeing then that we have a high priest that is passed into the heavens policy he was a Jew and he he knew what all of key Ephesus and he knew the order of high priests and all of the church and all of the way that it was supposed to be he knew that we don't have it here now but he knew what it was the holies of holies was and how that you couldn't go into that and the holies of holies unless you as a priest and levite and unless you were dressed just tried all of these things so Paul was very familiar with the priesthood and he takes boats of Hebrews and he talks about this priesthood he brings in Melchizedek now that Christ was a a priest after the order of Melchizedek and so forth which we'll get into but he says we have a great High peace that is passed into the heavens Jesus Christ the son of God he says seeing them not did he say see go things out from above so here it says seeing then that we have this great high priest that passed into the heavens as Jesus the son of God let us hope fast our profession [Music] our brother bam said our confession I mean those he said one place he says he's the high priest of your confession so you before you get anything from God you have to confess that it's yours that you believe in it that he purchased it for you he's the eye please of your profession amen for we have not and high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling huh of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of me think about it when I got into thinking about this how that how that Jesus Christ Humanity ascended up on high he's there making intercessions for you and I that's what he's doing up there and he's a perfect high priest he's not like the high priest that Paul had to deal with that he talked about over even anywhere over in the Old Testament because Paul explains a little bit uh the difference between Jesus and the high priest that they had to deal with he says uh in chapter 7 verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death in other words he now realized that all the other priests they you know they couldn't always fulfill the desires of that people would have perhaps perhaps you'd want to see the priest today oh he seek the name huh or he died yesterday and it'll be a few days before we get another one but this man because he continues ever has an unchangeable priesthood in other words it doesn't have to be changed for two thousand years amen wherefore he is Abel also to save them to the other most that come unto God by him seeing that he ever liveth to make an intercession for us I like that how many know you ain't never worried you ain't never got to be worried about not getting up being able to get a hold of your high priest the one that intercedes for you the one that you prayed to that's why prayer is so powerful is because you've got a powerful high priest you've got a powerful person that's right there and that's why the public God could say you know whenever the weakness Christian gets on his knees and said God forgive me of my sins and failures that we might be weak but if you get on your knees the devil traveled cause he knows that you've got a high priest they don't get old he don't he don't never he's never out of time he's never home he's never away from home he's always there not just during the day but day and night he's there for you interceding for you for anything that you have made up because he's come overcome sickness he's overcome fear he's overcome depression he's come overcome sorrow he's gonna overcome everything like that and I have that says sometimes if we've got a high face like that why are we still like we are why are we not exactly what we're supposed to be when we've got a perfect high priest foreign [Applause] given to us by Jesus Christ when he's there he's up there in a perfect place a perfect high priest there to make intercession for you as he said he is able to save them to the uttermost he can completely save you he can completely deliver you he can completely fill you he can give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen whatever you need of he's done to make it good he's there to make every word every promise that he ever made good for you [Applause] he's sitting on high this morning and we know under the breach Hunter program says when he leaves that intercessory box when he has no intercessor anymore you can pray all you want to let me tell you there'll be people falling on their knees they'll be following at the altar in the tribulation period after he who let us will let until the Holy Ghost is taken out of the way when the Holy Ghost is God there is no more mercy no matter how much they cry even brother Brown said they'll come to the Altar and see that they're getting saved when they're not you tell them you talk about this evening we're no unknown part of that no no no no we want to take advantage now God take care of my problems now Lord get me ready Lord amen oh my for such a verse 26 for such an high priest became us who is Holy blameless or harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made in high priests no and made higher then the heavens amen higher than the heavens look up that way Paul says who needeth not daily as those High priests who offer up sacrifice first for his own sins huh and then from the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself I may believe that that was a perfect and complete offering when he offered himself what is that now you can kill all the goats and Jeep you want it'll never do you any good anymore why because he gave his son he gave his blood for us he paid the price and now he's not one that needed daily or to keep making them and so forth for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity amen amen he made High priests out of those who have infirmity but let me tell you he has no infirmity this morning aren't you glad for that praise be to God he doesn't have any need it's a perfect high priest so then why then why I ask myself why do we not possess the things that we should have do we not really trust this high priest do we not have an open Channel with this high priest amen how many believes it's important that we have a Clear Channel with this high priest when we pray and when we have things that he hears us it's important praise be to God it brought me to this question that is why what excuse do we have what is our excuse how about you realize today that the world not only do we should not have a dog you know give me an excuse we are good at giving ourselves excuses but we're done without excuse we don't have an excuse how many knows the Bible says and even brother Adam says you know when you become a Christian to send question is settled you don't believe anymore you don't have failures but the same question is settled if you see on sin and have a desire to send you need to get saved you need to get the Holy Ghost because God Christ overcomes sin just depends on where your desires are remember Jesus said he said you know the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man that made a marriage and so forth he invited everybody and he'd let everybody come oh I mean oh Jesus is welcome to everybody whosoever will let him come but they all began to make excuse amen well this well that amen praise the Lord let's turn over to Jeremiah let's start with Jeremiah I'm Gonna Change turned the corner for just a minute here if that's all right because remember Paul said that the problem is is that people's affections is in the wrong place set your affections on things above not on things below but so many times a lot of us our joy depends on Earthly things amen and we're not really looking our affection isn't where it ought to be well I hope this Ring's here and everywhere this morning I believe that every one of us need an affection check and affection check where is your affection in Jeremiah 8 and verse 20. better Ben amused is what he preached on the message called why and I want to use a few quotes out of that so he says to harvest is passed summer is in but and we are not saved amen can we say God is supplied God is supplying evidence he's even taking his own picture God took his own picture with a man in this generation when another Baptist was up there and he was putting his finger he put his finger up there and writing about his face and said take a picture of that because I want to put that in the paper and I want to show everybody that I've told him huh took a bunch of pictures that's the only one they come off was God saying I'm with him God himself come down in the pillar of fire look what he did in this generation they are going to be without excuse why because their affection was in the wrong place amen the Harvest is past God has supplied what we need help need up he's the intercessor he's the perfect interception so why aren't more people saved my not only that but we can bring it down to us why aren't we what we ought to be huh for the daughter for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt I am black astonishment had taken a hold of me a hold on me is there no bomb in Gilead is there no physician there why then it's not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ought to be healthy [Applause] we ought to be a healthy Church matter of fact we ought to be a fat Church spiritually fat God says oh come on them eating drink and so forth let thy Soul Delight itself in factness tells the story of the farmer and the two calves one never hard to get any food all winter in the barn the other one was fed up to fit all kinds of stuff when they come out the next spring and that wouldn't explode and everything else are wearing a little skinny cap couldn't barely go ah the smell or an abandoned military the other little fat it can't come out kicked its heels up Manila static in the little skinny cats are such fanaticism why because they got lots of food how many believes every one of us hears sitting here this morning ought to be spiritually fat amen we have plenty of nutrition there's plenty there amen the big problem is people don't want it their affection is somewhere else oh my there's a balm there's a ball mcgillian there is a medicine to cure you well there is a medicine to cure your problem huh but you're so determined that everybody got to get a covert shot that you think they ought to take or they'll lose their job or they're racist or this that or the other you're so determined to give everybody their medicine when we're trying to tell you you better take this medicine because if you don't you're gonna perish and you're gonna burn it out that's what's going to happen period and we'll try to shove it in your mouth and you'll just keep spitting it out you don't want it you pour out the medicine that'll take care of your problem you know I was thinking this week he said I was thinking of how that God how did Jesus Christ one of these days will come and he will fix this world he will fix the problem and then better brother see back there in the prayer room was talking about coven how it has another strain and how to you know it'll end up it'll end up burning out that's his way will it he says well yeah God's converted in other words you're probably going to go all the way to the fire but God's Gonna fix it but he's fixing people right now he's here trying to fix you this morning so they can take you out of here before everybody else has to get a fix yeah you're gonna take your medicine you're gonna eat of the fruit of your own ways God's Gonna burn it with fire that's right ah no you don't have to listen to me this morning but you will feel the fire if you don't when that comes oh you'll think about that if you would hear my voice this morning you will think about that voice that you heard on that internet that one day that I'll feel the fire and here it is amen it'll come back you've got a choice one or the other praise be to God why because God has put a bomb in Gilead he has put high priest up there for everybody whosoever will let him come he's at right even at the end of the book he says they let him that's The Thirst come whosoever will at the very end Let It Go Joffrey's open to everybody amen sure that makes so that the whole world is without excuse they're not going to have an excuse they are not going to be able to say well I didn't no you did everything was provided you that could be provided for you brother Branham after reading this scripture he says I want to kick this subject now I'm going to call it he says you know when God listen I want to call it why you know when God is so good to us to make a way of Escape of danger why do we not accept the way then God asks why I think he has the right to ask why amen he took that y out of there oh my why then is not the health of my daughter recovered why listen for he's went to all his trouble to make this way for our good and place it before us how many knows he went out of it he made sure that everything was right he made it all perfect all just right so that we could have a way of Escape then what are we gonna do amen listen that's the question and there's no better one has a better right to ask it than God if God makes a way of Escape for his people to escape that horrible thing or sickness or death or Eternal death I mean as he's been away for every everything he's made a way for you to live eternally and then the people fail to receive God's going to ask why now that's going to be a great thing on the day of judgment when God is going to ask tonight that's so simple here everybody that will not accept him as our savior and be filled with his Spirit why didn't you do it and we're going to have to give an accountant an answer for it just remember you're going to give an answer for every word that God has written why didn't you why and you'll have no excuse at that day you'll have no excuse on that day amen when there's no excuse It's inexcusable it's indefensible that people will be indefensible but they have no defense because God's going to say why didn't you after I made it perfect I send it on high give you everything that you have need of and yet you turn it down praise be to God remember in Second Kings Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab and fell through the lattice in the upper chamber and so forth Amen in Samaria he was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go and inquire of the god of Equinox the inquire of Beelzebub the god of equine whether I shall recover of the disease and the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tish by it rise go and meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire bills above the god of equine and he said thus saith the law because you've done this you will not come off yet let me tell you something how many believes that in this generation God's saying wasn't there a prophet in the land and thy sin didn't I come down amen right beside them that man of God every time it discern the thoughts intent of the heart did what I did when it was all walking on the earth not three years but 30 or something years Time After Time and your dad desires and they wanted to be a church member they wanted their Pentecostal church and and speaking in tongues as being the evidence of the Holy Ghost didn't I send you a Vindicated Prophet then why huh do you want to have your own way why is your affection in the wrong place with your pride I mean it was the same way with the Pharisees their affection was on being proud and being a somebody rather than taking the Vindicated Jesus Christ in that hour oh my praise the Lord you love him listen to this let's find out why let's find out what's going on why do people turn to things that don't satisfy when God has given you what satisfies amen oh my foreign I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven this is in John 6 and verse 43. that's the day unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he'll believeth on me shall never thirst amen never thirst and never hunger but I say unto you that he also have seen me and believe not all that the father gaveth me shall come to me in him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out amen so let's pull back just a minute ah there was a girl on top am talked about how that she had gotten so old and she had never kissed a boy and never went to a party and never drank a beer and I don't know why she was a psychiatrist or whatever but this psychiatrist he sat down to talk to her and he says you mean you have never been kissed by a boy she said no not one time in all my life you mean you've never drank and then been at a party never it's a girl you don't know what you're missing now remember he was talking about having to go see her because she was trying to kill herself she was going to have to go into shock treatments and everything else parents couldn't even see her anymore it's really got in a pathetic condition because of one person that turned her mind amen all right listen it's because that she she lost her mind and this next week will go into the incubation for shock treatment it's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ on to what the fire psychiatrist was telling their mind he says that's what we are here for this morning is to move our mind move our thinking off the things of the world onto the things of God and to change our thought pattern from the things of the world onto the things of God you know and then he goes talking about life he was preaching how dare some of you who were so little there would be so little to try to quench that blessed Thirst by trying to satisfy it with drinking and smoking and television and running and carrying on and rumbling around and trying to satisfy that Godly thing that God put you in there to thirst for you're just polluting what God has placed in you to receive his spirit let me knows God is putting each and every human being he had to put something in there that we all love to have pleasure we all need satisfaction we all need love we all need care we need we need these things we all have been given affection and written emotions and so forth oh my he says it this way notice what makes you try to have a big time like that it's because God Made You and gave you a crave for life God Made You the makeup that your makeup there isn't a man and a woman on the Earth today never was a man or a woman Earth to Earth he says tonight or on Earth at any time but what had a craving for something a thirsting for pleasure got me that they're seeing you I mean every one of us every human being likes to have what I call perhaps fun we all like pleasure isn't that right God put that in there people that's that's why they're doing what they're doing they're going crazy because they never figure out how to satisfy that thirst that's why the world's gone like it is because they're going to what the god of beelzebuck they go to the devil to get these things satisfied instead of going to the high priest on the guard they go to the devil drinking and closing and adultery and butter Ram says men cheating on their wives wives cheating on their husbands they all do that because there's a thirst in there a lot of them thought they're getting married would take care of that that don't take care of that fairstone are there no marriage laws but no wife will ever satisfy that there's only one I action or not Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost on your hearts the only thing that's satisfied the only thing that'll ever satisfy Hallelujah aren't you glad for that come to this video come to Christ he made it as he made all human beings that way he made Cain that way is that right Cain was that way he had to worship [Music] oh my God praise be to God so listen craving for something thirsting for pleasure God made you that way he made you that thirst so that you thirst out for him how dare you quench the Blessed holy thirst that God put in your heart to try to satisfy it with sin hot there you try to quench that Holy thirst for something by some vulgarity program instead of going to Church of the Living God there are affections people went out with a girl when he was young and she tried to get him to smoke a cigarette tried to get him to drink some beer trying to get him to go to a dance he said no I don't dance no I don't smoke and she says man you don't drink you don't smoke you know that's what do you do for fun what do you tell her go to church with me if you want to know the real believer's fun his pleasure is going to church [Applause] because he always believe we shall we dance we have a good time here if you're right with God if not you're gonna be out now you might be a little secret but man you need to get under a sicker once in a while calm the condemnation until you can get that under the blood and have some fellowship with the heavenly father you'll find out that the Holy Spirit and the relationship with Jesus Christ is better than hunting it's better than fishing it better than Pleasures it's better than drink is better than any drug you'll ever take [Music] Lord Jesus what's our excuse why haven't you got the baptism and all of you why aren't you the happiest person alive in the universe come get me going people into your number this morning you haven't talked to the high priest that perfect high priest enough you haven't looked the shot things that are from above but Christ sits on the right hand of God making his word good oh my God I'd like to tone it down a little just talk like some sophisticated dignified pastor amen what was it excuses excuses you hear them every day you go to church and music's either too loud or it's too quiet it's either too hot or it's too cold the preacher he's either too loud or she's too dignified huh you just can't please some people I mean you can't please a person that ain't filled with the Holy Ghost they're not pleasable why because they're not satisfiable because being satisfied and unsatisfied personally please foreign oh boy can I really Scorch it really really good and God hates a complainer God killed a bunch of Israelites for their murmuring and their complaining it says just get out of my face I'll wipe them off the map Moses and I'll bring up another generation why what is the original reason that God hates a murmurer because he had somebody in heaven that was a murmur the devil was the first complainer I don't like the way things are up here I don't get enough Glory that's why God hates complaining amen murmuring nothing's ever good enough man I wish y'all felt like I did like I do this is good tomorrow the Holy Ghost you get the better it is it's just good I feel almost drunk up here praise be to God heard something brother Brian said I'm just gonna pitch in here maybe we'll close it's already about time listen I was listening to tape and he said something that caught my attention and I thought I gotta I gotta pull that back up sure enough I managed to find it again when you go through different tapes sometimes you don't know which one it was on but uh what was it forget the name of it but he says yes sir we pray so much today we pay so much to the Undertaker let's give some thoughts about the uptaker once in a while he says that'll take us up one of these days he's the only translation the one who can bring us out of the Grave the one who can present us before the father without full without smoke without wrinkle Hallelujah shout he says yes sir anybody that's got good religion shouts y'all remember I'm in the Pharisees they care they like it quiet and they heard all of them people say hosanna bam they're coming on a uh into Jerusalem riding upon the poles antigen again let's add it to the gang what did they say can you keep them quiet tell them to hold their peace what did Jesus say Jesus says if they're quiet the rocks will immediately cry out why because the scripture said that they would cry out and sing Hosanna and if they know somebody is something gonna describe over here I'm getting ready to do a little fun drink by the Tommy I'm practicing this morning people want to just man that they think that they're going to do it all over there if you don't do some of it here I wonder if you're going to be a doing over there Glory shouting going on whatever Jesus is there's always a lot of noise five because it's so good that I want no other makes me love my brother Hallelujah praise be to God so he just got some good shot in religion no doubt wasn't all over we got some more better stuff ready got something about an old colored man used to talk to me down the lane he says you believe in that old shout Religion Don't you Billy I said yes sir and he said you know what next morning he come by he was about 90 years old he says I want to tell you something I said all right what is it rep and he said well I'll tell you he says you take an old rooster and you can tie his feet and nail him down in the boxes any way you want to but said when it starts to get daylight he'll turn over and [Applause] all tied up he'll find a way come on he'll find a way to Crow I said that's right and he said what makes him do that and I said he's a rooster and it's breaking day that's right it's his nature and when a man is born of the spirit of God and has eternal life in him when the Holy Ghost comes you've got to scream out sorry something has happened Glory you get a filling of the Holy Ghost I'm telling you here this morning you just opened that channel open that heart open up mind right now something will happen you'll get a greater portion of the Holy Ghost you may weep you may cry I don't know but something's going to happen I believe in the old time Mama Something's Gotta Have do you believe the good old-time hot salvation brings tears of joy and happiness and peace that passes all understanding for he's the river he's at my everything I just can't praise him enough to say enough about him and what he means to me certainly it's a nature in you when you're born of the spirit of God you've got a nature in you that makes you scream out foreign when we get over there do you reckon that I'm gonna have to get up there or somebody's gonna have to get up there now let everybody shout no there ain't gonna be no coercing hey man I'm shop Ing and praising God when we get over there I think the fruit of Our Lives ought to get more praise to him while we're over here my mama Glory God is good ain't he [Applause] can I say what comes to mind I'd almost rather be up here than down there hey let me tell you something it's it's harder sometimes to get in the spirit and shout and scream when you're sitting here observing and just watching and spectating but when you're up here amen they shouldn't be that way she would all be into it isn't it right but you have you have to I realize you have to put a little extra effort into it I'm here your pastor I'm telling you're gonna have to put a little more effort into it if you want to catch the same Spirit have the same feeling get the baptism the Holy Ghost Amen in a greater way I like what Jesus said oh my I'm gonna go a little longer listen let me say this that Paul he talked about having joy unspeakable and full of Glory isn't that right and yet Paul was so poor and when Jesus came and most of the time when you find when Jesus came that he always talked about I came to give them eternal life and to raise him up at the last day so I call it the primary purpose of Christ's coming sure is this far in the assuring to be a father to us sure needs to care about sins apply all these things but his primary reason is if you have all those things and don't have eternal life it still isn't going to do you any good primary purpose there are primary reason for having Joy is having eternal life and I want to finish the scripture that we read talking about shall never hunger shall never thirst let me just throw this in maybe sometimes the reason that we're getting the things from the Father the way that we should huh and then we're not getting the satisfaction we should is because we're looking too much at the things of this world and we are not looking up we are not looking up there to find our satisfaction our joy our pleasure our healing our comfort how many times she said I'm gonna give you a comforter because I know you all needed I'm everybody need the comfort you know my listen I came down from heaven not to do my own will let me go skip one and I don't want to skip it but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that all day shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out I came I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me now listen to what the will is and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing foreign oh my I'm not there yet I haven't made it home yet but I know that it was Christ that has led me so safe thus far he hasn't lost me yet and I don't believe he's gonna lose me how many is happy about that the fact that he hasn't lost you yet you're still serving God you're still going and you know and have confidence and faith that he'll not lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day again he says this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see it the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I shall raise him up at the last day many different places Dr Jesus talked about he says I am come to give them eternal life and to raise him up the last day let me tell you something our spiritual happiness our walk our Holy Spirit or uh Joy is not determined by the things that we possess here on Earth because Paul he didn't possess anything but yet he had the greatest joy he knew what it was like to be have godliness with contentment is that right and even though he had nothing let me tell you something a lot of times Jesus I don't say that Jesus ever promised he says and I came to give them riches in this world never said that he says blessed are the poor blessed are those and the hunger and thirst and all these other things in this life because they'll be filming that life if anything he promised your hardship struggles I'm in those down through the Dark Ages they didn't have a nice psych we got they had to hide in catacombs and caves and run for their lives for hundreds and hundreds of years their lives were in Jeopardy all the time amen I have a feeling we're gonna creep up closer to the Jeopardy of Our Lives as time goes on folks something else came to me this morning you better enjoy church because we've been told by a prophet of God they'll close places like this up when we come to church we better enjoy able to come to church amen because we don't know how much longer we'll be able to do it well that brother Byler you preached something political we're shutting you down that's what will happen we don't like what you said we'll shut you down oh it'll be something like that's almost that way already huh but anyway please stay there yes on the other hand Jesus didn't have a whole lot of the world's good he was the richest spiritually there was but isn't it strange how did those who were rich and increase with Goods had needed nothing there to Mary wants and put him outside the church in our generation they thought they were spiritually rich they thought they were so rich they speak in tongues and so forth and they were they were where they needed to be they didn't know no Prophet they didn't need discernment they didn't need Jesus coming down and Discerning thoughts and hands of the heart as a matter of fact they said any of our people any of you people from this church if you go to that over there the bread abandons meeting and sponsors will put your name out and Jesus himself would come and vindicate himself that's our church age rich and increased let me tell you where were their affections their meal ticket huh that's what their affection was sad amen but aren't you glad that you've got to thirst in your heart for moral God how many wants to be the fullness of the Christian that you're supposed to be and you have a mediator you have a mediator that can take you further than what you are and you're Christian he's there he's a good mediator and about even Paul says let us come boldly before the throne of grace that we might get help because that's what he's there for to get your help he can be touched by the feeling of infirmity he has been tempted he's going through everything that we have gone through yet without sin amen God bless you stand with me this morning if you will if you get the kind of passion you get the kind of Desire that David had because as a heart Panther for the water Brooks old my soul penteth for thee for what for the Living God he wanted to see the Living God like I said Wednesday isn't that one of the hearts desires Lord we want to see the Living God we want you real in our life we don't want to just come to church and uh go back out and well I feel about the same way as I did when I come in huh no we wouldn't have God come down and be real in our life amen with our eyes closed both here and those lists ask yourself this question is your desire is your passion is your affection where it should be uh could you raise your hand say it's not quite where it should be I'm guilty brother Byler and I ask God to help me help me to set my affections on things above and not on things below just like Paul no matter what he had or didn't have if you don't have a dime in your account if you've got eternal life you're the richest person in the world all the other things will pass away but eternal life will never pass away Lord Jesus you see the hands that are up both here and those listening God that they realize that their affections are just not where they should be they're props Christians and so forth but in the world that we're living in it's too easy to get affections on the things of the world and those things around us our jobs and everything else and our affection isn't the way it's supposed to be with God we repent this morning raising our hands and saying God we're guilty we're sorry where our affections aren't where they're supposed to be Lord help us our affection to be on you Lord Jesus the one that takes care of us the one that we pray to and that intercedes for us and and it takes care of all of our needs that and and it takes care of our problems Lord Jesus and helps us gives us joy gives us peace gives us comfort Lord we don't have to turn to the devil we don't have to turn to the things of the world for our pleasure you are our pleasure Lord help us to seek those things above Lord where you said at the right hand of God where you're on in in power you're the one that controls things Lord in our life Lord and we give you complete control this morning saying God help us from this morning on to make sure that our factions that our treasure is in you and not on the things of this world God and I ask Lord that you'll take all the sins and all the failures of where we failed now and put them in the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we believe God when we confess our sins Lord you're faithful and just to forgive us of our sins Lord and I ask God that put in the bleach of Jesus Christ never to be remembered no more and may we go from here different than what we came in that our affections are more on the things of the bum above than they are from Below in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen I have found his Graces all complete Joy
