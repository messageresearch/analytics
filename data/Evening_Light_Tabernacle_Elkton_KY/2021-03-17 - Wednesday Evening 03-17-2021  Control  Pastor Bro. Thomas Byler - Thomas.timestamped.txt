[40:08] father to be able to hear your word what
[40:10] you would have
[40:11] lord to say to us lord jesus this
[40:13] evening father
[40:15] spirit express father to us the things
[40:17] that you once said
[40:19] lord and we just ask god that you would
[40:21] just bless the meditation of our heart
[40:24] that which you have we feel you have let
[40:26] it
[40:27] bleed upon a heart to speak on lord

[40:44] you'd be with them wherever they are
[40:46] lord jesus and that this may be a time
[40:48] father
[40:49] lord where we just
[40:52] consecrate ourselves and praise you and
[40:55] glorify you and
[40:56] and give you thanks and worship you and
[40:59] praise you lord jesus
[41:01] amen we ask these blessings and favors
[41:03] in jesus name
[41:04] amen and amen turn your
[41:07] bibles if you will to first john
[41:13] first john
[41:32] and we'll begin with chapter 2
[41:36] verse 15 love
[41:39] of not the world neither the things that
[41:41] are in the world
[41:42] if any man love the world the love of
[41:45] the father
[41:45] is not in him for all that is in the
[41:48] world the lust of the flesh
[41:50] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[41:52] of life is
[41:53] not of the father but is of the world
[41:57] the world passes away in the lust
[41:58] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[42:00] god
[42:00] abideth forever amen a prophet taught us
[42:04] that jesus was tempted
[42:06] with all three of these sins
[42:09] amen one is lust the flesh one is the
[42:12] lust of the eye
[42:13] the other is the pride of life now the
[42:16] pride of life is the one we want to
[42:18] focus
[42:18] on until i
[42:22] read that about the pride of life
[42:25] matthew 4 if you want we'll just read
[42:34] me got a frog where really his ministry
[42:37] started
[42:38] uh was led into the wilderness to be
[42:40] tempted of the devil amen
[42:43] and so this is very fitting that jesus
[42:47] had the first goal and to be tempted
[42:50] and to be tested isn't that right before
[42:52] he was ready to
[42:53] uh do a real work for god he had to
[42:55] first go through the trials and the
[42:57] tests
[42:58] reminded me of the message by the
[43:00] brandon preach called
[43:02] possessing the gates of the enemy after
[43:05] a trial
[43:06] amen and in that you'll find that
[43:09] brother branham taught that you know
[43:11] you're not really going to
[43:13] be able to possess the gates of the
[43:14] enemy until you're tested and tried
[43:17] until you have overcome some things amen
[43:21] and that overcoming and attesting and
[43:23] trying of course we know
[43:25] that that molds character is that right
[43:27] and even jesus the first thing he had to
[43:29] do was go through some tests and some
[43:30] trials in that right
[43:31] now let's look at this now verse one
[43:34] then was jesus lit up
[43:35] of the spirit into the wilderness to be
[43:37] tempted of the devil
[43:38] and when he had fast at 40 days and 40
[43:40] nights he was afterwards and hungered
[43:43] and when the tempter came in to him he
[43:46] said if thou be the son of
[43:47] god command these stones to be made
[43:52] into bread and he answered and said it
[43:54] is written man shall not live by bread
[43:56] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[43:59] out of the mouth of god
[44:00] amen then the devil taketh him up into
[44:03] the
[44:04] upon the pinnacle of the temple
[44:09] and let's just go with this now let's
[44:10] let's talk about the first one for just
[44:12] a second if you'll notice lust of the
[44:14] flesh
[44:14] would be something he was very hungry
[44:17] afterwards he was a hunger
[44:18] and if verse two it says afterwards he
[44:20] was hungry so after 40 days you can
[44:23] imagine it would be
[44:24] quite a temptation for him to create
[44:26] some bread and eat it
[44:27] and the devil knew right where to hit
[44:29] him amen and so the
[44:31] lust of the flesh there second one would
[44:34] be the
[44:34] lust of the eye and then the third one
[44:36] the pride of life then the devil taketh
[44:38] him up into the holy city
[44:39] city and setteth him on a pinnacle of
[44:42] the temple says they after
[44:43] say unto him if thou be the son of god
[44:46] cast thyself down for it is written he
[44:50] shall give his ch
[44:51] angels charge over thee and in his hands
[44:53] shall he bear thee up
[44:55] leaves at any time thou dashes foot
[44:57] against a stone
[44:59] amen so lust of the eye talk about the
[45:02] lust of the eye if you'll notice here
[45:04] how that would come into the lust of the
[45:06] eye it would be
[45:08] that he would go and he would do this
[45:09] and he would say well look at me
[45:11] look at who i am amen
[45:15] and you know people who people some
[45:18] people have a lot of pride for one thing
[45:20] and they want to say they get the
[45:21] attitude that look look who i
[45:23] am and you know jesus just didn't do
[45:25] that did he
[45:26] amen he was not wasn't that way so he
[45:28] overcome the lust of the eye
[45:30] and jesus said unto him it is written
[45:33] again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy
[45:35] god
[45:35] the devil again taketh him up into
[45:37] exceedingly high mountain and showeth
[45:39] him all the kingdoms of the world
[45:40] and the glory of them our prophet said
[45:42] that he showed
[45:43] every nation russia america all the
[45:48] nations all kingdoms because he says and
[45:51] he showeth them
[45:52] all the kingdoms of the world so he was
[45:55] according to the word
[45:56] and the glory of them amen now he had
[46:00] that had to be quite a sight to behold
[46:02] and that right for him to show him all
[46:04] the kings of the world
[46:06] and and then and he saith unto him all
[46:08] these things will i give thee
[46:10] that's what brother braham says that it
[46:12] shows
[46:14] that the devil is really the one that
[46:15] controls
[46:17] all the nations am i right amen
[46:20] if thou but fall down and worship me
[46:23] jesus answers and said unto him
[46:24] get thee hands satan for it is written
[46:26] thou shalt worship the lord
[46:28] thy god and him only shalt thou serve
[46:31] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[46:33] angels came and ministered
[46:35] unto him may god had his blessings to
[46:36] the reading word you may be seated
[46:42] so tonight i want to talk about control
[46:44] talk about control
[46:46] and power and authority
[46:49] and character amen
[46:57] so we look at that and we see that first
[47:00] of all i want to read another one if i
[47:02] may because i have quite a few
[47:04] scriptures that i do want to read
[47:06] this is going to be in uh uh
[47:09] saint john let me go to saint john
[47:14] and maybe before we read we'll just talk
[47:16] about this a little bit because
[47:18] if the desire for power the desire
[47:22] to rule all right uh
[47:25] and let me just tie that third one in
[47:28] let me tie the third one in here about
[47:30] pride
[47:31] the third one it says that uh you know
[47:33] and
[47:34] of life all right now how many knows
[47:37] that this
[47:38] pride pride comes with ruling
[47:42] right with rulership with being
[47:45] in authority with
[47:48] uh you know because we know that that's
[47:51] really what it's all about
[47:53] it's about ruling it's about authority
[47:56] it's about control amen
[47:59] that's what it's about and that's the
[48:01] devil for one thing that's what the
[48:03] devil
[48:04] desired in isaiah 14. in isaiah 14 when
[48:08] he was still in heaven
[48:09] his desire was to be like the most high
[48:12] i would be like this god you know and i
[48:14] and he wanted to be worshipped like god
[48:17] i mean that was his desire is to be
[48:19] worshipped to be controlling over people
[48:22] to uh you know to be had to have
[48:25] authority to have
[48:26] power all right and so and and it says
[48:30] that pride was found in him
[48:32] it was pride it's actually pride that
[48:34] brought
[48:35] satan to the place that he wanted to be
[48:37] in a great high
[48:38] place it was pride so that was the third
[48:41] sin and how we tie that in
[48:43] with satan's offering to jesus of all
[48:45] the kingdoms of the world
[48:47] you know he can have them all and he can
[48:49] he can he can be the ruler of it all
[48:52] as long as he falls down and worships
[48:55] him in that right so i'll tell you the
[48:58] simplicity of the devil
[49:00] the simplicity how simple it is uh
[49:05] is it's amazing how simple it is
[49:09] for the devil to have control of us
[49:12] all right because islam paul said
[49:14] whoever
[49:15] you serve whosoever servant you are or
[49:18] whoever you
[49:19] obey is whose servant you are isn't that
[49:22] right
[49:22] so if you somebody tell you to do
[49:24] something you do it well you're like
[49:25] their servant you
[49:26] are doing what they ask you to do and
[49:28] that's all the devil wanted
[49:30] out of just was just do what i asked to
[49:33] do
[49:35] amen because that would be submissive to
[49:38] the devil
[49:39] amen and that would put the devil over
[49:42] jesus and that's all he wanted
[49:43] you know you know he had scriptures you
[49:46] know he says you're hungry
[49:47] you know just speak the word and this
[49:49] will happen then he used a very
[49:51] powerful scripture on the second one
[49:53] because he quoted a scripture
[49:54] about how the angels will have charge
[49:56] over the unless thou would dash thy foot
[49:59] against one stone
[50:00] and he quoted the bible to him isn't
[50:02] that right
[50:03] to try to get him to actually serve and
[50:06] come
[50:07] and obey what he said but jesus wasn't
[50:09] that dumb
[50:10] he you know like probably god said when
[50:12] he came up against christ
[50:14] when he came against david yeah he got
[50:16] him moses yeah he got him
[50:18] many others yeah he got him but when he
[50:20] come up against christ
[50:22] he got his feathers cinched amen
[50:25] and jesus overcome all three of these
[50:28] amen and i want to talk about rulership
[50:30] and authority and control
[50:32] tonight because i do believe that the
[50:34] sons of god also here
[50:36] in saint john 1. amen i'm going to go
[50:40] down a little bit
[50:43] it's saint john 1 in verse 11 it says he
[50:46] came to his own and his own received him
[50:48] not
[50:49] but as many as received him to them gave
[50:52] he
[50:53] power to become the sons of god
[50:58] amen how many knows that power is
[51:00] authority
[51:02] all right when you have authority that's
[51:04] power
[51:05] all right amen and also it is
[51:08] control amen its control to have power
[51:13] to have authority
[51:14] is to have control
[51:20] amen so he said to them gave he the
[51:24] power to become the sons of god
[51:26] even to them that believe on his name
[51:28] which were born not of blood nor of the
[51:30] will of the flesh nor
[51:32] of the will of man but of god
[51:35] praise be to god so he says here that
[51:38] sons of god
[51:38] also have power how many of us have been
[51:41] given
[51:42] power
[51:46] oh my i was trying to think
[51:51] you know let me see if i can find it
[51:56] saint john 3
[51:59] saint john 3 i believe it is
[52:04] not saint john 3 1 john 3 behold what
[52:06] manner of love
[52:08] the father has bestowed upon us that we
[52:10] should
[52:11] be called the sons of god
[52:16] amen therefore the world knoweth us not
[52:19] because it knew
[52:20] him not beloved now
[52:23] are we the sons of god praise be to god
[52:27] you know in the catholic religion i
[52:28] think it's you have to be
[52:30] dead and then they'll make a saint out
[52:32] of you
[52:33] all right they'll make you a saint after
[52:36] you're dead well folks
[52:37] unto the saints which are ephesus and so
[52:39] forth it's what they are we are that now
[52:42] not later we better be saints now
[52:45] because he ain't gonna he gonna make no
[52:47] saint out of whatever the priest says or
[52:49] whatever he tries to do
[52:50] when you're over there you're gonna be
[52:52] what you are but here we are saints now
[52:54] and not only are we saints now but it
[52:56] says that now
[52:58] we are sons of god
[53:02] how many believes that we're sons of god
[53:05] and we have been given
[53:07] power now um
[53:11] i believe it was an axe or matthew no
[53:16] remember i think it's acts the first
[53:18] chapter he talks about you know it says
[53:20] when
[53:20] when when are these things going to be
[53:22] and so forth he says it's not for you to
[53:24] know the times and the seasons but he
[53:27] says but you shall receive
[53:28] power after the holy ghost has come upon
[53:32] you
[53:32] isn't that right so we receive power
[53:35] after the holy ghost has come upon us
[53:37] i want to go over just a few things for
[53:39] wednesday night we're going to try not
[53:41] to be too long but this is kind of a
[53:42] long message so
[53:43] bear with me but we already know
[53:46] there's some things we want to know and
[53:48] this message tonight to the
[53:50] the message tonight is about trying to
[53:52] pick us up and take us all just a little
[53:54] higher is that okay
[53:56] take us a little higher take it a little
[53:58] deeper get us a little closer
[54:00] because if that's not the direction
[54:02] we're going then we're going the wrong
[54:03] way
[54:04] amen and it's about so we see him we
[54:07] already know
[54:08] i wrote around here the things that we
[54:10] already know things we already know we
[54:13] know that when jesus died on calvary
[54:15] when he sent out the baptism of the holy
[54:17] ghost amen when he when he died on
[54:19] calvary he when he said it was finished
[54:21] we realized
[54:22] that jesus christ right there he
[54:25] stripped the devil of
[54:27] any power that he had now he had
[54:31] authority and he had
[54:32] power over every body every man woman
[54:35] and child they had a nature they
[54:36] couldn't get away from it and as long as
[54:38] you didn't get the baptism of the holy
[54:40] ghost
[54:40] you had a nature that you had to deal
[54:42] with and you could never completely
[54:44] overcome
[54:45] amen but on calvary he stripped him of
[54:48] every authority that he had every power
[54:51] that he had
[54:54] amen so many know we're
[54:57] fighting a powerless opponent
[55:03] but we know that that is only through
[55:06] christ jesus that's
[55:07] only through a new birth only by the
[55:10] holy ghost is the devil powerless
[55:12] because if
[55:13] i'll tell you this right now it don't
[55:15] matter how much you try to fight the
[55:17] devil
[55:17] it don't matter how much you try to be a
[55:19] christian it don't matter how much you
[55:21] try to do the right thing
[55:22] if you haven't got the holy ghost in
[55:24] your heart you will come out
[55:26] wrong it'll never be right you'll never
[55:30] get it right
[55:33] no matter how much you try amen
[55:36] because if you could get it right why
[55:38] would we need the holy ghost
[55:40] huh we know it takes the power of the
[55:43] holy ghost when jesus did that on
[55:45] calvary we know that he was stripped
[55:46] and we already know that whenever a
[55:48] person becomes born again
[55:50] being born not of the will of the flesh
[55:52] but born by the spirit
[55:53] amen when you become a child of god god
[55:56] gives you a checkbook
[55:59] and you know a checkbook don't do you a
[56:02] bit of good unless you've got the
[56:03] signature on that checkbook
[56:05] amen but god give you a checkbook
[56:10] amen let's read where the bible talks
[56:14] about our checkbook would that be all
[56:15] right
[56:16] turn with me to st john
[56:23] 14. this is just one of many places
[56:33] 14.
[56:37] all right saints four john 14 12 verily
[56:40] verily
[56:42] i say unto you he that believeth on me
[56:44] the works that i do
[56:46] shall he do also and greater works shall
[56:49] he
[56:49] than thee shall you do because i go unto
[56:51] the father
[56:52] and whatsoever ye shall ask
[56:55] in my name
[57:03] amen whatever you have faith to sign on
[57:06] that's what you'll be able to get from
[57:08] god
[57:10] and he says i will do it now
[57:13] [Laughter]
[57:14] if we look and if we lo if if you love
[57:17] me keep my commandments now
[57:18] just that scripture long boy it is it is
[57:21] as
[57:22] powerful and it is as good as john 3
[57:25] 16 he whosoever and men shall come you
[57:28] know
[57:28] whosoever i forgot so loved the world
[57:31] that he gave his only begotten son that
[57:33] whosoever should believe in him
[57:34] should not perish but have everlasting
[57:36] life in other words he said whosoever
[57:43] it's a powerful scripture i mean that's
[57:45] saying
[57:46] anybody everybody
[57:51] here is saying whatever you ask
[57:58] pretty powerful
[58:02] now let me read you a quote
[58:07] oh yeah he said brother bannon makes a
[58:09] statement he says you know
[58:10] the power that'll raise us up is
[58:14] in us right now amen how many believes
[58:17] that
[58:18] amen if the same spirit that raised
[58:20] christ from the dead dwell in you
[58:23] it's that same spirit that rolls him up
[58:26] we have that same power now through the
[58:28] holy ghost
[58:29] all right right now we are in heavenly
[58:33] places
[58:34] and we are now in the power of the
[58:37] resurrection
[58:38] if there wasn't a law to that the sons
[58:41] of god
[58:42] and the others of god he says would
[58:44] create
[58:45] them a world out here and go live a
[58:48] private life on it
[58:52] all right my you have the power
[58:55] in you to do it oh my
[58:59] but the power is controlled by a law
[59:02] and that is the law of faith how many
[59:04] knows you have to have the faith to be
[59:06] able to do it
[59:08] praise be to god so he says you know
[59:10] there's power in us that we could
[59:12] actually
[59:13] go and live on the world amen a private
[59:15] life
[59:16] if we had the faith for it
[59:19] amen praise the lord
[59:24] lord so we want to look at that for just
[59:26] a second
[59:27] amen we talk about christ first of all
[59:30] what we already know is that it is there
[59:34] as long as he's on that mercy seat i
[59:37] believe it's there
[59:39] now there's a lot of people in the 1960s
[59:41] believe that he came off the mercy seat
[59:45] wouldn't it change your whole thinking
[59:47] if you thought he wasn't there anymore
[59:48] your prayers couldn't be heard what kind
[59:52] of person would we be would chase change
[59:53] the whole thing
[59:56] people quit preaching are you the only
[59:58] one that should preach
[1:00:01] should we just play tapes i think we got
[1:00:03] the answer no
[1:00:04] no by no means huh
[1:00:08] but listen so as long as on that mercy
[1:00:10] seat listen
[1:00:11] then that's available amen and and what
[1:00:14] i want to say is
[1:00:14] this listen we already know the other
[1:00:17] thing is that when he died
[1:00:18] and when he saves you amen and when he
[1:00:22] gives you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:25] it is a rip a work of
[1:00:28] bringing back all right it is a
[1:00:31] work of redemption that's why even in
[1:00:34] revelation he says the book that was
[1:00:36] sealed was
[1:00:36] a book of redemption that book was
[1:00:39] sealed and
[1:00:40] it was the book of redemption it was a
[1:00:43] book of bringing back sons and daughters
[1:00:45] of god
[1:00:45] to god bring us back into a relationship
[1:00:48] with god
[1:00:50] amen and the kind of relationship that
[1:00:53] adam had before the fall amen i picked
[1:00:56] this message up on brother brad's
[1:00:58] preaching sunday morning
[1:00:59] when he's talking about adam could just
[1:01:01] say look
[1:01:02] uh you know the third i think it was a
[1:01:04] waterfall or something you know i'd like
[1:01:05] to have a waterfall over here
[1:01:07] i'd like to have this over here and i
[1:01:09] like to have that you know he could just
[1:01:10] speak it
[1:01:12] and i begin to thinking of how that
[1:01:13] actually according to the scriptures
[1:01:16] we're in that place now
[1:01:22] oh my faith be to god look i may not be
[1:01:26] able to speak to mountains and throw
[1:01:28] them into the sea like jesus said you
[1:01:30] could
[1:01:30] if you have faith huh
[1:01:33] i might not be able to do this but i
[1:01:35] know one thing and that is god has done
[1:01:37] a redemptive work
[1:01:39] in here
[1:01:44] well i'll tell you what if you know that
[1:01:46] without a shadow of a doubt
[1:01:48] the ceiling ain't hardly high enough for
[1:01:51] you
[1:01:53] it is exciting it is so awesome to think
[1:01:56] and to know
[1:01:57] that god has done a work for you and in
[1:02:00] you
[1:02:01] of redeeming you back and we know the
[1:02:03] prophet told us that the bible says you
[1:02:05] know
[1:02:06] what so everything you ask now we're
[1:02:07] back on the same conditions adam was
[1:02:10] which i speak it and it'll be
[1:02:13] and how many knows that we have been
[1:02:15] shown that more now
[1:02:16] than in luther's time or wesley's time i
[1:02:19] believe it was uh
[1:02:20] one of those one of those four runners i
[1:02:22] don't know if it was john wesley that
[1:02:23] was riding his horse
[1:02:24] i'm thinking and he fell in the little
[1:02:26] hole and he broke that horse and the
[1:02:27] horse broke his leg
[1:02:28] he got out and he prayed for it and he
[1:02:30] was healed and he rode on
[1:02:33] hello but we have much more than a
[1:02:35] broken leg and a horse folks we have
[1:02:37] deserving to tell you what your name is
[1:02:39] who you come from
[1:02:40] millions times over millions upon
[1:02:43] millions of time
[1:02:44] that jesus came amen in our generation
[1:02:47] they did the very same sign that he did
[1:02:49] when he was at the woman with the well
[1:02:51] he's earning her thoughts intents of the
[1:02:52] heart
[1:02:56] oh my that's why we have so much
[1:03:00] confidence in what the prophet said
[1:03:02] is because god came and he proved what
[1:03:04] he said
[1:03:06] nobody could do that and live with him
[1:03:08] that's why we hang on to his every word
[1:03:11] if there was any i was thinking today if
[1:03:13] boy if brother brandon wanted to see
[1:03:14] somebody
[1:03:15] he could have deceived a multitude of
[1:03:17] people
[1:03:18] because data followed him people
[1:03:22] was deceived and he tried to keep him on
[1:03:24] a straight track
[1:03:25] hello he'd have to come and straighten
[1:03:27] him out so no i'm not jesus
[1:03:30] this is you know i'm just your brother
[1:03:32] it's jesus that comes to the platform
[1:03:34] and deserves i am not
[1:03:36] lord don't you call me jesus don't
[1:03:38] baptize but people did people always go
[1:03:40] off on the deep end
[1:03:42] huh but he stayed humble
[1:03:46] anyway so back to our thought when we
[1:03:49] think about
[1:03:50] our lord and what he did and how did he
[1:03:52] redeem he did every
[1:03:54] he did a work of bringing us back
[1:03:57] into the place of power the back to the
[1:04:00] place
[1:04:01] of authority back to the place of
[1:04:04] control
[1:04:06] that's what i want to talk about talk
[1:04:07] about control
[1:04:09] because that's ultimately what it's
[1:04:10] about
[1:04:12] let me just talk politics for just a
[1:04:14] second we all know that through this
[1:04:15] epidemic
[1:04:17] that our government and certain certain
[1:04:19] factions especially
[1:04:22] were very happy without with being able
[1:04:25] to tell you
[1:04:26] what to do even though it was contrary
[1:04:28] to the constitution
[1:04:31] they took great pleasure that was
[1:04:32] awesome man they even said boy we
[1:04:35] if we were in office we would take great
[1:04:36] opportunity of this
[1:04:38] we would really get to get the greatest
[1:04:39] we'd take every opportunity on this
[1:04:42] huh why because it's the devil and it's
[1:04:45] all about
[1:04:46] telling you what to do
[1:04:49] that's what the devil wants that's what
[1:04:51] the devil has wanted from the very start
[1:04:53] because if you do what he tells you to
[1:04:54] do guess what you're his servant and the
[1:04:56] catholics they don't care if you're
[1:04:57] catholic protestant
[1:04:59] or or pentecostal or message they don't
[1:05:01] care what they used to they used to burn
[1:05:03] who had the snake if you didn't
[1:05:05] kiss their crucifix and and do what they
[1:05:07] want you to do but now
[1:05:09] they know and the devil's gotten smarter
[1:05:10] and he knows that look as long as you
[1:05:12] side with him you're going to the same
[1:05:14] place you're still
[1:05:15] serving them anyway you can keep your
[1:05:17] religion just come subject to him
[1:05:20] amen he's shrewd as long as he can get
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:25] to listen to him and obey what he wants
[1:05:28] you to do
[1:05:29] you're his servant he's got you amen
[1:05:32] he's got you
[1:05:34] and it's so simple we bring it down to
[1:05:37] where it's just the thoughts that come
[1:05:38] into our mind
[1:05:40] hello just think his thoughts
[1:05:43] and let those thoughts rule you
[1:05:47] and your servant of the devil he will
[1:05:50] serve his purpose
[1:05:51] perfectly the only way you can really
[1:05:54] discern it
[1:05:55] is by the word of god amen
[1:05:59] so look so now we've oh my when i got
[1:06:01] into this i thought
[1:06:02] we already know we could preach a
[1:06:04] message on what we already know
[1:06:08] we already know that the sons of god
[1:06:10] have been given this power
[1:06:11] we have already been restored back but
[1:06:14] if you'll remember over in galatians it
[1:06:16] talked about and paul talked about
[1:06:18] how that when his son is born he is
[1:06:21] under tutors and governors
[1:06:23] isn't that right he's under tutors and
[1:06:25] governors
[1:06:26] until he gets to a certain place
[1:06:29] and in the orient they used to have a
[1:06:31] certain time in a certain place and when
[1:06:33] that son
[1:06:34] proved that he was really a good son and
[1:06:36] worthy of
[1:06:37] handling the affairs then they would
[1:06:40] take him into a public place
[1:06:42] and they would what they would call
[1:06:43] adopt him in that right
[1:06:45] that's why brother ben preached many a
[1:06:46] message on adoption
[1:06:49] he was trying to get to the pentecostals
[1:06:51] especially
[1:06:52] amen that you can't just look speak in
[1:06:55] tongues and this that and the other and
[1:06:57] oh hallelujah and out and enjoy all the
[1:07:00] blessings and then that that doesn't
[1:07:02] mean you're a mature son
[1:07:04] you're just starting now you have to be
[1:07:06] tried you have to be tested
[1:07:10] and then let me say this they never did
[1:07:13] get to the place of maturity
[1:07:16] man the devil got them before they got
[1:07:18] off the ground very far so to speak
[1:07:21] and they're right they had all this but
[1:07:24] it wasn't very long
[1:07:25] until they had their differences once
[1:07:29] but he was coming on two different
[1:07:32] pieces
[1:07:33] they all made their demand in
[1:07:35] nominations and everything else
[1:07:37] is that right their own system their own
[1:07:40] ways
[1:07:43] and they all died amen
[1:07:47] that's what the devil did because they
[1:07:49] didn't come to maturity
[1:07:51] it doesn't matter if he's coming on a
[1:07:52] white cloud or if he's coming on a white
[1:07:54] horse now how many knows in the
[1:07:57] revelation it says that he's coming on a
[1:07:58] white horse revelation 19.
[1:08:00] and another place in the bible says hey
[1:08:02] you know when he left in the book of
[1:08:03] acts he says he was received up
[1:08:05] into heaven in a cloud and the angel
[1:08:08] said as you have seen him go
[1:08:10] that's how he's going to come back if he
[1:08:11] went on the cloud he'll come back on the
[1:08:13] clock
[1:08:14] and boy you could have argument brother
[1:08:15] bro
[1:08:17] huh but the pentecostals never did get
[1:08:21] over being able to disagree with each
[1:08:23] other
[1:08:24] and still love each other they had to
[1:08:26] part ways
[1:08:28] huh
[1:08:33] so you see i i think i thought about
[1:08:35] this and
[1:08:36] so how many believes that before we are
[1:08:38] really ready for authority
[1:08:41] we have to be tested we have
[1:08:45] to be tried we have to be schooled
[1:08:48] i mean to see what we'll do in those
[1:08:51] trials and those
[1:08:52] tests amen
[1:08:55] and you know i say that because you know
[1:08:57] i would love to be able to say tonight
[1:08:58] you know boy i'll tell you what the
[1:09:00] people in this church we go through
[1:09:01] trial and we go through tests
[1:09:02] and we just boy we just really clear
[1:09:04] them we took we really
[1:09:06] do good no matter what comes
[1:09:10] no matter what goes there's nothing but
[1:09:13] the love of god in our hearts
[1:09:15] and we overcome every obstacle can we
[1:09:18] say that tonight
[1:09:22] no even when we come and overcome a lot
[1:09:26] of them there's still some we don't
[1:09:27] overcome
[1:09:28] there's still some things that come our
[1:09:29] way that oh boy that one got me
[1:09:32] amen but listen we have to come to what
[1:09:35] adoption come to the place
[1:09:37] of maturity because i believe that as
[1:09:40] christ coming is
[1:09:41] growing nigh the closer it comes the
[1:09:44] more i
[1:09:45] long to be at the place where i can say
[1:09:48] that no matter what comes my way
[1:09:50] no matter what happens
[1:09:53] i can practice what i preach and that is
[1:09:56] to be completely surrendered to christ
[1:09:59] no matter what happens no matter what my
[1:10:02] battle is
[1:10:03] i never have to worry i never have to
[1:10:06] fret
[1:10:06] i don't have to be nervous i don't have
[1:10:08] to be upset i don't have to be tossing
[1:10:10] turning my
[1:10:11] in my bed i don't have to lose sleep
[1:10:14] because i have learned how to commit it
[1:10:16] like that woman did
[1:10:17] to god god is yours
[1:10:22] i don't know about you but man to know
[1:10:24] that cast all your cares upon you
[1:10:26] that is a glorious thing to be able to
[1:10:28] do
[1:10:30] because you're either going to cast it
[1:10:31] on his cares or you're going to try to
[1:10:33] solve the problem
[1:10:35] i'll solve this problem you'll get in
[1:10:38] the way
[1:10:39] that's getting yourself in the way i'm
[1:10:41] going to take care of this problem
[1:10:44] huh that that god ain't even nowhere
[1:10:46] around
[1:10:48] huh hey the devil you know that's how
[1:10:51] the devil works
[1:10:53] he tries to get us in our problem no
[1:10:55] matter how much but i want to be able to
[1:10:57] say lord
[1:10:58] because if i'm going to be an old man if
[1:11:01] i'm going to be mature christian
[1:11:03] i have to learn to surrender everything
[1:11:06] no matter what it is
[1:11:08] to the lord and be free
[1:11:14] there is great freedom
[1:11:17] and happiness in the fact that we know
[1:11:20] that he is in us doing it
[1:11:25] my problem's his problem
[1:11:29] i thought for sure brother brad was
[1:11:30] going to say that magic word
[1:11:33] akunu matata
[1:11:37] mean don't worry for the rest of your
[1:11:39] days
[1:11:40] well yeah i know but anyway
[1:11:43] oh boy i hope everybody liked that
[1:11:45] because if you didn't you really really
[1:11:47] got to choke on that one aren't you but
[1:11:49] let me tell you something
[1:11:51] it is so awesome to know that jesus
[1:11:53] christ is taking care of
[1:11:55] all your problems all of whatever it is
[1:12:00] so what else do we know how many wants
[1:12:01] to hear some more
[1:12:03] we know that we got to come to that
[1:12:04] place and god has to test us
[1:12:07] god has to try us amen
[1:12:12] because we do want power how many wants
[1:12:15] power
[1:12:16] how many wants authority how many wants
[1:12:18] control the bible says you know in
[1:12:20] revelations there that
[1:12:21] they lived and they ruled and reigned
[1:12:24] with christ
[1:12:25] for a thousand years how many believe
[1:12:27] we're going to rule
[1:12:29] as we sang that song amazing grace house
[1:12:32] read the sound let's say the reds like
[1:12:33] me
[1:12:34] when we've been there ten thousand years
[1:12:36] right shining that's the sun we have no
[1:12:38] last day to sing
[1:12:39] praise bible says we're gonna rule and
[1:12:42] reign
[1:12:43] with christ in other words we're gonna
[1:12:45] be in a place of authority
[1:12:49] a place of power over there
[1:12:53] and i tried to imagine i tried to
[1:12:57] imagine
[1:12:58] what it's going to be like in heaven
[1:13:04] cities huh outside of the city
[1:13:09] uh the city that comes down
[1:13:13] 15 miles high and so forth light the sun
[1:13:16] will be gone the moon will be gone the
[1:13:17] stars will be gone
[1:13:18] just the light from that sun and from
[1:13:21] the sun of god will
[1:13:22] lighten the whole world
[1:13:26] huh ruling and reigning
[1:13:30] let's talk about that for a minute
[1:13:31] scripture that tells us
[1:13:33] that we're going to rule in matthew
[1:13:39] in matthew you don't have to go to it
[1:13:41] matthew 25 20 20
[1:13:43] 5 21 says this is after the five talents
[1:13:47] and so forth and
[1:13:48] he gained this that and the other then
[1:13:50] he says his lord said unto him
[1:13:51] well done thy good and faithful servant
[1:13:55] god has been faithful over a few things
[1:13:58] i will make the
[1:13:59] ruler over many things
[1:14:02] enter thou into the joy of the lord
[1:14:06] praise be to god
[1:14:10] somebody knows that if you're faithful
[1:14:13] in little things
[1:14:14] faithful in a few things god's going to
[1:14:17] make you rule
[1:14:18] over many things
[1:14:21] but before we're ready to rule before
[1:14:24] we're ready to have that power
[1:14:26] that authority over there
[1:14:30] we have to have that power and that
[1:14:32] authority
[1:14:33] here
[1:14:40] one more thing before i go on when i
[1:14:43] thought about what heaven's going to be
[1:14:44] like
[1:14:46] the eons of time city i don't know how
[1:14:48] it's all going to be that's just my
[1:14:49] imagination
[1:14:51] imagine what i imagine you probably
[1:14:53] imagine something a little different
[1:14:54] it'll be different we thought but this
[1:14:56] one thing i know for sure it'll be much
[1:14:57] better than any of us can imagine
[1:15:00] or dream but if jesus of god himself
[1:15:04] which is jesus if he come and he made
[1:15:06] this world we've been here for 6 000
[1:15:08] years into sinful condition dying
[1:15:11] our life's like a vapor it just comes
[1:15:13] and it goes we're gone
[1:15:14] hello amen any but he's got sons and
[1:15:17] daughters that he
[1:15:18] has created and that he's redeeming to
[1:15:20] himself and he's getting ready if he
[1:15:22] would
[1:15:23] do that for 6 000 years imagine what
[1:15:26] it's going to be like when we get to the
[1:15:27] other side
[1:15:28] it is going to be a thing of glory it is
[1:15:31] going to be a beautiful thing
[1:15:33] and he's getting us ready we know that
[1:15:35] this is all just a testing ground and
[1:15:36] that right
[1:15:37] a trying ground and let me just say this
[1:15:40] while it comes to my mind and the
[1:15:42] number one thing the most thing that i
[1:15:44] can possibly think of
[1:15:46] that god is looking for out of us is
[1:15:51] character character
[1:15:56] nerd prophet is the only thing we're
[1:15:59] going to take with us
[1:16:00] is our character what kind of a
[1:16:04] character are we not a good question
[1:16:07] what kind of a
[1:16:08] boy he's a character isn't he she's a
[1:16:11] character
[1:16:12] there are some characters out there
[1:16:15] look at the world how many know the
[1:16:16] world is completely out of control
[1:16:18] people are completely out of control hey
[1:16:20] one nose ring ain't enough we gotta have
[1:16:22] two
[1:16:22] you know and those people that have
[1:16:24] their paint their face so painted up
[1:16:26] so bad you don't even have a face they
[1:16:28] got these earlobes you know the big
[1:16:30] round things and
[1:16:31] in the nose even in the nose you got big
[1:16:33] things that just them guys just went to
[1:16:35] the max of what those others are heading
[1:16:37] for
[1:16:39] one tattoo ain't enough you gotta have
[1:16:41] another one another one you know
[1:16:43] they're out of control they got no
[1:16:44] control
[1:16:46] they had control they wouldn't do that
[1:16:47] stuff in the first place
[1:16:50] amen how many have control
[1:16:56] that's right they have control
[1:17:01] all right he'll make him ruler
[1:17:04] over many things we know that without
[1:17:07] we're not going to rule unless we suffer
[1:17:09] unless god tries
[1:17:10] and tests us characters and doesn't come
[1:17:14] by the way of
[1:17:15] of having it easy and having it nice
[1:17:19] huh no that's never how character comes
[1:17:23] it's through hardships it's through
[1:17:24] trials that's why a lot at all
[1:17:27] but boyle boy so to speak
[1:17:30] if we can get to that place that god is
[1:17:34] looking for us because we're going to
[1:17:35] meet him one of these days in the sky
[1:17:37] you're just simply not going to be not
[1:17:38] ready huh
[1:17:41] you got to be ready be ready
[1:17:44] for you know not the day or the hour be
[1:17:45] ready jesus be ready
[1:17:47] that's what i'm interested in is being
[1:17:50] ready
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:56] now let's go to a scripture we'll begin
[1:17:58] to get down to
[1:18:00] where we live proverbs
[1:18:03] 16 if you want to go with me proverbs
[1:18:06] 16.
[1:18:10] i'll just go ahead and read it if you
[1:18:14] here in a second verse 31
[1:18:18] 16 a proverb says the horror head is a
[1:18:20] crown of glory
[1:18:21] if it be found in the way of
[1:18:22] righteousness he that is slow to anger
[1:18:26] is better than the mighty and he that
[1:18:28] ruleth his
[1:18:29] spirit then he that taketh a
[1:18:33] city amen
[1:18:37] he that ruleth his spirit
[1:18:40] that he that takes the city
[1:18:44] how many knows we don't really control
[1:18:46] ourselves
[1:18:48] we don't really control ourselves
[1:18:50] whatever spirit in you air
[1:18:52] that's what controls us but guess what
[1:18:56] we do have a choice we have to choose
[1:18:59] what spirit is going to rule us
[1:19:03] and if you can control
[1:19:06] your spirit then you're better than
[1:19:10] david with
[1:19:11] all of his mighty army and surrounding a
[1:19:13] city
[1:19:14] and taking a city of ten thousand men
[1:19:18] taking that city oh that's powerful
[1:19:20] that's glorious the bible says
[1:19:22] you're better than the man that takes
[1:19:24] the city
[1:19:25] you're more powerful if you can control
[1:19:28] your spirit
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:41] david could kill bears and goliaths and
[1:19:44] kill
[1:19:45] all kinds of armies and all of these
[1:19:47] things but yet
[1:19:49] he didn't control his lust
[1:19:53] when he seen bathsheba he didn't have
[1:19:56] the strength
[1:19:58] to rule that spirit
[1:20:01] amen the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:20:04] the eye and the brighter life three main
[1:20:06] sins
[1:20:08] how many knows it's very hard to have
[1:20:10] self-control
[1:20:13] to control yourself the bible says to
[1:20:15] have temperance
[1:20:16] to have self-control
[1:20:25] self-control control over ourselves
[1:20:28] this is where this is where it's at
[1:20:33] is about controlling ourself
[1:20:39] whether we're really ready to reign or
[1:20:42] not
[1:20:42] rule or not
[1:20:49] paul he says have we not power
[1:20:53] to lead about a sister a wife
[1:20:57] as well as perhaps other apostles amen
[1:21:01] how many should have the power to do
[1:21:03] that
[1:21:07] the bible says you know that a pastor
[1:21:10] a bishop is to rule his own house well
[1:21:13] because if he can't control and rule his
[1:21:15] own house
[1:21:16] how can he rule the
[1:21:19] house of god
[1:21:23] i heard brother bam say the bible says
[1:21:24] in genesis he says adam
[1:21:26] shall rule over thee
[1:21:29] to rule over your life amen
[1:21:34] rule over your family rule over yourself
[1:21:38] rule over a sister you got the power to
[1:21:40] do that we should have that kind of
[1:21:41] authority
[1:21:44] boy
[1:21:47] amen so but again open that door for a
[1:21:50] week
[1:21:53] i figured i'd do that but listen you
[1:21:55] know
[1:21:56] well my wife my wife no
[1:22:00] no don't don't give me that my wife
[1:22:02] isn't what i what she should be
[1:22:05] guess who you blame i'm gonna take the
[1:22:07] blame
[1:22:09] huh until i have found everything that i
[1:22:12] possibly can
[1:22:13] and i can tell you this i don't know
[1:22:14] about you all think sometimes my wife
[1:22:16] says boy they must think we really fuss
[1:22:18] and fight i says no
[1:22:19] but i just use it for examples but i
[1:22:22] my wife loves me more now than she ever
[1:22:25] has and i love her more than what we did
[1:22:26] when we got married
[1:22:28] hello we love each other very very much
[1:22:33] because i care about her feelings i care
[1:22:34] about emotions and everything else
[1:22:36] and it means a lot
[1:22:40] when she when she comes up and she said
[1:22:42] honey i really love you
[1:22:44] thank you for everything you do for me
[1:22:46] i'm saying thank you honey
[1:22:48] for everything you do let me tell you
[1:22:50] something i believe that we as men have
[1:22:52] to be able to have enough power
[1:22:54] to lead a wife to leader to christ to
[1:22:57] lead isn't that right
[1:22:59] if we don't have power to lead our wives
[1:23:01] how are we going to rule a city
[1:23:04] or our children hello
[1:23:08] amen by example even paul says don't we
[1:23:11] have power to do that
[1:23:13] sure we do or to control our spirit
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] it's a powerful thing when you think
[1:23:22] about it
[1:23:26] praise the lord
[1:23:30] but it says i think the biggest fault
[1:23:33] that i find with many churches
[1:23:34] especially the real church that's born
[1:23:36] again
[1:23:36] they don't know who they are they don't
[1:23:38] realize what privilege that god has
[1:23:39] given us
[1:23:40] amen how many beliefs we just don't
[1:23:44] tap into sometimes the privilege that
[1:23:46] god has given us we don't even realize
[1:23:48] it every redemptive blessing he died for
[1:23:51] all right let's talk about power just
[1:23:53] for a minute again when we think about
[1:23:54] it
[1:23:54] brother man makes a statement he says
[1:23:56] you know people they want
[1:23:58] power but they don't really know what
[1:23:59] power is they don't really know
[1:24:02] what goes with it the way up is down
[1:24:06] if you want power see how humble you can
[1:24:08] be
[1:24:09] amen how many knows if it's easy to
[1:24:12] preach let's surrender ourselves
[1:24:14] completely the christ
[1:24:16] sure we can preach that but doing that's
[1:24:18] a different story
[1:24:20] why because how many knows the biggest
[1:24:22] battle that we ever fight it's where
[1:24:25] right here right here
[1:24:28] in our minds we buy to fight a big
[1:24:31] battle the devil
[1:24:32] always putting thoughts in our mind
[1:24:36] always hunting us with mind and that's
[1:24:38] how spirits come home that's how spirit
[1:24:39] comes
[1:24:41] is through our mind and through our
[1:24:43] hearts
[1:24:45] then he drops down into our hearts
[1:24:49] james i believe said
[1:24:53] listen let me just finish that quote he
[1:24:55] says just get away from all your
[1:24:57] worldly thinking humble yourself before
[1:24:59] god and then you've got more power than
[1:25:01] the man that runs all over the building
[1:25:02] and makes a great big bunch of noise
[1:25:05] huh see because you've been able to
[1:25:08] conquer
[1:25:10] yourself and commit yourself to christ
[1:25:14] see to humble yourself before him
[1:25:18] that's truly power
[1:25:26] amen to be able to humble yourself
[1:25:28] before christ
[1:25:30] that's truly power
[1:25:40] james 3 and verse 2 says
[1:25:43] for in many things we offend all now if
[1:25:46] any man offend not in word
[1:25:49] the same is a perfect man and able also
[1:25:53] to bridle the whole body
[1:25:56] i mean there's another place i've tried
[1:25:58] i thought about where it was i couldn't
[1:25:59] find it but it says the bible says
[1:26:00] a man that cannot riddle his
[1:26:04] tongue it says this man's religion is
[1:26:07] vain
[1:26:10] it's right here behold we put bits in
[1:26:13] horses mouths
[1:26:14] and they obey us and we turn them about
[1:26:17] their whole big old horse
[1:26:19] by simply pulling a little bit right
[1:26:21] just a little bit here a little bit
[1:26:22] there they turn that big old horse
[1:26:24] could stomp you in the ground
[1:26:29] then he says behold we have ships
[1:26:33] that though they be so great driven of
[1:26:35] fierce winds yet they are turned about
[1:26:37] with a
[1:26:37] little governor the little helm
[1:26:41] even so the tongue is a little member it
[1:26:43] boasts this great thing behold
[1:26:44] what a great what how great a matter a
[1:26:47] little fire kindleth the tongue is a
[1:26:49] fire a world of iniquity
[1:26:50] so is a tongue among our members that it
[1:26:53] defileth the whole body
[1:26:55] and set it on court on fire the course
[1:26:57] of nature and is set on course
[1:27:00] of the fire of hell of every
[1:27:04] kind of beasts and a birds and of
[1:27:05] serpents and things in the seas tame
[1:27:08] and have been tamed of mankind but the
[1:27:10] tongue can no man
[1:27:12] tame it is an unruly evil
[1:27:16] how many knows the pharisees when they
[1:27:17] would speak it was because of what
[1:27:21] was down in their heart it was because
[1:27:23] of their spirit that they had
[1:27:25] you speak why they said what they said
[1:27:28] let me talk to you five minutes talk to
[1:27:31] me back five minutes
[1:27:33] and i can tell you as a pastor i can
[1:27:34] tell you whether you got the holy ghost
[1:27:36] or not
[1:27:38] huh whether you got a spirit of god or
[1:27:41] whether you don't have the spirit of god
[1:27:43] why because out of the abundance of the
[1:27:45] heart meal
[1:27:46] speaker amen so if you can control this
[1:27:50] if this is under control
[1:27:52] right here
[1:27:57] there's no other part of the body the
[1:27:58] bible says that you can't control
[1:28:01] it is it uncontrolled it is the hardest
[1:28:04] things to tame
[1:28:05] the hardest things to control amen
[1:28:10] praise the lord i don't know about you
[1:28:12] but i say lord i want to be completely
[1:28:15] in your control because it's not god
[1:28:19] it's not me living it's christ living in
[1:28:21] me
[1:28:22] amen let me just say something else
[1:28:25] tonight
[1:28:27] i've been pastor here in 29 years this
[1:28:30] october 20th
[1:28:32] will be 30 years my 30-year anniversary
[1:28:35] amen and i want to say this
[1:28:40] by god's grace
[1:28:44] went through many battles fought many
[1:28:47] things did many things and
[1:28:49] had many attitudes many times
[1:28:53] took the wrong spirit wrong attitude
[1:28:56] come out here
[1:28:57] preach wrong attitude huh
[1:29:01] but one thing i've learned brother glenn
[1:29:04] i have learned
[1:29:06] that when thoughts come into my head
[1:29:09] that upset
[1:29:10] me thoughts come into my mind
[1:29:14] that i have to fight with and battle
[1:29:15] with and everything i know it's not god
[1:29:20] huh and i find me a place of prayer
[1:29:24] on my knees i've learned to pray
[1:29:30] and ask god to help me find my way
[1:29:34] because we go through things that we
[1:29:36] kissed about
[1:29:37] can't find our way it's hard to find
[1:29:42] our way it's fine hard to find the
[1:29:45] correct thought
[1:29:47] because how many about the bible says
[1:29:48] the carmel mind is empty against god it
[1:29:51] can't think
[1:29:52] the right thoughts the wrong spirit
[1:29:55] can't think
[1:29:56] the right thoughts it has to be
[1:29:59] the right thought it has to be the right
[1:30:01] spirit
[1:30:04] and sometimes it takes a lot of prayer
[1:30:07] it takes a lot of soul-searching amen
[1:30:10] for me to find out that
[1:30:11] hey if there's anybody i don't care if
[1:30:13] it's my worst enemy if i have
[1:30:14] bad feelings how is that person
[1:30:18] there's something wrong in my heart huh
[1:30:21] because there's nobody that i don't want
[1:30:22] to go to heaven brother branham wanted
[1:30:24] hitler to go to heaven
[1:30:25] don't wish him lost huh
[1:30:29] in other words you get to a place to
[1:30:31] where you just can't say
[1:30:33] i love everybody every it makes me love
[1:30:37] everybody huh you get to the place where
[1:30:40] no this person here i don't really love
[1:30:43] i
[1:30:43] i you know i you know hello that's not
[1:30:46] christ
[1:30:48] and i have learned and i hope every one
[1:30:50] of us has here you have learned
[1:30:52] what the correct thoughts are whatever
[1:30:54] the the right mind that the
[1:30:57] thoughts that you're supposed to think
[1:30:59] that will absolutely
[1:31:01] control your spirit because your
[1:31:04] thoughts will control your spirit
[1:31:06] how many knows that what you think about
[1:31:08] what you meditate on
[1:31:10] it brings spirits that's why i like
[1:31:11] gospel when you listen to gospel but
[1:31:13] better man says you don't have to gossip
[1:31:15] to lose the holy ghost
[1:31:18] all you got to do is listen to that
[1:31:20] gossip
[1:31:22] amen just listen to gossip
[1:31:25] amen one way that you can always tell
[1:31:28] when something's not the holy
[1:31:30] ghost or when i am not thinking thoughts
[1:31:32] about my brother and my sister
[1:31:34] that's not of the holy ghost i will
[1:31:36] think evil about them
[1:31:39] i will think evil about that person
[1:31:43] if that's what you think it's not god
[1:31:46] that's what i think it's not god because
[1:31:49] that woman caught in the very act of
[1:31:51] adultery
[1:31:53] worthy of death and he says go and sin
[1:31:56] no more
[1:31:57] i don't condemn you huh
[1:32:01] you know i would hope i hope brother joe
[1:32:03] that i get to see that woman
[1:32:05] i hope she did go and sin no more
[1:32:07] because once you come in contact with
[1:32:09] jesus you're never the same again
[1:32:11] but i don't know maybe that woman did go
[1:32:14] back out and sin again i don't know
[1:32:16] it's possible but yet jesus had mercy
[1:32:18] upon her
[1:32:20] she had the right thoughts and one thing
[1:32:21] i've learned brother jeff is that
[1:32:23] whenever i get thoughts that are not
[1:32:25] right it disturbs me
[1:32:27] it upsets me and i'll be upset and
[1:32:29] that's absolutely
[1:32:31] not controlling my spirit amen i have to
[1:32:34] pray and say god
[1:32:36] what is the right thought and especially
[1:32:39] a
[1:32:40] pastor hello
[1:32:43] no matter what situation it is
[1:32:48] the wrong spirit will always make you
[1:32:50] see it one side
[1:32:51] one direction that's all you see but
[1:32:54] there's always two sides to everything
[1:32:57] amen and i've learned that when you look
[1:33:00] at the other side
[1:33:02] it's not near as half as bad as what it
[1:33:05] looked like looking the other way
[1:33:07] one way looks horrible the other way it
[1:33:09] looks hey it's not near as bad as it
[1:33:11] looks
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:18] get personal here that's okay perhaps
[1:33:21] preachers
[1:33:22] preachers even that have sided with who
[1:33:24] i thought they shouldn't side with did
[1:33:26] things in the church here
[1:33:27] i thought they should have never had the
[1:33:28] spiritual discernment to do what they
[1:33:30] did
[1:33:31] hello i try to invite him to come preach
[1:33:33] for me
[1:33:34] i have nothing against them
[1:33:38] huh because i believe they're my brother
[1:33:42] i don't believe they're not god's
[1:33:43] children because i know i had to learn
[1:33:47] i mean as we all got to learn and we all
[1:33:50] got to learn this one thing and that is
[1:33:52] to
[1:33:53] control our spirit if you can control
[1:33:55] your spirit
[1:33:56] if you can control what spirit dominates
[1:33:58] you you are mightier than a man that
[1:34:00] takes the city
[1:34:02] you're mightier than david because he
[1:34:05] couldn't
[1:34:06] isn't that right he can control his
[1:34:08] spirit he got into all
[1:34:11] kinds of trouble because of it but we
[1:34:13] know that that was under the old
[1:34:14] testament
[1:34:15] he couldn't have the holy ghost at the
[1:34:16] time so his flesh was stronger
[1:34:19] amen how many knows our our flesh
[1:34:24] self-control is there's just no
[1:34:26] self-control
[1:34:27] unless you got the holy ghost that's the
[1:34:28] only way to control your flesh is
[1:34:30] through the holy ghost otherwise it's
[1:34:32] going to go this way
[1:34:34] and i want i will god help us
[1:34:39] let's get this that the right thinking
[1:34:42] will bring the right spirit
[1:34:45] it'll make your whole world beautiful
[1:34:48] it'll give you a beautiful world
[1:34:52] amen but the wrong thing it'll make it a
[1:34:54] nightmare
[1:34:56] it'll make it a nightmare for your wife
[1:34:57] for your children everybody around you
[1:35:00] because i'll tell you what my wife can
[1:35:02] pick up on me when i'm in a bad mood
[1:35:04] that quick
[1:35:06] isn't that right
[1:35:10] that's why it's because she's so close
[1:35:11] to me i mean that's the way we got to be
[1:35:13] let me say something else
[1:35:15] everybody that takes communion everybody
[1:35:18] that's a part of this church
[1:35:19] we are brothers and sisters we are
[1:35:22] brothers and sisters
[1:35:24] and we stick together and if one of us
[1:35:26] gets out of line we're not going to
[1:35:28] throw them out
[1:35:30] we're not going to go throwing them out
[1:35:31] no we're going to stick there for them
[1:35:33] and with them and then
[1:35:34] pray through them and whatever it is we
[1:35:36] stay there and we stick together because
[1:35:38] that's the way i believe it ought to be
[1:35:40] in my family
[1:35:42] i'll tell you what no matter what i'm
[1:35:44] going to stick up for my family i'm
[1:35:45] going to be with my family
[1:35:47] doesn't mean i can't correct them and
[1:35:48] all that but we're together
[1:35:50] because it's the devil that wants the
[1:35:51] tears of heart he's the one that wants
[1:35:53] to divide
[1:35:54] the devil amen not god
[1:35:58] is that okay i thought lord help us to
[1:36:01] come to the place
[1:36:02] to where god can say now you're ready
[1:36:04] because if i as i was saying earlier
[1:36:06] as a pastor
[1:36:10] if i have this authority
[1:36:14] and i don't have character to go with it
[1:36:17] i just say well look i don't believe
[1:36:19] that person got the holy ghost it'd be
[1:36:20] better for them to find another place to
[1:36:22] go
[1:36:23] huh that isn't the right attitude no
[1:36:26] we're brothers and sisters
[1:36:27] i make mistakes why the next time i
[1:36:31] messed up god say that about me
[1:36:34] wouldn't that be terrible that's right
[1:36:39] so i'll tell you god is working i don't
[1:36:42] know about you but he's working on me on
[1:36:43] this
[1:36:45] and i can tonight i can tell you i'm
[1:36:47] thankful that god's working on me on
[1:36:48] this
[1:36:50] because i want to be at the place that
[1:36:53] no matter what comes my way
[1:36:55] i can control my spirit
[1:36:58] i will not allow negative thoughts to
[1:37:02] come into my mind
[1:37:03] wrong thoughts to come into my mind
[1:37:05] because if i do
[1:37:08] something as simple as gossip i'm going
[1:37:11] to get a bad spirit
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:20] you love the lord i want to leave this
[1:37:23] place one of these times
[1:37:25] and i want to be ready to leave this
[1:37:26] place and i believe
[1:37:28] that god is working on us don't you i
[1:37:31] believe god
[1:37:32] loves each and every last one of us and
[1:37:35] i hope that god
[1:37:36] that each and every one of us when the
[1:37:38] rapture takes place
[1:37:40] amen will be going day before yesterday
[1:37:43] i thought the rapture might have taken
[1:37:44] place
[1:37:46] me and my wife we were right there at
[1:37:48] the farm we were together and i went
[1:37:49] everywhere
[1:37:50] i got in the house i said huh honey
[1:37:54] where are you at bathroom no nobody back
[1:37:56] there upstairs
[1:37:57] donna where are you nowhere
[1:38:01] look out the chicken house nobody door's
[1:38:03] not open
[1:38:05] what's going on here my wife just
[1:38:06] disappeared
[1:38:11] but wow i didn't get scared or anything
[1:38:14] i knew he wasn't no raptor but i thought
[1:38:15] this
[1:38:16] is probably what it will be like go for
[1:38:17] the rapture for folks you know
[1:38:20] just be missing then i remember having
[1:38:23] heard
[1:38:24] but i thought somebody was supposed to
[1:38:28] show up at the farm and i heard some
[1:38:29] gravel going so i thought that person
[1:38:31] had comment
[1:38:31] i had one out there nobody came and i
[1:38:33] was like this is oh i remember i heard
[1:38:35] some gravel
[1:38:36] and then i looked the van was going said
[1:38:39] all right
[1:38:40] now i know why she's nowhere
[1:38:43] but i'll tell you what we all want to go
[1:38:45] when the time comes we want to be ready
[1:38:49] amen god bless you let's stand tonight
[1:38:51] stand the night
[1:38:54] true power
[1:38:58] is in being able to surrender yourself
[1:39:01] to god
[1:39:02] that's not always easy to do is it sure
[1:39:04] it isn't
[1:39:06] but the lord will help us amen through
[1:39:08] no matter what comes or goes he'll help
[1:39:09] us to surrender
[1:39:11] to god let him fight our battles for us
[1:39:15] let him
[1:39:16] he may take care of things for us let's
[1:39:17] bow our heads
[1:39:24] lord jesus we come before you lord
[1:39:26] tonight
[1:39:28] and lord thinking about how that father
[1:39:30] we
[1:39:32] are going to come to a rapture we're
[1:39:34] supposed to come to a place of adoption
[1:39:36] to where you can trust us with the
[1:39:38] spoken word
[1:39:40] lord jesus i look forward to the time
[1:39:42] that where i can just
[1:39:43] speak the word where i can just say be
[1:39:46] healed brother in the name of jesus
[1:39:47] christ
[1:39:48] and they'll be healed just ask and it'll
[1:39:51] be done lord
[1:39:53] but father i've seen you answer many
[1:39:55] prayers i believe you answered prayers
[1:39:57] but
[1:39:58] lord jesus i truly want to be at that
[1:40:00] place lord where i'm
[1:40:01] could be trusted with that power that
[1:40:04] there's enough character
[1:40:05] in my heart that you could trust me lord
[1:40:08] jesus said i would
[1:40:09] do the right thing lord jesus
[1:40:12] father tonight no doubt each and every
[1:40:13] one lord in here wants to be to that
[1:40:15] place where
[1:40:18] our spirit is always nothing but the
[1:40:21] holy spirit that's controlling us
