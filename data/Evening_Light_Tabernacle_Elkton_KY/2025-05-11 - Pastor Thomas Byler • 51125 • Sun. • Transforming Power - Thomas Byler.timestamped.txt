[9:49] for Sunday school. If you go in the
[9:51] Psalms with me, we're going to go
[9:54] to Psalms
[9:58] 139. We're going to start in verse one.
[10:01] I think we'll read up to verse
[10:04] 18 in Psalms
[10:09] 139. It's good to be in the house of the
[10:12] Lord this morning. It is a privilege and
[10:14] an honor to be here.
[10:17] All right, let's hear here. Psalms
[10:20] 139. Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and
[10:23] known me.
[10:32] Thou compasses my path and my lying down
[10:35] and art acquainted with all my ways.
[10:44] Thou hast beset me behind and before and
[10:47] laid thine hand upon me.
[10:56] Whether shall I go from thy spirit or
[10:59] wiither shall I flee from thy presence?
[11:14] I take the wings of the
[11:16] [Music]
[11:23] morning. If I take the wings of the
[11:26] morning and dwell in the uttermost parts
[11:28] of the sea.
[11:36] If I say surely the darkness shall cover
[11:38] me, even the night shall be light about
[11:50] me. possessed my reigns, thus covered me
[11:53] in my mother's womb.
[12:04] My substance was not hid from thee when
[12:07] I was made in secret and curiously
[12:10] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[12:12] earth.
[12:25] How precious also are all thy thoughts
[12:28] unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of
[12:31] them. If I should count them, they are
[12:34] more in number than the sands. When I
[12:36] awake, I am still with thee. God bless
[12:38] you. May be seated, Brother Brian.
[12:52] Morning brothers and sisters. So after
[12:55] reading those 18
[12:57] verses, you wonder how some people can't
[13:00] believe in predestination. You know,
[13:01] it's a wonderful thought to know that
[13:04] the minute you were conceived to the day
[13:06] you die, that God's got his hand
[13:09] completely in every minute, every second
[13:12] of your life. and that you can trust him
[13:15] to be merciful to you and to lead and
[13:18] guide you. All we have to do as simple
[13:21] human beings is trust him and just let
[13:24] go and let God have his way. If you
[13:26] return with me to
[13:27] uh 1 Peter the third chapter,
[13:34] uh happy Mother's Day to all you
[13:36] mothers.
[13:45] I hope I got every spot
[13:48] marked. I guess I'm not trying to be
[13:51] funny here, but as brother Tommy was
[13:54] praying, being an army guy, I I try to
[13:57] put brevity in everything that I hear or
[13:59] see. So, basically, God is asking us
[14:03] this morning, what are you going to be
[14:04] sitting there this morning? Are you
[14:06] going to be the campfire or are you
[14:08] going to be the wet rag? And you're all
[14:10] gonna make that choice this morning.
[14:12] Whether you're going to be a campfire or
[14:14] you're going to be a wet rag. And the
[14:16] only way you can be the
[14:17] campfire is that through the week that
[14:20] you've yielded yourself up into prayer
[14:22] and study of God's word and you desire
[14:24] to see God move in the hearts of his
[14:27] people. Doesn't mean that we all have
[14:29] perfect days. No, it does not mean that.
[14:31] Sometimes you just have a bad day and
[14:33] sometimes you have a good day. But
[14:34] through it all, God is your God and he
[14:36] loves you and he'll get you through it.
[14:39] But I was um thinking I was listening to
[14:43] that message that I listened to it a
[14:46] couple of times. It's uh events made
[14:49] clear by prophecy. And I as brother
[14:52] Brandham was getting started in that
[14:54] message. What really struck me is
[14:56] sometimes we forget about I was
[14:58] listening and he was talking about all
[15:01] the people that came to the tabernacle
[15:03] that day that couldn't get in and he was
[15:06] explaining to the people how they were
[15:08] driving around trying to find places
[15:10] where they could stop and listen on the
[15:13] radio to the message and then he was
[15:16] talking about all those that were on
[15:18] dialup listening on the phone. And I was
[15:20] just thinking back in 1965 how much, you
[15:24] know, how expensive it was for a church
[15:27] to listen to brother Brandham in an
[15:29] assembly like this on a speaker off of a
[15:32] telephone. And I was just thinking of,
[15:34] you know, we talk about
[15:36] urgency, wanting to see the word of God
[15:39] in the hour. Those people were were
[15:41] really wanting it. They were willing to
[15:44] their money, their resources, their
[15:46] time. They were giving it all to the
[15:48] study and to listen to the word of God.
[15:50] And and I was also listening into that
[15:53] message. Brother Ram, you we all know
[15:55] this. He says in every age at the end
[15:58] when the messenger leaves as as time
[16:01] goes on, they fall into apostasy in the
[16:04] end. They just get cold. They get hard,
[16:07] unseeing, uncaring. And I know for
[16:10] myself, I don't want to be that way in
[16:12] my life and in my art. You know, I as I
[16:15] get older, I it's harder to stay I know
[16:18] in my own life, it's I hadn't even read
[16:21] the word yet, but um it's hard to stay
[16:23] tender. You know what I mean? You get so
[16:26] caught up you you think of all the
[16:27] things that have gone on in your life
[16:29] and you got to just throw them aside.
[16:31] Don't care about them. The only thing
[16:33] you really want to care about is Jesus
[16:35] Christ. I'll start here
[16:38] um about the ninth verse of the third
[16:41] chapter of First Peter. You know, I I
[16:44] write notes to myself to to stay online
[16:47] and I I don't use them. Y'all y'all have
[16:49] to forgive me for that. But I'll just
[16:51] read what Peter had to say this morning.
[16:53] And I'm a firm believer of God's word
[16:55] speaks for itself. Uh it this is what
[16:58] Peter had to say. uh not rendering evil
[17:02] for evil, especially in this day we and
[17:04] rail and for contraise blessing, knowing
[17:07] that ye are there on to call that ye
[17:10] should inherit a blessing. For he that
[17:13] will love life and see good days, here's
[17:15] a formula from the youngest to the
[17:18] oldest this morning sitting here. For if
[17:20] we would love life and see good days,
[17:23] let him refrain his tongue from evil.
[17:25] And that really speaks to this day and
[17:27] age when you're butting up against the
[17:30] people in the world, not giving giving
[17:33] heed to anger or saying things that you
[17:35] really shouldn't say. You know, you
[17:37] don't have to say if you're thinking it
[17:39] is just as bad as saying it. So, uh it
[17:42] just because you don't say it doesn't
[17:44] mean you're not responsible for what it
[17:46] goes on. Speak no gile. Let him assue
[17:49] evil and do good. Let him speak seek
[17:52] peace and in and ensue it.
[17:55] For the eyes of the Lord are are over
[17:57] the righteous, and his ears are open
[17:59] unto their prayers, but the face of the
[18:02] Lord is against them that do evil.
[18:05] Doesn't make a difference who you are if
[18:07] you're doing evil, God's face is upon
[18:09] you. And it says, who is he that will
[18:11] harm you if you be followers of that
[18:13] which is good? And I found that out out
[18:16] in my life, if you just do the good
[18:17] thing, do the right
[18:20] thing, it'll work out in the end. It's
[18:24] really important. No matter how people
[18:26] are treating you, how the world is
[18:28] treating you, whatever the situation is,
[18:30] if you do the right thing and what God
[18:33] would expect you to do, in the end,
[18:35] you'll be blessed for it. Does it make
[18:37] it easy? No, it doesn't make it easy.
[18:40] But if you suffer for righteousness,
[18:42] say, happy are ye. And be not afraid of
[18:44] their terror, neither be troubled. And
[18:47] that really speaks for this day. But
[18:48] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and
[18:51] be ready always to give an answer to
[18:53] every man that asks you a reason of the
[18:55] hope that is in you with the meekness
[18:57] and
[18:58] fear. Having good conscience that
[19:02] whereas they speak evil of you as
[19:04] evildoers that they may be ashamed and
[19:06] falsely accused your good conversation
[19:09] in Christ. And he goes on to say here,
[19:12] for it is better that if you will be of
[19:15] God, be so that you suffer for welloing
[19:18] than for evildoing. And that's really
[19:19] important. You know, when you do
[19:21] something wrong, you deserve to be
[19:22] treated for doing that thing wrong. You
[19:24] can't expect, you know, it really
[19:27] strikes me. You know, Jesus told his
[19:29] disciples, if you do something wrong,
[19:32] expect to pay for what you do wrong. He
[19:34] said, "If you if they send you to prison
[19:36] for doing something wrong or whatever
[19:38] whatever the punishment in the natural
[19:41] for doing something wrong, you're
[19:43] obligated to pay that punishment.
[19:45] There's no getting out of it." And I'm
[19:47] just thinking in the spiritual s there's
[19:49] a way to get out of it this morning. I
[19:51] lost my place. For it is better if the
[19:53] will of God be so that you suffer for
[19:55] welldoing than for evildoing. For Christ
[19:58] hath once suffered for sin, that the
[20:01] just for the un for the unjust, that we
[20:04] might bring us to God, bring both, put
[20:07] death in the flesh, but quickened by the
[20:10] spirit, by which also he went and
[20:12] preached unto the spirits in prison,
[20:14] which sometimes were disobedient, when
[20:17] once the long-suffering God waited in
[20:19] the days of Noah, while the ark was
[20:21] being prepared. I didn't mean to go that
[20:23] far this morning. If you would turn with
[20:26] back with me to uh
[20:30] Romans, I'll finish with this thought. I
[20:33] was about to say something. I'm not
[20:35] going to say
[20:38] it. I had a mark this morning. I think I
[20:40] lost my
[20:44] place. I'll start at Romans the 12th
[20:47] chap chapter this
[20:51] morning. You know, while I'm up here
[20:53] this morning, you know, you can spend
[20:56] hours studying God's word. You can spend
[20:59] hours thinking that God wants you to say
[21:03] something. But the most important thing
[21:05] I've learned in my life
[21:07] is you got to go the way that God leads
[21:11] you. And you can't fight it. If if you
[21:14] don't have anything to say, don't say
[21:15] anything. It's better not to say
[21:17] anything than say something years from
[21:19] now that you'll be responsible for. So,
[21:22] I've learned a long time ago, it's best
[21:23] to let God's word speak for itself and
[21:26] the message of the hour speak for
[21:28] itself. Let it ch inter interpret itself
[21:30] and that way you won't get in trouble.
[21:32] But this is what Paul had to say here.
[21:35] And also, I was thinking, you know, the
[21:36] world is is pretty much crazy place here
[21:40] this morning. You know, I I mean, a lot
[21:44] of people have been thinking about
[21:46] what's happened in the last couple of
[21:48] days with them electing a new pope, but
[21:51] then I think we all know that the
[21:53] Catholic Church is an apostate church.
[21:56] We all know that the pope himself, the
[21:58] very office, is
[22:00] antirist. So, anyone that's ever elected
[22:03] to that position is just going to be as
[22:06] antichrist as the one before him. But we
[22:09] also know what brother Brown had to say
[22:11] that as you see the circumstances in the
[22:14] world go like uh people talk about that
[22:18] message the countdown how you know it
[22:20] thing is going so fast you know I I I've
[22:24] said this a lot what I would have
[22:26] thought four or five years ago may take
[22:30] 10 or 20 years to bring about what's
[22:33] happening
[22:34] tomorrow what someone might think will
[22:36] happen a year will happen in an hour.
[22:38] What happens in a minute might h in a
[22:41] second might happen in a minute. It's
[22:42] just how fast life is going this
[22:45] morning. And how important it is for us
[22:47] to hold on to the only true thing there
[22:50] is and that's Jesus Christ this morning.
[22:52] And uh as I see the world going the way
[22:55] it's going, the debauchery, the the sin,
[22:58] the unbelief that's out there in the
[23:00] world, it just lets me know I need to
[23:03] get closer. I need to be holding on to
[23:05] that rock this morning. And I'll just
[23:07] read what Paul had to say here. I
[23:09] beseech you therefore, this is the 12th
[23:11] chapter of Romans here. I beseech you
[23:15] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[23:16] God, that you present your bodies a
[23:19] living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
[23:23] God, which is your reasonable service.
[23:25] So Paul's saying here not to think of
[23:28] yourself any more than you have than you
[23:31] than you are. Be not conformed to this
[23:33] world, but ye be ye transformed by the
[23:36] renewing of your minds, that you may
[23:38] prove that which is good and acceptable
[23:41] and the perfect will of God. And he goes
[23:43] on to say here, for I say through the
[23:45] grace given unto me to every man that is
[23:48] among you, not to think of himself more
[23:51] highly than he ought to think, but to
[23:53] think soberly according to as God had
[23:56] dealt to every man the measure of faith.
[23:59] You know, I have a saying I use this
[24:01] being an an army guy. This is something
[24:03] I've always dealt with in life, whether
[24:05] it's in business or on active duty, is
[24:08] people, if you're not careful, you wind
[24:11] up thinking more about yourself than you
[24:13] really should. And you know what happens
[24:15] then? When you think yourself, you're so
[24:16] high or you're in a position of so much
[24:19] authority that nothing can ever knock
[24:21] you off that pedestal. I've always found
[24:24] out when you start thinking like that
[24:26] and acting like that, that's when all
[24:28] you know, all of a sudden, you know, the
[24:30] stool goes and you'll find yourself
[24:32] falling flat on your back and you have
[24:34] to work your way back up. And I've
[24:36] learned in life not to think of myself
[24:38] any more than I have to because I know
[24:40] God's going to bring a correction. So,
[24:43] after so many experience, I know that no
[24:45] man is better than any other man. And we
[24:48] all are just Christians and that's the
[24:49] way we have to treat each other. And
[24:51] I'll just finish reading this. For I say
[24:53] through grace given unto me to every man
[24:55] that is among you, not to think of
[24:57] himself more highly than he ought to
[24:59] think, but to think soberly according as
[25:01] God has dwelt to every man the measure
[25:04] of faith. We all have a measure of faith
[25:06] this morning. For you know, you might
[25:08] have a little this morning, but you can
[25:10] have more tomorrow. And all you're the
[25:13] reason you have little now, but you can
[25:15] have more tomorrow. And the only
[25:16] stumbling block between the little and
[25:18] the more is what we're not willing to
[25:21] get out of our lives and get out of the
[25:23] way so God can bless us this morning.
[25:25] And he goes on, I I keep rereading the
[25:28] same verse. For as have many members in
[25:31] one body, all members have in the same
[25:33] office. So we being many are one in the
[25:36] body of Christ and one members one
[25:40] another. I was I wrote these notes here
[25:42] this morning, but I I just don't But the
[25:46] one thing that really struck
[25:50] me I wrote this down to myself this
[25:53] morning. I think I wrote it on the back
[25:56] of this
[25:58] one. The one thing I I just wrote I was
[26:01] listening to that message this morning
[26:03] and what and last night and a few other
[26:06] times and the one thing that really
[26:07] struck me about it is every Christian
[26:10] should have a desire to serve. You
[26:13] shouldn't be feeding off your brothers
[26:16] and sisters. You should have, you know,
[26:18] I the way I look at it, everyone that
[26:22] comes to church every morning should
[26:25] want to lift up the service that
[26:27] morning. you want it should want it to
[26:29] be better today than it was yesterday. A
[26:32] a spirit of service. And I was also
[26:34] thinking the only way that you can have
[26:36] a desire to serve is you've got to have
[26:38] that Bible brotherly kindness that we
[26:41] speak of that the word speaks of that
[26:44] your sole desire is to prosper other
[26:46] people above yourself and to interact
[26:49] with people in a way that you encourage
[26:51] them and you lead and guide them in the
[26:53] word of God. And I'll finish with that
[26:55] thought this morning.
[26:59] But anticipation, brother Tommy was
[27:02] talking about it. Some of the quotes
[27:04] were up there were talking about
[27:07] anticipation. I'm assume everyone here
[27:10] this morning has anticipation about what
[27:13] God's going to do for them. Uh there's a
[27:15] list of people that need prayer this
[27:17] morning that need God to do something
[27:19] for their bodies in a physical sense.
[27:21] I'm sure there's numerous people here
[27:23] sitting this morning that need a touch
[27:25] from God in their minds and in their
[27:27] hearts that you need to have some
[27:29] questions answered. Not as a I I know in
[27:32] my own life that God is more than able
[27:34] whatever those needs are this morning to
[27:36] meet whatever your needs are.
[27:39] Brother Josh.
[27:56] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[27:57] the Lord. Amen. Let's stand this
[28:00] morning. Just want to welcome our
[28:01] visitors. Amen. Sister Julie's mom. It's
[28:03] good to have you with us this morning.
[28:04] Brother Ben, Amanda Drake from
[28:06] Cloverdale from Canada. It's good to
[28:07] have them this morning. I want to
[28:09] welcome them. And let's just worship the
[28:11] Lord this morning. Listen, my hope is in
[28:12] the Lord from this
[28:15] time. My
[28:18] hope is in the
[28:22] Lord from this time
[28:26] on and ever more.

[59:56] that doesn't hurt a bit, you know." So
[59:58] that makes a difference because we can
[1:00:00] certainly we want God to have his way.
[1:00:03] Amen. I can't think of any other
[1:00:06] announcements. Amen. At the time, Amen.
[1:00:08] And I know that brother brother Andrew
[1:00:10] is going to take uh Thursday evening
[1:00:13] service and also Saturday. Amen. And
[1:00:16] then brother Timothy will take Friday
[1:00:17] and Sunday. Amen. If you will, it's
[1:00:20] already been an hour almost. So, Amen.
[1:00:23] And uh so we want to try to just express
[1:00:26] something that the Lord has laid on my
[1:00:27] heart to minister this morning. Amen.
[1:00:29] With his help, we want to continue on
[1:00:32] kind of on the thought that we have
[1:00:34] been. Amen. So, if you will stand with
[1:00:37] me this
[1:00:38] morning, let's just go before the Lord
[1:00:40] in prayer, shall we? Amen. Aren't we
[1:00:43] glad that we can approach our heavenly
[1:00:45] father? Amen. And talk to him, Lord
[1:00:48] Jesus. As we are about to open your
[1:00:50] word, the one the thoughts that you had
[1:00:52] before the foundation of the world and
[1:00:54] you put them in a book, Lord Jesus. And
[1:00:57] we get to open those open that book,
[1:00:59] Lord. And we get to look at those words
[1:01:01] that you had thought your thought that
[1:01:03] was before the foundation. We know that
[1:01:05] Lord, heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:01:07] but those thoughts and those words will
[1:01:10] never pass away Lord, but they'll
[1:01:12] accomplish what they have said. And Lord
[1:01:14] Jesus, we are so grateful, Father, for
[1:01:16] something that is that sure and that
[1:01:18] solid, Father, in a world of shifting
[1:01:20] sand, sinking sand. We ask God the
[1:01:23] blessing upon the reading of the word
[1:01:24] now in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Amen.
[1:01:29] Let's just go to Matthew, if you will.
[1:01:31] Amen. And I uh I like I like to kind of
[1:01:36] be timely about, you know, not keeping
[1:01:39] people too long, but I don't know. Don't
[1:01:41] promise it this morning. Is that okay?
[1:01:44] Amen. Amen. I hope hopefully the most
[1:01:48] part we have all Christians here because
[1:01:51] brother Bram said Christians can stay
[1:01:52] all day, you know, but maybe people that
[1:01:55] aren't so enthused about God, well, they
[1:01:57] might get tired and not want to come
[1:01:58] back, you know, if you go too long. So,
[1:02:00] Brother Brandham said, "That's who we
[1:02:02] focus on." Ain't that right? We don't
[1:02:04] want to get anybody, you know, we're
[1:02:06] there for the for the sinner to get
[1:02:08] people to Christ. But, uh, if Amen.
[1:02:12] Amen. I might as well say it while it's
[1:02:14] in my mind. Brother Brandon, he talking
[1:02:17] about a deacon board that got on a on a
[1:02:19] on a on a preacher, a pastor, I guess.
[1:02:22] He says, "Now, you know, you know, we
[1:02:24] you you went so long this morning. We
[1:02:26] didn't hire somebody just to keep a seat
[1:02:28] and all." And he says, "Boy, I wish I
[1:02:29] had that congregation for about a
[1:02:31] service. I'd lay into it and we'd stay
[1:02:34] for a while is what he said." Oh my. But
[1:02:38] any
[1:02:39] anyway, we just love the Lord. Ain't
[1:02:41] that right? And I don't know about you,
[1:02:43] but I I enjoy basking in the presence of
[1:02:45] God. Amen. When I went to the bar, I'll
[1:02:48] tell you what, if one closed at 2
[1:02:50] o'clock, we went to went to see if we we
[1:02:52] was asking each other, "Well, what's
[1:02:54] open all night?" Ain't that right,
[1:02:55] Tommy? Where's one all open all night?
[1:02:58] was a little crazy that way. Amen. But
[1:03:00] this is so much better. Amen. So, we're
[1:03:02] open all day. How's that sound? We're
[1:03:05] Amen. So, God bless you. Amen. Let's
[1:03:07] read. Okay.
[1:03:09] Matthew. Amen. And Matthew. Amen. This
[1:03:12] is going to be a Mother's Day message,
[1:03:14] but it certainly is going to be a little
[1:03:16] different.
[1:03:17] Amen. Matthew 23, I believe it is.
[1:03:20] Matthew
[1:03:23] 23. Matthew 23 and verse 37.
[1:03:30] Now he had been really reprimanding the
[1:03:33] Pharisees. Ain't that right? In verse
[1:03:36] 33, calling them serpents and generation
[1:03:39] of vipers. How can you escape the
[1:03:41] damnation of hell? Can you imagine
[1:03:43] having a congregation that you're saying
[1:03:45] these things
[1:03:48] to that right? My So now notice and he
[1:03:52] says and then down we're just going to
[1:03:54] go on down to the main verse because
[1:03:56] I've got several scriptures I want to
[1:03:58] read with the help of the Lord. Verse
[1:03:59] 37. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that
[1:04:01] klest the prophets and stonest them
[1:04:04] which are sent unto thee, how
[1:04:07] often together as a hen gatherth her
[1:04:11] chickens under her wings, and ye would
[1:04:15] not. Amen. My my my. I guess that's just
[1:04:20] one of the saddest things that you'll
[1:04:23] ever read in the
[1:04:25] Bible. It's the things that God did,
[1:04:28] what Jesus did, but people just would
[1:04:32] not would not. That's sad, isn't it? May
[1:04:36] God add his blessing to the reading of
[1:04:38] the word. You can be
[1:04:39] seated. Mother's Day. As we think about
[1:04:43] Mother's Day. Amen.
[1:04:46] And basically what I want to kind of the
[1:04:49] direction that I want to go with the
[1:04:50] help of the Lord, we want to talk about
[1:04:52] that those who would not. Amen. And and
[1:04:55] then we want to pick up about halfway
[1:04:58] through probably. We'll pick up uh back
[1:05:01] to where we kind of left off. Amen. Um
[1:05:04] was it this is Sunday, so I guess it
[1:05:06] would have been Wednesday. Amen. Where
[1:05:09] we left off. And my title, I guess you
[1:05:11] already put it up there. Amen.
[1:05:14] transforming power or power to change.
[1:05:18] Power to change.
[1:05:20] Transforming power. Amen. But we I was
[1:05:24] in my office and and and I was going a
[1:05:26] certain direction and then the Holy
[1:05:28] Ghost spirit kind of led me this way
[1:05:29] knowing it was Mother's Day. I said,
[1:05:31] "Well, let's let's just tie this
[1:05:32] together." And there he was. Of course,
[1:05:35] Jesus saying that he typed himself as a
[1:05:40] hen with her chickens. Now, we know that
[1:05:42] would be a mother hand. Isn't that the
[1:05:44] mother, a mom? And uh I want to I want
[1:05:49] to say first, let me say first kind of
[1:05:53] back up something Brother Brian said. I
[1:05:55] mean, talking about prophecy and and
[1:05:57] things that are starting to really
[1:05:59] roll. How many knows that, you know, now
[1:06:04] this is going to be the way I see it.
[1:06:06] Um, but I believe for myself, I believe
[1:06:09] that woman in purple that was in great
[1:06:11] power was Camela Harris. Hello. And she
[1:06:16] ruined the country. It ruined
[1:06:17] everything. And of course, we know, we
[1:06:19] can see by all the things that that has
[1:06:21] come out that they truly did. Amen. And
[1:06:25] then think about if that truly was that
[1:06:27] way. Amen. And just that prophecy of a
[1:06:30] woman that would rise in power, become
[1:06:31] vice president or something in great
[1:06:33] power and so forth. And and then just a
[1:06:36] year ago, not even what Trump's been in,
[1:06:39] how I don't know how just how long,
[1:06:40] maybe six months at the most, somewhere
[1:06:42] in there. But just about a year ago,
[1:06:44] that that if that scripture was
[1:06:46] fulfilled now, we are already seeing
[1:06:48] another one being fulfilled about the
[1:06:50] pope coming out of America.
[1:06:53] Isn't it starting to really roll, folks?
[1:06:55] It is starting to roll. Amen. It's it
[1:06:57] it's starting to go fast. Amen. And we
[1:07:00] know the next scripture what he said in
[1:07:02] what did he say in that scripture that
[1:07:04] when he does that? Amen. Then the church
[1:07:07] will be what? Driven together.
[1:07:11] Amen. Now that may be the good part, but
[1:07:14] it could also be the scary part.
[1:07:19] Cuz what kind of force, what kind of
[1:07:21] power, what's it going to take to drive
[1:07:23] us together? The true church of God is
[1:07:25] going to be driven together like never
[1:07:28] before. She's going to become one body.
[1:07:31] Amen. We know all the other quotes and
[1:07:33] scriptures about uh you know the
[1:07:35] financial squeeze, the boycott that's
[1:07:37] coming, you know, closing places up. And
[1:07:40] at the time that they try to close us
[1:07:41] up, Brother Bam says they won't shut us
[1:07:43] up, but we'll go up. So that rapture is
[1:07:46] looking very close now. Amen. How many
[1:07:49] got their ears open? Amen. Looking for
[1:07:51] those signs and wonder I mean the signs
[1:07:53] of of his coming. Amen. And so my my my
[1:07:57] message this morning, Amen. as as a
[1:08:00] pastor. Amen. As a pe a person who God
[1:08:03] has called to lead, Amen. A group of
[1:08:06] people here at Elton, Kentucky. And the
[1:08:08] direction that we want to go now. Amen.
[1:08:11] And and this morning, Amen. I want to
[1:08:13] kind of share with that, share the
[1:08:15] direction that that we are to take,
[1:08:17] direction that we want to be going.
[1:08:19] Amen. Amen. What God's doing, God's
[1:08:22] doing in his church, God's doing in his
[1:08:23] people. Because how many believe you God
[1:08:26] is working in that true bride? Amen.
[1:08:30] Amen. And so to first have like I said I
[1:08:33] want to take talk a little bit about
[1:08:34] those who would not and then we want to
[1:08:36] talk about those who would. Is that
[1:08:39] okay?
[1:08:40] Praise the Lord. Amen. And we want to we
[1:08:43] want to talk about the power of God.
[1:08:45] Power of transformation. Transformation.
[1:08:48] But preach message on power of
[1:08:50] transformation. Amen. and and uh I
[1:08:53] believe it's in Romans 12. I'll just go
[1:08:55] ahead and read it. I was going to wait
[1:08:57] on this, but it just comes to mind, so
[1:08:59] we'll read it. He says, "I beseech you
[1:09:01] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[1:09:02] God, that you present your bodies a
[1:09:04] living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
[1:09:06] unto God, which is your reasonable
[1:09:08] service, and be not conformed to this
[1:09:11] world, but be transformed." Amen. How
[1:09:14] many believes in transforming? Amen. So
[1:09:17] that's going to be my second half of our
[1:09:19] by the renewing of your mind that you
[1:09:21] may prove what is that good and
[1:09:22] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[1:09:25] Amen. But let's first look at look at a
[1:09:28] little story brother Brandham told about
[1:09:31] a mother. Amen. Because we're going to
[1:09:33] type that with God. Amen. And then we'll
[1:09:36] go from there. Amen. Brother Bram tells
[1:09:40] of uh a young lady that had went off to
[1:09:44] college. Isn't that right? had went off
[1:09:47] to college and she came home, I guess in
[1:09:50] between maybe semesters or whatever it
[1:09:52] might be, but she was coming home and
[1:09:54] she was bringing one of her pretty
[1:09:56] little friends with her. Y'all remember
[1:09:59] that? Pretty little friends. Amen. And
[1:10:03] she and then when she come and she got
[1:10:05] off the train, she went out there and
[1:10:08] her poor mother ran up to throw her arms
[1:10:12] around her and she turned her back on
[1:10:15] her
[1:10:16] mother. Amen. Ain't that right? Just
[1:10:19] kind of like what they did here
[1:10:21] Jerusalem. They turned their back. They
[1:10:23] would not. They would
[1:10:25] not. Amen. It would refuse to let Jesus
[1:10:29] take him under his wings and care for
[1:10:32] him. Amen. Now, how many believes that
[1:10:35] God is our mother?
[1:10:38] Sure. God is our mother. We sing that
[1:10:40] song. He's my father, my mother, my
[1:10:43] sister, and my brother. Amen. He's
[1:10:46] everything. He's everything to me. Amen.
[1:10:50] And Amen. We talk about before I go on.
[1:10:53] Amen. The mother, how many knows that a
[1:10:56] mother, there's something about a
[1:10:58] mother, she cares about the children's
[1:11:01] food. She cares about their clothing.
[1:11:04] Ain't that
[1:11:06] right? Cares every every little detail
[1:11:09] about her children, she cares about. How
[1:11:12] many believe God does that same thing
[1:11:13] for you and I? Amen.
[1:11:16] He said in Matthew, "If God so clothe
[1:11:18] the grass of the field which is today
[1:11:20] and tomorrow's cast in the oven, shall
[1:11:22] he not much more clothe you, oh ye of
[1:11:25] little
[1:11:26] faith?" I mean, God cares about whether
[1:11:29] you have clothes to wear. He cares about
[1:11:31] whether you have food to eat. He cares
[1:11:33] about your well-being.
[1:11:35] parents and mom make sure she'll ensure
[1:11:37] that you take eat your beans and and eat
[1:11:40] your potatoes and eat things that maybe
[1:11:42] you don't like too well, but she knows
[1:11:44] it's good for you. That's the way we are
[1:11:47] spiritually. You might not always like
[1:11:48] what the preacher says, but it's good
[1:11:51] for you. Amen. Bam talked about always
[1:11:54] having to have take castor oil. Amen.
[1:11:57] Every Saturday or whenever they got
[1:11:59] anything wrong with it and so forth and
[1:12:01] oh how horrible it was. Amen. always
[1:12:04] make you sick to your stomach. But
[1:12:05] Abraham is preaching many times that if
[1:12:07] the preaching don't make you a little
[1:12:08] sick, probably don't do you any good.
[1:12:12] All right. Oh, ye of little faith. Take
[1:12:15] no thought saying, "What shall we eat or
[1:12:16] drink or all shall be closed?" But this
[1:12:19] is what the Gentiles seek after. For
[1:12:21] your heavenly father does know that you
[1:12:24] have need of these things. But seek ye
[1:12:27] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:12:29] righteousness because he's going to take
[1:12:32] all of these things care of these things
[1:12:34] for you. Ain't that right? He already
[1:12:37] promised that he was going to take care
[1:12:38] of our small things.
[1:12:41] I mean, he's a wonderful mother to us.
[1:12:43] He cares about us. Amen. So, we're
[1:12:47] thankful to the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:12:48] he cares even as a hen to take her under
[1:12:52] herself. And here this woman here, she
[1:12:54] had uh uh you know had her daughter
[1:12:57] coming back and she wanted to throw her
[1:12:59] arms out there. Uh you know the the poor
[1:13:02] mother throw it up there, come up there
[1:13:05] to throw her arms around and she turned
[1:13:07] her back on her
[1:13:08] mother. Now how many knows just why it
[1:13:11] was? Amen. That's right. Because her
[1:13:13] mother was ugly. In another story he
[1:13:16] says whenever they're riding on the
[1:13:17] train. Amen. And when they come by there
[1:13:20] and they looked out the window and that
[1:13:22] girl said, "Who is that horrible looking
[1:13:25] hag out
[1:13:26] there?" Disfigured,
[1:13:31] ugly, face all tore up. Isn't that
[1:13:34] right? Just terrible looking. And she
[1:13:37] was ashamed to say, "That's my mama."
[1:13:40] She was ashamed of her mama. Something
[1:13:44] now. Notice she had some something
[1:13:46] pretty something. and her mother wasn't
[1:13:48] no stylish and and that's the way people
[1:13:50] are treating Jesus Christ today. They
[1:13:53] don't want the oldfashioned down at the
[1:13:55] altar and cleaning up and dressing up
[1:13:57] like a saint acting like a saint and
[1:13:59] godliness.
[1:14:01] Amen. Listen, the conductor, he seen
[1:14:03] that girl shun her mother, the conductor
[1:14:05] now. And I want to say I'm going to act
[1:14:07] as the conductor this morning. I'm going
[1:14:10] to call those out that reject Jesus
[1:14:13] Christ, those who are ashamed of Jesus
[1:14:16] Christ. I'mma call it out. How could
[1:14:18] you?
[1:14:20] God of heaven come from glory. He didn't
[1:14:22] have to, but he did. How many know he
[1:14:25] didn't have to do what he did, but he
[1:14:27] did. Amen. All right. On we go. Notice.
[1:14:31] So, uh, he says, "That's right." And
[1:14:35] notice the conductor saw that girl Sean
[1:14:38] her mother walk away like that with that
[1:14:40] pathy thing. The first thing you know
[1:14:42] when the conductor there happened to
[1:14:44] know he jumped up on a little box there
[1:14:46] and said look at here people you see how
[1:14:49] you're watching that poor woman there
[1:14:51] weeping her eyes
[1:14:53] out that what what he says you know that
[1:14:56] he went to Jerusalem and he was weeping
[1:14:58] ain't that right wept over Jerusalem
[1:15:01] saying oh how I would have done for you
[1:15:04] now notice he is watching that poor
[1:15:06] weeping there with her eyes out and when
[1:15:08] she he seen her own daughter turn away
[1:15:11] from her. Said, "Look at here, young
[1:15:13] woman." Said, "That's your mother. I
[1:15:15] don't care what she looks like. That's
[1:15:17] your mother." Amen. And then he goes on
[1:15:20] to say that I lived in the neighborhood.
[1:15:22] I know the
[1:15:24] story. Amen. Mama was out down by the
[1:15:27] spring getting water. And while she was
[1:15:29] down there, the house caught on fire. By
[1:15:33] the time Mama come back up there with
[1:15:34] her two buckets of water, guess what?
[1:15:36] The whole house was in flames. And it
[1:15:38] says here that her neighbors said she
[1:15:40] was going to go in there and get that
[1:15:41] baby. And even the firemen said, "Don't
[1:15:43] you go in
[1:15:45] there." No, don't you go in there. I
[1:15:47] imagine she shoved some firemen
[1:15:50] away. I imagine you pushed her way
[1:15:53] through and she put a blanket over her,
[1:15:55] that wet blanket, put it over her going
[1:15:57] in there. Amen. But to come out, she
[1:15:59] wrapped that blanket in her baby and she
[1:16:01] come through the flames
[1:16:03] and she got burnt and no doubt her meat
[1:16:06] was hanging off her. terrible perhaps
[1:16:08] how she looked and she was completely
[1:16:10] disfigured. He says before that the
[1:16:12] conductor said that she was beautiful as
[1:16:14] could be. How many knows that God is
[1:16:16] beautiful as could be but when he came
[1:16:18] to the earth there was no beauty in him
[1:16:21] that we would desire him. In other
[1:16:23] words, he wasn't much to look at. He
[1:16:26] didn't have a lot of beauty but he had
[1:16:27] beauty on the inside. Amen. And he says
[1:16:30] don't you ever be ashamed of her. Amen.
[1:16:33] She went in there and she is ugly just
[1:16:35] so that you could be beautiful. How many
[1:16:37] knows this morning, God became our sin
[1:16:39] so that we can become his righteousness.
[1:16:42] He took our ugliness. He became ugly so
[1:16:46] you could become pure party. So you can
[1:16:48] say, "And I will never be ashamed of
[1:16:50] that." I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:16:53] Christ. For it is the power of God unto
[1:16:56] salvation. Amen. To them that believe,
[1:16:58] to the Jew first and also to the
[1:17:00] Gentiles. Anybody that'll believe can be
[1:17:03] changed by the power of Almighty God.
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:09] Hallelujah. How many believe that?
[1:17:11] Thankful. That's right. It's time to
[1:17:13] call that out.
[1:17:15] Amen. I'm going to slow down a little
[1:17:17] bit. I want to just take off and let her
[1:17:19] go, but we're going to try take a couple
[1:17:21] more scriptures and we want to look at
[1:17:23] those who just absolutely turn such love
[1:17:28] away. Such love. I mean, that was love.
[1:17:32] It was It was the love in the woman that
[1:17:34] did it.
[1:17:35] She loved her baby. No, my baby will not
[1:17:38] die. My baby will not burn.
[1:17:43] How many knows that's the way God feels
[1:17:44] about you? My baby, my son, my daughter.
[1:17:47] No, they're not going to perish. All
[1:17:50] that the father has given me will come
[1:17:52] and I will lose none of
[1:17:54] them. Oh, Paul when he was preaching to
[1:17:57] the and the Jews were rejecting him and
[1:17:59] rejecting he says he says the Lord knows
[1:18:02] them that are his. He's not going to
[1:18:05] lose any of them. How many knows every
[1:18:06] name that's written on that book of
[1:18:08] life? If your name is on there, don't
[1:18:10] you worry about it. You're not going to
[1:18:11] be lost. God's going to see to it that
[1:18:13] you make it. You're not relying on
[1:18:16] yourself or a pastor or anything. You're
[1:18:18] relying on God. God said he would take
[1:18:21] you through and he will.
[1:18:26] That don't make you kick just a little.
[1:18:27] I don't know what
[1:18:28] will. God will.
[1:18:32] He's not going to lose a one. How many
[1:18:35] knows Jesus even prayed for you? I don't
[1:18:37] pray for just these, but I pray for
[1:18:39] those who are going to come. My
[1:18:41] children, my sheep that'll come
[1:18:42] afterwards.
[1:18:44] May they they're going to come and I'm
[1:18:45] not going to lose any one of them.
[1:18:50] Hallelujah. Now, what did I throw my
[1:18:52] glasses
[1:18:53] at?
[1:18:55] Amen. My We have a lot to be thankful
[1:18:58] for. Amen.
[1:19:04] We'll get into it in a minute hopefully.
[1:19:07] Why we act like we do? Why do we act
[1:19:10] like this? Why do we get happy? Why do
[1:19:12] we try to stay calm? Calm yourself down,
[1:19:17] Thomas. Come on. You don't have to
[1:19:19] scream and holler. You think they're
[1:19:21] deaf. Huh? Why do we do
[1:19:25] this? Talk about the power of God. The
[1:19:28] power of God. And I've heard a lot of it
[1:19:30] lately. Our brother uh Joe did preached
[1:19:33] on the power of God. We're gonna preach
[1:19:35] on the power of God. Amen. But you know,
[1:19:38] we're not just going to talk about the
[1:19:40] power of God this morning, but we're
[1:19:42] going to talk about what that power
[1:19:43] does.
[1:19:47] Amen. We're going to talk about what
[1:19:48] that power does.
[1:19:50] Amen.
[1:19:53] We know that there'll be people that'll
[1:19:57] heal the sick, raise the dead, move
[1:19:58] mountains, did many mighty works.
[1:20:02] You can do use the power of God, do many
[1:20:04] mighty
[1:20:06] works in his name, but he still didn't
[1:20:08] know him. So, you got to be careful
[1:20:10] about what you're focusing on.
[1:20:14] Amen. We'll talk about that in a minute.
[1:20:16] Let's talk about some of those that
[1:20:18] would not. Amen.
[1:20:28] First
[1:20:29] John 1 John 1 and verse 10 says he was
[1:20:32] in the world the world was made by him
[1:20:35] and the world knew him
[1:20:38] not know the world didn't know
[1:20:42] him. How many know the world today
[1:20:44] doesn't know him?
[1:20:47] The world was made by him. They were
[1:20:50] made by him and yet you don't know
[1:20:55] it. Katie Miller was my my mom's maiden
[1:20:59] name. Katie Ber, she was my mother. I
[1:21:03] know who my mama is. Thomas
[1:21:07] Ber, that was my
[1:21:10] dad. I'm Thomas Ber Jr. But Thomas Ber
[1:21:14] was my dad. I know who they are. But
[1:21:16] these people, they don't know who their
[1:21:18] daddy is. They don't know where to come
[1:21:20] from.
[1:21:22] What a terrible state to be.
[1:21:28] How many knows that sometimes adopted
[1:21:30] children have a little
[1:21:32] complex? Why did my mama forsake me?
[1:21:34] Who's my mama? Who's my daddy? I don't
[1:21:36] know where I come from. I don't know who
[1:21:38] my mom and daddy is. It's an issue. It
[1:21:41] helps them a lot to understand who they
[1:21:44] are. Next one. and he came to his own
[1:21:49] and his own received him
[1:21:53] not. They didn't receive him. He came to
[1:21:56] his own but his own refused
[1:22:02] him. What a terrible
[1:22:06] thing. a person that cares so much that
[1:22:10] he would become come to
[1:22:13] Calvary that he would become
[1:22:16] unrecognizable. Amen. Whipped beyond
[1:22:19] recognition till his ribs showed in the
[1:22:22] back. Crown of thorns put on him. Blood
[1:22:24] olive. Bloody
[1:22:26] lamb. How many brothers you know became
[1:22:28] the bloody
[1:22:30] lamb. That's right. And yet people don't
[1:22:33] appreciate it. They walk away. They
[1:22:36] don't want it. They
[1:22:39] received
[1:22:41] him not. In Matthew
[1:22:47] 21, Matthew
[1:22:50] 21 verse 32 says, "For John came unto
[1:22:53] you in the way of
[1:22:55] righteousness, and ye believed him not."
[1:22:59] They didn't accept him
[1:23:02] either. But the publicans and harlots
[1:23:05] believed
[1:23:06] him.
[1:23:08] Huh? When he when ye had seen it, you
[1:23:12] repented not afterwards that you might
[1:23:14] believe
[1:23:15] him. How many believe that? That's the
[1:23:18] thing that God is trying to get people
[1:23:20] to do is to
[1:23:23] repent, is to accept what he's done.
[1:23:33] All
[1:23:34] right, we're going to hurry through
[1:23:39] this. Try to get to our message.
[1:23:45] Revelations
[1:23:47] 2 and verse
[1:23:50] 21. 2 and verse 21 says it this way.
[1:23:57] Not with let's go with uh verse 20.
[1:24:00] Notwithstanding I have a few things
[1:24:01] against thee because thou sufferest that
[1:24:03] woman Jezebel which callest herself a
[1:24:05] prophetus to teach and to seduce my
[1:24:07] servants to commit fornication and to
[1:24:09] eat things sacrificed unto idols and I
[1:24:12] gave her space to repent. How many knows
[1:24:16] what brother Ram said? This was the
[1:24:17] Catholic Church. Way back in the day the
[1:24:21] Catholic Church had their chance to
[1:24:23] repent.
[1:24:26] How many know Cain had his chance to
[1:24:30] repent?
[1:24:31] The Catholic Church has their chance to
[1:24:34] repent. I gave her space to repent of
[1:24:36] her fornication and she repented
[1:24:42] not. I wanted you to understand
[1:24:45] something.
[1:24:48] The key to
[1:24:49] change, the key to the power to become
[1:24:54] transformed is in repentance.
[1:24:57] If you don't repent, there's no
[1:25:00] changing.
[1:25:03] That's the problem is so many people,
[1:25:05] they can even have faith to do powers
[1:25:07] and miracles without repenting.
[1:25:12] That's right. False anointed.
[1:25:15] Their nature never changes.
[1:25:18] All right, we're going to stop there.
[1:25:20] But she was given a chance to repent.
[1:25:22] Behold, I will cast her into a
[1:25:25] bed, and them that commit adultery with
[1:25:29] her into great tribulation. How many
[1:25:32] believe they're going to end up in the
[1:25:34] tribulation period?
[1:25:38] Except, isn't this something? Now, she
[1:25:41] didn't repent, but it says them that
[1:25:43] commit adultery with her except they
[1:25:46] repent of their
[1:25:49] deeds, and I will kill her children with
[1:25:52] death, that all the churches might know
[1:25:54] that I am he which searches the reigns
[1:25:56] and hearts. Brother Bab said, in every
[1:25:58] church age, the spirit always spoke to
[1:26:00] the true vine and the false vine. Here
[1:26:03] he was talking to speaking to that false
[1:26:05] vine. Isn't that right? That false
[1:26:07] church that didn't. and she had
[1:26:10] children. Then brother Bapt says
[1:26:12] Protestant Methodist
[1:26:13] Protestantism. All of the Protestants,
[1:26:16] her children, they were given a space to
[1:26:19] repent in our day. How many believe that
[1:26:22] they were given a chance? Brother Bam
[1:26:23] says, "Man, if I could just get the
[1:26:25] Baptist method, if I could get everybody
[1:26:27] together, then I would say, Lord, let
[1:26:29] your servant depart in peace." God tried
[1:26:32] his best to get them to repent. Did they
[1:26:34] repent? Where they at? No, they did not
[1:26:37] repent. All the churches shouldn't be
[1:26:39] Baptist. They shouldn't be Methodist.
[1:26:41] They shouldn't be Presbyterian. They
[1:26:42] should all be message believers.
[1:26:48] But they didn't want to repent.
[1:26:51] They would take their speaking in
[1:26:52] tongues is the initial evidence of the
[1:26:54] Holy Ghost over Jesus coming right down
[1:26:56] here doing the very same things he did
[1:26:58] when he was on the earth hundreds and
[1:27:00] thousands of times. Discerning the
[1:27:01] thoughts and intents of the heart. They
[1:27:03] took their own understanding. They went
[1:27:05] their own way.
[1:27:08] And God gave her space to repent. He was
[1:27:11] merciful. But she did not. And still end
[1:27:14] up in the tribulation
[1:27:19] period.
[1:27:24] Amen. Now, let's go in the tribulation
[1:27:27] period. Let's see what happens.
[1:27:29] Revelations 9.
[1:27:32] And it talks about I think in the
[1:27:36] uh let me see
[1:27:39] here why do I have that wrote down.
[1:27:42] Revelations 9.
[1:27:44] And how many knows brother Bam talked
[1:27:47] about those four
[1:27:49] uh angels loosed from at that were bound
[1:27:51] at the U river Euphrates and he
[1:27:53] mentioned Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini
[1:27:55] and so forth them being loosed the
[1:27:59] 200,000,000 demons that were loosed upon
[1:28:02] the
[1:28:03] Jews and there were four angels loosed
[1:28:06] right to kill the third part of men. The
[1:28:09] army of the horsemen, brother Brandham
[1:28:11] explains in the fifth and sixth seal.
[1:28:13] Amen. Where 200,000,000 horses, but he
[1:28:15] says there's not horses, but it's demon
[1:28:17] powers that went after the Jews. And of
[1:28:20] course, they slayed a third part. There
[1:28:22] was smoke. There was fire. There was
[1:28:23] brimstone. How many know a lot of fire?
[1:28:25] There's a lot of brimstone in World War
[1:28:27] II like unlike anything you've ever
[1:28:30] seen. And by these was the third part of
[1:28:33] men killed. Verse 18. and by fire, by
[1:28:35] smoke, and by brimstone, which issued
[1:28:37] out of their
[1:28:38] mouths. For their power is in their
[1:28:40] mouth, and their tails, and so forth.
[1:28:42] Tails were like serpents, and and at
[1:28:44] heads, and they with their heads they do
[1:28:47] hurt. Amen. And the rest of the men,
[1:28:51] which were not killed by these plagues,
[1:28:54] yet repented
[1:28:57] not. How many believe that's what it's
[1:28:59] about? God trying to get people to turn
[1:29:01] around, trying to surrender themselves
[1:29:04] to him, trying to recognize,
[1:29:08] hey, listen to this. Recognize
[1:29:12] this. Repent not of their the works of
[1:29:15] their
[1:29:16] hands. They listen, let me read it
[1:29:19] again. and the rest of the men which
[1:29:20] were not killed by these plagues, yet
[1:29:22] repented not of the works of their
[1:29:24] hands, that they should not worship
[1:29:27] devils, nor idols of
[1:29:30] money. Hello.
[1:29:33] Don't let money be your idol.
[1:29:37] You put that before God, it's your idol.
[1:29:40] Your business, whatever it might be,
[1:29:42] your job, making money. Well, I got to
[1:29:45] make better be careful.
[1:29:47] gold, silver, brass, stone, wood, which
[1:29:52] neither can see nor hear nor walk.
[1:29:56] Neither re repentant they of their
[1:29:59] murderers and their sorceries, nor of
[1:30:02] their fornications, nor their thefts. So
[1:30:05] after all, and let me ask you something,
[1:30:07] did World War II change them? No.
[1:30:16] If you ever do a study on World War II
[1:30:17] and how whole villages would be wiped
[1:30:20] out and whole so people's lives just
[1:30:24] meant
[1:30:26] nothing. Hello. You should realize, hey,
[1:30:29] these natural things don't mean much.
[1:30:32] This world don't mean much. It's that
[1:30:34] soul that's in here. That's what you
[1:30:36] need to be concerned about. Say, God,
[1:30:39] don't let me let that stuff be an idol
[1:30:41] to me.
[1:30:42] Don't let me worship no things
[1:30:45] but worship him.
[1:30:48] They've repented not. One
[1:30:52] more in 16 verse 7.
[1:30:59] And the fourth
[1:31:00] angel poured out his vial upon the
[1:31:05] sun, and power was given unto him to
[1:31:08] scorch men with
[1:31:11] fire. What? My How many knows you turned
[1:31:14] that sun degree up a little bit?
[1:31:18] My goodness. I don't know about you, but
[1:31:19] it's hot enough for me in the summer
[1:31:22] when it's 105, 110 degrees. Woo! Get me
[1:31:26] a air conditioner. But here when that
[1:31:29] fourth it says it's going to that the
[1:31:31] mouth's going to be poured on the sun
[1:31:33] and that angel is going to scorch
[1:31:35] people. You talk about getting hot.
[1:31:40] Amen. I know it's not cold this morning,
[1:31:42] but hey, how many know we're avoiding
[1:31:44] that a little bit more heat that hot? We
[1:31:46] don't want no part of that. But he
[1:31:48] scorched them with
[1:31:50] fire. And the men were scorched with
[1:31:53] great
[1:31:55] heat and blasphemed the name of God
[1:31:59] which had power over these plagues. And
[1:32:02] they repented not to give him
[1:32:09] glory. You talk about stubborn.
[1:32:13] I don't know about you, but usually when
[1:32:15] you have a hard time, where do you find
[1:32:17] yourself? On your knees, God, I need
[1:32:20] your help. Lord, I want to get past this
[1:32:23] sickness, this co or this trial, this
[1:32:27] terrible trial. I mean, God, I want to
[1:32:28] get through it. It causes you to fall on
[1:32:31] your knees. But these people refuse to
[1:32:33] fall on their knees. They refuse. No
[1:32:36] matter how hot it gets, no matter how
[1:32:38] much, Amen. They realize God is really
[1:32:40] God up there. But they blaspheme God.
[1:32:45] And I wrote down here when people are
[1:32:49] faced with the truth and they refuse to
[1:32:52] repent, there's only one explanation and
[1:32:54] that is the area of the lineage of
[1:32:56] Cain. They refuse to repent. They refuse
[1:33:00] just like he refused. He was given the
[1:33:03] opportunity to
[1:33:04] repent.
[1:33:06] Amen. But he would not. So even in a
[1:33:09] tribulation period, people still refuse
[1:33:12] to
[1:33:17] repent. You want me to tell you
[1:33:19] something good? Are you ready to hear
[1:33:21] something good? All right, I'm going to
[1:33:23] tell you something good. The scripture
[1:33:25] says it is the goodness of God. It's the
[1:33:28] goodness of God that leads you to
[1:33:31] repentance.
[1:33:33] Thank you, Lord. How many things say
[1:33:35] thank you Lord Jesus that you have led
[1:33:37] me to
[1:33:38] repentance that I can get down and say
[1:33:41] God I need you more than anything
[1:33:42] whatever you have I'll accept Lord I
[1:33:44] want you it's a goodness of God even
[1:33:49] here even there he says you know you
[1:33:52] know they're going to be cast into a bed
[1:33:54] of tribulation unless they accept
[1:33:56] repented their deeds if they would have
[1:33:58] just repented it makes all the
[1:34:03] Amen. Praise be to
[1:34:06] God.
[1:34:08] Amen. All
[1:34:11] right.
[1:34:14] Now, that is the group that would not
[1:34:18] they would not they wouldn't repent.
[1:34:23] How many
[1:34:24] knows? As many as I love, I rebuke and I
[1:34:30] chasen. Be zealous, therefore, and
[1:34:33] repent.
[1:34:36] Be very zealous. How many believe that's
[1:34:38] what we need to do? Be zealous to
[1:34:39] repent.
[1:34:41] When the word comes forth and it applies
[1:34:43] to you, say, "God, I want that out of my
[1:34:45] life. I want this out of my life."
[1:34:51] Amen.
[1:34:54] All
[1:34:55] right. Praise the Lord. Time is going
[1:34:57] slow for me this morning. Usually it's
[1:34:59] fast, but it's slow this morning. So,
[1:35:00] that's good because I need time. Praise
[1:35:03] the
[1:35:07] Lord.
[1:35:09] Now, we
[1:35:15] begin again.
[1:35:17] back to St.
[1:35:23] John. First
[1:35:25] John. So we read where he says that he
[1:35:28] came to his own and his own received him
[1:35:32] not.
[1:35:34] But Amen. I love that. Don't you?
[1:35:37] Everybody say but. As
[1:35:39] brother Andrew always says. Everybody
[1:35:42] say but. as many as received him.
[1:35:48] Aren't you glad that you're not a part
[1:35:50] of that other?
[1:35:52] No. This is the group I want to be a
[1:35:54] part of. I want to be a part of this
[1:35:57] group here found in the 12th verse. As
[1:35:59] many as received him, to them gave he
[1:36:02] power to become sons of God, even to
[1:36:06] them that believe on his name.
[1:36:13] Now we all love the How many loves the
[1:36:15] power of
[1:36:16] God? Our faith rests in the power of
[1:36:19] God. Paul said, "When I come to you, I
[1:36:21] come to you not with enticing words of
[1:36:23] man's wisdom, declaring unto you the
[1:36:26] testimony of God, but I come to you in
[1:36:28] power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:36:30] that your faith should not rest in the
[1:36:32] wisdom of man, but in the power of God."
[1:36:38] But let me ask you something. What does
[1:36:40] this power do? This power has it's got
[1:36:43] to do something.
[1:36:46] Just a power, power. Yeah, that's
[1:36:48] wonderful. But but I want to know what
[1:36:50] it does.
[1:36:53] Amen. Power, power, wonder, working
[1:36:56] power in the blood of the lamb.
[1:37:01] And what it is to
[1:37:03] do. Amen.
[1:37:08] where we picked off picked left off.
[1:37:11] See, he says the power that'll raise us
[1:37:14] up is in is in us right now. We are now
[1:37:18] in heavenly places. We are now in the
[1:37:21] power of the
[1:37:22] resurrection. But he says if there
[1:37:24] wasn't the law to that, sons and
[1:37:26] daughters of God would create them a
[1:37:28] world out there and go live on it. Amen.
[1:37:31] Amen. So, how does you've got the power
[1:37:35] in you right now to be able to create a
[1:37:38] world? In other words, when God at the
[1:37:40] beginning said, "Let there be earth." I
[1:37:43] don't know just how he did it. Maybe he
[1:37:44] says, "I want so many molecules. I want
[1:37:46] some atoms. I want some potassium. I
[1:37:49] want some uh pot ash. I want all these
[1:37:51] things." He says, "Let all of that come
[1:37:53] together." And he formed this world that
[1:37:55] we're on. And how many know is the only
[1:37:58] reason that you have the power that
[1:38:00] power in you is it has to be him.
[1:38:04] It ain't that you got nothing. It's that
[1:38:06] he's in there. He is the one that is the
[1:38:09] power to do it.
[1:38:11] Amen. But the point of it is is Amen. If
[1:38:14] he didn't restrict that, yes, you could
[1:38:16] actually say let there be and there was.
[1:38:21] How many know comes to mind just now?
[1:38:22] Moses, he said Moses speak. Ain't that
[1:38:25] right? Moses created flies and frogs and
[1:38:28] fleas and lice. All them
[1:38:30] irritating
[1:38:32] ticks. Huh? All them irritating things.
[1:38:36] But he spoke
[1:38:38] it. Isn't it something?
[1:38:41] That's why he says man that is
[1:38:42] completely surrendered to God's
[1:38:44] omnipotent. He's all powerful. It was
[1:38:48] the words that came out of Joshua's lips
[1:38:51] that said, "Son, stand still and moon
[1:38:53] and you stay in the valley over there
[1:38:56] and it all held
[1:38:57] still." And blow our mind to know to
[1:39:01] think that the planets could stop and
[1:39:03] nothing go wrong. I don't know how that
[1:39:06] happens when my mind is supposed to
[1:39:08] we're supposed to fly off or
[1:39:11] something. But no, you have the power.
[1:39:15] Amen.
[1:39:20] He had the power to just speak the word.
[1:39:22] And he
[1:39:24] did. We rest in the power of God. In his
[1:39:29] power.
[1:39:31] Amen. And in his
[1:39:34] power. All right. Now, notice this is
[1:39:37] where I want to get
[1:39:38] to. And this power is controlled by a
[1:39:41] law, the law of faith.
[1:39:44] Whatever God will lead your heart to
[1:39:46] believe, that's is yours. Amen. What God
[1:39:49] lays on your heart, like brother Bham,
[1:39:52] he's he was going squirrel hunting. The
[1:39:54] Holy Spirit said, "Just speak where you
[1:39:57] want those
[1:39:58] squirrels." Ain't that
[1:40:00] right? Or to the mountain, not the
[1:40:03] mountain, but to the storm. Whatever you
[1:40:06] say. How many knows that was God leading
[1:40:09] him to speak?
[1:40:12] Now you speak contrary to that you may
[1:40:15] not get it. It has to be that uncction
[1:40:18] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:22] Amen.
[1:40:24] Because guess
[1:40:26] what? This is the focus of evening light
[1:40:29] tabernacle. This is the focus of me as a
[1:40:32] pastor leading a
[1:40:35] group. I want to see the miracles. I
[1:40:38] want to see all that. That's all there.
[1:40:40] But I'm more
[1:40:41] concerned about Romans
[1:40:45] 8. But in Romans, this is my main
[1:40:51] concern. See, he says, "Also whom he did
[1:40:57] predestinate, he predestinated to be
[1:40:59] conformed to the image of his son." How
[1:41:03] many know there's a rapture coming up?
[1:41:06] Probably God said those in the bride are
[1:41:08] going to be in his very image. This is
[1:41:11] in order to be united with him. Oh thou
[1:41:15] spirit divine all by nature refined.
[1:41:19] Amen. People can move mountains. People
[1:41:21] can do this. But they can't change their
[1:41:23] nature. It takes God to change your
[1:41:26] nature. It takes God to change your
[1:41:28] desires, your passions.
[1:41:33] Woo. And that's what I'm interested in
[1:41:36] because guess what? You're not going to
[1:41:37] take your works and say, "Oh, we did
[1:41:39] this and oh, we did that." No. The only
[1:41:41] thing you're going to take with you is a
[1:41:43] Christlike character.
[1:41:48] To be Christlike.
[1:41:50] And the seed has been sown.
[1:41:54] Oh, whatever seed better said the spoken
[1:41:56] word, amen, goes in the ground, that's
[1:41:57] what it'll produce. And in this last day
[1:42:00] message, God has given us the seed
[1:42:02] that's going to produce a bride. And I
[1:42:04] believe it is happening in message
[1:42:06] churches.
[1:42:12] People that leave the message. I just
[1:42:14] don't
[1:42:15] understand. Of all the wrong that is in
[1:42:18] the
[1:42:19] message, I still believe that there's
[1:42:22] going to be people in this message
[1:42:24] that'll take the rapture. There's not
[1:42:26] another one. There's nothing somewhere
[1:42:28] else. No, this is it. How many believes
[1:42:31] that this is it? And that ain't never
[1:42:34] don't never look at the scarecrows and
[1:42:36] the phonies and the hypocrites. Don't
[1:42:37] even look at that. You look at the ro
[1:42:40] get your eyes on where it's supposed to
[1:42:42] be on the word of God. It's forming. How
[1:42:45] many believes it's forming a bride? I
[1:42:47] heard brother Bam says, "I don't care
[1:42:48] how many dark ages we have." He wouldn't
[1:42:50] care if we went through another dark
[1:42:52] ages. He said, "God is going to have a
[1:42:54] church without spot and without wrinkle.
[1:42:57] We are going to be changed in a moment,
[1:43:00] in the twinkling of an eye." That's what
[1:43:02] I'm interested
[1:43:04] in. Paul says, "From glory to glory." We
[1:43:07] look at the glass of the word. Amen.
[1:43:09] We're changed from glory to glory. Every
[1:43:13] time you come in those doors, guess
[1:43:15] what? A little more change is taking
[1:43:17] place. When you go out there, you you
[1:43:19] were not going to go out the same.
[1:43:21] You're going to go worse. You're going
[1:43:22] to go better.
[1:43:26] Amen.
[1:43:29] From glory to glory, he's changing me.
[1:43:38] Amen.
[1:43:40] Do you realize this
[1:43:44] morning
[1:43:46] that
[1:43:49] God working by his law to control this
[1:43:53] power has to give you
[1:43:57] faith? Amen. He's got to give it to
[1:44:02] you. Let me if I can find this quote
[1:44:06] that we left off and didn't get to. See
[1:44:10] the very next thing he was preaching on
[1:44:11] the everpresent water from the rock.
[1:44:14] When God saved you, he gives you
[1:44:17] faith to rise above the muck of the
[1:44:20] earth. Amen. See, we are saved by faith
[1:44:24] by grace through faith. That not of
[1:44:27] yourself. It's the gift of God. How many
[1:44:30] means if you ever get a hold of God,
[1:44:32] it's a gift that God gives you to
[1:44:34] believe that he is.
[1:44:37] If you ain't got nothing else to be
[1:44:39] happy about, if you ain't got nothing
[1:44:40] else to rejoice about, if you want some
[1:44:42] deep dark mystery, let me tell you a
[1:44:44] deep dark mystery. It is the grace of
[1:44:46] God that he puts in you to receive him
[1:44:49] and not reject
[1:44:51] him. To get the new
[1:44:53] birth, to be born again. God grants you
[1:44:56] that
[1:44:58] faith.
[1:45:00] Amen. Don't you all start hopping at
[1:45:03] once. We got concrete floors. You ain't
[1:45:06] going to bust nothing
[1:45:07] down. Amen. I thought that's just
[1:45:10] wonderful, isn't it? See, over faith
[1:45:12] overcomes the thing of the world. What
[1:45:14] is your faith? Your faith is that act
[1:45:17] that God has did in you to make you a
[1:45:21] son and daughter of God. Now, how many
[1:45:23] knows that's just the
[1:45:25] beginning? That's just the start.
[1:45:27] Getting saved and to become a child of
[1:45:29] God is just the
[1:45:30] beginning. Amen.
[1:45:35] We make the
[1:45:41] statement, I'm not what I ought to be.
[1:45:44] Amen. How many say I'm not what I ought
[1:45:47] to be? I'm not ought to be, but there's
[1:45:49] one thing I
[1:45:50] know that I'm not what I used to
[1:45:54] be.
[1:45:56] Glory. How many believe when God saves
[1:45:59] you, he changed your destiny?
[1:46:03] We make another statement. We make
[1:46:05] another phrase
[1:46:07] called brother David says that I do. If
[1:46:11] it wouldn't have been for the grace of
[1:46:12] God, brother Urban, Sister M, where
[1:46:15] would you be?
[1:46:22] Where would you be? Most of us have
[1:46:26] admit probably we'd be dead. Devil
[1:46:29] probably already took us because that's
[1:46:30] his ambition is take you. But there's no
[1:46:33] telling our destiny and where our course
[1:46:35] would have taken us. But I'm glad for
[1:46:38] that intersection in my life. Aren't you
[1:46:40] glad for that intersection that God
[1:46:42] turned you and he changed
[1:46:45] you? You who were dead in sins and
[1:46:48] trespasses has he quickened. He's made
[1:46:52] alive. Now you're not going down that
[1:46:54] I'm glad I go down that road. I'm an old
[1:46:57] man. I'm still as happy as I could ever
[1:46:59] be.
[1:47:01] I got fullness of joy. I got peace like
[1:47:03] never before. Why? Because of him. Thank
[1:47:06] you Jesus for changing my destiny.
[1:47:12] How many know second Peter
[1:47:15] has he says having
[1:47:18] uh given us great exceeding and great
[1:47:22] precious promises that by these you
[1:47:25] might be partakers of the divine nature.
[1:47:31] Now, I wrote down here, Brother Troy, I
[1:47:34] hope it's accurate. If it ain't, you can
[1:47:36] come come and correct
[1:47:42] me. One place the scripture says that we
[1:47:45] were by nature the children of wrath. Is
[1:47:49] that right? We were by nature the
[1:47:51] children of wrath. In other words, we
[1:47:53] were by nature a pig.
[1:47:57] But I wrote there, I was a sheep, Tommy,
[1:48:01] but I was a sheep
[1:48:04] with a pig nature.
[1:48:10] I wasn't a pig and changed into a sheep.
[1:48:16] No. Just like brother Bam says, a
[1:48:18] rainbow trout is always a rainbow
[1:48:20] stripe.
[1:48:22] Amen.
[1:48:24] But whenever you were born with the
[1:48:26] wrong nature, born the wrong way, how
[1:48:28] many knows our first nature, the lust of
[1:48:30] the flesh is everything evil. The nature
[1:48:33] of a pig, that's what we wallered in
[1:48:36] late at night and everything. We
[1:48:38] wallered in that. We had our past
[1:48:40] conversation, but I like it. The brother
[1:48:42] said, he says, you were only by nature
[1:48:45] that that was not the real you. The real
[1:48:49] you is that you was a sheep and you
[1:48:51] needed to have a nature
[1:48:54] change. Glory. Why do you get so happy,
[1:48:57] Brother Violet? Why do we scream and
[1:48:59] holler? I don't tell you what. We don't
[1:49:00] just scream and holler and worship or or
[1:49:02] say these things. And when we when we
[1:49:05] tap our hands, when we shout, it's
[1:49:07] because of our praise to him. That's
[1:49:10] what we come to the house of God for.
[1:49:12] We're praising God. If you don't like
[1:49:14] it, don't go to heaven cuz it's going to
[1:49:16] be noisy over there.
[1:49:19] Now I'm not waiting till I get over
[1:49:21] there to start appreciating what God had
[1:49:23] done for me. Amen. Amen. As that song
[1:49:26] says, well, you just don't know that I
[1:49:28] know what he's done for me. I know what
[1:49:31] he's done for me.
[1:49:33] That's why I pray. That's why we do it.
[1:49:36] That's why we get noisy.
[1:49:40] the Pentecostals and those folk, they
[1:49:43] would take all the
[1:49:44] steam, all the power, he said, and blow
[1:49:46] it out the whistle.
[1:49:49] Choo
[1:49:51] choo. Choo choo.
[1:49:54] Glory. I like the seam coming out the
[1:49:57] whistle. Amen. If there ain't a little
[1:49:59] seam coming out the whistle, brother
[1:50:00] brother Tommy, I wonder what in the
[1:50:02] world's going on. Nobody ever says,
[1:50:05] "Amen. Preach it, brother." Nobody ever
[1:50:07] scream.
[1:50:09] Never ever anybody rejoice. I wonder.
[1:50:12] But I want you to know there's more than
[1:50:14] just the steam coming out of the whip.
[1:50:17] There is power that's turning these big
[1:50:19] engines and making you into a person
[1:50:22] that looks acts acts like Jesus Christ.
[1:50:25] Act like a lady. Take a prostitute and
[1:50:28] change her into a lady. Take a brute
[1:50:31] beast man. Amen. Unfaithful and
[1:50:33] everything else. And make a gentleman
[1:50:35] out of him. That's what the power of God
[1:50:37] will
[1:50:39] do. Take a sinner and make him a saint.
[1:50:42] Take a dirty man and make him white as
[1:50:44] snow. Though your ch be a scarlet, he'll
[1:50:47] be white as snow.
[1:50:50] That's what I'm talking about. Amen. God
[1:50:53] change me from my old man to my new man.
[1:51:08] God is good.
[1:51:10] I praise him for what he does.
[1:51:15] Still not what I ought to be, but I'm
[1:51:18] changing.
[1:51:20] Changing. And it takes God to change.
[1:51:24] You got a husband that won't You just
[1:51:26] can't make him right. You can't make him
[1:51:28] treat you the way you ought to. Why
[1:51:30] don't you get him in the presence of God
[1:51:32] one time? Get him under the power of the
[1:51:34] Holy Ghost. That's the only thing
[1:51:36] that'll change him. You get a woman
[1:51:38] that's unfaithful or this or that or the
[1:51:40] other. You've got a nightmare. You got
[1:51:43] water in your blood. But guess what?
[1:51:45] When the Holy Ghost gets a hold of them.
[1:51:47] Amen. They'll be changed.
[1:51:56] Brother Bram says power transformation.
[1:51:59] That's what transform means. To change
[1:52:01] from one thing to
[1:52:04] another. How is that song? It goes, "Oh,
[1:52:07] from that creature that I once was. Oh,
[1:52:11] I've been changed. I've been
[1:52:14] reborn. I've been washed by the blood of
[1:52:17] the lamb."
[1:52:19] Amen. I don't know. I wanted to have a
[1:52:22] song service afterwards. I wanted to
[1:52:23] sing that song. That thumb's always
[1:52:26] going on my mind. I've been reborn. How
[1:52:29] many's glad they have been changed?
[1:52:33] Thank you, Jesus. I've been changed.
[1:52:36] We've
[1:52:37] changed. And we got to continue to
[1:52:40] change. Get more in his image. Take a
[1:52:43] little more of this out. God is building
[1:52:45] the statue of a perfect man. How many
[1:52:47] knows? Amen. Brother says, "Add to your
[1:52:49] faith virtue to knowledge and temperance
[1:52:51] and patience and godliness and then per
[1:52:53] keep on adding. Lord, help me. Keep on
[1:52:56] changing me.
[1:52:58] Get me in that
[1:52:59] statue. The stature. Not statue,
[1:53:07] but a stature of a perfect man. You love
[1:53:11] him this morning. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:15] Because how many knows one of these days
[1:53:17] Paul says when he comes, we'll be
[1:53:20] changed in the moment, in the twinkling
[1:53:23] of an eye.
[1:53:25] Amen. It takes God to change your
[1:53:28] desires.
[1:53:30] It takes God. It takes the Holy Spirit
[1:53:33] power to change your very thirst and
[1:53:36] what you
[1:53:38] love. Let me just read what he
[1:53:42] said.
[1:53:44] See, your faith overcomes the things of
[1:53:46] what is your faith? Your faith is the
[1:53:47] act of God in you to make you a son of
[1:53:50] God. you quit your lying, quit your
[1:53:52] stealing, quit your drinking because
[1:53:55] faith raises you above it. Amen. If you
[1:53:58] don't do it, then you didn't really have
[1:54:00] faith.
[1:54:02] Amen. How many knows that when he came
[1:54:03] and he washed our sins away? And he
[1:54:06] talks about he says that they uh all of
[1:54:08] their sins and all of that is never to
[1:54:10] be remembered anymore. But what he does,
[1:54:13] he comes in and if somebody would go
[1:54:16] back and disbelieve, there's no more
[1:54:17] remission for. But God comes to change
[1:54:20] the very desire.
[1:54:23] Take the desire for sin out.
[1:54:27] If that hasn't happened to you, then you
[1:54:29] have not gone deep enough. Amen.
[1:54:33] Not gone deep enough.
[1:54:35] Now, how many knows no matter how holy
[1:54:37] you are, how righteous you are, this
[1:54:39] flesh is always present and you've got
[1:54:41] to keep it down.
[1:54:43] Amen.
[1:54:45] Praise be to God. To raise us up above
[1:54:48] it. How many believe that's what true
[1:54:51] victory is? Victory over sin. He came to
[1:54:55] deliver us from sin, not to be in
[1:54:57] bondage to sin. All right, let me let me
[1:55:00] close with this with this. We're going
[1:55:02] to leave some of this other off. Let's
[1:55:03] just
[1:55:04] go. You know, people want
[1:55:09] power. Amen. And they really don't know
[1:55:12] what power is.
[1:55:19] Amen. I mean, there's a real genuine
[1:55:22] power of God. It changes your desires
[1:55:26] and your nature. That's what I want of
[1:55:28] everything. I don't want to come over
[1:55:30] there and say, "Well, I'll tell you
[1:55:31] what. prayed for so and so and this one
[1:55:33] had this happened that the other. Sure,
[1:55:36] I want all of that to happen. But that's
[1:55:37] not what we rely on. We rely on our
[1:55:40] character matching Jesus Christ.
[1:55:44] See, he says what goes with it is the
[1:55:46] way up is down. Remember I said
[1:55:49] Wednesday, he says, "Well, the only way
[1:55:50] to really if you really want to be
[1:55:51] filled with the God power, make sure
[1:55:53] that you are dead to yourself and that
[1:55:55] you are completely surrendered to God.
[1:56:01] Brother Bam says, he says, "If you want
[1:56:04] power, see how humble you can get. Just
[1:56:07] get away from all of your worldly
[1:56:08] thinking, be humble yourself before God,
[1:56:12] and then you've got
[1:56:14] power more than the man that runs all
[1:56:18] over the building and makes a big bunch
[1:56:20] of noise because you've been able to
[1:56:24] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[1:56:27] God." How many believe that's the real
[1:56:29] power? Amen. By conquering yourself and
[1:56:32] by committing yourself to God. That's
[1:56:34] real power. I want power like the three
[1:56:37] Hebrew children had. They said he's
[1:56:39] going to deliver us. But if not,
[1:56:43] oh, I didn't get to preach that
[1:56:44] Wednesday. But if not, even God don't
[1:56:46] answer you. You don't get what you want.
[1:56:48] I don't care. I'm still gonna serve him.
[1:56:51] I'm gonna love him anyway. But if not,
[1:56:54] we're not gonna bow to the devil. We're
[1:56:56] going to love him anyhow. That's real
[1:57:00] power. Power is to completely commit
[1:57:02] yourself to God. Submit yourself.
[1:57:06] Surrender
[1:57:08] yourself to do what God said do. We want
[1:57:12] to be like Jesus was. Isn't that right?
[1:57:14] He says, "You do nothing. I always do
[1:57:16] that which pleases the
[1:57:19] father and I do nothing but what my
[1:57:21] father shows me first."
[1:57:24] How many believes you ought to pray
[1:57:25] about it?
[1:57:29] Listen, let me just give you a
[1:57:31] little experience of mine. I'm not going
[1:57:33] to share the experience, but I'm just
[1:57:34] going to give you the outcome of it.
[1:57:37] There are things that I've prayed for.
[1:57:40] I've prayed for this. I I'd like this.
[1:57:42] I'd like that. Something I desire.
[1:57:43] Something that I just
[1:57:44] wanted. All right.
[1:57:50] You say,
[1:57:51] "Well, the Bible
[1:57:54] says keep your blessed is he whose mind
[1:57:57] is stayed on
[1:57:59] thee." How does that go? And he shall
[1:58:02] give you the desires of your heart.
[1:58:04] There's different scriptures. That's not
[1:58:05] the right
[1:58:07] scripture. But anyway, there's another
[1:58:09] scripture talks
[1:58:10] about putting God
[1:58:13] first and he'll give you the desires of
[1:58:15] your heart. And you know, I have found
[1:58:18] that if you don't get hasty about it,
[1:58:20] don't get in a rush. Leave it there. God
[1:58:23] knows what you want. God knows what your
[1:58:25] heart's desire is. And then you just
[1:58:28] watch God work. But a lot of times we
[1:58:29] get so quick. Okay, it's got to happen
[1:58:31] today. No, just give God time. So that's
[1:58:33] my my that's my my advice is when you
[1:58:36] pray for something, don't get in a hurry
[1:58:37] about it. Give God time. He'll get to
[1:58:40] it.
[1:58:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. I believe he is
[1:58:44] that way.
[1:58:46] You've been able to conquer yourself.
[1:58:48] You got more power if you can if you can
[1:58:50] completely I remember brother Billy Ler
[1:58:53] I think he mentioned this one time and
[1:58:54] I've always stuck with me and I've I
[1:58:56] found it. He says he that ruleth his
[1:58:58] spirit is mightier than he that takes a
[1:59:01] city. Amen. If you can take a whole city
[1:59:03] if you can rule your spirit your
[1:59:06] attitude. Ain't that right? Your mind.
[1:59:08] No. Nope. Nope. That thought's not going
[1:59:09] to come. Is that right? Nope. Just get
[1:59:11] on out. You're mightier than he that
[1:59:13] taketh the city. Because look at all
[1:59:15] those droves of people that do not have
[1:59:18] control of themselves. How many knows
[1:59:20] those people do not have control of
[1:59:25] themselves? Show me a church that's
[1:59:27] humble, real humble, not arrogant, just
[1:59:29] a sweet, humble church. And I'll show
[1:59:34] you a church that has the favor of God
[1:59:36] and the power of God in it. How many
[1:59:39] believe we need to be sweet and kind and
[1:59:42] gentle and meek to each other? Amen.
[1:59:49] But when we get
[1:59:50] arrogant, Amen. and boastful on
[1:59:53] everything else, the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:59:55] live in that. Doesn't dwell in that.
[1:59:59] Amen. See, that's right. That's the
[2:00:02] thing it takes is humility, humbling
[2:00:04] ourselves before God and letting God
[2:00:06] just work through us. You don't have to
[2:00:08] make a lot of noise. How many know it's
[2:00:11] not about the We love the noise, but
[2:00:13] it's not about the
[2:00:18] noise. I'm thankful to be in the
[2:00:20] message. You know why? Because the
[2:00:21] preachers that come through here, we
[2:00:23] don't get noisy just to be
[2:00:25] noisy. We get a little noisy because of
[2:00:27] the word that they bring.
[2:00:30] Because of what they say, what the
[2:00:32] principle of it is. Amen. When we clap
[2:00:34] or applaud, it's not the man, it's the
[2:00:36] word we're applauding. Amen. Because man
[2:00:39] doesn't deserve applaud. God deserves
[2:00:41] applaud. That's what we applaud. That's
[2:00:43] what we raise our voices for.
[2:00:46] Amen. I wrote down here, you know,
[2:00:48] sometimes we get a little noisy, but
[2:00:49] when a preacher talks about Isaiah 36,
[2:00:52] hey, when my wife goes back there and
[2:00:54] scream a little, that don't bother me a
[2:00:56] bit. That's perfectly well. Worshiping
[2:00:58] God for what he does in our lives.
[2:01:01] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many's
[2:01:04] looking forward to the meetings coming
[2:01:05] up? Amen. I get to take another good
[2:01:08] long break. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[2:01:10] God bless you. Amen. And go back and
[2:01:14] just really
[2:01:15] enjoy. I know I'm going to make sure
[2:01:17] that I take take time and just really
[2:01:21] focus focus on the meetings. Amen. And
[2:01:24] the Holy
[2:01:26] Spirit. I want to say this. This is not
[2:01:29] about evening night tabernacle having a
[2:01:31] big meeting.
[2:01:33] and oh, we got a pig. And it's not what
[2:01:35] it's about. It is about perhaps some of
[2:01:39] those friends and those relatives and
[2:01:41] people, amen, in our local areas that we
[2:01:44] could come and if we could lead a soul
[2:01:45] to Christ. If we could get some
[2:01:48] backsliders back to God, that's our
[2:01:50] goal. I mean, that's our ambition. It's
[2:01:52] not about bigness. It's not about that.
[2:01:54] God's not in
[2:01:58] that. Amen. It's not in that. It's about
[2:02:01] trying to do something for the Lord.
[2:02:04] Amen. God bless you. Now, we'll take and
[2:02:09] remember Paul said, "When I came unto
[2:02:11] you, I didn't want to hear anything
[2:02:13] except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[2:02:15] Because how many That's where it all
[2:02:17] hinges from. That's where it all come
[2:02:18] from. When Jesus left, he says, you
[2:02:21] know, they were to take the bread and
[2:02:22] the wine and do this in remembrance of
[2:02:25] me of what he did. How did he made all
[2:02:27] of this available? and how that he
[2:02:29] suffered and how he became
[2:02:30] unrecognizable. He became ugly so that
[2:02:33] we could become beautiful in here. Amen.
[2:02:36] We want to remember that this morning.
[2:02:38] Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's
[2:02:40] stand. We'll change the order of
[2:02:53] service. Let's go to the book of
[2:02:55] Corinthians.
