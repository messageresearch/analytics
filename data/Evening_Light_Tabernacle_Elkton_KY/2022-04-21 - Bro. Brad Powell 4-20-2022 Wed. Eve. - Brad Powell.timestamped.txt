[26:09] he is the kingdom of your heart this
[26:10] this night this evening
[26:12] good to be in the house of the lord
[26:14] and uh it's kind of another rainy dreary
[26:17] night but
[26:18] uh praise god we're able to be here
[26:21] and
[26:22] you know last wednesday we wasn't able
[26:23] to to meet and it's uh it's always
[26:26] frustrating uh
[26:27] when you you're
[26:29] prepared and you're wanting to be in the
[26:30] house of the lord and then something
[26:32] like that happens but
[26:33] you you kind of have to use judgment and
[26:36] and
[26:37] look at the protect the people and make
[26:39] sure that you know try to do the best
[26:41] you can and uh we're thankful for
[26:43] deacons that that think think ahead and
[26:46] and you know look out and
[26:48] and take care of those situations like
[26:50] that so
[26:51] good to be in the house lord we won't
[26:53] keep you standing long
[26:55] i just do want to kind of finish and
[26:57] where i started the last sunday that i
[26:59] preached i guess it was and i just want
[27:02] to say i appreciate the message brother
[27:03] byler preached on sunday on i believe
[27:06] and
[27:07] you know i thought man the more i
[27:08] thought about that i thought i believe
[27:10] and
[27:11] you know if more people just believed
[27:13] what kind of world would we live in you
[27:15] know brother branham he made a statement
[27:17] he talked about if i think if he said if
[27:19] he got to the end and they said he
[27:21] couldn't even enter into heaven he would
[27:23] live just like he is today
[27:25] and i thought man if i could just if
[27:27] people would just live
[27:29] a christian life what kind of world
[27:31] would we live in
[27:34] just the simple rules you know the it it
[27:37] you know just uh just following the the
[27:39] commandments of the of christian living
[27:42] there'd be no murder no adultery no you
[27:45] know sin i mean people would just get
[27:46] along you you'd never have a a rift with
[27:49] your neighbor
[27:50] you know everything would just be great
[27:52] but that's not the world we live in
[27:55] so
[27:56] turn with me if you would in your bibles
[27:58] and and we're going to look into exodus
[28:00] and i'm going to also read a portion of
[28:02] scripture out of mark
[28:04] and uh out of the book of hebrews so if
[28:06] you want to just kind of tag those and
[28:07] i'm gonna try not to stay keep you too
[28:09] long and
[28:11] we spoke last time on changing clothes
[28:13] and we looked at esther and mordecai and
[28:16] we brought out there in isaiah 61 and
[28:18] luke 4 where jesus was reading the
[28:20] prophecies it was given about him and
[28:22] and
[28:23] and we talked about the garment of
[28:24] praise and
[28:25] and
[28:27] what what mordecai when he was you know
[28:29] in the land there and he rented his
[28:31] clothes he had ashes and so forth put on
[28:33] him and
[28:34] sackcloth so we're going to look at it a
[28:36] little different tonight and and try to
[28:37] apply it to
[28:39] us and and jesus and we want to title
[28:41] this living behind the veil and we know
[28:44] a veil is a covering
[28:46] and and so in the very beginning there
[28:49] in the garden of eden you have adam and
[28:51] eve and uh covering was given to them to
[28:54] hide their nakedness and and because
[28:56] they had fallen and and it served as a
[28:58] barrier kind of so to speak between them
[29:00] and god
[29:01] and when any time you're talking about a
[29:03] veil in the bible that's kind of what
[29:05] you look at so
[29:07] um
[29:08] looking here i want to read you this
[29:09] quote brother brown said men and women
[29:11] he said how could you turn
[29:13] such a one down
[29:15] when he is sitting there clothed in his
[29:18] majesty
[29:19] he sits in glory this morning
[29:22] what do you do
[29:24] he came here to the world homeless to
[29:27] make a way for homeless men and women
[29:29] where men and women who has no hope for
[29:32] men and women who has no place to go
[29:34] where homeless wanderers and those who
[29:36] are pla or pleasure crazy walking down
[29:39] the streets today horse races gambling
[29:41] and so forth trying to find comfort he
[29:43] made a place for him every man it's just
[29:46] as free as the water runs whosoever will
[29:50] let him come
[29:51] now listen to what he says he says you
[29:53] can't walk outside of this veil
[29:57] he said you've got to come in here
[30:00] you've got to come in here you've got to
[30:02] find out you've got to get here
[30:04] where there's nothing between you
[30:07] and god
[30:09] so adam and eve as we said they started
[30:11] out and they had this cover in between
[30:13] as a barrier kind of hiding between them
[30:16] and god
[30:18] but he says you can't stay there we got
[30:19] to get into we got to get in here where
[30:21] there's nothing between you and god he
[30:23] says where the angels of god can descend
[30:25] and ascend back and forth bringing the
[30:28] messages of god and back and forth to
[30:30] who he says the individual
[30:34] he didn't say this church or that church
[30:37] or this group or those under this pastor
[30:40] or that pastor no the individual it's
[30:42] between you and i and god
[30:45] the individual
[30:48] he says and there he sits nothing
[30:50] between my soul and my savior there he
[30:53] sits the mighty conqueror
[30:55] and he rent every veil in two he rent
[30:58] the veil that you could be saved he rent
[31:00] the veil that if you've committed
[31:02] adultery if you've cursed if you've done
[31:04] anything wrong those are some big things
[31:06] if you've done anything wrong
[31:08] he rent that veil for you
[31:11] that stick that satan holds over you
[31:16] how many has ever had satan beat you in
[31:18] the head with a stick
[31:20] he rent that veil for you he said he
[31:23] rent it all you have to do is receive
[31:25] him if you're sick today and the doctor
[31:27] says you can't get well he rent that
[31:29] veil into
[31:31] and everything is broken before god he
[31:33] rent every veil he tears down every
[31:37] domain
[31:40] there's nothing satan can do
[31:43] that can hinder you
[31:44] if you stand behind the veil if you're
[31:47] living behind the veil with god
[31:50] he tears down every domain he sits there
[31:52] today the mighty conqueror
[31:55] since he rent the veil into
[31:58] exodus 26 moreover
[32:01] thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten
[32:04] curtains
[32:05] of fine twine linen and blue and purple
[32:09] and scarlet
[32:10] with cherubims of cunning works
[32:14] shout thou make them let's just bow our
[32:16] heads heavenly father we thank you lord
[32:19] for this day you've given us for
[32:21] your grace and mercy and for allowing us
[32:23] to gather tonight and freedom and to
[32:26] worship you in spirit and truth
[32:28] uh there's many around the world that
[32:30] can't gather like this tonight and
[32:32] brothers and sisters in china and
[32:33] different places that have to have
[32:35] little hidden fellowships and hidden
[32:37] communions and but lord we've been
[32:40] granted freedom that we can come and
[32:41] worship worship you tonight with
[32:43] boldness
[32:44] and we can lift your name up and praise
[32:46] you and we can gladly say the name of
[32:48] jesus
[32:50] to the world so that the world can hear
[32:52] it lord and we're thankful for that lord
[32:54] we just ask tonight as we look at this
[32:55] little thought that you would bless the
[32:57] meditation of our hearts and mind and
[32:59] that you would just lead us and guide us
[33:01] and open our hearts to receive open the
[33:03] ears of the hearers and anoint the lips
[33:05] of the speaker lord as i commit myself
[33:08] into your hands now in jesus name we
[33:09] pray amen amen you can be seated
[33:13] sorry to keep you standing so long
[33:17] i'm also going to read out of mark 15
[33:20] and i'm going to read kind of a lengthy
[33:22] lengthy portion of scripture here
[33:24] but i think it's to to draw a picture
[33:26] that we need to look at tonight
[33:28] and and see exactly what this veil means
[33:31] and what this relationship with god
[33:33] means
[33:34] mark 15
[33:36] and straight way in the morning the
[33:37] chief priest held a consultation with
[33:39] the elders and scribes and the whole
[33:41] council
[33:43] and bound jesus
[33:46] and carried him away and delivered him
[33:47] to pilate
[33:49] and so pilate willing to to content the
[33:52] people released barabbas unto them
[33:56] and delivered jesus which he had
[33:58] scourged him to be crucified so we've
[34:01] got a murderer and a savior what a
[34:04] combination
[34:06] released a murderer and
[34:08] imprisoned and and
[34:11] crucified a savior
[34:13] and the soldier led him away into the
[34:14] hall
[34:15] called praetorium which i want you to
[34:18] notice this is just means a common hall
[34:20] this is a common place that the governor
[34:22] would have been in the in in the in the
[34:24] palace or in the rank there so it's a
[34:26] common place
[34:28] and they call together the whole band
[34:31] and watch now they clothed him with
[34:33] purple
[34:35] royalty
[34:36] and planted a crown of thorns and put it
[34:38] about his head and they began to salute
[34:40] him hail king of the jews
[34:42] they smote him on the head with a reed
[34:44] and did spit upon him and bowing their
[34:46] knees worshiped him
[34:48] and when they had mocked him they took
[34:50] off the purple
[34:52] now we've been talking about clothes and
[34:54] covering and colors and different
[34:55] symbolism and going on in the bible so
[34:58] look how they looked at him first they
[34:59] mocked him by putting purple on him
[35:02] then they mocked him by taking purple
[35:04] off of him and then they put back on his
[35:06] own clothes it says and they let him out
[35:08] to crucify him
[35:10] and they compel one simon the cyrenian
[35:13] who passed in the coming of the country
[35:15] and we'll skip on down and they bring to
[35:16] him to a place called galgotha which is
[35:19] being interpreted the place of the
[35:20] school
[35:21] and they gave him to drink wine mangled
[35:23] with myrrh but he received it not
[35:26] and when they had crucified him now
[35:28] watch what they did they parted his
[35:30] garments
[35:31] casting lots upon them of what every man
[35:34] should take
[35:35] and it was the third hour
[35:37] these are all important the third hour
[35:39] it's important with what we're going to
[35:40] talk about here in just a minute
[35:42] and they crucified him
[35:44] and the superscription of the accusation
[35:46] was written over the king of the jews
[35:49] and with him they crucified two thieves
[35:52] the one on the right and one on his left
[35:54] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[35:56] saith he was numbered with the
[35:57] transgressors
[36:00] and they
[36:02] that passed by
[36:04] rallied on him
[36:06] wagging their heads and saying ah thou
[36:08] that destroys the temple
[36:10] and build it in three days save thyself
[36:12] come down from the cross
[36:14] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[36:17] said unto themselves with scribes he
[36:19] saved others himself he cannot save
[36:22] let christ the king of israel descend
[36:24] now from the cross that we may see and
[36:26] believe
[36:27] and they that were crucified with him
[36:30] reviled him
[36:32] and when the sixth hour was come there
[36:34] was darkness over the whole land until
[36:36] the ninth hour
[36:37] and the ninth hour jesus cried with a
[36:39] loud voice saying iloilo
[36:43] which is being interpreted my god my god
[36:46] why hast thou forsaken me
[36:52] you realize that was for you and me
[36:57] why have you forsaken me
[36:59] my god why have you forsaken me
[37:02] and some of them stood by when they
[37:03] heard and said behold he calleth the
[37:06] lies
[37:06] and one ran and filled a sponge full of
[37:08] vinegar and put it on a reed and gave
[37:10] him a drink saying let alone let us see
[37:13] whether our lies come to take him down
[37:16] and jesus cried with a loud voice and
[37:18] gave up the ghost
[37:20] and the veil of the temple was rent and
[37:22] twain from top to bottom
[37:27] and when the centurion which stood over
[37:29] against him saw that
[37:31] he so cried out and gave up the ghost he
[37:33] said truly
[37:35] this man
[37:37] was the son of god
[37:39] brother brown said you look at that
[37:40] roman soldier that stood there and
[37:41] pierced his pierced him messiah pierced
[37:43] his heart with the sword and the spear
[37:46] and he looked up at him and he saw the
[37:48] earth turning black the buildings begin
[37:51] shaking the temple veil was rent from
[37:53] top to bottom and he throwed his hand
[37:55] over his heart and he said truly that
[37:58] was the son of god
[38:00] he said yes sir he said his own arc
[38:02] enemies at the time had to testify of
[38:04] who he was
[38:07] the roman centurion his arc enemy who
[38:10] would pierce him now had to stand before
[38:12] him and say my this truly was the man of
[38:15] god
[38:17] what significant is that
[38:20] it's amazing turn with me to hebrews 10.
[38:32] hebrews 10
[38:34] 19
[38:35] having therefore brethren boldness to
[38:37] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[38:39] jesus
[38:41] by a new and living way which he hath
[38:43] consecrated for us
[38:45] through the veil
[38:48] that is to say his flesh and having a
[38:50] high priest over the house of god let us
[38:53] draw near with a true heart in full
[38:55] assurance of faith having our hearts
[38:57] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[38:59] our bodies washed with pure water
[39:01] let us hold fast the profession of our
[39:03] faith without wavering for
[39:07] he is faithful but promised
[39:10] amen
[39:14] we look here and we see at the beginning
[39:16] of jesus's ministry
[39:18] and we talked about this in our last
[39:19] service when jesus goes into isaiah 61
[39:22] and he begins he visits the synagogue in
[39:24] his hometown of nazareth
[39:26] and he goes in there and they he picks
[39:28] up a piece of the scroll
[39:30] and they hand they where they hand him
[39:31] the scroll and he opens it up into
[39:33] messianic prophecy he begins to look at
[39:35] it and he begins to read there in the
[39:38] scripture and he begins to tell isaiah
[39:40] 61 who he is
[39:42] and he's beginning to proclaim that i am
[39:45] the one that one day is going to take
[39:47] away the spirit of despair
[39:51] and i'm the one who's going to give the
[39:53] garment of praise
[39:55] so jesus is here and he's reading that
[39:57] and he's telling the prophecy back in
[39:58] luke 4 now and he's proclaiming i'm the
[40:01] one you've been looking for
[40:03] i'm the one you've been waiting for i'm
[40:05] the one you've been longing for i am
[40:08] that very messiah
[40:10] that you've been talking about
[40:12] when he read those scrolls and he opened
[40:15] them up he didn't pull any punches
[40:17] he wasn't afraid to stand there and say
[40:19] this is me
[40:21] i'm telling you who i am i'm the one
[40:24] that can take away all the despair in
[40:26] your life and give you a garment of
[40:28] praise that you can have joy and peace
[40:31] and love
[40:36] in this synagogue here he's making a
[40:38] distinction between his first coming and
[40:40] his second coming and we look at that
[40:43] he's proclaiming the year of the lord's
[40:45] favor
[40:47] and but he's also
[40:49] saying that the day of vengeance of our
[40:50] god is upon us
[40:56] now
[40:57] today
[40:59] we live in a place that we have a
[41:00] foretaste
[41:02] of what this garment of praise is all
[41:04] about
[41:05] we don't have to live under a fainted
[41:07] spirit we don't have to live under a
[41:09] dreary or a dreaded day that we live in
[41:12] even though the world around us is
[41:15] falling apart
[41:16] we don't have to live that way because
[41:18] he came into isaiah 61 and said this is
[41:20] who i am and i give myself to you
[41:24] the garment of praise
[41:26] isaiah is prophesying time and time
[41:30] again here that we have to have joy
[41:33] we can have joy
[41:35] we don't have to have sackcloths we
[41:37] don't have to be like mordecai we don't
[41:39] have to have ashes upon us because there
[41:42] was a work that was done on calvary
[41:47] i said there's a work that was done on
[41:48] calvary
[41:50] that we don't have to live under that
[41:52] kind of bondage anymore
[41:56] brothers and sisters god elohim the
[41:59] self-existing one
[42:02] when he was out there all alone and he
[42:05] wanted to be worshiped he wanted to be
[42:08] loved he wanted to be glorified and
[42:10] lifted up and praised because he was an
[42:13] object of worship
[42:15] and he began to create the angels the
[42:16] seraphims the cherubims
[42:19] and all these different ones that would
[42:20] just sit there and worshiping day after
[42:22] day after day but he needed more he
[42:24] wanted something flesh
[42:28] so he creates adam and eve
[42:31] and then we see it here that adam and
[42:32] eve
[42:34] we know there's something very wicked
[42:36] happened there in the garden
[42:38] we don't have to go into tell we know
[42:40] what it was
[42:41] but now there's this barrier that comes
[42:44] up between
[42:45] god and those he created to worship him
[42:48] the very ones that should be given and
[42:50] love and the other brother brown said he
[42:52] would come down in the cool of the
[42:53] evening and they would have fellowship
[42:56] what what a wonder what a wonderful way
[42:59] to worship god
[43:01] it's just a fellowship with him
[43:05] and here they would come down there in
[43:06] the in the cool of the day
[43:08] but now there was a barrier between them
[43:14] but you know god couldn't settle for
[43:16] that
[43:18] god couldn't settle for that he said you
[43:19] know what i'm gonna have to come and
[43:21] make an atonement for that sin
[43:23] i'm gonna have to come down and i'm
[43:24] gonna have to find a way to restore this
[43:27] fellowship between me and my people
[43:31] that's you and i
[43:34] and he said i'm going to have to come
[43:35] down here and he longs to turn the faith
[43:38] of people and fill us with joy
[43:43] brothers and sisters part of the
[43:44] fulfillment of jesus's ministry was the
[43:46] pouring out of himself
[43:49] the holy spirit
[43:51] and filling his followers or his
[43:53] disciples with it
[43:55] that was one of the main fulfillments in
[43:56] jesus's ministry he wants us to be so
[43:59] like him
[44:00] he wants us to be so full of the holy
[44:02] spirit that we cannot help but praise
[44:04] him we cannot help but to lift him up we
[44:07] cannot help but to love him we cannot
[44:09] help but to exalt him and magnify his
[44:12] name
[44:14] and when we fall short of that
[44:17] god's not happy
[44:19] many times we're the ones that put up
[44:20] the barrier between us and god
[44:23] we put up the barriers between us and
[44:25] god and the things we listen to
[44:28] and the things we see
[44:30] and the things we do
[44:32] we put the barrier up because god came
[44:35] to take it down
[44:37] he wants that fellowship
[44:40] so the believers today
[44:42] who know the joy of the lord who know
[44:45] salvation who know forgiveness who's
[44:48] been filled with the holy ghost
[44:50] those people have and should be wearing
[44:53] the garment of praise
[44:56] stay with me now
[45:00] and those people are always seeking ways
[45:04] to honor god
[45:06] they're always seeking ways to please
[45:09] god
[45:10] to honor god
[45:12] they're busy serving others
[45:15] you ever notice most christians have a
[45:16] servant's heart
[45:19] yeah
[45:21] what did he
[45:22] deserve
[45:25] so what's this what's his believers
[45:26] what's his followers going to do but
[45:28] serve
[45:31] they have a loving heart
[45:33] they're not always looking to pick and
[45:35] criticize and poke and have hatred
[45:37] towards others
[45:39] i can't find anywhere in the scripture
[45:40] where jesus done that towards any human
[45:42] being
[45:43] no
[45:44] he came to love and they find grace in
[45:47] each other
[45:50] they find grace and they're merciful
[45:54] and they're kind
[45:55] do you realize that jesus came to earth
[45:58] to live an example life before his
[46:00] disciples
[46:02] he come to live that life and so that
[46:04] when he died and he returned in spirit
[46:07] form and distributed himself amongst his
[46:10] people in the book of acts on the day of
[46:12] pentecost
[46:14] they would know exactly how to act
[46:20] everything he done was to set the stage
[46:23] for what we're to do
[46:26] think about this he want he knew he
[46:29] wanted him to know how to act
[46:31] we ought to know how to live by the life
[46:34] he lived
[46:35] we should know how to behave by the way
[46:37] he behaved
[46:40] yeah we should know how to conduct
[46:41] ourselves as christians because he
[46:43] conducted himself as a christian
[46:46] he was christ-like because he was christ
[46:50] because let me tell you
[46:53] i hope you're filled with the holy ghost
[46:57] but the holy ghost doesn't change
[47:03] you realize on the day of pentecost
[47:04] that's the same holy ghost that's here
[47:06] today
[47:07] [Applause]
[47:08] it didn't change
[47:11] it never has changed it never will
[47:12] change
[47:14] the spirit is still going to act
[47:16] like
[47:17] jesus
[47:20] but the problem is when we don't act
[47:22] like christians it's because we
[47:24] allow things into our lives
[47:28] we allow things into our lives
[47:33] and then our spirit begins to
[47:36] change you know there's a there's
[47:38] there's days you walk and you feel like
[47:41] you're just walking so close to god that
[47:43] you could just put your arm around him
[47:48] but then you know he says you start
[47:49] doing things
[47:51] you let the bars down
[47:54] and you begin to compromise
[47:57] now this is not me this is him
[48:00] and you begin to get little clicks
[48:02] amongst you
[48:04] and you know pastor so-and-so and deacon
[48:06] so and so and before you know you've
[48:08] listened to this and that and that's the
[48:10] reason we've got trouble
[48:12] is we listen to the devil
[48:16] we listen to the devil and he said you
[48:19] begin to listen to him and you get a
[48:20] snarl
[48:23] instead of listening to that gentle dove
[48:26] that holy spirit
[48:29] you begin to snarl
[48:31] instead of listening to that dub that
[48:33] would lead you and guide you and love
[48:35] you and bless you why do we do that
[48:39] why do we do that why do we allow
[48:42] ourselves to fall into the trap to where
[48:44] we begin to listen to things we begin to
[48:46] gossip about things we begin to look at
[48:49] things we begin to hear things we begin
[48:52] to act different than what christians
[48:53] act why do we do that because he says
[48:56] what it does next thing you know you
[48:57] have those little temper spasms
[49:03] and then he says you know that little
[49:05] dove just flies right away
[49:09] she can't stand it
[49:12] that dove can't stand it her nature's
[49:14] different she can't stand it at all
[49:16] you go to talking about your neighbor
[49:19] she can't stand it she won't put up with
[49:21] it
[49:22] she takes flight and goes away
[49:25] he just can't stand it any longer the
[49:27] dove is gentle the dove is meek
[49:30] and it can't stand anything except it's
[49:33] got the same kind of nature
[49:37] so well
[49:39] where do we have to find our nature
[49:40] today
[49:44] where do we have to find our nature
[49:45] today we have to find our nature in that
[49:48] heavenly that doves nature that heavenly
[49:50] nature
[49:52] because if we find ourselves under any
[49:53] other nature we begin to snarl
[50:00] what causes the snarl
[50:03] pressure
[50:06] yeah
[50:07] most people are just fine until pressure
[50:10] comes and they begin to feel the squeeze
[50:14] maybe it's a job maybe it's a boss maybe
[50:16] it's it's a just
[50:18] financial maybe it's the home
[50:21] maybe it's your children
[50:23] but you feel that pressure come on and
[50:25] next thing you know
[50:29] [Music]
[50:33] it's such a fine line
[50:34] it's such a fine line
[50:39] that's why the garment of praise is so
[50:42] important
[50:44] that's why the garment of praise is so
[50:46] important because people who wear the
[50:48] garment of praise they're always
[50:50] praising the lord for what he's doing in
[50:51] their life
[50:56] no matter
[50:58] what they're going through
[51:01] i had somebody tell me
[51:03] i can remember where i was i was in
[51:06] florida and i gave a little a little
[51:08] testimony a little exhortation to the
[51:11] young people at last last year in
[51:13] florida for our baseball team and i'm
[51:15] talking about some hardships and i was
[51:17] talking about how you still praise god
[51:19] and you're going through things but you
[51:20] still praise god and they said are you
[51:22] one of those that's always praising god
[51:23] no matter what's happening
[51:25] yeah
[51:26] yeah
[51:27] yeah
[51:29] is it easy no
[51:32] no there's nothing easy about when
[51:33] you're going through the hardest trials
[51:35] of your life to say god thank you i love
[51:37] you i know i need this
[51:40] that's not easy but when you wear that
[51:42] garment or praise no matter what your
[51:44] hearts love to sing your hearts love to
[51:47] make music to the lord your hearts
[51:50] you face the challenges with
[51:52] expectations of provision like we talked
[51:54] about knowing that no matter what you're
[51:56] going through god is going to provide
[51:58] some way somehow
[52:01] over the mountain under the mountain
[52:03] around the mountain through the river it
[52:05] doesn't matter god's going to get you
[52:07] there
[52:13] people wearing the garment of praise
[52:14] they enjoy worshiping with other
[52:16] christians
[52:22] these home believers
[52:25] almost said homeschoolers i'm sorry
[52:29] these home believers
[52:34] i'm just going to say it that are
[52:35] pushing play and never going anywhere
[52:39] i i can't understand that
[52:41] there has to be a fellowship to take
[52:43] place
[52:44] and if you love god if you're a
[52:46] christian and you're wearing the garment
[52:47] of praise you love to fellowship and you
[52:50] love to worship in the house of god and
[52:53] the passion that's within you calls you
[52:56] and makes you grown to come to the house
[52:58] of god
[53:00] amen
[53:02] i have to be honest to say i felt
[53:03] horrible last wednesday because when i
[53:05] seen what the weather had done i thought
[53:07] man we could have been there
[53:13] and i had that in my heart just thinking
[53:15] did we make the right decision
[53:22] but you know those saying you can't turn
[53:23] back time
[53:25] but my point is there should be a
[53:27] longing
[53:29] to be here to hear what god has placed
[53:32] on his anointed
[53:35] the pastor of the church
[53:37] who's been inspired and led by god to
[53:39] make sure that you get there
[53:43] god puts these people in place to make
[53:45] sure that we have a road and a path and
[53:47] that we don't waver and deviate off of
[53:49] that road
[53:55] the believer with a garment of praise
[53:59] they want every moment on this earth to
[54:01] account for eternity
[54:05] because they've
[54:06] discovered a joy in walking hand in hand
[54:11] like i said when we started
[54:13] i don't know what i would do if i didn't
[54:15] just believe in god
[54:18] [Music]
[54:20] my whole life revolved around what i've
[54:22] been taught what i believe and what i
[54:24] trust that god is going to do in my life
[54:28] my very thoughts my actions the way i
[54:30] treat people if i didn't have this i
[54:32] would be a mean mean person
[54:36] i know
[54:37] my old nature
[54:39] i know how mean i would be without god
[54:48] i'm gonna give you a little conf i don't
[54:50] know if i should do this
[54:52] i'll give you a little confession
[54:55] i've always said if i wasn't a christian
[54:59] i think it'd be neat to be one of these
[55:01] heist people that goes in and hides
[55:03] stuff
[55:07] i'm talking mission impossible kind of
[55:09] stuff
[55:14] you know how thoughts go through your
[55:15] mind sometimes
[55:18] i thought man to go in and steal the
[55:19] greatest piece of art off of a wall and
[55:21] walk out and nobody can find you or see
[55:23] you and know it
[55:27] but thank god
[55:30] something got a hold to me at a young
[55:32] age
[55:33] thank god that the holy ghost come down
[55:36] and spoke into my life or i would
[55:38] probably be living some kind of life of
[55:40] crime or hatred or murder
[55:43] or gangster dramatic drug dealer
[55:52] but all of this is only possible
[55:55] through the death burial and
[55:56] resurrection of jesus christ
[55:59] when you look at isaiah 61 and you read
[56:02] what jesus was saying to the people
[56:05] when he stood there and he said i
[56:07] preached good tidings to the poor
[56:10] jesus was announcing that i'm here to
[56:12] heal the damage
[56:14] that sin brings
[56:17] because sin brings damage in all of our
[56:20] lives
[56:22] if you've lived a sinful life there's a
[56:24] lot of damage there's a lot of scars
[56:26] there's a lot of cuts there's a lot of
[56:28] hurts but he says i've come with a work
[56:31] of redemption
[56:32] to bring good tidings to the poor
[56:37] he says i've come because sin
[56:39] impoverishes
[56:42] you know sin just pulls it out of you
[56:48] sin just depletes you of a human to be a
[56:51] human being you are
[56:52] you've all seen the pictures of people
[56:54] that are drug addicts at 20 they look
[56:56] like they're 40 50 60.
[57:00] beautiful was once a beautiful young
[57:02] woman or beautiful or a handsome
[57:04] handsome young man
[57:06] and they get on get on drugs they begin
[57:07] to sin they begin to drink they begin to
[57:09] do meth and and all these different uh
[57:12] abuse abusive things
[57:14] their bodies begin to wrinkle
[57:17] their hair falls out their teeth falls
[57:19] out
[57:21] they become a skeleton
[57:24] and death has taken over
[57:30] but jesus says i'll heal the
[57:32] brokenhearted
[57:36] aren't you thankful that if you was once
[57:38] that person or if you know a person that
[57:39] is that person
[57:41] that jesus says i can come
[57:43] and i can take away your sin i can heal
[57:46] your body i can take away those dirty
[57:49] filthy desires
[57:52] i'm here to heal the brokenhearted i'm
[57:54] here to set the captives free because
[57:56] sin makes us captive
[58:02] if you don't think so
[58:03] you're deceived
[58:06] because once you find yourself dabbling
[58:08] into a world of sin
[58:10] every day that you dabble and dabble and
[58:13] dabble
[58:14] it's that many more days harder to get
[58:16] away to get away to get away
[58:25] he says i've come to proclaim liberty to
[58:27] the captives and to open the prison to
[58:29] those that are bound
[58:31] and to proclaim the acceptable year of
[58:34] the lord and if you look in your bible
[58:37] there in isaiah 61 where he's reading
[58:38] that there's a comma place there
[58:41] and that's an important comma
[58:44] because he's saying i'm doing this now
[58:46] while i'm here
[58:49] and then he pauses
[58:52] and he's pausing and looking out amongst
[58:54] these people these sadducees and
[58:55] pharisees and as he's reading in this
[58:57] temple and he pauses right there
[59:01] before he says and to proclaim the day
[59:04] of vengeance of our god
[59:06] what does that pause for
[59:09] it's to tell us that even though he came
[59:12] and he was there their very presence
[59:15] comma
[59:16] there is a day of vengeance
[59:20] and that is going to be the second
[59:21] coming of the lord and that's when you
[59:22] can have the full fulfillment of
[59:24] everything that i've ever ever promised
[59:26] you
[59:29] did you realize that that oh that comma
[59:33] in the year of the lord and the before
[59:35] the day of the vengeance stood for over
[59:36] 2 000 years
[59:38] and it's still standing there today
[59:41] someday that comma is going to be erased
[59:44] let me tell you brothers and sisters
[59:45] someday the biblical prophecy tells us
[59:47] there's coming a day when we're going to
[59:49] shift gears
[59:51] there's going to be a change in speed
[59:52] i'm going to speed up this world's going
[59:54] to slow down
[59:58] and in a minute an instant
[1:00:00] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:00:02] there's going to be a transformation to
[1:00:03] take place
[1:00:05] and they were going to be right there at
[1:00:06] that land beyond the river
[1:00:14] it's just waiting there
[1:00:17] it's just sitting there waiting
[1:00:20] can you imagine that
[1:00:22] everything you've dreamed of everything
[1:00:25] you've hoped of
[1:00:26] it's not often some dream
[1:00:28] or some fairy tale
[1:00:30] it is in reality right now
[1:00:33] sitting there waiting for us to step
[1:00:34] from this dimension into that dimension
[1:00:44] he has sent me
[1:00:46] because sin brings grief and i will
[1:00:48] comfort those who mourn
[1:00:51] and i will give you instead of ashes of
[1:00:53] mourning i'm going to give you people
[1:00:55] beauty
[1:00:56] instead of mourning itself i'm going to
[1:00:58] give you the oil of joy and instead of
[1:01:00] the spirit of heaviness i'm going to
[1:01:02] give you the garment of praise
[1:01:04] so why if he said he was going to do
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] why do we find ourselves set so many
[1:01:09] times covered in ashes
[1:01:12] why do we find ourselves so many times
[1:01:14] with a sac claw phone
[1:01:22] when jesus is alive
[1:01:26] you know we just went through easter
[1:01:29] they didn't find him
[1:01:32] the tomb was empty
[1:01:34] he came and he broke bread
[1:01:36] and expose the wounds in his hands
[1:01:40] and they said oh he's alive
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:45] vanished
[1:01:46] he's alive today
[1:01:49] are you hearing me
[1:01:52] there is no reason for any of us sitting
[1:01:55] here to be sitting in any kind of ashes
[1:01:57] any kind of mourning any kind of
[1:01:58] sackcloth
[1:02:00] because there's so much that god has in
[1:02:02] store for us
[1:02:03] don't let this become common to you
[1:02:06] don't let this don't let this church
[1:02:09] service don't let your pastor don't let
[1:02:11] your brothers and sisters don't let god
[1:02:13] become common to us we need each other
[1:02:16] we need our pastor we need the church we
[1:02:18] need the message we need god more than
[1:02:20] we've ever had him before
[1:02:30] the word beauty when you look there it
[1:02:31] talks is talking about a beautiful crown
[1:02:33] or a headdress
[1:02:36] you're going to take off those ashes and
[1:02:37] they're going to give you a crown
[1:02:40] upon your head
[1:02:44] that they may be called the trees of
[1:02:47] righteousness
[1:02:49] oh i like this one
[1:02:51] because these trees of righteousness
[1:02:53] when we look at street trees what do we
[1:02:55] think
[1:02:56] we think of strength we think of strong
[1:02:58] beautiful standing trees that stand
[1:03:01] there strong and beautiful righteousness
[1:03:03] is what he's saying and when we look at
[1:03:05] these trees we can see that these people
[1:03:07] are planted by god
[1:03:10] and brothers and sisters as the song
[1:03:12] says like a tree planted by the water
[1:03:14] brothers and sisters there's a tree that
[1:03:16] is planted by the water
[1:03:18] and it is planted by the feeding off the
[1:03:21] river of life that's a special kind of
[1:03:23] tree
[1:03:25] that tree that's planted by the water it
[1:03:27] has root run deep it has roots that run
[1:03:31] really really deep
[1:03:33] and let me tell you that tree won't be
[1:03:35] shaken
[1:03:37] that tree that's planted by the river
[1:03:39] and drinking water from the life from
[1:03:42] the river of life every wind of false
[1:03:44] doctrine that tree won't be shaken
[1:03:47] every six it comes its way that tree
[1:03:50] won't be shaken
[1:03:52] every hardship that comes that way that
[1:03:54] tree won't be shaken show me a christian
[1:03:57] that is planted by the river and feeding
[1:03:59] off the water the living water of life
[1:04:01] and i'll show you a christian that
[1:04:03] cannot fall
[1:04:05] i didn't say you wouldn't fail
[1:04:07] i said you won't fall
[1:04:15] let's get to this veil
[1:04:18] exodus 26 it says and thou shall make a
[1:04:21] veil of blue and purple and scarlet
[1:04:23] entwined
[1:04:24] linen of cunning work with cherubim
[1:04:26] shall it be made
[1:04:29] i want to break down kind of what we're
[1:04:30] looking at when we look at this veil
[1:04:32] give me just a
[1:04:36] few minutes here to
[1:04:37] to break this down
[1:04:39] we're looking at the colors here we look
[1:04:41] at blue
[1:04:42] the color blue is a primary color we
[1:04:45] know in it found in the rainbow we can
[1:04:47] find the color blue it's a primary color
[1:04:50] and so when we look at blue blue
[1:04:52] signifies the healing power of god
[1:04:57] blue signifies
[1:05:00] the sky
[1:05:02] blue signifies that everywhere you look
[1:05:05] when you step out of your house in the
[1:05:06] morning and you see the blue skies and
[1:05:08] you're looking around saying my goodness
[1:05:10] that's beautiful
[1:05:12] you're seeing god
[1:05:16] blue signifies healing
[1:05:19] there was a woman in the bible that had
[1:05:21] a blood issue for 12 years
[1:05:23] and you know what she said if i could
[1:05:25] just touch the hem of his garment
[1:05:28] do you know what color the hem of his
[1:05:29] garment was
[1:05:31] take a guess
[1:05:33] blue
[1:05:34] if i could just touch the hem of his
[1:05:36] garment i know i'll be made whole so
[1:05:39] blue signifies healing and god all
[1:05:42] around us
[1:05:44] we look at red also a primary color
[1:05:47] the color of red signifies blood
[1:05:51] the color blep of red also signifies
[1:05:54] earth
[1:05:57] so when we talk about adam we talk about
[1:05:59] earth we talk about blood we talk about
[1:06:02] red
[1:06:04] the decorations of this tabernacle had
[1:06:06] all the symbolism in it and it's telling
[1:06:09] us that adam who's created from the dust
[1:06:11] of the earth
[1:06:14] with sin in his life
[1:06:20] or it's susceptible to sin
[1:06:24] but through the lord's holy power can be
[1:06:26] made pure
[1:06:29] so you got blue which is healing and god
[1:06:32] and red which is
[1:06:34] earth
[1:06:35] and blood
[1:06:37] and sin
[1:06:39] and the two come together
[1:06:41] what do you get when you mix blue and
[1:06:42] red
[1:06:45] purple
[1:06:46] you get royalty
[1:06:48] purple means royalty purple is not a
[1:06:51] primary color
[1:06:52] purple is a secondary color so you take
[1:06:55] you got to take sin that's filthy and
[1:06:57] nasty and dirty and you got to go over
[1:06:59] here to god where it's blue and there's
[1:07:01] healing and there's there's strength
[1:07:03] right there in god and you bring the two
[1:07:05] together and you find yourself a royal
[1:07:07] priesthood
[1:07:10] that's not too deep for you is it
[1:07:14] and here you see
[1:07:17] living in this
[1:07:19] royal priesthood
[1:07:21] as you walk into this tabernacle
[1:07:25] where this veil hangs is the barrier
[1:07:28] between man
[1:07:30] and god
[1:07:32] the holies of holies
[1:07:34] here hangs this linen
[1:07:37] veil of red blue
[1:07:40] purple
[1:07:41] and cherubims
[1:07:45] you know why it's hanging there
[1:07:48] it's hanging there to protect the people
[1:07:50] from god
[1:07:52] it wasn't hanging there to protect god
[1:07:54] from the people
[1:07:57] let that sink in for a minute
[1:07:59] it was there to protect the people
[1:08:02] that were filthy and dirty
[1:08:04] and unclean
[1:08:06] from coming into the presence of the
[1:08:08] holies of holies
[1:08:12] because inside that holies of holies is
[1:08:14] where the ark of the covenant was it's
[1:08:15] where the mercy seat was it's where the
[1:08:17] shekinah glory was
[1:08:22] and this was a sight to behold
[1:08:27] think about it
[1:08:29] what will it be
[1:08:30] when jesus comes back
[1:08:33] think about that second coming what
[1:08:35] would it be when jesus comes in all of
[1:08:37] his glory and we the church the bride of
[1:08:39] jesus christ we're going to welcome his
[1:08:41] appearing right
[1:08:43] and we're going to be singing praise and
[1:08:44] glory and we'll fall to our knees who
[1:08:46] knows what we'll do
[1:08:49] i can only imagine the song says
[1:08:51] what will we do when we see him come and
[1:08:53] what will we do
[1:08:55] but you know there's going to be another
[1:08:57] group of people that won't be looked at
[1:08:59] looking at him that way there's going to
[1:09:01] be a multitudes of people that's
[1:09:03] rejected him
[1:09:04] there's going to be a multitudes of
[1:09:06] people that don't even want to see his
[1:09:08] face and they're going to cry for the
[1:09:10] mountains and the rock to fall upon them
[1:09:13] but you know what it says it says that
[1:09:14] they'll be forced to stand there and
[1:09:17] behold his face
[1:09:19] as a righteous judge
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:28] so inside this tabernacle
[1:09:31] inside this tabernacle this veil with
[1:09:33] blue and scarlet and purple
[1:09:36] hanging there embroidered with the
[1:09:37] cherubs hanging there
[1:09:40] gazing over every move these priests
[1:09:42] made
[1:09:48] can you imagine what a heavenly sight
[1:09:49] that was
[1:09:52] as you enter into the temple
[1:09:55] and you walk through the
[1:09:56] holy chamber
[1:09:58] then you go in and if you're the priest
[1:10:00] you're able to go into the holies of
[1:10:01] holies
[1:10:03] and when you walk in it must have been a
[1:10:04] heavenly sight
[1:10:06] to look see the blue all everywhere the
[1:10:10] sky and you feel god's presence all
[1:10:12] around
[1:10:13] and you see the the red and and the
[1:10:16] purple the royalty and you see the
[1:10:18] cherubims that are that are embroidered
[1:10:20] on the inside of the tabernacle on the
[1:10:23] inside of the tapestry
[1:10:25] and they're just gazing over everything
[1:10:27] that's going in it kind of reminds me of
[1:10:29] exactly what it would be like if i was
[1:10:31] standing in the presence of god in
[1:10:33] heavenly places
[1:10:35] and the cherubims and the angels and the
[1:10:37] seraphims all around
[1:10:41] and here this
[1:10:43] tabernacle hangs
[1:10:46] with these cherubs
[1:10:47] the same creatures
[1:10:49] that were placed at the entrance of the
[1:10:51] guard eden when adam and eve fell
[1:10:54] when they were driven out to protect the
[1:10:56] tree of life these same images these
[1:10:58] same cherubims are woven into the
[1:11:00] tapestry on the inside
[1:11:02] as to say you have now entered into
[1:11:04] heavenly places and you're in god's mist
[1:11:14] and this veil
[1:11:17] that hung so
[1:11:19] majestically
[1:11:23] was ripped from top to bottom at the
[1:11:25] death of jesus on the cross
[1:11:30] before that mankind had no access
[1:11:34] to god's presence
[1:11:38] adam and eve had no direct path anymore
[1:11:42] between them and god
[1:11:46] we had no direct path
[1:11:49] to get to god
[1:11:53] but in his death jesus brought forth the
[1:11:55] resurrection
[1:11:58] and all those believing in him the son
[1:12:00] of god and that he could take away the
[1:12:02] sin of the world
[1:12:04] now they are created an open door
[1:12:10] think about this an open door into the
[1:12:12] very presence of god an open door that
[1:12:15] we could go to him at will
[1:12:18] and we don't have to depend upon
[1:12:21] a man
[1:12:23] we don't have to depend upon
[1:12:25] a doctrine we don't have to depend upon
[1:12:27] a creed we don't have to get anybody's
[1:12:29] permission
[1:12:31] can you imagine if we had to go to our
[1:12:33] pastor say pastor do you think i'd talk
[1:12:36] to god today
[1:12:37] you think it would be okay if i talk to
[1:12:39] god today
[1:12:40] no
[1:12:43] we don't have to live that way there was
[1:12:45] a direct door that was now opened up
[1:12:47] between man and between god and matthew
[1:12:50] mark and luke all recount that when
[1:12:52] jesus when he cried out with the
[1:12:54] loud voice yielded up the ghost and the
[1:12:56] veil was rent from top to bottom
[1:13:00] and the earth began to quake and the
[1:13:01] rocks ran the graves were opened
[1:13:05] and the prophet said abraham and sarah
[1:13:07] went walking through the streets look
[1:13:09] here i remember them do you do you know
[1:13:11] do you know them do you know you
[1:13:13] remember this yeah i remember it
[1:13:15] this is reality this is what really
[1:13:17] happened and but then they were
[1:13:19] recognized and they vanished
[1:13:22] jesus is death now watch this and follow
[1:13:25] the tearing of the veil took place in
[1:13:27] the ninth hour about three o'clock in
[1:13:29] the afternoon
[1:13:30] you know what's significant about that
[1:13:32] because that was the time of the evening
[1:13:34] when sacrifices were happening
[1:13:37] so there was hundreds of people if not
[1:13:39] thousands of people gathered around the
[1:13:42] tabernacle around the temple
[1:13:44] and they were there to give their
[1:13:46] evening sacrifice i just wonder what
[1:13:49] they thought when this miraculous event
[1:13:51] happened
[1:13:53] when this veil was rent in two
[1:13:57] i wonder what they thought
[1:13:59] i wonder what the priests who were
[1:14:00] serving in the temple must have thought
[1:14:02] when they watched an unseen hand ripped
[1:14:04] this veil in who
[1:14:08] and exposed god
[1:14:10] to the entire
[1:14:12] world
[1:14:15] do you realize that's what happened
[1:14:19] something that was so much so hidden
[1:14:22] so secretive that only a priest could
[1:14:24] get in there once a year for a few
[1:14:27] minutes at a time
[1:14:29] dressed in holy garment through a holy
[1:14:31] ceremony through a holy sacrifice that
[1:14:33] they had to make
[1:14:35] now this whole thing this whole god that
[1:14:38] we've been hidden been hiding away so
[1:14:40] long that we can't get in touch with
[1:14:42] now he's exposed himself to the entire
[1:14:45] world
[1:14:50] and let me just tell you how much god
[1:14:51] loves you
[1:14:54] talking about this veil when jesus died
[1:14:57] and that veil and that temple was there
[1:15:01] this was 60 foot high
[1:15:05] 30 foot
[1:15:07] wide
[1:15:08] four inches thick
[1:15:12] yeah of hides badger skins
[1:15:16] fine linens overlaid four inches thick
[1:15:20] josephus said that 300 priests were
[1:15:23] required to move it
[1:15:26] and he said two teams of oxen
[1:15:29] could not have torn it in half
[1:15:33] that's how much god loves you
[1:15:36] that he reached down from the portals of
[1:15:38] glory
[1:15:39] and grabbed a hold of this side
[1:15:41] and this side and shred it like a piece
[1:15:44] of paper
[1:15:45] and said here i am for you
[1:15:48] here i am
[1:15:50] for you
[1:15:55] tearing that veil was removing a barrier
[1:15:59] into the presence of god
[1:16:01] as believers
[1:16:03] as believers we have truly a high and
[1:16:05] wonderful privilege to know that
[1:16:07] christians can only enjoy this
[1:16:11] you know i said wouldn't it be just
[1:16:12] wonderful if the whole world lived a
[1:16:14] christian life
[1:16:17] if that was a case we wouldn't have a
[1:16:18] need for this
[1:16:21] but it's a privilege that only
[1:16:22] christians can enjoy but because before
[1:16:24] that entering into god's presence
[1:16:26] you had to show full obedience
[1:16:32] i don't know about you
[1:16:35] but i'm not always fully obedient
[1:16:39] um
[1:16:40] i can admit that
[1:16:43] i have to probably say i've been a
[1:16:45] little bit fearful
[1:16:50] to peek into that
[1:16:52] holies of holies
[1:16:55] you know there was a time when there was
[1:16:57] two i think it was two of aaron's sons
[1:17:00] they said we're going to go into the
[1:17:01] holies of holies and we're going to
[1:17:02] create a fire like nobody's ever seen
[1:17:06] they didn't do it the way god said do it
[1:17:11] they found themselves burnt to ashes
[1:17:13] pretty much
[1:17:16] yeah
[1:17:17] how would you like to have been the ones
[1:17:18] that uh they called down and said hey we
[1:17:21] need you to go in there and get those
[1:17:22] two guys out
[1:17:25] my brother jeff said nope
[1:17:29] not me
[1:17:31] this was how serious it was
[1:17:37] i couldn't step into that veil
[1:17:41] but yet my heart longs to live behind
[1:17:43] the veil
[1:17:46] it's amazing to think that the
[1:17:50] pharisees and sadducees
[1:17:52] were standing there that day when the
[1:17:54] veil was rent and it was torn from top
[1:17:56] to bottom
[1:17:58] and they're standing there in the temple
[1:18:00] trying to go into the holies of holies
[1:18:02] and they had the holies of holies right
[1:18:04] before them
[1:18:08] you see how people can get so much
[1:18:10] misunderstood of where they're at
[1:18:15] there was a
[1:18:16] 1896
[1:18:19] juts judson van
[1:18:22] deventer
[1:18:25] i read a story in the the author of this
[1:18:27] little story said he put a veil up in
[1:18:29] his life
[1:18:31] and he
[1:18:32] he then got cold in spirit
[1:18:35] he done got cold and spirit and he was
[1:18:37] singing in the choir during a revival
[1:18:40] did you hear what i said he was cold in
[1:18:42] spirit singing in revival
[1:18:46] and he heard god calling him and calling
[1:18:49] him back and so he responded and he went
[1:18:52] to the old-fashioned altar and said he
[1:18:53] committed his life new to the lord and
[1:18:56] he forsook everything
[1:18:58] got got on fire for god again become an
[1:19:00] evangelist began ministering in america
[1:19:03] and england and scotland
[1:19:05] and he wrote a
[1:19:06] song and says all to jesus i surrender
[1:19:13] all to him i freely give
[1:19:16] and that's where we as believers
[1:19:19] if we're going to step into that holies
[1:19:20] of holies
[1:19:23] veil or no veil
[1:19:25] we have to find ourselves fully
[1:19:28] surrendered to god
[1:19:30] in his presence daily
[1:19:33] in his presence daily
[1:19:36] i surrender all
[1:19:39] that's the kind of commitment we have to
[1:19:41] make
[1:19:44] these high priests of israel
[1:19:48] they entered in behind they came into
[1:19:50] the very presence of god and
[1:19:52] looked into the light of god's glory
[1:19:55] and i can only imagine that they
[1:19:57] trembled in fear
[1:20:01] facing the shekinah glory
[1:20:03] trembling in fear
[1:20:06] sprinkle their little blood sacrifice
[1:20:09] two or three five minutes at the most
[1:20:12] get out of there
[1:20:14] not allowed to go back until the next
[1:20:16] year
[1:20:23] but when jesus came
[1:20:27] in flesh
[1:20:29] you know the bible tells us we read
[1:20:31] where it says when the veil was rent as
[1:20:33] his flesh
[1:20:36] his flesh that was torn as he went up on
[1:20:39] calvary
[1:20:42] he broke down all the barriers that
[1:20:44] stood between mankind and access to the
[1:20:47] father
[1:20:49] through the blood of jesus christ our
[1:20:51] great high priest there's a finished
[1:20:53] work
[1:20:54] that's been done
[1:20:56] once and for all
[1:21:01] what privileged people we are tonight
[1:21:05] we don't have a veil
[1:21:07] we don't have a veil that's blocking our
[1:21:09] entrance into the presence of god
[1:21:11] there's been a way made the door's open
[1:21:13] and we're even encouraged brothers and
[1:21:15] sisters to march right into the presence
[1:21:17] of almighty god he invites us to come to
[1:21:20] him
[1:21:22] there's an invitation that goes out to
[1:21:24] his people
[1:21:25] that whosoever will come to me
[1:21:29] come to me and i'll draw you come to me
[1:21:33] there's been a way that's been made for
[1:21:35] you and i
[1:21:36] and the prophet said that souls that
[1:21:38] were once condemned to death to die and
[1:21:40] go to a devil's grave the devil has now
[1:21:42] been conquered
[1:21:45] do you realize that though when the veil
[1:21:47] was rent
[1:21:49] brother baller quote that brother
[1:21:51] branham used and i love it when he says
[1:21:53] he went down there into the into the
[1:21:55] pits of hell and he talked to satan and
[1:21:57] said oh you finally arrived have you
[1:22:01] he said i thought i had you
[1:22:03] when i had the three hebrew children i
[1:22:06] thought i had you with daniel in the
[1:22:07] lion's den
[1:22:10] you know when that happened
[1:22:12] that all took place right after that
[1:22:14] veil was torn
[1:22:16] that's when he went down there and he
[1:22:17] began to battle for you and i and
[1:22:19] brother branham said when the when that
[1:22:21] veil was torn that's when he became the
[1:22:24] mighty conqueror
[1:22:26] that's when he became the mighty
[1:22:28] conqueror and he said the grave that has
[1:22:30] been conquered sickness has been
[1:22:32] conquered superstition has been
[1:22:35] conquered malice has been conquered
[1:22:37] hatred has been conquered indifference
[1:22:40] has been conquered starchiness has been
[1:22:42] conquered self-styles has been conquered
[1:22:45] everything has been conquered because
[1:22:47] christ is the conqueror
[1:22:52] he ripped that veil that hid god
[1:22:55] from man
[1:22:57] we don't have a mysterious god today
[1:23:01] we don't have to wonder what god is
[1:23:05] we don't have to wonder what his
[1:23:06] blessings are
[1:23:08] we don't have to wonder what salvation
[1:23:10] is
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:12] it's all been given right there for us
[1:23:14] he ripped that veil and now god dwells
[1:23:16] above among men he rent that veil that
[1:23:19] kept off god's healing
[1:23:25] do you see how important it is that we
[1:23:26] have a direct line
[1:23:28] because when that veil was up you
[1:23:30] couldn't have healing
[1:23:36] he ran that veil off
[1:23:38] that kept god's blessings from you
[1:23:42] when that veil was up
[1:23:45] you couldn't be blessed
[1:23:48] you can be healed you couldn't be
[1:23:49] blessed you couldn't have salvation
[1:23:52] he rent that veil that kept off god's
[1:23:55] peace
[1:23:57] man
[1:23:58] where would we be if we didn't feel
[1:24:00] god's peace
[1:24:06] now the veil has been ran into
[1:24:08] with his own blood he walked a conqueror
[1:24:11] the battle is over and he proved to us
[1:24:14] in his resurrection and now the holy
[1:24:16] ghost is a witness
[1:24:17] sent
[1:24:18] to goddess
[1:24:22] watch what he did and i'm closing
[1:24:26] watch what he did
[1:24:27] when he was on earth he conquered and
[1:24:29] possessed every gate the enemy had
[1:24:34] the royal seed he promised it by the
[1:24:37] word he conquered it he conquered the
[1:24:39] gate of sickness
[1:24:41] for us
[1:24:47] that's what he came to do remember sick
[1:24:50] people he conquered that gate you don't
[1:24:52] have to conquer it
[1:24:53] he conquered it
[1:24:58] the other man had to conquer their own
[1:24:59] gate but you don't have to conquer it's
[1:25:01] already conquered he conquered the gates
[1:25:03] of sickness
[1:25:05] he conquered the gate of temptation
[1:25:10] how did he do it
[1:25:12] by the word
[1:25:14] he conquered the gate of temptation
[1:25:17] and the keys was resist the enemy and
[1:25:20] he'll flee from you
[1:25:23] he conquered it all he conquered
[1:25:24] sickness he conquered death he conquered
[1:25:26] hell he conquered death and hell and the
[1:25:28] grave he conquered because thereof
[1:25:30] natural seed
[1:25:32] he conquered the gate of the grave and
[1:25:34] rose up on the third day for our
[1:25:37] justification
[1:25:40] and he says and now
[1:25:42] we are more than conquerors
[1:25:45] when that veil was ripped when that veil
[1:25:47] was torn he not only became the mighty
[1:25:50] conqueror but he says now you are more
[1:25:53] than conquerors
[1:26:01] we just need to walk into it
[1:26:06] and he says i wish i was twice my size
[1:26:09] maybe i would feel twice as good
[1:26:12] let's stand our feet
[1:26:29] one of the best things i think about the
[1:26:34] veil being rent
[1:26:37] was just the very fact that he fully
[1:26:39] identified himself
[1:26:42] who he was
[1:26:44] what he came to do
[1:26:46] what he came to give
[1:26:48] the blessings he gave for us
[1:26:51] none of us are worthy
[1:26:53] none of us are deserving
[1:26:57] but it was all because of a man named
[1:26:59] jesus
[1:27:03] let's just bow our heads
[1:27:05] heavenly father we're just so thankful
[1:27:07] for
[1:27:08] this day you've given us lord and
[1:27:10] thankful for a very attentive
[1:27:12] congregation that
[1:27:14] pulled on the gift tonight lord and
[1:27:17] just wanted to hear from you father and
[1:27:19] we're just thankful lord jesus that you
[1:27:21] spoken to us tonight
[1:27:23] lord
[1:27:25] thinking about this veil that was rent
[1:27:28] just knowing that that was for us we we
[1:27:30] talked so much about calvary
[1:27:33] and salvation and
[1:27:35] lord we're so
[1:27:37] dependent upon the calvary and
[1:27:40] salvation and
[1:27:42] and the blood that was shed
[1:27:44] but there's another side of that that
[1:27:45] that when that veil was torn
[1:27:48] that barrier
[1:27:50] that a sinner
[1:27:51] like myself
[1:27:54] could come into your presence
[1:27:56] and accept the salvation except the
[1:27:58] blood that was shed on calvary
[1:28:01] and knowing that on the third day you
[1:28:03] rose again and that you was alive and
[1:28:04] you became a conqueror
[1:28:08] to show us that we are more than
[1:28:10] conquerors
[1:28:12] we thank you for that lord lord if
[1:28:14] there's
[1:28:15] anybody in here tonight that
[1:28:18] maybe there's something sick
[1:28:21] that's weary
[1:28:23] that's
[1:28:24] maybe battling depression
[1:28:28] maybe they're fearful of an event that's
[1:28:30] up up and coming
[1:28:35] lord may you just
[1:28:36] send peace down into their heart tonight
[1:28:39] knowing lord
[1:28:41] that they can stand
[1:28:43] in the very presence
[1:28:45] of the almighty
[1:28:48] the almighty who heals us of all of our
[1:28:51] infirmities
[1:28:53] the almighty who provides
[1:28:55] all of our needs
[1:28:57] the jehovah jihad
[1:28:59] fits a provider for us all
[1:29:04] and may we stand there knowing
[1:29:07] as the song says we've been made more
[1:29:10] than conquerors
[1:29:12] through that blood
[1:29:14] and through that veil that was rent
[1:29:16] we just want to tell you how much we
[1:29:18] love you tonight lord
[1:29:19] we ask lord as we
[1:29:21] go our ways this week and prepare to
[1:29:24] come back on sunday
[1:29:27] that you would just constantly deal with
[1:29:30] our hearts prick our hearts show us
[1:29:32] where we're
[1:29:33] our failures our shortcomings
[1:29:36] so that lord we could find lord jesus
[1:29:39] that
[1:29:41] we can come to you father and know that
[1:29:44] we can be made whole
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:50] lord you're so good to us
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:54] and words can't express it
[1:30:00] we love you lord with all of our hearts
[1:30:02] in jesus name we pray
[1:30:05] amen
[1:30:06] let's just sing that little chorus that
[1:30:08] she's playing we've been made more than
[1:30:10] conquerors
