pr I appreciate that the lord loves it amen so let's let's just have church tonight let's do that amen let's pray One More Time Lord Jesus we're so thankful that you would come here with your presence and just bless us already father we're so grateful that we can gather together Lord on a night like this when around us the world is just waiting waiting into sin and darkness but there's a light shining here Lord and you called us to be part of that light so father I ask that after this service tonight Lord when we go from here our light shines a little brighter we have a greater understanding a little more wisdom a little more faith whatever it is that you have for us deliverance and healing and father each one of us needs something from you tonight we hold up all our special needs of our families our friends everything that we have need of and Lord you know there's a dog I was asked to pray for I'm asking to heal that dog right now Lord Jesus and just show that you care about even the little things come and meet our needs Lord Jesus I ask this in your name amen amen we're going to read a couple of places if you want to turn to Matthew uh we're going to start there with Matthew uh 26 and we'll read one verse there then I'm going to read out of um Hebrews 12 also then we'll be seated hope everyone's doing well amen it's good to see y'all got good good looking bunch of people here brother Thomas amen Matthew 26 and verse 39 this is Jesus in Gethsemane he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless NE as I will b as thou Wilt tonight I want to speak on the word think of on this word nevertheless if you want to turn to Hebrews 12 going to read verse two there it says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despite the shame sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God you may be seated tonight all right praise the Lord nevertheless Jesus was in Gethsemane am I okay up a little bit okay okay so Jesus in Gethsemane he did not want to go through what he had to go through he was begging he was praying he said oh don't let me have to go through this but then it come to the point when and he he you know he took him a while because he went and prayed he came back to the disciples and they were they were sleeping he went back and prayed pray came back to the disciples again the third time he finally got to the point he said okay I'm good now I'm ready to go but it took him a while cuz Jesus had to overcome himself there in Gethsemane and he got to the point he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done brother and sister that is what we must come to in our walk and then you see you say well why did he do that what was it what was the faith that kept him going we see it there in Hebrews 122 it says for the joy that was set before him that was why he had the faith to keep going because he knew that the the end result was going to be amazing all right but you had to go through the bitterness first so we want to turn over here to Revelation 10 we're going to read a little bit here in Revelations 10 and8 and it says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stand upon the sea and upon the earth now we know that this is a type of John the John is the type of the Bride at this point and it says right before that in the days has it's the message of the hour and we have heard that and as soon as we hear that then the voice says to you now you need to go take that open book and what are you supposed to do you're supposed to eat it this is something to be eaten this is what your soul lives on it's not something to be to be debated not something to argue about it's not a set of rules to follow so many times people man I like this up here so many times people they you know they think well the message just following all the rules and living a holy life and believeing all the right kind of doctrin brother and sister when you eat the book that book gets inside of you and it changes you and you become something that you were not before because you are what you eat and you can tell a person what they're feeding on by what comes out of their life and if you're feeding on the word the word comes out of your life if you're feeding on carrots carrots comes out of your life if you're feeding on the world the world comes out of your life but if you want to know whether or not you're feeding on Christ see what kind of life you're living and I'm not talking about whether or not you're living a holy life because that just comes with it but brother and sister The Life of Christ is the word for you for this day manifesting Christ through you and that's something that you might be the only person who's recognizing it but you see that there's something different about you and you keep growing little by little because it just you you know this I'm not but it says it says it's going to be honey in your mouth but afterwards it's going to make you bitter and that's exactly what we're doing when you come into it atmosphere like this this is honey Honey's just drooling all over the place this is a wonderful atmosphere it's just great you know and anyone wants to come to church when it's like this and everyone just worshiping and praising and God is so real his presence so real but as soon as you hit that door what does it say he said it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter right away you hit the door and right away there's and sometime it come from your brother and S sister going right sat knows how to use this to tr of drag each other down it's a sad thing but brother and sister we're getting know that too amen we're starting to learn that you know that person sitting right there is actually Christ and how I treat her is how I treat Christ think about that the next time you want to sass somebody you what happened to Sister me when she sass the prophet God didn't like it he said well we're not prophets you're still a part of the body of Christ how some respect for each other amen amen got off my subject all right so soon as you hit the door there's bitterness right this the loss everything we go through and why do we go through it be because we know that there's a joy set before us that if we take our cross daily and die to oursel daily there's a reward that's coming down the road if we will go through the bitterness now and so we have these wonderful times when you're just fellow shipping and sometime it's in your prayer closet whatever the situation is that you have this honey excuse me you you're enjoying this honey but you know that there's another trial coming there's another the valley right down the road and what happens is you go through life and some of us getting a little old and we recognize something that you go through a valley and then you come up and then you go through a valley and then you come up and your entire life walking with Christ is going to be just like that the whole way you're on a roller coaster and the key to we or not you are you are succeeding or passing your test is because your your emotions don't do this with it your emotions are right there and no matter what you're going through all that's coming out of your mouth is praise and worship you want to know if you're growing in Christ what's coming out of your mouth when you're going through the hard times are you whining and complaining are you saying saying you do what you can do but I'm still going on that's what it takes that's what it is it's that simple anytime tries to make Christianity so complicated it is the simplest Concept in the world you just believe what God says and if you believe what God says and you grow in that Grace and that Faith then after a while you notice that you are maturing that's an amazing thing to see when you see that maturity in you you're like oh my goodness I don't react the way I used to I don't do the things I used to Satan used to throw a Temptation at me I just head over heels there I go it's like oh my goodness what are we doing here and now he throws it and I can overcome it and then I go head over heels all right but for a while hang on get my head on but but you find out you calm down feel you recognize that you are getting a place where Satan can't just knock you around like he used to have you noticed that isn't that amazing brother brandom said you can live so so close to Christ that he can't find you what does that mean it's like this maybe maybe 20 years ago I said brother Thomas you know I those shoes man they're really ugly and he said well I don't like yours either yours are like Podunk shoes hurt his feelings right now I what happened to brother Thomas I can't find him anymore he go to he Satan goes to push buttons and the only thing he sees is Christ your family go to push your buttons cuz they know your weakness right and they're in the bad mood so I want to kind of sass this person to push that person's button and they don't get any reaction yeah there's no reaction why because that old man is dead I'm gonna I'm gonna make a really really gr kind of analogy right here but okay but like you're driving down the road and you're looking around enjoying it and all of a sudden there's a dead pum oh I just ran over that dead pum you know who doesn't care that got run over the posum he's already dead he couldn't care less you run over him 20 more times he's dead it's the same with us friends Satan pushes you and push you and push you all you get is a dead man what happened to brother Thomas oh he died ain't that amazing and when you see that in your brothers and sisters you talk about inspiring I say man I see I want that too I can have that too that's part of my that's that's my inheritance too I can be dead too you can choose this friends how do you you get there through the bidder y Something's Gonna offer you his religion and his religion he don't have bitter you can have what what you want Proverbs 5 talking about a horish woman but we're gonna you know the woman is a type of the church so when we talk about this don't think of a woman think of a church okay I me in fact I'm going to put Church in there first uh verse one Proverbs 51 my son attended to my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding that thou mayest regard discretion that thy lips may keep knowledge so he said what's coming out of your M it needs to be knowledged you need to make sure you're living correctly for the lips of a strange Church drops as in honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil what is this all about this is Satan's his Christianity his bride and you can find all kinds of churches and pastors and preachers and people and He will offer you a religion that you want that appeals to your nature appeals to your flesh your your emotion and I'm not talking about all the dozens of hundreds of churches around the world I'm talking about Methodist churches you can find this around the message you can find this in your Pew sitting next to you and I want a kind of religion I want to be a Christian according to my idea what a Christian should be and he offers it to you you can have any kind of Christianity you want it's smooth look look it's drops as honeycomb here we go back to Sweet again right and and it's her mouth is smoother than oil and you got someone who's going to scratch your ears and tell you what you want to hear because that way they'll keep you in the church and that way you're going to keep paying your time and you can sit there and be any kind of Christian you want to be and still be fine if you ever sit in a situation like that you need to get up and flee that's right if your pastor doesn't care enough to tell you the the truth and hurt your feelings once in a while he don't care about your soul he don't I have no problem with saying that because I know this gentleman here is going to hurt your feelings when it's needed some more you should have said Amen to that her mouth is smoother than oil but her end is bitter as warm word sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go down to Hell down to death her steps take hold on Hell lest thou should us Ponder the path of her life her ways are movable that thou cannot know them so what is it talking about you're building your house on on sinking sand on shifting sand and it's movable and you come in you go and say well I want to believe it this way and he said okay you can believe it that way well I think this is the way we should do yeah go ahead and do it any of your way because it's just going to just stroke your your feelings and what you want and you can be this wonderful great whoever it is that you think you want to be that's Satan's religion and it's sweet and is honey and you can have anything you want but remember at the end it's bitter so what you have you have a choice here you can either go through the bitter now and have eternal life or you can have the honey now and go to hell you you live now and die later or you die now or you live later that's it's that simple that's Christianity in a nutshell right there friends you die to yourself and you go through the hard times you go through the bitter and that's all about dying to self or you ignore that and you never say nevertheless you say no I'm not going to do this and you live the life you want to live now yeah that's right it's pretty cut and dry but that's what it comes down to friends and here's the really wonderful part once you are born again and you are born again that spirit inside you it won't let you escape the bitter you say you no boy come on back you're going through this trial you try and get up in the way snatch you he'll drag you right back said no you're not going anywhere well I don't want to go through this and until you get to the point where you say nevertheless amen nevertheless whatever you want I'm gonna read I'm gonna read last of scripture tonight if that's okay I'm GNA go to Hebrews 5 uh that's Romans where's Hebrews Hebrews 5 and 7 talking about Jesus again who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared so here he is he's got to go through this and he was heard in that he feared so in other words the father heard what he was saying but he didn't stop it right he didn't stop it from happening he could have stopped okay I understand something you don't want to go through that we'll find another way strong CRI Eyes and Tears and him that was able to save him from Death he was able to but he didn't yeah though he were a son yet learn he obedience by the things which he suffered brother and sister that is the whole thing how do we learn obedience how do we learn to believe by the things we suffer for friends the way the things that change us is suffering it is living a happy good good good you know having a good lucky life everything's going good we don't change what's the point in changing there's nothing to change it it's the trials is what changes it's the trials what mold our character it's the trials that get to us after a while we said I am sick of this trial I got to overcome this I'm tired of stumbling this I'm tired of this happening over here I'm tired of this this this uh my family all rough up about something I I'm tired of having these things going on in the church I need a change yeah that's what brings change friends is when you go through suffering that's what changed Jesus character it's going to be the same for us amen let's go to Hebrews 10 and we're going to start at verse 32 Hebrews 10:32 it says but called to remembrance the former days in which after you were eliminated you endured a great fight fight great fight of Affliction so after the honey and then you went right into the bitter you see what that is you illuminated you got the honey it was sweet you took the message and you realized you a child of God and it was so wonderful and right away you going into a fight of Affliction because your family started rejecting you your friends started rejecting you started having all kinds of problem you recognize there things in your life that need to be changed and it become one step out and you just right into the battle and you're just battling ever since partly while you were made a gazing stop both by reproaches and affliction partly while you became comp Companions and that were so used and so people are looking at you and say look what kind of church are you going to or some of you a lot of you were raised in the message and your friends around there they look at you the way they do and said well you're just an eyeball yep you are an eyeball you might as well just get used to it so not not try to be halfway in the world and halfway out and well I'm GNA be a friend with my friends here but I'm still G to be a Christian no it don't work that way you stand for what's right and they'll respect you whether they like you or not and who cares if they do anyways because they don't matter they don't matter people's opinions of you do not matter there's there's one to get to after a while that you do what you're supposed to do no matter what people think about you no matter what they say for you had compassion on me and my bonds took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourself that you have in heaven a better and enduring substance there it is that knowing that you you want to go through this bitter not because you know that you have something coming that doesn't even compare this this can't even hold a candle you go through let me just put this way once you get that new body everything you went through here in this life ain't going to matter and you're not going to care about it don't matter what you suffer everything it's all going to be have been worth it to get there can you imagine what that's going to be like that's right my cast not away there for your confidence which has great recompense of reward there's a great joy set before you for you have need patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise there's the prence there you walk through the values and you go through this life and you go through one thing after another but you know that if I will just keep going I would just keep believing there's a reward at the end that's going to be worth it all it is I promise you for yet a little while he that shall come will come will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him what does that mean is that I'm not willing to say nevertheless I'm not willing to say not my will but thine be done I don't like this I'm not going to accept it and I'm GNA pull back and I know the will War the will of the Lord is me for do this and go this and say this to this person and preach this or to do whatever it is he wants me to do but I just can't bring myself to do it and you draw back and you know you quit walking in faith because what you're saying is God I don't believe that what you're want me to do is going to make me happier than what Satan wants me to do I don't believe that that following your word and believing your word and going through this bitterness is really going to be what I want and I'm not going to do it I want my own way friend every one of us goes through that cuz Jesus himself did Jesus did not want to go through with that he had to pray repeatedly he had to spend hours in prayer to get his human part to the place where it would say nevertheless not my will think about it it's bitter friends there's a bitterness that goes to being a Christian and that has to do with you dying to yourself and your own your own ideas and everything you want but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul ain't that amazing oh my I'm gonna turn to Romans 5 I thought it was there it is Romans 5 And1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into his grace where when we we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God there it is we've rejoice in Hope of the glory of God we know that there's a something ahead there's a reward yes and because of that verse three says and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also now all of a sudden it didn't get so fun anymore wait a minute I want a joy and rejoice and hope of the glory but it says to glory and tribulation also friends this is a mature Christian this is what you come to if you're not there already you're going to get there so the sooner we get there the quicker we get out of here that's all right so let's just go ahead and say you know what I've been through this I've been through that I've seen God bring me through everything he brought me through I have another tribulation another trial right here well if he brought me all this way he didn't bring me here just to let me go he's gonna take me through this and I'm gonna look back at this and say praise God he took me through that and you hit another trial and you get through it you turn around and say praise God he took me through that and after a while when those Trials come you quit getting so discourage you say well he brought me this far he promised to take me the rest of the way and then you can glory in it because here's what happens every time you get through one of those trials you know what happens you're that much closer to Christ you're that much more Christlike and you recognize this is the best thing your trials are your best thing that you go through your trials are way more better for you than your honey it's true the honey is not molding character when I walked out of here in this atmosphere wonderful atmosphere it was not molding character it's needed we need to have it but if all we did was hang out in the honey we would be little kids with bottles in our mouths and if the honey ain't full one well I'm not going to go to church anymore I don't feel like it church is boring yeah churches go through these up and downs they have Revival times and they go through perod brother Bram said this and is you know you find out what what what was going on during the honey one people don't show up when the dry times come that hurts you find out who your real brother and sister is yes sir who you can count on James is telling us the same thing over here in James one it says my brother counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the Trin of Faith work is patience that's what it takes friends it's patience just keep walking keep going forward knowing that this this plan that God has for you is going to bring work in you a great joy a great reward if you go through the bitter now is coming which you can either you can either go through it now or you can have it later you can't have it both all right now that kind of my Foundation now we're going to start preaching so if you want to go to to Hebrews going to go to Hebrews 11 we all know this is a faith chapter right all these great Heroes of Faith one I mean 111 now Faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report and we can go down there and it talks about by faith Abel by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Moses by faith Noah all these great hero faith and look at them and say my goodness what amazing people you recognize you can stand shoulder toosh shoulder with them and they can say the same thing about you it's true yes when it's all said and done you had the exact same Faith they did that's right and you overcame in a lot of ways more than any of them overcame because you're fighting a harder battle than they fought ain't that weird you say well I never had to build an ark or I never had to almost kill my son or or something like that yeah but the things you're overcoming is just as greater greater that's right it's true let's go all to verse 32 what shall I say more all these amazing people right all this great faith for the time would fail me to tell Gideon and Barack and Samson and Jeff and David and Samuel of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax violent and fight turned to fight fight the armies of the enemy women receive their dead to life again oh my goodness look at all this stuff going on you notice what happened they went through a hard test they went to some bitterness and God came in did so great because they went through the battle first and they came out they kep believe in and so God could come down in that situation and bring him to life and and restore the dead and stop the armies and do that but you had to go through the battle first you had to have the faith to walk in there knowing God's going to take care of it when they went into the fiery furnace in down in Babylon they went in they said hey whether God's going to save us or not I don't know but I'm going to walk in faith because I'm not going to turn back on God the faith kept him going into it and God came on the scene came on the scene in in Daniels came on the scene with Joshua sto on the sun all these amazing things where there's a great battle and they stayed faithful so God came on the scene ain't that amazing how many times in your own life you could say you know what there's a great battle and I just kept believing I wouldn't get discouraged and God came on the scene and he healed me he set me free he did whatever it is he answered my prayer and I have the same testimony of these people did the dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection other had trial cruel mocking scourging bonds and imprisonment Stone and saw a thunder wait a minute what happened to the Deliverance yeah all these amazing people faith and then all a sudden they're being tortured to death they're being saw a center the being Stone why didn't Faith come and deliver them all of a sudden it gets a whole different story yeah pan delivers you oh no he doesn't you still un woken the bitter that's right because look at this other torture not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection they could have been delivered but it been Satan's Deliverance all they had to do was renounce their faith say okay okay I hate Jesus Christ I I don't know nothing I'm not a Christian anymore I give it up and they would have been set free he said well where's the faith it was a faith that kept them being tortured see brothers and sisters sometime it takes the same Faith to die for Christ as it does to live for him but are you willing to do that are you willing to go through are you willing to be mocked and scourged and all these things that go through being a Christian and he said well why don't God come and deliver me he delivered that person he delivered that person why don't he deliver me because maybe he chose you for something else this church you know you know he he uh he delivered Lazarus right look what he had to go through first Steven was stoned to death he could have delivered Stephen he could have said no stop those stones but he didn't see because brother and sister Faith is recognizing and accepting God's perfect will for your life no matter how makes you feel no matter what you want that's right when you're praying for for a revelation faith is a revelation when you're praying for for for Revelation what what God wants for your life are you willing to accept what he gives you look at all the people have been sick sick for years and someone else is healed and you're saying well why don't I get healing because brother and sister God chose that person to glorify him name his name by healing him he chose another person to glorify his name by being faithful during this to be faithful to be faithful while you're going through it we don't want that I want to be the first person my myself I want to be the one who's healed but God gets to choose see that's why you put yourself in neutral when you go to pray God I I have this the doctor says I'm sick you know whatever is going on I'm praying I'm looking I'm seeking Revelation what's God's perfect will for this so I know what to whatever he tells me I have faith to walk in that and he says fill your healed praise God healed 10 years later I still have the same thing what's going he can heal you right now he can make you wait a while and you know let me just put this out you know you know people who've been sick for a while even died from it and they stayed faithful have you ever seen a more inspiring life than someone who's faithful all the way to death brother brother Donnie's daughter the stories that come out of her of that situation oh no there wasn't that was the same faith that stopped the sun right but she was chosen for that and her life was chosen to be Inspirations for how many people were touched by it but that's not what we want wanted nobody expected her to die everyone say surely God's going to heal her there are so many how many thousands and thousands of prayers and how much Faith was put in there and that Faith was strong there's no lack of faith in that it was God's will can now the question is can you accept his will because that's what faith does not my will but thine be done that's what nevertheless is I don't want to go through this I don't want to suffer this way I don't want to see this in my family I don't want to see my kids running out to the world I don't want to see this happening here I don't know want all all this stuff that's going on and yet you know that this is what God has chosen for you to go through and you say nevertheless not my will but thine be done that's what mature Christian does he say I don't want this I want I want a different job I don't like how this is going on my wife left me my kids hate me whatever the situation is but this is what God has chosen for you to go through to mold your character and so you're going to say nevertheless whatever I had to go through because at the end I know it's all going to be just fine God's going to fix it it's not our job to tell how or when by faith Jesus said nevertheless because he had the joy that was set before my brother and sister we have that Joy set before us that nevertheless whatever we have to go through it's going to be just fine if you continue to walk in faith that's the key to it don't be that that that fall back oh my goodness I just can't take this any with is there too much I just I just don't think I can keep going I'm just not going to do this anymore that's why we see so many people leave they get discouraged but I don't want this I don't want this path I don't want to be sick I don't want to have this temptation I don't want to have this besetting sin there's a good one especially for young people besetting sins Paul said we have them you know besetting sin is is something you struggle with and you pray about it and you you give it to God and you you claim victory and you fall again and you get prayed for it again and you go and talk to your pastor whatever the situation is and you know and you're claiming Victory and you fall again and Satan's right there the whole time if you were born again if you were born again if you were born again and you know what people do they get discouraged I just can't do it I just can't live I like such a hypocrite I'm just going to stay home now you just play right into Satan's hand you know one of the biggest black gues you can give to Satan is when he knocks you down on Saturday and you go to church on Sunday and act like nothing happened it's [Applause] true it's true because he gonna sit there and say you hypocrite what if everybody knew what you did yesterday they'd forgive me amen they're Christians and if they don't they ain't my brother and sister anyways oh they're Pharisee they're looking down their nose because they think that their sins are not as bad as mine boy it's easy to be a Pharisee isn't it it's so easy you see oh look at that person man they don't hardly ever get to church for six months and you're worse off than he is because you think you've done something look look the word gets down close he wants to cut all that junk out of there he just wants just your heart not all your religion amen don't want this path I don't want to you're going to overcome that thing and you might have fell a thousand times but a thous thousand and one times you got back you but you just keep coming and you just keep going and you just keep claiming the truth and you go keep going and what's God doing he is he is molding your character till you have the strength to defeat that thing yeah because what it is is every time we fall I think I spoke on this before every time we fall it's because we believe Satan's lie over God's truth what's going to make you happy I don't want to go through this I'm going to take an escape yeah and that's unbelief but when we walk in faith and finally get to the point where you know what I am going to believe God's word no matter what that thing says and you turn around that last time it says you're done and I'm walking free you'll come to that friend if you keep walking that's right absolutely Satan can't can't overcome you he can't knock you down it's like job he was going through some hard times he didn't like it he did not like what he was going through and everyone is discouraging his own wife was discouraging and said why don't you just curse God and it says he never charged God foolishly he said God gave he can take it away blessed be the name of the Lord and he said that and that was the right thing but then he on on past that he was just like he was in a hard time he was saying this ain't fair this is not what I should be going through you know what's what's the purpose of trying to be a good person if God lets you go through this it's the things we all think all the time we think about these things you know what's the purpose of being a Christian if I had to have this and if God's A Healer why am I going through this and if God's a deliverer why do I have this problem if God's going to sa my kids why are they out running in the world and we have all these questions we keep asking these things and it's very foolish questions blessed be the name of the Lord the go God brought me this far he'll bring me the rest of the way blessed be the name of the Lord Brother brandom got to that point he got that close to CH to charging God foolishly you know what he's talking about he said I was ready to say well that's the way he's going to treat me I'm quitting forget it he opens his mouth to say that and what came out the Lord gives the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord why because he said there's a tie poost inside there there's something inside that held him you can't do this on your own you can't go through the bitterness with with on your own you will walk away it's too much sat can make it too hard but brother and sister when there's something inside that holds you oh my something inside hold you and when you're ready to give up and something said no come on come on picks you up and go and sometime that's when you get to church you barely drag yourself and you sit on the back row back I'm not saying anything you s in back row I know you're back there for the right reason but you sit on you sit on the back row because you can't have the faith to walk any farther up and the and brother Thomas gets up there he preaches something and you know God spoke directly to you and God know exactly what you're going through and it just gave you enough strength to get back up and go back and have lunch with someone and come to church the next time and what do you do you recognize Man this ain't me doing this at all this is the the the the the power of God is moving me along and giving me the strength to keep going is that amazing on you know why he does that because he loves you that's all it is so God delivers through life and through death he answers prayer he answers every prayer sometime he is yes sometime no sometime wait and sometime he don't say anything that's an answer it is Hebrews 12 forfor seeing we all also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that set before it's the whole thing is patient just be patient just keep going just keep going there's going to be hard times there's going to be good times yeah just keep pressing on that's right that's all you got to do now I'm going to read um yeah I got time let's keep going I I read verse two let's go down to verse three for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself let you be weird and faint in your minds don't be Wei and faint in your mind that's all it's saying how do you do that you just keep walking you keep believing you have not resisted un blood striving against sin you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as un children my son despise not the changes that simple friends these trials we go through the the the disciplines and all these things it sometime it's a rebuke from the Holy Spirit saying you know what you have the wrong attitude here you got the wrong approach there yes right you're believing the wrong thing here you're protecting yourself For Whom The Love Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth and if you don't accept it if you're not partakers and you're not Sons you're bastard and not Sons so you want to know if you're a child of God if you accept the chastening that's a good way to know it so when the brother Thomas gets up and chews on you for a little while you say oh this hurts I don't like this praise the Lord Preacher Brother Thomas ouch it's a good sign that you got some something going for you something good because that's the way a child of God does Amen Let's uh let me turn change just a little bit here uh John 11 gonna go to John 11 we GNA talk about Lazarus we all know the story so I'm not going to read a lot of it but we're going to start at 11 uh 20 John 11:20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus went and met him but but Mary sat still in the house Minds when he didn't show up surely Jesus was going to come as soon as he heard he was sick and he was seriously sick so I sent him again hey he's dying you need to come and the the the the runner came back and said he he ain't coming he yes he is La did you tell him Lazarus is dying yeah he said he's gonna stay there for another day or two he's busy what was he doing sitting out in the sun what yeah he was just he was just rest they're eating they're having a good time La you told him Lazarus is done yeah well what kind of a friend is that you ever feel that when you pray and pray and pray and you don't get an answer what are you doing why don't you answer me where is you at I I prayed and prayed and you don't come and I need your presence I'm I'm having a hard time where is you so he died and it was over oh my goodness what good was having Jesus for your friend now because he let my brother die but there's two responses Martha's and Mary's right something that anchored in Martha that hadn't anchored as deep in Mary because when Martha heard he was coming she got up and went to meet him and Mary sat still her faith was paralyzed by The Bitter she lost confidence she couldn't move so she sat there been there yes sir just depression down don't have enough energy to breathe my next breath just wish you could crawl in a hole and get buried Martha got to Jesus she said Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now oh my even now even now whatever you ask of God God will give it to thee is that amazing Mary sat still Martha said yeah but even now he's dead but whatever you ask God will do for you something that anchored Jesus said thy brother shall rise again Mark says I know he should rise and Resurrection the last day Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live what whosoever liveth and believeth him he shall never die believest thou this preach your little servant get her faith just a little bit higher she said yeah he Lord I believe that thou are the Christ the son of God which should come into the world oh my they were having quite a time there some honey flowing right there and when she had said so she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master has come and call us for thee as soon as she heard that she Rose quickly and came unto him why what stirred Mary's Faith she heard her name called The Master's calling for you you're sitting down there in your Pew and you can't hardly move and you just can't wait to get out church because you feel like such a hypocrite and all of a sudden something comes across the pulpit and you know he just called your name he spoke directly to your need and you know that he still cares you know that he is still around you know that he is still here and that he never left you you might have walked away you might feel like you're totally abandoned but you realize that he was there all the time he would just move and he would just just stripping a few shaving a little bit more of yourself off you so that he can manifest himself when you hear that personal call you feel that personal word that comes to you then everything everything is okay again and it can happen just like that and that amazing that still Small Voice and you hear your voice called he says oh he's still here he said I've been doing this how come you don't believe how come you doubt me why you I I've been here the whole time I brought you through everything I brought you through and yet when something goes wrong you're ready to be like the disciples in the ship oh my goodness we're gonna die he's right back there sleeping I know but we're gonna die he's in the boat I know but we're going to die wake them up you can't wake them up with your lips you can't call on the scene with your lips you can't come on the scene with your prayers doesn't that sound weird so the prophet said your prayers doesn't come on the scene your lips doesn't C on the scene you know what does faith all he's looking for is Faith and you don't even have to say a thing but from your heart you just recognize yeah but I still believe I don't care what Satan does I still believe I don't care what I'm going through I still believe and I might look like a HP I might be the worst person in the church but something inside of me still believes and I'm not going to give up something keep's holding me yeah Mary ran out there and said oh he still cares we saw what happen amen amen I have I have to read this one more quote this one quote and it's a little bit long so I'm going to shorten it a little bit is in SM Church age just kind of everything together then we're going to be done talking about going through suffering the Lord Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of the people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stand the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering sometime he looks at you and you're suffering with what whatever it is he says I know what you're going through you can come here and have a wonderful service you got something on your mind you pray for it maybe it's a physical illness maybe it's you need Deliverance whatever it is and you have a wonderful time and you walk out the door you realize you still got that problem said why didn't he heal me why didn't he take that away he said I know I'm gonna bless you I'm going to be part of your worship you're going to feel my presence I know what you're going through but I'm not going to deliver You Yet brother Braham said what a stumbling block that is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches as people suffer if you have that attitude friends it's time to grow up yes time to grow up he lets you suffer because he knows it's best for you we go through this everyone goes through it now there's some scripture like I said I'm going to skip some of this down you can go read I recommend you do you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election no matter what happens his love was proven True by the fact they were chosen unto salvation friends this is how you know God loves you because he chose you it's election when you see that you've been elected then you know God loves you because you're part of his family you know how you kind of love your family a little special God does too he said these are my kids I'm going to love them a little special and I'm not g to lose him he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign are you willing to let him have his way are you willing to let him choose how your life glorifies IES him yes through suffering through death through loss but it is all with a purpose if you did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered with a while we would be made perfect be established strengthen and settled suffering is the only way we get to that point friend you have to suffer we all have to suffer and you can suffer for the devil you can suffer for Christ you're going to suffer for somebody but you might as well make it worthwhile because you suffer for the devil you have bitterness at the end and you're G to stand there one day and say oh my goodness what a fool I was I had every opportunity to have eternal life that's right but I let Satan talk me out of it because he told me that that bitterness was too much for me I could be happier without it he quotes Hebrews he were son yet learn obedience by the things which he suffered being made perfect he be the author and of Eternal salvation to all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection we have to suffer for him to come to a place Perfection we want to go on the on the Rapture you got to have perfect love you got to have perfect Faith all these things you got to have it friends and the only way we get that to express is when we die to ourselves and let Christ be manifest to us only way it's gonna happen let me just try to finish here he said Peter says think not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we all have tried and chasen his sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God what a difference from the attitudes many times we got trouble in our church maybe I should go to another church well if your church ain't suffering and being tried it isn't of God so why are you going leaving for when you know God's in the midst of it think about that if it's not being tried if not suffering it ain't of God every person in every church and everyone goes through this kind of stuff it's what we have to do you know what you know what happens and you all know this you've been through enough trials well you know what happens when there's a a problem in the church and you work together and you get through it after a while it just makes you closer to each other if you want through with the right attitude it sure does it makes you a stronger Church makes you a stronger person the the cotty skies and storms the life for no signs of God's disapproval neither are the bright Skies the still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the belove his love is the election which he's elected which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes how shall we know it because he said so let me just stop there one more time I'm going to I'm gonna wind it up here but anytime you say I don't even know God loves me you just called him a liar he said he loves you what more do you want well I don't feel his love well what does that have to do with are you a feeler now you just go by your feelings or do you go by what he said you go by faith because he allows you to feel all kinds of ways to prove that when you're feeling down and beat down and you don't feel lovable and you just you know your family can't stand you your dog can't stand you and yet still God loves you because he said he did you ever see someone who needs that constant reassurance do you love me do you love me yes oh my goodness how many times do I have to say so and yet that's how we are so many times with God yes I love you I brought you to church tonight didn't I you think you out here on your own right you Lord I came with my presence when you're here do you think that was your presence I preach the word to encourage you do you think that was Phil's word he loves us he wants us to believe that and if we will just just just deny Satan's junk and all that that that that doubt and fear and all that other stuff he keeps putting in our head and all that junk we just deny that and just say God loves me Satan what are you going to do about it just keep going in patience oh my goodness that's all he's looking for let me finish this y'all go ahead and stand I I can quit preaching if it's stand go ahead you L us amen yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said and manifest that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as his sons that's what's going on you look around he's placed us as his sons here we are Sons and Daughters of God he has done this work how shall I prove my love to him by believing what he said that's all he's asking for simple as that believing what he said and then if I do that conducting myself with joyid the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass isn't he wonderful isn't he wonderful I tell you what it's all in plan every every every trial You' been through was all had a purpose for it everything you go through is a purpose and everything and if if you had the right attitude it produce more Christ if you didn't have the right attitude then he's going to take you through it again until you had the right attitude until you can produce Christ isn't he wonderful look what he's doing look at every everyone look what he's done in your life look what he's brought you through I don't care if you're 10 years old or 100 years old you can look in your life we see well God did this for me God did this for me God did this for me if you're just a young person here God love you to come to the church maybe you were born into if he was born into the message well look at all the billions of people who weren't look at the opportunity God gives you just by having you in a situation like this he has a purpose for you find what it is and you're gonna be fine isn't he let's sing that song isn't he wonderful can we sing that isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful is it Jesus my Lord wonderful seen ears have [Music] H is Jesus my Lord wonderful sing it again oh is wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't Jesus My Hope [Music] [Music] word is Jesus lord wonder One More Time oh wonderful wonderful wonderful isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful [Applause] eyes have SE ears [Music] have is Jesus my Lord [Music] wonderful Amen Let me just leave you this just reiterate one more time there are some people he delivers great faith delivers them other people the same great faith they die some people they have great faith and you see this deliverance and that and you have great testimonies and other people their testimony is I'm still going through it but I'm still faithful going through it what takes more faith to have God come and touch you and heal you or let you go on and on with this disease or what the problem is month after month year after year and you're still faithful and you still struggle with this and you're still struggling with but you're still faithful and after a while people look at you and say well you must have got over that cuz I don't see any evidence that you're suffering anymore you say oh no it's still there but the evidence that I'm suffering is under the blood because I know what God has done for me and he has promised me deliverance and if it's through Deliverance in this body or getting a new body I don't care but I'm still delivered ask ask brother Donnie's daughter if she's sick right now she ain't sick anymore she never going to be sick again and brother and sister if he he ordains that you're going to suffer through this life and your whole life it's just built around suffering and suffering and yet you come to a place where people only see Christ through you that was your purpose in this life what's your testimony because I am faithful through the bitterness and if it takes all the way to the end then I'm still faithful that takes more faith than some God coming down and just setting you free right here but it's not what we want nobody wants that bitterness no one wants that P because we want to have a great testimony look what God did and set me free but you don't get to choose you don't get to choose your purpose in life I was quick preaching you don't get to choose what was going on you don't get to choose how your life is going to glorify God you have to recognize it and you get that relationship with Christ and he said this is what I want in your life are you willing to walk this path and you're GNA say oh take this from me I don't want this path nevertheless not my will but what you want done and someone looks at you say all I see is Christ God bless you brother and sister prise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen amen had to think of the Rich Young Ruler a that right he had to make a choice didn't he
