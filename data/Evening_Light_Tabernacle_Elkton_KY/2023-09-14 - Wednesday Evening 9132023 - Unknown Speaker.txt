and we just ask God that you'll have your perfect way and those Lord streaming we ask God you'd be with them also Father in a special way as they listen Lord Jesus we pray a special blessing upon each and every one in Jesus Christ name amen and amen praise the Lord amen so if you will uh turn your Bibles to the Book of Revelations Revelations and amen I think we're still okay amen speak a little further Amen on Amen the goodness of God and and how great he is amen I'll tell you what since Sunday I've been just thinking what we preached about it amen and amen and I just tell you what it's so good it's just amazing what God can do when you open up your mind Amen to how great God is amen you realize you realize how little you really know amen yeah it's so amazing God is good uh what was it as I was coming to church I thought about um that song because there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day amen I don't believe we've ever understood the gospel like we have in this hour I don't think we've understood the concept or been in the back God part of God's mind so to speak and understand what the whole plan was all about about like we did in this hour amen because it'll be light in the evening time amen a greater light than any other time amen so praise God and that's what we're doing when we come together just to look at that light and let that light shine down in our hearts and so I believe it will shine again this evening with the help of the Lord all right Revelations will begin amen and I want to speak on omniscience and elections omniscience and election amen so Revelations 1 and we'll begin with verse 17. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead amen and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and death amen over in verse 8 of the same chapter says I am the alpha the Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is is to come the Almighty we got it amen so we want to start right here amen and I like that I like this first scripture that we read amen because he identifies Jesus Christ isn't that right now over in Isaiah around the 40th chapter down through chapter 45 somewhere if you'll go look at that you'll find that God calls himself the I am quite a few times I am the I am amen that is my name one place he says that that's my name you know so one of the first names that we find God calling himself is that he's the I am I think of his Moses amen I believe when he went down to Egypt he says you know when he was they asked who represents him he says the I am sent me the I am amen and so uh you know because it I think it shows us that God is a present God Amen I like that don't you because we're always looking at the god of history or the god of the future but he is the I am amen even in the next second or the next hour or tomorrow we want God in that but what's important is that God is right here right now amen amen and so uh praise God he is the I am praised me to God so we look at that and we begin to just think about it and tonight as we talk about this and we want to first of all talking about omniscience or omissions or what we also might call for knowledge right for knowledge this is something of course that we as message Believers have heard a lot now the things that we talk about tonight of course most churches just wouldn't couldn't believe this even brother banham if you remember said now this is a bad word used in the Pentecostal group right for Destination you know other people just you know people have a problem with predestination amen and uh so let me see here first let's start it says put a brand press first of all predestinate that word predestined he said that's not a good word to use he says now the word foreknowledge is better he says and of course we know that's because of the group that he was in he says now predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination or destiny amen so try to help me understand this predestination is to destined something to happen it's destined it's destined it's supposed to it makes it happen isn't that right and it looks to foreknowledge because God destineds things to happen because he already knows just how to make it happen he knows what's gonna happen gone a little bit more tonight with the help of the Lord because amen you know we've heard it a lot but I like it amen and there's another scripture as I begin as I begin to study and and seeking the Lord and what he'd have me to speak amen I was over in Isaiah kind of going back over on my message or whatever to see where we're at and this is what I picked up over in Isaiah the 46th chapter if you want to turn with me and this is kind of Amen where we want to pick up here let me see I'm going to go to Revelations right too because I want to compare that amen this uh scripture that we're about to read because if you'll notice here he says I am Alpha and Omega Jesus is not talking to John isn't that something out that as soon as Jesus went back into Spirit form that he began to speak to John he says I am Alpha and Omega now we know that the alpha of course from what I understand is the first letter of the alphabet and Omega is alas isn't that right so he's the complete alphabet and also he's the beginning and in the ending and the ending I mean at the beginning and the ending that's what he is so I think Sunday we covered it a little bit how that he covers all time and space I mean so he's he he is all of that and amen and so and I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm nine remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me amen how many slapped ain't none like him Lord that's just come to my mind isn't there even a song Lord there is none like you that's right nobody's even close to comparing to whom will you compare me amen nobody can even now notice here he says verse 10 declaring declaring the end from the beginning amen declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done amen saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure just comes to mind I didn't write it down but it comes to mind where it says and all things were created up over Revelations I'm not sure which chapter is this all things were created and uh for his pleasure in that one for for his pleasure he created everything it was all for his pleasure here he is actually uh letting us know that he'll he'll he he my counsel shall stand amen calling a ravenous uh bird from the East a man that executed is my counsel from the far country Yates I have spoken it I also will bring it to pass I have purpose it and I will also do it amen how many knows that when you think about the foreknowledge of God when you think about the predestination of God the destination how to be predestines things to happen and so forth I got to thinking of of what it was what it's really like what what it is really like for God Amen to have note everything and I thought now what about what would happen if you or I knew the future huh if you and I knew the future let's say we have the scoreboard of the future let's say you would know what the stock market would do for the next year or whatever yeah you know what I would do if I would if I knew what the stock market would do and all that probably I'd probably saw everything I got I sell everything I got and in a year I'd probably mostly it's been alive somebody that knew the future isn't that right how many notes called inside trading right well if you knew what was going to be really up there gonna we're gonna go way high and everything and that's the whole thing about the stock market it's investing in the right thing you would never make a mistake you never lose [Music] faces or whatever it was in this in a world of sin and so forth why you know exactly what hurts isn't that right [Applause] all right let's talk about uh foreknowledge just a little bit now I want to use an example here and I want to be careful in doing this but maybe Danny if you would help me do this tonight let me express to you one of the ways that I kind of got in my mind of what four knowledge is and and so forth and God knowing everything all right I want you to take take your hand like this and go in um what do you call in slow motion okay and come at me like that just slow motion like that and don't don't follow me just go right from my faith no matter what I for the face now don't hit me we're in church tonight okay but let's go like why that's that's knowing what's going to come he can do whatever he wants in the meantime isn't that right and how many knows guess what God did whenever he knew that head would try to kill all those children isn't that right he knew he'd tell Joseph to take Mary and little and Jesus and Scott on out of there that's why I say Satan doesn't stand a chance against God because God already knows the devil's move here any seats where that hand is coming from and and my when I think about that and I think about you know that God predestined he foresaw you he foresaw every bit of you he knew that every he knows everything that you would ever do he knew I would go just like that before the foundation of the world oh my are you ready listen to this my notice here better man I'm talking about uh being uh birth being pre-planned things that are to be I believe it was out of you you'll be planned I guess believe that every one of you knows that your birthday did you know that you're being here never originated from a myth a thought an accident no none of those things you know or why was you born no think about it you listen Brother Band makes the segment out not a thought or a myth everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you're here here [Music] didn't we just read that he declares the end from the beginning not only does God know where that punch is going to come from not only does he know everything's going to happen in the future but he goes into the future so to speak huh so to speak time travels is that right goes into that he sets certain things in order how does he time travel by speaking his word you know and he says that certain things are going to happen and even laodicea everything 's pre-planned everything's orchestrated everything's in the program are gone now even when I listen to brother Banner preaching on predestination the foreknowledge when he was talking about Peter and the Wolf and and the symphony because it's like a great Symphony I mean it's just like a great Symphony let me just read you this quote now to you adults the scripture is God's Symphony yes Hallelujah only the composure knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening amen how many through him that have an ear let him hear so all of this oh my only the composure and those who are listening those who are interested in knowing what the drama is how many is interested in knowing folks how many knows that the world the world is into this how the world out there doesn't really know what it's all about it's all confusion I don't know how that other band said it uh what he said here he said all all kinds of uh you know to them it's just a bunch of noise you know to the world this whole thing's all a bunch of noise but not to the believer to the believer we know that we're not just here to get rich we're not just cheered to make more we're not just here more than that we're here to be Sons and Daughters of the almighty God we are here as a boot camp a training ground amen what lays ahead man we'll get to elective election here in the love and elective love and so forth here in a minute but let me go a little bit further here no no you are interested in knowing what the drama is but you can you see the changing the Junctions of the word all the music it throws something sometime it's going this way for a while amen but did aren't we told that hey sometimes it's just oh life goes all smooth and everything and but when it rains it pours and you realize hey you know it's gonna go that way no matter how much hard you try to make It Go all good it ain't always going to go good all right now notice so he says 90 changes and after a while all around what is it to you uh to to you who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it not interested in it it's just a racket I mean it's a cruel world it's a terrible world out there it's just a big racket but it's not for the believer it's a whole lot more than a racket amen they're not interested in it it's just a racket oh my but those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming they know something fixing to happen Hallelujah now I want you to think about it uh and while I'm going to talk about if you knew the future you would without question be the richest man and end up on the planet isn't that right because you knew the future amen now let me ask you something else what about what about the believer what about the Christian that's a good answer right there I mean I was we no the future therefore we can be the richest people on the planet we can be the happiest people on the planet [Applause] hey I take that for that he that believe is on me Jesus said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live and he that liveth and believes on me shall never die I mean that's the future of those who receive Christ you'll never die that's your future it should never die that's worth more than any manner you could ever make hey man so how many would take man like Birdman said give me 50 years give me 70 years 80 years of hardship and toil and misery and pain and I'll give you all of that if that's what it takes if I can just get eternal life I would rather have that than to be here for a million years and to be the king of the world but the man says to be king of all the world the ruler of all the world for a thousand years for 10 000 years I would take the 50 years or whatever a misery and woe let me tell you something we as Christians we're not oh man I'm getting ahead of myself not promise the flower a bit of ease God's election and God's electing You by foreknowledge he wasn't uh in the show oh my it's going to be all easy for you now hey man we'll get in that in a minute but listen so we look at that we think about it you know truly we do we have the scorecard devil Lake of Fire believer eternal life amen we have this cocoa this is the future we can see a future amen isn't it something how how the God would use the prophet of God and he would look and look back and I I believe he must have seen Marilyn Monroe having a heart attack didn't he he said it wasn't the drugs it was her heart attack God could tell her Allen Luke Plumb Back to Eden he feels all time in space I mean it was everything that you every emotion you ever do every color of every shirt every suit you have to wear everything you ever did that's all recorded calls it recorded the man and God just replayed it or whatever took him back to that time space and showed him what he looked like and all these other things people that were sitting there maybe all Jason this after the other take them back in time right there it is it ain't going nowhere [Music] God knows everything he predestinates he ordains amen praise the Lord because he knows what you would do he knows what you would do what you will do I thought man you can just relax a Believer it's so real it's so such a security to be a believer now if you're not a Believer it's a scary thought and a lot of people if they're not saved the eyes are scary it's up to think that if you ever was saved you would say before the foundation of the world how many believe that I'm going to say it again I've said it before the pope but here one of the most things that you can't comprehend is that God doesn't have to plan something he does plan something but if we when we think about a plan it's around all right let's change the plan let you know when God has a thought it's a perfect thought the first time how many knows God's thoughts are eternal and you have to be one of those thoughts that he had before the foundation of the world if you're ever going to be there this brings into now another thought that is identification amen because I mean it's important that you know who you are what you are amen and as you look into here right into the mirror of God's word it's going to reflect it's going to reflect what you are in there right who your daddy is who's your father the choices that you make identify who you are and if you are identified with them when you've been buried with him by baptism hey amen amen come forth in newness of life amen you've got filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're identified with Acts 2 you're identified in God's word you want to be the happiest person the greatest thing that you'll ever have is to know that you're a son of God for anything you'll ever have is to know who you really are what your identity really is amen you have to be a part of this plan how many believe that to be a part of his plan a part of those thoughts those things that he knew and purpose before the foundation of the world I wanted to give it just a little bit of a thought on on the opposite side of it now Jesus says all that come to me what if he say you know well I'll tell you what you're going to be saved if you don't do this you don't anybody be saved no no you wouldn't make it because you're a human being full of mistakes promised by the prophet of God you'll always have mistakes as long as you draw breath yeah Lord forgive me for that viewers relying on yourself but if you're not relying on ourselves we're relying on what he did what he wrote it's so much so that he told Peter them he says man the devil said oh my you're casting them out the lady we're walking and all open up the eyes and all of these people that joins me because your names are written in hell you're a part of the program of God the judge aren't you glad for that see we love Romans don't we I love Romans 8. I love Romans 8 and verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate Amen to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many Brethren moral over whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called them and he also Justified then we Justified them we also glorified let me see over in chapter 9 chapter 9 of Romans talking about for knowledge and for the nation in verse 22 what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known and do it with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction then he might that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy how many beliefs that's what we're talking about tonight we're talking about the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy I'm gonna believe you're a vessel of Mercy which he had a far prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles how many notes he before ordained you to this Glory amen even us whom he has called there you find yourself and listen who he has called them he also Justified whom he has Justified then he also glorified Converse in Ephesians before we kind of go in a different direction tonight but Ephesians 1 and verse let's go with verse 4. according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children of Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will how many knows if God knows he's in infinite I noticed he could set things in order to happen now notice by God's wise Providence he had reveal by spiritual going to be a chosen vessel and his mother wasn't scared of the King's Command by faith she's saw him with the children bring them over into the Promised line the Promised Land as a matter of fact I think I got it here yeah here it is everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you're here the infinite God knowed to be infinite he had to know every flea that ever would be on the earth and how much many times that it with that it's I that's infinite now our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means amen the infinite God he knowed all things therefore there's nothing out of cater if we know the word of God we know where we are living we know the hour that we're living in and a while ago I think George somebody said we know what the future holds listen to what brother Adam says we know what lays ahead we know what lays ahead now there's a lot of things happening in our lives I wasn't expecting a Saturday either but overall we know why do we know that lays ahead we know the one that holds your future we know that he had promised that he's going to take you through isn't that right no matter what comes your way no matter what problems you face all about it amen amen and God is going to take care of you he's promising we know what lays ahead and God will it always makes a way because we're in his hands were completely surrendered to him praise be glad for that he knows all about it and just as he can go and he can block a punch he can do whatever he can set it all in order all we got to do is be yielded to him and say God whatever your plan is Lord that's what I want amen praise the Lord Hallelujah now action election always election always also also looks back to foreknowledge foreknew you and God elected you now do you know what I really like about election you know because some of some of the SE politicians that you know you just like to fire him just fire the guy when you're elected you can't be fired I they took a great big they're doing that take a re-vote they have to take some look a vote put him in a vote left take him out that you can't just fire the guy not how many knows that if you're a child of God God you you can't just put you out there's only one not one that I know of can put you out he says anybody adds to this book his name can be removed you know but God the one that does it amen one whose names are going to be removed you know it would scare me to hear a red preacher come up here and preach something contrary to the word and change this take that away because you know what I would think that guy's gonna have his name removed if you don't repent he's a he's a good candidate to have his name removed I don't have my name removed I bet I want to stay right there with the word but that's what I I don't know about you but that's what I like about election amen got elected you to be Son of God now notice he elected you he predestinated you and he showed his love to you by what election how many believes that his elect his love is elective love listen to what the brother Brian says the proof of his love is election no matter what happens his love is proven by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation amen God has chosen you unto salvation through sanctification of the spirit and believed for the truth he may commit you to death like he did Paul he may commit you to suffering like he did job that's his prerogative but that he's Sovereign but it's all for his purpose but the thing of it is I like this because we love election but remember this if God elected you he elected you to be his son and daughter of God and when I was thinking about this he's elected you to hardship he elected you to trials remember one place here Jesus said you know and he said man I I send you out there sheep amongst the wolves it has not been easier the the believer those who are elected and foreknowledge and the foreknowledge of God he said we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of fun I mean it was that character doesn't come by just uh magic wand those things come through suffering and through hardships and battles and everything else he says blessed are they which are uh uh uh hunger now for they shall be fulfilled isn't that right all these different things he said about it when they persecute you and and so far from City to city and this out of the other all down through time my the Christian those elected ones they've had it hard God never promises elect the people that he foreknew a lifeline and then that's why I said Lord Jesus look at us here we are in laodicea and and even if you look back at the early 1900s you know and the first depression first world war one the people that didn't have food and even Americans we were it was wrong nothing thank you Lord for not let me be born in 1903 or whatever huh you know and God here we are foreign and so forth has always been filled with blood in a bloody road but to the steak fed the Lions all kinds of hardships endured God never promises far better bees but he promised that he chastise you as many as I love because he's getting you ready for something greater amen boy out there we just can't be we should watch you we can't be soft got to be rugged Christians amen because I'm telling you what the devil's trying to drown people in the pleasures of the world and and with riches and everything else too busy with those things listen the talking about Israel he says they couldn't figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that lovement and baby in Parental care but God said and his love was elective love and love real genuine love is also corrective lovers many as I love I rebuke I chase and I chastise oh I got to thinking about God but if you truly knew me if you truly like than me you amen now I don't know how many of y'all can say it but it ain't been easy we've had to overcome a lot of hard stuff amen you gotta get slapped in the face real good and see if you can still kiss that person on the cheek and say I love you brother I love you sister well not a sister you can't get you on the cheek but you know what I mean right right Beth love but I say thank you Lord the son and daughter God they don't look for it easy we don't expect it easy when God said something our way we ought to be Sons and Daughters of God and make him proud how many knows in any family even in this election thing but if I'm talking about he says we know that in the foreknowledge of God God wanted a family of his own he wanted Sons like himself he wanted daughters like himself he wanted us to be like him we've had some good we had some good images of him is that right we've got some sons that came close to him and and we're a lot like him like David is that right oh it was just a big old grizzly bear you're just lying you're just making big old Goliath I'll cut your head up that looks a whole lot like God amen that's what God's trying to do amen he loved us he liked with us that's that's how he shows his love how did we show our love back I think how do we show our love back to him by conducting ourselves as sons and acting like children of the most high this great God that knew all things and ordered all things he's looking for you and I and that's what he's doing in our lives he allows things coming your way friend things is hard to overcome things you gotta really pray about and have God's strength in that's exactly what God has purposed in your life just as he has purposed everything else every trial that comes your way has been purposed by God what was it job said Lord we enjoy the blessings of God shall I receive D amen and the good things of God and then not accept the evil things that he allows to come your way huh that's right no matter what God allows for you to come your way like brother Graham said here it's his prerogative he might put you allowed to you to go through many hard trials like he did job like he did Paul like he did a lot of his children amen that's his prerogative that's what he actually does he chastens as many as beloved I rebuke I chasing so we as children brother Glenn we say well Lord whatever you got to do I'm here because I'm not interested in this world or I know that in me you've let me so say so far you know how happy we ought to be to know that all the things that God has brought you through all the trials he's helped you to overcome [Music] we've got a lot of empty pews folks people didn't overcome they need to overcome oh my even when you want to clear you won't even when you feel that but you won't none of your ears oh my God if you got your name on that book
