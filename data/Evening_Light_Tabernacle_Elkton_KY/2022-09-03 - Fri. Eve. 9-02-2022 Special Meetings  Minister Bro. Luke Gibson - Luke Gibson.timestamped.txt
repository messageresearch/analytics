[25:24] god
[25:25] spirit and come down and become a man he
[25:27] become one of us
[25:29] and what an exchange he made he he who
[25:32] knew no sin became sin that we by the
[25:35] grace of god might become his
[25:37] righteousness amen i'm glad it's a free
[25:40] gift amen it's for anybody that's
[25:42] willing to accept and to believe it amen

[26:43] where she's at she's somewhere
[26:46] there she is sister lisa and then it got
[26:48] about eight of our young people from
[26:50] eight or nine i think from our church
[26:52] that's here with us and you know we were
[26:54] here i don't know how many years ago
[26:56] quite a few years ago i don't remember
[26:57] we brought a bus up about 40 or so young
[27:00] people or so and all of them well my
[27:03] daughter-in-law back there they all of
[27:05] them are growed up married and all got
[27:08] kids
[27:09] and i've got six grandchildren one more
[27:12] on the way well all of them were like
[27:13] these guys when we came
[27:15] and so we have a little generational gap
[27:17] and these are our next group coming up
[27:20] and they're just as bad as that other
[27:21] young group they're already
[27:23] looking at women and you know girls and
[27:25] boys and all that and that's just a part
[27:27] of life that's the way it is amen we
[27:29] just want to serve the lord that's
[27:30] that's our main purpose and i'm sure
[27:32] that's why you're having these meetings
[27:34] is to bring young people closer to the
[27:37] lord
[27:37] amen so john chapter 5 if you have your
[27:40] bible saint john chapter 5
[27:43] and i want to read four verses from
[27:44] there saint john chapter 5 thank you
[27:46] brother saint john chapter 5
[27:49] beginning with verse 1 and then i want
[27:51] to turn over to jesus chapter 2.
[27:54] everybody happy tonight
[27:56] amen saint john chapter 5
[27:59] beginning with verse 1 after these after
[28:02] this
[28:04] there was a feast of the jews
[28:07] and jesus went up to jerusalem by the
[28:09] way
[28:10] um he did celebrate the jewish feast
[28:14] jesus as a boy all the way up to his
[28:16] life attended his feast ultimately he
[28:20] went because he would end up being the
[28:21] fulfillment of all of these feasts
[28:25] now there is a jerusalem the sheep
[28:27] market a pool
[28:29] which is called in the hebrew tongue
[28:32] besada
[28:33] having five torches
[28:37] in these lay a great multitude of
[28:39] impotent folk are blind and halt and
[28:42] withered
[28:43] waiting for the moving
[28:46] of the water
[28:48] now listen to this for an angel went
[28:50] down
[28:51] at a certain season
[28:53] into the pool and troubled
[28:56] the water
[28:58] whosoever noticed these words whosoever
[29:01] then first after the troubling of the
[29:04] water stepped in
[29:06] was made
[29:07] whole of whatsoever
[29:10] disease they had so let me say this
[29:12] again
[29:13] whosoever that means anybody
[29:16] when the angel troubled the water they
[29:18] got in there they were cured of
[29:20] whatsoever
[29:22] it wasn't nothing too hard for god
[29:25] he'd do anything for anybody he so it
[29:27] was whosoever was healed of whatsoever
[29:32] now i'm gonna bring something to your
[29:35] thought tonight because what you will
[29:36] not find in these verses
[29:38] is when so ever
[29:41] because whensoever
[29:44] was only when the angel stirred the
[29:46] water
[29:48] these same sick folk could got in that
[29:50] water a day before or day after and it
[29:52] wouldn't have done no good
[29:55] because we believe in whosoever but not
[29:57] when so ever you can only get in when
[29:59] god stirs the water
[30:02] can't come to god whenever you want you
[30:03] come when the holy ghost calls you
[30:06] now turn with me in ephesians chapter 2
[30:08] if you would
[30:10] ephesians chapter 2 very familiar verse
[30:13] verses here starting with verse 1
[30:16] and paul said and you have the quickened
[30:18] who were dead
[30:20] dead in trespasses and sins that's all
[30:23] of us
[30:24] where any times past this is before
[30:26] christ you walked according the course
[30:29] of this world according to prince of the
[30:30] power of the air
[30:32] the spirit that now worketh in the
[30:34] children of disobedience
[30:36] among whom also we had our conversation
[30:38] that means the life that you lived in
[30:40] times past how in the lust of our flesh
[30:43] fulfill the desires of the flesh and of
[30:45] the mind and we're by
[30:48] nature notice this nature
[30:50] the children wrath even as others by
[30:52] nature that means we all came in the
[30:54] world by sexual birth and we had a
[30:56] nature that was
[30:59] contrary to god
[31:02] just because your bride denied doesn't
[31:04] mean that you weren't a sinner
[31:07] we all were sinners
[31:10] but you see this little word in verse 4
[31:13] starts the verse but
[31:15] that means everything changes
[31:18] but god
[31:20] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[31:22] wherewith he loved us
[31:24] even when we were dead notice this even
[31:27] when we were dead in sins and trespasses
[31:29] had quickened us together with christ by
[31:32] grace
[31:33] are you saved and hath raised us up now
[31:36] here's present tense raised us up and
[31:38] made us sit together in heavenly places
[31:40] in christ jesus now here's our future
[31:43] that in the ages to come he might show
[31:46] of exceedingly riches of his grace
[31:49] and his kindness toward us through
[31:51] christ jesus or
[31:53] by grace are you saved
[31:56] through faith i love this and not that
[31:58] of yourselves it is a gift of god not of
[32:01] works lest any man should boast now
[32:05] everybody here tonight has a right to
[32:07] boast you have a right to brag as long
[32:10] as you brag on the right one
[32:12] and that's on jesus
[32:14] bow your heads if you would just for a
[32:16] moment father
[32:18] we thank you for your word we thank you
[32:20] for the privilege father of again
[32:22] tonight of being assembled lord in your
[32:24] divine presence we thank you for the
[32:26] songs of zion that was sung oh god
[32:29] lord we come now as we open the bible
[32:32] all the greatest book that's ever been
[32:34] written on the face of the earth
[32:36] what a privilege it is to read from it
[32:38] tonight father
[32:39] the lord your prophet said any man can
[32:41] open the bible but god it takes the holy
[32:44] spirit to make it live
[32:46] and lord jesus we pray as we just pull
[32:48] our little thought tonight from this oh
[32:50] god that you'll just like take the bread
[32:53] and put it in your hand and multiply it
[32:56] father to the heart of the people speak
[32:58] to the young people tonight lord in a
[33:00] special way oh god i pray you'd help me
[33:02] to get out
[33:04] of the way and lord jesus you just to
[33:06] have your way in this service we pray
[33:08] that you'd meet every need among us oh
[33:10] god we're all a needy people tonight may
[33:13] you have the preeminence in this service
[33:15] we pray in the name of the lord jesus
[33:17] christ and the whole church says
[33:20] amen god bless you you may be seated
[33:24] what i find amazing in this little story
[33:27] first of all is that
[33:30] jesus
[33:31] performed this miracle
[33:33] following the troubling of the water on
[33:35] a man that had been lame and he didn't
[33:39] have the ability to be able to get into
[33:41] the water the time it was troubled
[33:44] and jesus performed a miracle and the
[33:46] religious folk of that day
[33:49] got angry because that he performed it
[33:51] on the sabbath
[33:53] i think it's a terrible shame
[33:55] when we get to the place that we're more
[33:57] interested in laws than we are souls
[34:01] when our creeds of our church means more
[34:04] to us than sick folk
[34:07] but jesus didn't matter because he knew
[34:09] that the sabbath was made for man and
[34:12] man was not made for the sabbath
[34:14] not only that he was the lord of the
[34:17] sabbath
[34:18] and then he follows that up when when
[34:20] their anger he follows it up and says
[34:22] basically i've only done what the father
[34:25] showed me for the son can do nothing of
[34:27] himself but what the father shows him
[34:31] so our scene tonight begins at the pool
[34:34] of the seder and here at a certain
[34:37] season the bible said an angel would
[34:40] come down and that angel the prophet
[34:43] said would actually get into the water
[34:44] now maybe sight unseen maybe they never
[34:47] saw no angel but they saw the effects of
[34:50] the presence of that angel
[34:52] tonight we may not necessarily see god
[34:55] with our natural eyes but we certainly
[34:58] feel the effects of his presence when he
[35:00] comes in we see him heal the sick we see
[35:03] him cast out devils the greatest thing
[35:06] we see him do is take a sin sick soul
[35:09] and redeem them by his grace
[35:11] wash them in his blood and they walk out
[35:14] and hear a spotless son and daughter of
[35:16] almighty god that's one of the greatest
[35:18] miracles that could ever happen on a
[35:20] human being is to be redeemed by the
[35:22] blood of the lord jesus christ
[35:25] and so i will say this before we get
[35:27] started that each one of us were at one
[35:30] time in that condition and it is true we
[35:33] could not help ourselves
[35:36] we could maybe reform we can maybe do a
[35:39] little better we can make a lot of you
[35:41] know
[35:42] a little
[35:43] what we call every year make little vows
[35:45] and things of that nature but that won't
[35:47] get us any closer to god
[35:49] there's nothing that man can do to reach
[35:52] god
[35:53] but there is something god can do to
[35:54] reach us
[35:56] i'm glad one day he reached down and got
[35:59] a hold of us amen so we find here that
[36:02] when the angel and i want to hurry the
[36:04] angel troubled the water the first
[36:06] person to get into that water
[36:09] amen after it was troubled was made
[36:11] whole now let me just say this that
[36:13] means there was a lot of sick folk i'll
[36:16] show you what brother batman said
[36:17] great multitudes brother madam said one
[36:20] multitude is about 2 000 people he said
[36:23] there were great multitudes so there
[36:25] were several thousands of people
[36:28] that was there at that water waiting
[36:30] with anticipation on the stirring of
[36:33] that water now brother they could have
[36:35] gotten that water every day they could
[36:37] obey they could have swam they could
[36:39] have baptized they could have done a lot
[36:40] of things dumped themselves in it and it
[36:42] would not have any effect on them but
[36:45] once that angel stirred that water and
[36:48] put virtue in that water and it started
[36:50] turning the first man that dropped in
[36:52] there became a beneficiary of the virtue
[36:55] of that water which tells me one thing
[36:58] it was just water there was no healing
[37:00] in it there was just water but when god
[37:02] got in it it became supernatural amen
[37:06] brother i'll just say this we can have
[37:08] church this weekend and we can have
[37:10] church and go out and say we had church
[37:12] but if god comes among us it'll be all
[37:15] together a different story amen lives
[37:18] will be changed
[37:21] now we understand
[37:23] the probably god told us that the water
[37:25] had no healing power believe this or not
[37:28] the church world has got to the place
[37:30] they sell miracle water they sell holy
[37:33] water now i'm just going to be honest
[37:35] and i'm not going to be mean but you'd
[37:37] have to be dumb as a box of rocks to
[37:38] believe that
[37:40] i'm not sending no man no money for no
[37:42] holy water
[37:44] the pope ain't got holy water the
[37:46] pentecostals ain't got holy water
[37:48] there's only one real holy water and
[37:50] that's called the holy ghost
[37:53] and i can tell you how to get it tonight
[37:55] but you got to be willing to come god's
[37:57] way
[37:59] now we know when the angel come on there
[38:01] on that water and stirred it the prophet
[38:04] literally says he got in it and left the
[38:06] virtue in there and then when a man
[38:08] stepped in the virtue of that angel
[38:10] from that water went into that person's
[38:12] body
[38:14] and whatever their need was glory to god
[38:17] they was made whole
[38:19] nothing's too
[38:21] hard for god
[38:22] so the angel would come at a certain
[38:25] season now what i want to preach about
[38:27] just for a few minutes tonight bear with
[38:29] me if you would i want to preach on a
[38:31] season of troubling
[38:35] a season of troubling when i read the
[38:38] bible
[38:39] i realized that this bible and nature
[38:41] testifies to it that there are seasons
[38:45] in nature they're seasons in the world
[38:48] we call it winter and winter everything
[38:51] dies
[38:52] that's the season it's death
[38:54] that life leaves them them leaves them
[38:56] limbs and goes down into the root where
[38:59] it stays there until the winter is past
[39:02] then when the season changes which i
[39:04] love spring i love seeing all right now
[39:07] even in my yard i'm starting to watch
[39:09] leaves fall and they're changing colors
[39:11] and we we just people will drive up in
[39:14] the mountains people from our church are
[39:15] going up in the mountain just to watch
[39:17] the changing of the leaf and they don't
[39:18] even realize they love the colors but
[39:20] it's really a sign of death
[39:22] [Music]
[39:23] but then when spring comes around and
[39:25] that life starts coming back up that sap
[39:28] come back up through that tree out into
[39:29] them limbs and then the leaves come out
[39:31] on there again seasons has changed every
[39:34] time a season changes there's a reaction
[39:37] to the changing of the season
[39:40] you can go out here and everything's
[39:41] green or it's springtime so we have
[39:43] winter we have spring and we have summer
[39:46] and we have fall
[39:47] and behind all of that creation
[39:50] is a creator
[39:53] it's all set up until brother branham
[39:55] would go as far as to tell you that
[39:57] nature was god's first bible
[40:01] then we think of the seasons as the
[40:03] prophet would preach it in the spiritual
[40:05] realm like for example justification was
[40:09] one season then as the seasons change we
[40:11] come into sanctification from sanctuary
[40:14] tension we come into the baptism of the
[40:16] holy ghost and
[40:18] from the back
[40:19] back to the holy ghost we come to the
[40:21] holy ghost himself there are seasonal
[40:23] changes and it's all in god's divine
[40:26] timetable nobody can make it happen
[40:29] beforehand nobody can make it be late
[40:31] martin luther came right on the scene at
[40:33] the time god wanted him john wesley came
[40:36] on the scene right at the time god
[40:38] wanted him the pentecostals came on the
[40:40] scene right the time god wanted him and
[40:42] let me just say it you're here tonight
[40:44] right at the time god wanted you you
[40:47] ain't early you ain't late you're here
[40:49] just when god wanted you you know when
[40:51] you saw this message when god wanted you
[40:54] to you know when you got saved when god
[40:56] wanted you to you know when you got the
[40:58] holy ghost what god wanted you to it's
[41:01] all on his divine timetable
[41:06] oh i hope you believe that
[41:08] and again
[41:10] that two
[41:12] spiritual seasons are controlled by god
[41:14] himself
[41:15] who determines the
[41:18] the construction of his own body that's
[41:21] why i tell you mothers don't ever i
[41:23] preach it
[41:24] home don't care where your son is
[41:26] tonight i don't care where your daughter
[41:28] is don't you ever give up on them
[41:31] well you don't know where they're at
[41:32] brother luke they're setting in jail
[41:34] they're over here on drugs my daughter's
[41:36] living in adultery she said i don't care
[41:38] where they're at you keep praying
[41:40] holding your token and one day that
[41:42] season will come and the holy ghost will
[41:44] go and he'll bring that individual and
[41:46] you'll sit back in amazement how did
[41:49] this happen it ain't up to me how it
[41:50] happens as long as it happens amen and
[41:53] god will keep every promise he's ever
[41:55] made to us
[41:56] you believe that do your inheritance
[41:59] believe and thy in thy house shall be
[42:01] saved
[42:02] but it's in god's timing
[42:05] then we think of the natural world
[42:08] and the natural world we come into the
[42:10] world we come in
[42:12] as a child childhood then we come where
[42:15] some of you boys sitting here and
[42:17] different young people tonight teenage
[42:19] years
[42:20] then we come to adults which i'm not
[42:23] saying you're not that but some of us
[42:24] are that and then we come into the
[42:27] elderly time
[42:28] and the elderly time's a wonderful time
[42:30] and that's because you get to go back
[42:32] and be a child again
[42:34] and nobody gets to say nothing about it
[42:37] i told my son i can't wait till i get
[42:39] old instead of us changing your diaper
[42:41] you're going to change my
[42:44] there's nothing you can do about it
[42:48] payback's rough isn't it
[42:52] [Laughter]
[42:54] paul told us
[42:55] when it come to the day of the lord he
[42:57] said but of the times and
[42:59] seasons
[43:01] brethren you have no need that i write
[43:02] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[43:04] that the day of the lord so cometh as a
[43:07] thief in the night
[43:10] that time will come when men will not
[43:12] expect it it's a strategic time that is
[43:15] divinely known by god himself until when
[43:17] brother brennam come to the seventh seal
[43:19] and he picked up all the six seven seals
[43:21] in matthew 24 and when he come the
[43:23] seventh seal jesus said no man knows the
[43:25] day of the hour not even the son the
[43:27] father only brother said was written
[43:28] across it was an unknown term that
[43:30] couldn't make it out and brethren said
[43:31] no man knows that day well there's a
[43:33] reason for that god holds that
[43:35] particular season his own power because
[43:37] why if we all knew it if we all knew it
[43:40] exactly the day would come you know what
[43:41] happened to most of us we'd live in the
[43:43] like today's eagle spirit
[43:45] we live in a backseat condition say well
[43:47] he's coming the weekend we got got to
[43:48] get ready but the truth is because we
[43:50] don't know we live every day at
[43:54] could be that day that jesus would
[43:57] return for his bride
[44:00] when they asked our lord jesus about the
[44:03] kingdom you know because they be honest
[44:05] with you disciples
[44:07] sorry i'm trying to get right into my
[44:09] thought but this is important
[44:11] but they asked jesus to this question
[44:13] but you know after his resurrection will
[44:14] you at this time restore the kingdom of
[44:17] israel they were thinking that was the
[44:18] hour that the kingdom would set up he
[44:20] would come in and run the romans out and
[44:22] set the kingdom up and basically the
[44:23] millennial reign but the truth was
[44:26] death never fit into their program of a
[44:28] messiah
[44:31] it just wasn't in their program until
[44:33] even peter could not see it there was no
[44:35] season of death for messiah in their
[44:37] theology until he said not so my lord
[44:40] that'll never happen to thee
[44:42] jesus turned after telling he was
[44:44] blessed and god gave him a revelation
[44:46] who he was in the next sentence a
[44:48] dialogue he turns to peter get behind me
[44:50] satan
[44:51] he said for the things that you savor be
[44:53] of god and not a man in other words you
[44:55] can't stop god's program
[44:57] you just got to get in the broads
[44:59] program you got to accept god's way of
[45:01] doing it and know that somehow it's all
[45:04] going to be worked out according to his
[45:05] perfect will
[45:07] and it was
[45:09] so after his resurrection just before
[45:11] his ascension they asked him will you
[45:12] this time now will you do it now are you
[45:14] going to start the kingdom he says
[45:16] it's not
[45:17] for you to know the times or the seasons
[45:20] but the father has put in his own power
[45:23] but you shall receive power
[45:26] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[45:28] you and he tells them to go up to
[45:29] jerusalem and wait until they're endued
[45:31] with powerful on high and the season was
[45:34] this a little secret in between the
[45:36] rejection of the messiah and the return
[45:38] of messiah to the 140th a little season
[45:41] there about two days just two days a
[45:43] little season that jesus would construct
[45:46] himself a gentile bride
[45:48] and we're now the finishing up of that
[45:50] gentile bride he's laid the foundation
[45:53] through paul he built it all the way up
[45:55] and here now we've come to the great
[45:57] time of the capping of that great
[45:59] pyramid where christ will come down and
[46:01] become one with his church in the
[46:03] invisible union of the bride of christ
[46:05] aren't you glad to be a part of that god
[46:07] didn't put you down there in the way
[46:09] wide
[46:11] age of ephesus he didn't put you down
[46:12] there in the age of reformation put you
[46:14] right up here at the at the calling out
[46:17] of laodicea hey man that little rim
[46:20] there that little elected group where
[46:21] that headstone would come down and set
[46:23] up on a body amen then resurrect that
[46:26] body and change our body and take us
[46:28] home to glory to three and a half years
[46:30] of a great marriage supper i'm glad
[46:32] tonight by the grace of
[46:34] god to see that and to be a part of that
[46:37] by his grace
[46:38] you know when jesus was here foxes have
[46:41] holes birds have nests but the son of
[46:43] man had no place to lay his head but he
[46:45] came in this day foxes have holes and
[46:48] birds have nests but the son of man now
[46:50] has a place to lay his head and he's
[46:52] laying his head upon his church she's
[46:54] finally been built that when the
[46:56] headstone comes it was rejected when it
[46:58] was the cornerstone but the cornerstone
[47:00] has now become the headstone and that
[47:02] headstone is sitting on a body today and
[47:04] one day will take us home to glory
[47:08] how many believes that now tonight
[47:12] we each are here because we recognize
[47:16] something about god in this day listen
[47:18] close
[47:19] and what we've recognized
[47:21] is he had spiritual food
[47:23] in
[47:24] do
[47:25] season
[47:27] this was the season
[47:29] this message that you and i are loving
[47:31] tonight could not have come in any other
[47:34] age but this age
[47:36] we look back the people that are caught
[47:38] in previous seasons like the lutherans
[47:40] and they're the baptists and they're the
[47:41] nephites
[47:42] and and we sit and we think of them and
[47:45] and in some way look down upon them not
[47:47] really they're caught in the season of
[47:50] another age
[47:51] but their message was good in its season
[47:55] but and we believe that message but we
[47:57] have that plus
[47:59] because the life has moved on and now
[48:02] it's here in the great seed age
[48:04] not even the shock the seed age
[48:07] this is the season of it the ripening
[48:09] age
[48:10] what does that mean
[48:12] that this message arrived
[48:14] in just the right time
[48:16] this was the season
[48:18] for this particular message
[48:20] listen to brother adam for a minute
[48:23] he said let's think of a tree
[48:25] the fall of the year when the autumn
[48:27] time is now we take a leaf i love this
[48:32] you know something about brother brandon
[48:33] the way he talks brother
[48:35] he said
[48:36] let's take a life
[48:38] and here we are if we're born again
[48:40] listen to this we are a leaf off of the
[48:43] tree of life
[48:44] so you think of the natural tree out
[48:46] here i'm not real smart with trees you
[48:48] recognize a few of them i love trees but
[48:51] i i can recognize a few of them
[48:53] saw a tree the other day in clemson
[48:55] south carolina asking elderly man there
[48:57] how long you lived he told me so what
[48:58] kind of dream we talked about that
[48:59] particular tree for probably 50 or 20
[49:01] minutes just a tree
[49:03] it's incredible to watch god that
[49:06] expresses himself in his nature
[49:09] but brother madam said if we're born
[49:11] again if we're born again
[49:13] we are a leaf on the tree of life
[49:17] now watch and if this tree that we see
[49:19] here in the woods the light finally
[49:21] leaves it pulls away
[49:23] from the leaf because the season is over
[49:26] for the leaf
[49:27] watch it the season is over for the leaf
[49:31] he said then the light leaves the leaf
[49:33] then the leak will drop off and when the
[49:35] light leaves it now we're all real sure
[49:38] that as we look out our windows now that
[49:40] soon as the light leaves the leaf the
[49:42] leaf will drop off and that's the body
[49:45] that we bury
[49:47] now he's calling your body a leaf on the
[49:50] tree of life and what happens when the
[49:53] light leaves you the body drops back in
[49:55] the earth and your light goes down in
[49:57] the root in other words it goes back
[49:58] where it came from
[50:03] then the problem said but the life that
[50:05] was in that leaf goes back where it come
[50:06] from down to the tree into the root and
[50:08] there it remains in the root watch this
[50:11] until another season
[50:13] hey death ain't the end of it
[50:16] the grave is not our end
[50:18] the grave is just a season
[50:21] and when you leave this body glory to
[50:23] god there's a body already waiting on
[50:25] you
[50:26] you step death death christians don't
[50:29] die we just change dwelling places
[50:33] and we go to another body waiting for
[50:35] the season of the earth to change now
[50:38] watch what happens then the prophet says
[50:40] now the sun
[50:42] rocked away from the earth it's falling
[50:45] to orbit as it goes around its way
[50:47] around the cold weather is headed for
[50:48] the earth therefore the root holds the
[50:50] life of the leaf until the earth rocks
[50:52] back around again there's no way to ever
[50:55] hide that leaf from coming back again
[50:56] it'll come back as sure as the sun comes
[50:58] back it'll come back but it has to wait
[51:01] for another season before it comes back
[51:04] and today that gives a
[51:07] great testimony there's a witness of god
[51:09] of creation because
[51:10] that when we are in the season notice
[51:13] this now of mortal life
[51:17] raising children
[51:19] marrying
[51:20] bringing forth families
[51:24] there's a life or the season of mortal
[51:27] life that's what this is but when we
[51:29] have been born from above
[51:30] the body returns back that's where it
[51:32] comes from the spirit goes where it come
[51:34] from or goes up rather where it comes
[51:35] from to god who gave it and there will
[51:38] come another season
[51:41] and that season will come
[51:43] that will come will be what brother
[51:45] being called the immortal season
[51:48] when the son of god rises with healing
[51:50] in his wings
[51:52] it'll be totally impossible to hold
[51:54] these bodies in the ground any longer
[51:57] they'll come forth in the brightness of
[51:58] the son of god and very nature itself
[52:01] testifies to that
[52:03] there's some of you got loved ones
[52:05] laying out here in the grave tonight but
[52:07] there's coming another season
[52:09] one of these glorious mornings they'll
[52:10] come out at ground and god will pick up
[52:13] that leaf let me taste them and he'll
[52:14] change it never to die again
[52:18] given in not only an immortal life but
[52:20] now he'll give it a body that's
[52:22] commended with the light that he's
[52:24] already already got in other words he'll
[52:26] give a body that not just the soul let
[52:28] me tell some folk your soul is just as
[52:30] immortal as it ever will be when you
[52:32] receive the holy ghost and when you
[52:34] leave here you're still immortal but
[52:36] when that resurrection comes there'll
[52:38] come a body up that will match the
[52:40] condition that your soul right now is
[52:43] already in
[52:44] i might as well say your soul is in a
[52:47] season of immortal life
[52:49] we're just waiting on this body to catch
[52:51] up for that same season and it will
[52:54] in god's time
[52:57] now he says so if we're a christian
[53:00] we're born of the spirit
[53:02] death can hold nothing for us but
[53:05] victory
[53:07] he said because this old corruptible
[53:09] body that satan still has power
[53:12] will drop into the dust of the earth
[53:13] somebody told me the day said somebody
[53:15] said if your bride
[53:17] you don't catch covet
[53:19] i said that's so stupid
[53:21] that don't even make a lick of sense
[53:23] if that's the case but none of us should
[53:25] ever get sick
[53:27] brother babe didn't teach in the bible
[53:28] don't teach divine health
[53:31] it teaches divine healing
[53:33] these bodies are subject to sicknesses
[53:35] that's right sicknesses come and
[53:37] sicknesses will go one day a sickness
[53:40] will come and we'll go with it
[53:43] then mortal season will be over but that
[53:46] ain't the end of it
[53:48] this is the wrong season now brother of
[53:50] him says this is mortal season but in
[53:53] mortal season it's coming
[53:55] when the immortal one comes
[53:57] he will bring with him the immortal
[53:58] spirits that return to him from the
[54:00] earth
[54:01] and they will come forth again in the
[54:03] resurrection for the great millennium
[54:06] and shine in his glory listen and the
[54:08] bible tells in the philippines
[54:10] will receive a body
[54:12] like unto his own glorious body
[54:14] in that wonderful bride and groom in the
[54:17] millennium all living and glorified but
[54:19] no wonder satan is bound for a thousand
[54:22] years ain't got nobody to work through
[54:25] not bound by log chain he's bound by a
[54:28] chain of circumstance
[54:31] now this brings me tonight
[54:34] to my thought
[54:36] i want you to imagine being there for a
[54:38] minute
[54:39] i kind of caught the picture in my mind
[54:41] as
[54:42] brother branham describes it literally
[54:44] thousands
[54:45] so many gathered on this porch so many
[54:48] gathered on this porch so many gathered
[54:50] on this porch so many on this porch and
[54:52] so many and as you're still in that
[54:53] porch and looked out over that water
[54:55] body of water all you would see was
[54:58] thousands of sick full infinite folk
[55:00] laying waiting
[55:02] on this season
[55:03] where an angel would come down and stir
[55:06] the water and just hopefully they could
[55:09] get in there for somebody else and it
[55:11] didn't matter what the knee does now
[55:13] some people think it's that superstition
[55:14] but it's not
[55:16] god ain't superstitious
[55:19] god is a reality
[55:21] he is supernatural
[55:23] so the angel come down at a certain
[55:26] season brother bannon today i read him
[55:27] again he said that it would come like
[55:29] maybe a month this is what's amazing is
[55:31] nobody could know when it was going to
[55:33] happen
[55:34] do you realize we could have service
[55:36] after this is one reason that i'm not
[55:38] into all this stuff of trying to
[55:40] manufacture services to run a certain
[55:42] way
[55:43] you're getting this thing where you
[55:44] think everybody's got to shout every
[55:45] service and then when it don't happen
[55:47] look you understand god's a god of
[55:48] variety
[55:50] every service don't have to be shouting
[55:52] sometimes we have servants on wednesday
[55:54] night they shout a bit i sit there and
[55:56] teach the word of god they pray soundly
[55:58] walk out it's just as powerful at that
[56:00] moment it was if somebody was shouting
[56:03] if somebody that y'all god moves
[56:05] different ways it's it's in his seasons
[56:07] the way he wants to do it and it's just
[56:09] as powerful one way as it is another way
[56:11] and the reason i stand on that is
[56:13] because i don't ever want to get to the
[56:14] place that i try to manufacture the
[56:16] moving of the holy ghost
[56:20] y'all hear me say man
[56:22] i don't want to manufacture nothing i
[56:24] just want to wait
[56:25] like you could have a service you know
[56:28] brother man said we don't know if he
[56:30] come but we'll wait on him
[56:32] we don't know but we wait on him that's
[56:34] all in god's sovereignty
[56:37] everything's controlled by him you and i
[56:39] don't tell him what to do
[56:42] so they would sit there and he'd wait
[56:44] and maybe that water brother said start
[56:46] churning
[56:47] you know it's amazing he also said when
[56:49] that water turned it was a dangerous
[56:51] time
[56:52] troubling brother man said dangerous
[56:54] time
[56:56] this is what he also said amazing this
[56:58] is brother branham he said they also
[56:59] said brother in quotes history that some
[57:02] people want to get in there so bad they
[57:04] take a knife and stab another person so
[57:06] they could get in
[57:10] i said man that's desperate
[57:13] that's why i pack a gun i don't know how
[57:15] crazy people are around these churches
[57:16] anymore
[57:18] my deacons pack guns
[57:20] these people are crazy nowadays but you
[57:23] imagine stabbing somebody they're
[57:25] already sick you just made them worse so
[57:28] you could beat them in the water
[57:30] that thicket says one thing
[57:32] anticipation desire to be healed i don't
[57:35] say stab each other but i wouldn't be
[57:37] good brother if we could actually see
[57:39] people beat other people to church
[57:42] that people at our church
[57:44] got upset not long ago y'all know it's
[57:46] true
[57:47] i tell them i don't care somebody said
[57:49] well that's my seat
[57:51] i said well you know i don't i'm not
[57:54] sure but that too right there i don't
[57:55] believe ever been judged about
[57:56] sanctified or baptized with the holy
[57:58] ghost that seat ain't saved
[58:03] so if you come early and you want a
[58:05] certain spot get it when that person
[58:07] arrives and said hey that seat say say
[58:08] well glory god's oh my
[58:12] no such thing as if you want to see get
[58:14] there first
[58:16] wouldn't it be good to see that kind of
[58:17] anticipation i got to get down there and
[58:20] maybe the church is not completely full
[58:22] but you still want to
[58:23] find that particular it'd be good if
[58:25] folk would fight to get in the front row
[58:32] yeah if you were sick and you was around
[58:34] that pool i promise you you fought to
[58:36] get the head to that porch
[58:38] my wife was listening to tape the other
[58:39] day it was shocking about the balcony
[58:42] nobody's up there tonight but you know i
[58:44] don't know exactly if i can remember it
[58:46] right but brother man literally said
[58:47] this he said it's good for your sick
[58:49] vote to get down here close
[58:52] to the pulpit get out of here in the
[58:53] front he said very rarely does the holy
[58:56] spirit ever leave me and go up into the
[58:58] balcony
[59:00] that's what he said
[59:01] that he said sister lisa where are they
[59:04] ever get up here in the balcony
[59:05] but you get down here in other words get
[59:08] under the sprout where the glory's
[59:10] pouring out
[59:11] get close to it so it didn't make a
[59:12] difference and why did them people come
[59:14] in that prayer line and when they got
[59:15] close to the end he said now you feel
[59:17] that
[59:18] you sense his presence in other words
[59:20] you want to get us young people you want
[59:21] to get as close to god as you can
[59:24] good spot to be sitting right there not
[59:26] way back in the corner where you can
[59:28] pull your phone out and check it while
[59:29] the man that god's preaching no you get
[59:31] up front
[59:32] have your bible i don't know i can not
[59:34] see people tap their bibles anymore well
[59:36] that's that's god's word
[59:38] this is the part of your you know your
[59:40] this is your schooling you bring this
[59:42] book when you come to church this is
[59:43] god's word pack it with
[59:48] some people leave their bibles
[59:49] only to save their seats
[59:52] boy and lose the holy spirit when
[59:54] somebody moves their bible
[59:57] save seeds
[59:59] well i can promise you
[1:00:01] they wanted to get as close as they
[1:00:02] could to that water i would have
[1:00:04] if i'd been sick i'd want to get right
[1:00:07] up there close and keep my eye and don't
[1:00:09] you do you see something moving
[1:00:11] and when i've seen that water stern
[1:00:14] brother i do my best to get in there to
[1:00:16] let that virtue let me just say it when
[1:00:18] you see the holy ghost moving that's the
[1:00:20] time to get in
[1:00:22] when you see the word of god going out
[1:00:24] the man of god preaching that's a good
[1:00:25] time to say amen to the word of god
[1:00:28] when you feel the sin in the soul
[1:00:33] comes beside that's a good time lift
[1:00:35] your head say
[1:00:37] praise the lord tell them like a bunch
[1:00:39] of robots
[1:00:41] no it should be spontaneous
[1:00:43] it should be in your heart
[1:00:45] the music is really the bible team it
[1:00:47] feeds and i gotta heard but in ephesians
[1:00:49] five you read it it said it didn't say
[1:00:51] the piano said in your heart making
[1:00:53] melody to the lord
[1:00:56] worship isn't here
[1:00:58] so brother man
[1:01:01] literally thousands when you look out
[1:01:03] there you see this great
[1:01:05] gulf of humanity here's the amazing
[1:01:08] thing
[1:01:09] everybody there
[1:01:11] is in need
[1:01:14] talk to his lord
[1:01:16] everybody there
[1:01:18] you ever come to the house
[1:01:19] well i don't really need nothing from
[1:01:21] god
[1:01:22] you ever think that way you're in
[1:01:24] trouble
[1:01:25] every time i come lord i need to get
[1:01:27] closer to you
[1:01:29] i need you to crawl me closer if you've
[1:01:30] got to use the man of god you know as i
[1:01:33] was thinking today you got a mirror and
[1:01:35] you got a magnifying glass christians do
[1:01:38] not carry magnifying glasses you carry
[1:01:41] mirrors
[1:01:42] and the mirror is to show you yourself
[1:01:46] that bible's a mirror
[1:01:48] people that carry magnifying glass is
[1:01:50] only trying to check out everybody
[1:01:51] else's problems
[1:01:53] but we're here to check out your problem
[1:01:55] here to check out my problem
[1:01:57] and the thing is everybody that was at
[1:01:58] that pool all of them had problems
[1:02:02] let's say that again all of them
[1:02:05] now you might be a little secretive and
[1:02:07] might be a little introvert and you
[1:02:09] don't want nobody know your problems
[1:02:11] we know humanity long enough we all got
[1:02:14] problems
[1:02:16] one way or another great multitude now
[1:02:20] here's what i found out
[1:02:22] brother branham believed and i believe
[1:02:24] and jesus believed and the bible teaches
[1:02:26] that a literal angel came down
[1:02:30] there are men today that want to remove
[1:02:32] the supernatural so much from the church
[1:02:35] that they don't even believe that the
[1:02:37] story of john 5
[1:02:39] is literal
[1:02:40] they believe is an analogy
[1:02:43] a metaphor or some allegory
[1:02:46] they have trouble believing that an
[1:02:48] angel could come down oh
[1:02:51] they still got trouble today believing
[1:02:53] an angel could come down
[1:02:55] but he did
[1:03:00] something about angels read my bible
[1:03:02] every one of you tonight you young
[1:03:04] people you old people like every one of
[1:03:06] you you know you've got an angel that
[1:03:09] stands and beholds the face of the
[1:03:11] father that represents you
[1:03:15] do you know tonight if you got the holy
[1:03:17] spirit you literally possess a portion
[1:03:20] of the angelic beings that rotated off
[1:03:22] that pillar of fire that resisted
[1:03:24] satan's lie in the beginning
[1:03:28] brother man said it let me let angels
[1:03:31] just satan deceive a third of the anger
[1:03:33] but there was elect angels that wouldn't
[1:03:35] believe his lie in heaven
[1:03:36] and there's elect church that won't
[1:03:38] believe his eye today because we got a
[1:03:40] portion of that same spirit that
[1:03:41] resisted that lie
[1:03:44] there's a bride here that cannot be
[1:03:46] deceived
[1:03:47] we got a holy spirit we're sealed our
[1:03:49] names as in the last book of life and
[1:03:51] all these tales that satan is telling
[1:03:54] not not the t-a-i-l the t-a-l-e the lie
[1:03:57] that he told
[1:03:58] there was a bride sealed him with christ
[1:04:01] we know his voice
[1:04:04] we came to the sea by the tail that he
[1:04:06] told because we're a part of the head
[1:04:08] the ancient honorable here is the head
[1:04:09] the prophet that teach the lies he is
[1:04:11] the tale
[1:04:12] we got a true prophet we got the truth
[1:04:14] we're identified with the angel of the
[1:04:16] lord
[1:04:18] he come down
[1:04:20] there's angels involved here
[1:04:22] and angels are involved in the affairs
[1:04:24] of men
[1:04:25] until hebrews tells us that they're
[1:04:27] literally sending the earth to be
[1:04:29] ministering spirits to those that would
[1:04:31] be our salvation
[1:04:33] we have a cloud
[1:04:35] that they're against today seven angels
[1:04:38] that make up the face of christ
[1:04:41] literally they made his wig seven angels
[1:04:43] that accompanied this prophetic ministry
[1:04:46] the opening of the seven seals
[1:04:49] angels came to abraham
[1:04:51] angels came to gideon angel came to
[1:04:53] joshua angels were present at jesus's
[1:04:55] birth
[1:04:57] angels coming this day angels even
[1:04:59] rejoice over one sinner
[1:05:04] amen one center that finds their way
[1:05:07] back to god
[1:05:09] angels there was a literal angel
[1:05:12] there was literal water
[1:05:15] the water was troubled the waters were
[1:05:17] moved
[1:05:18] there was a pool
[1:05:21] and that pool of water
[1:05:23] was troubled when the angel come down
[1:05:26] and if you could get in that water now
[1:05:28] watch where i'm going if you could get
[1:05:29] in that water
[1:05:31] when the angel stirred the water
[1:05:34] you were made whole of whatever your
[1:05:36] condition was
[1:05:38] and if you didn't get in there you
[1:05:40] stayed in your condition
[1:05:44] god has a season
[1:05:47] that he troubles us
[1:05:50] why does he trouble us is he against us
[1:05:52] no
[1:05:53] he loves us
[1:05:56] and sometimes god has to trouble us
[1:05:59] so much that brother madam said god
[1:06:02] loves you so much that he'll put you on
[1:06:05] your back to get you to look up
[1:06:11] sometimes people don't retain god in her
[1:06:14] knowledge and don't mean they mean not

[1:06:39] the love of god pray and read your bible
[1:06:41] every day
[1:06:44] i don't want to offend you but you know
[1:06:45] what brother bam's quote book was
[1:06:48] the bible
[1:06:50] this was brother branham's quote book
[1:06:53] 66 books of the bible
[1:06:55] that's what this prophet preached out of
[1:06:57] this message ain't contrary to this
[1:06:59] bible
[1:07:01] this bible is the word of god
[1:07:04] you young people you get in this bible
[1:07:06] you young men read it every day pray
[1:07:09] you watch as soon as you say i'm going
[1:07:11] to pray and read my bible every day
[1:07:13] watch satan start sending things that
[1:07:14] try to preoccupy you
[1:07:17] you'll get more texts than you ever got
[1:07:19] people like your facebook post
[1:07:21] you know people live for that
[1:07:25] say so and so
[1:07:26] got saved you get one or two likes
[1:07:30] somebody dress a certain way that they
[1:07:32] shouldn't be and everybody god's green
[1:07:35] earth knows about it
[1:07:38] satan likes that
[1:07:40] all that negative stuff what you do
[1:07:42] young people i'm not on facebook
[1:07:45] what you do is get out of facebook
[1:07:47] and get your face
[1:07:48] in this book
[1:07:52] get as close
[1:07:54] to the water the moving of it as you can
[1:07:58] amen
[1:07:59] do you know god sent an angel
[1:08:02] among the waters of humanity in this day
[1:08:04] read what a prophet of god said he said
[1:08:06] waters represent multitudes of people
[1:08:08] he said an angel down in this day and
[1:08:11] troubled the denomination waters
[1:08:15] a heavenly angel that descended to an
[1:08:17] earthly angel
[1:08:20] and his message troubled
[1:08:23] the systems
[1:08:26] troubled it so much
[1:08:30] that they
[1:08:31] didn't like the trouble that it sent to
[1:08:33] it and finally ousted the angle out
[1:08:38] it was too troubling for me but then
[1:08:42] every now and then there'd be one that
[1:08:44] would get in
[1:08:45] one that would get in
[1:08:47] one that would get in and what god do he
[1:08:49] was calling them out of it
[1:08:51] but troubling it
[1:08:55] that water
[1:08:57] could have been used for all kinds of
[1:08:58] things
[1:09:00] but it was just water
[1:09:02] why would god trouble it brother bam
[1:09:03] said he likes to see
[1:09:06] the reaction of our faith
[1:09:08] let's look at three things quickly
[1:09:11] number one
[1:09:13] whosoever
[1:09:14] got in was healed of whatsoever
[1:09:18] this speaks to us something about
[1:09:21] salvation
[1:09:23] let me explain to you
[1:09:25] first of all the bible teaches in
[1:09:27] hebrews 2 9 that jesus by the grace of
[1:09:30] god tasted death for every man
[1:09:36] he died for all
[1:09:38] humanity
[1:09:40] let me tell you something there's some
[1:09:41] people sitting around that water of
[1:09:43] humanity that you look at them and think
[1:09:44] there's no way
[1:09:48] no way god could save them there's a boy
[1:09:51] worked on i guess y'all won't get
[1:09:52] offended i ride a motorcycle
[1:09:55] harley i like i like motorcycles like
[1:09:58] them so much i got two of them
[1:09:59] i ride them and i still got the holy
[1:10:01] ghost and i ride a motorcycle
[1:10:04] and every now and i take the mountain to
[1:10:05] this old
[1:10:06] vet
[1:10:07] vietnam vet
[1:10:08] his son's got earrings
[1:10:11] big holes
[1:10:12] weird-looking holes
[1:10:14] and i could just see the devil wrapping
[1:10:16] that chain and leading him around
[1:10:19] big holes in his ears one day i
[1:10:23] you know do everything he can
[1:10:24] and i in my motorcycle i had one of them
[1:10:27] cds that you just asked me about was
[1:10:28] laying in the back of my motorcycle
[1:10:31] anything about it took my motorcycle
[1:10:32] down there and
[1:10:34] in
[1:10:35] months past maybe several years passed
[1:10:37] i was going down the highway 11 there
[1:10:39] coming out of
[1:10:40] walhalla south carolina there was a tent
[1:10:42] set up every time i see a t i like it so
[1:10:45] i just pulled in
[1:10:46] when i pulled in they were setting up
[1:10:47] chairs getting ready for service at
[1:10:48] night and i walked in just kind of sat
[1:10:50] down was kind of looking around the tent
[1:10:52] this fella comes up to hey luke
[1:10:56] i looked at him
[1:10:58] you know me yeah
[1:10:59] you don't know me
[1:11:02] i said no i don't i don't know you who
[1:11:04] are you
[1:11:05] he said i'm the one he said well first
[1:11:07] of all let me tell you this i need to
[1:11:09] ask your forgiveness
[1:11:11] i said sir i don't even know you there's
[1:11:14] no way you could done he said yeah i
[1:11:16] stole something out of your motorcycle
[1:11:17] when i was working on it
[1:11:19] i said no you can't be him
[1:11:22] and this guy
[1:11:24] changed and honestly i didn't think
[1:11:27] in my mind i just thought no way for
[1:11:30] this dude man he's too far gone tattooed
[1:11:32] up earrings hanging out
[1:11:34] smoking one cigarette after another and
[1:11:36] just never knows good at nice people
[1:11:38] just never know just a ungodly
[1:11:40] atmosphere and
[1:11:42] i never said much to him but he knew as
[1:11:43] a preacher my sons would go up here take
[1:11:45] their motorcycles he told me he said i
[1:11:47] stole that cd out of your
[1:11:50] motorcycle
[1:11:51] and i listened to it over and over and
[1:11:53] over he said god started dealing with me
[1:11:57] he said i went down there to church and
[1:11:59] he said i got saved i said man i can
[1:12:02] tell something's different about you
[1:12:04] i wanted to say you mean he really could
[1:12:06] save you
[1:12:09] but he saved him and he said i want to
[1:12:10] tell you this
[1:12:12] your boys came up here to that
[1:12:15] motorcycle shop and i watched them voice
[1:12:17] and they were different and every time
[1:12:19] i'd see them and watch them or something
[1:12:21] me one craved wish i could be like them
[1:12:25] i said if you met the same god they did
[1:12:27] then all you gotta do is be like him but
[1:12:30] it just shows god can save anybody
[1:12:33] wasn't on my time had to be on god's
[1:12:35] time
[1:12:37] he was different
[1:12:39] brother no man no man comes in young
[1:12:41] people nobody ever comes in contact with
[1:12:44] christ but what they leave different
[1:12:46] than what they came
[1:12:48] so he said he takes death for how many
[1:12:51] men every man
[1:12:53] it changed my perception that don't
[1:12:56] judge people
[1:12:58] no don't put them out right
[1:13:00] yeah but i've been raising so was i
[1:13:03] i was born in the hospital on tuesday
[1:13:06] and by sunday i was under a tent
[1:13:09] in a little
[1:13:11] carriage my mom a pentecostal lady took
[1:13:13] me straight to church
[1:13:15] been in church my whole life
[1:13:18] never did a lot of things that they did
[1:13:20] out here you know as far as
[1:13:23] the ungodly things
[1:13:26] but i was just as much as a sinner as
[1:13:28] everybody else
[1:13:29] because i found out you don't have to
[1:13:31] sin to be a sinner
[1:13:33] you sin because you're already a sinner
[1:13:36] you come in the world how the matter of
[1:13:39] fact you was conceived in sin
[1:13:41] when you come out you come out as a cute
[1:13:43] little baby with two horns on your head
[1:13:48] you've got a nature that came from
[1:13:50] health
[1:13:54] yeah but i've never cut my you i don't
[1:13:55] care if you live by your mom and daddy's
[1:13:57] conviction you got a nature from hell
[1:14:02] i told my boy didn't that decorate
[1:14:04] i said if you told all michael saw six
[1:14:06] of them and now my daughter's different
[1:14:10] they're lucky she didn't come first
[1:14:12] because none of them probably would have
[1:14:14] been here
[1:14:16] that's a joke you can laugh
[1:14:19] six sons i said you live in my house
[1:14:22] you're going to borrow my conviction
[1:14:23] until you get your own
[1:14:26] in other words you're going to live by
[1:14:27] my standards in my house the day you
[1:14:28] don't like my standards you get out go
[1:14:30] live make your own standards i never had
[1:14:33] that problem all good boys can't i can't
[1:14:36] complain god's been good but my point
[1:14:38] was this
[1:14:40] you have to borrow mine because you're
[1:14:42] in a fallen tradition
[1:14:44] that's cause they come out of my seed
[1:14:46] through mama's agony born into a message
[1:14:48] home that's we all we did was born
[1:14:51] sinners into our message home
[1:14:55] they don't come out of marvel's womb
[1:14:56] christians
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:58] just because i dedicated them to christ
[1:15:00] i dedicated him but they're not
[1:15:02] dedicated yet
[1:15:05] they've got to meet christ
[1:15:08] preach with me now they got to know
[1:15:09] christ
[1:15:11] god somewhere in their life has to
[1:15:13] trouble them the way he troubled you
[1:15:17] i'm just gonna say it nobody ever
[1:15:19] repents but what god troubles them
[1:15:27] and here's what i found out
[1:15:29] them boys you've never smoked
[1:15:32] you better not
[1:15:35] you've never drank
[1:15:36] nope still a virgin yep
[1:15:39] ever kissed a girl glory to god
[1:15:43] keep away from as long as possible
[1:15:46] once you start it's over
[1:15:50] come on now it's good they come to order
[1:15:53] the virgins
[1:15:54] that's wonderful our girls and boys
[1:15:56] should be
[1:16:00] but just because they're clean morally
[1:16:02] don't mean they're saved
[1:16:04] they still got a nature that's upheld
[1:16:07] you say well one day we'll get them no
[1:16:09] you ain't going to get them right
[1:16:10] you don't reform young people that
[1:16:12] nature has got to die and it's got to
[1:16:14] rot
[1:16:15] and they got to be born again
[1:16:18] and they've got to be born to get into
[1:16:20] the same three elements that they were
[1:16:21] born naturally water blood and spirit
[1:16:24] come on now
[1:16:26] justification of the holy ghost
[1:16:29] not better again not good again
[1:16:32] born again
[1:16:35] for that to happen
[1:16:37] trouble's got to start for him to be
[1:16:38] born the first time trouble started
[1:16:41] i remember i heard it
[1:16:43] trouble started mama went in the labor
[1:16:45] pains trouble started
[1:16:49] woman in tribal remember jesus talked
[1:16:50] about john 16 travail
[1:16:53] trouble starts natural birth happens
[1:16:56] trouble starts spiritual birth happens
[1:16:58] god has to trouble you
[1:17:00] young person he will trouble you
[1:17:03] individually
[1:17:04] he'll come one day to your life and god
[1:17:07] will trouble it and there ain't but one
[1:17:09] answer and that is to repent
[1:17:12] you've got to repent is that right and
[1:17:15] god troubles the water you got to get in
[1:17:16] and only get in is repent
[1:17:20] but just watch this
[1:17:21] why does god do that why does sometimes
[1:17:24] god linger like you know some of us
[1:17:26] become quick we see a condition in the
[1:17:28] world it's terrible i mean honestly i've
[1:17:30] never seen the earth
[1:17:32] as bad as shape that is in now morally
[1:17:35] god keeps lingering long suffering why
[1:17:38] not willing that any man should perish
[1:17:41] but that all would come to repentance
[1:17:43] that's god's desire
[1:17:45] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:17:47] his only god son that
[1:17:49] whosoever
[1:17:52] that means anybody
[1:17:56] but the problem is
[1:17:58] anybody can come
[1:18:01] but only when god
[1:18:03] calls
[1:18:05] several years ago
[1:18:07] that's where this message come from from
[1:18:09] let me tell you right now it's where i'm
[1:18:10] preaching his message from
[1:18:11] it came back in 2017

[1:18:53] i said that kid can't even make a glass
[1:18:54] of water without asking you to do it
[1:18:56] and that wasn't a joke that was true
[1:18:58] and i said no that'll be gone two weeks
[1:19:01] and i ironed that boy's clothes for two
[1:19:02] weeks
[1:19:04] she said i'll teach him to iron
[1:19:06] i said well go ask him and honestly when
[1:19:08] she left the room i think the lord jesus
[1:19:10] let that boy say no that's 2800 dollars
[1:19:14] she'd come back in a few minutes she
[1:19:15] said he said he'll go
[1:19:17] i said mommy you better teach him to
[1:19:18] iron

[1:19:28] got that first night stayed in
[1:19:30] johannesburg next day we flew over to
[1:19:32] port elizabeth i was going to preach
[1:19:33] that night have my message all ready
[1:19:35] prepared went into the back office
[1:19:38] sitting there and the message i was
[1:19:39] going to put you
[1:19:42] gone
[1:19:43] and i you know how it is
[1:19:45] i'm already nervous but then i got real
[1:19:47] nervous
[1:19:48] you know how this man don't want to walk
[1:19:49] out here he must feel like he's got
[1:19:51] something to control at least what he's
[1:19:53] going to go what he's going to say and i
[1:19:54] got down on the pastor's study there and
[1:19:56] i started praying i said god you got to
[1:19:58] help me
[1:19:59] i mean i don't like to go to pool
[1:20:00] without something burning on me because
[1:20:01] i believe unction the pulpit brings
[1:20:03] action in the pews
[1:20:05] the lord you got to help me and honest
[1:20:07] to god before god lie not something
[1:20:09] spoke to me and said open to john 5 and
[1:20:11] that's where i got this message and i
[1:20:12] opened the john 5 there and something
[1:20:14] said to me and i just wrote it down what
[1:20:15] not in my voice or something in my heart
[1:20:17] i believe whosoever can come but not
[1:20:20] whensoever only when god calls
[1:20:22] and i went out that night and i preached
[1:20:24] on the sovereignty of god in salvation
[1:20:27] that god must call you
[1:20:30] i preached it on there about 30 45
[1:20:33] minutes and i heard somebody weeping
[1:20:35] about four or five rows back sitting
[1:20:38] where that boy in the blue shirt is
[1:20:39] jeremiah was sitting there saying oh boy
[1:20:41] weeping bawling and crying i thought
[1:20:44] what in the world is going on son you
[1:20:46] could have did this for the last 17
[1:20:48] years in
[1:20:48] south carolina
[1:20:50] you coming to south africa for god to
[1:20:52] deal with you
[1:20:53] that's where in my mind
[1:20:55] and be honest he's the only one
[1:20:57] responding
[1:20:58] he's weeping and crying and i get to
[1:21:00] them my message i said is there anybody
[1:21:02] here that would like to give their is
[1:21:04] god troubling you is anybody here
[1:21:06] wanting and his hands went up
[1:21:10] what in the world
[1:21:11] and so i just closed the service out we
[1:21:13] went back to the little apartment we
[1:21:14] stayed in i went in the living room i
[1:21:16] had a cover and i covered over my head
[1:21:18] at the couch and i started praying
[1:21:19] thanking the lord for the service and
[1:21:20] those things and i felt somebody come in
[1:21:22] and sat down it was jeremiah i told him
[1:21:24] i said what's wrong sonny's tears coming
[1:21:26] down his face he said daddy tonight i
[1:21:28] gave my heart to the lord jesus christ
[1:21:37] i said if i would have said i got a
[1:21:39] million dollars i'm gonna donate five
[1:21:40] hundred thousand to church all y'all
[1:21:41] lord i got
[1:21:45] tells you somebody got saved
[1:21:52] i'd be happy somebody got saved
[1:21:56] rejoicing over one sinner that repents
[1:22:00] so i said jeremiah you've heard that he
[1:22:02] preached for 17 years you know what
[1:22:04] you've got to do when we get home what's
[1:22:06] gonna he said home i said yeah you gotta
[1:22:08] get next thing is me what he said
[1:22:09] baptized i said when we get said daddy i
[1:22:11] can't wait till i get home i got to be
[1:22:13] baptized now
[1:22:15] that's how you knew something happened
[1:22:17] trump he was troubled and he pretended
[1:22:19] what's the next thing that when that
[1:22:21] when god drove the water you had to get
[1:22:22] in the water so when god traveled he
[1:22:24] says i got to get in the water you're
[1:22:25] going to baptize me
[1:22:27] i baptize in the name of the lord jesus
[1:22:29] christ these this boy these people tell
[1:22:31] you god radically changed that voice
[1:22:36] he met christ and he met him for himself
[1:22:43] god troubles your water
[1:22:45] the only thing you can do is repent
[1:22:49] next thing you do is get in the water
[1:22:51] let this man of god baptize you in the
[1:22:53] name of the lord jesus christ and when
[1:22:55] you come out of that water the holy
[1:22:57] ghost will come in and fill you with the
[1:22:58] holy ghost and he'll heal you whatsoever
[1:23:01] your need is
[1:23:03] he'll take a sin-sick soul and make a
[1:23:06] son and daughter god out of it
[1:23:08] come on now is that right
[1:23:10] take a girl's ill-famed that people
[1:23:11] thinks well if she wears them certainly
[1:23:13] this and she does that just get it to
[1:23:15] christ
[1:23:18] we're happy they come to church
[1:23:20] when she's cut her hair
[1:23:22] well i wonder if she's dressing what's
[1:23:24] it make a difference she's just being a
[1:23:26] sinner
[1:23:27] sinners do what sinners do
[1:23:29] pigs go to the wall
[1:23:32] that's their nature don't need to change
[1:23:34] our outward appearance we need to get
[1:23:36] into christ
[1:23:37] and you get into christ he'll take care
[1:23:39] of the outside
[1:23:40] we want to get the outside right and the
[1:23:42] inside ain't right get the inside right
[1:23:44] and then outside the tree will bear the
[1:23:46] fruit of the light that's on the outside
[1:23:50] god trouble us if somebody's not right
[1:23:53] with god we pray god travel them
[1:23:56] don't let them sleep trouble
[1:23:59] like that girl said when they come to
[1:24:00] jesus i've been troubled in my dreams
[1:24:02] over this man
[1:24:04] not trouble them
[1:24:05] trouble them trouble them trouble their
[1:24:07] life
[1:24:08] until they look here and they look there
[1:24:09] and they can't find they can't find it
[1:24:11] but
[1:24:12] there's a thirst there got trouble until
[1:24:14] they realize what they need is christ
[1:24:21] still with me
[1:24:22] no man can come said the bible
[1:24:25] except
[1:24:26] the father would send me draw him
[1:24:28] like a magnet god has to draw you
[1:24:32] he said when he comes god draws he'll
[1:24:34] come
[1:24:35] but that trouble can only be at a
[1:24:37] certain season now let me hurry
[1:24:39] what time does that clock say
[1:24:41] anybody see that i'm getting too old
[1:24:46] i just turned 52 the other day
[1:24:48] praise the lord
[1:24:51] somebody said
[1:24:52] 52 i said yep
[1:24:54] man you're over the hill it's a lot
[1:24:56] better than being under the hill
[1:24:59] at least i'm still over it
[1:25:04] i want you to notice he's
[1:25:06] at this pool quickly now
[1:25:07] there were five porches
[1:25:10] i don't think the bible makes mistakes
[1:25:13] there are five portraits the word veseta
[1:25:15] means the house
[1:25:17] of kindness the house of grace
[1:25:20] all them people in that condition
[1:25:21] horrible conditions
[1:25:22] had not yet met christ
[1:25:24] hadn't gotten the water yet
[1:25:26] but yet while they were still in there
[1:25:28] let me just sit like this while you were
[1:25:29] still a sinner
[1:25:32] god had you in grace
[1:25:35] there were five porches five is grace
[1:25:38] they hung around there when you was a
[1:25:40] sinner
[1:25:41] god was watching over you
[1:25:44] he don't let you go so far you know how
[1:25:46] many times satan would have snuffed you
[1:25:48] out
[1:25:49] but god sent an angel and protected you
[1:25:52] because he knew your hour was coming
[1:25:55] you know i ran around with a boy when i
[1:25:58] was young
[1:25:59] i ran around with a boy that stole and
[1:26:01] and i was with him and the things that
[1:26:02] he did now i'm not going to talk about
[1:26:04] them they were dark there were things in
[1:26:06] the world it shouldn't have been done
[1:26:08] and no though i may have not
[1:26:10] shoved the stuff in my pants to steal it
[1:26:12] i ate of it i was just as much a thief
[1:26:14] as he was
[1:26:16] and you know at 13 years old in a
[1:26:18] meeting one night sitting about where
[1:26:19] you are my brother the spirit of god i
[1:26:21] didn't know what was happening but
[1:26:22] something was talking in this little
[1:26:23] boy's heart
[1:26:25] and i found my way in order
[1:26:27] and i repented with godly sorrow and the
[1:26:29] bible tells ii corinthians 7 that we
[1:26:31] repent what god has saw that not to be
[1:26:33] repented of that means i never regretted
[1:26:36] the day i gave my heart to jesus ain't a
[1:26:38] person here that's gave their heart to
[1:26:40] christ but you would you you elders
[1:26:42] would tell these young people you've
[1:26:43] never regretted the day
[1:26:45] that the holy ghost called you and you
[1:26:47] turned your life to christ
[1:26:49] no regret
[1:26:54] 13 years old
[1:26:56] god dealt with me
[1:26:57] and i i i
[1:26:58] i
[1:26:59] felt i ran around with a cousin of mine
[1:27:01] we started going different paths
[1:27:05] i went toward
[1:27:06] christ and ultimately toward
[1:27:09] the ministry went full time in the
[1:27:10] ministry at 17 years old preaching in
[1:27:12] the pentecostal church
[1:27:14] and by the time he was 18
[1:27:16] he was sitting in a prison house
[1:27:19] been in the prison house to this day
[1:27:23] to this day gets out in about 2023 he
[1:27:26] called me used to call my wife
[1:27:27] collect i tell her talk to him when he
[1:27:30] calls
[1:27:30] we used to send him money and he told me
[1:27:32] one day on the phone when i was talking
[1:27:34] to him he said good to god i had parents
[1:27:36] like yours
[1:27:38] that whipped you when we did things
[1:27:39] wrong he said when we did things wrong
[1:27:41] and our parents found out you got the
[1:27:43] whooping i went home and my daddy only
[1:27:45] said boys will be boys
[1:27:48] he said my life has been spent in prison
[1:27:51] your life has been spent down there in
[1:27:53] church
[1:27:54] god
[1:27:56] brings you different ways
[1:27:59] say oh i'm not like him yes i was
[1:28:02] i was just like him but god stopped me
[1:28:06] i'd go so far and i'd feel that thing
[1:28:08] just pulled me back
[1:28:09] [Music]
[1:28:10] and going so far feeling pretty god not
[1:28:13] even born in him i just feel that thing
[1:28:14] pull me back
[1:28:16] let it go so far what was it the tender
[1:28:18] hand of god watching over your life even
[1:28:21] while you were yet sinners listen while
[1:28:24] you were exit it don't say why you dead
[1:28:26] center god died for the godly while you
[1:28:29] were yet sinners christ died for the
[1:28:31] ungodly
[1:28:35] we were sinners
[1:28:39] come out of the womb of a holy ghost
[1:28:41] woman
[1:28:42] daddy was a preacher
[1:28:44] but we were still sinners
[1:28:47] y'all still with me
[1:28:49] that's right
[1:28:50] finally one day
[1:28:52] god come to trouble my waters
[1:28:56] i've never regretted the day
[1:28:59] but he troubled me
[1:29:00] troubled me enough
[1:29:02] to make me look to him
[1:29:06] think about this titus 2 3 46
[1:29:09] the love of god our savior toward man
[1:29:11] appeared not by works of righteous we
[1:29:12] have done but according to his mercy he
[1:29:14] saved us by the washing of regeneration
[1:29:16] renewing of the holy ghost which he shed
[1:29:18] on us abundantly through our lord jesus
[1:29:21] christ and in our texture but god
[1:29:23] who is rich
[1:29:25] in mercy
[1:29:27] and i found out one day
[1:29:29] mercy is god
[1:29:30] withholding from me
[1:29:32] what i do deserve
[1:29:34] and grace is god extending to me
[1:29:37] what i don't deserve
[1:29:41] the prophet of god said say what you
[1:29:43] want to i heard a man today a lot of
[1:29:45] brides not sinners
[1:29:48] that's a lie
[1:29:49] care if you are a bride
[1:29:51] you were a sinner
[1:29:55] we're not better than them the only
[1:29:58] difference between us and those that
[1:29:59] don't know christ is the grace of god
[1:30:03] no man will grab another more don't care
[1:30:05] who he is
[1:30:07] and take him in the bottom pointed
[1:30:08] finger at him
[1:30:10] we can't condemn nobody
[1:30:12] but for the grace of god there go out
[1:30:18] now let me tell you what brother bam
[1:30:19] said i'm gonna bring this a little bit a
[1:30:20] little bit more just for a second
[1:30:22] it's too much here
[1:30:24] but he says this
[1:30:26] all that water was troubled
[1:30:29] this one would get in and all of a
[1:30:31] sudden
[1:30:32] the scripture says and there laid a man
[1:30:35] in a condition for 38 years
[1:30:38] can you imagine
[1:30:40] laying by a pool
[1:30:41] knowing that water was troubled and
[1:30:43] you're in a condition for 38 years and
[1:30:45] you get there and you're trying to work
[1:30:47] your way through the crowd and you're
[1:30:48] trying to get up as close as you can
[1:30:50] this one beat you there and all of a
[1:30:51] sudden you know what you're going to
[1:30:52] take up and another man pushes you back
[1:30:53] he jumps in
[1:30:56] and jesus comes walking let me tell you
[1:30:58] what's happening this time
[1:31:02] he don't have to get in the water
[1:31:05] the water is coming to him
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:12] the water's coming to him
[1:31:14] you see i can't do it i can't make it i
[1:31:16] can't no we can't but he can
[1:31:19] look young people you don't have to get
[1:31:20] right to get right you just come the way
[1:31:23] you are and he'll make you right
[1:31:28] i can't get in no man to help me you go
[1:31:31] back to the previous chapter chapter
[1:31:33] four water comes up again and a woman
[1:31:36] who had been
[1:31:37] had five husbands the one she lived with
[1:31:39] now wasn't her own and y'all could say
[1:31:40] what you want to
[1:31:42] you'd have a hard time believing if that
[1:31:43] woman was in this church married five
[1:31:45] times come in here at six and was
[1:31:47] looking for
[1:31:48] another one
[1:31:51] no way she could be bribed
[1:31:53] what constitutes bride
[1:31:56] past
[1:31:57] conditions
[1:31:59] no
[1:32:00] what constitutes bride is when the holy
[1:32:02] spirit comes
[1:32:06] he calls that individual
[1:32:09] hey and wipes away all their sins
[1:32:12] don't care what they've done what
[1:32:13] they've done where they've been when the
[1:32:15] grace of god comes in there they're just
[1:32:17] as clean as anybody else
[1:32:19] if a body-paired woman come here tonight
[1:32:21] if god saved her night her hair is just
[1:32:23] as long as yours that never cut it in
[1:32:25] the presence of god
[1:32:30] i just don't think we
[1:32:32] have a reality of what grace is i'm
[1:32:35] talking i'm not talking about this great
[1:32:36] i'm talking about real grace
[1:32:40] jesus come walking up there guess where
[1:32:42] he went he came over here and he sat
[1:32:44] down
[1:32:45] on a well
[1:32:48] and she came out to draw
[1:32:50] water
[1:32:52] but she was fixing to draw from a
[1:32:53] different water
[1:32:55] and it was called the water of life
[1:32:58] woman if you knew who it was talk to you
[1:33:01] he said you'd ask me for a drink and
[1:33:03] i'll give you a drink that you'll never
[1:33:05] thirst again
[1:33:06] hey he's still at water tonight
[1:33:09] i can't get in i've tried i've tried i
[1:33:11] tried yeah you tried let him take over
[1:33:14] let him take over he's come tonight
[1:33:16] maybe tonight you can't get them but the
[1:33:18] water is coming to you maybe this
[1:33:20] meeting the spirit of god's coming to
[1:33:21] you he's coming to you in this meeting
[1:33:23] all these you said this is going to be a
[1:33:25] different meeting for you god's coming
[1:33:27] to you and all you've got to do is say

[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:42] let me let me give you one more
[1:33:46] those porches represented
[1:33:48] water represents humanity
[1:33:50] and then portraits were actually god's
[1:33:52] mercy
[1:33:53] over top of the water they
[1:33:54] they they're waiting on and it didn't it
[1:33:56] kept them from drowning let me put it
[1:33:58] that way
[1:33:59] that's why brother said it could have
[1:34:01] been dangerous
[1:34:03] but then portraits were god's grace to
[1:34:04] them
[1:34:05] while you was a sinner
[1:34:07] something was watching over you
[1:34:11] somebody might have pulled a knife on
[1:34:12] you one day
[1:34:14] somebody may be determined to shoot you
[1:34:17] you don't know
[1:34:18] satan thought i'll take him out in this
[1:34:20] car wreck
[1:34:22] somehow the hand of god
[1:34:24] kept you
[1:34:25] while you was a sinner
[1:34:31] let me let me say this to you i got to
[1:34:32] go
[1:34:34] everybody there had the same problem
[1:34:37] universal problem they were all were

[1:34:43] have to i've done it i'm gonna say
[1:34:46] this maybe
[1:34:48] somebody wouldn't understand
[1:34:51] several years back about
[1:34:54] oh it had to be
[1:34:56] before 2008 probably 2004

[1:36:30] his wife and was living with another
[1:36:32] woman and
[1:36:35] church was all broke up
[1:36:39] they introduced me to him and he made a
[1:36:41] little remark at me when did i smarted
[1:36:43] him off

[1:36:51] years
[1:36:53] i'd be down and pray and that little
[1:36:54] thing would come up
[1:36:56] and i'd just kind of push it away and
[1:36:57] keep going
[1:36:59] but see the day come when i got
[1:37:01] desperate needed god do something
[1:37:03] and that little thing kept coming up

[1:37:43] i said all right lord
[1:37:44] i called him up got him on the phone

[1:37:49] years he said what's your name i told
[1:37:50] him i said i met you one night at tempe

[1:37:58] that night outside that tent that i had
[1:38:00] no business talking to you that way as
[1:38:01] an elder
[1:38:02] i didn't care if i disagreed or
[1:38:05] you were wrong or right or whatever
[1:38:07] it was not on me to say what i said to
[1:38:09] you
[1:38:11] and the holy spirit has had me to call
[1:38:12] you to tell you that i'm sorry for what
[1:38:14] i said i should have never spoke those
[1:38:15] words
[1:38:17] and brother you know what he said
[1:38:18] son you were forgiven don't you ever
[1:38:21] worry about it again and when he said it
[1:38:23] was like something went off of me
[1:38:26] and i felt so free
[1:38:28] i got back and started preaching on the
[1:38:30] holy ghost and being born again to our
[1:38:32] young people my wife can tell you these
[1:38:33] these here probably would never some of
[1:38:35] them weren't even born
[1:38:36] the holy ghost started coming to the
[1:38:38] meetings
[1:38:39] and we literally some nights was in
[1:38:41] there till midnight asked my wife and we
[1:38:43] had to carry some of the young people to
[1:38:45] the cars to get them home they were
[1:38:47] getting so drunk on the holy spirit
[1:38:52] but it started right there
[1:38:54] i had god had to trouble me and i had to
[1:38:57] face what i had to face
[1:39:00] and you said you didn't go no water no
[1:39:02] but i got washed by the washing of water
[1:39:04] by the word
[1:39:06] that cleansed me and appeared cleaned
[1:39:07] this up when he cleaned this up it gave
[1:39:10] god a chance to work and we baptized
[1:39:12] over 40 young people in several months
[1:39:14] right and and to this day as far as i
[1:39:16] know most of them are baptized maybe a
[1:39:18] couple the majority now are married got
[1:39:20] children and they're serving the lord
