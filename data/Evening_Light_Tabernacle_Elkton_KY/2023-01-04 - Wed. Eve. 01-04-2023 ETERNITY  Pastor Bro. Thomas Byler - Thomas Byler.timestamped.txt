[25:11] remember Sunday said something about
[25:12] amen we've spoken about times and
[25:16] seasons and things like that
[25:17] dispensations and whatnot but I kind of
[25:20] wanted to speak about eternity amen so
[25:22] amen that's what we want to speak about
[25:24] tonight with the help of the Lord and
[25:27] we're going to certainly be pulling some
[25:30] uh things out of the message the prophet
[25:33] God preached on uh in the future home in
[25:38] the future home but let's and and I want
[25:40] to turn first John first not first John
[25:43] but Saint John if you will will begin
[25:45] with reading a verse in in first John I
[25:49] mean Saint John
[25:53] Saint John
[25:55] then I think I'll also read just comes
[25:58] to mind now and I may turn to that acts
[26:01] 1 if you want to help go over there to
[26:03] acts 1 if you will
[26:05] uh kind of pull that page up okay right
[26:08] there
[26:11] Saint John five
[26:14] and verse 24. verily verily I say unto
[26:18] you he that heareth my words and
[26:20] believeth on him that sent me hath
[26:23] everlasting life and shall not come into
[26:25] condemnation but it's pressed from death
[26:29] unto life over in Acts the first chapter
[26:34] amen we want to just kind of blend it
[26:36] together a little bit uh last sermon
[26:39] with this one amen acts 1 and verse 6.
[26:43] and they therefore when they therefore
[26:45] will come together they ask of him
[26:48] saying Lord will that this time restore
[26:50] again the Kingdom of Israel and he said
[26:53] unto them it is not for you to know the
[26:55] times and the seasons which the father
[26:57] has put in his own power but ye shall
[27:00] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[27:02] has come upon you then you shall be
[27:04] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[27:06] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[27:09] other most parts of the earth amen may
[27:12] God add His blessings to the reading of
[27:14] the words you can be seated amen tonight
[27:16] with the help of the Lord for just a
[27:18] little while I'd like to speak about and
[27:20] on
[27:22] eternity
[27:23] eternity
[27:24] amen
[27:26] and I like this because one place here
[27:29] just capping up recapping here what
[27:31] Jesus was saying he says you know that
[27:35] uh he that he heareth my word and
[27:38] believeth on him that sent me half
[27:40] everlasting life and shall not come into
[27:43] condemnation but his past amen I want
[27:46] you to pick up that word passed a little
[27:48] bit amen past
[27:50] amen now
[27:53] um
[27:54] you know when when somebody dies we say
[27:56] they passed away is that right
[28:00] and it has the same type of meaning amen
[28:03] that they went from one thing to another
[28:06] amen but you've passed now not just
[28:09] passed into death but you've passed from
[28:11] death
[28:13] and to life
[28:16] um and there's so many scriptures maybe
[28:18] I should just pick up a couple would
[28:20] that be okay I think Paul had another
[28:23] good expression of it when he said in
[28:25] the second chapter of uh Ephesians you
[28:28] hath he quickened who were dead
[28:31] amen you you were dead in trespasses and
[28:37] since
[28:38] we're in times past he walked according
[28:40] to the course of this world according to
[28:42] the prince of the power of the air
[28:44] the spirit that now worketh in the
[28:46] children of Disobedience among also we
[28:48] have had our conversation in times in
[28:51] the lust of the flesh fulfilling the
[28:52] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[28:55] were by nature to Children of Wrath even
[28:57] as others but God who is rich in Mercy
[29:00] for his great love which wherewith he
[29:01] has loved us even when we were dead
[29:07] in sins he hath quickened us amen
[29:11] together with Christ and hath raised us
[29:15] up together and has made us sit together
[29:18] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[29:24] amen
[29:26] praise the Lord notice verse 10 for we
[29:28] are his workmanship created in Christ
[29:30] Jesus unto good works which he hath
[29:33] before
[29:34] ordained that we should walk
[29:37] in them amen how many believe that
[29:40] praise be to God now I just want to go
[29:44] back again and read some more Amen in uh
[29:47] Saint this is one scripture that uh
[29:49] talking about how that Jesus said that
[29:51] if you believe his word you have passed
[29:54] from
[29:54] death unto alive now y'all remember the
[29:58] rising of uh Lazarus and so forth when
[30:00] Martha Jesus came to Martha and them and
[30:03] Martha says you know he said says and
[30:07] then said Martha this is in chapter 11
[30:09] of Saint John but I know and Martha said
[30:11] unto Jesus Lord if thou Hat's been here
[30:13] my brother had not died but I know that
[30:16] even now whatsoever thou will ask of God
[30:19] God will give it thee Jesus saith unto
[30:22] her thy brother shall rise again
[30:25] Martha said unto him I know that he
[30:27] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[30:29] the last day Jesus saith unto her I am
[30:33] the resurrection
[30:35] amen y'all remember what brother bam
[30:37] says that if you've got the baptism of
[30:39] the Holy Ghost you already have the
[30:41] resurrection and the Rapture in you
[30:43] remember that amen it is just a
[30:46] scripture that backs that up because if
[30:47] you've got Christ you've got the
[30:50] resurrection and you're ready
[30:52] amen
[30:55] I am the resurrection and the life he
[30:57] that believeth in me though he were dead
[31:01] yet shall he live
[31:04] foreign
[31:04] that Jesus could have said he could have
[31:07] stopped there but he's going to throw
[31:09] throw so to speak a monkey wrench in it
[31:12] he's going to challenge people's faith
[31:15] he goes a little further and he says and
[31:18] who who's whoever is alive we're liveth
[31:21] and believeth in me shall never die
[31:27] now how many knows we as Mortals know
[31:29] that hey you know that's a big word
[31:33] word for this old flesh right here huh
[31:36] but we already know there's a lot of
[31:38] other scriptures he says you know that
[31:39] he came to you know to give us eternal
[31:42] life and to raise us up at the last day
[31:45] so we know that he's talking about the
[31:47] soul isn't that right he's not talking
[31:48] about the feds
[31:51] not a one amen
[31:56] well did the apostles did they die yeah
[31:59] they all died come on folks amen amen
[32:02] he's talking about the soul the Bible
[32:04] says the soul that sinneth it shall
[32:06] surely die amen and even the prophet of
[32:09] God says you know there is no such and
[32:11] I'll read it here probably got to hear
[32:12] there's no such a thing as death to a
[32:14] Christian because death means separation
[32:17] from God that soul will never be
[32:21] separated from God we know that when you
[32:23] take that last breath you don't die you
[32:25] just go from here right under the altar
[32:28] of God right into the presence of God
[32:30] and you're just as live as you ever was
[32:32] you are not going to die
[32:34] amen
[32:36] believe us now this I like that he says
[32:38] can you believe that
[32:40] amen you always liked the challenge as
[32:42] with with believing and so forth now now
[32:45] let me say something else here read one
[32:46] more scripture over
[32:48] here and and at first John and a very
[32:52] very
[32:53] familiar scripture to me I like it a lot
[32:55] in first John 5 and
[33:00] um
[33:02] verse 12 we'll just go to verse 12. he
[33:04] that hath the son hath life and he that
[33:08] hath not the Son of God and not life
[33:14] amen
[33:16] now we know that what that's talking
[33:19] about eternal life don't mean they're
[33:21] not alive they're alive but they have a
[33:23] temporary life they're as good as dead
[33:25] isn't that right so without God you're
[33:28] dead there's only one real form of
[33:31] eternal life and that is God's own life
[33:33] and that's what we want to talk about
[33:34] with the help of the Lord tonight and
[33:36] Jesus really emphasized it saying that
[33:38] you know if you uh truly believe on him
[33:42] you have passed from Death not only
[33:45] death but sorrow sadness
[33:49] depression everything that comes along
[33:51] with death you've passed from that how
[33:55] many knows something really happens to a
[33:58] person that gets born again
[34:00] the person
[34:01] that gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[34:03] something takes place that's of Eternal
[34:06] value
[34:10] I'm gonna read some more I just last
[34:12] couple minutes there I just picked it up
[34:18] therefore
[34:19] if that Eternal value is the baptism of
[34:23] the Holy Ghost Jesus when he was here he
[34:27] makes this statement in Saint John 6 and
[34:29] 27 he says therefore labor not for the
[34:32] meat which perishes but for the meat
[34:35] which endureth unto everlasting life
[34:40] amen
[34:41] and I'm you know I I just last I'll tell
[34:45] you what
[34:46] it was just been special to me ever
[34:50] Sunday Lord really bless Sunday if you
[34:52] had great two great Services just the
[34:54] atmosphere and I went home and I thought
[34:56] boy I just need more of this
[34:58] you know it's just eternal life and I
[35:00] got to thinking you know so and I think
[35:02] about how busy we get and the things of
[35:04] the natural amen how busy we are about
[35:07] things that's really our is going to
[35:10] pass away
[35:11] and how little we put into the Eternal
[35:14] things that's not going to pass away and
[35:17] Jesus and tells us don't labor so much
[35:19] for that he says but labor for the meat
[35:21] that endures unto everlasting life
[35:25] which the son of man shall give unto you
[35:27] for he hath defi him hath the father's
[35:30] seal amen
[35:33] notice how he says in verse 35 Jesus
[35:36] says and says I am the bread of life he
[35:38] that cometh to me shall never hunger and
[35:41] he that believeth on me shall never
[35:43] thirst
[35:45] oh my
[35:46] you know this and I'm going to jump
[35:48] around and down in verse 49 he says I am
[35:50] the bread of life your fathers did eat
[35:52] Manna in the wilderness and are dead
[35:55] this is the bread which cometh down from
[35:57] heaven If any man eat thereof
[36:02] that a man may eat thereof there we go
[36:05] that makes sense with the rest of it
[36:07] about messed up that a man may eat
[36:09] thereof and not die
[36:16] amen how many glad to be alive tonight I
[36:20] want you to know that if you get the
[36:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost you have got
[36:24] life in you
[36:28] you don't have to hold it just just
[36:30] breathe the Holy Ghost away from you
[36:32] from it and find out how depressed you
[36:34] get
[36:36] huh
[36:37] how quickly how sorrow sets and how how
[36:41] deflated you get y'all probably have
[36:43] done it a time or two I have
[36:45] huh
[36:46] but when that repentance comes and you
[36:48] receive even back how practice it is
[36:51] amen
[36:53] amen praise the Lord
[36:55] all right so he says that a man may eat
[36:59] thereof
[37:01] and not die I am the bread which came
[37:04] down from heaven If any man eat with
[37:06] this bread and he shall live forever
[37:09] amen and the bread that I will give is
[37:12] my flesh and I will give and I will give
[37:14] for the life of the world that's why
[37:16] even Paul could come back with the with
[37:18] the um the Jailer that had jail them and
[37:21] so forth and he says you know he wanted
[37:22] to repent he says what must I do to
[37:23] believe me to be saved and he says
[37:26] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:30] is that right believe what Jesus Christ
[37:33] was going to do and how did he gave his
[37:36] life for the sins of the world if you
[37:38] believe in that if you believe in him
[37:39] you'll never perish
[37:42] amen praise be to God
[37:45] oh my
[37:48] God that's right that he'll give for the
[37:50] life of this he exists and verily verily
[37:53] I say unto you I'll accept you eat the
[37:55] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[37:57] blood you have no life
[38:01] in you
[38:03] how many believe that this is the only
[38:05] one thing that you can eat
[38:07] the only thing that you can eat and live
[38:09] forever
[38:10] I wanted to speak on something just a
[38:12] little bit on the side but I want to
[38:13] just I felt led to speak on it
[38:16] and that is
[38:19] true appreciation how we truly
[38:21] appreciate
[38:24] having the truth
[38:28] and being able to have a voice and know
[38:30] that we have a voice we have the word
[38:32] that is truth and in the midst of all
[38:36] the voices that are out there
[38:39] huh
[38:40] to know that you have
[38:42] absolute the one thing that we know is
[38:46] absolute truth is this Bible
[38:49] is that right this you don't ever have
[38:51] to question this right here
[38:54] there's a lot of people that might have
[38:56] all kinds of interpretations but you
[38:58] come back to this
[39:00] and then of course uh you know there's
[39:02] another voice that is that that comes
[39:04] forth you know and that would be the
[39:06] fivefold ministry
[39:07] and how many knows that that fivefold
[39:10] Ministry is prophets and pastors and
[39:13] teachers advances and so forth and they
[39:15] are here to tell you what their own
[39:18] ideas
[39:19] well I think no not well I think but
[39:22] the word we're here to bring the word
[39:25] and of course we know that a prophet
[39:27] Amen to me that Prophet is a uh is a
[39:30] Divine revealer of the word he would to
[39:32] me be the highest Authority
[39:35] isn't that right he'd be the highest
[39:37] Authority I don't know nothing but
[39:38] reveal his sequence so he servants the
[39:40] prophets so we have a prophet God
[39:42] vindicates and he proves that Prophet is
[39:44] that right
[39:45] even as he did Paul Paul was a prophet
[39:48] and he wrote the whole new testament and
[39:49] said if an angel from heaven come and
[39:51] preach anything other than what we have
[39:53] preached if he's an angel from heaven
[39:55] let it be a curse
[39:57] so I don't know
[40:01] he says this Bible is the complete Revel
[40:04] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[40:07] in other words we haven't had nobody
[40:09] writing any more books lately
[40:11] right not since the time
[40:14] of John being on the islands The Book of
[40:18] Revelations and so forth you know we've
[40:20] had never had that too every it's
[40:22] complete it's a complete revelation of
[40:24] God and anything that anybody ever
[40:26] preaches it has to be and we have heard
[40:28] some crazy stuff I have heard some crazy
[40:30] stuff
[40:33] even the interpretation of the message
[40:35] of the hour you know of the things that
[40:37] people do and what they come up with and
[40:39] everything else
[40:40] isn't that right and the only way that
[40:42] you choose
[40:43] truly know when anybody any preacher is
[40:45] preaching the truth is he saying what
[40:48] that Prophet said is he saying what Paul
[40:50] said is he saying what the Bible says
[40:52] because we don't need to be per says
[40:54] anything different than this right here
[40:55] you have to have the discernment to be
[40:58] able to know
[40:59] whether he is or not
[41:01] amen so I'm thankful tonight for Truth
[41:04] for absolute truth five full minutes
[41:06] read in of course like I said the
[41:08] preachers they preach the word of God
[41:09] they say what the prophet said amen
[41:13] I mean no somebody brother Branham uh
[41:16] you know I don't forget just not just
[41:17] exactly which tape it was lean not to
[41:19] your own understanding or one of them he
[41:20] says you know you don't know how
[41:21] important it is just to save what's on
[41:23] those tapes
[41:25] amen
[41:26] and let me tell you tonight tonight even
[41:28] tonight the things that I'm going to
[41:29] teach here tonight is going to be
[41:31] something that has been uh uh you know I
[41:33] don't want to put you on guard already
[41:34] but has been controversial among some
[41:36] people and so forth but you know I pray
[41:38] for the uh an understanding of what the
[41:41] prophet is trying to say I certainly
[41:43] don't have all of it because you know
[41:44] there was a time when uh there's things
[41:46] that I didn't understand and I was kind
[41:48] of against it I would really uh you but
[41:51] get people preachers would say but later
[41:53] I found out that that's what the prophet
[41:55] said and the way that he taught it but
[41:57] God had to open it up but anyway and uh
[41:59] it has to do with eternity and I'll get
[42:01] to that here in a minute but the next
[42:03] now notice how after that you talk you
[42:05] have preachers we have so forth and then
[42:07] of course we have what I call the inside
[42:09] voice
[42:10] we have an inside voice isn't that right
[42:13] everybody has an inside voice but you
[42:15] know I found that that is a
[42:18] tricky thing because there's always two
[42:21] voices in there
[42:23] uh the carnal of mine is
[42:25] damned if you get there
[42:28] side by side hello then we've had and
[42:31] you've probably known people that you
[42:33] know have thought that you know I I'll
[42:34] tell you what I'm gonna follow the
[42:36] leading of the spirit I feel like I'm
[42:37] following the living of the spirit and
[42:40] so this is what I'm gonna do
[42:42] and end up going and doing that and find
[42:44] that it's a bitter failure
[42:48] huh
[42:50] and that can put you a real question on
[42:52] the leadership or that voice that you
[42:54] listen to right
[42:55] sure so yeah make sure that it's
[42:58] according to the word and you have to
[43:01] search your own heart and say God how
[43:03] did I miss it because I don't want to
[43:04] miss it I mean when you listen to that
[43:06] and you miss it you're really missing it
[43:09] because whatever you got to go by other
[43:11] than that really right there in the word
[43:13] of God
[43:14] because there's a lot of people claim to
[43:16] go by this and it has to you do have to
[43:18] have that voice that still small voice
[43:22] and sometimes the fact of the matter is
[43:24] we don't listen hard enough
[43:27] we don't listen hard enough sometimes
[43:30] amen
[43:31] but no doubt a lot of us can always a
[43:34] lot of us can you know and and that's
[43:37] what you have to exercise yourself in
[43:39] you have to learn to listen to that
[43:40] voice
[43:42] amen say Lord let me let me hear it and
[43:45] the more that you realize
[43:47] many times as a matter of fact just this
[43:50] last week happened to me I had a certain
[43:52] thought certain thing certain way I
[43:54] wanted to do something and so forth but
[43:56] I prayed about it
[43:58] and the Holy Spirit showed me no
[44:01] don't do it that way do it this way
[44:04] and that was less to get in
[44:06] you know what hey it's very easy for you
[44:08] to listen to that other one that flesh
[44:10] voice
[44:12] but yeah you know anytime it's carnal
[44:14] and 10 times it's hateful or whatever it
[44:17] might be anytime it's that way remember
[44:18] that's not God
[44:21] amen
[44:22] praise the Lord another thing I wanted
[44:24] to just uh just just just go before I
[44:27] get started here amen and that is
[44:30] something I uh spoke on a little bit I
[44:33] believe it was uh
[44:34] Sunday and you know I remember I told
[44:37] you I said I had a 24 inches that I
[44:38] wanted to talk to you about where is my
[44:40] other people where did it go
[44:43] you know people are always trying
[44:46] something new they're going here they're
[44:47] going there and there it is way back
[44:50] down here
[44:53] amen
[44:54] and I thought you know I don't never
[44:56] finished it but I said you know if
[44:57] people listen you don't have to go far
[44:59] to get anchored you don't have to go far
[45:03] to find the place you ought to be
[45:05] what is that 24 inches well I don't I
[45:09] didn't take a tape measure to it but I
[45:10] guarantee you there's about 24 inches
[45:12] from here to here all you got to do is
[45:14] go right down there that's the only
[45:15] moving that you got to do
[45:18] amen the holy spirit will show you what
[45:20] you need to do where you need to be in
[45:22] everything else and then it'll stabilize
[45:24] you you've heard of people putting down
[45:26] their roots
[45:28] will go to a place we'll fire we'll
[45:31] start a business we'll buy invest home
[45:33] and some people and man they invest in a
[45:35] certain place until you know there's all
[45:37] kinds of streets around here named after
[45:38] people you know and and so forth people
[45:40] get roads named after because they got
[45:42] root sounds so deep huh but I'll tell
[45:45] you what we really need to do is drop 24
[45:46] inches and get our roots in Christ Jesus
[45:49] amen
[45:50] praise the Lord
[45:51] Hallelujah all right let's go back to
[45:54] our thoughts so we think about this we
[45:56] think about eternal life and how that
[45:58] Jesus came for the purpose and many
[46:00] times if you'll notice in his preaching
[46:02] I came to give them
[46:04] eternal life let me believe that's what
[46:06] he come for
[46:07] he says I come down from heaven not to
[46:10] do my own will
[46:11] he says but the will of him that sent me
[46:14] and this is the Father's will which has
[46:17] sent me
[46:19] that of all which he has given me I
[46:23] should lose one or two
[46:27] now I said I would lose nothing
[46:32] so that sermon has to do with
[46:34] not only seeing where you are but who
[46:37] you are is that okay I mean listen to
[46:40] where you are and who you are
[46:42] but
[46:43] should raise it up again at the last day
[46:49] that everyone would see at the Sun and
[46:51] believeth on him may have everlasting
[46:54] life and I will
[46:57] the last day no man can come unto me
[47:01] except my Father which has sent me draw
[47:02] him and I will raise him up at last
[47:07] day amen
[47:10] let me go on into uh
[47:12] into this
[47:14] brother banam as you know he was a
[47:16] typologist how many knows that he did a
[47:18] lot of typing and and so forth he had
[47:21] did a lot of typing amen
[47:28] and when he was preaching when he was
[47:30] preaching the uh
[47:33] future home
[47:35] he was preaching to feature home
[47:40] he got to talking about
[47:42] being out of dispensations and not of
[47:44] types and so forth
[47:46] he typed
[47:48] the
[47:51] future home he talked about the earth
[47:52] and the process that it goes through if
[47:54] y'all remember he talked about Noah how
[47:57] that the world got his water baptism
[48:00] isn't that right under Noah
[48:02] and how did it got Sanctified and
[48:05] purchased on Calgary isn't that right it
[48:08] got Sanctified on Calvary by the blood
[48:11] of Jesus Christ and the Earth is still
[48:14] again
[48:15] it's baptism
[48:17] and then brother bam goes talking about
[48:19] dispensation he says now somebody might
[48:22] say that you've run out of your complete
[48:25] dispensation so forth he says now where
[48:27] are you going to go to now you're a
[48:28] dispensationalist but the BAM says which
[48:31] I am and but I believe that God is too
[48:33] notice how uh we we've talked Sunday
[48:35] about times and seasons and we're always
[48:37] living in New Years and New moons and
[48:41] this that and the other
[48:42] and we've come through seven Church ages
[48:45] in that right Seven Stars
[48:47] and we know that their last star now
[48:50] listen to this and put in the days of
[48:52] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[48:53] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[48:55] and don't talk about the eighth
[48:57] messenger
[48:58] amen doesn't talk about another age
[49:01] Beyond this
[49:03] we know to lay out I see a church age of
[49:05] course was Revelation 3 they were
[49:07] lukewarm isn't that right uh they had
[49:10] need of nothing rich and increased words
[49:12] and so forth brother Branham talked
[49:14] about how that we're not in the laodicea
[49:16] age
[49:17] I hope you're not in that hope you're
[49:19] not lukewarm wretched miserable poor
[49:21] blind and naked I hope you have had eyes
[49:24] have in that right I hope you snucked on
[49:26] your heart's door and you've opened up
[49:29] you've come over to Revelations 4 amen
[49:31] where it talks about come on up higher
[49:32] he said we're now in an astronaut age
[49:35] we're in a bright age she called it the
[49:37] bride age
[49:39] a different age
[49:41] and in this this is the word you've
[49:43] probably heard this kind of language
[49:44] before but I hope I make sense tonight
[49:46] now notice he says now you've run out of
[49:49] this
[49:49] compensation he says uh now that you're
[49:54] out of dispensational types for you're
[49:56] going to put something what are you
[49:57] going to put beyond that seventh day how
[50:00] are you going to get it where are you
[50:01] going now and I'll tell you what it
[50:02] takes a lot of study going back and
[50:04] forth amen because a lot of times you'll
[50:06] talk about seven days he'll talk about
[50:07] seven Church ages and so forth and I
[50:09] hope that we can halfway put it together
[50:11] all right now call your attention to
[50:13] something amen I ain't out of
[50:15] dismissations yet I've got another
[50:17] scripture here and he goes to uh
[50:19] Leviticus I believe it is 23 amen says
[50:23] and he reads the 36th verse and thou
[50:25] shalt offer offerings made of fire unto
[50:28] the Lord on the eighth day and on the
[50:31] Eighth Day shall be a holy convocation
[50:34] see there's another holy time coming a
[50:37] holy convocation unto you and you shall
[50:39] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[50:41] Lord for assembling now but the man says
[50:44] and this was the scripture now he goes
[50:46] into talking now we got an eighth day
[50:48] how many knows heard a lot of eight day
[50:50] doctrines around here amen amen there's
[50:53] been a lot of different doctrines of us
[50:55] being in the Eighth Day
[50:58] amen so let's see what the brother bam
[51:00] says
[51:02] now there's only seven days but here we
[51:04] speak of the Eighth Day a holy
[51:06] convocation he got it out of of course
[51:08] we know back in the Old Testament we
[51:09] know seven days and those seven feasts
[51:12] they all typed those seven Church ages
[51:15] brother ban him even one place if you
[51:17] remember in the church age book he says
[51:18] that he has given Israel two thousand
[51:20] some years at the same time as what he
[51:23] has given us but at the same time and he
[51:26] also says that they have went through
[51:27] theirs I have an ages now we're going
[51:29] through down Seven Ages amen if you've
[51:31] if you've heard him say that now notice
[51:33] so he's not now does notice do not
[51:36] work see the Eighth Day are what back to
[51:40] the first day again
[51:42] amen
[51:43] which speaks of
[51:46] Eternity all right and as she rolls
[51:49] around with a stopping place now he just
[51:51] touches on it a little bit here
[51:53] you know because how many knows our
[51:54] hearts are turned back to the faith of
[51:56] the fathers
[51:57] isn't that right amen by the band one
[52:00] place he says if you remember he says
[52:02] you know the book of Acts those that
[52:04] church should have taken the rapture
[52:06] and that'd be going on into that
[52:08] perfection
[52:09] they would have taken an option but we
[52:11] know it wasn't the will of God isn't
[52:12] that right so the first thing that
[52:14] happened is the first church what
[52:15] happened they lost the first law
[52:18] and that right there off their first
[52:20] love and notice how the first church age
[52:22] did not start until 53 A.D
[52:26] what happened with the other what about
[52:28] what was the other
[52:30] no time there a lot
[52:33] amen but talks about going back to the
[52:35] eighth day it doesn't go to uh you know
[52:38] it doesn't go really I hate today but it
[52:40] goes back to the first
[52:42] so now notice he says upon this Eighth
[52:45] Day the last day the feast day of
[52:46] Tabernacles after the feast day after
[52:48] the last Church age now notice up here
[52:52] yet said you know uh the seventh day
[52:55] here talks about seventh Church age so
[52:57] you kind of got to know what he's
[52:58] picking up on last Church eight after
[53:00] the seven complete days upon the Earth
[53:04] all right he says after the Millennium
[53:07] that this holy convocation comes I see
[53:11] be up too high I'm like I'm gonna put it
[53:12] down a little bit that I'm catch a lot
[53:14] of wind
[53:16] so how many knows that in time wise we
[53:19] have had 6 000 years
[53:21] is that right
[53:23] and the seventh day all right is going
[53:27] to be this millennium
[53:29] everybody understands that that's real
[53:31] simple
[53:32] easy to believe easy to believe but now
[53:35] notice he says remember the Feast of the
[53:37] Tabernacles of the Gatherings and so
[53:39] forth you know talking about the
[53:42] Millennium and so forth
[53:44] so now notice
[53:48] he says the Sabbath day which speaks of
[53:51] the Old Law which was to pass away the
[53:53] keeping of the Sabbath which passed away
[53:55] changed another
[53:57] he said no does it just change from the
[53:59] old law keeping of a certain day Isaiah
[54:01] said precept must be upon precept here a
[54:04] little there little whole fact that
[54:06] which good for within this family my
[54:08] tongue will I speak to my people and
[54:10] here is the rest see you will enter into
[54:13] life not keeping of a day or a shadow
[54:16] Paul said over Hebrews the fourth
[54:18] chapter you keep days and shadows and
[54:20] things like that I'm scared of your
[54:22] experience see we don't pass into
[54:25] certain days and orders
[54:27] he says you pass from Death unto
[54:32] eternal life
[54:33] so he brings it into what Jesus said not
[54:36] days and times you pass into
[54:40] eternity
[54:41] amen hallelujah there's that's the holy
[54:45] convocation now notice how he talks
[54:48] about a type of the eighth days
[54:51] amen even how many knows there's even
[54:53] after the Millennium there's still a
[54:54] fire
[54:55] amen there's still another battle with
[54:57] the devil and everything else but way
[54:59] over he's talking about Plum over past
[55:01] the Millennium being attacked now this
[55:03] is where it's getting at if you'll take
[55:05] you can I can show you many quotes where
[55:06] he talks any types the experience of the
[55:10] believer and what happens to you is a
[55:13] type of those seven Church ages and then
[55:15] the eighth day amen or the Sabbath day
[55:18] Plum over in the Millennium and pass
[55:19] that seven days switch pass away or I
[55:23] have said will change
[55:25] to another eight days deals with New
[55:28] Creation not all creation eight days
[55:31] will deals with New Creation for it was
[55:34] on the eighth day that our Lord raised
[55:37] from the dead
[55:38] amen
[55:40] now notice how even he ties in Paul's
[55:43] teaching he tells him to Paul teaching
[55:45] about not no rituals of man and no no uh
[55:48] you know you got to do this and laws and
[55:51] all these other things you know
[55:52] you pass from all of that
[55:55] Amen Let me see let me read that real
[55:58] quick Paul said
[56:00] and he may he may uh yeah
[56:06] in Colossians 2
[56:08] he says in verse 13 and you being dead
[56:10] in your sins and uh and the
[56:12] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[56:15] quickened together with him having
[56:17] forgiven you all trespasses and blotting
[56:20] out the handwriting of ordinances that
[56:22] was against us which was contrary to us
[56:25] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[56:28] the Cross having small principalities
[56:30] and Powers he made a show of them openly
[56:32] triumphing over them in it therefore let
[56:35] no man therefore judge you and meet or
[56:37] in drink or respect them any holy days
[56:39] or of any new moon new moon or of any
[56:43] Sabbath days which only a shadow things
[56:45] to come
[56:47] amen
[56:48] so let me know that we we actually
[56:51] honored the resurrection as the prophet
[56:52] of God said
[56:54] amen one place he said he wouldn't fish
[56:55] he wouldn't do this he wouldn't do that
[56:57] yet at the same time he said you know if
[56:59] you're way out somewhere you don't have
[57:01] church anywhere to go to if you wanted
[57:02] to hunt a little bit I guess you'd be
[57:04] all right or finish
[57:05] huh why because it's what we can't never
[57:08] go contrary about Paul taught you know
[57:10] but every day how many believe that for
[57:13] a Believer every day is Holy
[57:17] it's holy day every day if
[57:21] this
[57:22] is
[57:23] go back to keeping that Sabbath or
[57:26] you're part of the mark of the beast
[57:27] they want to go back to ordinances and
[57:29] laws and stuff
[57:30] you know Paul says we don't do that
[57:32] anymore we
[57:33] don't even do new moves we're not
[57:35] worried about we're not worried about uh
[57:37] uh we still go through this and this is
[57:39] the big thing this carnal this flesh
[57:42] still in time huh because I looked it up
[57:45] and brother man says we're not in time
[57:46] anymore we're in eternity you gotta
[57:48] understand what he's saying isn't that
[57:49] right another place he says now us
[57:51] creatures of time any prayers are
[57:53] creatures of time
[57:54] you know sure this is still a creature
[57:56] of time but this in here is a creature
[57:59] of Eternity
[58:01] Hallelujah all right
[58:04] I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man
[58:08] all things have passed away how many
[58:10] leaves that
[58:11] now he talks about and if you notice he
[58:14] types it with Revelations 21 when he
[58:17] says I saw a new Heaven and new earth
[58:19] amen
[58:21] Paul said put on the new man didn't he
[58:24] put on the new new man which is renewed
[58:26] after the spirit and so forth you know
[58:27] and cleanse and mortify the Deeds of the
[58:30] flesh
[58:31] get rid of all of that other stuff you
[58:33] know let the Holy Ghost Fire come down
[58:35] and burn it out all right let me just go
[58:37] on
[58:38] all right so now notice there's your
[58:41] convocation you're holding us not
[58:43] considering this sabbath or feast days
[58:44] or so forth amen but it was the Feast of
[58:46] habit or the Pentecost now notice after
[58:49] this having Sabbath seven Church ages
[58:51] Jesus raised from the dead hey which is
[58:54] a holy convocation which is the first
[58:56] day young passed through
[58:59] try time
[59:01] and drop into eternity again keeping of
[59:05] days and Sabbath and new moons like
[59:07] God's past change form amen but passed
[59:11] from Death unto eternal life
[59:13] that's what the Bible teaches is past
[59:16] now again he says in do you don't come
[59:18] by laws and rituals
[59:21] huh I mean how many remembers that
[59:24] brother bam taught he says you know uh
[59:26] all these times and all these
[59:28] dispensations these changes uh it's like
[59:31] a building a wall or a house amen and he
[59:35] says we're building a house not just a
[59:37] wall and God's Building you know and he
[59:40] says any mason can lay on a straight
[59:43] wall but it takes a Mason to turn the
[59:45] corner
[59:46] and how many know that's where the
[59:48] problem is with Humanity they get stuck
[59:50] in a rut to get stuck in a certain age
[59:52] and they can't turn a corner isn't that
[59:55] what happened with Israel you know there
[59:57] were so much in the washing of the pots
[59:59] and the pans and oh you better wash your
[1:00:01] hands before eating and this out of the
[1:00:03] other and you don't do this and don't do
[1:00:06] that they're so stuck in that rut they
[1:00:07] couldn't turn the corner when Christ
[1:00:09] come on the scene
[1:00:10] Jesus said that unless you believe that
[1:00:12] I am here you will die in your unbelief
[1:00:15] or your sins now right
[1:00:17] so they couldn't turn the toner every
[1:00:19] time even all the way up to uh it might
[1:00:22] have been went to every Church you don't
[1:00:24] know whether it was a Methodist a
[1:00:26] Lutheran the lutherans when Wesley come
[1:00:28] along they just got stuck in that rut
[1:00:31] amen because he said you know every last
[1:00:33] one of them would have been turned to uh
[1:00:36] Westlands and then to West and all of
[1:00:39] them if they had turned the corner did
[1:00:40] it become Pentecost because God was
[1:00:43] always turned into corner
[1:00:45] amen all the way to Pentecost Nomine
[1:00:48] knows that even Pentecost couldn't turn
[1:00:50] the corner even though God himself would
[1:00:52] come down and vindicate himself and
[1:00:54] prove himself alive like you did they
[1:00:56] just couldn't accept it because they
[1:00:58] wanted to stick to their you know
[1:01:00] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:01:02] the Holy Ghost if you don't believe that
[1:01:03] I don't care how much Jesus comes to
[1:01:05] your search we're not coming and we
[1:01:07] don't believe it
[1:01:09] that's basically what they said in
[1:01:10] action
[1:01:12] isn't that right because they said
[1:01:13] anybody goes to another man meetings of
[1:01:15] us will actually communicate he don't
[1:01:16] believe that I didn't see evidence of
[1:01:18] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:20] you talk about
[1:01:22] terrible
[1:01:24] that's a terrible thing
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:30] turn the corner God keeps turning a
[1:01:33] corner and even from laodicea I mean
[1:01:36] he's turned the corner God has come out
[1:01:38] of her my people
[1:01:40] how many is part of that part of that
[1:01:42] come out of her my people you're my
[1:01:44] bride you're my church You're The
[1:01:46] Virtuous unadulterated pride of Jesus
[1:01:48] Christ if you believe every job every
[1:01:50] table we've called back amen not to some
[1:01:53] station and remember on the tapes back
[1:01:54] there I wanted to get it and I didn't I
[1:01:56] forgot to but on the tapes back there on
[1:01:58] the back of that little
[1:02:00] card it talks about I didn't call you to
[1:02:02] church I didn't call you to follow me or
[1:02:04] start another church or do this that or
[1:02:06] the other I came to bring a fellowship
[1:02:08] between man and God he came to bring us
[1:02:11] to God amen point us to Christ not some
[1:02:14] other not a new church age or something
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:20] so you don't come by laws and rituals
[1:02:22] and orders and you come by
[1:02:24] predestination that's there's the
[1:02:26] genuine holy convocation and we're
[1:02:29] ending this Evans church age the
[1:02:31] Pentecostal age you see it we're
[1:02:33] entering into that Holy convocation we
[1:02:38] are ending into that real genuine
[1:02:42] eternity
[1:02:43] amen how many flat to be in eternity
[1:02:46] have eternal life
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] where the church is called not not some
[1:02:53] station not some denomination but into
[1:02:57] eternity
[1:02:59] where there each with their Eternal King
[1:03:02] amen oh my there's no such a thing as
[1:03:06] days and things and times and so forth
[1:03:09] you've passed into eternity where you
[1:03:12] come from
[1:03:13] you is there to begin with
[1:03:17] amen listen he says if you've got
[1:03:19] eternal life there's only one form and
[1:03:21] that's God
[1:03:22] and you
[1:03:24] by and express
[1:03:27] you're not gonna be there anyhow
[1:03:35] oh sometimes I think better better he
[1:03:37] said one place he says you know if we
[1:03:39] would really grasp if this would all
[1:03:40] come flooding down in wheatgrass but he
[1:03:42] says the Rapture would take place didn't
[1:03:44] he we just we could translate it if you
[1:03:46] just really comprehend all this
[1:03:48] you're not sitting there by accident
[1:03:50] you're not sitting there by chance oh I
[1:03:53] just happen to be here
[1:03:54] no you did not happen by no means to be
[1:03:57] here
[1:03:58] and if you can believe the word of God
[1:04:00] you did not happen to be able to believe
[1:04:02] it that was something that God had
[1:04:04] ordained before the world ever began
[1:04:09] that's why you're sitting Where You Are
[1:04:12] that's why you have eternal life that's
[1:04:14] why there is something down there to
[1:04:16] Quicken
[1:04:17] because he thought of you before there
[1:04:19] was ever a stardust before there was
[1:04:21] anything
[1:04:23] expressed that you be if you're not
[1:04:25] you're not gonna be there anyhow because
[1:04:27] no man can come unto me except my
[1:04:28] father's draws him see which passes away
[1:04:31] and all these old things but these
[1:04:33] things don't he says he speaks of
[1:04:34] Eternity the Holy Ghost is eternal
[1:04:37] then you are in eternity where you was
[1:04:41] all the time amen
[1:04:45] but you just recognize what happened I
[1:04:47] believe it's in here also the brother
[1:04:48] Brown talks about he says you know you
[1:04:50] weren't saved on a certain day
[1:04:53] oh yeah we sing the song yeah I can take
[1:04:56] you two time and I can take you to
[1:04:59] please where the Lord Save Me
[1:05:03] by his wonderful Breeze I can take you
[1:05:07] to the time and I can take you to the
[1:05:09] place where I recognize what God did for
[1:05:11] me where I accept that what God had
[1:05:14] already done for me
[1:05:16] that's what you can point but you was
[1:05:18] wrote down in the last book of life
[1:05:20] before the world was ever made if you're
[1:05:22] ever going to make it your name was
[1:05:24] there then
[1:05:25] if you're a Christian and your life is
[1:05:27] absolutely tallying up and you know that
[1:05:29] you're one of yours what that ought to
[1:05:31] do to you
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] it ought to be like but it's bad it says
[1:05:38] every day with God it's a new day
[1:05:41] every day it's a new start
[1:05:43] I thought of that song something about
[1:05:45] um every morning his mercies are new my
[1:05:48] redeemer is faithful and true every
[1:05:51] morning his mercies are new
[1:05:53] he's fresh it's good it's every morning
[1:05:56] amen praise the Lord oh my
[1:06:00] my how I'd like to get you know but you
[1:06:03] know better brand believed in justify
[1:06:05] bye State Sanctified state but God if
[1:06:09] you're here she'll bring you to a holy
[1:06:11] ghost baptism State isn't that right
[1:06:13] he'll fill you with that baptism of the
[1:06:15] Holy Ghost some people it may deliver on
[1:06:17] the edges
[1:06:18] but not really into that Shekinah Glory
[1:06:22] I I'm so glad that you ain't got to just
[1:06:25] come to church to be in the Shekinah
[1:06:26] Glory
[1:06:27] uh you could be in that Shekinah Glory
[1:06:29] Wherever You Are
[1:06:31] your car at your work wherever it is in
[1:06:33] the woods you can get so full and so
[1:06:35] join in that and not until you'll run
[1:06:37] around a tree like the prophet did
[1:06:39] that's your kind of Glory is with you
[1:06:41] are in eternity
[1:06:43] time don't mean anything we're just
[1:06:45] waiting for this to play out
[1:06:47] amen because we know the seventh Church
[1:06:49] Aid in this world goes all the way to
[1:06:51] the end amen
[1:06:52] but in this in this age God catches us
[1:06:55] up
[1:06:56] and brings us back into eternity where
[1:06:58] he was to begin with
[1:07:00] praise the Lord
[1:07:02] oh my
[1:07:04] you now notice
[1:07:06] you just recognize what happened see you

[1:07:35] of you before the foundation of the
[1:07:37] world
[1:07:37] and you are sitting here an expression
[1:07:40] of a thought

[1:09:12] that right
[1:09:13] they failed to move on with God same

[1:10:19] he dust took dust and made Adam is that
[1:10:22] right put him in the body
[1:10:25] because he was wanting to have sons and
[1:10:26] daughters of God he knew he'd have sons
[1:10:28] and daughters of God
[1:10:31] so he came and redeemed you
[1:10:34] while sin come along and perverted his
[1:10:36] way you come on you come anyhow but you
[1:10:39] was lost with the world so he come to
[1:10:42] redeem that to redeem you
[1:10:44] the express attribute and also and also
[1:10:48] redeems his Earth by the same way then
[1:10:51] his purpose rolls oh well and see
[1:10:53] hallelujah oh that does me so much good
[1:10:55] just think of what lays ahead see Heaven
[1:10:58] and Earth have met God and man is
[1:11:01] reconciled how many believe that
[1:11:04] sure
[1:11:06] everything that Adam lost
[1:11:09] we have rights to again let me believe
[1:11:12] that
[1:11:15] our thinking on this at home studying
[1:11:18] and I thought we ask ourselves well then
[1:11:20] why ain't I moving mountains why ain't I
[1:11:22] speaking to this and telling that to do
[1:11:24] this and telling that to that
[1:11:26] well why aren't you
[1:11:30] well why aren't you the prophet did he
[1:11:34] stopped storms he stopped Bulls he
[1:11:35] stopped Hornets he created squirrels
[1:11:38] and he was our example now wasn't he
[1:11:41] but how many knows he didn't do that of
[1:11:43] his own and I think that's the way it
[1:11:44] was we met with Adam he just don't do
[1:11:46] all of its own
[1:11:48] oh my
[1:11:50] get me going here
[1:11:55] but he did it as the Holy Spirit led him
[1:11:58] to do it and he could stop storms he
[1:11:59] could stop bulls and I want you to know
[1:12:01] that in our Spirits we are redeemed how
[1:12:04] many believe you're redeemed you're
[1:12:06] Redeemed by God we have been given the
[1:12:07] ministry of reconciliation be reconciled
[1:12:10] to God Paul said we've been reconciled
[1:12:12] the only thing the only problem
[1:12:15] is flesh still
[1:12:17] huh it's not redeemed
[1:12:19] huh it still has to be redeemed and
[1:12:21] we're going to look right now at how
[1:12:23] that's going to happen is that okay God
[1:12:25] and man is reconciled a restored Eden
[1:12:27] has begun see now now all the curse is
[1:12:30] gone now notice over there in the new
[1:12:32] heavens and Nerf all the curse is gone
[1:12:34] just like all the curse of sin is gone
[1:12:37] when the Holy Spirit accepts you
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] can I talk about first to take some time
[1:12:44] talk about the the the
[1:12:47] curse being gone
[1:12:54] the curse being gone
[1:13:00] God never did curse Adam did he
[1:13:03] he cursed the ground
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:06] he cursed the ground it'll bring thorns
[1:13:09] and thistles
[1:13:11] Nevada sweated eyebrow now what was Adam
[1:13:13] made of
[1:13:15] dirt
[1:13:17] that's why
[1:13:18] at that time I mean those at that time
[1:13:21] things went from immortality to horse
[1:13:25] from immortality
[1:13:28] trees
[1:13:30] all the animals
[1:13:32] huh
[1:13:34] everything all done
[1:13:36] hard everything was Immortal it was you
[1:13:39] know because he's taking this back to
[1:13:41] Eden there's nothing going to die the
[1:13:43] trees will be Evergreen everything will
[1:13:45] be all green
[1:13:46] you'll live forever ain't gonna be no
[1:13:48] fall over
[1:13:50] there
[1:13:51] huh
[1:13:52] but at that time when he cursed that he
[1:13:54] cursed his body also his body came under
[1:13:57] the curse of what death
[1:14:00] he lived for a long time yet but the
[1:14:02] Earth was cursed his body was cursed and
[1:14:03] that's when he got old
[1:14:05] how many knows when it's the curses
[1:14:07] lifted
[1:14:09] these bodies will do what again change
[1:14:12] I mean it was Adam's Body changed and
[1:14:15] the Rapture comes your body will change
[1:14:17] if you're alive and remain your body
[1:14:19] will change brother Brian
[1:14:21] go back to the color of hell you had at
[1:14:23] 20. huh
[1:14:25] mind same way cut back to 20 to go back
[1:14:28] just like He restored Abraham curse will
[1:14:32] be gone
[1:14:33] praise be to God but notice how he says
[1:14:36] the curse of sin is gone when the Holy
[1:14:38] Spirit accepts you
[1:14:40] all right let me skip over here a little
[1:14:42] bit see you was born in sin but God had
[1:14:45] that attribute here you express yourself
[1:14:48] here on Earth and he comes down and he
[1:14:52] gets you let me believe that even the
[1:14:55] woman that dwell she was in bad shape
[1:14:57] but she was
[1:14:58] expressed attributes she had to see
[1:15:00] dinner
[1:15:01] there's something to Quicken
[1:15:03] and the Holy Spirit come down and found
[1:15:06] her
[1:15:06] see you're back here here's where you
[1:15:09] belong sin lost its power that's right
[1:15:12] the desire of her sin done gone from
[1:15:15] your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:20] you are a restored person
[1:15:24] he says and then when the earth is
[1:15:26] restored by the same way there can be no
[1:15:28] more cursing no more storms no more
[1:15:30] winds no more typhoons rather you
[1:15:32] reconcile God a man has met no Grace no
[1:15:36] tear drops no blood checks you'll never
[1:15:37] moisten the tear and so forth now notice
[1:15:40] even the desert will bring forth Blossom
[1:15:42] as a rose at all
[1:15:44] sticky
[1:15:46] I'm gonna say that old sticky attitude
[1:15:48] we have
[1:15:49] huh
[1:15:50] well Blossom one day like a rose when
[1:15:52] she's redeemed when she takes her fire
[1:15:54] baptism there's all kinds of cactus and
[1:15:56] stickers and everything now but she's
[1:15:58] got a fire baptism coming like the man
[1:16:01] was
[1:16:03] when he still had hatred and Malice
[1:16:06] Strife until that fire baptism come and
[1:16:11] cleaned it off no more jealousy no more
[1:16:13] nothing
[1:16:17] to desire for sin away
[1:16:21] it takes some meanness away
[1:16:24] I got wrote down here he'll take a man
[1:16:26] and make a gentleman
[1:16:28] he'll take a woman and he'll take make a
[1:16:31] lady out of her that's what the Holy
[1:16:33] Ghost does

[1:16:38] bad the man is no matter how bad the
[1:16:40] woman is to make a lady out of you make
[1:16:41] a gentleman out of her
[1:16:43] praise be to God aren't you glad
[1:16:46] that's why he says put a little sway
[1:16:47] lying and all these things from you let
[1:16:50] the Holy Ghost burn all them things out
[1:16:52] amen we want to come down to a close
[1:16:54] here

[1:16:58] a type when the fire baptism came no no
[1:17:01] no he cleaned it off there's no more
[1:17:03] jealousy no more nothing it's just
[1:17:05] absolutely the dwelling place for God

[1:17:31] now notice Ephesians it calls it the
[1:17:34] fullness of time when the fullness of
[1:17:36] time has come
[1:17:37] that's when time is fulfilled there is
[1:17:39] no more time you go over into eternity
[1:17:41] after the seventh Church age is over
[1:17:45] now it has in a parenthesis and it is
[1:17:49] I don't know what the parenthesis is if
[1:17:51] there's somebody putting that in there

[1:20:31] says the gases that are up there we'll
[1:20:33] catch on fire

[1:20:38] worried about the ozone layer and all
[1:20:40] this gas and stuff that's building up up
[1:20:42] there
[1:20:43] huh yeah maybe it is building up it's

[1:21:02] burnt that's what the prophet said
[1:21:05] if you've got no things in your heart
[1:21:06] remember you're going to be in the heart
[1:21:08] of the fire because all those things are
[1:21:09] going to get burnt so we can
[1:21:12] um we can gladly hopefully each and
[1:21:14] every one of us can say I'm glad and I'm

[1:21:24] fire has already been
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:30] all right
[1:21:33] same thing when he gives you the Holy
[1:21:34] Ghost now notice
[1:21:40] again he mentions all germs is gone
[1:21:43] makes it a fit place
[1:21:45] then for the Heavens to dwell here on
[1:21:48] Earth type now of sitting in heaven
[1:21:50] places in Christ Jesus pass from just
[1:21:52] dirty like the woman was into the
[1:21:54] expressed attribute of God
[1:21:58] now while we're talking about that I'm
[1:22:00] going to read what he's typing it with
[1:22:03] Revelations 21 and I saw a new Heaven
[1:22:05] and a new Earth and the first Heaven and
[1:22:08] the first Earth were passed away and
[1:22:10] there was no more seed and I John saw
[1:22:12] the holy city New Jerusalem coming down
[1:22:14] from God out of Heaven prepared as a
[1:22:17] bride adorned for her husband and I
[1:22:20] heard a great voice out of Heaven saying
[1:22:22] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:22:24] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:22:26] shall be his people and God himself
[1:22:28] shall be with them and be their God
[1:22:32] now how many knows that that does type
[1:22:33] the spiritual because God is not just
[1:22:35] with us but he's in us already he's
[1:22:38] already tabernacled in you and in me he
[1:22:42] made all things new amen there's a new
[1:22:45] man
[1:22:46] amen who wasn't saying that oh it was
[1:22:49] brother Glenn singing that song he says
[1:22:52] you know that old man is dead amen
[1:22:54] praise the Lord
[1:22:57] and God so my ball tears from them from
[1:23:00] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:23:01] death nor sorrow nor quietly nor shall
[1:23:03] be any more for the former things are
[1:23:05] passed away no notice pass from just
[1:23:09] dirty like the woman was too and that
[1:23:11] would be God now are we sons of God not
[1:23:12] we will be we're the attributes of your
[1:23:14] thinkings thinking sin all gone
[1:23:16] Millennium not said it's time for the
[1:23:18] Holy Spirit takes its place amen when he
[1:23:20] does he passes from Death unto life
[1:23:23] it passes from Death unto life dwelling
[1:23:26] in Heavenly places in Christ in his
[1:23:28] glorious presence even physical death
[1:23:31] will pass away then just as spiritual
[1:23:33] death has passed away now there is no
[1:23:36] such thing as spiritual death now to a
[1:23:39] baptized saint of God Amen though he
[1:23:42] were dead yet shall he live and
[1:23:44] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:23:45] shall never die
[1:23:48] all scriptures must be fulfilled you see
[1:23:51] you can't die you've got eternal life
[1:23:53] the only thing is the Redeemer has made
[1:23:55] you recognize this and you always was
[1:23:58] that that's the reason that you see the
[1:24:01] date that you're living in
[1:24:03] amen how many believe that it takes the
[1:24:05] Holy Spirit to Quicken to you the hour
[1:24:08] and the voice and the word for your hour
[1:24:11] otherwise you'd be say well no we got to
[1:24:14] be the Amish we got to be Mennonite we
[1:24:15] got to be Pinnacle we gotta be this that
[1:24:16] or the other if he wasn't but if you're
[1:24:19] an Express attribute you'll recognize a
[1:24:21] day that you are living in in closing
[1:24:24] now notice and remember people that are
[1:24:27] washed people that are clean people that
[1:24:29] had scoured out he says brother bam says
[1:24:31] yeah
[1:24:32] let me just say let me just read it like
[1:24:35] the man was and he still had had written
[1:24:37] malice and strife when fire baptism come
[1:24:40] and cleaned it off no more jealousy no
[1:24:42] more nothing it's just absolutely a
[1:24:45] dwelling place for God and remember
[1:24:47] that's his delegation that's going to
[1:24:51] meet him over there
[1:24:54] how many believe that
[1:24:55] that's who is going in the Rapture those
[1:24:59] who have already experienced the fire
[1:25:01] baptism and have went over into eternity
[1:25:05] amen
[1:25:06] all sin gone all doubt gone all of that
[1:25:09] gone just simply up dwelling please for
[1:25:12] God Amen that's not just a story that's
[1:25:16] the truth that's what the ba the bride
[1:25:19] goes to amen God bless you stand with me
[1:25:22] if tonight if you will
[1:25:30] musicians if you'll come
[1:25:39] in closing
[1:25:42] there's a couple more things I wanted to
[1:25:44] do but I'm just going to do this one
[1:25:47] and that is
[1:25:51] I was thinking of how I was speaking
[1:25:53] Sunday a little bit about our past
[1:25:56] and how
[1:25:58] that in order to
[1:26:01] get it for
[1:26:03] gotten
[1:26:04] now how many knows it God can forget
[1:26:06] your past when he drops in his bleach
[1:26:09] he goes in his past and he don't
[1:26:11] remember it no more
[1:26:13] over in Revelations the Bible says and
[1:26:15] God has remembered her iniquities that
[1:26:18] great Harlot before he judges her double
[1:26:21] her and so forth according to what she
[1:26:22] said God remembers her iniquities
[1:26:26] but God doesn't remember your iniquities
[1:26:29] however you probably as long as you live
[1:26:31] will remember your past
[1:26:33] is that right
[1:26:35] see when we get to heaven the Bible says
[1:26:36] the former things will not come to mind
[1:26:38] he won't be remembered anymore so the
[1:26:40] Bible says that even you over there
[1:26:42] won't have to worry about well you know
[1:26:44] I remember back on earth when I did this
[1:26:46] how many would say I don't want to
[1:26:48] remember that
[1:26:49] you know I don't know if they need a
[1:26:51] good thing but he says a lot all of that
[1:26:53] will be gone out of your mind the devil
[1:26:55] might try to play with you here but over
[1:26:57] there it'll be gone however on the other
[1:27:00] flip side of things in Hell remember the
[1:27:03] rich man was in hell
[1:27:05] and he remembered that Abraham reminded
[1:27:08] him of how he had it right and how
[1:27:11] Lazarus needed
[1:27:12] and so forth and he remembered
[1:27:15] everything I'd ever done that's what's
[1:27:17] going to torment people in Hell their
[1:27:19] memory won't be gone they'll remember
[1:27:20] how that they turned God away they'll
[1:27:23] remember all their bad they're all that
[1:27:24] memory because your memory how many of
[1:27:26] you remember it can haunt you
[1:27:28] amen that's why if he gets under the
[1:27:31] blood you'll be fine you can just tell
[1:27:32] the quit fishing and then you're late
[1:27:35] but for people that are lost remember
[1:27:37] they'll remember it over on that side
[1:27:40] and all through hell as long as they're
[1:27:42] in Hell they'll remember that and it'll
[1:27:43] be a torment to him amen aren't you glad
[1:27:46] that it can be gone in the sea of God's
[1:27:48] forgetfulness
[1:27:49] amen let's bow our heads
[1:27:52] Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and
[1:27:54] we just think of what we have said
