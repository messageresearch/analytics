amen God bless you good to have our visitor here amen with us so God bless you amen praise the Lord everybody happy amen I don't know why you wouldn't you should happiest people on the planet amen we got every reason to be amen so God is good isn't he amen God is so good and it's just a wonderful time to be a Christian amen and we want to continue our series would that be okay y want a little more amen praise the Lord I have been enjoying this amen and uh so with the help of God Brad good to see you better again amen praise the Lord praying sister Martha will just get over her cough and stuff amen so amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads and go before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight being thankful Lord Jesus to be assembled together again in your name for you have said God in your word that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst Lord and what a wonderful thought to know without a question Lord that you are in our midst and father I pray God that you'll just be the speaker tonight Lord help me just be the voice and just the mouthpiece that you use to speak to your people and each and everyone that is here tonight Lord and if there's any listening God we pray that you would speak to them also Father for we know that you're everpresent God lord we ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon a heart to minister we T ask God that you would just have the complete preeminence in it Lord have your way tonight for we ask it in Jesus name amen turn your bibles if you will we want to amen we want to basically speak about the devil's Storehouse tonight amen but I titled it God's Storehouse and the devil's Storehouse amen amen so you're going to buy something from one of those folks amen you're going to serve one or the other Master you don't have a choice ain't that right you're either going to serve God or you're going to serve the devil amen amen unfortunately there's too many people that try to do both ain't that right and just make a mockery of it amen we don't want to be those folks in between amen the lukewarm people lay out of sins amen that thought they were rich and increased with goods and had needed nothing but didn't know they were wretched miserable poor blind and naked amen want to talk about three different things with the help of the Lord tonight and we want to talk about clothing for just a minute then we want to talk about food and also about drink amen amen so um let me see let's go to the very same scripture I think we used last time um let me see where was it I'm thinking Jeremiah no Second Kings Second Kings 2 Kings 1 this was after ahab's son fell through lattice of course in the upper chamber and went and told his servants to inquire of be elub to God of eon whether he would recover of his disease wow how you want to ask the devil whether I'm going to recover what's he going to do for you he probably pushed you over to lus to begin with is that right so he ain't gonna give a flip whether you get better or not he has his way Jesus said he don't come but to kill and Destroy I'm telling you what the truth of it is the way some people think is just it's just mindboggling that right mindboggling how some people can think amen but verse three it says but the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that ye go to inquire of the Els above the god of erron notice there it says that ye go to inquire amen of theob the god of e so in other words amen instead of going to God they're going to the devil amen God bless you you can be seated tonight so once again I was thinking about God's Storehouse amen and I certainly didn't get anywhere close to being done with that but amen we uh perhaps will touch on it a little bit more tonight with the help of the Lord amen now how many believes that the Bible has told us well let me go back for just a minute we know that God told Brother random to store up food amen isn't that right to record the tapes record the tapes make messages and so forth and store up food for us amen and so he seen in the vision there was little great big things and very good food to eat so that we could have food here in the end time amen another place one place I believe he said you know when you see Jesus Christ coming and and like he did with the woman at the well Discerning the thoughts and the tents of her heart and telling she had five husbands and knowing that Christ did that in our age thousands of hundreds of thousands of times very same thing never never no fault it was perfect every time amen then brother Braham says you know if you when we see Christ doing that that should give us rapturing faith in other words it scatters all the darkness away amen I don't know about you but when a man comes up here and does and prove something that he says well if you don't believe the proof there's something just a little bit off Ain that right basically going down in the basement saying The Sun Ain't shining when the Sun's shining bright amen but praise the Lord amen so we look at this and I just wanted to read this here before we get started talking about amen we know that a Believer Jesus said whatsoever things you desire when you ask ask in my name and what did he say I will do it he says uh uh you know if you if you only believe all things are possible to them that believe amen so brother B puts it this way the trouble with Christians today if they don't realize what is provided for them many people doesn't realize that the great glories and Powers that's provided for them coming into Jesus Christ is like walking into an arcade down here or a great department store amen I didn't realize you know when I talked about I knew he had said something about Arcade but I didn't realize the department store amen so Christ when can you come into Christ it's like coming into a department store and I thought you know when I begin to think about Christ and all that he has in his store amen it's actually department departmental is that the right English word departmental or something you know Department you know what department means the different departments right and that's the way God is he has different departments in his great store amen there's the shoe department there's the clothing department there's the hunting Department there's the grocery department there's the food department there's this department there whatever department when you come into God's department store there's a lot of areas in our life where we have needs [Applause] amen oh come on how many knows that when you come into Christ Bible says that you're a joint heir of everything he has so when you come into the department store he doesn't say well go pick out a bunch of stuff he says this whole thing's yours go get what you want if you own it you can get what you want not only do you just go shopping folks you own the store let's realize what we got amen how many believe when the one place he said when the bride realizes who she is is the rapture take place woo God help me to realize Who I Am Lord I cuz I want going to leave this place don't you all things possible to them to believe amen praise the Lord oh my that's right now notice if somebody gave me a great department store down here great arcade and told me that this is all yours well the first thing I do I want to walk around and found out what I own what was mine that's the way it is with Christ when you become a Christian walk around find out what's yours all things are yours given to you freely Paul said things present things in the past and no matter what it is Life Death all things are yours Paul said everything's yours I just said it that way to let it sink in Lord let that sink in everything your whatever you have need of how many knows when you come into God's store everything that you have need of is already Supply agent Thomas Bor don't have to pray for you preacher don't have to do nothing for you huh oh it's nice when they do sometimes we need that extra boost n pray with me I want to believe it but you don't have to it's yours already if you can receive it every devil is under you doesn't matter what it is amen and if he isn't just work a little harder say God get me I want that devil down there like I said I think it was Sunday you know boo him until he gets so tiny he's a flee in the carpet and you'll have to get a microf GL you know he's just out of sight so to speak he doesn't bother you anymore smoking doesn't bother you anymore drinking don't bother you anymore but don't bother you anymore greed doesn't bother you you anymore anxiety doesn't pop hello that's how I like the devil just out of sight out of mind gone amen and every time he comes just zap him with a 250 volt whatever a th000 volt that right how do you do it get do I get behind me Satan just get on out of here cuz the devil has a grocery store and and God has a grocery store so to speak or Department stord they both have stores amen God said bring my bring the tithe into my Storehouse that there may be food in my house amen my Storehouse God has a storehouse amen that's what you come here tonight for what' you come for to feed food how many knows food is one of the most important things in the world what's more important than the what's more important than food water amen that's why he says let him that let let the the spirit and the bride say come and he that is a thirst one of the last verses in the whole Bible God said he let him that is a thirst come and drink of the Waters of Life freely I like that because I'll tell you what if you quit drinking you'll die so really water could be considered the water of life amen the Lord I thought that was good praise the Lord now notice walk around see what's yours all things are yours and not only that but you've been given a checkbook with jesus' name signed across there saying whatever you send this check back to the father whatever you ask in the father's name that I'll do so don't be scared to fill it out and also how many knows that you are allowed to ask for big things matter why Prophet God said ask for big things ask ask for the baptism of the Holy Ghost ask God to save you cuz the biggest Miracle level happen is for a person to get saved and have their nature changed amen ask for your children ask for ask for 10,000 worlds worth if you ask for 10,000 worlds worth you're asking for one person's soul that right so when hady Wright was given the power by the prophet God says tell her to ask what she wants how many know brother B would never say that of himself no but he said tell her to ask what she wants well you're poor you could ask for money you know have this child I think was needed healing this that or the other but she asked for the Salvation of her two children two little Ras Rascal making fun him on boys and guess what them boys fell under conviction didn't they immediately I want you to know they had so much conviction until didn't they I know what it was cuz I I believe it was I'm set and see if if I'm a prophet of God see if it don't fall in your lap didn't they come over and fall in her lap that's right so much conviction and felt so bad for how they had their mama and they really wanted to give their heart to God they went on their on their lap amen I don't care you know I don't care anybody could disputed uh however they want to this that or the other I believe God I believe they'll be there amen praise the Lord you love him tonight amen praise the Lord now notice how many knows uh that we're actually coming to the climax of it all now I've preached it but ran across and quote of it butam says Genesis is a planting of the seed and 66,000 years has been the maturing to the Harvest amen and the true church that started in Genesis has come down to the fruit time the fruit amen and the Antichrist that started in Genesis is come down to its fruit and we're just uh in the closing time of the whole world's dispensation or Mortal beings so we're coming down to the very end amen that's what we preached before is that we see that evil and those things like that how did they're coming to maturity in other words they don't even want any policemen anymore they don't want no law they don't want no rules huh that's what they want go back and look under under lawlessness but B says this age will go into lawlessness amen Lawless that's right no law just lead AIA floating and drifting and being tossed with every evil spirit that comes upon them amen but I like this other part and this is kind of off the subject but let me just finish here now notice he says and we're just in the closing time listen and it's the greatest time that anyone or that any age has ever lived is this time oh it's a shaking time it's a Troublesome time for Sinners but it's a marvelous time for Christians cuz why the more we see the world going into complete chaos into complete moral Decay and you feel yourself getting closer to God you realize that we're almost there huh just like going somewhere on a trip are we there yet are we there yet no we got a few miles the back go oh we're almost there we're almost there and that's like what we are that's what we ought to be tonight oh wow this is the greatest time Paul waited for this Arenas waited for this all of them waited they thought it was coming into our day their day but they've been in a place to where it's perfect for him amen they're not bored huh you're not getting impatient however it is over there it's so Sublime isn't that right what the brother Ram said it's so Sublime until it's perfect contentment perfect satisfaction amen amen but you and I am we have to finish the journey okay like I said it's kind of off the subject but when I ran across this am mean I really liked it amen because it is the greatest time for the believer amen we are because we know we are ping up or gathering up the last little efforts to go home to meet the Lord amen let's talk about clothing first I was thinking the other day brother B talked much about it coming down to the river Jordan come down close to close to the coming of the Lord amen and if you leave out of this world and go out of this world or come down to your deathbed or you get in a wreck and men and you are there and bleeding out dying injured so bad you're dying [Music] amen there's some things that you're going to think about amen how you've lived what you've done what's up for you next amen because we have a tendency to think so much about these natural things here when our focus our main focus should constantly be for the other world for what lays ahead and I believe B was one brother B talked about what was the greatest time of his life amen was it a great meeting was healing and this out of the other he says this is it this is the greatest time of my this is what I've been looking for that's why in his death but he could say that's what I'm looking for because he had what he had need of amen amen before we go in to talking about some of the Devils I want to go Amen to Revelations and talk about clothing one of the uh one of the main one of our things that we have to H have and it's something that he uh Jesus said in verse 18 but I I want to go to chapter three and I W to begin with verse four he was talking to the Sardis Church age I believe it was thou H has a few names even in sards which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy amen praise the Lord he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life his name before my father and before his angels in verse 18 to the layout of sins amen of course we know how they were they were lukewarm verse 16 neither cold nor hot they thought they were Rich increased with Goods they thought they had need of nothing didn't know that they were wretched that they were miserable that they were poor blind and they were naked Amen to be without Christ to die without Christ is the most horrible thing that a person can ever do brother bam said he uh has seen people burn up and cars perhaps and all kinds of ways that they went he said but the worst way that he's ever seen people go was to die without knowing god now notice here I counsel thee to buy of me go try in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Raymond notice what you're buying amen you're also buying this white rayment amen now notice he says buy of me go old tried in the fire now we all I've always thought of this as the character that we have cuz we know that amen uh I think was Peter said the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold of that perishes and so forth and that gold is a Christlike character I believe brother bam said in the church age but you know there's another way that we could look at this and that is I counsel thee to buy of me gold which also we know that gold represents what deity right deity tried in the fire how many knows that the life of Jesus Christ was tried in every way it was deity that was tried and the character that you get is his character you get that gold you get his character and that's what we are dressed in that is our clothing is his Christlike character and make that your number one goal from here on out say God that's what I want I want to be dressed doesn't matter if you come tonight tomorrow morning I want to be dressed in the goal of your character amen because I don't want to come down to that day and not have anything on Amen basically be found naked amen be a terrible thing to be found naked amen white Raymond no notice that that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy naked do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see amen so we want to make sure that we are clothed in God's righteousness in God's character Washed by the blood of Jesus Christ ready to go at any time amen as your pastor I would say we never know when we're going to go amen and I want each and every one of you to be ready subject number two amen is going to be found in Jeremiah 2 and we going to talk a little bit about water drink amen now this is going to be interesting because remember that is the number one thing that we have to have to live and that is water okay Jeremiah 2 and verse 11 hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit be astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate sayeth the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and heue them out systemns broken ssts that can hold no water most of my rest of my subject is going to be out of the message called broken sisters amen amen now this is another I I want to say this that I truly believe to me this is one of the great fruits this is one of the big vegetables that the brother bam seen when he stored up food amen it was called the message of thirst he explains amen the basic need of all humans is that right me and why they do I'm going to fixing the read you why people do what they do amen butam says it this way now what makes a fellow then thirst what makes him thirst there's a reason for that what makes people want to drink what makes people want to be untrue and live untrue what makes them desire to join churches that indulge in such things as playing cards smoking cigarettes and all these other kinds of things like that it's because God has made man to thirst he made you to thirst in other words he made us in such a way that we we we we were made to worship something we were made unlike a cow that is completely happy mooing all its life yeah a sheep that's completely satisfied bad all the time dog just all my if he gets to bark he's happy all of the animal kingdom they're all happy but man is not happy never satisfied are they that's right no they're never satisfied God made it that way because one thing he gave him a conscience he gave him a soul and he give you a mind that is Way Beyond theirs and right give you a mind to understand Good and Evil amen and up until the age of about 10 11 years old he was just as happy as a child ain't that right oh my you know sometimes they can't hardly contain their Joy but when sin comes along evil comes along doing wrong comes along amen then you begin to amen have a burden on you an emptiness that has to be fulfilled every human being was made to desire fulfillment because he's empty amen and that creates a thirst a need so to speak and there's a lot of different areas I was thinking today of all of our passions and all of the seed taste field here uh reason affection and and and wanting satisfaction wanting comfort and wanting peace and all of these all of these things all of these feelings man if you just let that all go man you're going to be going every which direction how many believ that has to be come down under under the control of one thing amen and I like what brother bam says he says all of these things that the devil offers in his store I call it his substitution his store of substitution that's the devil's Storehouse because he offers everybody a substitute something other than what they really need because when you come to the house of God how many know you get something that's absolutely going to F your need when you come to Christ it's an original it's not a Subs it's not a hybrid not to mention man you've got to watch this stuff it is deceiving he'll poison you he he'll sell you stuff that you think is good for you and it kills you right yeah he's a he boy you want to stay out of that store but Millions like like it Millions like his store you know why Millions like his store is because in his store they still get to do what they want to do amen ma ma my but he made it listen that's why people do what they do and that's why you do thirst he made you but he made you to thirst after him he made you that way and that thirst was made in you to thirst after him but the devil perverted it and he tries to satisfy you with all kinds of substitut I don't care what you drink I don't believe there's anything that'll substitute for water amen nothing satisfies like pure water isn't it amazing how we learned that you know it's not good to drink C water because of the junk that they put in it so now man we will pay $2 a bottle for a bottle of water if we need to amen because we want something that's good amen but people won't go to a church that preaches the truth they'd rather go to a church where the preacher always just doesn't defend anybody that's right huh CU people like that if you don't step on their toes that's right now notice in trying to make you be satisfied with trying to quench that blessed thirst with sin he says you have no right to quench that blessed holy thirst with drinking or waiting in sin you remember that God made you to come thirst after him in righteousness and the devil turns it around and there's many things that he tries to quench it with oh yeah let me go just over a couple that he says that's the reason people don't go to church on Wednesday night no more you'd rather stay home and we'll look at some old dirty television of we love Susy hey we love Lucy I believe it was CU he didn't know for sure what it was has robbed many of churches of people on Wednesday night because they loved Lucy more than they loveed God brother M said in many places he says but my favorite show is on listen to this oh and then we say you love God no wonder we can't have a Revival in America amen how many can say if you love we love Luc You're Something of the world it's going to be hard to have a Revival watching We Love Lucy or anything else are you with me oh my praise the Lord some people they think it's to make money that's life make money plenty of it after a while you lose it and then you take a pistol and blow your brains out that can't be life that's death some people think that they're young and gay and running out and dancers of things cutting up carrying on in all you think about all the clubs and all the rocket roll and all the lights and all the music and all that they think that's life this is what brother B because next morning you wake up with a headache broke up homes that's not life that's death disguised that's what he called it that's death in Disguise wake up the next morning oh my head what happened last night I don't know what what I acted a fool I man well you know I I feel terrible but I me when you go to God store about 6:00 in the morning 7:00 in the morning that's the best time that we got get up and say Lord thank you for a good night rest I feel good amen I got intoxicated last night jge we had a good time and I'm telling you I'm still feeling some leftovers from it come about 8 9:00 it don't matter for a Believer he's still drunk on the Holy Ghost and he feels good aren't you glad for that I put you got rather have the God's store that's right cutting up next morning headache that's death in Disguise that's the wolf in sheep's clothes that cannot be life that's death and the world's deceived by those things how many know that's what they think satisfies that don't don't none of those things satisfy amen I'm drinking right now are you drinking are you drinking praise the Lord feeling better are you feeling better when you came in well glory to God you must be drinking keep on drinking amen what is brother B says I've been drunk for 30 some years I've been drinking for 30 some years I had a good drink today I'm here to tell you I went into the upper room not the wine Celler but in the upper room up there got the drinking pretty good I'm telling you amen still feeling the effects of it I thought this was going to be short tonight but it's not looking

W Glory I'm me enjoy God's Great creation all right but we're gonna take our time tonight is that okay that's death disguised that's right that's what he's got big old cans of oh pleasure ain't that right I mean everybody likes to have a little fun everybody wants pled everybody wants satisfaction everybody wants to have good time everybody wants Joy I don't know about you but I just I wonder what's wrong with you brother Pete if you don't want to be happy what is wrong with you who doesn't want to be happy the whole world everybody wants to be happy that's why they drink that's why they get a 12 pack huh that's why to get another power to get a big a fifth they want to I feel good when they feel terrible they broke your wife divorced them huh do he do everybody wants to feel good and the devil offers them a temporary substitute that's not life it's f oh my next day they want to shoot themselves they feel so horrible I'm glad that drinking the Holy Ghost is something you can drink all you want of and you never get a headache from it you never feel bad from it oh my I think we're on a good subject tonight that's right dances and things carrying on immoral that's right now down The Whole World's deceived by those things but the question is my brother and my sister what makes men and women do that if they're mentally right what makes them do that what makes them crave to drink whiskey what makes America want to smoke cigarettes and so forth oh my they seek and suck on those things for pleasure something's wrong what is it they can't help it oh my and if the devil can't get you all twisted up with some of that he'll take you to church somewhere and get to get you away from it he just uh and you'll be just as bad off millions of them going to church be this be that but they still want to wear their shorts they still want to smoke their cigarettes they still want to do this that or the other so they find a substitute to church if you don't want to be just a rank Sinner and a whiskey Drinker God will offer you a place in church just don't get born again just like he offered Jesus a substitute this store was offered to Jesus and you know y'all off for the whole world like you can have all the kingdoms if you just don't go to Calvary if you just B of me you can have it in a different way oh my think about that guy that come up into marriage and of remember a wedding and he didn't have a garment up and he came up some other way I'm here to tell you that a majority of people want to come up some other way that's the devil's way that's what he offers him some other [Music] way folks I seen people that wanted to get something done they wanted to do something they want to see something happen they wouldn't wait on the Lord whatever they got to do evil not evil whatever it is some other way let's get it done that's the devil for you that's the devil for you that's what he offers you amen I want God's way I want God to do it praise the Lord lead me on Lord amen that's right so think about it the sick suck on those things and it doesn't never satisfy amen remember the woman at the well come give me a drink oh I'm a Samaritan you know it's not proper you know but if I would have known who I am you would have asked me would have asked him and he would have given the Living [Laughter] Water W huh think about it it's water that gives you life folks that old old old man preacher they come up there better B said and begin to preach a little bit about oh my the the the the rainbow and everything else and Jo world my he got this shouting and jumping and it'll make an old Eagle come to life gives you life Holy Ghost gives you life hello people we come to church we ain't got no Holy Ghost and oh my we just sit here like a bump on the law oh this is so boring huh let me tell you something life without the Holy Ghost is boring Church without the Holy Ghost is boring Church without the Holy Ghost is did you hear that Mouse quiet you can hear mouth amen the Holy Ghost brings life it's the Water of Life come let him come the bride says if you're thirsty come oh my this this evening this preacher if the whole world was listening I say world come if you're thirsty and get a drink that'll satisfy you but you don't want it cuz you still want your own habits and your old way because you love Darkness but yet you still have that thirst in you same as the Indians did same as the heathens do they still have that thirst they still want to worship a God Amen but they still want to have their own way amen not the bride we don't want to have any of our own way go back and listen to and I thought about preaching on this but God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief churches that are lukewarm that's what the devil offers in his grocery store lukewarmness this don't matter that don't matter God don't know care about this yes God does for the believer when we come to the house of God and his da we know that everything matters every thought that goes through my mind matters right bringing every thought captive bringing every action captive everything matters don't matter if you baptized this way don't matter this you a bunch of don't matter huh the devil offers a bunch of no don't matter bottles to drink from needs to have an inscription down at the bottom the Surgeon General has given you a warning that this is a lie huh this is a lie it might be a white lie it might be 99% truth but it's still a lie because that's what the devil gives people lies deceit amen oh my I like it listen to what he said let me let me finish the story I haven't even read it now have I no this woman Living Waters and verse 13 Jesus answer us and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water but whosoever drink of the water that I shall give him shall never somebody Say Never Never thirst amen but the water shall that I shall give him shall be in him amen a well of water springing up into everlasting life so when he gives you what he don't just give you water he gives you a well he gives you a well that's constantly springing up that's right on a Wednesday night a cold Wednesday night it's still going to be bubbling up if it ain't then you need to drink a little more of that type of water cuz this type of water is a constant flowing water it don't stop on Wednesday night when you leave it don't stop on Sunday when you leave it is constantly flowing for the believer amen praise be to God I like that that's what we need people that have a well in them where the water is constantly flowing amen it's about time to close but are you ready for the good stuff we're just getting there amen listen there's a little place in the heart that nothing will fill it but God and man is thirsting for something that real thirst is for God nobody's got a right to try to quench that Holy thirst with giving it to the devil for the things of the world amen you've got no right trying to hide that Thirst by joining a church God's the only thing that'll fill that up amen the holy spirit is the only thing that'll satisfy that thirst amen blessed are today Jesus said that hunger and thirst after right they shall be filled and it's God trying to get to the human heart and the devil to quench that by letting them drink theirself to death or run themselves to death or do something else but God created man to have that Holy thirst amen praise the Lord and the devil will try to give you stuff to just try to appease amen amen let's talk about the sistern for a minute I notice the sister is usually where people doesn't have a well they get a sistern in other words a sistern is a man-made tank or a manmade well in the ground that men dig out to use some of them use it for wash water and drinking water and so forth until all the water sometimes that we used to get was from a sistern amen well notice one thing about a sistern that's different from a well a sistern will get empty that sistern cannot fill it s it's not reliable you can't rely upon a sister now remember denominations are sisters J manmade sisters any church that isn't driven and powerered by the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ is a sistern manmade amen you can't rely Ry Upon A sistern it has to rely upon the rains that fall in the summer and so forth usually in the winter time when the snow or the rain comes see that's the only time that they get water Amen Let me I think I'm going to read this again a little bit later now notice if you'll notice another thing about a sister it's usually comes from a barn that's twice the size of a house usually the Runs run the water runs off the barn to a sister now remember we had grain pipes coming off of that Barn so of the water is carried off of the roof where the animals stepping around through the staple yards and so forth the filth of the Barnyard settles on top of that Barn in dry times and that water comes down and washes on off the roof that's manmade amen and then a man-made spout to a manmade sister and boy if you haven't got a mess I don't know what you have got amen I thought about you know you go up on there and they get it off the roof you know I don't know about you but we always have Sparrow sitting up there there's birds that's and have their Dum all over the roof dead bugs everywhere amen the the dust from the patties of the cows up there and it all watches down there and you get a big old cup full and you say yum yum huh sounds pretty gross but people like it they're like I like that flavor that's actually what people do now spiritually speaking okay spiritually speaking naturally I'm doubt they would do that fiercely people will drink from such huh you mix a little bit of well you sisters if you want to just wear real tight dresses and have all the men looking at you you Brothers want to wear a pair of shorts and them had little chew I I don't think that be anything wrong with that little bit more manure on that huh well baptizing father son the holy ghost that really don't matter a little bit more door huh mix that up with a little bit of well I think we ought to be inclusive big big chunk of stuff right there huh you mix that all together huh and what you got You' have got some kind of mess have y'all seen that woman I wish I remember her names I've seen her on YouTube but she had had to have her lips done woman preacher getting up there and man she had the biggest blowup job and everything else and you talk about a mess I don't care if she hears it that is some really devil possessed stuff right there huh you have got you a real mess people but people love it why amen my that's right it's all man-made that's a whole lot like our church this St today brother B say I think that we have left one of the great sins that the church has done today just like Israel did then it left him the Fountain of Living Water and they heed themselves out man-made sisters and it has become the habitation of everything that love that kind of water lizards and frogs and unclean germs come in that man-made tank in this tank of these things say oh my what a perfect of our example of our denominations to day amen oh you say brother Brandon why do you strike it though so hard it ought to be struck out it's got to be struck out flee it because it'll finally end up in the mark of the beast think about back in the 60s he said those churches man they're full of Filth they come the The Habit the what is it has become the habitation of every unclean and hateful bird they've become exactly what the prophet of God said they do amen amen lovers of such things they love that stuff amen my leaving the artisian well for a man-made sistern could you imagine someone doing that could you imagine the mental conditions of a person that could drink at a fresh Arian well and would leave that for a man-made sister with fall and lizards and wiggle tails and everything else it don't seem sensibly right but that's just exactly what the people has done they have left the word the true Fountain of God source of power to drink out of systems and make themselves sisters amen that's the way it is with a lot of these parasites today man they can't live in fresh waterer by the holy spirit amen people can't hear the true unadulterated word of God they can't handle that no they don't want that this church would be full if they could how many believe it sure but they don't want that they like a man-made s they like what I call water that's setting Stillen brother Troy I don't know about you but when I see a water that's setting still and it gets all that green moss across it isn't it just wonderful to go out on and dive into that moss and just dive into the Slime and get all over you no but that's what they do they love slime they like that slimy stuff get all in their head and their face and I just love my shorts I just love my bad television my bad show I just love my snuff I love my cigarette the preacher don't never say I can't do it as a matter of fact that Jo M past the pastor study we have one tomorrow more together I like this church huh they love slime they're wiggle Tails huh is that what the prophet said why that's what the devil has in his store he offers him that this you can have you can claim to be reled just come in here and preach Jesus oh he died for us 2,000 years ago oh the homosexuals he died for us he died for us all and try to justify their [Applause] lifestyle amen could to coming to church people going into the denomination going to the church and churches when Jesus Christ came and Vindicated himself like he you know like he did when he was here on Earth thousands and thousands but they won't believe it huh why because they're living in the glare of another age I mean know people love to live in a mirage remember when Israel got their food and the quickles fell he said they couldn't keep it overnight cuz the next day they had wiggle tails in it you can't live by yesterday's message by yesterday you've got to live by the god of today those those Pharisees they were living by the god out of another rage amen got wiggle tails in it maggots don't you just love when you eat half a piece of bread or a sandwich and about halfway through you find a big old piece of mold on your bread you're like I know I know I makes me huh that's right can't digest those things amen you love him I love it Jesus said one place he said listen to this and Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth light his life unto the world then said they unto him Lord ever more give us of this bread and Jesus said unto them to them I am the bread of life how many believes he is the Water of Life he is the bread of life amen he said if you drink this water you'll never thirst again he that cometh to me shall never hunger W and he that believeth on me shall never thirst aren't you glad to be a satisfied God believer today knowing there's a whale coming up and man I'm telling you it's constantly flowing constantly coming up let me close with this here last quote amen we want to talk about the Fountain of Life for a minute we want to hear about that
