[59:54] Jude the third verse
[59:56] and then we're going to look over into
[59:58] Deuteronomy for another scripture
[59:59] reading
[1:00:00] amen we're going to speak to you for for
[1:00:03] a bit today on on Defenders of the
[1:00:07] landmarks
[1:00:08] Defenders of the landmarks hey man I
[1:00:11] believe that we had a mighty conqueror
[1:00:14] that came and and stood for us and
[1:00:16] fought for us and now I believe there's
[1:00:18] going to be a people that will stand for
[1:00:19] him and fight for him in this day amen
[1:00:21] and and fight for truth and stand for
[1:00:23] truth wherever that battle may take us
[1:00:25] we believe Lord Lord that he's going to
[1:00:28] go before us and the Book of Jude the
[1:00:30] third chapter says beloved
[1:00:32] when I gave all dude all diligence to
[1:00:35] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:00:38] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:00:41] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:00:44] contend for the faith which was once
[1:00:48] delivered unto the Saints we're also
[1:00:52] going to look over in Deuteronomy 19 and
[1:00:55] the 14th verse
[1:00:58] you'll see as we
[1:01:00] go through today that is as I laid
[1:01:03] before the Lord last night and looked at
[1:01:04] different things that it ended up coming
[1:01:06] back into the same channel some of the
[1:01:09] same similar thoughts as we dealt with
[1:01:10] last night Deuteronomy 19 and the 14th
[1:01:15] verse
[1:01:17] says Thou shalt not remove thy
[1:01:20] neighbor's landmark
[1:01:22] which day of old time have set in thine
[1:01:26] inheritance which Thou shalt inherit in
[1:01:29] the land that the Lord thy God giveth
[1:01:33] thee to possess it also in chapter 27 17
[1:01:38] it says this cursed be the man
[1:01:42] that remove his neighbor's landmark
[1:01:45] and all the people shall say amen amen
[1:01:49] you may have your seats this morning
[1:01:51] pray that the Lord will add His
[1:01:52] blessings to the reading of the of the
[1:01:55] word look at that again verse 17 curse
[1:01:58] it be he that removeth his neighbor's
[1:02:02] Landmark brother Branham says that is
[1:02:05] the history of the church when it thinks
[1:02:08] more of conforming to the world instead
[1:02:10] of conforming to God it isn't long until
[1:02:13] you see them stop doing things they used
[1:02:16] to do and start doing things they
[1:02:18] wouldn't do initially they changed their
[1:02:22] manner of dress their attitudes and
[1:02:25] their behavior they get lacks I mean I
[1:02:28] think it's very important that today
[1:02:30] that we we check up ourselves and make
[1:02:32] sure that there's no laxeness in US make
[1:02:34] sure that those that we haven't relaxed
[1:02:36] amen looking back at Jude verse 3 we're
[1:02:39] instructed to contend for the faith that
[1:02:41] was once delivered the way this was
[1:02:43] would word it here show shows us that
[1:02:46] the relaxing or the slide that took
[1:02:48] place in the very first church age has
[1:02:51] already started they've already begun to
[1:02:53] slide a bit and and we know that this
[1:02:55] age means that the the word Ephesus
[1:02:58] means aimed at but relaxed amen because
[1:03:01] we know it's already happening because
[1:03:03] Jude is pointing back already saying
[1:03:06] that we got to contend for the faith
[1:03:07] that was once delivered in other words
[1:03:10] he's recognizing that things have
[1:03:12] changed and he's pointing back even
[1:03:14] though they've only it's only been a few
[1:03:16] years from the inauguration of the
[1:03:17] church it's only been a few years since
[1:03:19] the day of Pentecost he's already saying
[1:03:22] we've got to contend for how things were
[1:03:24] once delivered amen and and contend here
[1:03:28] the word means to strive or by in
[1:03:31] contest or against difficulties now
[1:03:35] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:03:37] only way to know what faith we are to
[1:03:39] contend for is to look back at what Jude
[1:03:42] was talking about and look at the faith
[1:03:44] that Jude was told talking about and
[1:03:46] then that and that we could gain
[1:03:47] instruction on what it is we are to
[1:03:49] contend for now this is only brother
[1:03:51] Brown would tell us this is only 33
[1:03:53] years after Pentecost and Jude here he's
[1:03:57] a Christian so he's not pointing back to
[1:03:59] some levitical law he's not saying we
[1:04:01] got to get back to the Old Testament
[1:04:03] he's not pointing all the way back to
[1:04:04] that he's pointing back to the day of
[1:04:07] Pentecost brother Branham says he's
[1:04:09] pointing back to the inauguration of the
[1:04:12] church on the day of Pentecost he says
[1:04:15] this now if we can find out what kind of
[1:04:17] Faith now remember this is just 33 years
[1:04:21] after the inauguration of the church at
[1:04:22] Pentecost 33 years later there has been
[1:04:25] such a falling away until Jude here
[1:04:28] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:04:30] is sending the letter to the churches to
[1:04:33] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:04:35] once delivered to the Saints he says now
[1:04:38] if we can only find out what kind of
[1:04:40] Faith the first Saints had then we can
[1:04:44] find out what kind under faith we are to
[1:04:47] contend for amen listen there's a lot of
[1:04:49] people willing to contend there's a lot
[1:04:51] of people even in the nominal world that
[1:04:53] are willing to contend for their faith
[1:04:55] they're willing to stand up for what
[1:04:56] they believe in and then there's many
[1:04:58] that aren't afraid to stand but they
[1:05:00] don't know what kind of faith it is that
[1:05:03] they're supposed to be contending for
[1:05:05] amen and that they may have Parts they
[1:05:08] may have truths and they are contending
[1:05:10] for for what they know but they are not
[1:05:13] contending for the faith that was once
[1:05:15] delivered amen and that's what we want
[1:05:17] to contend for today is for the faith
[1:05:19] that was once delivered brother Brown
[1:05:21] says we must remember what kind of Faith
[1:05:24] was it now listen closely we want to
[1:05:26] bring this down early on in our in our
[1:05:28] subject today let's just think about it
[1:05:30] oh well the first thing a person ought
[1:05:33] to do is think of the first subject the
[1:05:35] first thing is we must repent
[1:05:37] the disciples taught repentance water
[1:05:40] baptism Divine Healing resurrection of
[1:05:43] the Dead manifestation of the power of
[1:05:45] the Holy Holy Ghost signs and wonders
[1:05:48] spoke with tongues interpreted tongues
[1:05:50] cast out Devils healed the sick open the
[1:05:53] blinded eyes saw Visions is that right
[1:05:56] well this is 1900 years later and we're
[1:06:00] still contending for the faith that was
[1:06:03] once delivered to the Saints and God is
[1:06:06] confirming it he says amen he says now
[1:06:10] he also promised that there would be a
[1:06:13] restoring of the faith Hallelujah he
[1:06:15] says we read over in Jude that Jude said
[1:06:18] earnestly content for the faith that was
[1:06:19] once delivered to the Saints now we are
[1:06:22] promised in Malachi 4 by the same system
[1:06:24] he always did that we would be restored
[1:06:27] back to the original Faith oh my back to
[1:06:30] the original seed back to the seed like
[1:06:33] it began on the day of Pentecost back to
[1:06:36] the same Doctrine word by word Power by
[1:06:39] power Spirit by the same thing just
[1:06:43] exactly like it was back in the
[1:06:45] beginning through signs and wonders of
[1:06:47] the living presence of Jesus Christ
[1:06:50] listen I say like Moses and the people
[1:06:52] it's the presence of the Lord doesn't go
[1:06:55] before us don't send me I gotta have his
[1:06:58] presence I gotta see it moving I gotta
[1:07:00] have it today more than I did yesterday
[1:07:01] you're not gonna make it out of this
[1:07:03] world without his presence you're not
[1:07:06] gonna make it out of this world without
[1:07:08] the faith that was once delivered on to
[1:07:10] the Saints I say Lord I need your
[1:07:13] presence Lord others may not need it but
[1:07:15] I need it today I need it moving in my
[1:07:17] life I need it moving in my home I need
[1:07:19] it moving in our church services amen
[1:07:22] amen we're not contending for a dead
[1:07:25] letter
[1:07:26] well we're not contending for just
[1:07:28] correct Doctrine although we should
[1:07:30] but that's not all it is we're not just
[1:07:33] contending for correct Doctrine but
[1:07:34] we're to contend for the faith exactly
[1:07:37] how it was delivered in the first age
[1:07:39] brother Brandon would tell us over and
[1:07:41] over again that if that vine ever put
[1:07:44] forth another branch that it would write
[1:07:46] another book of Acts behind it amen
[1:07:49] another book of Acts where demons are
[1:07:51] subject to the word of God where demons
[1:07:54] are cast out we're the sick are healed
[1:07:56] where people are filled with the baptism
[1:07:58] of the Holy Ghost that's what I'm
[1:07:59] looking for today is another book of
[1:08:02] Acts listen it's already been written
[1:08:03] it's in the word but what about your
[1:08:05] chapter what about the chapter that
[1:08:07] tells about your life what about the
[1:08:09] chapter that tells about your victories
[1:08:11] that's another book of Acts because it's
[1:08:14] going to tell a brother Matt mccard and
[1:08:16] his victories it's going to tell of
[1:08:18] other brothers and their pictures and
[1:08:20] how they overcame but how's it going to
[1:08:22] happen by the same faith that was once
[1:08:25] delivered unto the Saints amen
[1:08:28] that's what we're contending for as
[1:08:30] Believers today
[1:08:31] we're contending that he is the same
[1:08:34] yesterday today and forever how many
[1:08:36] will contend for that that he is the
[1:08:38] same we're contending that our God still
[1:08:41] heals you got a sickness in your body
[1:08:43] today our God still heals the same as he
[1:08:46] always has you got a spirit of
[1:08:48] Affliction in your body our God is the
[1:08:50] same deliverer that he's always been
[1:08:52] we're contending that our God still
[1:08:54] moves and services we're contending for
[1:08:57] freedom of worship we're contending that
[1:09:00] that is still an act to Upper Room
[1:09:02] experience that is yours to have amen
[1:09:04] we're contending today
[1:09:07] and the reason that we have to contend
[1:09:09] is because there is a spirit
[1:09:12] that opposes that faith
[1:09:19] there is a spirit that's been there from
[1:09:21] the very beginning
[1:09:23] and it's come as in and it comes to rob
[1:09:26] that Faith No it's not just going to rob
[1:09:28] any faith it doesn't mind listen the
[1:09:30] devil don't mind you coming to church
[1:09:33] he doesn't mind that if nothing ever
[1:09:35] moves and nothing ever changes and it's
[1:09:37] just a ritual and it's cold and formal
[1:09:39] he doesn't care listen the devil don't
[1:09:41] miss church right
[1:09:43] he's here every service
[1:09:45] so he don't mind you coming to church he
[1:09:47] mind you getting that life spring of
[1:09:49] Living Water he mind you coming in
[1:09:51] contact with the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:53] Ghost he mines when your life is going
[1:09:55] to get changed and so he tries to rob
[1:09:57] that out of our services and out of our
[1:09:59] homes and out of our experiences
[1:10:02] brother Brown says now remember this
[1:10:04] Christ in the true church is a
[1:10:06] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:10:09] Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:10:11] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:10:13] church and defile it how how is it going
[1:10:16] to defile the church making it lukewarm
[1:10:19] formal and Powerless
[1:10:23] now listen it's a very subtle Spirit he
[1:10:26] doesn't run up here and go hey I'm the
[1:10:28] devil
[1:10:30] I want you to be formal I want you to be
[1:10:33] no no it's a very it's a very subtle
[1:10:34] Spirit sometimes it'll use quotes
[1:10:38] sometimes they'll use scriptures
[1:10:41] and it'll come and it'll come in in a
[1:10:43] way and it'll attack the faith and it'll
[1:10:45] try to drain the life out of the church
[1:10:47] and it'll be so close that it'll deceive
[1:10:50] the very elect
[1:10:52] if possible if possible if possible
[1:10:56] listen some people read that and they
[1:10:58] get a little bit shook up oh it's going
[1:10:59] to be so close it's gonna that's not the
[1:11:01] part I focus on I focus I focus on the
[1:11:04] fact that we're not going to be deceived
[1:11:06] we can't be deceived it is possible it's
[1:11:09] possible but it's not possible today the
[1:11:12] elect will not be deceived oh that
[1:11:16] scripture doesn't worry me now that
[1:11:18] scripture excites me it's going to be
[1:11:19] close but I'm gonna overcome it's gonna
[1:11:22] be close but we're going to make it
[1:11:23] through it's going to be close but we
[1:11:25] will not be deceived we're predestinated
[1:11:28] not to be Hallelujah
[1:11:31] it's not a scary thought
[1:11:34] but there is a bribe that will recognize
[1:11:36] and withstand the Antichrist spirit in
[1:11:39] this day
[1:11:40] withstand the Antichrist Spirit but
[1:11:42] overcome the Antichrist Spirit there's
[1:11:45] gonna be a bride on this Earth turn back
[1:11:47] to the faith the faith that we're to be
[1:11:50] continuing for turned back by Malachi 4
[1:11:53] she's going to be found not only turned
[1:11:55] back to it but producing the same Works
[1:11:58] operating in the same power that that
[1:12:00] Faith produced there in the book of Acts
[1:12:03] amen amen
[1:12:06] listen this ride will by no means be a
[1:12:08] lukewarm there is going to be life in
[1:12:11] this bride there is going to be
[1:12:13] overcoming power in this ride there is
[1:12:15] going to be healing there is gonna be
[1:12:17] Deliverance there is going to be
[1:12:19] salvation there is going to be holy
[1:12:21] ghost out points oh come on I say this
[1:12:23] morning could be one I say Lord pour it
[1:12:25] out this morning we don't gotta wait it
[1:12:27] don't got to be a certain time right now
[1:12:29] there are gonna be holy ghost
[1:12:30] outpourings that is going to produce
[1:12:32] overcoming lives listen I'm all about
[1:12:36] the emotion you've probably figured that
[1:12:37] out by now I'm about to jump and I'm
[1:12:40] about to shout and I'm about all those
[1:12:41] things but at the end of it it will
[1:12:43] produce an overcoming Victorious Life
[1:12:47] That's what I'm looking for get excited
[1:12:49] I'm excited you can jump you can shout
[1:12:52] you can run around this building I might
[1:12:54] take a lap with you but when you walk
[1:12:55] out this door Square your shoulders back
[1:12:58] and say I'm an overcomer I'm the Bride
[1:13:00] of Jesus Christ like that cat that fell
[1:13:02] in the wall where's that devil at now
[1:13:05] I'll give him no rest I will not allow
[1:13:08] him to enjoy one day in his eating
[1:13:11] because this will produce overcoming
[1:13:14] lives
[1:13:15] Hallelujah
[1:13:17] there will be a bride
[1:13:20] and she will be found defending the face
[1:13:23] fighting for the faith standing for
[1:13:26] truth
[1:13:28] brother Brandon tells us
[1:13:30] that what the church had at Pentecost
[1:13:32] is her inalienable right
[1:13:36] he says originally she had the pure word
[1:13:38] of God she had the power of the spirit
[1:13:40] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:13:43] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] that is our inalienable right
[1:13:53] you have a right to those things you
[1:13:57] have are we supposed to go seeking after
[1:13:59] nope there to come following after
[1:14:03] signs and wonders shall follow
[1:14:06] those that believe
[1:14:08] so many times
[1:14:12] when they aren't there
[1:14:15] when the gifts are completely absent
[1:14:16] when the moving of the spirit is
[1:14:18] completely absent non-existent I go how
[1:14:22] much do we believe
[1:14:25] because the word of God says they will
[1:14:28] follow the Believers amen do we believe
[1:14:31] that today
[1:14:35] identifying
[1:14:37] and and defending the landmarks
[1:14:40] allows us to contend uh as Jude
[1:14:43] commanded for the faith that was once
[1:14:45] delivered because we can recognize what
[1:14:47] it is we're to continue
[1:14:49] Amen to get our focus in the faith is an
[1:14:52] established Faith listen this isn't our
[1:14:54] faith isn't wishy-washy changing here
[1:14:56] and changing there the way the standards
[1:14:58] of the worlds do but it is an
[1:15:00] established Faith with set boundaries
[1:15:02] and clear definitions and clear
[1:15:04] standards
[1:15:05] well-defined landmarks you know how it
[1:15:08] is when you have property you want your
[1:15:09] landmarks well-defined so there's no
[1:15:11] debate over what's yours and what's the
[1:15:13] neighbors and whether or not this is on
[1:15:15] your land or not your landmarks are
[1:15:17] well-defined that's exactly how this
[1:15:19] gospel is the landmarks are clear it's
[1:15:21] well defined as it's not up for debate
[1:15:24] they're well-defined landmarks and
[1:15:26] landmarks an important part of the land
[1:15:29] that we have been restored to in this
[1:15:31] day because landmarks indicate
[1:15:32] boundaries they indicate ownership come
[1:15:36] on somebody it indicates what belongs to
[1:15:39] you it indicates where you will be
[1:15:42] blessed listen landmarks not only tell
[1:15:44] you what belongs to you and where you'll
[1:15:46] be blessed but it also tells you where
[1:15:48] not to go it tells you where not to
[1:15:50] stray to listen don't go down to Egypt
[1:15:53] looking for your blessings don't go out
[1:15:55] in the world looking for your blessings
[1:15:57] God has given us a land God has returned
[1:15:59] us to the land here's where you'll be
[1:16:01] blessed here's where you'll overcome
[1:16:03] stay in your land stay in your land stay
[1:16:06] within the boundaries but within those
[1:16:09] boundaries possess all everything within
[1:16:13] those boundaries inside those landmarks
[1:16:15] belong to you today amen
[1:16:18] you're not going to be blessed outside
[1:16:20] of the land that God has given you
[1:16:22] you're not going to be blessed pursuing
[1:16:24] things outside of the will of God
[1:16:27] I don't care how good that job looks
[1:16:30] I don't care how pretty you think that
[1:16:33] girl is
[1:16:34] or how handsome that fella is if it's
[1:16:37] not God's will you don't want it you
[1:16:41] will not be blessed outside of God's
[1:16:43] will you take a job that keeps you out
[1:16:45] of the house of God all the time you're
[1:16:47] not gonna find true blessings there you
[1:16:50] marry a girl or marry a boy who ain't
[1:16:51] sold out and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:16:53] you're not gonna find true blessings
[1:16:55] there
[1:16:58] I don't know why we're there but here we
[1:17:01] are you seek God's will you seek the
[1:17:03] kingdom of God's first and then all
[1:17:06] these things will be added under you you
[1:17:08] want a happy home you want a blessed
[1:17:10] life you want children that serve the
[1:17:12] Lord seek the will of God first set your
[1:17:15] boundaries and live inside those
[1:17:17] boundaries amen
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:22] stay where God said stay
[1:17:25] and possess what God Said to possess but
[1:17:28] then once you possess it you better be
[1:17:30] prepared to defend it
[1:17:33] be prepared to defend your possession
[1:17:35] because there's going to be those that
[1:17:37] come and say no that ain't yours not the
[1:17:39] land's right here no no that was for
[1:17:41] another age
[1:17:43] no you can't have that the days of
[1:17:46] Miracles pass that don't belong to you
[1:17:48] no more come on now all the gifts of the
[1:17:52] Spirit they're not needed anymore you
[1:17:53] can't have those things hey somebody to
[1:17:56] go so far as to tell you the days the
[1:17:57] salvation's over
[1:17:59] that there is no more intercession
[1:18:02] and I said there's got to be somebody
[1:18:04] willing to stand up and say no I still
[1:18:06] need it I still need the blood I still
[1:18:08] need Mercy I still need Grace I still
[1:18:10] need healing I know he still healed my
[1:18:13] home still needs Grace my children still
[1:18:15] need the Holy Ghost they have a right to
[1:18:17] the experience the same way you had an
[1:18:20] experience I'm gonna stand up and defend
[1:18:22] the landmarks of the word I'm not giving
[1:18:24] nothing back I'm not backing up off of
[1:18:27] anything he said I could have it he said
[1:18:29] it was mine so your opinion on the
[1:18:32] matter is no it is void it doesn't
[1:18:35] matter I can have the Holy Ghost I can
[1:18:37] have joy I can have peace I can have
[1:18:40] Victory because it's a landmark of the
[1:18:43] word of God
[1:18:45] Hallelujah
[1:18:49] the word says those things are mine
[1:18:53] we might as well come on out of this
[1:19:00] the word says those belong to me
[1:19:03] I don't have to back up if the word says
[1:19:06] this is the final say right here
[1:19:08] there's a lot of people down through the
[1:19:10] years that have a lot of opinions but
[1:19:12] this is the final say this right here is
[1:19:15] what matters I'm not I'm not going to
[1:19:17] give up my worship
[1:19:19] I'm not going to give up my praise I'm
[1:19:21] not going to give up the anointing that
[1:19:23] is coming this day it's the anointing
[1:19:24] that breaks the Yoke that's in the word
[1:19:27] I believe we can still have Services
[1:19:28] where the power of God's poured out I'm
[1:19:31] still gonna lay hands on the sick and
[1:19:33] they shall recover I'm still gonna have
[1:19:35] altar calls and see people come and week
[1:19:37] their way to Calvary because that's the
[1:19:39] way it was at the original
[1:19:42] I'm not afraid of those things because
[1:19:44] they're promised they belong to us
[1:19:46] Hallelujah
[1:19:49] Brother Brad I'm here see I'm saying we
[1:19:52] believe in being converted
[1:19:54] we believe in sin accepting Jesus Christ
[1:19:56] as personal savior we believe him as the
[1:19:59] Son of God
[1:20:00] yes sir that's all right
[1:20:03] all those things you had a form of
[1:20:06] godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:20:10] when I say what do you think about
[1:20:12] Divine Healing
[1:20:14] praising the Lord shouting all the
[1:20:17] Miracles and signs and Gifts back in the
[1:20:19] church oh that was for another age just
[1:20:22] exactly what the Holy Ghost said would
[1:20:24] take place the Holy Ghost said they'll
[1:20:26] have a form of godliness but will deny
[1:20:29] the power thereof he said from such turn
[1:20:33] away for this is just like Janice and
[1:20:37] jambres that withstood Moses and we
[1:20:40] dealt with that last night why did
[1:20:42] Janice and jamborees want them to look
[1:20:43] at that as nothing more than emotion as
[1:20:45] nothing more than a magician's trick
[1:20:47] because if he could get them to doubt in
[1:20:49] that power the power that was going to
[1:20:51] deliver them the power that was going to
[1:20:53] take them homeless we believe for a
[1:20:55] Rapture absolutely and I believe for a
[1:20:56] body change absolutely then I believe
[1:20:58] that the power of God can fall into
[1:21:00] service and cause someone to speak in
[1:21:02] tongues and then cause it to be
[1:21:03] interpreted cause people to be delivered
[1:21:05] from depression delivered from anxiety
[1:21:07] cause people to be healed how are we
[1:21:09] gonna believe that this body can be
[1:21:11] changed how about a deposit on that
[1:21:13] tonight how about a down payment on that
[1:21:15] tonight Lord just once more pour
[1:21:17] yourself out in our lives I need another
[1:21:19] drink from the rock this morning
[1:21:22] he's the same God hallelujah
[1:21:29] landmarks were not to be moved
[1:21:34] if the word established something it is
[1:21:36] always established
[1:21:38] it's not up for debate because of
[1:21:40] certain certain Church don't see it that
[1:21:41] way
[1:21:42] I don't care if it's my church I don't
[1:21:44] care if it's me if I tell you something
[1:21:45] that's contrary to this you tell me to
[1:21:47] shut up it's right here
[1:21:50] it doesn't matter if it hurts somebody's
[1:21:53] feelings if it's in the word it doesn't
[1:21:55] matter it's not up for debate because
[1:21:58] it's no longer acceptable in society
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:02] come on now Proverbs 22 and 28 says
[1:22:06] remove not the ancient Landmark which
[1:22:10] not others have sent
[1:22:12] the Pentecostal father sent some ancient
[1:22:14] landmarks to church it was set up
[1:22:16] exactly the way God wanted he's telling
[1:22:18] you don't move the landmarks
[1:22:20] they've been sent how I want them set
[1:22:23] the landmarks or the boundaries don't
[1:22:25] change from one generation to the next
[1:22:29] the Next Generation didn't get to the
[1:22:31] side you know what I think I would
[1:22:33] rather have that and then go move
[1:22:35] landmarks now they'll try
[1:22:38] they'll try to young people they'll even
[1:22:41] I mean kids are kids
[1:22:43] they'll try to push the boundaries so to
[1:22:45] speak they'll try to find out how sure
[1:22:48] those boundaries are
[1:22:49] come on let's don't have that rebellious
[1:22:51] teenage spirit in our lives as
[1:22:53] Christians today always trying to push
[1:22:54] the boundaries of what God has set for
[1:22:56] us now this don't really matter and that
[1:22:58] don't really matter will I really go to
[1:23:00] hell if I do this listen if we'll quit
[1:23:03] looking at it versus in a way of will it
[1:23:04] send me a hell and start looking at it
[1:23:06] in a way of does displease God we'll get
[1:23:09] a lot further down the road does this
[1:23:11] please my lord does this please my Lord
[1:23:13] not will he send me the hell for it not
[1:23:16] as this bad is this okay but does this
[1:23:18] please God it's what I'm feeding on
[1:23:20] right now pleasing the Lord Jesus start
[1:23:23] looking at it through that filter
[1:23:25] but the Next Generation don't get to
[1:23:27] decide where the boundaries lay and
[1:23:29] neither do we as it relates to the word
[1:23:31] of God they were established in the
[1:23:35] unchanging infallible word of the Lord
[1:23:37] his boundaries do not drift or change
[1:23:40] from one generation to the next if it
[1:23:42] was wrong in 1700 it's wrong to death if
[1:23:46] it was wrong in 1963 or 1965 it's still
[1:23:49] wrong today if the Bible says You must
[1:23:52] be born again you must be born again
[1:23:56] there's no other way around it and he
[1:23:58] laid a pattern out for how
[1:24:01] you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:02] and if being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] in the book of Acts calls signs and
[1:24:06] wonders and tongues and all other kinds
[1:24:08] of manifestations of the spirit it's
[1:24:10] gonna do the same thing today
[1:24:13] absolutely it's always going to be that
[1:24:15] way
[1:24:16] and he says curse it be the man
[1:24:18] who would move the landmark
[1:24:21] curse it be the man who moves The
[1:24:23] Landmark because heavens and earth will
[1:24:25] pass away but my word shall never
[1:24:29] pass away
[1:24:31] what are we talking about defending the
[1:24:33] landmarks
[1:24:34] people that are willing to stand there
[1:24:36] no matter what happens is that won't
[1:24:38] back off this because the landmarks we
[1:24:40] know this in society are Ever Changing
[1:24:43] the boundaries in society are Ever
[1:24:45] Changing we can't allow ourselves to get
[1:24:47] in that frame of mind to where
[1:24:49] principles and standards become fluid
[1:24:53] sure they change depending on the day or
[1:24:55] the change according listen we can't
[1:24:57] ever get comfortable here
[1:24:59] you should never be comfortable with a
[1:25:01] Christian's life go so against the flow
[1:25:04] of the world it's flowing that way and
[1:25:05] if you relax even for a minute what
[1:25:07] happens when you throw something in a
[1:25:09] flowing stream
[1:25:12] it goes with the current
[1:25:13] as Christians we can't relax today there
[1:25:16] has to be a constant struggle a constant
[1:25:18] battle against the current against the
[1:25:20] evil against lukewarmness against the
[1:25:22] gods of this evening it's a constant
[1:25:24] fight but we're constantly gaining
[1:25:26] ground we ain't backing up we're not
[1:25:28] going with the current we're not getting
[1:25:30] comfortable we say no these standards
[1:25:32] are Eternal standards these left and
[1:25:36] marks are Eternal landmarks and I will
[1:25:38] stand for them today
[1:25:40] your life should go completely contrary
[1:25:43] to the flow of the world
[1:25:45] if you listen if you look around today
[1:25:47] and you're going the same way as your
[1:25:48] friends at school or you're joking and
[1:25:50] talking the same way as your friends at
[1:25:52] work you might want to check up this
[1:25:53] morning you might want to say Lord is
[1:25:55] there so I ain't saying you're some kind
[1:25:57] of right sinner but if it's just easy
[1:25:58] for you to blend right in if it's just
[1:26:01] easy for you to go with the flow as it
[1:26:03] were
[1:26:05] something's not right
[1:26:07] because your life should always be going
[1:26:09] contrary to the flow of this world Amen
[1:26:12] you should be having to swim hard
[1:26:14] against the current to get anywhere
[1:26:19] constantly fighting for ground
[1:26:21] constantly gaining ground but finding no
[1:26:23] bite the dove that Noah let out finding
[1:26:25] no place for you to rest
[1:26:27] finding no place for your feet to rest
[1:26:30] the only place you should have rest
[1:26:32] while you're here is on the word of God
[1:26:33] the only place we find rest is that rock
[1:26:36] and when we get that rock all of a
[1:26:38] sudden that anchor digs in deep to that
[1:26:40] rock and then let the winds blow let the
[1:26:42] waters come let the floods come I'll
[1:26:44] make her to the solid rock it doesn't
[1:26:46] move it doesn't change it'll hold when
[1:26:49] the storms blow it'll hold when others
[1:26:51] walk away it'll hold when sickness
[1:26:53] strikes it'll hold when everybody else
[1:26:55] turns negative it'll hold it's
[1:26:57] unchanging it's the rock of Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] get anchored in that today you'll quit
[1:27:02] blowing back and forth anchor in a solid
[1:27:04] rock this morning
[1:27:06] Hallelujah this rock isn't influenced by
[1:27:09] The Winds of the world
[1:27:14] you know for many years the landmarks of
[1:27:16] society stayed mostly unmoved
[1:27:19] they stayed mostly stable
[1:27:22] and because of that it created a
[1:27:24] relatively stable world for people to
[1:27:27] live in
[1:27:28] for hundreds of years
[1:27:30] if if not thousands and even our country
[1:27:32] that that we live in there was a time it
[1:27:35] looked to God
[1:27:37] we can't say that anymore
[1:27:38] but there was a time it looked to God
[1:27:40] and because of that it reaped the
[1:27:42] benefits of that it was a blessed
[1:27:44] country and God's word was a basis for
[1:27:48] the landmarks of our society
[1:27:50] listen marriage was a landmark of
[1:27:53] society
[1:27:55] and marriage was glorified and it was
[1:27:57] lifted up instead of just living
[1:27:58] together and having children out of
[1:28:00] wedlock
[1:28:01] but when you move a landmark of God it
[1:28:04] comes with consequences
[1:28:07] you can't move a landmark without the
[1:28:10] consequences that follow
[1:28:14] 75 percent of long-term Correctional
[1:28:18] Facility inmates are from father absent
[1:28:21] households
[1:28:25] 85 percent of kids who exhibit
[1:28:28] behavioral disorders are from fatherless
[1:28:30] homes
[1:28:31] 85 percent of kids in state institutions
[1:28:36] are from fatherless homes
[1:28:38] what brother Brown tell us tell us he
[1:28:40] said it's not it's not teenage
[1:28:42] delinquency it's parental delinquency
[1:28:48] listen and you see that a lot of times
[1:28:50] even in message homes listen
[1:28:52] I I I understand we're called to be
[1:28:54] providers daddies we're called to work
[1:28:56] but when you put yourself so much in
[1:28:58] your work and so much time in your work
[1:29:00] and so much time in this and so much
[1:29:02] time in this project so much time in
[1:29:04] that project to the point that you're
[1:29:05] neglecting your children listen they
[1:29:07] don't need a new pair of Nikes they
[1:29:09] don't need new airpods they don't need a
[1:29:11] new PlayStation whatever it is you're
[1:29:13] trying to get them they need you they
[1:29:15] need a leader they need a daddy they
[1:29:17] need somebody present that's there to
[1:29:19] love them and guide them and keep them
[1:29:20] from The Wiles of the devil amen I like
[1:29:23] I said I believe in providing but what
[1:29:25] they need is you in their life
[1:29:28] that's what they need
[1:29:30] Parenthood used to be a landmark of
[1:29:32] society
[1:29:34] but now we March in the streets to Kill
[1:29:35] The Unborn
[1:29:40] I say that the boundary stones have been
[1:29:42] moved a little bit
[1:29:46] truth used to be valued
[1:29:48] and now there's no truth hardly to be
[1:29:50] found in the world
[1:29:52] or poison with constant political
[1:29:54] propaganda
[1:29:55] as I've heard it said before if you if
[1:29:57] you don't read the news you're
[1:29:59] uninformed if you do read the news
[1:30:01] you're misinformed
[1:30:05] there's no truth to be had out there
[1:30:07] then why are we looking for truth out
[1:30:09] there there's no truth in schools
[1:30:10] there's no truth in government there's
[1:30:11] no truth in politics well I don't know
[1:30:13] what to believe yes you do know what to
[1:30:15] believe it makes it easier to know what
[1:30:17] to believe here's the truth you're
[1:30:19] looking for here's the life you're
[1:30:20] looking for it's easier now to know what
[1:30:23] to believe than ever before because it's
[1:30:25] got so wicked so off base that it makes
[1:30:28] this shine brighter than it's ever shown
[1:30:30] before oh it's getting darker brother
[1:30:33] Aaron yep and the light is shining
[1:30:35] brighter than it's ever shine in this
[1:30:37] day
[1:30:39] we know what to believe
[1:30:43] the landmark of morality has been torn
[1:30:45] down
[1:30:46] replaced with the pursuit of lust
[1:30:48] replaced with the pursuit of personal
[1:30:50] satisfaction
[1:30:52] American universities were once actually
[1:30:55] founded on Christian ideas
[1:30:58] think of that
[1:31:01] they've completely moved their landmarks
[1:31:03] it used to be the place of Christian
[1:31:05] morals at one time they were literally
[1:31:07] considered the center of Christian
[1:31:10] thought in our country
[1:31:12] but now the boundary stones of the
[1:31:14] university has been moved so far off
[1:31:15] towards just in a pit of atheism
[1:31:18] tourists is nothing but an
[1:31:19] indoctrination Center for our youth
[1:31:22] listen
[1:31:23] I'm not I'm not telling you that I'm
[1:31:24] against you going to college but you
[1:31:26] better know where you stand before you
[1:31:28] get in that Cesspool you better know
[1:31:30] where you stand before you get there and
[1:31:32] get surrounded by all those ideas and
[1:31:34] all that intellectualism you better get
[1:31:36] there because I'm telling you like a
[1:31:38] professor told me one time in class what
[1:31:40] we have learned is that the more
[1:31:42] educated we get people the more liberal
[1:31:45] they become
[1:31:50] know where you stand
[1:31:52] allowing the boundary stones to be moved
[1:31:55] has allowed the whole world to go
[1:31:56] completely insane
[1:31:59] like we said no truth in government no
[1:32:01] truth is gonna listen they pulled up the
[1:32:02] anchor
[1:32:03] they pulled out the anchor they got away
[1:32:05] from the absolute and in so doing the
[1:32:07] Winds of Change has taken them so far
[1:32:09] out of the picture that the world has
[1:32:11] gone completely insane a hundred years
[1:32:13] ago you could have never convinced
[1:32:16] people of where we'd be at today
[1:32:18] 50 years ago you could have never
[1:32:20] convinced the world where we be at today
[1:32:22] but God knew and a prophet knew a puff
[1:32:26] into the property God said let me
[1:32:28] prophesy something to you just before it
[1:32:31] comes to pass the whole world is groping
[1:32:34] in insanity and it will get worse and
[1:32:37] worse and worse until there'll be a
[1:32:39] bunch of maniacs and it's almost that
[1:32:43] way now I said it last night fulfilled I
[1:32:47] know
[1:32:48] that's why we can't give even an inch
[1:32:51] that's why we can't give even a foothold
[1:32:53] sometimes like well why does this matter
[1:32:55] why does that matter we can't move the
[1:32:58] boundaries don't because listen he's not
[1:32:59] just after your joy he's not just after
[1:33:01] your peace that's not what he's after
[1:33:03] he's after your soul he's after your
[1:33:06] life he's after your eternity and he
[1:33:08] wants to take it all and it starts by
[1:33:10] giving up just a little moving the the
[1:33:12] the the landmark just a little we can't
[1:33:15] give in we can't back up we can't give
[1:33:18] an inch this morning
[1:33:22] the devil says oh but this is so small
[1:33:26] how many times I know as a kid
[1:33:28] especially I've said things like why
[1:33:30] does that matter
[1:33:32] why is that such a big deal why is that
[1:33:35] so important that seems so old-fashioned
[1:33:37] listen I didn't put the landmark there
[1:33:42] I didn't put the boundaries down there
[1:33:43] God put it there and I believe that if
[1:33:47] he put it there he knew why he put it
[1:33:49] there he had a reason for putting it
[1:33:51] there
[1:33:53] why were the laws of Israel so strict
[1:33:57] why were they so strict go back and look
[1:33:59] and study a little bit of the histories
[1:34:01] of the other Pagan cultures to where so
[1:34:04] much of their religion and their entire
[1:34:06] life revolved around sexual things
[1:34:10] even with children so God understanding
[1:34:13] there would have never been a virgin for
[1:34:15] him to be born through
[1:34:17] right had he not come down and said
[1:34:20] landmarks
[1:34:21] boundary stones and make it so wrong
[1:34:25] that if you commit adultery do these
[1:34:27] things you will be killed why he knew
[1:34:30] what he was doing he knows how to work
[1:34:33] things out
[1:34:34] one word is a big deal ask Eve
[1:34:40] listen if you think little things don't
[1:34:41] matter get a kidney stone one time
[1:34:46] that put me straight to hospital
[1:34:49] little things matter
[1:34:51] little things can hurt
[1:34:53] little things matter one word stepping
[1:34:55] out from behind that one word cause the
[1:34:58] entire trouble that we're in today I say
[1:35:01] we gotta defend every word of God we got
[1:35:03] to stand for every word of God we gotta
[1:35:06] Square our shoulders back put on the
[1:35:07] whole armor and say here I stand today I
[1:35:10] woke back up this word is truth this
[1:35:12] message is truth this message is
[1:35:14] indicated it's the only Vindicated voice
[1:35:17] in this day
[1:35:19] it's worth standing for it's worth
[1:35:21] fighting for and if need be it is worth
[1:35:24] dying for because it's the only place
[1:35:26] where true life is in this day
[1:35:29] Hallelujah
[1:35:34] we have to contend
[1:35:36] Satan never relaxes he never stops
[1:35:39] attacking he wants to destroy this bride
[1:35:41] he wants to see you so bad lukewarm he
[1:35:44] wants to see you so bad lifeless and
[1:35:46] Powerless
[1:35:48] he wants to come in and in subtle ways
[1:35:50] and Rob us of our freedom lot robots of
[1:35:53] the life that we've been restored to I
[1:35:55] say no not today
[1:35:56] not today Satan that's become a slogan
[1:36:00] out there I see it on shirts and cups
[1:36:01] today not today listen I'll say it again
[1:36:04] not today Satan I'll Stand and Fight For
[1:36:06] Joy I'll Stand For Peace I'll fight for
[1:36:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll fight
[1:36:11] for everything now every Redemptive
[1:36:13] promise that was restored to us that day
[1:36:15] on Calvary I will stand as long as
[1:36:18] there's breath in my body I'll Stand and
[1:36:20] fight boy
[1:36:21] he died for it how dare I say it don't
[1:36:24] matter he died for it how dare say I
[1:36:27] don't need that he died for it so that
[1:36:30] you would be equipped just stand in this
[1:36:32] evil day if he died for it I say I want
[1:36:35] it I'll take it I'll fight for it I'll
[1:36:37] draw my sword this morning and say back
[1:36:40] off just be long
[1:36:43] to me hallelujah it's mine the Holy
[1:36:48] Ghost is mine my children are mine
[1:36:50] victory is mine Hallelujah I'm not
[1:36:54] backing up today forward all my
[1:36:57] Christian Soldier take more ground take
[1:37:00] more ground
[1:37:01] you're called to take more ground today
[1:37:07] Hallelujah
[1:37:11] he said there'd be gifts in the church
[1:37:13] I'll fight for it
[1:37:16] if he said be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:17] I'll fight for it
[1:37:21] John 14 12 he said the works that I do
[1:37:23] shall you do also I'll fight for it
[1:37:27] you know
[1:37:29] if you'll study the message
[1:37:31] when brother Branham goes and sometimes
[1:37:33] he'll he'll list or quote end time
[1:37:35] scriptures
[1:37:36] he'll say Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7
[1:37:40] Malachi 4
[1:37:42] almost all the time
[1:37:45] he'll also say John 14 12.
[1:37:48] he makes that
[1:37:49] an end time scripture
[1:37:52] he puts it there all the time The Works
[1:37:54] that I do shall you do also and greater
[1:37:57] and greater the greater portion of John
[1:38:00] 14 12 was found in the third poor how
[1:38:03] could we do greater without the fullness
[1:38:06] how could you do greater without it
[1:38:08] being restored in this day you're a
[1:38:10] third pool people quit being afraid to
[1:38:12] operate in it
[1:38:13] you're being afraid to take the word
[1:38:14] upon your mouth and put on your lips he
[1:38:16] said that's the same as deity speaking
[1:38:19] well I don't know about that I do the
[1:38:22] prophet said it y'all how we gonna
[1:38:23] believe everything else and go I don't
[1:38:25] know about that
[1:38:26] it's time we step into our position step
[1:38:28] into our Authority step into the place
[1:38:31] God called us to step into he didn't
[1:38:33] call us to be church members he didn't
[1:38:35] send a message to produce a new religion
[1:38:37] he sent a new message to produce Jesus
[1:38:40] Christ on earth once again in a broad
[1:38:43] body manifesting The Works of Jesus he's
[1:38:47] coming back who's he coming back for
[1:38:49] Miss Jesus Christ bone in this bone
[1:38:52] flesh of his flesh power is power she is
[1:38:56] him
[1:38:57] [Applause]
[1:38:58] manifesting Jesus on the Earth again
[1:39:01] that's why the message was sent not so
[1:39:04] you could win an argument have a better
[1:39:05] Doctrine than somebody
[1:39:07] he's not coming back to Rapture
[1:39:10] doctrines he's coming back to Rapture
[1:39:12] men and women who has flesh around those
[1:39:16] quotes flash around those scriptures
[1:39:18] flesh a flesh body that's what he's
[1:39:22] coming back for
[1:39:23] but that flesh is indwelt by his spirit
[1:39:27] amen
[1:39:29] Jude says contend
[1:39:33] Hosea 5 and 10 says
[1:39:37] the princes of Judah were like them that
[1:39:41] removed the bound
[1:39:43] therefore I will pour out my wrath upon
[1:39:46] them like water
[1:39:48] the bound here is the boundary
[1:39:51] and it says they are like those that
[1:39:53] remove the bound or the ancient
[1:39:55] landmarks
[1:39:56] God gave them his law to be offense
[1:40:00] about his own property
[1:40:01] but they have sacritiously broken
[1:40:04] through it and set it aside
[1:40:08] so there are those
[1:40:10] who will move the landmarks
[1:40:12] which means there have to be those
[1:40:14] willing to defend the landmarks
[1:40:17] there's got to be somebody willing
[1:40:19] that'll stand and say as long as I'm
[1:40:20] here this belongs to the bride
[1:40:23] as long as I'm here and this is in the
[1:40:25] word listen
[1:40:27] we look back to where Jude was writing
[1:40:29] in 66 A.D
[1:40:31] so we know that it was written during
[1:40:32] the first church age because it extended
[1:40:34] from 53 A.D to about 178 days while
[1:40:37] brother Brown tells us in the church
[1:40:38] ages
[1:40:40] it would behoove us as a people
[1:40:42] to look back at that first church age
[1:40:44] and find out where the enemy came in
[1:40:47] where was his attack
[1:40:51] what caused that age to fall
[1:40:55] to find out what it was that took them
[1:40:57] from the church on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:01] that fell so hard that we find them over
[1:41:02] in the Book of Revelation as the cage of
[1:41:05] every unclean and hateful bird
[1:41:07] how did that go from that
[1:41:10] to that
[1:41:12] where did the devil come in because
[1:41:15] that's the desire of the devil he would
[1:41:16] have this church to be unrecognizable
[1:41:20] this church and the church worldwide he
[1:41:23] would have it to where it was so
[1:41:24] unrecognizable that it became nothing
[1:41:26] more than stories
[1:41:29] nothing more than doctrines he would
[1:41:31] have you to be powerless he would have
[1:41:33] you to be cold lukewarm informal oh that
[1:41:36] would never happen in this message
[1:41:39] you better get your head out of the sand
[1:41:42] you better wake up
[1:41:44] wake up come in and squeeze the life I
[1:41:48] like life because it's here
[1:41:50] you say oh it never happened in this
[1:41:52] message listen it happened in the age of
[1:41:54] Paul
[1:41:55] it happened in the age of Peter it
[1:41:58] happened in the age of Stephen the
[1:42:00] church that started in the upper room
[1:42:03] it happened there
[1:42:05] the church what's the big deal that
[1:42:07] church is the pattern
[1:42:10] that church is the pattern brother
[1:42:13] Branham says that's what the church was
[1:42:16] at Pentecost is the standard
[1:42:21] the standard
[1:42:24] went into the ground
[1:42:26] now I understand that was a
[1:42:28] predestinated thing and they had to go
[1:42:29] in the ground so that we could be here I
[1:42:31] understand that but what was it that
[1:42:33] caused them to fall
[1:42:36] he says that is the pattern there is no
[1:42:41] other pattern
[1:42:43] and Jude is writing just 33 years after
[1:42:46] Pentecost and he has to tell the people
[1:42:47] we got to get back to the pattern
[1:42:49] somewhere we've got off
[1:42:51] somewhere the pattern isn't lining up to
[1:42:53] what we're trying to do we got to fight
[1:42:55] for what we used to have and here we are
[1:42:57] in 2023 some 58 years since the
[1:43:00] prophet's gone off the scene and I'm
[1:43:02] telling you we got to get back to the
[1:43:03] landmarks we got to get back to what the
[1:43:05] message is and not what we think the
[1:43:07] message is
[1:43:08] I tell you what when I started studying
[1:43:10] the message for myself you wouldn't
[1:43:11] believe how many
[1:43:15] be nice
[1:43:16] um how many things I've come across that
[1:43:18] I've been told my whole life brother
[1:43:19] Branham said brother Brown said brother
[1:43:22] random said but when you start looking
[1:43:23] for yourself brother Branham didn't say
[1:43:25] it you can't find it anywhere and what
[1:43:27] it is because somebody heard something
[1:43:29] and they interpreted it like this and
[1:43:31] they said well brother Branham said this
[1:43:32] brother Brown said listen it's time that
[1:43:35] we as Believers not just the ministers
[1:43:37] get back into the word of God it's time
[1:43:39] you read your Bible it's time you listen
[1:43:42] to the messages for yourself and
[1:43:44] understand that this message wasn't
[1:43:45] about preachers this message was about
[1:43:47] you it's about saving you it's about
[1:43:50] rapturing you I think it's important
[1:43:52] that you know
[1:43:55] I can prove it to you
[1:43:59] I will send unto you Elijah
[1:44:06] it's for you
[1:44:09] it's right there in the word we got to
[1:44:11] get back in it so we can defend the
[1:44:13] landmarks you don't know what to defend
[1:44:15] you don't even know what's being
[1:44:17] attacked if you don't know what the
[1:44:18] landmarks are
[1:44:20] get back into the word you can't just
[1:44:21] sit back and allow the same spirit that
[1:44:23] came in the first stage
[1:44:26] that began to cause them to cool off and
[1:44:28] it came in so subtle
[1:44:30] listen just go back and read the first
[1:44:31] church age
[1:44:32] the spirit of the Nicolaitans came in
[1:44:34] and began to Rob spiritual worship from
[1:44:36] the people
[1:44:37] and they made it to where only only the
[1:44:40] ministry was gifted or the priesthood
[1:44:41] was gifted and nobody else had a gift
[1:44:43] well of course they did you know how
[1:44:45] powerful that would make me if y'all
[1:44:46] were a bunch of nobodies and I was the
[1:44:48] only one gifted you had to come to me
[1:44:50] with every question and everything
[1:44:53] what a Doctrine
[1:44:55] laughs
[1:44:57] no but all are to participate in
[1:44:59] spiritual worship
[1:45:01] all can go before the throne of grace
[1:45:02] all can call on the name of the Lord
[1:45:04] when they have a need you can lay your
[1:45:06] hand on your sick child's forehead and
[1:45:08] say in the name of Jesus by his stripes
[1:45:11] he's healed Satan get away with my
[1:45:12] family you can go to prayer you can call
[1:45:15] out for a loved one you can call out for
[1:45:17] the ministry you can pray for your wife
[1:45:18] you can pray for your husband and God
[1:45:20] hears you just as much as he hears
[1:45:22] anybody else he hears you your faith has
[1:45:25] saved you who was it what was it that
[1:45:28] turned Hattie Wright's children he
[1:45:30] wasn't the prophet of God it was perfect
[1:45:32] thank you
[1:45:34] it was her response to the word it was
[1:45:37] her saying that's truth that's truth and
[1:45:39] it turned and it would save their
[1:45:41] children oh what was it when the soldier
[1:45:44] came to Jesus and he said thy faith has
[1:45:47] saved your servant
[1:45:49] your faith
[1:45:51] don't be afraid to operate your face
[1:45:53] that's a landmark of the scripture you
[1:45:56] can operate the power of God he's
[1:45:58] wanting people to operate it he's
[1:46:00] looking for people to operate him he's
[1:46:02] looking for people that don't say maybe
[1:46:04] it's for them maybe it's for them but no
[1:46:06] the angel of the Lord comes in this
[1:46:08] building and speaks to your heart and
[1:46:10] somebody says be it unto me Lord
[1:46:12] according to Thy word yes that's for me
[1:46:15] yes that's mine yes I'll take it yes
[1:46:18] I'll fight for it be it unto me

[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:15] let's rain this back in a minute we
[1:54:18] might get excited
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:24] first age
[1:54:26] the Zeal they had
[1:54:28] the signs and wonders that's how it
[1:54:30] started
[1:54:31] power of God was undeniable
[1:54:34] but slowly they became relaxed
[1:54:37] and we know we already said it and then
[1:54:38] the name means aim that and relax
[1:54:41] look at Paul still been there he'd have
[1:54:43] cried out
[1:54:44] if Peter had still been there he'd have
[1:54:46] cried out
[1:54:47] Stephen had still been there
[1:54:50] I'll say it
[1:54:51] if brother Brown was still here I'm
[1:54:53] afraid there's a lot of us wouldn't like
[1:54:55] his preaching
[1:54:56] [Applause]
[1:54:57] because he would have cried out
[1:54:59] against this cold formal lodges
[1:55:02] where there's no light there's no birth
[1:55:05] there's nothing happening there's no
[1:55:06] moving of the spirit people sit there
[1:55:09] like a bump on a pickle and say bless me
[1:55:10] if you can
[1:55:14] Peter cried out against it but Paul saw
[1:55:17] it coming he wrote about in the
[1:55:19] scriptures just like our prophets are
[1:55:20] coming and warned about it Paul's art
[1:55:23] coming he tried to warn them of the
[1:55:24] subtle priesthood that would come in and
[1:55:27] try to take over and would strip the
[1:55:28] Holy Spirit Worship from the laity
[1:55:32] what happened is a generation rose up
[1:55:34] that wasn't in the upper room
[1:55:37] [Applause]
[1:55:38] how many generations are we removed from
[1:55:40] the prophet
[1:55:44] generation rose up that it was all just
[1:55:46] stories well my grandpa said that
[1:55:49] they're in the upper room
[1:55:51] well my mama's aunt's first cousin
[1:55:53] had told her
[1:55:56] and they didn't know nothing about it
[1:55:57] for themselves
[1:55:59] to a stories
[1:56:03] and when it's just stories about how God
[1:56:05] moved through a prophet versus
[1:56:07] experiencing the same God that moved in
[1:56:10] the prophet moving in you
[1:56:12] the same miraculous the same Authority
[1:56:17] listen
[1:56:19] I hold bro Brown in the highest of
[1:56:21] regards as we should
[1:56:22] but the pillar of fire didn't leave when
[1:56:24] he left
[1:56:26] the pillar of fire still here and if you
[1:56:28] thought for a moment it was brother
[1:56:29] Branham doing those works and not the
[1:56:31] pillar of fire you got a little bit off
[1:56:33] the pattern a little bit and so the same
[1:56:35] Pillar of Fire that operated through
[1:56:37] brother Branham why was he doing that
[1:56:39] why I understand or to draw our
[1:56:42] attention to the word absolutely but it
[1:56:45] was to show you the power that laid in
[1:56:47] the word listen testimonies are not to
[1:56:50] tell us what God used to do testimonies
[1:56:52] are to give us faith for what God's
[1:56:54] gonna do that's what testimonies well
[1:56:56] God did this God did that Hallelujah
[1:56:59] that means today God will do the same
[1:57:01] thing he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:57:03] if you let him he'll pour His Spirit out
[1:57:05] in you today if you land he's the same
[1:57:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:57:11] oh thank you
[1:57:13] man began to control the way the
[1:57:15] services went instead of the spirit
[1:57:17] well we've seen this many songs then we
[1:57:19] called the preacher out on this exact
[1:57:21] song and don't you dare Miss I hate
[1:57:22] won't even come out what if we don't
[1:57:23] sing The Rise huh and then we'll be
[1:57:25] allowed to sing two songs at the end of
[1:57:26] service
[1:57:28] Hey listen
[1:57:29] every church has things they do
[1:57:31] regularly I'm not knocking that
[1:57:33] but when we get to the place to we're
[1:57:35] afraid to let the spirit move hey I so
[1:57:38] appreciate it this morning we didn't
[1:57:40] care if song service was an hour
[1:57:42] is here to worship I I sat right back
[1:57:45] there I said Thank You Lord that there
[1:57:46] ain't a people so boxed in that's like
[1:57:48] well we're not gonna let you and you
[1:57:49] sing because that'll make the song
[1:57:50] service go too long I say let's worship
[1:57:52] God we give so much time to so many
[1:57:55] other things we do so many other things
[1:57:57] we don't care listen we don't care how
[1:58:00] long that movie is
[1:58:03] we don't care how long that ball game is
[1:58:05] what about when the King of Kings and
[1:58:07] the Lord of lords wants a fresh drink of
[1:58:09] water I said give him some water I say
[1:58:12] pour it out I say worship pour it out
[1:58:15] hey I'll give you another drink and
[1:58:17] another drink and another drink we
[1:58:19] didn't hear two and a half hours are you
[1:58:21] still thirsty Lord have another drink
[1:58:23] this morning don't be afraid to worship
[1:58:27] you have a right to worship today
[1:58:30] Hallelujah
[1:58:39] Brown says oh it started so small
[1:58:42] so quietly so inoffensively
[1:58:48] it looked so good
[1:58:50] it seems so sound
[1:58:52] then it caught a hold and like a python
[1:58:55] it squeezed out the very breath and
[1:58:57] killed all the spirituality there was in
[1:59:00] the church
[1:59:04] that's why we cried against formalism in
[1:59:06] a church let me make something real
[1:59:07] clear
[1:59:09] everybody Ain't Gonna Worship like me
[1:59:12] everybody ain't gonna jump around and
[1:59:15] I'll use the way brother Brown said it
[1:59:16] and act idiotic like I do
[1:59:19] I don't expect you to
[1:59:23] some people just raised their hands and
[1:59:25] worship and tears streamed down their
[1:59:26] face
[1:59:28] my point is just worship him with all
[1:59:32] you have in the way that you're called
[1:59:34] to when he comes in the building that's
[1:59:36] what freedom of worship is I've said it
[1:59:38] before what they ended up with in Azusa
[1:59:41] Street was not freedom of worship
[1:59:42] because they had to speak in tongues
[1:59:45] they had to run the owls they had to
[1:59:48] jump it so it was no longer a freedom it
[1:59:49] was actually a bondage freedom is that
[1:59:52] when he comes in this building I'm free
[1:59:54] to worship him how I am called to
[1:59:58] worship him if that means run jump shout
[2:00:00] dance I say you better do it if that's
[2:00:02] what you're called to do but let me tell
[2:00:04] you what I told Brother about her last
[2:00:05] night I don't know I don't care how you
[2:00:07] worship but in no religion anywhere is
[2:00:10] this a form of worship
[2:00:12] all right
[2:00:13] [Applause]
[2:00:19] that ain't worship anywhere he's in the
[2:00:22] building how do I know he said he'd be
[2:00:23] here and he's calling for somebody who's
[2:00:26] not afraid to say that's my king that's
[2:00:28] my Lord that's my savior that's my
[2:00:31] deliverer I'm not afraid to worship Him
[2:00:34] and some of you were called to go
[2:00:39] if you don't be ahead and order be of
[2:00:40] emphatic head nodder
[2:00:44] I'll tell you what
[2:00:47] I'ma still alive from Brother Baker he
[2:00:50] said if you're going to be a tear at
[2:00:52] least be a Biblical tear because they
[2:00:54] shouted when the rain fell
[2:00:55] [Applause]
[2:00:58] if even the weeds and the tariffs can
[2:01:00] worship and they recognize what he's
[2:01:02] done and they recognize who he is and
[2:01:04] they're going to be gathered and burned
[2:01:06] what about the world going to be
[2:01:07] gathered in the Harvest taken into the
[2:01:09] Garner take it into a Rapture I say we
[2:01:12] ought to be free to worship the King of
[2:01:14] Kings he's taken us out of the Cesspool
[2:01:17] out of this chicken pen
[2:01:20] and the least we can do
[2:01:22] is give him a little worship
[2:01:24] [Applause]
[2:01:30] I'm gonna try to move on a little bit
[2:01:33] [Music]
[2:01:36] why do you cry out against it because
[2:01:38] it's a python that'll squeeze the life
[2:01:40] out of the church
[2:01:41] to where there's no atmosphere for birth
[2:01:43] I'll tell you something this atmosphere
[2:01:45] this morning all things are possible
[2:01:48] all things are popped that's why he
[2:01:49] hates this atmosphere that's why he puts
[2:01:51] up scarecrows because right behind the
[2:01:53] Scarecrow is the fruit
[2:01:55] he puts up that scarecrow so don't get
[2:01:57] too fanatical don't get too emotional
[2:01:59] most of us ain't gotta worry about that
[2:02:01] I promise
[2:02:04] I'm saying
[2:02:07] he said some of you need to get out of
[2:02:09] order long enough to get saved
[2:02:12] now let me throw a little something at
[2:02:14] you hey if you don't like this one you
[2:02:16] can spit it out
[2:02:17] that's okay I give you permission
[2:02:19] but think about who he mostly was
[2:02:21] preaching to he was mostly an Assembly
[2:02:23] of God churches mostly in Pentecostal
[2:02:25] churches people that we call sometimes
[2:02:27] God bless them but sometimes people
[2:02:29] Point them like oh they're fanatical and
[2:02:30] they're this and they're that brother
[2:02:32] Brown's talking to those people saying
[2:02:34] they had too much order
[2:02:39] said you need to get out of order long
[2:02:41] enough to get saved what would he say to
[2:02:44] some of us
[2:02:47] now I ain't saying that to y'all this
[2:02:49] morning because y'all are awesome y'all
[2:02:51] are pulling that incredible and I want
[2:02:52] you to think I'm beating you over the
[2:02:53] head I'm just telling you to guard
[2:02:54] against that Spirit watch that Spirit
[2:02:57] that'll try to come in and try to Rob
[2:02:59] this joy that you're experiencing today
[2:03:01] from your life try to take it from you
[2:03:03] we don't want that because when there's
[2:03:04] no atmosphere there's no birth
[2:03:06] there's no atmosphere there's no
[2:03:08] Deliverance there's no healing
[2:03:10] there's no opportunity for our children
[2:03:12] to have their own experience
[2:03:16] I believe sometimes that we've Church
[2:03:17] ordered the Holy Spirit right out of our
[2:03:19] services
[2:03:22] and that python Spirit comes
[2:03:25] and some of us are wrapped up in it we
[2:03:27] don't even know
[2:03:32] we try we want to raise our hands
[2:03:35] we want to worship
[2:03:42] what's restraining you
[2:03:44] that spirit
[2:03:46] got you bound
[2:03:49] go on you you want to say hallelujah but
[2:03:53] you get out of
[2:03:56] it's wrapped around your vocal cords
[2:03:59] it's on the list I'll tell you what
[2:04:01] one of my favorite people in the Bible
[2:04:02] this might not be normal to say but one
[2:04:04] of my favorite people in the Bible is a
[2:04:05] legion
[2:04:06] because you know what brother Brown says
[2:04:08] in one place he says those demons that
[2:04:10] had Legion bound would have never come
[2:04:13] to the feet of Jesus
[2:04:15] he said Legion drug them there you got
[2:04:19] something bothering you this morning you
[2:04:20] got depression you got anxiety you got
[2:04:22] no freedom I say okay you want to turn
[2:04:24] yourself to me I'm gonna drag you to the
[2:04:27] feet of Jesus this morning I'm gonna
[2:04:29] bring you into the presence of the King
[2:04:31] on freedom get loose from that thing get
[2:04:34] your hands up shout Praises To the King
[2:04:36] of Kings Hallelujah
[2:04:38] that spirit's off my life I'm free to
[2:04:41] worship I'm free to praise
[2:04:44] a pardon is not a pardon if it's not
[2:04:48] accepted as a pardon it's being waved in
[2:04:51] front of you and some people are going
[2:04:52] now I'm good sitting here dead
[2:04:57] you don't have to be
[2:05:00] there's life here offer for you today
[2:05:02] there's freedom and no I'm not talking
[2:05:04] about the jump in the shop I'm talking
[2:05:06] about the thing that'll put a jump and a
[2:05:08] shout in you
[2:05:10] that's what I'm talking about this
[2:05:11] morning
[2:05:14] problem is a lot of people don't think
[2:05:16] it's for them
[2:05:19] that's a lie the devil
[2:05:21] it's all for you that's what we're
[2:05:22] talking about everything is for you
[2:05:26] it's for you to take today
[2:05:28] and of course Satan comes and he wants
[2:05:30] to convince people that it's all just an
[2:05:32] emotional workup
[2:05:33] I told the brother the other day I said
[2:05:35] listen
[2:05:36] if I knew how to work people up
[2:05:39] I might would sometimes
[2:05:41] because that's sometimes it's dead
[2:05:42] you're like man if I knew the switch
[2:05:45] if I knew what to say if I knew I could
[2:05:48] do this and that and it'd wake some
[2:05:49] people up I might would do it but I
[2:05:51] ain't found it yet
[2:05:52] all I know to do is preach the word and
[2:05:54] when that spirit moves over that sea
[2:05:56] something on the inside of that seed
[2:05:58] gets a little bit excited
[2:06:00] but the devil wants to convince you it's
[2:06:01] hard worker why
[2:06:03] of course he wants dead Services because
[2:06:06] in dead Services he's never cast out
[2:06:10] in dead surfaces there's no freedom and
[2:06:12] dead Services people don't draw closer
[2:06:14] to the Lord
[2:06:15] in dead Services there's no births
[2:06:20] it's cool it's
[2:06:21] it's a morgue it's a place for death so
[2:06:25] what does he do he takes the word it
[2:06:27] takes quotes and he misinterprets and he
[2:06:29] twists it to rob people of their joy and
[2:06:31] their freedom in the house of God and
[2:06:33] I'm not afraid to call it out today
[2:06:35] this I'm going home today if you don't
[2:06:37] like me I'll be back in Louisiana it's
[2:06:38] okay
[2:06:39] I'm not afraid to call it out
[2:06:43] we can't we can't be dead
[2:06:45] none of we can't be he's not coming back
[2:06:47] for a dead church amen
[2:06:49] the first age relax and the Wolves came
[2:06:51] in and began to move the landmarks and
[2:06:52] I'm gonna do my best to bring the rest
[2:06:54] of this quickly brother Brown says
[2:06:56] repent quickly
[2:06:57] don't hesitate he says evidently Ephesus
[2:07:00] hesitated
[2:07:02] for her lifespan was not very long I
[2:07:04] want you to listen to this
[2:07:06] struck me so hard this is the age of
[2:07:08] Peter the age of Paul the age of Stephen
[2:07:10] and there's many others I know
[2:07:12] but listen
[2:07:13] the glory of God decreased ever so
[2:07:16] rapidly it was not the city was in Ruins
[2:07:19] its glorious Temple became a shapeless
[2:07:21] Mass the land became on Mars inhabited
[2:07:24] by waterfowl the population was gone
[2:07:26] except for a few unbelievers in a
[2:07:28] squalid Village there was not one
[2:07:31] Christian left
[2:07:34] the lamp had been rent
[2:07:37] from its place
[2:07:39] and it all started brother Brown tells
[2:07:42] it very clearly the church age by them
[2:07:43] trying to tone down the worship
[2:07:47] just tone it down a little bit because
[2:07:49] that jumping and shouting how am I gonna
[2:07:51] bring my boss man to work how am I going
[2:07:52] to bring this Roman general to the
[2:07:55] church service if y'all are acting like
[2:07:57] this just tone it down a little bit make
[2:07:58] it more presentable
[2:07:59] and it was in the toning down that the
[2:08:01] freedom was lost and the shackles were
[2:08:03] put on
[2:08:04] don't ever tone down your worship
[2:08:07] don't ever turn down your praise
[2:08:11] and from this point on the stones began
[2:08:13] to be moved and the landmarks slowly
[2:08:14] began to move a little here and move a
[2:08:16] little there and
[2:08:17] and we know about a lot of these the
[2:08:19] landmark of the of the baptism in the
[2:08:21] name of Jesus Christ would go on for for
[2:08:23] 300 years until Rome moved that landmark
[2:08:27] to a baptism in the titles a father Son
[2:08:30] and Holy Ghost
[2:08:31] I don't care how long they do it that
[2:08:34] way it'll never be the landmark of the
[2:08:36] word
[2:08:37] they can baptize that way for ten
[2:08:39] thousand years and it'll never be the
[2:08:40] landmark of the word because there was
[2:08:42] no person in the Bible ever baptized any
[2:08:44] other way than in the name of the Lord
[2:08:45] Jesus Christ that's a landmark
[2:08:48] that's a landmark in the word
[2:08:50] that'll never be the landmark of
[2:08:52] scriptural baptism to do in titles when
[2:08:55] Peter had just been given the kingdom he
[2:08:56] just keys to the kingdom he just come
[2:08:58] out of the upper room and they asked how
[2:09:00] can we be saved how can we receive what
[2:09:02] you've received he said repent be
[2:09:04] baptized every one of you in the Trinity
[2:09:07] Doctrine
[2:09:10] no repent every one of you and be
[2:09:13] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:15] Christ and then you shall receive the
[2:09:17] gift of the Holy Ghost that's a landmark
[2:09:19] it's a landmark in the scripture that we
[2:09:21] can't let be moved
[2:09:24] the truth of the godhead was moved
[2:09:26] listen they didn't believe in three Gods
[2:09:28] on the day of Pentecost
[2:09:30] they didn't believe in three Gods
[2:09:32] they're in the beginning of the church
[2:09:33] it became a foundational doctrine of
[2:09:34] Rome at the nazian council 325 A.D the
[2:09:38] truth of justification was moved
[2:09:40] the truth of sanctification was moved
[2:09:42] and in their place came man-made
[2:09:44] landmarks that wrongfully placed
[2:09:46] salvation in a church
[2:09:49] instead of in Jesus proper worshipings
[2:09:52] and spirit and truth that Landmark was
[2:09:53] moved
[2:09:54] the supernatural moving of the spirit
[2:09:56] amongst the people was moved and a new
[2:09:58] Landmark was set up to where God only
[2:10:00] spoke to the priesthood
[2:10:04] brother Brown says that false Vine was
[2:10:06] getting a hold and it was teaching that
[2:10:08] rulership by man was right
[2:10:10] taught that the church had to be
[2:10:11] governed it taught a control over the
[2:10:13] people but instead of doing it's God's
[2:10:15] way they simply took Authority invested
[2:10:17] all the spiritual power in their own
[2:10:19] hands and came out with a holy
[2:10:21] priesthood standing between God and the
[2:10:23] people
[2:10:24] he says and even right today those who
[2:10:26] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[2:10:28] there's not too much freedom in the
[2:10:30] laity
[2:10:31] and the best we can see is a few
[2:10:33] preachers with inspired preaching while
[2:10:35] the flock just sits there and tries to
[2:10:37] absorb it
[2:10:39] he said this is a far cry from Paul have
[2:10:41] said that when all came together all had
[2:10:44] the leading of the spirit and all
[2:10:46] participated in spiritual worship
[2:10:51] they stick with me for about 10 more
[2:10:52] minutes as we bring this to a close
[2:10:55] even John Wesley we don't often quote
[2:10:58] John Wesley but listen to him say this
[2:11:00] he says the grand reason why the
[2:11:03] miraculous gifts were so soon withdrawn
[2:11:05] was not only that faith in Holiness were
[2:11:08] lost but that dry formal Orthodox men
[2:11:12] began to ridicule the gifts that they
[2:11:16] themselves did not have
[2:11:19] and they began to decry all other gifts
[2:11:22] as Madness or imposter
[2:11:26] one generation is all it takes to become
[2:11:29] unrecognizable
[2:11:30] one generation for all this stuff listen
[2:11:32] there's a landmark for Holiness in the
[2:11:34] scripture we can talk about all this
[2:11:35] other stuff too that but there's also
[2:11:37] Holiness in the scripture as a landmark
[2:11:39] I'm not afraid to stand for
[2:11:42] the Bible speaks of a way a man should
[2:11:43] dress in the way a woman should dress
[2:11:45] the Bible speaks about a way we should
[2:11:47] keep our hair the way man should have
[2:11:48] short hair and a woman should have long
[2:11:49] hair those are landmarks in the Bible I
[2:11:51] didn't put them there he did we got to
[2:11:53] be willing to stand for
[2:11:55] it doesn't matter if it upset people the
[2:11:57] prophet of God would tell us he says he
[2:12:00] somebody says you're going to lose your
[2:12:01] ministry if you don't quit saying those
[2:12:02] things he said any Ministry that will be
[2:12:04] ruined by preaching the word needs to be
[2:12:06] ruined
[2:12:08] they're landmarks that we have to stand
[2:12:09] for
[2:12:10] I don't have to be ashamed in saying
[2:12:12] those things because it's in the word
[2:12:16] let me skip some of this
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:22] started so innocent that first age
[2:12:24] so subtle when it came in and but now
[2:12:26] the landmarks were totally moved and and
[2:12:28] the truths of God's word have been
[2:12:30] completely replaced by Creeds we can see
[2:12:32] that just looking at history and and
[2:12:34] down through the age if the landmarks
[2:12:36] removed further and further and further
[2:12:37] away from the original to where that
[2:12:39] church like we said earlier became
[2:12:41] unrecognizable and that seems like a a
[2:12:43] gloomy and a bleak picture but there was
[2:12:45] a scripture that said I will restore
[2:12:48] saith the Lord he wasn't going to leave
[2:12:51] the landmarks in that condition as a
[2:12:52] matter of fact it wasn't the landmarks
[2:12:54] that actually had moved it was the
[2:12:55] people that had moved away from the
[2:12:57] landmarks and he was calling people to
[2:12:59] come
[2:12:59] come back to the established truth come
[2:13:03] back to the established word it had been
[2:13:05] so far removed that it was
[2:13:06] unrecognizable but Luther comes and God
[2:13:09] works in his life and he takes the
[2:13:11] landmark of justification in this place
[2:13:13] back in his proper place and then he
[2:13:15] takes a Wesleyan he comes and he takes
[2:13:17] the landmark of sanctification and is
[2:13:19] put back in its proper place and then
[2:13:21] the Azusa movement God uses that
[2:13:24] movement to take the landmark of gifts
[2:13:26] working in the body and places them back
[2:13:28] in their proper place no they didn't
[2:13:29] stay in its proper place but he placed
[2:13:31] them properly
[2:13:32] they were placed properly oh my can't
[2:13:35] you see why we had to have Malachi 4 in
[2:13:37] this day can't you see why everything
[2:13:39] had to be turned back this Landmark was
[2:13:41] here this Landmark was there this
[2:13:42] Landmark was there but he said I will
[2:13:44] restore I'm going to turn you back to
[2:13:46] the faith I'm gonna turn you back to the
[2:13:48] landmarks I'm gonna turn you back to the
[2:13:50] truth and now that has come back and
[2:13:52] people want to start moving it again
[2:13:53] that's why I'm telling you tonight we
[2:13:55] got to contend we gotta stand we gotta
[2:13:57] fight we've got to defend the landmarks
[2:14:00] cause it only takes one generation it
[2:14:02] only takes a few years before suddenly
[2:14:04] things are unrecognizable and suddenly
[2:14:07] things are stories
[2:14:09] and suddenly that don't really matter
[2:14:10] anymore
[2:14:13] but the prophet of God comes
[2:14:16] and the godhead is put in his proper
[2:14:18] place baptism is put in his proper place
[2:14:20] predestination original sin the
[2:14:22] Mysteries are finished the tribulation
[2:14:23] of the church the Rapture of the bride
[2:14:25] all these things come and they get put
[2:14:27] in their their proper place and they get
[2:14:29] put in order
[2:14:31] and for the first time now here's where
[2:14:33] I'm trying to bring this back around to
[2:14:35] why I said we have to study the first
[2:14:37] church age to see where Satan came in
[2:14:39] because For the First Time In 2000 years
[2:14:42] Satan looks and goes
[2:14:44] I recognize that church
[2:14:49] I recognize that group
[2:14:51] I haven't seen them in 2000 years but
[2:14:53] I've seen them before
[2:14:54] that's that same group of people that
[2:14:55] came stumbling out of the upper room on
[2:14:57] the day of Pentecost I recognize them
[2:14:59] because suddenly the same power that
[2:15:01] cast him out then is casting him out now
[2:15:03] the same word that exposed them then is
[2:15:05] exposing him now the same word that
[2:15:07] would Trail the serpent is trailing the
[2:15:09] serpent again and he sees it and he says
[2:15:11] at that same group as those same people
[2:15:13] and he recognizes once again the power
[2:15:16] of God in the midst of a people and he
[2:15:18] says
[2:15:19] what caused them to fall the first time
[2:15:24] what worked the first time
[2:15:29] you're not facing new attacks you're
[2:15:31] facing the same attacks
[2:15:33] that the first church age faced because
[2:15:36] you're operating in the same power that
[2:15:39] first church age operated in but let me
[2:15:41] explain something to you they were
[2:15:42] predestinated to go into the ground why
[2:15:44] brother hearing because of you because
[2:15:47] you were
[2:15:48] predestinated to be the crop that came
[2:15:50] up in the last day they were
[2:15:51] predestinated
[2:15:53] oh they couldn't help it but you're
[2:15:55] predestinated not to fall you're
[2:15:57] predestinated to take a Rapture you're
[2:15:59] predestinated for a body change what are
[2:16:02] you scared for what are you worried
[2:16:03] about am I gonna make it yes you're
[2:16:05] gonna make it I can't help but make it I
[2:16:08] can't help but go
[2:16:09] you are the Rapture you are the message
[2:16:12] you are Jesus Christ in a broad body
[2:16:15] this Rapture can't go without me I am a
[2:16:19] Rapture that's what I've been called to
[2:16:22] don't let that choke you it's who you
[2:16:24] are it's what you're called to
[2:16:29] but he's coming to try to choke it out
[2:16:30] again
[2:16:31] how formalism questioning the
[2:16:34] supernatural questioning the authority
[2:16:36] of the word
[2:16:37] calling everything a worked up emotion
[2:16:41] slowly that snake trying to squeeze life
[2:16:43] again because the Revival
[2:16:46] excuse me the cycle of Revival and death
[2:16:49] has never failed
[2:16:51] until now
[2:16:53] there was a message and that go in the
[2:16:55] ground there was a message that go on
[2:16:56] the ground there was a message that go
[2:16:57] underground this day there was a message
[2:16:59] and we're going in a Rapture hallelujah
[2:17:01] it's this come Revival death Revival
[2:17:04] death Revival death Revival Rapture it's
[2:17:08] the time forward you're called to it
[2:17:10] it's what this message is all about it's
[2:17:13] not about correct doctrines although
[2:17:16] there are it's about a Rapture it's
[2:17:19] about a people it's about bone of his
[2:17:22] bone being manifested on this Earth
[2:17:24] again this bride recognizes the LIE
[2:17:27] you're not gonna Rob my joy you're not
[2:17:30] gonna Rob my praise you're not going to
[2:17:31] take my children you're not gonna take
[2:17:33] my health I'm here to stand on the
[2:17:35] landmarks I will fight for he is the
[2:17:37] same yesterday today and forever I will
[2:17:39] fight for by his stripes I am healed I
[2:17:41] will fight for the baptism of the Holy
[2:17:43] Ghost
[2:17:44] somebody's gonna stand
[2:17:46] in defend and say these are the
[2:17:49] landmarks and they belong to me and you
[2:17:52] cannot have them
[2:17:54] [Applause]
[2:17:58] you say you sure do repeat yourself a
[2:18:00] lot brother Aaron well I taught sixth
[2:18:02] graders for 15 years
[2:18:05] sometimes you need to hear things a few
[2:18:07] times before it starts sinking in
[2:18:09] he's talking to me
[2:18:14] you know who I'm talking to this morning
[2:18:15] you
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:18] in case you was wondering it's all about
[2:18:20] you
[2:18:22] it's all that's always been about you
[2:18:24] are people that would stand
[2:18:31] yes many times people wonder
[2:18:33] even in my home Church brother Aaron
[2:18:36] why are you always hammering about the
[2:18:38] supernatural why you always hammering
[2:18:40] about the gifts why you always hammering
[2:18:42] about the movie of the spirit
[2:18:44] because
[2:18:45] that's where the attack has been
[2:18:48] and when he comes in like a flood he
[2:18:50] raises up a standard
[2:18:53] that's where the attack has been
[2:18:55] and so because of that attack we're
[2:18:57] always putting it out there before you
[2:18:58] that's why we stand for the moving of
[2:19:01] the spirit and the new birth and the
[2:19:02] gifts in operation
[2:19:04] how long would it take
[2:19:06] I want you to think about this for a
[2:19:08] minute
[2:19:09] how long would it take if we just
[2:19:11] allowed these attacks to go unchallenged
[2:19:13] before the power of God was just a story
[2:19:17] and unfortunately in some places it is
[2:19:19] already
[2:19:21] to where it was just something that we
[2:19:23] once had and mama told me that this
[2:19:25] miracle happened one time
[2:19:27] how many of y'all have heard of Life
[2:19:29] Tabernacle Shreveport Louisiana
[2:19:31] brother Branham preached there over and
[2:19:33] over that's where brother Jack Moore was
[2:19:34] and he'd come to Shreveport all the time
[2:19:38] he preached sermons there like the token
[2:19:40] Investments the countdown invisible
[2:19:42] Union on the wings of a snow white dove
[2:19:45] and let me tell you that church sits
[2:19:47] there today
[2:19:48] then
[2:19:50] empty
[2:19:53] never accepted the fullness of the
[2:19:54] message at all
[2:19:57] William Branham is a name barely even
[2:19:59] remembered there now
[2:20:01] whispered amongst a few about maybe oh
[2:20:04] he was that guy that you know he he got
[2:20:06] off a little bit
[2:20:08] you know some people remember him as
[2:20:09] yeah he used to be a friend a pastor
[2:20:11] brother Jack Moore I found a a Facebook
[2:20:13] page of theirs because I live right
[2:20:15] there in Shreveport near it
[2:20:17] and it was the memories of Life
[2:20:18] Tabernacle and it was about the older
[2:20:20] people there in the congregation
[2:20:24] and a lot of the pictures were blocked
[2:20:26] because I wasn't a member and I don't
[2:20:27] think they was going to let me be
[2:20:29] [Music]
[2:20:30] but I could see a lot of them so I'd
[2:20:32] scroll through the pictures and see and
[2:20:33] I kept coming across pictures of brother
[2:20:35] Brown
[2:20:36] and most of them was because it was
[2:20:38] actually a picture of brother Jack Moore
[2:20:39] but brother Brown would be with him it
[2:20:41] was neat because there was a lot of
[2:20:42] these pictures I'd never seen before
[2:20:44] but in the comments you would see
[2:20:46] comments of people asking hey who's that
[2:20:48] guy with brother Jack
[2:20:52] look I just listed a couple of the
[2:20:53] sermons preached there he went there
[2:20:55] every year and held week-long meetings
[2:20:56] during Thanksgiving week
[2:20:58] every year and they say who is that guy
[2:21:02] oh that's one of brother Jack's Old
[2:21:04] Friends I think his name might have been
[2:21:06] Branham
[2:21:08] one generation
[2:21:11] towards just a whisper some little story
[2:21:14] look at the first age 120 years gone
[2:21:18] gone
[2:21:25] this isn't about denominations anymore
[2:21:28] you know for years you
[2:21:31] and I'm not saying it never gets
[2:21:32] preached but you hear a lot of sermons
[2:21:34] about what the denominations didn't have
[2:21:36] and why we had to come out and and that
[2:21:38] was all truth we were called out but
[2:21:40] listen to me
[2:21:41] when Israel got to kadish
[2:21:43] it wasn't about Pharaoh anymore
[2:21:47] they had already left Egypt
[2:21:51] there was a whole generation of people
[2:21:52] you know that were born in the
[2:21:54] wilderness that never knew Egypt
[2:21:57] it wasn't pharaoh and his army keeping
[2:21:59] the people from taking the land
[2:22:03] pharaoh and his army wasn't even there
[2:22:05] we got a quick point to the well this
[2:22:07] denomination this denomination this
[2:22:08] number they ain't hindering us
[2:22:10] this isn't us problem
[2:22:12] this isn't us problem we've been called
[2:22:14] to go take the land there's nobody here
[2:22:17] hindering us but us it's time that we
[2:22:20] throw down the shackles and throw down
[2:22:21] the fear and throw down the doubt it's
[2:22:23] in a crossover and take the land quit
[2:22:26] being afraid quit listening to the
[2:22:28] negative report quit surrounding
[2:22:30] yourself with negativity there's a
[2:22:33] reason Joshua only sent two spies into
[2:22:35] the land he didn't need the mother ten
[2:22:37] he was done with the negativity I say we
[2:22:40] start surrounding ourselves but people
[2:22:41] are saying yes we can yes we can take
[2:22:43] the land yes we can be healed yes we can
[2:22:46] be filled yes I can have my children yes
[2:22:48] I can have Victory yes I can have the
[2:22:51] land
[2:22:52] it's not them hindering us this isn't us
[2:22:54] problem we gotta face the music
[2:23:02] is a landmark
[2:23:03] you must repent
[2:23:05] you must be born again you must have the
[2:23:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:23:13] business
[2:23:14] I can have a couple more minutes
[2:23:17] this is ever since Israel was returned
[2:23:20] to the land
[2:23:22] and officially became a nation in 1948
[2:23:24] they've had to fight for their very
[2:23:26] existence
[2:23:27] they've had to defend their borders and
[2:23:29] their and their landmarks at all costs
[2:23:31] and listen because Israel knows what it
[2:23:33] means to be destroyed
[2:23:35] they knows what they know what it means
[2:23:36] to lose the land they know what it means
[2:23:38] to have a holocaust and for the enemy to
[2:23:41] try to wipe them out
[2:23:42] but ever since then for years now the
[2:23:44] enemy has been coming and actually
[2:23:46] attacking Jewish cultural sites or what
[2:23:49] we would call landmarks
[2:23:51] and many people around the world look at
[2:23:52] it and say well what's the big deal
[2:23:53] they're not actually attacking people
[2:23:55] they're not hurting people there aren't
[2:23:56] any casualties
[2:23:57] so it seems like no big deal
[2:24:00] but what groups like Isis and the
[2:24:02] different Palestinian groups have
[2:24:03] learned is that these landmarks give
[2:24:05] legitimacy to the Jewish culture
[2:24:08] and legitimacy to the claim the Jews
[2:24:10] that this land belonged to them first
[2:24:13] and so if they can destroy the landmarks
[2:24:16] they can wipe away the claim that the
[2:24:18] Jewish people have to the land
[2:24:20] they can wipe away the legitimacy of
[2:24:22] their right to even exist in that region
[2:24:25] and because the enemy claims that the
[2:24:27] land doesn't belong to them and it never
[2:24:28] was there sound familiar and it never
[2:24:31] was theirs but the landmarks prove
[2:24:33] otherwise
[2:24:34] the landmarks prove who was there first
[2:24:37] and so they come in and they attack it
[2:24:39] and they try to destroy these Heritage
[2:24:41] sites in the region in an attempt to
[2:24:44] wipe the Slate clean and rewrite history
[2:24:46] in their own image
[2:24:50] says the Palestinian Authority recently
[2:24:52] seized control over telleroma and
[2:24:55] brought in heavy engineering equipment
[2:24:56] to pave a road over parts of the ruins
[2:24:59] thereby causing inestimable damage
[2:25:02] adding insult to injury then they had
[2:25:05] the gall to hold a formal ceremony and
[2:25:08] declare that the built by The Maccabees
[2:25:11] to be a Palestinian heritage site
[2:25:16] not only does he tell you that you never
[2:25:18] had a right to this land but he tries to
[2:25:20] tell you it's always been mine
[2:25:23] listen it's true that man gave up our
[2:25:26] rights and our position when we fell
[2:25:30] but it never was his to belong with
[2:25:32] he was nothing but a squatter and the
[2:25:35] Lord Jesus comes and he tears it from
[2:25:37] that place and he puts us back every
[2:25:38] right he ever had was stripped from him
[2:25:40] that day on Calvary and he put you back
[2:25:42] in that position and all the landmarks
[2:25:45] down through the word true that the land
[2:25:46] is yours it proves that you were there
[2:25:48] first Satan wasn't there first man was
[2:25:51] there first the land belongs to us the
[2:25:53] Holy Ghost belongs to us that Eden
[2:25:55] belongs to us we're returning to a land
[2:25:58] of Eden we're returning to a millennium
[2:26:00] because it belongs to us it doesn't
[2:26:02] matter what the enemy has or what the
[2:26:05] enemy is then it'll never belong to him
[2:26:06] it belongs to us and he says it was
[2:26:09] never yours you never had a right to the
[2:26:11] holy ghost that the gifts are for a day
[2:26:13] gone by you can't have these things and
[2:26:15] it's an attack on the landmarks
[2:26:18] because he wants to prove that those
[2:26:20] things never exist today man
[2:26:23] but Israel has a motto
[2:26:26] if you ever I've never been but I have
[2:26:28] friends that go and and they they take
[2:26:30] these tours of these places and these
[2:26:32] holy sites
[2:26:33] and I don't remember the names of all of
[2:26:35] them they have this motto and their
[2:26:36] military motto is never again
[2:26:41] never again they said we tried to be
[2:26:42] passive we let the enemy come in and
[2:26:45] take us we let the enemy cage us up we
[2:26:47] let the enemy they said but never again
[2:26:50] never again I say it's time we adopt the
[2:26:52] motto of the Israelites never again will
[2:26:54] he come in and take my children never
[2:26:56] again is he gonna have my joy never
[2:26:58] again will I bow down to depression
[2:27:00] never again wipe out onto anxiety never
[2:27:03] again will I come to the house of God
[2:27:04] and fail to get praise where praise is
[2:27:06] due never again will I miss prayer time
[2:27:08] never again will I live gold never again
[2:27:11] will I live lukewarm never again will I
[2:27:14] backslide never again will I go back to
[2:27:16] the world never again never again never
[2:27:19] again he'll never rob me ever again I'm
[2:27:22] gonna defend the landmarks I'm gonna
[2:27:24] defend what's mine never again he won't
[2:27:28] take anything from me ever again I'll
[2:27:31] take my health I'll take my joy I'll
[2:27:33] have my family I'll have my children
[2:27:36] I'll have my worship I'll have the Holy
[2:27:38] Ghost I'll be robbed never again
[2:27:43] never again will I settle for lukewarm
[2:27:46] never again will I settle for cold never
[2:27:49] again
[2:27:51] never again
[2:27:54] I'm going to defend
[2:27:56] the landmarks
[2:28:00] he's looking for a people
[2:28:02] that'll be faithful
[2:28:05] he's looking for a people that'll stand
[2:28:09] because he stood
[2:28:11] how many can justify he's always been
[2:28:13] faithful
[2:28:16] he'll always be faithful
[2:28:18] he's asking will you be
[2:28:21] brother Matt would you come
[2:28:23] sing that song for me
[2:28:26] listen as he comes and gets ready to
[2:28:28] sing this song I want y'all to sing it
[2:28:30] with us in worship
[2:28:32] he's looking for people
[2:28:33] that'll defend the landmarks
[2:28:36] that'll stand for truth
[2:28:39] I almost made it through a whole sermon
[2:28:41] without talking about history I gotta
[2:28:43] tell y'all a story
[2:28:47] xenophon was a Greek mercenary General
[2:28:50] who led an expedition of ten thousand
[2:28:53] mercenary Greeks
[2:28:55] hired by Cyrus the younger to overthrow
[2:28:57] his brother the Persian king artist
[2:28:59] Xerxes
[2:29:00] and long story short it didn't go real
[2:29:02] well for Cyrus he got killed right off
[2:29:04] the bat
[2:29:05] now xenophon this Greek General stunk in
[2:29:08] a Strange Land with the ten thousand of
[2:29:10] his brothers and he's trying to get back
[2:29:11] home and he was a a writer and so he
[2:29:14] journals their Chronicle Chronicles
[2:29:16] their Journey Through the modern day
[2:29:18] land of our trying to get back to Greece
[2:29:21] and he writes about how
[2:29:24] they came through the modern day land of
[2:29:26] Iraq and they saw these absolutely
[2:29:28] massive fortifications bigger than
[2:29:31] anything ever built in Greece
[2:29:33] was John
[2:29:35] and he says in his writings we March one
[2:29:37] stage six pair of things to a great
[2:29:39] stronghold deserted and lying in Ruins
[2:29:43] the foundations of his wall was made of
[2:29:45] polished stone full of shells it was 50
[2:29:48] feet in breadth 50 in height upon this
[2:29:51] Foundation was built the wall of brick
[2:29:54] 50 feet wide and a hundred feet high and
[2:29:57] the Circuit of the wall was 20 miles
[2:30:02] think of the size of this city
[2:30:04] Giant
[2:30:06] beautiful
[2:30:07] it's beautiful like like this church
[2:30:09] come a beautiful place
[2:30:12] law there's life here
[2:30:14] there was once life in that City
[2:30:17] but it was deserted
[2:30:18] there wasn't a single soul there
[2:30:21] and the amazing thing about it is the
[2:30:23] general that was chasing them wrote
[2:30:24] about the same city
[2:30:26] so We Came Upon This City 21 miles
[2:30:28] behind all this giant stuff
[2:30:30] but no one knows anything about it no
[2:30:32] one knew who built it
[2:30:34] nobody knew the name of it
[2:30:37] it was all guessing
[2:30:39] and it comes to find out years later
[2:30:42] that it was the ancient Assyrian capital
[2:30:45] of Nineveh
[2:30:48] and this is only 200 years later what am
[2:30:52] I talking to you about how quick can
[2:30:53] things be lost
[2:30:55] 200 years later and nobody even knows
[2:30:57] what's going on
[2:30:59] because the medes and the Babylonians
[2:31:01] when they captured Assyria
[2:31:03] they wiped out every person
[2:31:06] and all the culture
[2:31:09] and they said we don't want anybody to
[2:31:11] ever remember this place even existed
[2:31:14] they wiped out everything so there'd be
[2:31:16] no remembrance
[2:31:19] 200 years and nobody knew
[2:31:21] and the devil would love to come
[2:31:24] and start wiping things out wipe out the
[2:31:27] moving of the spirit tour one day it's
[2:31:29] just a story man I remember it seems
[2:31:31] like people used to shout in our church
[2:31:34] no it seems like one time one time I
[2:31:36] think somebody spoke in tongues I'm not
[2:31:38] real sure
[2:31:40] I think one time there was a prophecy
[2:31:41] that I don't know if people here and
[2:31:44] people don't remember because it's all
[2:31:45] wiped out and it becomes a story and
[2:31:47] after a while the story even gets
