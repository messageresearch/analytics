[49:39] brother Josh Martin I don't know most of

[49:43] faces but I'm from PA Oklahoma my pastor
[49:46] is Brother wend Martin they and the
[49:48] Saints through New New Life Outreach
[49:50] they send their greetings and so um it's
[49:52] just good to be here tonight appreciate
[49:54] the opportunity to be ministering I'm
[49:56] just a simple preacher but I pray
[49:58] something can be said to help and to
[50:00] bless in some way but if you would have
[50:02] your Bibles let's open our scriptures to
[50:05] 2 Corinthians
[50:11] 4:15 I appreciate brother Austin and
[50:14] sister seren the opening up their house
[50:16] house to us I'm by myself this time my
[50:18] wife is normally with me but she's there
[50:21] in Ohio with her family um we we passed
[50:24] through the area quite a bit we stay
[50:25] with brother Austin and uh quite often
[50:28] and I was telling brother brother berer
[50:29] he's going to have to start charging us
[50:30] rent as many times as we stop in but we
[50:34] appreciate their friendship and their
[50:35] Hospitality I pray the Lord blesses them
[50:38] but 2 Corinthians
[50:40] 4:15 the Bible would say or 2
[50:43] Corinthians 4:15 for all things are for
[50:45] your sakes that the abundant grace might
[50:48] through the Thanksgiving of many redown
[50:50] to the glory of God for which cause we
[50:53] faint not but though our outward man
[50:56] perish yet the inborn man is renewed day
[50:58] by day for our light Affliction which is
[51:01] but for a moment worketh far for us more
[51:04] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[51:07] why we look not at the things which are
[51:09] seen But at the things which are not
[51:11] seen for the things which are seen are
[51:13] temporal but the things which are not
[51:15] seen are Eternal amen you thankful for
[51:18] that can we bow our heads tonight dear
[51:21] gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we
[51:23] love you Lord and we're thankful for
[51:25] your grace and your mercy God God thank
[51:27] you for what you've done for us Lord in
[51:29] this generation giving us this message
[51:31] God lord as we come into this portion of
[51:34] the service I ask that you would help me
[51:36] to get myself out of the way Lord you
[51:38] see the needs that are in the building
[51:39] tonight God lord only you can touch the
[51:42] hearts and meet the needs father Lord As
[51:44] I Lay myself aside I ask that you would
[51:46] speak tonight Lord Lord may you anoint
[51:49] the hearer as well father may they lay
[51:51] aside their thoughts God or what they
[51:53] may have done today Lord and receive
[51:55] what you have for them Lord
[51:57] God we lay the service into your hands
[51:59] in jesus' name amen and you may be
[52:02] seated tonight and if I had a subject it
[52:04] would be stabilized by the Unseen and
[52:07] these are just some things i' had been
[52:08] ministering on back at our our home
[52:10] church so hope it's okay if I just take
[52:12] my Liberty tonight but I I want want to
[52:15] start off by reading a quote brother
[52:17] Brandon would say because we got a
[52:19] prayer line coming up and many are
[52:21] standing the rooms and around the walls
[52:23] and so forth and I know you it's very
[52:26] hard on you and I stood a many time
[52:28] myself and I passed by a while ago
[52:31] bringing the wife down and I noticed the
[52:33] people around the doors and I thought
[52:35] who says the gospel still isn't the most
[52:37] attractive thing there is in the world
[52:40] sure it is it attracts those who are
[52:42] interested in it and I thought that was
[52:44] a powerful statement who says that the
[52:47] gospel still ain't the most attractive
[52:48] thing there is in the world and it
[52:51] attracts those who are interested in it
[52:53] and I believe that you're attracted to
[52:55] this message because you've realized
[52:58] there's something different about it you
[53:00] see brother Brandon would tell us that
[53:02] the uh the reason that the Rich Young
[53:04] Ruler would come to Jesus instead of the
[53:06] priests and ask for eternal life was
[53:09] because he knew they didn't have
[53:10] anything to offer but he realized that
[53:13] Jesus was something different so even
[53:15] though he couldn't accept what Jesus had
[53:17] he knew what he had was different and I
[53:20] believe the world can testify they might
[53:22] not be able to live what you've got but
[53:25] what you do have is something genuine
[53:27] it's an attraction that attracts those
[53:30] who are interested in it and I believe
[53:32] that this message has brought the Unseen
[53:35] into a reality where we're not just
[53:37] serving a god of the history books not
[53:39] just serving a god of of Noah or of
[53:42] Moses or or or just of Jesus but we're
[53:44] serving a god of today that can still
[53:47] still heal can still deliver can still
[53:50] encourage it's a god that is in the
[53:52] Unseen that has been brought into a
[53:55] reality and what what is so incredible
[53:57] is God has chose preachers to preach the
[54:00] realities of the Unseen and it's sort of
[54:03] incredible that God has chosen men with
[54:05] flaws to bring a Flawless message you
[54:08] know men that have heartaches and pains
[54:11] and aches and pains but as they get
[54:13] behind the the sacred desk and as they
[54:15] start to preach the word they're getting
[54:17] beyond what they think and letting you
[54:19] know this ain't a man's idea but this is
[54:23] God's word for you to bring a hope and
[54:25] an assurance and brother Brandon would
[54:27] tell us now God has chose preachers a
[54:30] God that could have chose the gospel to
[54:32] preach be preached by the son and by the
[54:34] moon and by the stars and by the wind or
[54:37] by nature but he chose men to preach the
[54:39] gospel and that's where the voice of God
[54:42] will come from and you can judge the
[54:44] voice according to the word it expresses
[54:47] then you can see what kind of voice
[54:50] you're listening to if it's contrary to
[54:53] the word don't listen to it but if it is
[54:55] the word then God is Duty bound to back
[54:58] that word up and vindicate it and make
[55:01] it the truth because he has promised to
[55:04] do it so we're living in a great day
[55:06] these words of Christ expressed and I
[55:09] thought that was powerful he would say
[55:11] we're living in a great day The Words of
[55:13] Christ expressed and so when a preacher
[55:16] gets up and he starts to minister he's
[55:18] bringing the word of Christ express to
[55:21] you where it's no longer no longer in a
[55:24] mystery form but we're bringing you you
[55:26] not a de letter but the realities of
[55:29] what is in the scripture that has been
[55:31] sealed up through all the church ages
[55:33] has been unveil to let you know that
[55:36] we're not serving a god of yesterday but
[55:38] a god of today and I left how brother
[55:40] Brandon would put it you can judge the
[55:43] voice according to the word it expresses
[55:46] he says if it's not expressing the word
[55:49] he says you don't have to listen to it
[55:51] but if it is the word then he says God's
[55:53] Duty bound to back it up and I say if
[55:56] you have a pastor here that is preaching
[55:59] the word of God you should get behind
[56:01] him you should get behind him with all
[56:02] of your might not just with your am man
[56:04] but support him because God has given
[56:07] you a voice that is lining up with the
[56:10] voice of God but I like how brother
[56:12] brownon would put it God is Duty bound
[56:14] to back up that word and that sort of
[56:16] takes the the pressure off of a Preacher
[56:19] whenever God's responsible for his word
[56:22] so it's not brother berer try to make
[56:24] you a good Christian brother berer
[56:26] trying to make you Rapture Ready all he
[56:28] is doing is coming under inspiration and
[56:32] preaching the word of God and as the
[56:34] word Falls in your heart then God comes
[56:37] and starts to Quicken it and make it
[56:39] live in your life you see Mark 16 and 20
[56:43] would say and they went forth and
[56:45] preached everywhere the Lord working
[56:47] with him confirming the sign confirming
[56:50] the word with signs following so all the
[56:53] disciples had to do was preach the
[56:55] gospel go El then God went with him
[56:58] confirming the word with signs falling
[57:01] so if you want to see a Revival preach
[57:03] the message if you want to see Miracles
[57:05] preach the message I believe the message
[57:08] has led us know the God is still a god
[57:10] of Miracles he's still the god that
[57:13] opens blinded eyes he's still the god
[57:15] that heals cancer he's still the god
[57:17] that can restore marriages all we got to
[57:19] do is point you to the Unseen and let
[57:22] you know that he is alive today not God
[57:26] of yesterday but he is a god of today oh
[57:31] we're bringing to you the word of God
[57:34] expressed and it's sort of incredible
[57:36] that whenever a preacher gets up and he
[57:38] starts to preach there's a boldness I
[57:40] I'm sure the ministers ministers can
[57:42] testify whenever you're there in the
[57:44] office you're nervous you know my my
[57:46] wife can can can testify every I I get
[57:48] butterflies in my stomach but as soon as
[57:50] you come under the anointing there's a
[57:53] confidence cuz you know that you're not
[57:55] preaching your yourself you're preaching
[57:57] the word of God and acts 2831 would say
[58:01] preaching the kingdom of God and
[58:03] teaching those things which concern the
[58:06] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence so
[58:09] as long as you're preaching the Lord
[58:11] Jesus Christ there's all confidence
[58:14] that's why the Apostle Paul would say I
[58:16] am not ashamed of the gospel for it is
[58:19] the power of God he realized what he had
[58:22] found and had anchored himself to was
[58:25] the power of God for this generation and
[58:28] that's why we're not ashamed of this
[58:30] message it is the supernatural that has
[58:33] been brought in this generation so a
[58:35] preacher don't get up and preach at dos
[58:38] and don'ts and condemnation sometimes it
[58:40] steps on your toes but he's not
[58:42] preaching condemnation he's preaching
[58:45] grace to you you see how would you know
[58:47] to fix things if you never knew you was
[58:49] wrong right so sometimes it hurts
[58:52] whenever the preacher steps on your toes
[58:54] but it is the grace of God letting you
[58:57] know if you continue going that that way
[59:00] you're going to end up in a failure end
[59:02] up in a wreck but the grace of God comes
[59:05] and says hey if you can change it this
[59:07] way you can see the realities in your
[59:10] life so a preacher Don't Preach dos and
[59:12] don'ts and condemnation but he's
[59:15] preaching grace to you and whenever you
[59:18] can't see victory for yourself a
[59:20] preacher sees victory for you and that's
[59:22] what's so incredible is I can testify of
[59:25] it when whenever I've had a hard day of
[59:27] work you know I'm sort of discouraged
[59:29] things ain't going the right way but I
[59:31] come to church even even though I'm
[59:33] discouraged and as the preacher begins
[59:36] to preach he's preaching Victory to me
[59:38] he's preaching over what I am going
[59:41] through and lifting me up that I can see
[59:45] what he's talking about you see a
[59:47] preacher preaches under inspiration that
[59:49] I I believe that that when he's studying
[59:52] even though he might have notes they're
[59:54] inspired as he's praying praying and as
[59:56] he's studying listening to tapes it's
[59:59] God inspiring him what direction to go
[1:00:02] so whenever you're sitting on the Pew
[1:00:05] and he's preaching he's preaching an
[1:00:07] inspired word over the conditions that
[1:00:10] you're setting in so when you're setting
[1:00:13] discouraged and all you see is your bad
[1:00:15] day all you see is your failures all
[1:00:18] that you can see are the mistakes you
[1:00:20] make and when the preacher begins to
[1:00:22] preach he's breaking a way where you can
[1:00:25] see into the Unseen realm that he's
[1:00:28] preaching by and when you can't see
[1:00:31] victory for yourself he's preaching
[1:00:33] Victory where when you come into the
[1:00:35] church discouraged you can leave the
[1:00:38] church encouraged you see it's not what
[1:00:40] the preacher can do he's preaching the
[1:00:43] Unseen which is breaking away for you to
[1:00:46] see it for yourself you see I believe
[1:00:49] this message ain't just a preacher's
[1:00:52] message it's a Young Person's message
[1:00:54] it's a mama and a daddy message you know
[1:00:57] so as we begin to preach the word
[1:00:59] there's something identifying with the
[1:01:02] word that is being brought to you you
[1:01:04] see brother Brandon he he would talk
[1:01:06] about the eagle and would say when Mama
[1:01:08] Eagle would would would go by that that
[1:01:10] barnyard you know we all know the story
[1:01:12] of the eagle of the the the farmer that
[1:01:14] would snatch the eagle egg and would put
[1:01:16] it under the chicken you know and so
[1:01:18] this little Eagle would grow up with the
[1:01:20] chickens and he wouldn't know any better
[1:01:22] all he knew was the Barnyard all he knew
[1:01:25] was to eat the scrap that the rest of
[1:01:27] the chickens were eating you know and
[1:01:28] brother brandom says whenever that eagle
[1:01:31] would fly by across that barnyard and
[1:01:34] would begin to scream but the brandom
[1:01:36] says it was Eagle to Eagle so all he had
[1:01:39] to do was respond to the voice that was
[1:01:42] calling kid name you see the chickens
[1:01:45] didn't have nothing to respond with they
[1:01:48] Ste there heard the same message they
[1:01:50] heard the same voice but there was no
[1:01:52] attraction there was no response then
[1:01:55] brother br says it's the word spoken to
[1:01:58] the word predestinated so when the word
[1:02:01] comes across your life it is word
[1:02:04] responding to word and you sit there and
[1:02:07] some might not understand it you know
[1:02:08] but the Brandon would tell us that there
[1:02:10] can be two sitting in the same sitting
[1:02:12] in the same congregation one would say
[1:02:15] hey he called me a buzzard the other
[1:02:16] says well he called me an eagle you see
[1:02:19] you can hear the same things but what
[1:02:21] are you attracted to and I can say I'm
[1:02:23] sure you're attracted to the m message
[1:02:26] of the hour because it is who you are
[1:02:29] you come from the mind of God so has
[1:02:31] this message this message came from the
[1:02:34] mind of God to let you know that you are
[1:02:36] my Invincible Army upon the Earth today
[1:02:40] that you can live in the Unseen realm
[1:02:42] even though your body is walking upon
[1:02:45] the Earth you know brother Brandon would
[1:02:47] tell us that Jesus would walk in another
[1:02:49] world with perfect Faith he would say
[1:02:52] that they're in the message perfect
[1:02:53] Faith he would say he would walk in this
[1:02:55] other the world and his garments had
[1:02:57] virtues flowing out of them ain't that
[1:02:59] incredible and he says whenever the the
[1:03:01] the woman with the issue of blood would
[1:03:04] touch that garment he said healing would
[1:03:06] come to that to that young lady because
[1:03:09] he was walking in another world and
[1:03:11] what's so incredible is he would not
[1:03:14] just leave that with Jesus then he would
[1:03:16] say every man that walks along with God
[1:03:20] walks in another world with God and he
[1:03:22] says then virtues are flowing out of you
[1:03:25] ain't that incredible that it was you if
[1:03:28] you look at it it was the very garments
[1:03:30] of Jesus that made him ordinary right he
[1:03:33] didn't come in in Royal apparel if he
[1:03:36] would came in Royal apparel I'm sure the
[1:03:38] priest might have listened to him you
[1:03:40] know because he maybe he he he looked
[1:03:42] like he was prestigious and things but
[1:03:44] it was his ordinary garments that turned
[1:03:47] them away from Jesus so it was his
[1:03:49] ordinary garments that God chose virtue
[1:03:52] to come out of and extraordinary skins
[1:03:56] that in this generation the virtues of
[1:03:58] healing and encouragement and
[1:04:00] strengthening for your brother and to
[1:04:02] your sister can come out of your
[1:04:04] ordinary garments what are you talking
[1:04:07] about brother Josh your ordinary dust
[1:04:09] you've got aches you've got pains you've
[1:04:11] got mind battles but when you're walking
[1:04:13] in this other world in the Unseen with
[1:04:16] God virtues are coming out of your
[1:04:19] Humanity when your brother is
[1:04:21] discouraged you can lift him up it's not
[1:04:24] what you can do you're living living in
[1:04:26] an unseen realm and the virtues of God
[1:04:29] are just being
[1:04:31] expressed oh you see I believe we're
[1:04:33] we're we're upon Earth to do more than
[1:04:35] just be a benchwarmer to do more than
[1:04:37] just to lift our hands and worship God
[1:04:40] we're on Earth to express the attributes
[1:04:43] of a living savior in this generation
[1:04:46] you know somebody's got to express the
[1:04:48] attributes but the Brandon would tell us
[1:04:50] that before the sun was created and
[1:04:53] before the moon was created God was God
[1:04:55] alone right and he says God is a god a
[1:04:58] an object of worship so he wasn't even
[1:05:01] God at this point he was El Elohim
[1:05:04] Elohim and he would say that there was
[1:05:06] no Angels there was nobody to worship
[1:05:09] Him and inside of this being was
[1:05:11] attributes he would say there was an
[1:05:13] attribute to be a Healer an attribute to
[1:05:16] be a deliverer a friend a savior but
[1:05:18] since he was God Alone there was nobody
[1:05:21] to express these things to and so he
[1:05:23] would create Angels brother the Brandon
[1:05:25] would tell us in the adoption series I
[1:05:27] believe part two I believe he says he
[1:05:29] created angels and then angels will come
[1:05:31] and worship him and so now the object of
[1:05:34] worship is being expressed but he still
[1:05:36] have these attributes to be a Healer a
[1:05:39] deliverer a friend a sustainer but there
[1:05:43] was nobody to express these attributes
[1:05:45] to and so when man fell in the beginning
[1:05:48] you know the the Satan thought he poured
[1:05:50] one on God but this made a way for God
[1:05:53] to express himself in a personal way way
[1:05:55] to you how would you know God could heal
[1:05:58] if you never was sick how could you know
[1:06:00] God could deliver if you never was bound
[1:06:03] and so now upon Earth today is some
[1:06:05] Fallen human beings in ordinary garments
[1:06:09] ordinary skins with
[1:06:11] Humanity that comes against your mind
[1:06:14] but in those skins the attributes of
[1:06:16] Christ are being expressed oh the same
[1:06:20] mind battles that has taken the ordinary
[1:06:23] The Ordinary World member to to the
[1:06:25] grave and in discouragement is not
[1:06:28] pulling you down because there's another
[1:06:30] attribute in the inside of you which is
[1:06:33] from God and it is just expressing
[1:06:36] itself oh Hallelujah you see we're we're
[1:06:39] living in the Unseen realm and I believe
[1:06:42] that I know that was sort of a rabbit
[1:06:44] Trail hope that was okay but brother
[1:06:45] Brandon was saying no Lord as I speak
[1:06:48] tonight of David with the little
[1:06:50] slingshot he was interested in the
[1:06:52] father's sheep and no matter how little
[1:06:54] he was he was ready to display and
[1:06:58] Conquer with what little he had to
[1:07:00] conquer with you was with him and I love
[1:07:03] this part of the quot this is in
[1:07:04] perseverance and he would say Lord I am
[1:07:07] coming after the Sheep tonight he says
[1:07:09] they've been sick I've obeyed your
[1:07:11] Commandments and and you showed your
[1:07:13] presence your willingness you've healed
[1:07:15] them with cards and without cards
[1:07:18] showing that you are here you never fail
[1:07:21] you're the omnipresent God and I'm
[1:07:23] coming to challenge the devil that would
[1:07:25] keep them behind the sound barrier of
[1:07:28] unbelief and now that I pray them
[1:07:30] through tonight and I catch this part he
[1:07:33] says I break the way with the word of
[1:07:36] God and set them free in the name of the
[1:07:39] Lord Jesus Christ I bring them back to
[1:07:42] Faith come out Satan ain't that powerful
[1:07:45] he would say that David would look at
[1:07:47] that little sheep whenever that little
[1:07:49] sheep was about to be conquered it did
[1:07:51] not matter how little of a weapon that
[1:07:54] David had he had the best the interest
[1:07:57] of that sheep in mind and that's
[1:07:59] encouraging as a preacher cuz sometimes
[1:08:02] you don't feel like you have much to
[1:08:03] bring but is whatever God has placed
[1:08:06] upon your heart to bring God could use
[1:08:09] that and interest somebody into coming
[1:08:13] into a full Victory and then brother
[1:08:15] Brandon would say I break away with the
[1:08:17] word of God ain't the powerful of
[1:08:20] brother Brown I'm is saying here that
[1:08:22] he's not breaking away by a vision he's
[1:08:24] not breaking Away by the first pull or
[1:08:26] the second pull laying hands on the sick
[1:08:28] you know but he's breaking away by the
[1:08:31] word of God to bring them out of doubt
[1:08:34] and into faith and that is what a
[1:08:36] minister does every time he's behind the
[1:08:39] pulpit he's preaching a faith that can
[1:08:42] lift you up and break away out of your
[1:08:45] discouragement break away out of your
[1:08:48] depression that you can see victory for
[1:08:52] yourself oh Hallelujah God just don't
[1:08:55] want preachers having Victory he wants
[1:08:57] the Ley having Victory you remember
[1:08:59] there in the Old Testament it was only
[1:09:01] the high priest that can go into the
[1:09:03] third Court remember the the the
[1:09:06] worshipper can go in those other courts
[1:09:08] but never could go into that third Court
[1:09:10] only the high priest could go into that
[1:09:13] third court and it was only about once a
[1:09:16] year but the Bible would tell us that
[1:09:18] whenever Christ was upon P the cross he
[1:09:20] would rent that Veil so it's no longer
[1:09:23] just the ministry having victory but it
[1:09:25] is whosoever will let him come unto me
[1:09:29] and I will give him a rest it's letting
[1:09:31] you know if you're attracted to the
[1:09:34] Unseen you can have a victory you can
[1:09:37] have a liberty you can have a joy not
[1:09:40] just on Sunday not just on Wednesday but
[1:09:42] every day of the life every day of the
[1:09:44] week when you're at school when you're
[1:09:46] at work when you're in the kitchen
[1:09:48] wherever you're at you can have
[1:09:51] Victory you're broken into an unseen
[1:09:54] realm where just you and God oh that's
[1:09:58] where we belong you know brother the
[1:10:00] Brandon would tell us that our position
[1:10:02] as a Believer is in Heavenly places with
[1:10:05] Christ Jesus he says that's the
[1:10:07] believer's position not in an nor realm
[1:10:10] but in a Heavenly place in Christ Jesus
[1:10:14] Oh Hallelujah so it's the word of God
[1:10:16] that breaks away that brings you back to
[1:10:19] Faith out of your discouragement and
[1:10:21] what is so incredible is Isaiah 61 And1
[1:10:25] would say the spirit of the Lord God is
[1:10:27] upon me because the Lord hath anointed
[1:10:30] me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek
[1:10:33] and has sent me to bind up the
[1:10:34] Brokenhearted and Proclaim Liberty to
[1:10:37] the captives and the opening of the
[1:10:39] prison to them that are bound what is
[1:10:42] doing all of these things the preaching
[1:10:44] of the Gospel oh and Jesus would pick
[1:10:47] that up there in Luke and would say this
[1:10:49] day the scripture is fulfilled and
[1:10:51] brother Brandon would tell us that if
[1:10:54] Jesus was upon the Earth today he would
[1:10:56] only do what he did back then and it's
[1:10:59] so Inc I'll just read it to you he says
[1:11:01] the only thing he could do now he might
[1:11:04] he might do like he did when he was on
[1:11:06] Earth because the Bible says he's the
[1:11:08] same yesterday today and forever he says
[1:11:11] is that right and when he was on the
[1:11:14] earth he didn't claim to be any great
[1:11:16] person he just preached the gospel so
[1:11:19] what what brought forth Liberty what
[1:11:22] opened the prison to them that are bound
[1:11:24] the preaching of the gospel and how did
[1:11:26] this take place in the life of Jesus for
[1:11:29] the Lord God hath anointed me to preach
[1:11:32] the gospel so whenever Jesus went off of
[1:11:35] the earth his Spirit came back right to
[1:11:38] the 120 that was in the upper room and
[1:11:41] they would come out and they would a the
[1:11:43] the multitudes would ask would ask the
[1:11:45] disciples what must we do to be saved
[1:11:48] repent be baptized what is it they
[1:11:50] started preaching the same gospel that
[1:11:53] Jesus started oh oh and I believe that
[1:11:56] the message of the hour the preaching of
[1:11:58] it did not go away when Jesus went off
[1:12:01] of the scene when brother Brandon went
[1:12:03] off for the scene but the same Angel of
[1:12:05] the Lord that accompanied brother
[1:12:08] Brandon in all of those prayer lines and
[1:12:10] all of those meetings is the same angel
[1:12:12] that is accompanying the preaching of
[1:12:15] the Gospel tonight oh I say whatever you
[1:12:18] have need of the spirit of the Lord God
[1:12:20] has anointed a preacher to let you know

[1:12:36] the preaching of the Gospel that lets

[1:12:54] you know he would he would get so tired
[1:12:56] in his Humanity that he would fall
[1:12:58] asleep upon the boat but you notice he
[1:13:00] would not let his Humanity get the best
[1:13:02] of him Humanity would get tired and he
[1:13:06] would go to sleep Humanity would cry at
[1:13:09] the grave of Lazarus Humanity would have
[1:13:12] a headache Humanity would struggle with
[1:13:15] self-will In The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:13:18] and would say if it's possible let this
[1:13:20] cup pass from me the deity on the inside
[1:13:24] would stand upon on the power of the
[1:13:26] boat and say peace be still deity would
[1:13:29] square up his shoulders wipe away the
[1:13:31] tears and say Lazarus come forth deity
[1:13:35] would sit there in agonizing and would
[1:13:37] say not my will but thy will be done let
[1:13:40] it you know you might fight your
[1:13:43] Humanity but you can walk in another
[1:13:46] world you can walk in another world
[1:13:49] where your Humanity don't get the best
[1:13:51] of you oh what are you talking about
[1:13:54] brother Josh I'm saying that deity ain't
[1:13:57] A Million Miles Away deity is back in
[1:14:02] humanity Hallelujah you know but the
[1:14:04] Brandon would say that but the Brandon
[1:14:06] would say that it was once Badgers
[1:14:09] living in behind those Badger skins
[1:14:11] there in the Tabernacle you remember him
[1:14:13] talking about that in the unveiling of
[1:14:14] God he says but now it's the housing
[1:14:17] place for the sh glory of God and he
[1:14:19] says so can your skins be changed in to
[1:14:23] the housing place of the kind of
[1:14:25] presence of God what are you talking
[1:14:27] about brother Josh deity the Unseen has
[1:14:31] become materialized inside of some more
[1:14:35] Humanity Hallelujah that's why we're
[1:14:38] more than conquerors through Christ
[1:14:40] Jesus who loved us it ain't you fighting
[1:14:43] your battles it's God fighting your
[1:14:48] battles Hallelujah that's why we don't
[1:14:51] fear cancer it ain't us fighting it
[1:14:54] God's fighting the battle that's why we
[1:14:56] don't fear discouragement it ain't us
[1:14:58] fighting it's God fighting the battle
[1:15:01] Hallelujah but we got to let God fight
[1:15:04] the
[1:15:05] battle oh Hallelujah you God can't fight
[1:15:09] the battle if you're fighting the
[1:15:10] battle come on
[1:15:13] now if you're fighting bitterness you
[1:15:15] got to give up and let God fight it you
[1:15:17] know brother the brand I'm would talk
[1:15:19] about Jehoshaphat there and stand still
[1:15:21] and see the salvation of God he would
[1:15:23] say Jehoshaphat was is doing the to the
[1:15:25] best of his ability to serve the Lord
[1:15:28] and the nation of Judah and he says then
[1:15:30] the moabites come up against the nation
[1:15:33] of Judah and he says as long as they
[1:15:35] stayed together and prayed God fought
[1:15:38] the battles and I that that's that
[1:15:40] that's incredible brother brother berer
[1:15:42] is because they had to stay together and
[1:15:44] what the devil likes to do is he sends
[1:15:47] troubles to a church to divide oh I'm
[1:15:50] preaching now he sends bitterness to
[1:15:53] divide he sends complexes to divide he s
[1:15:56] he he he sends insecurities to divide
[1:15:59] but this ain't the time to be divided
[1:16:02] this is the time to come
[1:16:04] together oh the Apostle Paul would say
[1:16:07] prove all things and that it is good
[1:16:10] hold on to it hold on to the things that
[1:16:13] is good bitterness ain't good oh
[1:16:16] Hallelujah complexes ain't good prove
[1:16:18] all things and hold fast to them that
[1:16:21] are good oh Hallelujah huah you see
[1:16:26] bitterness ain't something of God it's
[1:16:28] something to cause a division but you
[1:16:30] got to prove it and prove all things
[1:16:32] then hold fast to that which is good oh
[1:16:36] Hallelujah and so we would see that God
[1:16:38] has called us for a greater purpose than
[1:16:41] just than just to be a benchwarmer but
[1:16:43] he has called you to be a be to be a
[1:16:46] Powerhouse upon the Earth today and
[1:16:48] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[1:16:50] the true Gospel Light the real light of
[1:16:53] God shows what a man's need is and so
[1:16:56] that's why we need the preaching of the
[1:16:58] gospel because it shows you what you
[1:17:00] need to achieve Victory you know it
[1:17:03] shows you what you need to get into this
[1:17:06] other realm with God and and brother
[1:17:08] Brandon would tell us that Noah would
[1:17:10] Point them to something when Noah begin
[1:17:13] to preach it's going to rain he didn't
[1:17:15] just get up and say it's going to rain
[1:17:17] it's going to rain it's going to rain
[1:17:18] but he was pointing to something it's
[1:17:21] going to rain but there's an ark that
[1:17:23] can carry us away away from the
[1:17:25] judgments that are coming upon the Earth
[1:17:28] and so he did not just preach Doom and
[1:17:31] Gloom but he preached gloom and doom but
[1:17:33] there's Grace out of it oh Hallelujah so
[1:17:36] this a message ain't just gloom and doom
[1:17:38] you know that the world's going insane
[1:17:40] America's under judgment but a brought a
[1:17:43] Grace saying there's a transportation
[1:17:46] out of this and I'm showing you what you
[1:17:49] have need of to escape the judgments
[1:17:52] that are upon the Earth today you see
[1:17:55] complexes or judgments upon the Earth
[1:17:58] but it don't pertain to you right you
[1:18:01] remember whenever the the children of
[1:18:02] Israel was in Egypt the plagues that
[1:18:04] came in Egypt was not for the children
[1:18:07] of Israel it was for the Egyptians so
[1:18:09] even though they were among them they
[1:18:12] weren't they weren't partaking of them
[1:18:14] so whenever the death angel would go
[1:18:16] through the land they had an Avenue to
[1:18:19] escape the death
[1:18:21] angel oh Hallelujah so whenever they
[1:18:24] would hear the cries of the firstborn
[1:18:27] screaming this one losing their child
[1:18:29] this one's marriage is falling apart
[1:18:31] this one's child has going in a
[1:18:33] rebellious teenage year they will know
[1:18:35] that I'm under the transportation that
[1:18:38] God has given us and with America is
[1:18:41] under judgment but it does not pertain
[1:18:43] to you you don't got to lose your
[1:18:45] children to the world you don't got to
[1:18:47] lose your mind to complexes and
[1:18:50] insecurities and anxiety God has
[1:18:53] provided a way of Escape away from the
[1:18:56] from the the the judgments that are upon
[1:18:59] the Earth
[1:19:01] today oh Hallelujah I'm feeling good
[1:19:04] this evening you see but you got to look
[1:19:07] away you got to look to something you
[1:19:09] know but brother Brandon would tell us
[1:19:11] that that if you're driving and and the
[1:19:13] message look and brother Brandon would
[1:19:15] say if you're driving by something and
[1:19:18] you see a certain scene you say look and
[1:19:21] he says if you want somebody else to see
[1:19:23] it he says you say look to get their
[1:19:26] attention and I love how brother Brandon
[1:19:28] describes it he says then you go from
[1:19:30] saying look to describing what you see
[1:19:33] and I thought that was powerful because
[1:19:35] brother Brandon would say look there's a
[1:19:37] cactus there's a tree there's a mountain
[1:19:39] so it ain't just saying look but there's
[1:19:42] a purpose of changing your focus because
[1:19:45] there was a certain scene that we want
[1:19:47] you to see and brother Brandon would
[1:19:50] tell us that whenever Jesus would come
[1:19:52] to to uh John the Baptist in the Jordan
[1:19:55] River he would say Behold the Lamb of
[1:19:57] God which taketh away the sin of the
[1:19:59] world and the word behold means to look
[1:20:02] and so brother the Brandon would tell us
[1:20:04] that the attraction was John the Baptist
[1:20:07] he says but when Jesus came upon the
[1:20:09] scene the attraction would go from the
[1:20:12] prophet to the prophecy so John the
[1:20:15] Baptist would say look because there was
[1:20:18] a certain scene that was unfolding to
[1:20:21] take away the sins of the world oh
[1:20:24] Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say
[1:20:27] look look away to Jesus look unto Jesus
[1:20:30] look to the Unseen he was preaching
[1:20:32] these messages and not just to say look
[1:20:35] but he was describing to you that the
[1:20:37] Unseen has been made visible that the
[1:20:41] message is more than tapes and quotes
[1:20:43] and and doctrines and phrases and things
[1:20:46] that we say it's a it's not an ult but
[1:20:48] it is the realities that you can look at
[1:20:52] and achieve it oh hallah
[1:20:55] that you can look at and and grab for
[1:20:57] yourself you see if you can't experience
[1:21:00] a living God why serve him come on now
[1:21:04] that ain't the time to get quiet if you
[1:21:06] can't experience a living God why come
[1:21:08] to church if you can't experience a
[1:21:11] friend that Stith closer than a brother
[1:21:13] why serve him and you may say well
[1:21:14] that's off boat but it's true I believe
[1:21:17] we can all experience a living God but
[1:21:20] the brand going tell the story of the
[1:21:22] little boy he wanted to see God y youall
[1:21:24] remember the story and he would come up
[1:21:26] to his mama and would say mama can
[1:21:28] anybody see God and she would say son
[1:21:30] that's the Sunday school teacher he
[1:21:32] would come up to the Sunday school
[1:21:33] teacher Sunday school teacher can
[1:21:35] anybody see God and she would say no son
[1:21:38] nobody can see God and live and so he
[1:21:40] would go out of the class would go to
[1:21:42] the preacher and would say preacher can
[1:21:44] anybody see God and he would say no son
[1:21:47] nobody can see God and live why serve a
[1:21:50] God that you can't see right so he was
[1:21:52] discouraged and heartbroken and but the
[1:21:54] Brandon would tell us that he was
[1:21:56] walking down a down a path towards the
[1:21:58] lake and there was a rainbow and Y y'all
[1:22:01] know the story there was a rainbow and
[1:22:03] there was an old man sitting in a boat
[1:22:05] upon the lake and he was looking at that
[1:22:07] rainbow with tears coming down his face
[1:22:10] and the little boy would run and jump in
[1:22:12] that boat and would say Sir can anybody
[1:22:15] see God and he would say son that's all
[1:22:17] I have seen for the past 35 years has
[1:22:20] been God mama was looking up the same
[1:22:23] rainbow Daddy was looking at the same
[1:22:25] rainbow the Sunday school teacher the
[1:22:27] preacher was looking at the same rainbow
[1:22:30] but seen all they seen was clouds but
[1:22:33] this old man had been through some
[1:22:35] storms he had been through some
[1:22:37] discouragements and could see that that
[1:22:39] is more than a cloud that is a promise
[1:22:42] that is a covenant and if God has kept
[1:22:44] his promised to Noah all of these years
[1:22:48] he's not going to fail to keep his
[1:22:50] promise for you oh Hallelujah this boy
[1:22:55] went from hearing you can't see God to a
[1:22:58] man saying I've experienced God you can
[1:23:00] see him too I've experienced God you can
[1:23:04] see him too and I love that because he
[1:23:07] would say that's all I've seen you see
[1:23:09] so whenever you see God with an
[1:23:12] understanding you see him everywhere you
[1:23:14] look up the trees you see God and what's
[1:23:17] incredible is the same things that is
[1:23:19] turning the unbelievers away it's
[1:23:22] causing you to believe
[1:23:24] you remember whenever the the the uh the
[1:23:26] two ladies would go to the Tomb of Jesus
[1:23:29] the Bible says that they would come to
[1:23:31] the Tomb at the rising of the Sun and
[1:23:33] they found the body of Christ gone and
[1:23:36] that discouraged him the Bible says they
[1:23:38] were perplexed the word is confused or
[1:23:40] or discouraged and you would think that
[1:23:43] the tomb being empty was evidence he was
[1:23:46] alive right and since they since since
[1:23:50] they had since they hadn't experienced
[1:23:52] the realities of it there were looking
[1:23:54] at an empty tomb and saying what
[1:23:57] happened here and here in Angel and what
[1:23:59] I love about the story is the Angels
[1:24:01] started to talk to them and say why do
[1:24:03] you seek the living among the dead in
[1:24:06] other words you can't find the realities
[1:24:09] looking in a denominational system oh
[1:24:13] Hallelujah you got to change the way
[1:24:16] that you're looking at the word
[1:24:17] according to the priests and you got to
[1:24:20] look up the way the Christ brought it
[1:24:22] you see oh my if you're looking at the
[1:24:25] word in a way that some preacher was
[1:24:27] telling you to look at it you might look
[1:24:29] at it the wrong way but God has sent a
[1:24:32] message and Vindicated that message and
[1:24:35] say here Look Away to Jesus and you can
[1:24:38] see it and what's so incredible about
[1:24:41] that story is the Bible says that the
[1:24:43] Angels started to talk to them and
[1:24:45] started to started to remind them you
[1:24:47] remember how Jesus spoke to you how he
[1:24:50] said these things had to come to pass
[1:24:52] and the Bible says they remembered his
[1:24:54] words it was an angel that would Point
[1:24:57] them back to the very words of Jesus and
[1:25:01] the remembrance of Jesus words would
[1:25:04] bring a reality to their heart that he
[1:25:07] is not here but he is alive and I'm so
[1:25:10] glad we had an angel in this generation
[1:25:13] that says quit looking at it that way
[1:25:15] look at the word this way and you can
[1:25:18] see that he is
[1:25:21] alive hallelujah oh my brother Brandon
[1:25:24] would say this and looking in the Unseen
[1:25:26] he would say what where if you look at
[1:25:28] with your eyes you see now that are
[1:25:30] nation is shaking and tribling War
[1:25:33] clouds are flying everywhere every
[1:25:35] nation is distressed in a perplexity of
[1:25:37] time every sign that Jesus said would
[1:25:40] happen is happening there would be signs
[1:25:42] in the heavens above and in the earth
[1:25:44] below great things would be taking place
[1:25:47] like flying saucers and and Mystic
[1:25:49] things taking place and I love this part
[1:25:51] of the quote he says but he commanded he
[1:25:54] Church to lift up their heads in that
[1:25:56] day and to look up for the Unseen Christ
[1:26:00] will be appearing pretty soon I thought
[1:26:03] that was powerful cuz brother Brandon
[1:26:05] was saying Jesus would tell there there
[1:26:08] be distress of Nations this here is
[1:26:10] going to be happening this is going to
[1:26:11] be taking place and brother brandom says
[1:26:14] we see it taking place now but then he
[1:26:16] would go back to the words of Jesus and
[1:26:18] would say but he commanded the church to
[1:26:21] look up and lift up their eyes for the
[1:26:23] UN seen Christ will be appearing I
[1:26:26] thought that was powerful because he
[1:26:28] would say he commanded not suggested the
[1:26:31] church but commanded the church so
[1:26:33] sooner or later you got to look away
[1:26:35] from your problems and look to the
[1:26:38] Unseen oh Hallelujah sooner or later you
[1:26:41] got to look away from the bitterness you
[1:26:43] got to look away from from the a that
[1:26:45] the devil puts between you and your
[1:26:47] neighbor you got to look away from that
[1:26:49] and look to the Unseen and I left
[1:26:51] brother the Brandon would would would
[1:26:52] would would put it lift up up their
[1:26:54] heads and look up for the Unseen Christ
[1:26:57] will be appearing and brother Brandon
[1:26:59] would tell us that there's a difference
[1:27:01] between the appearing of Christ and the
[1:27:03] coming of Christ you remember him talk
[1:27:05] telling us that and brother Brandon was
[1:27:07] say God has a provided way in that
[1:27:09] message now remember these two words
[1:27:11] before I leave you the appearing of
[1:27:14] Christ and the coming of Christ is two
[1:27:16] different things Christ is now appearing
[1:27:19] in the fullness of his power so brother
[1:27:22] Brandon would would would would say look
[1:27:24] up and Christ would command the church
[1:27:27] look up for the Unseen Christ will be
[1:27:30] appearing pretty soon and what does that
[1:27:32] mean brother Josh Christ is appearing in
[1:27:35] the fullness of his power and so we need
[1:27:38] to look away from the problems and look
[1:27:40] to the fullness that God has given in
[1:27:43] this generation oh you got to look away
[1:27:46] you see if you're constantly looking at
[1:27:48] the negative side of something hope this
[1:27:50] is okay if you're looking up the
[1:27:52] negative side of something that's the
[1:27:54] perspective you're going to get right
[1:27:56] you know tonight was my first time
[1:27:58] meeting brother Bor and I know brother
[1:28:00] Austin really well so if he would have
[1:28:02] told me he had two wives you know he had
[1:28:04] had a crazy past has a kid with this
[1:28:07] woman a kid with that woman even though
[1:28:09] his character would speak for itself I
[1:28:11] would still have that question in the
[1:28:13] back of my mind right you know even
[1:28:15] though he says man those are crazy
[1:28:17] accusations none of that is true there's
[1:28:19] still going to be a question mark if I'm
[1:28:22] trying to listen to what he say
[1:28:24] right so if we're constantly looking up
[1:28:26] the negative s negative side of
[1:28:28] something we can hear the truth but
[1:28:31] there's always going to be the question
[1:28:32] in the back of our mind so if we're
[1:28:34] listening to what the naysayers are
[1:28:36] saying and whenever the preacher says
[1:28:38] the God can still heal but this one says
[1:28:41] the days of Miracles are passed the
[1:28:43] question mark is going to Blind you from
[1:28:46] the realities of it but brother brandom
[1:28:48] says he God commanded the church lift up
[1:28:51] their head look away from what going on
[1:28:55] in the world systems and look to the
[1:28:57] Unseen Christ for he is appearing pretty
[1:29:01] soon and I think he's not appearing
[1:29:03] pretty soon but he has appeared he is
[1:29:05] here now in the fullness of his power
[1:29:09] and we would see that brother Brandon
[1:29:11] would tell us that people look at the
[1:29:13] word literally and fail to see it
[1:29:15] spiritually he says you can look at it
[1:29:17] literally but he he would tell us that
[1:29:19] the the word of God cannot be learned
[1:29:22] like a newspaper right he said say you
[1:29:24] can't read it like a newspaper he says
[1:29:26] you got to get down look up and say God
[1:29:29] Give Me Faith to believe your word and
[1:29:32] so he would show us the very way we had
[1:29:35] to look at the word and it's so
[1:29:37] incredible cuz we needed somebody to
[1:29:40] show us how to look you know you you you
[1:29:42] remember Phillip and the and the
[1:29:44] Ethiopian the Bible would say that when
[1:29:46] philli came to the Ethiopian the
[1:29:49] Ethiopian was reading Isaiah 53 and he
[1:29:52] had many questions and what's so
[1:29:54] powerful is the Bible says Philip came
[1:29:57] to him and says do you understand what
[1:29:59] you read and what would he say how can I
[1:30:02] unless a man guides me unless a man
[1:30:04] chose me so he was sitting there in a
[1:30:07] confused State and the Very purpose of
[1:30:10] Philip being there was to show him how
[1:30:12] to look at it oh you remember cuz he was
[1:30:15] way away and God would bring him there
[1:30:17] right so the very purpose of him being
[1:30:20] there was to show that man how to look
[1:30:22] he was already looking out the scripture
[1:30:25] and he would ask he would ask philli
[1:30:27] what's who is he talking about is he
[1:30:29] talking about himself is he talking
[1:30:31] about about a prophet who's he talking
[1:30:34] about and what would the Bible says and
[1:30:36] and I love how the Bible would put it
[1:30:37] the Bible says Philip opened his mouth
[1:30:40] and preached Jesus Oh ain't that
[1:30:42] powerful he opened his mouth the Bible
[1:30:45] says that he opened his mouth and taught
[1:30:47] Jesus and I thought my goodness we had a
[1:30:50] messenger in this generation in human
[1:30:52] flesh but when he opened his mouth and
[1:30:55] brought a message he was preaching to
[1:30:57] you Jesus showing you how to look quit
[1:31:01] looking at it through a denominational
[1:31:03] mindset and look at it in the purity of
[1:31:06] the word of this generation and what
[1:31:08] would the Bible say uh but the Bible
[1:31:11] would say that they would go by a pool
[1:31:13] of water and that Ethiopian would stop
[1:31:16] and would say here's water what
[1:31:18] hindrance me to be baptized and what
[1:31:21] that is so incredible to me because he
[1:31:23] was stumped he was confused but once
[1:31:26] that messenger came by his way it put
[1:31:29] him into action and brother brandom says
[1:31:31] once you see the Living Word it put you
[1:31:33] into action so it wasn't it wasn't
[1:31:36] Philip saying hey here's some dos and
[1:31:38] don'ts don't do that don't do this you
[1:31:40] got to be baptized this certain way as
[1:31:42] soon as he would see Jesus of the
[1:31:45] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[1:31:48] the new it put him into action oh
[1:31:52] Hallelujah and that takes the pressure
[1:31:54] off of the preacher we're not trying to
[1:31:56] make you a good Christian we're showing
[1:31:58] you Jesus and that put you into action
[1:32:02] Hallelujah that's putting you into
[1:32:04] action you know my my my dad has a
[1:32:06] saying that the the pastor ain't like a
[1:32:08] cowboy he ain't going around with the
[1:32:10] lasso you know trying to catch this one
[1:32:13] and trying to make you do good he says
[1:32:14] preachers and cowboys they're Shepherds
[1:32:17] they they're feeding you they're showing
[1:32:19] you these things and you're just
[1:32:21] following the shepherd oh Hallelujah
[1:32:25] oh my so we would have a message that
[1:32:27] would show us how to look not like a
[1:32:29] newspaper not and brother Brandon would
[1:32:30] tell us that it's going to take more
[1:32:32] than a student comparing verse with
[1:32:34] verse right he says it's a prophetic
[1:32:37] Insight it's a special class of people
[1:32:39] and it's going to take the leading of
[1:32:40] the spirit right and and I'm so glad we
[1:32:43] would have a prophet that would show us
[1:32:45] these things that it's more than just
[1:32:47] looking at it but what are you seeing
[1:32:49] and brother Brandon would would preach a
[1:32:51] message looking looking under Jesus and
[1:32:53] would say what do you see when you look
[1:32:56] he would tell us that you look with your
[1:32:58] eyes but you see with your heart oh my
[1:33:01] and he would say we have two men there's
[1:33:02] an outward man and an inward man he says
[1:33:05] the outward man is walking by sight
[1:33:07] walking by your flesh he says the inward
[1:33:09] man is walking by faith but not by not
[1:33:12] not walking by what you see but walking
[1:33:14] by what you believe and brother BR I'm
[1:33:16] going tell us that we live not by what
[1:33:18] we see but by what we believe you know
[1:33:21] and you remember Nicodemus would come to
[1:33:23] Jesus and Jesus would tell him you know
[1:33:26] unless you're born again you cannot see
[1:33:28] the kingdom of God but the Brandon would
[1:33:30] say that that word see means to
[1:33:32] understand so seeing for the believer
[1:33:35] might not be seeing with your eye but
[1:33:37] it's seeing with the heart it's
[1:33:39] understanding when you can't see a way
[1:33:41] out of a situation you understand that
[1:33:44] God has everything under control you
[1:33:47] know brother the Brandon would say the
[1:33:48] perfect Faith Masters all circumstances
[1:33:51] and he would say that that that what
[1:33:52] that means is whenever you can't see a
[1:33:55] way out of it you know God has
[1:33:57] everything under control and then he
[1:33:59] would say then we're coming to bride
[1:34:02] material ain't that powerful that the
[1:34:04] bride ain't walking by what they see
[1:34:06] they're walking by what they believe
[1:34:08] that's what separate you from the rest
[1:34:10] of the church world is they can't see
[1:34:13] the supernatural so they don't believe
[1:34:15] it so even when you don't see God in
[1:34:18] this church you believe that he's
[1:34:20] here oh come on now cuz sometimes we go
[1:34:24] through dry spells I've been there when
[1:34:25] you come to church man you don't feel
[1:34:27] nothing how many's ever been there when
[1:34:30] you go through dry spells you come to
[1:34:31] church you don't feel like singing you
[1:34:33] don't feel like lifting up your hands
[1:34:35] and if you're walking by by your
[1:34:36] emotions man you're backslid right if
[1:34:39] you're walking by your emotions man God
[1:34:41] ain't here but if you're walking by
[1:34:43] faith you know if the emotions ain't
[1:34:45] here as long as the word is being
[1:34:48] preached that's what that that that's
[1:34:50] what God accompanies is the word and
[1:34:53] brother Brandon would tell us that that
[1:34:55] he would say if you're walking by what
[1:34:57] you see he says your emotions are is
[1:35:00] what you is your control your emotions
[1:35:02] are your control and that really really
[1:35:04] spoke to me because if your emotions are
[1:35:07] your control sometimes you go to bed you
[1:35:09] feel great you wake up the next morning
[1:35:12] you don't feel so great how many's ever
[1:35:13] been there you go to bed man you feel
[1:35:15] like you're a good Christian you can
[1:35:17] overcome everything but you wake up on
[1:35:20] the wrong side of the bed you get out of
[1:35:22] bed you got a back aach you got a
[1:35:24] headache and then all of a sudden you
[1:35:26] don't feel like a mighty conqueror so if
[1:35:28] you're walking by your emotions where's
[1:35:30] your where's your stability at you know
[1:35:33] where's your stabilizer at but if you're
[1:35:35] walking by Revelation when your emotions
[1:35:38] are down you're still stabilized you see
[1:35:41] cuz brother Brandon would talk about
[1:35:42] Peter and would say Peter would walk
[1:35:45] upon substance and I thought that was so
[1:35:47] powerful there they're in perfect Faith
[1:35:49] he would say his substance would have
[1:35:51] led him straight to the feet of Jesus
[1:35:53] you know what whenever Jesus was walking
[1:35:54] upon the Water Peter would say if it is
[1:35:56] you bid me to come right Jesus would say
[1:35:59] come on and so brother brandom says he
[1:36:01] was walking upon substance and what I
[1:36:04] think is so powerful about that was
[1:36:06] Peter was not walking by his own will he
[1:36:09] was walking by the will of the father
[1:36:11] and I thought that is that that is so
[1:36:13] incredible that Peter would ask that if
[1:36:15] it is you bid me to come and I and that
[1:36:19] as I was studying go thing I could
[1:36:21] relate to him because if you was walking
[1:36:23] by your own will you wouldn't have
[1:36:25] confidence in yourself right if you was
[1:36:28] just wearing your skirts because you
[1:36:29] wanted to you know what if you're motion
[1:36:32] somebody come and says man you should
[1:36:33] wear pants you look like an old woman
[1:36:35] you're this and you're that if you're
[1:36:37] walking by you doing it you could be
[1:36:39] discouraged right but if you know it's
[1:36:41] the Commandment of God and there's a
[1:36:43] blessing in it that gives a courage that
[1:36:46] it's not me doing this because I want to
[1:36:49] it's because God has commissioned me to
[1:36:52] right so Peter would say if if it is you
[1:36:54] bid me to come so he was walking by the
[1:36:57] Commandment of God oh Hallelujah and
[1:37:00] brother Brandon would say he was walking
[1:37:02] on substance but you know what would
[1:37:04] happen brother brandom says what he
[1:37:06] believed happened but what he feared
[1:37:09] also happened he says he looked at the
[1:37:11] waves and became afraid and he says his
[1:37:15] fear took away his
[1:37:16] substance oh my so here he is walking
[1:37:20] upon the word of God the Commandments of
[1:37:23] God but he allowed the emotion of fear
[1:37:25] to lead him and that fear would take
[1:37:28] away his substance and many times that's
[1:37:30] what happens to us we're standing in the
[1:37:33] will of God we're believing for the
[1:37:34] miracles of god but then fear starts to
[1:37:37] creep up and if we let that lead us
[1:37:39] that's going to take away the very
[1:37:41] strength of our faith because the Bible
[1:37:43] would say faith is the substance of
[1:37:45] things hope for the evidence of Things
[1:37:47] Not Seen but the Brandon would say that
[1:37:50] Peter Still professed his faith but had
[1:37:53] no substance ain't that powerful that he
[1:37:55] still claimed to have it but did not
[1:37:58] have the evidence of it and that's where
[1:38:00] the devil once us many times is
[1:38:02] professing something without the
[1:38:04] evidence of it oh come on now and what
[1:38:07] happens when you lose the evidence of
[1:38:09] your faith you lose your strength right
[1:38:12] if you know I've given this example many
[1:38:14] places but you know say say me the Tom
[1:38:16] he got to got into an argument and it
[1:38:18] gets into a heated argument I think I'm
[1:38:21] right he thinks he's right and it gets
[1:38:23] physical and I don't think I can take
[1:38:24] him I'm going to back down right I don't
[1:38:27] want to get beat up by him so I'm going
[1:38:28] to back down and cow down to him and say
[1:38:31] that he is right because I don't have
[1:38:34] the strength to to face him and if the
[1:38:36] devil takes away your substance he takes
[1:38:39] away your strength so whenever spirits
[1:38:42] come against your home come against your
[1:38:44] family come against your mind if you
[1:38:46] don't got no substance no strength
[1:38:49] you're going to cow down to those
[1:38:51] Spirits right so if you if you can can
[1:38:53] cast out fear and walk by faith not by
[1:38:56] your emotion then use the strength
[1:38:59] whenever the spirits of the enemy comes
[1:39:01] against your mind you've got a strength
[1:39:03] to combat it with you remember the
[1:39:06] Brandon would talk about the preacher
[1:39:07] that would have the dream you remember
[1:39:09] and the devil would say boo and he would
[1:39:11] he would back down the devil got bigger
[1:39:14] he got smaller right the devil would say
[1:39:16] boo he back down got smaller he got
[1:39:19] bigger but what he had to do and I
[1:39:21] believe the story goes that he would
[1:39:23] grab a Bible and would say boo and he
[1:39:26] got bigger the devil got smaller so
[1:39:29] there's got to come a time that we get
[1:39:31] sick and tired of being plagued by fear
[1:39:34] sick and tired of the devil taking away
[1:39:36] your substance taking away your joy
[1:39:39] taking away your peace taking away our
[1:39:42] stability and say Boo devil you're not
[1:39:45] taking my joy you're not taking my peace
[1:39:47] but I'm I'm going to the enemy's camp
[1:39:50] and I'm taking everything that you stole
[1:39:52] from me
[1:39:54] there's a strength there's a strength
[1:39:56] when you're walking by
[1:39:57] faith oh Hallelujah there's a strength
[1:40:00] whenever you're stabilized because you
[1:40:02] remember brother brownon would would and
[1:40:04] and I won't hold you long tonight
[1:40:06] brother brownon would talk about Jonah
[1:40:08] and would say Jonah would would would
[1:40:10] win a city the size of St Louis and
[1:40:12] that's incredible to think about he he
[1:40:14] would say Nineveh was the size of St
[1:40:16] Louis and here Jonah would win the city
[1:40:19] to the Lord but what would happen after
[1:40:22] he wins the city to the Lord or to
[1:40:24] Jehovah he would go to a mountain and
[1:40:26] would say God take my life ain't that
[1:40:29] incredible that hear the Lord just
[1:40:31] anointed him performed the great miracle
[1:40:34] with shaking the the the kingdom of hell
[1:40:37] but now after the anointing wears off of
[1:40:39] him he's not
[1:40:41] stabilized you know why because the Holy
[1:40:44] Ghost wasn't there yet right the
[1:40:46] anointer could come upon him but it
[1:40:48] could not go to the
[1:40:50] soul you remember the Tabernacle I hope
[1:40:53] is okay tonight you remember the
[1:40:54] Tabernacle there was three courts right
[1:40:57] the the outer Court the inner court and
[1:40:59] the most holy place and if you go into
[1:41:01] the first Court where the brandom says
[1:41:03] the the the light in the first court was
[1:41:05] from the Sun and from the Moon right so
[1:41:08] if it was cloudy on the outside it was
[1:41:10] cloudy in that first court but if you
[1:41:12] would go into that second Court there
[1:41:14] there was a there was a roof over it and
[1:41:16] so that the sun did not dictate the
[1:41:18] dictate the light of it but the candles
[1:41:21] sticks with the light right and so who
[1:41:23] would light the candlesticks the priest
[1:41:25] right but if you go into the third Court
[1:41:28] there wasn't no priest with the
[1:41:29] Candlestick in there the light was the
[1:41:31] Shak of glory and so whenever it was
[1:41:34] cloudy on the outside it was still sunny
[1:41:36] on the inside if the priest was late and
[1:41:39] fell to light the candles it was still
[1:41:42] light on the inside and so here Jonah
[1:41:45] the anointing would come upon his flesh
[1:41:47] but it didn't go to the soul right but
[1:41:49] the Brandon would tell us we're a Triune
[1:41:51] being right we're body we're Soul we
[1:41:53] Spirit he would say there's five senses
[1:41:56] to the to the body and he would say it's
[1:41:58] taste it's smell it's hear it's feel and
[1:42:01] and it's seeing and then he would say
[1:42:03] you've got a spirit man and he says
[1:42:05] there's five senses right hope this is
[1:42:07] okay and he says that you got five
[1:42:08] senses to the spirit man imagination
[1:42:11] affection reasoning uh uh conscience and
[1:42:14] memory and he says then you've got us
[1:42:16] hold and he says there's two senses it's
[1:42:19] faith and it's doubt which is controlled
[1:42:21] by by self-will right and so the so the
[1:42:24] spirit of God would anoint Jonah's flesh
[1:42:26] he would fill God but what happened when
[1:42:29] the filling left him his soul wasn't
[1:42:31] stabilized so now he's upon the mountain
[1:42:34] saying God take my life you see that's
[1:42:37] why you can't walk by your emotions you
[1:42:39] got to walk by what your soul believes
[1:42:42] the message can't just come on your
[1:42:43] flesh or upon your spirit man it's got
[1:42:46] to go to the soul but the Brandon would
[1:42:48] say you can have the Holy Ghost every
[1:42:50] day of your life and go straight to hell
[1:42:52] right you can have the Holy Ghost upon
[1:42:54] your flesh and you can feel good you can
[1:42:57] dance you can have the Holy Ghost upon
[1:42:59] your spirit man you can speak in tongues
[1:43:02] but it's got to go to the soul it's not
[1:43:04] going to do no good till it go to the
[1:43:06] soul and this message can't just stay
[1:43:09] upon your flesh it can't just stay in
[1:43:12] your spirit man it's got to go to the
[1:43:14] soul and that's what stabilizes the
[1:43:17] believer is when it goes down to the
[1:43:19] soul and you know if I go through the
[1:43:22] valley of the shadow of death I fear no
[1:43:25] evil for thou art with me thou art with
[1:43:29] me what is it the Unseen has stabilized
[1:43:32] the
[1:43:34] soul Hallelujah that's what we're
[1:43:36] Believing by you don't believe by your
[1:43:38] mind you believe from the soul brother
[1:43:41] brandom says the mind H S but he says
[1:43:44] that the soul believes he he says hope
[1:43:46] is looking for something but he says
[1:43:48] faith claims it now and so the mind is
[1:43:51] hoping to see God but the fa The Faith
[1:43:54] from the soul is seeing God by a
[1:43:57] revelation you see this a message in a
[1:43:59] hope so it's a no so it's a revelation
[1:44:03] that the Unseen has guided me every step
[1:44:05] of the way you see not by emotions but
[1:44:08] by a faith oh I'm an emotional guy man I
[1:44:12] I love having a good time but you see
[1:44:15] what happens when the emotions wear off
[1:44:17] right we still got to be stabilized and
[1:44:19] you remember Elijah where the brand
[1:44:21] would talk about Elijah and here Elijah
[1:44:23] right after the mount carel Showdown
[1:44:25] what would happen he would go to a cave
[1:44:28] right and would say God take my life and
[1:44:30] what is so incredible is what would
[1:44:32] Elijah say to God he would say they have
[1:44:35] tore down your altars right they've
[1:44:37] killed all of your prophets and now I'm
[1:44:40] the only one that is left you remember
[1:44:42] Elijah saying that and what would God
[1:44:44] say I still got 7,000 that has not bow
[1:44:48] their knee to bail and that was really
[1:44:50] incredible to me because Elijah's em
[1:44:53] emotions was saying something contrary
[1:44:55] than what God was saying oh Hallelujah
[1:44:59] and if you're going by what you feel
[1:45:01] your emotions can lead you contrary to
[1:45:04] the way God looks at a situation oh
[1:45:07] Elijah was looking at a situation and
[1:45:10] says it's hopeless but God was looking
[1:45:12] at a situation and says you're not the
[1:45:14] only one left I still got 7,000 you see
[1:45:18] so whenever you feel like you're by
[1:45:20] yourself look to what God says about it
[1:45:23] whenever you feel like a situation is
[1:45:25] impossible what does God say about it
[1:45:28] well you remember Gideon the Bible says
[1:45:31] the angel would come to Gideon and would
[1:45:33] say you're a mighty man of Valor yall
[1:45:35] remember that and what would Gideon say
[1:45:37] he says I'm the least in my father's
[1:45:39] house and my family is poor and I looked
[1:45:42] up the word Valor one definition of the
[1:45:45] word Valor means wealthy here come an
[1:45:47] angel says you're a mighty man of wealth
[1:45:50] Gideon looks at him and says I am poor
[1:45:52] he had a change the way that the that
[1:45:55] change the way he was looking at his
[1:45:57] situation you've got to change the way
[1:45:59] you look at the situation and look at
[1:46:02] yourself the way God looks at you you
[1:46:04] see God don't look at you as a beggar
[1:46:07] God looks at you as his bride come on
[1:46:09] God don't look at you some Cast Away
[1:46:12] some wan to be you know some some may be
[1:46:14] so but God looks at you as it's redeemed
[1:46:17] I shed my blood for you not so that you
[1:46:19] can be a makeb believer but you can be
[1:46:21] an unbeliever you got to look at
[1:46:24] yourself the way God looks at you oh my
[1:46:28] but it's fear fear likes to take away
[1:46:31] the the Assurance of what God has given
[1:46:34] us in this generation you know if you're
[1:46:36] afraid to take God's word at something
[1:46:38] you're never going to act upon him you
[1:46:40] remember brother Brandon would tell the
[1:46:42] story about the preacher that that would
[1:46:44] that would take his congregation out
[1:46:46] front and get a log and would say do you
[1:46:48] think I could walk across this log and
[1:46:49] back they would say oh yes the Lord is
[1:46:51] with you he walk across come back he
[1:46:54] would get a whe barrel and would say do
[1:46:55] you think I can push this across come
[1:46:57] back oh yes the Lord is with you and
[1:46:59] then he would do it and say do you think
[1:47:01] I can push a person in this and they
[1:47:03] says oh yes the Lord is with you he said
[1:47:06] okay get in they said no and but the
[1:47:08] brand must say it's different when
[1:47:10] you're involved in it yourself you see
[1:47:13] fear makes it impersonal that the
[1:47:15] message is right but it's not for you
[1:47:18] that God can heal but he can't heal you
[1:47:20] that there's going to be a Rapture but
[1:47:21] it's not for you
[1:47:23] somebody's got to Cast Away the emotion
[1:47:26] of fear and see I don't care what you
[1:47:28] say my soul believes it my soul believes
[1:47:33] it it don't matter what my emotion says
[1:47:36] what my affection says what my reasoning
[1:47:38] says you know brother brandom says
[1:47:40] there's no reasoning in faith no
[1:47:42] reasoning in faith and what's so
[1:47:44] powerful is brother brandom says faith
[1:47:46] rescues you from your five senses so
[1:47:49] whenever your five senses don't see God
[1:47:52] don't feel God don't hear God can't
[1:47:54] imagine God you know then Faith rescues
[1:47:57] you and says God is here
[1:48:00] anyways oh Hallelujah God is here
[1:48:04] anyways oh my I'll bring this down to a
[1:48:07] close and brother Brandon would talk
[1:48:09] about Elisha and his servant Gesa and
[1:48:12] it's powerful because brother Brandon
[1:48:14] would say that that Elisha was looking
[1:48:16] at the Unseen all the time I I'll just
[1:48:19] read it to you and looking at the Unseen
[1:48:21] he says because Elijah was was used to
[1:48:23] walking by faith he was looking at the
[1:48:25] Unseen all the time he knew that God
[1:48:28] said in the Psalms the angels of God or
[1:48:31] aamp about those who fear Him get this
[1:48:34] that was enough for Elijah and if you
[1:48:37] look at the story of Elijah he's
[1:48:40] confident here come Gaza saying we're
[1:48:43] surround him Elijah Elisha would say
[1:48:46] there's more with us than with him how
[1:48:49] did he know that by the word you know
[1:48:51] you almost think that he's seeing the
[1:48:54] Angels but brother the Brandon was
[1:48:55] putting again he didn't see the Angels
[1:48:58] he knew they were there because he was
[1:49:00] looking at the Unseen all the time by a
[1:49:03] promise you see that's how we look at
[1:49:06] the Unseen you may never see God
[1:49:08] naturally and we love to feel him right
[1:49:11] we love to see his Spirit come and work
[1:49:13] among us but when you don't feel him you
[1:49:15] still got to be looking at the Unseen
[1:49:18] you know we've been we've been believing
[1:49:19] with y'all for our sister our church has
[1:49:21] been praying for you you say we love it
[1:49:23] when we're in church and we feel God you
[1:49:25] know our faith is up high but what about
[1:49:27] at the Midnight Hour right what about it
[1:49:30] when it's 2: in the morning and the
[1:49:31] devil's bombarding our minds what are we
[1:49:33] going to believe then you see we still
[1:49:36] got to look at the Unseen by a promise
[1:49:39] and what is so incredible is here stood
[1:49:42] a prophet he was already looking at the
[1:49:45] Unseen but he wasn't just happy with
[1:49:48] himself looking at it he wanted the
[1:49:50] young boy to look at it as well and he
[1:49:52] would say Lord open this boy's eyes and
[1:49:55] his eyes would come open and would see
[1:49:57] that there was Chariots of Fire
[1:49:59] surrounding the mountaintops and sister
[1:50:02] believe it there are Chariots of Fire
[1:50:04] every step of the way you ain't walking
[1:50:06] by yourself you're not fighting by
[1:50:08] yourself but there's an unseen realm
[1:50:11] that is surrounding you every step of
[1:50:13] the way when you don't feel like you can
[1:50:15] take another step there's an unseen real
[1:50:18] that is with you that is pressing for
[1:50:20] you Hallelujah and every one of you that
[1:50:23] is here tonight you might feel
[1:50:25] discouraged you might feel low but just
[1:50:28] know there are angels of fire that are
[1:50:30] surrounding the building tonight he to
[1:50:32] encourage here to strengthen you and to
[1:50:35] lift you up and say you can go
[1:50:39] on oh Hallelujah and what's incredible
[1:50:42] Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord
[1:50:45] encampeth around them that fear Him and
[1:50:52] they were there they were there to
[1:50:54] deliver oh he knew they weren't just
[1:50:57] there to watch him they were there to
[1:50:59] fight and the angels of God ain't just
[1:51:02] here to watch you suffer they're here to
[1:51:04] fight for you they're here to press for
[1:51:06] you they're here to say hey you got this
[1:51:10] be strengthened be
[1:51:12] encouraged oh my you remember whenever
[1:51:16] Elijah was beaten down and he was
[1:51:18] discouraged but the Brandon would
[1:51:20] dramatize it and would say hey I need
[1:51:22] the angel with the softest hands you
[1:51:24] remember that he would say my my servant
[1:51:26] down there he's tired he's discouraged I
[1:51:29] need you to go down there and stroke his
[1:51:31] brow massage his shoulders and you know
[1:51:34] the Bible says that when that angel came
[1:51:36] down he gave him meat to strengthen him
[1:51:40] and so this Angel would come down with
[1:51:42] the purpose to encourage him and to
[1:51:44] strengthen him oh the angels of God that
[1:51:48] are Camp about you are not just here
[1:51:50] watching but they're here to fight
[1:51:52] they're here to strengthen you they're
[1:51:54] here to encourage you you know remember
[1:51:56] whenever Daniel Prayed for 21 days right
[1:51:59] the Bible says that the angel came on
[1:52:01] the 21st day and says your prayer was
[1:52:03] answered the first day but I had a fight
[1:52:06] through the Prince of Persia and what
[1:52:08] what the Bible say Daniel says he was
[1:52:10] strengthened by his words so even when
[1:52:14] he was beat down and low for agonizing
[1:52:17] and travailing but when his answer broke
[1:52:19] through it strengthened him you see
[1:52:22] don't give up you might be travailing
[1:52:24] you might be pressing don't give up on
[1:52:26] your answer for when the answer comes
[1:52:29] it's going to strengthen you oh
[1:52:31] Hallelujah don't give up on your
[1:52:34] answered prayer it'll strengthen you
[1:52:36] it'll comfort you it'll uplift
[1:52:39] you oh Hallelujah that's what the voice
[1:52:43] of God does it strengthens you remember
[1:52:45] whenever Jesus went to jerius jus' house
[1:52:48] the Bible says he took out all the
[1:52:50] unbelief right everybody was laughing
[1:52:52] laughing at him scoffing him the Bible
[1:52:54] says he put them all out of the house
[1:52:56] right then he would go and say Maiden
[1:52:58] arise and what what he why would he say
[1:53:01] after that he would say give her meat to
[1:53:04] eat so wherever the voice of God is it's
[1:53:07] there to
[1:53:08] strengthen oh Hallelujah give her meat
[1:53:12] to eat oh my little musicians come
[1:53:14] tonight wherever the voice of God speaks
[1:53:17] it's not just it's just just not words
[1:53:20] it's a strengthening it's the coming
[1:53:22] strengthen and uplift you and I believe
[1:53:25] God works through a five-fold Ministry
[1:53:27] cuz what would Jesus would look to the
[1:53:29] parents and would said give her meat to
[1:53:31] eat it wasn't him going and finding meat
[1:53:34] but now they were working under a
[1:53:36] commission he's the one that brought her
[1:53:38] back to life and and we would know that
[1:53:40] brother that Jesus would say that she's
[1:53:42] not dead she's asleep she's sleeping
[1:53:45] right and brother Brandon would tell us
[1:53:47] that the bride there's an Awakening of
[1:53:49] the Bride right he would say that that
[1:53:51] everybody's looking for Revival where's
[1:53:53] the Revival where's the Revival and
[1:53:55] brother brandom says they missed the
[1:53:56] Awakening of the Bride right and so
[1:53:59] whenever this girl was awaken out of her
[1:54:01] sleep he would commission a parent and
[1:54:04] would say strengthen her oh my it was
[1:54:07] the voice of God that would ring you out
[1:54:10] of your Slumber out of the
[1:54:11] denominational Slumber now it's a
[1:54:13] five-fold Ministry that is strengthening
[1:54:15] you you remember Lazarus the Bible says
[1:54:18] that Jesus would come to the tomb of
[1:54:20] Lazarus and would say I love the Bible
[1:54:22] puts it he cried with a loud voice
[1:54:25] Lazarus come forth and whenever Lazarus
[1:54:28] came out he was still bound hands and
[1:54:30] foot and what I love about it is the
[1:54:32] Bible specifies the mouth he was bound
[1:54:35] hands and foot and there was a napkin
[1:54:37] about his mouth then Jesus would look
[1:54:40] and would say loose him and let him go
[1:54:43] so the same voice the bride that brought
[1:54:46] him to life and he was asleep right he
[1:54:48] would say he's not dead he's asleep just
[1:54:50] like the Awakening of the Bride we
[1:54:52] wasn't dead he was asleep and then he
[1:54:54] would commission somebody else to loose
[1:54:57] him you see that's the power of the
[1:54:59] fivefold ministry it was the voice of
[1:55:01] God that brought the brought the bride
[1:55:03] back to life out of her Slumber but now
[1:55:06] it's a fivefold ministry under a
[1:55:07] commission from that same voice every
[1:55:10] time a message is being preached it's
[1:55:13] loosening him from a doubt that's
[1:55:15] loosening him from your unbelief that
[1:55:17] you can walk in the freedom he was bound
[1:55:20] hand and foot how could he
[1:55:23] Rejoice rejoice in his freedom if he was
[1:55:25] still bound right but he had to be
[1:55:28] loosed I I say we can be loosed from
[1:55:30] every complex from every doubt from
[1:55:32] every unbelief that we can worship God
[1:55:35] not out of emotion but out of Liberty
[1:55:38] you see there's a difference in
[1:55:40] emotional worship and a liberty worship
[1:55:42] the denominations can worship out of
[1:55:44] emotion we're worshiping out of Liberty
[1:55:47] that we once was bound but now we're
[1:55:49] free I was blind but now I see I was
[1:55:52] going to hell but now I'm set free it's
[1:55:55] a liberty that the voice of God has
[1:55:58] brought us and we're stabilized in it
[1:56:00] let's stand to our feet
[1:56:02] tonight and let's bow our heads dear
[1:56:05] gracious Heavenly
[1:56:06] Father Lord how we love you tonight Lord
[1:56:10] God thank you for giving us a message in
[1:56:12] this generation that can stabilize us

[1:56:17] Lord you showed us how to look at your
[1:56:19] word Lord Lord You've guided us Lord and
[1:56:23] Lord maybe never take that for granted
[1:56:26] Lord if there's somebody here that that
[1:56:28] might be discouraged Lord maybe they're
[1:56:31] they're they're low in their faith
[1:56:32] father Lord we ask that you would
[1:56:34] strengthen them Father Lord May the same
[1:56:37] angel that would come to Elijah and
[1:56:40] strengthen him Lord Lord you would tell
[1:56:42] us after Jesus we would would be tempted
[1:56:45] for 40 days an angel would come and
[1:56:47] minister to him Lord May the same Angels
[1:56:50] come and minister to the week tonight
[1:56:52] father may you strengthen them Lord God
[1:56:55] as we leave this place may we not leave
[1:56:58] your presence father Lord even when we
[1:57:00] don't feel you may we know you're still
