[26:35] what a beautiful day to serve the Lord
[26:38] amen let's stand if we could and
[26:45] that's brother Joe if he would open Us
[26:47] in us in a moment of Prayer
[27:11] foreign
[27:27] can be dismissed for Sunday School
[27:29] turn in your bibles if you would to
[27:31] Psalms 51 while you're turning I just
[27:35] want to share something that was on my
[27:36] heart and uh you know I didn't know I
[27:38] was going to be doing the Sunday School
[27:39] reading two weeks that the that the
[27:41] state of Kentucky is the Lord's favorite
[27:43] state
[27:45] and uh and you say well how could you
[27:47] say such well we have the prophet was
[27:49] born in the state of Kentucky uh we've
[27:52] had Abraham Lincoln's from the state of
[27:54] Kentucky
[27:55] um great revivals have happened in the
[27:58] state of Kentucky Peter Cartwright
[27:59] Revival is took place out of Logan
[28:02] County right next door some of the
[28:04] greatest revivals that ever swept the
[28:05] nation and now I don't know if you've
[28:08] kept up with it or you've known what's
[28:10] going on but
[28:12] and I'm getting emotional just because
[28:13] I'm thinking about the moving of the
[28:15] Lord
[28:16] the Asbury University in the state of
[28:19] Kentucky
[28:20] they're currently in a Revival
[28:23] and you say Revival what what are we
[28:25] doing according to the to the stories
[28:28] Wednesday they had their morning Chapel
[28:31] as any other day every student showed up
[28:33] 1500 students showed up for Chapel
[28:36] at Asbury University Asbury University
[28:38] for those
[28:39] don't know it's a non-nominational
[28:41] Christian
[28:43] University in the state of Kentucky that
[28:45] that's founded on Westland holiness
[28:49] uh principles and many many great
[28:52] ministers and preachers have come out of
[28:53] that University and
[28:56] but the morning there they the the
[28:58] message to the to the to the students at
[29:00] the University was a message of
[29:03] repentance
[29:04] and God's love and how you can repent
[29:06] and God's love will cover a multitude of
[29:09] sin
[29:10] and
[29:11] you know I find it ironic that this
[29:13] happens right after the news is saying
[29:15] that we're going to be in a war with
[29:16] with China by 25.
[29:21] there will be no war with China in 25
[29:23] it'll be the end of the world when that
[29:25] happens we there's not going to be a war
[29:27] between the United States and China
[29:29] that's going to be fought on the back
[29:31] Battlefield it'll be somebody pushing
[29:33] buttons
[29:34] and now we see Asbury university has
[29:37] this revival
[29:38] this has been going on since Wednesday
[29:40] morning
[29:42] and it's continuing
[29:44] 24 7 peoples come from Louisville
[29:46] they've come from Lexington they've come
[29:48] from universities they've come from
[29:50] Virginia
[29:52] and it wasn't planned it was just they
[29:55] just stayed
[29:57] they just stayed and so they've been
[30:00] praising the Lord they've been singing
[30:02] they've been having testimony somebody
[30:03] will come and share the words somebody
[30:05] will come and and spend a a short uh
[30:08] minute uh preaching
[30:11] and it's I'll just find it amazing
[30:13] that the Lord is willing to still move
[30:15] and you say well we're not we're not at
[30:18] Asbury no you're not at Asbury but
[30:20] you're still
[30:21] you got an opportunity to have Revival
[30:23] right here this morning
[30:25] and this scripture come to my mind when
[30:27] I looked at it in Psalms 51 because here
[30:30] you're talking about a Revival here's
[30:32] David when Nathan the prophet comes to
[30:35] him after he had gone in with Bathsheba
[30:38] and here he here it is that the word of
[30:40] God is telling us what what what's
[30:42] happening so I just would like to see a
[30:43] Revival in my life
[30:46] and 24 7.
[30:48] continual
[30:50] I don't know how long it'll go at Asbury
[30:52] it would be neat to just be able to be
[30:54] there be in that presence I've seen the
[30:56] videos you can follow it live you can
[30:58] watch it's really amazing I do know I
[31:01] don't know how long it'll last there but
[31:02] I do know the teachers have already
[31:03] canceled class for next week so uh
[31:06] they're expecting this this to just keep
[31:08] going and going going so let's read this
[31:10] scripture and think about Revival in our
[31:11] own life
[31:12] psalm 51.
[31:15] have mercy upon me o God according to
[31:17] thy loving kindness according unto the
[31:20] multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out
[31:23] my transgressions
[31:30] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[31:33] my sin is ever before me
[31:46] behold I was shaping in iniquity and in
[31:49] sin did my mother conceive me
[31:59] urge me with hyssop and I shall be clean
[32:01] wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
[32:11] hide thy face from my sin and blot out
[32:13] all my iniquities
[32:21] cast me not away from thy presence and
[32:24] take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[32:27] foreign
[32:33] ERS thy ways and sinners shall be
[32:36] converted unto thee
[32:47] O Lord open thy thou my lips and my
[32:50] mouth shall show forth I praise
[32:59] foreign
[33:03] Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh
[33:06] God thou Wilt not despise
[33:14] all together then shall thou be pleased
[33:17] with the sacrifices of righteousness
[33:19] with a burnt offerings and whole burnt
[33:22] offerings then shall they offer Bullocks
[33:25] upon thine altar
[33:27] brother Troy
[33:28] God bless you
[33:35] foreign
[33:41] so true and Now's the Time to get on the
[33:44] boat
[33:47] uh we had
[33:49] maybe a little bit on the same thought
[33:51] uh
[33:52] thought but uh
[33:56] you can go with me let's see here I kind
[33:58] of
[34:03] but what I was thinking was I was
[34:05] listening to uh sermons morning
[34:08] and brother random was speaking about
[34:09] how in his day he was saying it was
[34:13] three minutes till midnight
[34:14] well now it's 90 seconds to midnight uh
[34:17] the Doomsday Clock they changed to 90
[34:19] seconds they said mostly because of the
[34:22] the war in Ukraine
[34:24] where they said that both sides see that
[34:27] they can win it
[34:29] well I don't see that both sides can win
[34:31] it but that's what I guess they see and
[34:33] that's why they're in that war
[34:34] uh and my wife this morning she said it
[34:38] could
[34:38] how Brethren Brad was seen it would just
[34:40] be a start of a bunch of buttons
[34:43] and uh Russia or Putin had said that
[34:47] if one missile enters their airspace
[34:50] that 100 missiles would be in the air I
[34:52] think within a minute and he he said
[34:54] it's automatic and it would be automatic
[34:56] because everything's automatic these
[34:57] days so it wouldn't be a little thing it
[34:59] would be
[35:00] the end
[35:02] uh of everything and uh in the news then
[35:07] we
[35:09] we had the China uh the Spy balloon it
[35:12] went over the whole nation and then they
[35:13] shot it out of the air now they shot two
[35:15] more things out of the air
[35:16] but uh it just got me thinking my wife
[35:19] had said all it would take is one crazy
[35:22] person to get in there and uh maybe
[35:25] sneak in there
[35:27] I said well you know everything talking
[35:29] back and forth the crazy people are in
[35:31] charge you can't get no crazier than the
[35:34] people that are in charge so
[35:36] uh it could be but either way but we
[35:39] don't have the brightest group in charge
[35:41] of the situation but anyway the the
[35:44] theme that was just pretty much what I
[35:47] was going with I was just gonna go
[35:49] to Genesis chapter 6.
[35:52] in uh to verse five and then I got a
[35:54] couple of
[35:55] little scriptures here I don't know how
[35:57] far I'll get into this but
[36:06] Genesis chapter six and I'm starting
[36:08] just with verse five and it says and God
[36:11] saw the wickedness of man who was great
[36:13] in the earth and then every imagination
[36:15] of thoughts of his heart was only evil
[36:17] continually
[36:19] and it repented the Lord that he had
[36:21] made man on the earth and he grieved him
[36:23] at his heart
[36:24] and the Lord said I will destroy man
[36:26] whom I have created from the man
[36:28] and Beast and creeping thing and the
[36:31] fowls of the air for it repenteth me
[36:33] that I have made them
[36:34] and this is where we want to be found
[36:37] in verse 8 but Noah found Grace in the
[36:41] eyes of the Lord
[36:44] that's where we want to be
[36:46] found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and
[36:48] we have found Grace and eyes the Lord he
[36:49] sent us a message miracle that that we
[36:52] can see it because a lot of people don't
[36:54] see it
[36:55] and there's a lot of good people out
[36:57] there but they just can't see it
[36:59] and let me see here
[37:01] I was going to go over to Matthew 24 and
[37:03] this is Jesus the disciples come to him
[37:09] and they're asking
[37:11] okay Matthew uh 24.
[37:16] and uh
[37:18] Jesus went out and departed from the
[37:22] temple and his disciples came to him for
[37:24] to show him the buildings of the tampon
[37:26] Jesus said unto them c e not all these
[37:29] things rarely I say unto you there shall
[37:31] not be one
[37:33] they're shown not be left here one stone
[37:36] upon another that shall not be thrown
[37:37] down
[37:39] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[37:41] the disciples came unto him privately
[37:43] saying tell us when shall things be and
[37:46] what shall be the sign of the uh coming
[37:48] of the end of the world
[37:51] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[37:55] take heed that no man deceive you for
[37:57] many shall come in my name saying I'm
[37:59] Christ I sh and shall deceive many and
[38:01] you shall hear of Wars rumors of wars
[38:03] see that ye be not troubled for all
[38:06] these things must come to pass but the
[38:09] end is not yet
[38:10] for nation chariz against nation and
[38:13] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[38:14] be famines pestilence and Earth diverse
[38:17] places they just had an earthquake a bad
[38:19] earthquake in Turkey
[38:21] I don't last I looked it was like I
[38:23] think 20 000 people were dead
[38:26] and these are the beginning of Sorrows
[38:28] then shall they deliver you up to be
[38:30] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[38:32] shall be hated all of all Nations for my
[38:35] name's sake
[38:36] and then shall many of the many
[38:40] uh be offended and shall betray one
[38:43] another and shall hate one another
[38:46] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[38:48] deceive many because iniquity shall
[38:50] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[38:53] and that is
[38:55] hits the nail on the head for today
[38:58] but he that shall endure unto the end
[39:00] the same shall be saved in this Gospel
[39:03] of the Kingdom shall be preached in all
[39:05] the world for a witness unto all nations
[39:07] and then shall the End come
[39:10] then ye therefore shall see the
[39:12] abomination of when you therefore shall
[39:15] see the abomination of desolation spoken
[39:17] by the Prophet Daniel
[39:18] stand in the Holy Place who's a readeth
[39:21] let him understand
[39:23] then let them which be it in Jerusalem
[39:25] Judea flee into the mountains let him
[39:28] which is on the housetop not come down
[39:30] to take anything out of his house
[39:32] neither let him which is in the field or
[39:33] turn back to take his clothes and woe
[39:36] unto them
[39:37] that are a child and to them give second
[39:39] those days but pray ye that your flight
[39:41] be not in the winter neither on Sabbath
[39:43] day
[39:44] for then shall the Great Tribulation
[39:46] such as
[39:48] for then shall be great tribulations
[39:49] such as was not since the beginning of
[39:51] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[39:54] be and except those days should days
[39:58] should be shortened there should not
[39:59] have flesh be saved but for the elect
[40:02] sake those days shall be shortened and
[40:05] if any man shall say unto you Lo there
[40:07] here is Christ or there believe it not
[40:09] for there shall arise false Christ false
[40:11] prophets
[40:13] and she also show great signs and
[40:15] wonders in so much as if it were
[40:17] possible they shall they shall deceive
[40:20] the very elect behold I have told you
[40:23] before wherefore if they shall say unto
[40:25] you behold he is in the desert go not
[40:27] forth the holy is in the street Chambers
[40:30] secret Chambers believe it not
[40:32] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[40:34] East and shine it even onto the West
[40:37] social also the coming of the son of man
[40:39] be for whosoever
[40:42] so where for where so ever the carcass
[40:44] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[40:46] together
[40:47] immediately after the tribulation of
[40:49] those days shall the sun be darkened in
[40:51] the moon shall not give her light and
[40:53] the star shall fall from Heaven and the
[40:54] powers of the heavens shall be shaken
[40:56] and then shall appear the sign of the
[40:58] son of man in heaven and then shall all
[41:00] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[41:02] shall see the son of man coming in the
[41:03] Clouds Of Heaven with power and great
[41:05] Glory
[41:06] and he shall send his angel
[41:09] s with a great sound of a truck Trump
[41:11] and they shall gather together as elect
[41:13] from the Four Winds
[41:14] from one end of Heaven to the other
[41:18] now learn the parable of the Fig Tree
[41:19] when his branch is yet tender and puteth
[41:22] forth leaves you know that summer is
[41:23] nice so likewise ye when you shall see
[41:25] all these things know that it is near
[41:27] even at the doors
[41:30] verily I say unto you this generation
[41:32] shall not pass to all these things be
[41:34] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall not
[41:37] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[41:39] words shall not pass away
[41:42] but of that day in our no man no not the
[41:45] angels of heaven but my father only
[41:48] but as in the days of Noah were so shall
[41:51] also be
[41:52] coming unless
[41:53] the son of man be for as in the days of
[41:56] Noah they were in for us in the days
[41:58] that were before the flood they were
[42:01] eating
[42:02] drinking marrying and grieving
[42:05] sorry marrying and giving in marriage
[42:08] until the day that Noah entered into the
[42:10] ark and knew not until the flood came
[42:13] took them all away so shall also the
[42:15] coming of the son of man be then shall
[42:18] two be in the field the one shall be
[42:20] taken and the other left two women shall
[42:22] begin
[42:23] grinding in the at the meal and one
[42:26] shall be taken in the other left
[42:28] watch therefore for ye know not what
[42:31] your what hour your Lord doeth come
[42:34] and he gives good advice here watch the
[42:36] thief would come he would have watched
[42:38] and would not have suffered his house to
[42:40] be broken up
[42:44] money for such an hour and it's not the
[42:47] son of man cometh
[42:48] who then is a faithful and wise serum as
[42:51] Lord hath made ruler over his household
[42:53] to give them meet in due season blessed
[42:56] is the servant whom his Lord when he
[42:58] come and shall find so doing rarely I
[43:01] say unto you that he shall make him
[43:02] ruler over all his Goods
[43:06] but if
[43:08] but and if that evil servant shows
[43:11] in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming
[43:13] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[43:15] servants to eat and drink with the
[43:16] drunken the Lord of that servant shall
[43:18] come in the day when he looketh not for
[43:20] him and in an hour that he is not aware
[43:22] of
[43:23] and shall cut him asunder and appoint
[43:25] him his portion with the Hypocrites
[43:27] there shall be weeping and gnashing of
[43:28] teeth
[43:29] we're right on the verge of
[43:33] I believe the coming of the Lord
[43:36] and I had
[43:38] quote here
[43:42] this is just from the quote of the day
[43:44] just speaking of
[43:45] it's from why Christ here is the world
[43:47] in its condition there's a nation in its
[43:49] condition there's the women in the
[43:51] condition there's the men in the
[43:52] condition there's everything the
[43:54] elements the signs flying saucers and
[43:56] everything in the skies and all kinds of
[43:57] mysterious things and the Sea roaring
[44:00] tidal waves men's Hearts failing fear
[44:03] perplexed of time distress between
[44:05] nations the church falling away and the
[44:08] man of sin rising up
[44:10] who holds himself above all who is
[44:13] called God he that sitteth in the temple
[44:15] of God showing themselves oh my and has
[44:17] come to this nation and the church is
[44:20] organized and all of them gathered
[44:22] together and as harlots to the to
[44:24] everything exactly as the way though in
[44:27] the way of whoredom
[44:28] boredom is it what is it telling women
[44:31] they can cut their hair telling women
[44:33] they can wear shorts telling
[44:35] and do that and the preachers they do
[44:38] this in the social gospel and things
[44:41] don't let's see
[44:44] don't you see it it's committing
[44:45] adultery with the true
[44:48] can't get to the bottom of this one
[44:50] word I believe is what he said and gods
[44:53] has sent us his true word
[44:55] undenominational no strings tied to it
[44:57] and giving give us
[44:59] pill AR verify
[45:03] or the Holy Ghost that's been with us
[45:05] now for 30 years and we can say for more
[45:07] years than 30 years and everything that
[45:09] he has predicted said come to pass
[45:12] exactly the way he did it
[45:15] and the scripture was but the end of
[45:17] things this is
[45:24] but
[45:27] he therefore sober and watch under
[45:30] prayer I'm shared an article uh where
[45:33] they said the was it the FBI I think had
[45:36] found a loophole where they could uh
[45:38] make Christians or persecute Christians

[45:42] Catholics so it's strange how it's all
[45:45] going to work out but
[45:46] it'll give I was thinking on the way to
[45:49] church
[45:50] how the how the second beast would give
[45:52] power to the first beast and I was
[45:55] thinking of our our government and what
[45:57] it's turned into and it that it is a
[45:59] beast and one day it will give all the
[46:01] power back to that

[1:18:39] by amen is if the Lord will just Inspire
[1:18:42] something on my heart and so I trust
[1:18:44] that it'll be a blessing to you it's
[1:18:46] certainly something that we've heard
[1:18:47] before but I hope perhaps with the help
[1:18:50] oh Lord bring it about perhaps in just a
[1:18:52] little bit different light if we can
[1:18:54] with the help of the Lord amen and so
[1:18:56] this is certainly a message you could
[1:18:58] take a while on but we'll just try to
[1:19:00] follow the leading of the spirit in
[1:19:01] which direction to go and what to say on
[1:19:04] it
[1:19:04] so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we
[1:19:06] come before you father realizing God
[1:19:09] when we look on the world on the
[1:19:10] condition of the world as the different
[1:19:12] ones are spoken already this morning
[1:19:14] Lord the eliteness of the hour father
[1:19:16] and where we're at and how Lord even
[1:19:18] yesterday and different times you begin
[1:19:20] to think about your country and the way
[1:19:22] that the condition of the world is it
[1:19:24] just weighs heavy on your heart and it
[1:19:26] makes you sad to think that it's gotten
[1:19:29] that bad and that it is where it is but
[1:19:31] we realize it has to get that way but
[1:19:33] Lord you are long-suffering father we
[1:19:36] realize that
[1:19:37] sometimes wonder why you haven't come
[1:19:39] yet but when we think about nine billion
[1:19:42] people perhaps lives hanging the balance
[1:19:44] and how patient you are and how long
[1:19:46] suffering you are not willing that any
[1:19:49] should perish but that all would come to
[1:19:51] repentance Lord and father you're going
[1:19:53] to change it Lord we know when you
[1:19:55] finally do something and when your day
[1:19:56] comes and when we're
[1:19:58] Mercy's over Lord that it's not going to
[1:20:00] be pleasant
[1:20:02] it's going to be very terrible it's
[1:20:04] going to be apocalyptic Lord Jesus and
[1:20:06] you're going to change both the heavens
[1:20:08] and the Earth Lord Jesus and you're
[1:20:11] going to turn it inside out so to speak
[1:20:13] in all the Sinners and all they'll be
[1:20:15] turned on turned under so to speak Lord
[1:20:17] and with the volcanoes and the
[1:20:20] fired as coming Lord but we're looking
[1:20:22] for a Heavenly Father that'll Lift us up
[1:20:25] Lord Jesus and change our mortal bodies
[1:20:28] Lord and take us out of this world
[1:20:30] father we're just feeling less at home
[1:20:32] and less at home here
[1:20:34] and Beulah Land is certainly calling our
[1:20:37] hearts this morning Father we ask God
[1:20:39] that you'll bless the meditation of our
[1:20:41] heart Lord Jesus bless the reading of
[1:20:42] the word come Lord and speak to the
[1:20:45] church father by your spirit the things
[1:20:46] that you once said today draw us closer
[1:20:49] to you now Lord we ask it in Jesus
[1:20:52] Christ's name amen and amen turn your
[1:20:54] bibles if you will we'll go right into
[1:20:56] our thought this morning amen and I want
[1:20:58] to speak and I'll just give you my title
[1:21:00] and I want to call this why a revelation
[1:21:04] is so important amen why Revelation is
[1:21:09] so important it seems certainly to have
[1:21:11] been a topic over the years around the
[1:21:14] message for amen for a very long time
[1:21:16] time and it's been said over and over
[1:21:18] but I
[1:21:19] I want to again this morning with the
[1:21:21] help of the Lord look at why it is so
[1:21:23] important so let's
[1:21:26] look and we'll just read
[1:21:28] perhaps a couple of scriptures that
[1:21:30] we'll start with let's go with the Book
[1:21:31] of Revelations first of all
[1:21:35] amen the book of
[1:21:36] Revelations the first chapter amen
[1:21:44] revelation of Jesus Christ amen praise
[1:21:48] the Lord how many seed right there that
[1:21:51] is pretty important amen
[1:21:53] amen this is the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:55] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[1:21:57] unto his servants the things which must
[1:22:00] certainly come to pass and he sentence
[1:22:03] who bear record of the word of God and
[1:22:05] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[1:22:07] all things that is
[1:22:09] oh
[1:22:11] amen I like this next verse blessed is
[1:22:15] he that readeth and they that hear the
[1:22:19] words of this prophecy amen and keep
[1:22:23] those things which are written therein
[1:22:25] for the time is at hand may God add His
[1:22:28] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:22:30] can be seated this morning amen first I
[1:22:33] want to begin amen uh because you know I
[1:22:36] mean talking about and this revelation
[1:22:39] we know what Revelation means and
[1:22:41] Revelation means to uncover something
[1:22:44] that has been covered or hid Amen to
[1:22:48] reveal Something Real Simple English for
[1:22:50] us right just to make known something
[1:22:53] that isn't no amen and so be known God
[1:22:57] to the people I mean there's this whole
[1:22:59] thing all along it's been about God
[1:23:02] showing himself
[1:23:04] making himself known
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:10] amen how many knows As He makes himself
[1:23:12] known I was reading somewhere and I'm
[1:23:15] not sure where it was but it's something
[1:23:16] somewhere he says God and said I'm going
[1:23:18] to do this
[1:23:20] amen uh how is the word anymore did he
[1:23:24] say say uh uh something that they would
[1:23:27] stand in awe so that you would be in awe
[1:23:30] amen God Wants You in awe of him because
[1:23:33] somebody knows the more you think about
[1:23:34] God and the more you know about God the
[1:23:36] more you truly are in awe of God
[1:23:42] amen
[1:23:43] now how many knows that God first of all
[1:23:46] he hides himself
[1:23:48] right he hides himself in humility and
[1:23:52] simplicity and as a prophet put it and
[1:23:55] he reveals himself in the same
[1:23:58] notice he hides himself in humility and
[1:24:02] simplicity and then he reveals himself
[1:24:04] in the in that same way and we know that
[1:24:08] he God he guides himself many times so
[1:24:10] simple does things so simple until
[1:24:12] people pass right over it and don't see
[1:24:15] it
[1:24:17] amen even to the point remember this
[1:24:21] that the Bible talks about it Prophet is
[1:24:22] not received amen except for in his own
[1:24:25] country among his own people many times
[1:24:27] people that know you have a harder time
[1:24:30] accepting things from you
[1:24:33] the only family members a lot of times
[1:24:35] it's harder to accept it from them
[1:24:37] because well I know him
[1:24:40] huh you know I know that person you know
[1:24:43] and if it's the same way with Jesus
[1:24:44] remember he could not do many works
[1:24:46] because they said well isn't this uh
[1:24:48] Joseph I mean Jesus the son of Joseph
[1:24:51] they didn't look at him
[1:24:53] right way other place
[1:24:55] is he can do a lot but not in his own
[1:24:57] country so God many times hides himself
[1:25:01] in his
[1:25:02] broken folks among the old amen and so
[1:25:05] you always have to be careful amen and
[1:25:07] so this morning of course we know we
[1:25:09] could go all the way back to God before
[1:25:10] he became manifested and then he
[1:25:12] manifested himself in the logos and came
[1:25:15] into the
[1:25:16] Philip
[1:25:17] fire
[1:25:20] and into word form and on down like that
[1:25:23] you know and I'm not good explaining all
[1:25:24] that but we take that
[1:25:26] the gut was all that God was revealing
[1:25:28] himself God was coming forth you know
[1:25:31] and you might think well he's got the
[1:25:33] pillar of fire Whirlwind sometimes in a
[1:25:35] pillar of fire but there's one thing we
[1:25:36] know and that is the Bible
[1:25:38] God is a consuming fire god is a spirit
[1:25:41] and they that worship Him must worship
[1:25:46] in spirit
[1:25:48] and truth you know if you're going to
[1:25:50] worship God this morning it has to be in
[1:25:52] the spirit
[1:25:53] amen another place Paul
[1:25:56] that you know man can call Jesus to
[1:25:58] Christ but by the Holy Ghost in other
[1:26:00] words you might say it from your left
[1:26:01] but you really don't know him
[1:26:03] until you've got the holy ghost man
[1:26:09] all right let's take it slow would that
[1:26:11] be all right
[1:26:13] amen so we see here that this whole
[1:26:16] thing is the Book of Revelations and it
[1:26:18] says that blessed is he are they that
[1:26:21] here and will focus
[1:26:23] on
[1:26:24] that
[1:26:25] a little after a while about being able
[1:26:27] to hear
[1:26:28] and being able to see comes along with
[1:26:31] that because we know that not very many
[1:26:33] people truly see God
[1:26:36] oh yeah amen
[1:26:39] so many
[1:26:40] people Miss God Amen when you don't
[1:26:43] see God
[1:26:45] and
[1:26:46] many people see God in a different
[1:26:48] perspective in a minute different way
[1:26:50] amen I think about Amish and where I
[1:26:52] come from well if you don't get put in
[1:26:54] the band or you're a good punished and
[1:26:56] so forth and we see you they kind of see
[1:26:58] God as a Punisher you know just to do an
[1:27:00] adult and punishing it amen you know
[1:27:03] what I had y'all judge me this morning
[1:27:06] and tell me if my thought wasn't uh was
[1:27:10] correct or not but I had a thought here
[1:27:11] either yesterday or this morning and
[1:27:13] thinking about how that you know that
[1:27:15] there's all these different churches out
[1:27:17] there and and whether it's Amish
[1:27:19] Mennonite on all these different
[1:27:20] churches right and and you think about
[1:27:23] it if they won't follow the truth
[1:27:26] then that actually makes them a cult
[1:27:28] because they call us a call or you're
[1:27:30] following a man you're following a false
[1:27:32] prophet and so forth right
[1:27:34] amen but if you don't follow the word of
[1:27:36] God and who God sends and you reject the
[1:27:39] truth you're actually Nicole
[1:27:41] and I'll tell you right right now when I
[1:27:42] think about Amish and so forth and at
[1:27:44] different churches you know you realize
[1:27:46] that's a lot of it's if it's not the
[1:27:48] truth it's truly brainwashing
[1:27:51] because I'm these folks I'll tell you
[1:27:52] they're we're raised so strict that well
[1:27:54] I'll tell you you believe that you got
[1:27:56] to be that way or you're going to be
[1:27:57] damned right and and so forth and and
[1:28:01] they truly believe that and look at no
[1:28:03] matter whether they're right or no
[1:28:04] matter how wrong they still have a great
[1:28:07] following look at the look at the group
[1:28:08] that's out there
[1:28:12] amen and you present that the truth to
[1:28:14] them and see what they do with it
[1:28:16] amen so you be the judge but it's a cult
[1:28:18] anything outside and you know I thought
[1:28:20] about this that actually it's it's not
[1:28:23] astounding people will follow all kinds
[1:28:26] of religions
[1:28:27] because if you won't follow the truth of
[1:28:29] God then you'll follow anything
[1:28:31] that satisfies you that's why you have
[1:28:34] the Amish and then you have the higher
[1:28:36] Amish and then you have people that have
[1:28:37] electricity and you have people that
[1:28:39] actually drive cars and you have you
[1:28:41] know on down on down on down you know on
[1:28:43] up all claiming to worship God
[1:28:47] they have all a perspective what Jesus
[1:28:49] is
[1:28:50] isn't that right they think that's how
[1:28:53] God is that's how Jesus is
[1:28:55] and how about the Pharisees and let me
[1:28:57] tell you something how many knows it's
[1:28:59] blindness
[1:29:00] blindness is what it is
[1:29:03] because uh uh anything outside of the
[1:29:06] truth truth is Blindness let me go to um
[1:29:10] Matthew Matthew
[1:29:12] 11 will begin with 11 and verse 25.
[1:29:18] and at that time Jesus answered and said
[1:29:21] I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and
[1:29:24] Earth because thou has hid thee things
[1:29:27] from the wise and prudent and has
[1:29:31] revealed them unto babes
[1:29:34] I mean notice that uh you know that
[1:29:37] unless God oh this is the other thing I
[1:29:40] thought about it this is
[1:29:42] all about what God does
[1:29:46] right and that's what your whole life is
[1:29:49] about it's about what God does in your
[1:29:51] life it's not so much about what you do
[1:29:53] it's about one either
[1:29:55] and when he reveals something to you
[1:29:57] just like he revealed to Peter right he
[1:30:01] said you know flesh and blood is not
[1:30:03] revealed this to you but my Father which
[1:30:06] is in heaven he has revealed this to you
[1:30:09] and what did he say the Gates of Hell
[1:30:11] shall not Prevail against it now I want
[1:30:14] to say this morning one of the reasons
[1:30:16] why revelation of God Amen is so
[1:30:18] important is because it's what the Gates
[1:30:20] of Hell will not Prevail against
[1:30:22] true Revelation amen
[1:30:26] true making no true making known of God
[1:30:30] now
[1:30:31] let's go a little bit back a little bit
[1:30:34] once again and think about it
[1:30:36] the Bible talks about the God's Eternal
[1:30:39] godhead I believe it's Romans 1 is
[1:30:42] understood by the things that are
[1:30:43] created
[1:30:44] so now we know that God manifested
[1:30:47] himself and shows himself in his
[1:30:50] creation
[1:30:51] all right
[1:30:53] Amen to us dog raisers we all know that
[1:30:57] one of the most amazing things is that
[1:30:59] when them little puppies come out when
[1:31:01] they come out of the bag God is
[1:31:04] absolutely giving them a instinct
[1:31:07] you don't have to help him there's
[1:31:08] nothing to have an instinct to go and
[1:31:10] find that teeth
[1:31:13] they will struggling person the first
[1:31:15] place they had for us that Mama T didn't
[1:31:17] know he got to get in there now you know
[1:31:20] that's just something that God has
[1:31:22] placed in there
[1:31:24] amen then you think about all of
[1:31:27] creation that God you can see God in all
[1:31:30] of creation
[1:31:36] tell you what you know like better man
[1:31:37] preacher Paradox and he talked about how
[1:31:40] that creation is and the Sun and the
[1:31:42] Moon and the and the tides that are held
[1:31:44] and everything about God's creation is a
[1:31:47] paradox
[1:31:48] it's all a miracle
[1:31:51] is that right I mean you know you can
[1:31:54] look at the animal kingdom and you
[1:31:56] realize we call the lion the king of the
[1:31:58] jungle
[1:32:00] I don't care if it's a giraffe them
[1:32:02] crazy Jokers will jump that giraffe if
[1:32:05] they get kicked to smithering
[1:32:09] they're just about afraid of nothing and
[1:32:12] they're called the king of the jungle
[1:32:13] that's why the Bible says that he's a
[1:32:15] lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:32:18] it was the type of his godhead that he
[1:32:21] is the supreme ruler
[1:32:24] amen when the lion roars every Beetle
[1:32:27] and Bug shuts up
[1:32:29] let me tell you how would you understand
[1:32:31] God is roared in this generation he has
[1:32:35] spoken and he has shut up every other
[1:32:37] voice
[1:32:39] God's voice the voice of God the word of
[1:32:42] God shuts every other voice
[1:32:45] oh my
[1:32:46] God that's why we're in the condition
[1:32:48] that we're in because people mix God's
[1:32:52] word up
[1:32:54] get their own ideas mixed up in the plan
[1:32:56] of God and it messes it up
[1:33:00] praise the Lord
[1:33:03] so you can you can just be amazed I'm
[1:33:06] gonna just go a little longer on that
[1:33:09] people love to go to the beach
[1:33:13] they love to go to the beach do you love
[1:33:15] to go to mountains and all of this and
[1:33:17] it's all it talk about
[1:33:20] uh I think I'll just read the scripture
[1:33:22] while I'm at it
[1:33:26] in other words they're enjoying God's
[1:33:28] creation
[1:33:30] they're enjoying God's glory
[1:33:34] because how many knows that's where God
[1:33:36] is
[1:33:37] God is in his creation
[1:33:39] amen that fisherman with a young boy
[1:33:41] that asked his teacher and Mom and Dad
[1:33:44] and pastor and can anybody see God but
[1:33:46] there's one fisherman he asked one time
[1:33:48] when tears were rolling can anybody see
[1:33:50] God my he says boy boy I'll tell you if
[1:33:52] that's all I have seen for the last 40
[1:33:54] years is God
[1:33:56] amen when you see the Instinct of
[1:33:58] animals and all these things and the
[1:33:59] creation of these just see God like
[1:34:01] brother Brandon when he was out there
[1:34:03] and he heard the wolf calling to its
[1:34:05] mate the elf bugling to its mating all
[1:34:08] my evil Associates you
[1:34:12] I see you God I hear you God you're the
[1:34:16] one that made it all
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:18] when I hear somebody worshiping saying
[1:34:21] praise be to God
[1:34:22] that was God made you that way
[1:34:27] he created us that way
[1:34:29] can you see God this morning can you
[1:34:31] hear God
[1:34:34] oh my
[1:34:36] God what a glorious thing
[1:34:40] now notice
[1:34:42] I was going to read this
[1:34:43] at the end but
[1:34:45] I'm gonna talk about
[1:34:49] uh you know God is gonna I know God is
[1:34:53] going to manifest himself God is going
[1:34:55] to reveal himself
[1:34:57] to the world one of these days
[1:35:00] you want to see how he's going to reveal
[1:35:01] it
[1:35:02] seeing it is a righteous this second
[1:35:04] Thessalonians 1 and verse 6. seeing it
[1:35:06] is a righteous thing with God to
[1:35:08] recompense tribulation on them that
[1:35:10] trouble you and to you who are troubled
[1:35:13] rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall
[1:35:15] be revealed
[1:35:17] amen from heaven with his mighty angels
[1:35:22] inflaming fire taking Vengeance on them
[1:35:27] that know not God
[1:35:31] how many knows when the fire falls when
[1:35:34] this thing starts a cobble and wobble
[1:35:37] they're gonna know
[1:35:39] we got to come he's coming
[1:35:41] huh he's going to come in Vengeance
[1:35:44] taking Vengeance on them that no God and
[1:35:46] that obey not the gospel of our Lord
[1:35:49] Jesus Christ who shall be punished with
[1:35:52] Everlasting from the presence of the
[1:35:55] Lord number one and from the glory of
[1:36:00] his power
[1:36:01] huh so right now they're they're
[1:36:04] enjoying themselves in the glory of his
[1:36:07] power
[1:36:08] isn't that right
[1:36:09] all the pleasure to have on there all of
[1:36:12] that's going to be they're not going to
[1:36:13] be in any of the glory of God
[1:36:16] there'll be these uh they'll be
[1:36:18] suffering destruction from the presence
[1:36:20] of the Lord and
[1:36:22] from the glory the glory of his
[1:36:25] power when he shall come to be glorified
[1:36:28] in his Saints and to be admired in all
[1:36:33] them that believes
[1:36:35] he admired in all of them
[1:36:38] but on the other side he's going to make
[1:36:40] himself known he's going to remove
[1:36:42] himself
[1:36:43] to them
[1:36:45] from heaven with his mighty Angels
[1:36:47] taking fire
[1:36:50] amen I might as well say something else
[1:36:52] why it comes to mind talking about this
[1:36:54] you know how the world and how the the
[1:36:58] lefts
[1:36:59] so to speak and all of these people that
[1:37:01] are trying to have this green New Deal
[1:37:04] and green green energy and electric cars
[1:37:09] and save the ozone and you know don't
[1:37:13] destroy the world and so forth and don't
[1:37:15] pollute it we want to keep it all this
[1:37:17] way that way the other and folks how
[1:37:19] many knows in God's word says it's going
[1:37:20] to burn
[1:37:23] folks there ain't enough green deals
[1:37:25] ain't enough green energy or whatever
[1:37:27] that's ever going to stop this thing
[1:37:28] from completely burning to the ground
[1:37:30] huh
[1:37:32] God's word is already said it's going to
[1:37:34] happen to Heavens there's going to be on
[1:37:35] fire the elements shall melt with firm
[1:37:39] and heat I don't care how much we go to
[1:37:40] electric cars and don't try to put up in
[1:37:42] the film you're gonna burn anyway folks
[1:37:45] They Ain't Gonna Save nothing
[1:37:48] ah to God's word is already spoken it's
[1:37:51] going to happen and all the Sinners it's
[1:37:53] what's coming to destroy
[1:37:55] amen
[1:37:56] all my eyes that's right
[1:37:58] God they'll never stop the word of God
[1:38:00] will they
[1:38:03] okay praise the Lord
[1:38:05] so we want to start brother Madam says
[1:38:08] now he says we need in page 31 of church
[1:38:11] age but and I put a why there in front
[1:38:15] because that's what I want to speak on
[1:38:16] why we need to call on God for
[1:38:20] Revelation more than anything else in
[1:38:24] the world
[1:38:26] foreign
[1:38:28] why do we focus so much on that
[1:38:31] amen and then we'll get right down to
[1:38:32] the nitty-gritty after a while with the
[1:38:34] Lord we have accepted the Bible we have
[1:38:36] to accept that the great truths of it
[1:38:38] but still it is not real to most people
[1:38:43] I mean who knows that even though the
[1:38:45] Holy Spirit exists God exists amen Allah
[1:38:50] all the full power of
[1:38:52] God this is death
[1:38:55] but yet he's not real to most people
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:03] first of all so he says we need to pray
[1:39:05] for Revelation more than anything else
[1:39:08] in the world I want to talk about why
[1:39:10] that we do that
[1:39:13] now while he hides himself in simplicity
[1:39:18] and reveals himself in the same and so
[1:39:21] many people
[1:39:22] you know as the prophet of God says we
[1:39:24] are so smart we can create uh Cape
[1:39:28] Canaveral I guess down in Florida and
[1:39:30] we'll build these rockets that we takes
[1:39:33] the Geniuses to put together and we'll
[1:39:35] fly to the moon
[1:39:38] and we'll have the greatness
[1:39:40] step for mankind isn't that right
[1:39:44] and so forth the better man says you
[1:39:46] know we can fly what good is he gonna do
[1:39:48] when they get there they can do that but
[1:39:50] they can't tell you what makes a blade
[1:39:53] of grass grow
[1:39:58] oh can I say something they might be
[1:40:02] able to but they don't want
[1:40:04] to
[1:40:06] they don't want to say that it's God
[1:40:08] that makes that faith of God's law it is
[1:40:10] God that causes them trees to go down in
[1:40:12] the fall and brings them back in the
[1:40:13] winter I mean go down in the fall and
[1:40:16] come back in this Wednesday thank God
[1:40:19] but what is it it's God is great it's
[1:40:22] God that does it
[1:40:24] how many threatened God is all around
[1:40:26] he's around he's here he's there in your
[1:40:29] car when you drive he's everywhere God
[1:40:31] is there
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:34] my
[1:40:39] all right
[1:40:40] let's see what Paul said about it
[1:40:42] Paul said about it in this
[1:40:44] situated and we're talking about the
[1:40:46] beginning of the creation and so forth
[1:40:47] we want to get into the world and things
[1:40:49] that has been hid and then made known
[1:40:50] because even in the Old Testament people
[1:40:53] didn't really understand God did they
[1:40:55] for eons of time people don't understand
[1:40:57] God
[1:40:58] I didn't I don't know about you but
[1:41:01] aren't you wanting to get to understand
[1:41:02] God more and more and more
[1:41:08] I do I want to get to understand him
[1:41:11] greater
[1:41:14] before I read this let's just go in the
[1:41:16] Old Testament would you take a little
[1:41:17] leap and we'll go back and forth
[1:41:19] but in the Old Testament he was what the
[1:41:21] father wasn't he
[1:41:22] he was the son in the New Testament and
[1:41:24] he was the Holy Ghost in the church
[1:41:25] dispensation in the Old Testament what
[1:41:28] did he say thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:41:30] Thou shalt not and if you do you're
[1:41:32] gonna get punished if you disobeying
[1:41:34] media people are going to come and make
[1:41:36] slaves out of you and he boy he was a
[1:41:37] real father
[1:41:40] and no doubt but they looked at him as
[1:41:41] the great and terrible God that if he's
[1:41:43] touched foot on that mountain you've got
[1:41:45] to be struck that if you come in behind
[1:41:46] the Holy Soul you got me struck man
[1:41:49] you didn't know what a father and mother
[1:41:51] do a lot of times they say don't do this
[1:41:53] don't do that don't do this we got the
[1:41:55] big old paddler
[1:41:57] and then we had a we had one of them
[1:41:59] five gallon bucket paint sticks two of
[1:42:02] them taped together we wrote on their
[1:42:05] Soul Saver
[1:42:08] so every time the boys got a whooping
[1:42:10] they had a paddle on their backside
[1:42:12] that's so favorite
[1:42:15] amen
[1:42:18] oh boy Mike I mean Mike I guess kids
[1:42:21] won't have any kids but Mike is you know
[1:42:24] he gets here with me you've never
[1:42:26] treated us like that you'd have tore us
[1:42:29] up for that I'm like I'm a grand party
[1:42:34] they're girls they don't do anything
[1:42:36] wrong
[1:42:37] [Laughter]
[1:42:40] foreign
[1:42:48] that right the New Testament
[1:42:51] he came beside it was a different
[1:42:53] dispensation
[1:42:55] wasn't it he revealed himself now and he
[1:42:58] says I will have mercy go and study this
[1:43:01] as I will have mercy
[1:43:04] that's when he come he doesn't come to
[1:43:06] condemn the world he came to magnify the
[1:43:09] law he come and he had love for the
[1:43:11] world for God so loved the world begin
[1:43:13] to see the affection and the passion of
[1:43:15] almighty God and let me tell you
[1:43:16] something how many know did God Express
[1:43:18] himself perfectly in Jesus Christ if you
[1:43:20] want to know how God is and what he
[1:43:22] thinks like just going to marry she
[1:43:24] deserves to die but he said then I'll
[1:43:26] neither do I condemnity go and sin no
[1:43:29] more
[1:43:32] amen
[1:43:33] you could under
[1:43:35] understand we could see what he was like
[1:43:37] now
[1:43:37] but I'm going to ask how many notes of
[1:43:39] Pharisees could I see him
[1:43:41] no they couldn't
[1:43:42] really see him
[1:43:45] they were blinded
[1:43:48] and it's sad folks
[1:43:51] but even Paul said according to brother
[1:43:53] Branham when he read Darren Paul
[1:43:55] in whom the God of this world has
[1:43:57] blinded the minds of those that believe
[1:44:00] not
[1:44:01] how many of us be able to see with your
[1:44:03] eyes
[1:44:04] but they can't see with their heart
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:09] let me just go here and read this
[1:44:11] in Ephesians 3 Paul begins to explain
[1:44:14] how that things have been hit but now
[1:44:16] they're made open for this cause I Paul
[1:44:19] the prisoner of Jesus Christ to you for
[1:44:21] you gentiles
[1:44:22] if
[1:44:23] you have heard of the this
[1:44:25] compensation of grace of God which is
[1:44:27] given to me to you
[1:44:29] word how about by revelation
[1:44:34] by Revelation he made known unto me the
[1:44:37] mystery which I've wrote unto you in few
[1:44:39] words whereby when you read give me I
[1:44:41] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[1:44:43] of Christ which in other Ages was not
[1:44:46] made known Unto the Sons of men as it is
[1:44:49] now revered
[1:44:51] amen that the Gentiles should be fellow
[1:44:54] heirs and of the same body and partake
[1:44:57] because I mean his promise in Christ by
[1:44:59] the gospel well I made a minister
[1:45:03] according to the gift of grace of God
[1:45:04] given unto me by the effects of working
[1:45:07] of his power unto me who at least in the
[1:45:11] then who am less than the least huh
[1:45:15] that's down pretty far isn't it when
[1:45:18] you're less than the least
[1:45:21] Paul was humble wasn't he
[1:45:23] yeah he was the right
[1:45:26] reminder of the New Testament
[1:45:29] he really wasn't
[1:45:32] amen but he counted himself that because
[1:45:34] he persecuted the Church of God even not
[1:45:37] to death he was really really off he was
[1:45:40] wrong he was a rotten he said I'm the
[1:45:42] chief list of sinners
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:46] laughs is this Grace given that I should
[1:45:49] preach among those Gentiles The
[1:45:51] unsearchable Riches of Christ
[1:45:55] when you really think about how rich God
[1:45:58] was in Mercy For You and I
[1:46:02] when I think of the goodness of Jesus
[1:46:04] and all and for me then my soul Cries
[1:46:07] Out
[1:46:09] Hallelujah
[1:46:10] Glory when you think about how good God
[1:46:13] was we were Gentiles heathens we had no
[1:46:15] part but yet God brought us in
[1:46:20] if every race out there would realize
[1:46:25] that God has taken in all Races
[1:46:28] all colors
[1:46:30] amen
[1:46:31] oh everybody whomsoever will let him
[1:46:35] come he didn't say except this breed or
[1:46:39] this kind or discolor whosoever will
[1:46:42] let him come what Riches of his grace
[1:46:45] and what to make all
[1:46:48] come on and to make
[1:46:51] all men see what is the Fellowship of
[1:46:53] the men history which from the beginning
[1:46:56] of the world has been hid in God who
[1:47:00] created All Things by Jesus Christ
[1:47:03] to the intent that now unto the
[1:47:05] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:47:08] places might be made known by the church
[1:47:11] the manifold wisdom of God
[1:47:18] another
[1:47:20] words
[1:47:21] he now makes known by the church the
[1:47:26] full wisdom of God
[1:47:28] how many that were closed God opened
[1:47:32] he and he gave us understand he said
[1:47:34] blessed is he
[1:47:36] that heareth
[1:47:38] the the writings of this book and so
[1:47:40] forth amen blessed are the people that
[1:47:42] understand what the Seven Stars were
[1:47:44] blessed are the people who understand
[1:47:46] what the seven golden candles things
[1:47:48] were who that man was in the midst of
[1:47:50] the seven colon candlesticks
[1:47:52] amen praise be to God how many knows
[1:47:55] it's been Christ through the church the
[1:47:57] whole way
[1:47:59] parinius Martin combo all of all the
[1:48:01] preachers down through all the ages
[1:48:03] that's cried out this message and here
[1:48:05] we are still 2023 preaching the same
[1:48:08] thing the same Grace the same love the
[1:48:11] same forgiveness
[1:48:13] the same marvelous unveiled God
[1:48:18] The Greatest Story Ever Told of Jesus
[1:48:21] Christ coming
[1:48:22] for you and me amen
[1:48:26] amen
[1:48:28] another scripture and Paul talked about
[1:48:30] this in different books but in Ephesians
[1:48:32] he seemed to describe it many more times
[1:48:34] Ephesians 1 and verse 15 it says where I
[1:48:37] also after I heard of your faith in
[1:48:39] Jesus Christ and love of all the saints
[1:48:41] cease not to give thanks for you make
[1:48:45] making mention of you in my prayers that
[1:48:47] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:48:49] father of glory be given to you the
[1:48:51] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[1:48:55] knowledge of him
[1:48:57] and he believes that's what we need
[1:49:01] oh my
[1:49:03] oh no notice I want to say make this
[1:49:06] statement that you do not see with your
[1:49:09] eyes the Gospel of Jesus Christ you
[1:49:12] can't see Christ
[1:49:14] with your eyes
[1:49:19] it has to be the eyes
[1:49:21] Verse 18 the eyes of your understanding
[1:49:26] amen
[1:49:27] being enlightened that ye may know what
[1:49:31] is the hope of his calling and what the
[1:49:33] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:49:35] in the Saints amen seeing
[1:49:39] with the eyes of your understanding
[1:49:44] Matthew 13 and verse 13 it says
[1:49:48] therefore I speak unto them in Parables
[1:49:51] because they sing see not and hearing
[1:49:54] hear not
[1:49:56] amen remember Revelations is this
[1:49:58] blessed are they that hear the words of
[1:50:00] this prophecy
[1:50:02] let me tell you something you've got to
[1:50:03] send Malachi 4 to show and open that
[1:50:06] mystery when the Seven Angels Came Down
[1:50:08] in Arizona and said you go back to
[1:50:10] Jeffersonville because we're going to
[1:50:11] open up the revelation of the Seven
[1:50:13] Seals
[1:50:16] and when they say well you know we don't
[1:50:18] believe he's a prophet we don't believe
[1:50:19] he's a prophet
[1:50:21] huh
[1:50:22] how are you ever going to understand the
[1:50:24] things that are in there you're not
[1:50:25] going to get the blessedness of being
[1:50:27] able to hear what is in that book
[1:50:34] amen
[1:50:36] notice seeing is he not hearing here on
[1:50:44] neither
[1:50:45] do they
[1:50:47] under sand
[1:50:50] how many knows it's in understanding
[1:50:55] so many people are blind when you uh you
[1:50:57] know because the devil has blinds people
[1:50:59] people you know now you be careful
[1:51:01] watching the prophet watching watching
[1:51:03] following the man and so forth and uh
[1:51:05] you know it's a cult so when you go to
[1:51:07] telling them about brother Bannerman who
[1:51:09] got sent as a prophet and so forth
[1:51:10] automatically their eyes are already
[1:51:12] shut they oh boy this is what they told
[1:51:14] me to watch
[1:51:15] and they won't believe a word you say
[1:51:18] because they've already got the blinders
[1:51:20] on
[1:51:21] how many knows that it is only the grace
[1:51:24] of God that can open their eyes
[1:51:27] that can open anybody's eyes to the
[1:51:30] truth it takes God opening their eyes
[1:51:34] how many is glad to be able to see
[1:51:36] you you know it's about understanding
[1:51:39] thank you Lord Jesus for opening my eyes
[1:51:41] to be able to understand yes I
[1:51:43] understand
[1:51:46] I'm dealing with a person right now who
[1:51:48] has a prophet's message and different
[1:51:50] things like that but yet just can't see
[1:51:53] brother Benham as being a prophet and so
[1:51:55] forth
[1:51:56] I'm like well my question is you know if
[1:51:59] you'd have lived in the days of Noah
[1:52:01] would you have believed Noah's message
[1:52:04] if you'd have been the days of John the
[1:52:05] Baptist would you have gotten baptized
[1:52:08] under John
[1:52:09] it's baptism and believed that he was
[1:52:11] the Messiah that was not the Messiah but
[1:52:13] he was to introduce the first coming of
[1:52:16] Christ
[1:52:17] behold I send my message before my sure
[1:52:19] I believe
[1:52:21] I believe would you have been the
[1:52:22] follower of Paul when he said follow me
[1:52:23] as I followed by wrote the New Testament
[1:52:26] but if
[1:52:28] you can't believe when God sends a man
[1:52:30] today that it's equal if not more than
[1:52:32] any of them
[1:52:34] don't tell me you to believe them
[1:52:37] you wouldn't
[1:52:38] because the way you believe God today is
[1:52:40] how you to believe him back then
[1:52:43] I'm like you know but it takes God to
[1:52:44] Open the Eyes
[1:52:46] because it wasn't the problem that God
[1:52:47] could discern the thoughts and the
[1:52:48] intents of the heart and millions of
[1:52:50] times it's thus save the Lord
[1:52:53] folks I mean if we hadn't had thirsty of
[1:52:55] the Lord for many many years somebody
[1:52:57] could say that and that's not the saith
[1:52:59] brother Branham when he says that says
[1:53:02] the Lord It's thus saith the Lord
[1:53:04] but now if he says now this is just in
[1:53:05] my opinion this is the way I see it then
[1:53:07] that's just brother but I'm talking just
[1:53:09] like Paul he says this is my thought on
[1:53:10] it
[1:53:12] but here with thus saith the Lord and
[1:53:14] Jesus Christ coming into Discerning
[1:53:16] thoughts intents of the heart Time and
[1:53:17] Time and Time and Time and Time and Time
[1:53:19] Again and you can't
[1:53:21] see that that's the same thing remember
[1:53:23] Brother Band says God is identified by
[1:53:26] his characteristics in other words
[1:53:29] however he was yesterday that's if he
[1:53:31] does the same thing today you know
[1:53:33] that's God
[1:53:34] that's how you can see him but what did
[1:53:36] the Pentecost even the Pentecostals
[1:53:38] think about it
[1:53:39] couldn't see it
[1:53:44] there shouldn't be a Pentecostal message
[1:53:46] church out there this should all be
[1:53:48] message churches
[1:53:50] but they couldn't see it
[1:53:53] isn't it sad
[1:53:55] that's why the world is in the condition
[1:53:57] that it's in
[1:54:01] can I
[1:54:03] bring it down to a personal basis if you
[1:54:06] don't see Christ the way that you should
[1:54:08] you'll also also be in a bad place in a
[1:54:11] bad way if you don't see him the right
[1:54:13] way
[1:54:14] if you can't truly be hit but Paul says
[1:54:16] you're open now and we can say in our
[1:54:18] age now more than ever has it been made
[1:54:21] manifest and we know the duh a manifold
[1:54:25] wisdom of God
[1:54:27] we know the entire plan that he had
[1:54:31] how many knows that people people don't
[1:54:34] understand predestinate they don't
[1:54:35] understand even where Jesus said the
[1:54:37] world is a field you know and the
[1:54:39] children of the Wicked on Earth
[1:54:43] right and the children of God are the
[1:54:44] wheat he said that's

[1:59:21] God's taking so long because it's going
[1:59:23] to be a big event when it does happen

[1:59:35] prophet was born
[1:59:36] huh but God's long suffering he's not
[1:59:39] going to do it end it real quick
[1:59:41] because it's going to be catastrophic
[1:59:43] when he does
[1:59:45] it's going to be a terrible thing when
[1:59:46] he does

[2:01:12] be a deliverer in him was to be a guide
[2:01:15] in him was to be a warrior
[2:01:18] all these great things that God was and
[2:01:21] he wanted to express himself
[2:01:25] oh let me say this this morning what
[2:01:28] enthuses and what does something to you
[2:01:30] or does something to me is when God
[2:01:33] reveals himself to you on a daily basis
[2:01:38] how many knows that's why you pray
[2:01:40] that's why you seek God
[2:01:42] they that come to God must believe that
[2:01:45] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[2:01:47] that diligently seek him
[2:01:49] God puts that something in you to seek
[2:01:52] him and then he shows himself to you

[2:02:45] your troubles and you come on the other
[2:02:47] side you know him as a deliverer
[2:02:50] but it was revealed to David when he
[2:02:52] slew that lion I don't imagine that he
[2:02:55] just said well you know it's kind of
[2:02:56] nice to see that lying dead
[2:02:58] I imagine he had a lion running around
[2:03:01] the line
[2:03:02] all right God delivered him into my
[2:03:05] hands he is my deliverer
[2:03:09] great big old bear comes
[2:03:11] big old teeth the claws you know
[2:03:14] and I don't know just how he killed him
[2:03:16] but he killed that bear and he had
[2:03:18] another Jubilee thank you God for
[2:03:20] delivering that bear into my hand
[2:03:22] he wasn't so hard for David to believe
[2:03:24] when he got that inspiration
[2:03:29] got down into the Philistines come to
[2:03:31] the Israel bringing his mother's dinners
[2:03:33] and then he looked up at that big old
[2:03:34] giant and says you know I even see
[2:03:36] defying the armies of the Living God and
[2:03:39] so forth
[2:03:40] something struck in David's heart
[2:03:44] why that measly little measly guy up
[2:03:47] there
[2:03:48] he don't look half as bad as the lion
[2:03:49] did he doesn't look as bad as that bear
[2:03:52] did
[2:03:53] these uncircumcised fallacy

[2:04:01] you guys
[2:04:02] little bitty little bitty fella
[2:04:04] huh
[2:04:06] you know
[2:04:10] what how can you let him Define it yeah
[2:04:14] it says I'll do it I'll take him on
[2:04:19] why because he had experience God had
[2:04:22] showed himself to him what makes you
[2:04:24] strong spiritually what gives you faith
[2:04:26] in God
[2:04:28] tribulation Works patience let patience

[2:04:33] entire lacking nothing when you are
[2:04:35] patient on God Amen they can't get over
[2:04:38] somebody can't go under can't go around
[2:04:40] and God take you to say that's
[2:04:43] God God shows me that he's my deliverer
[2:04:48] I don't care what your situation is
[2:04:50] trust God and say get on your knees and
[2:04:53] say God I need the Revelation for that
[2:04:55] she saw me trying to how wonderful how
[2:04:57] great you are
[2:04:58] all right
[2:05:02] don't you think that's exact
[2:05:04] ly exactly what they did on the brother
[2:05:06] man says under when the ears will come
[2:05:08] down to the Red Sea he says you know he
[2:05:10] will God wanted to show them how great
[2:05:12] he was
[2:05:16] huh
[2:05:18] and he still delivered them even though
[2:05:19] they were a bunch of wimps
[2:05:22] cry babies
[2:05:23] complainers
[2:05:26] all right
[2:05:27] he got tired of it though didn't he
[2:05:30] he got tired of it
[2:05:32] after a while they never would believe
[2:05:35] isn't that right
[2:05:37] how many knows that whenever they
[2:05:39] descend out the spies over there and
[2:05:41] they came back and gave a bad report
[2:05:43] that was the last talk Israel and Katie
[2:05:46] spania
[2:05:47] and God says that's it these tens have
[2:05:49] they've been have I tried them and
[2:05:51] proved them these 10 times they have not
[2:05:53] believed me they took them back into the
[2:05:55] Wilderness for 40 years
[2:05:58] till that generation died off and their
[2:06:00] children got to go in
[2:06:02] who wants the parents for once they said
[2:06:04] they wouldn't go in and so forth he got
[2:06:06] tired of it I wonder if God don't get
[2:06:08] tired of our complaining our mermaid
[2:06:12] think about it we're so prone to take
[2:06:15] things in our own hands
[2:06:17] isn't that right
[2:06:19] to deal with things in a carnal level
[2:06:22] now we need to give it to God
[2:06:28] oh I'm a preacher that has witnessed
[2:06:31] this and seen this that when you don't
[2:06:32] trust God don't give it to God you will
[2:06:35] be in chaos
[2:06:37] he'll never be blessed
[2:06:39] [Music]

[2:06:43] give it to God folks

[2:06:48] I'm so glad folks that we have a a
[2:06:51] deliverer who he understood we had
[2:06:52] that's why Revelation is so important
[2:06:56] people haven't had a revelation for
[2:06:59] why they say pray for Revelation Martin
[2:07:01] for God to reveal himself to show
[2:07:04] himself to you
[2:07:06] every one of us could raise her
[2:07:08] and that's what I want more of
[2:07:10] I want to I want God to show himself
[2:07:12] Mighty like he did with brother Benham
[2:07:15] when he was wandering in that woods and
[2:07:17] he but thought that he was a guy and he
[2:07:18] can find his way he can find his way hey
[2:07:21] man he was going round and round and
[2:07:22] round until he got on his knees he says
[2:07:24] I'm lost God I am no God I need you and
[2:07:28] God manifested himself revealed himself
[2:07:30] and opened up that fog and pushed it
[2:07:32] back so he could see the lifeline over
[2:07:34] there that took him right down to the
[2:07:35] cabin just grab all of that life while
[2:07:37] I'm going down that's what we did this
[2:07:39] morning I mean no matter where you are
[2:07:41] what you are amen grab a hold of that
[2:07:43] lifeline

[2:07:52] want him to snatch me right hey man I'm
[2:07:54] Gonna Leave This World one of these days
[2:07:56] when I'm changing the moment and a
[2:07:58] twinkling of an eye
[2:08:00] believing God's gonna do that he's going
[2:08:02] to reveal yourself himself as our
[2:08:04] Rapture person
[2:08:05] the one that comes and steals us away
[2:08:10] I wanted me to reveal himself to me as
[2:08:13] the person amen the great God that he's
[2:08:15] gonna make me ready have me ready

[2:09:00] brother Branham got in that field
[2:09:03] that great big killer bull that had in
[2:09:05] that field because he had killed a black
[2:09:06] man
[2:09:07] and he was out in the middle of nowhere
[2:09:08] there was no trees that bull raised up
[2:09:11] stomped his feet blowed his nose and
[2:09:13] snored it
[2:09:14] I can imagine maybe on a wintery day the
[2:09:16] big old Billows of white smoke
[2:09:21] big mean looking thing and he come
[2:09:23] looked at him he put his head down and
[2:09:25] stopped here I come
[2:09:27] brother man says God help me to die
[2:09:29] don't let me be a coward if this is I'm
[2:09:31] supposed to go don't let me die a coward
[2:09:35] he says something come down over him

[2:09:41] God
[2:09:42] the Great deliver is that right he said
[2:09:46] he had no
[2:09:47] more fear than anything he says you go

[2:09:50] somebody else over here you're God's
[2:09:52] bull you're God's God's creation I need
[2:09:54] you to go back and lay down where you
[2:09:56] come from is that right
[2:09:58] he knew God as a deliverer
[2:10:01] the Hornets from a deliverer the maniac
[2:10:03] that come up isn't that right
[2:10:06] he didn't say hey policeman hey Deacon
[2:10:08] board hey y'all come on up here tackle
[2:10:10] this guy
[2:10:12] huh can you imagine a bunch of stout men
[2:10:16] in the church could probably tackled him
[2:10:17] but he says no he's just come up and he
[2:10:19] talked to him all right
[2:10:22] what did he do
[2:10:23] what did Brother Branham think
[2:10:26] now this is some mama's boy
[2:10:29] is that right this is some mama's boy
[2:10:31] that is loved by his family and so forth
[2:10:34] you know
[2:10:35] had compassion on him
[2:10:37] loved him
[2:10:40] and he said man I'll tell you what you
[2:10:42] know I'm Gonna Knock You Plum out into
[2:10:44] this out of the other and holy spirit
[2:10:45] says because you've challenged the
[2:10:46] spirit of God you're going to fall up my
[2:10:48] feet
[2:10:49] and he did
[2:10:51] he knew God as his deliverer he had done
[2:10:54] busted up some preachers jaws and puts
[2:10:57] put him in the hospital and everything
[2:10:58] else
[2:10:59] amen
[2:11:01] foreign
[2:11:03] that's when God comes young people don't
[2:11:06] you want to know God more you want to
[2:11:08] see God in your life
[2:11:09] trust him
[2:11:12] put your complete faith in him say Lord
[2:11:14] and pray say God reveal yourself to me
[2:11:17] show yourself to me Lord I want to see
[2:11:19] more
[2:11:20] I want to see more of you Lord I want to
[2:11:22] see less of me I mean he's with me I'll
[2:11:25] see less of me and I want to see more of
[2:11:26] him
[2:11:28] amen
[2:11:29] that's the true revelation
[2:11:32] foreign
[2:11:33] true revelation
[2:11:36] how am I
[2:11:38] remember
[2:11:42] that revelation
[2:11:43] the reality of Christ in your life is
[2:11:46] what gives you prevailing power over the
[2:11:50] enemy
[2:11:55] amen
[2:11:56] as I have already said This Book of
[2:11:58] Revelation is the consummation of the
[2:12:00] Scripture it is even placed exactly
[2:12:02] right into Canon of scripture at the end
[2:12:05] now you can know why it says that Anyone
[2:12:08] who reads it or even hears it is blessed
[2:12:11] it is the revelation of God that will
[2:12:14] give you authority over the devil
[2:12:16] I mean please it's the reality of Christ
[2:12:19] in you is what gives you power over the
[2:12:23] devil
[2:12:24] you certainly aren't going to have power
[2:12:26] over the devil if you don't aren't
[2:12:28] Spirit-filled are you with me
[2:12:31] if you're not prayed out and filled with
[2:12:32] the Holy Ghost you're not going to have
[2:12:33] power over today
[2:12:35] amen
[2:12:37] you can see why they who would add or
[2:12:40] take away would be cursed it would have
[2:12:43] been have to be so for who can add or
[2:12:45] take away from the perfect revelation of
[2:12:47] God and overcome the enemy it's that
[2:12:50] simple there is nothing of such
[2:12:52] prevailing power as revelation of the
[2:12:56] word of God
[2:12:59] that's what David trusted he absolutely
[2:13:03] relied on God's ability and for God to
[2:13:07] come and to guide his stone for the
[2:13:09] Goliath just like he did with the bear
[2:13:12] and just like he did with the lion
[2:13:18] us older folks
