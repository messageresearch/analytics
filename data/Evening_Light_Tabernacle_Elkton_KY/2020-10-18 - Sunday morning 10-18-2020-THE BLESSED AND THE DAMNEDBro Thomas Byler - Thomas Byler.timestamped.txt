[42:17] god you would touch him this morning and
[42:18] just raise him up lord jesus
[42:20] give him strength lord jesus this
[42:22] morning father and lord just bless the
[42:24] congregation that's assembled we ask god
[42:26] that you bless the meditation of our
[42:28] heart now
[42:29] the reading of the word now in jesus
[42:30] christ's name amen
[42:32] and amen i had a little thought on my
[42:34] heart last evening as i was just
[42:37] studying and asking god if
[42:39] what he wanted me to speak on and it
[42:41] just didn't seem like
[42:43] you know something didn't click right
[42:45] off the go gator or whatever and so i
[42:46] went to bed last night and
[42:48] said well lord i'm just leaving it in
[42:50] your hands and then i woke up about
[42:52] a little bit before 12 i guess it was
[42:55] and began to think and uh and
[42:58] and i close my eyes again and all of a
[43:00] sudden just
[43:02] some of these thoughts begin to just
[43:03] come to me like it does whenever the
[43:05] lord seems to give me a message and
[43:07] i says well i wonder what time it is and
[43:09] i opened my eyes my eyes and
[43:11] looked at the clock and it was dead
[43:12] midnight 12 o'clock in midnight when
[43:15] and i felt like the lord gave me a
[43:17] minute i said well what is the
[43:18] significance of midnight amen
[43:20] and so amen it's just i've gotten the
[43:23] messages in many different places many
[43:25] different ways but midnight
[43:26] i mean that was a first so amen i
[43:30] perhaps we're at the midnight hour amen
[43:32] how many knows that uh
[43:34] and it'll certainly be a midnight
[43:35] message but way back in the 50s and the
[43:38] 60s brother bram said that even science
[43:40] and
[43:41] scientists and so forth amen are saying
[43:43] that we're like three minutes
[43:44] before midnight amen how many knows at
[43:47] midnight a cry went out behold the
[43:49] bridegroom comes amen
[43:51] and so it is certainly the hour i
[43:54] believe
[43:54] very timely it'll be this morning amen
[43:57] for the message that we have so if you
[43:59] will turn your bibles
[44:01] to mark if you will amen and it'll just
[44:04] take the lord to really put this
[44:05] together
[44:06] amen but i want to speak out of the book
[44:08] of mark
[44:10] and it's a peculiar message actually
[44:12] kind of different
[44:14] but it's certainly uh
[44:18] i believe that it's what the lord would
[44:19] have amen and the title of it is going
[44:22] to be
[44:23] rather different mark the 16th chapter
[44:35] and i want you to kind of imagine this
[44:37] being read
[44:39] perhaps at the white throne judgment
[44:43] amen because how many knows that this
[44:45] bible is what is going to judge the
[44:47] world
[44:48] god is going to use this bible to judge
[44:51] the world by
[44:52] every soul will be judged by the bible
[44:55] amen so
[44:56] whenever uh you know whenever they
[44:59] they read uh in the courthouses and so
[45:03] forth
[45:04] they'll refer to a certain law on a
[45:06] certain page on a certain
[45:08] area and so forth that's what they'll
[45:10] refer to you know and that i believe in
[45:12] the bible
[45:13] god will use the bible to refer amen to
[45:16] make his judgments
[45:17] he'll use it and isn't it quite
[45:19] something how that
[45:22] in our courthouses how many knows that
[45:24] when the judge
[45:25] comes out amen they always say all rise
[45:29] isn't that right and i truly believe it
[45:32] types
[45:33] the great judgment when jesus christ
[45:35] shall call all out of the grave isn't
[45:37] that right
[45:38] he'll call all to rise amen when the
[45:42] judge comes forth to judge the world
[45:44] amen so you know you just you just think
[45:48] about
[45:49] this here i believe what we're about to
[45:51] read will be the judgment of the world
[45:55] okay mark 16 verse 9
[45:58] now when jesus was risen early the first
[46:01] day of the week
[46:02] he appeared first to mary magdalene out
[46:05] of whom he had cast
[46:06] seven devils and she went and told them
[46:09] that had been with him as they mourned
[46:12] and wept and they when they had heard
[46:15] that he was alive
[46:16] and had been seen of her believe not
[46:21] after that he appeared in another form
[46:24] unto the two of them
[46:25] as they walked and went into the country
[46:28] and they went and told it to the residue
[46:31] and neither believed they them
[46:33] afterwards he appeared unto the eleven
[46:36] as they sat
[46:36] at meat and operated them with their
[46:39] unbelief
[46:40] and hardness of heart because they
[46:42] believed not them which had seen him
[46:44] after he was risen and he said unto them
[46:48] go ye into all the world and preach the
[46:51] gospel to every creature
[46:53] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[46:56] be saved and he that believeth not shall
[46:58] be damned
[46:59] and these signs shall follow them that
[47:01] believe in my name they shall cast out
[47:03] devils and they shall speak with new
[47:04] tongues
[47:05] they shall take up serpents and if they
[47:07] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[47:09] them
[47:10] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[47:12] they shall recall cover
[47:14] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[47:16] them
[47:17] he was received up into heaven and sat
[47:20] at the right hand of god
[47:21] and they went forth and preached
[47:23] everywhere the lord working with them
[47:25] and confirming the word
[47:27] with signs following everybody said
[47:32] amen may god has blessings to the
[47:34] reading of the word you can be seated
[47:36] my title this morning is the blessed
[47:40] and the damned the blessed
[47:44] and the damned how many believe there's
[47:48] only two kinds
[47:49] amen and when you think about it this
[47:52] certainly is something that
[47:54] uh god could use in the day great day
[47:57] of judgment because he first of all
[48:00] testified that he had risen you know
[48:03] right
[48:04] in this scripture he testified that god
[48:06] had risen from the dead that jesus had
[48:08] risen from the dead
[48:09] amen and he began to talk a little bit
[48:11] about those that heard it and how they
[48:14] were hard-hearted and
[48:15] really didn't want to believe it but yet
[48:17] he appeared to them
[48:19] even those that couldn't believe it he
[48:21] personally appeared to them
[48:23] and abraded them for their hardness of
[48:25] heart
[48:26] in that and then after he did this he
[48:29] commissioned them
[48:30] to go into all the world and to preach
[48:33] the gospel
[48:35] amen how many believe that's happening
[48:37] this morning
[48:39] to all the world to every generation
[48:41] amen all the way from paul
[48:44] in our day during brenda branham's time
[48:46] we know that there'll be a lot of people
[48:48] that say well the days of miracles is
[48:49] past
[48:50] there's no such a thing as the holy
[48:52] ghost anymore it was just for the 12
[48:54] apostles
[48:54] it was just for this one or for that one
[48:57] but he says you know i'll tell you where
[48:58] he put it in it you show me where he
[49:00] took it out
[49:02] and then where he put it in it it was
[49:03] acts 2 38 they were pricked in their
[49:05] hearts and said men in brethren
[49:07] what shall we do isn't that right he
[49:09] says repent every one of you and be
[49:11] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[49:13] christ
[49:14] for the remission of your sins and you
[49:16] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[49:19] for the promise is to you to your
[49:21] children to them that are far off
[49:23] even as many as the lord our god so call
[49:26] it's going to be good
[49:28] all the way until he leaves that mercy
[49:31] seat amen
[49:32] go and preach the gospel tell them the
[49:34] gospel amen to every creature
[49:37] he that believeth and is baptized
[49:40] amen shall be saved but he that
[49:44] believeth not
[49:44] shall be damned amen now we're
[49:48] going to use that quite a bit this
[49:49] morning but you know in other words for
[49:51] that damn word could be
[49:52] condemnation and amen now let's go to
[49:55] i'm going to go to saint real quick
[49:58] let's just talk about what the gospel is
[50:01] amen what is the gospel the gospel is
[50:03] that jesus christ
[50:05] died for our sins that jesus christ died
[50:09] and he gave his life so that you and i
[50:11] can have eternal life
[50:13] if you believe that you will be blessed
[50:16] but if you don't believe that and don't
[50:18] accept that there's only one place for
[50:21] you
[50:21] and that's damnation amen how many knows
[50:25] that there's
[50:26] only two locations we're either going
[50:28] into the land of heaven which is the
[50:30] land of the blessed
[50:31] or we're going to hell which is the land
[50:34] of the damned
[50:36] the place of the damned amen
[50:40] what a terrible place for people to go
[50:43] john 3 16. this is the gospel that we're
[50:46] going to preach we're to tell them about
[50:47] how that
[50:48] uh you know in john 3 16 how did god so
[50:52] loved the world that he gave his only
[50:54] begotten son that
[50:55] whosoever believeth in him should not
[50:58] perish they should not be damned
[51:02] but have everlasting life for god
[51:05] sent not his son into the world to damn
[51:08] the world
[51:09] or to condemn the world amen how many
[51:12] know that when you are condemned
[51:14] amen they are damning you to death
[51:17] that's right they're condemning you he
[51:19] came not to condemn the world but that
[51:22] the world through him
[51:23] might be saved he that believeth on him
[51:27] is the name of the only begotten
[51:29] son of god and listen to this
[51:32] and this is the damnation or the
[51:35] condemnation
[51:36] okay that light is come into the world
[51:39] all right and men love darkness rather
[51:43] than light because their deeds were evil
[51:47] my so the condemnation comes
[51:50] with not accepting the light that god
[51:53] sends you away
[51:55] now we know that this word of god this
[51:57] is just the reading of the word
[51:59] just that right there just reading that
[52:03] word
[52:04] either sends your soul to hell or take
[52:07] it to heaven that's all god is obligated
[52:09] to give you
[52:10] his word never that's all he has to give
[52:13] you
[52:14] but god does more don't he he shows
[52:18] signs
[52:19] and wonders he sends prophets does
[52:21] miracles and
[52:23] and signs and wonders to get people's
[52:25] attention
[52:26] to make him know hey this really is true
[52:29] amen try to get the people to believe
[52:33] we know that's what signs are for that's
[52:35] what miracles were done that's why
[52:37] uh in our generation brother bam says
[52:38] you know uh
[52:40] these this gift that god has given me of
[52:42] of telling you who you are where you
[52:43] come from what your problem is
[52:45] and the discernment that god comes and
[52:47] does that's really that's just to build
[52:49] your faith
[52:51] that's just to get you to cause of you
[52:53] to believe
[52:54] that jesus really is here
[52:58] that he is really alive that he has
[53:00] resurrected and
[53:01] showed the world that he has resurrected
[53:03] in this generation
[53:05] then it builds their faith to believe
[53:07] well i believe that then they accept and
[53:09] receive what they
[53:10] have need of so god goes to great extent
[53:13] to try to get us to believe is that
[53:16] right
[53:18] because that's the trick right there
[53:19] that's the magic thing is right there is
[53:21] to believe
[53:23] because if you don't believe just
[53:25] because of the fact that you disbelieve
[53:27] the truth
[53:28] you'll be a blessed people we're blessed
[53:32] i want to go to uh go to matthew now
[53:36] and let's talk about the blessed amen
[53:40] how may believe that come on when we
[53:41] think about it a christian
[53:43] a christian that has accepted the lord
[53:46] and this really has to be thought about
[53:47] telling you know i got some good news
[53:48] and some bad news
[53:49] which one do you want to hurt bless it
[53:52] huh blessed are the poor in spirit
[53:56] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[54:00] some people have such a proud spirit
[54:02] such a
[54:03] strong spirit oh you can't tell me you
[54:06] know
[54:07] that's a strong spirit that's not a poor
[54:09] spirit that's not a giving spirit but
[54:11] it's a
[54:12] really terrible spirit to have so he
[54:14] says blessed are the poor in spirit
[54:17] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[54:19] number two
[54:20] verse four once again he says blessed
[54:24] our brother man calls blessed says that
[54:26] blessed means happy
[54:28] right blessed are they that mourn
[54:32] for they shall be comforted amen
[54:36] another place in the bible it talks
[54:38] about over in john i believe it was he
[54:40] interpreted as he says bro
[54:41] he says woe to them that are full now
[54:43] for they shall be empty
[54:46] amen uh 99 verse 5
[54:49] blessed are the meek for they shall
[54:52] inherit the earth
[54:54] amen blood how many believe says you're
[54:56] a blessed person
[54:58] blessed are they which do hunger and
[55:00] thirst after righteousness for
[55:02] they shall be filled the biggest problem
[55:05] today
[55:06] is people do not have a hunger they do
[55:08] not have a thirst
[55:10] you are blessed if you have a hunger and
[55:13] a thirst
[55:14] i've been a christian now for i don't
[55:16] know how many years 30 some odd years
[55:18] the lord has been as good to me until i
[55:20] feel i could need a second person just
[55:21] to fill out and spill up
[55:23] some of the goodness of almighty god but
[55:25] there's still something down on the
[55:27] inside and he says that this world
[55:29] and this life is still not good enough
[55:32] i still want more i want a body that
[55:35] won't get old i want to live in a world
[55:36] where there is no negative
[55:38] there's no bad days and good days i want
[55:40] all good days
[55:42] hello i'm still hungry and i'm
[55:45] self-thirsting there's still something
[55:47] in me
[55:48] that calls for that land beyond the
[55:50] river
[55:53] [Music]
[55:55] anybody with me this morning amen this
[55:58] world is not my home i'm just not
[56:00] content here
[56:00] i love it that i'm here with the lord
[56:02] i'm glad for the comfort of the holy
[56:04] spirit
[56:04] you're a blessed person have you got the
[56:06] comfort of the spirit this morning
[56:08] because the whole world is groping in
[56:11] discomfort
[56:12] this world is totally annoyed people are
[56:15] not happy
[56:19] they don't have a comfort they don't
[56:22] have something to give them a smile
[56:25] but you if you're a christian you're the
[56:28] most blessed person up on the face of
[56:30] the earth
[56:30] our prophet said many times we ought to
[56:32] be the happiest people
[56:34] on the face of the earth
[56:38] god help us come on folks let's admit it
[56:43] i know you know why we're not as happy
[56:45] as we should i'm gonna just
[56:47] i can say this of the lord the reason
[56:49] we're not as happy as we should be
[56:51] is because we're still too bogged down
[56:54] with the things of this world
[56:57] that's why we're not as happy as what we
[56:59] should be you realize you would probably
[57:01] be happier with less than what you got
[57:05] because we constantly think we got to
[57:07] have more amen it doesn't bring more joy
[57:10] hello this brings you joy
[57:14] knowing where you're going brings you
[57:15] joy knowing who you are
[57:17] brings you joy it brings you peace
[57:20] amen oh my praise the lord
[57:24] blessed are they merciful for they shall
[57:26] obtain mercy
[57:28] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[57:30] shall see god
[57:32] oh my i should use happy every time
[57:35] happy are the peacemakers for they shall
[57:38] be called the children of god
[57:39] and happy are they which are persecuted
[57:42] for righteousness sake
[57:44] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[57:46] blessed are ye
[57:47] when men shall revile you and persecute
[57:50] you
[57:50] and say all men are of evil against you
[57:53] for my sake
[57:54] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[57:59] hallelujah i don't know about you but if
[58:02] he would have said look
[58:03] if people are persecuting you and if
[58:05] people are hey man dear
[58:07] reviling you and saying bad things about
[58:10] you you could just know one thing you're
[58:11] not on the right path
[58:13] and you need to be very sad
[58:16] if it said it that way if people
[58:18] persecuted me hey man it said bad things
[58:21] i would be like oh boy
[58:23] the bible says i better be sad huh
[58:27] you know the bible actually sells sis
[58:29] the opposite
[58:30] one place he says what one to you when
[58:32] all men speak eat i mean it's good of
[58:34] you
[58:36] huh because so did they the false
[58:38] prophets
[58:39] when you're a false prophet oh you're
[58:41] really a fine guy
[58:44] but you take the height off of people
[58:46] and you tell us how it is
[58:48] and huh didn't like you so well
[58:52] let me tell you something so i mean
[58:55] stephen he preached the gospel to the
[58:57] pharisees until they got so mad they
[58:59] stoned him to death
[59:01] they didn't like him they didn't labor
[59:03] reviled them they hated him they
[59:04] murdered him
[59:06] they persecuted him but when they're
[59:08] persecuted when you
[59:09] suffer because of the righteousness that
[59:12] you're doing
[59:13] amen you fit right in this category and
[59:15] you say well praise be to god i'm on the
[59:17] right path
[59:18] praise be to god that i'm worthy to
[59:20] suffer for the man that suffered for me
[59:24] praise be to god because life christian
[59:26] life is not all joy
[59:28] it's not all uh no tribulation no
[59:30] persecution but it is in the midst of
[59:33] all of that
[59:34] you have the joy and the peace of god in
[59:36] your heart
[59:38] amen praise be to god
[59:44] oh my i don't know why
[59:47] we don't think that you're not blessed
[59:49] how many believes that you're blessed
[59:52] you're a blessed person a person
[59:56] oh my all right that's right
[1:00:00] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[1:00:02] great is your reward in heaven
[1:00:04] for so persecuted they the prophets that
[1:00:07] were before you
[1:00:09] you are the salt of the earth
[1:00:13] praise be to god over in matthew 13
[1:00:17] there's some more blessings that comes
[1:00:18] along with the believer those who accept
[1:00:20] christ
[1:00:21] those who receive what he said one place
[1:00:23] he said amen he says blessed
[1:00:25] are those who are not offended in my
[1:00:28] word
[1:00:29] i mean it means it's a blessing when
[1:00:31] you're not offended because of something
[1:00:33] that jesus said
[1:00:36] any part of the bible when it does not
[1:00:38] offend you
[1:00:39] you're a blessed person amen
[1:00:43] because most of the time a lot of places
[1:00:45] people are offended
[1:00:46] because of the word oh
[1:00:50] it condemns me you're offended
[1:00:53] no it shouldn't condemn you it should
[1:00:55] bless you
[1:00:57] amen and this is a very familiar
[1:01:00] scripture with us i think i read it last
[1:01:02] sunday
[1:01:03] it talks about it talks about isaiah
[1:01:05] prophesied of these people
[1:01:07] how did they would have hearing and they
[1:01:08] shall not hear they shall
[1:01:10] not underst even though they hear they
[1:01:11] shall not understanding
[1:01:13] seeing they see but they don't get it
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:17] amen because their heart is wax gross
[1:01:20] their ears are dull of hearing in their
[1:01:22] eyes if they close at least at any time
[1:01:24] i should see that
[1:01:25] they should see with their eyes and hear
[1:01:27] with their ears and should understand
[1:01:28] with their heart
[1:01:29] and should be converted and i should
[1:01:31] heal them
[1:01:33] but blessed are your eyes
[1:01:36] for they see in your ears for they hear
[1:01:41] amen praise the lord how many how many
[1:01:45] has blessed
[1:01:46] ears you have blessed eyes when you can
[1:01:49] see the truth
[1:01:50] and when you can receive the truth in
[1:01:52] your heart
[1:01:53] you're a blessed person why because
[1:01:56] you're in the category of those that are
[1:01:58] believers and that are blessed
[1:02:00] not in the category of the damned
[1:02:03] and the condemned praise be to god
[1:02:09] oh my this kind of stuff ought to make
[1:02:11] us run around the aisles
[1:02:14] it just don't mean enough for it you
[1:02:16] know if i if i
[1:02:17] tell you what we don't get excited about
[1:02:19] things like we should but if i come back

[1:02:44] loved one you know yesterday i guess

[1:02:50] no it's going to do something it's going
[1:02:52] to propel our faith
[1:02:54] it is going to be something amen you
[1:02:55] talk about peter when he heard that
[1:02:57] jesus christ rose from the dead
[1:02:58] and then they ran they went they're
[1:03:00] running i believe there's going to be
[1:03:02] some running going on pretty soon
[1:03:04] when we see our loved ones appearing
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:07] when we begin to see the dead in christ
[1:03:09] rising first
[1:03:10] we see him amen like abraham went into
[1:03:13] the city and showed himself they saw and
[1:03:15] they saw
[1:03:16] jesus amen it's going to be a whole lot
[1:03:18] of excitement going on
[1:03:20] unless you're tied to this world so much
[1:03:22] that you don't want to go yet
[1:03:24] huh how many believe this should mean
[1:03:28] everything to us blessed are your eyes
[1:03:30] for this e blessed are your ears that
[1:03:32] they can receive it
[1:03:34] because how many knows not everybody can
[1:03:35] accept it not everybody receives it
[1:03:38] amen let's look at
[1:03:42] look at it for just a minute amen so we
[1:03:44] find brothers and sisters that the
[1:03:45] gospel preached just the fact that jesus
[1:03:47] christ came to save the whole world
[1:03:49] amen and that's really all he has to
[1:03:50] read really in the judgment that's all
[1:03:53] he'll have to read
[1:03:54] that he rose from the dead that he said
[1:03:56] to go preach the gospel
[1:03:58] he don't believe us shall be saved he
[1:04:00] that believeth not shall be that that's
[1:04:01] what i said did you believe it that's
[1:04:03] all he has to ask
[1:04:04] did you believe it
[1:04:09] no well then you know the alternative
[1:04:13] you got a choice you had a choice
[1:04:17] did you want to believe it or did you
[1:04:19] want to be damned
[1:04:21] huh pretty strong man
[1:04:25] but that's the truth that's how it'll be
[1:04:29] amen god so loved the world that he gave
[1:04:31] his only begotten son that whoever
[1:04:33] believes in him should not perish
[1:04:35] it didn't say jews gentiles blacks
[1:04:38] whites it didn't say anybody
[1:04:39] any colorado whosoever
[1:04:43] brother bam said he would i would rather
[1:04:45] he said that than say you know if
[1:04:46] brother branham if
[1:04:47] william bram or if you're put your name
[1:04:49] if you if you believe
[1:04:51] you'll be saved if thomas byler will
[1:04:54] believe he'll be saved no
[1:04:55] there's a lot of thomas spiders it might
[1:04:57] not be me
[1:04:59] but he says whosoever will well i can
[1:05:01] put myself in there
[1:05:03] whosoever believeth shall be saved
[1:05:06] he believeth not shall be
[1:05:10] damned period amen
[1:05:15] and that my friends is why brother bam
[1:05:16] says committing adultery smoking
[1:05:18] cursing all that stuff he says that's
[1:05:22] not sin
[1:05:23] that's not sin that's attributes
[1:05:27] of not believing because if you truly
[1:05:30] believed
[1:05:31] amen you wouldn't do those things he
[1:05:33] says you'll not be condemned for all
[1:05:35] that you'll be condemned because you
[1:05:36] didn't
[1:05:38] believe because your belief would have
[1:05:41] taken care of all that
[1:05:42] amen how many believes they would have
[1:05:43] taken care of all that and then it is
[1:05:46] the disbelief
[1:05:47] because of the disbelief because of what
[1:05:49] he did because he
[1:05:50] they have not believed this is a
[1:05:52] condemnation let me read it again
[1:05:57] before i go over into this area this is
[1:05:59] the condemnation that light
[1:06:02] is coming to the world and men love
[1:06:04] darkness rather than life
[1:06:08] all right
[1:06:11] and also verse 18 he that believeth on
[1:06:13] him is not condemned but he that
[1:06:14] believeth not
[1:06:15] is condemned already because he has not
[1:06:18] believed
[1:06:19] in the name of the son of god god said
[1:06:22] it
[1:06:22] you didn't believe it and he says if you
[1:06:24] don't you'll be condemned
[1:06:27] amen now how many believes that each one
[1:06:30] of us
[1:06:31] in our daily lives in the way that we
[1:06:33] live we live
[1:06:35] either by the blessings of god or you
[1:06:38] live
[1:06:38] by condemnation and damnation
[1:06:42] either the blessing of god is on you or
[1:06:44] the curse of god
[1:06:46] is on you how many knows the way of a
[1:06:49] transgressor
[1:06:50] is hard i'll talk to you about two
[1:06:53] classes of people this morning that is
[1:06:55] people that actually serve god
[1:06:57] amen have a covenant with god and
[1:06:58] backslide on god
[1:07:00] and those are actually foreordained like
[1:07:02] pharaoh was
[1:07:03] and like judas was all right
[1:07:06] that were before ordained unto
[1:07:09] condemnation
[1:07:11] right because god knows all things isn't
[1:07:14] that right
[1:07:15] let's go back into deuteronomy let's
[1:07:17] look at the blessings
[1:07:18] and the cursings of god
[1:07:22] now i'm going to do a bit of reading
[1:07:23] this morning is that okay
[1:07:25] i want you to follow with me and then
[1:07:28] whenever it sells
[1:07:29] and the people say amen i want you all
[1:07:31] to amen we're going to work on our amens
[1:07:33] this morning is that all right
[1:07:35] this is to show you that god does
[1:07:37] believe in the congregation
[1:07:39] saying amen all right now moses in the
[1:07:42] 27th chapter i just want to read the
[1:07:44] first three verses before i jump all the
[1:07:46] way down to
[1:07:46] uh verse 14. and moses with the elders
[1:07:49] of israel commanded the people saying
[1:07:51] keep all the commandments which i
[1:07:52] command you this day
[1:07:54] and it shall be on the day when ye pass
[1:07:57] over jordan
[1:07:58] unto the lamb which the lord thy god
[1:07:59] giveth thee that thou shalt set thee
[1:08:02] up great stones and plaster them with
[1:08:05] plaster
[1:08:06] and thou shalt write upon them all the
[1:08:08] words of this law
[1:08:10] when thou art passed over the thou
[1:08:13] mayest go
[1:08:13] in unto the land which the lord thy god
[1:08:17] giveth thee a lamb that floweth with
[1:08:19] milk and honey
[1:08:20] praise the lord now let me ask somebody
[1:08:23] this morning class
[1:08:24] tell me what our promised land is this
[1:08:27] morning
[1:08:32] the holy ghost is the correct answer the
[1:08:34] holy spirit
[1:08:36] for the promise is unto you the promised
[1:08:40] land it's unto you the holy ghost you
[1:08:41] shall receive the holy ghost
[1:08:43] amen the promise is to you to your
[1:08:44] children to them that are off
[1:08:46] of even as many as the lord our god
[1:08:49] shall call amen invented men have not
[1:08:51] the spirit of god
[1:08:52] he is none of his amen so our promised
[1:08:55] land
[1:08:55] our land of milk and honey is the holy
[1:08:59] ghost
[1:09:00] how many believe that it's a beautiful
[1:09:03] land
[1:09:04] full of huge fruits
[1:09:08] how many believes in this land there's
[1:09:10] some big fruit just like when they came
[1:09:12] back with them grapes
[1:09:13] they were so big it took men on six and
[1:09:16] two and so forth
[1:09:17] just to carry one cluster of grapes took
[1:09:19] two guys you know
[1:09:21] hey man you could probably go into the
[1:09:24] on the table and cut one up and
[1:09:25] everybody gets a good little
[1:09:27] part of that one little clump one grape
[1:09:29] will probably go a long way
[1:09:31] and our land is full of milk and honey
[1:09:34] it has got great
[1:09:35] great wonderful fruit on it amen
[1:09:39] amen what kind of fruit is it
[1:09:46] what kind of fruit now the fruit of the
[1:09:48] spirit is
[1:09:50] love joy peace
[1:09:54] amen long-suffering gentleness one of it
[1:09:56] is what joy
[1:09:57] joy bible says that we have joy
[1:10:00] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:10:03] we've got the peace that passes
[1:10:06] understanding down in our heart
[1:10:08] all of these great joys and great fruit
[1:10:11] that comes with this
[1:10:12] but the devil wants to rob you of it
[1:10:14] isn't that right
[1:10:16] and one what happens when you get away
[1:10:18] from the holy ghost
[1:10:20] what happens you get a little lose your
[1:10:23] joy
[1:10:24] you lose your peace now i'll tell you
[1:10:26] what kind of a miserable person you're
[1:10:28] going to be here in a minute okay

[1:10:30] a minute and we're going to talk about
[1:10:31] the blessings
[1:10:32] and then we're going to get back on the
[1:10:33] cursings of god and then i'll show you
[1:10:36] that it's not just in the old testament
[1:10:38] but i'll bring it into the new testament

[1:10:49] them

[1:10:53] passes over the thou mayest go in unto
[1:10:55] the language that lord thy god giveth
[1:10:57] thee a land that flows with milk and
[1:10:59] honey

[1:31:20] story
[1:31:20] but i told you i want to go over to the
[1:31:22] new testament how does this apply
[1:31:24] how does this come into the new
[1:31:25] testament amen let's turn with me
[1:31:27] let's look at paul for just a minute
[1:31:30] amen what paul said over in romans
[1:31:33] let's see how this applies amen today
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:42] and before i get to the point i want to
[1:31:43] first of all
[1:31:45] we'll read in chapter one
[1:31:48] in verse 20 we'll begin to read and this
[1:31:51] is about people that actually knew god
[1:31:53] they see god in creation and so forth
[1:31:56] but they glorified him not as god and
[1:31:58] became vain
[1:32:01] for the invisible things verse 20 romans
[1:32:03] 1
[1:32:04] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:32:06] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:32:08] being understood by the things that are
[1:32:09] made
[1:32:11] amen in other words you can just look
[1:32:13] around and know there's got
[1:32:14] to be a god
[1:32:18] the moon the stars all of those heaven
[1:32:21] and keeping all their place
[1:32:23] that just can't be by chance
[1:32:27] that he had divine power working over it
[1:32:30] isn't that right period
[1:32:33] what was it einstein but the man says
[1:32:35] that came to the conclusion of the
[1:32:36] matter
[1:32:37] in the beginning god created amen that
[1:32:40] he
[1:32:40] actually made it all that's what
[1:32:42] einstein came to the conclusion of
[1:32:44] or was it it wasn't it wasn't in the
[1:32:46] beginning it was by faith
[1:32:47] we understand the worlds were created
[1:32:49] there's something over there in hebrews
[1:32:50] i believe he quoted
[1:32:52] that was the only explanation for the
[1:32:53] world smart as he was
[1:32:56] amen that that's the smart thing that i
[1:32:58] know of that he ever said
[1:33:00] even his eternal power and godhead so
[1:33:02] that they are without
[1:33:03] excuse i gotta stop there for a minute
[1:33:09] but god i never could see i never knew
[1:33:11] anything what did you see the sun
[1:33:13] did you see the moon did it come up

[1:33:22] you there's a god
[1:33:25] i mean i put you right on time in the
[1:33:26] middle of my creation
[1:33:28] you know and made it impossible for you
[1:33:30] not to know that there's got to be a
[1:33:32] higher power that's governing these
[1:33:34] things
[1:33:35] amen and then people want to say it was
[1:33:39] some kind of a big bang theory or it was
[1:33:41] evolution
[1:33:42] huh oh i can hear him have a good good
[1:33:45] judgment on that
[1:33:47] can't you but because that when they
[1:33:50] knew god
[1:33:51] they glorified him not as god and
[1:33:53] neither were
[1:33:54] thankful folks i'm here to tell you if
[1:33:56] once you start beginning to lose your
[1:33:58] thankfulness of god
[1:34:00] you begin to lose god amen
[1:34:03] amen but became vain in their
[1:34:05] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:34:08] darkened
[1:34:09] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:34:11] became fools in other words they began
[1:34:13] the thinking that they were smart
[1:34:15] and as the smarter they thought they
[1:34:16] were the more of a fool they become and
[1:34:19] boy
[1:34:19] i'm here to tell you right now if that
[1:34:21] isn't our government and those who
[1:34:24] don't know what sex they come from and
[1:34:25] everything else they claim to be so
[1:34:27] smart
[1:34:28] they're showing themselves to be fools
[1:34:32] the bible says a man that says there is
[1:34:33] no god is a fool
[1:34:37] all right change the glory of the
[1:34:39] corruptable
[1:34:40] uncorruptable god into an image like
[1:34:43] unto corruptable man and of birds and
[1:34:45] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[1:34:48] wherever god also gave them up to
[1:34:50] uncleanness
[1:34:52] through the lusts of their own hearts to
[1:34:54] dishonor their own bodies between
[1:34:56] themselves who changed the truth of god
[1:34:58] into a lie
[1:35:00] amen and worshiped and served the
[1:35:04] creature more than the creator who is
[1:35:06] blessed forever
[1:35:08] go ahead amen see folks
[1:35:11] i know how many knows america was once a
[1:35:14] christian nation based on christian
[1:35:16] principles
[1:35:17] and when you turn your back on god what
[1:35:20] happens
[1:35:21] every curse in the book comes upon you
[1:35:24] that's what you and i are seeing we're
[1:35:25] seeing every curse in the book
[1:35:27] coming upon america they could try to
[1:35:29] fix it the best they can they'll never
[1:35:31] fix it
[1:35:32] god's curse is upon it until the fire is
[1:35:35] going to fall from the skies and burn it
[1:35:37] up
[1:35:38] oh my and for this cause god gave
[1:35:42] them up unto vile if
[1:35:45] not acceptable affections but violent
[1:35:49] affections for even their women to
[1:35:51] change the natural use
[1:35:53] into that which is against nature and
[1:35:56] likewise also the men leaving the
[1:35:58] natural use of the woman
[1:35:59] burned in their lusts one towards
[1:36:02] another
[1:36:03] men with men working that which is not
[1:36:05] seemly it's
[1:36:06] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[1:36:09] that recompense of reward
[1:36:11] error which was meat and even as they
[1:36:14] did not like to retain god in their
[1:36:15] knowledge god gave them over to a
[1:36:18] repropate minds
[1:36:21] amen you have lost your mind
[1:36:26] yes you are crazy
[1:36:29] huh that's exactly the truth a reprobate
[1:36:32] mind
[1:36:33] to those to do those things which are
[1:36:35] not
[1:36:36] convenient being filled with all
[1:36:39] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[1:36:42] covetousness
[1:36:43] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[1:36:45] deceit malignant

[1:36:49] congress and somebody probably want to
[1:36:51] shoot you
[1:36:53] it's exactly right they would hate you
[1:36:55] with a passion for just reading god's
[1:36:57] word
[1:36:59] amen backbiters haters
[1:37:02] of god despiteful proud boasters
[1:37:05] inventors of evil things
[1:37:09] disobedient to parents without
[1:37:11] understanding covenant breakers
[1:37:13] without natural affection implacable
[1:37:16] unmerciful
[1:37:17] who knowing the judgment of god the day
[1:37:19] which commits
[1:37:20] such things are worthy of death
[1:37:24] that's what paul said people that are
[1:37:26] like that are worthy
[1:37:28] of death
[1:37:32] not only do the same but have pleasure
[1:37:34] in them that do them
[1:37:36] amen let's go down to verse let's say uh
[1:37:40] it's verse six listen who will render
[1:37:44] unto every man according to his deeds
[1:37:46] to them who by patient continuance in
[1:37:49] well-doing
[1:37:50] seek for glory and honor and immortality
[1:37:54] in eternal life that's what you and i do
[1:37:57] isn't that right
[1:37:58] now here's where it brings over into the
[1:38:00] new testament
[1:38:01] but unto them that are contentious and

[1:38:51] to every man that worketh good to the
[1:38:54] jew first

[1:39:24] even to serpency the devil's own son
[1:39:27] cain the wicked one who's not the wicked
[1:39:29] one amen the bible says that he had no
[1:39:31] respect to persons he gave him that
[1:39:33] opportunity

[1:39:40] even the nations he says he's no
[1:39:43] respecter if they do

[1:39:58] many knows that paul
[1:40:01] i mean saul saul he was chosen to be the
[1:40:04] leader
[1:40:05] of israel and what happened when he
[1:40:07] disobeyed the commandment of god
[1:40:09] god had told him to go into that city
[1:40:12] and utterly destroy everything
[1:40:15] don't take anything don't leave man one
[1:40:18] woman or child alive
[1:40:19] is that right and i believe it was
[1:40:21] either a.i or one of those
[1:40:24] kings said it was and he had taken the
[1:40:26] kings alive and i'm
[1:40:28] i'm thinking that samuel or one of them

[1:40:41] us god said not to do this nothing why
[1:40:43] is it still in life
[1:40:45] huh amen and because of that
[1:40:48] god allowed a spirit to come upon us all
[1:40:50] that what
[1:40:51] tormented infects his soul
[1:40:57] and he would have to have people
[1:41:00] nowadays have
[1:41:02] to drink or smoke or something to calm
[1:41:05] their nerves because of the
[1:41:06] vexation and the anguish that's in their
[1:41:08] hearts and in their souls because they
[1:41:10] don't have god

[1:41:14] and not the blessing of god they're
[1:41:17] living under condemnation people are

[1:43:34] we've seen broken up
[1:43:36] you know that says you know i said it's
[1:43:38] so much selfishness nowadays

[1:43:45] are selfish

[1:44:10] and one more one more group
[1:44:14] and we want to talk about the regions
[1:44:17] actually the regions of the damned
[1:44:19] how many knows that there's a place that
[1:44:21] when you die if you're not a christian
[1:44:22] that you go into a place of torment
[1:44:25] it's not a place that you burn but it's
[1:44:27] a place like a nightmare where you get
[1:44:29] stuck in there you're
[1:44:30] in the realms of the damned amen
[1:44:39] and there's actually verse 4 of
[1:44:43] jude let's just begin reading in verse
[1:44:45] 4. for there are certain men crept in
[1:44:48] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:44:50] to this condemnation
[1:44:52] my now there the bible talks about
[1:44:55] people actually being ordained
[1:44:57] to condemnation we know that is because
[1:45:01] god knew what they would do to begin
[1:45:03] with
[1:45:04] romans the 8th or 9th chapter he talks
[1:45:06] about
[1:45:07] pharaoh for this reason have i raised
[1:45:09] you up that i might show
[1:45:11] forth my power in thee amen
[1:45:14] ungodly men turning the grace of our
[1:45:18] lord
[1:45:19] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[1:45:22] lord god in other words to turn away
[1:45:24] from
[1:45:25] and our lord jesus christ therefore i
[1:45:27] will put you in remembrance
[1:45:29] though you once do this how did the lord
[1:45:30] having saved the people out of
[1:45:32] the land of egypt afterwards destroyed
[1:45:35] them
[1:45:36] that believed not
[1:45:39] how many knows every one of those
[1:45:41] israelites were out there in that
[1:45:42] wilderness wandering until they died
[1:45:44] because they would not believe all the
[1:45:45] miracles
[1:45:46] they would not be he couldn't get him to
[1:45:48] believe god couldn't get him to believe
[1:45:50] amen and also the angels which kept not
[1:45:54] their first step
[1:45:55] estate but left their own habitation
[1:45:57] that was
[1:45:58] open heaven i believe it was he had
[1:46:00] reserved in everlasting chains
[1:46:03] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[1:46:06] great day
[1:46:07] even sodom and gomorrah and the cities
[1:46:08] round about them giving themselves over
[1:46:11] the fornication
[1:46:13] going after strange flesh are set forth
[1:46:16] for example
[1:46:16] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire
[1:46:19] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:46:21] defile the
[1:46:22] flesh they despise dominion they speak
[1:46:24] evil of dignities
[1:46:26] yet michael the archangel when
[1:46:28] contending with the devil he disputed
[1:46:30] about the body of moses
[1:46:32] thirst not bring against him a railing
[1:46:34] accusation said the lord rebuked you
[1:46:37] but these speak evil of things they do
[1:46:39] not but what they know naturally is root
[1:46:41] beasts
[1:46:42] indo things they corrupt themselves woe
[1:46:45] unto them
[1:46:45] for they have gone in the way of cain
[1:46:49] they have ran greedily after the heir of
[1:46:52] balaam
[1:46:53] amen people that did not believe
[1:46:56] people that did not follow god's rules
[1:46:58] and laws one of them was cain
[1:47:00] one was balaam what happened with balaam
[1:47:03] amen and
[1:47:04] dathan and korra being swallowed up
[1:47:06] alive amen
[1:47:08] perish in the game saying of course
[1:47:10] these are spots in your feasts of
[1:47:12] charity when they feast with you feeding
[1:47:14] themselves without fear
[1:47:15] clouds they are without water carried
[1:47:17] about with winds
[1:47:18] trees whose fruit withered without fruit
[1:47:22] twice dead plucked up by the roots
[1:47:25] raging waves of the sea foaming out
[1:47:27] their own shame their wandering stars
[1:47:29] who
[1:47:30] to whom is reserved the blackness
[1:47:34] of darkness forever
[1:47:38] and enoch also the seventh from adam
[1:47:40] prophesied of thee saying behold
[1:47:42] the lord cometh with ten thousands of
[1:47:44] his saints
[1:47:45] to execute judgment upon all and to
[1:47:48] convince
[1:47:49] all that are ungodly among them of all
[1:47:51] their ungodly deeds
[1:47:54] which they have ungodly committed and of
[1:47:56] all their heart speeches which ungodly
[1:47:58] sinners have spoken
[1:47:59] against him these are murmurs
[1:48:01] complainers
[1:48:02] walking after their own flesh lust and
[1:48:05] their mouth speaketh great swelling
[1:48:06] words
[1:48:07] having immense persons in admiration
[1:48:09] because of advantage
[1:48:11] but beloved remember ye the words which
[1:48:13] were spoken before the apostle of our
[1:48:15] lord jesus christ
[1:48:16] how did they told you there would be
[1:48:18] mockers in the last times who would walk
[1:48:21] after their own ungodly lust peace be
[1:48:24] they who separate themselves sensual and
[1:48:26] not having the spirit
[1:48:27] but ye beloved i like this part building
[1:48:31] up yourselves
[1:48:32] in your most holy faith praying in the
[1:48:35] holy ghost

[1:48:38] for the mercy
[1:48:40] of our lord jesus christ unto eternal
[1:48:43] life
[1:48:44] and if some have compassion making a
[1:48:45] difference and others save with fear
[1:48:48] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[1:48:50] the
[1:48:51] spotted garments spotted by the flesh
[1:48:54] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:48:56] from falling and to present you
