========================================

so and thy salvation oh how greatly shall he rejoice i hope you've all had a good weekend god has blessed you all and i thought i'd put it in here maybe i didn't put it in there this morning yeah i got it right here i was sitting in my office this morning and me 25 years 20 years but i was just um you know this is basically the sunday of the year when we come back again it'll be the first of january and we'll be going into 2022. all our whole expectations for this year will be over some just last night and i was reading something read i'll be all over the plate again like i say but uh i'm gonna go and start it about the um we all know in the third chapter after a second timothy we know first eight verses maybe the first nine verses but uh all started about the ninth verse says but they shall proceed no further for their father shall be manifested unto all men as there also was but paul goes three these this uh afterwards was the off call hundreds of people off to rome as you know i am an irishman my people before me were all castle i wanted the word you know being raised that that's the kind of thing in catechism is that above all and that's not the truth there the word has inspired all of it but the church is over the world that's wrong the protestants say this is inspired as much as i believe in it to be inspired see that a lot i especially bring them you try to bring them a little higher and then they see the world i might not be able to make but my faith may be too weak to me it was in the beginning the word is or now is there one i'll just finish with that quote but the thing that's going to make you successful in the coming year uh i i don't have any revelation the scripture will think in the game better if you hope it's going to get better then that's but uh god's place in church this year i'd be honest with you as we listen without hope hey man you're loving with all your heart this morning mark this morning let's stand [Music] [Music] i'm so glad you came to say that [Music] from the earth [Music] he told me he wasn't going to be here today they were glad they was able to make it but i mean it's just good to see one this song come on my heart foreign [Music] ah [Music] hey oh [Music] [Music] in jesus you're glad he was 10 morning i mean brother daniel and carson brother brian you couldn't pick up the off brother josh and sister he were flying come home yesterday or tomorrow and also uh for the mexican distribution the girls would be his wife they had a little girl i believe she's born wednesday thursday and she didn't runs red river and we just want to remember them in prayer this morning [Music] you see [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] can be seated again notice when they load the star which they saw in the east went before the sudden they saw the sour a young child was and when they saw this are they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were commented into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and at christ at jesus and that as being a king right because truth is how many believes he's the king even up above him when they crucified he said they put up there that said the king of the jews the kingdoms of the world and the kingdom of god the kingdom of satan and so forth only right way to do something is having a king because he said democracies is sales and no anchor boy god it's not that way with god he's the one the atmosphere of every home is dominated by the time i believe i and over in i'm going to go ahead and turn to this just so you'll know it's the truth but in revelations 1 and verse 3 from jesus christ who is the yes and the first begotten from the dead and only it's waiting for loneliness to second chapter i believe second sentence about only he who now led god is just back because he really paid for it amen and the devil has no more right on you folks think about it he can't do anything you outside of permission boy because i'm here to tell you if you're not in the kingdom of god the devil can man he can paint you up put all kinds of nose rings on you and the devil why because you know you're not gods yet that's why you're still out that west why we did everything in the world man aren't you all right let's look at the power of god let's look at the authority where jesus is when he raised in france it talks about that he was given in power i mean he believes he is above every principle he is above every government he is above every power there is out there and dominion that's why he's the king of kings ruler of rulers lord of lords right i believe brother baby says you know the weakest christian if you are in christ every devil every power every dominion is where it's under your feet folks this is almost bigger than we can grasp this morning how many knows death is on this morning all right that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over some things say it with me all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all oh my i was gonna stop but i'm just gonna take my time this morning is that okay notice when he raised when god raised him from the dead when jesus was from the dead he is ended on high and gave gifts to men he went above the star to be the messenger of the age when he was over there and when he was caught up in that visa you know whatever it was that morning up above his bed and he looked back at his past house body said do i have to go back to that and after all of that he's seen the millions of people that he saw that were over there in that dimension he says but i want to see him what did he say you can't see him yet highest dimension that there is nothing yet well has he done even he said what evil has he done and they couldn't answer he says crucify him crucified let's get rid of just crucified i mean those israel killed their king they crucified their king and because of what he they did to jesus a lot of people don't like the jews you know they just don't like them because prejudice because it comes in isn't that right how many knows the day will come after the bride of jesus christ leaves the earth after the rapture takes place there will be two prophets come to israel moses and elijah and they'll shut up the skies and it don't rain can you imagine a world without rain without food they cause all kinds of troubles to do everything they use they can bring free fries they can bring curses however they want to and they will preach the gospel of jesus christ because now most jews when you tell them about christ they just say he was a good man they don't acknowledge him as being the messiah they just can't see it and see him be a messiah but the bible says that one of these eyes their eyes will be opened and with clouds and they will cry like a parent that has lost their only child they will weep they will weep and they will weep they will cry and they will accept the lord and what he did and 144 000 people will be saved in this single day isn't that right 144 000 and they'll go weeping because they realize that was their lord that they killed that was their king amen all right let's take a few scriptures now if we can 7 18. now notice after the temptation with the devil on the mountain and all of these and overcoming him and so forth john the baptist now haven't been put into prison and so forth him going into the temple and saying a few things in verse 16 he says he reads where it says the people which sat in darkness saw great light and that to them which sat in the regions of the shadow of death light is sprung up from that time now this is the beginning from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at earth i mean there's a beginning of a kingdom he was going to build a kingdom because if god is going to one day one one day he's going to come and take over all these kingdoms somebody knows that he's going to take over all the kingdoms of the world he's going to clean the earth off and what he's beginning to do is to bring to create subjects for that kingdom because like i said a while ago eda had a mess if he came and tried to rule a bunch of carnal people huh because he tried through moses didn't he look at the mess that he had only two out of two million they keep rebelling they keep going back i'm gonna say something kind of strong and if he was there tell me why because of their nature come on folks if that don't tell you that you gotta be born again to be a christian nothing will it's in your nature to be evil it you can't fight your nature praise lord we can do some pretty good reforming but it really don't change it we need to have a change that's what god that's what he's doing amen praise be to god actually glad it's something different than your my i'm not bringing in you today this is when god brings you into there [Applause] god brings you into a whole new world makes you a different person that's scallywag lying cheap stealing oh that's all by the wayside gotta change all that it's scary god isn't going to make you rule anything if i be of god if i'm according to the word amen see where that'll lead you amen all right so the kingdom of god 4 17 i believe it is and then matthew 11 and 12 matthew 11. the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence when we talk about a king we would expect him to rule i mean you know but you know this is this is how jesus explains it when he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation huh in other words you don't see it with your eyes neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is amen how many please it's in you that's where the kingdom of god is it's inside of us [Music] aren't you glad that the devil doesn't rule anymore aren't you glad the holy ghost rules on that heart now he's king oh my i'm not sure what that woman's name is but i love that song she sings you are my king you are my i can't sing like a woman i better go for a man you are my king amen aren't you glad he's your king i thought it's a beautiful song hallelujah it don't come with observation but it's within you that's where the kingdom of god is another place it says she eat first the kingdom of god and his righteousness because that's what god's got to do he's got to make subjects fit to rule he's got to get us ready for that kingdom before we see the natural kingdom we got to have the spiritual kingdom taken care of that's right god don't want to rule over a bunch of sinners [Applause] i'll tell you this as a pastor i don't like to pastor a bunch of goats out they were out there shopping somewhere and they seen a woman out there in the middle of the winter with shorts on and the wife says you know that can't be comfortable you know she says why do they do that that's because they're americans right they can do that you can go out there dress any old way how many knows our rules and our laws and our king is above civil laws why because they let you drink they let you smoke they let you commit adultery they let you divorce without a problem hey you want a divorce you don't have to have an excuse even todd county remember a few years ago it was a dry dry county right you couldn't have you couldn't sell booze praise the lord you couldn't have something but now they can i guess they caved right brother about the caved just like the world's caving all kinds of laws that allow you to do stuff that we can't do you can't do because our king says no our king says no and do you realize this morning it's the devil's objective if it's his object if for you to just do what he wants you to do instead of god because that makes him your king because the devil is a king huh he he has a kingdom there's only two kingdoms [Music] but better than says they got the rights they don't have the copyright on the cross that's because they make people if you didn't bow down to that cross huh they would kill you all they wanted you to do is to bow down to what they believe what they said and we had 68 million christians that would not adhere would not bow to a lesser power than god huh that's why you'll see a persecution come upon christianity even more and more to try to close places like this down they'll try to make you think the way they think if they how many knows this bloke thing i'll tell you what a bunch of devils woke up this woke thing is of the devil that's right that's confusion you're going to be uncomfortable if you're homosexual around here because i'll tell you right now your mind has been seared your mind so twisted and god's visit even the bible says you know that they've been you've been given over to a reprobate american that's what you ended up here they drink beer like it's going out of style and they asked about why aren't you drinking with us i guess he didn't preach on drinking that night he says well he didn't know what to say he was trying to be nice and he says you know well i'm an azeroth i'm not supposed to drink smoke or do any of those things oh okay drink their beer some more didn't realize maybe they need to be a nazarite and what was it in finland or italy one of those places and said they don't serve you water do serve you wine just drink it like it's common huh you go to is it france i guess it is one of those he says you know and and you know they have these women that'll wash you know baby everything else and the brothers were going in there to watch places scrub women he says brother you won't find me up in there right he said they have a spirit every kingdom has a spirit and when a brother talked about that woman dressed like that you know he says well she's an american she what she wants are we american no no we're not a low down filthy american we're not folk doing the lowdown filthy german or or any nation huh because they're all ruled by the devil let me ask you what nate are you off what kingdom are you off a heavenly kingdom our spirit is from above us praise be to god because god has done the work in us aren't you glenn i'm glad for it my friend oh my what they thought they find him amongst the holy people the religious people but they didn't find him there did they he wasn't in them am i what's the pharisees in the scribes no we found out later there is they're as different as black is from night huh he wasn't in all the classical beautiful stuff and listen i like this is what the prophet brought to our attention i like this because he says you know with these three wise men in a little crate right bring it about two years to get to the young child it wasn't in the manger when the wise men got there they went into the mother's house where the young child was years later it wasn't no baby this morning [Applause] i should have a rebound on that right here i believe he's right here what did you come to church for this morning to worship the king that's why we gather as we come to man and deals with every affair of your life let me tell you something this king here he rules his place really good it's not haphazard that he rules his he cares so much about every detail of you that he promised that if you seek his kingdom and his righteousness first what is the kingdom of god can somebody tell me what paul said the kingdom of god was for the kingdom of god is not but thank you sister becky paul said the kingdom of god is not beating drink who's talking about what you should and shouldn't eat but he says it's righteousness and peace and joy i believe it was in the holy ghost that's the kingdom of god god coming down and bringing his righteousness into i like it how many believes you got to catch them wrong thoughts just this morning the devil tried to put in my mind my past oh yeah we all got the prezi fest i didn't do stupid stuff in the past but then i did super stupid stuff in the past i mean when i did something it was 150 i should have taken it easy on some of that stuff i wouldn't be so having problems in my mind today anyway and i just said just what i said i said just get back there devil just get that out of my mind the blood of jesus christ cleanses me from all unrighteousness it cleanses me from all of my past don't even bring it up here i come to church to get some more heavenly atmosphere i'm in heavenly places in christ jesus because jesus has quickened us and brought us into heavenly places made us to sit together [Music] that's right sit by somebody that's got a heavenly atmosphere about them aren't you glad that we can come to church and have an atmosphere a heavenly atmosphere i don't know if you your christmas present yesterday or not you might have been depressed after all of that but when you come to church you ain't got to be pressed you ain't got to be disappointed because you've got to keep or one of those kings back there that they went out there and made himself like he was a god and the people acted like he was a god scared hippy with really long fingernails blah you'd say get out of that field quick there's like some kind of an animal in there scary animal that's right you god can turn you into the mind of a animal if he chooses to and your mind won't get turned back how many guy controls your mind oh my he does folks i'm here to tell you got a god you should be thankful this morning god deals with the affairs of your life he cares about the affairs of life all right now notice and at the end of the days nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes upon to heaven and my understanding returned and i blessed the most high wow he changed his part it changed his tune a little bit didn't he by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty is what he said before now i blessed the most high and praised and honored him that liveth forever and ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion how many i believe over hebrews it says you know that we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken it cannot be removed how many beliefs when you're born again you enter into a kingdom that shall never end never end not an ending kingdom all right and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand how may believes when somebody messes with you relax pray for him ask the lord forgive them take it easy on them why because they're dealing with god not you none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou and at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom and my honor and my brightness returned unto me and my counselors and my lord sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom an excellent majesty was added unto me now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of heaven amen isn't that awesome all whose works are truth and his ways are judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abase amen in closing this morning remember how that he had a vision of the statue of the man and one of the last things that he saw was the brass toes and so forth the iron and the feet and so forth that was the last part of that man i'd like to go through that sometimes perhaps up here that was the last kingdom he talked about all the kingdoms the greeks the grecians romans you know that would come after nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was greater than all the romans and all those others but the last kingdom had to do with uh iron and clay and the feet not mixing with each other and you know just don't mix with each other and brother bam says you know there was a meeting i guess in the u.n somewhere when kushchev and eisenhower got together and kush jeff grabbed the shoe up on the table and slapped it on the table because he didn't get everybody's attention all right and brother bam says that represented the east and the west the two legs and so forth the iron and the clay iron means uh eisenhower and kushchev means clay he says we're right in that time period and then the bible says that after that and that during that time period there was a stone that was shown out of the mountains right stone that was hewn out of the mountains had come and he crushed all the kingdoms right somebody knows that's where the age that we're living in amen the age that we're living in is in the time when he's going to come and consume and crush all of these kingdoms and establish what his own kingdom listen we know that right now he who letteth will let until he chooses to come and according to [Applause] ephesians 1 he says until he comes to purchase to redeem his purchased possession in other words if he bought you if he paid for you one of these days he's going to come and redeem that and then he's going to crush all the world and when the seventh angel this is in revelation 11 and 15 he says when the seventh angel sounded there were voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever how many i don't know about you but i'm looking forward to him when he is supreme ruler of the natural world right now he's allowing the devil to do what he does to a certain point right but you know as we live and as we find out things like you know uh you know we know people i take uh brother terry and sister vicky and all of our friends our family different ones you know we go and we live and and we're healthy and then all of a sudden something will strike us right life is so uncertain how we can sit here oh i could see there this morning and talk about brother billy and and ivan and we could talk about uh the cult and bishop we could talk about all those people now i may have sometime we may have like a memorial service for people we know bring pictures or whatever i believe we ought to remember don't you but when he reigns nothing will ever come upon you there'll be no sickness there'll be no death there'll be no sadness there'll be no graveyards no funeral can you imagine when he reigns supreme what it's going to be like well right now we can only imagine folks but i'm telling you it's going to be glorious beyond what we can imagine it's not going to stay this way people one of these days he's going to take these kingdoms and make him all his own and it gets guess what the bible says that those who were resurrected and so forth they lived after the you know not after a thousand but years but in the first resurrection he says we live and reign with christ for what for a thousand years just what that reign is i don't know but i know one thing that if jesus would have come and been the king of israel and ruled them like that and tried to set up campus and all those others as rulers huh can you imagine the corruption that wouldn't have been never worked first god had to get people ready for that kingdom for that place and that's what god is doing you believe that listen to this but the bible says we have access to our king we can have an interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no other intercessor no other mediator between us and our king but the one man christ jesus so we are living in a kingdom and it's called in the chronology of the bible this messianic kingdom how many knows he's the messiah messiah means savior we're living in the savior kingdom of god he's in the saving business he's in the redeeming business and he's here to rule and reign on the throne of our heart how many believes without the token you won't be there what is the token in your life the token is the literal life of jesus christ living in you let's close with that thought in our hearts and our mind in our neighborhood wherever we are remember it's god's life living in you is it really him living is it really every thought are you checking every thought comes into your mind paul said bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the word in other words where the rules in every life in his dominion ruling the lives of his people amen and he called out people from every walk of life gathering them together and he calls it his church how many knows that god is doing something in the middle of all this he's doing a work you might what this world is terrible but god's doing something in the middle of it and i pray that every soul here this morning is a part of that work that god is doing a work in your life and teaching you to surrender every portion of your life to him so he can rule and teach you how to rule because listen as i said at the beginning children if a child is disobedient you would never give him your checkbook you never put him over your business if he can't even listen to you right and if we are still carnal and so forth he could never set us up to kings he could never have us reigning with him amen before we were fit to reign we have to have character amen god bless you let's stand amen you love him this morning hold your head up people you're the son of a king how many believes it we're the son of a king just as that slave was living in a world a strange place still a slave to this flesh this flesh is still holding us down so to speak right let's bow our heads how many this morning would look at your heart and say lord jesus i want you to rule in every kingdom of my heart every part of my heart i've got my hand up and it's those parts listen god is focusing on those parts of you that still need to be surrendered because as you surrender those you become more in the image of christ you become more like him he can be your king every area of your life he doesn't want just part he wants every area i like that song says jesus be the kingdom be the lord of all the kingdoms of my heart father our hands are up nor do you see every hand this morning saying lord jesus we give you permission lord to come and take everything unlike you out father so lord jesus so that when you say something we'll do what you said because you said in the bible lord to pharisees that says why do you call me lord why do you say that i'm your king if i can't rule over you why do you say i'm lord if you don't do the things i tell you lord this morning our hearts desires we want to do what you tell us to do lord we don't want to be those we don't want to be a part of those who come on that same and say lord lord have we done this that the other and to have been told i never knew you lord jesus we ask and say father take control of every part of our lives lord in this coming year lord jesus more than ever father we want to be in your perfect will lord jesus show us where we're still not surrendered to you like we should be father lord be above every devil in our hearts lord jesus live there so any devil that comes any trap any trick that the devil tries to come at us with father we'll be able to overcome and say it's under our feet because we're in christ our blessed congregation bless every heart this morning jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms of our heart is our hearts desire lord because you are our king you are our lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen let's give the lord a hand of worship say thank you lord jesus hallelujah thank you
