[50:39] and some good good memories that we've
[50:41] taken back every time we
[50:42] we get together with god's people we
[50:44] have
[50:45] good things to say about it and good
[50:47] things happen amen so we do appreciate
[50:49] the goodness of our lord jesus christ
[50:51] and
[50:52] thank you all believing leaving tomorrow
[50:53] heading back and any whichever one of
[50:55] you touch the lord for my wife i thank
[50:57] you
[50:58] uh if you're praying for her and uh
[51:01] she's feeling better
[51:02] i don't know that everybody's saying
[51:04] well sister bernie coming with i don't
[51:06] know i guess we gotta turn young before
[51:08] that will happen so
[51:09] she doesn't like to travel anymore so
[51:11] and i don't love it anymore but i do it
[51:14] so uh happy to have been here you just
[51:17] it'll be glorious when we can travel
[51:18] like a thought won't it it'll just be
[51:21] easy and it won't cost you three bucks a
[51:22] gallon
[51:23] and uh all that
[51:25] i walked in today i bought some gas and
[51:27] i said boy this cheap gas here in
[51:29] russellville she said that's cheap 309
[51:32] we're paying almost 360 something up
[51:34] there in arizona california went over
[51:36] top tipped over five dollars a gallon
[51:39] that's crazy world plenty of oil they're
[51:42] trying to shut us down aren't they
[51:44] amen trying to lock us down that's
[51:46] communism no traveling no going there no
[51:48] going there but we're going to go anyway
[51:49] in fact we're going to travel out of
[51:51] this place pretty soon whether they like
[51:53] it or not amen so we thank god for that
[51:56] so in the book of second peter 1 we'll
[51:58] get right going in the scriptures second
[52:00] peter 1 19
[52:03] we have also a more sure word of
[52:05] prophecy where do where unto you do well
[52:09] that you take heed as unto a light that
[52:11] shineth in a dark place until until the
[52:14] day dawn
[52:15] and the day star
[52:16] arise in your hearts these are all
[52:18] beautiful words aren't they and it's but
[52:20] it
[52:21] it's so simple as what happens it's just
[52:23] god makes himself real to you that's
[52:26] what's talking about right
[52:28] now if you agree with me at any point in
[52:30] time during the service i give you 100
[52:33] permission to say amen and you don't
[52:35] have to say it silently you can say it
[52:38] out loud okay how do you feel about that
[52:41] feel good all right so uh we go on
[52:44] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[52:46] the scripture is of any private
[52:48] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[52:50] in old time by the will of man but holy
[52:52] men of god spake as they were moved by
[52:54] the holy ghost shall we pray father
[52:57] bless your people bless your word act of
[53:00] it in our life tonight help us by faith
[53:02] to make it live father for your word is
[53:04] a living it's a seed it's planted in the
[53:06] right ground watered lord by prayer by
[53:09] faith by praise it must bring forth of
[53:11] its kind and we thank you for it we ask
[53:13] it in jesus name amen you may take your
[53:16] seats make yourself comfortable for
[53:18] about 20 minutes
[53:19] i got one mint in my mouth or i had it i
[53:22] don't know where it went
[53:23] and so uh
[53:25] and then after 20 minutes i hope you'll
[53:27] really be in the spirit you won't have
[53:29] to make yourself come to blah blah ben
[53:31] but uh anyway uh
[53:33] we don't have to make disclaimers we
[53:35] just you know preachers do get carried
[53:37] away sometimes so don't don't make me
[53:39] get carried away okay be real quiet just
[53:41] sit there and just kind of snooze a
[53:43] little bit and then i won't get carried
[53:44] away but if you want to get something
[53:46] out of the service don't do that
[53:48] don't do that but then if you get to
[53:50] saying amen brother thomas don't do that
[53:52] because uh because i'm here this my last
[53:55] time here and i'm gonna i'm gonna make
[53:56] it my best day here although sunday i
[53:59] don't know how it could be topped what
[54:00] we had sunday service over there in
[54:02] russellville it was a beautiful service
[54:03] so we had a great time anytime the holy
[54:06] spirit comes down it's a great time and
[54:08] we thank god for that we don't have to
[54:10] uh uh
[54:11] bring him down he's already here we just
[54:13] have to bring ourself down where we can
[54:15] recognize what he wants to do in our
[54:17] life amen humble ourself in the sight of
[54:20] god and he'll lift us up right
[54:22] amen so we thank god for his mercy so
[54:26] more sure word of prophecy i've been
[54:27] looking at this and thinking about it
[54:29] that you know what could be more sure
[54:30] than god's word it's not that it's any
[54:33] different but what it is it's changing
[54:35] from a dormant prophecy into an active
[54:38] prophecy so we're talking about the
[54:40] power of active prophecy and what
[54:42] happens is every word of god will come
[54:44] to pass but when it comes to pass is no
[54:47] longer just laying there it is actually
[54:50] working its magic its wonders its power
[54:52] its beauty its glory and and actually
[54:55] that's what a christian is is what we
[54:57] were before it was dormant in us but
[55:00] what we are now it's active in us and
[55:02] that same lord jesus christ that was
[55:05] born in us when we were born there was a
[55:07] gift born in you every one of you
[55:09] brother brian and every one of you
[55:10] brother austin everyone every single one
[55:13] of us brother caleb everyone had a gift
[55:15] laying in them when we were born and god
[55:17] put that in there and it was a promise
[55:19] of something good to unfold in our life
[55:22] and listen to me if you're alive tonight
[55:24] and how many are
[55:25] then god watched over you to turn that
[55:28] promise that he laid in you when you
[55:30] were born into active prophecy and
[55:33] there's where the power is and that's
[55:35] why there's churches that are powerless
[55:37] people that are powerless preachers that
[55:39] are powerless because they're looking
[55:41] for something to come when they don't
[55:44] have the faith to make it live now god
[55:47] sent us a prophet to show us that you
[55:49] can take god's word and make it live
[55:52] right now in fact the bible says now
[55:55] faith is the substance not future faith
[55:58] not past faith but now faith amen am i
[56:02] doing all right
[56:03] well don't get me started now please for
[56:06] a prophecy came not in the old time
[56:10] by the will of man it's god's will that
[56:12] he placed something within us listen
[56:14] you're the reason you're alive tonight
[56:15] is because it's god's will you wouldn't
[56:17] be here if it wasn't god's will
[56:19] you wouldn't be here not chasing
[56:21] personalities you're not chasing legends
[56:23] you're not chasing a good man
[56:25] all those words don't apply to me i
[56:27] don't know who he was talking about
[56:29] must've been my twin brother but i'm
[56:31] telling you what listen i haven't got
[56:33] good yet but i'm getting better all the
[56:35] time so we're going to get there one of
[56:37] these days amen one of these days i'm
[56:40] going to hear him say it was well done
[56:42] you good and faithful servant that's
[56:44] when i'll know i got there amen bless it
[56:46] be the name of the lord until then we
[56:48] just keep pressing on with the help of
[56:50] the lord changing what's laying dormant
[56:52] inside of us into active prophecy that
[56:55] becomes power amen i believe that don't
[56:58] you so we thank god for that so we know
[57:00] prophecy from the holy spirit it's
[57:02] always been the spirit the spirit of god
[57:04] wrote the bible men just penned it
[57:06] spirit of god wrote the bible that's why
[57:08] people say i can't trust the bible
[57:09] because men wrote that well they just
[57:11] you god just used their hands in their
[57:13] quill but it was the holy spirit that
[57:15] wrote the word is that true same with
[57:18] the message amen praise the name of the
[57:20] lord like somebody was talking to
[57:21] brother branham said i disagree with you
[57:24] when you're talking about what baptism
[57:25] in the name lord jesus christ he said
[57:27] brother and william branham i like you
[57:28] but that's just one man's opinion
[57:30] brother branham said yeah but that one
[57:32] man is god or himself so if it's
[57:34] almighty god's opinion you can be sure
[57:36] it's going to come to pass blessed be
[57:38] the name of the lord
[57:39] am i going too fast
[57:41] too slow
[57:43] just right
[57:46] well boy that's the first time in my
[57:48] whole life i've ever done that so we
[57:50] thank the lord so
[57:52] great things are happening right here in
[57:53] kentucky
[57:54] amen
[57:56] until we thank god for that so see
[57:58] prophecy is god's foreknowledge of
[58:00] events and then he lays it into people
[58:02] he lays it into nations he lays it into
[58:05] kings he lays it into situations and he
[58:08] lays all that prophecy there waiting for
[58:10] the time when the actual person that
[58:12] that's describing is uh on the scene and
[58:15] then when that person is on the scene
[58:17] that person has the ability right sister
[58:19] johnny that person have the ability to
[58:22] turn that that what laid there waiting
[58:24] waiting waiting waiting to have the
[58:26] power within them to believe god to
[58:29] where they turn that into an act of
[58:31] prophecy then it becomes powerful just
[58:34] like you lay there sick god gave you a
[58:36] promise of healing that that'll just lay
[58:38] there until you activate it by believing
[58:40] when you believe when you're sick the
[58:42] bible said call the elders of the church
[58:44] ain't gotten the elders call the
[58:45] youngers call somebody that got the holy
[58:48] ghost in them to pray over you prayer of
[58:49] faith we'll pray will he will save the
[58:52] sick and god will raise him up and all
[58:54] of a sudden you can say praise the lord
[58:56] i once was sick but that prophecy that
[58:58] god gave me is not dormant anymore amen
[59:01] dormant prophecy cannot bring joy it
[59:04] cannot bring victory dormant prophecy
[59:06] can only be spoken it cannot be lived it
[59:09] has to be lived when it's activated when
[59:11] activated it lives itself it's not you
[59:15] living the christian life it's god's
[59:17] word living the christian life in you
[59:20] amen thank god for that so we see that
[59:22] see the spoken
[59:24] word actually steers and controls
[59:26] everything that's going on prophecy
[59:28] controls everything that's going on the
[59:30] earth today everything in the earth
[59:32] that's happening everything in america
[59:34] that's happening listen the pope
[59:36] is a dormant prophecy coming to active
[59:39] now our president this communist
[59:42] movement in our country is a dormant
[59:44] prophecy coming active prophet of god
[59:46] said it'll come back and it'll come
[59:48] right into this country he said it it'll
[59:50] have to happen just like he said it amen
[59:53] pressure will come on squeeze on it's
[59:55] dormant now it's happening oh my brother
[59:58] that's why peter said we have a more
[1:00:00] sure word of prophecy what does that
[1:00:02] mean it's an active prophecy this isn't
[1:00:05] just something that can be disputed now
[1:00:07] it's out there showing itself
[1:00:10] anybody that has eyes can see it now
[1:00:13] amen so we thank the lord
[1:00:16] praise the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:18] just like on the day of pentecost they
[1:00:19] were waiting and it was a dormant
[1:00:21] prophecy and jesus said go up there in
[1:00:22] the upper room and said when that
[1:00:24] happens now then when it happened it
[1:00:26] turned from dormant active and actually
[1:00:28] brother they couldn't hold themselves in
[1:00:30] the upper room anymore jesus never did
[1:00:32] say come down out of the peru
[1:00:35] jesus never told him to come down out of
[1:00:37] the upper room he said go up into the
[1:00:40] upper room
[1:00:41] the knowing that in the laying in that
[1:00:43] prophecy they were supposed to be hiding
[1:00:45] in that upper room forever but they were
[1:00:48] waiting for that thing to become active
[1:00:49] in it when it became active you know a
[1:00:51] lot of people say oh well just do say
[1:00:53] what the prophet said but every word he
[1:00:55] said
[1:00:56] has an active prophecy within that which
[1:00:59] is lay dormant for years and when it
[1:01:01] actually springs to life it's a lot
[1:01:04] different than the way people interpret
[1:01:06] it that's why the prophet said don't
[1:01:08] interpret nothing don't put a period on
[1:01:10] any promise of god just let god have his
[1:01:13] way and bring it to pass blessed be the
[1:01:16] name of the lord we all have a different
[1:01:18] opinion about how the rapture is gonna
[1:01:19] be how the resurrection is gonna happen
[1:01:21] how many days we'll be here where we'll
[1:01:23] get together what we'll say what we'll
[1:01:25] do all these different things what will
[1:01:27] be eaten at the wooden supper all these
[1:01:29] different questions but now that when it
[1:01:30] comes to pass all those opinions pass
[1:01:32] away it'll be different than what any of
[1:01:34] us thought amen blessed be the name of
[1:01:37] the lord praise the lord of the lord say
[1:01:39] brother ted you're excited no i'm an act
[1:01:41] of prophecy so are you my brother we're
[1:01:43] active prophecies tonight blessed be the
[1:01:46] name let's get up and go then amen let
[1:01:48] me let me get done i'll let you go
[1:01:50] you go out and live your prophecy amen
[1:01:53] thanks be to god so we thank the lord
[1:01:56] for them so it become upon them to
[1:01:59] empower them see they couldn't even
[1:02:00] preach while they had government
[1:02:02] prophecy says yo jesus said go up in the
[1:02:04] upper room wait for it to happen but
[1:02:05] until it happened until that prophecy
[1:02:07] became active they couldn't even preach
[1:02:10] that's why a lot of times preachers you
[1:02:12] know they're just it's a male ticket for
[1:02:14] them or something they might be well
[1:02:15] educated they can quote quotes and they
[1:02:17] can say things but rather it can't be
[1:02:19] active prophecy unless they got the holy
[1:02:21] ghost the holy ghost got to come down
[1:02:23] and burn out the sin out of our life how
[1:02:25] many love the lord tonight
[1:02:27] the prophecy was transitioning they
[1:02:29] couldn't preach they're in the upper
[1:02:30] room they couldn't come down jesus never
[1:02:33] did say come down he said go up there
[1:02:34] and wait oh my brother but when it
[1:02:37] became active they came down rather when
[1:02:40] it becomes active you do things you
[1:02:41] never thought you could do
[1:02:43] amen and rather it'll give you power to
[1:02:46] where nobody can stop you from it either
[1:02:49] you're going to press the way no devil
[1:02:50] can stop you no discouragement no
[1:02:53] depression no sickness no nothing can
[1:02:55] stop you
[1:02:56] say well i know people are sick and
[1:02:58] they're leading up so yeah but i'll tell
[1:03:00] you what i know the same people who led
[1:03:02] the nurse and the doctor to jesus christ
[1:03:04] i know the ones that stood there singing
[1:03:05] and laying in there in the midst of
[1:03:07] their suffering they had to grace the
[1:03:09] same faces to god created an atmosphere
[1:03:11] and somebody in the next room jumped up
[1:03:14] and was healed i'm telling you what you
[1:03:16] can't stop the promise of god
[1:03:18] who
[1:03:20] what was in that mint you pointed me to
[1:03:22] my brother david he offered me a
[1:03:24] 20-minute mint and i'm telling you what
[1:03:26] it's really working i got about 12
[1:03:29] minutes left thank the lord dormant
[1:03:31] prophecy could not empower them neither
[1:03:33] it can it us but brother it's dormant in
[1:03:36] us
[1:03:37] our faith changes it
[1:03:39] our faith without faith it's impossible
[1:03:41] to please god
[1:03:43] well i studied and studied and studied
[1:03:44] but do you believe oh yeah i believe
[1:03:47] brother brandon said you can say that
[1:03:48] but sit down in here you don't he said
[1:03:50] not this man it's not this man it's this
[1:03:53] man and when you have this man has it
[1:03:55] this man can say it that man can know it
[1:03:58] then it's active because it comes from
[1:04:00] here amen
[1:04:01] thank the lord for that see i lived
[1:04:03] almost 70 years to learn this i'm going
[1:04:06] to tell you everything i know this is it
[1:04:08] that i come to the place now to where a
[1:04:11] life that's playing dormant doing
[1:04:12] nothing a so-called legend
[1:04:15] a so-called good man it turns different
[1:04:18] when it becomes active in him it's no
[1:04:20] longer just a story it's no longer just
[1:04:22] a fable it's a living reality amen my
[1:04:26] brother
[1:04:29] i never do that too much
[1:04:31] make a noise like that but i just did

[1:04:41] i'll tell you what i turned african
[1:04:44] dancing i shattered now
[1:04:46] and i jumped and everything in the
[1:04:48] preaching
[1:04:49] and they said all right now it's time
[1:04:50] for the living legend to come up and
[1:04:52] speak and i didn't have to hardly preach
[1:04:54] i preached about five minutes the
[1:04:56] presence of the lord came down i said
[1:04:58] brother brown said he walked into places
[1:04:59] he said where people were expecting god
[1:05:01] to move he said they were so expectant
[1:05:04] he said that before he ever came out to
[1:05:06] the platform every sick one in there out
[1:05:09] of hundreds of and thousands and
[1:05:10] thousands of people every sick person in
[1:05:13] there was healed already just because
[1:05:15] they were under such expectation of
[1:05:17] turning a prophecy from dormant into
[1:05:20] active prophecy then brother ben said
[1:05:22] i've seen it happen many times i could
[1:05:24] show you the quote and brother branham
[1:05:26] said if we could come into that same
[1:05:28] level of expectation we could see the
[1:05:31] same things happening god would be
[1:05:33] duty-bound to see that happen for us
[1:05:36] amen

[1:10:10] said when the word has been spoken for a
[1:10:12] certain generation this is what shall i
[1:10:13] do jesus calling christ he said god is
[1:10:15] going to rise somebody on the scene
[1:10:18] who's going to fulfill that word
[1:10:20] now are we talking about another prophet
[1:10:22] coming or something with another message
[1:10:23] no sir that was never spoken but brother
[1:10:25] what are we talking about people who
[1:10:27] believe that prophet the
[1:10:29] shaped and created through that mouth of
[1:10:31] that ministry amen and that when it
[1:10:33] comes he said and that is the
[1:10:35] vindication of the prophecy he said as
[1:10:38] jesus met every qualification so
[1:10:41] will there be people today who meet that
[1:10:44] qualification my brother my sister you
[1:10:47] meet that qualification amen blessed be
[1:10:50] the name of the lord hallelujah brother
[1:10:52] babs
[1:10:53] said don't get scared in the days of
[1:10:55] noah he said god had an ark that typed
[1:10:57] christ and he said in arkan 55 he said
[1:10:59] don't get scared
[1:11:01] he said god is driving the winds you say
[1:11:03] all the winds are horrible god's driving
[1:11:05] them don't get scared god is driving the
[1:11:07] winds
[1:11:08] do you believe that
[1:11:10] god is driving the winds amen god is
[1:11:12] driving the ark he has all things
[1:11:14] provided
[1:11:16] i know you're trying to keep me short so
[1:11:17] but if you want to say amen you can
[1:11:20] get one more word out of me i'm going to
[1:11:22] shut down here soon the space i'm going
[1:11:24] i can't hold it up very long only about
[1:11:26] four hours so
[1:11:29] amen because i'm turning younger by the
[1:11:31] second now you don't want me to get too
[1:11:33] young i'll tell you that so not on a
[1:11:35] wednesday night let's do that on a
[1:11:36] weekend meeting blessed be the name of
[1:11:38] the lord listen to this now he said you
[1:11:41] think look at you if noah would have not
[1:11:44] had any victories
[1:11:47] he said if there wouldn't have been
[1:11:49] storms and trials
[1:11:51] he said if we're just putting a little
[1:11:52] safe tunnel and we just run through safe
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:56] he said
[1:11:57] there's no joy
[1:11:58] he said the storms of life is what makes
[1:12:01] us have joy
[1:12:03] how joyful are you
[1:12:05] how many storms have you got it's
[1:12:07] depending on how many storms you're
[1:12:08] going through is how much joy you can
[1:12:10] have
[1:12:12] how many can anybody here want to say i
[1:12:14] can have a lot of joy brother
[1:12:18] i guess i'm the only one who say that
[1:12:20] i can have a lot of joy been through a
[1:12:22] lot of storms we never know what
[1:12:24] daylight is unless we've had some dark
[1:12:25] he said you're never gonna know good
[1:12:27] health unless you've had some sickness
[1:12:28] you never know how to enjoy salvation
[1:12:31] unless you was once a sinner
[1:12:33] if you're not enjoying your salvation
[1:12:35] now maybe you never did repent maybe you
[1:12:36] never did get converted maybe you just
[1:12:38] joined church maybe you just got
[1:12:39] baptized maybe some good preacher
[1:12:41] blessed you and gave you
[1:12:42] gave you his blessing but that that
[1:12:44] doesn't joy only comes when you know
[1:12:46] what you were now you know what you are
[1:12:49] amen and it's activated what was in you
[1:12:52] is you were born to be that you were
[1:12:54] born to be a christian amen you were
[1:12:56] born with that prophecy in you how many
[1:12:58] believe that

[1:13:14] to come when is hard is that when is
[1:13:17] that consolation of israel going to come

[1:15:29] lord that's when prophecy changes from

[1:16:00] not my plan but that
[1:16:02] that meant been gone a long time
[1:16:06] so we're talking about
[1:16:10] that's what makes joy
[1:16:11] see the voice of god
[1:16:14] when god called abram you know it was
[1:16:16] down in er
[1:16:17] how many ever heard about all the great
[1:16:19] things abram did he was the seed of god

[1:16:23] god he was the man the father of faith
[1:16:25] while he was down in earth
[1:16:27] he was but it was dormant in him it was
[1:16:30] dormant in him you know did god make a
[1:16:31] mistake when he came to abraham he came
[1:16:33] to the right guy he came to the one who
[1:16:35] that that promise was in
[1:16:37] and he called him did and did did he
[1:16:40] make a mistake when he called abraham no
[1:16:43] don't get me started get me started
[1:16:45] please say that now i'm getting nervous
[1:16:47] and then we find out that did he make a
[1:16:49] mistake when he came to you
[1:16:51] did god make the mistakes that come to
[1:16:53] the wrong person or no prophecy laying
[1:16:55] in him god didn't make a mistake god
[1:16:58] knows there's something laying in you
[1:17:00] dormant fair and you have to turn it
[1:17:03] into active prophecy
[1:17:05] i believe that by believing it that's
[1:17:07] true
[1:17:08] arrows are in er how many read all the
[1:17:11] great things that abram did when he was
[1:17:12] down in er in the bible
[1:17:15] i didn't
[1:17:17] i didn't see it there
[1:17:19] because it was dormant it was laying in
[1:17:21] him but once it started activating then
[1:17:23] you saw it then it could be described
[1:17:25] then it could be written amen oh
[1:17:28] god wrote our name in lamb's book of
[1:17:30] life he wasn't talking about dormant
[1:17:32] prophecy he was talking about active
[1:17:34] life in us he was what he was seeing
[1:17:36] what we were doing
[1:17:38] he saw what you were doing that you
[1:17:40] would repent and that's how he wrote
[1:17:42] your name the lamb's book of life said
[1:17:44] the pre-day wrote and predestinated you
[1:17:46] to come in because he saw you saying
[1:17:48] lord i want to be on your side oh i'm
[1:17:51] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:17:53] i'm sick and tired of being a sinner i'm

[1:17:56] selfish i want to live for you
[1:17:59] amen he said here i am
[1:18:01] when you said that didn't take him long
[1:18:03] to get there did it

[1:18:22] the bible all the great things that job
[1:18:24] did before the trap the trial and test
[1:18:28] all you see is he was a perfect man just
[1:18:30] man perfect man but where's all the
[1:18:33] great things he did where's all the
[1:18:34] people's lives he changed where the
[1:18:35] touch and everything and people come
[1:18:37] from aisles around to hear about from
[1:18:39] jokes you don't read that in there
[1:18:41] because it's laying dormant in his life
[1:18:42] but brother when the trouble came and
[1:18:45] the hell of you came down watching over
[1:18:47] him amen god is sitting right next to
[1:18:49] you listen elihu was dormant laying
[1:18:52] dormant elihu was sitting there watching
[1:18:55] job in the midst of his trial sometimes
[1:18:57] god will sit right there but listen
[1:19:00] if the right man is sitting by you
[1:19:02] he's holding on to your hand he's
[1:19:04] keeping you amen god was keeping job he
[1:19:06] was sitting right there he was sitting
[1:19:08] right there thinking oh lord give me
[1:19:10] grace give me grace give him grace in
[1:19:12] grace it was jesus by the man who said
[1:19:14] the elohim was jesus the lord himself is
[1:19:16] me his name means the lord himself just
[1:19:18] like in the scripture in first
[1:19:19] thessalonians 4 13 13-16 said the lord
[1:19:22] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:19:24] shout this message his helium the lord
[1:19:27] himself the mighty god come down how
[1:19:29] many believe that
[1:19:30] and he sits there
[1:19:32] because you're dormant
[1:19:34] waiting for you to act upon your promise
[1:19:37] and then he begins to activate it
[1:19:39] did you notice job
[1:19:40] never did have the total restoration
[1:19:44] until elihu began to talk
[1:19:46] and then the pillar fired new whirlwind
[1:19:48] came down god said job all right you're
[1:19:50] not a baby no more stand up like a man
[1:19:52] gird your loins up i'm going to give you
[1:19:54] some adoption here i'm going to give you
[1:19:56] some real meat for your soul now amen
[1:19:59] how many love the lord tonight
[1:20:01] amen see god was identifying himself
[1:20:03] with job he was staking his reputation
[1:20:05] on job
[1:20:06] god said if job fails then i have failed
[1:20:09] but god knew that he couldn't fail
[1:20:11] neither could job fail amen if job
[1:20:14] curses me that i have failed my job i
[1:20:17] have made a false prophecy but job never
[1:20:19] cursed god amen he cursed his birthday
[1:20:22] he you know he cursed all the pain but
[1:20:25] rather he never cursed god never cursed
[1:20:27] his wife amen amen didn't curse his his
[1:20:30] uh wow
[1:20:32] watch out when you get one of these
[1:20:33] tablets you don't even have to touch it
[1:20:35] and it starts
[1:20:36] growing i think my dormant tablet is
[1:20:39] coming active here now
[1:20:40] whoo
[1:20:42] man
[1:20:43] just got to do the right thing
[1:20:49] so i'm winding down with a couple of
[1:20:51] little thoughts
[1:20:56] i've got this too i don't like even here
[1:20:58] i hear myself breathing
[1:21:01] i can even hear my heart beat here
[1:21:06] getting active now
[1:21:08] that's pretty sick the sound in heart
[1:21:09] but that's the best i can do
[1:21:13] amen
[1:21:14] you know brother ben said oneness with
[1:21:16] god is having god's spirit in you
[1:21:19] agreeing with the word oh we all want to
[1:21:20] be one with god brother when he preached
[1:21:22] that message that's we
[1:21:23] we always hear that at least once a year
[1:21:25] all of us message please i'm sure that
[1:21:27] message once oneness with god
[1:21:29] more often would be better but
[1:21:32] and then he said oneness with god is
[1:21:34] having god's spirit in you agreeing with
[1:21:35] the word
[1:21:38] correct me if i'm wrong but he said
[1:21:40] agreeing with the word all the word
[1:21:43] the whole word
[1:21:45] okay you say well praise the lord i do
[1:21:46] that ain't done enough yet it's still
[1:21:48] dormant watch
[1:21:49] and to make it manifested in power
[1:21:52] you've got to turn it active again
[1:21:53] you've got to turn it active brother
[1:21:55] jesus said uh very very i say unto you
[1:21:58] in john 14 12 the words that i do you do
[1:22:00] also and greater than this you you do
[1:22:03] prophet of god said in the message that
[1:22:04] day on calvary said greater works he
[1:22:06] said was to have the power in the church
[1:22:08] how many believe that we have a church
[1:22:09] that has that power have a power in that
[1:22:12] church not only to heal the sick by
[1:22:14] prayer right not only anybody ever been
[1:22:16] healed by sick but by prayer
[1:22:20] in the church here so say amen not only
[1:22:22] to heal the sick by prayer
[1:22:24] not only to cast out devils by prayer he
[1:22:27] said but he said to impart
[1:22:30] eternal life to believers
[1:22:33] by telling them about the holy ghost and
[1:22:35] when they reach the holy ghost they have
[1:22:37] eternal life because that's the greater
[1:22:39] works that the church has amen and amen
[1:22:42] to impart
[1:22:44] eternal life
[1:22:45] you can change somebody's life
[1:22:48] oh it to be we could change our own
[1:22:50] children
[1:22:51] but sometimes god will let you have more
[1:22:54] effect
[1:22:55] outside because a prophet's not without
[1:22:57] honor except in his own house among his
[1:22:59] own people
[1:23:00] amen but someday they'll see it someday
[1:23:04] they'll see it blessed be the name of
[1:23:06] the lord just keep it active keep it
[1:23:07] humble always got to be in humility
[1:23:10] never enforced you can't force an
[1:23:11] amnesiac to remember
[1:23:14] who they are
[1:23:15] the minute you try to force them they go
[1:23:16] into trauma sometimes they they go into
[1:23:19] complete bewilderment sometimes they
[1:23:20] even take their life as a result as a
[1:23:22] result of being forced you know somebody
[1:23:24] who's forgot who they were by a blow on
[1:23:26] the head you nobody can be cured by
[1:23:28] force brother they have those people has
[1:23:30] got to be cured by just little by little
[1:23:34] seeing something that brings them back
[1:23:36] seeing something that they remember
[1:23:37] isn't it true this is a little something
[1:23:39] to say rings true to them and makes them
[1:23:41] reminds them of home or maybe smelling a
[1:23:43] smell that reminds my mama and her
[1:23:46] cooking the dumplings on the on the cook
[1:23:48] on the cook stove in the boil boiling
[1:23:50] there or whatever it was and they takes
[1:23:52] them back oh my
[1:23:54] no no i'm remembering i'm remembering
[1:23:56] what i was born for what a who i am amen
[1:23:59] and it's coming to us little by little
[1:24:01] but force will never we can't start
[1:24:03] using force now right brother thomas you
[1:24:05] know it's always been grace it's always
[1:24:06] been grace grace is great that grace
[1:24:08] that taught my heart to fear it's grace
[1:24:10] that keeps helping me it's grace that
[1:24:13] takes away my fears amen goes on all the
[1:24:15] way until a rapturing grace changes me
[1:24:18] and i go home amen but it's all it's all
[1:24:21] prophecy turning active little by little
[1:24:24] in our life
[1:24:29] amen means that's true i agree it's
[1:24:31] right and so forth like that so i hope i
[1:24:34] hope don't say brother ted come to us on
[1:24:36] a wednesday night preach real powerful
[1:24:38] buddy
[1:24:39] it wasn't any of it any good i hope you
[1:24:41] don't say that like you say at least
[1:24:43] one word of it was good
[1:24:47] when he said i'm closing and he kept his
[1:24:49] promise that was the best part
[1:24:52] i've been doing that lately i'm going to
[1:24:53] surprise you people
[1:24:55] i say it and then i do it i surprised
[1:24:57] myself i did it one time
[1:25:00] this might be number two and i'm on a
[1:25:01] roll
[1:25:06] look at the look at the widow woman in
[1:25:08] the days of life in elijah she turned
[1:25:10] her prophecy that god had sent elijah
[1:25:13] down there and said i've commanded a
[1:25:15] widow woman down there this one this
[1:25:17] woman was commanded
[1:25:19] to to break bread with elijah and
[1:25:23] housing because the brook dried up and
[1:25:26] and
[1:25:26] ravens wasn't beating him anymore so he
[1:25:29] had to go down there amen ravens
[1:25:31] couldn't find no sandwiches or anything
[1:25:33] nowhere nothing they couldn't steal or
[1:25:35] bring down to uh
[1:25:37] amen

[1:27:16] got a prophecy in you but you have to
[1:27:18] bring it out into power in your life
[1:27:22] amen so she did by obeying and then the
[1:27:25] prophet said okay said what are you
[1:27:27] doing said i'm out here picking up
[1:27:29] sticks you see i got two sticks here and
[1:27:31] i got back home i got a empty barrel i
[1:27:34] took out the last little scoop of it of
[1:27:36] the meal and said i got a spoonful of

[1:27:54] well
[1:27:55] thus saith the lord make me one first
[1:27:57] then
[1:27:59] amen and inside that prophecy was laying
[1:28:01] three years of it's brother three years
[1:28:04] of this laying inside that one simple
[1:28:06] word because when he said first
[1:28:08] there's got to be a second there's got
[1:28:09] to be a continuation amen my brother
[1:28:12] thanks me to god the woman of the blood
[1:28:14] issue turned her prophecy you know and
[1:28:16] they said that he he's got healing in
[1:28:18] his wings and all she could keep her
[1:28:20] eyes on was the
[1:28:21] i think i preached this here before
[1:28:22] didn't i brother thomas but i preached
[1:28:24] this to different places that i love
[1:28:25] these stories about turning the
[1:28:28] scripture into active power in our life
[1:28:31] and she a promise was laying there
[1:28:33] there's healing in his wings and so
[1:28:34] she's got her eyes on the hems of his
[1:28:36] garment well got her eyes on the hems of
[1:28:38] his garment jordan look at his face she
[1:28:40] wasn't sizing him up saying well does he
[1:28:42] look like a prophet does he walk like a
[1:28:44] prophet all she had her eyes on because
[1:28:46] the scripture prophecy was laying in
[1:28:48] here she could just touch the hem of his
[1:28:50] garment if she could just touch the hand
[1:28:52] of his garment she was going to be all
[1:28:53] right no more doctor no more meds no
[1:28:56] more of this number nothing just he was
[1:28:58] going to be all right amen rather than
[1:29:02] she turned that prophecy into active
[1:29:04] prophecy brother and it was living in
[1:29:07] her and it drew the virtue out of the
[1:29:09] lord jesus christ
[1:29:13] you were born to have virtue you were
[1:29:16] born the people draw
[1:29:18] sometimes they'll draw so hard you ain't
[1:29:20] got nothing left but you were born to
[1:29:22] get a refilling you were born to get a
[1:29:24] recharging you were born to know how
[1:29:26] listen if you buy one of these electric
[1:29:27] cars you got nowhere to plug it in
[1:29:29] brother you're coming to christ god has
[1:29:32] a little station space places for you to
[1:29:34] plug in amen
[1:29:36] bless it be the name of the lord
[1:29:39] hallelujah
[1:29:40] thanks be to god for his love and mercy
[1:29:43] now at this rate i'm going to be done
[1:29:45] before some of you even get in on it so
[1:29:48] don't miss out please
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:52] the blind man let's sit in there
[1:29:54] then he's born blind
[1:29:56] you know brother ben said time and sight
[1:29:58] it's a worse two enemies to divine
[1:30:00] healing because the longer it goes the
[1:30:03] harder it is for you to believe harder
[1:30:06] it is for you to believe that it's god's
[1:30:07] will to heal you the longer you've been
[1:30:09] sick
[1:30:10] and then sight what you see i don't see
[1:30:12] no change well for one day two days
[1:30:14] three days anybody can hold out three
[1:30:16] days five days seven days nine days a
[1:30:18] little bit tougher five years 10 years
[1:30:20] 12 years a little bit harder but look at
[1:30:22] abraham held out 25 years could see
[1:30:24] nothing but all he was looking at was
[1:30:25] the promise he was not considering his
[1:30:28] own body neither yet the deadness of
[1:30:30] sarah's womb wasn't considering that was
[1:30:32] impossible all he was saying was oh
[1:30:35] praise the lord sarah it's going to be
[1:30:37] more of a miracle when it does happen
[1:30:40] amen you talk about prophecy coming
[1:30:42] active brother amen
[1:30:45] that's exactly true so that blind man
[1:30:47] with no eyes he's sitting there jesus
[1:30:48] outside of david and jesus came by and
[1:30:51] jesus
[1:30:52] stood there and he's spitting on the
[1:30:54] ground he's picking up his eyeballs
[1:30:56] because the dirt that was supposed to be
[1:30:57] in his eye sockets never came in he'd
[1:31:00] missed the carrots or whatever was
[1:31:01] growing there that he didn't get in a
[1:31:03] womb but god in the disciples even asked
[1:31:06] jesus why was this man born right who
[1:31:08] sinned and jesus said this is the sin
[1:31:10] issue this was done
[1:31:12] this
[1:31:13] this man was born without eye because he
[1:31:15] didn't eat the carrots it was going to
[1:31:17] put the put the put the uh minerals in
[1:31:19] his body that was gonna make his
[1:31:21] eyeballs and in the womb god kept his
[1:31:23] eyeballs out of the baby he was born
[1:31:25] without eyes and brother instead was
[1:31:26] born without eyes just empty sockets and
[1:31:29] here he was but thank god god had led
[1:31:32] him to be sitting begging at the very
[1:31:34] spot where the dirt was that was
[1:31:36] supposed to make up his eyeballs rather
[1:31:38] when we come in the resurrection if you
[1:31:39] relate part of you is laying over there
[1:31:42] over yonder somewhere else brother god
[1:31:44] will bring it all together and make uh
[1:31:46] make you in the resurrection how many
[1:31:48] believe that
[1:31:49] can't take you down brother god
[1:31:53] has given you a prophecy inside of you
[1:31:55] amen and so his eyeballs jesus made him
[1:31:58] up with him in his hand
[1:32:00] brother jesus make up your miracle right
[1:32:02] in his hand right now he's a master chef
[1:32:05] he's a master craftsman he just takes
[1:32:07] his hand he takes what coming out of his
[1:32:09] mouth he was spitting on the ground what
[1:32:11] comes out of the mouth out of his mouth
[1:32:12] comes the word of god out of the word
[1:32:14] come the word and the word made the
[1:32:17] eyeballs and he put him in there and he
[1:32:18] said now you go and wash and he goes
[1:32:20] down there and washing guess what the
[1:32:22] first thing he saw
[1:32:23] when he when he washed his eyes out in
[1:32:26] the mud out of his eyes
[1:32:28] he saw himself
[1:32:29] in the reflection in the pool and the
[1:32:31] next thing he wanted to see was jesus
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:35] something about it when he touches you
[1:32:37] you want to see him
[1:32:38] you want to get to him and thank him for
[1:32:40] it amen bless it be the name of the lord
[1:32:44] does it sound like i'm winding down
[1:32:47] have i said i'm going to close
[1:32:49] okay i'm just keeping you sharp here or

[1:33:07] come to maturity he had to fulfill all
[1:33:09] the promises of the scripture had to
[1:33:11] grow to that age he had to be growing up
[1:33:13] before him like a tender plant and
[1:33:14] everything like a root out of a dry
[1:33:16] ground he had to fulfill all the
[1:33:18] prophecies and he had to fulfill the
[1:33:20] sufferings of all the people he had to
[1:33:22] have all the sickness he had to bear
[1:33:24] everything that you've ever born and i
[1:33:26] and every one of us by the millions
[1:33:28] throughout the ages he had to bear our

[1:33:38] to the name of the lord but in that that

[1:34:47] that side taxes going up inflation like
[1:34:49] never before a country that's in chaos
[1:34:53] and wickedness and on every hand and
[1:34:54] dictatorship just around the corner amen
[1:34:57] and running us off into little caves and

[1:35:02] beautiful places that god's blessed us
[1:35:05] with taking it away from us all those
[1:35:07] were prophecies that laid dormant but
[1:35:09] brother they're happening now
[1:35:11] they're active and we're talking about

[1:36:06] of life and it was supposed to be in the
[1:36:08] message books amen
[1:36:10] and and so god had to bring it from
[1:36:12] dormant into active before it could get

[1:37:32] came from the word my brother
[1:37:34] blessed be the name of the lord when you
[1:37:36] surrender to your promise
[1:37:38] it becomes active in you
[1:37:41] it becomes the i am instead of

[1:37:49] hope and just hope it was just hope
[1:37:51] i'm doing it right hope i'm in

[1:38:16] been made free
[1:38:17] through the blood of the lamb you've
[1:38:19] been activated brother
[1:38:22] hallelujah
[1:38:26] and a lot of times we get so wore out
[1:38:27] because we're
[1:38:28] we're like slaves you know an assault
[1:38:30] line we're slaves to the
[1:38:32] our boss to our job to
[1:38:35] try to make a living in this crazy world
[1:38:37] or
[1:38:38] used to take
[1:38:39] 50 bucks a month you know to live we
[1:38:41] could live on 50 a month the old days we

[1:38:44] remember in those old days for
[1:38:47] seven eight thousand dollars
[1:38:50] them days are gone

[1:39:28] boast
[1:39:30] he's making his biggest move in his
[1:39:32] biggest play for the entire earth right

[1:39:36] but all throughout the globe god's got
[1:39:38] humble little children who was born with
[1:39:42] a prophecy in them laying dormant
[1:39:44] waiting for situations to arise

[1:41:19] uh waiting to come become active
[1:41:22] and
[1:41:24] best i know how to bring it active
[1:41:27] is just to keep believing
[1:41:29] and keep trusting lord and keep praising
[1:41:33] you
[1:41:34] and just keep on keeping on
[1:41:36] keep on doing what we know is right
[1:41:40] and
[1:41:40] it'll activate
[1:41:42] every promise in us father
[1:41:45] and so we
[1:41:46] thank you lord
[1:41:48] and we know that that rapture
[1:41:51] is in us right now
[1:41:53] and we if we even if we die go to the
[1:41:55] grave and our bodies turn back to the
[1:41:57] elements the rapture is in our
[1:42:00] in the dust
[1:42:01] that we leave behind
[1:42:03] and that will come up again lord and
[1:42:05] we'll be changed
[1:42:07] and pass out of here because his
[1:42:08] prophecy that has laid dormant
[1:42:12] but when it activates there'll be no
[1:42:14] disputing it there'll be no arguing it
[1:42:18] there'll be no fusses about it
[1:42:20] because it became active and it became
[1:42:23] demonstrated so help us
[1:42:26] lord to be that kind of christian
[1:42:30] that we are active as we walk around
[1:42:33] this earth
[1:42:35] carrying a good spirit with us
[1:42:38] carrying the life of christ on display
[1:42:42] because that's the token
[1:42:44] if it's just hidden
[1:42:46] that isn't the token
[1:42:48] it must be on display
[1:42:50] so bless every one of us tonight father
