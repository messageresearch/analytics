[1:03:22] help us Lord Jesus we ask it in Jesus
[1:03:25] name amen and amen if you will we'll
[1:03:28] just go into the word of God let's start
[1:03:30] with Revelations Amen in the Book of
[1:03:32] Revelations and uh amen some of this
[1:03:35] here this has come from uh the the
[1:03:39] things that I've been doing and uh tried
[1:03:43] to play it here a few Wednesdays ago
[1:03:45] about the Azusa Street Revival we know
[1:03:48] that God did a great work it was another
[1:03:50] it was another beginning of a work that
[1:03:55] God was going to do just like he did
[1:03:57] when he did with Martin Luther or John
[1:03:59] Wesley and so forth but it came much
[1:04:02] much more closer to looking like the
[1:04:04] real church amen the real acts the book
[1:04:07] of Acts it was so close as a matter of
[1:04:09] fact that they called themselves
[1:04:10] Pentecostals amen because on the day of
[1:04:13] Pentecost when we know that a prophet
[1:04:15] taught that you got the every individual
[1:04:17] has to have a Pentecostal experience
[1:04:20] amen and Pentecost is not a church or a
[1:04:23] move but it is an experience that we
[1:04:25] have with almighty God Amen and so I
[1:04:28] want to try to start with the with with
[1:04:29] reading the word and then amen perhaps
[1:04:32] uh maybe expounding a little bit on this
[1:04:35] Revelations and for and we'll begin with
[1:04:41] um
[1:04:42] verse 1. now after this I looked and
[1:04:44] behold a door was opened in heaven and
[1:04:47] the voice first voice which I heard was
[1:04:49] as it were the trumpet talking with me
[1:04:52] and switch said come up higher come up
[1:04:54] hither and I will show thee things which
[1:04:57] must be Hereafter and immediately I was
[1:04:59] in the spirit and behold a throne was
[1:05:01] set in heaven and three sat on the
[1:05:04] throne
[1:05:05] no that's not correct is it not when
[1:05:08] John got up there he realized there's
[1:05:09] only one that sat on the throne amen
[1:05:13] amen and immediately I was in the spirit
[1:05:15] and behold a throne was said heaven and
[1:05:17] one side on the throne and he that sat
[1:05:19] sat was to look upon like Jasper and
[1:05:23] sardine stone amen I just right off the
[1:05:27] top of my head I think that each of the
[1:05:29] tribes of Judah or Israel were
[1:05:31] represented in one of those stones and
[1:05:33] if I'm not wrong that was the first and
[1:05:35] the last if I'm not wrong amen and there
[1:05:38] was a rainbow round about the throne in
[1:05:41] sight like an into an emerald and round
[1:05:44] about The Throne were Four and Twenty
[1:05:46] seats and upon the seats I saw Four and
[1:05:50] Twenty Elders sitting clothes in white
[1:05:52] Raymond and they had on their heads
[1:05:54] crowns of gold and out of the throne
[1:05:56] proceeded Lightnings and Thunders and
[1:05:58] voices and there were seven lamps of
[1:06:01] fire burning Before the Throne which are
[1:06:04] the seven spirits of God and Before the
[1:06:07] Throne was uh there was a sea of glass
[1:06:10] like unto Crystal and in the mid the
[1:06:13] throne and round about The Throne there
[1:06:15] were four beasts now notice here
[1:06:18] we have found Four and Twenty Elders now
[1:06:21] we're finding four beasts now we could
[1:06:23] take great time in going into the Old
[1:06:25] Testament Amen in finding Isaiah and so
[1:06:28] forth to different places where they had
[1:06:29] seen these beasts before these Powers
[1:06:32] before Amen in the Old Testament now we
[1:06:35] find them way down here round about The
[1:06:37] Throne there were four beasts full of
[1:06:39] eyes before and behind the first Beast
[1:06:42] was like unto a lion and the second was
[1:06:44] like unto a calf the third Beast was
[1:06:46] like the face of a man and the fourth
[1:06:48] Beast was like a flying eagle and the
[1:06:51] four beasts had each of them six wings
[1:06:52] about them and they were full of eyes
[1:06:55] within amen let me just say this and
[1:06:58] Isaiah sixth chapter remember he went
[1:07:00] into the temple and these cherubims and
[1:07:02] so forth had six wings with two
[1:07:05] defluitive with two they covered the
[1:07:07] face and two amen
[1:07:09] defeat I believe it was amen now and
[1:07:12] then verse 8
[1:07:13] the last was a flying eagle and the four
[1:07:16] beasts had each of them six wings about
[1:07:18] them and they were okay uh full they
[1:07:21] were full of eyes within and they rest
[1:07:24] not day and night saying holy holy holy
[1:07:30] Lord God Almighty which was which is and
[1:07:35] which is to come and we know
[1:07:39] fall down before him that sat on the
[1:07:42] throne and worshiped him that liveth
[1:07:44] forever and ever and cast their crowns
[1:07:47] Before the Throne saying our
[1:07:50] worthy O Lord to receive honor and glory
[1:07:53] and I mean glory and honor and power for
[1:07:58] thou has created all things and forth by
[1:08:00] Pleasure they are and were created amen
[1:08:04] may God that is blessings to reading the
[1:08:06] word you can be seated tonight amen
[1:08:08] praise the Lord amen amen I remember one
[1:08:12] thing I would just want to pick up here
[1:08:14] with with the Revival of Azusa Street
[1:08:17] amen and we know that it lasted for
[1:08:19] black three to three and a half years
[1:08:21] Republic God said no Revival has hardly
[1:08:24] everlasted between Beyond around three
[1:08:27] or so years phenomenal thing about this
[1:08:29] and the things that kind of caught my
[1:08:31] attention was they begin to worship God
[1:08:34] and of course the Holy Ghost begin to
[1:08:36] come down and I mean that makes all the
[1:08:38] difference in the world
[1:08:41] amen all the difference in the world
[1:08:43] Amen to come down and these people
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:49] people in it it was day and night for I
[1:08:51] don't even know how exactly how long but
[1:08:53] it was uh up to around a three year
[1:08:55] period that they would worship and and
[1:08:57] day and night they would go and isn't it
[1:09:00] something how the people even up here
[1:09:02] and uh I forget the name of this place
[1:09:05] up here now in in uh in Kentucky what
[1:09:08] was the name of that town
[1:09:09] Asbury you know the Asbury Revival kind
[1:09:12] of caught our attention a little bit he
[1:09:13] caught my attention enough to kind of
[1:09:15] look at it and and maybe get a few uh uh
[1:09:19] uh looking a few people who were there
[1:09:22] and some of the students that you know
[1:09:24] and they would say things like you know
[1:09:25] yeah the people have come and they've
[1:09:27] enjoyed the Revival now take it home
[1:09:29] because that's what a lot of people
[1:09:30] would do they would take their Revival
[1:09:32] home and no matter where you go you can
[1:09:34] take the Revival with you
[1:09:36] but I thought praise be to God that
[1:09:38] ain't nothing but the truth isn't it
[1:09:39] right you can take that Revival with you
[1:09:42] no matter where you go it's not just
[1:09:43] Asbury or wherever it is but it's
[1:09:45] wherever the presence of God is
[1:09:47] tonight's focus is on how that we can
[1:09:49] get into this revival amen and then and
[1:09:52] you know I was driving down the road let
[1:09:54] me just throw these out at you but you
[1:09:56] know I made the thought the thought came
[1:09:58] to my mind is that you shouldn't need
[1:10:00] Revival
[1:10:06] I thought brother time what in the world
[1:10:08] are you thinking
[1:10:10] anything you look at that you look
[1:10:13] you look Revival and in the Revival
[1:10:15] means to bring something back from the
[1:10:17] dead to revive something
[1:10:21] so why did I say you shouldn't need
[1:10:23] Revival because you ought to already be
[1:10:26] revived
[1:10:27] but I half dead
[1:10:31] preach with me tonight is that the truth
[1:10:34] we ought to be everybody brother man
[1:10:36] says you should I constantly live in
[1:10:38] Revival
[1:10:44] laughs amen
[1:10:47] you know I you know
[1:10:50] the one thing about it you know the one
[1:10:52] thing about
[1:10:54] revivals like a Souza Street people who
[1:10:57] stayed after service one of the things
[1:10:59] that Asbury and those students did after
[1:11:01] service was over they stayed
[1:11:03] they stayed and they stayed till 12.
[1:11:06] they said to one to two to three to four
[1:11:08] to five not one week two weeks but then
[1:11:12] state
[1:11:16] and I was told even over back way back
[1:11:19] in the Azusa Street it was the Segway
[1:11:21] that just stayed they stayed amen and
[1:11:23] they would have three services a day 24
[1:11:26] 7.
[1:11:28] I just didn't have a week after week
[1:11:30] after week three services a day how
[1:11:32] would you and I even last and all that
[1:11:36] right
[1:11:37] think about it and I thought about it
[1:11:39] and they said the sings and songs back
[1:11:41] then I guess I from an understanding
[1:11:43] it's probably the Church of God and
[1:11:45] where they've been decided not to have
[1:11:47] any music because from what I understand
[1:11:48] if I didn't misunderstand is that they
[1:11:51] didn't have any musical instruments it
[1:11:52] was just the people singing
[1:11:54] and I think the Church of God is the one
[1:11:56] that don't believe in musical
[1:11:57] instruments and Pentecostal Church of
[1:11:59] God you know no musical instruments you
[1:12:01] know which we know that there's no real
[1:12:02] scripture for it ain't that right
[1:12:05] because we like our musical instruments
[1:12:08] I like my drums I like my guitar I like
[1:12:10] my strings I like to play it on the eye
[1:12:12] string you know I like to play it on the
[1:12:14] high notes like like David said
[1:12:16] playing on the High Street worshiping
[1:12:18] the hard spring
[1:12:22] that's the way I believe in worshiping
[1:12:24] God
[1:12:25] Amen on the high notes I believe in and
[1:12:28] you know
[1:12:29] amen praise the Lord Brother Now give me
[1:12:33] a picture brother amen
[1:12:36] I mean those Focus I get older I realize
[1:12:39] that that scripture means more to me
[1:12:40] that all of those voices and all of
[1:12:42] those Powers came down and they
[1:12:44] worshiped God and said he's worthy of
[1:12:46] honor he's worthy of Glory he's worthy
[1:12:49] of power because as I lose my power and
[1:12:52] my strength I realize he has all power
[1:12:54] he has all strengths he's worthy of
[1:12:57] honor he's worthy of praying people are
[1:13:00] scream at ball games and everything else
[1:13:01] and worship all of that amen give
[1:13:03] players and the hell am I to players
[1:13:06] that can do great things with footballs
[1:13:08] until I'm up and down and then just test
[1:13:10] jump from the three point line perhaps
[1:13:14] go up in the air and come down and dunk
[1:13:16] the ball and Michael Jordan or they'll
[1:13:18] get him all by at that time
[1:13:27] no I'm not angry I'm just
[1:13:30] seriously come on folks they worship the
[1:13:33] creation more than the Creator what
[1:13:35] about the man that made a man to be able
[1:13:37] to do no things don't you think you
[1:13:39] ought to have a little honor have a
[1:13:41] little yeah I think he does I think he's
[1:13:43] worthy of a whole lot more honor and
[1:13:45] more Glory than what we give him
[1:13:48] that's why David wasn't afraid to strip
[1:13:50] off his clothes almost and dance before
[1:13:52] the garden and amen act the fool for him
[1:13:54] Thomas and I'm a fool for Christ I don't
[1:13:57] care I foolish I look
[1:13:59] I do it for Christ
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:19] time
[1:14:21] should stop a little
[1:14:23] when you have eternity coming out
[1:14:26] the presence of Eternity coming now
[1:14:28] forget about the clock
[1:14:31] so many times we come to church and by
[1:14:34] the end of the service we're starting
[1:14:36] the other end you know it's starting to
[1:14:37] lose it up all right it's time to close
[1:14:40] man we are just starting to have a good
[1:14:42] time
[1:14:44] folks when we was getting intoxicated on
[1:14:47] the world with uh juices and so forth
[1:14:49] we'd go to the next bar if this one
[1:14:50] closed isn't that right
[1:14:52] we gonna find the neck before five
[1:14:54] o'clock we were still out there doing
[1:14:56] something
[1:14:57] come on folks listen think about it so
[1:14:59] the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit comes
[1:15:01] out and people get locked like I said
[1:15:04] they would sing and they'd talk about an
[1:15:06] Angelic choir joining in with them
[1:15:13] I want you to know something people that
[1:15:15] can't can't see God and don't see God
[1:15:19] they don't look for him
[1:15:21] because that was God
[1:15:23] that was God
[1:15:24] amen and that was just the beginning of
[1:15:27] the great Revival
[1:15:28] how many knows it was just the beginning
[1:15:30] Asus Street was just a small fraction of
[1:15:32] the real Revival
[1:15:33] we know what happened with all of that
[1:15:35] and even the father God said this here
[1:15:36] this message that's been going forth you
[1:15:38] know it's been 15 years and it is still
[1:15:40] going
[1:15:42] I mean please hit the message in this
[1:15:43] hour it don't stop amen this revival
[1:15:46] ain't doing higher and it don't quit
[1:15:49] really
[1:15:51] Glory
[1:15:53] hey man so it's an atmosphere of
[1:15:56] Eternity
[1:15:57] and think about it hear their scripture
[1:15:59] that I read to you and the point that I
[1:16:01] wanted to make which we know as our
[1:16:03] prophet and I taught us that those four
[1:16:05] Beast Powers represent sending four
[1:16:08] powers lion was Paul's age isn't that
[1:16:12] right the ox was the martyrs that give
[1:16:15] their lives and boy the burden of giving
[1:16:17] their lives down through the dark ages
[1:16:19] of Thirteen hundred fourteen hundred
[1:16:21] fifteen hundred twelve nine eight seven
[1:16:23] all of those hundreds of years that they
[1:16:25] had the 68 million Christians that were
[1:16:28] killed ruthlessly by the Catholic church
[1:16:30] in that writing by the Pope
[1:16:36] the second beast and the third piece was
[1:16:38] the face of a man amen that was John
[1:16:41] Wesleyan or the the Reformation that we
[1:16:44] came forth and amen man was man
[1:16:46] spreading the word but the last power
[1:16:49] was an eagle age
[1:16:51] it was an eagle power you can't operate
[1:16:54] I can't operate I can't preach other
[1:16:57] than what the inspiration of the Holy
[1:16:59] Ghost gives me to preach I'm a steel and
[1:17:03] dry and rotten and no good as anything
[1:17:05] if anything for the power of the Holy
[1:17:06] Ghost
[1:17:09] but there was an eagle age calling up
[1:17:12] higher than anything
[1:17:18] amen and those four powers
[1:17:21] if you'll notice
[1:17:23] amen those four powers are there
[1:17:26] and I thought about this and this maybe
[1:17:28] I shouldn't even say it but I guess I
[1:17:30] will for just for anyhow because I think
[1:17:31] you can take it but I didn't know there
[1:17:33] was night over there did you
[1:17:39] I didn't know there was night over there
[1:17:43] so I don't know if there is or not I'll
[1:17:44] leave that to your mind your question
[1:17:46] but to me
[1:17:48] it's a and not in other words they never
[1:17:53] quit
[1:17:56] it does something that when a real
[1:17:57] believer gets in the presence of God
[1:17:58] it's hard to quit
[1:18:02] it's sad and you gotta go home and go to
[1:18:05] bed it's sad when you gotta go to work I
[1:18:09] mean those one of these days we'll never
[1:18:10] have to go back to work we'll never have
[1:18:12] to get that old alarm and I got to get
[1:18:13] back to work release that or the other
[1:18:15] we can be that into God's presence and
[1:18:17] why worship him through eternity
[1:18:21] it's what we are going to do if you
[1:18:24] don't think so read Revelations I heard
[1:18:26] the boys the mighty thunderings praising
[1:18:29] and worshiping God it was like thunder
[1:18:33] the voice of much people's Hallelujah
[1:18:37] honor and Glory
[1:18:39] and Power
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:45] that's what we're gonna do
[1:18:48] starting now
[1:18:50] huh if you ain't worshiped like you
[1:18:53] ought to don't wait till tomorrow start
[1:18:57] now
[1:19:00] what if we go on till 1 2 o'clock
[1:19:02] tonight
[1:19:04] um
[1:19:12] I like when I can be myself
[1:19:14] folks I'm here to tell you if I push it
[1:19:17] and we stay here too long you are going
[1:19:19] to be miserable
[1:19:21] when is she ever gonna quit that's what
[1:19:23] you're gonna be saying
[1:19:25] he says holding us because he wants to
[1:19:27] hold us
[1:19:29] and that's what it would be
[1:19:32] huh
[1:19:34] but if he would come down
[1:19:36] if that you kind of Glory come down
[1:19:39] hey every time those of us we just
[1:19:41] forget about time
[1:19:42] it'd be a whole different story
[1:19:45] because I as a preacher don't believe in
[1:19:47] manufacturing something
[1:19:49] no it has to be done by the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] hey man I looked at that people that
[1:19:56] would try they would pray for a for four
[1:19:59] hours they would pray so many times and
[1:20:00] then what did they do amen they put
[1:20:03] themselves
[1:20:04] for eight hours a day to pray
[1:20:08] how about you working for the four
[1:20:10] o'clock and when you get home at five
[1:20:11] you're gonna pray all the way until
[1:20:13] almost midnight just pray and pray and
[1:20:15] pray and pray
[1:20:17] to get into the presence of God to get
[1:20:20] yourself all really good and scoured out
[1:20:21] cause blessings are the hungry for they
[1:20:24] shall be filled
[1:20:27] how many believe that
[1:20:29] oh my I believe it
[1:20:33] I didn't even look at my notes tonight
[1:20:35] y'all are really pulling hard
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:40] you love the Lord tonight
[1:20:42] but that atmosphere
[1:20:44] oh that atmosphere you know
[1:20:49] I like to scream and shout and jump and
[1:20:51] dance but most of the time when that she
[1:20:53] kind of Glory comes out it is a sacred
[1:20:55] it is a different
[1:20:57] it is different this is this is Joy
[1:21:00] Bells
[1:21:01] amen but when that comes it
[1:21:04] says sacred thing because it's God
[1:21:07] himself
[1:21:08] coming down
[1:21:10] and you lose track of time you don't

[1:24:49] just something new
[1:24:50] one of the points I want to break now I
[1:24:52] want to talk about that chicane Glory
[1:24:54] living in that Chicana Glory
[1:25:00] three places people live this is back
[1:25:03] something a lot of us have heard before
[1:25:04] but we know that this was set up in the
[1:25:06] Old Testament this is the way to Israel
[1:25:08] the camp of Israel was set up
[1:25:11] there are three tribes on each side
[1:25:13] three six nine twelve Twelve Tribes all
[1:25:16] around there protecting this first this
[1:25:19] uh Tabernacle in the wilderness in the
[1:25:21] middle and when you first come in there
[1:25:23] was this labor here amen that's where
[1:25:25] your sacrifice for your sin amen would
[1:25:28] be brought amen and it would be burnt
[1:25:30] right there and taken care of you
[1:25:31] represented the Justified man isn't that
[1:25:34] right then we come over to the water
[1:25:35] you'd get washed and then in the third
[1:25:37] place you'd come in here and here would
[1:25:41] be that the holies amen it had the seven
[1:25:44] candlesticks notice how the seven
[1:25:46] candlesticks we read in Revelations
[1:25:48] he's at the seventh candle six or the
[1:25:50] seven spirits of God and amen that
[1:25:52] represented these candlesticks and so
[1:25:54] forth there was some different things
[1:25:56] the table
[1:25:57] of shoe bread and the angels and so
[1:25:59] forth but there was another place and it
[1:26:00] was all the way back here the Ark of the
[1:26:03] Covenant was amen and there was
[1:26:05] cherubims over the ark Amen in that
[1:26:07] manner that had fell down in the
[1:26:09] wilderness they put it in there
[1:26:11] Amen to that manner right in there
[1:26:13] stayed fresh all the time
[1:26:16] Glory
[1:26:20] we're going to talk about those three
[1:26:21] different places
[1:26:22] three different stages three different
[1:26:24] places people live
[1:26:27] now a prophet taught us that we live
[1:26:29] like in a three-room house
[1:26:31] living room kitchen in the bedroom
[1:26:34] and also he talked about that we're
[1:26:35] going through different stages to under
[1:26:37] Luther it was justification
[1:26:38] understanding and the rest it was
[1:26:40] sanctification and then in Pentecost and
[1:26:42] so forth with the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:43] Ghost he says the Holy Ghost makes a way
[1:26:45] for the Holy Ghost himself
[1:26:49] amen those be places
[1:26:53] Martin Luther smoke a pipe back a little
[1:26:55] mirror maybe just then it is out of the
[1:26:57] other he was just testified he was in
[1:26:59] that state and he lived out in the
[1:27:01] outside world Amen whenever it rained
[1:27:03] out
[1:27:05] if it rained guess what you got wet it

[1:27:37] wants it is another hour to waver
[1:27:42] amen this is an hour We're called to
[1:27:46] come into the holies of holies this is
[1:27:47] for us
[1:27:48] even the Pentecostals didn't come into
[1:27:50] here they were too busy fighting and
[1:27:52] fussing with one another
[1:27:54] by the weather he was coming on a white
[1:27:55] horse or a

[1:28:43] the greatest place in the world it's so
[1:28:46] phenomenal those people for three years

[1:29:16] atmosphere you can take a dog or you can
[1:29:18] take a chicken egg and you put it in a
[1:29:21] hatchery and you keep that at a certain
[1:29:23] temperature isn't that right that
[1:29:25] certain temperature will hatch that
[1:29:26] cheek
[1:29:28] amen or if you laid that if you laid
[1:29:30] that egg under a dog and kept that right
[1:29:31] temperature he would hatch chickens
[1:29:34] but that's the way it is with almighty
[1:29:36] God and bringing four Sons and Daughters
[1:29:38] of God it takes the atmosphere the Holy
[1:29:40] Ghost

[1:30:09] but we're Mortals yet we still have to
[1:30:11] do our jobs we have to supply for our
[1:30:13] families and all that in there we we
[1:30:15] have to do all that but today will come
[1:30:17] where we'll not do it for three years
[1:30:19] now we'll do it throughout all of
[1:30:21] eternity
[1:30:22] there's oh you can't imagine what it's
[1:30:25] gonna be like
[1:30:29] amen

[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:41] listen to what he says every time a
[1:30:43] little something new happens here then
[1:30:45] you go to somewhere else
[1:30:48] new thing why don't you just come to
[1:30:50] Christ and settle the whole thing
[1:30:52] once born again that settles it forever
[1:30:55] once born of the spirit of God you have
[1:30:58] everlasting life and cannot come into
[1:31:00] the condemnation isn't that right
[1:31:03] but has passed from Death unto life then
[1:31:07] you can enjoy yourself
[1:31:10] then it's pleasure it's a pleasure to
[1:31:13] pray
[1:31:16] you don't have to wonder about whether
[1:31:17] what God's doing when you kneel to pray
[1:31:20] you're right in his presence when you
[1:31:22] walk into the streets you're right in
[1:31:24] his presence wherever you are you're in

[1:31:43] but I love to challenge myself
[1:31:46] oh my what a marvelous Victorious Life
[1:31:51] and this is what got to thinking about
[1:31:53] a statement he made he says Hey halfway
[1:31:56] life is the most miserable thing there
[1:32:00] is
[1:32:04] to play
[1:32:05] just enough Justin of religion to know
[1:32:08] that if you ain't right you're gonna be
[1:32:09] thrown at your Lake of Fire
[1:32:11] nothing to scare you
[1:32:13] not to make
[1:32:15] him
[1:32:18] do that that's what religion generally
[1:32:21] takes teaches yeah but if that's all you
[1:32:25] have you're miserable halfway is a
[1:32:27] miserable life
[1:32:29] let me ask you
[1:32:30] something what's lukewarm lukewarm is
[1:32:33] halfway isn't it
[1:32:35] in between hot or cold even Jesus says I
[1:32:38] would that you were hot or cold so that
[1:32:40] because you are lukewarm because you are
[1:32:42] halfway I will feel you out of my mouth
[1:32:46] folks if you're a Halfway Christian just
[1:32:48] halfway living a crazy life you're a
[1:32:51] miserable person

[1:33:05] Sanctified state
[1:33:07] but never baptized with the Holy Ghost

[1:33:12] that totally takes care of all of your
[1:33:14] problems
[1:33:17] yeah
[1:33:18] I mean that's what I feel like my
[1:33:20] Ministry
[1:33:23] it's to get us to come up higher
[1:33:26] we as Christians to go much deeper than
[1:33:28] what we are

[1:47:09] they all pardon me I need to tie my shoe
[1:47:16] you love the Lord
[1:47:18] miserable miserable people
[1:47:21] why
[1:47:22] let me ask let me say this
[1:47:26] not half
[1:47:28] but the prophet preached the Bible says
[1:47:31] that full obedience to the full word of
[1:47:34] God entitles you to the Token full
[1:47:37] obedience
[1:47:41] so if you're not blessed
[1:47:43] God could never fully bless Abraham
[1:47:45] until he did what God Said do separate
[1:47:48] yourself from your daddy and from your I
[1:47:50] mean from your nephew lot
[1:47:52] separate yourself come on out but he
[1:47:54] brought them with them in his office
[1:47:55] they were there Abraham and his servants
[1:47:58] were miserable they probably almost got
[1:48:01] in a fist fight
[1:48:02] at the water fountain it says there was
[1:48:05] Strife between their herdsmen
[1:48:10] how many knows whenever there's belief
[1:48:12] and I'm believing dwelling together
[1:48:13] there's gonna be some mystery
[1:48:16] misery
[1:48:19] that's why we don't need any unbelief in
[1:48:20] the church
[1:48:21] you let unbelief in getting one of you
[1:48:23] and it's going to cause misery to this
[1:48:25] church
[1:48:26] you're gonna cause misery to somebody
[1:48:27] because you're gonna
[1:48:29] try to spread
[1:48:32] misery
[1:48:34] you know so we thought they just ain't
[1:48:36] quite right
[1:48:38] huh
[1:48:40] all right get off that
[1:48:43] I want you happy
[1:48:45] be happy
[1:48:47] I want you free
[1:48:52] I'm here to tell you if you don't get
[1:48:53] the anchor of Jesus Christ in your heart
[1:48:55] you're going to be tossed all over the
[1:48:57] place
[1:48:58] your feelings and your emotions
[1:49:02] your desires that your flesh has I'll
[1:49:04] take you all over the place
[1:49:07] but Christ anchors that thing and brings
[1:49:09] it down Center washes you from all of
[1:49:12] your sins you ain't got to worry about
[1:49:13] hell you ain't got to worry about the
[1:49:15] great white Throne judgment you're not
[1:49:17] even gonna be in it the Bible says that
[1:49:19] James Saints are going to be doing the
[1:49:21] judge don't you know that the Saints
[1:49:23] shall judge the world he comes with ten
[1:49:26] thousand thousand Saints the Bible says
[1:49:28] to execute judgment on those Wicked
[1:49:33] oh my how can you hold your seat
[1:49:37] divided you guys are saying ain't got to
[1:49:39] worry about the judgment
[1:49:41] you're going to call me be with Christ
[1:49:43] in the judgment
[1:49:46] that's there for now no condemnation to
[1:49:48] them to learn cry how can you judge
[1:49:50] somebody that ain't no condemnation
[1:49:57] he knew the sun sets free as free indeed
[1:50:01] we got too many people that are still
[1:50:02] slaves they're slaves to their job
[1:50:04] they're slaves to time they're changed
[1:50:07] some money just leaves to love the
[1:50:08] slaves to their homes and their Entre
[1:50:10] all kinds of slaves
[1:50:15] constrains to themselves
[1:50:18] man something else I had in mind wrote
[1:50:21] down that is the reason people are
[1:50:23] halfway is because most of a lot of
[1:50:25] Christians
[1:50:26] so-called want to serve two masters
[1:50:30] you want to serve two men and you can't
[1:50:31] do that Jesus said
[1:50:33] but they want to be the church they want
[1:50:35] to be a Christian they want to make it
[1:50:36] to heaven but yet they want to do their
[1:50:38] own thing
[1:50:39] all right and your own thinks the devil
[1:50:42] thing
[1:50:43] it's got to be Christ and what he says
[1:50:45] are you with me
[1:50:46] Lords let's serve one master
[1:50:49] and that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:53] amen I'm starting to get too worried
[1:50:56] about the time now but that's all right
[1:51:00] all right praise the Lord God is the
[1:51:02] Shekinah Glory
[1:51:04] don't you realize that preaching and you
[1:51:07] pulling brings the presence of God down
[1:51:10] when we sing those songs we're marching
[1:51:14] design and beautiful beautiful Zion God

[1:58:53] devil can't get you
[1:58:56] I've got a scripture for it let me just
[1:58:57] read
[1:58:59] first John 5 and verse 18 we know that
[1:59:01] whosoever born of God sent us not but he
[1:59:04] that is begotten of God keepeth himself
[1:59:06] and that Wicked one touches him not
[1:59:17] can anybody say Amen
[1:59:19] [Applause]
[1:59:21] now we all said amen and that's good
[1:59:24] but we still have a little growing that
[1:59:26] you don't
[1:59:27] see sometimes
[1:59:31] he don't touch me you know what when
[1:59:34] you're a Christian you're still with the
[1:59:35] Holy Ghost the only way the devil can
[1:59:36] get to you
[1:59:37] is for you to come out behind that you
[1:59:39] kind of Glory
[1:59:40] you got to come out to him
[1:59:42] a lot of times Temptation the Bible says
[1:59:44] you're drawn away from Temptation and so
[1:59:46] forth
[1:59:49] amen
[1:59:51] drawing away you come out
[1:59:54] you let that thought like Phil Bond
[1:59:57] he said you let that thought in you're
[2:00:00] the one that let it live he didn't
[2:00:02] but if you I don't know about you but I
[2:00:04] want to be like that I want to hear the
[2:00:05] devil can't touch you
[2:00:07] no matter what comes no matter what goes
[2:00:09] he can't get to you
[2:00:12] because he sure wants to
[2:00:15] amen
[2:00:17] now notice
[2:00:19] if you ever come into Christ my friend
[2:00:20] ever come into the place where the world
[2:00:22] is dead
[2:00:23] whether your children are this way or
[2:00:25] your mother is that way or your daddy
[2:00:27] said this way or your pastor said that
[2:00:30] oh come on folks let's admit it
[2:00:32] sometimes as you think the devil I mean
[2:00:34] that devil the pastor is the devil
[2:00:36] talking to you or something
[2:00:38] oh boy he was preaching at me
[2:00:40] folks if I ever preach directly at
[2:00:42] somebody then I need another trip to the
[2:00:45] altar I preach against sin and if it
[2:00:47] follows your lot I can't help that
[2:00:49] but it's the devil's business to get on
[2:00:51] your shoulder and make you feel like
[2:00:53] that was personally to you and I'd give
[2:00:55] you an attitude about it don't let the
[2:00:57] devil do that
[2:00:58] no matter what the pastor said what the
[2:01:00] doctor said this that or the other you
[2:01:02] don't even hear it you live only in the
[2:01:05] Shekinah Glory love walking and living
[2:01:08] in the presence of the king every day is
[2:01:11] sweet in your soul oh my all is well all
[2:01:14] is well there's nothing that can harm
[2:01:16] you
[2:01:18] oh my praise be to God aren't you glad
[2:01:20] for that
[2:01:21] reasons we're not getting anywhere today
[2:01:23] is because we got too many dry eye
[2:01:25] confessions and church joinings too much
[2:01:27] lukewarmness backslitness church members
[2:01:31] that's the truth we need more of that
[2:01:33] old-fashioned Holy Ghost godsend Saint
[2:01:36] Paul Revival and the holy ghost power of
[2:01:38] breaking up and me making people act
[2:01:40] different look different walk different
[2:01:43] talk different and be different
[2:01:46] and live different
[2:01:48] in their day every day life
[2:01:53] are you with me
[2:01:55] I think that's what's the matter with
[2:01:56] our church today we got a lot of these
[2:01:58] different layovers some people just eat
[2:02:01] enough Mana to make them good and hungry
[2:02:02] for some more before one Revival to
[2:02:04] another one and you have to go out and
[2:02:06] get all renewed again
[2:02:09] huh
[2:02:11] oh brother why don't you stop that
[2:02:13] nonsense and come into the holies of
[2:02:14] holies by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:16] every bit of men are outside of here
[2:02:18] just let you last for tonight or
[2:02:20] tomorrow or next week it won't work it
[2:02:22] dries up overnight but if you'll ever
[2:02:23] consecrate yourself to come into where
[2:02:25] the Mana stays friend
[2:02:27] mistake in and they out here in and year
[2:02:32] out in the holies of holies I don't care
[2:02:34] if you just simply preach about the
[2:02:36] gospel amen of Jesus Christ died on
[2:02:38] Calvary for me amen it's still fresh and
[2:02:40] it's still good to you you'll never say
[2:02:42] oh I heard that before you'll say tell
[2:02:44] it to me again brother
[2:02:47] why because it's fresh
[2:02:50] but if you're not in that holies of
[2:02:51] holies oh my is he gonna preach that
[2:02:53] again he preached that 30 years ago he
[2:02:57] preached at 15 years ago 20 years ago 22
[2:03:00] years ago 10 years ago five years ago
[2:03:03] a year ago nice preaching it again
[2:03:07] you're right I'm gonna keep preaching
[2:03:09] until we get to the place we need to be
[2:03:12] oh it's still good I love it don't you
[2:03:15] to know that you can come to this place
[2:03:16] we are honored come into the presence of
[2:03:19] God you couldn't come there before
[2:03:21] we know that God those cherubim says
[2:03:24] Shield them from coming back into the
[2:03:25] presence of God In the Garden of Eden
[2:03:27] but when Jesus Christ died he says come
[2:03:28] on back into my presence now come on the
[2:03:31] home children
[2:03:33] living my presence not just on church on
[2:03:36] day Sundays and Wednesdays some of that

[2:05:05] doesn't bear any fruits there's nothing
[2:05:07] in their life they seem to be helpless
[2:05:09] hopeless and wander along just knowing
[2:05:11] that they belong to a church and that's
[2:05:13] not only Presbyterian and Lutheran
[2:05:14] that's Pentecostals can we say that's
[2:05:16] message people too that's right it's the
