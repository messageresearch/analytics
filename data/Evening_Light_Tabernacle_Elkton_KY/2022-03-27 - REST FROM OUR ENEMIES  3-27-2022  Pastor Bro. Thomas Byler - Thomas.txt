[Music] [Music] mud [Music] please [Music] [Music] great [Music] jesus that you give us [Music] fighting foreign first thing we heard before that's what's going to be [Music] um okay um [Music] my [Music] my mouth my health oh [Music] uh i was on that bible application this morning too and then the description for the daily devotional was at first uh we got shot really well but the first one that's not what i thought everyone's out to take care of themselves and whether uh whatever happens it doesn't make no difference you know that the scriptures talk about that that could be time um and that's the difference between christians and everyone [Music] it has to be you know reading god's word sometimes this is the right way to go you know sometimes you keep watching to see what you'll do and i'll just read this chapter here the spirit of the lord god is upon me and everyone knows the church of jesus but i was just going to read this whole chapter this morning the spirit of the lord god was upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good find out the times arms praying liberty to the catholics and the opening of the christians to them that are bound to that that scripture approached this morning anyone in this place is born can be free this morning [Music] into that point this morning and you don't want to be there for it and it goes on to accord respond to them and mourn desire to give on to them an oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit and the desolations of many generations and restrictions will stand to be your loss and the sons of aliens will be your flounder in your mind that ye shall be named the fruit of the lord man shall call you the ministers of god and you shall eat the rich of the gentiles from their lord so you lose yourself so the scripture is talking about the crime we're about to go into right now you're saying you shall not help them [Music] actually doing the same thing and there's seeds will be known about the income and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge that they may better receive which will lower that's what i was very very joyful my soul should be joyful and my god for he has called me with the garments of salvation and he has covered me with the resurrection of god on adorns him for the earth bring us forth our blood that the garden causes things that are shown in the spring forest so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all nations [Applause] um december 19 1954 and i'll just leave you closer oh and oh i have received and that goes back by saying earlier have you really received that penalizer in the heart this morning if you receive jesus you receive something that tells you that when the word of god is inspired he is the same lord jesus tonight performing and doing the very same things that he said he would do and i hope i don't lose my voice he said he would do where you have to receive the lord [Music] to say not only that but you know and also all the devils in hell cannot take it away from why sure you believe it god has done say said son and son let us say the lord you thank your hopes right there you live and die you believe anyhow you're ready to show your testimony with your brother at any time and if you believe it's the truth you notice that god has said so and somehow [Music] that's the only thing about i know i say this a lot it's not being funny here but when people look on the outside they can't tell who you really are you know god knows who you are you know who you are this morning and what you really want to be is that genuine christian where the love of god actually combines like today you know i say brother says so just believe what god and you're loading with all bless you this morning it's good to be in the house store let's stand this morning if we could and hey man let's sing that little course if we could all as well this morning oh amen you believe that with all your heart amen [Music] [Music] we have heard the message alone and all is well [Music] oh there is a place a perfect rest behind [Music] once again this morning oh all is [Music] we have heard the message [Music] there is a place [Music] little bright restless [Music] hey man i a friend of mine posted this quote this morning and i asked for the thomas if i could read it and then brother joe prayed and then brother brian he said some things in sunday school and it says now say to the church shalom god's peace peace every true hebrew written when he meets another one shalom other words good morning god be with you god peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but but good morning to the church this morning he said christ is appearing among us shalom praise hallelujah shalom when we see the darkness settling darkness just before the day we know that the morning star is hanging yonder to introduce the coming sun it's that when this morning star shines it's it's it's it's the going between it's always darkness just a few minutes before day the black out comes the moon fails to shine the darkness before days because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom amen and i i thought lord what a hour that we live in the darkness on every hand but you know what there's no darkness here this morning it's light because of him this morning and amen and i just i said lord what an awesome hour to live you know they say well look at the days gone by yes but

springing back from something probably right amen so god is good amen we're so grateful to have a wonderful god i was thinking this morning again i said you know i sure liked brother branham's statement where he said when he made that statement he said i just don't know what i do if i wasn't a christian amen it is so good to be a christian amen you'd be in a whole lot of trouble if you wouldn't be amen and so it's just good to know the great love of almighty god amen and so god bless each and every one of you richly this morning amen and looking forward to the warmer weather coming right around the corner here now amen praise the lord amen we do plan on i will just give you our itinerary according to the will of the lord you know the bible says if the lord will we'll do this saturday amen and so me and my wife i'm taking a little trip next weekend after next morning next sunday morning serve preaching the next three services and then i'll be absent for a couple of more and we plan just taking a little trip that'd be all right and it'll be her birthday and uh the second is all her birthday april the second and amen so we're just gonna go and have some time god bless you amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you this morning once again lord assembling ourselves together knowing lord jesus that you have not forsaken your people father you're going to stick with them all the way until the rapture all the way until the time that you catch us out of here lord jesus just before destruction of the world and lord we know that your bride will not have any part of the destruction or the judgments that fall and we're just looking and preparing ourselves as we gather together every time we gather we inspect ourselves we examine ourselves lord to see if we're ready to meet you lord jesus and whether that will be a time of glory or not lord and as paul said you know he has a crown of life waiting for all those who love his appearing lord that's what we look forward to it we're going to love your appearing appreciating be glad to see you father oh lord the whole creation has waited for this moment all the way from the time of adam and eve and and abel are looking for this time when we'll be united with you forever so shall we ever be with the lord and we just ask god that you prepare us this morning lord and bless the meditation of our heart and that which we feel you've laid upon our laid upon our hearts to minister this morning may it edify the body of christ for we ask it in your precious name the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen turn your bibles if you will and uh i want to i i was something the other day and this thought came to me and and i told my wife i says i believe the lord just gave me a a brand new message a message that i don't ever remember a preacher preaching and that i've never preached and i was like oh that sounds bad anything that new right oh my but anyway so i will just i'm sure somebody has before but it's uh the the main theme of it i have preached on many times but the title that i will use and kind of the thought will be a little bit different but it's found it's found in the 22nd chapter of first chronicles is where we want to start chronicles first quran equals 22. it was where david was wanting to build the house of the lord and i guess he got to bring a lot of the lumber and timbers and things together but the lord refused for him to build the house he said you know he's not going to build it because he said he's had too much blood on his hands because of all the people i guess that he's killed and so forth and he said but his son solomon would build it amen and so in chapter 22 of first chronicles and verse 7 will begin he says and all right got a little glitch there david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the lord my god but the word of lord came to me saying thou shalt thou has shed blood abundantly and has made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the earth in my sight behold a son shall be born unto thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all of his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days may god that is the reading of the words you can be seated amen and i want to take this thought and my title is going to be rest from our enemies rest from our enemies amen well y'all aren't too excited about that [Applause] [Laughter] amen you know and i got to thinking of how that we're in a battle you know and not the wars that we have and and the enemies that we face right amen and i on the way on the way to church you know i was trying to tell my wife uh you know that my title and i said peace with our enemies and just didn't quite sound right you know because you you have to have you have to have some kind of an agreement or something with an enemy to have peace with him right but not necessarily peace but just rest from it right rest from our enemies amen so i want to read a couple more if i can there's quite a few scriptures here and and i begin to think about that rest from our enemies because i got to thinking of how that different places that the bible talked about in the old testament how that the lord would actually give israel rest from their enemies okay over in estra if you want to go with me esther and this of course as you know uh haman i believe it was you know that tried to destroy the whole uh jewish nation he tried to destroy them all and i believe it's kind of a type of the satan now that he tries to destroy us isn't that right amen and of course because of esther and mordecai and the intercession that was done and so forth that mordecai and his sons ended up hanging on the gallows and they were the ones that ended up destroyed right you know and here towards the end of the book if you want to go with me in esther the ninth chapter um in verse 16 we'll start and we'll read the verse 22 but the other jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together and stood for the for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes 70 and 5 000 and they laid not their hands on the prey on the 13th the day of the month of ada month of adar and on the 14th day of the same rested day and they made a day of feasting and gladness praise the lord isn't that nice how many believes that whenever you are in a major battle with your enemies a good time to feast and rest and a time of gladness amen praise the lord you know brother david he asked me to if he could read that uh let that that quote about peace and shalom you know and i thought that's that's a good thing to do and i believe it was the first song that he sang was so rest little bride rest for all is well amen i like that word amen to rest and that's what we're going to focus on a little bit talk about peace we're going to talk about rest amen and gladness and i notice he says so they made a day of feasting and gladness but the jews that were in shusham shushan assembled together on the 13th day thereof and on the 14th there are thereof and on the 15th there a day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the 14th day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day amen how many can you some good days oh yeah i believe that we need good days we should appreciate good days we got enough bad days but it's nice here there was actually making a holiday of a good day and gladness and so forth and to send portions one to another and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in the provinces of the king hazaria some azarias yeah you probably won't know if i didn't spell it right so we'll just leave that alone right all right not spell it let's say it both nigh and far to stash this among them that they should keep the 14th day of the month eight hour and the fiftieth day of the same yearly i mean this is supposed to be done every year and as the days when the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy amen i don't know if you can read between the lines a little bit but how many knows that you've had a day when you've had a day that turned from sorrow to joy i kind of think that'd be a day that you got borned again the day that all your burdens were lifted and all your taskmasters amen they were dead and you didn't have to deal with them anymore oh i get so excited about this to think that the things that used to bother you don't bother you anymore glory it's long ago amen oh my i know the story says from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day oh my that they should make them days of feasting in joy praise the lord aren't you glad that god actually made all kinds of feast days but here he says he wants to make a day that you just feast and have joy the bible says the joy of the lord is our strength i believe that end of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor this is one place that you can find a place where the bible does talk about giving somebody a gift giving gifts to the poor let it be a time of rejoicing how many believe that's what it's going to be when all of this battle is over when we get over to glory land it is going to be a time of rejoicing and praising god and hell is a time of joy it just comes to my mind now if whenever the the angels came to bring the glad tidings of jesus that they said that they bring glad tidings of great joy the bible says that the joy that you and i experience it's joy unspeakable and full of glory amen don't you believe that this morning praise the lord god is good amen oh my hallelujah god is good again i'm so glad that god gives us that that place and a time to rest amen brother billy last one time he said something that took me kind of by surprise and i didn't know the bible had said it but as i was studying this message it came back to me you know he says that the bible says and i found it in proverbs 16 because it's just like he said verse 7 he says when a man's ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him now how many knows that in the days of the judges of the bible we remember in those days that every time that israel would get away from the lord the lord would sick his enemies on them and they'd become slaves to their enemies they torment him and they do everything else i want to know this but i'm so glad that we serve a god that's god's control of our enemies he controls him if he wants to sink him on you he will sick him on you if you want to get away from god and to have to deal with the chastisement almighty god all you got to do is get away from god a little bit amen i'll tell you you'll become tormented you'll become sad you'll have a long night you'll just have the worst day of your life i'm so glad that we can walk with the lord every day and then we've got a shepherd that watches over us i don't want him just a sunday morning experience i have an experience every day of walking with him and seeing him dealing with me and blessing me and helping this to go good to help me to have a good day every day with jesus is greater than the day before amen we just don't realize what we got folks no wonder no wonder the prophet said that we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth we ought to have the more joy than anybody else out there we should have exceeding great joy that's what he come for i bring you tidings of exchanging great joy no wonder a couple of young people can get so happy in the lord they get got to stop their car on the side of the road amen they don't care who she is i'm dancing hallelujah praise be almighty god why because the taste of the lord that's what we need oh my good old-fashioned pentecostal experience [Applause] oh my that's what we need you got to have that pentecost is not a denomination pentecost is an experience and every song that comes everybody that comes got to have a pentecostal experience you don't know what it's like to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and to be able to sing i know you you ask me why i'm happy and i don't mind telling you why because my sins are gone they're underneath the blood on the cross of calvary so far removed amen as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god's forgetfulness aren't you glad this morning amen praise be to god this morning how many knows life in itself is hard it's hard it's a battle it's stress it's a burden it's weight [Music] right amen and it it's pressure as the prophet of god said people everywhere are under pressure he said the enemy is coming down upon people and making them do that the things that they don't even really want to do but it just makes them do it amen it's the age that we're living in and have to deal with that pressure having to deal with the battle that comes with everyday life the cares of life amen it's so bad any more days until if you really don't have parents that teach you of the hardships of life amen and what you've got to do and and teach you good you grow up and you really don't know how to function that's our millennials that's the kids that are out there nowadays tearing our cities down kids that didn't have parents who would help them didn't have teachers to teach them right i actually taught them wrong huh so you see why the puppet of god said it'll be annihilated it'll become extinct in a generation or two you won't you know won't you won't be able to function because of the pressures that come along with it but aren't you glad this morning that there's somewhere you can go i'm so glad that you can get rest i want to tell you something right now one of the main main things that that your desire and people desire to have in life is peace and rest and joy and comfort i know there's a big word said really fast but in detail people want to be comforted they want to have and that's why jesus he was said i'm going to send you the comforter because he knew where the stake that we were in he knew the battles that you and i were he knew that the enemy that was within that you're born with this flesh that is the real enemy [Applause] praise be the god the desires of this flesh the lusts of this flesh amen that's your biggest enemy all right so now let's look because i'm here to tell you oh my because peace and rest go hand in hand isn't that right when you're not at war you're at peace and you're resting amen and let me just say this the bible says that if a man's ways please the lord he will cause his enemies to be at peace with him amen i'll say it this way that if you do what the lord says he will give you his peace because that's the ways that you got to have to receive this rest from your enemies is to do what god said do is that right when you adhere to the lord do what he says amen and give your life to him then he will give you peace from your enemies oh i like this because jesus said in matthew 11 28 he says come on to me are you that labor and our heavy laden we are living with this world this heavy lady it's got a heavy load it's burdened it's stressed it's not full of gladness oh my do them people that got all those nose rings and earrings and that do they look happy to you no no they don't look happy they don't have the smile they're burdened they're they're captured it's an evil wicked hairy demon that makes them do those things it makes so many torches and oh man it'll make them do all kinds of things just to try to feel a little better try to feel better about themselves or try to feel important huh oh my because that's what they want and i listen that are heavy laden and i will give you rest i don't know if anybody can live consistently constantly under a battle condition can you imagine living in a home where the husband and the five for the wife were constantly fighting huh folks i find me another house or what it's like for a man to live with a contentious woman oh here we go and down here where we live what does the bible say where is it better to live than to live with a contentious woman on the rooftop i think it said better to live on the roof let me get up on the roof why because nobody likes that kind of atmosphere nobody likes a battling and fighting and fussing and streaming a stressful atmosphere it's not the atmosphere that got meant for us to be in no i can't even tell you how many times now the god of peace keep you not a god of peace not the god of peace and keep you keep your hearts and so forth all through the new testament all over the place amen the whole kingdom of god even the very kingdom of god is paul said not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost that's all kingdom that's what it's all about to have peace in your heart to have rest in your heart to be at rest god worked seven days six days and on the seventh day rested that whole sabbath day the whole thing was a type it was a symbol of a great thing that you and i were going to have need of that's rest because he would have battle it was going to be hot he knew there was going to be some bunch of enemies coming after you and that you were going to have to fight a bunch of wars huh there's going to be a lot of battles but praise be to god when those battles end huh and you get a little rest from those battles amen brother troy shaking his head he knows what a long hard battle is amen all of us a lot of us know what a long hard battle is it's a wonder it's a wonder we can keep our seats sometimes or i can keep from running up and around here why because you also appreciate what god does for you you love him this morning oh my i will give you rest take my yoke upon me and learn to me for i am meek and lowly in heart and here he uses the word again and he shall find rest unto your souls he's not necessarily dealing with your flat sheet dealing with your soul because that's what a burden is huh it's in your soul all right isaiah 14 i think it's the last scripture he says the bible about the scripture says there is no rest saith the lord for the wicked right here it is not 14 the last verse hold on all right i have somewhere in there okay but that's what he says he said that there is no rest for the wicked there is no peace for the wicked i mean believe that but look at the world you think i have peace no what is this what is these battles that's going on in ukraine and russia and so forth and you know all down to the 60s and south there's always been war afghanistan saudi arabia one after another brother bound says that's all that is it's a bunch of devils that get jealous of each other or they get greedy for land it's either greed or it's jealousy or it's envy or it's something it has to do with the devil and they never have peace but that's not for the child of god how he believes we have peace we have rest we don't have to be like that praise be to god i'm glad i am so glad let me tell you read your quote in the story brother bannon went and he made a sick call to a hospital one time there was a young lady that had gotten some kind of a disease and so forth and the doctors couldn't even do anything for her anymore she had taken some all kinds of different things they had given her up not no methods nothing they could do anything more medically and she had been as a child you know she had been part of the tabernacle i guess and she was going out to meet god just a child and i said sister do you remember on the cradle roll you were baptized into the fellowship of the cradler roll and said what was what what was the matter he said and she said brother branham i'll tell you said i just love the lord jesus but it's so hard to serve him now that is what i find around most christian lives most he says i hate to say it it's true that most people that profess christianity they just seem to have such a hard time struggling time to hold on yeah oh my i believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching there's no such thing as holding on he done the holding on he says the whole christian principle is based upon rest i don't like i said i preached it before but not in the context of it because listen based upon rest come unto me all ye labor and are heavy laden i will give you rest in other words you ain't got to struggle like that you don't have to fight like that oh my i believe the bible says one place that we are to labor to enter into this rest we're to struggle we're to battle but when we are done with the battle then we have fellowship that we have communion with god amen now again he says you don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all you're giving rest you enter into peace the whole thing is finished oh my when i think about it now that's what god was trying to get israel to get into that place of rest that place of rest we find it in hebrews we'll just go to hebrews right quick hebrews 4. let us therefore fear not well i actually go one scripture before that before the fourth chapter refuses the third chapter of hebrews and uh verse 17 we'll pick it up but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned and whose carcasses fell in the wilderness or disbelieved and this talks all all this chapter beforehand he talks about how he swore his wrath they would not enter into his rest so beware brothers unless there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but with whom was he greed forty years was it not with them that had sinned and his carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whoms were he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not now how many knows that is your real battle that is my real battle if you'll ever get past the fact that the devil will try to tell you all you ain't good enough to be a son of god ain't no we he chose you ain't no way you're the bride and for i said i've been christians a long time you've made mistakes in your past how many knows that the devil will try to tell you no your sin isn't really forgiven now you're still guilty so that he can have you sitting in your pew with a long face make you feel condemned but it's a lie how many knows it's under the blood god under the blood of jesus christ and all of the doubt and all of the unbelief you've gotta get away from that and if you ever break through that barrier of unbelief oh my sometimes it's supposed to happen about 12 13 14 years old that's when we're to break through but some kind of a spirit and when it gets on us it causes us not to get it when we're supposed to thank god for the young folks that get it that's 16 17 18 amen before they go too far because the problem of god said 80 or 90 of people that ever served god do it around the age of 18 through 20 or somewhere in there hello and otherwise they become what they become hello not the cop can't but listen so let's go on shall we that unbelief that's the real battle how many knows think about it before you ever come to this place before you ever come to this place of resting from your enemies and until you before you get to that place of rest for yourself there is certainly a real great battle that you have to do there is something that you have to overcome because how many knows that you know uh god is only going to share his throne to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me you have to be an overcomer oh my when i think about that i think about this i realize that all that are his like jesus said all the father has given me will come to me and i will lose none of them do you realize it's grace of god that gives you the ability to overcome unbelief write that in your book it's the grace of god that gives you the ability to overcome and to believe with all of your heart it's because you are his and he gives you that ability my that makes me want to run brother that might be on the shout to think it's his grace something that he placed in there you know what i like to do when the devil tries to tell me i'm not one of god's children i just point to that see that right there god had never done it if i wasn't his so shut up shut up praise be to god amen [Music] so the bible clearly tells us paul tells us he says let us fear therefore at least the promise being left of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as to them but the word preached to them did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which believe have believed do enter into rest brother does that mean all my troubles are over does that mean i'm not gonna anymore enemies attack me job sure did let me tell you something how many knows he was living it up his children were having a party drinking wine and having a party we don't do that nowadays but they did huh all in one house having a good day no problems the enemy was at bay are you with me i like i like it when the gods gotta hit you around me brother i like god's hitch i won't i won't pull no punch it's a whole lot better than when he learns to let he chooses to let me go through a trial huh it's a whole lot better and i'm here to tell you what does the bible say whenever the lord sends you a trial no it's not all it's not joyful not always joyful you know how many knows that with the holy ghost like it was with job or like it was with paul that though they were in the inner prison yet they sang songs why because when you come into this place it don't matter what comes your way you can still rest you can still know this one thing you ought to be happy this morning you know why because you know that when god has taken you and when he gives you that seal of the holy ghost that you are god's child anything that happens to you is allowed by god amen let me see if i can put it the way that the bible fits it just comes to mind brethren count it all joy it's hard to do come on folks count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations you know i was thinking this week of how the devil puts out there for the world and for young people all these all this this temptation very strong temptations very very strong temptation and i thought but you know what you know why god allowed that because if it wasn't this temptation it wouldn't be tempting right if it wasn't the temptation wouldn't be tempting it wouldn't even be a temptation it has to be tantalizing it has to be a temptation and he allowed that to give you strength to overcome diverse knowing this at the trying of your faith workers patience and let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting or lacking nothing amen praise the lord this is about hiding resting is about hiding hiding from your enemy getting into some place she can't find you the bible says that a believer ought to be in such a place that the wicked one is him not huh into a place that you can't be touched now notice in verse 13 he says let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither attempted to be any man but every man is tempted and drawn away from from away of his own lusts and enticed and when lust has conceived he bringeth for sin and sin when he is finished bring his forth death what does that tell me this scripture tells me that the devil can't come into you you have to get drawn away you've got to open the door go out to him and that's where he gets you i may believe lord let me shut in with god in that sacred place to where the devil can't touch you before you begin to meditate on too much of the wrong thought you got to let the thought come in huh that's why you got to open the door before you lose your peace before you lose before he robs you you gotta unlock the door you gotta go out to him that's if you're a real believer a real christian and trust me the devil is always looking how to push your button he's always he knows all of us he knows where our weak places are he knows where to push your button how to push your button oh the crazy part is it brother perry's a lot of times it's christians that's supposed to be christians that push your button they try to push your button because they want to see you upset they want to see you man and so they push your buttons and they're supposed to be christians ah that's the sad part i say yes an experienced preacher here a lot of us know huh and even i'm gonna get real down real to the nitty-gritty even some of us as christians we get backslid and we'll do that very same thing we'll get backslid because how about how how if i said that what if i don't come up here and say you ain't even believer you're you're you're you're not even a christian and i put a lot of us out there wouldn't it no but you can get backslid we all know you can get backslid to where you do things you gotta do and if you have done it and you know you did it well you got a job next week let's go make it right because that's the one thing a christian will do that's totally free folks that's just from him is that all right praise the lord yeah when he's tempted or when he opens that door to go out but we're supposed to be hidden our life is supposed to be sealed sealed away in christ to where he can't get a hold of us israel wasn't that way how many knows god tried his best to get israel to die to themselves and rest in him and trust in him but they never would do it oh my but never would and he swore or i says they'll never taste my rest they'll never know what it's like to be at peace in other words they'll never have rest how many knows that israel never did rest majority of them didn't joshua and caleb did it didn't matter what it was they arrested and trusted in god but the rest of them constantly were complaining and bickering and fussing and fighting let me let me finish this thought of hiding first colossians if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things on things above and not on things on earth for you are dead hallelujah think about it and your life is hid with christ in god that's where we get that head that hiding a hidden light the prophet of god preached just comes to mind let me read it now i find people so struggle they so struggle seems like i meet people that they say oh it's just such a struggle have you seen people that way and probably people many people sitting here before me now just the ups and the downs and the ends and the house oh one day and you're up and the next time they are down one day they love the lord and tomorrow they're having a stretch of struggle holding on the devil is so tempting them to have such ups and downs you meet somebody else that's on the hilltop all the time brother there's nothing bothers them at all let that sink in what class are you in what class are you in if you thought really hard you'd probably say boy i'll tell you what i'll tell you what that got me yesterday i i lost i you know i wasn't in all the time that really bothered me that really got to me this really got to me you ain't got to raise your hand but just your heart see that's me i'm i'm sorry lord shouldn't let get did get to me like that huh when i thought about this having rest for my enemies i thought about the chastisement of the lord how many know she chastised how he corrects you he beats you he will discipline you but i'm here to tell you as an experienced believer that once you learn your lesson there's no need for you to take that lesson over again god can do what he wants but you can have rest from that just as sure as i hope your mom and daddy aren't still spanking you you grow up you become a man you adjust you get past those little things huh then there's a time of rest because you've learned your lesson you don't have to go back to eighth grade you done did that be many years ago amen there's nothing bothers them at all but i'm saying there's bound to be something lacking somewhere god's not a respected person if he gives that to one person he wants all of his children to be that way this is where he comes in billy paul brother billy paul brother bantam's son seeing all the miracles seeing all the signs seeing all the wonders every great thing that god did through him what was the greatest thing about your daddy what would he say the way that you handle he handled every circumstance amen don't you want to be that way because that's the same way it was with jesus brother brandon followed jesus in that right that's who we're following jesus he handled every circumstance he was hid away in christ and if you're hid away in christ you don't have to fight those battles that you want fought you don't have to be in a constant struggle you don't have to be in a constant battle amen i believe it is at one place he says abraham once he once the battle was over of the kings and so forth he came back and relaxed and had communion and fellowship with with uh what was his name he had fellowship and communion with god but what was his name thank you i'm thinking of that no today preacher might need to remember that he had fellowship with melchizedek is that right and that's the way it is with the believer after you get yourself he said whipped out and you have fellowship oh my let me tell you something this is where paul won it uh was it the hebrews that's where paul was telling from the hebrews that they should be beware be careful make sure that you haven't not claimed the promise and for somehow or other you're not in that rest be careful make sure that you're in that place i mean i'll get the place of safety it's a place of refuge anywhere out there it's open season for the devil on you think about some of the young folks folks and i don't want to get dirty here but some of the young people that i have been associated with that even come to this church that i thought were halfway decent christians a little bit later found out they were lesbians hello turned out to be lesbians somehow they didn't get sealed god help me you better get sealed in you better have an experienced young person you want to have a tattoo and a nose ring you want to be like some of them people out there huh you better get the holy ghost you better oh my get so full of the holy ghost get a real good taste of almighty god and know that he is so good and once you get a real good taste and it changes your soul cause it has to be more than just a face huh once that soul changes it's changed forever nothing else will ever satisfy i'm a witness folks nothing else will ever satisfied [Music] hmm he is our satisfaction he on me knows the holy spirit is your comfort i gotta have a nose ringing tattoo i don't have to do this out of the other have me a mohawk or blue air to get a little satisfaction no you have comfort already you're at peace amen all right my peace that's why they sang that song peace peace wonderful peace coming down from the father above if there's a battle in your life well guess what he fights all your battles for you when you're in that place say here lord you see this fight you see this that's your lord take care of it amen joy unspeakable full of glory and a man that never knows what it is like to live a victorious life until he's completely overcome who himself the biggest enemy you got is yourself how do you believe that the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life if you ever conquer the lust of this flesh huh lust of the eye pride of life all the things that comes with this flesh the desires that this flesh has now remember one place baptized it says when you get born again you're going to die to yourself and he said not just die but you've got to rot it's got to be dead i mean he knows if there's just a little bit of uh uh something in you just a little bit a little bit alive it'll start sprouting it'll just keep going alive and i think our biggest battle even as a christian is like paul said to every day make sure you stay dead that's why you die daily every day you got to die to yourself keep it dead because if not it ain't long and you're way out there that's why he said you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god amen all right i like it but event 65 64. remember he said you know to the church it's darkness it's gross startness to them no peace to them no comfort to them oh my if the world hears this there's no comfort to the people out there in the world there's no comfort to anybody that follows any religion outside of jesus christ he didn't say come to me and buddha muhammad he said come to me and i will give you rest he's the only rest there is this darkness grows darkness upon the people upon the earth but he had a message but abandoned had a message to the church he called it to the bride and he said i say to the church god's peace peace amen in other words good morning god be with you god's peace go with you hey [Laughter] amen he didn't realize that uh you know 64 here we are almost in 24 22 i guess it is this many years people would know what he was talking about that they would receive and have that peace and rejoice in that peace amen follow peace with all men the bible says another scripture says be at peace amongst yourselves be at peace amongst yourselves because the devil doesn't like peace he likes war remember brother branham preaching on kind of get off of this mountain and head on towards the promised land let esau and all he said to all those old fighters always bickering and some people just ain't never happy unless you're in a fight unless they're causing stress and strife that's the very laughing and it's the very acid of the spit that comes out of the devil is stress and strife just be at peace with yourselves and amongst yourselves have the same mind amen let me see if i can find one here's one finally brethren farewell paul says be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you amen paul said how many knows at the corinthians church they were always bickering about who was the greatest huh whoever spoke in tongues and interpreted well they're the most spiritual in the church they ought to be looked up to got to have a little bit of a brownie badge huh paul says i brethren could not speak to you unto you as spiritual as carnal even as unto babes in christ i fed you with milk not with me for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able to bear it amen oh my he says for ye are yet carnal whereas there is among you envying strife divisions amen you get a church that's of god you get a people that's of god and you get a division in that church let me tell you something there is a devil at work it ain't god at work there's a devil at work you get a husband and a wife fuss in a fight and remember that's not uh that's the devil at work trying to tear you apart trying to get you to split up oh my i don't know why all this is but is that all right i believe we need it you got a good group of people as brother david says there's nobody to preach and smart in me and i'm sure that you appreciate having a group of people like this huh but the devil don't like that no he don't like unity he don't like it a church that's on fire where god's moving he don't like it and that's the pastor i can tell you exactly where the devil will hit somebody that's weak and backslid that's a real hit you know what he'll hit with murmuring and complaining [Music] that's how the devil sounds well now this shouldn't be this way and that shouldn't be that way and this and the other well i praise be to god all i can say to the person that's right probably shouldn't be but how about getting on your prayer bones and getting god to change it instead of trying to change it with your mouth and your bad attitude it'll only make it worse isn't it funny how somebody won't come from confront something and go to that person no they tell everybody about that person they got the manhood to go to the person it works like that on me it works like that on you you'd rather tell somebody else folks as a pastor you say brother bob are you preaching on this is this what we need no we don't need this but we might in the future and one thing's for sure as a pastor i'm going to guard against it with all i got i want to make sure that we keep that devil all the way down under our feet and that he don't have no way to rise up i won't have to confront him you're going to confront somebody if they start something like that because strife and stress that's not peace and rest that's the opposite of it that's exactly what the devil wants is this all right i hope this makes us stronger in the lord all right there's one more scripture if i can find it sometimes i write these things on the back of here but anyway you love the lord james there it is all the way at the bottom of page back to james again james three now if you'll notice there paul said you know if you still have strife and envy and divisions you're still carnal some people get really smart and wise right over in james 3 and verse 13 it says who is a wise man and dude with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness and wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts hello glory not and lie don't lie to yourself against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above so where does it come from hell if it causes strife and content remember it's of the devil and before we get done with our conversation i want to tell you what the holy spirit what the right wisdom and the way that it conducts itself and how it does it doesn't cause strife and contention but is earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion in every evil work how many believe paul believed in peace he believed in rest he believed in the church being of the same mind of the same thought and i believe that i believe the church church ought to think the same speak the same oh my and i'm glad that it isn't what i say or what somebody else says but what we think is this here it's the word of god but the wisdom that is from above listen if you really have wisdom that's from above first it's pure and then appeasable i'll tell you what when you go to correct me somebody brother bram says you know go do it real genuine love amen boy and i'm here to tell you one thing right now this applies for me more than it does you because correction comes from where up here it's got to be done in peace and in love amen the wisdom then peaceable it's gentle it's easily to deal with it's easy to deal with and treat it full of mercy in other words now you're just going to go to hell because you do that way huh no but it's full of mercy but god will forgive you you know god is gracious very merciful we all need grace huh and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy praise be to god talk just a little more we got 20 after can i go one more scripture and talk about one more aspect of this it's in isaiah 14 isaiah 14. remember brother branham he wouldn't even debate he says don't fuss i'm not going to fuss you don't stand the fuss at somebody about the word of god do you no you don't even aren't even supposed to cry because that's not the holy ghost the holy ghost don't fuss he says well your family fusses don't fuss back just love them hatred reach hatred love reach love for the lord we'll have mercy on jacob and will choose israel and yet choose israel and set him in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captive whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors that's a good way to have peace is to rule over the thing that ruled over you how many believes that when you are totally at peace with god and at rest amen you have the devil under your feet you are ruling over the thing that has ruled over you oh my and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from by fear and from the heart bondage wherein thou was made to serve i wrote down here you know it's now we are now telling what once told us what to do what once drove us to do what's wrong now it's our servant it's under our feet we tell it what to do every time a thought comes to your mind it doesn't be there you say shut up and get out of here huh every every fear that comes your way you don't have to be afraid you don't have to be scared huh praise be to god i believe that there is a rest for the people of god don't you that no matter what comes in the witness age that we're living right now folks where we're at we need peace more than we ever needed peace we need rest in people that we have ever had rest i want every one of us completely sealed in are you with me how many wants to be completely hidden in christ let me tell you something that doesn't matter like brother man he would have a cross on his car and then when temptation goes away it has absolutely no effect on you if you turn your head amen you it serves you doesn't affect you at all no matter what it is greed lust for money huh one thing that kind of come to me and i trust is the holy spirit and that was a warning i felt to say in the name of the lord and that is a lot of times we don't have the rest that we have we don't have the peace that we have we don't we succumb to temptation simply because the cares of this world are more important to us than god and his rest huh we're too busy in the morning to pray and keep our prayer life up like paul said die daily amen and sometimes see things creep in and then we wonder why we're cold on god wonder why we're lukewarm why we ain't got no shot why we ain't got no amen but we don't see the lord in our life and this is my heart is our desire this morning and that is that you will see my heart's desire for each and every one of us that every day that you will see christ working in your life because after all how many knows he is your shepherd he watches you every day he is with you wherever you go whatever you do and i love to see him in my life changing things doing things telling me things amen oh my and when that thought came to me i said lord you know sometimes like madam says sometimes for a family or an individual when it rains it pours and then they'll go through a life of kind of peace and you know everything will run smooth for a while i mean it's with me that's the way this world was that's the way god geared it for you to have a time of rest and i don't know that don't bother me when he's in here this morning they can say i'm glad that that don't bother me anymore i'm glad i don't have a struggle with that anymore i sure but got both hands up in my foot i am glad that i don't have a struggle with that anymore and then i'm glad i don't have a struggle with that i don't have the battle anymore god gave me rest from it now it's time to celebrate it's time to have a festival and gladness and a good day i believe it's a good day for for the people of god it's shalom it's peace it's not all you better worry it's not judgment it's not
