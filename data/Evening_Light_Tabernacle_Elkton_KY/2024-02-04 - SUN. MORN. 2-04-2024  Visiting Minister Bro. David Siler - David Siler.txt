you bless us and touch Our Lives we want to praise you today and give you honor in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody said amen God bless you today while you're standing with us if you'd be so kind to turn to the book of St John chapter 11 John chapter 11 want to say what an honor and a privilege it is to be with you today in the house of the Lord trust that the Lord will say something to you many years ago I was in India I was looking out the window getting ready for service service was about to start and I was getting ready to to go and to speak and I watched as a man pulled up in his car in a little place across from where I was staying at and he pulled up in his car and he opened up his trunk and out of the back of his trunk he picked up this statue it wasn't real big but it was a it was statue that he picked up and he took the statue over underneath the little canopy and I watched him as he set that statue down and he began to worship it he got down on his hands and his knees and he was worshiping that statue and I thought Lord I'm so glad I don't worship a God that's been fashioned by the hand of a man and I'm glad it ain't of God that I can pick up but I found out my God has to pick me up and I worship a god it's not been made by man's hands our God is real today I trust you brought him with you amen St John 11:1 17 then when Jesus came he found that he had l in the grave four days already bethan he was nine to Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and to Mary to comfort them concerning their Brethren listen listen to that again many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard and how many knows how Faith Comes Faith cometh by hearing and Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so she's looking to the future of things that are to be and Jesus said unto her watch him bring this Revelation among them and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and then he asks this question believest thou this she saith unto him Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world and when she had said so she went away and called Mary her sister secretly she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee I'd like to speak to you on that today the master is come and call us for thee may the Lord add His blessings to the word today you can be seated certainly appreciate each one of you coming to the house of God today see those from our assembly appreciate them coming i' like to speak on this story but the direction that I would like to speak on it from I know that it's preached been preached onto million times but a million and one won't hurt us but we know that the Book of John is actually a special book in the Bible out of the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John that John is a special book and each one of the writers that would take and pin that part of the Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John they could only pin the word by the anointing that was upon them and we know that whenever you look at the anointing that would fall in the New Testament that the prophet tells us that it was going to come by those same anointings that was around Israel in the wilderness they would be the anointing of a lion Ox a man and an eagle and we know that the anointing that would come would fall upon each one of these writers Matthew Mark Luke and John and each one would write under a different anointing whenever you read the gospels it'll help you if you understand like the Book of Matthew whenever Matthew writes that Matthew was under that lying anointing and ly represents King so whenever Matthew begin to write he goes back into the genealogy just like you would with any King to prove his pedigree Matthew goes back into the genealogy of Jesus and he writes the genealogy showing how that the seed line of David had come all the way up and he wrote it that way then he actually spoke concerning the kingdom of God that is to come because he's under that lying anointing but whenever mark would write it Mark would not begin the same place that Matthew would write it but whenever Mark be to write the word Mark was under that Ox anointing and because he was under a servitude anointing he would actually write it from a servant's mentality so he would talk about Jesus being a servant and Jesus coming to served the people and Jesus coming to help the people but whenever it comes to Luke Luke writes it different than the way Matthew under the lion mark under the ox but Luke actually come under the man's anointing so when you read the scripture and you look at the way that Luke writes it Luke talks about the humanity of Jesus and he talks about how that the man was troubled and the man was outside the city of Jerusalem and he suffered with a headache and he looks at the humanity part of our Lord and that's what he focuses on because that's the anointing that Luke is writing under but when you come to the Book of John that John is different than the rest of them because remember that John was a prophet and a prophet represents a sear or a prophet represents an eagle and an eagle has the ability to be able to climb higher than what the ox can what the man can but the lon can it climbs higher than all the rest of them so whenever John begins right he doesn't go back to the Old Testament pick up the lineage of David pick up Tamar pick up Ruth that the way that John writes it but John being an eagle is actually elevated into the sphere that whenever John begin to write John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and because John being a prophet amen a prophet can see all the way back into the past he looks all the way into the future and he can at present tense in the word that's the anointing that John was under so when it comes to this story in the book of of John that actually you realize the only writer that there is in the four gospels that's going to actually pin the story of the resurrection of Lazarus Matthew never wrote about it John never wrote about it Luke never wrote about it but only the prophetic Eagle type is the one that wrote about the resurrection of Lazarus now we know that this story has been laying here in the scripture for quite some time but you and I coming to the revelation of this day God sending us an eagle to be able to take the word which we have now and that word becoming alive to us we don't read the Bible the same way everybody else reads the Bible we don't look at Stories the same way everybody else looks at stories but now there's come a supernatural Enlightenment From Another Dimension that has actually took and discern the very back parts of God's mind and he's taken that story of history and he's brought that story present in the day that we're living in now so the book of Lazarus or the Book of John and The Story of Lazarus it's more than just another story in your Bible but it is a type of a people who is living today amen now we're taught according to the prophet's message that whenever it comes to the New Testament that God's going to reveal himself in Three Sons Nam Son of God Son of Man son of David and we know that there was going to be Junctions down through through history that God was going to make himself known in those offices and we know that the office that God wants to use when it comes to the prophetic office we know that God uses the office of the son of man you read that in the Book of Ezekiel when he says say unto me Ezekiel do you see these bones is laying here and he ask son a man can these bones live and then Ezekiel said but Lord you know it's because God was revealing himself through a prophetic office and they called it son of man so whenever it comes to the three sons Nam Son of God son of man son of David we know that God would reveal himself in that time now as he reveals himself in the days that is to coming we believe in a thousand- year Millennium Reign that is to to come he will reveal himself under the name of son of David and we know that through the church ages once the Holy Spirit Come Back upon the church he was going to reveal himself as Son of God down Through the Ages but then the scripture promises according to Luke 17:30 that between the coming of the Millennium and after the Son of God Church ages that in the end time the light is going to come amongst the Gentiles and he's going to reveal himself under the office of the son of man for as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man so we know that there's three Junctions down through history where God revealed himself as the son of man he revealed himself in that office when he come to Abraham just before the destruction of Sodom he come to Abraham in the form of MDC and he revealed himself as Abra as Elohim and we know that God has done that same thing God comes down God picks up a dust body he creates a body steps into it and through that body God discerned the very secrets that was in Sarah's heart in that body he told them what was fixing to take place he for warn them of Destruction was going to come and when that Ministry come it also give Abraham and Sarah a body changing message that was going to turn him back young again now once Jesus ask once to hear is Christ the son of man the almighty God comes down bails himself in that body the moment that God gets into that body that body can get hungry like a man it can get thirsty like a man that body can get tired like a man but yet the body was not God but God was veiling himself in that body it was Jehovah veiled in a human body that we call mezc and but comes and he actually identifies that Ministry and he tells us according to the message of who is this mkdc he tells us actually the opening of the seals he shows us by three different manifestations of the coming of the son of man under a mezic Ministry and he goes back he picks it up in the days of Abraham and then he tells us that MDC became Jesus Christ so it is the son of man in the days of Jesus Christ doing the same signs and same Wonders that was done to Abraham and Sarah was done right there remember whatever he called Philip and he said when did you know me he said before he called you underneath the tree I saw you what was it the same sign that came to Abraham and Sarah had come there and let me just say this you and I are living in the day of another revealing of the mezic ministry in which God has come down and he's unveiling himself in humanity and you remember what mzc is mzc is the power of an endless life so when he come to Abra and Sarah they received the power when it come in the middle of the book they received the power and when it come here at the end of the book we're receiving a power as well now we know that mzda had come to give them that body changing Ministry and it showed up the second time now think about it produced a a Rapture It produced a body change at the first of the book It produced The Rapture the Resurrection the days of Jesus underneath that Ministry and if it produced a resurrection and It produced a body change the first time it produced it the second time what about the day that we're living in will it not produce the exact same thing right here in the end time it must produce a resurrection and it must produce a body change so you realize we are looking at that same Ministry now milic to many the scholars you read about it they don't understand nothing about it but you and I we've heard about this we've seen it for years and years and years and we know that that mesic Ministry has come right back in the end time again think about it what did MDC do with Abraham just before he leaves notice the last thing that mzc did with Abraham was he took communion is that right what was the last thing that Jesus done with his disciples he took communion what's the last sermon William Bram preached we're right back into that same ministry again now in Revelation the the Bible tells us by Revelation that there's something laying here then that's going to be a parallel of the first the coming and the third and we know that the Bible tells us whenever it comes to the Book of John that Jesus loved Lazarus and he loved Martha and Mary as well he loved Lazarus he loved Mary he loved Martha for the Bible says in St John 11:5 that Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus so these people are not strangers to him but notice he loves them he cares about them and Lazarus gets sick and Mary and Marth are concerned about Lazarus being sick and so now what they're going to do is is what the prophet says what every believer's going to do whenever they have a need they're going to call Jesus on the scene so notice what they're doing they're doing the right thing because they are believers Martha's a Believer Mary's a Believer are you hearing that they are believers in the ministry of Christ they are believers in the Ministry of the son of man and the first thing they're going to do is they're going to call Jesus on the scene which proed they are genuine Believers and brother tells us that Jesus is not only coming on the scene when you call him but he's longing to come on the scene for you so here is Martha and Mary Lazarus is sick and they know that he's dying and so whenever he's dying the Bible says in verse six when he had heard therefore he was sick he Abode two days in the same place where he was so Jesus doesn't just jump up and run down there and get all all upset and all worried and everything going on notice he doesn't just jump up and around down there he waits two more days but the problem is after two days Lazarus is dead I'll tell you had that been your pastor you would have fired oh my you took your name off the church book you pulled your bench up you'd head it right out the back door you know why it does prove sometimes we don't understand the way that God does things amen but notice Jesus Waits two more days but now Lazarus is dead he's gone he's completely he's completely to the place to where they've taken him down and now when Jesus doesn't come immediately remember here is the Jews that are around Martha and Mary now they're familiar with Martha and Mary they're familiar with Lazarus being raised in that part of the country so they're familiar with them and the moment that Jesus Jesus doesn't show up when everybody else thinks he should the Bible says and many of the Jews came to Martha and to Mary to comfort them concerning their Brethren isn't that convenient that whenever Jesus do come here comes the Jews now let me let me give this to you the way that I see this today remember Martha and Mary is following the son of man Ministry they're following the ministry of Christ which means they've come out their synagogues they come out of Jewish tradition anybody hear me I'm talking about Believers they've come out of her my people they've left the teaching theyve left the Traditions they've left the Pharisees they left the Sadducees they they've come out of all that but notice after they come out of their temples and they've left their churches whenever Jesus doesn't show up here com some Jews to comfort them can you imagine the reproach can you imagine the reproach of here is these Jews now they've left their Temple they left their Church no doubt some of the people upset you leave our church bless God you're going to split hell wide open but notice here they come and notice what they're doing we know Jesus ain't here but we're here to help you we are here we still love you we still care about you Martha we know what you called our our congregation you know you called us off scar you called us Tommy Rod you called us Children of the but we we we forgive you for that and we know that we don't agree on everything but want to tell you we are here for you now Jesus ain't here but we are here where is Jesus when you need him to most at he ain't nowhere to be found but I want you to know we're here to help you and we got all kinds of we got all kinds of programs and small groups and all types of things to help you we got an old kind priest down here you can confess to him anytime you want to and it's so mother Church opens up her arms to welcome you back and no doubt these Jews are seeing that Jesus ain't here and they're Whispering among themselves I knew he was false I knew there was something wrong about him I going to tell you I knew there was something about that Jesus where's he at when these people's got a real need at where's he been found that they called and he wouldn't even come I hear he went another Direction I hear he went down to another house you know why this Situation's too great for him he can't fake this this time Lazarus is not sick he's dead so in their Darkest Hour where is Jesus at but little oh watch the top now little did they now know that while they were doubting Jesus Jesus was on the way when oh Hallelujah whenever they was doubting the word and they're doubting God coming in the middle of that don't you free see friends that knowing this first that scoffer shall come walking after their own lust saying where is the promise of his coming and the whole time our D get coming he's coming right among them they may not know it they may not see it but he's right among them Hallelujah here's their answer the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness so they're doubting Jesus anybody catching the picture yet so here is believers they are being made fun of they're being ridiculed for the message that they're believing here they're being talked about because of the message they're believing here they are being laughed at because of the message they're believing and they said they're following a man somewhere or they're offing some cult somewhere and the whole time oh let me and the whole time God was right there among them he was on his way because God is Not slack concerning his word and the whole world is doubting Jesus and the whole world is doubting his coming but let me tell you he's coming he's coming you may not know it you may not see it but he's coming he's coming for you and it's coming for me that's what the word says amen verse 17 then when Jesus come look at the way he finds the church I mean the people when he comes he found that he had lay in the grave four days already Jesus ain't on my time he ain't on your time he comes at the right time at the right day in the right hour and I heard the prophet say just the other day he said there ain't nothing out of cater it's just us that thinks it [Applause] is verse 20 then Martha said listen to this Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming she went out and met him but Mary sat still in the house now watch the way this comes together so Martha hears that Jesus is coming and her faith is elevated to the place where she wants to meet Jesus but not Mary Mary sits still in the house showing that God's got a season and time for every person to receive their own Revelation notice the way he says as that have not I sent 1962 you talking about a powerful statement he said to Martha they've been saying that she was dilator and things about keeping her house clean but when The Showdown come she showed her color Hallelujah that's right when The Showdown come she showed her color so she may have just look like a housewife and she may have just look like she was dealor about making sure the beds was made and the house was clean and the food was ready and the kids got everything they needed but when The Showdown come that Revelation it went beyond her Duty as a housewife it went beyond her duty of the clothes and her duty of the bed and everything don't you see when the real Revelation strikes us I don't care if you're a woman in the house or a man in the factory when The Showdown comes that's when it's going to prove what you got Hallelujah when the show down come she showed her color yes sir Mary Mary the one that was always found by Jesus the one that was always down watching him speak hearing he said the one you would have thought that would have ran out to meet him is sitting in the house and Mary was sitting weeping because of her brother being dead but Martha went out and met the living words I want to say that real slow she went out and and met the Living Word the one that's concerned about the house being just right and the dishes being put away Mary the one that like to sit and hear Jesus preach but when Martha heard that he's coming she left the dishes anybody hearing me she left everything else anything else that was in paror and become secondary whenever she heard Jesus was coming so notice when she years that he's coming it actually puts Martha into action there's a reaction from the action and when she heard and Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word don't you see that predestinated seed laying inside of Martha whenever she hit it oh my you would have thought she cared nothing about the preaching nothing about the word she's just another church CER but when The Showdown come here come that predestinated seed raising up outside of mar don't you see friends it didn't matter how dark the situation was it didn't look how bad it was when she heard that Jesus was coming the Bible said she ran out to meet him she went to meet the Living Word now watch her mindset verse 21 then Martha said unto him Lord had you been here that is a powerful Revelation our brother wouldn't have died proving proving that life and death can't exist in the same place at the same time had you been here Martha says that our would even to die look at her faith in the word if you been here death would have been an unwelcome visitor there would have been no way that Lazarus would have died had you been here you would have casted that from him verse 22 but I know I'm not guessing I'm not wondering I'm not just asking I know I know I know that even now whatever th ask of God he will give it to thee yes it's a hard time yes it's a dark time yep there's trouble everywhere yep it's been four days and Lazarus has already rotten in the grave but I believe that even now that's where our faith has got to be at today even like that no matter how bad it looks no matter what the doctor scan says the MRI the X-ray no matter how bad that it looks whatever the word says He says even now Lord whatever you ask God let me say that same thing for you even now whatever you ask God the doctor May give up on you he may tell you there ain't no way you're going to make it but I want to let you know even now Lord even now whatever you ask God even now listen not maybe not sometime even now Hallelujah doubt Wants To Rule The Mind had you been here four days ago oh my know what people say oh if Jesus was just here oh if brother Bon was still here I want to tell there's a greater than Solomon that is Among Us Willam BR may not be here Paul may not be here but almighty God is still here when you face sickness that must be your confession even now no matter how bad it looks well I got all kinds of finan even now Lord on notice he says in perseverant even now whatever you ask God listen to this boy that got the cogs moving they begin to come together listen to this Faith begin to meet with God so what she heard produced the person Christ you seeing it what she heard produced a real Jesus and her faith begin to meet with god listen to this top it's just like putting the negative and positive together you're going to get light pretty soon you ever had your car batter go dead and that car battery can be dead about 4 days but if you take another vehicle and you hook up some Faith cables I mean some jumper cables and you hook that up oh let me tell inside of that dead battery is some C sales in there Hallelujah inside them CES has the memory and the ability to be able to retain power but you got to have a real Jesus and a real faith and the real word and you hook that up to a dead battery and you allow that power to go inside of it and it goes from a dead battery to a live battery it goes from a dead Church to a Living Church [Applause] Hallelujah that's the way Faith Works you got to let your faith connect with the word of God in order to restore power to the believer Sometimes some of us when we was young we'd hook them up backwards let me tell you what you get you may get a bad radiator but let me know what happens you hooking up backwards you're going to get a lot of spark you're going to get a lot of movement you're going to get a lot of action but you ain't going to get no power are you hearing me that's what Pentecost had they had a lot of spark they had a lot of excitement but let me tell you the vehicle ain't going nowhere but this message come to tell us how to hook our faith up into the word of God we don't have listen we don't want just spark we don't want just that we want a power that's going to take us from one dimension to another we don't want just can we talk about or Fellowship around we want something that's going to get us out of here and change our bodies in a moment of twinkling and eye even now whatever you ask God and Jesus said unto her he gives their the entire Revelation and he says my brother shall rise again and then Martha goes to thinking she goes through the understanding in her mind he Lord I know one day there's going to be a pie in the sky and the B pie Lazarus is going to come forth as the rest of the Dead Martha's talking about a resurrection that is to come yeah she was talking about a future event right but Jesus he ain't talking about an event come on yeah he's the purse of the Resurrection so when you got the resurrection near you're not waiting for something to happen you got the person of the Resurrection The Resurrection is more than just an event we believe in the resurrection we believe that it's coming but I want to tell you'll never be a part of that Resurrection if you ain't met the person of the Resurrection too many people are looking for event and they fail to recognize the message that God has sent Among Us the reality of the word that's right notice verse 25 and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this so watch she's asking the question he's asking a question he says I'm going to tell you what you're looking for I am yeah think you're looking for in the future I'm the one you're looking for look he's unfolding the very mystery of his coming he's this is the son of man he's unfolding the mystery of his coming he's revealing the secret of how he's going to come in the last days I didn't just come to comfort Martha I didn't just come here to mourn with you I'm not just come here to cry I've come here for a resurrection he come to restore listen to me listen to what I'm telling you he come to restore her faith back to a living Lazarus do you see that notice the ministry of the son of man he's coming to turn her heart back to the faith of a living walking talking Lazarus are you seeing it he come to take her back to the Living Word to bring her faith to a higher where she's not just looking to the future but she believes that that same God is alive right now can do whatever you ask you he come to take her faith back to the original word and notice her response yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ you told matter of Revelations you're the Son of God which come into the world in other words he says that she says amen yeah amen listen the believer punctuated The Words of Christ with an amen so you got the coming of the son of man you've got listen you got Martha who has met The Living Word you got Lazarus which is dead but something's got to happen before the Resurrection comes all the bride has got to get together so Mary is sitting in the house so in order for Mary she has got to come to this same Revelation and her and Mary listen they're alive upon the Earth and they're remaining at this time here's the words you got Lazarus which is the sleeping dead so we got those which are alive and remain we got that which is in the grave and we got the Living Word that's calling for the bride you see it so Jesus tells her what to do verse 28 and when she had so said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly isn't that incredible that during the hour of her faith being restored back she's not calling her as a public show but she calls her secretly and she tells her the master has come so notice it's not a public show first pull is a public show second pull is a public show but the third poll is going to be a secret now Martha had caught the Revelation that Jesus was calling for and now that she's caught that Revelation from Jesus himself look what Martha's doing she she's running with the message she's got the Revelation now listen don't you see the bride top once the Revelation comes now here is Martha she's coming to get married and she's got this mystery she's got this secret she knows his message he's coming he's coming he's coming there's coming a resurrection she had the message that he ain't just come but he's here right now he is here and he's here to call you secretly not that just one day he's here so Martha repres represents the bride and God's using the voice of the Bride to call the rest of the Bride she's running with the message of the resurrection and that message is Christ is here don't you see my Ministry isn't just to tell you he's coming come on I'm here to declare he's here so it is the top then that the Rapture and the resurrection notice theam tells us in the Rapture message 1965 the first thing that comes forth is his message calling the bride together it's his message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught up together the trumpet the feast in the heavens and the sky now the first thing is the sounding the first thing is a shout then a voice and then a trumpet so a shout is a messenger getting the people ready I'm telling you Martha's met him and she's got the re reation and now this Revelation is inside of her heart and she's running into the house to get married because she is a possessor of the word he said the shout is a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice the loud voice and St John 11 they call Lazarus from the grave he's getting the bride together then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch three things take place what is it I shout a voice and a trump so the same voice that called Martha and called Mary is the same voice that's going to call Lazarus what's the secret it's the voice of God and every bit of it don't you see that's what this message is that we've received in this hour it is the bridegroom's voice calling to the bride to get her oh don't you see that's what God has done in this day he has sent his own voice hallelujah it's more than just the Kentucky it's the voice of God using our body not MDC to reveal what Christ is doing [Applause] now so you got the dead in the graves you got the living bride which is already alive and here's the ministry of the son of man you got Martha and you got Mary that has already come out of the denominations but after they come out they've got to have the real original Faith to be able to be a part of the Resurrection amen amen here come the word of God in the darkest hour and the prophet says that this last age is the darkest out of all the ages and when Martha hears that Jesus is coming listen to this Jesus interrupts mourning he interrupts Sadness the Living Word interrupted her mourning of the Dead it looks like there's no hope it looks like there's no way it looks like Le osia is going to Snuff everybody out and there ain't nobody going to be ready it may seem that way and it may look that way but it ain't going to be that way because God's already promised in his word he's going to have a bride and he's going to have a people and I'm going to tell there's people in this building that's going to be a part of it Hallelujah listen friends we cannot shove this off for somebody else you must believe that you are the body of Martha and Mary thank you Lord Martha cannot sit still any longer when she hear Jesus says this watch Faith put her in action to go meet the word and now the word is putting her in action to get in as many as she can before the resurrection takes place I got to get in everybody that I can don't you tell me this friend listen to me we don't want just our four no more we don't want just these people that's in this we want to reach out cast the night net to everybody that we can we got the Peril of great price I don't want to see nobody miss it I don't care what denomination they here we don't want nobody to miss it [Applause] it so the word causes Martha to raise to her feet not just sit and twit her thumbs a resurrection's coming it's in it but the resurrection will not take place until all the bride Unite with the word you see it don't you see how connected you are in to this Revelation don't you see how the Readiness of the Bride is connected with the Rapture don't you see he is not going to lose a one it is completely totally impossible listen you may have children that's out here in the world doing what they want to do but I want to tell it's impossible for God to lose one of them it is totally completely impossible how can God lose one of them your name is inscribed on the bottom of his hands it is totally impossible I don't know what God's going to have to do what they're going to have to go through but God's going to make sure that Martha and Mary is ready here is Mary sitting in the house she's got the Jews all around her they're Pat her on the back it's okay Mary it's okay we know we know how sad it is it's okay patner on the back it's okay we know you left our church Mary we know but we'll accept you we are open arms Fellowship we accept everybody we don't care who you are men women lesbians homos whatever we want everybody are we believe some of that same thing come right on in as you are just don't leave as you was amen we hate the sin but we love the sinner God hates the sin but he loves The Sinner come in anywh you are but when the word gets a hold of you make sure you leave here change make sure you leave here different than and watch you [Applause] come Jesus has got power of transformation we forgive you Mary oh we remember how the God was with Moses years ago we remember how great that God used to move and how wonderful the Revival used to be oh my look back at how God opened Red Seas and he ring money out of Heaven oh wasn't that great how God used to move but we don't know we don't do that no more the days of Miracles has passed and we love you and we care about you and we're going to give you a good history lesson and we're going to pump you full of all kinds of vitamins mhm about that time Here Comes Mary into Martha into the house Mary might have been lagging behind but Jesus hasn't forgot about her glory to God she may not have been on the same queue as Martha was and everybody may not come at the same time the same way or the same how but I want to tell God has not forgotten about his spirit and God won't forget about you he won't forget about me he won't forget about us he cannot yeah that's right you may think you're lagging behind but Jesus didn't forget about you Mary the resurrection cannot take place until Mary gets the resurrection Revelation amen are you hearing me and every member of the body gets the resurrection Revelation the Rapture cannot come let me tell you God's going to make sure you get Resurrection [Applause] Revelation I can see the Jews I could see them all the way around Mary and they're huddling around her oh Mary we're so sorry Mary we're so sorry all us tell you about a God that was and a God that used to has been about that time Here Comes Martha she goes over by the dishes maybe she's washing on a dish a little bit and she's trying to catch Mary's eye trying to look at her about that time Mary looks up Martha hear me he come here right come over here let me show you something come on over here but I got all these people around me don't worry about all them come on so she nods her head you know how some people they can't take a [Music] hint what do you need to tell me mar comes out going about to rub a ho what's wrong with you I gotta tell you something tell me what is it you're not going to believe this you are not going to believe this tell me what is it you ready there's a man that's present that can turn on the light amen Mary are greater than Solomon here you better recognize your day and its message Mary let me tell you the seed is on air with the Shar you're inall Mary do you hear what I'm telling you you're not like everybody else and the Bible tells us in verse 29 as soon as she heard she arose quickly and came do you see election in that do you see predestination in that the message listen the message had called her by name Jesus said go tell Mary here is Mary being aren't you glad that you got ears to hear aren't you glad that you got ear ears to see eyes to see ears to hear and Fa to be able to believe it listen Jesus could not continue until the bride had come to the right Revelation and when Mary hears this she leaves the Weeping behind she leaves her ideas behind the Weeping Days Are Over the sad days is done because it is the rising of the son it's not good night to her it's not it's over to her it's not it's finished to her it's shalom man Shalom notice verse 30 Jesus listen to this listen to this typ Jesus was not yet coming to the town but was in the same place where Martha Med you know what that tells me every believer has got to meet Christ at the same place are you hearing me Mary has got to meet him at the same place that Martha did she had to come to that same Revelation she had to come to that same word she's got to come to that same understanding it wasn't good enough just to associate around it it wasn't good enough just to Fellowship around it you must Meet The Living Word as an individual for yourself in the same place every child of God has got to under that same Revelation the same [Applause] place what the misunderstanding and confusion let me close then the Jews which were with her in the house comforted her when they saw Mary that she arose up hastily and went out Oh Glory they follow her saying she's going to the Crave to weep M your Revelation wrong you have missed misunderstood why she rose up quickly you have misunderstood what caused her to be aroused you misunderstood what's anointing her and the faith that is moving in here listen their understanding is wrong she's not going to a funeral and we're not going to a funeral are you hearing me we're not going just to a graveyard we're going to the resurrection and then when Mary was come where Jesus was where was he same place Mar Martha made him everyone has to come to that one provided place of worship every believer must meet him on the same grounds there ain't no substitute burst well I rose up around the message there ain't no substitute for birth I don't care if you raised up under message pews chewing on message blue books I want to tell there ain't no substitute for a birth every one of us must come to that same place you've got to meet him as an individual everyone's required to be able to go in the rer you got to have one thing you got to have the token but it ain't Church associate ain't shaking a preacher's hand you got to have your own [Applause] Revelation when she come where Jesus was she fell down his feet and saying to him Lord if You' been here her brother not died wonder where she got that idea she recognized who she who he was and she knew that death couldn't touch Lazarus so she comes to that same place because she responded to The Master's Call she heard her name she got the Revelation and now she's got it you know what it's time for now Resurrection yes Martha's got it Mary's got it you got the Living Word Christ has come he's here the Revelation has come what's the last thing Resurrection because they got some blood they got some blood kin that's down there in that graveyard I said we got some blood kin that's laying down there in that tomb but after the bride is gathered together now it's the season of the resurrection and I want to tell we've got Brethren we've had people we've buried people in the last five years in our assembly it's unbelievable how many funerals that I have done but I want to tell we're coming to the last one we've got a lot of good brothers and sisters that has went by the way of the grave and let me tell you not just in this day all the way back into day they've went down to the Grave down the first the second the third the fourth the fifth but I want to tell you the Bible says the last shall be first and the first shall be last they went down 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven they're going to come back up 7 six 5 4 3 2 1 BL all resurrection and Rapture and here comes Jesus think about it the Bible says Jesus therefore saw her we weeping the Jews weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled Jesus groans but why why would Jesus groan and B said the reason something groans is because it's not in its rightful condition yeah so Jesus sees a Lazarus that's not in his right condition glory and now there's a groaning didn't Paul said there's going to be groanings everything is groaning Waiting For What manifestation of the sons of God Jesus groaned because Lazarus is not in his original state says everything's growing the only way you can grown and wait for it is because there's New Life coming here that speaks of a new world eternal life in you is calling for a body that cannot go by the way of the Grave which means we're calling for them you don't even know it today but your body when you get sick sick and it's groaning you're calling for a body they can't get sick they can't get down they can't get discouraged that can't get depressed yeah Jesus coming up to that grave he's wiping the tears from his eyes think about the humanity of Jesus he's wiping the tears back he's wiping the flood he love Lazarus and then he called Lazarus by name and I always loved it and I always will at the Prophet has always made this statement he said had Jesus not called Lazarus by his name yes everything in the grave everything let me tell you how much I believe that not only would everything every person that had died in that grave had Jesus just said come forth every deer every antalope every cow every bug every flea every even a little bit Little bitt M you know had Jesus said come forth everything that would have died had to give way to the master because that's how much resurrection power lays in his voice it would have all come forth and a man that had been dead four days do you understand it was against the law of the Jews to even be around a dead body after three days you wouldn't even allowed to be around it it's the law you cannot be around it because that's when corruption sets in and here this Lazarus corruption has set into his body the Prophet said his nose had fell in his eyeballs is already gone Glory but Jesus come after the law glory to God and he calls Lazarus by name and I want to tell you Jesus didn't have to fight with the bugs in his body all right worm spit his eyeball out give it back give me his eyeball right I said give me all he has to do is speak and when he speaks that creative word it reached out to whatever place that Lazarus was in at that time maybe Lazarus was over their fellowship with Abraham and Sarah maybe Ezekiel and about that time he hears his name Lazarus everybody around say did you hear that was that your belly I think I heard my name Lazarus come for and in a moment in a twinking and a twinkling of an eye Lazarus is back in his body that's how quick God can change you let's stand our feet today Jesus calls him by name and that higher law that went over the worms went over corruption it went over the body of Lazarus and when it moved over Lazarus the worms had to get back they didn't have no rights to the body you know why because the word the dominating word the supernatural power of the Resurrection was greater higher than corruption that's by our hearts but ter won't you come can you come play for me come play Oh friends we are living in the day that we've recognized by the coming of the son of man Ministry in this age we've recognized what he's done don't you see we've received that same Resurrection Revelation today Hallelujah that Revelation has fallen right here amongst the living bread there may be some Mars you ran just as soon as you heard some of us may have been like Mary maybe we sat still in the house a little bit it don't matter what time you come in it don't
