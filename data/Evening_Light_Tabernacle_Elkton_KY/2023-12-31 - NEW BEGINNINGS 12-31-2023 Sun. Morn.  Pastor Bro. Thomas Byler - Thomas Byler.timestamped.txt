[25:44] preaching the s service that's where we
[25:48] look and that tell us exactly where
[25:50] we're at and Lord if we're not where we
[25:53] need to be we need to make some changes

[26:00] more we realize this morning we need to
[26:02] see where we're going and that's what's
[26:05] going to tell the truth Lord this
[26:08] morning we come deep because Lord you
[26:10] know our heart you know our
[26:14] desires Lord you know what we have need
[26:17] of
[26:17] ourselves so Lord I pray that you be in
[26:20] every aspect of this service I didn't
[26:23] just come because it's another day we
[26:25] had to come I come because I had Aire
[26:28] in your house the place you give me to
[26:31] worship it's more important than
[26:33] business it do matter what we accomplish
[26:37] it's more important than our jobs it's
[26:39] more important than watching a
[26:41] basketball or football game this is the
[26:44] most important thing we'll do this
[26:46] morning that's to praise you and give
[26:48] you all the glory in Jesus name Lord we
[26:51] ask you help us this morning that you've
[26:54] been our pastor that he would preach for
[26:57] word for if it hurts it hurts the more

[27:04] ain't doing us no good this time this
[27:07] morning Lord I pray that you help us to
[27:09] this church just to quit playing around
[27:11] with the word just halfway sitting on
[27:14] the fence don't know which side to go
[27:16] and Lord we ask Lord Jesus we heard the
[27:19] prophet preaching this morning he said
[27:22] if it ain't a little noise in it that
[27:24] means it's probably dead Lord I asked

[27:29] and I give you all the honor glory
[27:31] Praise Your Precious name amen

[28:02] know been raised in the ghetto you know
[28:03] that don't know nothing but you know
[28:07] hearing testimonies the guys that give
[28:08] their heart to the Lord you know like we
[28:10] need a preachers down here because we
[28:12] know all the you know like this guy was
[28:13] from my line he said you know all the
[28:15] preachers down there they would sell
[28:16] drugs to you know I mean things like
[28:18] that that you know people people don't
[28:21] even have a taste of what real godliness
[28:24] is like you know to see a real living
[28:26] written epistle of all men of Jesus
[28:28] Christ in us you know it's just it's
[28:30] just so awesome to be called out and to
[28:32] be a to hear this message that hour like
[28:34] we was on the way here you know
[28:35] listening to a message too and listening
[28:38] how he's talking about you know brother
[28:39] Brandon's message being stored up stored
[28:42] up mana for us you know like you know
[28:46] the back in you know Joseph's time you
[28:49] had to go to over there to get the man
[28:51] you know blanking out there but but when
[28:54] you think about where we're called out
[28:56] to hear this and about to have the
[28:57] revelation of the hour to you know take
[28:59] us back you know I've just been thinking
[29:01] a lot here lately on God's love you know
[29:03] seeing his love for us from the
[29:05] foundation of the world to get us to
[29:06] where we're at today and to be in fine
[29:09] tune with us to be to be living and
[29:11] walking talking through us and to
[29:13] manifest his word in our life it's such
[29:15] a great blessing for Jesus Christ to
[29:17] call us out we have something so much to
[29:20] be grateful for so much they thinking
[29:22] for this new year you know I believe
[29:24] that we can go higher in Christ you know
[29:26] and allow him to have preeminence in our
[29:28] life and live through us that he can
[29:30] manifest his word and you know just like
[29:32] I seen the thing the other day going
[29:33] back to Eden think about the Dominion
[29:35] that was lost in the garden God's trying
[29:37] to restore it to his people his sons and
[29:39] daughters to create a bride of Christ
[29:41] and as he's manifesting his word in us
[29:43] that's him living through us being bone
[29:46] of his bone flesh his flesh it's just
[29:48] it's just we stand in awe of the Lord of
[29:51] what he can do and all that he can open
[29:53] our eyes to all that he can help us see
[29:55] more of him because he is his word it's
[29:58] just it's just so inspiring to me man
[30:00] that we just just got so much to just
[30:02] thank for it just makes me want to shout
[30:04] and scream you know but I was just
[30:06] thinking when he asked me this I had
[30:07] this I've been reading the scripture
[30:09] here
[30:09] lately first John
[30:16] 4 it's just a little bit lengthy chapter
[30:19] here but you know I think we got time
[30:21] you know this is uh oh sorry I didn't
[30:23] dismiss that I ain't very good at all
[30:25] this but you know I just thinking about
[30:27] the Lord and and how much I love him and
[30:29] how much he loves us and how how if you
[30:33] just think of him manifesting in our
[30:35] life man when we stop and just look at
[30:37] that you know I was thinking I was last
[30:40] night I was writing down some stuff and
[30:41] I was thinking about think about Adam
[30:43] and Eve in the garden they had no need
[30:46] to be no need of Deliverance no need of
[30:48] nothing they had God's fortified word
[30:51] and I was when I was thinking on this
[30:52] like think that they had limited
[30:54] knowledge they didn't know they was even
[30:57] they didn't they God supplied their food
[30:59] he supplied their water he supplied
[31:01] their AG of protection he was their
[31:03] everything you know when you think of
[31:05] that and that's where we're coming back
[31:07] to God being our
[31:10] everything
[31:12] all first John 4 beloved believe not
[31:15] every Spirit but try the spirits whether
[31:18] they are of God because many false
[31:20] prophets are into the
[31:26] world
[31:32] and every spirit that confesses not that
[31:34] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh not of
[31:37] God and this is the that Spirit of
[31:40] antichrist where you have heard that it
[31:42] should come even now already is in the
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] world they are of the world therefore
[31:56] they speak
[31:58] of the world and the
[32:13] world thank you Lord he said the truth
[32:16] the life and the way beloved let us love
[32:19] one another for love is of God and
[32:21] everyone that love is born of God and
[32:24] know
[32:26] God
[32:31] in this was manifested the love of God
[32:33] towards us because that God sent his
[32:35] only begotten son into the world that he
[32:38] might
[32:49] live God us we are also to love one
[32:56] another
[33:03] [Music]
[33:05] that that we dwell in him and he in us
[33:09] because he had given us his
[33:19] Spirit shall confess that Jesus is the
[33:21] son of God God dwelleth in him and and
[33:24] he in
[33:25] God
[33:36] here is our love perfect that we may
[33:40] have boldness in the day of judgment
[33:42] because he is so are we in this
[33:49] [Applause]
[33:55] world
[33:58] and we love him because he first loved
[34:21] us God bless you Happy New Year
[34:25] Amen brother
[34:35] [Music]
[34:46] brother th anywhere
[34:54] else I I I I'm going to change my with
[34:58] me to Second Corinthians theth chapter
[35:02] morning we started there I was thinking
[35:06] this
[35:07] morning also with what Brother Don said
[35:10] and what that four chapter of
[35:14] John this is this is the last in that
[35:18] first devotional I'll just
[35:24] read what really struck me God saying in
[35:27] this quote I'll just read it and say
[35:28] what came to my mind it comes out of
[35:31] Revelations 22nd chap 20th
[35:35] verse and this is what that scripture
[35:38] says he that testify these things say
[35:40] surely I come quickly amen even so come
[35:44] Lord Jesus so that's one of the last
[35:47] verses in the Bible and this is what
[35:49] brother Brown have say this is the
[35:51] December 31st the
[35:54] devotional if I wanted to know what time
[35:56] it is it was my watch that's pretty
[36:00] simple if I wanted to know what day of
[36:03] the week we was living in for the month
[36:06] of the year I would look at the calendar
[36:09] and he goes on saying if I want to know
[36:11] the approaching time of this great event
[36:13] I look at God's word it tells the time
[36:17] when it's at hand for the Bible said
[36:20] when these things begin to come to us
[36:22] lift up your your Redemption is dra the
[36:26] time
[36:28] right word scure that you all read in it
[36:34] will such a great
[36:38] to when he St the prev of the coming of
[36:42] the Lord when saw the that rested upon
[36:47] un and
[36:50] CH it hasn't changed at all and the
[36:53] blessings that rest upon the believer he
[36:55] stringed out even so come Lord Jesus and
[36:59] it goes back to what we were reading in
[37:00] this fourth chapter of John said I've
[37:03] lost my place he said even so come j so
[37:07] thr heart that after he had seen the
[37:11] events before it coming he
[37:13] scream so Jesus when the whole church
[37:17] had passed you he seen everything in the
[37:21] way Happ come Lord Jesus I'm not this
[37:26] keep saying this one thing here come
[37:29] Lord Jesus it must be a glorious thing
[37:31] that the com of the Lord
[37:34] dra even in John's day was such a
[37:37] glorious thing that he seen in Vision
[37:40] every time he thought about it he got
[37:42] happy his whole Spirit desired for that
[37:45] day and then he finishes here Jesus went
[37:48] his disciples had got to a place that
[37:51] they were looking at the caral or the
[37:53] natural PL of the Earth this is what I
[37:55] was thinking about
[37:57] now here we want to stop just a few
[37:59] minutes it doesn't have to always be
[38:01] caral that draw
[38:04] brother belever here it's not that
[38:07] burden your of sin but sometimes you can
[38:10] burden yourself with the good things of
[38:13] life that God you can spend so much time
[38:16] in the good things that you're not doing
[38:18] the things you need to be doing you go
[38:21] and
[38:21] say I lost my I'm sorry about that now
[38:25] we want to stop just for a few minutes
[38:28] it doesn't have to always be the car
[38:30] that draws us away sometimes it's just
[38:32] the natural things which
[38:35] draws Jesus disciples were pointing him
[38:37] to the Great temple where God and Glory
[38:41] appeared and the Hest the Hest and when
[38:44] they told him how goodly the stones were
[38:46] placed how great the masterminds of God
[38:49] are ordained these Stones were cut in
[38:52] many places and this you can go back to
[38:55] God's word you can go back to Solomon
[38:57] built the temple he built the blueprint
[38:59] he had when they rebuilt it again they
[39:02] always went to the blueprint and places
[39:04] in the world come together years direct
[39:09] there wasn't even a saw or sound of a
[39:11] hammer so Mass put together so
[39:15] brother the disciples were looking at
[39:17] that great Temple it was a good thing
[39:20] they buil it purpose was good but they
[39:22] were spending so much time looking at
[39:24] that not looking at what they needed to
[39:26] look that and how God had come over the
[39:29] Jans and showed for the glory and how
[39:33] they had a great hope in this great
[39:35] church and I was just thinking this
[39:38] morning we can
[39:40] spend days and weeks and years Desiring
[39:43] good things and yet missing the most
[39:46] important thing which is the presence of
[39:49] Jesus Christ in our hearts and you run
[39:51] after all they're good things I'm
[39:54] brother saying they're not bad things
[39:56] but if you find yourself dwelling in
[39:59] things too much that don't mean anything
[40:01] in the end then it's not doing you any
[40:04] good and he goes on and he finishes here
[40:07] and Jesus told them see not all these
[40:10] things yet it was a holy place it was a
[40:12] good place it was a place house the
[40:15] dwelling of the Lord but Jesus said
[40:17] don't see these things I've got
[40:19] something to tell you that's far greater
[40:21] than this and it goes back to what we
[40:23] were reading in John and goes back to
[40:25] the scriptures that starts this whole
[40:27] this whole quote here I've got something
[40:30] to tell you far greater than this for
[40:32] there's coming a time he said that there
[40:35] will not be one stone left upon the
[40:37] other and we have that promise this
[40:38] morning not this scripture but the
[40:40] scriptures in
[40:42] Revelation excuse me that the whole
[40:45] world is going to go into chaos one day
[40:48] and the only place of safety is in Jesus
[40:51] Christ this morning and he finishes here
[40:54] no matter how well how well we try to
[40:56] take care of our physical being and no
[40:58] matter how hard we work together for our
[41:01] organization and how hard we work in the
[41:03] church for our orders of the
[41:06] church there's coming a time when all
[41:08] those things will vanish and pass away
[41:10] and I was thinking what do we you know
[41:13] there's a lot of things the last year I
[41:15] probably spent my time in that weren't
[41:18] really as important as I thought they
[41:20] were and there are things I should have
[41:22] done that are more important than the
[41:24] things I did and I I'll just sit down
[41:26] after we read this chapter but I've
[41:28] always liked this chapter in uh 2
[41:31] Corinthians the 5th and one of the
[41:33] scriptures that was on the board this
[41:35] morning is at the end of this and I'll
[41:37] just read a few of these verses I know I
[41:39] say that and I wind up reading the whole
[41:41] chapter youall have to forgive me and uh
[41:45] I
[41:46] can't put any pressures on my nasal
[41:50] cavities for a few more weeks but I'll
[41:52] read this for we know that if our
[41:54] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[41:57] dissolved and we have and we have a
[42:00] building of God a house not made with
[42:02] hands Eternal in the heavens that's our
[42:03] hope this morning you all have a house
[42:06] you have a Dwelling Place on the other
[42:08] side of this life this morning that
[42:10] you're going to and that's the hope
[42:12] that's in us this morning for this we
[42:15] grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[42:17] upon with our house which is from Heaven
[42:19] that's that inner man inside you
[42:21] Desiring to be in that house one day
[42:25] that's that Holy Spirit holy ghost that
[42:27] God gave you it desires that that
[42:29] presence that change and it goes on to
[42:32] say if it's so be that being clothed we
[42:35] shall not be found naked for we are
[42:38] excuse me for we are we that are in this
[42:41] Tabernacle do grown being burdened not
[42:44] for what we would be unclothed but
[42:46] clothed upon the mortality might be
[42:48] swallowed up of life now he that hath
[42:51] wrought us for the selfs same thing is
[42:54] God who ha given unto us the earnest of
[42:57] the spirit that's where we're at this
[42:58] morning therefore we are always
[43:01] confident in knowing that we we're at
[43:04] home in the body we are absent from the
[43:06] Lord for we walk by faith and not by
[43:09] sight that's our whole thought this
[43:11] morning everything we do is by faith in
[43:14] Jesus Christ this morning you can't let
[43:16] the things you see going on in the world
[43:19] the things that might be going on in
[43:20] your family the things that might be
[43:22] going on in the church you can't let
[43:24] that all those pictures distract you
[43:27] from the most important purpose and then
[43:29] to be there on that day I lost my place
[43:33] I and he goes we we are confident say
[43:36] and willing rather to be absent from the
[43:38] body to be present with the Lord that's
[43:40] every Christian's hope there this
[43:42] morning this morning wherefore we labor
[43:45] that we whether present or absent we may
[43:48] be accepted of him for we must all
[43:51] appear before the Judgment seat of
[43:53] Christ that everyone may receive the
[43:55] things done in his body according to
[43:58] what has done whether it be good or bad
[43:59] and I was thinking from that quote this
[44:01] morning no as Christians sometimes you
[44:04] can spend spend your whole life running
[44:06] after things that I'm not repeating
[44:09] myself that are good things but in the
[44:12] end do they really matter the only thing
[44:14] that really matters is you're running
[44:16] after the one thing the sole purpose of
[44:19] this journey on this life this morning
[44:21] is to be ready to stand before the
[44:23] presence of Jesus Christ Brother David
[44:37] amen you love him this morning amen amen
[44:40] I I know why brother Thomas come out
[44:42] because my speaker back there it wasn't
[44:44] working I thought well that one there's
[44:47] kind of tricky you have to mess with it
[44:49] and then it'll decide it wants to
[44:51] work there we go we're loud and clear
[44:55] how many loves the Lord this morning
[44:57] amen let's give the Lord a hand of
[44:58] praise and stand this morning
[45:02] amen let's sing that little course if we
[45:04] could this morning praise him praise him
[45:06] praise him in the morning praise him in
[45:08] the noon time this morning
[45:12] amen Oh
[45:14] Praise Him oh
[45:18] praise
[45:19] him praise him in the
[45:23] morning praise him in the
[45:26] [Music]
[45:28] praise him oh
[45:31] praise
[45:33] him praise him till the sun goes down
[45:38] love him this morning why don't you
[45:43] love oh
[45:45] love
[45:47] him love him in the

[1:39:16] elected woman to the elected lady those
[1:39:19] who got before the for the foundation of
[1:39:21] the world called out and ordained them
[1:39:25] to that the rest of them will never see
[1:39:30] it how many knows Jesus said you can
[1:39:33] discern the skies and the signs of the
[1:39:36] times you can't
[1:39:38] discern you know when it's R in the
[1:39:40] morning and when it's red at night and
[1:39:42] so forth red in the morning sailor's
[1:39:45] warning red at night sailor ju light
[1:39:47] amen G to be good weather G be G bad
[1:39:49] weather but people can't see the
[1:39:52] hour that we're living in how many know
[1:39:54] like we said Wednesday amen they didn't
[1:39:57] know who Jesus
[1:39:59] was even marrying them no doubt didn't
[1:40:02] think that it would come to
[1:40:06] that that he would have to die such a
[1:40:08] terrible death things went s went so bad
[1:40:12] for
[1:40:13] him huh until after Peter denied him
[1:40:18] three times he went out and wept
[1:40:20] bitterly
[1:40:22] you can imagine just a bitterness that
[1:40:24] Peter was in and the rest of the
[1:40:27] disciples that they were in but from
[1:40:30] that spring forth something isin't that
[1:40:32] right amen it was a new
[1:40:36] beginning all right let's go let's start
[1:40:38] on this thought here in the beginning
[1:40:40] God created the heavens and the
[1:40:45] Earth praise the
[1:40:47] Lord now we know that God God said I am
[1:40:53] the
[1:40:54] beginning and the
[1:40:58] ending not is he only the beginning but
[1:41:00] he's also the end he's to start and he's
[1:41:05] to
[1:41:06] finish I want to try to May in a little
[1:41:09] bit we want to talk about God's Great
[1:41:10] Symphony brother bandham tried to in a
[1:41:12] natural way to express this word and how
[1:41:15] it's expressed and how it's manifested
[1:41:17] it's like a great Symphony that's played
[1:41:19] out amen it has a lot of Junction it has
[1:41:23] a lot of turns it's got stops it's got
[1:41:26] high places it's got Low
[1:41:28] Places and they're right that's the way
[1:41:30] the world's been it's had a lot of high
[1:41:32] places it's got a lot of Low Places and
[1:41:36] here at the beginning it was truly the
[1:41:39] beginning of a new time a new
[1:41:42] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:41:47] the Earth how long was that beginning I
[1:41:50] don't know
[1:41:51] how long was it before he ever created
[1:41:53] before he even started before even God
[1:41:56] started your mind and my mind can't
[1:42:00] comprehend how much eons of time because
[1:42:03] it wasn't really any time but how so
[1:42:07] it's a irrelevant statement but he was
[1:42:10] in eternity and to think that God always
[1:42:14] was let me blows
[1:42:18] that always was
[1:42:22] always will be and anything that has a
[1:42:25] beginning has an end brother Brandman
[1:42:28] later in his life he talked about being
[1:42:30] an attribute in order to be Eternal you
[1:42:32] have to be an attribute of God and he
[1:42:34] says that's why this Earth is going to
[1:42:36] make it through because it was an
[1:42:38] attribute of God just like you're an
[1:42:39] attribute of God I mean know you in
[1:42:42] order to have eternal life you have to
[1:42:44] be a part of God cuz that's the only
[1:42:47] thing that is eternal and
[1:42:51] is God and it has to be associated with
[1:42:54] him an attribute of
[1:42:56] his it begin created the heavens and the
[1:43:02] Earth
[1:43:04] why might not mean much to somebody that
[1:43:07] just hears in the beginning God created
[1:43:11] the heavens and the Earth but it may
[1:43:13] means more to us when we realize that
[1:43:16] you was in those thoughts that's right
[1:43:19] he had you in his
[1:43:22] [Applause]
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:25] mind I think it should make us all Brave
[1:43:29] when God thought of you being in this
[1:43:31] worst age that ever was but this is the
[1:43:33] worst age ever this the most sinful most
[1:43:37] dangerous age of all times this is the
[1:43:41] darkest of all
[1:43:43] ages
[1:43:46] amen we say that a
[1:43:49] lot we talk about how horrible the world
[1:43:56] is amen but we'll get into that
[1:44:00] later and wouldn't it be sad if that's
[1:44:02] all we could talk
[1:44:04] about if we didn't have another side to
[1:44:07] it if it truly was all darkness and you
[1:44:11] was a part of
[1:44:12] it I believe his comes to my mind he
[1:44:15] says you know ahead what lays ahead as
[1:44:18] we look into the future for the
[1:44:21] unbeliever it's the most horrible
[1:44:24] time but for us it's the most glorious
[1:44:31] time you can have a smile if you're a
[1:44:34] Christian you can have a
[1:44:36] smile cu the world don't have a
[1:44:38] smile the world isn't happy right it's
[1:44:42] the saddest time for them ever they
[1:44:46] don't have no peace there is no peace
[1:44:47] for the wicked there is no rest for the
[1:44:51] wicked amen they have no peace they have
[1:44:54] no rest but our Prophet come along he
[1:44:56] says to the ble lady he said Shalom to
[1:44:59] you peace to
[1:45:02] you I want to say this morning I believe
[1:45:05] that we have more peace than we've ever
[1:45:08] had people in this message that truly
[1:45:10] have the message in their heart you've
[1:45:12] got more peace than anybody does you can
[1:45:15] rest assured and
[1:45:17] know that God is real that God is alive
[1:45:20] that you want to hear oh my on and on
[1:45:24] and on a rest unlike anything you've
[1:45:27] ever a PE that passes understanding even
[1:45:31] Luther and Wesley didn't have the peace
[1:45:33] that you did cuz they didn't have the
[1:45:35] light that you did they didn't have the
[1:45:37] assurance that you did that you do how
[1:45:40] many believe
[1:45:41] that oh thank you Lord thank you
[1:45:46] Jesus so let's take a little journey
[1:45:49] down through time shall we praise the
[1:45:53] Lord take a little journey down through
[1:45:57] time
[1:45:58] amen it was the
[1:46:01] beginning it wasn't very long we don't
[1:46:04] know how long do we how long was it
[1:46:08] perhaps a question brother Woody we can
[1:46:10] ask when we get over there how long was
[1:46:13] Adam and Eve in that perfect
[1:46:15] State before the serpent actually
[1:46:18] beguiled
[1:46:19] her huh
[1:46:21] how
[1:46:23] long amen
[1:46:26] before A New Beginning happened and it
[1:46:30] was a terrible beginning wasn't it after
[1:46:33] the fall it was a sad sad
[1:46:38] beginning
[1:46:41] amen before
[1:46:45] that Adam could go outside of his house
[1:46:48] said look I want one of them Evergreens
[1:46:50] on the corner of my house I want this
[1:46:52] kind of a plant all the way through here

[1:47:06] in the Millennium we'll build houses and
[1:47:08] inhabit them and another won't inhabit
[1:47:10] it how many knows if this is a type of
[1:47:12] the real is that right then perhaps
[1:47:15] we'll do all of
[1:47:18] that amen you want something with a
[1:47:21] round Stairway to your next and upper
[1:47:24] Place yeah you want a big glass window
[1:47:27] you know overlooking a great what is
[1:47:29] your heart's desire

[1:47:33] huh maybe you like the desert and you
[1:47:35] want to live in a place like Arizona or
[1:47:37] whatever it might be the desert is but B

[1:47:41] folks that's
[1:47:44] right am maybe you like oh my up in
[1:47:47] Canada and way up in them mountains

[1:48:09] something beautiful but God gave me
[1:48:11] something a little bit different I sit
[1:48:14] on my back patio and I look at a big
[1:48:17] hole all the way down to the creek and I
[1:48:19] always I wish I was young enough to put
[1:48:21] me a big old cable down there grab a
[1:48:23] hold of that cable strap me and and fly

[1:48:38] Adam and Eve amen for a long time until
[1:48:41] that slithering serpent I would say
[1:48:44] snake but he wasn't the snake
[1:48:48] yet amen he had a snake in his heart
[1:48:51] amen when and come and told Eve you know
[1:48:54] you could be a lot
[1:48:56] smarter you can improve on what you
[1:48:58] think you could be like us you could be
[1:49:00] like a God knowing good and evil and he
[1:49:03] seduced her isn't that

[1:49:20] your serpent seed as plain as
[1:49:24] day how many know if king would have
[1:49:26] been God's child when God gave him the
[1:49:28] opportunity he to repent and said oh God

[1:49:34] does oh my but kain's children don't

[2:05:37] people terrible place that the world is
[2:05:41] in but not the to the Living
[2:05:46] God Seven
[2:05:49] billion people I asked Syria a while ago
[2:05:52] how many people it said seven billion
[2:05:55] people on the
[2:05:58] Earth I know none of us really can
[2:06:01] imagine
[2:06:02] that if I'm not wrong 1000 million is a
[2:06:06] billion right 1000
[2:06:10] million so I guess it'd be 700 million
[2:06:15] right 700 million
[2:06:19] would be seven
[2:06:22] billion that's a lot of
[2:06:25] folks that's a lot of
[2:06:28] people there's a lot of folks out there
[2:06:33] people and most of is Canon
[2:06:36] father all of them's going to die
[2:06:42] huh every one of us think we're so
[2:06:47] special
[2:06:49] and I said guess we should because you
[2:06:51] are uniquely made by almighty God but
[2:06:55] I'm here to tell you that if God hasn't
[2:06:58] done something in your
[2:06:59] heart if he doesn't save you it have
[2:07:02] been better for you not that been born
[2:07:04] and if you are
[2:07:05] saved if you are saved if you have the
[2:07:08] Holy
[2:07:10] Ghost you shouldn't barely be able to
[2:07:12] keep your
[2:07:15] seats cuz it wasn't you it wasn't you it
[2:07:20] was all him why do you think the devil
[2:07:23] can't conquer you it's because you
[2:07:25] didn't start work he started the work
[2:07:27] he's going to sustain you and he's going
[2:07:30] to finish
[2:07:31] [Applause]
[2:07:32] it aren't you glad to be in his hands I
[2:07:35] believe we need to be surrendered to God
[2:07:38] more than what we ever have our
[2:07:42] Wills amen and I also believe that our
[2:07:45] treasure needs to be on things
[2:07:47] above not on things of this Earth cuz
[2:07:52] Jesus said where your treasure is that's
[2:07:54] where your heart's going to be also I
[2:07:57] want the whole world to know where my
[2:08:00] treasure is amen praise the Lord what I
[2:08:04] treasure praise the
[2:08:06] Lord and that's God that's the Lord
[2:08:09] Jesus Christ and the things of
[2:08:15] God thank you Lord
[2:08:17] Jesus

[2:09:07] start amen even the beginning of the
[2:09:09] creation of God Amen Mark says this is

[2:13:25] old
[2:13:29] amen but this new
[2:13:32] man that's born again not of the will of
[2:13:35] Flesh not of the will of
[2:13:39] man a't that nice all the father has
[2:13:43] given me will
[2:13:45] come inside of this flesh there had to
[2:13:48] be that germ of life that seed of God
[2:13:54] laying that's what gives you that desire
[2:13:57] to want to go to church that's what
[2:13:59] gives you the desire to want to be a
[2:14:01] better Christian than what you
[2:14:05] are oh my how many believe it's the
[2:14:07] rising of the Sun God is quickening his
[2:14:10] children with that sunlight but Abraham
[2:14:13] says you know if your word I mean your
[2:14:15] flesh gets quickened by the word of God
[2:14:19] he says When God Says something your
[2:14:21] flesh quickly turns to it is that right
[2:14:24] it quickly comes subject to it amen and
[2:14:27] it shows that you've got a Resurrection
[2:14:29] coming cuz how many knows as we subject
[2:14:32] to the word and mean the word says this
[2:14:34] and say oh that's me the preaching sure
[2:14:36] stepping on my toes but Lord help me
[2:14:40] quickly comes into it because one of
[2:14:42] these days the very Adams in this flesh
[2:14:45] will come subject to the word of God
[2:14:48] when the Trump of God down the dead
[2:14:50] shall rise amen and then we which are
[2:14:53] alive will be changed in the moment in
[2:14:56] the twinkling of an eye this flesh will
[2:14:59] come subject to God's command it's time
[2:15:02] to come up higher to change bodies amen
[2:15:07] but if your body if people will not come
[2:15:09] subject to the word of God huh they
[2:15:13] won't come Quicken they their soul isn't
[2:15:15] doesn't Quicken to the word come alive
[2:15:18] to the word no I don't believe that how
[2:15:22] are they ever going to get a body change
[2:15:24] how are they ever going to come up in
[2:15:26] the resurrection when they wouldn't even
[2:15:28] allow God to bring them to the place to
[2:15:30] where they were ready for a change how
[2:15:33] many these God has to make is ready for
[2:15:35] a change and that's what he's
[2:15:39] doing folks if I'm here to tell you if
[2:15:41] Thomas berer wasn't preaching the word
[2:15:42] of God and the truth of God this church
[2:15:44] didn't believe the word of God didn't
[2:15:45] want to hear I find me a church that did
[2:15:48] where the word of God is going forth and
[2:15:50] changing people's lives how many
[2:15:53] believes it's about the word of God not
[2:15:54] me or the preacher any it's about the
[2:15:56] holy spirit it's about God about people
[2:15:58] that loves the Lord that wants to change
[2:16:00] even better B says I tell you right now
[2:16:03] me when I want be on the curtain of time
[2:16:04] I've seen all of that and unless you've
[2:16:05] got perfect love you'll never enter into
[2:16:08] there he says and I tell you people
[2:16:10] don't stay on the same conditions that
[2:16:13] you are amen change now how many believe
[2:16:16] God is in the changing a heart lives
[2:16:22] business there's something seriously
[2:16:25] wrong with
[2:16:26] you if you were the same in
[2:16:30] 2023 as you was in
[2:16:37] 2022 there's going to be something
[2:16:39] seriously wrong with you if you're the
[2:16:42] same in 2024 as you was in
[2:16:46] 2023
[2:16:48] and we can't just turn new

[2:25:41] great for the believer yes you could
[2:25:43] have the greatest chaos they could shut
[2:25:45] this place down but for us it's still
[2:25:48] going to be greater than ever yes why
[2:25:52] because we know that the scripture says
[2:25:54] that when they shut her up we can run
[2:25:56] the aisles until they chase us out then
[2:25:59] we're going to go out on the streets and
[2:26:00] we're going to run the streets because
[2:26:02] this word says when they shut they won't
[2:26:04] shut her up but she's going to go up
[2:26:06] they try to shut her up she's going to
[2:26:08] go up yes we'll know the time is there
[2:26:11] yes amen it's got to get
[2:26:14] worse in this world Amen
[2:26:17] but not for his people it's going to get
[2:26:19] better you may lose all possessions yep
[2:26:24] amen but Braham talked about us losing
[2:26:26] stuff that's right all kinds of stuff
[2:26:28] ain't no telling what all we'll lose yet
[2:26:31] right huh just one little in I didn't go
[2:26:34] in a whole page or two but where but
[2:26:38] talked about how that the prophecy that
[2:26:39] we've seen him come to pass he says
[2:26:42] watch for the signs of the time watch
[2:26:43] for the moving of the drums and the
[2:26:45] symphony you know you know what's going
[2:26:47] to happen next you know and so forth and
[2:26:49] then you look at the signs of the time
[2:26:51] he said it's in our papers it's this
[2:26:53] that or the other and how many knows
[2:26:54] over in New York they're trying to pass
[2:26:56] a law to try to make Chick-fil-A open on
[2:27:00] Sunday
[2:27:01] amen I mean not Billy Graham but uh
[2:27:04] Graham the senator he says This Means
[2:27:07] War well we've been in war for a long
[2:27:10] time I wouldn't doubt but they'll win
[2:27:12] when you got judges that side with such
[2:27:14] what chance do you have isn't that right
[2:27:16] right
[2:27:17] amen they want to shut them down they
[2:27:18] want to pressure them to make them do
[2:27:22] against their own religion ain't that
[2:27:25] right and when you see that squeeze
[2:27:27] begin to come down folks lift up your
[2:27:30] heads I think brother Brian read it in
[2:27:32] Sunday school so about lift up your
[2:27:34] heads when these things happen your
[2:27:36] Redemption is drawing nigh how
[2:27:38] many are Redemption is drawing nigh we
[2:27:43] see the signs we see the world getting
[2:27:45] darker but we see a group
[2:27:47] people all over the world not just here
[2:27:50] but we see them getting on fire we see
[2:27:53] God doing something changing us amen oh
[2:27:56] my let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we
