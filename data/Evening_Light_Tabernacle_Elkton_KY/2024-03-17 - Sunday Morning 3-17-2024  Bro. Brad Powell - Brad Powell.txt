TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] e [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Applause] the [Music] [Music] in [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] all [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] you [Music] for [Music] e [Music] St [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning if we all would just stand and the children can be dismissed for Sunday school brother Tommy would you open us up in a word of [Music] Prayer so we pray speak to our hearts and amen amen if we would turn to 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost [Music] for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake but we have this treasure in Earth and vessel that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh we having the same Spirit of Faith according as as it is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak for for all things are for your sakes that the abundance that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving many read down to the glory of [Music] God for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seeing our Eternal brother Troy good morning brothers and sisters all right well trying to get a little something together for Sunday school and of course how things go it seems like things always are struggle or things try to tend to go wrong but as brother Steve said that's that's how it goes that's life and then in ourselves if it was in ourselves we we wouldn't make it but it's not in ourselves to do it he said that he'd be with us even in us till the end of the world and and that's what we rest on but uh I had kind of a just a pull together just a a couple uh little things just a couple scriptures and then uh I was listening to brother brandom and I thought it'd kind of be neat because he goes over so many questions and answers actually we listening to One of brother Billy Paul's questions and answers that he did so many years ago and uh and it was to directed or towards kids but I thought that was really uh nice sometimes you have questions and so I just picked out uh couple questions here that brother brandham had went over and uh I thought we'd go over those so in the scripture uh it was Romans pertain to this one here Romans I think it's four let me see here of course like I said when uh when uh you think things are going to work out for you sometimes it don't work out like like we plann them to work out uh the pr it works really good when the kids are printing pictures to color but then this morning it didn't work and Robin was bragging about the printer she said it's a really good printer well this morning it doesn't print from my phone so I have to send it to Robin's phone then then I start printing it then the first page is folded then it jams and you can't of course I never messed with this printer so then you got to get all the back off or whatever to get the jam out but anyway it did work out but it's just how things like to go especially on Sunday mornings sometimes but you know uh if we brother Brandon said if we wouldn't have these issues come up what would be the you know the reward so we we have to push through the things that come up and and keep moving on but uh let's see Romans me make sure here I think it's it's Romans 46 and and Paul says in here therefore it is of faith that it might be grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to all that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all is as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations for before him whom even God who Quicken the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he had that what he had promised he was able also it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again to our justification let's has this question here simple little question but a helpful question as we go through life brother BR he this person says please explain to how a person knows if he is thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make make him think wrong especially if you know you do not want to think them then if it brother R says then if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking if it's w if it's with the word it's God's thinking if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil if it's good thoughts of the word and of God it's God's thinking if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it how may it be overcome or got rid of brother Bren says take the vice very vice versa from it if the devil makes you think that uh you are if you know you're a Christian if the devil makes you think that you that you are if you know you're a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian he says just take the vice versa and say I am a Christian as long as your experience matches in God's word says say I am a Christian anything else the same way when you answer this please pray the man says when you answer this or the person uh please pray for me to overcome this as I'm am not by myself and brother BR says God grant you overcoming ever who you are may your thoughts just go right back to the other side and say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no hold on me and then I thought this was interesting brother Brenham says here frankly he says I'm standing right here now saying the same thing keep me from fainting right here at the pulpit that's right four or five times I've almost pitched over on the pulpit that's the truth God knows that's right when a person realizes so that's brother Brenham then saying about what he's going through uh and that's so true uh we have to put as Believers you have to learn how to push through different things but uh and what an example brother Brenham was and that's with healing or anything that you have in your life so the person goes on and to say when a person realizes he has an inferior complex or some sort of complex how may he overcome this so should it be if he was the only child causes uh in his youth maybe early he says take exactly the opposite if you're always wait want wanting your way and that one little brat that wants to always have everything your way turn right back and around and give everything you got the other way if you're selfish and you want to hold everything then start giving away what you got see do whatever just go the vice versa that's the way to overcome anything it is an antidote you've uh my old southern mom mother used to say hair off the dog back is good for the bite and that applies this way too then he goes on to say brother random what achievement should we let our okay this is a different one here and then I was going to read this this uh verse to go with it I think good all right so uh and this is James 3 we're going to James 3 you can go with her if you want but you don't have to if you don't want says starting in verse three my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as perfect man enable also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the H's mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven by of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small hand whatsoever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defile the whole body and Seth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of Beast and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessings and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so do the fountain send forth of the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear allive berries either of Vine figs so can no both yield salt water and fresh who is the wise men and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation as works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be treated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy the fruit of righteousness is swn in peace of them that make peace then the question comes up brother Brandon when some of someone gets on me or steps on my toes this might be a good one steps on my toes as the old saying goes my temper Rises how can I overcome this thing I know the Lord will have to do it but what can I do in my heart I don't want this thing brother venam says sweeten your temper with prayer then make up your mind there I don't guess there's too many people in this building ever had any more temper than I did begin with he said I had a mouth that was mashed all the time taken a lot of my meals out of a straw my mother as you know was a half Indian my father was Irishman a Kentucky Irishman at that and everyone both of them had enough temper to fight a buz saw all the time my mouth was mashed I was a little I was little to be with and they just picked me up and knocked me down and I'd get up again and they knocked me down again till I got till I just got too able and unable to get up anymore that's all that's always and then when I got up able to get up I got up again they knocked me down again so that's just the way I had it I thought I can never be a Christian but when the Holy Spirit came into my life that that's what done it he said I had a woman one time I went to have to cut the lights off and that day I had a a hair on top of my head and she said you kinky you little kinky headed idiotic I told her I said woman you ought not to curse like that uh don't you fear God she said you little kinky eded idiotic if I wanted somebody to talk to me about things like that I would wouldn't get a half fo like you he said what he said uh then she called me a blankety blank name and uh if that had been a year farther I always said a man that strike a woman Wasn't Man Enough to strike a man but I might have broke that at that time of calling my mother a bad name like that he said but you know what he said it never even fased me I said I will pray for you never bothered I know right then something had happened to me yes sir oh my you know the evils that I done when I was a kid fighting almost killed five men at one time took a rifle loaded with 16 shots when then boys beat me up because I was a Kentucky and no other reason I couldn't even hold my head up one would hold me by hands like this and the other one would stand there with a rock in his hand and pound me in the face till I just lifeless nothing in the world they called me a Kentucky squab because my mother when she was young she sure looked like an Indian look looking at her picture a while ago and they know she was a half Indian because I was was from Kentucky and being a squab they called me a squab a Kentucky squab and I had nothing in the world to do into it couldn't help because I was born in Kentucky I went down there to school and I didn't have no clothes to wear and my hair hanging down on my neck Papa mom took pop sold coat if kids think they might have it bad today this this is uh at a different level than what a lot of these kids have today but Mom Pop and mom took Pop's old coat and he was that he was married in and cut it up and made me a pair of pants to wear to school my first time and she dressed me with a pair of white stockings on and a pair of tennis shoes and they said if you don't look like a windy kuckian and all of that and then they went that went all the all my all my school days he said and all and a couple of boys because I walked down the road with some little girl and packed her books they didn't want me to do that they met me down there and beat me till I was simply unconscious I told them if they just let me go I promised I would go right straight home and so they took let me loose kicked me four or five times knocked him down scraped my face all over and I went home like this up through the broom Sage field had a little 22 Winchester rifle laying up over the door reached up and got that rifle full of bullets went right down through the Locust Thicket hid by the side of the road till these five or six boys came along and just waited till they come when they was coming there talking said that Kentuckian will realize where he's at from this on going on like that he said I stepped up with the hammer pulled back on the rifle I said now which one of you wants to die first so you don't so you don't watch the others they started squealing I said don't squeal because you're all going to die one by one and I Meed and just then they started squealing and I pulled up up and snaap the gun snapped I throw another shell in snaap it snapped another shell snap it snapped and a pump 16 shells on the ground every one of them snapped and then boys running and screaming and driving over the hill and and everything and after they left I stood there when I'd got so angry till I wouldn't cry just would laugh like a idiot and tears run down in my eyes now that's a temper if it hadn't been for God i' had been a murderer and I picked up them shells and put them back in the rifle and pow pow they'd shoot just as good as ever and brother brenon says talk about Grace and that is with it is so with all our lives it's just the grace of the Lord that keeps us the grace of the Lord that saved us and the of the Lord that surely's ke kept us and going to keep us and just like I said this morning it seemed like everything everything well you don't want to say everything that could go wrong but it seemed like lots of stuff was going wrong of course then you know uh it's just one of those things but thanks thanks be to the grace of the Lord and uh that's one thing that I always go back to you know if we had something to do with it I'd be worried about it but he said he started the work into it in it in us and he's more than able to finish the work and that's where I I rest myself on this morning brother Steve I think all of us can identify with uh what brother Troy was talking about if it wasn't for the grace of God my my and thankfully he's not a respector a person or age or anything he can deal

something about this song because I don't want people to think that I'm thinking because I have my cancer that I'm dying so I'm not um I just want to share this because I heard this song several months ago and and it does have some questions that we all need to ask ourselves we never know what tomorrow brings and I mean God could call us home tomorrow we could all go in the Rapture and this is something I think even myself and all of us we need to think [Music] about in the time that you gave me did I give all all I could give did I love all I could love did I live all our faith in your grace strong enough to save me did I do all I could do in the time that you gave me in the time that you gave me did I face the devil down did I make him turn away every time I stood my ground if

did all I could do in the time that you gave [Music] me that's a very thought provoking song right there and I think every one of us in here could raise their hand and say we didn't do everything but you know what Amazing Grace that's amen let's just stand because Brother Brad gets come ready to come out and sing Amazing Grace tell you so thankful for the grace of God Amazing Grace how sweet the

amen good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and thank the musicians for the music and brother Steve for filling in we appreciate that and and just a couple of things that I want to bring to your attention and um brother Bor and myself we' had a talk and got together and we we were kind of contemplating and mentioned the idea of a of a Teenage Sunday school um but I think brother B prayed about it and we were praying together and and the decis ision was made at this time we're just going to leave that teenage Sunday school kind of kind of to kind of the way it is for now um but we do want to offer the the uh um offer you the the ability or the chance to write questions and answers uh or questions I guess on things that you have and and brother Bor and myself will work together to try to take a service maybe on a Sunday afternoon he said and and we will answer any questions at the teenagers may have and if there's any adults that has a question related to the word or the message or or things that you've heard are just curious of we'd be glad to look at them and examine them and so uh you know teenagers especially go through times in their life they have questions and uh and and we definitely want those questions answered in a scriptural biblical way uh to lead and guide in in the direction that that they need to be going so I just want to put that out there if you want to jot down a question if you have a question you could give it to myself for Brother Steve uh a brother Bower when he's back so uh just let that be uh kind of out there an option for you also I want you to uh to I ask that you remember brother Ted Pedley and brother uh Zachary Wallace as they be leaving I think it's today for India and uh brother Ted uh had had messaged me last night and I'd known he was going to be leaving and we've been in prayer for him and but he just wants to bring it before the church and he he just loves loves the church here and the people and he knows your sincerity and your dedication and and he ask that you would pray for them they they've had a good work in the past over the past several years that they go to India and and so just ask the Lord to to bless them watch over them give them safe travels and uh just use them use them while they're there so we certainly don't want to spend effort and time and money and travel and and then not not be a a a benefit or or God use us so he wants to be used and brother Zachary wants to be used and so just just ask that you remember that and also continue to remember brother berer today I know brother Steve mentioned that but um be with him he wants he just he really has a burden for that area and he's expressed that with me and a couple times and so we just want to uh hold him up today that he could say what what they need to hear and that they would uh you know be encouraged and and grow in the word in that area so um just kind of let you know that right up front if you want to turn into your Bibles Psalms 23 let's just go before the Lord in prayer real quick and uh before we go into the reading of the word and bring these needs uh and before the Lord as we open the word Heavenly Father we come before you this morning with thankful Hearts thankful to be Christians and that you called us in a in a dark and dying world that we were called and chosen and before the foundation of the world you you saw us in your in your uh image and in in your likeness Lord and and called us to a higher calling and we we thank you for that this morning Lord and you've heard the needs of the people and you know the hearts desires that's sitting here this morning and we just ask Lord that you would uh be with brother Ted and brother Zachary as they travel and Grant them traveling mercies as they go and and uh just use them in a mighty way to the Saints and and those that are exploring the the gospel of the hour and and the message of the message of the hour and the gospel that you've given us in this day Lord Jesus and use them in a mighty way and also be with our pastor as we pray Lord that you would use him today and as as he teaches and leads and guides and and tries to be a true example and and to set forth in order the the way a church should be uh be run and orchestrated and and kind of help the Believers the new the new Believers there to go forward in the word Lord we just want to tell you we love you appreciate you and dedicate this this day into your hands and just ask that you speak to our hearts today in a mighty way and encourage us and just to help us to to move up and come up a little higher from where we were to yesterday Lord we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Christ's name amen before we turn to our scripture I want to read this little quote to you and it's not long so you you can endure a minute of standing maybe hopefully uh but brother Brown says you're always pointing out how Wicked the world is getting how many of us do that we always talk about every day how bad it's getting how how how terrible it is and the News talks about how bad the world's getting and and and we see it all around us he says but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting you know we can talk about the negative all we want but he says now but don't fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she is rising up he said she is rising up standing on the field oh she's a little fock but brother God is with her God is with her and she he's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead he says God's Church shall never fail he says the Gates of Hell sh shall not Prevail against it it showed that it would be against it we know all of hell is against us all of hell has got its sights pointed at the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Believers in this last day they may be against us he says but they cannot prevail the church is going to Triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ with a victory march brothers and sisters we're coming to a day when we're going to get ready to put away all discouragement all dis all the people that despise us all those that mock against us and we're going to do a victory march God yes sir I'm positive of this one thing he said that God will have a church without what spot a church without wrinkle a church without blemish and he says amen oh I'm so happy of that are you happy of that this morning that you're part of that number you're part of the one he's talking about that will live without a spot without a wrinkle without a blemish you say well I'm not there none of us are yet but we're trying to get there that's why we come and gather this morning to hear the word of God and say what is it God that I need to get me to a New Height if I need punishment it's hard to say punish me turn with me Psalms 23 familiar scripture I'm getting way ahead of myself but that's okay the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake now watch here here's what I was going to get to this is not the one we was wanting to get to but we got to it yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death corruption what do you think about when you think about death you think about corruption corruption is set in you think about death you think about corruption so here is this Valley of the shadow of death and here we are in corrupt bodies living in a corrupt world but thank God there's going to come a time when this corrupt body will put on incorruption when this Mortal body of mortality will put on immortality so that's where the next verse comes in so I will fear no evil for thou are with me thy Ro and my staff they comfort me aren't you thankful to have a Shepherd this morning who leads you and guide you and comfort you and is there with you in all things that you go through that's the God we serve thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over you mean to tell me we can live in a place like that where we're we're so anointed by the Holy Ghost and the oil of the holy spirit that our cup can run over in this corrupt and wicked nasty world we live in that's what the word says my cup runneth over he anoint my head with oil what is O It's the Holy Spirit God keep pouring God keep pouring down on us surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life we don't have to live defeated lives surely goodness and mercy were sheltered brothers and sisters in the Tabernacle of God's presence surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever secure in his Tabernacle one more quick scripture you don't have to turn there but Isaiah 40 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint you can have your seats now looking at this little thought here this morning it definitely went in a different direction from what I had had originally had thought we were going to go but I like the L leadership of the Lord and I trust it'll be a blessing to all of us so we either need it or God wouldn't have give it okay so we look here and the prophet says now I want you to watch the New Testament Christian how many's the New Testament Christian this morning I want you to watch the New Testament Christian he said see Paul he had Visions he started out one way got between Straits a vision coming over to Macedonia out on the sea 14 days and nights now watch the place he was in there was no moon no stars you know when you're out on the Seas you kind of need the moon and the stars in those days that's how they navigated and he said there was there was Paul out there on the sea 14 days with no moon no stars all hopes of ever being saved was gone what a place to be in think about it now he said but then all of a sudden the angel of the Lord come to him and said Don't Fear Paul you must go before Caesar and he said how Paul little Paul and that ship Still rocking and waterlog can you imagine the waves coming in the ter tulous waves coming in and overtaking maybe the boat the little ship and there's Paul rocking back and forth no stars no moon no hope all lost and then the angel comes to him and the angel Paul said he stood by him day and night he said it was just to show me he said that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ wasn't going to let Paul falter out there in the sea he knew exactly where Paul would be God knows when we find ourselves in our valleys God knows when you're going through despair God knows when you're going through discouragement and depression God knows that he knows when you can't see the sun the Stars the moon and there's no way around no way out and he says watch the New Testament Christian Paul he said Paul looking at someone and preaching and said I perceive that you have faith to be healed that's the New Testament Christian that's who we're talking about today you and I the New Testament Christian he said look at the New Testament Christian Peter Peter being in the spirit of the Holy Ghost come upon him he rebuked their sins and told him what they' done talking about an anas and Safar he said you see this practically the same thing happening Night by Night the Holy Spirit revealing and showing a new testament Christian brothers and sisters these men Paul Peter all these ones that was the the founders of our faith before us they found themselves in un predicaments un un un unimaginable predicaments but yet God was still there in their Valley God said Peter Paul even though you're in a valley in your life I will raise you to new heights and that's what I'm talking about that's my message this morning New Heights that's all I'm I'm naming it new heights and he's calling us up to a new heights the prophet said aren't you happy we should be the happiest people in the world that we're Christians living in this day friend this day the day that we said was the most wicked the most nastiest the most gnarliest the most out to get you day we should be the happiest people on the face of the Earth and he says right there he says we're the happiest people in the world he said don't look for anything greater because you can't have no greater than the Holy Spirit he said you got that right now just love it and embrace it and let it move for you and help you oh brothers and sisters I'm afraid that's where a lot of us get in trouble we get in trouble and he says each one of you listen to this he says you got it right now love it and embrace it each one of you what little faith that you've got tonight how many's got a little faith you said I don't have a lot but how many's got a little all right he says if you've got a little faith just turn it loose turn it loose he says turn it loose and let God have his way with you and God will grant it so many times we want to hold on to ourselves we want to embrace ourselves we want to love ourselves and we're not willing to turn loose of us we're not willing to turn loose this morning of the Securities of in our own life because as humans we want that that shelter we want that security and we think we're in control but that's not what God says that's not what the prophet says through the spoken word of God no he said if you've got a little faith turn it loose and let God have his way what does he mean by that he says now if you have the testified the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and he says he will testify me that I have told you the truth if he testifies that I have told you the truth then every one of you ought to believe on him he says now remember here's my words to You allall ears ought to be perked up right now cuz when the prophet says here's my words to you you might want to listen he says here's my words to You and every sinner every person every sinner that is here is already saved here's my words for you that every sinner has already been saved some 19900 years ago but it'll never do you no good unless you accept it all of these promises that lie in the book all of these promises that lie in the message brothers and sisters we have to accept it you can't just read it you can't just vocalize it you have to take possession of it and grab it and accept what God does for us every sick person every Afflicted person the blood of Jesus Christ is in Calvary right now and you were healed 1900 years ago but it'll do you no good if you don't accept it you just accept it and believe it and you will get well so today we're going to look at a few different thoughts going to spend quite a bit of time on who we are and a type of God's called us but I want you to know that over in Israel studying this out I found that over in Israel there's a road from Jerusalem to Jericho and there's a canyon called the valley of the shadow of death maybe some of you has been there and been been fortunate to travel maybe you've seen it or or read about it but no doubt King David probably traveled through this Valley many times in his life and some of these Canyons that run along the Jericho Road they were very narrow at the bottom and but on the walls on the sides of these canyons in this Valley it would be 800t tall now keep in mind there that the only time that you could see Sunshine at the bottom was at noon time when the sun is straight overhead can you imagine walking through this Canyon 800 foot walls on the side of you no sunlight but for just a few minutes of the day straight overhead is when the sun can hit you we feel like sometimes we get in a valley in a place in our lives that do the sun Even Shine I'm just being honest we've had a lot of uplift and feel-good messages but let me tell you life ain't always uplifting and good right sometimes Life's a struggle and sometimes we go through these valleys and and valleys often time we look and we know that valleys in the Bible it's a metaphor for difficult times times of Darkness times of Despair times of defeat times of discouragement how many's ever had those we all have and the Bible teaches us that God is Not Just God on the mountain toop but he's God in the valley as well and in these valleys is where we do some of our greatest growing now we may not like it but in The Valleys is where the most fertile ground is you know I had somebody come do a soil test on my property few years back because we seem like we couldn't grow grass in the pasture and it was just a just a rock hole and and so we couldn't grow but there had this one little Hillside over here and it kind of swept down into a bottom and they done the soil T test and they come back and they said yeah your soil's no good out here in this flat it's very poor very very poor it don't have a lot of nutrients it's don't have a lot of topsole but over here where the grass is growing what you've got is a lot of top soil what you got over there is a lot of nutrients and the reason you've got those I said well what's different I can see it all from the backyard what's different about it he said well what's different is it comes down out of that Hillside there and all that top soil runs off down into that Valley we need the valleys you say I don't want no valleys we need the valleys because in The Valleys is when you find out when you is when you call out to God with a different kind of urgency you talk to God different when you're in the valley you talk talk to God different in a different kind of urgency and it's when we see who we are it's when we see see what we're made of or might we say where the rubber meets the road is when we cry out to God in The Valleys many of us experienced those valleys and if you haven't experienced those valleys you will experience those valleys maybe someone here today is experiencing a valley let me tell you if you're wondering how will I ever see daylight in this Valley just look straight overhead just like on that road down there to Jerusalem to Jericho if you look straight up overhead you'll see the sun brothers and sisters we need the sunlight the s o n to come shine down on our lives and he's with us in these valleys valleys are part of this life valleys are inevitable valleys they they you find yourself in those valleys because that's life and and and you can't avoid these valleys and instead you can count on them they're going to be there they're going to they're going to come at you they'll be there you don't have to go looking for them you'll walk right into them valleys happen to everybody they're not they're they're impartial you ever notice good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people yeah it's part of life it's what we go through through because we're in a fallen and broken world so we have problems and nobody is immune to those problems but how do we handle it as Christian we're not insulated from Pain how many's ever went through pain you hurt you cry you you you you have anguish inside of you and you cry out and you're hurting you're not insulated to that nobody sails through this life Problem free no the ible tells us that many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord [Music] these valleys are unpredictable we're going to get to a thought here in a minute are you with me these valleys are unpredictable you can't plan them you can't time them because you know if problems usually catch you off guard have you ever noticed that the valleys of the problems that you go through is usually at the worst time that could happen right yeah yeah you let things be going good and you're selling through life man you everything is just fine paychecks are rolling in kids are doing good a straight A in school job you guys just got a raise yeah but you wait wait there and just wait and see when the bank account's full everything's good that's right but the freezer don't go out when the bank account's full you don't have a flat tile when the bank account's full your kids are not running around acting acting foolish come on church I'm speaking reality to you this morning I'm speaking reality that this is what we have to go through but thank God thank god brother Joe that God has likened his people to something better God has likened Us in the in the Bible as many things he likened us as a branch on a vine as a tree by a river as a light on a hill he's liken us as sheep as salt as racers in a race he he Likens us as wrestlers he Likens us as Warriors have you ever thought about it but the the greatest thing I think is when he Likens us to an eagle I tell you what I love Eagles I love them I love them I love their beauty I love their nature I love their character to me they're the most wonderful animal in God's creation second probably being the line but I love these Eagles and I'm so glad that God chose to liken his people to an eagle he identifies us as Eagles he identifies us as something that Soares above the challenges you see he could have likened us to any kind of bird he wanted to he could have likened us to to a lot of them if he had so desired he had a right to because no doubt we display many of the characters attitudes jealousies indifferences angers hatreds he could have likened us to chickens those that's got chickens just chuckled those that's been around chickens know what I'm talking about he could have likened us to chickens chickens are crowd followers you ever seen chickens you get a bunch ofi chiens and and you get one that's running across the yard and what's the rest of them do they take off after them and they just they just waddle and they're chasing that leader chicken for what reason they have no idea but when one goes they all go yeah they're displaying thems in that way they don't want to miss out nothing that the majority's doing uh oh they don't want to miss out on nothing that the majori doing what are they doing they're chasing the majority and we got to be careful as Christians that we don't fall lack in our spiritualness and lack in our teachings lack in our word and go following after the majority because the majority will lead you to a Slaughter can you imagine if he would have likened us to chickens chickens naturally they squabble and they fight yeah over things in a chicken yard they squabble and they fight you let one of them you throw one of them a little treat he pick it up we we feed ours eggshells to make the shells harder for the next batch and so we throw them eggshells in our man that one he'll pick up that shell and he takes off running and the rest of them just tackle him he don't get a chance to get a single bik cuz he's hunkered over in the corner and he's getting whipped fighting squabbling chasing each other all around the yard over a bug or a grasshopper be careful Christians be careful brother Brown said a lot of that comes from from jealousy yeah he says the Joneses they paint their steps red you want to know how I was going to apply this to the message didn't you he said the Joneses they paint their steps red and you got to have yours red also H he says this is a horrible spirit for a Christian to have chickens they have no interest in the heavenlies no you watch a bunch of chickens and they're just content to live out in that old nasty stinking filthy chicken yard right they love it they can just pack and scratch and and pick up what they want and eat on it eat on it two or three times and they get form in habits they form filthy habits as they pick and they scratch and they they stay out in the chicken yard are you with me come on church and they stay out there in this yard and and they never have their eyes on the sky but their eyes are always on the ground yep looking down at the ground trying to figure out where they're going to go where going to do scratching here picking there most of them will never fly do you know that they got the ability to they've got the they've got what God give them to fly it's called Wings and most of them could take flight if they wanted to but they just live in that chicken yard right behind a fence about this tall you know I put a net over my chicken pan not because I was afraid they'd fly out I was afraid what would fly in and get them they're not going anywhere they're content brother and sisters we're not Earthbound creatures this morning we have been called to raise our sights to look to new heights to new Heavens where heavenbound creatures this morning that's why God couldn't liken us to [Applause] chickens that chicken life could never could never compare to the life of an eagle the chicken can't live like an eagle that chicken can't feed like an eagle that chicken can experience what Eagles experience but living the eagle life that's another story we hear the word Eagle we see in our minds what do you see you see a bird flying high above everything and Majestic bird flying and soaring to places that no other bird can fly and you see that right there and you begin to get that in your atmosphere and you realize that that eagle is the king of the sky that's right amen he's the king of the sky he's the master of his domain and he has a keenness of an eye and he spies out his prey and he swoops down to get his pray and he comes down with tremendous speed and sharp talons and he snatches it up and he takes his meal and he Soares back up to his nest he don't sit down there and feed and eat and filth and manure right too many Christians find themselves feeding in filth and manure you say well I got a good church to go to I'm not talking about where you're feeding here I'm talking about when you feeding outside of the house I'm talking about when you're feeding out in the world when you're when you're dabbling in things that I'm just leave it alone I believe I I believe you know where we're going with that but he doesn't feed in that field he Soares above it I was going to work one day and God's been good to me he knows I love Eagles and and I see them and probably there's a lot of you here maybe never seen one I hope you have but there's a lot of people that never ever see one living in this area I see them all the time and it's usually when I'm in in in prayer or burden or asking or need a confirmation I see an eagle I say thank you Lord I tell you a little secret I got one living right down the road here we seen him the other day didn't we and I told Jo I said that's my Eagle I see him all the time I see him over here I see him over there he just lives about a mile from our house that's my thank God for my Eagle but I was going to Hopkinsville one day and I know where that eagle lives over there and if you if you've ever been to Hopkinsville and get ready to get on the bypass or the the parkway go to Madisonville you'll notice that there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of buzzards they're there all the time and these buzzards just fill the sky and they're circling and they're circling and they're just going around and around and around and I happen to have the thought of eag on my mind that day and I was trying to think about it so I kind of had my eyes sharpened up looking and I thought nothing but a bunch of stinking buzzards and then I looked I thought no way and up higher than the buzzards I said up higher than the buzzards I seen a sharp flash of white and I said it can't be and I looked and saw in hundreds of feet above those buzzards was an eagle with his wings out and I said thank you God as Eagles we fly far above the buzzards the ground don't hold us down and there's something special about eagles for years for centuries hundreds of years Nations recognize Eagles kingdoms recognize Eagles Empires recognize eagles they put them on coins they put them on their seals they put them on their Flags what's the USA the eagle and and just like that God in his word tells us that we're identified with that bird of the air that eagle and that we're identified right there he's calling us spiritual Eagles you know a newborn eaglet is kind of like describing a newborn Christian yep that little Eagle he he he's just he's born peeps his way out of that egg and his eyes and his mouth is wide open it's the first thing he does what's that newborn doing he saying feed me feed me feed me and he's sitting there his parents they're they're just kept so busy because this little bird just keeps his mouth throw back feed me feed me feed me and so they go and hunt and they come down and they feed him and they feed him and what is it with the newborn Christian or Christians in general we constantly have our mouth throw open saying God feed me feed me why because that eaglet has an unsatisfiable desire for food I have an unsatisfiable desire for more of God in my life and God is like those Eagle parents and he tells these eaglets I am the Lord thy God with which brought you out of the land of Egypt open your mouth and I'll f it that's a scripture if you don't know it he told him I'm the one who brought you out of Egypt if you'll open your mouth I will feel it so that Mama and that Daddy Eagle they know what that baby eagle needs to eat they know what it has to have and Jehovah God Eagle knows exactly what you and I have need of this morning he knows exactly what your needs are I'm not talking about a new car I'm not talking about a financial need I'm talking about just when you're downcast when your spirit's broken he knows you need Joy he knows you need happiness and he will sense something by your way if we just look to the sun that's why we have to feed on the word that's why we have to feed on the word on a daily basis eat and eat and eat and eat on the word eat on the spiritual nutrients that's down on the inside and allow us to grow because it's only in the word of God that we find ourselves growing you're not going to grow watching YouTube that's right you're not going to grow watching Tik Tock you're not going to grow going to ball games nothing against it nothing against any of those things in moderation and and if you control it but if I ask you honestly if you're doing those things are you growing no no and feed on that but yet they're just withering up they're withering up because they never eat on the word of God it's dependent on the life on that food from his mouth you know the word Eagle means listen to this it means one feeding with the beak one feeding with the beak so God is feeding his own with the words out of his own mouth as you throw your head back and say God I need food he says here my child here my child here my child and he's constantly feeding and nurturing and getting us to where he wants us to be because you know Eagles can only thrive on Eagle food that's right and nothing else can take the place of that eagle food that eagle food helps Eagles to grow it helps Eagles to mature it helps them to become strong it helps them to push out new feathers to fly but if you don't take a the proper diet if you don't follow the proper diet that eagle you know what happens to them they begin to grow weak they begin to get sickly their feathers begin to fall out their eyesight begins to dim and they begin to get weaker and weaker and weaker until eventually they die and brothers and sisters we don't need spiritual death we need spiritual food we need food in due season food that strengthens us and draws us closer to God I witnessed this firsthand several years back 20 maybe 20 years I don't know we were working brother John and myself and we cut down a tree some of you I think I've told some simar this something of the story in some time or another we cut down a tree and it had three Eagles or three Hawks sorry three Hawks in it babies broke their nest all up and there they laid all bind up in the in the branches of the tree and knowing what I know now I probably should have left them cu the mama she was whistling above us and she no doubt would have come and probably tried to put a new Nest together or she would have done something with them but I thought hey they ain't going to survive we're taking them with us so I brought home one and another guy took home a couple and I brought that Hulk home I tell you what I had him in a cage and I I went down there and I got I started having to feed him by hand and I went I bought all all kinds of hamburger meat sure enough I go down there and and I'd pinch a little bit I had a glove on and I pinch a little bit of that in a ball and stick it in there where it look like a look like a mom mama coming down you know and he sit there he had a head throwback just like that every time he see me come he knew me he knew what was coming and I would taking out Peach and I put man he snatch it out my hand I'd be like do I still have my fingers see that's the way it is a Christian wants it they grab it and that little Hulk he would just snatch it out of my hands and he was doing real good for a while man he grew and and we could let him out in the yard he'd fly around the yard and he would just kind of stay around us knowing I was his mama you know I was mama Hulk and he would stay around and bounce around and and he got doing real good but then all of a sudden he started to look a little poorly he started looking a little poorly and a little weak he didn't sound quite right and I was feeding him feeding him he was eating man he was eating he was eating he was eating and I called the vet and I said you know what this may not be legal even what I'm doing I don't know but this bird is not doing good here's the situation he said he's lacking calcium he's lacking calcium you see I was feeding him all the meat I could feed him he was he was he was in the Bible he was reading he was eating he was taking it in but I didn't give him any bones to go with it he didn't have any calcium he wasn't getting enough of the message to go along with the word he was eating it up eating it up eating it up but he just kind of pushed the message out to the side I wasn't feeding him no message brothers and sisters we got to have both we got to have the word of God and the message of the hour and the two come together and it gives you a complete nutritious diet without that calcium that burn he was so defent I couldn't never get it back up and he ended up just kind of withering away and and he died and and and that's the way we are if we don't take in all of God's word and feast on E on Eagle food you're going to D wither away you're going to find yourself going away is this all right this morning sometimes we as eaglets we don't practice a serious eating of the word of God we become picky with our food uhoh it's going to hit a nerve isn't it we become picky with our food we begin to put together our own menu yeah yeah we we begin to put put our own menu together and and we begin to compile a comprise composition of our own favorite verses our own favorite quotes we put together these quotes that contain positive confessions and and positive affirmations and and we put together these these promises and these quotes that are that that we can do no wrong and and but what happens when we void out the verses that confronts us condemns us and chastens us and CH and challenges us we need Scripture to challenge our filthy Lifestyles we need the word of God in its fullness and in its entirety or El we never mature as Christians we will never mature so you know we we there's people that get this get these favorite quotes and and they got it in their mind that oh my goodness God is so good God Is My Savior God's my John 3:16 but that's where they stop God sent a prophet there's a bride in this hour oh that's all that's good that's wonderful well I believe it I love it with all my heart but if I don't take what that Prophet said in its entirety if I don't take entirely what it said what he said and it take entirely what the word says I'm never going to be a part of that bride and we find those people are diaper Christians thank you brother Steve they uh they they they're not weaned from the milk they're still feeding on milky word they're not been weaned yet sometime 40 years old 50 607 it don't matter what your age is if you're not feeding on the word in its entirety and you're just living by a handful of scriptures and sermons and quotes a diaper baby and don't give me oh I love babies they're beautiful you know Austin Serenity they just brought us a new baby into this world and man that thing is just as cute as a button that's right but you know that baby won't always be a baby that baby is not always going to drink milk that baby has to come to a point that it begins to wean itself off of that milk and it has to begin to get nutrients from outside sources sources that give it calcium sources that give it pottassium sources that give it sodium and on and on and on are you with me it has to continue to get this sources from different things because why she's going to get teeth and she's going to eat and she's going to grow and then you're going to watch her start to crawl around and we enjoy those times and and it's nothing nothing as cute as a little baby and watching it grow but wouldn't it be a tragedy if that baby just come to a certain spot in his life and just stopped think about it put the two types together what if you watch that baby grow for six months 18 months 24 months three years old and all of a sudden that's as big as that baby gets you'd call a doctor wouldn't you why is it when people do it spiritually nobody seems to step in why is it when people do that spiritually it's not a concern anymore it's oh well they'll come back if God if they're one of Gods what are you doing what are we doing as Christians when we see people living in that Valley that they can't get out of they're stuck in a position and they're not growing that's right come on church God don't want his children to remain babies you got that newborn eaglet what a life it's been born into you got your parent eagles they built their nest up in the up in the mountains up high they built their nest up high and it's and it's uh it it it's full of comfort it's full of security they're snuggled within the the parents protecting Wings they set up there and Rabbit's fur in every move the young ones are watched by their parents that's right every need is supplied and the life in this Nest is wonderful he opens his mouth he eats he opens his mouth he eats he has nothing to worry about it's cozy it's comfort it's soft it's delightful you know some people want that kind of preaching they want the kind of preaching that just oh well brother God is good God is gracious you're not going to get that around the message if you are you're not going to get that around a real Holy Ghost filled Church why because God is more than just that if you want that you need to move to Texas and find you a pastor named Olin because he's a God is good all the time God's going to bless you God loves you God never does nothing to his children he he's just like a big granddaddy that's not what the prophet said and they find themselves they want that kind of preaching and they want to live that life with that little eaglet and and comfort but that's not the way God intended it brothers and sisters Eagles Are Born to Fly they sometime or another have to get out of that Nest how would you feel if your kids stay that you woke up one morning and your your children still living in the house and they're 45 years old at some point you have to get out of the nest at some point these Eagles have to get out of the nest and it's not because it's not because they want to but because it's an inheritance for them it's built inside of them there's something that God does on the inside of these little Eagles that says I can't lay here no more and their mama begins to talk to them she begins to talk to them and she begins to tell them hey we're fixing to get out of here scoot over let me pull some of this cushion out of here let me pull some of this God is good all the time out of here let me pull of this you'll never have problems out of here let me tell you you're fixing to find out where the rubber meets the road little iglet and she SS to him she tells them get on my wings and she begins to hover and she pushes and pushes air and and the prophet in the story goes that she pushes air and she knocks all the old feathers out of these little eaglets the feathers that'll do them no good and he begins to build up Faith and this Eagle is an inheritance in that eagle and it's our inherited as Believers in this message and God demands us to get out of the nest and fly to set our wings not on things of this world not on things around us but on things of a higher place of a higher calling listen to this real quick Prophet said God has set in the church gifts first the Bible he said 'I strictly a fundamentalist if anything doesn't come from the Bible it isn't true he said I believe that this is God's truth and everything every Doctrine must be based upon this new testament the New Testament Church now he said we see in the Bible that Jesus Christ the son of God when he came to the Earth he came to rid sin and sickness to divorce it to put it away forever from his people think about that and he said and he claimed that he would return again but in his absence that he gave his church the same Authority that he had brothers and sisters it's not up for us just to sit in the nest and hear the word and listen to the word and go to church and take our kids to camps it's up to us to get out of the nest to find ourselves with the same Authority that God Almighty has and do the works of a New Testament Church just like Paul just like Peter think about it think about those guys when they went into the streets and the people were healed upin the very Shadows that wasn't Jesus's Shadow it was a man of God it was a new testament Church believer brother Brown tells the story and you you're very familiar with it we're going to have to try to hurry now but he tells a story about that farmer who was walking one day and found that eagle egg everybody's heard this right if you hadn't hope you enjoy but that farmer walked down there and he found that Eagle's egg and he took that Eagle's egg and he placed it in the hen house under a settin hen and she had in there several eggs up under her at that time and and and all these eggs they just kind of sat there and they look the same but all of a sudden all the eggs began to hatch as the as these birds started to come forth the hen sitting there and she looks at it and she thinks man what is that and her way of thinking this is the oddest looking chicken I've ever seen you see we're odd boss you can try to scratch in the Barnard all you want but if this message is yours you're the oddest looking chicken the world's ever seen said this and and it's the oddest voice that that mother H had ever heard when she sit there she listen to her chicken [Applause] shirt you heard little chicks do that right right and here comes this odd looking [Music] one she's thinking my goodness what rooster got in this hand house what kind of bird is this this is something I've never seen before and this little bird this little this little eaglet sits down there and he's odd and all the others picked at him poked at him picked at him here was an eagle trying to live a life of a chicken could you be content in a Baptist Church I didn't say you couldn't go I said could you be content I've been there you can't be content you can eat a little you can Fellowship a little but it's not the same the word does not do the same I'm not picking on just them I'm just picking on it I'm not picking on anybody don't don't take me that way but I'm just making an example with the message of the hour there's a there's there's there something different amen the word is brought to a life in a different kind of way that's why you're a to them you live different you walk different you look different you dress different you go different places you can't go where they go and be comfortable they can't do what you do and be comfortable you can't make an eagle a chicken and you can't make a chicken an eagle you can try all you want to reform to change but if it's not in there from the very foundation of the world it ain't for and this little chicken is out in the barnyard until one day a huge Shadow passes over the top of it and this huge Shadow passes over him and he looks up and he sees this eagle flying up in the sky and this big father Eagle come down and look at him and say say you're little eaglet you're one of my kind why are you down here pecking around in the filth and the manure in this chicken yard what do I do Daddy what do I do he said Son set your wings he said set your wings and jump because heaven is your domain set your wings and head yourself Yonder to the skies get out of this Barnard brothers and sisters I'm thankful that in this hour we've been given a chance that somebody called out and said listen you're not chickens anymore you never was a chicken you may have fed with the chickens you may have run with the chickens but the heaven is your home set your wings and fly and then he says he screeched and he made him jump and he jumped he says you can fly if you'll try see a lot of times we don't try we don't even try we just kind of days of Miracles God still heals yeah and then we just right back on the fence [Music] post [Applause] that little eaglet he did what his father asked him to do and that father Eagle did what he said he would do he said if you'll take that Mighty jump of Faith you can land on my wings and I'll take you to places you've never seen you'll SAR to Heights that you've never experienced you'll live a life that you've never walked in before [Applause] there'll be no more doubt there'll be no more fear are you with me brother and sisters God as God called eaglet Christians we can't be content living the chicken life we can't be content living around in the barnyard because a barnyard believer is any attitude or mindset or lifestyle that restricts us from accomplishing all that God has purposed for us to be or do in [Music] [Applause] life that mother Eagle she trains her young to fly she watches these Eagles these eaglets until they're in the nest until they're fully feathered and when she thinks they're mature she begins to stir the nest listen to the message as the eagle stirreth her nest and she begins to stir her nest and with her beak she begins to tear out everything out of the nest and she gets rid of all the Cozy she removes all the padding she gets everything so uncomfortable and then in the process of helping them develop her wings she hovers over and begins to Flap and they watch her you see why it's so important that we're good examples you don't ever want to be a stumbling block to somebody but you want to be a steeping Stone you want to be somebody young people young teenagers be somebody that little ones look up to and say man I wish I could live like he lives now you may not be perfect nobody's going to ask you to be perfect but you're living a dedicated Christian Life and then Little Eagles they look at that mama bird and she's showing them exactly what to do live like this live like this live like this and she's sitting there she's flapping her wings and she showing them just what they're supposed to do and all of a sudden they begin to act like a belie they begin to talk like a Believer they begin to dress like a Believer they begin to go places like Believers go what is it they're watching they're learning they're strengthening their wings sometimes God has to stir our nest because we find ourselves as some of the most rooted Christians sometimes getting comfortable and getting complacent and we find ourselves not living exactly the way we should we We Begin to retract back from where we was two days ago instead of going forward we begin to step back and we have to be careful as Christians that we don't do that and God he begins to to get with his little eaglets and he stirs our nest and he says brothers and sisters we are meant to fly father eagle above us begins to call the truth is found in the mother Eagle spreading her wings and commanding her Eagles to step out in faith how many times has God ever called to you and it's a step of Faith it's a leap of faith God should I do this it's a leap of faith God should I should I do this should I witness this should I go here should I should I help this and you stepping out and you're leaping out in faith what are you doing you're stepping out on the wings of God the prophet said the wings are like the the old and the New Testament one Wings the Old Testament one's the New Testament and you're stepping out there in faith Deuteronomy 3 2 and 11 says Like an Eagle stirs her nest and hovers over young that spreads her wings to catch them and carries them to new heights listen what the prophet said I'm I'm closing now I'm not going to keep you long today he says what we need today is a nest stirring time what we need today is the power of the Holy Ghost he said what we need today is Eagle food preaching that Jesus Christ still heals he's the same The Works that I do shall you do also just like that father mother eagle flies let to know tonight that Jehovah has his big wings across here waving his Spirit back and forth and the angel of the Lord having his picture taken the same Pillar of Fire that was in the wilderness in the New Testament now in the last days yesterday today and forever and people being healed filled with the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues interpretations power of God's coming the Lord drawing nigh God getting his church together aren't you glad to be such a thing as that that's the life of the eagle he said it's called The Eagle age he said it's called God's prophets are eagles the eagle age we realize over the Bible we find Malachi 4 that we promised that in the last days he Likens His prophets to Eagles he calls himself an eagle he is the great Jehovah Eagle that's right listen now and he is able to achieve to himself a bride thank you let's stand to our feet he is able to achieve to him s able to get a bride watch now with a Ministry that is so exactly like his like a man and his wife become one he said and when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one brothers and sisters there a lot lot of thoughts we could pick from this and we could go different directions with eagles we could go different directions with the valley but God didn't call us to live in a valley God didn't call us to live in a chicken yard so if you're
