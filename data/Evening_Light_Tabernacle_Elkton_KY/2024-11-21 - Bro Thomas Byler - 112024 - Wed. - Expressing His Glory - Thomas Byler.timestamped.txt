[59:31] we want to dwell on with the help of the
[59:34] Lord tonight talk calling it Expressions
[59:38] expressions of his glory amen
[59:41] Revelations
[59:47] 4 Revelations 4 and verse 7 and the
[59:51] first Beast was like a lion and the
[59:55] second Beast the face of a man and the

[1:00:00] your message believer we all are well
[1:00:03] acquainted of what that is isn't that
[1:00:05] right those are the four powers the four
[1:00:08] powers amen that God used since the time

[1:00:35] eagle age you and I are anointed under
[1:00:39] that eagle age I mean it's glad for
[1:00:43] that amen we could just stop right there
[1:00:45] and preach the rest of the night amen
[1:00:48] being able to see further than any other
[1:00:51] bird any other bird can see can see M
[1:00:55] when we think about it I think brother
[1:00:56] Brad talked about how you can see three
[1:00:57] miles maybe and see a rabbit or
[1:01:00] something you know way out there you
[1:01:02] know and you and I amen we've got Eagle
[1:01:05] Vision we can see Plum Plum back before
[1:01:08] world was ever
[1:01:09] created I'm here to tell you one thing
[1:01:12] right now the Amish never taught me that
[1:01:13] God wasn't God one
[1:01:17] time you just didn't learn that from the
[1:01:20] Amish that God wasn't even God one time
[1:01:22] you know he was all by himself you know
[1:01:25] that God means an object of worship and
[1:01:27] there was nothing
[1:01:28] to and so if there's nothing worshiping
[1:01:30] him he's not God so am mean he has to
[1:01:33] make something to worship him and make
[1:01:34] him a God Amen and so amen all the way
[1:01:38] there ain't that right and not only
[1:01:40] there but helps us to see all the way
[1:01:42] into the
[1:01:43] future way to the Millennium the new
[1:01:46] heavens and the new Earth the new city
[1:01:48] coming down amen it's all the way up
[1:01:53] there flying eagle age how many is's
[1:01:56] glad to be living in amen flying eagle
[1:01:59] all right well does not Chase too many
[1:02:01] rabbits amen and the four beasts had
[1:02:04] each of them six wings about them and
[1:02:07] they were full of eyes within and the
[1:02:10] they rest not they
[1:02:12] nor saying holy holy holy Lord God
[1:02:16] Almighty which was which is and which is
[1:02:19] to come and when those beasts give glory
[1:02:23] and honor and thanks to him that sat
[1:02:24] upon the throne who liveth forever and
[1:02:27] ever amen now let's stop there for a
[1:02:30] minute let me talk to us a little more
[1:02:31] now what we're going to do tonight what
[1:02:33] we're doing like what I really like
[1:02:35] about this thought in the area that
[1:02:37] we've been dwelling in is the
[1:02:40] reaction of all four of those
[1:02:43] Powers the reaction of all of the
[1:02:47] Christians and what they're going to say
[1:02:50] they get over
[1:02:51] there ain't that right what they're
[1:02:53] going to express when they find over
[1:02:56] there when we finally get over there
[1:02:58] amen this is what's going to happen it
[1:03:00] must be a very important thing and to me
[1:03:03] that's why every word that is spoken
[1:03:05] here is very important amen very
[1:03:09] important why don't my glasses want to
[1:03:12] work right all right four and 20 Elders
[1:03:15] fall down before him that sat upon the
[1:03:17] thr that liveth forever and
[1:03:22] ever and cast their crowns Before the
[1:03:25] Throne
[1:03:26] saying Thou Art Worthy
[1:03:32] amen that th Art Worthy Thou Art
[1:03:38] Worthy thou worthy
[1:03:41] oh it just fits on the mouth it it just
[1:03:44] fits right good to be able to say Thou
[1:03:46] Art Worthy Lord am mean because you was
[1:03:49] made to say that not only over there but
[1:03:51] in this life John Michael God bless you
[1:03:53] good to see you amen receive glory and
[1:03:57] honor and power for thou Hast created
[1:04:00] all things and for thy pleasure they are
[1:04:04] and were
[1:04:06] created thank you Jesus amen may God add
[1:04:10] His blessings to the reading of the
[1:04:11] words you can be
[1:04:18] seated brother Brandon and preaching the
[1:04:20] seals preached the fifth chapter of
[1:04:22] Revelations we're going to go into this
[1:04:23] just a little bit because we're going to
[1:04:25] take our time we got all winner to go
[1:04:27] through this series all right but in the
[1:04:29] fifth chapter brother Brandon used the
[1:04:31] fifth talking about there was an angel
[1:04:33] amen proclaiming with a V loud voice
[1:04:36] who's worthy to open the book loose the
[1:04:37] seals and all of that and then at the
[1:04:39] end of that whole thing we're not going
[1:04:41] to get and preach that maybe sometime
[1:04:43] but we'll go to jump down to verse 12
[1:04:45] because brother bam talked about how
[1:04:47] that John the Revelator must have seen
[1:04:49] his name on the book is that right and
[1:04:52] when he saw his name on the book he
[1:04:54] began to Rejoice he began to praise God
[1:04:56] and amen and and and I don't care what
[1:04:59] you think but brother bam said that
[1:05:01] everything under the Earth and on the
[1:05:03] earth anywhere else heard him saying it
[1:05:06] they heard John screaming and holler and
[1:05:08] having him a good Jubilee fit a't that
[1:05:10] right so this scriptures applies of
[1:05:12] course brother Braham said it's being a
[1:05:14] type of the
[1:05:15] church right John was now in verse uh
[1:05:19] you know uh there was 10,000s times
[1:05:21] 10,000s saying with a loud Worthy is the
[1:05:24] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:05:27] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:05:30] and glory and blessing amen every
[1:05:33] creature which was in heaven and on
[1:05:35] Earth and under the Earth such as are in
[1:05:37] the sea all that are in them heard I
[1:05:39] saying blessing and honor and H Power
[1:05:44] Glory unto him that Seth on the throne
[1:05:46] and to the lamb
[1:05:48] forever and all the beasts
[1:05:52] said
[1:05:53] amen a
[1:05:56] amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down
[1:05:59] and worshiped him that liveth forever
[1:06:00] and ever amen worshiped him 4 and 12
[1:06:04] El 4 and 20 Elders Amen brother abandon
[1:06:07] myi I believe he described that as
[1:06:11] Patriarchs and the 12
[1:06:13] disciples amen 12 disciples and the 12
[1:06:17] Patriarchs of the Old Testament amen all
[1:06:21] right so now we look there and we find
[1:06:23] once again that The
[1:06:26] Cry Of The People The Cry of the
[1:06:31] people is to give God glory
[1:06:37] right
[1:06:40] now in chapter 4: 11 he says Thou Art
[1:06:46] Worthy oh Lord to receive
[1:06:49] glory and honor and
[1:06:53] power amen GL and honor and Power in
[1:06:58] verse 125 says Thou Art Worthy that was
[1:07:01] that
[1:07:02] was Worthy is the Lamb to receive uh
[1:07:06] that was slain to receive power and
[1:07:09] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:07:13] and glory and blessing said it a little
[1:07:16] bit and we may get into that hopefully
[1:07:18] we'll get into that the power part the
[1:07:21] riches part the wisdom part the strength
[1:07:24] all of those things things but we want
[1:07:26] to start with the help of the Lord amen
[1:07:28] and we want to go to 1 Chronicles let's
[1:07:31] go jump back to 1

[1:07:50] scriptures that almost almost copied

[1:07:54] of them I think this will be I think
[1:07:57] that was in Isaiah somewhere but this
[1:07:59] will be sufficient to make our Point 1st
[1:08:01] chronicles 16 and verse 24 says

[1:11:13] love when people do outstanding things
[1:11:17] we love to be able to say wow did you
[1:11:20] that when God is really the one WTH
[1:11:25] things and we'll talk about that we
[1:11:27] could go till 5:00 tomorrow morning 6:00
[1:11:31] amen we could go till the sunrises
[1:11:33] tomorrow morning just talking about The
[1:11:36] Wonder of things that God has
[1:11:41] done and how many knows faith comes by
[1:11:45] hearing amen I was talking to a couple
[1:11:48] couple of I don't I don't know if
[1:11:49] they're Christians or not but they came
[1:11:50] with Colton and they came up visited
[1:11:52] with us today and before leaving and we
[1:11:54] got on the subject of God and I says you
[1:11:55] know it's even hard to believe there is
[1:11:57] a
[1:12:00] God what that's right I says can you
[1:12:03] comprehend a god a being that never had
[1:12:06] a start at one time there was nothing
[1:12:08] and he never did have a beginning try to
[1:12:11] comprehend that with you Lama they
[1:12:14] like it's easier to believe that we come
[1:12:16] from a tadpole than to believe that
[1:12:17] there's such a being but you got faith
[1:12:20] and you can't know by the things that
[1:12:22] are created I says but we know that he
[1:12:24] is because the son just don't make a
[1:12:26] revolution every every day unless
[1:12:28] there's a Supreme Being making it turn
[1:12:32] around all the stars and all the moon
[1:12:34] and everything that happens then I said
[1:12:36] the prophet of God God worked through
[1:12:38] him you know to raise debt and do great
[1:12:40] Miracles and signs and wonders discern
[1:12:42] the thoughts of the hearts just like he
[1:12:43] did with the woman well I got the
[1:12:44] witnessing to anyway I about got
[1:12:46] preaching but
[1:12:48] anyway he's a God of
[1:12:53] Wonders that's great thing he does
[1:12:55] wonderous things and it's all an
[1:12:59] expression of his glory because when we
[1:13:01] think about the glory of God most of the
[1:13:03] time we think he comes in the Splendor
[1:13:05] of his glory amen we've got an ivory an
[1:13:08] ivory Throne up there with angels all
[1:13:10] around a bright light coming all the
[1:13:12] hosts of heaven and everything and
[1:13:13] that's his glory but let's look at his
[1:13:16] glory in a little different view this
[1:13:17] morning this evening we that be all
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:23] different amen all
[1:13:26] right that's right blessed this he doeth
[1:13:31] wonderous things and blessed be his
[1:13:35] glorious name I like to talk about oh
[1:13:40] glorious I like to talk about something
[1:13:42] that's
[1:13:43] glorious amen blessed be his glorious
[1:13:47] name forever and let the whole earth be
[1:13:50] filled with his glory amen and
[1:13:53] amen place it talks about even the
[1:13:56] heavens declare his glory the Earth is
[1:13:59] full of his glory everywhere you look
[1:14:04] the glory of almighty god brother bam
[1:14:06] was so inspired by this that he preached
[1:14:08] on Amen a talked about the revolution of
[1:14:11] the Sun and how it goes around the moon
[1:14:14] and he be talk about creation and the
[1:14:16] miraculous things that it's a paradox
[1:14:18] how this can be how the trees can know
[1:14:20] how to go down and not die every year
[1:14:23] it's a paradox if you just look around
[1:14:25] you'll see God everywhere if you got a
[1:14:28] lot of him on the inside I'll tell you
[1:14:30] what you'll see him everywhere every oh
[1:14:32] my the very that we're standing on Amen
[1:14:35] it was a paradox amen this body that he
[1:14:38] made it's a paradox am mean it's part of
[1:14:40] the expression of almighty
[1:14:43] God it's part of his wonders his
[1:14:50] glory
[1:14:52] amen there's a lot of Glory seekers in
[1:14:55] the world is that right lot of Glory
[1:14:58] seekers in the world that's why
[1:15:01] we yeah that's why we allow them Bulls
[1:15:04] to jump all over the top of with their
[1:15:06] hoofs and man they could just hit your
[1:15:07] neck anytime break it and die amen
[1:15:09] people will go W next to death and and
[1:15:12] just play around with death image just

[1:16:36] God
[1:16:38] oh that's right think about it is full
[1:16:43] of his
[1:16:46] glory
[1:16:49] amen I think it's in
[1:16:53] Romans in Romans it talks about people
[1:16:56] came be in their
[1:16:59] imaginations because when they knew God
[1:17:01] they didn't worship as God isn't that
[1:17:03] right came vain in their imaginations
[1:17:05] and their foolish heart was darkened God
[1:17:08] gave them over to vile affections and
[1:17:10] everything else and he talks about he
[1:17:12] talks about you know and they worship
[1:17:14] the creation more than the C
[1:17:17] Creator amen one place bible talks about
[1:17:20] you know the thing that is
[1:17:21] made amen the things are made to maybe
[1:17:25] there's a beautiful house that somebody
[1:17:26] makes somebody makes
[1:17:28] a oh that's a beautiful house amen but
[1:17:31] what about the guy that built
[1:17:34] it but the house is oh it's awesome but
[1:17:37] the Bible says the one that made it
[1:17:39] ought to get more credit than what is
[1:17:41] made and that's the way it is with God
[1:17:44] Amen people want to have fun with this
[1:17:46] and that and the other and they give you
[1:17:47] more credit than they mount the one that
[1:17:49] made it
[1:17:55] amen it's
[1:17:56] time to give
[1:17:59] God the glory that's du to his
[1:18:05] name oh I will give him glory I will
[1:18:08] give him praise I will Shine the Light
[1:18:10] deep into the night I will give him
[1:18:13] glory I will give him my strength I will
[1:18:15] give him
[1:18:19] honor amen God inhabits the praise of
[1:18:22] his
[1:18:23] people right there says a son honor the
[1:18:25] far
[1:18:26] father a servant honth the the but he
[1:18:31] says where's my
[1:18:32] honor
[1:18:34] amen
[1:18:37] amen all
[1:18:39] right the whole earth is full of his
[1:18:44] glory we ought to stand in awe want to
[1:18:48] look how we ought to when God begin to
[1:18:51] begin to express who he really is
[1:18:55] because this is about who God is is that
[1:19:00] right and as you get to know a person
[1:19:03] and the way they act and the way they do
[1:19:05] you find out whether they're a good
[1:19:07] person
[1:19:08] huh that person's really
[1:19:11] nice really kind really loving really
[1:19:15] helpful that is their Glory that's the
[1:19:18] beauty of them but if it's ugly hello
[1:19:22] then it's terrible it's good thing
[1:19:25] but as we get to know God we know how
[1:19:28] good he really is how great he really is
[1:19:31] how much of his glory that's expressed
[1:19:33] to
[1:19:35] us amen praise the Lord when we look at
[1:19:39] him we realize how great is our God how
[1:19:43] many knows we God incomprehensible to
[1:19:47] the human mind so don't try just believe
[1:19:50] him just believe him serve him with
[1:19:52] everything you got
[1:19:57] amen later on perhaps if we get to it
[1:19:59] and that Hebrews 1 talks about that he
[1:20:02] was the expressed image of his glory
[1:20:06] expressed image of his G person I
[1:20:08] believe it
[1:20:12] was all
[1:20:13] right praise the
[1:20:16] Lord so God does wonders does his
[1:20:20] wonders amen he proves himself by doing
[1:20:23] glorious works
[1:20:27] amen I'm going
[1:20:30] to take read this scripture to kind of
[1:20:33] pick something up in John 2 verse 11
[1:20:37] after he turned the water into wine this
[1:20:40] beginning of miracles did Jesus in canaa
[1:20:44] Galilee and manifested forth his
[1:20:50] glory amen begin to manifest forth his
[1:20:54] glory and his disciples believed him so
[1:20:58] has he begin to do
[1:21:00] Miracles that right he's the god of
[1:21:06] Mir why do we think we still say well we
[1:21:10] worship to God that created everything
[1:21:13] because we realize that God made
[1:21:15] something out of nothing he just spoke
[1:21:17] the word and there it was woo
[1:21:21] Glory aome he ain't got to do no flip
[1:21:24] for me all he got to do what he did a me

[1:21:47] years and still not burn out what in the
[1:21:51] world did he make the Sun out of
[1:21:56] woo I can't help but believe it's some
[1:21:58] of that same fire amen that he took the
[1:22:01] darkness out of my heart with that he
[1:22:03] took Darkness out of he took us out of
[1:22:05] darkness and translated us into His

[1:22:44] bit and what God
[1:22:47] did he talks about even when he spoke
[1:22:50] from that mountain his glory was there
[1:22:54] is that right he spoke to Moses his veil
[1:22:58] was had to be his face had to be veiled
[1:23:01] and Paul talked about the glory that it
[1:23:03] was what a glory it was amen the
[1:23:05] bringing of the law he says how much
[1:23:08] more the New Testament exceeds in glory
[1:23:11] and that see it's so much in glory amen

[1:24:49] all of them they've been gifted to sing
[1:24:53] and people worship them
[1:24:55] make an idol out of them even Elvis like
[1:24:59] brother brah said God gave him that gift
[1:25:01] to have that gift they should use it for
[1:25:04] God to bring honor and glory to
[1:25:08] him but they use it for their selfish
[1:25:11] reasons and for Devil's reason and
[1:25:13] people make an idol out of them amen who
[1:25:16] was it that gave them a voice in the
[1:25:18] first place it was

[1:41:10] all of his Splendor in all of his glory
[1:41:13] with all the hosts of heaven and that'll

[1:42:12] stuff why you save the good stuff for
[1:42:14] lastes usually you give them the bad

[1:43:30] spirit walking on the water it's I he
[1:43:33] said if that be you let me the glory for
[1:43:37] him to be able to walk on

[1:45:40] bad because God fills the Earth with his
[1:45:43] glory shines his glory upon the people
[1:45:46] and they still don't
[1:45:50] believe it was glorious
[1:45:53] Calvary was
[1:45:56] glorious with the spit hanging on his
[1:45:59] face it was glorious the stripes on his
[1:46:02] back was glorious

[1:46:43] have to pay for your
[1:46:45] sin it was glorious the most
[1:46:49] glorious was through Jesus Christ in
[1:46:52] Calvary
[1:46:54] the pope calls it a complete
[1:46:57] failure hey Pope you call it a complete
[1:47:01] failure you're going to stand before him
[1:47:03] one of these
[1:47:06] days and you'll be thrown in the Lake of
[1:47:10] Fire amen that's right
[1:47:14] blasphemy
[1:47:16] blasphemy is what this preacher says it
[1:47:18] is when it was complete success not
[1:47:22] failure there was no failure in any part
[1:47:25] of the
[1:47:25] Cross why why not how do you know about
[1:47:29] about I'll tell you Mr Pope and all of
[1:47:31] your millions of Catholic followers I'll
[1:47:34] tell you why it was a success because he
[1:47:37] died and he went to hell and he took the
[1:47:40] keys from the devil death and hell and
[1:47:42] he rose like he said he was done and
[1:47:45] he's alive forever more and he proved
[1:47:48] that he was
[1:47:50] alive that was Glory
[1:47:55] glorious
[1:47:57] Resurrection he ascended on high and
[1:48:00] pour out into you and I the baptism of

[1:48:16] glorious the most glorious thing that
[1:48:19] was ever done amen
[1:48:28] glorious the
[1:48:30] resurrection then they've got the
[1:48:32] audacity to say it was a
[1:48:34] failure it would have been a
[1:48:37] failure you're right Mr Pope it would
[1:48:40] have been a if he wouldn't
[1:48:43] arose cuz he said he was
[1:48:46] gonna failure but he rose now you're oh
[1:48:50] so wrong
[1:48:53] so

[1:54:32] the fullness of time God is going to
[1:54:33] call all his children home I believe
[1:54:36] that's what he interpreted that
[1:54:38] scripture as being in whom also we have
[1:54:41] obtained an inheritance being
[1:54:43] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:54:45] of him who worketh all things after the
