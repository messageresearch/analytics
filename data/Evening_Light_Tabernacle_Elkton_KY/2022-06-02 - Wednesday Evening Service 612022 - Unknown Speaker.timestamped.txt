[7:56] amen
[8:03] amen turn your bibles if you will to the
[8:05] book of
[8:07] let's go to
[8:10] galatians
[8:13] the book of galatians
[8:27] chapter 2
[8:35] and verse 20.
[8:40] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[8:43] i live yet not i
[8:45] but christ liveth in me the life
[8:48] and the life which i now live in the
[8:50] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[8:52] god
[8:53] who loved me and gave himself
[8:56] for me
[8:57] i'm thinking it's corinthians
[9:01] over in
[9:04] first corinthians
[9:07] 1
[9:17] and verse 16 for i'm not ashamed of the
[9:19] gospel of christ
[9:21] for it is the power of god unto
[9:23] salvation
[9:24] to every one that believeth to the jew
[9:27] first and also to the greek
[9:29] for therein is the righteousness of god
[9:31] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[9:33] written
[9:34] the just shall live by faith
[9:36] blessings to the reading of the words
[9:37] you can be seated tonight
[9:40] amen i want to speak this evening
[9:43] on reliance on reliance
[9:46] amen
[9:49] praise the lord
[9:51] amen we uh think of what the world says
[9:54] or what people
[9:56] says about christians sometimes of how
[9:58] that
[10:01] you know
[10:02] they might say of course they say a lot
[10:04] of things but one of the main things a
[10:05] lot of things they'll say sometimes is
[10:07] that you know it's the weak people that
[10:09] need god
[10:10] amen
[10:12] the weak people need god
[10:15] you know and uh
[10:18] so or people might say that you know
[10:21] weak people need god as a crutch
[10:25] as a crutch to help them out in their
[10:27] weakness and so forth
[10:28] well i
[10:30] happen to think that he's an awesome
[10:31] crutch
[10:33] david thought so when the giant needed
[10:35] to come down right
[10:37] amen and so shamgar he thought that god
[10:41] was pretty good and then he needed him
[10:44] we're living in a world and there's a
[10:45] lot of people that get the attitude and
[10:46] the idea that
[10:48] they don't need no help from nobody and
[10:51] you know
[10:52] uh
[10:53] and just go make it on their own
[10:57] right
[10:58] just go make it on their own
[11:01] and so
[11:02] we uh
[11:03] know that god has to bring us to a place
[11:08] to where
[11:09] he's needed amen
[11:11] how many reasons god is
[11:12] needed amen we need god we're needy
[11:16] people
[11:18] amen you're going to face a lot of
[11:19] things that you're going to find that
[11:21] you know you can't that you can't take
[11:23] care of you can't whoop
[11:27] we know that the layout see at church
[11:28] age they didn't think they needed
[11:31] god they have needed nothing
[11:34] amen
[11:35] and so
[11:36] when we talk about faith here
[11:40] we see that this faith is used for a
[11:42] purpose right it you know we know one
[11:44] place it says that without faith it is
[11:46] impossible to please god
[11:49] the very thing that people say they were
[11:51] weak about and so forth is the very
[11:53] thing that paul said that he lived by
[11:57] amen
[12:00] i like that you know and i'm just you
[12:02] know i i believe that
[12:04] uh
[12:06] we are we're going to learn learn more
[12:08] and more by the grace of god that we
[12:10] need him more and and that we have to
[12:12] rely on him more amen
[12:16] i mean we rely on god we rely on faith
[12:20] isn't that right
[12:21] faith is something that we rely on
[12:24] we believe when we can't hardly
[12:27] see how it could possibly be yet we
[12:29] believe anyway we we need faith
[12:32] we can't live without that faith
[12:36] and just to recap a little bit if that's
[12:38] okay
[12:39] we all know and i've been taught i've
[12:40] taught many times here that you live
[12:43] in and you live in two worlds
[12:46] or one or the other world should i say
[12:48] there's only two worlds that you can
[12:50] actually live in now i'm talking about a
[12:53] everyday
[12:54] living
[12:56] basis
[12:58] one of them of course is faith the other
[13:00] one is unbelief or doubt
[13:02] amen you're going to live by one or the
[13:05] other in every action in everything that
[13:08] you do
[13:11] and i do mean everything
[13:16] every decision that we make
[13:18] amen
[13:21] all right
[13:23] people don't like it but god is
[13:24] basically he
[13:26] gave us two roads he says here's a
[13:28] crossroad this one leads to hell
[13:31] this one leads to heaven
[13:33] which one do you want to take
[13:35] because i heard brother branham saying
[13:36] this week he says god don't send you to
[13:38] hell
[13:39] use yourself to hell
[13:41] because he made a way for you not to go
[13:43] if you chose to go down that road it's
[13:46] on you
[13:47] you chose to go down that way
[13:50] people just don't like that they don't
[13:52] have more of an option that's the only
[13:54] option to have one or the other
[13:57] and so is it in our lives our daily life
[13:59] we either live by faith or we live by
[14:02] doubt or unbelief
[14:03] that's where a lot of our frustrations
[14:05] our anger or or every all those type of
[14:08] things come in
[14:09] people people rely on something in their
[14:12] life now if people don't think they rely
[14:14] on stuff but what about all the drugs
[14:16] that they use and all the
[14:17] all of the stuff that they fall back to
[14:19] that and i was thinking about that this
[14:21] week how that we all fall back
[14:24] to something we fall we lean on
[14:26] something
[14:27] amen
[14:29] and paul here he's saying that the life
[14:31] that he's crucified with christ
[14:35] amen
[14:38] yet he said yet i live
[14:42] but what i do is i live the life that i
[14:44] now live i live by the faith of the son
[14:48] of god that's what he lived by
[14:52] amen
[14:54] and paul had a lot of obstacles in his
[14:57] life and he needed god in every one of
[14:59] those obstacles
[15:00] he really did amen
[15:04] how many realizes that you know and god
[15:06] is the object of worship we know that
[15:09] god wasn't god at one time but you know
[15:11] he had to make something to worship him
[15:14] amen when god created you and me he
[15:17] created us with a need he let us come
[15:20] into this world with a need
[15:24] excuse me but can i just go with my mind
[15:26] for a minute
[15:28] okay
[15:29] we have a need because he allowed the
[15:31] fall to come
[15:33] now the way i understand it if i'm not
[15:36] not incorrect
[15:38] that adam was supposed to speak
[15:41] his
[15:42] sons and his daughters into existence it
[15:44] wasn't supposed to be by a woman
[15:46] travailing and being in pain the way
[15:48] that she is
[15:49] is now isn't that right because of the
[15:51] fall that's how i got programmed in it
[15:53] and she's gonna bring forth life into
[15:55] the world through much pain but it was
[15:56] supposed to be the spoken word
[15:59] huh if we to come that way folks we
[16:02] wouldn't have had a need
[16:05] well lord was that true or not they were
[16:08] awful quiet no because we'd have been
[16:10] we'd have been perfect
[16:12] it would be the way that it was supposed
[16:13] to be
[16:15] and god would have
[16:17] never been able to doub
[16:21] what do you call it display his
[16:23] attributes
[16:24] of what god really is
[16:26] so really when i get to thinking about
[16:28] faith i'm thinking about reliance on god
[16:31] i think about it brings in worship
[16:34] huh it brings in praise to almighty god
[16:38] because you know how many know that god
[16:40] when you say god well god means an optic
[16:43] war i mean god is that object of worship
[16:46] he's worthy to be praised
[16:48] and if that's what he is
[16:50] then that's what we come to church for
[16:52] that's what we do on a daily basis
[16:55] is worship god
[16:59] amen and worship him for what for what
[17:00] he is for what he means to us
[17:03] for who he is
[17:04] for how he supplies
[17:06] amen
[17:08] praise be to god
[17:10] i learned a little bit this week a
[17:11] little bit more just a little bit
[17:12] because i believe that the one thing
[17:15] that probably
[17:16] we all need tonight
[17:19] is to exercise that faith a little more
[17:23] huh
[17:24] i know i do
[17:26] i i gotta exercise that faith more
[17:29] amen
[17:31] praise the lord
[17:34] amen
[17:36] praise be to god reliable
[17:40] what a friend we have in jesus amen what
[17:43] a friend
[17:44] how many knows that when we grow
[17:47] up
[17:48] as we grow up as children we rely on mom
[17:52] and dad
[17:53] i mean we totally rely on they become
[17:55] god to us
[17:57] amen remember the story of how that the
[18:00] little child who was thundering and
[18:02] lightning and everything said mom stay
[18:03] here you know and he said no you'll be
[18:04] oh god watch us over now i want god with
[18:07] skin on
[18:09] you know and so to become god support
[18:12] rely on them when we get to the age of
[18:14] uh you get maturity we get to where
[18:16] we're out on our own and holding our own
[18:18] and so forth not rely on them some more
[18:19] but all through our life it doesn't
[18:21] matter how old we are we're always
[18:23] relying on somebody
[18:26] amen what a better what a better person
[18:29] to rely on than god
[18:31] completely rely on him
[18:34] i like that how many likes a reliable
[18:36] friend
[18:38] a friend that you can
[18:40] lean on somebody that can help you when
[18:42] you need
[18:44] when you have a need somebody help you
[18:46] that's what god does he's a reliable
[18:48] friend
[18:50] praise be aren't you glad that he said
[18:51] he never your free or be friends in this
[18:53] world might leave you but christ will
[18:55] never leave you
[18:57] amen jesus will never leave you he'll
[19:00] never forsake he is a how does that song
[19:03] go
[19:04] amen
[19:07] he's a lot he's a reliable friend that's
[19:09] what jesus is
[19:10] amen i'm thankful for that
[19:13] praise the lord
[19:15] amen rely we rely
[19:18] on
[19:19] god in
[19:21] everything we realize
[19:23] amen that that's
[19:26] what the people what the people think is
[19:28] a crutch
[19:30] is actually the life source it's what
[19:32] we're supposed to rely on
[19:35] and it's the most powerful it makes even
[19:37] though you're weak yeah even paul said
[19:39] i'm weak
[19:42] amen
[19:43] all human beings
[19:45] oh let me just put it this way in in
[19:48] perhaps
[19:49] a
[19:51] comeback so to speak
[19:55] people who think that christians that
[19:57] need god you know that are weak
[19:59] no they're actually just wise
[20:02] they're smart they know they have a need
[20:05] those people that don't think they do
[20:07] they're blind to their own need
[20:10] they don't even realize they need it
[20:13] amen
[20:14] they don't realize how weak they are
[20:17] or how bad a shape they're in yeah
[20:21] but somebody that relies on god knows
[20:23] the condition that he's in he knows that
[20:26] he needs a different frame of mind he
[20:28] needs a different way of thinking
[20:30] it has to be god's thinking not his own
[20:33] thinking because his own thinking always
[20:35] gets him in trouble it's always the
[20:37] wrong way
[20:38] look at the world
[20:40] look at the direction it's going that's
[20:42] where your carnal mind will take you
[20:46] amen
[20:49] sorry brother tommy just comes to mind
[20:51] some of you texted that they've got
[20:52] rooms now in these schools where the
[20:54] kids can go off and act like dogs or
[20:57] cats go meowing and barking and carrying
[20:59] on
[21:00] yeah we're gonna promote them maybe
[21:02] they're a cat or a something maybe
[21:04] they're you know
[21:06] come on folks
[21:07] you know where they're gonna go next
[21:12] i only got one thing to say about these
[21:15] school shootings
[21:16] they want the answer don't they
[21:19] they don't know how they know how to
[21:20] stop it
[21:22] there's only one thing that i can say to
[21:24] them
[21:24] and that is that they're acting
[21:26] perfectly normal for what they're
[21:28] teaching them
[21:30] they're exactly they're doing exactly
[21:33] what they are being taught that they're
[21:35] animals
[21:37] they come from animals
[21:41] go out there and see if them animals
[21:43] don't devour each other
[21:46] that's exactly what they do if you're
[21:48] not of their tribe they're going to wipe
[21:49] you out go in the monkey world
[21:53] i don't care if you're a baby i don't
[21:54] care what you ask them them thinks them
[21:56] dominant they'll kill them little things
[21:57] if they're not from that tribe and you
[21:59] teach them to come from monkey but you
[22:00] did it
[22:02] you took god out now i have no respect
[22:05] for human life there's no after there's
[22:07] no reckoning you teach them there's no
[22:09] right and
[22:10] wrong huh
[22:12] they taught them that
[22:14] they're just acting upon it
[22:19] amen that's the truth folks
[22:21] you take god out and there you got it
[22:24] chaos
[22:25] amen
[22:27] but i'm glad i'm glad that whenever you
[22:30] have god whenever you have faith in god
[22:32] it's what you're supposed to live by on
[22:35] a daily basis
[22:38] you know i got to thinking i was just so
[22:41] full of joy this weekend
[22:43] speaking
[22:44] about
[22:45] brother bannon one time he would come up
[22:47] here to the pulpit
[22:48] and he said well no i don't really have
[22:50] a message
[22:52] huh i don't have a message
[22:55] maybe we'll just thought to a scripture
[22:56] somewhere and see what the lord will
[22:57] have
[22:59] i'm like what in the world i don't know
[23:02] about you but actually nervous this guy

[23:21] kiki come up here and he cannot have a
[23:24] message
[23:25] and yet he can preach a great message
[23:28] so i have a question for you tonight why
[23:36] good answer
[23:40] for one thing i realized is that he is
[23:42] so full of it already
[23:44] huh
[23:45] he's so full of god already all he's got
[23:48] to do is open the bible he can go
[23:51] huh
[23:52] he can just take off anywhere and i'm
[23:53] like lord help me to be that way help me
[23:56] to be so full of god that i could come
[23:58] up here and not have anything and god
[24:00] still give me something
[24:02] he'd still say what he wants to say
[24:06] he'd still do what he wants to do in the
[24:08] service
[24:10] i believe we need more of that don't you
[24:14] more rely
[24:15] on
[24:16] faith in god man
[24:19] i understand and i do a lot of this and
[24:21] i really like what brother bam said
[24:22] about a lot of the messages that he gets
[24:24] he's driving down the road amen and
[24:25] he'll think of a pyramid or he'll think
[24:27] of a certain thing that he wants to talk
[24:28] about and perhaps some pyramid
[24:30] exemplifies but he's staying healed by a
[24:32] little pyramid as he's gonna throw down
[24:33] the rope on a piece of paper amen and
[24:35] then he have a paper pyramid and maybe
[24:37] he'll have uh just a little something
[24:38] else something else and it looks like
[24:40] greek writing probably when he gets up
[24:42] here to the pulpit all right what was
[24:44] the pyramid about what was this about
[24:45] and he just as god begins and that's
[24:48] what i do a lot
[24:49] i mean i try to keep god in my mind and
[24:51] just keep constantly living by faith and
[24:53] let god just show this and show that and
[24:56] amen and gel it down and discern the
[24:57] other and then and then just preach what
[24:59] god wanted to preach
[25:01] amen
[25:04] but i have never done what he did and i
[25:05] come up here with absolutely nothing
[25:07] that i know of
[25:09] amen might have seemed like it to y'all
[25:11] but i was supposed to have some
[25:15] amen
[25:16] oh yeah that's right sometimes we get up
[25:19] here and we never do
[25:21] don't ever do seem to get off the ground
[25:24] amen
[25:26] tonight a lot of times the hardest huh
[25:28] small crowd and not this much pool
[25:31] amen ain't got your amen corners or
[25:33] whatever
[25:35] folks that's when you find out whether
[25:37] somebody got something or not
[25:40] amen it takes a lot of prayer amen
[25:43] takes a lot of faith and paul's that's
[25:45] what he lives by
[25:47] amen let me just give you an example i
[25:49] like a little example
[25:51] and so forth
[25:52] oh my
[25:55] you know this week last saturday i guess
[25:57] it was and
[25:58] and i have
[26:00] wanted and needed some kind of a
[26:02] something with a bucket around on the
[26:04] farm
[26:05] and so my neighbor of course he passed
[26:07] away not so long ago and
[26:09] and and he's got a big farm a lot of
[26:11] equipment he got all there they were
[26:12] having a big sale there of different
[26:14] equipment and there was an old backhoe
[26:15] out there
[26:16] that they were
[26:18] digging a field line on one of his
[26:20] houses i guess and and right in the
[26:22] middle of digging that fuel line it just
[26:24] sat there for about two years it just
[26:26] sat in the field and growed up around it
[26:27] and it was uh oh maybe it's an old
[26:30] back forward backhoe
[26:32] and uh
[26:33] anyway i said well they don't that was
[26:35] it i wonder you don't know if that'll be
[26:36] at the sale and sure enough they drug
[26:37] that thing up there barely got it up
[26:39] there big bat flat tired almost you know
[26:42] the big tire were almost flat and when
[26:44] they went to try to crank it up it
[26:45] wouldn't crank and they had put a new
[26:47] battery in it and new solenoid
[26:49] everything and i had my eye on that
[26:51] backhoe i wanted that backhoe i said if
[26:53] it'll dig a little trench about 30 foot
[26:55] long that means it runs i need something
[26:57] that just runs i'm not worried about
[26:58] everything else
[26:59] amen
[27:00] you should have seen me driving out of
[27:02] there everybody looked through the smoke
[27:04] billow and i smoked everybody out
[27:06] leaving the place almost
[27:09] but anyway i prayed about it i said lord
[27:11] i'd sure like to have it but don't let
[27:12] me pay too much for it
[27:14] and let it be let it run if i do get it
[27:17] let it be usable lord if that's your
[27:19] will i try not to go over a certain
[27:21] price range talking to the lord right
[27:23] not over price range and so forth and i
[27:26] was but i really wanted it but anyway
[27:29] so we went to bed and on and so forth
[27:31] and uh you know
[27:33] it ended up i started at about 2 000 and
[27:36] it started about stopped at 24 so i paid
[27:38] 2400 for it that's not bad for backhoe
[27:43] amen it read it anyway i didn't know
[27:46] what to do for sure but i knew that
[27:48] somehow we could get it right and so
[27:49] after i bought i went home got all my
[27:50] tools got hydraulic fluid and got all
[27:52] everything every tool i thought i could
[27:54] might need to try to get that thing
[27:55] running
[27:56] when i got there some old man
[27:58] a wise old man he had he had they had it
[28:01] running because it was front of another
[28:02] piece of equipment they wanted to try to
[28:03] get back so they could get their
[28:04] equipment and he had it right i just
[28:06] praise the lord it runs
[28:08] but i brought my air compressor i was
[28:09] going to air him up and i heard up my
[28:11] mother tires and everything
[28:13] and sure enough it ran it backed up went
[28:15] forward just out of the other and amen
[28:18] and they hired it all up and drove it on
[28:20] home clicking the clock you talk about a
[28:22] click of the clock you ain't never heard
[28:24] of it
[28:25] my neighbor like the next day my
[28:26] neighbor says did you make it home i
[28:28] thought i'd never make it home
[28:31] i said yeah we made it i ran it i was
[28:33] getting that back patio already for
[28:35] everybody here next week but and trying
[28:37] to get that and running up now sure
[28:39] enough moved my gravel got my gravel
[28:41] moving it
[28:42] and uh right in the middle of all of
[28:44] that i was digging up some dirt and
[28:45] stuff and then that engine just quit
[28:49] it just quit
[28:52] and my heart did too i was like oh lord
[28:55] lord
[28:57] i was pretty confident
[28:59] it was you lying to tell me to go ahead
[29:01] and get this thing you know
[29:02] but now i'm not so sure anymore
[29:05] but lord it's got to be you know
[29:08] man i'm going to call joke you wouldn't
[29:10] have to pull this thing up and sell it
[29:11] for a job that's awfully expensive y'all
[29:15] but anyway
[29:16] so i was tired i was tired and riddled
[29:19] today or whatever i just
[29:21] i'm going home i'm going in i'm getting
[29:22] me a little nap i said something you're
[29:24] just gonna pick a nap i went in take a
[29:26] nap and rest a little while and
[29:29] i said well if it's blown up that's
[29:31] pretty much it
[29:34] but you know i said lord
[29:36] and i pulled the old dipstick out of the
[29:38] oil and it looked like it had diesel
[29:40] fuel in it and i'm like oh but that
[29:42] don't look good
[29:44] but anyway i said i guess that's it but
[29:47] and then we you know i says where's your
[29:49] faith you know did god tell you to get
[29:51] the thing or not you know but
[29:53] anyway and
[29:54] so afterwards i told my wife i'm going
[29:56] back out there to work on see what
[29:57] happens it says it couldn't have been i
[29:59] said it ain't the bold engine
[30:02] i said because if it was if the engine
[30:04] would have blowed with all that
[30:05] we ain't got no mosquitoes anymore
[30:07] around there i don't blow them all out
[30:08] with all that smoke
[30:12] and i thought that engineer would put it
[30:17] up
[30:19] that's kind of probably what it would
[30:20] have sounded like if it was the engine
[30:23] but it was running just turned and just
[30:25] stopped
[30:28] that's this wheel
[30:30] maybe it isn't the engine let me let him
[30:32] check the fuel line and i checked over
[30:34] there by the
[30:35] i think it was the uh
[30:36] what do you call that
[30:38] fuel injector or whatever took a line
[30:40] loose and and there's no fuel coming out
[30:42] i said should be fuel in there so i
[30:44] traced it back and there i go you know
[30:47] my ain't no diesel mechanic
[30:51] and i went trace it back to the gas tank
[30:53] and there was a t come out from
[30:55] underneath the gas tank and
[30:58] of course there's a big fuel filter over
[31:00] here i didn't bother with the main
[31:01] filter
[31:02] why i didn't i don't know i just now
[31:04] thought why didn't i go and check see if
[31:05] that thing's clogged i didn't i left
[31:06] that thing along went back here by the
[31:08] tank because i had a feeling something
[31:09] about the tank and when that thing
[31:11] little coupling coming i had to undo one
[31:13] line and
[31:14] and so that i could take a big wrench
[31:16] and maybe try to twist it off i don't
[31:19] know what i'm gonna rupture inside of
[31:20] there what i'm gonna do but i'm gonna
[31:21] twist this thing off turn it off sure
[31:23] enough
[31:24] and it brought that thing down and there
[31:26] was something that was about that long
[31:28] the size of a cigarette maybe a little
[31:30] bit thicker and sticking way up there
[31:32] and it was just duped with stuff
[31:36] i mean and i
[31:38] when i had put six gallons of fuel in it
[31:40] so whenever i unplug that thing you're
[31:42] gushing down i pushed my finger up in
[31:44] there and stopped it and had to do the
[31:46] cleaning with this hand while i was
[31:47] stabbing it and i'm like i wanted it you
[31:49] know flung it off and wiped on the grass
[31:53] there it is
[31:54] and the base back there can testify she
[31:56] heard somebody out there
[32:01] praise the lord donald said all the time
[32:04] he said i was in the house praying honey
[32:06] i'm praying
[32:07] now that lord just help me to have faith
[32:09] you're not so doubtful right have faith
[32:12] god god can do it he can help you figure
[32:14] this out sure enough put that back in
[32:16] and after a bit to recharge my body pop
[32:19] right back up again
[32:20] amen and i thought that's living by
[32:23] faith everything you do just have faith
[32:25] about it
[32:26] don't let it get you down just keep
[32:28] believing there's a purpose in it all
[32:32] amen if you've got to be junk it's got
[32:33] to be junk but never lose your faith in
[32:35] god
[32:36] amen don't let you can't and i was like
[32:38] really you know anything like that about
[32:40] a day's work of a work it's just not
[32:43] really worth twenty four hundred dollars
[32:46] but anyway so i was very thankful i said
[32:48] lord now it's purring referring for now
[32:49] so praise be to god
[32:51] and i thought look you know just help me
[32:53] in everything lord everything comes
[32:56] along because i thought man lord you
[32:57] know before i make a purchase before
[32:59] advice i like god to be my decisions
[33:02] don't you
[33:04] i need his guidance
[33:06] i need to be able to rely on almighty
[33:09] god remember but a man said he was up in
[33:11] those mountains and he was trying to get
[33:12] off the mountain and all that snow and
[33:14] he was a guide he thought he could find
[33:16] his way and he went in circles didn't he
[33:20] about twice or three times he come right
[33:22] back up to that dead deer and he says
[33:23] god help me i i'm no god
[33:26] right
[33:28] he thought he was
[33:29] but he realized he was not a god how
[33:31] many believe that in every one of our
[33:33] lives don't think that you guide your
[33:35] life let christ guide your life rely on
[33:39] him
[33:41] lord help me to rely on him
[33:44] in everything that paul said he didn't
[33:46] matter what it was he always relied on
[33:49] god he had faith in god
[33:51] that's how he lived
[33:53] he lived by faith
[33:55] the
[33:56] bible says if you're a just person
[33:59] if you're just
[34:00] remember the just shall live what
[34:04] by faith this is what martin luther i
[34:06] know maybe abc's tonight but martin
[34:08] luther whenever they're trying to say
[34:09] you've got to pay for your sins and you
[34:11] got to do this
[34:12] and you got to do that you got to do
[34:13] this and he says you know the bible says
[34:16] the judge shall live by
[34:18] faith he said that's it period no
[34:22] nothing don't give me all this other
[34:23] stuff let me live by faith and that's
[34:25] the way paul lives from day to day it
[34:27] didn't matter he didn't he says he had
[34:29] no certain dwelling place he'd been
[34:31] shipped back he had all kinds of this
[34:33] and all kinds of problems but no matter
[34:35] where he was no matter what he was going
[34:37] through
[34:37] he
[34:39] just kept his faith in god
[34:41] whether he was shipwrecked
[34:43] and paul was a good example of somebody
[34:45] that lived by faith
[34:47] shipwrecked thrice beaten with rods he
[34:49] said left for dead
[34:52] oh he had a terrible time but he
[34:53] realized if i'm going to live i'm going
[34:55] to live because i have
[34:57] confidence and it's up to him whether i
[34:59] live or die
[35:01] amen
[35:04] praise be to god you love him
[35:07] hallelujah aren't you glad that you have
[35:09] such a wonderful master to rely on to
[35:11] lean on
[35:13] amen i like that song leaning on jesus
[35:16] leaning on the everlas what a fellowship
[35:20] what a joy divine
[35:23] huh
[35:25] when problems come along like well like
[35:27] i mean you could get down and just oh
[35:28] you could just miss beyond that though
[35:31] what does brother

[35:34] jewel say though wally wally woos or
[35:36] something and yeah you know
[35:39] all dom and the blues and sad and
[35:42] everything else hey there's a plan that
[35:43] makes you sad am i right

[35:47] we need to live daily by faith because
[35:49] of what the world and the way that the
[35:50] world is going we got to live by faith
[35:53] paul he lived he says the life that i
[35:56] now live i live by the faith of the son
[35:58] of god it creates your world how many
[36:00] believes that hebrews 11 it talks about
[36:02] faith we know they understand that
[36:04] worlds were created by by god amen by

[36:13] praise be to god
[36:16] brother baby he says you know the most
[36:17] important thing the important thing one
[36:19] of the most important things that we
[36:21] need to master is to master if we expect
[36:24] to be fulfilled of god's desire in our
[36:27] life we have to master human ability
[36:31] amen we rely on our own selves so much
[36:35] amen we got to master that
[36:37] no ability i don't care whose it is will
[36:39] ever be usable in the sight of god god
[36:42] has to get your abilities
[36:44] quit relying on your abilities get rid
[36:47] of that and rely on him
[36:50] amen
[36:52] that's what brother bammy had to do when
[36:53] he was lost in the mountain he relied
[36:55] and prayed to god lord help me and god
[36:57] i'm miraculously open he says i you know
[37:01] i pray he prayed didn't he he prayed god
[37:03] lead me
[37:04] and then he just put one foot in front
[37:06] of another he says i'm going to just go
[37:09] i'll be god's going to believe me
[37:11] i mean that's how we got that's how we
[37:12] got to live just walk by faith

[37:16] god will lead you
[37:18] oh it's so good when he leads you

[37:24] heading straight into canada
[37:26] he was going the complete wrong way
[37:29] something could stop or whatever and he
[37:31] turned and looked and got opened through
[37:33] that whole snowstorm he opened up the
[37:35] fog and all that stuff and cleared away
[37:37] over by the tower there was a line that
[37:39] went down and you can grab that line and
[37:41] go all the way down to camp
[37:43] and got opened up so he could see that
[37:45] and he says he was going the wrong way
[37:47] your own ability you'll go the wrong way
[37:49] but let him guide you
[37:50] look over there go grab the hold of that
[37:52] lifeline and don't ever let go of that
[37:54] thing just hang on to that
[37:56] amen
[37:59] praise the lord
[38:01] and that's how i want to live you know i
[38:05] think about coming down you know as we
[38:06] get older we learn to rely on god more
[38:09] amen
[38:11] folks if if you don't rely on god when
[38:14] you get older all your aches and pains
[38:17] you you're gonna have
[38:19] plenty to complain about
[38:22] you know how you know how i can tell i'm
[38:24] getting older
[38:25] my wife mostly can tell and you being my
[38:28] church wife you can probably tell too
[38:30] because i talk about my aches and pains
[38:32] more
[38:32] we talk about the meditation medications
[38:35] that we got to take and all of this
[38:37] other thing and that's it that's what we
[38:38] talk about all the time is all of our
[38:40] problems and all the things we got to do
[38:41] to counteract that or the other we don't
[38:43] talk about a little bit of a
[38:45] hundred yard dash we're in or how good
[38:47] we feel or how great things are we're
[38:49] i'll talk about something you know about
[38:51] a family it's part of getting old
[38:55] i could talk about this here talk about
[38:57] my knee hurting right now or has all day
[38:59] here
[39:00] that's okay it's all just part of it but
[39:03] we live by faith praise be to god
[39:05] amen could be a lot worse
[39:08] isn't that right
[39:10] it'd be a lot worse folks
[39:12] one of the worst things i think that you
[39:14] can do is have to go to a nursing home
[39:16] huh
[39:18] be stuck in some room i guess you can go
[39:20] out to a back patio once a while and
[39:22] look at the little birds flying around
[39:23] but i'd really like to do a little more
[39:25] than that if it could
[39:26] god bless those folks help them bring
[39:28] that right
[39:30] be thankful faith
[39:32] faith you know it's just so it just it's
[39:34] awesome i mean he believes it you may
[39:36] because you're you're relying on that
[39:38] faith to legit to guide you you're
[39:40] relying on that's there's nothing more
[39:42] perfect to rely on just like
[39:47] david we know that he didn't
[39:49] amen he would never leave you
[39:52] he's a constant friend christ is a
[39:54] constant friend worldly friends might
[39:56] forsake you but christ will never
[39:57] forsake amen
[39:59] praise be to god i just love
[40:02] to be able to rely on him amen
[40:06] and to lean on him i like that i like
[40:09] the word not just rely but lean on him
[40:14] lean on him lord i need you for this
[40:16] lord help me to make the right choice
[40:19] here lord help me with this amen
[40:22] and i did a little work for sister sarah
[40:25] trying to get their porch railing up
[40:27] i'll tell you what before i go to a job
[40:29] i like to pray about that job
[40:31] by the time you provide more concrete
[40:32] you better pray a lot
[40:34] it'll pour out better
[40:36] it'll finish better
[40:39] every job you do when you pray about it
[40:41] first and put god in it keep god in the
[40:43] front front everything works out so much
[40:45] better
[40:52] amen put god in it first and it'll work
[40:55] out so much better
[40:58] amen and it might turn out you say well
[41:00] brother that doesn't always turn out so
[41:01] great
[41:03] it would have been a lot worse
[41:06] huh it'd have been a lot worse and if it
[41:08] gets really bad he'll help you out of it
[41:11] amen
[41:12] how many believes that
[41:14] that's right praise be to god
[41:17] amen i like that
[41:19] living by faith the faith of the son of
[41:23] god that's every constant day you know
[41:25] because sometimes we there's let me just
[41:28] say this i wonder sometimes if there's
[41:30] not too many sunday morning and
[41:31] wednesday night christians
[41:36] and the rest of time people don't think
[41:37] much about god don't pray but don't
[41:39] preach the bible much
[41:41] but come to church and do their religion
[41:43] or whatever
[41:44] you know what i thought about that
[41:46] this is what i can come come up with
[41:48] that if somebody truly is just a
[41:50] wednesday night a sunday morning
[41:51] christian they're not really a christian
[41:54] they're not really a christian
[41:56] because somebody knows a christian is
[41:58] sold out locks there he's 24 7 he's
[42:01] completely surrendered almighty god
[42:03] everybody else is just sad you know
[42:04] that's just that that's not
[42:06] that you're put on
[42:08] a make-believer perhaps
[42:10] amen
[42:15] then i thought about thought about
[42:16] brothers and sisters even
[42:18] even when we come down to the door of
[42:20] death
[42:22] people come down to the door of death
[42:25] and then all of a sudden they want to
[42:26] get close to god and they want a
[42:28] relationship with god they want
[42:29] fellowship with god
[42:31] huh
[42:33] i can come up with this i wrote this
[42:34] down that if if your relationship with
[42:37] god
[42:38] and faith in god wasn't very great all
[42:40] your life
[42:42] it's probably not going to be so great
[42:43] in death either
[42:45] huh
[42:49] for one thing you don't know when you're
[42:50] going to be taken and how quickly you're
[42:52] going to be taken
[42:54] so we want to be living we want to be
[42:55] living in the having the kind of
[42:57] relationship and fellowship with
[42:59] almighty god faith in him speaking with
[43:02] him having fellowship here with him and
[43:04] knowing that he's taken you and gotten
[43:06] you through so many troubles he's got
[43:08] you through so many trials he's
[43:10] delivered you so many times he's hold
[43:12] heal oh he's always been there for you
[43:14] there's nothing more great than asking
[43:16] god for something and
[43:18] and even how on the way to church
[43:21] i had asked god for something and i said
[43:23] lord you answered that prayer and i
[43:24] didn't even realize thank you jesus you
[43:26] actually answered my prayer i didn't
[43:28] realize it so i know i do you you're
[43:30] reminding me
[43:31] you know and just to know that god got
[43:33] to answer your prayers never
[43:35] fellowship that relationship

[43:39] get down to this lord you've delivered
[43:40] me from here and lord now i'm really
[43:43] going to need you huh
