[27:17] brothers and sisters
[27:20] we'll just stand this morning
[27:25] brother Joe will open us in prayer this
[27:28] moment
[27:30] foreign
[28:56] how many children can be dismissed for
[28:58] Sunday School
[28:59] and then we'll go in the songs
[29:05] 27
[29:13] which is beautiful outside it's a little
[29:16] colder today but
[29:17] sure was a beautiful day yesterday
[29:21] psalms 27
[29:27] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[29:29] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[29:32] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[29:34] afraid
[29:43] on house shooting Camp against me my
[29:46] heart shall not fear the war should rise
[29:49] against me and this will I be confident
[30:05] we're in the time of trouble he shall
[30:07] hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of
[30:10] his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall
[30:12] set me up upon a rock
[30:15] now
[30:29] here O Lord when I cry with my voice
[30:31] have mercy also upon me and answer me
[30:42] I not thy face far from me but not thy
[30:45] servant life in Anger thou I have seen
[30:48] my help leave me not neither forsake me
[30:51] o God of my salvation
[30:54] my ball
[30:59] teach me thy way O Lord and Lead Me in
[31:02] the plane path because of mine enemies
[31:16] I had fainted unless I had believed to
[31:18] see the goodness of the Lord in the land
[31:20] of the living
[31:22] wait on the Lord be of good courage he
[31:25] shall strengthen
[31:26] in my heart
[31:28] wait I say on the Lord God bless you may
[31:31] be seated brother Brian
[31:42] brothers and sisters
[31:46] um if you would turn with me I was
[31:49] thinking as brother uh Phil was
[31:51] preaching
[31:52] last uh Wednesday
[31:55] scripture here that really strikes out
[31:58] in the psalm here
[32:00] you know some of us haven't been asked
[32:02] to do this but
[32:04] excuse me for my
[32:06] voice here but um the 10th verse and
[32:09] that's on when it says when my mother
[32:11] excuse me when my father and my mother
[32:12] forsake me then Lord I Lord will take me
[32:16] up you know some most of us haven't been
[32:19] had that experience
[32:21] where to serve Christ and to serve the
[32:24] Lord where your mother and father
[32:25] forsake you well you know that scripture
[32:27] really has a lot of meaning that means
[32:30] as a as a man or as a daughter or son or
[32:34] a daughter when your father and mother
[32:35] forsake you that's pretty brutal you
[32:37] know but even here Dave is willing to
[32:40] put it all
[32:41] on on God and put it all on Christ no
[32:44] matter what happens around him he's
[32:47] gonna follow the path that God gives him
[32:50] the father whether his mother his father
[32:51] forsake Him whether his children
[32:54] forsaken What it could be the opposite
[32:56] whether your children forsake you
[32:58] whatever whatever
[33:00] is going to walk away from you because
[33:02] you make that right decision it he is
[33:05] willing to count it all lost just to
[33:08] embrace it but I was listening to Phil
[33:11] on Wednesday you know this chapter here
[33:13] this eighth chapter in Matthew
[33:16] uh you know me I have a tendency to jump
[33:20] right into things I'm
[33:22] there's a lot that goes on in this
[33:24] chapter you know you know the gospel
[33:27] says sometimes we forget it
[33:29] John said in the end of his Gospel of
[33:31] all the things were written that Jesus
[33:33] did while he was on the face of the
[33:35] Earth there wouldn't be enough books to
[33:37] contain the writings of all the things
[33:39] that Christ did while he was on the face
[33:41] of the Earth and especially in the last
[33:44] three and a half years of his life but
[33:46] you take the this eighth chapter here
[33:48] there's a lot of things that Jesus did
[33:50] before you get to this the last
[33:52] situation that brother Phil was talking
[33:54] about on Wednesday
[33:56] the first one is to heal the leopard and
[33:59] at no time in the other than Eliza
[34:02] healing name in the leper outside of
[34:05] that no one in Israel had been healed
[34:07] and he heals a leopard and then you go
[34:10] further he heals the servant of the
[34:12] Centurion later down in the chapter and
[34:15] then he heals Peter's uh mother so that
[34:18] they she can serve them and then you get
[34:20] down to this last bit here and uh
[34:24] our
[34:26] I'm trying to find a place I don't want
[34:28] to re-read at all again
[34:31] but I'll just at the end after the he
[34:35] cast The Devils out and they go into the
[34:37] hurt I'll start at the 32nd verse but
[34:40] it's that last verse that really struck
[34:42] me and that's where we're at today as a
[34:45] church and as a world and it all started
[34:47] the 31st verse and it says so the
[34:49] devil's besought him saying if I if thou
[34:52] cast out suffer us to go away into the
[34:55] herd of swine
[34:56] and he said unto them go and when they
[34:59] had come out and really struck me you
[35:01] know the devil's a devil he's going to
[35:03] be a devil you know he they wanted to go
[35:06] into the swine but you know they had
[35:07] other purposes in what they were doing
[35:09] and the sole purpose of a devil is to
[35:12] make everybody look the opposite
[35:15] direction of where they really should be
[35:17] looking so well
[35:18] um remember he said that I'm going when
[35:20] they went or come out they went into the
[35:23] herd of the swine and behold the whole
[35:24] herd of swine ran violently down a steep
[35:28] Place into the seat and perished in the
[35:30] waters
[35:31] and you know that devils are
[35:34] or demons they don't ever die they just
[35:37] go from one place
[35:38] to another and then and then he goes
[35:41] then and they that kept them fled and
[35:44] went their way into the City and told
[35:46] everything that was befallen to the
[35:48] possessed of the Devils so these men go
[35:51] back and tell the city the good things
[35:52] that Jesus did for these people where
[35:54] you cast out the devils and then we get
[35:57] to this last verse which is pretty
[35:58] brutal and the the people of that City
[36:01] say behold the whole city came out to
[36:04] meet Jesus
[36:06] and when they saw them him they besought
[36:09] him that he would depart out of their
[36:11] Coast so after seeing the Miracles that
[36:14] were presented before them they do a 180
[36:17] degree thing and they ask the very God
[36:20] himself to leave the city and to leave
[36:22] their area they didn't want him and I
[36:25] was just thinking that's that's pretty
[36:27] brutal that you're telling a living God
[36:29] but you don't want them in your city you
[36:31] don't want them in your life you don't
[36:32] want them in that you know that's where
[36:34] we're at today that's what's going on
[36:36] out there in the world this morning
[36:38] they're totally walking away from the
[36:41] grace and the blessings of the Lord and
[36:43] trying to embrace their own way in life
[36:46] and I was going to jump up to
[36:48] Thessalonians the fourth chapter here
[36:54] give you all I know we're getting a
[36:56] hurry I don't give you all a chance to
[36:58] catch up sometimes
[37:00] you know and uh I appreciate all your
[37:02] prayers last week uh last Friday I guess
[37:04] all you know that I had one of those I
[37:07] guess they call them a heart catheter or
[37:09] arterial catheter you know that's an
[37:12] awesome experience not in a bad way but
[37:14] you know they keep you awake and on the
[37:17] screen you can see very heart beeping
[37:19] and as they go for all your arteries to
[37:21] see if you have any blockages you know
[37:23] technology is a wonderful thing
[37:26] but I was fortunate that I didn't have
[37:28] any blockages the doctor was really
[37:30] worried
[37:31] I had I I'm not a nurse a doctor but I
[37:34] had a MRI with a high calcium a really
[37:37] really high calcium score so they
[37:39] thought I had some serious blockages and
[37:42] I just remember being on that table and
[37:45] uh I'm trying to find my place here uh
[37:47] being on that table watching them do
[37:49] their thing and then the doctor says the
[37:53] nurse and the doctor says he doesn't
[37:54] find any blockages and I yelled out real
[37:57] loud amen and the nurses were kind of
[38:00] funny yeah that's that's right so I was
[38:03] truly blessed
[38:04] uh you know
[38:06] you know if God is good that's all I can
[38:09] say but if you were to go with me to the
[38:11] fourth chapter
[38:13] you know you could get a good report one
[38:15] day and die the next day we don't have
[38:17] any continuing cities here on the earth
[38:19] you know we're not going to live forever
[38:21] like I used to tell the guys in the Army
[38:23] you know you're not going to live
[38:25] forever sooner or later you're going to
[38:27] die I mean so you do the best you can
[38:29] with the time that God gives you so
[38:31] going here I used to say it another way
[38:34] they didn't appreciate it very much but
[38:36] let's go to this fourth verse here
[38:38] furthermore then we beseech you Brethren
[38:41] and exalt you by the Lord Jesus
[38:44] that as you have received of us that you
[38:47] ought to walk in to please God so he
[38:49] would abound more and more
[38:51] for you know what Commandments we gave
[38:54] you by the Lord Jesus
[38:57] and this is the world of God even your
[39:00] sanctification that you should abstain
[39:02] from fornication now you can take that
[39:04] in in a natural way in a physical way
[39:07] but you really need to think of it in a
[39:09] spiritual way spiritual fornication
[39:11] where you're feeling your heart in life
[39:13] with things that you know that are
[39:14] contrary to the word of God not so much
[39:16] the physical stuff but you could do it
[39:18] in a spiritual way also and it goes on
[39:21] to say that every one of you should know
[39:23] how to possess this vessel and
[39:25] sanctification and honor not with us
[39:28] forgive my pronunciation hereof
[39:30] capaciousness even as the Gentiles which
[39:33] know not God and the Gentiles in this
[39:35] day were just our guts today I mean it's
[39:38] really striking that the way the
[39:40] Gentiles were back in Paul's day and are
[39:43] no different than the way us Gentiles
[39:45] are today a bunch of heathens and he
[39:47] goes on to say no man go beyond the
[39:50] defraud his brother in any manner
[39:51] because the Lord is the Avenger of all
[39:54] such I also have four warned you and
[39:57] testify for God hath not called us unto
[39:59] uncleanness but on the Holiness so
[40:02] there's a
[40:03] I could have been a positive and
[40:05] everything and he goes on to say he
[40:07] therefore that despises despises not men
[40:11] but God and who have given unto us his
[40:14] holy spirit
[40:15] and he and I'll finish with this Versace
[40:17] and brotherly love you need not that I
[40:20] write on you for you yourselves are
[40:21] thought of God to love one another and I
[40:24] was just thinking this morning I wrote
[40:26] this
[40:27] let me uh
[40:29] you know they were the rejection of that
[40:32] City this morning is a pretty brutal
[40:35] thing but I was thinking what do we do
[40:37] in our lives that we reject what God
[40:39] wants us to do what do we do that would
[40:42] kind of put them out on the outside
[40:44] and and I was thinking this morning
[40:48] the whole purpose
[40:50] of your enemy out there is to get you in
[40:53] a position where you're willing to
[40:54] compromise ever
[40:56] everything that you believe I mean I
[40:58] don't have a lot to say this morning but
[41:00] everything in that world out there is to
[41:02] put you in a position where you
[41:04] compromise everything you believe they
[41:06] totally are forcing you out there in the
[41:09] world not getting into the nitty-gritty
[41:11] you either have to stand with who you
[41:13] are and what you believe or you've gonna
[41:15] have to compromise and I was just
[41:17] thinking with the with the meteor age
[41:19] that we're in this morning
[41:21] nothing that we do whatever you do on
[41:25] out there in the world it's either being
[41:27] recorded or either on your phone on your
[41:30] tablet on vid everything we do is being
[41:33] recorded everything whatever mistake you
[41:35] have it's not just
[41:37] people knowing it anymore it's on video
[41:39] it's on everything so how more should we
[41:42] as human beings this morning realize
[41:45] that everything we do should be the
[41:46] right thing we shouldn't be willing to
[41:48] do the bad thing and I was you know
[41:51] first you know I'm coming to the end of
[41:53] my life I was just thinking of all as
[41:55] young people it's even worse for you
[41:57] today than it was for me when I was a
[41:59] young man we didn't have phones we
[42:01] didn't have tablets we didn't have any
[42:03] of those Contraptions when I was young
[42:05] you know so there wasn't anything to
[42:08] take your mind off of things and today
[42:12] it's just a like it's a spiritual battle
[42:14] you know the greatest battle brother
[42:16] Branham when he preached that message
[42:18] it's the battle in your mind and
[42:19] especially right now this morning there
[42:22] is so much that's going to try to
[42:24] consume your mind this morning that's
[42:26] going to try to take you away from the
[42:28] Gospel of Jesus Christ it's a it's a
[42:31] really horrible thing but the only way
[42:33] that you can stay purposed is that you
[42:37] choose not to see the things that you're
[42:39] not supposed to see this morning brother
[42:41] David
[42:48] this morning if we could man you love
[42:50] him with all your heart this morning and
[42:52] amen it's just good to be in the house
[42:54] of the Lord this morning
[42:57] amen
[42:58] God is good isn't he amen appreciate
[43:01] that Sunday school lesson and appreciate
[43:03] each and everyone that was here
[43:05] yesterday and uh
[43:07] we thank you all for those that helped
[43:10] and I know each and everyone had a
[43:13] wonderful time and you that couldn't
[43:15] make it and we prayed next year the Lord
[43:17] tarries that you'll be able to come and
[43:19] amen it was it's just a joy to get
[43:22] together with God's people and I was I
[43:25] was just kind of a
[43:26] amused yesterday because
[43:29] uh you know I was watching them and I
[43:32] never was good with a gun I still saying
[43:35] goes I couldn't hit the broadside of the
[43:36] barn and I just left mine at home I told
[43:39] Brother Tommy I said
[43:40] I don't want everybody laughing and
[43:42] shoot somebody because they get laughing
[43:44] at me because I've missed so bad so I
[43:46] just left mine at home and it was just a
[43:48] joy to seeing and the young children I
[43:50] know they they enjoyed it they made out
[43:53] like Bandits they come up with bags of
[43:55] candy about that tall and I thought well
[43:57] that's good that'll keep them hyper for
[44:00] their parents all night long but amen

[1:07:32] Christ amen and amen pray this morning
[1:07:35] we just greet you in the name of the
[1:07:37] Lord
[1:07:38] amen certainly uh was busy yesterday and
[1:07:41] amen always had on my heart on on
[1:07:45] Desiring a message from the Lord and
[1:07:47] then last night I think towards evening
[1:07:49] I went back there towards that hay bales
[1:07:52] and brother Brad
[1:07:53] he said something about he says well are
[1:07:55] you loaded and ready
[1:07:56] and brother Brad I didn't really answer
[1:07:58] you did I because I wasn't loaded
[1:08:00] already or not I was like I don't really
[1:08:02] know I'm not there yet brother
[1:08:05] I thought well maybe I ought to go to
[1:08:07] the church and just go to my office and
[1:08:09] just pray and study while everybody just
[1:08:12] does their activities and so forth and I
[1:08:13] said well it wouldn't be really nice
[1:08:15] either so I said you know and and
[1:08:19] earlier this week I felt like I did
[1:08:21] something that pleased the Lord and and
[1:08:24] after that it was just coming to my
[1:08:26] heart and my heart the Lord says I'll
[1:08:28] give you something I'll have something
[1:08:29] for you amen and and so that was
[1:08:32] Thursday and Friday so I felt
[1:08:34] comfortable the Lord was going to give
[1:08:35] me something and amen so the Lord just
[1:08:38] poured me out a little about something I
[1:08:39] felt like
[1:08:41] um a little thought that that I want to
[1:08:43] share with you with the help of the Lord
[1:08:44] amen so it just come to me last evening
[1:08:47] and amen just studying it and meditating
[1:08:51] upon it and of course you always want to
[1:08:53] make sure that it's not just you you
[1:08:56] know
[1:08:57] because
[1:08:58] um
[1:08:59] anyway so we want to make sure that it's
[1:09:02] the Lord and I just felt like it was
[1:09:04] according to his word and he just kept
[1:09:05] bringing it amen and so uh anyway we
[1:09:10] just trusted it'll be a blessing to you
[1:09:11] and it's certainly a simple thought I
[1:09:13] don't know how many has already looked
[1:09:15] at the web page of what the title is
[1:09:19] nobody looked all right you don't know
[1:09:21] yet but anyway I got to thinking about
[1:09:25] uh I forgot to thinking about uh Unity
[1:09:29] or Oneness is what I got to thinking
[1:09:31] about and but the word that came to me
[1:09:33] was Uno
[1:09:35] Uno no and I thought Uno Lord You're
[1:09:38] gonna give me Uno
[1:09:44] you know and then I got to thinking so
[1:09:46] much on Uno I thought about too and I
[1:09:50] had to look at Siri what this how do you
[1:09:52] say two in in Spanish I guess it is
[1:09:55] right and so it says dos
[1:09:57] Unos and those so that's what we're
[1:10:00] going to preach on this morning you know
[1:10:01] those
[1:10:03] amen so praise the Lord I thought boy
[1:10:06] that's awful simple brother you know but
[1:10:08] then they never thought the Lord says
[1:10:09] well you know you know what the prophet
[1:10:11] said he's the prophet said see how
[1:10:13] simple
[1:10:14] well you can be
[1:10:15] amen see how simple you can be it's not
[1:10:18] in the complicated and even the prophet
[1:10:20] said many times you know he says you
[1:10:22] know he'd give you if it's the Holy
[1:10:23] Spirit giving you something that's
[1:10:24] what's the difference amen amen so I
[1:10:27] trust it'll be a blessing to you amen so
[1:10:30] if you will amen let's just turn our
[1:10:32] Bibles uh to the book of uh Saint
[1:10:37] Jacques excuse me Saint John the 17th
[1:10:40] chapter and it is actually the Lord's
[1:10:44] Prayer amen this will be not uh the
[1:10:47] Lord's prayer that we know so well but
[1:10:49] this is the one perhaps that we don't
[1:10:50] dwell on so much
[1:10:52] but it was one of the last prayers that
[1:10:54] Jesus made
[1:10:56] amen and he made a prayer to the father
[1:10:58] for his children and those that he had
[1:11:01] given him and those that would come
[1:11:02] afterwards and there's a desire and a
[1:11:05] passion that Jesus Christ had that we
[1:11:07] want to dwell on with the help of the
[1:11:09] Lord this morning amen so let's just
[1:11:11] read here a little bit amen chapter 17
[1:11:14] verse 1 and these words spake Jesus and
[1:11:17] lifted up his eyes to him
[1:11:19] heaven now notice to heaven and said
[1:11:22] father so you notice that he's talking
[1:11:23] to the Father the hour has come glorify
[1:11:26] thy son that thy son Also may be
[1:11:28] glorified indeed as thou has given him
[1:11:31] Power Over All Flesh wow amen how many
[1:11:35] knows he had power over All Flesh it
[1:11:37] didn't matter if they because they
[1:11:39] didn't just take his flesh and crucify
[1:11:41] did they no he allowed them to do that
[1:11:44] amen it is nobody did but what he
[1:11:46] allowed amen and I want you to know he
[1:11:48] still has the same Authority today that
[1:11:51] he should give eternal life to as many
[1:11:53] as thou has given him and this is the
[1:11:55] life eternal that they might Know Thee
[1:11:58] the only true God then Jesus Christ whom
[1:12:01] thou has sent I have glorified
[1:12:03] but beyond the earth I have finished the
[1:12:06] work which thou gave us me to do amen
[1:12:09] may that be the same thing that each and
[1:12:11] every one of us can be able to say at
[1:12:13] the end of our life amen that we finish
[1:12:15] to work that he has given us to do you
[1:12:18] remember Paul said I have finished my
[1:12:19] race I have finished the course isn't
[1:12:22] that right therefore there is laid up
[1:12:23] for me a crown of righteousness amen
[1:12:26] all right and then and now oh Father
[1:12:29] glorify thy thou me uh glorify thou me
[1:12:33] with an own self with the glory which I
[1:12:35] had with thee
[1:12:37] before the world was
[1:12:39] I have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:12:42] which thou has given me out of the world
[1:12:44] thine they are down there thine they
[1:12:47] were and thou gave us them me and they
[1:12:49] have kept Thy Word
[1:12:51] now they have known that all things
[1:12:54] whatsoever thou has given me are of thee
[1:12:57] for I have given unto them The Words
[1:13:00] which thou gavest me and they have
[1:13:02] received them I mean those that's a very
[1:13:04] important part
[1:13:05] and I have known surely that thou and
[1:13:08] have known surely that I came out from
[1:13:11] thee and they have believed that thou
[1:13:13] did sent me I pray for them I pray not
[1:13:17] for the world but for them which thou
[1:13:19] has given me for they are thine and all
[1:13:24] mine are thine and thine are mine amen
[1:13:28] and I am glorified
[1:13:30] in them praise be to God how many knows
[1:13:33] that's where God is glorified in you and
[1:13:35] I and now I am no more in the world but
[1:13:38] these are in the world and I come to
[1:13:40] thee Holy Father keep to thine own name
[1:13:43] Those whom thou has given me that they
[1:13:47] may be
[1:13:49] Uno one
[1:13:52] and how many knows that's his heart's
[1:13:55] desire is that you and I would be one
[1:13:58] amen
[1:14:00] as we are I mean those Jesus and the
[1:14:03] father were one I mean if you have seen
[1:14:06] me you have seen the father
[1:14:08] while I was with them in the world I
[1:14:10] kept them in thy name
[1:14:12] those that thou gavest me I have kept I
[1:14:15] like that and none of them is lost
[1:14:17] except the Son of Perdition isn't that
[1:14:20] something I put that in there he didn't
[1:14:22] just say none of them's lost
[1:14:24] but he said except for the Son of
[1:14:26] Perdition because he knew that he would
[1:14:28] betray him in the first place isn't that
[1:14:29] right that the scripture might be
[1:14:31] fulfilled and now come I to thee and
[1:14:34] these things I speak in the world that
[1:14:36] they might have joy fulfill my joy
[1:14:39] fulfilling themselves
[1:14:41] I have given them Thy word and the world
[1:14:44] has hated them because they are not of
[1:14:46] the world even as I am not of the world
[1:14:48] I pray not that thou should take them
[1:14:50] out of the world but thou should keep
[1:14:52] them from the evil they are not of the
[1:14:54] world even as I am not of the world
[1:14:56] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[1:14:59] is truth
[1:15:00] as is sent me into the world so even so
[1:15:04] have I also sent them into the world and
[1:15:06] for their sake I sanctify myself that
[1:15:09] they also might be Sanctified through
[1:15:11] the truth neither pray I for these alone
[1:15:14] but I pray for all those
[1:15:16] that evening light Tabernacle listen but
[1:15:19] for them also which Shall Believe on me
[1:15:22] through their word praise be to God
[1:15:25] that they all may be one
[1:15:31] amen as thou father art in me and I in
[1:15:36] thee and they also might be one in US
[1:15:41] how many please God's desire Christ's
[1:15:43] desire was that you and I amen would be
[1:15:47] one with him
[1:15:49] amen that the world may believe that God
[1:15:52] has sent me amen
[1:15:55] and the glory which thou gave us me I
[1:15:57] have given them that they may be one
[1:16:00] even as we are one i in them and thou
[1:16:05] and me that they may be perfect in one
[1:16:07] and that the world may know that thou
[1:16:09] has sent me and has loved them and has
[1:16:12] as thou has loved me may God has
[1:16:14] blessings to the reading of the word you
[1:16:16] can be seated quite a lengthy reading
[1:16:19] wasn't it but you know I hate it to just
[1:16:21] jump through these scriptures you know
[1:16:23] because I know the punch lines are in
[1:16:26] those scriptures where it talks about
[1:16:27] amen that they all may be one amen just
[1:16:31] as the father and the son were one
[1:16:33] that's how God wants us to be one
[1:16:36] now tonight as we are this morning as we
[1:16:39] talk about this we want to talk about
[1:16:40] the power of Oneness amen the power of
[1:16:46] Oneness
[1:16:47] amen
[1:16:49] so we look at the number just let's take
[1:16:52] a little thought for here just to begin
[1:16:53] with first of all just the Simplicity of
[1:16:56] one
[1:16:57] now let me ask you something if you
[1:17:00] split now I'm gonna ask this a question
[1:17:01] and somebody can raise your hand if you
[1:17:03] want to answer it if you split it one in
[1:17:05] half how much do you have
[1:17:10] what do you got if you split a one
[1:17:15] raise your hand but Joe
[1:17:18] that's one answer what about another one
[1:17:20] anybody else
[1:17:22] who's raise your hand who's talking
[1:17:24] better John
[1:17:27] you got two that's really what I was
[1:17:29] looking for they're both true
[1:17:31] but you have how many halves do you have
[1:17:34] so two see you have two when you split
[1:17:37] one and have you got two now why because
[1:17:39] the one was splitting so of course in
[1:17:40] technical terms yeah half of one is a
[1:17:43] half you know but you still have two so
[1:17:45] automatically when you split that one
[1:17:47] you've got two
[1:17:48] or notes is that right now I want you to
[1:17:51] understand something that God loves one
[1:17:57] Satan loves too
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] he loves two we're going to dwell on
[1:18:04] that for a little bit
[1:18:05] and I it it all down through in almost
[1:18:08] every aspect of Our Lives we see the
[1:18:11] power of Oneness now I looked up one
[1:18:14] listen I didn't bring my phone but it
[1:18:16] talked about Unity meaning they're
[1:18:18] talking about something that is brought
[1:18:20] together and being made a uh as a whole
[1:18:24] all right as a whole because we know
[1:18:26] that as a church body amen the Bible
[1:18:29] talks about we're baptized into one body
[1:18:31] and there's one body in that light but
[1:18:33] it has many members but it's considered
[1:18:35] one body so even though there's many
[1:18:38] members it's still one that knows many
[1:18:40] members are one and that is the way it
[1:18:42] is with us and the father amen we know
[1:18:44] that amen first of all let me say this
[1:18:47] that our number the first thing that we
[1:18:49] want to do is talk about how that God is
[1:18:53] coming for a bride that is one with him
[1:18:58] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:19:02] Christ Jesus he wants somebody that
[1:19:04] thinks like her like him acts like him
[1:19:07] has the same spirit that he has because
[1:19:11] I may know when Adam was separated amen
[1:19:13] and he was brought out there was nothing
[1:19:16] about Eve that was part of that serpent
[1:19:19] everything about Eve was part of Adam
[1:19:22] she was a part of him amen
[1:19:29] and that's what God is looking for in
[1:19:31] this generation a bride and you know I
[1:19:33] was thinking this week amen just
[1:19:35] meditating our thinking on how that it
[1:19:38] is uh uh
[1:19:41] got a few thoughts running through here
[1:19:43] at once how did how did uh one is is
[1:19:46] simple it's straight you know even Jesus
[1:19:49] says I am the way I am the truth and I
[1:19:54] am the light I mean there's only one way
[1:19:56] and that is Christ he is the one way
[1:19:59] and he says you shall know the truth and
[1:20:02] the truth shall set you free
[1:20:06] and then I got to thinking about we say
[1:20:08] that all the time but I got a fresh
[1:20:10] Revelation on that and that is what are
[1:20:13] you free from
[1:20:15] oh
[1:20:17] there's a whole lot there right there's
[1:20:20] a whole lot there but the one thing that
[1:20:21] he said he says I am the truth Sinister
[1:20:24] he is the truth because you know
[1:20:27] anything outside of the truth is what
[1:20:31] it's a lie and what is it has two parts
[1:20:34] and has part truth part lie and that's
[1:20:37] the two that the devil gave to Eve he
[1:20:39] gave her two thoughts he says you know
[1:20:42] God knows that if he did this you're
[1:20:44] gonna have two you're gonna be ghosts
[1:20:45] you're gonna know good and evil
[1:20:48] and the devil specializes and he's got
[1:20:51] the whole world and they confused any
[1:20:53] deceived State because they love too too
[1:20:56] much you gotta say with simplicity
[1:21:00] you gotta stick with that one way that
[1:21:02] one truth one life
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:06] and I was thinking back to my thought
[1:21:08] talking about how that we can so clearly
[1:21:11] see how the world's going can't we
[1:21:13] imagine they have got everything they
[1:21:16] have got everything so twisted up they
[1:21:18] took prayer out of the schools and now
[1:21:20] they're scribbling people out there so
[1:21:22] confusing the kids nowadays amen until
[1:21:25] they don't know what sex they are
[1:21:27] anymore
[1:21:28] foreign
[1:21:29] that's and listen anything outside of
[1:21:32] the truth is a lie and why it's most 99
[1:21:35] of the people amen are believing a lie
[1:21:41] and that lie is not just pure Outlaw
[1:21:44] it's something that's mixed with the
[1:21:46] truth the way that he gave it to Eve
[1:21:52] truth in it but it's also not truth in
[1:21:54] it it's mixed
[1:21:57] amen
[1:21:59] and while I talk about how that God
[1:22:01] loves Oneness how many knows God loves
[1:22:02] Oneness
[1:22:03] he hates Tunis
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:08] what was it I believe it was
[1:22:10] brother Brandon talked a lot of and I
[1:22:12] don't know a whole lot about it but he
[1:22:13] talked about the Pentecostals some of
[1:22:15] them became Oneness and Tunis and
[1:22:17] threeness
[1:22:18] huh right some believe there's one God
[1:22:20] baptism then there was those that
[1:22:22] believed too and then there was
[1:22:24] trinitarians you know threeness and all
[1:22:26] of that and what did I'd say it caused
[1:22:28] them to split apart from each other and
[1:22:30] divide and all that he said it was is
[1:22:32] the devil
[1:22:34] amen now let me say this the God hates
[1:22:38] division
[1:22:40] God hates division
[1:22:44] amen but don't think that God will
[1:22:46] divide God does divide
[1:22:49] you don't mind dividing even Paul talked
[1:22:52] about divisions in the church and so
[1:22:54] forth and him how that you ought to
[1:22:56] separate yourself
[1:22:58] how many believe that if somebody's
[1:22:59] unruly and just won't do right separate
[1:23:01] yourself and don't keep coming if
[1:23:03] anybody causes divisions in the church
[1:23:05] he says he says smart not Man mark that
[1:23:07] man and have no company with him why
[1:23:10] because that's not God doing that
[1:23:12] because God had a little bit of that up
[1:23:13] in his church up there in heaven
[1:23:15] amen how many knows that and he kicked
[1:23:17] him out he hates that type of thing why
[1:23:19] do you think he said even amen with
[1:23:21] dates in the car he says you know they
[1:23:22] had a different idea whenever you've got
[1:23:24] two you've got two different ideas
[1:23:28] hello how many knows that in your
[1:23:29] marriage you are one you're you two are
[1:23:31] your one flesh and how sweet it is when
[1:23:34] you've got a marriage ain't nothing like
[1:23:36] me being married
[1:23:37] ain't nothing like having a good wife or
[1:23:40] a good man come on people
[1:23:44] ain't nothing like it but don't tell me
[1:23:46] that's not what if you have a real fight
[1:23:48] think about the worst fight that you had
[1:23:51] with your wife it ain't no pleasant day
[1:23:53] is it no it ain't a bit of fun come on
[1:23:56] people
[1:23:58] it ain't no fun
[1:24:02] it's stressful and you gotta go in
[1:24:04] climate tree or you'd rather live on the
[1:24:06] roof talking with a angry woman
[1:24:09] and they goes the same with a man folks
[1:24:12] if you ain't got unity and if you're
[1:24:14] having a trouble with this and it's
[1:24:16] because that you've got differences of
[1:24:18] ideas or differences of God is what
[1:24:21] causes
[1:24:22] dude those
[1:24:25] that's what causes two different ways
[1:24:27] two different directions and a lot of
[1:24:29] time to marriage the first thing you
[1:24:30] gotta establish is ahead
[1:24:32] cause somebody gotta be the head
[1:24:34] somebody gotta do some following
[1:24:39] amen
[1:24:41] oh my let me tell you something that's
[1:24:44] weird with Christ I'm glad that I have a
[1:24:46] husband that I ain't gotta never worry
[1:24:48] about making the wrong choice from you
[1:24:50] the wrong decision I can follow him I
[1:24:52] don't have to have my own thoughts of my
[1:24:54] own ideas I can know that what he is is
[1:24:56] right and could be almighty God I'll
[1:24:59] tell you this right now he said what
[1:25:00] time the Moses separate yourself from
[1:25:02] this whole month and I'll kill everybody
[1:25:04] that's one of them because this simply
[1:25:06] won't believe me
[1:25:08] you gotta separate yourself from my
[1:25:11] belief of the word of God you've got to
[1:25:12] believe every child every table you
[1:25:14] ain't gonna need no Rapture unless you
[1:25:16] believe every word you just believe one
[1:25:19] word and we gotta believe every word if
[1:25:21] you expect to make heaven
[1:25:31] that's what Jesus say about it this Unos
[1:25:33] and distorts he says there's two masters
[1:25:36] you're going to see everyone or you're
[1:25:37] going to serve the other make up your
[1:25:40] mind but if you're gonna serve me you're
[1:25:41] gonna have to be willing to separate
[1:25:43] from mama daddy brother sister you gotta
[1:25:45] be able to separate from why for
[1:25:46] children or whatever it is
[1:25:51] and I've got a note Road here let me

[1:32:14] desire of his heart
[1:32:16] before leaving
[1:32:18] that you and I would be one
[1:32:21] with each other first you got to be one
[1:32:23] with God how many believe that

[1:32:27] we got to be in this very image amen it
[1:32:30] has to be the very same thing yeah I you
[1:32:33] and you and me he says because he said
[1:32:35] in that day oh this is another
[1:32:36] Revelation that got this from this and
[1:32:38] that is amen that the scripture says
[1:32:40] that day better man said that day this
[1:32:42] day
[1:32:43] and it wasn't until this day that we
[1:32:46] knew that he was in the Father the
[1:32:49] father would yeah
[1:32:51] that he is in us and we are in him that
[1:32:54] we're one
[1:32:55] that you could never pass away that God
[1:32:57] can pass away then if you're born again
[1:32:59] tonight and God has kept you through
[1:33:01] every storm and everything I tell you
[1:33:03] that you are his amen and no man can
[1:33:05] pluck him Jesus said I've lost none of
[1:33:08] them I believe it'll be the story for
[1:33:10] you and for me he has lost
[1:33:13] Furious he's not gonna lose you
[1:33:16] don't run too far
[1:33:18] I know the balcony is a long way for you
[1:33:20] to run on that one but still
[1:33:22] isn't that nice to know that he's not
[1:33:24] gonna lose you
[1:33:25] he hadn't started to work in you to not
[1:33:27] finish it
[1:33:29] I thought that you'll know
[1:33:31] I'm in like brother Phil says you got to
[1:33:34] know who you are let the devil Know Who
[1:33:36] You Are
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] praise be to God

[1:33:45] Oneness was broken
[1:33:47] amen because eve took of that tree
[1:33:51] have the knowledge of
[1:33:53] Good and Evil
[1:33:56] let me tell you something do you realize
[1:33:57] what deceives the whole world today is
[1:34:00] dos
[1:34:02] dose is deceiving the whole world
[1:34:06] because like the prophet said people are
[1:34:09] out there they're partaking of good
[1:34:11] coming to church
[1:34:12] but you also partaking of evil
[1:34:15] you want to keep all their evil ways
[1:34:17] but that they come to church and claim
[1:34:19] Jesus Christ
[1:34:20] that's the deceiving part folks
[1:34:23] how many knows that Jesus crime could
[1:34:25] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:34:27] he came to make you to where you have
[1:34:29] nots but righteous and who you are no
[1:34:31] part of what the devil has to offer you
[1:34:32] the devil will get in any way that he
[1:34:35] possibly can
[1:34:37] anyway that he possibly can he will try
[1:34:39] to route you who is talking about that I
[1:34:41] think it was both Brian the Sunday
[1:34:42] School the devil looks at any direction
[1:34:44] to try to get to you
[1:34:45] everything you can possibly do
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:50] so it's Illustrated of course unity and
[1:34:53] Oneness is Illustrated in a in a a
[1:34:55] military aspect of it where you just
[1:34:58] about unbeatable when you've got that
[1:35:00] type of unity hello impenetrable
[1:35:05] cannot penetrate it
[1:35:08] oh don't you want to be that kind of a
[1:35:10] soldier that has on the whole armor of
[1:35:11] God like like Paul said in Ephesians 6
[1:35:14] putting on the whole armor of God that
[1:35:16] you might be able to stand against the
[1:35:17] Wilds of the devil not be taken by the
[1:35:19] wives of the
[1:35:34] The Shield of Faith where you will be
[1:35:36] able to quench all the fiery darts
[1:35:38] Hallelujah
[1:35:40] praise be to God

[1:36:06] sure there's time when
[1:36:08] and it's because there's two factions

[1:38:47] other part let's talk about separation
[1:38:49] Paul
[1:38:51] Paul said in uh

[1:38:57] minute
[1:39:07] I got a new Bible

[1:39:30] Romans 16. now I beseech you Brethren
[1:39:32] Mark then which caused divisions among
[1:39:34] you and offenses contrary to the
[1:39:36] doctrine which you have learned and
[1:39:37] avoid them
[1:39:38] for they are such that serve not the
[1:39:41] Lord Jesus but their own belly and by
[1:39:42] good words and fair speeches deceive the
[1:39:45] hearts of the simple
[1:39:48] First Corinthians 5. I'll quickly go
[1:39:50] through this
[1:39:52] First Corinthians 5.

[1:40:24] that right if you're never going to be
[1:40:26] around them well you just have to leave
[1:40:27] the world he says
[1:40:29] so you're gonna have company like that
[1:40:31] but listen he says but now I have
[1:40:32] written unto you not to keep drop me if
[1:40:34] any man that is called a brother
[1:40:36] huh he isn't just doing a little thought
[1:40:39] this out of the other but he's really
[1:40:41] bad when somebody gets really bad this
[1:40:43] is what Paul says
[1:40:46] a fornicator or a Covetous or an
[1:40:48] idolater or a
[1:40:50] healer huh bailing on everybody or a
[1:40:53] drunkard or extortioner with such and
[1:40:55] one no not to eat
[1:40:58] that's where the Amish get their uh you
[1:41:00] know their band and so forth you know it
[1:41:02] isn't just necessarily it is but if you
[1:41:04] come against in any way they'll not
[1:41:06] they'll put you in the band they won't
[1:41:08] eat with you not for a lifetime
[1:41:12] but here Paul said if somebody like that
[1:41:15] look if you're not going to straighten
[1:41:17] up brother I ain't going out to eat with
[1:41:19] you I'm not hanging with you if you
[1:41:21] don't straighten
[1:41:23] up I mean no that's come to even Paul
[1:41:25] Express you come to time and another
[1:41:27] place he says you know what somebody
[1:41:28] won't repent won't repent he's actually
[1:41:30] supposed to be put onto the church
[1:41:34] put him up as a heathen a Republican
[1:41:37] cause if anybody got such a hard spirit
[1:41:40] that they won't repent you don't want
[1:41:41] them in the church anyway
[1:41:43] huh
[1:41:45] is this all right
[1:41:47] I know it's a little past early but we
[1:41:49] need it
[1:41:50] amen because why God hates division God
[1:41:54] hates anything that comes in and
[1:41:56] disrupts Unity amongst the people
[1:41:59] he hates it
[1:42:02] oh my
[1:42:06] my he hates vision
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:11] gossip and all that stuff
[1:42:14] why because we're one
[1:42:18] all right let me just
[1:42:20] get a little further can I
[1:42:25] uncover the area of our families
[1:42:28] you got to be careful you got to keep
[1:42:30] the love between you how many knows
[1:42:31] husband wife
[1:42:32] you got to be careful because the devil
[1:42:34] is there to destroy you
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:38] you get to thinking that your wife isn't
[1:42:41] pretty anymore your wife isn't good
[1:42:43] looking anymore and this that or the
[1:42:45] other hello
[1:42:47] start looking at another you're in for a
[1:42:49] deep trouble you'll find out what was it
[1:42:50] Phil said he says you know the devil
[1:42:52] make you think that the world's prettier
[1:42:53] but when you get out there you find out
[1:42:55] it ain't pretty at all
[1:42:57] no it ain't fun at all amen
[1:43:00] vice versa husband wife amen that will
[1:43:04] get in there anyway he can't keep that
[1:43:05] love of keep that fire aflame you know
[1:43:07] how many beliefs by the BAM says you
[1:43:09] know keep the Revival in you all the
[1:43:10] time
[1:43:11] amen he also said this your farts your
[1:43:13] sweetheart let it all please be your
[1:43:15] sweetheart
[1:43:17] I believe that keep that way
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] all right
[1:43:24] now let's talk about this
[1:43:27] when I thought about the military and
[1:43:29] the lines
[1:43:31] that is in every Church
[1:43:33] a group of people here
[1:43:34] and let's go to the scriptures that
[1:43:36] comes to mind first and that is in First
[1:43:38] Corinthians 12 First Corinthians 12
[1:43:41] we're going to talk about
[1:43:43] we know that each individual has to have
[1:43:47] a personal experience with God isn't
[1:43:49] that right God don't God don't deal
[1:43:52] necessarily with us as a group
[1:43:55] he deals with individuals okay having
[1:43:58] said that we realize that after you do
[1:44:02] get the new birth and you become a part
[1:44:05] of Christ
[1:44:06] then you do become a part of a body are
[1:44:10] you with me
[1:44:11] then it becomes then you become part of
[1:44:13] a body
[1:44:17] and this explains it in chapter 12 verse
[1:44:19] 12 for the as the body is one and hath
[1:44:22] members many members and all members of
[1:44:25] that one body being many are one body
[1:44:29] how many believe that
[1:44:30] we as a church here are one body
[1:44:35] so also is Christ now notice here as I
[1:44:38] was explaining about in its personal
[1:44:40] experience for by one Spirit are we all
[1:44:43] baptized into one body you have to have
[1:44:46] that Spirit baptism experience
[1:44:49] but that Spirit baptism experience puts
[1:44:52] you into the body of Christ which is a
[1:44:56] many members
[1:44:58] body but it is still one body even
[1:45:01] though we're many members we're one body
[1:45:04] whether we be Jews
[1:45:06] Gentiles whether we Bond or free and
[1:45:08] have all been made to drink of Internet
[1:45:09] one spirit for that for the body is not
[1:45:12] one member but many
[1:45:15] and if the foot shall say because I am
[1:45:17] not the hand I am not the body is it
[1:45:19] therefore not the body
[1:45:21] and if the ear shall say I am not be
[1:45:23] here I am not of the body is it
[1:45:25] therefore not of the body no it is part
[1:45:28] of the body
[1:45:30] I mean if that's why it's so important
[1:45:32] and not always he Divine let me repeat
[1:45:34] that that's why it's not always easy to
[1:45:37] find the place that God has for you
[1:45:40] huh what God wants you to do
[1:45:44] and I will tell you this whatever you
[1:45:47] find God blessing you anything that God
[1:45:51] blesses you in you ought to be a happy
[1:45:53] person it is hard to find a job that you
[1:45:57] enjoy
[1:45:58] but if you find a job that you like
[1:46:00] doing that God has blessed you and he
[1:46:02] prosperences you and you're probably in
[1:46:04] the right direction
[1:46:07] is that right I don't care what it is I
[1:46:12] don't care if it's here for the what
[1:46:13] part of what God has you to do amen
[1:46:15] let's read on
[1:46:18] then it of course talks of the you know
[1:46:20] a lot of times even better Brampton
[1:46:23] everybody was trying to impersonate
[1:46:24] brother Branham and they deserve and so
[1:46:27] forth he says you don't know I have no
[1:46:28] idea what goes with it the
[1:46:30] responsibility and you know everything I
[1:46:33] can't imagine everything that the
[1:46:34] Brandon went through all I know is what
[1:46:36] he told me you wouldn't want this
[1:46:38] this is not a coveted place
[1:46:41] God has to call you to do this amen
[1:46:44] just find what God has called you to do
[1:46:46] don't try to take the football from
[1:46:48] somebody else
[1:46:49] whatever God has done called you to do
[1:46:51] now notice
[1:46:54] for the whole body were one eye where
[1:46:55] were the hearing and if the whole were
[1:46:57] hearing where were the smelling but now
[1:47:00] has God said the members every one of
[1:47:02] them in the body as it has pleased him
[1:47:06] and if they were all one member then
[1:47:08] where were the body
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:12] I came to just imagine a hand going down
[1:47:15] through there just just an arm and a
[1:47:18] hand that's it that's the whole body and
[1:47:19] just crawling around trying to get
[1:47:20] around
[1:47:21] if it was all just an arm and a hand if
[1:47:23] that's all it was is what he's saying
[1:47:25] but would the body be what good would
[1:47:27] that do
[1:47:28] huh
[1:47:32] if everything was just ahead
[1:47:34] that's all you'd see
[1:47:37] well it's just a head floating head
[1:47:41] no arms and legs
[1:47:44] be bad wouldn't it
[1:47:46] all right he says but now there are many
[1:47:49] members yet why
[1:47:53] amen how many Blues were one and the eye
[1:47:55] cannot say to the hand I have no need of
[1:47:57] thee nor again to head unto defeat I
[1:48:00] have no need to be
[1:48:02] now what is he trying to say
[1:48:04] sometimes we think well we don't need
[1:48:07] that person
[1:48:09] we don't need that person we don't need
[1:48:11] that person in the church that person
[1:48:13] boy he's so different you know I don't I
[1:48:15] don't really like his personality I
[1:48:17] don't you know
[1:48:18] come on you need a good old-fashioned
[1:48:20] prayer meeting
[1:48:21] thank God everybody's not like you
[1:48:22] because I'm somebody come up smack you
[1:48:24] because they don't like the way you are
[1:48:26] foreign
[1:48:37] that's right and those members of the
[1:48:38] body which we think are less honorable
[1:48:40] upon those please bestowed a more
[1:48:42] abundant honor and our comedy Parts have
[1:48:44] more abundant calmness for our commonly
[1:48:47] Parts have no need but God has tempered
[1:48:49] the body together
[1:48:50] having given an abundant honor in that
[1:48:52] part which lack that there should be no
[1:48:55] Chisholm in the body but that the
[1:48:57] members should have the same Care at one
[1:48:59] for the other
[1:49:01] amen I mean no you find out that you
[1:49:03] have an appendix that's being bad or you
[1:49:06] have something else or liver something's
[1:49:07] going wrong but I'll tell you what
[1:49:08] you're not going to focus on your head
[1:49:10] you're not going to go to the ear doctor
[1:49:11] you're not going to go to the eye doctor
[1:49:12] you're going to go to the liver doctor
[1:49:14] why you focus on what is hurting there
[1:49:17] and that's the way it is we ought to
[1:49:18] take care Bible says that we ought to
[1:49:20] love one another like that
[1:49:22] that when one's hurting they all hurt we
[1:49:24] all fear for that one person
[1:49:27] amen
[1:49:28] all right
[1:49:30] and whether one member suffered a man
[1:49:31] all members suffer with it or one member
[1:49:33] Beyond it all members Rejoice with it
[1:49:35] for ye are the body of Christ and
[1:49:37] members in particular praise the Lords
[1:49:41] how many knows we all have our place
[1:49:44] foreign
[1:49:51] this is what I want to say whatever God
[1:49:53] has blessed you in use that blessing to
[1:49:56] be edifying to the rest of the body and
[1:49:59] to the body I mean to the kingdom of God
[1:50:02] amen
[1:50:03] whatever he has bless you in it use it
[1:50:06] for the body of Christ and for the
[1:50:08] kingdom of God
[1:50:09] that's the way God intended it for to be
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:14] amen if you don't know for sure what you
[1:50:17] are what you should do
[1:50:18] hang around a while God will direct you
[1:50:21] amen one thing that prophet of God
[1:50:22] taught us that if you have a gift I
[1:50:24] don't care if it's for preaching or what
[1:50:25] it is God Will Make A Way for that gift
[1:50:28] they'll make a way for it if you don't
[1:50:30] make a way for it then maybe you're not
[1:50:32] called because God will open the doors
[1:50:34] for you amen he'll make a way for that
[1:50:36] gift
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:39] all right praise the Lord so we see that
[1:50:42] we're a body now
[1:50:44] brother random this is if we're going to
[1:50:46] go in closing perhaps or count towards
[1:50:48] the end of it but we're going to talk a
[1:50:49] little bit about what weather brandom it
[1:50:51] is letter to the church a scripture and
[1:50:52] the quote that we have read many times
[1:50:54] and I want to say this as a pastor this
[1:50:55] this scripture has been read many times
[1:50:57] across the pulpit here in the little
[1:50:59] church down there
[1:51:00] and a lot of us haven't heard it maybe
[1:51:02] not us but people haven't
[1:51:04] we got to hear it I mean it's when the
[1:51:06] voice of gods be it's important that you
[1:51:09] hear
[1:51:10] it's important that it goes down in
[1:51:11] there
[1:51:13] and I look at this and I think this
[1:51:15] ought to be hung on our wall somewhere
[1:51:18] amenities quotes
[1:51:19] because I believe it was called a letter
[1:51:21] to the church it was quote the brother
[1:51:22] Banner made about the protection how we
[1:51:25] keep the devil up
[1:51:27] how did we keep the unity of the faith
[1:51:30] have I read that scripture yet I haven't
[1:51:32] read that yet
[1:51:36] Ephesians 4 says I therefore a prisoner
[1:51:39] of the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:51:40] worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
[1:51:42] called with all loneliness and meekness
[1:51:44] with long suffering putting up with each
[1:51:47] other forbearing one another in love
[1:51:50] I mean those it's not always not and
[1:51:52] they don't always go perfect
[1:51:55] there'll be people that say a little
[1:51:56] something or do something that you don't
[1:51:58] like or that's offensive
[1:51:59] that has to be dealt with forgiven or
[1:52:01] taken care of or whatever amen
[1:52:04] but we have to forbear one another
[1:52:06] this just comes well I hope I don't
[1:52:08] forget it but I want to say this at the
[1:52:10] right time for bearing one another in
[1:52:11] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:52:15] the spirit
[1:52:16] in the bond of peace and if I was going
[1:52:18] to title this anything else it would
[1:52:20] have been keeping the unity of the
[1:52:21] spirit
[1:52:22] keeping the Oneness keeping the unity of
[1:52:26] the spirit
[1:52:30] there is one
[1:52:32] body amen I'm going to be there's one
[1:52:35] body
[1:52:37] not two
[1:52:38] not 900
[1:52:40] one there's one body
[1:52:43] and it isn't just this is a local body I
[1:52:46] mean as we're a local body
[1:52:48] this is this isn't all of the body of
[1:52:51] Christ
[1:52:52] amen and I don't know how many in here
[1:52:55] are part of this body
[1:52:57] huh I trust we all are hope we all
[1:52:59] confessing to be Christians and if not
[1:53:01] then you wouldn't be you know a part of
[1:53:04] the body of Christ maybe not everybody
[1:53:05] is I don't know
[1:53:06] only let me say this only God knows
[1:53:10] yeah only God knows you don't even have
[1:53:12] to try to figure that one out
[1:53:15] he did
[1:53:17] there's one body and one spirit
[1:53:22] oh my I love that how we could take that
[1:53:24] and talk about you know if we're all uh
[1:53:26] uh you know we were all in Fellowship
[1:53:28] I'm with another if we're baptized into
[1:53:30] the body if God how many believes the
[1:53:31] Holy Spirit has fellowship with the Holy
[1:53:33] Spirit
[1:53:34] absolutely when people get baptized with
[1:53:36] the Holy Ghost you have Fellowship one
[1:53:38] with another
[1:53:42] can I say something
[1:53:45] I don't know why I say that but I do
[1:53:47] just a bad habit
[1:53:48] I'm gonna say it anyway anyway right
[1:53:52] if I don't forget before I do all that
[1:53:56] if we don't have Fellowship there's
[1:53:58] something wrong
[1:54:01] there's something wrong if we don't have
[1:54:02] Fellowship
[1:54:04] something wrong
[1:54:07] because if you're in the same body I'm
[1:54:09] in you have the same spirit I have
[1:54:11] you're going the Bible says you're going
[1:54:13] to have Fellowship one with another
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:17] and I believe we ought to have
[1:54:19] Fellowship
[1:54:20] how many believe that we ought to have
[1:54:21] Fellowship one with another
[1:54:23] we had a fellowship together can I say
[1:54:25] something else
[1:54:26] a church group that can hang out
[1:54:28] together fellowship with one another
[1:54:29] there's something wrong
[1:54:32] huh you got a little bitterness you got
[1:54:34] a little problem or you just got a
[1:54:36] problem with what this one says or you
[1:54:37] don't like the way he says it I don't
[1:54:38] know
[1:54:40] but you shouldn't have
[1:54:41] we should have Fellowship one with
[1:54:43] another I know pastors that have told me
[1:54:45] you know it's important and I believe it
[1:54:46] it's important for us to have Fellowship
[1:54:48] together
[1:54:49] you know we I miss our fellowship
[1:54:50] meetings in there and our carry-ins

[1:56:00] far off and so sometimes we'll maybe do
[1:56:02] that okay all right now
[1:56:04] so we see that we're a local body body
[1:56:07] of Christ we know where it is I'm in
[1:56:09] knows where the body of Christ is that
[1:56:11] it's Universal
[1:56:12] people in Africa in the uh Indonesia I
[1:56:16] don't care where you are I don't care if
[1:56:18] you're in China
[1:56:19] speaking Chinese if they're baptized
[1:56:21] with the Holy Ghost you're in the same
[1:56:22] body that you're in they're your
[1:56:24] brothers and they're your sisters I
[1:56:25] don't care Creed race or what it is
[1:56:28] amen
[1:56:30] oh my
[1:56:34] this just comes to mind you know because
[1:56:36] of what's going around but you know it
[1:56:39] is pathetic we think it's very pathetic
[1:56:41] how to how that their the homosexuals
[1:56:44] now are getting to our kids not ours but
[1:56:46] the world's kids
[1:56:47] I mean it was in Sodom and Gomorrah they
[1:56:49] pushed themselves upon the whole city
[1:56:51] even to even to lot and so forth
[1:56:54] and that's what's that's the agenda
[1:56:56] that's going on they aren't happy with
[1:56:57] just you know you know coming out no now
[1:57:00] they want to go into your schools and
[1:57:01] they want to molest your children
[1:57:03] pedophiles all of that they're trying to
[1:57:05] get that to be okay and stuff it's just
[1:57:07] terrible mix them all up but you know I
[1:57:09] thought about this is what I thought and
[1:57:11] perhaps didn't finish here a while ago
[1:57:12] and that is as we see the world and how
[1:57:14] it's going you know it's plain to see
[1:57:16] that but my question is do you see what
[1:57:19] God is doing
[1:57:21] God is doing something in his people
[1:57:23] this morning
[1:57:25] he's doing something and I don't know if
[1:57:27] you can see it in somebody else or not
[1:57:29] but I hope that you can see God working
[1:57:31] in your life
[1:57:33] that he is getting you ready
[1:57:36] to meet him he is bringing you to
[1:57:38] Oneness with him to join him in the air
[1:57:41] as the world is getting more departs and
[1:57:43] more crooked and more filthy you're
[1:57:45] getting older you're getting cleaner
[1:57:47] you're becoming more like him you're
[1:57:49] thinking more like him are you with me
[1:57:52] because we're going to leave this place
[1:57:53] one of these days and God is going to
[1:57:55] have that church and it's going to be
[1:57:57] without spot amen and it's going to be
[1:58:00] without wrinkle
[1:58:01] and it's gonna be without any such thing
[1:58:05] or any blemish
[1:58:06] how many believe that he's getting us
[1:58:09] ready amen I believe that he's getting
[1:58:11] us ready to be an invincible Army
[1:58:14] how many wants to get to a place to
[1:58:16] where the devil can't touch you
[1:58:20] yeah I want to get to a place where the
[1:58:22] devil don't know what to do with me
[1:58:25] he don't know what to do with you

[1:58:30] praise be the guy we're getting to that
[1:58:32] place I feel it amen I can I I know God

[1:58:40] sufferings and those trials and those
[1:58:42] things that come your way that is for
[1:58:44] your good
[1:58:45] and it is to bring you closer to Christ

[1:59:04] have an iPod the event is all easy
[1:59:07] and what does easy bring laziness at
[1:59:10] lukewarmness that's what it produces war
[1:59:13] and hardship bring character and we
[1:59:16] ain't had none of that in a long time
[1:59:18] and that's why we're dealing with more
[1:59:21] than ever a laodicea age

[2:01:07] group together to keep the devil out huh
[2:01:10] keep evil away
[2:01:13] he says it now do you remember that the
[2:01:16] enemy will come right
[2:01:18] and what he does just bring that much
[2:01:21] closer together

[2:01:41] another above everything love one
[2:01:43] another no matter what the devil does

[2:02:02] family just like your home husband and
[2:02:05] wife man it is nothing sweeter but the
[2:02:07] devil don't like that

[2:02:10] he wants to bring something division he
[2:02:13] wants to cause some difference
[2:02:14] the kids having fun together playing
[2:02:16] together
[2:02:17] he don't like that he wants to fight him
[2:02:19] get him to fight over a toy well for
[2:02:22] those adults it's just big toys or gifts
[2:02:24] or something else we fuss about
[2:02:26] all right
[2:02:27] no no sweet group now and remember my
[2:02:30] warning Satan won't let you stay that
[2:02:33] way
[2:02:34] in other words he's going to try to get
[2:02:37] in somehow
[2:02:38] he's gonna try to take your joy from you
[2:02:42] thank you
[2:02:45] amen Satan won't let you say that but no
[2:02:47] sir he'll shoot everything if he has to
[2:02:50] bring somebody in to make his Target
[2:02:57] now when I underline that
[2:03:01] because this is what I thought about we
[2:03:03] as a group Brother Brad
[2:03:05] I know you brother Brad I know your
[2:03:06] heart's desires it's a Joyce your family
[2:03:10] it meant all of us
[2:03:12] we know each other don't we do we know
[2:03:14] each other we get to play together we
[2:03:16] get to pray together we get the church
[2:03:17] together we interact with each other we
[2:03:20] know how each other are don't we
[2:03:22] so we should be able to tell whether
[2:03:24] this is a good guy or whether it is not
[2:03:26] a good guy
[2:03:28] huh
[2:03:30] and like brother Benham says as long as
[2:03:32] we have taken communion together we
[2:03:34] broke bread together
[2:03:36] and then all of a sudden one fusses with
[2:03:39] the other
[2:03:40] huh
[2:03:41] and he says now notice it's not Leo and
[2:03:44] it's not Gene right but it's the devil
[2:03:47] sometimes it gets in Among Us
[2:03:49] but I want you to know as your pastor
[2:03:51] it's important that you believe that
[2:03:54] your brother is good
[2:03:55] that your sister's good
[2:03:58] that they're not normally this way they
[2:04:00] don't normally act this way so it's not
[2:04:02] them it's the devil
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:06] not as a pastor I know this and if
[2:04:08] somebody continuously does it there's
[2:04:11] something wrong there
[2:04:12] you better watch that person you may not
[2:04:14] want to go to eat with that person
[2:04:16] don't hang with that person don't listen
[2:04:18] to that person don't you take sides with
[2:04:19] them do you even just don't even get in
[2:04:21] here
[2:04:22] and his deadly stuff huh you got to know
[2:04:26] these things
[2:04:27] amen
[2:04:29] that's why he says he'll have to if you
[2:04:30] have to bring somebody else in we all
[2:04:32] know that somebody else come to church
[2:04:34] here we want to get to know him
[2:04:36] huh

[2:04:42] huh gossip with him yeah it's gonna feel
[2:04:44] out see if he gossip or she gossip
[2:04:47] huh maybe you don't want to do that but
[2:04:49] still
[2:04:52] you want to find out
[2:04:54] they jump on the bandwagon and boys
[2:04:56] start railing he says
[2:04:59] well brother I don't really I don't
[2:05:00] really mean that I'm sorry I didn't say
[2:05:02] that about him huh
[2:05:06] we what my point is
[2:05:08] we know we need to know that we're all
[2:05:10] and I believe this this is what I've
[2:05:13] thank God for
[2:05:15] you get on my knees and thank God
[2:05:19] that God has given me holy ghost-filled
[2:05:22] people
[2:05:24] Holy Ghost Field church people that love
[2:05:26] the Lord
[2:05:28] I don't know any of you that's evil I
[2:05:30] don't know any in here that doesn't want
[2:05:32] to make heaven
[2:05:33] huh
[2:05:34] I thank God for for what I'm about to
[2:05:37] read and so forth and and and the peace
[2:05:40] that the Lord has given the evening that
[2:05:41] Tabernacle the unity the Oneness that we
[2:05:44] have now I say this because we know that
[2:05:46] you know it's you know the devil's
[2:05:49] always going to try isn't it he's always
[2:05:51] going to try
[2:05:56] my my
[2:06:00] I'm not I wouldn't say all the things
[2:06:02] that I've seen and the things that I
[2:06:04] know but this I know the devil don't
[2:06:06] give up
[2:06:08] you'll keep trying and I've tried my
[2:06:11] best to teach y'all
[2:06:13] where he comes in at and how he comes in
[2:06:15] that because you're the one that has to
[2:06:16] stop him I can't be there to stop him
[2:06:18] you have to be there to stop him
[2:06:22] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[2:06:25] huh critic critic is something that
[2:06:28] somebody that's critical right
[2:06:30] criticizes
[2:06:33] how many knows buddy I'll tell you what
[2:06:35] if you come here this morning to
[2:06:37] criticize a preacher you probably
[2:06:39] already got about half a dozen maybe two
[2:06:40] dozen I don't know things are criticize
[2:06:42] me about
[2:06:44] well he shouldn't have said that and you
[2:06:45] know probably did
[2:06:47] I don't know but listen give you
[2:06:49] something to criticize about so notice
[2:06:51] and set him down and cause him to
[2:06:53] fellowship with you under the quietness
[2:06:55] of things and then he'll shoot that guy
[2:06:57] with some kind of poison stuff and he'll
[2:06:59] go through the church with it
[2:07:01] huh
[2:07:04] not don't you take sides with it don't
[2:07:08] you have nothing to do with anything
[2:07:09] else
[2:07:10] you just stay loving and sweet because
[2:07:13] I'm in those if he's telling you to say
[2:07:15] loving is sweet there's others probably
[2:07:16] being bitterness
[2:07:18] malice in
[2:07:20] something besides sweetness and loving
[2:07:22] is what it's bringing in that's how the
[2:07:24] devil tries to get in and amongst your
[2:07:25] ranks he tries to break the ranks get
[2:07:27] them Shields onto the side
[2:07:30] now all you gotta do is let down your
[2:07:31] ear one time to listen all you gotta do
[2:07:33] is to listen to gossip
[2:07:35] and I I I want to say this while it
[2:07:37] comes to mind but better man I'm talking
[2:07:38] about he says you don't even want any
[2:07:40] funny feelings
[2:07:42] are you with me in other words be so
[2:07:44] guarded have that wall up so hard be so
[2:07:47] one until you won't even let a funny
[2:07:49] feeling come into my heart because you
[2:07:50] know if you get a funny feeling towards
[2:07:52] somebody it goes more than just a funny
[2:07:54] feeling
[2:07:56] that person don't like me
[2:07:59] huh
[2:08:00] you know and and it goes from there or
[2:08:03] it tries to go underneath
[2:08:06] something happens in the root of
[2:08:07] bitterness
[2:08:09] Creeps in underneath and he's files many
[2:08:13] of the Bible says a root of bitterness
[2:08:15] folks how many knows let me tell you
[2:08:16] something
[2:08:17] Devil is a master at it if a pastor
[2:08:20] doesn't hit this once in a while
[2:08:22] and hard maybe all the time like I do a
[2:08:26] lot
[2:08:27] the devil will try to creep in
[2:08:29] amen
[2:08:32] don't have nothing to do with anything
[2:08:34] else say sweet and kind but pray for
[2:08:36] that man that he'll be saved to or woman
[2:08:39] forever who it is just pray for them and
[2:08:42] stick one with another and stay with
[2:08:44] your pastor
[2:08:46] huh stay with your pastor
[2:08:49] because he's the shepherd and he'd give
[2:08:50] him respects he'll lead you through he's
[2:08:52] ordained of God to do so
[2:08:54] now you remember that the enemy will
[2:08:56] come but when he does you cling that
[2:08:58] much closer to one another and the one
[2:09:00] that the devil is using for an enemy and
[2:09:03] I know he's talking about the devil
[2:09:04] right
[2:09:05] they will try to use somebody use the
[2:09:07] foreign enemy will either get out or
[2:09:10] come in and be one with you
[2:09:14] uh you know you ain't got to tell
[2:09:16] somebody very often don't talk to me
[2:09:19] about that stuff
[2:09:21] or I don't hear it
[2:09:24] in most people that's the last time
[2:09:26] you're gonna have any problems having to
[2:09:28] listen to it but sometimes that's what
[2:09:29] you got to say I don't want to hear
[2:09:31] don't tell me about that stuff don't be
[2:09:34] ought to be going around talking well
[2:09:35] that really squirts them a little
[2:09:38] and if I find out you are I'm gonna let
[2:09:40] this faster now
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:44] why because of random new the shrewdness
[2:09:46] of the devil he knew how he would come
[2:09:49] in
[2:09:50] amen and what he'd do
[2:09:53] all right
[2:09:56] now notice here's another thought that's
[2:09:58] all and don't never Clan amongst
[2:10:00] yourselves or make yourself clannish
[2:10:03] now usually in a small group like this
[2:10:05] most of us we aren't we don't have the
[2:10:07] hall Beggars or hershbergers over here
[2:10:09] and this one over there and that one
[2:10:10] over here and they don't barely talk to
[2:10:12] each other I believe that's what he was
[2:10:14] talking about in other words don't get
[2:10:16] on to your little clicks isn't that
[2:10:18] right no Clicks in the church now we
[2:10:20] know that brother Donnie Reagan a lot of
[2:10:22] those churches no doubt they got their
[2:10:23] clicks can't help but help there's
[2:10:25] certain people that are going out with
[2:10:26] certain people to eat and they don't
[2:10:28] never even know the other people exist
[2:10:29] probably it's much harder to have
[2:10:31] everybody in unity like that you're
[2:10:33] going to have perhaps more than what you
[2:10:34] would in a small group
[2:10:36] amen
[2:10:38] but anyway okay so now notice
[2:10:42] so he says don't ever let's just make
[2:10:44] don't make yourself that way he says
[2:10:45] better man because we are one
[2:10:50] that's what I want to say how many
[2:10:51] please let's all say it we are one
[2:10:56] We Are One see the left hand can't say
[2:11:00] I'm mad at you I'm gonna take you away
[2:11:01] huh let's never think evil about one
[2:11:04] another or that the other person's evil
[2:11:06] let's not believe that because brother
[2:11:07] Brown says if the devil can get you to
[2:11:09] believe that her brother and sister is
[2:11:10] evil he's got you right there
[2:11:13] you won't have any confidence in them
[2:11:14] and so forth amen
[2:11:16] so you don't want to think that you
[2:11:18] always want to believe the best
[2:11:19] and now you've got tapes on that you've
[2:11:21] got tapes on what we believe you got
[2:11:23] tapes on discipline of the church
[2:11:25] amen how many glad that you can come
[2:11:27] into the house of God and you can sit
[2:11:29] and when not everybody's yelling and
[2:11:31] screaming and talking to each other
[2:11:32] everywhere you can something you can
[2:11:34] pray read your Bible or whatever he's
[2:11:35] got a discipline of the church and so
[2:11:37] forth oh my and I'm going to read this
[2:11:39] whole thing is that okay before we close
[2:11:41] I was going to close 10 minutes ago well
[2:11:44] not close but wind down
[2:11:46] we're still winding down
[2:11:48] now notice so he says
[2:11:50] you come here together to sit together
[2:11:52] in Heavenly places
[2:11:57] together
[2:11:59] tell me Tommy loves to come to church
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:03] is the best place you know you you do
[2:12:07] create a nice I'm sure that you fathers
[2:12:09] create a nice atmosphere in your home is
[2:12:11] that right
[2:12:12] you do probably but there's something
[2:12:14] about church when everything else is
[2:12:16] laid aside and the whole family comes
[2:12:18] together we sit still We Worship the
[2:12:20] Lord we praise the lord we amen
