other announcements remember micah he's not feeling the best i'm not either so let's just remember him in prayer amen and so amen just little different things going around i guess you know hopefully it ain't nothing serious for anybody but god's grace let's bow our heads and go into the word of god lord jesus we come before you once again lord thankful to be able to be assembled together in your name lord knowing that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you will be in our midst lord and father what an honor what a privilege it is to know that you are in our midst lord jesus

speak to our hearts once again help me to just say what you once said father as i yield myself to you lord bless each one father that's here lord jesus and those streaming tonight may you bless each and every one of them and just blessed brother tommy tonight also we want to remember him in his neck he's had a kink lord for about week or so and we just asked god that you would touch him touch micah lord jesus just the different ones that was mentioned lord jesus that are not feeling well we just ask god for a special touch form bless the reading of the word the opening of the bible now father we ask for the author to come down and give us the inspiration lord now to minister your word in jesus christ's name amen and amen and all the people said amen i know brother brother ted but sadly we'll be coming in lord willing this year again so i think he's going to take a wednesday night for us amen so that'll be coming up in the next couple of weeks amen again to our series amen so if you uh will turn your bibles again to the book of revelations the book of revelations how many remembers what we spoke on last time redeemer that's right on the redeemer aren't you glad for a redeemer amen we're so thankful for somebody that redeems now revelations and i want to go over some of the same scriptures again because we're amen on a on a little series amen and so we don't know i don't know how long i'll be on this we're just going to follow the leading of the spirit would that be okay amen i was listening brother brown he was talking about how that he was had the job on the ash sheep i guess for a longest time and he preached on a certain series over a year i guess it was a long time and he i never could get job off that ashy man so you know i'll remember the woman asking brother brandon when are you going to get job off the ash sheep so he must have got a lot out of that ash sheep amen well i think kind of most of us know what that place is like most of us have been there before amen all right so revelations one and verse 7-8 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen even so so be it right that's right i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty over in samuel ii samuel 22. i'm sorry not samuel exodus three exodus three and verse 13 and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say unto me what is his name what shall i say unto them and gets god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated once again with for a little while tonight i'd like to look at uh who god is is that all right and just who god is now tonight we want to speak on the subject and i want to read this scripture yet a couple more scriptures if i might in colossians 1 verse 16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things now notice there notice it says he is right that's the same meaning as i am right before all things were he was that's why i can always say i am yeah i am it's to if you would just to think naturally speaking you'd kind of think of it as a strange name you know if i ask you what's your name you'd say i am well i am too now what's your name right we all are right but that's what he called himself god called himself the i am amen i don't know if i do but just that very thought does something for me now you know because with god ain't nothing shallow right but god ain't nothing shallow it's it's deep and that you know and i and we read over there where it says in revelations he says uh i am he which was and which is and which is to come now what does that mean that means that he is the past he's the future and he's the present he's the past he's the present he's the future amen that's what he is he's everything that ever was he's everything that he is he is everything that is to come he's the future and it doesn't matter when the future comes he'll still be the i am of the future he'll say i am i told you i was you know he's always the i am whether it's in the past the future you see i am amen now we know that everything that was created now i've read that i i didn't have it here right here but the one thing i believe that one of the things that this message the prophet of the hour brought out to us that we didn't really believe or know before and i i don't i i don't understand it i just know the word says it so my mind has to conform to what it says and i can show you in scriptures there where he says behold he says he says i create these things and then it cleanly says i create evil that's what he said i create evil huh a little bit hard for us to imagine right but that's what it says i create evil there was nothing according to scripture there's nothing made that was made true right absolutely nothing could have been could be unless he created it and you don't have to understand it you just got to believe it amen all right we'll leave that alone for now but so we see here that everything that was made he is all of the past he's the present he's the future what that tells me is that he is and always will be and always has been he is what was that it means that he is forever he is eternal so that gives you a smile because why how many knows that you are but if you don't get to be part of the one that is eternal they'll be kind when you're not there come a time when you will cease to exist that's called losing your soul all right that's the worst thing that can ever happen to anybody is for them to what lose their so you will be lost in other words gone forever and i can't help but think that when people are in hell being punished for their sins one of the worst things is that they're going to realize is that they're going to cease to exist huh that's right they're going to come to an end now most churches most people most denominations and especially where i come from one thing they believe is that hell is eternal all right they believe that you're gonna burn that's right you're gonna sizzle burn what water is gonna be in fire far eternity if that don't scare the liver out of you i don't know what will if that don't try to make people do right i don't know what will no break [Music] never no end that's what they believe in that the truth how many knows that's what most people out there believe that it's eternal but we find out that it doesn't go with all the scriptures amen because it talks about he that is part of the first resurrection cannot be touched by the second death right the soul that sinneth it shall surely die that's right amen and so even in a natural st natural sense people can do things that will earn them 10 20 lifetimes in prison right or one lifetime in prison or so long in prison according to what they do but they do have a limit on it there is a time limit right [Applause] amen don't you just love the way that people have compromised on uh life terms life terms ain't no life terms anymore you ain't in prison for life you're only there for 20 years well if you live to be 60 you can live another 40 years after you're out of jail you know it's not life they call 20 years i guess you find that wrong right it's just a certain amount of time and then you can get out on good behavior perhaps oh my anyway let's not go down there amen so tonight what i want to want to deal with with the help of the lord for just a little while is the next scripture it's found in ephesians 4 and 6. no it's not my forgive me now let me look where this is i've got so many scriptures a lot of times that and i'm praying and looking at others i don't get them lined up the way that i want to here's 116 and then i have another one colossians 3 11 okay colossians 3. eleven there it is this will be our thought where there is neither greek well let me go back to verse 10 so we can understand what we're talking about and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him all right where now notice where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian thin born nor free but christ is all and in all all in all amen so that's what we're going to talk about tonight with the help god is all and in all whoo how he believes that uh over in colossians i believe it was it says that he is the head of the body colossians 2 1 and verse 18. he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen that he meant all things he might be over in revelations to scripture we all like real well they worshipped him because she they said thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created how many knows everything was created for his pleasure everything folks oh my was created for his purpose for his reason in other words nobody's gonna get the advantage and change the plan the plan's not going to get changed everything was created by him and for him praise be to god amen and he is all and he is in oh let me read you a couple stories some time ago a man was on his road to the seaside and he was going over there for a rest and he wanted to refresh himself because he loved the thought that he would hear the seagulls as they flew over the water and skipped down by the great white-tipped waves as they roared and bursted in the air he wanted to smell the salt water he said it'll be such a rest to live by the seashore for a while i just want to rest i want to live by the seashore and see all the things that she has to offer the blue skies as it reflects from the sky to the water how the foam of the salt water will boil up to the great waves strike and roll and he said if i can just stand and look at that and hear the scream of the gall those of us who likes to go to the beach can know what i'm talking about here amen get on one of the uh i hate gravity chairs and just lay back right those wave rolling and the seagull screaming and all of that if you hear it long enough you can actually sleep under all of that and just rest wake up with the sunburn or whatever but yeah listen so he wanted to go there and just rest on his road down okay he says and on his road down to the seashore he met a man coming and he was an old salt an old sailor from disease says where goes thou and he says i go down to the seesaw to enjoy the goodness of the sea the old saul said i don't see nothing strange about it the waters are just waters the skies just the sky the gaul is just another bird you see he had seen it so much until it had just become common to him it wasn't thrilling to him anymore and brother bams that's the way the church has gotten about god amen that's the way the people have gotten to where god is all around amen how many i don't know this is one thing that i really enjoy and that i really get and that is whenever i see a beautiful sunset or beautiful clouds even right i mean beautiful and i just say lord thank you jesus for painting me such a beautiful picture huh or maybe he's the best greatest artist that i have ever seen and just as the sun goes down it isn't just a stationary picture on the wall it is evolving all the time sometimes it'll get greater sometimes it'll diminish huh man he'll have he'll have eagles up there he'll have all kinds of different you know how many know that people have seen the clouds and it looks like an angel up there and they'll take a picture and it looks like an angel or jesus returning and all kinds of things that god will paint but people don't even realize it oh that's just the sky that's just the cloud no that's god up there god is all around how many believe god is all around the old salt it had just become common to him that's the way it is with us that's the way it is with people on the world they just it's god everywhere but they just don't see him amen three stories i want to read here just to lay a foundation the next one is here not long ago a little boy going to sunday school down in our city and to a very prominent church he heard so much about god till he said to his mama mom i want to ask you something could some could anybody see god oh he's so great he said oh he's so great i'd like to know if somebody could see him why she said sonny ask your sunday school teacher so you asked the sunday school teacher she says well i don't know you better ask the pastor the pastor was coming home with them for lunch and he said pastor i want to ask you a question can anyone see god he said oh no of course not no man can see god no one can see him well the little fellow was disappointed and he used to stay down on the river near the ohio river he used to go down there with an old fisherman up there on the river a piece towards the six mile island fishing all the time and one day after a big rain along this time of the year he was coming pulling down through those waters you know and anybody any boatman knows the music is after rain is over and a little bitty waves on the water and you let your oars clip across it as you pull pulling your boat and it was clipping along like that and the old fisherman had a long white beard he began to look over his shoulder and where the sun come out and the rain had been and made a rainbow and he pulled ours you know and he turned around and looked and the little fellows noticed here stripping from the old white man's beard as he dropped down and he pulled a little further and he looked back an older little boy he got he was sitting by the bow of the boat so he ran up there towards the stern of the boat and he said sir i'm going to ask you a question that my mother couldn't answer my sunday school teaching teacher couldn't answer or my pastor he said god is so great said can anyone see him and the old fisherman pulled his oars into his lap throwed his hands to his face like that and wept out grabbed the little fellow and hugged him amen and said god bless your little heart honey amen what does that tell you first of all it tells you this man was sensitive this man had feeling when the boy asked him just a simple question it caused the old man to burst into tears and weep why because the boy touched the nerve he asked him a question that meant a lot to the old man amen it goes to show something he said bless your heart honey all i've seen for the past 30 years has been god amen there's so much god on the inside you can see him on the outside if he gets on the inside amen how many believes that the old fellow just oh so full of god in here everything he looked at he seen god in it you've got to get god in here in order to have god and to see god on the outside amen praise be to god how many believes that brother branham the same way amen makes a statement that he was up way out west one time i think he was way out talked about being 30 miles away from from civilization or whatever take his horse and so forth go away back and i watched the sun setting over here in oregon across the way there's a great big eye and then the clouds formed a certain way and the sun came out pretty eyes sitting through there and i thought that's right his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me i mean he knows brother random is full of god all people wanted to say you don't know the word very well you don't know the bible very well but one thing brother branham could say is but i know the author real well that's right how many knows that he knew the author real well he was very foolish to come up against him because you come up against god amen all right so notice you can see listen and i know he watches me he says you can see god anywhere if you'll just look around amen he's all around you everywhere and then what we said he is all and in all he's in everything amen now we know that he isn't in hearts that are black and so forth but in everything that is god lay and created by him he's in it doesn't matter what it is do you realize that you if you really have a lot of god in your heart you can have you as a dancing fit jubilee over a blade of grass [Laughter] boy you might look dumb if you had a blade of grass and you was doing a jig and hallelujah praise be to god they can go to the moon and they can go to the stars and they can have a space program but they can't figure out what makes this little little old blade of grass live they can't figure it out but i know what makes it live you know what makes it live god is what makes it live amen and god is in that blade of grass amen i mean believe that he's in all of that you just have to be able to see him praise be to god oh my then i happen to look well wait a minute let me finish this quote he's all around you everywhere he's in flowers he's in nature everywhere i see him there [Applause] and i happened to look and i heard now notice he heard one place he's called to the wolf no coyote hollering up the hill there amen right right that's right oh we hear him down and i holler all the time i like to get my mind millimeter go out the backyard [Music] eat that up the holler for a little bit we don't like coyotes too much we're missing way too many chickens that's right but anyway but what was it one calls here isn't it something better man preaching on the deep cause of the deep he was preaching on life he was talking about how that you know that you know you can hear it i can hear it out there at my place man i'll tell you what if one goes across the road way over there and he begins to yipping or whatever all of a sudden down in the hall away over there something that lands back huh i mean they know each other's call they know the sound and i guarantee you they probably know each other well enough that they know whether it's the alpha or the next to the alpha or whatever dog it is or coyote it is they know which one they know all of them huh and i'll tell you what you can sound like a cow you won't get no answer you might get your cow to answer it why but it has to be the right sound that's why jesus said my sheep know my voice in a stranger's voice they will not follow what did he see in the coyote of the world what did he hear he heard a absolute ingenious creator design in that animal kingdom right something that god had put it there it might sound weird and strange my wife still say look that ain't no coyote you don't sound like that because they can make some really weird sounds folks you can almost make sound like like a baby screamer and crying or whatever but no they're just talking their language anyway think about it it's all unique another random heard that oh my he could hear god in the coyote his mate answered him back down in the bottom now oh my you talk about the deep calling to the deep hear the squall of the coyote or timberwolf that just sets my soul aflame i hear him over here hollering he lost his mate perhaps through the storm and she answered him way down over here in the bottoms and i thought oh god i gotta make two now call and he'll answer me one of these days oh god there you are amen how many likes to see god you can see god all around folks if you don't see god you need to look harder one place brother man preached on god in his universe god in his uh nature god in his word and god in his people only god is in his people it's not easy it's not hard to see god in one another amen how many believes that it's not hard to see i'll get to that here in a minute but no not notice oh my i heard the bugle of the elk that i was trying to catch up with big old male elk he let a long bugle out and i ain't gonna sound like that we're in the pulpit after all no not really but anyway listen big old bugle [Music] i like the sound i practiced a long time on my whoa and i'm keeping it down i was like but now my oh my i like that that call it sounds masculine it sounds like you he's big bad and mean but you know what they say you don't want to use that too much what you want to use is this little cow call that just says this little some kind of i can't make the sound but just little little call for the cow because you know you want to make the cow sound make the people think that it's a cow but just the different things listen he said you heard that great elk bugle the storm had separated the elk up there on high he had lost his hurt and he was calling to them i thought oh god you live up here amen i remember long time ago i was watching something about people who live out there in the woods maybe in russia or something they lived out there for as long as longest time and one thing one thing they said was this out here has a way of purifying you this out here purifies you i believe it i believe it does because god is out there there's no city there's no sin and wickedness out there everything's pure hey and you learn to pray the bear don't bite you and eat you and pray for your food and you just get close to god you may not believe it that's a way of being pure because god is out there you live out here that's right here you are and there he was in the elk herd there he was in the call of the wolf then they went on to talk about seeing that spine squirrel and seeing the uh the great big old eagle that was down the beautiful eagle and so forth and after brother branham heard the elk the uh the uh the elk bugle and the coyote scream and so forth you're almighty god so overjoyed he went to dancing around the tree there was a hollering and screaming he said man if somebody would have heard me then he said you got a maniac out here i mean he's acting like a maniac lately why because you've seen god so much you hear god so much until it overjoys you but you got to have him where in here how many knows to learn this if you want to see him anywhere outside see him in here how many knows it's so easy when you got the holy ghost and somebody does a kind deed for you do something good for you have a little kindness i mean is that so wonderful you can see christ in kindness be kindly affectionate one to another by the bible says it doesn't say be rude huh be gentle or be rough no gentleness oh my i tell you what my boss should have fired me for that but he's patient with me huh you see him in patience you see him in long suffering you see him into gentleness in people right you see him in meekness instead of pride somebody walking around with their chest all out they don't can't even wave to you or say hi to you huh then you know that there's something not right there amen pride come from god but meekness does kindness does love comes from god patience long suffering you're not short huh you're not just real short with people but you're long suffering amen i believe brother brad touched on that forgiveness i broke down here how many knows god is in forgiveness and the way that we forgiving one another the bible and as christ has forgiven you so i want you to forgive your those who trespass against you amen oh my i'll tell you right now i've seen that displayed and it's displayed in everybody we want to see god listen to somebody say look i'm sorry about this sorry i did this i shouldn't have done that that's god why because it takes god to humble somebody enough to say i'm sorry or i'm wrong sorry i was wrong folks them things it takes a lot of holy ghost for people to be able to say that brother i was wrong most of us most of us we don't even want to acknowledge or don't see it if it isn't for the holy ghost but forgiveness amen kindness on the other hand if somebody holds a grudge you know that isn't god amen but he is in everything he is all and he is all i wrote down here teaching on creation this is the way he ought to teach it that god created everything and he is in his creation you can see it in the oak tree in every kind of plant [Applause] you can see god actually well brother branham said that people that are trying to disprove disprove their own theory about evolution and they'll mix this corn with this and and they can hybrid it can mix and become something else but it can't never breed back so it proves no you got to stay with the original if you're going to have anything that reproduces itself amen you can see it in the trees you can see in nature you can see it in every aspect you can see god if you want to look and see for him because he's there you can see him in his people we can see it in one another how many believe that and we can certainly see it in his word i don't believe we can see god in his word he's he is all and he is in all you just have to look a little harder god help us amen praise the lord all right let's get started because i've got several things here i wrote down that i want to touch on with the help of the lord because when you talk about he's all and in all well there's hardly any place to start than any place to stop so let me just put this here this is one of donna's wall hangings amen another one she's got like this that has uh i believe the seven church ages there revelations on all of that amen so i thank god for a a wife that loves the lord and loves to hang stuff like this on the wall and he shall be called now i'm just going to go through this is that all right and then over until maybe springtime i don't know if it'll take that long but we'll go through some of these he's the advocate according to 1st john 2 and 1. we have an advocate if any man sin

resurrection things that we could go a long way on he is and i am he is i am the resurrection and the life amen praise be to god how many glad for the holy ghost i'm just glad to be alive spiritually

trespasses as he quickened made alive means a lot to us don't it how many knows he's the chief shepherd i'm a shepherd but he's the chief shepherd he's the chief shepherd and bishop of our souls according to first peter he's of course the judge how many knows he's the judge he's the lord of lords he's the rock hmm hey man i wanna i've got something wrote down let me just stop there for a second i've got it wrote down here when i was writing down about him being the rock i thought you know it's like going like i was going down on a sea of life no pilot to guide me soul loose drifting on the sea of life heading towards the niagara fall actually just going down towards niagara fall with no you know i had a boat i had a rope and i had an anchor right but i was just coasting maybe i threw out my anchor i pray god i need saving i remember when i did it lord i need saving i need help i don't know what to believe or whatever but i know you are and praying and so forth and i didn't know which way to go and i could tell you a long story about different things that i tried and different religions i tested this out or the other but but it just seemed like the anchor anchor doesn't do you any good if you're hitting the bottom and all it is is sand i mean there's a current it's going to just drag you right along we're heading right for the fall man if you die tomorrow without god you're done forever right but it was just nothing there but the water was really clear and i was heading down towards that fall and i looked and i see my anchor drag you know i don't know what to do i don't know what to do right because god had placed something in my heart a hunger for god i was a ship i was a boat i'm a person i'm a human i'm so drifting on the sea but it doesn't do any good if you just got sand on the bottom you need something for it to grab a hold of it how many knows an anchor comes down here like this and has a y like a hook here right hook here and hook there that's not made to catch sand it's made to catch a hard object that's connected to the bottom and it's called the rock all right he's a rock that's another thing he is he's a rock in the weary land oh jesus is a rock in a weary land a weary land are we relent right and as i was going i see this rock because i could see i know that's a rock but guess what that anchor needed to grab that rock am i right amen as i went over it like watch them oh i pray god do something save me i can't save myself you know and you might have tried this and tried that and man you know you just can't do anything without christ and sure enough by god's grace even as i went past it i couldn't look under there but all of a sudden i felt something tug and jerk my boat whoa right folks i don't know about you but that's shaking and that tugging and that jerk is the best thing that ever happened in my life because i knew that i wasn't coasting anymore there was some resistance to me heading towards the fall oh my aren't you glad folks your daddy can't do it your mama can't do it every individual has to have that personal experience and revelation of catching that anchor on the rock rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee amen it gripped praise the lord [Music] amen it gripped that rock that was there and it held and it jerked and it saved my life praise be to god aren't you glad for that amen like the song says you wanna you know because a lot of people have chills that have experiences in church and chills run down their spine and oh they'll just shake and everything else you know and praise the lord but the next day they're about they're doing the same thing they did before huh they're just you know they're just grabbing a hold of small stones or something and getting a little jerk that's about all they get but bibles or the song says be very sure be sure be very sure your anger holds and grips the solid rock amen how many is left that your heart grip the solid rock amen oh my i feel
