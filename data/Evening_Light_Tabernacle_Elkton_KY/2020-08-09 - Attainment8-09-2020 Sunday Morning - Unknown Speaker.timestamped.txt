[38:01] and so they're trying to get you know
[38:03] get them to where they actually have a
[38:04] bible so that's good isn't it
[38:06] and then also there's a lot of
[38:08] translation at this time he says there's
[38:10] a whole lot of translation going on
[38:12] of the message into their language so
[38:14] that's wonderful
[38:16] so instead of building buildings right
[38:18] now i guess so that'll be all
[38:20] that's all good it's getting the word
[38:21] out there and that right
[38:23] so it's just really wonderful i believe
[38:25] that
[38:26] uh you know bram said you can never go
[38:29] wrong doing missionary work so we want
[38:31] to take our middle
[38:32] of the year i guess we'll take one
[38:34] offering here at the middle of the year
[38:35] and we'll think about
[38:36] first of december maybe taking another
[38:39] one either
[38:40] december or january but anyway
[38:44] i think next sunday if it's all right
[38:45] with everybody we'll take our middle of
[38:47] the year
[38:47] a missionary another missionary offering
[38:50] and i told uh
[38:52] the deacons and everybody i said that i
[38:55] talked uh text a little bit back and
[38:57] forth with brother daryl
[38:59] and so either this may get to him but
[39:02] that's all right
[39:03] um but anyway he's not been been able to
[39:06] minister and he doesn't have a secondary
[39:08] job and all so
[39:09] he said just pray for me he said you
[39:11] know it's you know you can't preach with
[39:13] this corona
[39:14] and so forth you know he's had that for
[39:16] the last little while and
[39:18] so we want to take portion of that if
[39:19] it's okay and give it to him would that
[39:21] be all right
[39:22] let's try to help brother darrell out
[39:23] amen because he's certainly a real man
[39:25] of god and
[39:26] amen so we'll take a portion of that
[39:28] next week amen
[39:30] and and do that with that so and also i
[39:34] think that john me and john talked about
[39:35] having youth meetings or whatever so
[39:37] maybe that's on a small scale but
[39:39] after the last few weeks i don't think
[39:40] we'll do anything as far as youth this
[39:42] year okay
[39:43] because it's really getting or getting
[39:46] around in it
[39:47] amen i'll tell you what my heart goes
[39:49] out to people amen like
[39:51] i didn't even know brother bruce and
[39:52] them had it amen but uh amen these are
[39:56] certainly perilous times that we're
[39:58] living in isn't it
[39:59] perilous times we're living in and this
[40:02] pandemic
[40:03] i know you know it's all over the world
[40:05] amen
[40:06] not just here in the united states but
[40:07] it's everywhere so
[40:09] but we are thankful that i guess the
[40:11] actual mortality rate of it all is down
[40:13] so that's good
[40:15] all infections i guess and so forth is
[40:17] up mortality rates are down so that's a
[40:19] good thing at least
[40:20] in our state so the way i see it
[40:24] uh you know right now is worse than it
[40:26] was here
[40:27] last round that we actually shut down
[40:28] church for a couple of months
[40:31] and so uh we do know that it's all
[40:35] around us and
[40:36] now we can certainly see see it a lot
[40:38] more so i know there's different ones
[40:40] you know
[40:41] that are working at the nursing home so
[40:44] if
[40:44] anybody is working if you're working
[40:46] with people that have covet and so forth
[40:48] and you chose
[40:49] you choose to just stay home and we
[40:52] would probably prefer you did
[40:56] to just stay home and stream if you have
[40:58] direct contact with somebody like that
[40:59] because
[41:00] you could easily be a carrier and we
[41:02] know that if it gets on one and amongst
[41:04] a group like this it can spread pretty
[41:06] fast so we want to try to avoid that we
[41:08] want to take whatever precautionary
[41:09] measures that we possibly can okay
[41:12] and so i don't know if brother steve has
[41:13] talked to you this morning did did you
[41:15] say anything to anybody where's brother
[41:17] steve at
[41:18] oh there you are okay you talked to
[41:22] everybody at the door to try to keep the
[41:23] distant thing thing
[41:25] amen so that's very good let's keep that
[41:27] up and i see that we have certainly
[41:31] had some way back up there brother tommy
[41:33] tammy good to see y'all way back there
[41:36] amen praise the lord it's all right to
[41:38] go out there but
[41:39] i don't have corona so we do have a few
[41:41] empty seats out here in the front but
[41:43] that's all right too it don't bother me
[41:45] one way or the other but amen it's kind
[41:48] of different up there
[41:49] ain't it and pretty neat i'll tell you
[41:51] what the balcony is a pretty neat place
[41:53] amen it's pretty cool so praise the lord
[41:56] but anyway so
[41:57] um let me think of anything else so
[42:00] let's just all be
[42:01] careful all right and we'll pray for
[42:03] those that uh
[42:04] certainly for uh i think sister joyce
[42:07] and
[42:08] hannah i think they work at the nursing
[42:10] home and so forth so we'll remember them
[42:12] in prayer because we
[42:13] they we don't want them to catch it amen
[42:15] and they do help people that are
[42:17] infected by it so that's a real
[42:18] sacrifice and a real
[42:20] uh patriot on their part i believe to
[42:23] help people like that and so we'll
[42:24] continue to remember them in prayer
[42:27] amen and so but we'll continue on
[42:31] i don't believe that it's a time to stop
[42:33] uh
[42:34] amen i believe that we need to keep
[42:36] continuing on amen
[42:38] and just trust the lord in everything
[42:40] and serve him
[42:42] and just take what precautions that we
[42:44] can and we are certainly in the lord's
[42:46] hands and trust him
[42:48] life or death we are in his hands and
[42:50] trust our lord and savior
[42:52] and we're so grateful to have a god like
[42:54] what we do
[42:55] amen so praise the lord certainly um
[42:59] i really appreciate the lord and what
[43:02] he's been
[43:03] saying to us and speaking to us amen and
[43:05] we appreciate your prayers
[43:07] amen because i realize amen
[43:11] that this place right here is a very
[43:14] sacred place
[43:15] very very important and very um
[43:18] very sacred and a big responsibility
[43:21] amen to stand behind the pulpit here
[43:24] amen and to speak to god's people and to
[43:26] lead god's people
[43:27] and to influence you in the right
[43:29] direction and to have the inspiration of
[43:31] the holy spirit
[43:32] to lead the church in the way that we
[43:34] should go how many believes that's
[43:35] important
[43:36] so we do covet your prayers we thank you
[43:38] for your prayers and we we thank the
[43:40] lord jesus that
[43:42] i feel like the messages that i received
[43:44] from him
[43:46] amen it's just
[43:49] i just want to say that it just comes
[43:51] seems to come perhaps i listen better
[43:54] amen than what i used to but it just
[43:55] seems to come a little easier than what
[43:57] it used to
[43:58] and so i thank god for quickening his
[44:00] word to us amen
[44:03] um any other announcements that anybody
[44:05] can think of
[44:08] amen just want to say we appreciate each
[44:09] and everybody and we will
[44:12] certainly keep different ones on our
[44:14] prayer list like whether
[44:16] uh the tit bells of course only knows
[44:18] them by the bruce and them
[44:20] then brother jewel forney how many
[44:23] remember continue to remember brother
[44:24] jewel forney
[44:25] he and uh just quite a few different
[44:28] people that we need to just remember
[44:30] we need to post with don if you'll
[44:32] remember we need to do
[44:34] a little bit more make sure we get some
[44:35] of these things posted and then
[44:37] sister jeanette that was kind of a shock
[44:39] finding out that even she's
[44:41] they found something down in her that
[44:44] they're gonna get and find out just what
[44:45] it is
[44:46] but we're trusting the lord that all
[44:48] will be well amen and then for sister
[44:50] susan
[44:51] these are all very uh real needs
[44:54] amen and we trust the lord we'll do a
[44:56] miracle for her
[44:57] amen and that this will get rid of that
[45:01] cancer that it'll be rebuked in jesus
[45:03] name and that shall live a full life
[45:05] amen because we know that when satan
[45:07] does something like that we have a place
[45:08] that we can go to
[45:10] and claim our victory amen
[45:13] so we know that god still does amen how
[45:15] many believes he's still
[45:16] real he's still a healer he's still a
[45:19] deliverer
[45:20] and we appreciate god amen for who he is
[45:24] so before we start i'll just tell you
[45:27] where my inspiration come as i was
[45:29] praying and
[45:30] asking the lord what to speak on this
[45:32] morning
[45:34] and that scripture came to me to seek
[45:37] the lord
[45:38] while he may be found amen from there
[45:42] we'll just go and see what the lord will
[45:43] have for is that okay so stand with me
[45:45] we'll go before the lord in prayer
[45:50] kind heavenly father as we approach your
[45:52] throne of grace once again lord
[45:55] and our hearts and our minds we just
[45:58] can't thank you enough
[45:59] for the right to be able to approach
[46:02] your throne
[46:03] father to be able to speak to you
[46:05] directly lord jesus
[46:07] father having a clear channel between us
[46:10] and you to be able to speak father and
[46:12] for you to speak back lord we thank you
[46:15] for calvary having made this possible
[46:17] for us lord
[46:18] for what you have done lord jesus that
[46:20] you have bridged the gap between god and
[46:22] man
[46:23] and now lord jesus we're back in
[46:25] fellowship with you we're back
[46:28] in being led by the holy spirit like
[46:30] adam was
[46:31] before the fall having every right that
[46:34] he had before the fall father and lord
[46:36] jesus we ask god as we look at these
[46:38] different rights and the things that you
[46:40] have given us lord and father the
[46:42] privileges that you have given us lord
[46:44] the opportunities that you have given us
[46:46] father
[46:46] and this morning we want to take and
[46:48] speak about taking advantage
[46:50] of those opportunities and those
[46:53] privileges
[46:54] we ask god for your inspiration for your
[46:56] ability and that you would just say
[46:58] whatever you once said this morning
[46:59] father
[47:00] and lord as your people have gathered in
[47:02] your name we believe god that you
[47:04] are in our midst this morning we believe
[47:07] that you are here
[47:08] we ask god for all of these requests
[47:11] lord this morning that has already been
[47:13] mentioned father
[47:14] that you would go to each and every
[47:16] individual and grant them the faith to
[47:17] be able to overcome lord jesus
[47:20] and father to have complete victory and
[47:22] joy in their lives lord
[47:24] father we ask god not to just bless the
[47:26] opening of the word
[47:27] the reading of the word the meditation
[47:29] of our heart our gathering together in
[47:30] your name
[47:31] we ask it in jesus name amen and amen
[47:35] let's turn first to first corinthians
[47:41] first corinthians
[47:48] and i want to talk about and i'll title
[47:50] this this morning
[47:51] obtainment obtainment
[47:58] in first corinthians the ninth chapter
[48:08] and verse 24 know ye not the day which
[48:13] run
[48:13] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[48:17] prize
[48:18] so run that you may obtain
[48:22] remember we're talking about obtainment
[48:25] and every man that striveth for the
[48:27] mastery is temperate
[48:28] in all things now they do it to obtain a
[48:31] corruptable crown
[48:32] but we an incorruptible i therefore so
[48:35] run not as uncertainty so fight i
[48:39] we're going to talk about running we're
[48:40] going to talk about fighting this
[48:42] morning
[48:43] not as one that beateth the air but i
[48:46] keep under my body and bring it
[48:47] into subjection least that by any means
[48:51] when i have preached to others i myself
[48:53] should be a cast away
[48:56] over in isaiah 55
[49:01] this is the scripture that came to me
[49:03] when i began to think about this message
[49:05] and
[49:05] when the lord began to just kind of pour
[49:07] out
[49:09] the message to me
[49:14] and wednesday night we talked about
[49:17] being privileged what kind of uh how
[49:20] privileged the people that we are amen
[49:24] so this morning we want to talk about
[49:26] taking advantage
[49:27] of those privileges taking advantages of
[49:31] those privileges it'll also go along
[49:34] with what we have talked about how a few
[49:36] sundays or wednesdays ago when i used
[49:38] the latter for an
[49:39] illustration amen it'll kind of go along
[49:42] with that also
[49:45] isaiah 55
[49:49] isaiah 55
[49:52] and we'll just read one verse there seek
[49:55] ye the lord
[49:56] while he may be found call upon him
[49:59] while he is near
[50:03] let's go to another scripture yet in
[50:04] first chapter of proverbs
[50:07] chapter 1 of proverbs
[50:23] verse 23. turn ye
[50:26] at my reproof behold i will pour out my
[50:28] spirit unto you i will make known my
[50:30] words unto you
[50:32] because i have called and he refused i
[50:34] have stretched out my hand
[50:36] and no man regarded but ye have set at
[50:39] not
[50:40] all my counsel and with none of my
[50:42] reproof
[50:43] i also will laugh at your calamity i
[50:45] will mock when your fear cometh
[50:47] and when your fear cometh as destruction
[50:50] and your destruction cometh as a
[50:52] whirlwind
[50:54] when distress and anguish cometh upon
[50:56] you then shall they call
[50:58] upon me but i will not answer they shall
[51:01] seek me early
[51:03] but they shall not find me for that they
[51:06] hated knowledge and did not choose the
[51:08] fear of the lord
[51:10] they would none of my counsel they
[51:11] despised all my reproof
[51:14] therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
[51:16] their own way and be filled with their
[51:18] own devices
[51:20] for the turning away of the simple shall
[51:22] slay them
[51:24] and the prosperity of fools shall
[51:25] destroy them but whoso hearkeneth unto
[51:28] me
[51:28] shall dwell safely
[51:32] and should be quiet from all fear
[51:35] of evil may god had his blessings to
[51:38] reading the words you can be seated this
[51:40] morning
[51:41] isn't that a wonderful wonderful
[51:43] scripture
[51:45] amen
[51:48] you know there's a lot of scriptures
[51:50] that talk about seeking the lord
[51:52] amen seeking his face
[51:56] you know you might wonder but the lord
[51:58] does like for us to
[52:00] seek him
[52:04] and it's a real privilege that if you
[52:07] ever get away from the lord
[52:10] if you ever stray away from the lord one
[52:13] of the first things
[52:14] that has to happen is you have to begin
[52:16] to set your heart
[52:18] your heart has to change something has
[52:20] to turn in your heart now right
[52:23] something has to tell you you know i
[52:24] don't like the direction that i'm going
[52:26] here
[52:27] i don't like the way that i am i want to
[52:30] go in a different direction because from
[52:32] the heart
[52:33] it goes to the mind and from your mind
[52:36] you begin to turn around and you begin
[52:38] to repent you begin to go a different
[52:40] direction
[52:41] amen and then you begin to seek the lord
[52:43] and you begin to talk and you begin to
[52:45] realize
[52:46] where you're at and so forth and
[52:49] you know and it changes your whole
[52:52] course of your life
[52:55] amen and he i like that because he says
[52:59] you know seek me
[53:01] while i may be found there's another
[53:04] scripture in matthew the seventh
[53:06] chapter verse
[53:11] 7 matthew 7 70 says ask
[53:15] and it shall be given unto you seek
[53:20] and ye shall find knock
[53:23] and it shall be opened unto you
[53:27] praise the lord is that right think
[53:29] about it that's the promise of god
[53:33] oh my when i think about what malachi
[53:37] 4 what our prophet taught us
[53:41] just the thought that he taught
[53:44] this one thing and that was that
[53:48] whenever you get born again and by
[53:51] the way of calvary by what jesus did for
[53:53] us on calvary
[53:56] we are supposed to and have access to
[54:00] being in the same condition
[54:03] as adam was before the fall
[54:07] all right amen except
[54:10] for this physical body amen how many of
[54:14] those we're still looking for that to
[54:16] happen
[54:17] a body change but talking about
[54:20] inferior complexes talking about fear
[54:24] period talking about all of those things
[54:27] that came upon
[54:28] adam as a result of his sin that is
[54:31] all supposed to be taken away from you
[54:35] and from
[54:35] me now how many know that's a big
[54:37] mouthful we already said this morning
[54:40] that we're supposed to be in the same
[54:41] condition that adam was before the fall
[54:48] in other words we're supposed to be able
[54:50] to walk in the cool of the day
[54:52] and talk to the lord and have fellowship
[54:55] with the lord
[54:58] amen i have i don't know but you might
[55:01] want to practice this amen but
[55:03] perhaps when you're going through the
[55:04] day you know
[55:06] and and you're just good seeing the
[55:09] wonderful
[55:10] green trees out there and all your
[55:12] perhaps look up at the sunset perhaps
[55:15] you look at the
[55:16] clouds and the peculiar amen how that
[55:19] they're
[55:19] maybe a little different or beautiful or
[55:22] sometimes those clouds and those skies
[55:24] they'll become like
[55:25] a wavy ocean yeah i mean has ever seen
[55:28] them like that and
[55:29] you look up and you say wow what a
[55:31] beautiful picture
[55:33] and i believe every day that we ought to
[55:35] be so close to the lord that when we
[55:37] look at that and say lord
[55:38] father i sure am glad of how beautiful
[55:41] you made things
[55:43] and your creation of how i get to enjoy
[55:46] it and
[55:48] and you know i was thinking of just
[55:50] walking it
[55:51] just the other day and i was thinking of
[55:53] how i felt thanking the lord i was
[55:54] talking to him i said lord
[55:56] thank you for giving me the opportunity
[55:59] in this world of death and sorrow
[56:02] and sickness and where we're at how the
[56:04] world is but yet you gave me the
[56:06] opportunity
[56:07] to walk this walk amen to be young
[56:11] and to be getting old amen and to go
[56:14] through this life for the journey
[56:16] thank you lord for giving me the
[56:17] opportunity and help me lord to make the
[56:20] very
[56:21] best of it because i won't get to do
[56:24] this again
[56:25] you won't get to do this again
[56:28] dominique believes that we need to make
[56:31] the most of it
[56:32] we need to make the best of it we need
[56:35] to run
[56:36] this race with patience that set before
[56:39] us
[56:40] we need to live this life to its
[56:44] fullness
[56:49] i'm not sure where i have seen it
[56:50] somewhere i believe it was burt reynolds
[56:52] or one of those
[56:54] people i guess that's pastor it might
[56:56] have been johnny cash you know but they
[56:57] talked about
[56:58] he says you might waste a lot of things
[57:00] but he says if you
[57:02] waste time you have wasted everything
[57:06] huh why because you only have so much
[57:08] time and you realize as you get older
[57:11] you know you only got so many breaths
[57:13] you only got so much time
[57:16] and you don't need to waste it on the
[57:18] devil you don't need to waste it on the
[57:20] wrong things
[57:21] but you need to use it for the honor and
[57:24] glory of the lord because when we come
[57:26] down to that door of death there's only
[57:28] one thing that's going to matter
[57:30] and it isn't how many millions we have
[57:32] in the bank but it's going to make a
[57:33] difference of how we live for god
[57:35] it's the only difference it's going to
[57:36] make
[57:37] [Music]
[57:39] what kind of walk that we had what kind
[57:41] of life that we lived how did we act and
[57:44] how did we do
[57:45] and how did we treat people and what did
[57:47] people see
[57:48] us as huh
[57:51] are you with me this morning so paul
[57:54] he said let me run
[57:57] not with uncertainty
[58:01] not one that beateth the air but let's
[58:04] run to what
[58:08] to obtain
[58:11] to receive to make the goal
[58:18] amen now many believe we got a message
[58:21] that god has sent in this hour
[58:23] and that message and the word of god and
[58:25] what has been brought
[58:26] doesn't need any adding to it don't need
[58:29] perfecting
[58:32] huh no it's already perfect
[58:36] it's exactly what we have need of so
[58:39] there's only one thing left
[58:41] what is that that's for us to receive it
[58:47] to attain it to get it
[58:52] amen
[58:55] now i hope i'm talking to a perfect
[58:57] church this morning
[58:58] perfect individuals huh
[59:02] i hope i am be nice wouldn't it
[59:05] but the chances are we probably aren't
[59:09] but this one thing that i thought about
[59:11] this morning as i begin to
[59:13] i was i was thinking about the church
[59:14] and preaching this you know
[59:16] i do hope and pray that we will become
[59:20] a finely tuned
[59:23] church
[59:29] let's not be like a car that's running
[59:31] on three cylinders when it's got eight
[59:34] huh a bunch of skipping and
[59:38] missing huh how many wants to walk
[59:41] finely tuned with the lord
[59:44] amen so i got to thinking
[59:48] lord i begin to pour it out you know he
[59:51] said
[59:52] seek me wow
[59:56] i may be found because there'll come a
[59:59] time
[59:59] when people will want they'll desire
[1:00:03] but they won't be able to get to the
[1:00:05] lord how many please we're privileged
[1:00:07] people
[1:00:09] but you know it doesn't matter
[1:00:12] how privileged you are if you don't take
[1:00:15] advantage
[1:00:16] of that privilege
[1:00:22] all right shall we start
[1:00:26] for one thing that we seem to do one
[1:00:29] thing
[1:00:29] that we seem to do is
[1:00:33] that we're always seem to be looking
[1:00:35] back
[1:00:37] we human beings we have a tendency to
[1:00:39] have a spirit like a frog
[1:00:42] all right always looking back looking
[1:00:44] back
[1:00:47] even as preachers a lot of times now we
[1:00:49] know that faith comes by hearing
[1:00:51] hearing testimonies of the past right
[1:00:55] of what people have done of what they
[1:00:58] have attained of how they
[1:01:00] have uh you know possessed the promises
[1:01:04] of god how they were
[1:01:05] great people through the spirit of god
[1:01:10] amen now you take for
[1:01:14] example abraham lincoln you know when
[1:01:17] you say
[1:01:18] abraham lincoln
[1:01:24] in your mind you think about a man that
[1:01:25] was honest
[1:01:27] a man that fought for righteousness
[1:01:30] a man that fought to free the slaves
[1:01:33] isn't that right
[1:01:35] man that watched them be sold on those
[1:01:37] blocks up there
[1:01:38] and separate it and he says one day i'll
[1:01:41] hit that thing
[1:01:42] if it costs me my life it ain't right
[1:01:46] you realize it wasn't right
[1:01:47] am i right think about abraham because
[1:01:50] why
[1:01:51] that character went with abraham lincoln
[1:01:54] amen let me think back of george
[1:01:56] washington
[1:01:57] we think back of daniel and the lions
[1:02:00] then
[1:02:01] we look back at the three hebrew
[1:02:02] children
[1:02:04] we look back a lot of times at knox
[1:02:07] finney
[1:02:08] calvin we look back we have a tendency
[1:02:10] to look back
[1:02:13] amen when it comes to religion most
[1:02:16] churches
[1:02:17] are teaching a historical god or
[1:02:20] a historical religion or on a founder
[1:02:24] a man that led perhaps a movement
[1:02:28] many many many years ago such as martin
[1:02:31] luther john leslie even pentecost isn't
[1:02:33] that right
[1:02:35] and people have a tendency to look back
[1:02:37] but about him he says it this way
[1:02:40] in 55 he says listen
[1:02:43] he said i feel so bad today when people
[1:02:46] try to make god
[1:02:47] something in history
[1:02:50] i want to ask you something what good is
[1:02:53] he god of history
[1:02:55] if he isn't that same god today
[1:03:03] oh my what good is this bible
[1:03:06] if it's something from yesterday if it
[1:03:08] ain't the same today
[1:03:11] what is good is the god of moses if he
[1:03:14] isn't the same today
[1:03:18] amen oh my he is god today he's risen
[1:03:23] from the dead he's here to prove himself
[1:03:25] he's still the same god we talk about a
[1:03:28] historical god what's the matter tonight
[1:03:31] the church has been taught in some
[1:03:33] historical thing and not put it down to
[1:03:35] a present day
[1:03:37] what good is he god of elijah if he
[1:03:40] isn't god today
[1:03:44] what good has he got of moses that
[1:03:45] delivered the hebrew children
[1:03:47] and so forth what good is a god like
[1:03:49] that of history if he isn't the same
[1:03:51] tonight
[1:03:54] oh my what good is he god that walked
[1:03:57] the banks of galilee back younger open
[1:03:59] up the eyes of the blind made to death
[1:04:01] and the dumb to speak in the ear
[1:04:03] healed the sick the lepers raised the
[1:04:05] dead if he isn't the same god tonight
[1:04:08] what good
[1:04:08] is he hallelujah amen
[1:04:13] praise be to god that's right
[1:04:17] amen and notice how that even with
[1:04:20] moses's mother how many that moses's
[1:04:22] mother
[1:04:23] no doubt taught him the story
[1:04:27] of how that her and her husband had put
[1:04:30] him in that
[1:04:31] water in the nile amongst the crocodiles
[1:04:33] and had committed him to god and had
[1:04:35] seen that he was a special child
[1:04:37] and told the story of how that it
[1:04:39] floated down and pharaoh thought it
[1:04:41] fought this little
[1:04:42] hebrew child floating and she wanted a
[1:04:45] little baby so she snatched it out of
[1:04:47] the dial
[1:04:48] said i'm going to raise this as my own
[1:04:50] but i don't need a wet mother and so go
[1:04:52] get amongst the
[1:04:53] hebrew chip mothers amen and call a wet
[1:04:56] mother
[1:04:57] amen to give my child suck in the raisin
[1:05:00] amen and it went and got the very mother
[1:05:02] of the baby
[1:05:06] and that right told the story of the
[1:05:08] miraculous and how god had done
[1:05:10] amen and thought all these things were
[1:05:13] taught moses
[1:05:16] but let me ask you something one day he
[1:05:18] thought well maybe i am deliverer
[1:05:20] amen and she believed that he would be
[1:05:22] there to deliver your delivery you're
[1:05:23] the deliverer
[1:05:26] amen he and his carnal self believed his
[1:05:28] mama's testimony
[1:05:31] is that right but listen what i wanted
[1:05:34] the point that i want to make this
[1:05:36] morning is
[1:05:37] even your mom and dad sometimes we look
[1:05:39] back to what mama says
[1:05:41] we look back to what daddy says and the
[1:05:43] experience that they have
[1:05:45] but that doesn't do you do any good
[1:05:50] it didn't do moses one for the good.
[1:05:58] amen he thought in himself yeah i'm a
[1:05:59] deliverer and i this egyptians
[1:06:01] is beating this yeah this hebrew amen
[1:06:04] he took and he slew that egyptian right
[1:06:08] amen what he tried to do in himself
[1:06:10] turned out to be a massive
[1:06:12] failure
[1:06:16] and all of what he was going on as some
[1:06:19] previous experience
[1:06:20] or somebody else's experience turned out
[1:06:23] to be a total failure
[1:06:26] how many knows the seven sons of siva
[1:06:28] whenever they were trying to do what
[1:06:29] paul did
[1:06:30] amen trying to do the same thing it
[1:06:32] turned out to be a complete
[1:06:33] failure amen why
[1:06:37] because i want you to know this morning
[1:06:39] that when it comes to god
[1:06:41] when it comes to fiery furnaces when it
[1:06:43] comes to lions and the
[1:06:44] alliance dance and everything else you
[1:06:47] don't need somebody
[1:06:49] else's experience you've got to have
[1:06:51] that own experience
[1:06:54] you got to be able to say no my mom and
[1:06:56] my daddy you know they had an experience
[1:06:58] but i have my own experience i'll tell
[1:07:00] you
[1:07:00] this is what god did for me
[1:07:07] not a historical god of your parents
[1:07:10] even or your pastor or your church we
[1:07:13] always like to hear
[1:07:14] oh we hear these great testimonies of
[1:07:16] people
[1:07:18] but we are where are you at
[1:07:22] let me tell you something i truly
[1:07:24] believe
[1:07:26] oh my that now we are the shadrach
[1:07:30] meshach and abednego
[1:07:31] we are the daniels we are the esters
[1:07:37] for such a time as this stephen
[1:07:42] every one of us could should be able to
[1:07:44] say
[1:07:46] this layout to see a wretched satan's
[1:07:48] eating sin everywhere debauchery
[1:07:51] everywhere
[1:07:51] homosexual just a complete
[1:07:55] barrel of messy sin
[1:07:59] satan's eden can you imagine that's what
[1:08:02] the devil's eaten
[1:08:05] smoking drinking just everything you can
[1:08:07] imagine that's eepless wrong
[1:08:09] around us
[1:08:13] but we can say first like esther
[1:08:18] you know esther was a great woman
[1:08:19] remember right because she took up for
[1:08:22] the jews
[1:08:23] she stood up this was her time
[1:08:26] how many believes this is your time
[1:08:30] this is your time
[1:08:34] and for such a time as this thomas byler
[1:08:37] was born
[1:08:39] steven young this is your time
[1:08:42] this is your hour
[1:08:47] in the midst of a lukewarm lady
[1:08:51] rich and increase with goods have need
[1:08:54] of nothing
[1:08:56] think they have everything lukewarm
[1:08:59] halfway mediocrity
[1:09:02] kind of world church world
[1:09:06] huh god has called you to be on fire and
[1:09:09] to be hot
[1:09:11] for god not lukewarm
[1:09:14] not mediocre huh
[1:09:18] this is our time
[1:09:26] we talk about we say three hebrew drum

[1:09:32] that fire
[1:09:34] what do you do you is going to die
[1:09:37] daniel the same way
[1:09:38] we think he's such a hero when how how
[1:09:40] did you do it
[1:09:43] 68 million down through the dark ages
[1:09:46] how did you how could you walk into that
[1:09:48] arena
[1:09:48] and have them lions come towards you and
[1:09:51] tear you to pieces
[1:09:53] be thrust through with the sword all
[1:09:55] these things be burned into saying how
[1:09:57] could you do it
[1:09:58] your hero huh
[1:10:04] but i've heard before and i kind of tend
[1:10:06] to believe that
[1:10:08] on that day they'll come and ask us
[1:10:11] in the middle of that sin and that lust
[1:10:13] and that
[1:10:14] that temptation huh
[1:10:17] in the middle of of being able to get
[1:10:20] anything you want wherever you want and
[1:10:22] become whatever you want in the middle
[1:10:25] of all of that how did you survive
[1:10:28] how did you survive leonisia
[1:10:34] huh let's see how many beliefs it's our
[1:10:38] time
[1:10:42] amen how many knows that god don't have
[1:10:46] any grandchildren
[1:10:49] in other words well my mama my daddy's a
[1:10:52] pastor he's a preacher
[1:10:54] when you get out there guys i'm going to
[1:10:56] say oh you're the preacher's son yeah
[1:10:58] come on
[1:10:58] in
[1:11:01] huh how many does it don't work that way
[1:11:05] god don't have grandchildren you can't
[1:11:08] go by the experience of your pastor
[1:11:10] or your mama your daddy you have to have
[1:11:14] your own experience
[1:11:16] it has to be real to you
[1:11:21] young people or it'll never hold
[1:11:26] it'll never hold somewhere down the road
[1:11:28] your colors will show
[1:11:31] as a matter of fact as a pastor i can
[1:11:34] tell you i can preach you
[1:11:35] everything that you need to know huh
[1:11:40] i can warn our young kids not the world
[1:11:43] marry or
[1:11:44] date worldly people and everything else
[1:11:45] alone
[1:11:47] amen tell them get him in the church get
[1:11:49] him back
[1:11:50] see if they'll accept god first hello
[1:11:53] you can tell them all
[1:11:54] this stuff but it don't do nothing
[1:11:59] they do it right anyway you can tell
[1:12:02] them don't go down that road what will
[1:12:04] they do
[1:12:04] go down that road
[1:12:08] why don't hold them
[1:12:12] it has to be a personal experience with
[1:12:14] them with the lord
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:22] brother stephen here
[1:12:25] different ones i've used even
[1:12:29] this church say hey huh
[1:12:32] they just went out on a message perhaps
[1:12:34] went out there
[1:12:35] and tested as a result today they stayed
[1:12:37] by their self
[1:12:38] that's what you might have to look
[1:12:39] forward to does that do anything for
[1:12:42] them no it still doesn't do nothing
[1:12:43] i'm going to do it anyway why because
[1:12:46] people need a personal experience with
[1:12:47] almighty god
[1:12:49] how many believe we need that you don't
[1:12:51] need the god of yesterday
[1:12:53] you need a god of today
[1:12:56] how many needs a savior of today a
[1:12:59] filler of the holy ghost this morning
[1:13:02] that's what we need i got saved at 20
[1:13:06] years old
[1:13:07] the lord done something in my life and
[1:13:09] i'm still here
[1:13:12] huh i didn't go by somebody else
[1:13:17] no i said god
[1:13:20] come and help me lord i need your help
[1:13:25] please save me lord i don't know which
[1:13:27] way to go
[1:13:28] but here is my life here is my all and
[1:13:31] i'm here to testify
[1:13:33] and if you get to the right place and
[1:13:35] you meet the right conditions god is
[1:13:36] gonna do the same things
[1:13:38] we talk about pentecostals we talk about
[1:13:41] people of the past
[1:13:42] we talk about how people acted in the
[1:13:43] holy ghost what kind of church services
[1:13:45] they used to have
[1:13:46] you used to have but i want you to know
[1:13:48] that we are not people of a has-been
[1:13:54] where are people of them now how many
[1:13:57] believes that this morning
[1:13:58] that's what god is this morning
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:05] praise the lord we have a lot of sick
[1:14:08] people
[1:14:09] got people with cancer huh
[1:14:13] they don't need a god of history they
[1:14:16] need a god that's present
[1:14:18] the god that was with them needs to be
[1:14:21] here
[1:14:23] now i believe that the god is the same
[1:14:25] as he always was
[1:14:27] but i'm here to tell you this morning
[1:14:30] attaining it attaining these things
[1:14:34] huh let's just be real honest
[1:14:39] people have a real hard time attaining
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:44] receiving it in other words getting it
[1:14:48] that's what paul said it's not about
[1:14:51] running
[1:14:53] huh but it's about getting there huh
[1:14:56] how many believes that it's about
[1:14:59] getting there
[1:15:00] he said many run in the race many are
[1:15:02] running they're all running that's all
[1:15:03] part of it
[1:15:05] but it's not all about that it's about
[1:15:07] receiving it it's about
[1:15:09] getting there it's about possessing it
[1:15:14] how many believes that that's what it's
[1:15:17] all about
[1:15:22] amen praise the lord
[1:15:26] because the bible's promise is that if
[1:15:28] you ask
[1:15:31] you might get it it shall be given unto
[1:15:34] you
[1:15:36] oh my oh my and if you believe
[1:15:41] we're we're taught now let me go in this
[1:15:43] direction we're taught that
[1:15:44] first you have to accept what god has
[1:15:46] done already how many believe that
[1:15:49] in other words you have to accept that
[1:15:51] god has already done it for you
[1:15:58] amen it's a finished work
[1:16:03] but how many times did jesus say
[1:16:05] according to your faith
[1:16:08] so be it unto you that's where the fight
[1:16:11] comes that's where the battle comes
[1:16:14] is that faith huh
[1:16:20] remember i believe it was i'm thinking
[1:16:22] it was blind was it blind martin amos
[1:16:26] or was it the story of the man
[1:16:30] had a child that was sick i'm not sure
[1:16:32] which story it was
[1:16:34] but anyway remember jesus said you know
[1:16:37] he said if thou can't believe
[1:16:41] all things are possible remember the man
[1:16:44] saying back remember what he said
[1:16:47] lord i believe help thou my
[1:16:50] unbelief in other words it was a
[1:16:53] really hard situation but yet jesus was
[1:16:56] telling them
[1:16:57] anything is possible if you can believe
[1:16:59] it
[1:17:01] and the man had to acknowledge god help
[1:17:03] me with my unbelief
[1:17:06] i believe that's where the problem is
[1:17:08] today is that unbelief
[1:17:10] [Music]
[1:17:12] we might say that we believe but you
[1:17:14] have to genuinely believe
[1:17:17] if it ain't a genuine belief you'll be
[1:17:20] disappointed
[1:17:21] right now that if you would have
[1:17:23] genuinely believed it would have
[1:17:25] happened
[1:17:28] amen everybody can say amen to that
[1:17:32] because the bible says if you'll truly
[1:17:33] believe it'll happen
[1:17:35] so the problem is with you not god
[1:17:40] problem is with me not god the problem
[1:17:42] is with us not god
[1:17:44] because if we believe when we come to
[1:17:46] the place that we're supposed to come to
[1:17:48] it's going to happen how i long
[1:17:52] how i fierce for myself and for every
[1:17:54] one of us to get to that place that when
[1:17:56] we truly believe to something
[1:17:58] we see it manifested
[1:18:00] [Music]

[1:19:44] his ear
[1:19:49] in other words the problem wasn't so
[1:19:50] much with the donkey as it was with the
[1:19:52] with buddy because why he had a temper
[1:19:54] problem and that
[1:19:55] old thing would get out of the holing
[1:19:56] line and start plowing out in the middle
[1:19:58] of the field and
[1:19:59] he jerking around and then it'd just be
[1:20:01] a stubborn old thing and he got lost his

[1:20:37] where i'm at and everything else but i'm
[1:20:38] gonna go over here
[1:20:39] and if god don't fill me with the holy
[1:20:41] ghost and take my problem away from me

[1:26:08] and inheritance the land which i shall
[1:26:11] swear
[1:26:11] unto their fathers to give them remember
[1:26:13] a couple of wednesday nights ago we
[1:26:15] talked about how the brotherhood said
[1:26:16] when you get the holy ghost
[1:26:18] amen it's like inheriting a whole great
[1:26:20] big warehouse full of stuff
[1:26:22] amen and if you can't get it up high
[1:26:24] enough get a ladder climb up there and
[1:26:26] get it

[1:26:42] all right unto their fathers to give
[1:26:44] them
[1:26:45] only be thou strong
[1:26:50] how many believe this is an hour not to
[1:26:52] be weak
[1:26:55] but be strong
[1:26:58] paul said finally brethren be strong in
[1:27:02] the lord and in the power of his might
[1:27:04] put on the whole armor of god you know
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:07] put his whole lord abroad paul that's
[1:27:10] how he wanted the church he wanted
[1:27:11] ephesians to be strong
[1:27:13] in the lord
[1:27:17] to be hot for god to be on fire
[1:27:23] you know that's a simpler being on fire
[1:27:27] is simpler than what you think
[1:27:29] huh i was thinking about and i thought
[1:27:32] lord
[1:27:33] just let me burn let the people watch me
[1:27:37] burn
[1:27:38] huh let my neighbors watch me burn let
[1:27:41] my workers watch me
[1:27:42] everywhere i go lord just let people see
[1:27:45] me burn
[1:27:46] in other words just have that fire down
[1:27:48] on the inside
[1:27:51] somebody needs something you go help
[1:27:53] them you do something that's that fire
[1:27:55] burning
[1:27:57] it's not running around the aisles
[1:27:58] hiring
[1:28:00] sure that's part of it perhaps but your
[1:28:02] fire is to burn
[1:28:03] constantly wherever you are
[1:28:07] down on the inside you love to push play
[1:28:10] you love to read bible and you love to
[1:28:12] prey
[1:28:14] that's it burning how many wants is
[1:28:15] burning i mean god that's how i want to
[1:28:17] be
[1:28:18] i just want that fire burning in my
[1:28:19] heart
[1:28:22] be strong that's one of the requirements
[1:28:25] if you're going to see
[1:28:26] a god be a reality to you today is that
[1:28:29] you have to be strong in the lord
[1:28:31] if you don't want to see anything stand
[1:28:34] in your way
[1:28:35] then be strong in the lord and in the
[1:28:38] power of his might
[1:28:41] this is one of the conditions i believe
[1:28:44] amen all right
[1:28:48] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:28:51] to all the law which moses my servant
[1:28:53] commanded thee
[1:28:54] turn not from it to right hand or to the
[1:28:57] left
[1:28:59] amen that thou mayest prosper whether so
[1:29:03] ever thou
[1:29:03] goest but this book of the law shall not
[1:29:07] depart out of the mouth but thou shalt
[1:29:08] meditate therein day and night
[1:29:10] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:29:12] to all that is written therein for then
[1:29:14] shall thou make thy way prosperous and
[1:29:17] then
[1:29:18] shall thou have good success

[1:29:35] spirit of god knows you've had to fight

[1:31:03] it's a battle how many believes it's a
[1:31:05] battlefield
[1:31:07] sure you got to battle through every
[1:31:09] everything that comes your way
[1:31:12] all right and so forth we're in a battle
[1:31:14] listen well anything that satan's put
[1:31:17] upon you
[1:31:18] in the way of sickness or whatever it
[1:31:21] is

[1:31:28] done anything to any
[1:31:30] of you this morning taking your joy away
[1:31:33] taking your confidence maybe trees the
[1:31:34] holy spirit i don't know what it is
[1:31:36] but whatever the devil has done
[1:31:40] how many knows he says whatever it is
[1:31:44] that he has done
[1:31:45] every born-again person has an abstract
[1:31:49] warrant from god
[1:31:52] and the holy spirit is here to put any
[1:31:55] devil out huh
[1:32:00] praise the lord how many knows cancer is
[1:32:03] a devil
[1:32:05] cancer is a devil and he gets on people
[1:32:11] huh sure
[1:32:16] just like any a lot of those other
[1:32:17] things are
[1:32:19] devils that come upon sometimes
[1:32:23] no matter now notice the holy spirit
[1:32:26] here's put any devil out no matter if he
[1:32:28] is cancer
[1:32:30] tumor cataract whatever he is the holy
[1:32:33] spirit will
[1:32:34] put him out if you'll serve notice
[1:32:37] to him in the name of jesus christ
[1:32:40] because he's got
[1:32:41] no legal right
[1:32:44] no legal rights i am the lord that he
[1:32:47] loved all thy diseases is that right
[1:32:49] he was wounded for our transgression and
[1:32:51] with his stripes
[1:32:52] we were healed but you've got to go
[1:32:56] over and take it
[1:33:00] amen go over and take it
[1:33:07] oh my praise the lord
[1:33:11] you got to go and take it
[1:33:17] through prayer through believing
[1:33:21] how many believes that how is it that we
[1:33:24] fight
[1:33:25] how is it that we fight most of our
[1:33:27] battles
[1:33:28] is on our knees right here
[1:33:32] this is where we fight our battles
[1:33:37] the devil will tell you well i'll tell
[1:33:39] you what i've been trying to get the
[1:33:40] holy ghost for so long and i still ain't
[1:33:42] got it
[1:33:44] remember the one man that came to
[1:33:45] brother baby said brother ma'am i've
[1:33:46] been wanting to holy ghost for three
[1:33:48] years
[1:33:50] i know some of y'all can tell me what he
[1:33:51] said
[1:33:53] huh
[1:33:57] why are you not believing huh
[1:34:01] why are you not believing because if you
[1:34:04] truly believe the way you should
[1:34:06] you wouldn't be waiting three years for
[1:34:07] it
[1:34:09] huh unbelief and sometimes we
[1:34:12] think we believe when we don't really
[1:34:16] huh
[1:34:19] how many believe we need a real touch
[1:34:20] from the lord
[1:34:22] that we might attain let's not just run
[1:34:24] let's not just beat the air but say god
[1:34:26] here i
[1:34:27] am every promise in there is mine
[1:34:31] but we have untapped resources and a lot
[1:34:34] of times we look at that
[1:34:35] as being in the word or being out there
[1:34:38] somewhere no though
[1:34:39] i believe the valves to those untapped
[1:34:42] resources
[1:34:43] is right here in our hearts
[1:34:49] i truly believe it that it's right here
[1:34:53] amen why because brother brown said he
[1:34:56] made it
[1:34:57] very plain that if any person you take a
[1:35:00] sinner
[1:35:00] and any person that'll meet the
[1:35:02] requirements of the holy spirit
[1:35:04] come to the same conditions meet the
[1:35:06] same conditions that somebody else
[1:35:08] before them had
[1:35:09] him in the holy ghost will come and
[1:35:11] baptize with that person
[1:35:13] you will absolutely be filled with the
[1:35:14] holy ghost but they've got to meet those
[1:35:16] conditions
[1:35:18] and that right that heart in there it's
[1:35:20] got to be turned
[1:35:21] just right and so many times you know
[1:35:24] we've gotta
[1:35:25] so fight and battle amen
[1:35:29] even sometimes we gotta oh my we gotta
[1:35:31] fight doubt sometimes
[1:35:33] so many times we gotta fight well i
[1:35:35] don't know i don't know but you gotta
[1:35:36] get over that
[1:35:38] you gotta get past that and say god i
[1:35:39] believe your word and then rather than
[1:35:41] goes to explaining how to receive it
[1:35:44] and he says maybe you're paralyzed
[1:35:47] and you can't move nothing and he says
[1:35:50] you know
[1:35:51] you begin to say god i believe that i
[1:35:53] can move my finger
[1:35:55] i believe i can move my finger and the
[1:35:57] only thing that moves
[1:35:59] is your finger just a little bit
[1:36:04] just a little bit then he goes on to
[1:36:07] sand
[1:36:07] keep believing keep asking god you don't
[1:36:10] think it's a
[1:36:11] it's a fight how many believes it even
[1:36:12] receiving your healing or so it's a
[1:36:14] fight
[1:36:15] through doubt you got to barrel through
[1:36:17] that doubt and once you get that out of
[1:36:19] the way
[1:36:21] it's free sailing how many of these when
[1:36:23] that doubt
[1:36:24] goes to subsidy amen the more doubt that
[1:36:27] goes out of our life the more of these
[1:36:28] promises are going to be real to us
[1:36:34] i have to ask myself the question
[1:36:36] everybody has to ask yourself them
[1:36:38] questions perhaps we're not as strong in
[1:36:40] the lord
[1:36:42] that's what we think or more of these
[1:36:45] things would be happening in our midst
[1:36:48] huh because they should be how many
[1:36:52] believes
[1:36:52] miracles should be happened the very
[1:36:54] same god of moses and all of those
[1:36:57] he is he's here i believe he's with us
[1:37:01] but you know we've seen so many people
[1:37:02] die brother herbert
[1:37:04] and not get healed until it hurts our
[1:37:07] faith
[1:37:09] doesn't it it hurts our faith
[1:37:12] but i'm here i truly believe this
[1:37:14] morning that god's still the same
[1:37:17] he hasn't changed problems not with god
[1:37:20] it's with us perhaps our sincerity level
[1:37:25] because remember he says be courageous
[1:37:28] let this be in you
[1:37:29] day and night don't deviate it from
[1:37:32] right to the left
[1:37:33] huh and then what then you'll be
[1:37:37] successful
[1:37:40] but let's admit it sometimes we let our
[1:37:42] minds go to the right or to the left
[1:37:45] immediately let the outcome in
[1:37:48] because it is it truly is according to
[1:37:50] our faith
[1:37:51] how is it that uh brother branham could
[1:37:54] be there and the holy spirit could be
[1:37:55] there and
[1:37:56] certain people in the audience they'd
[1:37:57] get it and others would not get it
[1:38:02] back to thinking about brother bam says
[1:38:04] you'll fight
[1:38:05] he says it many many times every promise
[1:38:08] belongs to you
[1:38:09] but i guarantee you this one thing if
[1:38:12] you're gonna get any of it
[1:38:13] you have to fight for every inch that
[1:38:16] you get
[1:38:17] you got to fight doubt you got to fight
[1:38:19] i believe you got to fight things that
[1:38:21] you know you got to fight through it all
[1:38:22] brother bannon one time you remember
[1:38:24] when he wanted his own healing he wanted
[1:38:25] his own healing so much
[1:38:29] and from what i gather from what i
[1:38:31] gather about what brother baby said
[1:38:32] it wasn't some great spiritual
[1:38:34] revelation it was simply he said that i
[1:38:36] took
[1:38:37] god at his word and i said i believe
[1:38:40] that by his stripes i am healed
[1:38:42] amen and in front of his mama in front
[1:38:44] of his daddy amen the doctor says you
[1:38:47] ever take a bite of solid food it'll
[1:38:48] kill you
[1:38:49] dead you know right he began to eat
[1:38:52] onion he began to eat stuff you know
[1:38:54] and he went oh he was sick for days he
[1:38:57] was so hard
[1:38:58] would just make him cringe he was so
[1:39:00] hurt hurting bad
[1:39:03] throw up and swallow his puke back down
[1:39:07] he was fighting he was battling for his
[1:39:10] healing
[1:39:12] is that right but he defied
[1:39:15] live or die huh how many believes it has
[1:39:18] to be a live or die thing
[1:39:19] it has to be that desperate
[1:39:24] that god i need you now i mean i need
[1:39:27] you remember the woman with blood issue
[1:39:29] right
[1:39:29] the woman with the blood issue she came
[1:39:31] and she believed
[1:39:33] with all of her heart if she would just
[1:39:35] touch the hem of his garment
[1:39:38] isn't that right and she touched the hem
[1:39:39] of his garment and she was made
[1:39:41] completely whole
[1:39:43] how many believes if you touch if you'll
[1:39:45] just touch the hem of his garment
[1:39:47] you will be made completely whole
[1:39:52] but sometimes it takes desperation just
[1:39:55] like blind bar named bass remember him
[1:39:57] and brother bam says he was blocks away
[1:39:59] and he was screaming oh son of god help
[1:40:02] me help me he was yelling help
[1:40:06] he says if opportunity is passing by my
[1:40:09] opportunity being able to see is passing
[1:40:11] by i can't let it happen
[1:40:14] i can't let it pass by
[1:40:17] oh if the world would just see this
[1:40:19] morning that the opportunity to be saved
[1:40:21] and to live
[1:40:22] forever is passing them by
[1:40:25] it's right there if you'll just come and
[1:40:27] seek it they could have it
[1:40:29] how many believes that on the day of
[1:40:31] judgment that will be their judgment no
[1:40:33] i offered it to you
[1:40:35] i laid it out there but you did not want
[1:40:38] it
[1:40:39] that's what he's going to tell him you
[1:40:41] did not want salvation because i had my
[1:40:44] arm
[1:40:44] stretched out i provided it
[1:40:48] it was there don't talk to me about not
[1:40:52] saving you huh i put it out there i gave
[1:40:55] it to you but you was too busy with your
[1:40:57] horses
[1:40:58] you was too busy with your land you was
[1:41:00] too busy with your oxen and your
[1:41:01] marriages and everything else
[1:41:03] your world is too busy you did not ever
[1:41:05] take it serious
[1:41:07] you did not seek me diligently you
[1:41:08] didn't want me with all the art
[1:41:10] god loves when the when the righteous
[1:41:13] cry unto it the lord hears him amen
[1:41:16] desperately seek him see god hear him
[1:41:25] amen lord if you don't heal me
[1:41:29] i'm gonna die right here huh
[1:41:33] watch what happens
[1:41:36] mamas that would go back in their
[1:41:39] bedrooms
[1:41:40] because their son was at war and he's
[1:41:43] world war
[1:41:44] ii and he's probably to die in there
[1:41:47] praying all day
[1:41:49] think about the prophet of god going in
[1:41:51] that cave and being there for
[1:41:53] a long period of time before the angel
[1:41:55] ever came
[1:41:57] long periods of time do we pray that
[1:42:00] long no
[1:42:01] we pray for three minutes and god don't
[1:42:02] do it hey you know it's no wonder we
[1:42:04] don't get nothing
[1:42:06] he went there for days until the angel
[1:42:08] came and said you know if you heard
[1:42:09] huh daniel the same way but that's the
[1:42:11] way it's going to be
[1:42:12] lord here we are amen
[1:42:15] praise the lord in the cave just wait
[1:42:19] there
[1:42:20] wait for god to come those that
[1:42:22] diligently seek him
[1:42:25] amen blind barn was he was heard god
[1:42:28] heard him he called her his cry
[1:42:30] and he went and healed him brother bram
[1:42:34] says that's how we have to do sometimes
[1:42:35] he called them
[1:42:36] god's little spiritual cry babies he
[1:42:38] says a little child a little baby
[1:42:40] has no other way of getting what it
[1:42:42] wants to
[1:42:43] no don't give it no button to push huh
[1:42:46] no bell the ring
[1:42:49] cry he says that's what god sometimes
[1:42:51] wants us to cry out to him
[1:42:53] he loves when you call out to him say
[1:42:55] god i don't know what to do here i am
[1:42:57] buddy robinson he got the baptism of the
[1:42:59] holy ghost
[1:43:00] brother branham got his healing and that
[1:43:03] right he was healed after a few days
[1:43:05] they said brother about him you lied
[1:43:06] you didn't feel any better he was
[1:43:08] throwing up meeting your own people you
[1:43:10] said
[1:43:10] they just come by and ask him how you
[1:43:11] doing brother man i'm doing fine
[1:43:13] huh think about it
[1:43:19] you get prayed for if you ain't bitter
[1:43:22] by the next sunday you get paid for it
[1:43:23] again
[1:43:24] next time that you get prayed for it
[1:43:25] again you get paid for it again
[1:43:28] you're just hurting your own faith well
[1:43:31] it didn't happen last week
[1:43:33] but tuesday you say well it didn't
[1:43:34] happen last few times either
[1:43:37] huh i mean believe there comes a time
[1:43:40] you have to drive a stake saying i'm
[1:43:41] being prayed for here
[1:43:42] i'm committed to god and i'm going to go
[1:43:45] and begin to act like it's already done
[1:43:50] huh it's time to rise up
[1:43:53] sometimes in your healing or your
[1:43:55] salvation or whatever it might be it's
[1:43:56] time to rise up
[1:43:58] well he had pre peter in them had had
[1:44:01] they realized he had faith to be healed
[1:44:03] what did they say don't stay there
[1:44:05] but raise up get up and walk get up and
[1:44:07] go
[1:44:09] how many believes brother brown he began
[1:44:11] to eat
[1:44:13] he began to rise up say i'm eating
[1:44:16] i don't know if it's also what it was
[1:44:17] but who's gonna kill him if he ate too
[1:44:18] much of it
[1:44:19] you gotta be beginning god begin to see
[1:44:21] look at that say look at there
[1:44:23] look at there he really does believe me
[1:44:26] huh how many bees that's what we need we
[1:44:29] need desperation in our life
[1:44:34] desperation to be courageous
[1:44:37] courageous have courage don't be a wimp
[1:44:41] amen oh my be strong
[1:44:45] and very courageous because he was
[1:44:47] wounded for our transgression bruce for
[1:44:49] our iniquity
[1:44:49] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:44:51] him and by his stripes
[1:44:54] we are healed folks i don't know about
[1:44:57] you but when it comes
[1:44:58] we talk about heaven we talk about the
[1:45:01] rapture
[1:45:02] you know right
[1:45:06] we're not looking back how many believes
[1:45:08] we're looking forward
[1:45:10] i'm looking forward to the rapture
[1:45:11] brother brown even says you know we
[1:45:12] don't look at what cotton
[1:45:14] knox and calvin and all those but we
[1:45:16] look to now and the future
[1:45:19] i don't want to be disappointed today i
[1:45:21] want to attain
[1:45:23] like paul said unto the resurrection i
[1:45:25] don't claim to have already to
[1:45:26] attain to it but i follow after i put
[1:45:29] those things behind me that are passed
[1:45:31] how many is glad for it every day you
[1:45:32] can get up and say god forgive me for
[1:45:34] yesterday's failures here's a brand new
[1:45:36] day
[1:45:37] i missed that for new starts i like new
[1:45:39] starts
[1:45:40] hey man if you haven't exactly done all
[1:45:42] the way you're supposed to do
[1:45:44] you still have you still have the
[1:45:46] opportunity you still have the privilege
[1:45:48] of saying here lord here i am
[1:45:49] let me start anew
[1:45:53] maybe there's somebody in the morning so
[1:45:54] i don't know why i said that but maybe
[1:45:55] there's somebody's morning see i kind of
[1:45:57] need a new start lord
[1:45:59] i need a fresh start brother says we get
[1:46:02] the baptism in the holy ghost but we
[1:46:03] need a lot of refillings of the baptism
[1:46:05] of the holy ghost
[1:46:07] amen amen and that's there
[1:46:12] how many believes that when you ask god
[1:46:13] to forgive you you know he does because
[1:46:15] you feel it in your heart
[1:46:17] well it's not just for salvation it's
[1:46:19] not just forgiveness it's not just for
[1:46:21] give me the holy ghost it's for healing
[1:46:23] it's for whatever it is
[1:46:25] that we have need of that's god's there
[1:46:28] i am believing and i am praying that
[1:46:30] we're going to see
[1:46:31] more miracles more of the power of god
[1:46:35] because i truly believe that i heard i
[1:46:37] heard brother bam say in him tape
[1:46:39] yesterday he says you know
[1:46:41] how was it anymore something about how
[1:46:43] he could have done with moses no
[1:46:45] abraham how he could have had them to
[1:46:47] have a baby you know in their young life
[1:46:50] and so forth and and he could have done
[1:46:52] that so they could grow up with their
[1:46:53] children
[1:46:54] you know and enjoy them but he waited
[1:46:55] until they were old
[1:46:57] and couldn't have him anymore he says
[1:46:59] like why does god do stuff like that
[1:47:01] he says because god loves to work
[1:47:04] miracles
[1:47:06] i mean god loves to work miracles he
[1:47:09] loves to do it
[1:47:12] i mean being carnal me and you if we had
[1:47:16] that kind of power we would probably
[1:47:18] show off a little right
[1:47:20] we'd probably say look what i can do
[1:47:22] well he's not
[1:47:23] carnal but he's god and he loves to show
[1:47:26] his power
[1:47:28] my question is every one of us are we
[1:47:30] willing to receive it and say god
[1:47:33] let me see your power i need your power
[1:47:35] this morning
[1:47:36] amen whether it's this layout is a
[1:47:40] age that causes this to become kind of
[1:47:43] haphazard or whatever it might be
[1:47:45] whether it's healing whether whatever it
[1:47:46] might be
[1:47:48] amen so how many believe that these
[1:47:50] things don't always just come real easy
[1:47:54] they come with much prayer even
[1:47:57] whenever the disciples couldn't cast out
[1:47:59] that
[1:48:00] child with epilepsy i believe it was
[1:48:03] couldn't cast that devil out
[1:48:06] jesus said why couldn't you cast a bow
[1:48:07] i'll tell you right now why you couldn't
[1:48:09] cast them out
[1:48:10] it was because of your unbelief isn't it
[1:48:13] strange they could cast everything else
[1:48:14] out
[1:48:15] but when it came to that one they didn't
[1:48:17] have the faith they didn't have the
[1:48:18] belief for it
[1:48:20] because he strictly directly said
[1:48:21] because of your unbelief
[1:48:24] however he says this does not come out
[1:48:26] by prayer and fasting
[1:48:29] so what does prayer and fasting tell us
[1:48:31] that it will increase your faith
[1:48:33] amen so that prayer that fasting that
[1:48:36] dedicate it increases it
[1:48:37] increases it jesus was the master
[1:48:40] and he was prayed up when he prayed for
[1:48:43] it it was all done
[1:48:45] amen so let me just close
[1:48:48] in saying this i say lord jesus
[1:48:52] to myself probably all of us say help
[1:48:55] bow my unbelief help
[1:48:58] our unbelief lord because that's where
[1:49:01] that's
[1:49:02] where the problem lays is our unbelief
[1:49:07] that's the only thing that's the battle
[1:49:09] that's the biggest battle that's the
[1:49:11] that's that's where the war is amen
[1:49:15] let's stand this morning how many will
[1:49:18] be in
[1:49:19] prayer for all the different ones and
[1:49:22] for
[1:49:23] god to continue to protect the church
[1:49:24] here amen
[1:49:26] every individual all of us because we
[1:49:29] truly are
[1:49:30] living in perilous times my friend
[1:49:32] perilous times
[1:49:34] because paul said perilous times would
[1:49:37] come and we're
[1:49:38] i truly believe we're here but the midst
[1:49:40] of all of that
[1:49:42] i'm thankful that god gives us
[1:49:46] how did he put it here i believe in
[1:49:48] isaiah
[1:49:53] know his proverbs whoso hearkeneth
[1:49:56] but whosoever hearkeneth unto me shall
[1:49:59] dwell
[1:50:00] safely and shall not be
[1:50:03] quiet for fear and shall be quiet
[1:50:08] from fear of evil
[1:50:13] how many likes to play and stay in that
[1:50:14] place where the holy spirit is where
[1:50:16] it's quiet
[1:50:18] the devil can't rattle you
[1:50:22] because you're in that quiet place
[1:50:24] because you found the lord you found
[1:50:26] that shelter
[1:50:27] you found that rock to hide under it
[1:50:30] doesn't matter how much the wolves cry
[1:50:33] how whatever it is there you are in that
[1:50:35] quiet place
[1:50:36] before the lord let's bow our heads
[1:50:41] search your heart this morning i've
[1:50:43] searched mine
[1:50:45] and i've said to the lord father help my
[1:50:48] unbelief
[1:50:50] i want to be completely
[1:50:53] rid of any unbelief in my life lord how
[1:50:56] many out there would say
[1:50:57] you know if it's truly just unbelief
[1:51:00] that's holding me back then lord help my
[1:51:01] unbelief
[1:51:03] lord help my unbelief god bless you god
[1:51:06] bless you
[1:51:06] god bless you up there balcony god sees
[1:51:09] you
[1:51:11] lord jesus we come before you lord
[1:51:15] and we realize lord jesus it doesn't
[1:51:17] matter how look and how hard the
[1:51:18] condition is
[1:51:20] you still speak to our hearts as you did
[1:51:23] those in the bible when you said
[1:51:25] if thou canst believe all things are
[1:51:28] possible
[1:51:30] and lord we still say father help us
[1:51:33] help our unbelief lord
[1:51:36] for we know that these promises are ours
[1:51:41] there you it's your word that you have
[1:51:43] given that if we would ask
[1:51:46] we would receive you said if we would
[1:51:48] seek
[1:51:49] we would find if we would knock
[1:51:53] you would open lord jesus and if we're
[1:51:56] knocking and it isn't opening then lord
[1:51:58] there's something wrong with us if we're
[1:52:00] asking
[1:52:01] but we're not receiving then lord
[1:52:04] there's got to be a little unbelief in
[1:52:05] there
[1:52:06] lord help our unbelief if we're seeking
[1:52:10] but we're not finding then lord there's
[1:52:13] some unbelief
[1:52:15] nor will i ask this morning that you
[1:52:17] would open up these channels lord
[1:52:20] these untapped resources these places
[1:52:22] that we haven't been before
[1:52:24] this drink that we haven't drank before
[1:52:28] father we ask god that you help our
[1:52:30] heart to open that we might
[1:52:31] drink of the water of life freely

[1:52:37] the holy spirit
[1:52:39] drink our healing in lord say oh wow
[1:52:41] lord you
[1:52:42] are such a wonderful god for
[1:52:45] you come through with all of your
[1:52:47] promises and this morning we ask
[1:52:49] that you would go out into the
[1:52:50] congregation lord and then you'll search
[1:52:52] all of our hearts and say god
[1:52:54] father we don't know just how bad even
[1:52:57] this virus will get
[1:52:59] we don't know if we'll be the one
[1:53:00] catching or not we know that's all in
[1:53:03] your hands and we're trusting you in it
[1:53:05] but father if we do we're going to trust
[1:53:08] you for our healing
[1:53:09] we're going to believe you with all of
[1:53:10] our heart we ask god this morning god
[1:53:13] that you would just
[1:53:15] touch all those around us we've
[1:53:16] mentioned earlier father
[1:53:18] that has picked it up lord jesus some of
[1:53:20] them especially father
[1:53:22] that get it hard lord and in the
[1:53:24] hospital in a real bad case we
[1:53:26] ask god you would touch and do father
[1:53:28] what the doctors can't do for your
[1:53:30] prophet taught us that
[1:53:31] if we can get medical help that we ought
[1:53:33] to do that but lord
[1:53:34] you're the ultimate healer and if they
[1:53:36] can't do it
[1:53:37] if they can't help it we know that you
[1:53:39] work through medicines and so forth lord
[1:53:41] but we ask god
[1:53:43] that you give a special touch father
[1:53:44] those who need it this morning lord
[1:53:47] and lord we do thank you and praise you
[1:53:50] worship your father
[1:53:52] for your protection lord and for your
[1:53:53] guidance for your mercy and for your
[1:53:55] grace
[1:53:56] for your wonderful promises that you
[1:53:58] have given us that we can claim
[1:54:00] we ask god that you just be merciful to
[1:54:04] each and every one of us lord
[1:54:06] continue to shed your grace and lord we
[1:54:09] know that
