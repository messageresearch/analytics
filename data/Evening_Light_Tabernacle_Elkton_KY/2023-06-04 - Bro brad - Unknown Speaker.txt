amen and amen better try coming through scripture reading amen I think we can be dismissed for Sunday school this morning if we'll go in the Psalms to Psalms 96 beautiful day to be in the house of the Lord Psalms 96. we'll read that whole chapter oh sing unto the Lord a new song sing unto the Lord all the Earth there is Glory among the Heathen his wonders among all people for all the gods of the Nations or Idols but the Lord made the heavens foreign give unto the Lord O ye kindreds of the people give unto the Lord glory and strength oh Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness fear before him all the Earth [Music] let the heavens rejoice and let the Earth be glad Let the Sea Roar in the fullness thereof uh this one together before the Lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the Earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth God bless you may be seated brother Brian thank you morning brothers and sisters if you would uh turn with me to uh Deuteronomy the 18th chapter I was just so after Wednesday when brother Daniel was talking I was hoping you all did your Bible study and found that friend that verse in Genesis about whether Isaac was bound or Unbound he was in a sneaky way it was making you do a Bible study so I hope y'all I'm not going to give you the answer you need to find the answer yourself you know preachers tell you they'll tell you all your life all the time you're sitting in it congregations you're obligated he's obligated to preach you the truth and teach you the truth but you're also obligated to go back to the word of God and have it vindicate to you it's got a It's gotta flashback to you that it's the truth and if you don't do that you're just believing what someone told you and a lot of times you're gonna find out coming short because you know as you pass information down the line by the time it gets to the end it's not the same thing that was heard in the beginning so you got to know and you got to know the truth but I was just thinking there was a lot of the ministers have been talking about a a lot of things that are going on in the world and I'm I'm not going to bring up it to property but even in the psalm we were just reading two examples were given that the psalm told you to be an example in front of the Heathen well that you are fulfilling that scripture today if you're a bible-believing message believing believer you are actually testifying to the heathing out there in the world that there is a better way and there is a difference between beating the eating and being a Believer but I was thinking that all the stuff that's going on in the schools and in the country you know it's all depravity but the real the property Satan's pretty crafty he's I mean he's been doing this for thousands of years and in this creation and he's been around I don't know how long but when you take children and you put images before them that they don't understand that image is going to be forever burned in their mind and in forever so if you give wrong pictures to your children and you give wrong examples to your children that's they're going to be possessed by them thoughts and those images as they grow up and that's the depravity of what's going on everyone knows it's not acceptable behavior but when you take those images and you burn them into the mind of young men and young women when they get to become our age or teenagers or young adults those images are gonna and if they don't have an experience where God takes those can take those out and put them in the sea of on his forgetfulness that's going to be a problem and what what they're starting now 10 years from now where is it going to be 10 or 15 years from now you could talk about the depravity and everything that's going on you could you could list everything that's wrong but you you're getting into the weeds with and the truth is they're just they're taking a whole generation like brother Brown taught in his messages he goes back to the 30s and the 20s when things were starting to get loose then he goes through the 40s and World War II and his things get looser then you talk about the 60s the rock and roll music and all the depravity then now you get to 2023 I mean there's no hope I mean everything is off kilter there's no foundation for anything anymore so if your hope is I'm not even on my point if y'all is in the things of this world then you're going to be sadly mistaken and I'll just read a I hope I found I didn't lose my spot here but um Moses is talking to the church
