all right Ephesians 1 and verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to good pleasure of his will jump over to verse n having made known unto us the mystery of is well now notice this last verse it talks about amen that he adopted us amen according to the good pleasure of his will now verse n it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will amen according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counil of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of Truth amen the gospel of your salvation how many has been there amen been there and done that in whom also you have after ye believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight I want to speak about abiding in the the will of God Amen first I just wanted to speak on the will of God but I want to talk about abiding in the will of God I like Revelations I was just going to read that first verse there am me just one verse it talks about and all who dwell on the purch on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of said this week he says you know know the message that he preached on here him amen he just used like one simple little scripture amen but he said amen and so you can just take one scripture just a scripture like what we read right there and we just realize that what we have read is of course the mystery that everybody doesn't really understand amen people don't people of the world don't really understand what it's all about amen but now let's just let's just try to lay something here talking about the will will of God anden when I think beg to think about the will of God that I begin to think about that song about when he was on the cross I was on his mind amen I mean know I was on his mind when he was on the cross amen and uh also that other song about talking about uh talking about his will amen with the man on the cross had my name in his will amen praise the Lord Jesus I believe one place set Noah Testament isn't in in effect until the testator is dead remember when we take the communion he said this is the New Testament in my blood so the New Testament is the new The Testament of Jesus Christ amen and the other thought is that you know you as to ask the question well what is the will of God what is the will of God brother bam says you know God's word is his will amen and that's why I wanted to read that talking about your name amen I many know you in that book before the foundation of the world your name is in his will oh my praise be to God and if your name is in his will and I had to think about you know you know I could tell you that my father you know my father you know when he died it was he was the richest man that ever lived amen my my father when he died he was the richest that ever was and guess what I want it to say that I got everything I got everything but I want to say that we got everything amen because it's if I say I mat she like well I got everything but I got everything and everybody else all the other children got everything too how many believe that we got everything all things didn't Paul say and P say all things are yours things present things to come the world it doesn't matter what it was it's all yours oh my when I I say Lord let let that sink in brother Glenn I don't think it's sinking in is it everything is yours you even own death death is mine that's right how many knows it's a buggy it has to obey you now it ain't got no power over you no say you want to you want to get me sick and you want to kill me guess what all you're going to do is you're GNA be the buggy that takes me to my new house it's the vehicle that you have to go into your new house blue right you want to die boo scary huh no boo back I ain't afraid of dying no because why because you know exactly what's on the other side amen how many enjoys coming to church and and just basking in the presence of God Amen I I came in earlier a little bit and they were playing she was playing that up there and I just sat there on the back bench and I was just basking it in and just just I thought well my goodness you know I didn't get to do that hardly all week and just just relax and bask in the presence of God of these days we're not always going to do this it won't be very long brother B and we're going to be in our Eternal place amen whether good or bad whether good or bad everybody speaking to be in their Eternal place and I'm glad that you can come on a Wednesday night and say Lord I'm getting ready for the good place I'm getting ready for the good place I'm coming to the house of judgment amen I know the judge is going to be up there and he's going to condemn me for everything I do terrible and bad huh CU is how many know judgment must begin at the house of God Amen but I'm so glad but by God's grace amen I'm GNA get hit of myself here but one of the will of God is for to chastise you as many as I love his will is to chasten you to rebuke you if you want to be a Christian first thing you can expect is a good old fashion rebuke chastisement a whipping from God it's all in the program it's all in the will of God for that to be so amen that's right because we have got some ways that we ought to have we still got ways we ought to have we think things that we ought and think do things that we oughtn't do amen but I want the mind of Christ I the will of God in my life I desire nothing more as what Jesus said you know he said remember he said uh they came back to him Jesus said have you got any meat here he says my meat is to do the father's will I don't care if I eat or if I don't eat my heart's desire and passion is to do God's will that's my thought tonight how many wants to be in God's will cuz I want to tell you something tonight it's a horrible thing to be be in his permissive will his permissive will is a place that you don't want to be amen and many many many people get out of the will of God so sad to say but many do many people get out of the will of God his word is his will so if you ever want to know whether you know you you're doing God's will or not just see if you're doing his word or not amen how many's glad that you accepted acts 238 you accepted John 3:16 whosoever believeth in me shall not perish but have everlasting life Lord you accepted his will you realize tonight that it's not his will that any should perish if it's not his perfect will that any should perish then it has to be his permissive will right ain't never heard that before have you that's right it's his permissive will in other words if you really want to go you can he'll permit you it's called free choice free m agency let's take a little trip I love taking a little trip let's not go back so far that God's alone anymore let's go back to where he had created Millions perhaps of angels hundreds of thousands of angels I don't just how many it was ain't that right and he had one special Angel there that was right there beside God we're going to call him God's rightand man right next to God ain't that right amen and of course we know that uh that was the first he was he was walked among the coals of God and the glory of God the beauty of God I just can't grasp why he wasn't happy I just can't grasp it but he was right where he was supposed to be a that right he was right where he's supposed to be we're going say that he was perfectly in the will of God and I never knew it until the Prophet come along and told us that all those angels and everybody up there was put on free moral agency to [Music] I'm just going to say something off the wall a little bit hang on I hope when we get over there brother Tommy there ain't no more free moral agency Lord Jesus you lock me in don't you let me I don't want to have a choice I want to be there I you know are you with me I want be locked in cuz we have a tendency to mess up when we have free moral agency we have a strong long tendency to mess up I don't know whether there will be or not amen I don't know that but I'm just saying I hope not I hope that uh you know won't be any of that anymore why perhaps because we made our choice down here I mean we we're free moral agents you had you could choose whether you wanted to come to church or not tonight can boy I'll tell you what I'm a I I'm a preacher that believes that you can do what you want I'm here to tell I believe that you ought to do what you want cuz if you come to church and you don't really want it you really hate it you're going to be a miserable creature and you're not going to be there anyway huh not going to be there anyone anyway but it has to be in your heart I mean know it has to be in your heart that's why we pray for our children children by the time they get up let's hope that they've got a passion to want to know God to love God with all of their heart mind soul and strength I justify that statement by saying what Jesus said he said I would that you were either cold or hot and that even God want you to either be hot or go get cold amen but don't be somewhere in between somewhere in between is the most miserable place that you can been after amen you know after he decided that he wanted to be like God he wanted to have a kingdom this that or the other what did he do he actually got out of the will of God didn't he he got out of the will of God and look where he's at today he is one miserable creature no chance of being saved amen and he went to blabbering his mouth all over heaven you know God just thinks he's the only holy one around here he gets all the glory do you realize that same Spirit got into Dayan and Kora when brother Brandon was in Johannesburg one of those ministers when brother bam said it's not the will of God for us to go over into these other cities God told me to stay right here one of the ministers said yeah but do you are what are you do you think you're the only one that gets hears from God better bam on the tapes says you know that's exactly what naan said the Earth Earth opened up and swallowed him up alive amen I I hope to get to it but I wanted to touch on that for just a minute because even brother bam got out of the perfect will of God down in uh Down in Africa and so forth those places isn't that right God had told him and I'll just go ahead and read it to he say I kept on praying asking God if I could go along and so forth and along about 3:00 or four o'clock in the morning here he come and I said and he said he says who are these men what do they mean Lord he said go on with them but you're going to pay for it if you go with them you can go but if you if you want to go all right but remember you're going to pay for it how many know by get out of the and a terrible price it was when they went up under other cities they said a typhoon or rain storm come so bad they couldn't even have the service the one night it was just a terrible deal a that right why because he got out of the will of God Better B ended up I think two three years sick to his stomach paid dearly for disobeying God for getting out of the will of God the Devil he's going to pay dearly all those angels that got out of the will of God Amen once in Perfect Harmony angels and worshiping God maybe like you and I tonight oh magnify the Lord with me for he is worthy to be praised H they worship God the next thing you know they were Fallen Angels is that right Fallen Angels after a bit come on down and now they're miserable them are some miserable creatures they love to try to make you miserable the devil will do anything to try to get you out of the will of God out of his perfect will I'm here to tell you something once you know that you're in the will of God now I'll talk to you about bad bad bad things really happen when you get out of the will of God you're going to experience some bad stuff coming down the hatch of your life when you get get out of the will of God remember Naomi she left the promised land where we supposed to be and it was the drought it was a absolute uh famine in the land and she went somewhere else trying to get comfort and so forth a't that right amen Mary uh her husband ended up dying and her children her daughters you know that ended up marrying a couple guys and they ended up dying a of bad stuff happened now how many know the prophet of God taught you know that as long as Israel is in her Homeland amen she's blessed even if it's going rough for you in the will of God at least you can stand there and say I know I'm in the will of God and you'll overcome whatever God allows you to go through you'll overcome it amen but you get out of the will of God we'll see what happens amen brother bam how many knows when he was uh went to that Pentecostal meeting up there in Indiana and and everybody was inviting him to come come preach come preach now the will of God was for him to go wasn't it no he didn't obey his will did he brother brandham took his own will he lived by his own will it had cost him dearly amen people can go their own way if you want to you can do your own with you know scripture comes to mind he said Jesus said uh he that saves his life you can have your own life live your life I gotta live my life go ahead and live your life but you'll pay you'll lose it but if you forfeit your life to Jesus Christ and come his way and his will you'll preserve it amen one has both of them have a reward but it's a heavy penalty to have to pay for your own way I don't want my own way I hope everybody else you should hate your own way don't go your own way you come the way that God says for you to come come to his will amen I only have two quotes I already read the one I want to read the other one amen you'll pay for it how many knows he paid dearly for it Amen brother benan the god of his evil age he was talking about uh he says never in any other age that women act the way they they do never just before the destruction of the Andel luian world and Jesus referred to it he says now has God Lo has God lost [Music] control is this whole thing out of control or is he just permitting another agency to control now how many knows that what happened in the Garden of Eden with Eve God even brother Bram says it wasn't God's will for us to come by sexual desire wasn't supposed to go that way that wasn't the perfect will of God but he permitted it built it in such away until he could be permitted as a matter of fact it's so different from the program of God we got to get born again is that right but Eve how many know Eve got out of the will of God Adam got out of the will of God boy oh boy speak to the tree and it would be speak to the hills and it'll be move to the mountain move it'll move whatever he say he had that power he had a clear conscience he didn't know what fear was but he got out of the will of God Amen into the will of the serpent boy he's a slick one he's slick amen but you think about it got out of there all the way back there begin to get out of the will of God look at the cost look at the price look at the horrible thing that come because somebody got out of the will of God Amen we go on down a little bit further amen all the way down to daythan and cor and Moses you know and and God leading them out and all the things that he done daythan and cor they were all there they were all having a good time there was no problem but one day Dayan decided that you know Moses you take too much upon yourself you make yourself the big shot there's more of us as Are Spiritual oops he begin to get out of the will of God I believe brother bam sit in the church hbook he says the bride knows what God's they have thus saith the Lord ain't that right in other words you'll go according to the will of go God and if you don't know for sure then guess what or you stay still if he had just stayed still everything had have been fine there' have been no earthquake him and his family wouldn't went down alive into the pit I can hear the streaming can't you women little girls little boys and their little screeches and the clap of the earth coming back and slamming it shut do you realize that for the next day the children of Israel opened their mouth let me tell you something how many knows it is never the will of God for somebody to complain and murmur when you begin to murmur and you complain you are out of the will of God [Music] Amen it's exactly where the devil wants you that's what Dayan and they weren't happy just like the devil wasn't happy where he's at they were not happy with the will of God Amen women aren't happy being women anymore women aren't happy in staying at home and raising the kids anymore amen if he made you a woman he made you a female he made you a mom you had a treasure raising up children to the Lord that's the will of God for your life amen amen we could go all into the New Testament talking about husband love your wives and so forth and the women and and you know this is the will of God and so forth amen but look at that look at look at Samson W I love talking about Samson heaps upon heaps isin't that right 10 a thousand Philistines just slaughtered them all got up on the last big pile of people and and said hey that all you got amen folks let me tell you something don't let nobody tell you well God's GNA bless you and he's going to be good to you whether you're good or whether you're bad that's not true that's not true why because if that was the case we might as well do bad that's what you want to do it's simply a lie you get out of the will of God and you are in for it amen oh God ain't gonna lose you he's still gonna have his hand on you but he's kind of heavy gonna be a hand a't that right back to my thought think about Israel when they got how many knows Israel got out of their Homeland they were scattered to All Nations is that right and what did Brother bham call the Holocaust six million Jews slaughtered by Hitler but it was the tender hand of Jehovah driving them back home back to the place that they ought to be when you feel like you're getting a weapon like you ain't never had remember it's the tender hand of Jehovah getting you back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember Jesus said if you abide in me and my word abide in you you'll ask what you will W how many wants to stay there Lord help me to get into you let me get into the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal amen it don't never let me grieve the Holy Spirit whereby we are sealed don't grieve him and you can ask what you will woo on that's the other half though that's not supposed to be for another 10 or 15 minutes amen God is good isn't [Music] he brother brandham sure got it didn't he when he didn't do what God wanted him to do wife child just terrible things his father amen going over a waterfall fixing the goal and lose his life his engine on his boat would not start would not start that boy haunting him saying no what about that what trash that you call trash why didn't you go is that right Lord God if you forgive me God if you'll forgive me I got another 20 feet I got another short distance before I go over lord if you'll forgive me thank you Lord off you went that close God let him get to that fall you want to know what backsliding is you want to know what getting out of the will of God it's a nightmare I've got this wrote down a lot of us have been there a lot of us know what it's like to get out of the W out of the will of God and your life ends up a nightmare amen that's right Lord help us cuz how many believes tonight that staying in the of God is a daily thing when I get up of a morning I say Lord what do you want me to do today amen do you want me to work on this do you want me to work on that do you want me to help Tommy with concrete do I want to go FL breed fertilizer whatever it is Lord amen Lead Me God lead me and guide me let me stay in your perfect will amen my the children of Israel in the book of Jude I didn't put my thing down but you know in the book of Jude verse 5 it says talks about I will therefore have you put in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Israel afterwards destroy them that believe not amen so Israel the one of the first things that he brings about in the children of Israel oh dancing with Miriam on the other side Victory W Hallelujah folks I'm telling you there's a lot of make believer that'll Shout House Down they'll run down they'll do this guy to the other but it's not about the short term it's about whether you stay in the will of God or not oh I want to say I hate shortterm people but I won't say hate I'll say what Paul said my soul has no pleasure in a man that draws back that's what Paul said amen disappointing disappointing but it happens because you got every kind is what did I leave out brother Tommy what did I leave out out amen some is you know abides for a while and rejoices a that right but tribulation comes up and so forth and by and by it's offending and out it goes he like that little net that's Gast amen and you bring certain fish and you know and and and snapping turtles and everything else a that right but what I left out was that some seed falls on good ground and brings forth its kind aren't you glad glad for that part brother time when I think about it 30 years something 32 years preaching pastoring 40 probably being a Christian going through every Brier patch you could imagine a it right most of us if you live very long you're Christian you're going to go through some Brier patches it isn't all going to be easy new new new some of it got Allowed by God a lot of it allowed by yourself right brought on by yourself because we didn't oh my if I could just let I hope tonight we get this really down in our hearts and lives it'll save you a lot of trouble down the road how many believe let's remember this don't get out of the will of God stay in his perfect will whatever that word says do it that is his will whatever it is and I want to say on the other hand anything contrary to that word is not his will is that right is out of the will of God Naomi certainly had it rough when she stepped out and Sam never finished Samson story remember Samson gave it gave it up there he was his eyes poked out God didn't bless him when he got out of God's will I don't know about you but it'd be kind of painful have somebody take a knife and just gouge your eye out and then your other eye and there you are blind going around some grinding wheel oh my if I had just Abode in the place that God had me if I have just stayed where God put me sometimes in life there's I guess three major things that I thought of when I was thinking about this message three major Wills of God that you want to find in your life first of all to find out whether you're son and daughter of God or not accept the Lord Jesus Christ and come to him come to the will of God that is number one that's the greatest will that you want God's will amen can you see how that if you're saved tonight can you see can you see your name on that book can you see your name in the Booky if I don't finish my thought I never will one of is that the second is of course your wife or your husband how many believes you want to pray about your marriage outside of your your salvation that's the most important thing and then of course the church you go to and where you live how many believe you want to be in the will of God it's important CU once you know that and when God blesses you in that and establish you say hey this is what God wants me to do this is where God wants me then oh it's not always going to be a flowery bed be God never promises but if you're in the will of God you are where you're supposed to be and if you're stay there God will see you through how many beli that God will see you through whatever troubles that come your way amen but you get out of the will of God folks and it'll be just just a terrible thing amen praise be to God having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and he made known to us the mystery of his will amen how many know he let us know that I wrote your name down before the foundation of the world if you ever do come to God and you are a part of God you had to be on that name that list before the world ever began you were on his will or should I say in his will didn't brother R say they all predestinated having predestinated us according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will he predestinated you according to his will don't they to do something for you knowing that hey he predestinated you to his will if you're worship in God you're saved you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was his will to save you the P the permissive will is everything out there that's evil remember he said has God lost control no he is permitting another agency he permits the devil to do what he did and what he does even the devil doesn't can't touch you without a permit amen so if something happens to you you tell the devil you better have a permit where's your permit show me your permit well if you have it he probably already permit it but say I'm my the Lord is my healer some comes upon you God is testing you he's trying you we never know what's going to happen to us huh never know that's in God's hands but I'm glad to be in his hands how many knows it helps to know that the devil has to have permission yes he he's permitting sin he is permitting all things and it is his permissive will but you're in his perfect will how many believe you're perfectly saved you're perfectly Sanctified you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of that is in perfect well amen his uh being lost was if was a permissive well but to bring you back that was his perfect well I'mma bring you back I'm going redeem him the second ad going to redeem us back back to the perfect will of God Amen what a wonderful thing you sitting there tonight sitting in his perfect will the devil would have you out there somewhere doing something else he wants you somewhere else have your passion your desire what you love to do somewhere else but no God has giving you something down on the inside here a desire a thirst from more God a thirst for righteousness I thirst for the will of God I thirst say God get rid of my own will thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen that's right Lord help us let thy will be done amen six million Jews slaughtered to what shut the door is that right shut the door to the Jews hey we've got to go what did they do load up

a nonf fruit bearing Christian Idol not really going anywhere not doing nothing just huh no he says if you are that way you don't bear fruit he taketh it away he and every branch that does bear fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit and ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you huh why would Jesus say that AB why because we all know how easy it is to get away to get lukewarm amen now notice as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide and divine and no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same brings forth much fruit W how many bed that we could use a little bit more of the joy of the the fruit of Joy the fruit of Peace the fruit of longsuffering

because as long as I'm here you want y'all want the good part y'all want the good part I can't hear you let me tell you about the good part whenever you're walking and talking and the perfect the will of God Amen I don't care if you got walls of Jericho amen how you got to do is worship and praise God and they'll come down and then you will lose a man you won't have a scratch you won't have no injuries it ain't until you get a dayon that get not a dayon but a Aon that gets out of the will of God and upsets the whole thing don't let a Dayan or aan come into your heart out of the will of God stay right there amen the walls of Jericho will come down that a little bit of lukewarmness and that just depression and what comes along with not having God in your life this is what happens when you abide in him when you've got him on the inside amen listen if you abide you shall ask what you will and it shall be done ask for them walls to come down ask for that giant to fall it doesn't matter you become an invincible Army when you're walking in the perfect will of God you're Invincible you're unstable no matter what comes your way God is going to handle it but if you're not in the will of

of the will of God and never see it and never see [Music] it I look at what he's got to do better Tommy if I get out of the will of God God you let me know you let me know you get you whip out and you drive me back home this old cow wants to act like a dumb driven cow you go ahead and drive this cow that's right Bible says don't be like a dumb driven cow while Israel was kind of that way we as human beings tend to be that way we don't do change we don't go a lot of times it takes Hard Times different things in our life bad things that happen in our life to push us into the place that God wants us to be how can I write that or say that again it takes bad things in our life to dri drive us into the perfect will of God a lot of times because we're too stubborn amen amen you love him this was my this is the capping of it if you abide in me I like that we know what happens if you don't abide did it say you'd be blessed no he says you'd be withered if a man abide not he is withered and what happens with withered branches they throw them off into the fire what happened with Israel of Jude there he says the Angels which kept not their first estate and gomorah were given over is that right those people weren't sodomites at one time look at America isn't that right I've always said about America how great we could have been how great we could have stayed if we would have Abode in God if we wouldn't let them Rascals take prayer out of school Child come home and it was beat half to death and I'm telling you what that child is was way abused well go ahead and Let's Straighten that teacher out but don't take the whip out huh yeah just like our cops like our police force yeah there's a lot of them do should that things they didn't shouldn't do but don't dismiss the cotton picking police force cotton picking ain't a bad word right so I'm okay oh my but that's what they do Insane think of what it could have been in brother Ram what he say what if America and every the world would have embraced the gift that God gave to us my it would have been the Millennium God would have just come on down is that right God would just come on down and said boy them folks I'm human beings I am not at all disappointed that I made them look how they've received it they've changed they're holy they're pure amen the world has accepted the blood that I shed I me as well come down here and change their bodies anden create a new world anden and live in the Millennium I'm not sure what was it brother bam said about Solomon was it a millennium was it it was a great time for Israel when they accept the gift that was in Solomon ain't that right it was a great time could have been a great for us but because how many knows what God did in this generation was the will of God how many times brother B would preach um God's provided way for this day this message is God's it's his will lean not to your own understanding brother bam says you know I believe um no it wasn't leaning un to you understand it was a message called doing God a service without it being his will amen and he My Oh My My Own M did y'all read that quote where brother bam says all of our missionary all of our he says they going to the prayer to the the the the flag post and thousands upon thousands of and prayer say pray might as well not to win it's out of the will of God denominations going on the way they did it they're doing God a service without being his will because they didn't accept what God sent him in the first place that's why he had the authority to say such amen wow they didn't accept the will of God lord I want to accept the will of God I accept every word I accept every message preachers come by and hurts me a little or whatever Lord I want it if it's the word of God change me the word ain't going to change for you you got to change for the word amen musicians if you'll come if you want to live in The Nightmare get out of the will of God and you've got it especially one of his children God didn't spare Samson did he no they gouch his eyes out and made a slave out of him of course he came back cuz God ain't going to lose his is that right brother Brandon crying for his little Sharon Rose God don't take my baby God don't take my baby don't take my baby I the one that did it is that right flies flying around and so forth pimples almost popping out of her face crosseyed from the pain and I don't believe there was ever a cross-eyed child that God didn't deliver because brother Bram had real compassion amen amen stand with me tonight put pull
