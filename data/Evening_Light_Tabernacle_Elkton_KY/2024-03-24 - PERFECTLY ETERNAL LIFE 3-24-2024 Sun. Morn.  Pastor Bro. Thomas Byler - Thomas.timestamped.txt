[13:43] good morning good to be in the house of
[13:45] the Lord if we all would
[13:47] stand and the children can be dismissed
[13:50] be dismissed for Sunday
[13:53] school Caleb berer would you open us up
[13:55] in a word of
[13:58] Prayer
[14:17] if we would turn to Psalms
[14:28] 18
[14:39] we'll start with verse 19 and go to 30
[14:42] he brought me forth also into a large
[14:44] place he delivered me because he
[14:46] delighted in
[14:55] me for I have kept the ways of the Lord
[14:58] and have not Wicked L departed from my
[15:06] God I was also upright before him and I
[15:10] kept myself from an
[15:19] iniquity with the merciful thou Wil show
[15:22] thyself merciful with an upright man
[15:25] thou will show thyself
[15:27] upright
[15:35] for thou wil Save The Afflicted people
[15:39] but will bring down high
[15:46] looks for by thee have I run through a
[15:48] troop and by my God have I leaped over a
[15:51] wall as for God his way is perfect the
[15:55] word of the Lord is tried be a butler to
[15:58] all those that trust in him brother
[16:13] Troy amen that's
[16:19] true you you may be
[16:26] seated it's good to be in the house of
[16:28] the Lord this morning morning it's
[16:30] chilly out
[16:34] but thank the Lord for such a wonderful
[16:37] place to come and hear his word
[16:41] um if you'll go with
[16:43] me this little thought and just came to
[16:46] me this week if you go me uh to Exodus
[16:57] 4
[17:03] of course
[17:05] uh the printer didn't want to print this
[17:07] morning again so it prints everything
[17:10] else but on Sunday morning it doesn't
[17:13] print but in Exodus 4 and it's 4
[17:18] and10 and I got this little thought
[17:20] because we come up here Austin comes up
[17:22] here and reads and some of the other
[17:23] ones that read and uh read the
[17:25] scriptures and uh it's hard when or I
[17:29] guess some people it might be a gift for
[17:30] them maybe they it's not hard to do
[17:32] speaking for some people but for some
[17:34] people it's harder to do public speaking
[17:37] in school and whatever it might be I was
[17:39] never a public speaker so sometimes when
[17:41] we read uh different scriptures and
[17:44] stuff it uh our words may come out
[17:48] wrong many of times or said a word wrong
[17:51] or this and that but I thought about
[17:56] Moses here in Exodus 4 and it starts in
[17:59] verse 10 and it said and Moses said unto
[18:02] the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent
[18:04] neither there here unto or neither here
[18:07] for
[18:08] to two4 nor since thou Hast spoken unto
[18:14] thy servant but I am slow speech and of
[18:16] a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him
[18:20] who hath made man's mouth or who ha make
[18:22] it or who maketh the dumb or death or
[18:25] the seeing or the blind have not I the
[18:29] Lord now therefore go and I will be with
[18:32] thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt
[18:34] say and it got me to
[18:37] thinking um you know we always want to
[18:39] do our best we always try to do our best
[18:42] but we're just human and we make make
[18:45] many mistakes and so that's not an
[18:46] excuse for us if if the Lord lays on
[18:48] something on our hearts for something
[18:50] for us to do then we should try to do it
[18:53] to the best of our ability and though we
[18:55] may fail or may mess up at least we'll
[18:59] be doing it for the Lord you know he he
[19:02] he was telling Moses here did I make the
[19:04] mouth to speak and and so forth and so
[19:07] he'll be with us and that's that's who
[19:09] we
[19:10] need then it got me to thinking of you
[19:12] know how uh God never picked the great
[19:15] and big and fancy stuff he always well
[19:19] as brother Tom was preaching on
[19:20] Wednesday night you know it was simple
[19:23] and talking about Paul you know when he
[19:26] would he was knocked down to the dust
[19:29] Paul had to forget everything he ever uh
[19:31] learned as far as
[19:33] being uh taught in the ways of all that
[19:37] he was taught he had to forget all that
[19:38] he was knocked down to the dust and that
[19:40] quote really stood out where brother Tom
[19:42] said when we raise up out of that dust
[19:44] that's where we you know make a mistake
[19:46] we'll have to get knocked back down to
[19:47] that dust again but it got me to
[19:50] thinking and I just seen this uh some of
[19:54] this scripture up here this morning but
[19:56] talking about when Jesus you know would
[19:59] come Isaiah painted a picture of what he
[20:01] would be and this is Isaiah 53 can go
[20:05] with me if you want to and follow along
[20:07] with me if you want
[20:09] to but it's the verse of Isaiah 53 and
[20:11] some of that was on portion of it was up
[20:13] on the screen this morning but this is
[20:15] Isaiah painting a picture of what Jesus
[20:18] will be when he
[20:20] comes I was talking to the kids this
[20:23] week and saying you know if we would
[20:26] have picked how we would have came we
[20:29] would have picked it to be fancy we
[20:31] would have pick it to be if we got chose
[20:34] what we would come like if we would have
[20:35] been strong and and all these different
[20:38] things would have came in riches but
[20:40] this is Isaiah painting a picture or of
[20:42] how Jesus would come and it's starting
[20:45] in verse one he says who hath believed a
[20:48] report and to whom is the arm of the
[20:50] Lord revealed for he shall grow up
[20:52] before him as a tender plant as a root
[20:55] out of a dry ground and he had no no
[20:58] form cess and when we shall see him
[21:01] there's no beauty that we should desire
[21:02] him wasn't a great looking man to look
[21:06] at didn't have muscles
[21:09] poping out
[21:11] everywhere very simple he is despised
[21:14] and rejected a man a man of Sorrows and
[21:18] acquainted with grief we hid as were our
[21:20] faces from him he was despised and we
[21:23] esteemed him
[21:24] not surely he hath borne our griefs and
[21:27] carried our sorrows yet we did to see
[21:29] him strick and smitten a God and
[21:33] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[21:36] transgressions he was proved for our
[21:39] iniquities this is talking about us all
[21:42] we like like sheep have gone astray we
[21:45] have turned everyone to his own way the
[21:47] Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[21:50] all he was oppressed he was afflicted
[21:53] yet he opened not his mouth he has
[21:55] brought as a lamb to the slaughter and
[21:57] as a sheep to a sheep before her shears
[22:00] is dumb so he open it not his mouth he
[22:03] was taken from the prison and from
[22:05] judgment who shall declare his
[22:07] generation trouble he had all all the
[22:11] while he was here on Earth for he was
[22:12] cut off out of the land of the living
[22:14] for the transgression of my people was
[22:15] he
[22:19] stricken and it goes on to say he made a
[22:21] grave he made his grave with the wicked
[22:22] went the rich in his death because he
[22:24] had done no violence neither was any
[22:26] deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the
[22:29] Lord to bruise him he he ha put him to
[22:33] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[22:35] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[22:37] and he shall prolong his days and the
[22:39] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[22:40] his hand he shall see all he shall see
[22:43] of the travail of his soul shall be
[22:45] satisfied and by by his knowledge shall
[22:48] my righteous servant justify many for he
[22:52] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[22:54] will I divide him a portion with the
[22:55] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[22:57] the strong because he had poured out his
[22:59] soul un death he was numbered with the
[23:02] transgressors and he Bears the sin of
[23:04] many made intercessions for TR for Trans
[23:07] the
[23:08] transgressors
[23:10] speaking never came in a fancy way never
[23:13] had the one man asked him where where
[23:16] does he live he said he the foxes have
[23:18] dens the bird have nests but he doesn't
[23:20] have a place to lay his head when he was
[23:22] born he didn't come down on a golden
[23:24] escalator from Heaven he was born over a
[23:27] manure po in a in a barn a little stable
[23:31] the most humble of ways he came as a
[23:34] baby so it just made me think of how God
[23:38] does stuff he doesn't always do stuff in
[23:40] the brightest and the shiniest ways here
[23:42] on Earth but he uses the humble and the
[23:44] meek and he uses the really lowly
[23:48] types and he doesn't maybe well we know
[23:52] for a fact he doesn't go get the
[23:54] fanciest people that's educated in the
[23:56] highest and fanciest schools
[23:59] Maybe Harvard and yel but he'll might
[24:01] take a Kentucky o belly or Kentucky Kian
[24:04] born in uh a little cabin somewhere and
[24:08] make something or out of his life and
[24:10] and use him as the the angel the seventh
[24:13] angel
[24:15] messenger so uh so so are
[24:20] we um brother Brandon
[24:23] was got this out of the six
[24:26] seal in 63 brother Brenham said so this
[24:30] made me think how Jesus came and then
[24:32] this made me think of how his bride will
[24:34] be too which is going to be us so so it
[24:38] starts in U so this young girl puts on a
[24:42] regular Western carry-on for this boy
[24:44] and when he came and when he come out
[24:47] each one of them was sure they was going
[24:49] to get this boy there was a little
[24:51] cousin there on the ranch and she was an
[24:52] orphan and so she just done all the work
[24:55] for these because they had to have their
[24:57] fingernails fixed and you know and they
[24:59] couldn't wash the dishes for the hands
[25:00] and things she done all the real hard
[25:03] work and then finally when the boy came
[25:06] they went out and got him in an old
[25:08] western style the Buckboard and they
[25:10] come down shooting their guns and
[25:12] carrying on you know and acting up and
[25:14] that night they had a great big dance
[25:16] out there oldfashioned dance and all the
[25:18] ranchers around about and uh and coming
[25:21] and with their dancing and so forth and
[25:23] first thing you
[25:24] know was he went on was ju Jubilee for
[25:28] two or three days and one night this boy
[25:30] stepped out to the little place just to
[25:33] rest a while from the dance and got away
[25:35] from these girls and he happened to look
[25:37] going down towards the cor Corral there
[25:40] went a little girl kind of a ragged
[25:42] looking she had a dish pan full of water
[25:45] she washed dishes and she and he thought
[25:48] I never seen her before I wonder where
[25:49] she come from so she just puts it in his
[25:53] way to go around beside so he just puts
[25:56] it in his way to go around beside of the
[25:58] Funk house and go down there and come
[26:00] back at the side of the crow and met her
[26:02] she was barefooted she she stopped She
[26:05] held her head down she seen who it was
[26:08] and she was very shy she knew this great
[26:10] person she was and she was just a cousin
[26:13] to these other girls their father was a
[26:15] foreman on the big AR armor outfit so
[26:18] they kept so they kept she kept looking
[26:20] down she was ashamed of being barefooted
[26:23] he said what's your name she told him
[26:26] said why why ain't out there to where
[26:29] the rest of them is and she kind of made
[26:31] excuses and so the next night he watched
[26:33] her again finally he was sitting out
[26:36] there and they all got to carrying on
[26:38] everything sit on the Corral Fence and
[26:40] watched for her to come throw the
[26:42] dishwash dishwater out and he watched
[26:45] her and he said to her he said you know

[29:57] minutes he'll be here here they just
[29:59] laughed at her just about the time Old
[30:01] Clock ticked up to 5 minutes and they
[30:02] heard the horse Galloping sand rolling
[30:04] under the wheels the old Buckboard
[30:06] stopped she jumped up from between them
[30:08] and out the door and she jumped out of
[30:10] the carriage and she flew into his arms
[30:12] he said it's all over now honey left her
[30:14] little old cousin denomination sitting

[30:30] brother to me right now in these seals
[30:32] breaking like this he said under the
[30:33] supernatural thing I can almost hear the
[30:35] sound and that clock and time taks away
[30:37] into
[30:39] eternity I can almost see that angel
[30:41] standing there and saying at the last of
[30:43] that seventh angel messenger time shall
[30:45] be no more that little loyal bride will
[30:48] fly away into the Arms of Jesus one of
[30:50] these
[30:51] days and be taken to the father's house
[30:54] let's think of these things as we're
[30:56] going along now he said
[30:58] and how true that is and in every
[31:02] age times got to be getting short
[31:07] people if Jesus said in the scripture
[31:10] there he said when you see these things
[31:12] happening he said look up for your
[31:13] Redemption draw
[31:14] nine and the way the world's going it's
[31:17] crumbling so we better start looking up

[1:08:59] uh we'll have more time for him to
[1:09:02] preach or have an altar call or whatever
[1:09:04] he feels like doing amen and then also I
[1:09:07] was talking to my wife they're going to
[1:09:08] be here from fi Friday from Friday till
[1:09:12] Wednesday so they're going to be here
[1:09:13] about four or five days I thought it'd
[1:09:15] be nice if uh maybe we could uh maybe
[1:09:18] get a little potluck or little food
[1:09:20] together for them with while they're
[1:09:22] here that way they don't have to go out
[1:09:23] and shop too much so so uh my wife has
[1:09:27] said that you know we'll try to maybe
[1:09:29] take some over there on Saturday they're
[1:09:31] going to come in on a Friday night and
[1:09:33] leave on a Wednesday so if they come in
[1:09:35] on a Friday night maybe take them a
[1:09:36] little bit of food on Saturday amen and
[1:09:39] then again maybe a little bit of food on
[1:09:41] Monday so if you want to bring them
[1:09:43] something uh Brother Brad if you would
[1:09:45] maybe find out what kind of food they
[1:09:47] like all right find out what kind of
[1:09:49] food they like so that we know kind of
[1:09:51] what to fix and then we'll get a list of
[1:09:52] stuff to make amen and that way they're
[1:09:55] here we can show them a little bit of
[1:09:57] Kentucky hospitality would that be okay
[1:10:00] amen and and so that they can have
[1:10:01] plenty of food and also if you want to
[1:10:03] have them for supper or whatever I know
[1:10:05] we want to have them over at our place
[1:10:06] at least once if you want to have them
[1:10:08] fellowship with them or supper get in
[1:10:10] contact with M and Donna amen and that
[1:10:13] way not everybody's inviting them or man
[1:10:17] as you heard probably Wednesday God give
[1:10:19] us a good trip up toio last weekend amen
[1:10:21] and one thing I didn't mention and and
[1:10:24] I'll I'll say I'll say this remember
[1:10:26] when I told you Wednesday night about uh
[1:10:29] bringing out that scripture he that is
[1:10:31] born of God does not commit sin for his
[1:10:33] SE remaineth in him amen and I told you
[1:10:35] up there I never explained what it ever
[1:10:37] meant so I imagined they thinking hey he
[1:10:39] believes that somebody born of God he
[1:10:41] don't he's just perfect he never makes a
[1:10:42] failure at all amen but the point was
[1:10:46] it's what God's word says whether you
[1:10:48] understand it or not it's Our obligation
[1:10:51] to believe what the Bible says amen and
[1:10:54] so but but the the point of it is and
[1:10:56] when I was making it there and I wish I
[1:10:58] would have but I guess for a purpose God
[1:10:59] helped me from it but even Wednesday I
[1:11:01] didn't we all understand if you know the
[1:11:03] message you all understand how many
[1:11:05] understands what scure
[1:11:10] means a lot of you don't know what that
[1:11:12] scripture means he that is born of God
[1:11:15] does not commit sin for his seed
[1:11:18] remaineth in him for he cannot sin for
[1:11:20] he is born of God Amen well brother
[1:11:23] brandom explained that
[1:11:25] amen and I remember when I was at the
[1:11:27] Saw Shop I was testing Sam golden and
[1:11:30] John steeman on it I says do you believe
[1:11:31] that scripture and because I had tested
[1:11:33] others just to see if they believe the
[1:11:35] scripture contrary to anything and so
[1:11:37] others are no no no we don't well you
[1:11:41] know I don't understand the de it but
[1:11:43] God said where it says it and I remember
[1:11:45] Sam golden smiling at me he says yeah
[1:11:47] that's nothing but the truth a child of
[1:11:50] God can't disbelieve the word that sin
[1:11:53] is unbelief amen a real son and daughter
[1:11:57] of God can't disbelieve the word even
[1:11:59] Paul said nobody can speak by the Holy
[1:12:01] Ghost can call Jesus to curse amen those
[1:12:05] words won't come out of your mouth
[1:12:06] because Holy Ghost won't say those words
[1:12:08] amen and God Holy Spirit like brother
[1:12:11] Braham said God's spirit will believe
[1:12:13] the Bible amen you say you got the Holy
[1:12:16] Ghost and you deny this it's something
[1:12:19] else you got amen but anyway so that's
[1:12:22] what it means what the what the prophet
[1:12:24] of God said but it was and that un that
[1:12:27] sin is unbelief amen you cannot
[1:12:30] disbelieve a child of God cannot
[1:12:35] amen I'm not here to just start
[1:12:37] preaching but if something else comes to
[1:12:39] my mind on that amen and that is uh uh
[1:12:43] the prophet of God also taught us that
[1:12:45] that uh where the scripture says he that
[1:12:48] sins willfully after receiving the N of
[1:12:50] the truth that remaineth no more
[1:12:52] sacrifice for sin ain't that right amen
[1:12:56] and same thing as blasphemy against the
[1:12:58] Holy Ghost butam says a child of God
[1:13:01] can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost won't BL
[1:13:03] him the go ghost why because God won't
[1:13:06] let him amen because he won't lose one
[1:13:08] of his isn't that right because if there
[1:13:10] was any blasphemy if there was ever
[1:13:12] anybody that's worthy of uh that type of
[1:13:17] uh condemnation it was the Apostle Paul
[1:13:20] amen because he stood there and
[1:13:22] consented to the stoning of stepen and
[1:13:24] he was very harsh against the works of
[1:13:27] the Holy Ghost Paul
[1:13:30] was
[1:13:32] amen and I like what I heard the
[1:13:34] preacher say and it was true sometimes
[1:13:35] it seems like God punishes certain
[1:13:37] people for the same thing somebody else
[1:13:40] does he don't punish the
[1:13:44] others I got your attention
[1:13:46] now and you know why because God knows
[1:13:50] the
[1:13:51] heart God knows the heart and what did
[1:13:54] Paul say what was the reason that God
[1:13:56] didn't impute the sin to
[1:14:00] Paul because he said he did it in his
[1:14:04] ignorance that's right so God judges in
[1:14:07] he aren't you glad that God is the judge
[1:14:10] amen praise the Lord one more thing I
[1:14:12] wanted to say on the behalf of that is
[1:14:15] that the good thing that came out of
[1:14:17] last week and they in up in Ohio was was
[1:14:19] the fact not only the fact that uh uh
[1:14:22] you know we got to speak to that many
[1:14:24] but brother leev has given us an open
[1:14:26] opportunity would like for us to come
[1:14:28] once a month and Minister up there amen
[1:14:30] so and I know my cousins and some of
[1:14:32] them you know said they would come you
[1:14:34] know whenever I come they would come so
[1:14:36] am me not just them but maybe others so
[1:14:38] it's just kind of an open door for us
[1:14:40] and we really appreciate that we're very
[1:14:42] thankful for it amen amen I like doors
[1:14:45] God opens don't you I want God to open
[1:14:47] doors you know and sometimes we try to
[1:14:49] make things happen amen but you know we
[1:14:53] want God to make it happen ain't that
[1:14:55] right when God makes it happen it'll be
[1:14:56] done right so praise the Lord God bless
[1:14:59] you this morning amen I uh I want to
[1:15:03] continue Amen on our thought on eternal
[1:15:06] life on eternal life and of course
[1:15:09] Wednesday we talked about to two kinds
[1:15:11] of life that there is am that right two
[1:15:14] kinds of Life the one type of life is
[1:15:16] our natural life that we have amen
[1:15:19] that's found in Galatians me in I
[1:15:22] believe it was U Paul that talked about
[1:15:25] The Works of the flesh he called it the
[1:15:26] works of the Flesh in verse 19 and then
[1:15:29] in verse uh uh 22 he called the fruit of
[1:15:32] the spirit amen the life of the spirit
[1:15:34] is fruit of the spirit so if you will
[1:15:36] stand with me amen we'll just amen
[1:15:39] continue on with our thought amen see
[1:15:41] what the Lord will have I really feel
[1:15:44] like there's certainly a lot more in
[1:15:46] what we could have the direction that we
[1:15:48] could have went Wednesday but I feel
[1:15:49] like to go in this direction today amen
[1:15:51] and I hope that everybody uh enjoyed the
[1:15:55] video that brother Tommy has put
[1:15:57] together this morning of the crucifixion
[1:15:58] I'm enjoyed that up there amen I know
[1:16:01] it's a little
[1:16:03] bloody huh ain't that right it's a
[1:16:06] little bloody for our children it seems
[1:16:08] like but you know if there's anything
[1:16:10] that they should see is knowing from the
[1:16:12] very core of the young child what our
[1:16:15] Lord did for us on Calvary isn't that
[1:16:18] right amen and so this today today's uh
[1:16:22] theme kind of was on the crucifixion of
[1:16:24] Christ
[1:16:25] appreciate how many appreciates brother
[1:16:26] Tommy and Tammy and all the work they do
[1:16:29] to put this together let's give them a
[1:16:31] hand appreciate
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:35] it amen and then of course next weekend
[1:16:38] he still have on the resurrection so I
[1:16:40] don't know what that's all going to be
[1:16:41] but amen we're thankful for what the did
[1:16:44] Lord did and how he suffered for us and
[1:16:46] and really part of that death to self
[1:16:49] and dying to self we'll speak on we
[1:16:51] spoke on Wednesday and also this morning
[1:16:54] and this morning really is kind of a
[1:16:56] resurrection type of me message amen an
[1:16:59] Easter kind of message but anyway we
[1:17:02] just want to follow the leading of the
[1:17:04] spirit amen amen let's bow our heads
[1:17:06] Lord Jesus we come before you so
[1:17:08] grateful God that we can bow our heads
[1:17:10] to the dust God that you brought us from
[1:17:12] Lord Jesus and then Lord you quickened
[1:17:15] us father in our souls Lord you had put
[1:17:17] a seed father in every one of our souls
[1:17:20] God and Lord you quickened that spirit
[1:17:22] and that Soul father to eternal life
[1:17:25] life to your spirit Lord Jesus and you
[1:17:27] filled us with your spirit give us
[1:17:29] eternal life Lord Jesus we want to talk
[1:17:31] about that this morning with the help
[1:17:33] with your help Father and we ask God
[1:17:35] that you just get us out of the way now
[1:17:37] Lord and speak the words that you want
[1:17:38] spoken today and bless each one that has
[1:17:41] loved you enough this morning to come
[1:17:43] into your house Lord and we ask God
[1:17:45] you'll bless them Lord with being able
[1:17:47] to have a closer walk with you Lord when
[1:17:49] we leave this this place this morning
[1:17:51] for we ask it in Jesus name amen and
[1:17:54] amen amen
[1:17:56] amen we will turn if your bibles if you
[1:17:59] will and I'd like to read I guess the
[1:18:01] same scriptures that we read Amen in the
[1:18:04] beginning uh Wednesday night amen and we
[1:18:07] want to talk not so much amen perhaps
[1:18:10] it'll it'll kind of blend in amen but
[1:18:12] talking about the first life that I
[1:18:14] didn't even read about but maybe we'll
[1:18:16] we will in a minute uh and uh St Mark 8
[1:18:21] and verse 34
[1:18:26] it says and when he had called the
[1:18:28] people unto him with his disciples also
[1:18:30] he said unto them whosoever will come
[1:18:32] after me let him deny himself take up
[1:18:35] his cross and follow me for whosoever
[1:18:38] will save his life shall lose it but
[1:18:40] whosoever shall lose his life for my
[1:18:42] sake and the gospels the same shall save
[1:18:44] it amen for what shall a man profit
[1:18:47] profited what shall it profit a man if
[1:18:50] he shall gain the whole world and lose
[1:18:51] his own soul or what will a man give in
[1:18:54] exchange for his soul amen may God add
[1:18:57] His blessings to the reading of the word
[1:18:59] you can be seated this morning amen I
[1:19:02] ask a question Wednesday on what the
[1:19:03] answer to that is and that I to you know
[1:19:06] to the best of my understanding the
[1:19:08] answer Amen to what a man will give in
[1:19:11] exchange would be
[1:19:13] himself amen himself because in one case
[1:19:17] you can have your own life and I don't
[1:19:19] believe that brother uh that Jesus
[1:19:21] Christ was necessarily talking about
[1:19:23] just giving your life as father are
[1:19:25] sacrificing it amen perhaps into through
[1:19:27] the Dark Ages by eating being eaten by a
[1:19:29] lion which no doubt but that would also
[1:19:31] probably have a major bearing but
[1:19:34] because those people would not give
[1:19:35] their lives without the love of God but
[1:19:37] to actually die to self ain't that right
[1:19:40] to be born again we understand is die to
[1:19:44] ourself and our own ways and our own
[1:19:47] thoughts and our own
[1:19:48] ideas our very own life he that hateth
[1:19:51] not his own life also Jesus said is not
[1:19:54] worth worthy to be my
[1:19:56] disciples amen and we spoke much on that
[1:19:59] self part amen but on the other hand
[1:20:02] amen we know that God came to give us
[1:20:05] eternal life how many believes that Amen
[1:20:08] in uh St John verse uh chapter 6 I
[1:20:12] believe it is in verse 35 I'll just read
[1:20:15] and Jesus said unto them I am the bread
[1:20:16] of life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:20:19] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[1:20:21] never thirst but I say said unto you
[1:20:25] that ye also have seen me and believe
[1:20:27] not all that the father giveth me shall
[1:20:30] come to me how many believes that I like
[1:20:33] that amen and him that cometh to me will
[1:20:36] I in no wise cast
[1:20:39] out oh my I'll tell you what we could
[1:20:42] preach for a month on people who start
[1:20:46] and don't finish we could talk about
[1:20:48] people who have done and do great deeds
[1:20:50] and perhaps even get the baptism of the
[1:20:53] Holy Ghost on their flesh and on their
[1:20:55] Spirit they can speak in tongues and
[1:20:57] they can cast out Devils they can do all
[1:20:59] these things and still
[1:21:02] fail to get it amen so there is there is
[1:21:06] a lot of people that run in the race
[1:21:09] start in the race there's a lot in that
[1:21:11] category but there is a category amen
[1:21:15] how many believe there is a category
[1:21:17] that will not be
[1:21:23] lost and it's
[1:21:26] scary it's
[1:21:29] scary to think of the millions that do
[1:21:33] start and don't
[1:21:35] finish First Corinthians I believe it is
[1:21:39] amen and uh Paul talked about like
[1:21:42] Israel isn't that right he talked about
[1:21:44] Israel who was an example of people who
[1:21:46] came out of Egypt isn't that right but
[1:21:48] we're overthrown in the wilderness don't
[1:21:50] be like that you know and and we tempted
[1:21:53] they were tempted and tempted God and
[1:21:55] they murmured and they complained and
[1:21:57] out of two million people brother Woody
[1:22:01] two
[1:22:05] million two one two two people go
[1:22:12] in no not three four five six seven oh
[1:22:17] two out of the original
[1:22:22] Bunch why do I smile
[1:22:25] cuz if God has got a hold of
[1:22:29] you and you go through all these things
[1:22:32] and you're still faithful and loving God
[1:22:35] you ought to be the happiest person in
[1:22:38] the
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:42] world what that ought to do to us this
[1:22:52] morning amen grace that brought me safe
[1:22:56] thus far it'll be Grace that'll take me
[1:23:00] safely
[1:23:01] home
[1:23:03] my glory my praise be to
[1:23:09] God oh my when you think about that God
[1:23:13] never have me don't never let me be a
[1:23:16] murmurer and a
[1:23:18] complainer don't never let me be
[1:23:21] dissatisfied with Christen that's right
[1:23:25] discontent it's a horrible thing Paul
[1:23:29] could go through what he did and have
[1:23:32] much and have little and be cold and be
[1:23:34] in prison and could say I've learned you
[1:23:37] know I can do all things through Christ
[1:23:40] which strengtheneth me I can be in
[1:23:42] whatever state that I what God puts me
[1:23:45] I've learned that in whatever state I am
[1:23:49] there with to be happy content come on
[1:23:55] amen we want to talk to you with the
[1:23:57] help of the Lord this morning on the
[1:23:59] divine nature what eternal life is what
[1:24:03] eternal life does what eternal life
[1:24:06] doesn't do there's so much until I know
[1:24:09] we're going to just have a series out of
[1:24:11] it we're just going to go as far as we
[1:24:13] can would that be
[1:24:14] okay all right my so now notice here he
[1:24:18] says um all that the father giveth me
[1:24:21] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:24:23] me with I in no
[1:24:26] wise cast out woo Glory I'll be with you

[1:30:02] take you and tie you to a post and burn
[1:30:05] you alive which one would you
[1:30:07] take afterwards you get eternal life but
[1:30:10] the 10,000 years of ruling that's the
[1:30:13] end then and you're cast off but says

[1:30:27] burning we'll take the lion death we'll
[1:30:29] take the sword over a life of
[1:30:33] pleasure cuz that the eternal life that
[1:30:35] we have is more valuable than
[1:30:44] anything I can hear him we gave our
[1:30:48] lives we died we suffered we was burned
[1:30:52] we was driven through through the sword
[1:30:54] we were fed the

[1:31:01] a little bit here and this Le out of age
[1:31:04] that we have come on
[1:31:07] folks we can't do the simple things that

[1:31:37] want I want more of Jesus more and more

[1:33:32] partakers of the
[1:33:35] divine

[1:33:41] change we needed a nature change we
[1:33:43] still need a little bit more of a nature
[1:33:50] change amen our first nature was the
[1:33:53] works of the
[1:33:55] flesh adultery selfishness fornication
[1:33:58] selfishness uncleanness selfishness

[1:35:36] baptism the Holy Ghost when you get
[1:35:37] saved when you get eternal life you get
[1:35:40] caught up into a whole different
[1:35:46] atmosphere it's a Heavenly atmosphere I
[1:35:48] was thinking you know every one of us
[1:35:50] tomorrow we'll have to go back and toil
[1:35:52] anden we'll have our problem willever
[1:35:54] breakdown willever rainy days whatever
[1:35:56] lows and our highs and so forth but
[1:35:58] aren't you glad that sometimes on a
[1:36:00] Sunday morning Amen on Words tonight you
[1:36:02] can come and you leave all your cares at
[1:36:04] the door and forget about your worries
[1:36:07] and come up in Heavenly places and chist

[1:36:12] and baptize me people with the Holy
[1:36:14] Ghost you got shouting you got do you
[1:36:17] got W screaming and
[1:36:22] hard huh aren't you glad for a little
[1:36:25] Refuge once in a
[1:36:31] while just comes to mind but we can
[1:36:35] still sit there with all kinds of cares
[1:36:37] all kinds of
[1:36:38] worries cuz see being in that Heavenly
[1:36:41] atmosphere it's not about being in this
[1:36:44] building it's about the condition that
[1:36:46] you're
[1:36:47] in I mean know it shows you every time
[1:36:50] we come to the house of God we find out
[1:36:53] how free we really are how much praying
[1:36:56] that we've done how much of the Holy
[1:36:58] Ghost and how free we really are of
[1:37:01] we're still bound because you can come
[1:37:02] in here bound and you can leave as bound
[1:37:04] as what you came if not a little bit
[1:37:06] more miserable but because you found out
[1:37:07] how that you could be free and you
[1:37:09] really
[1:37:11] aren't is that okay just say what the
[1:37:14] Holy Ghost
[1:37:22] says
[1:37:31] something else just comes to mind
[1:37:33] brother bam says when you get into a
[1:37:34] church and there's fussing and bickering
[1:37:36] and fighting the Holy Ghost is just
[1:37:39] grieved
[1:37:41] way we've all been in services like that
[1:37:44] now haven't we that's right when there's
[1:37:46] bickering fussing you've got carnality
[1:37:48] in there if I got carnality up here
[1:37:51] you're sure going to find out no aren't
[1:37:53] you
[1:37:54] that's right if you got carnality out
[1:37:56] there I'm sure going to feel it the Holy
[1:37:58] Spirit feels
[1:38:00] it that's right and he's grieved away
[1:38:03] cuz you don't m in those
[1:38:06] places can I preach but says the when
[1:38:10] you lose your temper Holy Ghost leave
[1:38:12] but I kind of got a revelation on that
[1:38:14] not hope be attack but you be the
[1:38:17] good amen before you ever get mad the
[1:38:19] Holy Ghost is
[1:38:22] gone cuz how many knows you have to open
[1:38:24] yourself up and decide that you're going
[1:38:26] to get mad and the Holy Ghost don't get
[1:38:27] mad and if he if he's still in there and
[1:38:30] you got mad then that's him he leaves he
[1:38:33] has no part of it you look upon a woman
[1:38:35] who lost after her before you even look
[1:38:37] he's gone cuz he don't do
[1:38:39] that anything that you ought to do is
[1:38:42] contrary to where he G before you ever
[1:38:46] done ain't that right and then you got
[1:38:49] pray God come on back here come Lord I
[1:38:51] Repent aren't you glad for Grace
[1:38:57] amen amen praise the
[1:39:03] Lord
[1:39:07] amen all right we're going to go
[1:39:09] slow that all right we're going to go
[1:39:12] slow because I find out that amen Jesus
[1:39:16] is never in a
[1:39:17] hurry and so I don't want to be in hurry
[1:39:20] and I miss so much I miss so
[1:39:24] much we're not going and get in a
[1:39:27] hurry St John 6th chapter Jesus says
[1:39:30] whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh
[1:39:32] my blood has everlasting life and I
[1:39:35] shall raise him up at the last day amen
[1:39:37] how many believe that another place
[1:39:39] Jesus said well let me just finish my
[1:39:43] story
[1:39:46] here he said and this is the Father's
[1:39:48] will which has sent me that of all that
[1:39:51] he hath given me I should lose nothing
[1:39:55] but should raise it up at the last day
[1:39:58] notice what he said the will of the
[1:40:00] father that sent me is that everybody
[1:40:03] that believes on me I will lose nothing
[1:40:05] but I will raise him up at the last day
[1:40:08] let me believe that now listen to this
[1:40:10] brother bam speaking and possessing all
[1:40:12] things because right on the next page of
[1:40:15] St John there he talks about and I think
[1:40:17] that he said he called it Eternal but
[1:40:20] Braham called it everlasting life maybe
[1:40:23] he did here too but he says whosoever
[1:40:24] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:40:26] hath eternal life and I will raise him
[1:40:30] up at the last day for my flesh is meat
[1:40:33] indeed and my blood is drink indeed he
[1:40:35] that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[1:40:37] blood dwelleth in me and I in him amen
[1:40:41] praise the
[1:40:44] Lord as the living father has sent me
[1:40:47] and I live by the father so he that
[1:40:49] eateth me he shall also live by me and
[1:40:52] this is that bread which came down from
[1:40:54] heaven not as your father should eat men
[1:40:56] and are dead but he that eateth of this
[1:40:59] bread shall live
[1:41:02] forever I mean the primary purpose of
[1:41:04] Christ coming it wasn't just to heal
[1:41:08] you
[1:41:10] hello it was to give you
[1:41:13] eternal
[1:41:15] life eternal life how many believe this
[1:41:18] what we're doing this
[1:41:20] morning what we're doing this morning
[1:41:22] being in church can't really be
[1:41:24] overemphasized how many believes that if
[1:41:26] you'll believe the word of God as it
[1:41:28] comes forth you can actually get eternal
[1:41:32] life and never have an
[1:41:35] end I'm gonna say something there's two
[1:41:38] two people I look watched on YouTube
[1:41:40] talking about their experience about
[1:41:42] going beyond the curtain of time I
[1:41:45] thought about playing it might yet you
[1:41:47] know and and you know whether it's
[1:41:49] really true or not I don't know but the
[1:41:51] one thing I know is that whatever it
[1:41:52] came out out of there they promoted
[1:41:54] Sinners repenting and turning to the
[1:41:56] Lord Jesus Christ so it had the right
[1:41:58] effect but in both of their scenarios he
[1:42:01] said when they were gone beyond the
[1:42:02] curtain of time one was one one one had
[1:42:05] uh what was
[1:42:07] it I'm not sure if it was a heart attack
[1:42:09] and the other one had de seizure but the
[1:42:10] heart attack man he talked about how
[1:42:12] that in the little period of time that
[1:42:14] he was there like 2,000 Souls I believe
[1:42:17] amen uh something in that on that order
[1:42:20] uh went into the regions of the Lost he
[1:42:22] seen that many going into the regions of
[1:42:24] the lost and then he's seen so many
[1:42:26] maybe 50 or something 2% I think it was
[1:42:28] that was going over into glory and you
[1:42:31] know both one thing that both of them
[1:42:33] said and I don't believe that they were
[1:42:35] joined together at all but the one thing
[1:42:37] that they said that caught my attention
[1:42:39] is he said most of the people that were
[1:42:40] in Hell thought they were going to
[1:42:43] heaven they thought they were
[1:42:47] right huh isn't that what the prophet of
[1:42:50] God said on that day going to be a lot
[1:42:52] of disappointments
[1:42:54] lot of disappointments how many knows
[1:42:55] you can't take a chance on your
[1:43:00] soul you make sure that you're sure that
[1:43:04] you're sure that your soul is right and
[1:43:08] ready to go amen how many will do that
[1:43:11] Lord help me to make sure I don't want
[1:43:13] to be
[1:43:14] deceived a tree is known by its fruit
[1:43:18] Ain that right and if we have the fruits
[1:43:21] of that flesh manifesting yet I'm not
[1:43:22] saying saying that you're not saved but
[1:43:24] I'm saying that you need to die some
[1:43:25] more to yourself
[1:43:27] amen now notice but B I'm speaking here
[1:43:30] did you ever think of what you were here
[1:43:32] for like I said going slow what are you
[1:43:35] doing going to school for children what
[1:43:38] are you working for Dad what you get up
[1:43:41] mother of a morning and get the kiddies

[1:44:02] get well and then go and then back and
[1:44:04] then you do it again and every Sunday
[1:44:06] wash their faces and get them to church
[1:44:09] amen and well what's it all about what
[1:44:13] uh he here for is that all there is to
[1:44:16] it m that it be miserable knowing you
[1:44:18] got to go some anywhere anyhow see
[1:44:21] what's it all about oh brother it's an
[1:44:24] examination time it's an opportunity
[1:44:29] time how many believe that we believe
[1:44:32] that we are preaching the final
[1:44:35] message we are the mouthpiece of
[1:44:38] almighty God if that's true at evening
[1:44:41] night Tabernacle and I be a man of God
[1:44:43] the thing that I say heed to him it can

[1:49:04] to his last took a
[1:49:06] pcture of it I'll just quote it the best
[1:49:08] I can he said the world is getting into
[1:49:10] such a condition anymore if we go much
[1:49:13] longer the whole world will be
[1:49:15] completely he said if the world will be
[1:49:17] an insane
[1:49:19] Institute I believe that's the way he
[1:49:21] put it and I thought he last message
[1:49:23] upon the face of the Earth he says watch
[1:49:25] whole world go
[1:49:29] insane boy I wish I could read that
[1:49:31] quote on the national television

[1:54:15] was eternal the Eternal one these things
[1:54:18] that's happening now are only the
[1:54:21] attributes of God
[1:54:26] thinking I'm thinking it was communion
[1:54:28] he says he talked he was talking to a
[1:54:30] lady or a young girl the way she was
[1:54:32] dressed and where he was s and all of
[1:54:34] that he says God knew that before there
[1:54:36] was one star usus created how about us
[1:54:39] this evening or this afternoon it's
[1:54:42] afternoon how many beli he knew where
[1:54:45] you'd he knew what you dress what you'd
[1:54:49] wear I'm funny I'm funny whenever I go

[1:55:23] he knew this would happen before it ever
[1:55:27] started you know what
[1:55:30] that gives me comforting to know that if
[1:55:33] he knows this and this was ordained of
[1:55:34] God your day tomorrow is planned of
[1:55:38] God your day next week your week next

[1:55:55] worry in the world we've got to get this
[1:55:58] fear and this scare away from the people
[1:56:01] of God brother man
[1:56:05] said if you've got eternal life then you
[1:56:07] always
[1:56:11] was oh
[1:56:13] my listen let me get to
[1:56:16] it do you think that's happening at
[1:56:20] first it was just a thought and then a
[1:56:21] word
[1:56:23] when a word is expressed then it's
[1:56:24] spoken how many knows and God's word can
[1:56:28] never be
[1:56:29] broken Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:56:31] but his word shall not pass away I
[1:56:35] wanted to talk to you sometime on the
[1:56:37] solidity of God's word and how that the
[1:56:40] word of God solidifies you makes you
[1:56:44] solid how many's glad for that
[1:56:47] amen when a thought is expressed and
[1:56:50] spoken it happens the whole thing is God
[1:56:51] and holding himself in his attributes
[1:56:54] and then God being made material
[1:56:56] tangible could talk to speak with his
[1:56:58] whole church body Therefore your name
[1:57:01] was in his thinking that's how you have
[1:57:03] eternal life you can't have it no other
[1:57:06] way if you've got eternal life you
[1:57:10] always
[1:57:18] was we just can't quite grasp that
[1:57:23] I don't think our little fin M grabs it
[1:57:25] but I'll tell you what when I do just
[1:57:26] get a little glimpse of it causes me to
[1:57:29] want to jump flip do a back
[1:57:34] flip just kidding I'd break my neck if I
[1:57:37] tried something like
[1:57:42] that makes you feel like it yeah the
[1:57:46] thing that you always was but how was
[1:57:48] you always cuz you know you wasn't
[1:57:51] preexist
[1:57:52] istent you was only pre-existent
[1:57:55] according to prophet in the mind of
[1:58:00] God you're being however there's a
[1:58:03] certain portion of you as any thoughts
[1:58:05] isn't that right let me tell you
[1:58:08] something the only way that you did
[1:58:14] pre-exist the only way I'm sounding
[1:58:17] contradictory but the only way that you
[1:58:20] did preexist
[1:58:23] was that if you have the Holy Ghost a't
[1:58:25] that right you're part of that Holy
[1:58:27] Ghost that Holy Ghost never did begin
[1:58:30] and it is a portion of
[1:58:34] him you existed in his
[1:58:40] Spirit you are part of his Spirit you
[1:58:43] existed in
[1:58:47] him

[1:58:53] that's how you have eternal
[1:58:58] life anything that was eternal never did
[1:59:00] begin and cannot end so you were only in
[1:59:04] his thinking your name and so forth now

[2:01:38] there was any Stardust before
[2:01:41] anything Brother Brad not just Adam amen
[2:01:45] not just to
[2:01:48] Adam I think somebody asked well brother
[2:01:52] said his Billy Paul ask him he says well
[2:01:53] when did God
[2:01:55] begin when did God begin doesn't he have
[2:01:58] to have a beginning he said brother BR
[2:02:00] says no he never never never never had a
[2:02:04] beginning so back there before the
[2:02:06] beginning before the beginning
[2:02:08] before way way back there you always was
[2:02:13] you was
[2:02:15] there you was
[2:02:20] there w doesn't that do something for
[2:02:23] you to think that you was
[2:02:27] there and when he come to Calvary and
[2:02:30] and he died on the cross you died with
[2:02:32] him you was with him you believed him
[2:02:35] when he spoke his word he they said to
[2:02:37] the Pharisees you my word has no place
[2:02:39] in you there for you're not my children
[2:02:43] but your God's word has a place in your
[2:02:45] heart therefore you are his children you
[2:02:48] were there when he preached you were
[2:02:50] there when he died you were there when
[2:02:51] he went to hell and you are there when
[2:02:53] he

[2:03:34] but I like to try it almost blows my
[2:03:38] fuse when I think where did God
[2:03:46] begin you see atheists and people that
[2:03:49] don't believe God just can't fathom in
[2:03:52] their mind that there could be more
[2:03:55] stars that he created out there than
[2:03:57] there is sand upon the face of the Earth
[2:03:59] isn't that right brother there's more
[2:04:02] stars than there is sand the sand dunes
[2:04:06] of Arizona and all of that there's more
[2:04:08] stars than there is
[2:04:09] that for God for a being to never have
[2:04:13] began they just they can't no I just
[2:04:15] can't believe there is such a being but
[2:04:18] I do how many I believe
[2:04:20] it I believe
[2:04:23] that and amen there was even people even
[2:04:26] religious people all the days of
[2:04:27] Miracles has passed they ain't nobody
[2:04:30] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:31] can we say the church world was failing
[2:04:34] to believe even their faith was
[2:04:37] believing with was was swaying their
[2:04:39] faith was going down and then God had to
[2:04:41] bring a prophet amen and pre a message
[2:04:44] to same
[2:04:46] yesterday today and
[2:04:50] forever oh if I can shouted I want to
