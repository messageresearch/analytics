preeminence in every portion of the service tonight father but we ask it in Jesus name amen amen amen good to have brother Russell with us praise the Lord amen amen you all remember when brother bam went out west you know and he thought he was a cowboy right right and he rode them you know went to riding them horses and all of that and this one Rider you know they gave him so much to ride that horse and my they took him out in an ambulance blood coming out of every part of his head I guess you know and and the guy comes up to a different Cowboys and says are you a rider you a rider came to b b are you a rider he say no sir I'm not a rider amen I thought I was a carpenter until I met brother Russell that's when I realized hey you ain't no carp I'm not no carpene you ever work with that guy right there he's almost my age and he worked me in the ground I don't know how they built that house so fast I've never even seen anything go up that fast before amen but there are some kind of Carpenters now I'm here to tell you and so we appreciate him amen always good to see you brother amen God bless you and fine Christian folks it's the best part of it amen amen so it's good to have you God bless your family amen and uh we're praying that uh Austin Serenity amen you're not far from it right almost ready to get in there oh my that's got to be exciting amen so praise the Lord amen God bless you richly tonight and amen so God is good amen God is good stand with me if you will read the word of God we'll just get into the word and see what the Lord will have for us this evening let's turn our Bibles amen we'll start amen over in Ephesians Ephesians three and tonight I want to speak to us on how to be a stronger Christian amen closer to God Amen if I'm not wrong I didn't have enough time to look it up there but uh and I'm thinking that brother Bram talked about an older couple in the Amen in the church that was there and he says if there'd be one thing that he would ask them amen if they have a desire for and I believe it was closer to God Amen they want to be closer to God and I believe as long as we're here amen we're always going to want to be closer to God aren't we amen we're going to be wantan to be stronger in God closer to God amen amen how many believes that one day perhaps we won't have to desire that anymore y'all caught that didn't you amen because we'll be with God Amen we'll be right there with God Amen wow how many's looking forward to that amen that's our expectation isn't it that's what we're looking forward to amen amen praise the Lord amen all right so Ephesians 3 and we'll begin with verse 14 for for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened amen amen with might by his spirit in the Inner Man amen I titled this amen um strengthening the inner man amen that you might be that was his whole heart's desire wasn't it that Christ verse 17 might dwell in your hearts by faith and ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to the know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God the next scripture is in 10 Ephesians 6 and 10 few pages [Music] over finally my brethren be strong amen be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might amen put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil amen third scripture is in Hebrews the book of Hebrews the fth chapter Hebrews 5 and verse 13 He was talking about being needing to be teachers and so forth I believe it is 5 and 14 for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of yous have their senses exercised to both discern good and evil may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated amen praise the lord well amen I don't know about you but I just always enjoy being able to have some time out amen for us all to take a little time out just to focus and to meditate on the Lord to talk about the Lord amen amen one place brother bam talked about brother El brother I think it was brother or Neville and his church would just you know he says man you just about the time you get going you quit he says we are ought to have go a little bit longer look amen he really believed in it you know because whenever you talk about the Lord he said you know like those disciples coming from the road of EMAs they were talking about him and he says whenever you talk about him he draws close how many beli that when we preach about him when we bring his word with begin it draws him in amen amen and that's what we want that what we want is for the Holy Spirit to just come down and come on the waves I heard him say come down on the waves and just saturate every heart come down in a special way move and draw us closer to him amen we want to be stronger Christians by the help and grace of God I was going to and I think I actually I'm not sure if I hit print or not but he says you know doesn't matter how smart you are how many phds you have and all these other stuff and how he says and even know the Bible until you can rehearse it until until you have a dictionary you can recite the dictionary he says that's not going to bring you closer to God he says but a humble surrendered con created heart is what will bring you closer to God amen amen that's what we will know in this coming year amen in this coming year we just I thought maybe this would be a good second sermon Amen in this year amen of uh how that we might be closer and stronger because Paul certainly desired of us to be a stronger amen and that we might be strengthened Amen in the Inner Man amen how many knows on the out side man amen the only way you'll ever get stronger is if you exercise is that right and so if that true for the outside man it's true of the inside man amen people that never exercise their faith they're not going to be very strong amen and all these things have to be exercised and we appreciate that amen it'll make you stronger amen and that's what we want praise be to God amen amen wow so so there's a lot of areas we can go and we don't know just how far we'll go but amen we certainly uh want to take just a quote amen and I I couldn't hardly find this and when I did I was thankful but I wanted to take an experience of brother brandham as an illustration to start with this morning amen this evening with the help of the Lord and then we'll go and of course we can talk about Abraham who was not weak in faith you know but was strong giving God glory how many believes that Abraham was strong in faith amen but let me just read the quote brother bam says I was standing the other day at Lake Michigan and I went over to Lake Superior on my road to Canada that large body of water I stood there and I thought many miles is is it is across this great straight of water and then after I crossed Lake Michigan and then was Lake Superior and I would come into Michigan almost an equal body of water from Lake Superior to Lake Michigan and from from Michigan to Lake Ontario and uron and all the Lakes together and many how many billion times billions time billions of innumerable barrels of freshwater lays within that Lake Amen brother bam he could pick up a cigarette and preach a message on it couldn't he he could look at a lake and begin to preach a message on it amen amen I'm glad that we still have the inspiration to be able to preach things like fresh water lays in that Lake and Yonder in Nevada and in Arizona New Mexico Eastern California lays millions of Acres of parched burning ground that's so fertile that if that water could ever get to that ground this nation could feed the [Applause] world Amen Hallelujah without any hungry people we'd have Surplus to throw into the sea I like that word Surplus amen that's right a millions of Acres that would grow tons uh uh of radishes wait a minute tons of times millions of tons of potatoes and cabbage and beans and lettuce and radishes and celery and cucumbers and what more the ground would grow it it's just longing for that water oh my 's the water up here amen and here's the ground down here now we can see it and we know that it would do it because if we could test the water we see it's fresh we test the soil to see that it's fertile now all the wishing that we could do we'll never put them together amen are you reading between the lines tonight how many know we've got stored up food we've got radishes we've got all these things we've got got all the tapes we've got everything that we have need of to make you and to feed you and to fill you up and to give you Surplus to give you more than what you need amen but you got to figure out how to get it together doesn't do any good just on the tapes and on the books it's got to go further than that is that right how many believe that there's in the kingdom of God there's joy there's peace there's amen there's longsuffering there's the fruit of the spirit there's longsuffering and gentleness and meekness and Temperance and patience and love and faith there's power unlimited the unlimited power in the body of Christ how many believes he there it's just that can we get it how do we both got getting this CU I don't know about you but I could use a little Surplus Joy couldn't you I could have my I like my cup full and running over don't you I don't like to be a quarter full or just a little bit I'm afraid that's where a lot of people are amen they just got a little bit in the cup just enough to make them come to church huh amen but never not enough not enough to raise your hand not enough to really just all right preach it brother huh but there's so much I'm many know man when I think about it oh let me finish this I want to get to something else but now notice that's right now all the wishing that we could do will never bring them together but there is a law and that law is gravitation now if we' work according to the law of gravitation we could water every bit of that land taking the water from the lakes and watering it but we'll have to work according to the law of gravitation we can't wish it out there you can't scream it out there you can't holler it out there you've got to work according to the law of gravitation oh my listen to what he says the power and the power he says that'll rais us up is right in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are we are now in the power of the Resurrection amen how many believe that if you're filled with the Holy Ghost tonight you got the power of the Resurrection in you if there wasn't now listen we are now under power of the Resurrection now if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out there and go and live a private life on it w how mean is the laws of Faith there's a law of Faith amen whatsoever things you desire when you ask believe that you'll receive it and you have it now first of all to me that's like that Lake Superior up there look look up there's so much there whatsoever things you ask to me that's just a little hard to believe I'm just going to be honest with you that right don't call me an nonbeliever but it's just hard to believe ask anything in my name and I would do it a that just a little hard to believe what anything now how many knows you got to be a little careful with that you got to be a little careful with that now I'm not casting doubt but there's more scripture there's more scripture that's not the only scripture one place he says if we ask anything according to his will we receive what we ask for and even brother Braham said there's a law to that if there's not a law to the that Faith he says you could go and build the [Music] world that's not all let me read a little bit more shall [Applause] I that's right private life on you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got the power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power is in you you could speak a world into existence and go living on it hallelu there you are that's the what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law huh and that law is not deeping a bunch of Commandments it's the law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it huh if you can believe it if you can have faith for it huh amen whatever God would lead your soul to believe it's yours if thou can't believe all things are possible amen all right that is yours I like that whatever God leads your heart and soul to believe how and I would think studying this because let me let me just I can't just seemed to get all this out but he talked about how that people would get so under the anointing of the Holy Spirit they would climb so high in God isn't that right that they would write Songs amazing grace and How Sweet the Sound and different ones like that and some of them went to suicide after they come off of that way being up there that high that spiritual high so to speak ain't that right didn't brother brandham come caught so much in the spirit until he would have to go and this is some jokes or walk it off or come back down amen and when you come back down it's a rough time it's like oh my it's real rough when you come down from that atmosphere down to here back into the world that you actually live in huh they would climb so high oh my and they would write songs and I believe that I don't know about you but I think well you know one of the things that I thought about is that look if you know how we have Mountaintop experiences we get up on the mountain top all things are possible now might we have joy unspeakable I don't know about you but I believe that we need to just keep climbing as high as we can if I'm gonna go up on the mountain brother John I'm just G to go all the way to top I ain't going halfway up Mount Everest I want to go PL to the top are you with me we're got to go high let's go way high let's go so high that our children get up so high until maybe they'll write poem even Elena is writing poems huh maybe bright poems maybe write songs maybe see Visions or be able to have God lay it on their heart to believe something and say brother I give you what you have need of in the name of the Lord but how many knows you can't just say that on your own it'll never work if it's on your own that's where people miss this scripture is they think well I can just say it I can just believe it I can just ask it I wanted you to know that God won't give you Faith to believe something that ain't according to his word you might think you have faith but if isn't given to you by God there is not not real genuine faith and you're going to fail and flop and fall right down on your facei amen that's why I said be careful because even the prophet of God said he has to be hard you wouldn't just even brother bam when he was Discerning thought they'd say well listen they'd come to him and says look if you'll just say that I'm GNA be well just say those words and I'm GNA believe it you know what is that what he did they did he says I can't do that all Roberts and Billy Graham they might be able to lay hands on you're healed in the name of Jesus huh and of course we're healed in the name of Jesus Jesus we believe that by his stries were healed but to tell a person you are healed of your disease he says then what if you didn't what if you didn't get well and I said you in the name of the Lord I would be speaking on my own how many know brother Bon would wait for that the quote to be fulfilled God would have to lay it on his heart amen how many knows that's the kind of Christians we want to be we want to be strong Christians that we can actually amen speak something amen praise the Lord and it be God because if it's God it won't fail amen praise the Lord amen I believe we've had our exercise Faith even exercise today because of things that happen amen we've had a certain need now it's like if thou can't believe amen what do you ask for you'll have it and many if you can you fin believe it you'll have what you've asked for God will give you the faith to believe it amen M all things are possible to have that belief whatever Godly leads you to Soul to believe that's yours every place the soul of your feet can set God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can just find the key to this law of faith it opens it up to you how many knows it one of those Keys is to be surrendered to God it's to be dedicated to almighty God D met so much so until you're not living your own life but it's the Holy Ghost living in you that's the key to it it's his faith th will be done amen oh my now listen Faith opens it up to you see what I mean the power is controlled if you are a son of God you're a daughter of God that never leaves you amen it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's but it's still there the everpresent water from the Rock brother bam was preaching he's ever present when you are s saved God gives you Faith to rais from the muck of the world and your faith overcomes the world what is your faith how many knows what your faith is one of the things that make you a strong Christian is if you've got a genuine revelation of almighty God the gates of hell can't even Prevail against that what is it that overcomes the world what is your Victory the Bible says your Victory is your faith faith is the victory that overcomes the world if you ever have any Victory it's because you down in your heart says I believe I'm overcome that that faith is what overcomes it if you know I don't believe I'm never going to get better no I'm never going to be a better Christian I'm always going to have this shortcoming I'm always going to have this weak Link in my life come on folks Devil's language but if you have faith that faith is what overcomes the world of course one of that's one of the strongest things love is another one but we're going to dwell on faith a little bit that faith is the victory that overcomes the world praise the Lord Lord all right that's right it was your faith come overcomes to your faith is the act that God has did in you to make you a Son of God you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith Rises you above it amen if you don't do it then you don't have any faith and by faith are you saved and that's who Grace as much as your faith will be released that's how much power that you can have how many know that this here is the sword of the spirit this is God Sword but it'll only cut as deep as the faith that you have to cut with amen takes Faith to cut out a big chunk amen my my my all right as much Faith as will be released that's how much power you can have because it dwells you dwells in the power in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth I mean we have the very same faith that God had that he spoke the world into existence now I believe that this year even now I believe that the church has Faith to speak things that they don't see feel or hear and speak it into existence amen maybe you got a wavered loved ones don't look good at all huh God can change that God can grant you the faith to pray for that person amen and God can bring them in things that are not as though they are amen I want to take Abraham for an example for just a little bit but so now listen let me finish this quote here I only got a couple quotes see in you there's Faith to make heavens and the Earth how many times I'd love to know how many times that brother Benham spoke squirrels or storms out of exist or whatever just because on a on on a hunch just because he felt like it no not one time is that always it was God unction him say what you want tell howy right huh brother bam didn't come on that on his own no God told him you tell her God said you speak to the storm God said you speak to the squirrels and where where you want it and then you do it that's God through you and creating worlds creating squirrels ain't that right stopping storms amen God coming down and SA to profit in such a way until he spoke that bull spoke to the Hornets and go back where you are how many beli it's the very same faith that David had when that bear came it's the same faith that oh my that he had when the lion came same faith that he had that God gave him in his heart something in his heart said David you going to kill that giant you going to kill that God he wasn't the PR and that's what we need church we need Christians that God speaks through your heart not just a pastor your heart every individual he ought to be talking to like that I give it to you amen oh my God gives it to you and then you speak from there because that is our example of a real strong Christian amen praise the Lord oh my makes heaven but God dwells in you you're Sons and Daughters of God Amen there you are but it's your faith Jesus said according to your faith so be it unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible another place he said nothing shall be impossible with you amen wow that is some Michigan Waters uh that's the huge up there trying to get it down here into this dve ground how many with me Lord help me to yield myself to the law of Faith so that I can have Surplus so that you can W me in such a way so fill me with the Holy Ghost amen until I have such victory in my life such joy in my life so that I have longsuffering and gentleness and patience and love for the sinner hello until it's overflowing we need Surplus we need people with Surplus fruit of the spirit how many believes it's there it's there for us it's there for you tonight if you can believe if you can believe believe and don't doubt if you're a child of God God gives you the ability oh my when I think about just the Simplicity of God speaking to Young people's hearts how many believes that when he speaks to the heart and you're battling oh I don't know if I can I don't know if I'm a son and daughter I'm but when you say I believe I'm one of God's children you thank God for that say Lord give me more pour some more water on hey amen what is it brother B says when Christ comes into your heart amen it's like a tree that's plant it amen you just water it and get more water put extra water in it Surplus water it amen and you'll push out all fruit you'll push out all these things healing will come salvation will come all kinds of good every blessing of God everything God will come out of you if you'll do what walk water to tree I wrote down here we are so unbalanced the reason we are not strong Christians like we are is we're unbalanced amen not enough time is spend in prayer we don't spend enough time meditating on the Lord listening to God Amen that's one reason why we're not what we ought to be huh I don't know if I got that quote or not I don't let me just read this that's the reason that he doesn't appear to too many of us today our conversations is talking about everything else but Christ we're always talking about well when we're going to get this work done or what we're going to do here let your conversation be in Christ that's when he appears it's when we talk about him when we're speaking about him it's not the on Pentecost he was talking about Pentecost and how that they had gotten away amen from the Lord amen away from Faith that's why they were in the condition that they were let me just finish this here before we go to next thought listen so he says verily verily I say unto you if you say it is Mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you have asked it'll be done then what kind of people ought we to be huh having faith in his great redeeming Christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves the church I Am With You Always even into the end of the world the everpresent of the great gusher of Salvation and power that poured forth from Calvary into the church the ever presence of the Living God great flowing the smitten rock that always goes with us wherever we go how many believe that flowing river is with you on Wednesday night and Sunday night no always wherever you go [Applause] amen Abraham let's talk about him for a minute I want to go a couple more places all right we got time good let's go to Romans let's look at the strength of Abraham how Abraham was strong and also Noah I want to talk to Noah a little bit Romans 4 verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of of many nations before whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calth those things which be not as though they are who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be how many times B says look how Abraham was how do we compare and we say that we're the children of Abraham and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God being fully persuaded that what he had promised he is also able to preform I me know Abraham was strong in faith Paul says staggered not at the promise of God called those things that were not as though they were folks how many believes here in this end time here we're looking we're either facing the Trib and atomic bomb and destruction or ref facing the Rapture how many believe that and there's a promis we are promised a body change amen it might not seem like it it may not look like it but the very faith that Abraham had as we are Sons and Daughters of God know that one of these days we will be changed in the very Adams a the world might think we're fools and foolish and stupid all that other stuff but guess what I mean know all of us we're coming to church on Wednesday night because we're looking things that are not yet they're invisible but they're going to be Noah was Noah he was so he was strong in faith he had not only waited 25 years like Abraham did but we waited 120 years is that right I call it cataclysmic Faith the bride tonight I believe has cataclysmic faith other words it's a world event it was going to drown the whole world maybe we'll get to see the replay of Noah preaching to everybody and then taking a GoPro and going showing the audience this guy think the whole world's GNA flood this guy's Cy he's not did you see that big boat that he's building up on top of hill it's not even close to the ocean oh D all kinds of ID all kinds of laughter all kinds of mocking but Noah had great faith he knew it was going to happen a't that right how about you tonight how many knows that Peter promised that this world's going to be on fire there's a fire coming to this world it's going to be cataclysmic isn't that right but we're going to be Chang in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to change from this world into the next because of the faith that is in our hearts strong in faith strong in faith amen I love that don't you oh my of course we won't go on to this too much but in James 1 Thor talks about the trial of your faith amen Amen Let me let me uh that's let me make sure I get that right that's right I think the trial of your faith was Peter James said my Breen count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith Works patience how manyan knows if we never got trials if we never had any wind blow you wouldn't get stronger you had no com coming against you you wouldn't get stronger that's why we learned from the bear to the lion to Goliath and Goliath is just a little bitty F compared to the 10 Philistines that surrounded David and everybody else and he had to go out and kill all of them hello sometimes we have a lot of devils that we got to fight a lot of doubts we got to fight amen that's right but trials make us stronger the trying of our faith a testing of our faith makes you stronger amen bigger Big Stuff amen you love him praise the Lord hallelujah now I want to go to one more thought here and I want to go to another thing that makes you stronger Psalms one if you want to go with me Psalms 1 let me see I've got three places I want to go actually my last three scriptures Psalms one blessed is the man that walketh not the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning once in a [Music] while hello I'm open that there's people listening to me out there am cuz the fact is that some of us older folks we get into such a rut until we never get out of that rut and we are what we're going to be we read as much pray as much as what we're pretty much going to H but how many know better man said let me see what your Pinups are let me see what kind of music you listen to and I'll tell you who you are what kind of spirits on you let me ask you let me look at what you do all the time and where your interest is all the time I'll tell you where your treasure is and I'll tell you where your heart is why what are you thinking about all the time what are you meditating on where you mind out do you realize that just my meditation just meditating on him brings you strength it'll do crazy stuff to you amen the Bible says that by the foolishness of preaching faith comes by hearing ain't that right faith comes by hearing the word of God so when we preach about David we preach about this we preach about that amen but guess what because it's going into your ear and he's going into your mind hopefully down into your heart and when you're meditating on him Bible says blessed is he whose mind you stay on the the way what you meditate on oh I cry when I wake up I say Lord let me meditate on you before I got up this morning praying Lord Jesus I pray that you'll help me through the day and me just laid there for a minute and thought thought upon him scooted my legs over off the bed I said devil you're fixed to be under my feet I slid down on the stair I said there where you belong under my feet when I get out of bed when I get on the floor he's down under my feet that's where he belongs Amen brother Bram didn't meditated around the tree he was looking at the eagle and he begin thinking about God and hearing iot and everything his mind was on God by just his meditation got it hallelujah praise be to God cuz when you going to sit there and you think about David you think about Samson you think about Samson oh meditate oh Samson was a oneman army they didn't need a 10,000 people just send Samson over there cuz what is it Samson and God man that's completely surrendered to God Amen is the multitude they are the majority just one man just better take Moses was one man Invasion I'm going down to take over and he did a one man Invasion and then I think God I meditate Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever but you was back there you are now here you're in my heart doing the same thing he'll get you fired up I'm going believe meditation is important what you think about is important what goes through your mind is what you'll be kind of person that you'll be amen powerful along with prayer let me jump off of meditation go into prayer for just a minute I come to The Garden Alone while the de is still on the roses and and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own am better B says get a person that's been in prayer Amen in that sweet Garden amen and I tell you what you'll oh you meet a sweet person you'll meet a person that's been in prayer you need a sweet person you'll find somebody that's been talking to the Lord under the sweetness of things you meet them on Monday they're the same Tuesday they're the same Wednesday they're the same Thursday they're all the same why because they've been in the presence of almighty God how many presence of God was very important not just here and exuding amen because I wouldn't doubt it maybe it's just me but as I believe as the word is going forth there's waves waves of Holy Ghost waves of Faith going all over and if you can receive it if you can accept it there's no telling what might happen if you're sick you really believe the word of God you can raise up be healed if you're a sinner and say I accept Christ as my savior you can be filled with the Holy Ghost instantly you'll catch the vibe Catch the Wave amen that's what we want Lord take me higher if I'm going to climb this mountain I would might as well climb to the top I've got enough valleys out oh my this world in this life there's plenty of alleys but I like those Mountaintop experiences we climb up there I have found his grace is all complete he Supply every need it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory don't you love those praise the Lord okay let's go go on where was I but his Delight is in law of the Lord and on his law does he meditate day and night if you talk about him he comes around if you think about him he comes around amen and he shall be I like that he tells you what kind of a person is going to be what the person's going to be like a person that meditates on his law day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen I know brother brand explained the rivers of one water many rivers of one water anden we won't get into that that bringeth forth God's fruit in God's season or his fruit in his season amen his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he do doth shall prosper the ungodly are not so they're defeated at every turn ain't that right they're like a chaff that the wind driveth away fly here fly there wishy-washy amen that's one let's go to the next scripture Joshua one eight this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night amen show me a should I say it first show me a person that's always meditating on the Lord I'll show you a person to be in church on Wednesday night that's right I'll show you Church a person wants to be a church Sunday morning amen whenever the doors are open amen he won't come in and have the tong leader now come on let's sing come on please sing a little with me will you help me out no amen they'll sing to the pray at the high praises of God how many believe that it'll make you a different person people unbalanced how many believes we need to spend more time in meditation more time take a day take a day off do nothing but read pray maybe a week two days huh consecrate yourself you take how much time for work lots and lots and lots of time right it's so important we got to do it now this is what's important important this is more important than anything and if if Joshua was going to be strong is't that right and courageous and fearless and all this he says don't watch what you meditate on watch where your mind goes always have him before you amen praise the Lord day and night then thou mayest observe to to all that is written therein for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success amen how many believe that God goes before you he'll make sure everything today just goes so much better I don't care what it is brother Joel I don't care if we're uh starting to build a house I don't care what it is prayer is always the most important say Lord we need you on this Lord we need need you on that amen and things will go so much better when God is first in everything amen have not I commanded thee be strong and have good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest man how we could run the pews tonight to think he say I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'm he's glad that God is always there with you amen one more scripture in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 6 this is where the Lord was beginning to give him give them his Commandments amen once again it's in the same line of meditation let's just skip down real quick like to verse three here there for oh Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee that ye may increase
