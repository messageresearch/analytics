TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But Abraham talks about some time ago a man on his road to the seaside. He was going for a little rest. He wanted to refresh himself. Ain't that right? You all remember the sword. He wanted to refresh himself and hear the seagulls and all these things, you know. He wanted to go down and relax and really enjoy the blue sky that reflects the water. And on his road to the seashore, he met a man with his old this old salt, the old sailor of the sea. He says, "Where goest thou?" He said, "I go down to the seaore to enjoy the goodness of the sea." The old Saul said, "You know, I don't see nothing strange about it. The waters are just waters. Sky just sky. The gull is just another bird." You see, he had seen so much until it became common to him. It wasn't thrilling to him anymore. How many knows that you got to be careful going to church, hearing the gospel? hearing the preacher it just becomes common to you. Brother Abraham said that commonness is is leisier. It's lukewarmness. Is &gt;&gt; that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't thrilling to him. And that's what's the matter with you people. Brother Bam says you've seen the goodness, the miracles, the divine things OF GOD MOVING AND WORKING UNTIL IT JUST BECOMES COMMON. We hear preachers under the inspiration FIREBALL AND AMEN. WE USED to Amen. preach it. We used to pull &gt;&gt; be careful. Brother M. Brother Michael sits under brother Donnie Reagan. Hello. But it can become common if you aren't careful. Just Well, there's Brother Donnie again. We were listening. Brother, there's Brother Ber, whoever it might be. We sit here, cross our hands, just become common. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing to let it become common. And it's easy to do. You would think that the love of God, the goodness of God, the, you know, the Holy Spirit moving in the atmosphere, amen, would would never get dullled, never get dim, never gets stale. But he can if you aren't careful. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I don't believe if somebody really stays on fire that and they will get away from that and they they will let it become common. But it's when you get away from God a little bit and you let the world come in a little bit too much. You pay too much attention to YouTube or whatever it might be AND YOU DON'T PRAY LIKE YOU OUGHT TO AND all of a sudden YOU GO AWAY FROM IT. &gt;&gt; I mean you got to be careful church. Let's be careful. Evening light tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we don't let the preacher, the music, whatever it is, become common to where it's just another service. It's just another sermon. He's just doing what he's supposed to do. Lord help us.
