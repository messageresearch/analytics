[29:16] come, let's sing. If I could touch the
[29:17] hem of his garment,
[29:20] just start with the chorus. If I could
[29:23] but touch
[29:27] the hem of his garment.
[29:32] If I could but touch
[29:37] one part of his robe,
[29:42] I know I healed.
[29:47] My sins all forgiven.
[29:52] if I could. Not sure if that's on. I
[29:55] know I'd be whole.
[30:34] Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful?
[30:39] Does he see me in my trouble? Does he
[30:43] understand?
[30:46] Sometimes I question if he's able.
[30:50] Can he resue? Can he save me again and
[30:55] again?
[30:56] When I look back,
[31:00] did he move every mountain? Did he part
[31:04] every sea? Yes, he did.
[31:08] So, yes, he did.
[31:12] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[31:15] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[31:20] So, yes, he can.
[31:23] Yes, he did.
[31:26] So, yes, he can.
[31:29] Sometimes those voices try to tell me
[31:34] I've forgotten and I've fallen too far
[31:38] from his hands. But I know what kind of
[31:42] God he is. And I'm trusting in his
[31:45] promises. Believing and I'm singing.
[31:49] Yes, he can.
[31:52] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[31:56] every sea? Yes, he did.
[32:00] So yes, he can.
[32:04] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[32:08] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[32:12] So, yes, he can.
[32:15] Yes, he did.
[32:18] So, yes, he can.
[32:21] I've seen too much now. I can't deny.
[32:27] He's come through every single time.
[32:33] From the beginning until the end, he
[32:38] did. He will again.
[32:45] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[32:49] every sea? Yes, he did.
[32:53] So, yes, he did.
[32:56] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[33:00] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[33:04] So, yes, he can.
[33:08] Yes, he did.
[33:10] So, yes, he can.

[33:18] every sea? Yes, he did.

[33:29] deliver me? Yes, he did.

[36:09] just how it felt

[36:20] But since that day,
[36:24] yes, since that hour,

[41:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, y'all came on fire.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; The songs of praise just beautiful
[41:14] tonight. And we we thank you for that.
[41:16] And and uh just giving out to the Lord
[41:19] and pouring out. You know, so many times
[41:20] I I sometime myself I feel like uh I
[41:23] don't adequately worship. And you know,
[41:26] I was just looking up. I was listening
[41:28] to y'all sing and I thought I'm going to
[41:29] look up worship. And you know, it said
[41:31] worship can be in songs. It can be in in
[41:34] prayer. It can be in uh silence.
[41:39] And I just want to say, Lord, let me
[41:41] worship you tonight
[41:43] &gt;&gt; for what you've done for us. So we just
[41:45] thankful. We won't try to keep us keep
[41:48] you long tonight. But I do want to lay a
[41:49] foundation and you uh we'll be with you
[41:52] again Sunday morning as brother Ber will
[41:54] be traveling. We'll just continue to
[41:55] remember them and uh the Lord will grant
[41:58] them traveling mercies and powerful
[42:00] powerful meetings and that the Lord will
[42:02] move in miraculous ways for them up in
[42:05] Virginia. So uh we certainly know that
[42:07] he can and so we're certainly praying
[42:10] that that he will. So, if you would be
[42:13] turning in your Bibles to the book of
[42:14] Genesis. And like I said, we want to lay
[42:16] a foundation tonight if we could for
[42:20] Sunday. So, we will uh we will get going
[42:24] and try to get us uh get us in the right
[42:27] direction there.
[42:45] Forgive me there. I'm playing with
[42:46] technology tonight. So, um,
[42:50] book of Genesis chapter 22. I want to
[42:52] speak tonight if we could on Abraham's
[42:55] seed. Abraham's seed. Now, Brother
[42:59] Brandham tells us this. He says, "But in
[43:00] the depths of our heart there lays
[43:02] happiness because that we know that we
[43:06] are listen absolutely secure in Christ.
[43:11] You promised Abraham that you would save
[43:14] him and his seed and we being dead in
[43:18] Christ take on Abraham's seed and are
[43:22] hes according to the promise by the Holy
[43:26] Spirit. new life coming into us, making
[43:29] us believe the supernatural like Abraham
[43:32] did. He says, "Taking God at his full
[43:35] value, his promise. We thank thee, oh
[43:39] Lord." Genesis chapter 22, and I want to
[43:42] kind of start there at chapter in verse
[43:44] 11. And the angel of the Lord called
[43:47] unto him out of heaven and
[43:48] said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said,
[43:50] "Here I am." Now, if it looks like we're
[43:52] reading scriptures we just recently
[43:54] read, you're probably right. But but
[43:56] we're going in a different direction
[43:57] this time. Okay? And he said, "Lay not
[44:00] thine hand upon the lad, neither thou do
[44:02] thou anything unto him. For now I know
[44:05] now I know that thou fearst God, seeing
[44:08] thou hast not withheld thy son, thine
[44:11] only son, from me." And Abraham lifted
[44:14] up his eyes and looked, and behold
[44:17] behind him a ram caught in a thicket by
[44:20] his horns. And Abraham went and took the
[44:22] ram and offered him up for a burnt
[44:24] offering. Offering instead of his son
[44:28] and Abraham called that place Jehovah
[44:31] Gyra. So here we see this unconditional
[44:34] covenant between Abraham and God is now
[44:37] coming to pass. God is telling the Lord
[44:39] will provide and this is a promise based
[44:42] on the trust that that Abraham had in
[44:45] God. And during this hour of need,
[44:47] during this hour of desperation, as a
[44:50] proof of no matter what you're going
[44:52] through, no matter what the situation is
[44:54] in your life, you're going to trust in
[44:56] me like you've never trusted before.
[44:59] You're going to depend on me, Abraham,
[45:02] like you've never depended before.
[45:04] Because this covenant that I have made,
[45:08] no matter what the challenge, no matter
[45:09] what the obstacle, Abraham, now you can
[45:12] rest assured in knowing that I will from
[45:16] this day forward, I will supply every
[45:19] single one of your needs.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; And we can apply that as we look in the
[45:27] book of Acts and it says, "This promise
[45:28] is unto you and unto your children and
[45:30] all are far off as many as the Lord God
[45:32] shall call." Now watch. And the angel of
[45:35] the Lord called unto Abraham out of
[45:37] heaven the second time, and said, By
[45:40] myself I have sworn, sayaeth the Lord,
[45:42] for because thou hast done this thing,
[45:45] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[45:48] only son, which was a covenant promise.
[45:52] You haven't withheld your promise
[45:55] that in blessing I will bless. ABRAHAM,
[45:59] YOU'RE GIVING BACK TO ME. YOU'RE
[46:01] BLESSING ME. YOU'RE GIVING WHAT I GAVE
[46:03] YOU, THE VERY PROMISE, THE COVENANT, THE
[46:06] VERY SEED THAT I SAID WOULD WOULD
[46:07] MULTIPLY.
[46:09] YOU'RE NOW GIVING IT BACK TO ME. SO IN
[46:11] BLESSING, I'm going to bless thee. And
[46:13] in multiplying, I will multiply thy
[46:16] seed. Listen to that. And in
[46:17] multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as
[46:20] the stars of heaven, as the sand which
[46:25] are up on the seashore. And thy seed
[46:27] shall possess the gates of his enemy.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray tonight. Heavenly
[46:33] Father, we come before you, thankful,
[46:34] Lord, for this day you've given us and
[46:36] for the opportunity to get into your
[46:39] house once again and just to worship you
[46:41] in spirit and in truth. And Lord, we've
[46:43] heard the songs sang tonight and the
[46:45] songs of worship and praise. And just
[46:48] lifting your name on high, Lord, and the
[46:50] the level of dedication for people to
[46:52] come out tonight in the cold and the
[46:54] wind and misty, rainy night, Lord. And
[46:57] we're just thankful for the sacrifice
[46:58] that's made. May our sacrifices not go
[47:00] unseen, but be lifted up to your throne
[47:03] and accepted tonight, Lord. And as we've
[47:05] sacrificed and we've give, Lord, we just
[47:08] ask, Lord, that you would pour out a
[47:09] blessing upon us tonight, Lord. That you
[47:11] would help us to identify with who we
[47:13] are and what we're what our calling is
[47:15] in this hour. Lord, we just want to tell
[47:17] you we love you. We appreciate you, and
[47:19] give you all the praise and glory. And
[47:21] we just ask that you would have your
[47:22] will and way in this service in Jesus'
[47:25] name. You can have your seats. I do want
[47:27] to take a trip down through a few more
[47:29] scriptures if you want to have your
[47:30] Bibles handy so that we can get the the
[47:33] gist of what's going on here. So,
[47:35] Genesis 24. Now, if we look in Genesis
[47:38] 24 and 57 and 60,
[47:42] I want you to take notice what's
[47:43] happening here. Because in Genesis
[47:46] chapter 22, God was dealing with
[47:48] Abraham. God was dealing with Abraham
[47:51] and his seed Isaac with a covenant of
[47:54] multiplication.
[47:56] Now, in order to anything to multiply,
[47:58] we have math teachers here, and anything
[48:00] to multiply, you have to have a
[48:02] multiplier.
[48:03] So, you have to have a number and you
[48:05] got to have something to multiply it by.
[48:08] Isaac wasn't going to do this on his
[48:10] own. But God had a plan in place and and
[48:13] a and a multiplier in place. And in
[48:16] verse 57, it says, "They said, we call
[48:18] the damsel inquire at her mouth. And
[48:21] they called Rebecca and said unto her,
[48:24] "WILT THOU GO WITH THIS MAN? Will thou
[48:27] go with this man?" And she said, "Now, I
[48:30] want you to notice without hesitation,"
[48:33] she says, "I will.
[48:37] I will. I WILL GO." AND THEY SENT
[48:41] REBECCA AWAY with her sister and her
[48:43] nurse and Abraham's servants and his
[48:45] men. And they blessed Rebecca, and said
[48:48] unto her, Now watch what they say unto
[48:50] her. This is her family speaking back to
[48:52] her now. And her family looks at her and
[48:55] and they look at her and they SAY, "THOU
[48:57] ART OUR SISTER,
[49:00] but be thou the mother of thousands of
[49:03] millions."
[49:07] Do you see the multiplier?
[49:11] BUT BE THOU THE MOTHER OF thousands of
[49:14] millions, and let thy seed possess the
[49:18] gate of those which hate them. Now, if
[49:20] you could pull up Psalms, we're going
[49:23] down through a little bit of history
[49:24] here and and laying this out. We look in
[49:26] Psalms 147,
[49:30] verse 1-5.
[49:33] It says, "Praise ye the Lord, for it is
[49:35] good to sing praises unto our God, for
[49:37] it is pleasant, and praise is comely.
[49:40] The Lord doth build up Jerusalem. He
[49:42] gather together the outcasts of Israel.
[49:45] He health health the broken in heart and
[49:47] bindeth up their wounds." Now watch WHAT
[49:49] IT SAYS. "AND HE TELLS THE NUMBER OF THE
[49:51] STARS, and he calleth them all by their
[49:54] names."
[49:58] Do you see a correlation here?
[50:01] DO YOU SEE WHAT GOD IS DOING? HE'S TOLD
[50:03] HE'S I'M GOING TO MAKE I'M GOING TO
[50:04] number your your your seed as the stars
[50:06] of the sky, the sands of the sea. AND
[50:08] NOT ONLY AM I GOING TO NUMBER THEM, BUT
[50:10] I'M GOING TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE one of
[50:12] them THAT COMES INTO MY PRESENCE. I'M
[50:14] GOING TO know each and every one of them
[50:16] by their name. I'm going to KNOW THEIR
[50:18] NAME. COURTNEY, JOHN, ROY.
[50:23] Can you imagine the number and millions
[50:26] and millions and millions of people THAT
[50:27] HAVE BEEN DOWN THROUGH IT down through
[50:30] the ages HERE AND GOD KNOWS EVERY SINGLE
[50:33] one of them by name.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; And how we feel so insignificant at
[50:40] times.
[50:42] Galatians chapter 3
[50:45] and then we'll get started.
[50:48] Galatians 3 26 says, "For ye are all the
[50:52] children of God by faith in Christ
[50:54] Jesus. For as many of you has been
[50:56] baptized into Christ, have put on
[50:59] Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek,
[51:02] neither bond nor free. There is neither
[51:04] male nor female. For ye are all one in
[51:08] Christ." Now, here's where we're trying
[51:10] to get to. And if ye be Christ,
[51:15] then ye are Abraham's seed
[51:18] and hes according to the promise.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; SO THE COVENANT HAD COME DOWN THROUGH
[51:26] AGES. IT HAD COME DOWN AS GOD SPOKE TO
[51:28] ABRAHAM, AS GOD MADE THE COVENANT. I'M
[51:30] GOING TO MULTIPLY YOU. I'M GOING TO GIVE
[51:31] YOU A SEED THAT'LL MULTIPLY MORE THAN
[51:33] THE STARS, MORE THAN THE SANDS, AND I'M
[51:36] GOING TO GIVE YOU A GROUP OF PEOPLE.
[51:39] Brothers and sisters, we've been given a
[51:41] COVENANT AND A PROMISE IN OUR DAY THAT
[51:43] THE BY THE PROPHET OF THE HOUR. AND THAT
[51:45] COVENANT SAYS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT THE
[51:48] HOLY GHOST,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to TAKE MY TIME
[51:54] TONIGHT, BUT IF YOU'VE GOT THE HOLY
[51:56] GHOST, YOU'RE GOD'S CHILD.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; AND BUT IF YOU'RE GOD'S CHILD, YOU'RE
[52:01] ABRAHAM'S SEED.
[52:03] AND IF YOU'RE ABRAHAM'S SEED, YOU'VE GOT
[52:05] AN UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT THAT IS
[52:07] WRITTEN INTO THE VERY HEART OF GOD
[52:09] ALMIGHTY HIMSELF, WHO CAN'T TAKE IT
[52:11] BACK.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful tonight, brothers and
[52:17] sisters. I'm thankful tonight how
[52:19] wonderful it is to know that we HAVE A
[52:21] GOD THAT DOESN'T GIVE AND TAKE AWAY. HE
[52:25] DOESN'T GIVE OVER HERE AND THEN TAKE IT
[52:27] AWAY because he doesn't like it anymore.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; You know, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. WE JUST
[52:32] SAY, "OH, I I'll take some of this. I'll
[52:34] take some of that. I'll give you this.
[52:35] I'll give you that." But we begin TO
[52:37] TAKE THINGS BACK SOMETIMES. BUT GOD
[52:39] DOESN'T TAKE BACK WHAT he's promised. WE
[52:43] HAVE EVERY PROMISE. HE SWORE HE WOULDN'T
[52:45] TAKE IT BACK. The word says every every
[52:49] word in the book is mine.
[52:51] Are you with me?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; EVERY CHAPTER, EVERY PROMISE, EVERY
[52:56] VERSE, EVERY LINE. The song says, "I'm
[52:58] trusting in his love divine." What
[53:01] greater love is it THAT THE THE GOD of
[53:03] the heavens who declared to Abraham, I'm
[53:07] going to give you the the your your seed
[53:09] will be like the offse the the the sands
[53:12] of the sea and the stars of the sky.
[53:16] And he comes DOWN HERE IN THIS HOUR AND
[53:17] HE SAYS, "EVERY PROMISE that I made in
[53:20] this book,
[53:22] it's yours.
[53:25] If you have a need in your life, it's
[53:27] yours BECAUSE IT'S FOR GOD'S CHILDREN.
[53:30] IT'S UNCONDITIONALLY. AND IT'S NOT BASED
[53:33] UPON OUR MERITS. THANK GOD it's not
[53:35] based upon our merits.
[53:42] It's not based upon who your daddy is.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; It's not based upon who your pastor is.
[53:52] Wouldn't it be a shame if we all had to
[53:54] go to one church? I think they call it
[53:56] Roman Catholic.
[54:03] H
[54:05] IT'S NOT BASED UPON any of those things.
[54:08] HOW GOOD YOU ARE, HOW PRETTY you are,
[54:10] how tall, how dark, how handsome, how
[54:13] beautiful you are. God doesn't even look
[54:15] at those things. But what he does look
[54:18] at, HE LOOKS AT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
[54:20] GETTING IN CHRIST.
[54:22] WHETHER YOU'RE ALLOWING HIM TO HAVE HIS
[54:24] way in your life.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GETTING IN CHRIST IS. IT'S
[54:29] WHEN YOU GET YOURSELF OUT OF the way.
[54:32] That's what getting in Christ is getting
[54:34] out of the way and letting him get
[54:35] inside.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't deserve healing.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Not a one of us in here, this is a
[54:46] prophet speaking, not a one of us in
[54:47] here even even deserve to hear the
[54:50] gospel.
[54:52] H there's not a one of you that deserves
[54:55] the grace of Jesus Christ. None of us.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "But by God's grace, he did it
[55:01] anyhow."
[55:03] &gt;&gt; You see, HE DON'T TAKE BACK WHAT HE
[55:05] PROMISES.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; So no matter where YOU'RE AT IN YOUR
[55:09] LIFE, IF HE'S GIVEN YOU THE LIFE ON THE
[55:11] INSIDE, HE'S NOT GOING TO PULL IT BACK.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; We're not deserving. He says, "Every one
[55:17] of us ought to are going to die. Me,
[55:20] too. We ought to die. All of us. We're
[55:22] not even deserve to live on this earth.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Think about the insignificance that we
[55:29] are. But yet, we think we're so
[55:32] significant.
[55:34] How does this world even revolve without
[55:36] us waking up every morning?
[55:40] You see, that's the way we sometimes
[55:42] think. But we DESERVE NONE OF THIS. HE
[55:45] SAYS WE DON'T EVEN DESERVE to look at
[55:47] God's creation.
[55:54] Isn't it wonderful when you wake up in
[55:56] the morning and you look out across the
[55:57] the field or the yard? I hope some of
[55:59] you's got some some views that you can
[56:02] talk about. And you look out there,
[56:04] maybe you see the deer, you see the
[56:06] turkey, you see the fog coming through
[56:10] and you see the sunrise
[56:17] and how thankful we are,
[56:20] but how undeserving
[56:23] &gt;&gt; we are.
[56:27] But God, he said, has promised us and he
[56:29] cannot lie. He swore that he would do
[56:31] it. Healing belongs to us.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Healing belongs to us. Salvation belongs
[56:41] to us. The Holy Ghost belongs to us.
[56:44] Heaven belongs to us. WHY? HE SAYS
[56:47] BECAUSE WE ARE THE SONS OF GOD and we're
[56:50] HES ACCORDING TO THE PROMISES.
[56:53] Sons and daughters of God.
[56:57] We're sitting in heavenly places and
[56:58] there is nothing that can harm us.
[57:04] What a promise. You see, we're going to
[57:07] make some mistakes along the way.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I found that out a long time ago.
[57:13] We're going to make some mistakes ALONG
[57:14] THE WAY BECAUSE THIS human flesh that we
[57:17] call skin, you're going to do some
[57:19] things you wished you hadn't done.
[57:26] You're going to say some things that you
[57:27] wish you hadn't said.
[57:32] But do you know what the beautiful thing
[57:33] is about God?
[57:36] Thank God that he don't throw us out
[57:39] like filthy trash.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY SAY, YOU MAY DO, YOU MAY LOOK,
[57:44] YOU MAY SPEAK, YOU MAY SEE THINGS THAT
[57:47] YOU DON'T WANT TO DO OR WISH YOU'D NEVER
[57:48] DONE. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT GOD SAYS. HE
[57:51] SAYS, "PICK YOURSELF BACK UP. DUST
[57:53] YOURSELF OFF. GET BACK IN LINE BECAUSE
[57:56] YOU'RE AN HEIR. YOU'RE NOT MADE FOR THE
[57:58] GARBAGE. AMEN.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; BUT SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE WHEN they fall,
[58:02] when they make a mistake, THEY THINK,
[58:03] "OH MY GOODNESS, THAT'S IT."
[58:08] THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE A GIVE GOD A CHANCE
[58:10] TO PROVE THAT THAT you are an heir and
[58:12] that you are his.
[58:16] They fail to pick themselves back up.
[58:22] Now, you see, when you make these
[58:23] mistakes, it may hurt a little bit. When
[58:26] you make these mistakes, I it's probably
[58:29] going to cost you a little bit. WHEN YOU
[58:32] MAKE THESE MISTAKES, YOU'RE going to
[58:33] have to, may we say it this way, pay for
[58:35] it.
[58:38] You see, these things don't go unseen or
[58:40] unnoticed.
[58:45] But all you got to do is repent. Young
[58:47] people, listen to me. You're going to
[58:49] fall. You're going to make mistakes.
[58:50] You're going to have hard days.
[58:53] You're going to have days that you
[58:54] think, "There is no way I could be a
[58:56] Christian."
[58:58] Repent.
[59:01] REPENT. SAY, "I'M SORRY, GOD. I'M SORRY
[59:03] THAT I DONE THIS. I SHOULD NOT HAVE went
[59:05] this direction. I should not have said
[59:07] this or done this or or made this imp
[59:10] implication. God, forgive me."
[59:13] &gt;&gt; That settles it. Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS WATCHING Abraham in his mistake.
[59:22] Do you realize the father, the father
[59:25] Abraham, we call him father Abraham,
[59:31] found himself making mistakes.
[59:41] We won't go down that rabbit hole right
[59:42] now with him as mistakes and Sarah's
[59:44] mistakes and all the mistakes that they
[59:46] had. We may touch on that Sunday. But
[59:49] now Abraham, he he did make THESE
[59:50] MISTAKES AND GOD MADE ABRAHAM PAY FOR
[59:53] IT. SO HE WASN'T GOING TO GET BY WITH
[59:54] IT. BUT GOD DIDN'T DIDN'T JUST CAST
[59:57] ABRAHAM OUT. God didn't just forget
[1:00:00] about Abraham. He made Abraham repent
[1:00:02] for it. And many times we think in our
[1:00:06] minds,
[1:00:07] I'm not worthy of healing. I'm not
[1:00:11] worthy of deliverance. I'm not worthy of
[1:00:14] happiness.
[1:00:16] I'm not worthy of a of a healthy
[1:00:18] marriage.
[1:00:20] I'm not worthy of a of a of a a
[1:00:23] productive career or job.
[1:00:28] I'm not worthy. And that's what we
[1:00:31] sometimes get in our minds that we're
[1:00:32] not worthy. And the prophet said, "WE
[1:00:34] THINK WE'RE NOT WORTHY. I'VE DONE THIS
[1:00:36] and I've done that and I've I've said
[1:00:38] this and I've done that." HE SAYS, "GET
[1:00:39] THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; GET THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; TOWARDS ANY PROMISE OF God
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; will bring it to pass."
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; That's a direct quote. Write that one
[1:00:58] down. Let's give God a hand clap of
[1:01:00] praise. THE RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE
[1:01:02] TOWARDS ANY PROMISE OF GOD will bring it
[1:01:04] to pass.
[1:01:07] So get the NE GET THAT OTHER STUFF OUT
[1:01:09] OF YOUR MIND. GET IT OUT OF YOUR MIND.
[1:01:11] Sure you're not. He says you never will
[1:01:14] be, but Jesus is.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WORTHY. YOU NEVER WILL BE.
[1:01:22] BUT JESUS IS. THAT IS WHERE WE can place
[1:01:24] our faith in tonight. That it's in the
[1:01:26] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHERE WE
[1:01:28] ALL FIND our forgiveness.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's where we all find our salvation.
[1:01:34] It was he who paid the price, brothers
[1:01:36] and sisters. And the word says that
[1:01:38] whosoever will, let him come and drink
[1:01:41] freely,
[1:01:42] drink freely from the fountain of the
[1:01:44] waters of life.
[1:01:46] What is life?
[1:01:49] It's not you getting up every morning
[1:01:50] and putting on your britches and going
[1:01:52] to work. THAT'S NOT WHAT LIFE IS. BUT
[1:01:54] LIFE IS CHRIST ON THE INSIDE.
[1:01:58] That's the life I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[1:02:00] THAT'S THE LIFE HE'S talking about. That
[1:02:02] whosoever will let him come drink freely
[1:02:05] from the fountain of Jesus.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you're changing the
[1:02:12] word." No, I'm not.
[1:02:15] I'm not changing the word because Jesus
[1:02:18] is the only life I ever known.
[1:02:21] You see, in my life,
[1:02:24] I was a failure. In my life, I was a
[1:02:27] renegade.
[1:02:29] That's not the fountain I'm wanting to
[1:02:31] be drinking from.
[1:02:34] In my life, I was not a I WAS NOT A
[1:02:38] PLEASANT PERSON.
[1:02:41] Thank you.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; He knew me BC before Christ.
[1:02:55] But when I drink from that fountain of
[1:02:58] the water of life and BROTHERS AND
[1:03:01] SISTERS, GOD BLESSES you when you drink
[1:03:04] from that fountain of THE WATER OF LIFE
[1:03:05] AND GOD BEGINS TO POUR OUT his blessings
[1:03:08] upon you and he gives you life and it's
[1:03:10] the life of Christ living on the inside
[1:03:13] of the believers.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful story.
[1:03:23] He says, "Oh, I hate to butcher up
[1:03:24] anything like this, but I hope you get
[1:03:27] what I mean. God has an unconditional
[1:03:30] covenant."
[1:03:32] And he swore by the death of Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ, he sent the Holy Ghost back up
[1:03:37] on you to be a confirmation
[1:03:39] that the covenant is made with you.
[1:03:49] So if you fall, the covenant was made
[1:03:52] for you. IF YOU'RE SICK TONIGHT, THE
[1:03:55] COVENANT WAS MADE FOR YOU. YOU IF YOU
[1:03:58] HAVE NEED OF HEALING, the covenant was
[1:04:00] made for you. If you have need of
[1:04:02] deliverance, the covenant was made for
[1:04:05] you.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; So if you're in a battle tonight,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; how many is ever in a battle? How many
[1:04:17] ever ever feels like I can't overcome
[1:04:19] this enemy
[1:04:22] and you face it day after day after day
[1:04:24] after DAY AND YOU THINK MY GOD WILL I
[1:04:26] EVER BE ABLE TO overcome this.
[1:04:35] Realize tonight you have a covenant.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And you know what covenants are? They're
[1:04:41] an agreement. They're a contract that
[1:04:43] cannot be broken.
[1:04:50] You know what? I just I just Brother
[1:04:52] said I just don't we don't want ever
[1:04:53] want the devil to rob us of what's
[1:04:56] rightfully ours.
[1:05:00] Because he comes and he takes and he
[1:05:02] takes and he takes. Why would I want to
[1:05:04] give him anything else?
[1:05:07] Do you realize that? Because God has
[1:05:10] given me in a covenant given me a
[1:05:11] covenant that I DON'T HAVE TO BE SUBJECT
[1:05:13] to the things of the devil.
[1:05:18] He says, "Listen, you are a covenant
[1:05:20] people of God.
[1:05:22] God tore Christ apart at Calvary.
[1:05:27] You know, back in the day, they would
[1:05:29] take a they would take a a a skin, an
[1:05:32] animal hide, and when they were going to
[1:05:34] make a covenant, they would go in there
[1:05:35] and they would make an agreement. We're
[1:05:36] going to we're going to agree on this,
[1:05:38] and we're going to agree on that, and
[1:05:39] this is the way we're going to do
[1:05:40] business." and they would tear that
[1:05:42] animal hide.
[1:05:47] One partner would take one piece of
[1:05:48] hide, one partner would take another
[1:05:50] piece of hide.
[1:05:52] And if there was ever any question, and
[1:05:54] they wrote down what the rules of the
[1:05:56] covenant were on the hide,
[1:06:01] I won't do this. I won't do that. I will
[1:06:03] do this. I will do that.
[1:06:07] I will read my Bible and pray. I will
[1:06:10] I will worship you. I will praise you.
[1:06:15] I won't give myself to idol mindness,
[1:06:20] but I will serve you.
[1:06:24] And they tear that covenant.
[1:06:26] And if there's ever a question on the
[1:06:28] agreement,
[1:06:30] they say, "Hey, come here. We had an
[1:06:32] agreement. We made an agreement at the
[1:06:35] altar when we tore this hide and you
[1:06:36] told me that you wouldn't do this. you
[1:06:38] told me that YOU WOULD YOU WOULD GIVE
[1:06:40] ALL that you had until our agreement.
[1:06:43] And they bring those. He said, "Well, I
[1:06:45] don't know. I don't know if I really
[1:06:46] agreed to that. Hand me your hide."
[1:06:52] And they lay the two hides together.
[1:06:55] And as those two hides begin to the tear
[1:06:57] marks begin to line up, the words that
[1:07:00] was written across them begin to reveal.
[1:07:05] This is the covenant you made. You can't
[1:07:08] break this covenant. Brothers and
[1:07:11] sisters, God don't place us under a
[1:07:12] contract, so to speak. But he does give
[1:07:16] us a covenant. He gives us a way to
[1:07:18] serve him, a way to love him, a way a
[1:07:20] way that we can that we can be loved.
[1:07:28] AND CHRIST TOOK THE BODY UP and he took
[1:07:30] the body up into heaven after he took
[1:07:32] him up to Calvary making a coven
[1:07:34] swearing by him. He took him up into
[1:07:36] heaven that he would return someday. But
[1:07:38] the spirit is what he gave back to lead
[1:07:41] the church.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; We need the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; because any church that is not led by
[1:07:49] the Holy Spirit is not going to stand.
[1:07:54] IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO
[1:07:56] WITHSTAND ALL THE ENEMIES that's coming
[1:07:58] in and and this that and THE OTHER. IT
[1:08:00] CANNOT DO IT. SO, we need the leading of
[1:08:03] the Holy Spirit. THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS
[1:08:05] IN CHRIST IS IN the church by the Holy
[1:08:09] Spirit. And watch what he said it's
[1:08:11] doing. He said it is doing it is acting.
[1:08:14] It is performing the same things that he
[1:08:16] did when he was back here on earth.
[1:08:22] I think that's our church.
[1:08:26] And once you've received it, you've got
[1:08:28] the covenant. It is written to you,
[1:08:30] swore by God. And listen TO THIS. YOU
[1:08:33] CANNOT FAIL.
[1:08:38] Those are powerful words. So when YOU'VE
[1:08:41] GOT THIS HABIT THAT YOU JUST CAN'T
[1:08:43] OVERCOME, PUT IT IN BEFORE GOD AND SAY,
[1:08:45] "HERE IS A COVENANT that you made with
[1:08:47] me, God, THAT YOU SAID IF I WOULD DEPEND
[1:08:49] ON YOU, IF I would lay my burdens down
[1:08:52] at the altar, you made a covenant that
[1:08:54] you would take control of the
[1:08:56] situation."
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I cannot fail.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; And listen what he said. He says, "This
[1:09:05] makes the devil mad." And it sure does
[1:09:07] because it's when you realize who you
[1:09:09] are.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You know, listen, I'm I'm going to just
[1:09:15] stop here for just a minute and tell you
[1:09:16] a little something that happened. You
[1:09:18] know, people going to criticize.
[1:09:25] Well, if you ain't being criticized, you
[1:09:26] ain't doing nothing.
[1:09:30] People are going to criticize. People
[1:09:32] are going to mock. But that doesn't
[1:09:35] change who we are in Christ.
[1:09:38] Funny story.
[1:09:41] I I found it funny. I I don't know.
[1:09:44] Let's just go with it.
[1:09:48] So, Sister Jana puts out a clip
[1:09:51] when I was preaching
[1:09:55] and some comments started to show up on
[1:09:57] it.
[1:10:00] And this one guy says,"Great speech,
[1:10:06] but what are you going to do when this
[1:10:08] comes into the church and this because
[1:10:10] it was it was kind of it was kind of a a
[1:10:13] a lifting up putting you in your
[1:10:15] position. This is who we are. This is
[1:10:16] what we can have. This is what we can
[1:10:17] achieve through Christ." The clip that
[1:10:20] she put out and this guy begins to
[1:10:22] criticize. Great speech.
[1:10:26] What are you going to do when when
[1:10:28] homosexuals come in? when this comes in
[1:10:30] and when that comes in, what are you
[1:10:31] going to say to those people?
[1:10:34] In other words, why are you just
[1:10:36] preaching positivity?
[1:10:39] WHY ARE YOU JUST CALLING PEOPLE AND
[1:10:40] TELLING THEM WHO they are and what they
[1:10:42] what their abilities are in Christ? I
[1:10:44] will tell you why. Would you look around
[1:10:45] at your neighbor and see if we have any
[1:10:47] other problems?
[1:10:52] Do you see a problem with immorality?
[1:10:56] Do you see a problem with modesty?
[1:11:00] Do you see a problem with with split
[1:11:02] homes marriages?
[1:11:08] Do you see a bunch of rebels?
[1:11:13] Do you see the homosexuals?
[1:11:17] But I will assure you it would be
[1:11:20] preached on.
[1:11:24] But we are so I don't want to say so far
[1:11:26] down the road.
[1:11:31] We shouldn't be dwelling on THOSE
[1:11:33] THINGS. MODESTY SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING
[1:11:36] WE HAVE TO HARP ON EVERY SUNDAY, every
[1:11:38] Wednesday, every Sunday, and every
[1:11:39] Sunday night.
[1:11:41] YOU'VE HEARD THAT FOR 25, 40, 50 YEARS.
[1:11:46] BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING TO A PLACE WHERE
[1:11:48] GOD IS CALLING US INTO A POSITION TO LET
[1:11:51] US KNOW WHO WE ARE. SO THAT'S WHY THE
[1:11:53] MINISTRY HAS TAKEN THE turn that IT'S
[1:11:55] TAKEN IS TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU HAVE been
[1:11:57] adopted AND THAT YOU ARE AN heir of
[1:12:00] Christ.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; So people's going to criticize
[1:12:08] but but the word TELLS US THAT WE'RE
[1:12:10] JOINT AIRS WITH CHRIST TONIGHT. SO WHAT
[1:12:12] IS AN HEIR? WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WORD
[1:12:14] HEIR, I want you to think of this
[1:12:15] definition. a person legally entitled to
[1:12:19] the property or rank of another on that
[1:12:23] person's death.
[1:12:26] Let me read that to you again. Should
[1:12:28] have been a few amens there. A person
[1:12:30] that is legally entitled to the property
[1:12:33] or rank of another on that person's
[1:12:36] death. A person inheriting and
[1:12:39] continuing the legacy of a predecessor.
[1:12:47] You know, the legacy I leave behind
[1:12:48] won't be anything Brad Pal.
[1:12:53] The legacy that you leave behind won't
[1:12:55] be anything that you've done.
[1:12:58] But the I want the legacy that I leave
[1:13:01] behind be the legacy of my predecessor.
[1:13:04] I want the legacy that I live to be just
[1:13:07] what the LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST WAS. I
[1:13:09] want to love my neighbor. I want to be
[1:13:11] able TO GIVE TO OTHERS. I WANT TO BE
[1:13:13] ABLE TO GIVE MYSELF AS AS a servant of
[1:13:15] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; You see in ancient Israel, he airship
[1:13:22] was governed by the law. And the reason
[1:13:25] it was governed by the law is because it
[1:13:27] was to preserve the family land and the
[1:13:29] lineage of the family. And the Bible
[1:13:32] says that we being dead in Christ take
[1:13:35] on Abraham's seed and are hes with
[1:13:40] Abraham.
[1:13:42] SO WHEN WE ARE DEAD IN CHRIST, brothers
[1:13:45] and sist a when we die in Christ, think
[1:13:48] about this, a spiritual union begins to
[1:13:51] take place.
[1:13:54] SO WHEN WE DIE OUT to ourselves, WHEN WE
[1:13:57] DIE OUT TO our own ideas and we move
[1:14:00] ourselves out of the way and we make
[1:14:01] room for Christ on the inside, we then
[1:14:04] become what we call Christian.
[1:14:11] CHRISTIAN MEANS WE ARE BELIEVERS. IT
[1:14:13] MEANS WE'RE SAVED. It means we're
[1:14:15] Christlike.
[1:14:18] Did you hear what I said? When you get
[1:14:21] yourself out of the way and make room
[1:14:22] for Christ, YOU THEN ARE A CHRISTIAN who
[1:14:25] is Christlike. And then we WHICH ARE IN
[1:14:27] CHRIST ARE CHRISTIANS ARE CHRISTLIKE. IT
[1:14:30] MEANS WE ARE BELIEVERS.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE AN HEIR TO SALVATION. YOU'RE AN
[1:14:37] HEIR TO REDEMPTION. YOU ARE AN HEIR TO
[1:14:40] BE AN OVERCOMER AND VICTORY IS YOURS.
[1:14:54] Christ is the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:14:57] Listen to this. Christ is the royal seed
[1:15:00] of Abraham. And out of Abraham come
[1:15:02] Isaac. And out of Isaac Jacob. And out
[1:15:04] of Jacob Joseph. And Joseph. And on down
[1:15:06] and down David. And David. And so on.
[1:15:08] AND SO ON. UNTIL FINALLY THE ROYAL seed
[1:15:11] was born which was Christ.
[1:15:15] And in Christ the covenant of Abraham
[1:15:19] was confirmed to the people and was
[1:15:21] given to the people unconditionally.
[1:15:24] Now brothers and sisters when we know
[1:15:26] this that that is the only thing we have
[1:15:28] to do is to accept the promise we begin
[1:15:31] to find out that and to inherit all of
[1:15:34] the promises of God. All we have to do
[1:15:36] is to stay on the word.
[1:15:42] You see, when we get off the word,
[1:15:45] that's when we get on back onto
[1:15:46] ourselves.
[1:15:49] But in order to be an heir, you have to
[1:15:51] stay right there and be adopted into the
[1:15:53] life of Christ and adopted into the home
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; by staying on the word.
[1:16:06] You see, in the Old Testament,
[1:16:09] we're going to go over adoption real
[1:16:11] quick. In the Old Testament, in the in
[1:16:13] the story of adoption, when a child was
[1:16:16] born into a family, that child is say it
[1:16:18] was a boy, and he comes up and and and
[1:16:20] we find out that he's an heir, of
[1:16:22] course, because he's the firstborn son
[1:16:24] of a father or a businessman or
[1:16:26] whatever. So he is heir. But that CHILD
[1:16:29] WAS NOT FULLY an heir of all things that
[1:16:32] his father had before he came into
[1:16:34] power.
[1:16:36] He has to first be put under a tutor.
[1:16:40] HE HAS TO FIRST BE PUT UNDER a tutor.
[1:16:42] And this tutor begins to raise this son.
[1:16:46] And the tutor was a man that the father
[1:16:48] searched out diligently. I'M GOING TO
[1:16:51] FIND THE best man I can to raise my son.
[1:16:54] I'm going to find the the one who will
[1:16:56] tell the truth, the one who will reveal
[1:16:58] exactly what he has need of to make him
[1:17:01] heir of my throne.
[1:17:05] Huh?
[1:17:07] So, HE'S GOING TO FIND THE BEST MAN HE
[1:17:09] CAN. And brothers and sisters, do you
[1:17:10] realize we have been under a
[1:17:12] tremendously great tutor in this hour?
[1:17:15] We have been under a tutor in this hour
[1:17:17] WHO HAS TRAINED US, WHO HAS TAUGHT US,
[1:17:19] AND HAS REVEALED to us the very mind of
[1:17:23] Christ.
[1:17:28] But before he could come into his
[1:17:32] inheritance,
[1:17:35] what did God have to do?
[1:17:37] He had TO BE ABLE TO TRUST HIM.
[1:17:41] He had TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THE PROPHET.
[1:17:42] SO THE PROPHET HAD TO SIT under a tutor
[1:17:45] here.
[1:17:48] AND EVERYTHING THAT THIS TUTOR TOLD HIM,
[1:17:50] he did
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; to A POINT THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO TRUST
[1:17:56] HIM, THAT GOD WAS ABLE TO PUT CONFIDENCE
[1:17:59] IN HIM AND USE HIM. THAT'S WHY THE
[1:18:01] FATHER WANTED the best tutor for his son
[1:18:05] because he didn't want him to fall, but
[1:18:07] he wanted him to inherit all things.
[1:18:16] So this tutor, the prophet tells a story
[1:18:18] and it's it it's really good. He tells a
[1:18:20] story. He's talking about the tutor and
[1:18:22] he says that he wants a tutor
[1:18:26] that'll
[1:18:28] not tell a lie and say your church is
[1:18:30] doing fine.
[1:18:40] I think that's kind of the direction
[1:18:41] that guy was making those comments
[1:18:42] towards.
[1:18:44] I tell him, "Look around."
[1:18:47] I challenge him.
[1:18:50] Look around.
[1:18:54] We don't have to lie about it.
[1:18:57] We don't have to We don't have to fluff
[1:18:59] everybody up.
[1:19:07] you. WHAT ABOUT A TUTOR THAT WILL SAY,
[1:19:09] "YOUR SON'S DOING just fine when he
[1:19:12] isn't. He's a little rascal."
[1:19:17] That's too much to The trouble today is
[1:19:19] too many of our bishops and so forth
[1:19:21] with our man-made tutors.
[1:19:25] Man-made tutors.
[1:19:29] How many churches, how many
[1:19:30] denominations is it in the in the world
[1:19:32] now? 47,000.
[1:19:34] Is that right?
[1:19:36] 47. It was 44,000. I think it's went up
[1:19:40] to 47,000.
[1:19:41] So, if you're anybody at all with some
[1:19:44] kind of idea, you could have a church.
[1:19:49] You could have a church. You could have
[1:19:50] a following.
[1:19:53] You know what? Is this day and age we're
[1:19:55] living in? Everybody wants followers.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Like and subscribe. Follow me.
[1:20:04] We're trying TO REACH A MILLION
[1:20:06] FOLLOWERS. IF WE CAN REACH A MILLION
[1:20:07] FOLLOWERS, I'M GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A
[1:20:09] FREE PENCIL.
[1:20:15] I'm not looking for followers.
[1:20:18] I'm looking to be a servant.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING TO BE WHAT GOD WANTS ME TO
[1:20:23] BE SO THAT I CAN BE HEIR TO ALL that he
[1:20:25] is. Yeah.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; AND THIS TUTOR COMES IN HERE and and can
[1:20:29] you imagine what it WOULD BE LIKE TO
[1:20:31] HAVE A HAVE A HAVE A TUTOR that could
[1:20:33] couldn't even go back and see the father
[1:20:35] and tell him how good his son was doing.
[1:20:41] So the father gets the best tutor that
[1:20:43] he could find, the best razor. How the
[1:20:45] tutor must have blushed when he had to
[1:20:47] walk up in front of the father and say,
[1:20:48] "Oh, your son."
[1:20:51] Can you imagine this situation? The
[1:20:52] tutor walks up. Oh, let me tell you
[1:20:54] about your son. Oh. And the father says,
[1:20:56] "Oh, how is he?"
[1:21:00] Well,
[1:21:04] is he doing okay? Well,
[1:21:10] your son is He's genius, isn't he?
[1:21:15] Well,
[1:21:17] he's horrible.
[1:21:20] Your son is horrible.
[1:21:25] Uh he's a little bit,
[1:21:29] how could I say,
[1:21:31] in his own
[1:21:33] headed way. He's kind of hard-headed.
[1:21:39] You see, we can't be hard-headed
[1:21:42] Christians.
[1:21:43] But so many times people come to church
[1:21:46] and the preacher has to
[1:21:57] Why? Because they want to go their own
[1:21:59] way.
[1:22:01] They know the word. They know the truth.
[1:22:03] They know They hear the preachers
[1:22:05] reading it. They hear the PREACHER
[1:22:06] TELLING THEM EXACTLY THE TRUTH, word for
[1:22:08] word, but yet they want to do their own
[1:22:10] thing. That's what we call hard-headed.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes my wife said, "I'm glad when
[1:22:16] that whoever it is gets what you're
[1:22:18] trying to say.
[1:22:21] cuz you and brother Ber have been saying
[1:22:22] it for six months now.
[1:22:32] SO THAT TUTOR MUST HAVE blushed
[1:22:37] that tutor must must have blushed at the
[1:22:39] hard-headedness of this kid.
[1:22:43] And the tutor comes down here now and he
[1:22:45] says,
[1:22:47] "Oh, if that child was just like the
[1:22:49] father.
[1:22:51] IF THAT CHILD WAS JUST LIKE THE FATHER,
[1:22:53] MY EVERYTHING THE FATHER SAID."
[1:22:57] YES. He said, "Amen.
[1:23:04] We pay our tithes." Amen.
[1:23:08] We come to church when the doors are
[1:23:10] open. Amen.
[1:23:12] Oh, now we got something to smile about.
[1:23:16] We dress modestly. Amen.
[1:23:19] Men are head of the house. Amen.
[1:23:24] Christ is head of the man.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? And this TUTOR
[1:23:34] COMES AND HE TELLS THE FATHER, "HE'S
[1:23:35] JUST LIKE YOU. HE'S JUST LIKE YOU. YOUR
[1:23:38] SON IS A WONDERFUL BOY. JUST HE LOOKS
[1:23:41] JUST LIKE YOU. THE THINGS THAT you do,
[1:23:43] that's exactly what he does.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, there's some bosses
[1:23:52] out there and some superintendants out
[1:23:54] there, and when he walks OUT THERE, HE
[1:23:56] DON'T EVEN PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION. IT
[1:23:57] DOESN'T EVEN BOTHER HIM. HE STANDS THERE
[1:23:59] JUST LIKE you do.
[1:24:04] He knows who he is." How many of us know
[1:24:07] who we are tonight?
[1:24:11] So when WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN Satan comes,
[1:24:13] we we could say that old the old straw
[1:24:15] master as as the prophet tells the old
[1:24:17] straw boss
[1:24:20] comes there and he's trying to dictate
[1:24:21] and tell you what to do. How many of you
[1:24:23] is going to just pay him no attention
[1:24:24] and say, "I know who my father is.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I stand here because I know who my
[1:24:29] father is and and because I know who my
[1:24:32] father is, I am heir to everything that
[1:24:34] he is."
[1:24:38] how that FATHER MUST LOOK AT HIM WHEN
[1:24:40] THAT TUTOR COMES AND SAYS all those good
[1:24:42] things AND HE SAYS, "OH, THAT'S my son.
[1:24:44] I am so proud of him
[1:24:48] SO MUCH THAT SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO SHOW
[1:24:50] THE world that he's my son." Do you
[1:24:54] realize when when when we do the things
[1:24:56] that God wants us to do, it puts a
[1:24:57] little smile on his face?
[1:25:01] DO YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU
[1:25:02] OVERCOME SOME OF THE CHALLENGES that we
[1:25:04] have to overcome, God just steps back
[1:25:06] and says, "That's my son. I'M SO PROUD
[1:25:09] OF HIM. LOOK AT WHAT he's done. LOOK AT
[1:25:12] WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED. LOOK AT HOW HE'S
[1:25:14] PUT THE DEVIL IN HIS PLACE." HE DON'T
[1:25:16] LET THE DEVIL rule him. He rules the
[1:25:18] devil.
[1:25:27] This same son born into the family,
[1:25:31] his name
[1:25:33] is no good on the check until he checks
[1:25:36] out.
[1:25:39] You know, a lot of times we want to we
[1:25:41] want things to happen and we we hear the
[1:25:43] story and we hear the preaching on the
[1:25:44] checkbook. Just sign your name. Sign
[1:25:47] sign the sign what you want.
[1:25:52] But you better be adopted.
[1:25:54] YOU BETTER BE ADOPTED into the into the
[1:25:56] into the into Christ. You see, because
[1:25:59] when that time comes for the LAW OF
[1:26:00] ADOPTION, THE FATHER HAS TO TAKE HIS SON
[1:26:02] OUT into the public place AND HE SETS
[1:26:04] HIM up on this up on a a platform, we
[1:26:08] might say, and he puts a a robe of a
[1:26:10] dressing upon him of a certain robe and
[1:26:12] performs a task of what we call the
[1:26:14] placing of a son or the law of adoption.
[1:26:19] He says, "Now when this son is adopted
[1:26:21] into his own family, from then on,
[1:26:28] how many has got the Holy Spirit?"
[1:26:31] From then on,
[1:26:34] if you was able to raise your hand, from
[1:26:37] then on,
[1:26:40] from then on,
[1:26:44] he's adopted into this family.
[1:26:48] From then on, the son is given power.
[1:26:51] From then on, he's gifted. From then on,
[1:26:54] his name IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FATHER'S
[1:26:57] is on the check. So, when you've got the
[1:26:59] Holy Ghost and you've been given them
[1:27:01] the checkbook, from then on, you sign
[1:27:04] whatever you want.
[1:27:07] Your name is as good as his name. He
[1:27:10] says, and because he's the boss, he's
[1:27:13] over the straw bosses now.
[1:27:16] You don't have to walk in fear. You
[1:27:19] don't have to walk in anxiety. You don't
[1:27:21] have to walk in depression. You don't
[1:27:23] have to walk in torment.
[1:27:26] You don't have to walk in SLEEPLESS
[1:27:27] NIGHTS. WHY? BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE THE BOSS
[1:27:30] of the straw boss.
[1:27:37] And that's exactly he says what God did
[1:27:39] with his own son. Think about this these
[1:27:42] laws and how this all begins to play out
[1:27:44] from the very beginning. He had to take
[1:27:46] his own son and he proved him in every
[1:27:48] way he could. He took him up on the
[1:27:50] mountain
[1:27:52] and said, "If you'll do this, you can
[1:27:54] have all of this.
[1:27:56] And if you're hungry, all you got to do
[1:27:58] is speak and it'll be given." And he
[1:28:01] tempted HIM IN EVERY SINGLE WAY
[1:28:03] POSSIBLE. AND HE TRIED HIM AND HE proved
[1:28:05] him in everything. And in St. Matthew,
[1:28:10] he took him up on a mount. AND UP ON
[1:28:11] THAT MOUNTAIN THERE BECAME AN OVERSHADOW
[1:28:14] of a cloud of glory upon him. And so
[1:28:17] CHRIST IS NOW THERE in a raignment and
[1:28:20] the sun shined and in his arignment AND
[1:28:22] A VOICE COMES OUT OF heaven where Peter,
[1:28:25] James and John heard a voice and it said
[1:28:28] this is my beloved.
[1:28:30] This is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:28:32] pleased. Hear ye him.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; THAT IS ADOPTION.
[1:28:38] EVERYTHING that we have to say through
[1:28:40] adoption, JESUS WENT THROUGH IT. THAT
[1:28:42] was what Abraham's seed was. It wasn't
[1:28:45] Isaac. Yeah, sure it was Isaac and Jacob
[1:28:47] and David and on down and down, but the
[1:28:49] real seed, the real inheritance, IT WAS
[1:28:52] JESUS CHRIST COMING ON THE SCENE AND
[1:28:54] dying for you and me.
[1:28:59] You see, adoption provides the believers
[1:29:01] with the same legal rights and
[1:29:03] privileges as a natural-born child,
[1:29:05] specifically on the status of an heir.
[1:29:10] And it's because of Christ sacrifice.
[1:29:14] That's what buys the believer. IT'S UPON
[1:29:16] THAT SACRIFICE THAT BUYS THE BELIEVER
[1:29:19] OUT OF SLAVERY.
[1:29:21] You don't have to be in BONDAGE ANYMORE.
[1:29:23] IT'S BY THAT SACRIFICE THAT BUYS US OUT
[1:29:26] OF SIN. WE DON'T HAVE TO FALL TO THOSE
[1:29:29] SINFUL THINGS AND a sinful way of living
[1:29:31] anymore.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; It's because of that that we're bought.
[1:29:35] We're bought for a price that WE'RE
[1:29:36] BOUGHT OUT OF THE BONDAGE OF THIS
[1:29:38] HELLISH world that we live in. DO YOU
[1:29:40] REALIZE ONE DAY we're going to step take
[1:29:42] one step and we're going to step into
[1:29:44] eternity?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; That was bought.
[1:29:52] As an adopted believer, you receive a
[1:29:54] spirit of adoption.
[1:29:57] Can you imagine? I I I wasn't adopted. I
[1:30:01] don't think. No, I wasn't. I'm I'm just
[1:30:03] I'm not.
[1:30:12] But can you imagine
[1:30:14] being adopted
[1:30:17] and now you
[1:30:20] have been brought into a family
[1:30:23] under a spirit of adoption
[1:30:26] that you're no longer an orphan. You're
[1:30:28] no longer lost out into the world.
[1:30:30] You're no longer being tossed from this
[1:30:32] place and that place and over here and
[1:30:34] over there.
[1:30:36] But but by the spirit of adoption,
[1:30:38] you've been brought into a family, into
[1:30:40] a home, into a into a godship
[1:30:44] that you can now
[1:30:48] say, "Aba, Father."
[1:30:52] Think about that. Can you imagine not
[1:30:54] ever being able to call anybody dad?
[1:30:56] Anybody Anybody daddy?
[1:30:59] Maybe some have. I'm there's plenty that
[1:31:02] have. I know.
[1:31:04] But when YOU GOT THAT SPIRIT OF ADOPTION
[1:31:06] THAT comes in, it allows you that
[1:31:08] INTIMATE DEGREE WITH GOD TO WHERE YOU
[1:31:10] CAN SAY, "ABA, FATHER,"
[1:31:13] which is a means interpreted as papa.
[1:31:16] It's intimate. It's a relationship.
[1:31:19] Papa, daddy. And now that you've got
[1:31:22] THAT ABBA FATHER, IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS
[1:31:25] A CLOSENESS between you and him.
[1:31:28] UNDER THE SPIRIT OF ADOPTION, YOU BECOME
[1:31:30] SO CLOSE TO GOD.
[1:31:32] You become so close that YOU BECOME SO
[1:31:34] DEPENDENT AND YOU LOVE NOT JUST
[1:31:37] REVERENCE some kind of distant figure.
[1:31:41] Not a GOD OFF IN HISTORY, NOT A GOD OFF
[1:31:43] ON on Calvary or a God that that rose
[1:31:46] FROM THE DEAD, BUT NOW YOU'RE SITTING
[1:31:48] FACE TO FACE, arm in arm and looking up
[1:31:51] eye to eye say, "Aba, Father,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I love you, Papa.
[1:31:59] I love you, Papa.
[1:32:01] For once I was lost,
[1:32:03] but you you found me. For once, I was
[1:32:06] astray. Once I was running through the
[1:32:08] for the things of the of the world, and
[1:32:10] I didn't have a home. I didn't have I
[1:32:12] didn't have a shelter. I didn't have
[1:32:13] food. I didn't have Raymond. But aba,
[1:32:15] Father, Papa,
[1:32:18] you took me in. You clothed me. You
[1:32:22] housed me. You forgave me. Aba
[1:32:26] father.
[1:32:28] Jesus when the garden OF GETHSEMANE HE
[1:32:31] SAYS aba father
[1:32:35] if it be your will let this cup pass.
[1:32:38] Aba father.
[1:32:42] AND IN TALKING ABOUT ADOPTION PAUL
[1:32:44] WRITES that the believers receive the
[1:32:46] spirit of ADOPTION AND IT ALLOWS YOU AND
[1:32:48] IT it enables you to CRY ABBA FATHER.
[1:32:52] AND PAUL SAYS THAT IS TO SIGNIFY A NEW
[1:32:54] IDENTITY. I'M no longer who I was. I'm a
[1:32:58] new creation in Christ. So now with the
[1:33:01] spirit on the inside, I can now cry aba
[1:33:03] father.
[1:33:08] Romans 8:14 says believers are joint hes
[1:33:11] with Christ. Galatians 4:47 says God
[1:33:14] sent his son to redeem those under the
[1:33:15] law to receive adoption. Ephesians 5 1
[1:33:19] and5 says God predestinated believers
[1:33:21] for the adoption according to his
[1:33:23] pleasure and his will.
[1:33:26] You say, "Man, you you really on
[1:33:28] adoption TONIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
[1:33:30] YOU KNOW MOSES was adopted?"
[1:33:34] SURE. MOSES WAS ADOPTED. IT TELLS US
[1:33:36] RIGHT there in Exodus. It says the child
[1:33:38] grew as she brought him into Pharaoh's
[1:33:40] daughter and he became her son.
[1:33:45] HE BECAME HER SON. SO, WHILE SHE WAS OUT
[1:33:48] BATHING IN THE NILE, Pharaoh's daughter
[1:33:50] uh is out there bathing in the vial. She
[1:33:52] notices A LITTLE PAPYRUS BASKET UP ON
[1:33:54] the reeds. And she goes down there and
[1:33:56] she picks up this little basket, open it
[1:33:58] up, and what does she find but a crying
[1:34:00] baby
[1:34:02] that was us before adoption,
[1:34:05] a bunch of crying babies.
[1:34:08] and she looks at this crying baby and
[1:34:10] she and Moses's sister Miriam says,
[1:34:12] "Hey, I I'll go find you a Hebrew woman
[1:34:14] who can nurse this child." And the
[1:34:17] princess agrees,
[1:34:19] unknowingly hiring Moses's real mother,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Jockabed.
[1:34:26] AND SO JOCKABED NOW COMES AND SHE BEGINS
[1:34:28] TO CARE FOR MOSES AND through his early
[1:34:31] childhood. But once he grew older, about
[1:34:33] the age of two or three, he was brought
[1:34:35] back into the palace where the princess
[1:34:38] officially adopted him as her son. NOW I
[1:34:40] WANT YOU TO watch this. She named him
[1:34:43] Moses, which means in in Hebrew to draw
[1:34:47] out and in Moses in Egyptian means son.
[1:34:54] to draw out my son.
[1:35:02] Esther,
[1:35:06] you see, you don't think about these
[1:35:07] people, do you? We think about adoption.
[1:35:10] We don't think about these people. Here
[1:35:12] was Esther
[1:35:14] adopted by her cousin Mori.
[1:35:18] The Bible says he brought her up. He
[1:35:20] brought up Hadassa, that is Esther, his
[1:35:22] uncle's daughter, for she had neither
[1:35:24] father nor mother.
[1:35:26] She was uh and was made for was fair and
[1:35:29] beautiful for whom Mordei when her
[1:35:31] father and mother were dead, took for
[1:35:34] his own daughter.
[1:35:39] So here's Esther. NOW ESTHER'S PARENTS
[1:35:42] DIE leaving her as an orphan. How many
[1:35:45] times have we ever felt orphaned?
[1:35:47] SURE WE HAVE. WE FELT MANY TIMES LIKE,
[1:35:49] "DOES ANYBODY CARE? Does anybody hear?
[1:35:51] Does anybody know? Am I still living and
[1:35:53] walking? Can anybody see me?"
[1:35:58] An orphan. And so here's Esther now, an
[1:36:01] orphaned, an orphan body. AND MORI TAKES
[1:36:05] her in to raise her in his own home.
[1:36:09] Aren't you thankful we have a house of
[1:36:11] God that we can come IN AND SAY, "I'M
[1:36:12] GOING TO GOD'S HOUSE, AND I AM A
[1:36:15] WELCOMED CHILD THERE.
[1:36:18] THAT I CAN SET I CAN PULL UP TO THE
[1:36:20] TABLE of the pull pit and hear and be
[1:36:23] fed and feed on the word of God as it
[1:36:25] comes forth.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Esther,
[1:36:31] you know what her name means? I just
[1:36:33] can't help it. I hope you can see the
[1:36:35] picture. Star.
[1:36:38] Abraham's seed will be as the stars of
[1:36:41] the sky.
[1:36:45] Jacob's grandsons.
[1:36:48] Jacob
[1:36:49] adopted I don't know if you realize it,
[1:36:52] but he adopted Ephraim and Manass as his
[1:36:55] own.
[1:36:59] You say, "Well, I thought that was
[1:37:00] Joseph's boys."
[1:37:04] And now thy two sons, Ephraim and
[1:37:06] Manasseh, which were born unto thee in
[1:37:08] the land of Egypt, before I came unto
[1:37:11] thee in Egypt, are mine.
[1:37:16] Are mine as Reuben and Simeon, they are
[1:37:19] mine. So Jacob now declared that Ephraim
[1:37:23] and Manass would be his. HE WAS TAKING
[1:37:26] AN ADOPTION PLACE AND HE WAS PLACING
[1:37:28] them on equal legal footing with his own
[1:37:32] two eldest sons, Reuben and Simeon.
[1:37:35] Think about this. AND HERE WE SEE THIS
[1:37:37] ADOPTION took place towards the end of
[1:37:39] his life. And Joseph brings his two sons
[1:37:41] to Jacob at his bedside when he hears
[1:37:43] how he's ill and how he's dying. And
[1:37:46] here Jacob tells him that if any of your
[1:37:49] future children born to Joseph would
[1:37:51] remain Joseph's heir. He brings those
[1:37:54] two sons here. LISTEN, HE BRINGS THOSE
[1:37:57] TWO sons there, Ephraim and Manassth.
[1:38:00] Now, keep in mind that traditionally
[1:38:02] there is a double portion of blessings
[1:38:04] upon the firstborn.
[1:38:07] Any of the firstborn, they get a double
[1:38:09] portion of the inheritance.
[1:38:13] But because Reuben
[1:38:15] had forfeited his birth or his
[1:38:17] birthright to due to misconduct,
[1:38:20] Jacob now transfers his double portion
[1:38:23] to Joseph by elevating his two sons.
[1:38:30] Are you with me?
[1:38:34] Here we are preserving a covenant. We're
[1:38:37] preserving an identity. These two boys
[1:38:39] were born in Egypt to an Egyptian
[1:38:41] mother, Asani.
[1:38:42] and they were born there. But adoption
[1:38:45] placed them fully integrated into the
[1:38:47] covenant family of Abraham, Isaac,
[1:38:50] Jacob.
[1:38:52] It took them out of that old Egyptian
[1:38:54] culture.
[1:38:57] You see, you may have been born out into
[1:38:59] the world. You may have been born
[1:39:02] speaking lies. But when AN ADOPTION
[1:39:04] TAKES PLACE AND GOD LAYS HIS hand on
[1:39:07] you, you receive a double portion from
[1:39:09] heaven. And that double portion SAYS
[1:39:11] THAT YOU'RE NOW A SON or daughter of
[1:39:14] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. No longer
[1:39:17] Egyptian,
[1:39:28] crossing of his hands.
[1:39:31] He crossed his hands
[1:39:34] and through Manasse, although Manassus
[1:39:36] was the was the firstborn, Jacob crossed
[1:39:39] his hands and he places his right hand
[1:39:40] on the of the primary blessing on the
[1:39:43] younger one, Ephraim. And he places his
[1:39:46] hand on Ephraim and his left hand on
[1:39:48] Manass.
[1:39:50] When we look at this, WE SEE THAT
[1:39:52] DESPITE JOSEPH, JOSEPH SAID, "NO, NO,
[1:39:54] NO, FATHER. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? This
[1:39:57] is not right. This was the firstborn."
[1:39:59] and and and Jacob looks at him and says,
[1:40:01] "While Manasseh will be a great people,
[1:40:05] Ephraim will be even greater."
[1:40:13] This prophecy was fulfilled as we see
[1:40:17] the tribe of Ephraim became the most
[1:40:19] influential tribe in the northern
[1:40:22] kingdom of Israel.
[1:40:25] Do you realize that adoption plays such
[1:40:28] a major part in our lives?
[1:40:32] To be adopted into the into the into the
[1:40:35] family of God, to be adopted into
[1:40:37] Christ, to be under that shed blood, to
[1:40:39] be with in Christ and allow Christ to
[1:40:41] dwell and move and be in our lives and
[1:40:43] in our families and in our homes and in
[1:40:45] our jobs.
[1:40:47] You know, I I feel like I repeat that a
[1:40:48] lot, but I don't repeat that to be
[1:40:50] repetitive, but I say that because it's
[1:40:53] the truth.
[1:40:54] It is the truth. WHERE WOULD WE BE
[1:40:56] WITHOUT GOD IN OUR LIVES?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Thank God for adoption. Musicians, why
[1:41:02] don't you make your way up? Isaiah 43.
[1:41:05] We'll read this here as we close. But
[1:41:08] now, thus says the Lord, he who created
[1:41:12] you, he who formed you, fear not, for I
[1:41:18] have redeemed you. I have called you by
[1:41:22] name.
[1:41:24] and you are mine.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet tonight.
[1:41:41] I have called you by name.
[1:41:47] Glenn,
[1:41:48] Debbie,
[1:41:51] Sarah,
[1:41:57] put your name there. We could go through
[1:42:00] the whole list,
[1:42:03] but it's not your neighbor's name.
[1:42:06] He says, "I called you by name
[1:42:10] and you are mine."
[1:42:14] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:42:17] we come before you tonight, Lord, with
[1:42:19] grateful hearts. Lord, trust this
[1:42:21] service, Lord, was
[1:42:25] edifying to the body. I know it was more
[1:42:27] teaching a lot of scriptures and just
[1:42:30] laying foundation, Father. But Lord, we
[1:42:33] need foundational
[1:42:34] preaching and teaching because teaching
[1:42:37] is what places us. It It allows us to be
[1:42:40] able to see who we are.
[1:42:42] It leads us. It guides us. It brings to
[1:42:45] our awareness the lives that we're
[1:42:48] living
[1:42:49] and what's going on around us and how we
[1:42:52] can tie it back through the scriptures.
[1:42:55] And when we think about
[1:42:58] the promise that was made
[1:43:01] to Abraham and his covenant that was
[1:43:04] made, it was a covenant that the promise
[1:43:06] that could never be broken.
[1:43:10] It was a covenant of promises
[1:43:13] that gives us deliverance. It gives us
[1:43:15] freedom. It gives us an assurance in
[1:43:17] this hour to know that we're one of
[1:43:19] yours.
[1:43:21] And whatever we have need of, our needs
[1:43:24] will be met. Our supplies will be there
[1:43:28] for you supply all our needs, Lord.
[1:43:33] Lord, in an hour when we see the news
[1:43:35] and the shakiness of what's going on in
[1:43:36] the world and and we we just don't know.
[1:43:39] It's going so fast you can't even keep
[1:43:40] up with it.
[1:43:44] Rumors of war, wars,
[1:43:47] dictators coming coming to head,
[1:43:49] dictators being cast aside, new
[1:43:52] leadership, peace, peace,
[1:43:56] trading oil.
[1:44:00] Millions and millions of barrels of oil
[1:44:03] are being traded. You say, "What's that
[1:44:05] got to do?" It's got to do with a lot.
[1:44:09] When you study the message in the hour
[1:44:11] we're living in,
[1:44:14] when they cry peace, peace, and there's
[1:44:16] war and rumors of war, and when when
[1:44:18] they go for that oil.
[1:44:25] So Lord, we just want to find our place
[1:44:26] in you tonight.
[1:44:29] We want to accept the full adoption for
[1:44:31] the hour that we're living in
[1:44:34] and receive all the promises of
[1:44:37] Abraham's seed.
[1:44:40] We love you, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:44:45] I'm a new creation.
[1:44:49] I'm a brand new man.
[1:44:53] All things are passed away.
[1:44:58] I've been born again.
[1:45:02] More than a coner.

[1:46:22] There are people almost everywhere whose
[1:46:26] hearts are all a flame with the fire
[1:46:29] that fell at Pentecost which then made
[1:46:34] them clean. Oh, it is burning now within
[1:46:38] my heart. All glory to his name. And I'm
[1:46:42] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.

[1:46:59] them.

[1:47:08] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:47:12] them.
[1:47:15] Although these people may not learn to
[1:47:18] be nor boast of worldly fame, they have
[1:47:23] all received their Pentecost, baptized
[1:47:26] in Jesus name, and are telling now both
[1:47:31] far and wide, his power is yet the same.

[1:47:39] them. with all your hearts. I'm one of
[1:47:43] them.

[1:47:53] them.

[1:48:06] them.
