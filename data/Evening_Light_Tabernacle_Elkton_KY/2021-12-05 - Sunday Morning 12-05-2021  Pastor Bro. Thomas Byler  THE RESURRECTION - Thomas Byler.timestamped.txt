[5:27] wow
[8:24] okay yeah
[11:32] morning brothers and sisters uh i'll
[11:34] just ask my dad to start
[11:36] start us off in prayer
[12:16] all right let's read uh psalms 90
[12:18] starting with the first one
[12:20] yeah you could all stand
[12:28] oh and also uh children dismissed
[12:36] [Music]
[12:40] lord thou hast been our dwelling place
[12:42] in all generations
[12:53] melatonous man to destruction and says
[12:56] return
[12:57] you children of men
[13:07] thou carries them away as with the flood
[13:10] they are as asleep in the morning they
[13:14] are like grass which growth up
[13:24] for we are consumed by thine anger and
[13:27] by thy wrath we are troubled
[13:38] for all our days are passed
[13:40] away in thy wrath we spend our years as
[13:43] a tale that is told
[13:59] you know what the power of thine anger
[14:01] even according to thy fear so is thy
[14:04] wrath
[14:11] return o lord how long and let it repent
[14:14] thee concerning thy servants
[14:25] make us glad according to the days where
[14:27] and now has afflicted us and the years
[14:31] wherein we have seen evil
[14:39] and let the beauty of the lord our god
[14:42] be upon us and establish thou work of
[14:45] our hands upon us yea the work of our
[14:48] hands established
[15:08] yeah i can remember being a young man
[15:10] one time and coming up to a pulpit
[15:12] brothers and sisters it isn't an easy
[15:14] thing so
[15:15] the first couple of times are hard to
[15:17] get through but after that god gives you
[15:19] grace
[15:21] if you would turn with me to
[15:23] ecclesiastes the third chapter
[15:35] i was uh in that song there was a lot
[15:38] lots of nuggets in that song
[15:40] you know as you know we're about to
[15:42] finish this year
[15:44] 2021 going into 2022
[15:48] and i was just sitting there thought
[15:50] come to me you know
[15:52] you know
[15:53] if you
[15:54] historically if you read our country's
[15:56] histories
[15:58] in the 1920s our country went into a
[16:01] period of great lawlessness you know all
[16:04] kinds of longestness going on in the
[16:06] country in the 1920s and most of us
[16:10] there's very few people probably alive
[16:12] today that would even
[16:14] would walk in the earth you know as
[16:16] young men in the 20s or 30s during that
[16:18] period of time and you look you know
[16:21] history just repeats itself time and
[16:23] time and time again it just people can't
[16:26] you know people are people they're just
[16:28] manifest who they are and we're
[16:30] in our own country we see loudness
[16:33] again in our in the same time frame 100
[16:36] years later so you can't get away from
[16:39] the fact that human beings are human
[16:41] beings they're going to manifest what
[16:42] they are
[16:44] and without law and order that
[16:45] manifestation gets worse and worse and
[16:48] worse
[16:49] and uh i was just thinking i was
[16:51] i'll jump over to isaiah i was just
[16:54] thinking this morning
[16:57] that
[16:58] best way to say it is
[17:00] you can't say it anymore you know you
[17:02] can't be surprised anymore about the
[17:04] things that go on around you what goes
[17:06] on in the church or on in the world
[17:08] because like i said before people are
[17:10] people and it's like the brothers have
[17:13] been preaching it we're well past
[17:15] manifestation time people are starting
[17:18] to reveal
[17:19] you're seeing whether it's in the
[17:20] message of the hour whether it's in our
[17:22] country your communities people are
[17:26] they can't surprise you anymore because
[17:27] they're just manifest you know
[17:29] manifesting what
[17:31] out of their heart what they really are
[17:34] does will that change should that change
[17:36] you that shouldn't change whatever
[17:38] people do out i'm will it shake your
[17:40] confidence will it will it hurt your
[17:42] feelings
[17:44] we're all human beings people that we've
[17:46] walked this way with or well i don't i'm
[17:49] only 62 years old some people are a lot
[17:52] older than me you've walked this way for
[17:54] 20 or 30 years with people and you see
[17:56] people turning away should it change
[17:58] your confidence and knowing that you're
[18:00] following the truth it shouldn't bother
[18:02] you at all it should make you strive
[18:04] more
[18:04] to stay on the path but i'll just read
[18:07] you know they read the first 10 verses a
[18:09] lot of times at funeral but i'm going to
[18:11] start at about
[18:13] the 10th first and this is what you know
[18:15] this is thousands of years ago
[18:17] you know and just like proverbs or
[18:20] ecclesiastes
[18:21] or psalms you know god's truth are
[18:24] eternal and it goes back i hate to say
[18:27] it again but it goes back to human
[18:29] nature and human beings they're
[18:30] constantly going to do the same they
[18:32] might have more technology or less
[18:34] technology but they're still going to do
[18:36] the same things if that
[18:38] if that wicked seed is in them and they
[18:40] haven't confessed jesus christ as their
[18:42] lord and savior they're just going to
[18:44] keep on doing wicked things i'll just
[18:46] read from the 10th verse it says
[18:49] i've seen the travail which god hath
[18:52] given to the sons of man to be exercised
[18:55] in it
[18:56] he has made everything beautiful in his
[18:58] time also he has set the world in their
[19:01] heart
[19:02] so no man can find out the work that god
[19:05] maketh from the beginning to the end
[19:08] i know that there is no good in them for
[19:11] but for man to rejoice
[19:13] and to do good in his life you know
[19:15] that's everyone's desire everyone should
[19:17] desire to do good and enjoy your life
[19:21] no matter what's going on around you
[19:23] also that every man should eat and drink
[19:25] and enjoy the good of his labor
[19:27] it is the gift of god you know sometimes
[19:29] work ain't an easy thing but it's
[19:31] something that god gives you to provide
[19:32] for yourself and your family
[19:35] and through that you should enjoy the
[19:36] fruits of your labor that's not an evil
[19:38] thing
[19:39] but it goes on to say
[19:42] also every man should eat and drink and
[19:44] enjoy the good of all the slavers it is
[19:46] the gift of god
[19:48] i know that whatsoever god doeth it
[19:51] shall be for
[19:53] it shall be forever nothing can be put
[19:55] to it for anything taken from it god do
[19:58] with it that men should fear before him
[20:01] you know
[20:02] the this whole chapter here is just
[20:03] letting you know that it's god's
[20:05] providence everything we do as human
[20:08] beings whether you're a christian or not
[20:10] it's in god's hands it's in his
[20:12] providence and it should give you
[20:14] comfort to know that god cares enough
[20:16] about you the steer your life to take
[20:19] you in a direction that you need to go
[20:21] and he goes on i'm i hate to i keep
[20:24] doing this all the time i keep
[20:26] re reading the same scriptures again and
[20:28] the 15th verse
[20:30] that which has been that which hath been
[20:32] is now and that which is to be has
[20:34] already been and god requireth which is
[20:37] path
[20:38] moreover i saw under the sun a place of
[20:41] judgment
[20:42] that wickedness was there in the place
[20:44] of righteousness that iniquity was there
[20:47] and in my heart god shall judge the
[20:49] righteous and the wicked for her time
[20:52] for every purpose for every work
[20:54] and i said in my heart concerning the
[20:57] estates of the sons of man
[20:59] that god might manifest them
[21:01] that they might see that they themselves
[21:03] are beast
[21:04] for that which befalleth the sons of man
[21:07] befalleth beast even one thing befalleth
[21:10] them as one dieth so diet the other yea
[21:13] they all have one breath so that a man
[21:15] has no preeminence above the beast for
[21:17] all as many so basically solomon's
[21:20] saying here he doesn't whether you're
[21:21] righteous or wicked don't make a
[21:23] difference we all have that appointment
[21:25] one day unless your raps are out of here
[21:27] and
[21:28] you're all going to meet that in one day
[21:30] whether you're a beast or a man everyone
[21:33] goes to that appointed time in their
[21:34] lives and the only thing we can do like
[21:37] this psalm is saying
[21:40] is committed to god and in and enjoy the
[21:43] life that god's given you and he goes on
[21:45] to say i'll go on to one place all our
[21:48] deaths and all will turn to dust again
[21:51] who knoweth the spirit of man that goes
[21:54] upward and the spirit of the beast that
[21:56] goeth downward to the earth wherefore i
[21:58] perceive that there is nothing better
[22:00] than a man should rejoice in his own
[22:02] words for that is that is his portion
[22:06] for who shall bring to see excuse me my
[22:09] pronunciation here who shall bring to
[22:11] him to see what you'll be after him you
[22:13] know i i'm not trying to be funny here
[22:16] but all of you know that you get around
[22:18] people that you work with eight or ten
[22:20] hours a day and all they do is complain
[22:23] nothing is good enough for them you
[22:24] can't do
[22:25] you can't do them right enough it just
[22:28] don't you know there's just those kind
[22:29] of people and while i read that i'm not
[22:31] trying to be funny here but you those
[22:34] people come to your mind no matter what
[22:35] they do that's not good enough for them
[22:38] they're not thankful for anything that
[22:40] they get in life that's not the kind of
[22:43] spirit that a christian should have and
[22:45] i'm gonna jump up here to
[22:47] isaiah the 59th chapter here not i know
[22:50] i get
[22:51] get in a hurry sometimes
[22:54] but i was thinking
[22:55] um
[23:00] this is i was reading that book uh that
[23:03] brother green had this morning i meant
[23:04] to bring him with me but uh i told you
[23:06] nether i know there's something i forgot
[23:08] at the house when we got here but in
[23:10] that book i was reading that page
[23:14] and this is that chapter that deals with
[23:16] and
[23:17] whatever you see out there in the world
[23:19] or in the church
[23:20] this i'll read i'll jump to this to this
[23:23] 19th verse i know you're going to have a
[23:25] hard time following me
[23:27] but no matter what goes on out there if
[23:29] you're god's child and he's got his
[23:32] hands over your life he's going to raise
[23:34] the standard for you for the age that
[23:36] you live in but i'll just read this
[23:37] verse and then i'll jump back to the
[23:39] first verse
[23:40] he goes
[23:41] according to their deeds according
[23:44] accordingly he will repay fury to his
[23:46] adversaries or replicants to his enemies
[23:49] to the island she will repay replicants
[23:52] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[23:54] from the west in his glory from the
[23:56] rising of the sun
[23:58] when the enemy shall come in like a
[23:59] flood
[24:01] the spirit of the lord shall lift up the
[24:03] standard against him and the redeemer
[24:06] shall come to zion and on to them
[24:08] that turned from transgressions in jacob
[24:11] saith the lord so that's what you know
[24:13] he was talking brother green was talking
[24:15] about how brother bradham used that
[24:16] scripture a lot and you know we're
[24:19] several years past that time but god has
[24:22] a standard and got to raise everything
[24:24] up so that you can be successful for the
[24:26] age that you live and don't ever let the
[24:28] circumstances in your life or the
[24:31] circumstances out there ever affect your
[24:33] relationship god will raise you up in
[24:36] the age that you live in that's a
[24:37] promise
[24:39] and the world's goal and the enemy's
[24:41] goal is to get you to not look at that
[24:43] promise and to cloud your eyes are over
[24:45] so that you don't see that promise that
[24:47] god has for you and he goes on to say
[24:50] here and the redeemer shall come to zion
[24:53] unto them
[24:54] and turn from trying to aggression and
[24:56] jacob saith the lord for as for me this
[24:58] is my covenant with them saith the lord
[25:01] my spirit that is upon thee my words
[25:03] which i have put in thy mouth shall not
[25:06] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[25:08] mouth of thy seed
[25:10] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[25:12] saith the lord from hence
[25:15] and forever you know that really is
[25:17] important
[25:18] for us this morning i was going to read
[25:20] some more scriptures but i'll just stop
[25:22] at this point and the age that we live
[25:24] in there's two important things you have
[25:25] to have the spirit of christ abiding in
[25:27] your heart and life and that spirit will
[25:30] bring you into fellowship with god's
[25:32] word without those two things
[25:34] we're lost without
[25:36] the message of the hour the revelation
[25:38] that we're living in the spirit of
[25:40] christ in you that's the only hope we
[25:42] have this morning as human beings is
[25:44] that we're we're holding to god's word
[25:46] for the age that we live in and that's
[25:48] the standard that god will raise in your
[25:50] hearts and lives so you're successful
[25:53] in the day that we're living brother

[57:22] we're thankful to have brother tommy
[57:24] aren't we amen because i'll tell you
[57:25] what
[57:26] uh
[57:27] you know
[57:29] what he went through and and and
[57:31] the trial basically that has been sent
[57:33] to brother tommy and tammy uh it's a
[57:36] pretty big one amen and i'm telling you
[57:38] it's just a grace of god
[57:40] uh you know that he's sitting there this
[57:42] morning
[57:43] amen and so
[57:45] you know last night i was listening to
[57:47] brother branham preaching on that i
[57:49] believe it was an adoption
[57:51] and it was on it was funny kind of how i
[57:53] had thought about that quote and then
[57:55] and he mentions it while i was listening
[57:57] to him he says he was talking about how
[57:58] that you know
[57:59] how do you know that by the time you get
[58:02] home you know you're not you're going to
[58:03] find out that your loved one's not even
[58:05] alive anymore
[58:07] you know and he went to great detail to
[58:08] tell you how do you know you're ever
[58:10] going to leave here
[58:12] you know you don't know you know the
[58:14] many are preachers how do i know that i
[58:15] won't fall dead you know or whatever it
[58:18] is we have no promise of the next five
[58:21] minutes isn't that right
[58:22] and so that's how fragile this life is
[58:26] how uncertain this life is amen
[58:29] amen and so but we're so thankful for
[58:32] what god has done for brother tommy and
[58:34] amen and sparing him the grace of god
[58:36] spared him and we've got him with him
[58:38] and and we're so glad for that he's
[58:40] going to give us a testimony but i mean
[58:41] i want to give an update first of all uh
[58:44] you know i want to read sister tammy's
[58:46] uh testimony and
[58:49] and uh a little update that she gave
[58:51] amen
[58:52] amen and so she says it this way and
[58:54] i'll tell you what i mean i really
[58:56] appreciate sister tammy i'll tell you
[58:57] what i know she's a real wife amen she's
[59:00] a real good woman amen for brother tommy

[59:11] brother tommy's been a real friend to me
[59:13] amen
[59:14] and i appreciate his friends yet i'm
[59:16] glad to have him around amen and so a
[59:18] pastor sometimes doesn't get to have
[59:20] friends because
[59:21] amen it's just you know it's touchy
[59:23] situation amen and and you have to be
[59:26] able to know your pastor's fault and
[59:28] still have confidence him amen
[59:30] and and so forth and so we appreciate
[59:33] amy and all of you
[59:34] but i want to just read an update that
[59:36] she gave
[59:37] and then she says she just wanted to
[59:39] give a little update on tommy
[59:41] we are taking one day at a time amen and
[59:44] that's pretty much where it is and

[59:47] healing
[59:48] we want to thank each and every one of
[59:50] you for your continued prayers
[59:53] and his next cat scan will be in january

[1:00:01] able to find a torn
[1:00:03] aorta but a perfectly strong and healthy
[1:00:06] one amen how many people believe for
[1:00:08] that
[1:00:10] yes sir amen i know that scientists and
[1:00:13] doctors and all that they may have
[1:00:14] negative
[1:00:16] things to say but
[1:00:17] that was one something else the prophet
[1:00:19] said you know during that time he says
[1:00:20] you know no matter what the doctor tells
[1:00:22] you you've got a higher power you've got
[1:00:25] the great physician that doesn't mean
[1:00:27] anything amen
[1:00:28] it's what god says amen what god's word
[1:00:31] is that's what really matters
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:36] amen so he says but a healthy one we
[1:00:38] want to see tommy doing what he loves
[1:00:41] again
[1:00:42] climbing trees with his bow amen
[1:00:45] and building is strong and heavy
[1:00:47] furniture amen
[1:00:49] i don't know anybody that knows brother
[1:00:51] tommy knows that i've called him an
[1:00:53] engineer as he's an engineer and why did
[1:00:56] he didn't pick him up and get it take
[1:00:57] him to the kennedy space center i don't
[1:00:59] know but he can just about do anything
[1:01:01] and so it's amazing from welding plastic
[1:01:05] to
[1:01:06] i just don't know what all just all
[1:01:08] kinds of things amen so we appreciate it
[1:01:10] now notice so he says and

[1:01:17] visits we appreciate it so much and pray
[1:01:20] that the lord will bless us each and
[1:01:22] every one of you amen for with god shall
[1:01:25] be nothing him shall be impossible luke
[1:01:28] 1 37
[1:01:29] and he said these things are impossible
[1:01:31] with men but
[1:01:33] possible with god luke 18
[1:01:35] and jesus looking upon them saith with
[1:01:38] men it is impossible but not with god
[1:01:40] for with god
[1:01:42] all things are possible
[1:01:44] how many believes that
[1:01:46] and that is in mark 10 and 27 jesus
[1:01:49] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:52] forever

[1:02:11] to do something back for him now
[1:02:14] how many believes we need to do that
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:16] and so those anybody listening out there
[1:02:18] i've
[1:02:19] it's been laid upon my heart to take up
[1:02:21] a love offering for him i know he can't
[1:02:23] work right now and so forth and he's got
[1:02:25] a lot of medical bills him and tammy has
[1:02:27] and and
[1:02:28] and
[1:02:28] you know you can only imagine
[1:02:31] the amount of medical bills that's
[1:02:32] that's stacked up for him and so forth
[1:02:34] so amen
[1:02:36] but they're like they said one day at a
[1:02:37] time
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] and god will take care of it amen
[1:02:42] and so we want to help him next weekend
[1:02:44] i'm going to take a blubber offering for
[1:02:46] him amen next weekend for them to help
[1:02:48] him along life's way amen and so i also
[1:02:51] talked to uh brother david beachy
[1:02:54] woody's dad he's kind of the agent for
[1:02:56] cam
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] and he said that he said you know that
[1:03:00] whatever the church gives up to five
[1:03:02] thousand dollars that they'll match it
[1:03:05] amen so that's a wonderful thing amen
[1:03:07] that'll be wonderful so i believe god
[1:03:09] i'm i'm trusting for that and maybe more
[1:03:11] i'm just believing for
[1:03:14] you know a good number amen and let's
[1:03:16] just pray that god will put it later on
[1:03:18] everybody's heart to help amen amen and
[1:03:20] so i believe that that we can do that
[1:03:23] for for brother tommy amen
[1:03:25] and through the grace of god
[1:03:27] and we sure love him and uh i once went
[1:03:30] to see him yesterday and i told him i

[1:04:03] surgery amen and i think we should hold
[1:04:05] to that lord he don't have to have
[1:04:07] surgery because a great physician can
[1:04:08] take care of it
[1:04:10] amen have we seen god do that miracle
[1:04:12] bring him through
[1:04:14] amen and so we love him very dearly amen

[1:05:21] as i laid there in the hospital not
[1:05:22] knowing whether i was going to live or
[1:05:24] die
[1:05:25] you stop and look at your life a little
[1:05:28] different way
[1:05:29] you realize how much you love your
[1:05:31] family and your friends
[1:05:35] and all those and you
[1:05:38] feel like it's way too early to leave
[1:05:41] but most of all you think of the lord
[1:05:43] and how much of your life you wish you
[1:05:44] could change and all the things you do
[1:05:46] different
[1:05:49] so for now i just want to keep it short
[1:05:51] and sweet
[1:05:54] i'm supposed to keep my heart rate down
[1:05:56] every night keep my blood pressure down
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:00] so i gotta read and not get off track
[1:06:02] here
[1:06:03] well sometime later on i'd like to share
[1:06:05] a lot more but
[1:06:09] i said where's that
[1:06:28] all the things you'd like to do
[1:06:29] different i just want to keep it short
[1:06:30] and sweet but god is awesome yeah and
[1:06:34] for everybody that don't know what
[1:06:35] happened to me it's called a aorta
[1:06:39] dissection
[1:06:40] it's the main trunk i got a type b the
[1:06:42] main trunk comes off the bottom of my
[1:06:44] heart feeds all this down through here
[1:06:46] it tore on me and what's happening is
[1:06:48] like they explained to me it's like a
[1:06:50] tire
[1:06:51] two plies and my inner my inner ply tore
[1:06:55] so now the outside plies the only thing
[1:06:58] holding it and it's trying to push blood
[1:07:00] in between the two plies pushing down
[1:07:03] and uh the rub if it ruptures you know i
[1:07:06] die immediately and you know they said
[1:07:08] that like most people die or a lot of
[1:07:10] people die in like 2.7 seconds you know
[1:07:13] so that's just a miracle in itself and
[1:07:15] then it's like the percentage rate was
[1:07:18] like 28 of people
[1:07:20] going on the way to the hospital die
[1:07:23] and you know it's just crazy statistics
[1:07:25] with it
[1:07:26] but you know
[1:07:28] god is
[1:07:29] he was looking out for me and when i got
[1:07:31] life-flighted they i got there they were
[1:07:33] surrounding me with doctors and nurses
[1:07:34] it was crazy and hectic
[1:07:36] and a lot of people and a lot of a lot
[1:07:38] to adore i had doctors all the way
[1:07:40] around the room you know it was just
[1:07:42] like wow you know what's going on here
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:45] they was prepping me for heart surgery
[1:07:47] and everything but he wanted to hold off
[1:07:50] and do another cat scan just to get
[1:07:51] their game plan together
[1:07:53] and you know with all our players
[1:07:56] the lord stepped in i didn't have to
[1:07:58] have surgery
[1:07:59] because after the cat scan came back
[1:08:01] they seen the blockage
[1:08:03] it was below my heart versus up here the
[1:08:05] type a
[1:08:06] and
[1:08:07] it had stabilized so they was able to
[1:08:10] just try to treat me
[1:08:12] and you know get my blood pressure under
[1:08:14] control and stuff
[1:08:15] and get me on all kinds of blood
[1:08:16] pressure meds and everything but you
[1:08:18] know the doctor says it will always be a
[1:08:21] tear and won't heal but you know we know
[1:08:23] the great physician that healeth all
[1:08:26] and we're believing by stripes i'm
[1:08:28] already healed
[1:08:29] he's proven to me time and time again by
[1:08:31] his grace that all things are possible
[1:08:34] if we can only believe
[1:08:36] we all have seen signs and wonders and
[1:08:39] he sent us a
[1:08:40] in miracles and he sent us a vindicated
[1:08:42] prophet and gave us the revelation of it
[1:08:45] and predestinated us all to see it
[1:08:48] and you know blessed be his name
[1:08:50] he saved me by his mercy and his grace
[1:08:52] and i told him i wouldn't be afraid to
[1:08:54] share it no more i'll do whatever his
[1:08:56] will is if you just show me the way
[1:08:59] but you know that old devil tried to
[1:09:00] tell me today that i was just gonna be
[1:09:02] my blood pressure get too high i'd be
[1:09:04] too weak but i figured boo devil when
[1:09:07] i'm weak he is strong and greater's eve
[1:09:10] is within me praise god
[1:09:12] [Applause]

[1:09:22] something
[1:09:24] lord
[1:09:25] put this on the lifeline
[1:09:31] [Applause]
[1:09:35] you might have a lot of hindrances
[1:09:38] you might have the doctor's work a
[1:09:39] scientific man who's examining yourself
[1:09:42] it might be that man told you you're
[1:09:44] going to die that's all he knows he told
[1:09:47] you all he studied his scientific uh
[1:09:50] word shows that that you must die your
[1:09:52] whole system's made and that kind of way
[1:09:54] that death is struck and there's nothing
[1:09:56] to keep it from going on you're going
[1:09:58] out that's as much
[1:09:59] as he knows no science has no medicine
[1:10:01] part
[1:10:03] but you found something
[1:10:05] and you pick up the shoulder
[1:10:08] see
[1:10:10] now of course you got a hindrance you
[1:10:11] got something to do against you that
[1:10:12] devil
[1:10:13] that disease that affection but when you
[1:10:17] strike the tip of swords with that death
[1:10:21] he revealed it to me

[1:13:47] matt i mean saint john chapter 11 verse
[1:13:51] 20. then martha as soon as she heard
[1:13:54] that jesus was coming went and met him
[1:13:57] but mary sat still in the house
[1:14:00] then said martha unto jesus lord if thou
[1:14:03] had been here my brother had not died
[1:14:07] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[1:14:09] will ask of god god will give it thee
[1:14:12] jesus saith unto her
[1:14:15] thy brother shall rise again
[1:14:18] martha said unto him i know that he
[1:14:20] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:14:22] the last day and jesus said unto her i
[1:14:25] am the resurrection and the life
[1:14:28] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:14:30] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:14:33] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:14:35] die
[1:14:36] believeth thou this
[1:14:38] she saith unto him lord
[1:14:40] yea lord i believe that thou art the
[1:14:42] christ the son of the god which should
[1:14:44] come into the world the god of his
[1:14:47] blessings to the reading of the words
[1:14:48] you can be seated
[1:14:53] amen
[1:14:55] now how many knows the outcome of this
[1:14:57] amen the outcome of this was that
[1:15:01] verse 43 he says and when he had thus
[1:15:03] spoken he cried with a loud voice
[1:15:07] lazarus
[1:15:08] come forth
[1:15:09] and he that was dead came forth bound
[1:15:12] hand and foot with grave clothes and his
[1:15:14] face was about
[1:15:16] uh was ba
[1:15:18] bound about with a napkin
[1:15:20] jesus says unto them loose him and let
[1:15:22] him go now my message this morning is
[1:15:26] the resurrection
[1:15:28] the resurrection
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:31] this
[1:15:32] channel of thought is something that i
[1:15:34] have spoke on many times or several
[1:15:36] different times before but i want to
[1:15:39] speak on it again amen
[1:15:41] because i think it does it's good the
[1:15:43] resurrection
[1:15:47] and really how i come about this
[1:15:49] you know is i was sitting in uh
[1:15:53] the new addition that we're building
[1:15:56] and in this new addition i went about
[1:15:58] four to six feet closer towards the
[1:16:01] woods back there at on our property and
[1:16:04] we put a big double window there so that
[1:16:06] we could see basically you know down a
[1:16:09] bluff it's a real steep grade
[1:16:11] and there's about 20 30 acres back there
[1:16:14] and it just goes right down and you can
[1:16:16] see the creek in the wintertime when the
[1:16:17] leaves are off
[1:16:18] and i always like to sit right there and
[1:16:20] open the window and and let the breeze
[1:16:23] just come in and have me a cup of coffee
[1:16:25] and enjoy
[1:16:26] the view amen and i was sitting there
[1:16:29] and just enjoying the wind coming off of
[1:16:31] the trees and you know i guess you know
[1:16:33] there's certain things that the trees
[1:16:35] put off right like oxygen or something
[1:16:38] you know and and my wife says she says
[1:16:40] it's cold shut that window
[1:16:42] and i was like no i like it i need some
[1:16:45] of this h2o
[1:16:50] it's honey that's water
[1:16:55] well you know i said you know what i
[1:16:57] mean that oxygen or something the trees
[1:17:00] are supposed to put off because i wasn't
[1:17:02] the greatest chemist in the world you
[1:17:04] know and i do realize it's got some some
[1:17:07] truth to it right
[1:17:08] but that hydra she says it takes in uh
[1:17:11] what was it the oxide dioxide or
[1:17:13] something
[1:17:15] abso absorb you know the wrong thing and
[1:17:17] they put off the right thing you know
[1:17:19] and i was like i just and catch your
[1:17:21] free breath i was just you know kind of
[1:17:22] overjoyed take a couple of breaths it'll
[1:17:25] make you healthier you know here we are
[1:17:27] got it coming right fresh right off the
[1:17:29] trees and i was just enjoying it sitting
[1:17:31] there just enjoying and thinking of how
[1:17:33] good god has been
[1:17:35] amen and how that you know
[1:17:37] uh you know a lot of people i told my
[1:17:39] wife a lot of people just live in a
[1:17:40] place somewhere
[1:17:42] you know but when you get a special
[1:17:44] place that it's just to your fitting and
[1:17:47] just what you like that's special
[1:17:50] amen and you know i know that even when
[1:17:52] i was living up in town and and so forth
[1:17:54] i was you know kind of dreaming of what
[1:17:56] because i'm a country boy i love to live
[1:17:58] in the country not necessarily so much
[1:17:59] in the city and now thinking of how that
[1:18:02] you know if i could just have about five
[1:18:04] acres with a little
[1:18:05] spring going by you know or something
[1:18:08] you know and maybe i could get me enough
[1:18:10] acreage just to have to you know maybe a
[1:18:12] little tractor of some kind and i
[1:18:14] imagine myself on a little tractor
[1:18:17] disking or bush hawking you know maybe a
[1:18:19] little just working on that little piece
[1:18:21] of property you know and and so forth
[1:18:23] and you know it wasn't a year and a half
[1:18:26] later that the lord blessed us with me
[1:18:28] with about 40 acres
[1:18:30] and brother william and different ones
[1:18:32] that know the peace river and i went
[1:18:34] down there and i said hey this is almost
[1:18:35] the size of the peace river this is not
[1:18:38] no little trickling spring this is you
[1:18:40] know anytime i want to go fishing i just
[1:18:41] go down over the hill
[1:18:43] and most of y'all know spa lake and so
[1:18:45] you know mike has done a lot of fishing
[1:18:47] there just i was just thinking of the
[1:18:49] goodness of god
[1:18:51] and how good god has been you know
[1:18:53] because we take things for granted
[1:18:56] we so take things for granted we don't
[1:18:58] appreciate what god has given us a lot
[1:19:01] of times and i like to just sit and
[1:19:02] thank the lord and then we'll just look
[1:19:04] at the trees and just enjoy the nature
[1:19:06] that's there and i was just thinking how
[1:19:08] wonderful it is you know how good god's
[1:19:11] been of all the hard things that a
[1:19:14] christian life is and the things that we
[1:19:16] go through and the suffering that we do
[1:19:18] and the molding that he makes is you
[1:19:20] know and the heartache we experience
[1:19:23] yet god is so good to us
[1:19:25] amen how many know god just takes care
[1:19:27] of it and and serving god is it i don't
[1:19:29] care how many heartaches is i don't care
[1:19:31] how bad it is it's still worth serving
[1:19:34] god
[1:19:36] how many believes it it's worth it to
[1:19:38] serve god amen to know that you have a
[1:19:41] hope
[1:19:43] to have hope because you know and i was
[1:19:45] thinking about the hope that we have
[1:19:47] and i thought about the the scriptures i
[1:19:50] believe it is over here i'll just read
[1:19:52] it i thought boy what would we do if we
[1:19:54] didn't have hope
[1:19:56] what would you do if you didn't have god
[1:19:59] what if you didn't have any any hope of
[1:20:02] the future right
[1:20:04] amen and how sad that would be if we
[1:20:07] didn't have hope of the future and so
[1:20:08] forth amen
[1:20:11] and in in
[1:20:13] hebrews chapter 6 this scripture came to
[1:20:16] me
[1:20:16] amen in verse 18 he says by two
[1:20:19] immutable things in which it was
[1:20:21] impossible for god to lie
[1:20:23] we might have strong consolation
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:29] you know i got to thinking there and i
[1:20:30] was sitting there thinking you know here
[1:20:32] i am right at 60 years old and why if i
[1:20:35] make this happen that'll be a wonderful
[1:20:37] thing but we don't know whether we will
[1:20:39] or not
[1:20:41] right
[1:20:42] we think of brother ivan the difference
[1:20:44] marriage and different ones that timmy
[1:20:46] man different ones that have passed away
[1:20:48] at 55 56 years old and you know i'm
[1:20:51] almost five years past that and thinking
[1:20:53] of even brother branham only around 55 i
[1:20:55] guess you know and so you think about
[1:20:57] you know you know
[1:20:59] i was thinking you know how long will i
[1:21:00] get to enjoy this
[1:21:03] and i got to thinking you know this is
[1:21:05] all just temporary
[1:21:07] i'm not going to get to enjoy this all
[1:21:09] that long we don't know how long and i
[1:21:11] thought well maybe my kids will get to
[1:21:13] enjoy it maybe when i built this deck
[1:21:15] that goes a little bit closer and i get
[1:21:17] to go out there on that deck and i get
[1:21:19] to sit on the table and i need to look
[1:21:21] down there you know maybe put some corn
[1:21:23] down there have a feed and look at the
[1:21:24] deer and look at the creation watch the
[1:21:26] squirrels the turkeys go by and you know
[1:21:28] and i thought maybe they'll sit here
[1:21:30] then
[1:21:31] then where will i be
[1:21:33] huh because let me know time goes so
[1:21:35] fast
[1:21:37] oh my well it goes so fast and i thought
[1:21:39] about maybe them inheritance and where
[1:21:41] will i be and i got to thinking about
[1:21:44] how that what what the how great it is
[1:21:46] to know that you know
[1:21:49] in this in this
[1:21:50] world everything here is temporary but
[1:21:53] for the believer
[1:21:55] there's a hope that we have
[1:21:57] then that hope is our anger
[1:22:01] the hope that we have is the anchor
[1:22:04] that there's going to be a resurrection
[1:22:07] and one day it's not going to be
[1:22:09] somebody else take over
[1:22:11] amen you'll be able to do that through
[1:22:14] the eons of time remember but the man
[1:22:16] said someday when you'll find me maybe
[1:22:18] i'm way down in the hall or somewhere
[1:22:20] down in the woods in a little old cab
[1:22:21] and you'll hear somebody singing amazing
[1:22:24] grace how sweet the sound that's brother
[1:22:26] bannon down i guess he made it
[1:22:30] looking for something that's not
[1:22:32] temporary
[1:22:34] i'm gonna have the longing in your soul
[1:22:37] for something that's not temporary
[1:22:41] we already have the assurance we already
[1:22:43] know that we have something that's
[1:22:45] eternal and no matter what happens in
[1:22:47] this world
[1:22:49] amen we have eternal life already you
[1:22:51] ain't got to worry about dying
[1:22:54] so i thought about this
[1:22:55] and this scripture says it this way
[1:22:58] we have strong consolation who have fled
[1:23:02] for refuge to lay hold upon
[1:23:05] the hope that he set before us now we
[1:23:08] all know hope paul said hope that is
[1:23:11] seen is uh not hope
[1:23:14] but why do you have to hope for
[1:23:15] something you already have
[1:23:17] but it's for something that you haven't
[1:23:19] attained to yet that you haven't seen
[1:23:21] yet then you hope for it he said
[1:23:24] amen we're still looking forward to it
[1:23:26] that is still our hope
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:30] amen and so lay hold on the hope that is
[1:23:32] set before us which hope we have
[1:23:35] as an anchor of the soul
[1:23:39] he says both sure i like that this hope
[1:23:42] is not sure but this
[1:23:44] this hope is sure
[1:23:46] and it's steadfast and it's that which
[1:23:48] entereth into the veil
[1:23:51] let me tell you something everybody out
[1:23:52] here lives for what is on the outside
[1:23:55] and the satisfying of the flesh but
[1:23:57] that's not you and i what we have hoped
[1:24:00] for goes much deeper than just the flesh
[1:24:04] because we know this flesh is just
[1:24:05] temporary but that spirit is eternal
[1:24:12] let me tell you something i don't
[1:24:14] believe that your spirit ever ages
[1:24:17] i remember john's brother john stephen
[1:24:20] amen that was he was 65 maybe somewhere
[1:24:22] in that he was pretty old you know he
[1:24:24] says but my body's getting older but i
[1:24:27] still feel the same on the inside you
[1:24:30] know and it's the same with you and my
[1:24:32] his whole body might not be able to do
[1:24:34] what it used to do it might be getting
[1:24:35] old but that person on the inside he's
[1:24:38] still the same
[1:24:42] guy he is still the same guy let me tell
[1:24:46] you i'm gonna tell you if you're not
[1:24:47] what you ought to be you have to let god
[1:24:49] change that inside guy
[1:24:53] because let me tell you people that get
[1:24:54] in a bad habit and a bad routine
[1:24:56] whatever it might be if you don't have
[1:24:58] the power of the holy ghost in there to
[1:25:00] change that you will continue to do that
[1:25:02] because this same this guy in here is
[1:25:05] still the same whether he's 30 40 50 80
[1:25:08] or 90
[1:25:10] you can look at a 90 year old person
[1:25:12] that character is still the same unless
[1:25:14] the holy ghost changes that person
[1:25:18] and how many knows that's what's
[1:25:20] important is who you really are on the
[1:25:23] inside
[1:25:24] what kind of character you have what
[1:25:26] kind of person that you are
[1:25:29] because that's what you're taking with
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:31] and then if you drop dead this morning
[1:25:34] whatever you are now that's what you'd
[1:25:36] be on the other side
[1:25:38] folks and if you ain't what you ought to
[1:25:39] be you ought to leave this service until
[1:25:41] you say god mold me and shake me and
[1:25:43] while i should be
[1:25:48] huh
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:52] i think brother tommy is an example
[1:25:55] of the grace of god but it's also an
[1:25:57] example of something out of nowhere
[1:26:01] huh
[1:26:02] just like that it can be taken
[1:26:04] it can be over with
[1:26:06] i think brother tommy i don't know if
[1:26:08] you meant 2.5 seconds or have you met
[1:26:10] 2.5 minutes
[1:26:15] is it seconds
[1:26:17] that's really quick
[1:26:20] why because that pumps out
[1:26:23] we know how quickly that can happen
[1:26:24] folks i've shot deer through the heart
[1:26:26] and they went running and they literally
[1:26:28] pass out running and ran into a tree
[1:26:31] fell over they were that just a few
[1:26:33] seconds not even get out of my sight for
[1:26:35] 20 yards it doesn't take long once that
[1:26:37] main arteries cut
[1:26:39] but the grace of god amen and aren't you
[1:26:42] glad for the grace of god but it shows
[1:26:43] how how how this life is so temporary
[1:26:47] amen but there's a hope how many dads
[1:26:49] have that hope
[1:26:51] oh my i would sit by my window with a
[1:26:55] long face and fear in my heart oh god
[1:26:58] i'm gonna have to meet you one of these
[1:27:00] days
[1:27:01] but i'm not right now i know you are
[1:27:04] mine you couldn't even enjoy the trees
[1:27:06] you could enjoy god's creation
[1:27:09] if he wasn't right in your heart
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:14] praise the lord
[1:27:17] now it's something about god's word
[1:27:20] there's many there's about two or three
[1:27:22] different examples i'd like to pull from
[1:27:24] this thought this morning
[1:27:26] one of them is a statement that the
[1:27:28] prophet of god would make
[1:27:32] and that is he would say something about
[1:27:35] let me just let me just read this quote
[1:27:37] to you
[1:27:38] because i wanted to go along with
[1:27:41] i believe it's john 11.
[1:27:45] verse 22. it goes along with this
[1:27:48] but i know that
[1:27:49] now let's
[1:27:50] go back up a verse because i want to
[1:27:52] pull a little bit here
[1:27:53] then set martha unto jesus lord if thou
[1:27:56] hast been here my brother would not have
[1:27:59] died
[1:28:00] that's what
[1:28:02] mary and martha's hope was
[1:28:05] right
[1:28:06] and they didn't like it too well
[1:28:09] because the bible clearly says that he
[1:28:10] loved martha and mary and lazarus he
[1:28:13] loved all three of them
[1:28:15] says he loved them
[1:28:17] but word came to jesus that lazarus was
[1:28:20] sick
[1:28:21] and its bible says he stayed there for a
[1:28:23] while
[1:28:25] if you read that same chapter and then
[1:28:27] after that he says let's go on over to
[1:28:29] bethany i believe it was another script
[1:28:31] another place where they had wanted to
[1:28:33] kill him and the disciple says why do
[1:28:34] you want to go back therefore they
[1:28:35] wanted to kill you
[1:28:38] he says there's only 12 days to work
[1:28:40] you know and so forth and he actually
[1:28:43] went the other way he went in a
[1:28:46] different direction and when he went in
[1:28:47] that different direction he says lazarus
[1:28:50] sleepeth
[1:28:51] you know and the disciple says you know
[1:28:53] well if he sleeps he does good he says
[1:28:55] no i want you to understand he's dead
[1:28:57] he got playing with him his day now
[1:28:58] language he's dead
[1:29:01] so he went there and he also
[1:29:03] talked about he says but you know this
[1:29:05] is uh it is to glorify god
[1:29:09] that's what it was for that's why jesus
[1:29:11] i tell you what if the spirit on the
[1:29:13] inside of him the father if that spirit
[1:29:15] would have said go he'd win
[1:29:18] but he said no go the other way he does
[1:29:20] whatever the spirit says right
[1:29:23] and so he went the other way and when he
[1:29:25] got there as the prophet of god said
[1:29:27] well i'll tell you martha and mary they
[1:29:29] had a right to ball him out
[1:29:31] we called you we followed you we gave
[1:29:33] everything up for you but yet you
[1:29:35] wouldn't come
[1:29:38] why didn't you come now he's dead
[1:29:40] how could you do that to us
[1:29:43] huh
[1:29:44] but they didn't
[1:29:46] they didn't have the bad attitude
[1:29:49] they had the right attitude
[1:29:51] they said yeah lord if you'd have been
[1:29:53] here we know what it would have happened
[1:29:57] that was this case in our age too
[1:30:00] through the ministry of brother bannon
[1:30:02] folks when he was here god was there
[1:30:04] with him at all times he backed up what
[1:30:07] he said
[1:30:08] things happened
[1:30:10] and so listen so he says
[1:30:13] he would not have died
[1:30:16] you know and something out of jesus
[1:30:18] every word jesus would say
[1:30:21] was very significant it was perfect how
[1:30:23] many beliefs these writings here they
[1:30:25] were all perfect
[1:30:26] when he said something it wasn't just
[1:30:28] idle words like what we might say
[1:30:31] no it was all perfect
[1:30:32] when he said your brother will rise
[1:30:35] again
[1:30:39] huh
[1:30:41] and uh before that
[1:30:43] one thing that mary realized that she
[1:30:45] said that was good
[1:30:46] she says but i know that even now
[1:30:48] whatever you ask god in other words
[1:30:50] whatever you say
[1:30:52] i know it's going to happen
[1:30:57] that was what was going to be the
[1:30:58] important part is what jesus said
[1:31:04] this morning
[1:31:06] that's what's important is when jesus
[1:31:09] speaks
[1:31:14] amen he says you know that arise again
[1:31:18] and these then he says martha says you
[1:31:21] know we know that
[1:31:22] at the end time in the last day what
[1:31:24] basically put in our language we know
[1:31:27] that god will raise him up again
[1:31:32] right how many knows that's what's going
[1:31:34] to happen is god is going to raise it in
[1:31:37] yeah it's going to be god that's going
[1:31:38] to raise the debt
[1:31:40] we know that and then he makes a point
[1:31:42] and i like this because it brings our
[1:31:45] title in our subject this morning when
[1:31:47] he said
[1:31:48] i am
[1:31:49] the resurrection
[1:31:52] i am the resurrection and
[1:31:55] what else
[1:31:56] the life he's not just a resurrection
[1:31:59] but he's also the life that he
[1:32:01] resurrects
[1:32:05] now the importance of having the holy
[1:32:07] ghost how many knows it's important
[1:32:09] brother bam says if you go if you die
[1:32:11] without the holy ghost there's nothing
[1:32:13] there to quicken for god to quicken
[1:32:15] you have got to die with the holy ghost
[1:32:18] all right
[1:32:20] and even uh saint john's there he says
[1:32:22] he that hath the son hath life
[1:32:25] and he that hath not the son has what
[1:32:28] not life
[1:32:31] so he is the life the holy ghost is the
[1:32:33] life
[1:32:34] amen he is the resurrection and the life
[1:32:44] now
[1:32:45] maybe pick the thought up now i'll let
[1:32:47] me let me finish this first one first
[1:32:49] let's talk about
[1:32:50] the importance of his word
[1:32:53] then we'll talk about
[1:32:54] the other part
[1:32:59] about him being the resurrection
[1:33:01] number one
[1:33:02] when god speaks number two
[1:33:06] is
[1:33:06] that he is the resurrection and the life
[1:33:10] brother brahm in one of his sermons says
[1:33:12] it this way
[1:33:14] now if i told you say lady you're sick
[1:33:17] i'll lay my hands on you and you'll
[1:33:19] you'd get well
[1:33:20] that's all right but i could guess that
[1:33:24] and that's basically the what any
[1:33:26] minister believes without a
[1:33:29] vision or a thus saith the lord
[1:33:32] and
[1:33:33] billy graham or roberts a lot of times
[1:33:35] when they pray for people in the name of
[1:33:37] jesus christ you are healed
[1:33:40] amen they have a right to say that
[1:33:43] because how many knows by his stripes
[1:33:45] they are healed
[1:33:47] and then it it's upon their faith and
[1:33:49] upon the person being prayed for is
[1:33:51] faith of whether they are or not we know
[1:33:53] in brother ministry he would have those
[1:33:55] prayer lines there would be a lot of
[1:33:57] them that go through accept your healing
[1:33:59] receive your healing notice a lot of
[1:34:01] people didn't get their healing
[1:34:03] because they didn't have the right faith
[1:34:06] but that was different
[1:34:08] than when brother branham would see a
[1:34:09] vision
[1:34:11] or if he would say thus saith the lord
[1:34:14] that was absolute there was no changing
[1:34:16] that that was going to be
[1:34:18] let me know that that was a word from
[1:34:21] god
[1:34:22] amen the other is faith just like you
[1:34:24] know if y'all can't believe all things
[1:34:26] are possible that's what you got to do
[1:34:28] believe all things are
[1:34:30] possible amen
[1:34:34] so
[1:34:35] he says it this way i could guess that
[1:34:37] but if he will go back and tell you
[1:34:39] something all right if he'll come and
[1:34:41] say something and you know whether
[1:34:43] that's the truth or not maybe he'll show
[1:34:46] your fault like he did with the woman at
[1:34:48] the well
[1:34:49] if he will know what you are
[1:34:51] what you're here for just like he did
[1:34:53] with the woman that will you believe him
[1:34:54] with all of your heart
[1:34:56] amen i mean no that's why a lot of times
[1:34:58] discernment tell them where they come
[1:35:00] from what their name was
[1:35:02] yes yes yeah they would explode their
[1:35:04] faith and take out it out out and they
[1:35:06] received their healing it would help
[1:35:08] their to know that hey that's not just
[1:35:11] brother branham that's jesus christ here
[1:35:13] discerning the thoughts and tense of
[1:35:14] heart like they would do the word that's
[1:35:16] christ
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:19] okay
[1:35:21] now here's the bible scene perfectly
[1:35:24] here's a woman that i've never seen in
[1:35:25] my life never spoke to her as i know of
[1:35:28] she might have been here in meeting
[1:35:29] somewhere
[1:35:30] have you ever been in one of the
[1:35:31] meetings before have you ever been in
[1:35:32] the meetings but i don't know i don't
[1:35:35] know you if that's right raise your hand
[1:35:37] so that people will see
[1:35:38] now
[1:35:39] and better man said that a lot of times
[1:35:41] at the end of his sermons and after his
[1:35:42] preaching he would say now
[1:35:44] one word from him
[1:35:47] will mean more than i can say in a
[1:35:50] million lifetimes
[1:35:53] and he said that many places let me just
[1:35:56] read you another one another one he says
[1:35:58] one time one time him speaking mean more
[1:36:02] than anyone could say in a lifetime just
[1:36:05] one word from
[1:36:08] him all the preaching's good it's
[1:36:11] probably no doubt the gospel and so
[1:36:12] forth but when he comes and seems your
[1:36:14] name is so and so
[1:36:17] huh
[1:36:17] you are afflicted with this
[1:36:21] go and believe and you have what you
[1:36:23] have what you have need of so when the
[1:36:25] holy spirit would begin to discern right
[1:36:28] brother said that is means more than all
[1:36:31] the preaching in the world
[1:36:33] because anybody can say anything but
[1:36:35] when christ comes when he speaks
[1:36:37] look out
[1:36:40] how many knows that's the difference in
[1:36:42] your life that's the difference in my
[1:36:44] life that's the difference in young
[1:36:45] people's lives maybe mama maybe daddy
[1:36:48] speaks and you believe what they say but
[1:36:50] when the holy spirit tells you that by
[1:36:52] stripes i am healed and what he died on
[1:36:54] calvary he did it for me it becomes
[1:36:57] personal it changes you forever
[1:37:00] when he says it to you
[1:37:04] i don't care if it's healing i don't
[1:37:05] care if it's salvation i don't care what
[1:37:07] it is you want that word from the lord
[1:37:10] saying god that's yours that's mine
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] changes everything
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:19] changes everything
[1:37:20] when he says something
[1:37:22] now how many knows
[1:37:24] he's already said
[1:37:26] every let every red letter in there see
[1:37:29] that red letter called the red letter
[1:37:31] that when jesus spoke they'd put it in
[1:37:34] red
[1:37:37] you take that as just saith the lord
[1:37:39] every last word that he says is just
[1:37:42] saith the lord
[1:37:43] if you could take the scripture of saint
[1:37:45] john
[1:37:46] 3 16 for god to love the world that he
[1:37:48] gave his only begotten son that
[1:37:50] whosoever believes
[1:37:52] he within him shall not perish but live
[1:37:55] forever if you can take that in your
[1:37:57] heart god quickens that to you
[1:37:59] you'll have eternal life how many
[1:38:02] believes it that's his word when you
[1:38:04] accept what he said
[1:38:06] amen it makes all the difference
[1:38:10] and that's the kind of faith that we got
[1:38:11] to have
[1:38:12] to believe
[1:38:14] what he
[1:38:15] said
[1:38:19] there's another scripture
[1:38:22] about that i want to bring into thought
[1:38:24] here before we go to the next thought
[1:38:25] that's in matthew 8 and verse 5.
[1:38:28] and when jesus was entered into
[1:38:30] capernaum there came unto him a
[1:38:32] centurion
[1:38:34] beseeching him and saying lord
[1:38:36] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[1:38:38] palsy grievously tormented and jesus
[1:38:41] said unto him i will come and heal him
[1:38:48] wow
[1:38:49] i mean that's the word of the lord
[1:38:52] i will come and i'll heal him that's
[1:38:54] what jesus said you know that's what he
[1:38:56] was willing to do
[1:38:58] all right
[1:39:00] now i'm going to tell you something
[1:39:02] there's something about it when jesus
[1:39:04] says stuff it's all significant why did
[1:39:05] he all of a sudden say i will come to
[1:39:07] your house i will come to you and heal
[1:39:09] him
[1:39:11] he don't just normally say that but he
[1:39:13] did that to the centurion
[1:39:16] and forgive me for being presumptuous
[1:39:19] but i believe there was just something
[1:39:20] about it that he knew
[1:39:23] it was something that he was
[1:39:24] creating a scenario he was putting into
[1:39:27] effect that would be an example for you
[1:39:29] and i
[1:39:30] because the centurion answered and said
[1:39:34] no lord he said lord i am not worthy
[1:39:36] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:39:40] now most of us would say yeah yeah come
[1:39:42] on to my house but this centurion had
[1:39:45] such
[1:39:46] respect such mad respect until he says
[1:39:49] i'm not worthy that you come under my
[1:39:51] roof
[1:39:54] huh
[1:39:55] i'm not even worthy that you would come
[1:39:57] under my roof but this one thing i know
[1:39:59] but speak the word only
[1:40:03] and my servant
[1:40:05] shall be
[1:40:06] healed huh
[1:40:09] it's quite a scenario
[1:40:12] for i am a man under authority having
[1:40:14] soldiers under me and i say that this
[1:40:16] man go and he goethe and another come
[1:40:18] and he cometh and to my servant do this
[1:40:21] and he do with it
[1:40:27] when jesus heard it he marveled
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:33] glory
[1:40:34] this is what was coming up
[1:40:36] he knew this man had faith
[1:40:39] didn't he
[1:40:41] i i don't know about you but
[1:40:43] it has to be some kind of faith for god
[1:40:45] himself to marvel
[1:40:50] you know to me it would be like somebody
[1:40:52] saying wow
[1:40:56] wow
[1:41:00] wow
[1:41:02] you don't get to say get to tell god wow
[1:41:05] get him to say wow very often
[1:41:08] i'm sure david did i'm certainly three
[1:41:09] hebrew children today i'm sure daniel
[1:41:11] got this got to say god god to say wow
[1:41:15] that's what i'm saying
[1:41:17] that's what i like
[1:41:19] they don't care if they live or they
[1:41:21] don't care if they die that's not the
[1:41:23] issue they're going to trust me anyway
[1:41:24] whether to live or die
[1:41:26] they are the lords
[1:41:29] amen
[1:41:30] this man
[1:41:32] he says you know all these things jesus
[1:41:34] marveled and said unto them that
[1:41:36] followed he turned around said verily i
[1:41:39] say unto you i have not found
[1:41:43] so great of faith no not in israel
[1:41:50] that a person could just what god said
[1:41:52] said i believe it
[1:41:55] i'm just looking for you to say the word
[1:41:59] and i know it's going to happen
[1:42:02] huh
[1:42:04] now i got to finish this story is that
[1:42:06] all right
[1:42:09] let me see i've got another one
[1:42:14] and i say unto you that many shall come
[1:42:15] from the east and the west and shall sit
[1:42:17] down with abraham and isaac and jacob in
[1:42:19] the kingdom of god but the children of
[1:42:21] the kingdom shall be cast into outer
[1:42:23] darkness there shall be weeping and
[1:42:25] gnashing of teeth
[1:42:27] now i just have to presume here
[1:42:30] but he says the children of the kingdom
[1:42:32] how many knows he came to his own
[1:42:34] and his own received him not
[1:42:37] those israelites those pharisees they'll
[1:42:39] be cast into honor
[1:42:40] they're the ones that should have had
[1:42:42] faith like this
[1:42:44] but they didn't did they
[1:42:46] he could tell them the truth and they
[1:42:47] would absolutely uh you know call him
[1:42:49] deals in return
[1:42:52] you know
[1:42:54] he says this and jesus said unto the
[1:42:56] centurion go thy away
[1:42:59] and as thou has believed so be it done
[1:43:04] unto thee
[1:43:05] i mean at least that's how it is for us
[1:43:07] this morning as you believe that word is
[1:43:11] how it's going to be to you
[1:43:14] according as you believe that's how you
[1:43:16] receive it
[1:43:23] he didn't put it any other way he didn't
[1:43:25] say your servant as well go see him no
[1:43:28] he said as you have believed
[1:43:31] so let it be
[1:43:33] and he genuinely believed because he
[1:43:35] would have never most of us would have
[1:43:37] invited him on our house come pray lay
[1:43:39] your hands on him
[1:43:40] but this centurion knew what it was like
[1:43:42] to speak a word
[1:43:43] hey go do this hey go do that
[1:43:46] and they do it
[1:43:48] he knew if jesus was god where he was at
[1:43:50] that type of authority all he had to do
[1:43:52] is speak the word
[1:43:56] amen i don't know about you but i love
[1:43:58] it when jesus talks to my heart how many
[1:44:00] knows it's so
[1:44:01] wonderful when jesus says something to
[1:44:03] your heart and you follow it and you do
[1:44:05] it
[1:44:06] but we all know the calamity that
[1:44:08] follows when we god tells us to do
[1:44:10] something and we don't
[1:44:12] we regret it
[1:44:15] how many believe let me tell you young
[1:44:17] people everybody in here listen you
[1:44:19] listen to that still small voice it
[1:44:22] won't mislead you and if you don't
[1:44:23] you'll wish you would have so why not do
[1:44:25] it anyway
[1:44:27] this is the only time you should have to
[1:44:29] hear this when you hear that voice
[1:44:30] listen to it or you'll regret it why
[1:44:32] would you want to regret it
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] when you hear that voice and you know
[1:44:39] it's god speaking you better do it
[1:44:42] amen you know that voice and if you
[1:44:44] don't know that voice it's important
[1:44:45] that you learn that voice amen
[1:44:49] praise the lord you love him
[1:44:51] so it's important to have him speak
[1:44:53] because when he speaks
[1:44:56] amen it's going to happen
[1:44:58] praise the lord
[1:45:00] another thing i got from this
[1:45:03] was this
[1:45:04] when he said i am the resurrection and
[1:45:07] the life now how many knows that he said
[1:45:10] many places i am the root and offspring
[1:45:12] of david i am the pride and mourning i
[1:45:14] am i am i am i am the i am
[1:45:18] but isn't it every
[1:45:21] day
[1:45:22] but he talks about how that you know
[1:45:24] when you go to the ocean and when you
[1:45:26] take a spoonful of water out of there a
[1:45:27] little cup of water you take a little
[1:45:29] cup of water there
[1:45:31] right
[1:45:32] and
[1:45:33] and you go well what have i got well you
[1:45:35] may not have much but you've got
[1:45:37] everything that that water has
[1:45:41] every germ every
[1:45:43] vitamin whatever all the salt no matter
[1:45:45] what it is everything is in that little
[1:45:47] cup
[1:45:48] how many knows that when christ comes
[1:45:50] into your heart
[1:45:52] everything that god is is in you
[1:46:00] it don't defuse us enough
[1:46:02] to realize that when you get the baptism
[1:46:04] of the holy ghost amen all that christ
[1:46:07] was god was he poured into christ and
[1:46:09] all that christ was he poured into his
[1:46:12] church
[1:46:14] everything that god is you are
[1:46:21] man
[1:46:25] i'm sure we could sit here for hours
[1:46:28] and try to absorb that
[1:46:32] try to absorb that
[1:46:34] can i
[1:46:36] just just go with one more thing
[1:46:40] you think god is
[1:46:41] disturbed
[1:46:43] do you think he's nervous
[1:46:46] do you think he's a wreck
[1:46:49] or
[1:46:50] is he at peace
[1:46:53] huh can you imagine the peace of god
[1:46:56] how many knows when you've got the holy
[1:46:58] ghost the peace of god
[1:47:00] is not up there anymore it's right here
[1:47:01] you know
[1:47:02] what it's like
[1:47:04] you have the peace of god let the peace
[1:47:07] of god rule in your hearts the scripture
[1:47:10] said
[1:47:15] how many enjoys it how many gods have
[1:47:17] the peace of god
[1:47:18] knowing hey our time here is short we
[1:47:21] won't be here long but you ain't got to
[1:47:22] be worried about nothing
[1:47:24] he's taking care of it
[1:47:26] he that liveth and believeth on me shall
[1:47:27] never die
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:32] no
[1:47:32] never die
[1:47:35] when i got to thinking about all the
[1:47:36] saints of all the ages
[1:47:39] i mean let me tell you something
[1:47:41] all the saints of all the ages and their
[1:47:43] hope was
[1:47:44] the resurrection
[1:47:47] their hope is that resurrection that's
[1:47:50] what we all serve god for we love him we
[1:47:52] serve him because we love him and
[1:47:53] because we have a goal
[1:47:57] i mean it's got to go
[1:47:59] abraham had a goal what was it the land
[1:48:01] of gurire and all of this other and all
[1:48:03] these land from no he said he was
[1:48:05] seeking new city whose builder and maker
[1:48:08] was god
[1:48:09] abraham had a goal every child of
[1:48:11] abraham has a goal
[1:48:13] and you show me what your goal is i'll
[1:48:16] tell you where your heart is and i'll
[1:48:18] tell you where your heart is is where
[1:48:19] your treasure is
[1:48:22] what is your goal and i'll tell you what
[1:48:23] your treasure is
[1:48:26] how many believes that
[1:48:28] and the christian's goal is not this
[1:48:31] world
[1:48:33] amen
[1:48:34] i said i was thanking god for helping me
[1:48:37] to achieve the american dream
[1:48:41] by god's grace i have achieved the
[1:48:43] american dream
[1:48:47] but that's by the grace of god that's
[1:48:49] good to have that's just an extra
[1:48:51] but am i satisfied with that no i
[1:48:54] realize it's all going to go by the
[1:48:55] wayside
[1:48:57] hey my children never never inherit my
[1:49:00] farmer
[1:49:02] mr mr president will try to take it
[1:49:05] first
[1:49:06] you're going to want to look in your
[1:49:08] bank account take your money already
[1:49:09] aren't they
[1:49:11] no private property and all this kind of
[1:49:13] you don't know what's going to happen
[1:49:14] next you better not have too much of a
[1:49:16] grip on here
[1:49:20] the peace of god
[1:49:21] everything that god is
[1:49:24] is in you
[1:49:26] all right
[1:49:28] can we all say lord work on me
[1:49:31] lord work on me the love of god let's
[1:49:33] talk about the love of god for a minute
[1:49:35] hey i look i don't like it
[1:49:37] i almost sit and preach
[1:49:40] didn't this bible say he sat down or
[1:49:42] something and talked to people he sat
[1:49:44] down and talked to people
[1:49:49] we'll just tear right up here and i
[1:49:50] teach the people
[1:49:54] huh he said on the rock
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:01] well praise be to god
[1:50:05] we've been blessed abundantly i guess
[1:50:07] right
[1:50:08] i'm gonna bring a rock for me and i'm
[1:50:10] bringing you a rock too brother
[1:50:15] oh my you got me there brother glenn
[1:50:19] think about the love of god
[1:50:22] how about the love of god
[1:50:25] you know we can love those that love us
[1:50:29] but listen if you have to fight hard to
[1:50:31] love those that hate you
[1:50:33] you still got a problem
[1:50:36] you don't have to fight hard so much of
[1:50:38] the love of god you'll go and when
[1:50:40] nobody knows you'll be praying for those
[1:50:41] that hate you
[1:50:45] so much of the love of god that you have
[1:50:47] now because that portion is in you god
[1:50:50] is in you
[1:50:52] all that god was didn't we hear it so
[1:50:54] much don't we
[1:50:55] that all god was or how is it we become
[1:50:59] the very righteousness of god
[1:51:01] however right god is is how right you
[1:51:04] are
[1:51:07] then the church age book teaches that
[1:51:09] that we've become the very righteousness
[1:51:11] of god
[1:51:13] we have the justification just to be
[1:51:15] justified and that's as though you've
[1:51:18] never done it in the first place
[1:51:20] all your sins are gone
[1:51:25] brother tommy
[1:51:27] all of us who are sinners and we're rank
[1:51:29] sinners some of us are rank sinners
[1:51:32] uh think about it doesn't the devil try
[1:51:35] to come back in your mind and put that
[1:51:37] back on you well you know this that or
[1:51:39] the other
[1:51:40] don't let him do that
[1:51:42] if you know that god has sealed you with
[1:51:44] the holy ghost don't let them thoughts
[1:51:46] come in they got no right to come in
[1:51:49] they got no right to bother you why
[1:51:51] because that's in the sea of god's
[1:51:53] forgetfulness now and you ain't got to
[1:51:55] remember it either the devil just tries
[1:51:57] to bring that up to you
[1:52:00] that's what the resurrection i am the
[1:52:02] resurrection i am your joy i am your
[1:52:06] peace i am your love
[1:52:09] i am your power
[1:52:11] i am your strength
[1:52:15] oh my brother glenn as i get older i get
[1:52:18] weaker
[1:52:19] and i find need i find i need more of
[1:52:21] the holy ghost
[1:52:22] because that holy ghost will make you
[1:52:24] stronger it will actually give you
[1:52:25] strength
[1:52:27] the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:52:32] sin against god one time sin against god
[1:52:35] living sin and find out how weak you get
[1:52:39] i don't want to go to work i feel
[1:52:41] terrible
[1:52:42] you're just weak
[1:52:45] huh
[1:52:49] but you get the holy ghost
[1:52:52] you have to be 90 year old preacher i
[1:52:54] can't bear to get up them but get up
[1:52:57] here and talk about that and then the
[1:52:58] son of god that thought about us before
[1:53:00] the foundation where was your job
[1:53:03] praise the lord i'll make you jump
[1:53:04] scream and shout
[1:53:06] give an old man enough energy to jump
[1:53:08] click his heels together
[1:53:12] huh
[1:53:15] go ahead try it
[1:53:16] it's all right
[1:53:19] why
[1:53:20] it's energized it's the power of god
[1:53:24] amen we're not going to get through this
[1:53:25] let me hurry let's go to paul i like
[1:53:28] paul
[1:53:34] all right
[1:53:36] let's look at how paul looked
[1:53:38] at the resurrection
[1:53:43] he said but those things which were
[1:53:44] gained to me
[1:53:46] those i counted lost for christ
[1:53:49] how many of those paul lost everything
[1:53:51] in this world
[1:53:53] for christ
[1:53:57] i kind of lost for
[1:53:58] christ yay doubtless
[1:54:02] in other words
[1:54:04] this whole world but just give me jesus
[1:54:07] just let me know him
[1:54:10] you can have all the world
[1:54:12] just give me jesus
[1:54:14] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:54:16] christ jesus my lord
[1:54:19] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:54:22] things
[1:54:24] i was to be the next
[1:54:26] k ephesus the next high priest people
[1:54:28] respected me when i come walking into
[1:54:30] the temple people stood at a alert they
[1:54:33] stepped to the side
[1:54:34] and watched as i walked
[1:54:37] because i was paul
[1:54:40] i was
[1:54:41] was it saul i guess he was saul before
[1:54:43] he was paul right
[1:54:45] that respect
[1:54:47] and then they got to turn on him after
[1:54:49] he come to christ
[1:54:50] all of his prestige all of his glory
[1:54:53] everything was gone
[1:54:55] suffered the loss of all things
[1:54:58] and i count them but dumb and we all
[1:55:01] know what that is
[1:55:03] right he counted all those things but
[1:55:05] dumb they're nothing to me they don't
[1:55:08] mean nothing
[1:55:11] why
[1:55:13] that i may
[1:55:15] win
[1:55:16] christ
[1:55:18] in other words you can have all of that
[1:55:22] if i can just win christ
[1:55:24] and be found in him
[1:55:26] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:55:29] in the law but that which is through
[1:55:31] faith in christ to righteousness which
[1:55:33] is of god by faith
[1:55:35] that i may know him
[1:55:38] notice
[1:55:39] and the power of his resurrection
[1:55:45] amen
[1:55:50] whatever it was
[1:55:52] whatever power
[1:55:54] brought jesus up from the grave
[1:55:59] paul wanted to know
[1:56:01] that power are you with me
[1:56:04] i want to know the power that raised
[1:56:06] christ from the dead
[1:56:08] he suffered the loss of all things he
[1:56:10] didn't care what it cost him he just
[1:56:12] wanted to know the power of the
[1:56:14] resurrection
[1:56:16] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:56:22] folks it used to be whenever they were
[1:56:24] persecuted and they were beat for the
[1:56:26] cause of christ they would go skipping
[1:56:28] down the street rejoicing because they
[1:56:31] were found worthy to suffer for the
[1:56:33] lord's cause
[1:56:35] now you let somebody call us a bad name
[1:56:37] and we want to punch him in the face
[1:56:42] that'll say well they're there
[1:56:46] right
[1:56:46] call them a bad name and everything no
[1:56:49] you ain't got the right spirit
[1:56:51] somebody calls you a bad name the bible
[1:56:53] says they'll call you all manner of evil
[1:56:54] they'll cast your name out as evil
[1:56:58] hallelujah
[1:56:59] i'm finding myself in the word suffering
[1:57:01] for the cause of christ
[1:57:02] paul didn't mind suffering for the cause
[1:57:04] of christ
[1:57:05] those 68 million christians didn't mind
[1:57:09] being thrown in with a bunch of lions
[1:57:11] rip me to treads but don't you take my
[1:57:13] price from me
[1:57:14] huh
[1:57:16] burn me at the stake but don't you take
[1:57:18] my christ from me
[1:57:21] so drive me through the sword
[1:57:23] don't take my christ from me it was more
[1:57:25] to them than anything
[1:57:27] listen they ought to see a people
[1:57:29] you got to be careful that this laodicea
[1:57:31] rich should increase with goods and need
[1:57:33] of nothing doesn't zap that out of you
[1:57:37] it can zap it out of you to where you
[1:57:39] love other things more than what you
[1:57:41] love god
[1:57:44] that's okay for the make-believer and
[1:57:45] the unbeliever they're going to do that
[1:57:47] because they don't love god the way but
[1:57:49] for the genuine believer
[1:57:51] he don't want to love anything else more
[1:57:52] than what he loves god
[1:57:56] being made conformable unto this death
[1:57:59] if by any means i might attain unto the
[1:58:02] resurrection of the dead
[1:58:05] that's what paul was looking for
[1:58:07] he said oh death where is your sting oh
[1:58:10] grave where is your victory but i thank
[1:58:12] god who gave us the victory through
[1:58:14] jesus christ our lord
[1:58:16] how many knows when christ died on
[1:58:18] calvary when that bee went into him and
[1:58:21] it stung him amen it stung so hard then
[1:58:24] it pulled the stinger out of that bee
[1:58:26] and now we can pet the bee we can play
[1:58:28] with the bee you can let the bee crawl
[1:58:30] all around it can hear us and be it but
[1:58:32] he can't never sting anymore because
[1:58:34] jesus took the sting out of death
[1:58:37] so much so that the paul said i'm lord
[1:58:39] willing to lay my head down and let it
[1:58:41] chop it off no problem
[1:58:45] huh
[1:58:46] i'm more willing to go to jerusalem and
[1:58:48] die for the christ
[1:58:50] huh
[1:58:51] evap bosworth oh man brother brown came
[1:58:53] to and he says brother bother do you
[1:58:55] realize you're dying what was the best
[1:58:57] time of your life when you was having
[1:58:58] meetings when you
[1:59:00] seen people heal and everything like
[1:59:02] that and that bible says no brother this
[1:59:04] is the best time of my life
[1:59:08] when he was dying
[1:59:11] took the stinger out of death
[1:59:14] you don't have to be afraid of death
[1:59:16] we all want to be at the place to where
[1:59:18] we want to be to where we come down to
[1:59:19] the door of death you don't have to be
[1:59:21] afraid of
[1:59:22] that's my heart's desire if i ever go
[1:59:24] after my last breath
[1:59:26] huh
[1:59:27] you get in a car wreck and you're
[1:59:29] pinched in there your blood is flowing
[1:59:31] out of you or your grips or ribs are
[1:59:33] crushing the inside is flowing filling
[1:59:35] up and you're taking shorter breaths
[1:59:37] every time because those lungs are
[1:59:39] filling up well praise be to god just
[1:59:41] like my mother-in-law said when she was
[1:59:42] having a heart attack how did you help
[1:59:44] me help me
[1:59:45] help me
[1:59:47] then she says i'm going to be with the
[1:59:49] lord i'm going to be with the lord i'm
[1:59:51] going to be with the lord
[1:59:53] sure fear wants a grip but
[1:59:54] where's your anchor
[1:59:56] you realize she was going with me with
[1:59:57] the lord
[1:59:59] he had that hope even in death
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:04] that's where thomas followed he wants i
[2:00:06] want to be at the place and so full of
[2:00:07] that resurrection power that you know
[2:00:10] that whenever you go to that other side
[2:00:12] you're not going to no grave
[2:00:15] don't you believe that ivan is down in
[2:00:16] that hole amen that's just the body
[2:00:19] our loved ones they're just that's just
[2:00:21] their body their soul is over on the
[2:00:23] other side
[2:00:26] in a wonderful place
[2:00:28] and for six thousand years folks
[2:00:31] people have been waiting
[2:00:33] for that grand
[2:00:36] day
[2:00:37] called
[2:00:38] resurrection day
[2:00:44] amen
[2:00:46] that's why jesus
[2:00:48] he says i am
[2:00:50] the resurrection
[2:00:54] there was a quote that brother bannon
[2:00:56] made
[2:00:58] and i just
[2:01:00] yesterday
[2:01:02] got the revelation of tying that in with
[2:01:04] this here
[2:01:07] because he makes a statement
[2:01:09] he says
[2:01:11] that when you're planted in christ
[2:01:13] hallelujah the holy ghost baptism yes
[2:01:16] sir
[2:01:16] everything you have need of for this
[2:01:19] life's journey
[2:01:20] even the rapture
[2:01:22] is in you
[2:01:23] then
[2:01:26] then he says don't resent that because
[2:01:28] brother ben could pick up when people
[2:01:30] resented that
[2:01:32] the rapture is in you when you get the
[2:01:35] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:01:38] don't resent that that's the truth
[2:01:40] the rapture is in us now i will prove it
[2:01:44] by the gospel now brother babylon in
[2:01:46] this scripture says those whom he has
[2:01:47] justified justified he has borified
[2:01:50] hallelujah
[2:01:51] then in heaven we're glorified but i
[2:01:54] take it to this scripture
[2:01:56] huh
[2:01:58] right you can bring it right back to
[2:02:00] here
[2:02:01] where he says the rapture how many knows
[2:02:04] that the rapture is part of the
[2:02:05] resurrection the dead in christ arise
[2:02:08] first and we which are alive and remain
[2:02:11] shall be caught up together with them
[2:02:13] all a part of that resurrection and
[2:02:15] jesus said i am your rapture i am your
[2:02:19] resurrection and where is jesus go ahead
[2:02:23] in me
[2:02:25] if jesus in you the resurrection is in
[2:02:28] you the rapture is in you
[2:02:32] hey amen
[2:02:35] it's in you then
[2:02:37] it was a little hard for people to
[2:02:38] swallow back then but everything the
[2:02:40] prophet said we all know has to line up
[2:02:41] with the word
[2:02:43] now i love it when i see that it's
[2:02:44] according to the word
[2:02:46] amen praise the lord
[2:02:49] oh my so paul
[2:02:52] he didn't care
[2:02:54] what happened
[2:02:57] lazarus so what jesus said
[2:03:00] i am the resurrection and the life
[2:03:03] and he went over there and preached to
[2:03:05] him a little bit more and he went and
[2:03:06] cried out the lazarus lazarus
[2:03:09] come forth
[2:03:12] and what happened
[2:03:14] here comes what looked like a mummy
[2:03:17] right
[2:03:18] it said that his face was wrapped
[2:03:23] folks he didn't have to worry hurry up
[2:03:24] and get it off his nose so he can
[2:03:26] breathe
[2:03:28] there he come walking them he didn't
[2:03:30] have to breathe yet
[2:03:32] not until he gets it all off of there
[2:03:34] they begin
[2:03:38] we have a do you believe they brought a
[2:03:39] dead man here
[2:03:41] in a casket
[2:03:43] huh
[2:03:45] somebody would be inspired say rise
[2:03:48] call the name
[2:03:51] and i like what the public god said he
[2:03:52] said you know it's a good thing he said
[2:03:55] rise lazarus lazarus rise up
[2:03:57] he called the name otherwise
[2:04:00] everybody would have come
[2:04:02] now how many please there's going to be
[2:04:04] a now let me say this there is a
[2:04:06] resurrection for every
[2:04:08] soul every soul gets a resurrection but
[2:04:12] i won't take the time into it but
[2:04:13] revelations i believe it is in the
[2:04:15] around the 20th chapter talked about the
[2:04:17] first resurrection and those that were
[2:04:19] beheaded for the witness of christ lived
[2:04:20] and reigned for christ for a thousand
[2:04:22] years this is the first resurrection and
[2:04:24] they lived and rained for a thousand
[2:04:26] years and then the devil is loosed for a
[2:04:28] little while upon the earth amen and
[2:04:30] there's gog and mayhawk there's a battle
[2:04:32] and then after that notice it says that
[2:04:34] the dead
[2:04:35] that were in the sea and under the sea
[2:04:37] death and hell gave up the dead they
[2:04:39] were in there all brought up
[2:04:42] we know that if you sin in the body that
[2:04:44] body will be raised back up
[2:04:48] and this something else i want to just
[2:04:50] point out here
[2:04:51] that is when you think about the power
[2:04:53] of god
[2:04:54] and the awesomeness of what those people
[2:04:56] saw when they saw that dead man walking
[2:04:58] again and he could speak to a man whose
[2:05:00] nose perhaps had already caved in
[2:05:04] and it come popping back out
[2:05:06] he fell back out
[2:05:08] they unwrapped him
[2:05:12] there should have been a jubilee
[2:05:14] huh there should have been a falling
[2:05:16] down and worshipping jesus
[2:05:18] this man has power to call people out of
[2:05:21] the grave
[2:05:30] it isn't hard for god to heal you
[2:05:33] guys it's easy for him to heal you
[2:05:36] it's nothing for him to heal you
[2:05:38] if he can bring a dead man back
[2:05:41] but how many knows
[2:05:43] there was something even harder that god
[2:05:45] did over remember the old testament he
[2:05:48] said to the prophet he says can these
[2:05:49] bones live
[2:05:51] a whole army a whole valley full of
[2:05:53] bones
[2:05:54] just dried up
[2:05:57] clacking against each other perhaps when
[2:05:58] you throw them around or whatever
[2:06:01] but what he speak he said speak and the
[2:06:04] bones
[2:06:05] you talk about a
[2:06:07] you talk about something to watch
[2:06:09] can you imagine those bones came
[2:06:11] together and they had a skeleton you had
[2:06:13] a weird-looking eye you know and just
[2:06:16] bones everywhere fingers
[2:06:18] just all of them come back together
[2:06:21] and then they watch you go from the
[2:06:22] bones to sinews your flesh again the
[2:06:26] flesh becomes come back on them you know
[2:06:29] all the muscles and the arteries of the
[2:06:30] heart
[2:06:32] come back on and just a red blob of
[2:06:35] flesh
[2:06:36] wicked looking skinless and the skin
[2:06:39] came back on and it didn't look so bad
[2:06:43] and they called it back not only called
[2:06:46] all that army back but told them to
[2:06:48] breathe
[2:06:50] amen they came back to life
[2:06:52] that ain't nothing too hard for god
[2:06:55] how many knows in the resurrection but
[2:06:57] the bible says in those lions
[2:06:59] then
[2:07:01] how far your atoms and their molecules
[2:07:03] are scattered and then god will call and
[2:07:05] they will answer
[2:07:09] that's what paul's looking for that's
[2:07:11] what you're looking for
[2:07:13] the greatest treasure
[2:07:15] in this world
[2:07:17] eternal life
[2:07:19] that right
[2:07:21] eternal
[2:07:22] life
[2:07:23] they're my whole
[2:07:26] shall be
[2:07:27] eternal amen i'm he's looking for an
[2:07:30] eternal home
[2:07:35] i'm going to speak as i feel the holy
[2:07:37] spirit to speak and that is that a lot
[2:07:39] of us all of us
[2:07:41] we have got to get a grip on what is the
[2:07:44] real ambition
[2:07:46] you have got to get a grip on what your
[2:07:48] goal is
[2:07:50] you don't you let the cares of this
[2:07:52] world the the the deceitfulness of
[2:07:55] riches
[2:07:57] to choke out the holy ghost and the life
[2:07:59] of god in you
[2:08:01] amen
[2:08:03] that's our bible
[2:08:05] it's leodacya rich increased with goods
[2:08:08] have neither nothing don't realize we
[2:08:10] ain't even got a hallelujah anymore we
[2:08:12] ain't got to praise the lord we ain't
[2:08:13] got to shout we ain't got to scream
[2:08:15] we ain't got enough of god we ain't got
[2:08:17] enough of that quickly powering us
[2:08:20] we need the power of the rather outward
[2:08:22] and all the power and the resurrection
[2:08:26] in a greater way
[2:08:29] than he is action you ain't got to worry
[2:08:31] about the resurrection just worry about
[2:08:33] making sure you're getting christ
[2:08:37] oh my
[2:08:39] we've heard this so many times i think i
[2:08:41] should read it again
[2:08:42] i think i'll read it again and see how
[2:08:44] high i can fly
[2:08:46] and then i like that song
[2:08:49] that's the way it is for the christian
[2:08:50] we are planted together in christ jesus
[2:08:52] who's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[2:08:55] we're planted in christ and we just
[2:08:57] drink and drink and drink and push out
[2:08:59] and everything that we have need of in
[2:09:01] his life's journey divine healing the
[2:09:03] power of god and all these things
[2:09:06] is in every individual in here that's
[2:09:09] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:09:15] amen every person that's received the
[2:09:18] baptism of the holy ghost everything you
[2:09:20] have need of
[2:09:24] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:30] it's according to your belief
[2:09:34] remember your last sunday i said brother
[2:09:36] branham didn't care if he lived or died
[2:09:37] didn't matter i'm believing god's word
[2:09:40] now i'm eating this food
[2:09:42] mama crying across the table don't do it
[2:09:45] don't do it billy i love you i want you
[2:09:47] around
[2:09:49] but he had suffered with it so much
[2:09:50] until he was tired of suffering with him
[2:09:52] he was going to take god at his word
[2:09:54] he didn't have a prophet coming over him
[2:09:55] praying over him and saying hey you you
[2:09:57] know in the name of the lord no he just
[2:09:58] took god at his word
[2:10:00] and he got healed
[2:10:02] that's what we got to do just take god
[2:10:04] at his word
[2:10:05] stand there and start acting noisy
[2:10:07] already and i like this part i believe
[2:10:09] that you got to start acting like it's
[2:10:11] already done
[2:10:15] too many people say i am healed and then
[2:10:17] they won't act like it
[2:10:20] they been waiting for some magic wand to
[2:10:22] come over and make him feel all
[2:10:24] different that's not faith
[2:10:26] sure god can do that but listen he wants
[2:10:28] to see action upon you
[2:10:32] huh
[2:10:34] my arm wants to give me trouble
[2:10:37] my muscles in my arm that that what i
[2:10:39] pulled that muscle wants to still give
[2:10:40] me trouble
[2:10:42] guess what i don't care i believe i'm
[2:10:44] healed
[2:10:46] i can do it you work it better than
[2:10:48] i could before
[2:10:50] work a little more folks i'll grab on
[2:10:52] weights and if it hurts let it hurt i
[2:10:54] believe i'm healed
[2:10:57] it's not going to get worse it's getting
[2:10:58] better and it's getting better
[2:11:01] you know how many aches and pains i've
[2:11:02] been healed of by taking that attitude i
[2:11:04] can't even begin to tell you
[2:11:08] come on hold folks this should be good
[2:11:09] folks
[2:11:14] lord help me i could never believe i'd
[2:11:16] fit in that category i thought i'd
[2:11:17] always be young but know when you're 60
[2:11:19] you old you're the old category right
[2:11:21] there now
[2:11:25] oh my
[2:11:27] and i thank god for his grace
[2:11:30] can i read one more quote to you
[2:11:32] and we'll close
[2:11:34] brother brandon preached another
[2:11:35] mother's day message and he talked about
[2:11:37] the family and he talked about the
[2:11:38] resurrection
[2:11:42] someone said you preached too much on
[2:11:44] the resurrection
[2:11:46] most every message has got something
[2:11:48] about the resurrection why sure it's the
[2:11:51] cardinal resting place of the gospel
[2:11:54] i mean it's a cardinal hope
[2:11:57] is that when we die we're gonna come
[2:11:59] back again we're gonna be resurrected
[2:12:02] amen
[2:12:04] no matter what he did talking about
[2:12:06] christ no matter what he said if he
[2:12:07] didn't rise again it wouldn't mean the
[2:12:09] thing
[2:12:10] i mean no matter what we believe or
[2:12:12] how you live if you don't come up again
[2:12:14] it ain't gonna mean a thing
[2:12:17] now notice
[2:12:22] he says and i think it's the great
[2:12:24] coronation of the full gospel is the
[2:12:26] resurrection
[2:12:27] it's divine promises and the consolation
[2:12:30] that it gives those who are trusting in
[2:12:32] it
[2:12:33] for it promises the great union of our
[2:12:36] uniting together again
[2:12:38] the fading away of all sin it promises
[2:12:41] the fading away of all deformity
[2:12:44] all the sufferings
[2:12:46] that we have did than this had to go
[2:12:48] through with this in this life it
[2:12:50] promises then the vanishing
[2:12:54] promises then the vanishing of us all it
[2:12:56] promises us
[2:12:57] that that even death will lose its hold
[2:13:01] amen and we'll rise in the likeness of
[2:13:03] christ remember one place says if ye
[2:13:05] then be risen with christ seek those
[2:13:07] things which are from above
[2:13:09] and not from below
[2:13:12] so notice that we will rise in the
[2:13:15] likeness of jesus so to my opinion
[2:13:18] the resurrection is the greatest of all
[2:13:21] the promises
[2:13:23] in the things of the scripture
[2:13:25] that's where it is sealed
[2:13:27] that's the day for me that great day of
[2:13:30] days
[2:13:31] and to see what it'll mean to all of us
[2:13:33] in the resurrection
[2:13:35] as we labor and wait for that blessed
[2:13:38] day of days
[2:13:41] it gives us the promise that someday
[2:13:43] that these old wrinkly
[2:13:45] feeble grey-headed broke-down mothers
[2:13:48] will be changed
[2:13:51] amen
[2:13:52] we could just sit here right now and we
[2:13:54] can think about meeting
[2:13:57] brother paul
[2:13:58] brother peter
[2:13:59] john all the saints
[2:14:02] how many of us we're going to be
[2:14:03] gathered together in the air
[2:14:07] all the saints will be gathered together
[2:14:09] according to the scripture to meet him
[2:14:11] in the air
[2:14:14] in other words paul's group isn't going
[2:14:15] to go meet him before we do
[2:14:18] we're going to be all together and then
[2:14:20] we'll get to see him
[2:14:22] that's how the resurrection is going to
[2:14:23] be
[2:14:26] all right broke down mothers will be
[2:14:28] changed not only will mother sit there
[2:14:30] by her sitting there by herself no but
[2:14:32] all of her family with her
[2:14:36] what a day that will be what a time it
[2:14:38] will be
[2:14:39] when i look upon the faces of those who
[2:14:41] have love we have loved so well
[2:14:44] what a difference on that morning
[2:14:46] that's another song
[2:14:48] that came to my mind as i was sitting
[2:14:50] there
[2:14:52] a golden morning is fast approaching
[2:14:55] when jesus will come
[2:14:57] and take us home
[2:14:58] we're looking for a golden morning
[2:15:02] that's that resurrection morning
[2:15:05] great morning
[2:15:08] i stopped so quick with peter paul
[2:15:10] irenaeus martin
[2:15:12] wesley all the saints of our age
[2:15:16] the prophet of god
[2:15:18] paul peter all of them
[2:15:21] think about it
[2:15:23] moses
[2:15:24] how many people see moses
[2:15:26] how many of these will see abel
[2:15:29] samson
[2:15:30] all the saints will get to meet him
[2:15:34] let that be a reality in your heart
[2:15:35] that's our goal
[2:15:37] and then we're going to live throughout
[2:15:38] the ceaseless ages
[2:15:41] you realize that abel's been waiting 6
[2:15:43] 000 years now
[2:15:46] i thought about that when i was thinking
[2:15:47] about the resurrection i thought abel 6
[2:15:49] 000 years
[2:15:51] and you know when i got to think about
[2:15:53] eternity
[2:15:54] and abel
[2:15:55] see when when you get over there
[2:15:58] the prophet said he was over there he
[2:15:59] says there's no yesterday and there's no
[2:16:01] tomorrow
[2:16:03] there's no time
[2:16:04] you're not in time
[2:16:06] so that's totally insignificant if i go
[2:16:08] and ask abel abel boy you waited a long
[2:16:11] time he's going to say what are you
[2:16:12] talking about
[2:16:14] no this looks like a second
[2:16:18] he won't know what i'm talking about
[2:16:19] because it's just like that
[2:16:21] see how many knows that we've been going
[2:16:23] through this for six thousand years now
[2:16:24] the world has in sin for six thousand
[2:16:27] years and when you compare that to
[2:16:29] eternity it's really not long
[2:16:33] it's not long at all
[2:16:34] six thousand years because when we've
[2:16:36] been 100 000 years you see how long
[2:16:39] we've been here
[2:16:41] insignificant
[2:16:42] just like one second there's no time
[2:16:44] here amen that's gonna be awesome and
[2:16:47] never never
[2:16:49] be in time all right now i just had to
[2:16:51] stop and put a little more in there
[2:16:53] because we really just skip over it so
[2:16:55] fast we don't really try to comprehend
[2:16:57] and get the depth of it
[2:16:59] of what it really is going to be like
[2:17:01] what days what it's really going to be
[2:17:02] like
[2:17:05] amen y'all getting tired now
[2:17:08] all right y'all
[2:17:09] you know
[2:17:12] i try to be sensitive when they all
[2:17:14] start
[2:17:15] losing and everything it's time to shut
[2:17:17] down
[2:17:20] i've watched preachers that have
[2:17:22] absolutely bored the people to death and
[2:17:24] wouldn't quit i was like brother you
[2:17:26] need to get a revelation
[2:17:28] of your congregation
[2:17:30] when they have shut down shut him down
[2:17:32] and an hour later he was from upset with
[2:17:34] him
[2:17:35] because he really wasn't going anywhere
[2:17:38] just putting his input in it that's not
[2:17:40] what it's all about
[2:17:46] but still
[2:17:47] all right here we go
[2:17:50] now notice what a difference on that
[2:17:51] morning when we shall see our loved ones
[2:17:53] and to watch what they'll be
[2:17:55] all the afflictions will be taken away
[2:17:58] all the mars and sufferings will be done
[2:18:00] no more pale cheeks of death no more
[2:18:02] tears from the eyes
[2:18:04] the resurrection promises all of this
[2:18:06] there'll be no more funerals
[2:18:10] praise be to god i as a preacher i don't
[2:18:12] like doing funerals i don't like
[2:18:15] funerals i got to do funerals
[2:18:18] we don't take no pleasure in doing
[2:18:19] funerals
[2:18:21] no more patting the baby on the cheek
[2:18:22] that's like a piece of stone where the
[2:18:24] undertaker was embalmed and pushed out
[2:18:26] and put paint on and so forth to look
[2:18:29] natural it'll never be there again and
[2:18:32] to watch their character seeing how they
[2:18:33] conduct themselves with that sweetness
[2:18:36] and quietness no more nervousness or
[2:18:38] frustrations to see them standing in the
[2:18:40] likeness of jesus christ

[2:18:44] one of us
