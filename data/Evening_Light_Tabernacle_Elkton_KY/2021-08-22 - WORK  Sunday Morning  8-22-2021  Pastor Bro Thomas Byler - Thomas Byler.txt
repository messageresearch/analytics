TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we'll read down to 34. the next day john seeing jesus jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world this is he whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i am come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent him sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god and it said earlier we said that if we believed on him we became the sons of god and i think i always look at that scripture there um in in 30 let's see in 32 where it talks about the spirit descending down upon jesus he set that as an example jesus was god but he needed he needed everything that god was just like we need everything that god is he's the alpha the omega the beginning the end he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and we need that holy ghost experience to descend upon us just like jesus did and i just want to you know i want to say that with with passion this morning in a way that we can't live our lives without the holy ghost i've tried it it don't work you can you can be a good christian and not have the holy ghost you can be a good example and not have the holy ghost but when you live as a good christian and as an example with the holy ghost you not only change the lives of you your family but all those you come in contact with so this morning i just want to just say this as a little lesson that we can't have too much of god you can't study too much you can't pray too much you can't read too much and you sure can't have too much of the holy ghost god bless you go david this thing would be good sing that little course mr becky all my hope is in jesus this morning if we could and all my hope is in jesus thank god my yesterday's gone [Music] all my sins are forgiven and i've been watched by the blood

that's right where are they at this morning they don't know if they're going to come through that door wherever they're meeting and they're going to kill every one of them i thought lord how many of us would be at church myself included and i thought lord that's your children over there i pray you watch over them and you know and we were talking the things and sister natalie and them in the back and i said you know the pressure is just coming everywhere you go everybody it's just pressure pressure pressure the whole say but i'm glad you know why for jesus has come and brother branham said he can let off that pressure this morning because he's in our hearts and lives this morning he's alive and well this morning he said where's he at look at your neighbor that's where he's at this morning and i'm so glad this morning that he is in our midst this morning just his presence to know that he loves us he cares for us you say why do we have to go through these things i don't know but i know one thing that he said he had never leave me or he would never forsake me and i'm trusting that this morning and you know we we have so much to pray for all this mess going around but i thought lord

the lord good to see everybody out this morning amen it's just a wonderful day thank you musicians amen appreciate y'all's work amen each and every one this morning we just greet you in the name of the lord a little bit hoarse this morning so amen i'll probably not be able to scream at you too much so that'll be kind of nice for a change amen but anyway so we just want to try to speak on a subject to lord i feel late on my heart it was such a simple little word that just come to me and i thought well lord amen just have your way amen but let's just bow our heads and go before the lord in prayer lord jesus we come before you father thanking you lord once again to be able to come into your presence lord lord knowing god that each one father carries a portion of you in their hearts lord and when we assemble ourselves together like this lord we just make a great big pillar of fire lord jesus and create an atmosphere lord that you're just so welcome to come into lord and to have your way to speak to us along the way and our hearts could burn within us as you would speak to us this morning father by the way of your word lord and father i most of all just ask god that you would say what what you want to say to your people today lord jesus to your children this morning what we need to hear lord at this time lord and we just ask god that you'll just come in a special way lord get me out of the way use the gift that you've placed into my life lord jesus to speak and benefit and edify the body of christ lord thank you lord jesus already for the worship and everything you've done and said to us lord jesus and ministering to us father we ask you a blessing upon the reading of the word not in jesus name amen amen if you will turn your bibles to saint john the 19th i mean the ninth chapter saint john nine amen i had one word to come to me last week the last few days and then i kind of forgot it and just kind of laid it aside and then when i got serious about studying for the message this morning uh that word just kind of come back to me and i remembered that that had kind of come to me and i says well lord if that's what you want to be because you just give me the inspiration and will do what you want amen amen but the thought this morning that i want to speak on is just the one word called work work amen so i'm going to speak on working this morning and it comes to me i'll just say it uh maybe here a little bit but i mean you know the bible says one place that if a man doesn't work neither should he eat am i right so anyway if you will turn john 9 and this is a scripture that came to me when i begin to think about working nine and we'll begin with one one through four or actually let's go through five and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world amen my god is blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen i got to thinking about that statement that jesus made there speaking about how that he came to work the work and do the work that god had sent him to do and as i began to study this this whole thought of working i began to see something here that i probably haven't hardly ever preached on amen and that's pretty rare amen and so and i call it kind of the other side of salvation they kind of like two sides of salvation you know because we're constantly i'm always talking about salvation talking about being saved being baptized by giving your heart let the lord live through and so forth and uh but you know there's another side of it there's another side of it that i'd like to speak on for a little while this morning amen and that is what happens and what you do and what you become after you get saved isn't that right after you get saved amen and so i want to turn to another one another scripture in matthew 20. matthew 20. let's go to matthew 20. now read that and come back and pick up a little a couple more thoughts here on this first scripture matthew chapter 20 verse 1. the kingdom of heaven now notice the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man amen i like that don't you when jesus began to tell you what it's like now he's going to say uh just basically what uh the direction that we want to go this morning like unto a man that is a householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers amen into his vineyard now how many believe that after you get saved god hires you amen you become a hired hand amen you become a servant you're not just a child of god now you're not just predestinated before the foundation of the world the son and daughter of god but now god hires us amen it's kind of different category now you become a laborer how many believe we're laborers into his vineyard now he goes to talking about any point about how that he hired different ones at the different times of the day isn't that right and i remember the probably god talking about how that you notice that the 11th hour workers get the same reward as the first hour workers now the first hour workers didn't like that real well amen they didn't like that real well uh you know and they went to saying you know he says these last have wrought but one hour but that has they made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day amen he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong kids down not agree with me for a penny amen amen i like that so take that is thine and go thy way and i will give unto this last evenness unto thee is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine i evil because i am good amen so the last shall be first and the first shall be last amen i believe another place he says you know i don't do you any wrong because you know i can do it i can do with mine what i will and if you made a certain agreement in that right that's the agreement that you have and that's completely just he had made the same agreement with 11 hours workers you know you know and that's it and he was pretty generous the master was pretty generous to give the last hour workers the same as the first amendment and somebody believes that's true but listen i like that because god hires us now let me go back again picking back up again where he was over at saint john there's a couple things that i want to talk about amen i believe it's in saint john 9. he says well let's work while it's day the night cometh how many knows brother brahm says as far as the time wise as far as the time where we're at in time amen we know that we're cut the closing of time we're at evening time right amen and the night is coming the night is coming when no man's gonna work anymore in other words we're not gonna do this another round this is when you work this is our chance to work this is our time to do something for god brother bam said he was getting to the evening time of his life right and he was sitting there on his bed and meditating and thinking that right how did he was 52 years old and he says you know if you're going to do something for god you better get busy get to doing that because you ain't got a lot of time left to do anything for god amen i certainly could say that about me i'm 60 not 52. amen i i said i was 60 know that i if i if i ever lie to you and tell you that i'm older than i am i always call myself at 57 i says i'm i'm 58. all right then when i get 50 80 it's no big deal when i'm 58 i call myself 59 so then when i get this no big deal so i say i'm 60 even though i'm 59 because when i get there it's not a big deal all right so so now if i call myself that i'm not really lying it's just i'm preparing myself okay anyway so we just praise the lord amen and brother branham was the evening time of his life isn't that right i'm at the evening time of my life if i'm going to do anything for the lord amen and as a christian we appreciate the salvation that god has given us don't we amen and saving us and giving making the sons and daughters of god you know but as we get older we begin to think amen is that right but we're beginning to think what have i done for the lord what have i done to better the kingdom of god amen because how many knows that god is going to ask of us what we have done what did you do amen what kind of a servant was you what kind of a laborer in the vineyard was because we're not just sons but we're also servants amen we're laborers we've been hired to do a job amen and i like that because brother babe was bringing it out into sunday school act listen about how that god has called us to be a light to the world amen david said thy word is a lamp unto my feet right that word is a lamp unto my feet and so we're holding a lantern you know how many knows we're in a dark world holding a lantern and we're telling everybody else hey guess what you don't have to stumble around in the dark like you are there's actually a lamp that you can get a hold of and you can have a lamp today that'll guide you and show you where you are going amen we're lamp holders jesus says as long as i'm in the world i am the light of the world but then he said that you know you are the light of the world how many believes that we are called to be the light of the world we've got a job to do every last one of his children have a job to do he has called us to be laborers and have a job in his kingdom this morning amen and we know that uh you know even the problem of god said some of them quit working and and went out west and they thought they were just going to wait for the rapture quit their jobs sold their houses and everything he says don't do that you don't stop working until it's time to quit it's not quitting time yet you may get documently you're going to get knocked in your pain amen and there's of course there's a whole world brothers and sisters that we don't really realize but we know that for all that you do for all the labor that you put into it there's always there's rewards over there that will that'll catch up with you over there that'll be given to you on that day how many believe that and i believe if i'm not wrong y'all it kind of correct me if i'm wrong here but if you remember uh brother branham just for one thing he when he got over there and beyond the curtain of time and i'm not sure if it was the time that he uh had said you know if i'm getting older and he fell asleep and went caught up and there he was up there and then all of us are all of a sudden his horse was there in that right you know and his dog was there and if i'm not wrong but the voice said these are your rewards for your service and that right god's going to give him that because of his rewards for his service not only that another place it talks about because he said you know because we know the prophet of god immense amount of opposition right he had betrayals friends that betrayed him cheated in a lot and all kinds of things that he had to go through and he had to push against the wind so to speak he had to push a hard current and so forth and he chose to push it hard he chose to stay with the word of god when others when when he was brought up to people denominations like church of christ different ones offered him a jet to fly him from here to there pay all his wages take care of every part of him we'll take care of every part of you and brother branham is sitting there at the table he was a godly man and he says you know well what what do i have to do well if you'll just not be so hard on the women cutting their hair and the water baptism and the godhead and some of those things he says that's my very life that's that's what god has given me to preach that's my revelation i'm surprised that you as a man of god would ask me to compromise on the word of god he says you can have your jet plane you can have it i'm not for hire hello and he chose the harder path and remember whenever he was standing there and and uh the young man came up and said you know that could be the 23rd chapter of revelations and so forth and all of a sudden they begin to speak in tongues he began to speak in tongues and the interpretation was because you have chosen the heart of the weight out love the path there is a huge portion of heaven that awaits you it makes our man knows when he gets there but he gets there folks now i don't know but i do believe one thing and that is that he's going to be millions and millions of people that he led to the lord jesus christ amen like paul says they are the stars in my crown just like paul has mutas that he converted but a man had millions of the lord used him to convert isn't that right his whole ambition his whole goal was to get more into the kingdom of god and if you'll notice a lot of times in his services when he's praying he says forgive your unprofitable servant he felt unprofitable amen amen but it was at evening time it's evening time and i think about how that where here we are here you are here i am and even brother bannon many times in your life back in the 70s way back in 1960s talking about how did it's later than what you're thinking it's later than you think he kept saying it's later than you think [Music] it's getting late it's evening time it's almost i doubt i don't believe that i would die of old age before he will be here is that right i don't you know he also predicted and he predicted that perhaps before 77 he says i don't prophesy i just you know predict that by 1977 the millennium will be in it'll be over with us but then huh so that's where he was at now look at where we are and every time that there's a new law past everything that every time there's uh things that just like homosexuality acknowledged by our supreme court that was a great big darkness cutting darker and darker and darker amen and we can feel it in the last few weeks we can feel how it's just getting darker and darker and darker amen i don't know what it's like to sit in a tree and hunt amen and they have you know and the law is that you can shoot up to 30 minutes after sunset isn't that right and to sit there and when you know that the sun is set you've only got 30 minutes that's all you got because by then it is going to be too dark for you to do anything darkness will be there you better have your head lamp on your head or in your pouch you better have some light on you because you're not going to be able to see in 30 minutes and that's where you and i are we're not in the 30 minutes hardly we're back in the last five minutes of it we're right down to where it's almost dark with and nobody will be able to work folks and i'm here to tell you how many beliefs that even we're gonna people they're gonna try to shut us down but as long as we have breath we're gonna try to do something for the kingdom of god i don't care what it is folks just do something for the kingdom of god let god use you let you be a laborer to be a blessing to your neighbor to be a blessing to your loved ones to be a blessing in order to like to your worker or the worker to the boss whatever it might be you just want god to work and live and be a light amen they spread the gospel into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature i believe every christian woman or man is called to testify of the power and of the grace of god [Music] hey man how many believes it here we are at the closing and sometimes you know it looks like in myself you find yourself getting so caught up in the things of the world amen if you begin to lose your enthusiasm i'm losing my enthusiasm for the world and for the things of this world because we realize we realize it's absolutely futile it will mean nothing to you then our benjamin franklin's and our bender and our and our bank accounts they're not going to be anything one of these days amen god's not going to ask you how much money you make he's going to ask how better at light how good a light how good a labor was you in my vineyard what did you do for me amen and i thought strange brother david speaking of just before he coming out talking about amen what we want to hear you brother branham said he says you know i didn't hear him when he said come unto me oh you are weary and heavy laden but i do want to hear him when he says come on in thou good and faithful servant and enter into the joys of the lord i do want to hear that i going to hear something said that you were a good and you were a faithful servant he didn't say just you're a son of god come on in no you were a good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the lord amen we know that our salvation has nothing to do with our works isn't that right sure it don't but amen while we serve the lord shows whether we love him or not how many believe that all right so praise be to god so we're called how many knows we're called to work in the work while it's day like this yon's father say work while his day for the night is coming we're quietly there who's going to go and tell the people how to find a way work while it's day for the night is coming folks the night is just about honest if you're going to do anything i feel the holy spirit saying to all of us if you're going to do something for him you better do it now that's all you don't want to look back and say oh i wish i would have done that i wish i would have done this brother man came to the deathbed of many people who said oh i want my child i want my son i want my daughter i want you gotta do this but not once you got to do that you know because i didn't do it he says that don't work they can't do it for you you miss your opportunity you didn't do it when you was there now you want somebody else to do it that worked that way amen so if you're going to work you better work do something for god amen hallelujah because the hour's late amen amen jesus himself when he was here amen he was moved because he saw the great multitudes was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd but he was having quite a time perhaps with his crowd and all of a sudden he says you know he says to his disciples the harvest truly is plenty of us but the laborers are few folks they know we didn't be oh another he didn't come to be ministered to you know because they were having a dispute and they were angry with that young man who said that he wanted to be on the right hand of the father and so forth and mama and support one on the one they were angry with him because they want to do it they wanted that kind of position he said you know the gentiles exercise dominion and power and authority over you but he says it shall not be so with you the least of yours if it will be the greatest let him be your servant amen oh my so there he was and he says you know the laborers are few amen the harvest truly is plenty but the laborers are if you pray therefore to the lord of harvest that he will send forth laborers into the harvest we don't come here to be served folks we don't come here to be petted and to be babied we come here to be a light to others and a help to others jesus whole life was spent to live for others amen and not himself over in james let's talk about works for just a minute let's pick this up see what james thought about works and working and doing stuff james 2 and verse 14 he says what does it prophet my brother and man say he has faith and have not works can faith save him if a brother or a sister be naked and destitate a destitute of daily food huh and you say well hallelujah brother i believe god can supply and be on your merry way now when you got a freezer full of steaks and rib eyes and fish and everything else and you don't give them anything see how many of those working is something that you do the james was saying there's got to be something that goes along with our faith and it's our actions it's what we do all right and one of you saying to him departed peace and be warmed and filled notwithstanding he give them not those things which are needful of the body what does it profit even so faith if it hath not works it's dead being alone amen yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have worked show me thy faith without the works now notice and i will show thee my faith by my works how many believes that our works show whether we have faith or whether we don't zip the lip and show me the action we give god to way too much lip service not enough action [Music] now james covers this about abraham believe god and he's imputed him the righteous he covers that but he also brings this in and he makes a great point even so faith if it had not worked maybe i don't know if any man say that okay i read that thou believers there is one god thou do as well the devils also believe and tremble but will thou know o man no obey me that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified but works when he had offered isaac help his son on the altar see is now how that faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect amen the scripture says and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how to that by works a man is justified and not by faith only amen how many knows that is the other the flip side of the coin is god believe that but why then did god still take abraham up there and say go and offer up your only son i want you to kill him and god was so interested in seeing abraham's action behind his faith that he let abraham take that sharp bag and come up with his hand and he was fixing to plunge it into his son because that's what god said amen right and the angel even called out said hold it hold that head don't do it i want it to prove i want to see all that they see some action behind your faith that's what james was trying to say look how many we can say we have faith all we want to but our actions prove whether we have faith or not real genuine faith has works behind it fake faith doesn't real fake faith it's not real because if you really genuinely have faith like you should have amen praise the lord you love him my then he goes on we'll finish the chapter up he says likewise also was not ray have the harlot justified by works when he had seen receive the messages and that sent them away another way now notice he brings in rahab talking about rehab said we know she said to those those spies that hollis we know that god is with you and everybody is weak we're trembling and we i believe that god is forgotten real and what they say they said if you help us escape if you help us escape and you lower us down and you get us out of here when we come back we'll spare you and because of what she did not just because of what she believed but because of what she did she was spared amen so how many believes that it all has to come together there is a contradiction when somebody says they have faith and they don't have the works to go along with it there's a contradiction somewhere god doesn't contradict amen praise the lord you love him this morning [Music] so i believe that god is looking for us and he's looking for works amen he sure is he's hiring us amen he's hiring us to be a laborer in the vineyard again if you want to turn with me you can to matthew i'm going to look at another parable amen there's a parable that i'm leaving off that i don't really understand it's the one where he had a vineyard and i do understand partial of it but not the way that i want to understand it of how did he send his servants into that vineyard to get the fruit of it and they always killed him so he said his son because he thought they would respect him and they killed him remember that you know and i know it has something to do with the prophets that he sent that killed him jesus they killed him and so forth you know but they were certainly servants that were unprofitable and did not work with the kingdom of god they were actually working against the kingdom of god isn't that right and it talks about how that he says what do you think that master of those servants will do he will take an army and he will destroy him the bible says he'll destroy him in that right but let's look at this one over here over in chapter 25 of matthew the kingdom of heaven verse 14. the kingdom is locked unto a man traveling into a far country amen who called his own servants and delivered them his goods how many days the only hand god has is yours amen he has hired us over his kingdom he has delivered unto us all his guts that's heavy he has put upon us the burden of the holy ghost he has put upon us the burden of this generation martin luther john wesley brother abandoned all those preachers they've done theirs but now how many knows it's our turn it's each and every one of our turn to do our work to do our job amen can i say this by the holy spirit let's do our job let's do what god has called us to do to work in his vineyard to go into all the world oh i can tell you quote after quote when bible god said you know if we're not winning souls we have failed we literally fail amen if we get our eyes off of anything other than winning souls he says his old ambition if somebody will say help him what is your ambition and my ambition is to see people come to jesus christ there's nothing else eternal that's the only thing that you can do that's the only place that you can invest your treasure where rust don't come up corrupt and thieves don't break in and steal it's on things that are eternal amen i'll tell you what it's so easy to get caught up in this world in this last few minutes things that really don't have any meaning at all no value at all amen he delivered them under his goods to the one who gave five talents into another one all right five talents two to another and to another he gave one according to his several ability and straightway he took his journey amen we know that the five went got five more the three went and got three more but the one he went and hit his talent he was a silent christian you know he was a christian that didn't really win another soul he didn't take this talent and do something for the lord but he did it amen and whenever the lord came back and he asked him what did you do with what i gave you amen let me tell you something how many believes that god is i believe that god has given me the gift of a pastor he gave gifts unto men if you're a preacher god has to give that gift to you i've seen and had too many in my pulpit already that wanted to preach but they didn't have the gift but nowhere i'm going to give anybody a try hey if you don't have the gift just forget it you can't manufacture it come up i've had people come up here amen and promote carnality that's the way you handle it hey i get kind of myself sometime and preach and i gotta repent of that stuff but when i see that that's that's their purpose that's their goal that's what they really like i said that gift ain't there and amen but if god has given me a gift of pastoring lord help me that's what i'll answer for i'll answer for how i use the gift that god gave me boy i'll tell you what it's not it when you look at it and you realize the responsibility of it you don't want it amen you'd rather not but if you don't you give the answer for what you did you're in it you might as well go do what god wants you to do or you'll be in a whole lot of trouble amen every man according to his ability first corinthians says god has said some in the church first apostles secondary prophets certainly teachers after that miracles gifts of healing helps all right governments diversities of tongues are all apostles are all prophets or all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues who all interpreted see that was the problem with pentecost they thought everybody should speak in tongues everybody should interpret god never meant that that way certain people have gifts of that they'll have gifts to that and so forth amen ah i don't know if i should say it but it came into my imagination can you imagine if all you saw up here was lips moving the rest of my body's gone everything was just lips just speaking huh it's all hands it's all head it's all body it's all female there's a whole body it looks a lot better it is for you don't it yeah you'd be looking like what's up there good gracious all i'm seeing his mouth move amen but that's what he's saying are all apostles all prophets amen in another place it's just across the page he says he says you know uh if the whole body we're an eye where if the whole we're hearing where were the spelman am i right i may believe we're all a part of body and especially a body like this and everybody out there cause some of people you some of y'all might wonder well what is my gift what what the lord wants me to do what is my talent y'all pretty quiet now all right listen have all the interpretation but covet lyrically the best gifts and yet i show you a more excellent way so we see that god divides only as he will he gives some this and some that we all know that right gives us all a different thing something else to do something to do for the kingdom of god my job is to be up here to preach the gospel amen that's what i'm to do that's what god has taught me to do to be a witness wherever i go whatever i'm doing and he's called each and every one of us to do this amen to be a witness in our corner of the world amen because sometimes i think lord in my younger life i thought of going to africa i thought about going here and being a witness and uh you know perhaps getting uh in danger you know because they don't want to hear the gospel getting run out and threatened to get spirits through or doing challenging things and being bold for the faith you know but god i've never once done those things and but the comes back this is what i called you to do but i wanted you over there if i wanted you to do nothing i'd have to do that i mean god always makes a way for his gifts god opened the door for me to be here to do what i do here how many does it juicy where you sit for a purpose and for a reason amen you might think well i i can't preach didn't let them say that you know you know a certain person or sister maybe or somebody like says well i brought about him i can't preach i can't do much he says but yeah you can pray you can pray for the prophet you can pray for the preacher and they're right how many prays for the preacher before coming to church during the week pray that is what you're supposed to do amen whatever it might be all the different things you can do but work for his king to find something for him to do amen well i just sing a special once in a while have you got any idea how that blesses somebody when you do that what if nobody was willing to sing a special oh it doesn't have to end in this church in this church you haven't got you don't have to have the perfect voice you don't have to hold it as long as you can and tell you about pass out all i ask all of you to do is to sing it from your heart don't you just love to hear somebody to sing not because they want you to hear their pretty voice but because you you can just feel it that's what they feel in their soul amen it's a blessing well i don't do nothing yeah you're doing something you're supporting the church of god right there sitting there this morning that's doing something amen amen praise the lord you support the pastor perhaps you support the church report to pastor that spurs every and we want to continue to do this but i appreciate the missionary offering that we we as a group can give to send go over there and help some of god's people i believe that's all in order it's all part of the gospel go into all the world and preach the gospel be a witness amen but whatever god has blessed you in doing giving you a talent in amen maybe he's blessed you in making money maybe you make a lot of money you may never have to answer whether you preached or not or just out of the other but god will say what did you do with your money what did you do with all that money i let you make how did you handle it that's what you'll have to give an account for amen because we the bottom of the bible talks about it now i mean the ls everything's for god in its place you might not be able to go but what did the father say if you can't go send somebody oh hallelujah remember the little old lady that was inspired to have a meeting in some horse stable isn't it some horse everyone she cleaned that thing up properly freshly started hey man put tracks out we're gonna have a meeting and some preacher come and preach there's only one boy that showed up and some bib overalls country looking guy wasn't it dwight moody i think he was like moody right brother amen he gave his heart to god and won millions sometimes that that woman will be credited she'll be credited for all that that little something that you do amen just that little something that you do in the kingdom of god not even a cup of cold water can be given to one of god's children but taught you get a reward for it amen as it gets darker i'm no you shine biter brother's got a decent haircut wear decent clothes you sisters go out there in walmart everybody looks at you look at that sister with that long grass and skirt that is so odd huh and now i guarantee you there's one thing they will try to snuff that light out because that's their conscience you're the only conscience this world has anymore isn't that right it breaks their constant they realize that's how you're supposed to be that's how you're supposed to dress and then that's how you're supposed to act it's getting dark the hour is getting late i don't know about you but i say lord help me to do my job better or i don't want to regret i don't want to come down to the end of my life and say oh i just didn't do what i i still but still you feel like an unprofitable servant you still feel like lord i just haven't done nothing how many i just really don't feel that i've done my share i have not done as much for the kingdom of god as what i should have i sure like the two more amen didn't brother ma'am say that about himself he says i've won millions i should have won 10 millions with the gift that god has given me that gift that god had given him of discernment of healing faith oh my the gifts of being able to say if i've told you the truth and jesus don't show up here you call me a false prophet and run me out of your town guess what he never got run out of town because jesus always would come and he would prove that what he said was the truth the sacred could heal dead would be raised people would give their lives the lord he tell people lord if you've been unfaithful to your marriage vows if you've done this that or the other god is willing to forgive you if you'll give your heart to god here some of the worst kind of sins the horriblest things that a person could commit it says god will be given for you if you'll just be willing to repent amen your christ come down and vindicate like that do great miracles and signs and wonders amen maybe like i said maybe you should support the pastor you say well i don't do nothing you do that and the god and perhaps the pastor preaching amen people come give their hearts alive people are saved that way you're supporting a cause isn't that right because you're supporting the church of the living god how many his beliefs i don't the church of god maybe god is universal not just one place but everywhere you love him i love him with all my heart and i just want to do something that's pleasing to him let's look at another one shall we oh my when i thought about this i says you know we preach so much about being saved predestinated but how much do we really speak about working in the vineyard and doing something how many knows that for most of us and myself that means being a light to your neighbor right a light to your neighbor which every one of us can probably say lord help me isn't that right help me to be a better light to my neighbor [Music] all right luke 17 i want to talk about the attitude of the laborer what kind of an attitude that we should have as servants as higher laborers as workers who have been given a talent of some kind for the kingdom of god all right luke 17. we'll begin with verse 6. the lord said if you had faith as the grain of a mustard seed you might say unto this sycamore tree and it's not sycamore sick of mine something like that be that plucked up by the roots and be that cast into the sea and it should should obey you which of you but which of you in other words if you have great faith that's wonderful but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meet or will he rather not say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink does he thank that servant because he did the things or commanded him huh thank you thank you in other words he said the master don't look i hired you i paid for you paid for you to do this i hired you to do you're my servant he don't thank him for all that now this is kind of different coming from jesus right what did jesus say i throw not now that must be a throw that's new to me and i throw not what are we throwing right but from what i understand he says i i bet not i think not so that we'd understand right no nothing he's saying no he doesn't think him so likewise ye when you shall have done all these things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which is our duty to do folks let me say this any servant doesn't matter who it is me anybody once you think you're something or you've done something for god oh you're not at the place you ought to be you're at the place where you ought to be realized i really haven't done nothing yet i just did what you commanded me to do i may believe with god we should go the extra mile lord i should have done so much more how many of our older folks is the afternoon can say with me i feel like i should have done so much more for the lord i still feel like an unprofitable servant lord help me i still feel like an unprofitable servant i can see why brother ben of all he did he would say forgive and help your unprofitable servant because we're just doing what god has asked us to do now how many of us would have to be honest with ourselves and say well i barely do that sometimes i barely do that sometimes just doing what god said do amen god bless you let's stand if you will with me this morning musicians you can come with our heads bowed i stand here with a heavy heart this morning because i feel the lateness of the day i feel that the day is far spent it's just upon us i feel the holy spirit crying out in me calling out to you why are we so overly concerned about the things of this world when really our whole ambition is to soon leave this world we can't stay here much longer you won't have a chance to do anything when it gets totally dark when it's dark it's dark when it's over it's over search your heart look at the opportunities that you've missed i look at the opportunities that i've missed i've not been as bold as like what paul said pray that i could speak with boldness the devil and his people they're very bold with their agenda but where's where are we at as christians with ours to spread the light stand for what's right to help those around us find their way to feel like brother brad spoke i have this light in my heart you can have it too i have this peace in my heart you can have it too just to proclaim the gospel that he died for the whole sins of the whole world the same gospel he began to preach on the day of pentecost repent world jesus christ died on calvary for you you don't have to live that way there's a different life for you preach the gospel to every creature maybe it's a possum maybe it's hornets doesn't matter preach the gospel to every creature be a light for me i've left you with a talent i've left my kingdom i've left it all in your hands how have you done how have we done as a group in our local area have i done lord forgive me i haven't done the way that i should i'm not nervous near as much as i should [Music] but lord from this morning

[Music] like we should [Music] too interested in other things lord [Music] lord help us from this morning on we're just to find our little way just find a little place lord i think the talent that you've given us lord to use it for your kingdom lord jesus i ask god to help us as your people as your church that we work together hand in hand lord that just because we're not this we're not that we're not what somebody else is god don't let us never look at that bottom but just lord save i'm just a finger i'm just a little finger but i'll help hold that i'll help hold that up i'll grab a hold of that with all the rest of the fingers and i'll make it move a little better lord lord i ask this morning to look at every heart this morning father [Music] and help us to give us give us the ability lord to surrender to you say lord we feel like we're unprofitable [Music] we're coming down to closing of it all lord what have we done for you how many souls have we brought to your kingdom

dead to me they just don't mean nothing no more we're ready to go home we're like oh [Music] it'd be no glory [Music] this is not our home [Music] lord we feel you coming we feel your rising up lord from that mercy lord we maybe have loved once we have different ones we want to see and more help us reach out our hand to him lord and say hurry hurry are there's not much time it's almost dark

in your kingdom there's one that's not ready lord me to get ready tonight this morning father there's this entering here that don't know you there's a christian that really don't know how to serve you

we believe you're we're your children god but father i still feel like lord jesus there's a lot of adjustment that we need to make god for you a lot of work that you need to do in our lives lord and
