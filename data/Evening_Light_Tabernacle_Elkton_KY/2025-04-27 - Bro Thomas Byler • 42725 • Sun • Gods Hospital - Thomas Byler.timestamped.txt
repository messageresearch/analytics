[16:01] Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[16:04] If we'll just all stand this
[16:07] morning, just go before him in prayer
[16:09] this
[16:11] morning. Dear Lord Jesus, it's such a
[16:14] privilege, Lord, to come into your house
[16:16] once again, dear Lord, as we walk the
[16:19] different ways that we go, dear Lord, in
[16:21] life through the weak, dear Lord. We
[16:23] come battered down and maybe weary, dear
[16:26] Lord. But we come here this morning,
[16:28] dear Lord, to regain strength, dear
[16:30] Lord. Gain strength from your word, dear
[16:32] Lord.
[16:35] to press on, dear Lord, for we know
[16:36] we're in a late hour, Lord. You're so
[16:38] good to us, Lord. We know there's lots
[16:40] of needs, dear Lord. I don't know all
[16:42] the needs, dear Lord, but you know all
[16:43] the needs. Pray, dear Lord, that is even
[16:46] as the word goes forth, dear Lord, that
[16:48] you go and minister unto those needs,
[16:50] dear Lord, whether it be healing, dear
[16:51] Lord, or questions that may need
[16:54] answered, dear Lord, or whatever it may
[16:56] be, dear Lord, that you help your
[16:59] children, dear Lord. And we know you
[17:00] will because you promise you promised
[17:02] that you would, dear Lord. Your word
[17:04] says that you would never leave us nor
[17:06] forsake us, dear Lord. We're here this
[17:08] morning, dear Lord. And our gathering is
[17:09] not in vain, dear Lord. As you didn't
[17:12] come in vain, dear Lord. You came for a
[17:13] purpose. We came this morning for a
[17:16] purpose, dear Lord, to hear from you. So
[17:18] we pray dear Lord that every portion
[17:20] dear Lord of the service dear de dear
[17:22] Lord now would be just guided dear Lord
[17:25] by your divine intervention dear Lord
[17:27] that you'd
[17:28] just speak what you'd have to speak and
[17:31] let us hear dear Lord what you want us
[17:33] to hear. We ask these things dear Lord
[17:35] your precious name Jesus Christ's name.
[17:38] Amen. Children can be dismissed for
[17:40] Sunday school and if you'll go in the
[17:42] Psalms with me here. Psalms
[17:49] 20. Small
[17:52] little chapter here in Psalms
[17:55] 20. But sometimes it's not always about
[17:57] being
[17:58] big. Sometimes it's quality over
[18:01] quantity. So Psalms
[18:06] 20, the Lord hear thee. In the day of
[18:09] trouble, the name of God of Jacob defend
[18:12] thee.
[18:17] Remember all thy offerings and accept
[18:20] thy burnt sacrifice. SA
[18:28] we will rejoice in the salvation. In thy
[18:31] salvation and in the name of our God we
[18:33] will set up our banners. The Lord
[18:36] fulfill all thy petitions.
[18:48] Some trust in chariots and some in
[18:50] horses, but we will remember the name of
[18:52] the Lord our God.
[19:00] Save the Lord. Let the King hear us when
[19:03] we call. God bless. You may be seated,
[19:05] Brother Brian.
[19:19] morning brothers and
[19:24] sisters. Uh if you want to mark a place
[19:28] in your Bible, you can 15th chapter of
[19:31] Romans and the 10th chapter of Hebrews.
[19:35] But that one scripture
[19:37] there, some trust in chariots and some
[19:40] in horses, but we will remember the name
[19:42] of the Lord our God. I was just think I
[19:46] was thinking this
[19:49] morning yesterday working and this
[19:51] morning
[19:53] studying the world that we live in is
[19:56] the purpose out there. that world out
[20:00] there is to put darkness over you, to
[20:03] make you not believe the things that you
[20:06] believe. And I was just thinking this
[20:08] morning, we all hit sit here this
[20:10] morning and the most important thing
[20:12] that we can have in our hearts and lives
[20:15] is a clear mind. And the only way you
[20:17] can have a clear mind and the right mind
[20:20] is the mind of Christ has to be in you
[20:22] this morning. If you don't have the mind
[20:24] of Christ, then all that's going on out
[20:27] there in the world will affect your soul
[20:29] and spirit. It'll want to take away from
[20:31] you your joy, your ability to worship
[20:35] the Lord and to be at peace in the word
[20:37] of God and in Christ this morning. And I
[20:40] and I was thinking in the world we live
[20:43] in is it I I don't even like mentioning
[20:46] the things that go on out there in the
[20:48] world or even thinking about them. But
[20:50] really to sit here this morning with a
[20:52] clear mind to know that God loves you
[20:55] and that he's thought of you enough to
[20:57] save your soul and make you be able to
[21:00] possess your salvation in joy and in the
[21:03] humbleness of the word of God. And
[21:05] everyone here this morning to have that
[21:07] clear mind has to be born by the word of
[21:10] God. Nothing other than that will give
[21:12] you that clear mind. And I was just
[21:14] thinking when you're born of the word of
[21:17] God, it's it it's the two things are
[21:20] together. You can't have Christ without
[21:22] the word and you can't have the word of
[21:24] God without having Christ at the same
[21:26] time. It's all one thing knitted
[21:28] together in your heart and life this
[21:30] morning. And I was just the world is a
[21:33] crazy place and I was just thinking I'll
[21:36] just read. Uh but that really struck me.
[21:39] Uh you know I've been sitting alone for
[21:42] hours thinking about all the things that
[21:44] God has done for me in my life. And I'm
[21:46] sure all of you could sit there and
[21:48] think of all the things that God's done
[21:51] for you in your life where he's brought
[21:53] you through. Sometimes we forget about
[21:55] that. We get so busy in the things of
[21:57] this world and this life, we forget to
[22:00] look back and see what that's the only
[22:02] time it's really good to look back and
[22:04] to think consider all the blessings that
[22:07] God has given you in your life. And you
[22:09] can look back and see where he moved
[22:11] something for you 10 years ago or 20 or
[22:14] 30 or even yesterday. He moved a
[22:17] situation for you where you know that he
[22:19] loves you and he cares about you. And
[22:21] each time you remember those things, it
[22:24] gives you more strength for the next day
[22:25] ahead, but I'll read what uh Paul had to
[22:28] say here in 15. I'm not going to read
[22:31] this whole chapter, but
[22:34] I not losing my
[22:36] place. Let me swap something here. I
[22:40] wrote some notes to myself. Sometimes I
[22:42] I write a lot of things down and I'm not
[22:45] good for notes. You probably all know
[22:47] that about me. I tried to when God some
[22:50] speaks something to me, I I don't have
[22:52] to have a lot of notes to myself, but I
[22:54] I wrote this down this
[22:58] morning. Why the world is the way it is
[23:01] without even going to the scripture. Why
[23:02] you see your friends out there in the
[23:04] world doing the things they do or not
[23:07] having the satisfaction in their lives,
[23:10] it's because they're not grounded in the
[23:12] word of God. the whole world out there,
[23:14] its sole purpose is to keep people
[23:17] ungrounded in the word of God, in the
[23:19] truths of God's word. And if you're not
[23:22] grounded, you'll be just like everyone
[23:24] else in the world. You'll be not
[23:26] believing this or not believing that.
[23:28] You won't have any foundation. So when
[23:30] the troubles come, you're always
[23:32] worrying about the outcomes. But if
[23:34] you've got Christ and the word of God,
[23:36] you're not worried about the outcomes
[23:38] because the word of God tells you what
[23:40] the outcome will be. And I was just
[23:43] thinking the insanity of the people. You
[23:46] know, you have people on the street 40
[23:49] years ago that would be in an insane
[23:51] institution and in 2025 they're running
[23:54] the streets like everything's normal.
[23:56] But I'll just read from what the
[23:59] scriptures what Paul had to say here
[24:01] this morning. And then I'm going to jump
[24:03] up into Hebrews the 10th
[24:05] chapter. And it says, "We that are
[24:08] strong ought to bear the infirmities of
[24:10] the weak, not to please ourselves." So,
[24:13] you know, we should care about each
[24:15] other. We should lift each other up.
[24:17] Paul's saying here, "Let everyone of us
[24:20] please his neighbor for his good to
[24:23] edification. For even Christ pleased not
[24:26] himself, but as written, the reproaches
[24:29] of them that reproach thee fell on me.
[24:32] whatsoever thing were written a for time
[24:35] were written for our learning that we
[24:37] through patience and comfort of the
[24:39] scripture might have hope. You know,
[24:42] I've talked about this a lot over the
[24:44] years. You know, there's a difference
[24:46] between a natural hope and an internal
[24:48] hope and something that's eternal. The
[24:50] hope that we have eternally, it's
[24:52] settled. You don't have to question it.
[24:54] God will have you there on that day.
[24:56] That's the kind of hope that we're
[24:58] talking about here this morning. And I
[25:00] lost my place. Uh fifth verse, now the
[25:04] God of patience and consolation grant
[25:07] you to be likeminded one toward another
[25:09] according to Christ Jesus. And again, it
[25:12] that last two words there, Christ Jesus.
[25:15] We know that the way you're going to
[25:17] care for each other and treat each other
[25:20] is by the word of God. Not by your own
[25:22] idea or your own way, but by the word of
[25:24] God itself. And it says that you may be
[25:27] of one mind and one mouth and glorify
[25:30] God even the father of our lord Jesus
[25:33] Christ. And I of the seventh words
[25:36] wherefore receive ye one another as
[25:38] Christ has received us to the glory of
[25:41] God. And uh really you have to have that
[25:44] mind. I was just thinking you really
[25:46] need I know I'm saying this a lot but
[25:49] it's so important that you have the mind
[25:51] of God this morning. outside of having
[25:53] the mind of God when the person talks to
[25:56] you about how you're wrong. If you don't
[25:58] know the word of God and you don't know
[26:01] the the message of the hour, if it
[26:03] hasn't if it's not deep in your soul and
[26:06] revealed to you that devil out there,
[26:08] you'd be surprised if you're not
[26:10] grounded in it, you'll be doubting the
[26:12] things you believe. That's why you have
[26:14] to be firm in it. And I'll go um this is
[26:18] a long chapter. I don't
[26:22] I start at about the 10th chapter of
[26:26] Hebrews, not wanting to re to read this
[26:29] whole chapter. Let's start at about the
[26:31] 23rd verse this
[26:36] morning. I know I get in a hurry. Don't
[26:38] give you a chance to turn this stuff.
[26:40] But um again, when you read this and the
[26:44] tits in it, how do you you know there's
[26:47] a lot of people out there that don't
[26:48] believe Paul wrote this book, but when
[26:51] you read how this is wrote, I it I can't
[26:54] believe how people wouldn't believe
[26:55] that. But starting at the 23rd verse,
[26:58] and it says here, let us hold fast the
[27:00] possession of our faith without
[27:02] wavering, for as he is faithful that
[27:05] promised. And he goes on to say, "Let us
[27:08] consider one another to provoke unto
[27:10] love and good works." So like I said in
[27:12] in this other chapter, that hope, that
[27:15] foundation that we have, and he's fa
[27:18] That's why it's so you can trusted that
[27:20] he's faithful to perform that promise he
[27:23] gave to us. Not forsaken the assembling
[27:25] of yourselves together as the manner of
[27:28] some is, but exhorting one another so
[27:31] much more as you see that day
[27:33] approaching. That's that speaks to this
[27:36] day and age right now. As you see the
[27:38] world get worse, it should make you get
[27:40] closer. For if we sin willfully after we
[27:43] have and then the scriptur is mentioned
[27:45] a lot in the message of the hour. For if
[27:48] we sw sin willfully after that we have
[27:51] received the knowledge of the truth.
[27:53] There remainth no more sacrifice for
[27:55] sins. But a real believer doesn't have
[27:57] to worry about that scripture because if
[28:00] you're saved and full of the Holy Ghost,
[28:01] you won't do this. but a certain fearful
[28:04] looking for the judgment and fiery
[28:06] indignation which shall devour the
[28:09] adversary. And he that he that despised
[28:12] and again he using an example where you
[28:15] can go back to the Old Testament he that
[28:18] despised Moses law died without mercy
[28:21] under two or three witnesses. How much
[28:24] sore a punishment suppose ye shall be be
[28:29] thought worthy who hath trotten under
[28:30] the foot the son of God who hath counted
[28:32] the blood of the covenant whereth we
[28:35] were sanctified an unholy thing and had
[28:38] done despite unto the spirit of grace
[28:41] and uh for we know that excuse me here
[28:46] for we know him that hath said vengeance
[28:49] belongth unto me I will recump sayaith
[28:52] the lord Again, the Lord shall judge his
[28:54] people. And then it get this scriptures
[28:58] really, it's a fearful thing to fall
[29:00] into the hands of a living God. But call
[29:03] to remembrance the former days in which
[29:05] after you were illuminated, you endured
[29:07] a great fight and
[29:09] affliction. And I I'll just finish. This
[29:12] is not
[29:13] really I'll just jump down a couple of
[29:16] verses
[29:21] here and I'll read what this had to say
[29:24] this morning. I'll just the be the last
[29:27] couple of verses are better than the
[29:28] ones that I've been reading and I'll
[29:30] start at the 34th verse. For you have
[29:33] compassion of me and my bonds, took
[29:35] joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
[29:37] knowing in yourself, that you have in
[29:39] heaven a better and enduring
[29:42] substance. Cast not away, therefore your
[29:45] confidence, which you hath great
[29:47] recumptants of reward, that you have
[29:49] used the patience after you have done
[29:52] the will of God, you might receive the
[29:54] promises for yet a little while, and he
[29:57] that shall come will come and will not
[29:59] tarry. Now the ju and that's what I was
[30:02] saying. I don't find it hard how to
[30:03] believe people can't believe that Paul
[30:05] wrote this because this 38th verse goes
[30:08] right back to Romans
[30:10] 1:17. Now the just shall live by faith.
[30:13] But if any man draw back my soul shall
[30:15] have no pleasure in them. But we are but
[30:18] we are not after them who draw back
[30:21] ontoition but of them that believe to
[30:23] the saving of the soul. That's what I
[30:25] was saying in the beginning. It's so
[30:28] important that you have that clear mind
[30:30] this
[30:31] morning, that you're able to see the
[30:33] word of God for the hour that we live
[30:34] in. And I'll just read what this quote
[30:36] was. It's from the devotional in the
[30:38] voice of God. And I'll sit down this
[30:41] morning, but really before I read this,
[30:44] I it's really important that you're
[30:47] established and grounded in the I I'll
[30:50] say it again in the word of God that the
[30:52] word of God has its full effect in your
[30:54] life this morning because I as I see the
[30:57] world as it is this morning, it's not
[30:59] going to get any better. Brother
[31:01] Brandham told us it's only going to get
[31:02] worse. You know, I was just thinking and
[31:05] when he it's been what, almost 60 years.
[31:09] He's been off the scene. Well, yeah,
[31:11] it's close to 60 years. And I can just
[31:15] imagine the people in
[31:17] 1965 when he said the world was going to
[31:19] go
[31:20] insane and and you looked at the 1965
[31:25] world and you look at
[31:27] 2025 that it's night and day that what's
[31:30] going on in the world. And if you a year
[31:33] from now, it'll probably advance like it
[31:35] did the last 50 years. In a year from
[31:38] now, it might advance as much as it
[31:40] would have in 50 years. That's just how
[31:42] crazy the place is. So, as but like that
[31:46] scripture said, as you see it getting
[31:48] worse, that means we're getting closer.
[31:50] So, it should be a comforting thing. At
[31:52] the same time, I'll just read what
[31:54] brother Brandham had to say. The whole
[31:55] armor of God is supernatural. And that's
[31:58] really important. Your armor is the
[32:00] supernatural God inside you, which is
[32:03] the armor of God. Love, which is love.
[32:05] You know, that really strikes me that
[32:08] without love, everything we're doing is
[32:10] meaningless. If you don't have the love
[32:12] of God this morning, it's just law and
[32:14] it's just doing it to do it.
[32:17] Scientifically, prove me there's such a
[32:19] thing as love. Where is it? You, how
[32:22] many love? Raise up your hand. Of
[32:24] course, I know everyone here would love
[32:26] your wife. You love your brother. You
[32:27] love your friends. Well, I want somebody
[32:30] some science to prove to me that prove
[32:33] to me what part of you is love. Where do
[32:36] you buy it at? What drugstore? And we
[32:38] know that's what he's getting to right
[32:40] there. If the love that we have for God
[32:43] is something that God gives us, the
[32:45] natural love we have is something we're
[32:46] just born with. I I want a bunch of
[32:50] it. I love joy. But you got joy, peace,
[32:54] longsuffering, gentle. And he's
[32:56] basically saying here, if you got the
[32:58] love of God, all these other virtues
[33:00] will possess you. You got the joy, you
[33:03] got the joy, peace, longsuffering,
[33:05] gentleness, patience. What is it? It's
[33:08] all supernatural. And I know that in my
[33:10] own life that without God's grace in my
[33:12] life, I know I just know the my Baldwin
[33:15] nature that if I didn't have the love of
[33:18] God in me, I know some of these virtues
[33:21] I wouldn't possess this morning. It's
[33:22] only by his grace. All of it is
[33:25] supernatural. God is supernatural. You
[33:28] don't scientifically prove God. You
[33:31] believe God, you believe it. If you
[33:33] don't believe it, then a man that says
[33:35] everything that's not sci scientifically
[33:38] is unorthodox. No, that's right. Then
[33:41] that man will never be a Christian. I
[33:44] think that's funny. You have a lot of
[33:45] Christians out there that if you can't
[33:47] scientifically prove something, they
[33:49] won't believe you, too. That's just the
[33:51] age we live in this morning. And that
[33:54] man can never be a Christian. He has to
[33:56] believe by
[33:57] faith. We believe God not by education,
[34:00] not by theology, but by faith. You are
[34:04] saved. Now, like brother Brandham said,
[34:06] your
[34:07] ABCs are always believe in Christ this
[34:10] morning. So to have that kind of faith
[34:13] this morning, uh my desire is that as
[34:17] that as we see the world get crazier, I
[34:19] want to get closer this morning as the
[34:22] world It's an important thing to me as
[34:24] you get older. I've said this before.
[34:27] You know, the things I thought were
[34:28] important 10, 15, 30 years ago, as I get
[34:32] older, they're not as important to me
[34:33] now as they were 20 years ago. But what
[34:37] should change is the importance of Jesus
[34:39] Christ in my heart and life this
[34:41] morning. Brother Josh
[34:59] may listen this morning. It's good to be
[35:01] here. Amen. Is it good to be
[35:05] here? Amen. I want to welcome everybody
[35:08] that's tuning in on the internet and
[35:10] welcome our visitors. I mean, Caleb,
[35:12] Sister Sharon, good to have you here
[35:14] this morning. Amen. Listen that song. I
[35:17] believe the true report. Hallelujah to
[35:19] the

[35:46] died. Hallelu to the

[36:27] of the blood. Oh, glory be to God by the
[36:32] spirit's power and life. I am living day

[37:20] God's light conceal. Oh, glory be to
[37:25] God. But the blood has brought me in to
[37:30] God's holiness so clean. Where there's

[39:09] I I see the
[39:12] blood. Oh, when
[39:16] I see the
[39:19] blood. When
[39:23] I see the
[39:26] blood, I will pass. I will pass over
[39:31] you.
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] Oh Christ, our
[39:37] redeemer died on the
[39:40] cross and died for the
[39:44] sinner. Paid all his
[39:47] due. Sprinkle your soul in the blood of
[39:53] the
[39:54] lamb and I will pass. I will pass over
[40:01] you. When
[40:04] I see the

[43:38] this morning. Amen. Listen to the great
[43:42] emancipator.
[43:43] Amen.
[43:45] Once my heart and soul were
[43:52] fed
[43:54] by the binding chains of
[44:00] sin. Oh,
[44:02] but the great
[44:09] emancipator
[44:10] set me free to worship
[44:16] him. Oh, glory,
[44:19] glory, glory, hallelujah.

[44:46] redeemed.
[44:50] And
[44:51] like a lost lamb, I was
[44:55] free. 15. I was
[44:59] all so helpless and
[45:05] alone. But the seeking shepherd
[45:11] found me, and he
[45:14] led me to my father's home.
[45:20] Oh, glory,
[45:23] glory, glory,
[45:25] [Music]
[45:29] hallelujah.
[45:30] Blessed be his holy
[45:36] name, for he's the great immanipator.
[45:42] [Applause]
[45:46] That's the song of the
[45:51] redeemed. Oh, glory,

[46:25] great emancipator this morning. Amen.
[46:28] You may have your seats this morning.
[46:29] And before we turn to prayer, can we
[46:30] just sing that song? I must tell Jesus
[46:33] all of my
[46:35] troubles. Amen. I must tell
[46:41] Jesus all of my
[46:47] trials. I cannot
[46:50] bear

[51:16] three fractured ribs. He's in a lot of
[51:18] pain. So, we want to pray for a touch

[53:53] Amen. So, let's all keep Brother Shan in
[53:57] your prayers because he is hurting real
[54:00] bad. He has three fractured
[54:02] ribs. So I uh I've rolled down that hill
[54:06] a couple of times, but I know how to do
[54:08] a parachute land and fall and he
[54:10] doesn't. So that's all there is to it.
[54:13] Okay. So I'm going to sing this little
[54:16] song because the Lord is getting ready
[54:19] to come see us. So we need to be ready
[54:21] for him.
[54:23] [Music]
[54:38] Be
[54:39] ready for he is coming soon.
[54:45] Once he came to this old world of sin
[54:50] and
[54:53] sorrow, a humble
[54:55] babe in a manger in
[55:00] [Music]
[55:01] Bethlehem, but this
[55:04] time he's coming in all his power.
[55:10] Great peace on earth will bow and
[55:14] worship his great
[55:18] name. Coming
[55:21] soon, Jesus and all his

[55:56] [Music]
[56:08] And when he
[56:10] comes, he'll bind the power of old
[56:15] Satan. The little children with the lamb
[56:20] and lion will
[56:23] play. And all the earth will be so
[56:28] filled with his grace and glory.
[56:33] No more crying for all if tears are
[56:37] wiped away.

[58:04] eye, he'll split the eastern sky. I
[58:09] believe he's coming back like he
[58:15] said. Oh, I believe he's coming back
[58:21] like he

[58:44] believe he's coming back like he
[58:51] said. Amen. Can we sing that song? I
[58:54] pledge allegiance to the lamb. And just
[58:57] the first verse maybe in a
[58:59] chorus. Do we have I have
[59:03] heard how
[59:06] Christians
[59:07] long
[59:09] ago were
[59:11] brought
[59:13] before a
[59:16] tent throne. They were told that he
[59:22] would
[59:23] spare their life if they would
[59:29] renounce the name of
[59:33] Christ. But one by
[59:37] one they chose to
[59:40] die, the son of God.
[59:45] They would not
[59:48] deny like a
[59:50] great
[59:52] angelic
[59:54] choir
[59:56] sings. I can almost
[1:00:00] hear their
[1:00:02] voicees ring. I
[1:00:06] pledge
[1:00:08] alceence to the
[1:00:11] lamb. With all my
[1:00:15] strength, with all I am, I will seek to

[1:00:28] pledge
[1:00:30] alce
[1:00:34] to the lamb to the lamb of God. Oh to

[1:00:41] God who bore my
[1:00:45] shame, who took my
[1:00:49] place and wore my pain. I will
[1:00:54] seek
[1:00:56] to his
[1:01:00] command. I
[1:01:02] pledge
[1:01:04] alance
[1:01:07] to the lamb. I pledge allegiance. Oh, I
[1:01:13] pledge
[1:01:15] alance to the
[1:01:18] land. With all my
[1:01:22] strength, with all I am, I will
[1:01:27] seek
[1:01:30] to his command.
[1:01:34] I
[1:01:35] pledge
[1:01:37] alce
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:40] to the
[1:01:44] lamb. Amen. Let the worshippers arise.

[1:02:17] worshippers

[1:02:32] I'm surrendering my
[1:02:38] all. I surrender to the
[1:02:46] king. And father, I see that you are
[1:02:50] drawing a line in the sand. And I want
[1:02:54] to be standing on your side, holding
[1:02:59] your hand. So let your kingom come. Let
[1:03:05] it live in me. This is my
[1:03:09] prayer and this is my plea. Let the
[1:03:14] worshippers

[1:03:21] sing.

[1:04:18] good, isn't he? Amen. We're looking
[1:04:20] forward to having Brother Joe Adams with
[1:04:22] us next weekend. Amen. And then I think
[1:04:25] uh there'll be one Sunday in between
[1:04:29] after that and then we'll have our
[1:04:30] meetings the following. Amen. So that's
[1:04:33] all coming up. Amen. Isn't it amazing
[1:04:36] how time flies? Amen. Next Thursday, I
[1:04:39] guess it'll be May already. I can't just
[1:04:41] uh remember a few short weeks ago I was
[1:04:43] like, "Oh boy, two more weeks and it'll
[1:04:45] be more first of March, you know, and so
[1:04:48] boy." But anyway, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:04:52] I hope everybody's doing good, feeling
[1:04:55] good. Amen. Hopefully some of this stuff
[1:04:58] that's been going around, Amen. can go
[1:05:00] by the wayside as far as I'm concerned.
[1:05:02] Amen. Praise the
[1:05:04] Lord.
[1:05:07] Amen. All right, let's just bow our
[1:05:09] heads and go before the Lord in prayer.
[1:05:12] Kind heavenly father, we do come before
[1:05:14] you again, Lord. Thankful on this side
[1:05:16] of glory, Lord, to be able to assemble
[1:05:18] ourselves together with your children,
[1:05:19] Lord, and to open the Bible, Father. And
[1:05:23] Lord, as I was listening yesterday to
[1:05:25] your prophet, how did he say anybody
[1:05:27] could open that and and and but you
[1:05:30] don't read the Bible just like a
[1:05:32] newspaper. It takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:05:34] open it up. And Father, I just pray,
[1:05:37] Lord, that you truly open it up to us
[1:05:39] this morning. Father, help us to get the
[1:05:40] understanding through the inspiration of
[1:05:43] the spirit, Lord Jesus. And Father, we
[1:05:45] ask God, the meditation of our heart,
[1:05:47] Lord Jesus, and that which we feel, God,
[1:05:49] you've laid upon a heart to minister
[1:05:50] this morning, Lord, that it would be
[1:05:52] just exactly what you want, Lord. And
[1:05:54] that you would have the preeminence in
[1:05:55] every portion of the service, Lord.
[1:05:57] Father, we do thank you, Lord, for all
[1:05:59] that you do for us. And we commit this
[1:06:01] service to you now in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:06:04] And amen. Amen. I was studying. And I
[1:06:07] was just beginning to pray, see what the
[1:06:08] Lord will have. And and I'm going to
[1:06:11] begin to kind of look at uh some of the
[1:06:13] things that we had spoke on last week.
[1:06:15] And I knew that I had left several pages
[1:06:18] out last week. Amen. Because Amen. Just
[1:06:22] because you got five pages don't mean
[1:06:23] you have to preach to five pages. Isn't
[1:06:25] that right? So I and I begin to just go
[1:06:29] down there and I just felt the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit kind of uh lead me into uh taking
[1:06:34] it up. Amen. some of the things I've
[1:06:36] left off. Amen. And go and see what the
[1:06:40] Lord will have for us. So, we're kind of
[1:06:42] kind of extending extending last week's
[1:06:45] service. Amen. But I do I am going to
[1:06:47] give it a uh a different title. Amen.
[1:06:51] And I want to talk about God's hospital.
[1:06:53] Amen. God's hospital with the help of
[1:06:56] the Lord. Amen. So, if you will turn
[1:06:59] your Bibles and we'll go uh back to
[1:07:03] Second Kings. I don't know if I read
[1:07:04] this last week or not. I may have. I
[1:07:06] don't remember. But I want to go to
[1:07:08] First
[1:07:13] Kings. Amen. I like that pen, brother
[1:07:16] Tommy. That's a nice pen. Amen. First
[1:07:19] Kings first
[1:07:20] chapter verse two. And
[1:07:25] Aziah fell through a lattice in his
[1:07:28] upper chamber that was in Samaria and
[1:07:31] was sick. And he sent messengers and
[1:07:34] sent unto them and said unto them, "Go
[1:07:37] inquire of Beelzebub, the God of Echron,
[1:07:39] whether I shall recover of this
[1:07:42] disease." But the angel of the Lord said
[1:07:44] to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go arise,
[1:07:47] arise, and go to to meet the messengers
[1:07:50] of the king of Samaria, and say unto
[1:07:53] them, Is it not because there is not a
[1:07:55] God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of
[1:07:59] Beelub, the God of Echron? And now
[1:08:02] therefore, thus saith the Lord, thou
[1:08:04] shalt not come down from that bed on
[1:08:06] which thou art gone up, but shall surely
[1:08:10] die." and Elijah departed. Let's go to
[1:08:14] Jeremiah if you would. Jeremiah
[1:08:28] 8, Jeremiah 8.
[1:08:43] In verse 20, it says, "The harvest is
[1:08:45] passed." Verse 20, "The harvest is
[1:08:48] passed. The summer is ended, and we are
[1:08:52] not saved. For the her of the daughter
[1:08:55] of my people and my hurt, I am black.
[1:08:58] Astonishment hath taken hold on me." Is
[1:09:00] there no bomb in Gide Gilead? Is there
[1:09:04] no physician there? Why then is not the
[1:09:07] health of the daughter of my people
[1:09:10] recovered? Amen. It's Matthew
[1:09:14] 9. St. Matthew the 9th
[1:09:35] chapter. Verse nine. And as Jesus passed
[1:09:38] forth from then, he saw a man named
[1:09:41] Matthew sitting at the receipt of
[1:09:43] custom, and he said unto him, "Follow
[1:09:45] me." And he arose and followed him. And
[1:09:48] it came to pass as Jesus sat at meat in
[1:09:50] the house, behold, many publicans and
[1:09:53] sinners came and sat down with him and
[1:09:55] his disciples. And when the And when the
[1:09:58] Pharisees saw it, they said unto his
[1:10:01] disciples, "Why eateth your master with
[1:10:04] publicans and
[1:10:06] sinners?" And when Jesus heard that, he
[1:10:09] said unto them, "They that behold need
[1:10:12] not a physician, but they that are sick.
[1:10:16] Go but go ye and learn what that meanth.
[1:10:18] I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For
[1:10:21] I am not come to call the righteous, but
[1:10:24] sinners to repentance." Amen. May God
[1:10:26] add his blessings through the reading of
[1:10:28] the word. You can be seated. Every each
[1:10:30] and every one of you probably know that
[1:10:32] I've certainly preached on this before,
[1:10:34] but this is just a direction that I feel
[1:10:36] led to go with the help of the Lord this
[1:10:38] morning for a while.
[1:10:39] Amen. Amen. And I was I was going to
[1:10:43] speak on on judgment on judgment. Amen.
[1:10:47] But uh the Lord seemed to have turned my
[1:10:50] thought a little bit on that. Amen. to
[1:10:53] titling it God's hospital. Amen. Praise
[1:10:56] the Lord. And I don't know if we'll do
[1:10:59] Wednesday, maybe on that other or not.
[1:11:01] Amen. So this morning's title will be
[1:11:04] Amen. God's
[1:11:06] um hospital. Amen. God's hospital. And
[1:11:09] maybe Wednesday we might be speak on
[1:11:12] God's courthouse. God's courthouse.
[1:11:14] Amen. So can we take our time this
[1:11:17] morning? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:19] Certainly enjoyed Wednesday, didn't
[1:11:21] that? Wasn't that a masterpiece? God
[1:11:23] really used brother Brad in a special
[1:11:25] way Wednesday night. Really enjoyed
[1:11:26] that. Amen. It's always good. Amen. When
[1:11:29] Amen. you see that anointing come down
[1:11:31] and just Amen. bring the word out in a
[1:11:33] way that you've really not seen it
[1:11:35] before. Amen. So, praise the
[1:11:38] Lord. So, how many knows we're living in
[1:11:41] a very sick world?
[1:11:45] Very, very sick world. Amen. And the re
[1:11:49] scriptures that we've read here uh of
[1:11:52] course we seen where
[1:11:55] Jesus pretty much you know expressed his
[1:11:59] purpose of coming.
[1:12:01] Amen. Not to help those that he said
[1:12:04] those that behold they don't need a
[1:12:06] physician
[1:12:07] because he's hanging around publicans.
[1:12:09] He was hanging around
[1:12:11] sinners. We know that his reputation was
[1:12:14] made by with tarots and thieves and
[1:12:17] ain't that right? Uh fishermen and you
[1:12:21] know his reputation was made by that.
[1:12:25] Amen. How many believe God is still the
[1:12:28] same as he always was? God is still in
[1:12:31] the healing business. He's still in the
[1:12:34] healing business. He is the great
[1:12:38] physician. Amen.
[1:12:41] Amen.
[1:12:43] Praise God for the great physician. We
[1:12:45] know that all healing comes from God.
[1:12:48] We know that there's not any kind of
[1:12:50] healing. The devil don't have any power
[1:12:52] to heal. No. No. There's philosophers
[1:12:55] and different ones wanted to claim that
[1:12:56] he could maybe, but you know, uh what
[1:12:59] was it? Even even with people people
[1:13:02] that were not even godly people, you
[1:13:04] know, uh you know that they would get
[1:13:07] healed through them, they'd say, "Well,
[1:13:09] what about that?" He says, "Well, there
[1:13:11] was their faith that did it." It was
[1:13:14] their faith that they'd be healed that
[1:13:15] did it. And then we can't come up here
[1:13:18] and get healed sometimes. When the
[1:13:20] preacher preaches, I mean, prays for us.
[1:13:22] Huh? How many believes it's your faith
[1:13:24] that does it? That's right. Amen. I if
[1:13:28] I'm not wrong, didn't he say the
[1:13:30] Beatles?
[1:13:32] Even the Beatles, people get healed by
[1:13:34] the Beatles. Thought he was some kind of
[1:13:36] a god.
[1:13:38] Certainly wasn't a god. It was, was it?
[1:13:40] No. But Amen. Not to confuse anybody. We
[1:13:44] know that even Jesus said, "Many will
[1:13:46] come that day say, haven't we healed the
[1:13:48] sick and raised the dead? Haven't we
[1:13:49] done all these mighty works?" And he
[1:13:52] said, "Well, yeah, you might have, but I
[1:13:54] never knew you."
[1:13:56] Amen.
[1:13:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. God is
[1:14:04] good. Amen. So, A Heziah, Amen. We
[1:14:09] realized that he had fallen through a
[1:14:11] lattice. Amen. And he had hurt himself
[1:14:13] and he wondered whether he was going to
[1:14:14] get better and he was one of uh he was
[1:14:18] he was uh king of Israel. Amen. He was
[1:14:22] king of Israel, but he was evil. and he
[1:14:25] went to find out and brother makes a
[1:14:29] statement. He says, you know, he says
[1:14:32] what a reproach upon a nation. What a
[1:14:35] reproach it is upon a nation today to
[1:14:38] find out that people sometimes who call
[1:14:40] themselves Christians will go to Ouija
[1:14:43] boards and spiritual meetings and all
[1:14:46] kinds of Tommy rot like that and
[1:14:48] fortunes and so forth, fortune tellings
[1:14:51] and things like that which is of the
[1:14:53] devil. He says, "Is there because
[1:14:56] there's no God in
[1:14:58] heaven? Is it because he doesn't have
[1:15:01] prophets in his
[1:15:03] church? Is it because they don't have
[1:15:06] gifts and revelations and
[1:15:07] interpretations in the church to consult
[1:15:10] God? Why would we have to go to such a
[1:15:13] low degraded thing as that?" Amen.
[1:15:17] Praise the Lord. We know that brother
[1:15:19] Bram used this message and this title,
[1:15:21] Amen, many times to preach on the
[1:15:23] message called
[1:15:24] why. Ain't that right?
[1:15:27] Why? And maybe we'll get into that
[1:15:29] Wednesday more. But we know that on the
[1:15:31] day of judgment, God is going to ask one
[1:15:33] of, you know, one of his main questions
[1:15:35] going to be why.
[1:15:39] I think we brought out last last week
[1:15:42] how that Jesus Christ went to Calvary to
[1:15:44] supply us with everything that we have
[1:15:47] need
[1:15:50] of. Brother Bam here he says, "I've
[1:15:53] always wondered why that the people will
[1:15:55] take a substitute for salvation when
[1:15:58] disguise are full of the real. Why would
[1:16:01] you eat out of a garbage can when there
[1:16:03] is a nice clean table sitting ready for
[1:16:06] you? Amen.
[1:16:09] How many know the devil offers
[1:16:11] substitutes?
[1:16:14] Amen. Many times, one place, Brother
[1:16:15] Bam, says, you know, you go to a doctor
[1:16:17] and he just, you know, your head's
[1:16:19] hurting or your stomach's hurting,
[1:16:21] something real bad, and you feel like
[1:16:22] there's something really wrong, and
[1:16:23] he'll just give you a couple Tylenol,
[1:16:25] say, "Here, take these. Go home and
[1:16:27] you'll be all right." He might just want
[1:16:29] to try to treat the symptoms, but he
[1:16:31] don't we don't need the symptoms, just
[1:16:35] treat it. How many know we need to do a
[1:16:38] little more investigating?
[1:16:40] We need a cure.
[1:16:42] We need a cure to the problem.
[1:16:47] Woo. Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:50] That's
[1:16:51] right.
[1:16:53] Well, when it's ready for it, it shows
[1:16:56] there's something mentally
[1:16:59] wrong. Something mentally wrong. That's
[1:17:02] what's matter with the nation today.
[1:17:04] people that'll refuse to receive Christ,
[1:17:06] the Holy Ghost in their hearts to walk
[1:17:09] and let him lead them like he did in the
[1:17:11] book of Acts. There's something wrong
[1:17:12] with that person mentally.
[1:17:16] Something mentally wrong. How many know
[1:17:18] we're living? But B said one he said one
[1:17:21] place he said the whole world will go
[1:17:22] completely insane.
[1:17:26] You and I have seen that.
[1:17:30] You have seen them absolutely say things
[1:17:34] and I don't like to get political but
[1:17:37] that's where we saw it. Our political
[1:17:40] system thought that we we we had such a
[1:17:43] millennium, brother Brad, that we could
[1:17:45] dismiss the police force.
[1:17:47] Now, Brother Brandham said that we
[1:17:49] could.
[1:17:53] He did say, you know, if everybody got
[1:17:55] the cure the way they ought to get the
[1:17:57] cure, you could dismiss the police
[1:18:00] force. Everybody would be
[1:18:03] nice. This red light up here, you could
[1:18:06] take it
[1:18:07] down. Why? Because everybody coming to
[1:18:09] the stop sign and when you come up at
[1:18:11] the same time, y'all would just be a
[1:18:16] Well, I don't want to say like a couple
[1:18:18] blondes say go and nobody ever goes, you
[1:18:21] know.
[1:18:23] But you'll be a little confusing. You'd
[1:18:25] be like, "Hey, you know, you go first.
[1:18:27] No, you go
[1:18:29] first." But instead, what we got is
[1:18:32] people taking off. Ain't that right? And
[1:18:35] the other person taking off. I was here
[1:18:37] first and I
[1:18:39] imag screaming out the window and
[1:18:42] everything else.
[1:18:45] Why? Because they haven't got the cure.
[1:18:48] How many believe God has the cure for
[1:18:52] every disease, for every sickness that
[1:18:54] there is? God has got the cure.
[1:19:03] Woo! Glory. My We couldn't go. Woo!
[1:19:08] Glory. Amen. Until after Calvary, until
[1:19:12] after the resurrection, until after the
[1:19:15] Holy Spirit come back. Because why? They
[1:19:17] didn't have the
[1:19:19] cure. No, they tried to serve God. They
[1:19:21] wanted to serve God, but they never
[1:19:23] could get that nature changed. They
[1:19:26] couldn't never get cured of their
[1:19:28] problem.
[1:19:34] Amen. I mean, that was Simon Peter had
[1:19:38] the cure. He had the medicine.
[1:19:42] Yes, he
[1:19:43] did. Amen. He was Dr. Peter. Amen. All
[1:19:51] right. Amen. But Baptist says it's like
[1:19:55] a man dying on the doctor's doorstep. I
[1:19:58] wrote up here, the world is dying at the
[1:20:01] great physician's doorstep.
[1:20:05] How many know the world is dying?
[1:20:09] Even Musk, I believe it, says the
[1:20:10] humanity, he said, is dying.
[1:20:17] Huh? Brother Bram said, "Civilization,
[1:20:20] politics, all of it. It's all at its
[1:20:23] end. Family, marriage at its end.
[1:20:27] Churchity at its end. Everything is
[1:20:30] coming to an its end."
[1:20:33] But aren't you glad that God promised a
[1:20:36] little restoration in the middle of it
[1:20:37] all? Amen. He's going to send a word to
[1:20:41] heal his people.
[1:20:47] Living in an insane institution, people
[1:20:50] are completely stuck raving mad. That's
[1:20:53] right. You ain't got to go to the mental
[1:20:54] hospital. You're in one.
[1:20:58] Mentally
[1:20:59] off. Anybody that hasn't got the Holy
[1:21:02] Ghost isn't mentally right.
[1:21:07] Didn't man say a man without the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost is a brute beast?
[1:21:11] the rash of rabbit a woman with a baby
[1:21:13] in her arm and everything else just a
[1:21:15] beast.
[1:21:17] Hello.
[1:21:21] Amen. Praise the
[1:21:23] Lord. Listen, when God has made a
[1:21:27] provision and then people refuse to walk
[1:21:30] in it, then he's going to ask why. So,
[1:21:33] we find out that it's like a man dying
[1:21:35] at the doorstep of a doctor because he
[1:21:38] won't take the medicine.
[1:21:41] The doctor has the
[1:21:42] prescription. He has the remedy for the
[1:21:45] disease that the man's got. But he sits
[1:21:48] on the doctor's doorstep and refuses to
[1:21:52] take his medicine. Then he dies on that
[1:21:56] doorstep. But it isn't the doctor that
[1:22:00] doesn't have the prescription. Oh, I
[1:22:02] like this. It isn't because there's no
[1:22:05] medicine for the sickness. is because
[1:22:08] the man's own stubbornness that refuses
[1:22:12] the doctor's medicine and he'll die. And
[1:22:15] so you cannot blame the medicine or the
[1:22:17] doctor because both was there and ready
[1:22:22] for service. How many believes Jesus is
[1:22:26] there? He's ready to heal when you get
[1:22:30] ready.
[1:22:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. When you get
[1:22:38] ready, God's
[1:22:41] ready. And I like this. See, God's got
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost tonight for every
[1:22:45] believer that wants to receive it. We've
[1:22:47] got anointed preachers. Is there another
[1:22:50] God in heaven? Brother B says, "Isn't
[1:22:52] there anointed preachers in the land
[1:22:54] that preaches it daily and nightly? Is
[1:22:57] it be Oh my. Yeah. It's their own
[1:23:00] people's own stubborn ways. They love
[1:23:03] darkness rather than light. Amen.
[1:23:08] Amen. It isn't because we ain't got a
[1:23:11] God. It ain't because we ain't got
[1:23:13] anointed preachers. It ain't because
[1:23:15] there ain't a doctor in the
[1:23:16] house. How many knows when you come to
[1:23:20] church, you're coming to a hospital.
[1:23:24] Amen.
[1:23:27] Amen. You're coming to a hospital.
[1:23:35] Should I say what comes to mind? It's
[1:23:38] amazing how much we stay away from the
[1:23:40] hospital when we're sick.
[1:23:44] Used they'd cut the roof open and let
[1:23:47] them in. You know, when they were about
[1:23:48] dying and sick, we've almost gotten
[1:23:51] afraid of sickness so much that when we
[1:23:53] get sick, we stay home. I'm not so sure
[1:23:56] that that's the right thing to
[1:23:58] do. Why? because the sick that came to
[1:24:01] him and healed the sick. Wouldn't it be
[1:24:03] something somebody come in to? I don't
[1:24:06] know. I'm just going to follow the
[1:24:07] leading of spirit. Is that all right?
[1:24:09] Amen. Somebody here somebody got co
[1:24:11] somebody's sick. Well, bring them on to
[1:24:13] church.
[1:24:19] And quit being so afraid.
[1:24:23] Maybe if we wouldn't be so afraid, we
[1:24:25] wouldn't get sick.
[1:24:28] We're afraid to touch
[1:24:30] him. Here we go.
[1:24:33] Brad, that's right. No, just fist bump
[1:24:37] me. Come on,
[1:24:38] people. Is that really the right thing
[1:24:44] or is it fear?
[1:24:50] Come on. That's right. Y'all getting
[1:24:53] quiet now.
[1:24:57] Amen. But that's Christ, isn't it? He
[1:25:00] heals the sick, raises the dead.
[1:25:04] He still does those same things.
[1:25:11] Amen. I was listening to brother
[1:25:13] Brandham yesterday. He was preaching
[1:25:17] on God doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:25:20] without warning him first. Remember
[1:25:22] that. You ought to listen to it. It's
[1:25:24] amazing. Brother Bam said in there he
[1:25:26] covered a lot of stuff but one thing he
[1:25:29] said he says man I he said I will take
[1:25:31] down this scripture and that scripture
[1:25:32] and that scripture and that scripture to
[1:25:34] preach and he says sometimes I don't
[1:25:36] even touch any of
[1:25:40] it. He said because when he gets up here
[1:25:43] he says he just gets he just he wants to
[1:25:45] be led by the spirit.
[1:25:48] Amen. So sometimes a preacher seem like
[1:25:51] he gets way off his subject off his
[1:25:53] topic. Don't be so sure. Amen. You get
[1:25:56] led by the spirit in in the direction
[1:25:59] that you go and the things that you
[1:26:01] say.
[1:26:05] Amen. But he said some things I really
[1:26:07] liked down towards the
[1:26:11] end. Amen. He was talking about talking
[1:26:14] to Mr. D
[1:26:18] au d a c. How do you pronounce that?
[1:26:21] Dao. Brother Dao, I guess he's a well
[1:26:24] known here in around the message or used
[1:26:26] to be. He was brought talking to brother
[1:26:28] Dao and and he asked me not long ago. He
[1:26:31] said, "Brother Bandom, I'm getting old
[1:26:33] and I'm getting weak, 91." He says, "Do
[1:26:37] you think I'm ready to
[1:26:39] die? Do you think I'm ready to go? Do
[1:26:42] you think I'm saved?" And I said, "Mr.
[1:26:45] Dao, did you ever go to a doctor for a
[1:26:49] physical checkup?
[1:26:52] Amen. That's good, ain't it? So, some of
[1:26:56] us getting older, I don't care how old
[1:26:58] you are, young or whatever, you always
[1:27:01] want to be ready for die to die.
[1:27:04] Amen. You want to make sure that you
[1:27:05] are. And he asked Brother Bam, "Do you
[1:27:07] think I'm ready to die?" Brother Bam
[1:27:09] says, "All
[1:27:11] right." He said, "Uh, yeah, I have." He
[1:27:15] said, "And you tell him now when the
[1:27:17] doctor," what the doctor does is he's he
[1:27:20] gets his book laying
[1:27:25] there and he'll take that book and he
[1:27:28] finds
[1:27:31] out. He looks at the
[1:27:37] thing. The first thing that he ought to
[1:27:39] that that he does is he checks his
[1:27:42] heart. So he gets a stethoscope and puts
[1:27:46] it in his ear and checks his
[1:27:51] heart. Ain't that about
[1:27:54] right? I guess me and my wife, we've
[1:27:56] been doctorred last lately, we've been
[1:27:58] doctoring more than we ever have been in
[1:28:01] our life all put
[1:28:03] together. No matter every time, almost
[1:28:06] every time that she comes in
[1:28:08] there, Amen. They'll check her
[1:28:12] weight. We'll might as well be
[1:28:17] honest. And she'll hand me the purse
[1:28:20] here. We don't want to have that on
[1:28:21] there. I take about 40 lbs off her right
[1:28:27] [Laughter]
[1:28:29] there. And next they'll put something
[1:28:33] around her arm. Is that right? They'll
[1:28:36] check her blood
[1:28:37] pressure. see if that blood pressure.
[1:28:40] They'll put a little pulse thing on her
[1:28:43] finger to check her
[1:28:46] pulse. Checking her
[1:28:49] vitals. How many believes it's checking
[1:28:51] up time?
[1:28:53] I believe that it's time for the church
[1:28:56] to check up.
[1:28:58] Come on. We have passed so many
[1:29:00] milestones of a woman in purple already
[1:29:04] that's messed everything up. Brother Bam
[1:29:06] said the net thing he thought was a fire
[1:29:08] coming. I read where brother Bam says
[1:29:11] and all of the destruction of the world
[1:29:13] is already in the
[1:29:15] hangers. That fire is already in the
[1:29:18] hangers. He said all it's going to take
[1:29:21] is one
[1:29:22] person. It's just going to take the
[1:29:24] right time. I'm going to say is that
[1:29:26] right? When one of he says one of them
[1:29:29] gets on the radar they all go off. And
[1:29:31] he says, "Man, them some of them things
[1:29:33] will blow a hole 150 ft deep and go out
[1:29:37] there 150 miles."
[1:29:41] He says, "Completely fulfilling the
[1:29:44] scriptures."
[1:29:52] Amen. My So he says, "That's right." But
[1:29:55] brother Bam said a stethoscope to check
[1:29:58] the heart.
[1:30:01] Check the blood
[1:30:03] pressure. Make sure your blood pressure
[1:30:05] is not too high or not too
[1:30:10] low. Now, I've got several things
[1:30:14] here wrote down.
[1:30:29] Hebrews 4. Hebrews
[1:30:35] 4. And as you go into a doctor's office,
[1:30:38] many times, especially if you are, let's
[1:30:40] say you're going to have a complete
[1:30:42] physical examination or something like
[1:30:44] that, sometimes the uh the doctor will
[1:30:47] make you get into a gown or or or they
[1:30:49] they make you they may get you to strip
[1:30:52] down completely naked. Isn't that right?
[1:30:58] And I thought, you know, this position
[1:31:00] that we have when we come to before the
[1:31:01] house of God, we come naked before him.
[1:31:06] There's nothing about us that's hid.
[1:31:11] It says the word of God is quick and
[1:31:13] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:31:16] sword, piercing even to dividing a
[1:31:18] sunder of soul and spirit and of the
[1:31:20] joints and marrow, and is a discerner of
[1:31:22] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[1:31:25] So when God goes, he goes deep.
[1:31:29] Amen.
[1:31:31] God's got like a CAT scan.
[1:31:34] They've got CAT scans at the hospital.
[1:31:36] They've got EKGs. They've got MRIs.
[1:31:39] They've got all kinds of machines
[1:31:41] that'll look all the way through your
[1:31:43] body.
[1:31:46] If there's anything anywhere in there,
[1:31:48] they'll tell you, "Hey, that shouldn't
[1:31:50] be there and that shouldn't be there."
[1:31:52] How many know that's the way God does
[1:31:54] when we come to the house of God?
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:58] How many come to the house of God to get
[1:32:00] examined?
[1:32:02] When we come to church, we come to get
[1:32:04] examined.
[1:32:05] Paul said, "Examine yourself. See
[1:32:07] whether you be in the faith or not."
[1:32:09] Don't you know yourselves?
[1:32:12] Amen. How that Christ dwells in you,
[1:32:15] least you be a reprobate. In other
[1:32:17] words, make sure the Holy Ghost is in
[1:32:19] there or you're irrepate.
[1:32:24] Examine ourselves. Another place he said
[1:32:26] about examine ourselves. Amen. He says,
[1:32:29] you know, over in there in the where the
[1:32:31] the uh communion scriptures, examine
[1:32:35] yourselves. Judge yourselves that you be
[1:32:37] not judged. Ain't that right? Judge
[1:32:41] yourselves. Amen. Now
[1:32:43] notice over in
[1:32:46] Job, we find out that
[1:32:48] Job 1 and verse 66 says, "Now there was
[1:32:52] a day when the sons of God came to
[1:32:54] present themselves before the Lord." How
[1:32:57] many believe that's what we do when we
[1:32:58] come to the house of God chapter 2 was
[1:33:01] the same verse one again. There was a
[1:33:04] day when the sons of God came to present
[1:33:05] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[1:33:07] came
[1:33:08] also. Amen.
[1:33:11] So when we come to the house of God,
[1:33:13] when we come to this doctrine, you got
[1:33:14] to be willing to bear yourself so to
[1:33:17] speak. Here I am, Lord.
[1:33:21] See if there any be any wicked way in
[1:33:23] me.
[1:33:27] Amen. Because remember Dr. Dao was
[1:33:29] asking him, "I'm ready to die." But
[1:33:32] Abraham says, "Well, we're going to have
[1:33:34] to bring the skithcope out, find out.
[1:33:37] We're going to have
[1:33:38] to He said, Brother Brandham said it may
[1:33:41] be a urine
[1:33:42] test. They'll take a urine test. You
[1:33:44] know how much they can tell by your
[1:33:47] urine? A whole
[1:33:49] lot. Amen. But mostly a blood test.
[1:33:55] Mostly a blood test. Let me finish my
[1:33:57] scripture
[1:33:58] here. Amen. The intents of the heart.
[1:34:01] Neither is there any creature that is
[1:34:04] not manifest in his sight. But all
[1:34:06] things are naked and open unto the eyes
[1:34:10] of him which we have to
[1:34:12] do. How many know you don't keep a
[1:34:16] secret from God?
[1:34:18] God knows all about you.
[1:34:26] Ain't that right? That's right. Brother
[1:34:28] Brandham, man, when he was here, he he
[1:34:31] tap God would come and use him in such a
[1:34:33] way that'd be preachers maybe on the
[1:34:36] platform or whatever or even in the
[1:34:38] congregation and they would think it's
[1:34:40] telepathy. He says, "No, it's not
[1:34:43] telepathy. Stop thinking that."
[1:34:47] Ain't that right? He could tell them
[1:34:49] what they were thinking.
[1:34:52] Goes all the way
[1:34:54] deep. Amen.
[1:34:56] Aren't you glad that we've had a prophet
[1:34:58] like that? We've had the Messiah sign
[1:35:01] come in this generation.
[1:35:08] Woo. How many believe that God came and
[1:35:10] gave us the medicine that we needed in
[1:35:12] this generation? Amen. To get out of
[1:35:15] here to be
[1:35:18] healthy, to be
[1:35:20] happy. But sometimes we've got to
[1:35:22] examine ourselves. And that's what we
[1:35:24] want to do this morning. examine
[1:35:27] ourselves.
[1:35:29] Amen. So, it's all
[1:35:31] naked before
[1:35:33] him. Amen. Now, notice the next thing he
[1:35:38] does, he gets his blood pressure thing
[1:35:41] out. Amen. Puts pressure on his arm.
[1:35:45] Then a urine specimen perhaps or sample
[1:35:47] and what more? And some blood out of him
[1:35:50] and all these different things. Goes all
[1:35:52] through it. If he can't find nothing,
[1:35:56] takes an X-ray. If he can't find
[1:35:58] nothing, he'll say, "Mr. Dou, you're
[1:36:01] physically all
[1:36:03] right." Amen. See, what's he basing it
[1:36:06] upon? On the conditions out of the
[1:36:09] medical
[1:36:11] book, that if there's anything wrong
[1:36:15] according to the head scientist, it'll
[1:36:18] show up there. It'll do this here. It'll
[1:36:20] do that there. Whatever. as far as he
[1:36:23] can tell anything about it. You're all
[1:36:25] right. See, physically, just one one
[1:36:28] Monday, I believe it was, Donna and I
[1:36:30] went back to read her uh blood work to
[1:36:33] see what her blood work was like. Amen.
[1:36:35] How many knows when you cancer your
[1:36:37] blood blood red cells and white cells
[1:36:40] and and your cholesterol
[1:36:43] level, all kinds of things. And I asked
[1:36:45] her this morning, "Honey, what was some
[1:36:46] of them things that he said that uh you
[1:36:49] know was in your blood that this was all
[1:36:52] right?" And he she says, "Well, I don't
[1:36:53] remember." And I'm like, "Well, I always
[1:36:54] wanted to preach on it this morning."
[1:36:57] But I'm not a nurse like Brother Brad
[1:37:01] and some of them in here, so they they
[1:37:02] could probably do this better than I.
[1:37:04] But one of the things was, and you know
[1:37:06] what the good part was? He says, "Your
[1:37:09] cholesterol still a little high at 150.
[1:37:12] It was there 180 and now it's on 150."
[1:37:14] and and and by the time Tommy knows it
[1:37:17] ain't fun no taking no blood pressure
[1:37:19] medicine, cholesterol pills and blood
[1:37:21] pressure medicine stuff. Amen. And so
[1:37:25] but it was went from 180 to 150. I says
[1:37:27] it's coming down. So and all of the
[1:37:30] other things, everything else in your
[1:37:33] blood looks good. I'll be glad to hear
[1:37:36] that. Looks good. Glory. Thank you,
[1:37:41] Jesus. Amen. Ain't that what we want our
[1:37:44] doctor to tell us this morning? Look,
[1:37:46] everything in your life, it's looking
[1:37:49] good.
[1:37:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:56] Amen. A lot of times, another thing they
[1:37:59] do is take your temperature. Is that
[1:38:02] right? See what your temperature is
[1:38:05] like. They might put your hand their
[1:38:07] hand on your forehead. You ever had
[1:38:09] anybody that had a fever and their
[1:38:11] forehead's cold or hot? one or the other
[1:38:15] cold. How many knows whenever a person
[1:38:18] comes into the hospital, a lot of times
[1:38:20] they'll be pale and
[1:38:23] sick. How many knows you trying to kind
[1:38:26] of change when you get sick? You don't
[1:38:28] look as good as you did before your
[1:38:30] face. Amen. You're just under duress
[1:38:32] perhaps and may turn white or whatever.
[1:38:34] If you're really sick, it really shows.
[1:38:38] Amen. So don't so don't come to the
[1:38:40] house of God with a frown.
[1:38:43] All sick looking. Come with a smile. We
[1:38:46] want to come healthy. Ain't that right?
[1:38:48] But if you're not, then you're in the
[1:38:51] right place.
[1:38:52] How many believe that? You don't have to
[1:38:55] stay sick. You don't have to stay cold.
[1:38:59] Amen. Brother Brandham had a way of
[1:39:00] diagnosing a a a a a church. Sometimes
[1:39:04] you go into some of these churches and
[1:39:06] man it is cold in there. You can preach
[1:39:10] your heart out all you want to and
[1:39:11] everybody
[1:39:15] just huh. He said a woman in the back or
[1:39:18] somebody scream maybe or something. You
[1:39:21] know they might be a little hot. Now how
[1:39:24] many knows God wants you hot?
[1:39:26] He don't want you cold. He don't want
[1:39:29] you lukewarm. He wants us hot this
[1:39:31] morning. So if you're hot, then you're
[1:39:34] might be doing all
[1:39:38] right. But if amens and hallelujah and
[1:39:41] screams and shoutings and all of that,
[1:39:44] if that bothers you, hello, makes cold
[1:39:48] shivers run down your spine, what better
[1:39:51] say, when you get over there, you're
[1:39:52] going to freeze to death cuz there's
[1:39:55] going to be a whole lot of that going
[1:39:56] over there. And I ain't waiting till I
[1:39:59] get over there. I'm doing it here.
[1:40:00] Aren't you? That's right. I'm going to
[1:40:03] praise God a little bit. He's healed me.
[1:40:06] He has saved me from my sin. He's healed
[1:40:08] me from my sickness. Why shouldn't I
[1:40:10] praise him?
[1:40:14] Amen.
[1:40:17] I haven't been to a lot of message
[1:40:18] churches, but from what I understand,
[1:40:20] some of them it can be pretty cold.
[1:40:22] Everybody sits there and they've heard
[1:40:24] it
[1:40:26] before. They've heard it before. They're
[1:40:30] sitting there waiting for you to tell
[1:40:31] them some new thing.
[1:40:35] Amen.
[1:40:37] Amen. But you know, I'll get into it
[1:40:40] Wednesday. The story of the little
[1:40:42] wagon. Amen. And the fire on the
[1:40:46] prairie. Ain't that
[1:40:47] right? Next day, next Sunday or the
[1:40:50] Sunday before uh our service, I think
[1:40:52] it's Mother's Day. Ain't that right? I'm
[1:40:55] already thinking of what I'm going to
[1:40:56] preach on Mother's Day. and stories to
[1:40:59] me that just don't get old.
[1:41:03] Huh? Tell me the story of Jesus again.
[1:41:06] Tell me about Calvary
[1:41:08] again. Tell me of how he paid for my
[1:41:11] sin. Tell me of how that he took my
[1:41:16] judgment. Tell me of how much he loved
[1:41:19] me so much that he ran into the
[1:41:22] fire and saved me.
[1:41:27] That's right. Glory.
[1:41:33] You know what y'all sound like this
[1:41:34] morning? Y'all sound like a bunch of
[1:41:39] trees that have leaves on them and the
[1:41:42] wind's blowing and all of the leaves are
[1:41:44] clapping their
[1:41:47] hand. There's some life in that
[1:41:50] tree. They're not dead. Amen. And I want
[1:41:53] to tell you, they got some life in them.
[1:41:56] They're not dead. This church ain't
[1:41:57] dead. It's alive.
[1:42:03] Amen. Wherever Christ is, there's always
[1:42:06] noise.
[1:42:08] Oh, there's times of peace, but there's
[1:42:10] also times of noise.
[1:42:13] Amen. Why? Because where Christ is,
[1:42:16] there's life.
[1:42:22] I don't care if I do get 90 years old
[1:42:25] and I have got the up here like
[1:42:28] that. I hope that the Holy Ghost gets a
[1:42:30] hold of me like he did that preacher
[1:42:33] that
[1:42:34] 90. You ain't got enough room up here
[1:42:37] for me to preach.
[1:42:44] You might be about dead. You might get
[1:42:46] backsliden away from God, but just keep
[1:42:48] eating food. Keep going to church. Amen.
[1:42:50] And I'm trying to tell you, your youth
[1:42:53] will renew
[1:42:55] itself.
[1:42:57] Woo. It'll renew
[1:43:00] itself. This is some renewing juice
[1:43:02] right here. Amen. But we need to get a
[1:43:05] good injection. Don't go my
[1:43:13] Uhoh. I'm getting too many pills,
[1:43:15] brother Brad. I've been taking too many
[1:43:17] of them
[1:43:20] pills. Don't you love them go
[1:43:23] pills? They do something for you. That's
[1:43:26] right. What we need is some more
[1:43:28] gospels. Some go pills. We need people
[1:43:31] to take some gospels. It'll make you
[1:43:33] feel better.
[1:43:48] That's
[1:43:53] right.
[1:43:56] Amen. I've never taken
[1:43:58] opium. Ain't that right?
[1:44:01] But I understand they they make it so
[1:44:04] that when you're having surgery and you
[1:44:06] got cut on and you're hurting like the
[1:44:08] Dickens, the Dickens is okay, right?
[1:44:12] You're really
[1:44:14] hurting. They'll give you a pill. It'll
[1:44:18] have some opium that came from a lily
[1:44:21] that was crushed. Isn't that right? It's
[1:44:24] where it comes from from understand
[1:44:27] it. I remember I'm going to tell it
[1:44:29] again. I remember my wife's heart was
[1:44:32] hurting. It was hurting for some reason.
[1:44:34] He had a murmur or something in it. They
[1:44:36] went to the doctor and they gave her a
[1:44:37] couple of somethings. And we come home
[1:44:39] and I said, "Yeah, I am just
[1:44:44] fine." She was feeling fine. It may have
[1:44:48] just been a treating the symptoms, but
[1:44:52] she wasn't hurting none, I'm here to
[1:44:54] tell you. But I want to tell you this
[1:44:56] morning, I've never taken that that I
[1:44:59] know of. But I do have, Amen. that great
[1:45:02] awesome that opium that comes from that
[1:45:05] crushed lily. And he's the lily of the
[1:45:08] valley that was crushed on Calvary. And
[1:45:11] when you take of that, I'm going to tell
[1:45:13] you, he's got the remedy for your blues.
[1:45:18] You got the blues and you're
[1:45:19] downhearted, he's got something for you
[1:45:21] in here. Amen.
[1:45:25] Amen. I thank God for his medicine
[1:45:27] cabinet. I mean, God has a medicine
[1:45:33] cabinet.
[1:45:36] Amen. That's right.
[1:45:43] Now, he checks your
[1:45:46] pulse. That right? Making sure that your
[1:45:49] heart boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[1:45:55] boom that it's beating just the way that
[1:45:58] it should.
[1:46:00] Amen. How we may know is that we need
[1:46:03] our heart to beat to the rhythm of the
[1:46:07] word.
[1:46:09] Amen. Acts 2:38. Yes. Amen. Is amen.
[1:46:14] Preacher says that's the way to get it
[1:46:15] is Acts 238.
[1:46:18] By one spirit are we all baptized into
[1:46:20] one body. Give me some rhythm. Amen.
[1:46:23] Amen. Let our hearts beat to the rhythm
[1:46:26] of the gospel.
[1:46:30] Amen. Praise the
[1:46:33] Lord. Check your blood
[1:46:35] pressure. I don't know under I'm not a
[1:46:37] doctor, but it's so that that pressure
[1:46:40] is flowing through there real good.
[1:46:42] Brother John, he went to the doctor.
[1:46:45] Heart hurting.
[1:46:46] You know, right? I want to get mine
[1:46:49] checked. I need to get I keep saying
[1:46:50] that. Keep saying I need to get it
[1:46:51] checked. I need to go to the doctor. I I
[1:46:54] really do need to go to the
[1:46:56] doctor. Just need to do it instead of
[1:46:59] talking about
[1:47:02] it. But what happens? There's something
[1:47:05] not right. My heart's hurting. That
[1:47:08] right? Go to the doctor and what do they
[1:47:10] do? They shoot you with some
[1:47:13] dye. Is that right? And they want to go
[1:47:16] all through there and they chase chase
[1:47:18] that down. I guess you said you watched
[1:47:20] it go to those different places and they
[1:47:23] tell you what percentage and how much of
[1:47:25] your arteries are
[1:47:27] blocked or how much h how far they're
[1:47:31] blocked. And one thing you don't want is
[1:47:34] your arteries to block. How many believe
[1:47:36] that we need so important that you have
[1:47:40] good blood flow? Amen. Good blood flow.
[1:47:46] Amen. We're sitting there at the
[1:47:47] doctor's office and they're telling you
[1:47:49] all these different things to do. He
[1:47:51] says, "And it and it comes on the screen
[1:47:53] and he says, you know, try running a
[1:47:55] little bit. Try running a little." Okay.
[1:47:58] Well, that's I do that. I did that this
[1:48:00] morning. Went and ran a little
[1:48:02] bit to get your blood flowing. And if
[1:48:06] you can't run, it says try walking fast.
[1:48:09] Do something, but get some exercise.
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:16] Amen. Cuz they want to do they know that
[1:48:19] you need to get your heart pumping. It
[1:48:20] needs to flow cuz it is has a cleansing
[1:48:24] effect. When that blood's flowing, it
[1:48:26] does a lot of things. It gets a lot of
[1:48:28] cures. It keeps you clean and stuff.
[1:48:33] Amen.
[1:48:36] And boy, it's the devil's job to try to
[1:48:39] bring
[1:48:40] blockages in your life, in your walk
[1:48:43] with God. He wants to block. Amen. In
[1:48:46] warfare, what did they do? They cut off
[1:48:48] the supply line. Then you're going to be
[1:48:51] defeated. And if you get that supply
[1:48:53] line cut off to your heart, you're going
[1:48:56] to die. It's important. Amen. That we
[1:48:59] have flow through me, Holy Spirit. Flow
[1:49:02] through me. flow through me, Lord. How
[1:49:05] many believe we need a good flowing of
[1:49:08] the Holy Ghost in the
[1:49:11] church, then you'll have a healthy
[1:49:14] church. If you got good blood flow,
[1:49:20] Amen. He has a way of looking to see how
[1:49:23] much that Holy Spirit's flowing through
[1:49:25] you. The devil will do anything to block
[1:49:28] that. Amen. To block it. Amen.
[1:49:34] Oh
[1:49:39] my. All
[1:49:41] right. Blood test. Blood test is to test
[1:49:45] all different aspects whether your iron
[1:49:47] is where it's supposed to be. Ain't that
[1:49:53] right? And one thing
[1:49:56] is, let me just ask you this. What's the
[1:49:59] most important thing for you to have a
[1:50:03] good report on your blood
[1:50:07] test? It's your
[1:50:10] diet hardly any any time. But that
[1:50:13] doctor will ask you what you eat and you
[1:50:15] need to eat more fiber. You need to eat
[1:50:17] this and less bad cholesterol, more good
[1:50:20] cholesterol. Eat more fish. You know
[1:50:22] that cholesterol is good. But that beef
[1:50:24] fat that you fry up, maybe that's not
[1:50:26] just the best for you. Good cholesterol,
[1:50:29] bad cholesterol. But the diet, how many
[1:50:31] beliefs are a good healthy
[1:50:33] Christian, your diet is so important
[1:50:37] people? How many believes even brother
[1:50:40] Bam said he said if you want to get
[1:50:41] closer to God, read more, feed more, eat
[1:50:45] right.
[1:50:47] What we eat daily, what we eat every
[1:50:49] hour,
[1:50:51] daily, our daily habit, those
[1:50:54] habits, isn't that right? A good eating
[1:50:57] habit is one of the best things you can
[1:51:01] have. And that is spiritually speaking.
[1:51:05] Amen.
[1:51:07] Keep your mind on him. Blessed be he
[1:51:10] whose mind is on
[1:51:12] thee. Amen.
[1:51:15] Praise the
[1:51:17] Lord. But like I said, sometimes we need
[1:51:20] the Holy Spirit to go right down into
[1:51:21] our
[1:51:24] arteries. Go right up there and find out
[1:51:27] what is
[1:51:28] it. What's causing the
[1:51:31] blockage? How many would say this
[1:51:33] morning, I want to know what's keeping
[1:51:34] me from being well?
[1:51:38] Lord, show me.
[1:51:40] Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no
[1:51:43] physician there?
[1:51:46] Then he asked why then the answer must
[1:51:49] have been yeah must have been yeah there
[1:51:52] is a physician there we've got a
[1:51:54] physician in the house there's a doctor
[1:51:57] in the
[1:51:59] house I'm glad that when you go to this
[1:52:02] emergency room you don't have to wait
[1:52:04] for half a day. Isn't that frustrating?
[1:52:07] Hey, this is an emergency. I'm supposed
[1:52:09] to get waited on. But they put you in
[1:52:11] the back of the line. Folks, if you
[1:52:14] aren't in about dead, they're not going
[1:52:16] to take you first. They're going to put
[1:52:17] you in a long line, long waiting line.
[1:52:19] But God don't do that. When you come to
[1:52:22] him, say, "God, I need rejuvenation. I
[1:52:25] need to have some attention, Lord." He
[1:52:27] is there for you.
[1:52:30] That's what he come for.
[1:52:34] Amen. Praise the
[1:52:36] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:52:41] That's right. Brother Abraham says,
[1:52:43] "Well,
[1:52:44] you he said if you love God, if you've
[1:52:49] got the Holy Ghost, we can't hardly wait
[1:52:52] to get to church. Can't wait for them
[1:52:55] doors to open.
[1:52:57] Why? You got to check that heart. Where
[1:53:00] your heart is, where your treasure is,
[1:53:03] that's where your heart will be." How
[1:53:06] many believe we need to have a heart
[1:53:07] test? See where our heart's at. See
[1:53:09] where our love is. See what we love. See
[1:53:12] what we thirst for, long for. What's our
[1:53:16] passion?
[1:53:18] Amen.
[1:53:21] Hallelujah. God is good, isn't he?
[1:53:28] See, God's going to ask on the day
[1:53:29] judgment, why didn't you receive the
[1:53:30] Holy Ghost? Why wasn't you born of the
[1:53:33] spirit?
[1:53:35] Why was you the way that you are when
[1:53:37] God has provided everything that we have
[1:53:39] need of humanity? Isn't it something
[1:53:43] that
[1:53:43] humanity whosoever will let him come and
[1:53:47] drink of the fountain of life? The bride
[1:53:48] and the spirit say come. Ain't that
[1:53:51] right? All of it. Come and drink. Come
[1:53:53] and get it. But they refuse to get
[1:53:58] it. It burns me up, brother Tommy. Burns
[1:54:02] us up. That's why you go to prison. You
[1:54:03] can do what you can. say, "Don't you
[1:54:05] people realize that you can have joy
[1:54:08] unspeakable? You can have peace in your
[1:54:11] heart. You can be washed. You can you
[1:54:14] you can be healed
[1:54:17] of your
[1:54:18] sickness, of carnality,
[1:54:22] of the lusts of the
[1:54:23] flesh, cuz it'll cure."
[1:54:27] How many believe the the Holy Ghost is
[1:54:30] the cure?
[1:54:32] The Holy Spirit is the cure. Not mental
[1:54:35] philosophy, but the Holy Ghost is the
[1:54:39] cure. Brother Bram say that they're in
[1:54:41] the upper room waiting for that
[1:54:43] prescription to come down, waiting for
[1:54:45] that medicine to come down, waiting.
[1:54:50] Amen.
[1:54:52] I don't know about you, but sometimes
[1:54:54] when I go to the
[1:54:55] doctor, I don't want him to give me a
[1:54:57] pill.
[1:54:59] Why? Because that has to go into your
[1:55:02] stomach and then it has to work out
[1:55:03] through your
[1:55:04] bloodstream. There you go, doctor.
[1:55:06] There's a good vein right there. Ain't
[1:55:09] that
[1:55:11] right? Give me an
[1:55:15] injection. Right. Straight to the
[1:55:17] bloodstream.
[1:55:18] Is that right? That's what they do most
[1:55:21] of the time. Go straight to the
[1:55:22] bloodstream.
[1:55:27] Inject me with the cure.
[1:55:31] Amen.
[1:55:33] I'll go into this for just a few
[1:55:34] minutes, but we know that brother Bam
[1:55:36] says in medicine in in the medicine
[1:55:37] world. You know before penicellin even
[1:55:40] came into existence they had to find
[1:55:43] where to get that and how to get it and
[1:55:44] how how many people's lives it saves now
[1:55:48] and how many antibiotics how many left
[1:55:50] for antibiotics and the antibiotics that
[1:55:52] help you and all of that has to be you
[1:55:54] know and first before they test it and
[1:55:56] they might get a mouse or a rat and
[1:55:58] they'll test it on a guinea pig so to
[1:56:00] speak to make sure it works on them and
[1:56:02] then they'll get real brave and get some
[1:56:05] volunteers and you'll have to sign hey
[1:56:06] if you drop dead you can't sue
[1:56:09] You ain't going to sue him anyway if
[1:56:10] you're dead, but you know your
[1:56:14] family. That's right. And then all of a
[1:56:16] sudden, yeah, it works. Yeah, it
[1:56:18] works. How many knows that when John saw
[1:56:21] the spirit descending like a a dove from
[1:56:24] heaven, come upon Christ.
[1:56:27] Amen. Jesus was being injected with God
[1:56:30] himself, with the spirit.
[1:56:34] Hello. And the devil took him out on a
[1:56:37] mountain. Is that right? He went up on a
[1:56:38] mountain to be tempted of the devil.
[1:56:41] Woo! How many knows that inoculation
[1:56:43] held? It worked. When he came to Legion,
[1:56:47] and the legion of devils, thousands of
[1:56:50] them, I'm telling you now, it worked. It
[1:56:52] cured Legion. The woman at the well, it
[1:56:55] cured her. The woman that touched the
[1:56:58] hem of his garment, it cured her.
[1:57:01] When he came and laid his hands on that
[1:57:03] epileptic child that the the disciples
[1:57:06] couldn't even heal, couldn't even cast
[1:57:07] him out. When he spoke to him, what
[1:57:10] happened? He was healed.
[1:57:14] When it come to going to dying to
[1:57:16] himself, the greatest battle that he
[1:57:18] ever fought was in the garden of
[1:57:20] Gethsemane. Am I going to go through
[1:57:23] this or am I
[1:57:27] not? Huh? Will I call for those legions
[1:57:30] of angels? He said, if it's possible,
[1:57:33] father, it was rough on him in his
[1:57:36] flesh. If it's possible, let the pass
[1:57:38] from maybe. But nevertheless, not my
[1:57:41] will. It held. That inoculation held
[1:57:46] and he went to Calvary, took the
[1:57:48] stripes, was put to
[1:57:51] death, and it raised him back up
[1:57:55] again. Hallelujah. It works. How many is
[1:57:59] counting on that for you and if he raise
[1:58:02] you raise with
[1:58:06] him? Amen. And he said, "You go to city
[1:58:10] of Jerusalem until you get the
[1:58:13] inoculation. You wait there. Cuz if you
[1:58:17] don't, Peter, you're still going to want
[1:58:20] to cut people's ears off. Huh?
[1:58:24] All you other disciples, you're forsake
[1:58:26] me cuz you need something more than what
[1:58:29] you got. How many knows? And that's for
[1:58:31] the churchgoer, young people, you got to
[1:58:34] have more than your mama's experience,
[1:58:35] daddy's experience, or a mental
[1:58:37] conception. You got to have the baptism
[1:58:39] of the Holy Ghost on the inside.
[1:58:45] Woo! That's right.
[1:58:48] They were up there, from what I
[1:58:49] understand, scared, worried that they're
[1:58:51] going to come after them and crucify
[1:58:53] them like they did their Lord. They were
[1:58:55] up there hiding and their doors locked,
[1:58:57] waiting on the promise. But when that
[1:58:58] promise come, Amen. And the pillar of
[1:59:00] fire come down and divided himself.
[1:59:03] Would to God that it happened this
[1:59:05] morning that that pillar of fire would
[1:59:07] divide himself a little bit here. Amen.
[1:59:09] And the people begin to speak with
[1:59:11] another
[1:59:14] tongue. Woo. That's right. Appalachian
[1:59:17] coming down said, "Where's that devil
[1:59:19] at?" Peter came out of the upper room.
[1:59:21] Sing, "Where you at? We ain't scared no
[1:59:25] more."
[1:59:28] Woo! Glory. Went out there and preached
[1:59:30] the gospel. Amen. Spreading the gospel.
[1:59:33] Spread the fire. Amen. When you took
[1:59:36] their post, they were hot. They were on
[1:59:39] fire for God.
[1:59:43] Amen.
[1:59:48] Amen. He got out there and
[1:59:52] preached told him how to just Lord whom
[1:59:56] you've crucified.
[1:59:58] God has made him both Lord and Christ.
[2:00:00] This Jesus whom you've crucified. God
[2:00:02] has made him both Lord, father, son, and
[2:00:05] holy ghost. He's all three.
[2:00:11] Amen. And all the brethren, it says they
[2:00:14] were pricricked in their
[2:00:15] hearts. They said, "What shall we
[2:00:18] do? What shall we
[2:00:22] do?"
[2:00:24] Amen. Dr. Peter, what shall we do? Dr.
[2:00:28] Peter says, "I've got the prescription.
[2:00:31] Jesus gave me the keys. Whatever I lock
[2:00:34] will be locked. Whatever I unlock will
[2:00:36] be unlocked." I want you to understand
[2:00:39] that. And I want to give you it exactly
[2:00:41] the way that Jesus gave it to me. Amen.
[2:00:44] Wait till Jerusalem till ye beued with
[2:00:48] power from on high. Then open he their
[2:00:51] understanding. Repentance and remissions
[2:00:53] of sins should be preached in his name
[2:00:55] beginning at
[2:00:56] Jerusalem. He had the revelation. I got
[2:00:59] the revelation. Repent every one of you
[2:01:02] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:01:04] Christ for the remission of your sins.
[2:01:07] and it'll eradicate that desire for sin.
[2:01:09] It won't just eradicate sin, but it'll
[2:01:11] take the very desire for sin
[2:01:13] out. That's what we need. It's a desire
[2:01:16] for sin out completely burned.
[2:01:20] God eradicate
[2:01:26] it.
[2:01:27] Amen. Praise the
[2:01:33] Lord. A real new birth.
[2:01:36] be born again by the spirit of God.
[2:01:41] Make you a new creature.
[2:01:43] I'm a new creation.
[2:01:46] I'm a brand new man. Old things have
[2:01:49] passed
[2:01:50] away. Behold, all things have become
[2:01:52] new. Let me quickly go here. We won't go
[2:01:56] much long, but I don't want to skip
[2:01:57] this. I want to try to get
[2:02:02] this. All right.
[2:02:07] So he says to Dr. Dah, he says, he says,
[2:02:11] uh, now I said in this
[2:02:16] case, he says, I'm going to give you a
[2:02:19] soul
[2:02:21] examination. See, and God for the
[2:02:24] soul only has one instrument. That's
[2:02:27] right. That's his word.
[2:02:31] Brother Da also said, he said, "Well,
[2:02:34] I'd like to be living. I want I want to
[2:02:38] see the rapture so
[2:02:40] bad." 91 back then. I want to see the
[2:02:44] rapture so bad. I said, "All right, let
[2:02:48] me see what the science book says here
[2:02:50] to it." The soul
[2:02:55] science. How many believe this is the
[2:02:57] book for your soul?
[2:03:00] This is where you go for. This is the
[2:03:03] examination right here. This is what the
[2:03:06] doctor has to go to. Every other man's
[2:03:09] word is a lie. You got to come according
[2:03:12] to
[2:03:14] this.
[2:03:16] Amen. That's
[2:03:18] right. The soul. And I said, well, it
[2:03:21] says here. And then he goes into second
[2:03:23] Corinth second Thessalonians. We which
[2:03:25] are alive and sleep. But I want to go a
[2:03:27] little different route.
[2:03:29] He said, "So you take the
[2:03:31] book. I want to be in the
[2:03:34] rapture." How many wants to be in the
[2:03:36] rapture? How many like to examine
[2:03:39] yourself to see whether you'll be in the
[2:03:41] rapture or not?
[2:03:45] Cuz he said here, "Whether you're dead
[2:03:47] or whether you're
[2:03:49] sleeping, they which are alive and
[2:03:51] remain shall be caught up together with
[2:03:52] them." Amen. The dead in Christ shall
[2:03:55] rise first. He says, "No matter what, if
[2:03:58] you're a real Christian, you're going to
[2:03:59] be there."
[2:04:02] But there's a
[2:04:03] way for us to look to examine
[2:04:07] oursel to see whether you'll be in the
[2:04:09] rapture or not. Now, I didn't bring the
[2:04:12] quotes this morning, but I'll maybe just
[2:04:14] repeat them a little
[2:04:17] bit. Let me see here.
[2:04:22] But one of the things that we have to
[2:04:24] examine ourselves
[2:04:26] about of whether you're going into
[2:04:28] rapture or
[2:04:41] not must be on the next page or
[2:04:46] something. I thought I wrote it down.
[2:04:49] probably wrote it on the back of one of
[2:04:50] these
[2:04:58] papers. All right. Who wants to be my
[2:05:00] illustration
[2:05:02] person? All right. Come on. You You You
[2:05:04] dress up awful nice. Doesn't he dress
[2:05:06] good? You're You're You qualify,
[2:05:09] brother. Okay. Amen. That I'm happy. I'm
[2:05:12] chosen. Right. Amen. You're chosen.
[2:05:16] So, we want to go do an examination of
[2:05:18] whether you'll be in the rapture or not.
[2:05:19] Would that be all right? That'd be fine.
[2:05:21] Well, I'm going to be there. Let me ask
[2:05:23] you this. When people treat you real
[2:05:25] bad, do you get back at them? Nope. No.
[2:05:29] I used
[2:05:30] to, but not the new. The new me says,
[2:05:33] "I'll just forgive you because you don't
[2:05:35] know what you're doing to me." Oh, wow.
[2:05:37] So, you already have forgiveness in your
[2:05:39] heart. Wow. He passed the first two
[2:05:40] tests right there, didn't he? That's
[2:05:43] right. Not holding grudges. And you have
[2:05:45] love for people when they don't treat
[2:05:47] you right. That's right. Isn't that
[2:05:48] right? What about when things go
[2:05:51] wrong and really bad wrong and you're
[2:05:54] between a rock and a hard place? Do you
[2:05:56] get upset? No. I just have patience. I
[2:05:58] know it's going to work out. I put it in
[2:06:01] the Lord's hands and believe it or not.
[2:06:03] Oh boy, I like to hear that. Did you
[2:06:04] hear that? He says he puts it in the
[2:06:06] Lord. That p he passed the test. Put it
[2:06:09] in the Lord. Trust in the Lord. Ain't
[2:06:11] that right? When you get between a rock
[2:06:12] and that's when what the thing you got
[2:06:14] to have faith, you got to have perfect
[2:06:15] faith. That when bad things happen and
[2:06:18] so forth that you commit yourself to
[2:06:20] God.
[2:06:23] Amen.
[2:06:25] You don't let fear get a hold of
[2:06:27] you. What about like um now this is a
[2:06:30] good one, but let me just say this. all
[2:06:33] of
[2:06:34] your good deeds that you did to the
[2:06:37] neighbor and all of these religious
[2:06:40] demonstrations that you maybe have done
[2:06:42] and buying a widow coal and being all of
[2:06:45] that. Do you reckon that's going to
[2:06:46] qualify you? No. Takes more than work.
[2:06:49] It takes more than work, don't it?
[2:06:51] That's right. But Abraham says all of
[2:06:52] your religious demonstrations and
[2:06:54] everything won't get you there. Ain't
[2:06:56] that right? That's right. Amen. So, do
[2:06:59] you love everybody? I do. I try to love
[2:07:02] everybody. I do. Sometimes the uh
[2:07:05] transsexuals might.
[2:07:09] We'll forgive you for that.
[2:07:12] No, we love them too. We do, but we
[2:07:14] don't like what they do. We don't do
[2:07:16] admonish at all what they do. That's
[2:07:19] right. It's It's absolutely wrong. But
[2:07:21] Amen. So that's the basically the final
[2:07:24] question was, "Do you have perfect
[2:07:26] love?" Well, I do now. Amen. God bless
[2:07:29] you. God bless you. You do
[2:07:31] [Applause]
[2:07:35] now. Cuz remember Bam says all of your
[2:07:38] religions, don't you? He says it'll take
[2:07:41] perfect love to put you there. Amen. How
[2:07:44] many believe that? You can't have Amen.
[2:07:46] A couple questions I didn't ask him. Do
[2:07:48] you Do you have a bitter taste in your
[2:07:50] mouth? When somebody does you die, do
[2:07:52] you have bitterness in your mouth? Do
[2:07:53] you have bitterness? How many knows
[2:07:55] bitterness ain't going to be there? No.
[2:07:57] That bitterness means you have a grudge
[2:07:59] that you hold against somebody when
[2:08:01] there's no bitterness and you got
[2:08:03] complete
[2:08:04] forgiveness. Perfect love casts out
[2:08:07] bitterness. Amen. It'd be a
[2:08:09] disqualification to have bitterness in
[2:08:11] your heart. You got to forgive
[2:08:13] everybody. But Abraham says perfect
[2:08:15] love. Amen. When whether they pat you on
[2:08:17] the back, what about when you do
[2:08:18] somebody good and they do you wrong? He
[2:08:21] said when even when they do you wrong,
[2:08:23] you still pat scratch their back. It
[2:08:26] takes perfect love to put you there.
[2:08:29] Lord, help us. How many say, "God, help
[2:08:31] me. I want perfect love, perfect
[2:08:35] faith." Amen. That'll put you in the
[2:08:39] rapture.
[2:08:47] Amen. I think in closing, we have to
[2:08:50] examine ourselves.
[2:08:53] I hope Joe don't mind if I say something
[2:08:56] that he said in the prayer room last
[2:08:58] week. He mentioned he says, "You know,
[2:09:00] we're living in the hour that those
[2:09:01] little things maybe that you've done
[2:09:03] wrong or whatever, you need to get them
[2:09:05] right. It's time that you want to have
[2:09:06] them right. You want to be ready to meet
[2:09:07] the Lord."
[2:09:10] Amen. And I said, "That's what the Holy
[2:09:12] Spirit will do, Brother Joe. How many
[2:09:14] believes that the Holy Spirit will help
[2:09:16] you examine your own life?
[2:09:20] You will examine yourself to see whether
[2:09:22] you're in the faith or not. And that
[2:09:24] Holy Spirit cares about every little
[2:09:27] detail about you. Just like that doctor,
[2:09:30] he cares about every portion of that
[2:09:32] blood test. Okay? This this this this
[2:09:35] all needs to be in a certain category
[2:09:37] for you to be healthy. Amen. How many
[2:09:41] believes that's the way it is with us?
[2:09:42] Your faith needs to be where it needs to
[2:09:44] be. Your love needs to be. Your prayer
[2:09:45] life needs to be. Your diet, daily diet
[2:09:48] needs to be where it needs to be. Amen.
[2:09:50] If you're going to be a healthy
[2:09:51] Christian, how many wants to be a
[2:09:53] healthy Christian? Say, "God, help me to
[2:09:55] be a healthy Christian." Stand with
[2:10:01] me, Lord. Take away any blockages. Isn't
[2:10:04] that right? Take away those bad things
[2:10:08] that are in my blood that cause
[2:10:11] blockages. Amen. Between me and God.
[2:10:14] Amen. How many say, "Lord, that's what I
[2:10:16] want. Take any thing that causes
[2:10:18] blockage. Take that bad fat away. Take
[2:10:20] that those bad things out of my life.
[2:10:23] Take them out of my life. Take them out
[2:10:24] of my blood. Amen. So that it could flow
[2:10:27] free. That you could have your way in my
[2:10:30] life."
[2:10:33] Amen. God bless you, brother Joshua.
[2:10:40] Creating me a clean heart.
[2:10:45] Create in me a
[2:10:49] clean
