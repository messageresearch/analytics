[37:51] there's many of you
[37:52] i think every one of you let me tell you
[37:54] something god bless you
[37:56] you're the fifth gospel we've heard that
[37:58] over and over
[37:59] matthew mark luke and john and mother
[38:03] she's the fifth gospel and he says
[38:05] remember when moses was a little boy
[38:08] it was a mother who gave him instruction
[38:10] it was a godly mother who took little
[38:12] moses on her knees
[38:14] and said moses someday you're going to
[38:16] deliver the children of israel
[38:18] you're the boy that's called keep
[38:20] yourself pure
[38:22] unspotted from the world for you're the
[38:24] one
[38:25] you're the one how many of you ever had
[38:27] mother encourage you
[38:28] like that that's what mothers do they
[38:30] encourage
[38:32] no other place do we know of that he
[38:34] ever went to a seminary
[38:36] all of his teaching he ever got was
[38:37] right there in pharaoh's palace
[38:40] who was a heathen but his mother was
[38:42] there and taught him
[38:43] that's a real mother she taught him the
[38:45] precepts of the lord
[38:47] she taught him how he must be holy she
[38:49] taught him how that he must live
[38:51] she taught him how what god must do and
[38:53] would do for him
[38:55] and it stuck with moses all the days of
[38:58] his life
[39:01] you've been there all the days of his
[39:04] life
[39:05] brother david i think you're still mic'd
[39:07] up i hear you coming through the
[39:09] monitors here
[39:11] and any good and loyal and true mother
[39:14] that'll take her little babies
[39:16] instead of sending them to a picture
[39:18] show and a dance and set them on her lap
[39:21] and teach them about the lord jesus
[39:22] christ
[39:24] he said my here the other day he said i
[39:27] was talking to a mother on the telephone
[39:29] and the mother said oh brother billy

[39:43] i don't know but no matter whether he's
[39:47] right
[39:47] or wrong i love him

[39:54] he said i've been so
[39:56] deceived by this and that the son
[39:57] talking back to his mother now

[42:42] chapter 1 luke chapter 1 it says
[42:46] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[42:49] was joseph
[42:50] of the house of david and the virgin's
[42:53] name was mary
[42:54] and the angel come unto her and said
[42:56] hail thou
[42:58] art highly favored the lord is with thee
[43:01] blessed art thou among women and when
[43:04] she saw him
[43:05] she was troubled at his saying and cast
[43:07] in her mind
[43:08] what manner of salutation this should be
[43:11] and the angel said unto her
[43:13] fear not mary for thou has found favor
[43:16] with god and behold thou shalt conceive
[43:20] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[43:23] shall call his name
[43:24] jesus he shall be great he shall be
[43:27] called the son of the highest
[43:29] the lord the lord god shall give unto
[43:31] him the throne of his father david
[43:33] and he shall reign over the house of
[43:35] jacob forever
[43:37] and his kingdom there shall be no end
[43:39] praise the lord
[43:41] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[43:44] this be
[43:45] seen i know not a man and the angel
[43:48] answered and said unto her
[43:50] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[43:53] and the power of the highest shall
[43:55] overshadow thee
[43:57] therefore also that holy thing which
[43:59] shall be born of thee shall be called
[44:01] the son of god
[44:03] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has
[44:05] also conceived a son in her old age
[44:07] and this is the sixth month with her who
[44:10] was called
[44:10] barren for with god nothing shall be
[44:14] impossible and mary said listen to how
[44:17] she replies
[44:19] behold the handmaid of the lord
[44:22] she accepted right there her
[44:23] responsibility the handmaid of the lord
[44:26] she is saying
[44:26] i will be your servant i will be your
[44:29] partner i will be an
[44:30] element of this plan of yours i behold
[44:33] the handmaid of the lord
