[0:00] and we'll read down to 34.
[0:02] the next day john seeing jesus jesus
[0:05] coming
[0:06] unto him and saith behold the lamb of
[0:08] god which taketh away the sins of the
[0:10] world
[0:11] this is he whom i said after me cometh a
[0:14] man which is preferred before me
[0:17] for he was before me and i knew him not
[0:20] but that he should be made manifest to
[0:22] israel
[0:24] therefore i am come baptizing with water
[0:26] and john bear record saying i saw the
[0:28] spirit descending from heaven
[0:30] like a dove and it abode upon him
[0:33] and i knew him not but he that sent him
[0:36] sent me to baptize with water the same
[0:38] said unto me upon whom thou shalt see
[0:41] the spirit descending and remaining on
[0:43] him the same is he which baptizes with
[0:45] the holy ghost
[0:47] and i saw and bear record that this is
[0:50] the son of god
[0:52] and it said earlier we said that if we
[0:53] believed on him we became the sons of
[0:55] god
[0:56] and i think i always look at that
[0:58] scripture there um
[1:00] in in 30 let's see in 32 where it talks
[1:04] about the spirit descending down upon
[1:05] jesus he set that as an example
[1:08] jesus was god but he needed he needed
[1:10] everything that god was just like we
[1:13] need everything that god is he's the
[1:15] alpha the omega the beginning the end he
[1:18] said i'll be with you even in you to the
[1:20] end of the world
[1:22] and we need that holy ghost experience
[1:24] to descend upon us just like jesus did
[1:28] and i just want to you know i want to
[1:31] say that with with passion this morning
[1:33] in a way that we can't live our lives
[1:35] without the holy ghost
[1:37] i've tried it it don't work you can you
[1:40] can be a good christian and not have the
[1:42] holy ghost
[1:44] you can be a good example and not have
[1:47] the holy ghost
[1:48] but when you live as a good christian
[1:50] and as an example with the holy ghost
[1:52] you not only change the lives of you
[1:54] your family but all those you come in
[1:57] contact with
[1:58] so this morning i just want to just say
[2:00] this as a little lesson that we can't
[2:02] have too much of god
[2:04] you can't study too much you can't pray
[2:06] too much you can't read too much and you
[2:09] sure can't have too much of the holy
[2:10] ghost
[2:12] god bless you go david
[2:32] this thing would be good
[2:38] sing that little course
[2:40] mr becky all my hope is in jesus this
[2:42] morning if we could
[2:44] and all
[2:46] my hope is in jesus

[5:53] bible reading and i kind of had to
[5:55] chuckle when brother austin was reading
[5:58] that one scripture says i was young but
[6:01] now i'm old and i thought well austin
[6:03] you didn't know what old is yet buddy
[6:05] but anyways i just thought stood off and
[6:08] i still thinking of eating as a real
[6:10] young person
[6:11] and
[6:12] and joe he's really old but that's just
[6:15] the difference in them but you know i'm
[6:17] just glad that god lives in our hearts
[6:18] and lives aren't you this morning and we
[6:21] appreciate each and every one this
[6:22] morning and
[6:24] mine just so happy and i was thinking as
[6:26] brother brad was talking about those
[6:27] that
[6:28] during the flood and i began to think
[6:31] and i didn't say nothing about it last
[6:32] sunday and we had quite a few prayer
[6:34] requests this morning
[6:36] but you know when
[6:38] and i was me and brother brother brad
[6:40] had called me today and i was telling
[6:41] him and
[6:42] these little news bits that i would get
[6:44] and i said you know they was talking
[6:45] about afghanistan and
[6:47] brother berry coffee and sister coffee
[6:49] had made mention of a church of
[6:52] believers over there that were really
[6:54] under siege and i thought you know
[6:57] here we are this morning
[7:00] no worries truthfully
[7:03] come to worship the lord this morning
[7:04] and
[7:06] that's right
[7:08] where are they at this morning
[7:10] they don't know if they're going to come
[7:11] through that door wherever they're
[7:12] meeting and they're going to kill every
[7:13] one of them
[7:16] i thought lord how many of us would be
[7:17] at church myself included
[7:21] and i thought lord
[7:23] that's your children over there
[7:25] i pray you watch over them and you know
[7:28] and we were talking the things and
[7:30] sister natalie and them in the back and
[7:31] i said you know the pressure is just
[7:33] coming everywhere you go everybody it's
[7:36] just pressure
[7:37] pressure pressure
[7:39] the whole say but i'm glad you know why
[7:43] for jesus has come
[7:45] and brother branham said
[7:47] he can let off that pressure this
[7:48] morning
[7:49] because he's in our hearts and lives
[7:51] this morning he's alive and well this
[7:53] morning he said where's he at look at
[7:55] your neighbor that's where he's at this
[7:57] morning and i'm so glad this morning
[7:59] that he is in our midst this morning
[8:02] just his presence to know that he loves
[8:04] us he cares for us
[8:06] you say why do we have to go through
[8:08] these things i don't know
[8:10] but i know one thing that he said he had
[8:12] never leave me or he would never forsake
[8:15] me
[8:16] and i'm trusting that this morning
[8:18] and you know
[8:20] we we have so much to pray for
[8:23] all this mess going around but i thought
[8:25] lord

[8:28] brother branham said you could sing too
[8:30] much you can talk too much but he said
[8:32] you can never
[8:33] pray too much

[35:06] atmosphere lord that you're just so
[35:08] welcome to come into lord and to have
[35:10] your way to speak to us along the way
[35:13] and our hearts could burn within us as
[35:15] you would speak to us this morning

[35:19] father i most of all just ask god that
[35:21] you would say what what you want to say
[35:23] to your people today lord jesus to your
[35:25] children this morning what we need to
[35:27] hear lord

[36:38] amen
[36:39] so i'm going to speak on working this
[36:41] morning and it comes to me i'll just say
[36:44] it uh maybe here a little bit but i mean
[36:47] you know the bible says one place that
[36:48] if a man doesn't work neither should he
[36:50] eat
[36:51] am i right so anyway if you will turn
[36:55] john 9 and this is a scripture that came
[36:57] to me when i begin to think about
[36:59] working
[37:01] nine
[37:03] and we'll begin with one one through
[37:07] four
[37:09] or actually let's go through five
[37:11] and as jesus passed by he saw a man
[37:14] which was blind from his birth
[37:16] and his disciples asked him saying
[37:19] master
[37:20] who did sin this man or his parents that
[37:23] he was born blind
[37:25] jesus answered neither hath this man's
[37:27] sin nor his parents
[37:30] but that the works of god should be made
[37:32] manifest in him
[37:34] i must work the works of him that sent
[37:38] me
[37:38] while it is day
[37:40] the night cometh when no man
[37:43] can work
[37:45] as long as i am in the world i am the
[37:47] light of the world amen my god is
[37:50] blessings to the reading of the word you
[37:51] can be seated
[37:53] this morning
[37:55] amen
[37:58] i got to thinking about that
[38:00] statement that jesus made there speaking
[38:03] about how that he came to work
[38:05] the work and do the work that god had
[38:08] sent him to do
[38:09] and as i began to study this this whole
[38:14] thought of working
[38:15] i began to see something here that i
[38:19] probably haven't hardly ever preached on
[38:22] amen and that's pretty rare
[38:24] amen and so
[38:26] and i call it kind of the other side of
[38:28] salvation
[38:30] they kind of like two sides of salvation
[38:33] you know because we're constantly i'm
[38:35] always talking about salvation talking
[38:37] about being saved
[38:39] being baptized by giving your heart let
[38:41] the lord live through and so forth and
[38:44] uh but you know there's another side of
[38:46] it there's another side of it that i'd
[38:48] like to speak on for a little while
[38:50] this morning
[38:51] amen and that is what happens and what
[38:54] you do and what you become
[38:56] after you get saved isn't that right
[39:00] after you get saved
[39:02] amen
[39:03] and so i want to turn to another one
[39:07] another scripture
[39:09] in matthew
[39:11] 20.
[39:15] matthew 20. let's go to matthew 20.
[39:20] now read that and come back and pick up
[39:22] a little a couple more thoughts here on
[39:24] this first scripture
[39:37] matthew chapter 20 verse 1.
[39:42] the kingdom of heaven now notice the
[39:44] kingdom of heaven
[39:45] is likened to a man amen i like that
[39:48] don't you when jesus began to tell you
[39:50] what it's like now he's going to say uh
[39:53] just basically what uh the direction
[39:55] that we want to go this morning like
[39:57] unto a man that is a householder
[40:00] which went out early in the morning
[40:03] to hire
[40:05] laborers amen
[40:07] into
[40:08] his vineyard now how many believe that
[40:11] after you get saved god hires you
[40:14] amen you become a hired hand
[40:18] amen you become a servant
[40:21] you're not just a child of god now
[40:23] you're not just predestinated before the
[40:25] foundation of the world the son and
[40:26] daughter of god but now
[40:28] god hires us
[40:30] amen it's kind of different category
[40:33] now you become a laborer how many
[40:35] believe we're laborers
[40:38] into
[40:39] his vineyard
[40:41] now he goes to talking about any point
[40:43] about how that he
[40:46] hired different ones at the different
[40:48] times of the day isn't that right
[40:50] and i remember the probably god talking
[40:52] about how that you notice that the 11th
[40:55] hour workers get the same reward as the
[40:59] first hour workers
[41:02] now the first hour workers didn't like
[41:04] that real well
[41:06] amen they didn't like that real well
[41:09] uh
[41:10] you know
[41:11] and they went to saying you know he says
[41:14] these last have wrought but one hour but
[41:17] that has they made them equal unto us
[41:20] which have borne the burden and heat of
[41:22] the day
[41:24] amen he answered one of them and said
[41:26] friend i do thee no wrong kids down not
[41:29] agree with me for a penny amen
[41:32] amen i like that so take that is thine
[41:34] and go thy way and i will give unto this
[41:37] last evenness unto thee
[41:39] is it not lawful for me to do
[41:41] what i will with mine own is thine i
[41:44] evil because i am good amen so the last
[41:48] shall be first and the first shall be
[41:50] last amen i believe another place he
[41:52] says you know i don't do you any wrong
[41:54] because you know i can do it i can do
[41:57] with mine what i will
[41:59] and if you made a certain agreement in
[42:02] that right
[42:03] that's the agreement that you have and
[42:05] that's completely just
[42:07] he had made the same agreement with 11
[42:09] hours workers you know
[42:11] you know and that's it
[42:13] and he was pretty generous the master
[42:15] was pretty generous
[42:16] to give the last hour workers the same
[42:18] as the first
[42:20] amendment and somebody believes that's
[42:21] true but listen i like that because god
[42:24] hires us
[42:25] now let me go back again picking back up
[42:27] again where he was over at saint john
[42:29] there's a couple things that i want to
[42:30] talk about
[42:31] amen i believe it's in saint john 9. he
[42:33] says well let's work while it's day the
[42:36] night cometh how many knows brother
[42:37] brahm says as far as
[42:39] the time wise
[42:41] as far as the time where we're at in
[42:43] time amen we know that we're cut the
[42:45] closing of time we're at evening time
[42:48] right
[42:49] amen and the night is coming
[42:51] the night is coming when no man's gonna
[42:54] work anymore in other words we're not
[42:56] gonna do this another round
[42:59] this is when you work this is our chance
[43:01] to work this is our time to do something
[43:04] for god
[43:06] brother bam said he was getting to the
[43:07] evening time of his life right and he
[43:10] was sitting there on his bed and
[43:12] meditating and thinking that right how
[43:14] did he was 52 years old and he says you
[43:17] know if you're going to do something for
[43:19] god
[43:20] you better get busy
[43:22] get to doing that because you ain't got
[43:24] a lot of time left to do anything for
[43:26] god
[43:27] amen i certainly could say that about me
[43:29] i'm 60 not 52. amen i i said i was 60
[43:33] know that i if i if i ever lie to you
[43:37] and tell you that i'm older than i am
[43:39] i always call myself at 57 i says i'm
[43:42] i'm 58.
[43:44] all right then when i get 50 80 it's no
[43:46] big deal when i'm 58 i call myself 59 so
[43:49] then when i get this no big deal so i
[43:51] say i'm 60 even though i'm 59 because
[43:54] when i get there it's not a big deal
[43:58] all right so
[43:59] so now if i call myself that i'm not
[44:02] really lying it's just i'm preparing
[44:04] myself okay
[44:09] anyway so we
[44:11] just praise the lord amen and brother
[44:13] branham was the evening time of his life
[44:15] isn't that right i'm at the evening time
[44:17] of my life if i'm going to do anything
[44:19] for the lord amen and as a christian we
[44:22] appreciate the salvation that god has
[44:24] given us don't we
[44:25] amen and saving us and giving making the
[44:28] sons and daughters of god you know but
[44:30] as we get older we begin to think
[44:32] amen is that right but we're beginning
[44:34] to think what have i done for the lord
[44:37] what have i done to better the kingdom
[44:40] of god
[44:44] amen because how many knows that god is
[44:47] going to ask of us what we have done
[44:49] what did you do
[44:50] amen what kind of a
[44:52] servant was you what kind of a laborer
[44:55] in the vineyard was because we're not
[44:58] just sons but we're also servants amen
[45:00] we're laborers we've been hired to do a
[45:03] job
[45:05] amen
[45:06] and i like that because brother babe was
[45:08] bringing it out into sunday school act
[45:09] listen about how that god has called us
[45:11] to be a light to the world amen david
[45:14] said thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[45:17] right that word is a lamp unto my feet
[45:20] and so we're holding a lantern you know
[45:22] how many knows we're in a dark world
[45:25] holding a lantern and we're telling
[45:27] everybody else hey guess what you don't
[45:29] have to stumble around in the dark like
[45:31] you are
[45:33] there's actually a lamp that you can get
[45:35] a hold of and you can have a lamp today
[45:37] that'll guide you and show you where you
[45:39] are going
[45:40] amen we're lamp holders jesus says as
[45:43] long as i'm in the world i am the light
[45:45] of the world but then he said that you
[45:47] know you are the light of the world how
[45:49] many believes that we are called to be
[45:51] the light of the world we've got a job
[45:53] to do
[45:55] every last one of his children have a
[45:58] job to do
[46:00] he has called us to be laborers
[46:04] and have a job
[46:06] in his kingdom this morning
[46:09] amen and we know that uh you know even
[46:11] the problem of god said some of them
[46:13] quit working and and went out west and
[46:15] they thought they were just going to
[46:16] wait for the rapture quit their jobs
[46:18] sold their houses and everything he says
[46:20] don't do that you don't stop working
[46:22] until
[46:24] it's time to quit it's not quitting time
[46:26] yet you may get documently
[46:29] you're going to get knocked in your pain
[46:32] amen and there's of course there's a
[46:34] whole world brothers and sisters that we
[46:35] don't really realize but we know that
[46:38] for all that you do for all the labor
[46:40] that you put into it there's always
[46:42] there's rewards over there that will
[46:44] that'll catch up with you over there
[46:46] that'll be given to you on that day how
[46:48] many believe that
[46:50] and i believe if i'm not wrong y'all it
[46:52] kind of correct me if
[46:54] i'm wrong here but if you remember uh
[46:56] brother branham just for one thing he
[46:59] when he got over there and beyond the
[47:01] curtain of time
[47:02] and i'm not sure if it was the time that
[47:04] he uh had said you know if i'm getting
[47:06] older and he fell asleep and went caught
[47:08] up and there he was up there and then
[47:10] all of us are all of a sudden his horse
[47:12] was there in that right you know and his
[47:14] dog was there
[47:16] and if i'm not wrong but the voice said
[47:18] these are your rewards for your service
[47:21] and that right god's going to give him
[47:23] that because of his rewards for his
[47:25] service
[47:26] not only that another place it talks
[47:28] about because he said you know because
[47:30] we know the prophet of god
[47:32] immense amount of opposition
[47:34] right
[47:35] he had betrayals friends that betrayed
[47:37] him cheated in a lot and all kinds of
[47:40] things that he had to go through and he
[47:41] had to push against the wind so to speak
[47:44] he had to push a hard current and so
[47:46] forth and he chose to push it hard he
[47:49] chose to stay with the word of god when
[47:52] others when when he was brought up to
[47:55] people denominations like church of
[47:57] christ different ones offered him a jet
[47:59] to fly him from here to there pay all
[48:01] his wages take care of every part of him
[48:04] we'll take care of every part of you
[48:08] and brother branham is sitting there at
[48:10] the table he was a godly man and he says
[48:11] you know well what what do i have to do
[48:15] well if you'll just not be so hard on
[48:17] the women cutting their hair and the
[48:19] water baptism and the godhead and some
[48:21] of those things he says that's my very
[48:23] life that's that's what god has given me
[48:25] to preach that's my revelation i'm
[48:27] surprised that you as a man of god would
[48:29] ask me to compromise on the word of god
[48:32] he says you can have your jet plane you
[48:33] can have it i'm not for hire
[48:37] hello and he chose the harder path and
[48:40] remember whenever he was standing there
[48:42] and and
[48:44] uh the young man came up and said you
[48:46] know that could be the 23rd chapter of
[48:48] revelations and so forth and all of a
[48:50] sudden they begin to speak in tongues he
[48:52] began to speak in tongues and the
[48:53] interpretation was because you have
[48:55] chosen the heart of the weight out love
[48:57] the path there is a huge portion of
[49:00] heaven
[49:01] that awaits you
[49:04] it makes our man knows when he gets
[49:05] there but he gets there folks
[49:08] now i don't know
[49:10] but i do believe one thing and that is
[49:11] that he's going to be millions
[49:14] and millions of people
[49:17] that he led to the lord jesus christ
[49:20] amen like paul says they are the stars
[49:23] in my crown
[49:24] just like paul has mutas that he
[49:26] converted but a man had millions of the
[49:28] lord used him to convert isn't that
[49:30] right his whole ambition his whole goal
[49:33] was to get more into the kingdom of god
[49:36] and if you'll notice a lot of times in
[49:38] his services when he's praying he says
[49:40] forgive your unprofitable servant
[49:43] he felt unprofitable
[49:45] amen
[49:48] amen but it was at evening time it's
[49:50] evening time and i think about how that
[49:52] where here we are here you are here i am
[49:56] and even brother bannon many times in
[49:58] your life back in the 70s way back in
[50:00] 1960s talking about how did it's later
[50:03] than what you're thinking it's later
[50:04] than you think he kept saying it's later
[50:07] than you think
[50:07] [Music]
[50:08] it's getting late it's evening time it's
[50:10] almost i doubt i don't believe that i
[50:13] would die of old age before he will be
[50:16] here
[50:17] is that right
[50:18] i don't you know he also predicted and
[50:21] he predicted that perhaps before 77 he
[50:23] says i don't prophesy i just you know
[50:26] predict that by 1977 the millennium will
[50:29] be in it'll be over with us but then
[50:32] huh so that's where he was at now look
[50:34] at where we are
[50:36] and every time that there's a new law
[50:39] past everything that every time there's
[50:41] uh things that just like homosexuality
[50:44] acknowledged by our supreme court that
[50:45] was a great big darkness cutting darker
[50:48] and darker and darker amen and we can
[50:51] feel it in the last few weeks we can
[50:52] feel how it's just getting darker
[50:55] and darker and darker amen
[50:58] i don't know what it's like to sit in a
[51:00] tree and hunt amen and they have you
[51:02] know and the law is that you can shoot
[51:05] up to 30 minutes after sunset isn't that
[51:08] right and to sit there and when you know
[51:10] that the sun is set you've only got 30
[51:12] minutes that's all you got because by
[51:14] then it is going to be too dark for you
[51:16] to do anything darkness will be there
[51:18] you better have your head lamp on your
[51:20] head or in your pouch you better have
[51:22] some light on you because you're not
[51:23] going to be able to see in 30 minutes
[51:25] and that's where you and i are we're not
[51:27] in the 30 minutes hardly we're back in
[51:29] the last five minutes of it we're right
[51:32] down to where it's almost dark
[51:35] with and nobody will be able to work
[51:38] folks and i'm here to tell you how many
[51:39] beliefs that even we're gonna people
[51:41] they're gonna try to shut us down but as
[51:42] long as we have breath we're gonna try
[51:44] to do something for the kingdom of god
[51:48] i don't care what
[51:50] it is folks just do something for the
[51:53] kingdom of god let god use you let you
[51:56] be a laborer to be a blessing to your
[51:59] neighbor to be a blessing to your loved
[52:00] ones to be a blessing in order to like
[52:03] to your worker or the worker to the boss
[52:05] whatever it might be you just want god
[52:07] to work and live and be a light amen
[52:10] they spread the gospel
[52:11] into all the world and preach the gospel
[52:14] to every creature i believe every
[52:15] christian woman or man is called to
[52:17] testify of the power and of the grace of
[52:20] god
[52:23] [Music]
[52:24] hey man how many believes it here we are
[52:26] at the closing and sometimes you know it
[52:29] looks like in myself you find yourself
[52:31] getting so caught up in the things of
[52:32] the world amen if you begin to lose your
[52:34] enthusiasm i'm losing my enthusiasm for
[52:38] the world and for the things of this
[52:40] world because we realize we realize it's
[52:42] absolutely futile it will mean nothing
[52:45] to you then
[52:46] our benjamin franklin's and our bender
[52:49] and our and our bank accounts they're
[52:51] not going to be anything one of these
[52:52] days amen god's not going to ask you how
[52:54] much money you make he's going to ask
[52:56] how better at light how good a light how
[52:58] good a labor was you in my vineyard what
[53:01] did you do for me
[53:04] amen
[53:05] and i thought strange brother david
[53:07] speaking of just before he coming out
[53:09] talking about amen what we want to hear
[53:11] you brother branham said he says you
[53:13] know i didn't hear him when he said come
[53:14] unto me oh you are weary and heavy laden
[53:17] but i do want to hear him when he says
[53:19] come on in thou good and faithful
[53:22] servant and enter into the joys of the
[53:24] lord i do want to hear that i going to
[53:27] hear something said that you were a good
[53:29] and you were a faithful
[53:31] servant
[53:34] he didn't say just you're a son of god
[53:36] come on in no you were a good and
[53:38] faithful servant enter into
[53:40] the joys of the lord
[53:45] amen
[53:46] we know that our salvation has nothing
[53:48] to do with our works isn't that right
[53:50] sure it don't but
[53:52] amen while we serve the lord shows
[53:54] whether we love him or not
[53:56] how many believe that
[53:59] all right
[54:01] so praise be to god so we're called how
[54:03] many knows we're called to work in the
[54:06] work while it's day like this yon's
[54:08] father say work while his day for the
[54:10] night is coming we're quietly there
[54:12] who's going to go and tell the people
[54:14] how to find a way
[54:16] work while it's day for the night is
[54:18] coming folks the night is just about
[54:20] honest if you're going to do anything i
[54:22] feel the holy spirit saying to all of us
[54:24] if you're going to do something for him
[54:26] you better do it now
[54:30] that's all you don't want to look back
[54:32] and say oh i wish i would have done that
[54:33] i wish i would have done this brother
[54:35] man came to the deathbed of many people
[54:37] who said oh i want my child i want my
[54:38] son i want my daughter i want you gotta
[54:40] do this but not once you got to do that
[54:43] you know because i didn't do it
[54:45] he says that don't work
[54:48] they can't do it for you you miss your
[54:50] opportunity you didn't do it when you
[54:52] was there
[54:53] now you want somebody else to do it that
[54:55] worked that way
[54:57] amen
[54:59] so if you're going to work you better
[55:00] work
[55:02] do something for god
[55:04] amen hallelujah
[55:06] because the hour's late
[55:09] amen
[55:12] amen jesus himself when he was here
[55:15] amen he was moved because he saw the
[55:17] great multitudes was moved with
[55:20] compassion on them because they fainted
[55:22] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[55:24] having no shepherd but he was having
[55:26] quite a time perhaps with his crowd and
[55:28] all of a sudden he says you know he says
[55:29] to his disciples the harvest truly is
[55:32] plenty of us but the laborers are few
[55:37] folks
[55:38] they know we didn't be oh another he
[55:40] didn't come to be ministered to you know
[55:42] because they were having a dispute and
[55:44] they were angry with that young man who
[55:45] said that he wanted to be on the right
[55:47] hand of the father and so forth and mama
[55:49] and support one on the one they were
[55:51] angry with him because they want to do
[55:52] it they wanted that kind of position he
[55:54] said you know the gentiles exercise
[55:56] dominion and power and authority over
[55:58] you but he says it shall not be so with
[56:00] you the least of yours if it will be the
[56:03] greatest let him be your servant
[56:06] amen
[56:09] oh my so there he was and he says you
[56:11] know the laborers are few amen the
[56:13] harvest truly is plenty but the laborers
[56:15] are if you pray therefore to the lord of
[56:17] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[56:20] into the harvest we don't come here to
[56:23] be served folks we don't come here to be
[56:25] petted and to be babied we come here to
[56:28] be a light to others and a help to
[56:31] others
[56:31] jesus whole life was spent to live for
[56:34] others
[56:36] amen and not himself
[56:40] over in james let's talk about works for
[56:42] just a minute let's pick this up
[56:45] see what james thought about works and
[56:47] working
[56:48] and doing stuff
[56:50] james 2 and verse 14
[56:52] he says what does it prophet my brother
[56:54] and man say he has faith and have not
[56:58] works
[56:59] can faith save him if a brother or a
[57:02] sister be naked and destitate a
[57:04] destitute of daily food
[57:07] huh
[57:08] and you say well hallelujah brother i
[57:10] believe god can supply
[57:12] and be on your merry way now
[57:16] when you got a freezer full of steaks
[57:18] and rib eyes and fish and everything
[57:20] else and you don't give them anything
[57:24] see how many of those working is
[57:26] something that you do
[57:29] the james was saying there's got to be
[57:30] something that goes along with our faith
[57:33] and it's our actions it's what we do
[57:37] all right and one of you saying to him
[57:38] departed peace and be warmed and filled
[57:41] notwithstanding he give them not those
[57:44] things which are needful of the body
[57:46] what does it profit even so faith if it
[57:49] hath not works it's dead being alone
[57:54] amen yeah a man may say thou has faith
[57:57] and i have worked show me thy faith
[57:59] without the works now notice and i will
[58:01] show thee my faith by my works how many
[58:05] believes that our works show whether we
[58:09] have faith or whether we don't
[58:16] zip the lip
[58:18] and show me the action
[58:21] we give god to way too much lip service
[58:24] not enough action
[58:26] [Music]
[58:29] now james covers
[58:31] this about abraham believe god
[58:34] and he's imputed him the righteous he
[58:36] covers that but he also brings this in
[58:38] and he makes a great point
[58:41] even so faith if it had not worked maybe
[58:43] i don't know if any man say that okay i
[58:45] read that
[58:46] thou believers there is one god thou do
[58:48] as well the devils also believe and
[58:50] tremble but will thou know o man
[58:53] no obey me that faith without works is
[58:56] dead
[58:57] was not abraham our father justified but
[59:00] works when he had offered isaac help his
[59:02] son on the altar see is now how that
[59:04] faith wrought with his works
[59:06] and by works was faith made
[59:09] perfect
[59:10] amen the scripture says
[59:13] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[59:15] saith abraham believed god and it was
[59:17] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[59:19] he was called the friend of god
[59:22] you see then how to that by works a man
[59:25] is justified and not by faith only
[59:30] amen how many knows that is the other
[59:32] the flip side of the coin is god believe
[59:34] that but why then did god still take
[59:37] abraham up there and say go and offer up
[59:40] your only son i want you to kill him
[59:43] and god was so interested in seeing
[59:46] abraham's action behind his faith that
[59:49] he let abraham take that sharp bag and
[59:52] come up with his hand and he was fixing
[59:54] to plunge it into his son because that's
[59:56] what god said
[59:59] amen right
[1:00:00] and the angel even called out said hold
[1:00:03] it hold that head don't do it
[1:00:06] i want it to prove i want to see all
[1:00:08] that they see some action behind your
[1:00:10] faith that's what james was trying to
[1:00:12] say look how many we can
[1:00:14] say we have faith all we want to but our
[1:00:16] actions prove
[1:00:18] whether we have faith
[1:00:20] or not
[1:00:22] real genuine faith
[1:00:25] has works behind
[1:00:26] it fake faith
[1:00:29] doesn't
[1:00:32] real fake faith it's not real
[1:00:35] because if you really genuinely have
[1:00:37] faith like you should have
[1:00:40] amen praise the lord you love him
[1:00:44] my
[1:00:46] then he goes on we'll finish the chapter
[1:00:48] up
[1:00:49] he says likewise also was not ray have
[1:00:52] the harlot justified by works when he
[1:00:54] had seen receive the messages and that
[1:00:55] sent them away another way
[1:00:58] now notice he brings in rahab talking
[1:01:00] about rehab said we know she said to
[1:01:02] those those spies that hollis we know
[1:01:05] that god is with you and everybody is
[1:01:08] weak we're trembling and we i believe
[1:01:10] that god is forgotten real
[1:01:13] and what they say they said if you help
[1:01:16] us escape
[1:01:18] if you help us escape and you lower us
[1:01:19] down and you get us out of here when we
[1:01:22] come back we'll spare you and because of
[1:01:25] what she did not just because of what
[1:01:27] she believed but because of what she did
[1:01:29] she was spared
[1:01:31] amen so how many believes that it all
[1:01:33] has to come together there is a
[1:01:36] contradiction when somebody says they
[1:01:38] have faith and they don't have the works
[1:01:40] to go along with it
[1:01:42] there's a contradiction somewhere
[1:01:44] god doesn't contradict
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] praise the lord you love him this
[1:01:52] morning
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:54] so i believe that god is looking for
[1:01:57] us
[1:01:58] and he's looking for works
[1:02:00] amen he sure is
[1:02:02] he's hiring us
[1:02:04] amen he's hiring us
[1:02:06] to be a laborer
[1:02:08] in the vineyard
[1:02:10] again
[1:02:11] if you want to turn with me you can to
[1:02:13] matthew i'm going to look at another
[1:02:14] parable
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:22] there's a parable that i'm leaving off
[1:02:24] that i don't really understand
[1:02:26] it's the one where he had a vineyard and
[1:02:28] i do understand partial of it but not
[1:02:31] the way that i want to understand it
[1:02:33] of how did he send his servants
[1:02:36] into that vineyard to get the fruit of
[1:02:38] it and they always killed him so he said
[1:02:40] his son
[1:02:41] because he thought they would respect
[1:02:42] him and they killed him remember that
[1:02:45] you know and i know it has something to
[1:02:47] do with the prophets that he sent that
[1:02:49] killed him jesus they killed him and so
[1:02:51] forth
[1:02:52] you know
[1:02:53] but they were certainly
[1:02:55] servants
[1:02:56] that were unprofitable
[1:02:59] and
[1:03:00] did not work with the kingdom of god
[1:03:02] they were actually working against the
[1:03:03] kingdom of god isn't that right
[1:03:06] and it talks about how that he says what
[1:03:09] do you think that master of those
[1:03:10] servants will do
[1:03:12] he will take an army and he will
[1:03:14] destroy him the bible says he'll destroy
[1:03:17] him in that right
[1:03:19] but let's look at this one over here
[1:03:21] over in chapter 25 of matthew the
[1:03:24] kingdom of heaven verse 14. the kingdom
[1:03:27] is locked unto a man traveling into a
[1:03:30] far
[1:03:31] country amen
[1:03:36] who called his own servants and
[1:03:38] delivered them
[1:03:40] his
[1:03:41] goods
[1:03:43] how many days the only hand god has is
[1:03:45] yours
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:48] he has hired us over his kingdom
[1:03:53] he has delivered unto us
[1:03:56] all his guts
[1:04:00] that's heavy
[1:04:02] he has put upon us the burden of the
[1:04:04] holy ghost he has put upon us the burden
[1:04:07] of this generation
[1:04:10] martin luther john wesley brother
[1:04:12] abandoned all those preachers they've
[1:04:13] done theirs
[1:04:15] but now how many knows it's our turn
[1:04:20] it's each and every one of our turn to
[1:04:23] do our work to do our job
[1:04:27] amen can i say this
[1:04:29] by the holy spirit let's do our job
[1:04:36] let's do what god has called us to do
[1:04:40] to work in his vineyard
[1:04:44] to go into all the world oh i can tell
[1:04:46] you quote after quote when bible god
[1:04:48] said you know if we're not winning souls
[1:04:50] we have failed we literally fail amen if
[1:04:54] we get our eyes off of anything other
[1:04:56] than winning souls he says his old
[1:04:58] ambition if somebody will say help him
[1:05:00] what is your ambition and my
[1:05:02] ambition is to see
[1:05:04] people come to jesus christ
[1:05:09] there's nothing else eternal that's the
[1:05:11] only thing that you can do
[1:05:13] that's the only place that you can
[1:05:14] invest your treasure where rust don't
[1:05:16] come up corrupt
[1:05:17] and thieves don't break in and steal
[1:05:20] it's on things that are eternal
[1:05:26] amen i'll tell you what it's so easy to
[1:05:27] get caught up in this world in this last
[1:05:29] few minutes
[1:05:32] things that really don't have any
[1:05:34] meaning at all
[1:05:36] no value
[1:05:38] at all
[1:05:41] amen
[1:05:43] he delivered them under his goods to the
[1:05:44] one who gave five talents into another
[1:05:48] one
[1:05:49] all right five talents
[1:05:51] two to another and to another he gave
[1:05:54] one
[1:05:56] according to his several ability
[1:05:59] and straightway he took his journey
[1:06:02] amen we know that the five went got five
[1:06:05] more the three went and got three more
[1:06:07] but the one he went and hit his talent
[1:06:10] he was a silent christian
[1:06:13] you know
[1:06:14] he was a christian that didn't really
[1:06:16] win another soul
[1:06:18] he didn't take this talent and do
[1:06:20] something for the lord
[1:06:22] but he did it
[1:06:24] amen and whenever the lord came back and
[1:06:26] he asked him what did you do with what i
[1:06:28] gave you
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:34] let me tell you something how many
[1:06:35] believes that god
[1:06:36] is i believe that god has given me
[1:06:39] the gift of a pastor
[1:06:42] he gave gifts unto men
[1:06:46] if you're a preacher god has to give
[1:06:47] that gift to you
[1:06:49] i've seen and had too many in my pulpit
[1:06:51] already that wanted to preach but they
[1:06:53] didn't have the gift
[1:06:55] but nowhere
[1:06:56] i'm going to give anybody a try
[1:06:59] hey if you don't have the gift just
[1:07:01] forget it
[1:07:03] you can't manufacture it
[1:07:07] come up i've had people come up here
[1:07:09] amen and
[1:07:10] promote carnality that's the way you
[1:07:13] handle it
[1:07:15] hey i get kind of myself sometime and
[1:07:17] preach and i gotta repent of that stuff
[1:07:19] but when i see that that's that's their
[1:07:21] purpose that's their goal that's what
[1:07:22] they really like
[1:07:24] i said that gift ain't there
[1:07:26] and amen
[1:07:28] but if god has given me a gift of
[1:07:29] pastoring lord help me
[1:07:32] that's what i'll answer for
[1:07:34] i'll answer for how i use the gift that
[1:07:37] god gave me
[1:07:42] boy i'll tell you what
[1:07:44] it's not it when you look at it and you
[1:07:46] realize the responsibility of it you
[1:07:48] don't want it
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:51] you'd rather not
[1:07:53] but if you don't you give the answer for
[1:07:55] what you did
[1:07:58] you're in it you might as well go do
[1:08:01] what god wants you to do or you'll be in
[1:08:02] a whole lot of trouble
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:06] every man according to his ability
[1:08:12] first corinthians says god has said some
[1:08:14] in the church first apostles
[1:08:17] secondary prophets certainly teachers
[1:08:19] after that miracles gifts of healing
[1:08:22] helps
[1:08:23] all right
[1:08:24] governments
[1:08:26] diversities of tongues are all apostles
[1:08:29] are all prophets or all teachers are all
[1:08:32] workers of miracles
[1:08:35] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:08:36] speak with tongues who all interpreted
[1:08:39] see that was the problem with pentecost
[1:08:41] they thought everybody should speak in
[1:08:42] tongues everybody should interpret
[1:08:45] god never meant that that way
[1:08:48] certain people have gifts of that
[1:08:49] they'll have gifts to that and so forth
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:55] ah
[1:08:56] i don't know if i should say it but it
[1:08:57] came into my imagination
[1:08:59] can you imagine if all you saw up here
[1:09:02] was lips moving
[1:09:04] the rest of my body's gone everything
[1:09:05] was just lips
[1:09:07] just speaking
[1:09:08] huh
[1:09:09] it's all hands it's all head it's all
[1:09:11] body it's all female there's a whole
[1:09:14] body it looks a lot better it is for you
[1:09:15] don't it
[1:09:17] yeah you'd be looking like what's up
[1:09:19] there good gracious all i'm seeing his
[1:09:22] mouth move
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:25] but that's what he's saying
[1:09:28] are all apostles all prophets amen
[1:09:32] in another place it's just across the
[1:09:33] page he says he says you know uh if the
[1:09:36] whole body we're an eye where
[1:09:39] if the whole we're hearing where were
[1:09:41] the spelman am i right
[1:09:43] i may believe we're all a part of body
[1:09:45] and especially a body like this
[1:09:49] and everybody out there cause some of
[1:09:50] people you some of y'all might wonder
[1:09:52] well what is my gift what what the lord
[1:09:54] wants me to do
[1:09:57] what is my talent
[1:10:00] y'all pretty quiet now
[1:10:03] all right listen have all the
[1:10:04] interpretation but covet lyrically the
[1:10:06] best gifts and yet i show you a more
[1:10:08] excellent way so we see that god divides
[1:10:11] only as he will he gives some this and
[1:10:15] some that we all know that right gives
[1:10:17] us all a different thing something else
[1:10:19] to do
[1:10:21] something to do for the kingdom of god
[1:10:25] my job is to be up here to preach the
[1:10:27] gospel
[1:10:29] amen
[1:10:30] that's what i'm to do that's what god
[1:10:32] has taught me to do to be a witness
[1:10:33] wherever i go whatever i'm doing
[1:10:36] and he's called each and every one of us
[1:10:38] to do this amen to be a witness in our
[1:10:40] corner of the world
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:47] because sometimes i think
[1:10:48] lord
[1:10:50] in my younger life
[1:10:52] i thought of going to africa i thought
[1:10:54] about going here and being a witness and
[1:10:57] uh you know perhaps getting uh
[1:11:00] in danger
[1:11:02] you know because they don't want to hear
[1:11:03] the gospel getting run out and
[1:11:04] threatened to get spirits through or
[1:11:07] doing challenging things and being bold
[1:11:09] for the faith you know
[1:11:12] but god i've never once done those
[1:11:14] things
[1:11:15] and but the
[1:11:16] comes back this is what i called you to
[1:11:18] do
[1:11:19] but i wanted you over there if i wanted
[1:11:20] you to do nothing i'd have to do that i
[1:11:23] mean god always makes a way for his
[1:11:25] gifts
[1:11:26] god opened the door for me to be here to
[1:11:28] do what i do here
[1:11:29] how many does it juicy where you sit for
[1:11:31] a purpose
[1:11:33] and for a reason
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:37] you might think well i i can't preach
[1:11:40] didn't let them say that you know you
[1:11:42] know a certain person or sister maybe or
[1:11:44] somebody
[1:11:45] like says well i brought about him i
[1:11:46] can't preach i can't do much he says but
[1:11:48] yeah you can pray
[1:11:50] you can pray for the prophet you can
[1:11:52] pray for the preacher and they're right
[1:11:54] how many prays for the preacher before
[1:11:56] coming to church during the week pray
[1:11:58] that is what you're supposed to do
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] whatever it might be
[1:12:04] all the different things you can do
[1:12:06] but work for his king to find something
[1:12:08] for him to do
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:11] well i just sing a special once in a
[1:12:13] while have you got any idea how that
[1:12:14] blesses somebody when you do that

[1:12:19] special

[1:12:27] have to have the perfect voice

[1:12:39] hold it as long as you can and tell you
[1:12:41] about pass out
[1:12:43] all i ask all of you to do is to sing it
[1:12:46] from your heart
[1:12:50] don't you just love to hear somebody to
[1:12:53] sing not because they want you to hear
[1:12:55] their pretty voice
[1:12:59] but because you you can just feel it

[1:13:06] amen it's a blessing
[1:13:09] well i don't do nothing yeah you're

[1:13:54] in doing giving you a talent in
[1:13:57] amen maybe he's blessed you in making
[1:13:59] money
[1:14:02] maybe you make a lot of money
[1:14:05] you may never have to answer whether you
[1:14:07] preached or not or just out of the other
[1:14:08] but god will say what did you do with
[1:14:10] your money
[1:14:11] what did you do with all that money i
[1:14:13] let you make how did you handle it
[1:14:16] that's what you'll have to give an
[1:14:17] account for
[1:14:19] amen because we the bottom of the bible
[1:14:21] talks about it now i mean the ls
[1:14:22] everything's for god in its place
[1:14:26] you might not be able to go but what did
[1:14:28] the father say
[1:14:30] if you can't go send somebody
[1:14:35] oh hallelujah remember the little old
[1:14:38] lady that was inspired to have a meeting
[1:14:40] in some horse stable isn't it some horse
[1:14:42] everyone she cleaned that thing up
[1:14:44] properly freshly started hey man put
[1:14:46] tracks out we're gonna have a meeting

[1:14:51] some bib overalls
[1:14:53] country looking guy
[1:14:55] wasn't it dwight moody
[1:14:58] i think he was like moody right brother
[1:15:00] amen he gave his heart to god and won
[1:15:02] millions
[1:15:08] sometimes that that woman will be
[1:15:09] credited
[1:15:10] she'll be credited for all that
[1:15:12] that little something that you do
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] just that little something
[1:15:18] that you do
[1:15:20] in the kingdom of god
[1:15:22] not even a cup of cold water can be
[1:15:24] given to one of god's children but
[1:15:25] taught you get a reward for it
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:32] as it gets darker
[1:15:34] i'm no you shine biter
[1:15:37] brother's got a decent haircut wear
[1:15:39] decent clothes you sisters go out there
[1:15:41] in walmart
[1:15:43] everybody looks at you
[1:15:47] look at that sister with that long grass
[1:15:49] and skirt
[1:15:50] that is so odd
[1:15:53] huh
[1:15:55] and now i guarantee you there's one
[1:15:57] thing
[1:15:59] they will try to snuff that light out
[1:16:01] because that's their conscience
[1:16:03] you're the only conscience this world
[1:16:05] has anymore
[1:16:07] isn't that right
[1:16:08] it breaks their constant they realize
[1:16:11] that's how you're supposed to be
[1:16:13] that's how you're supposed to dress
[1:16:16] and then that's how you're supposed to
[1:16:17] act
[1:16:19] it's getting dark the hour is getting
[1:16:21] late
[1:16:23] i don't know about you but i say lord
[1:16:25] help me
[1:16:26] to do my job
[1:16:28] better
[1:16:30] or i don't want to regret i don't want
[1:16:32] to come down to the end of my life and
[1:16:33] say oh i just didn't do what i i still
[1:16:36] but
[1:16:38] still you feel like an unprofitable
[1:16:39] servant
[1:16:41] you still feel like lord i just haven't
[1:16:42] done nothing
[1:16:44] how many
[1:16:45] i just really don't feel that i've done
[1:16:48] my share i have not done as much for the
[1:16:50] kingdom of god as what i should have
[1:16:54] i sure like the two more
[1:16:57] amen didn't brother ma'am say that about
[1:16:58] himself he says i've won millions
[1:17:00] i should have won 10 millions with the
[1:17:02] gift that god has given me
[1:17:04] that gift that god had given him of
[1:17:06] discernment
[1:17:08] of healing
[1:17:09] faith
[1:17:12] oh my
[1:17:19] the gifts of being able to say if i've
[1:17:21] told you the truth and jesus don't show
[1:17:23] up here you call me a false prophet and
[1:17:26] run me out of your town
[1:17:28] guess what he never got run out of town
[1:17:31] because jesus always would come
[1:17:34] and he would prove that what he said was
[1:17:35] the truth
[1:17:38] the sacred could heal dead would be
[1:17:40] raised
[1:17:41] people would give their lives the lord
[1:17:44] he tell people lord if you've been
[1:17:45] unfaithful to your marriage vows if
[1:17:47] you've done this that or the other god
[1:17:49] is willing to forgive you if you'll give
[1:17:50] your heart to god here
[1:17:52] some of the worst kind of sins the
[1:17:54] horriblest things that a person could
[1:17:56] commit it says god will be given for you
[1:17:58] if you'll just be willing to repent
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:03] your christ come down and vindicate like
[1:18:05] that do great miracles and signs and
[1:18:08] wonders
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:11] maybe like i said maybe you should
[1:18:13] support the pastor
[1:18:15] you say well i don't do nothing you do
[1:18:16] that and the god and perhaps the pastor
[1:18:19] preaching amen people come give their
[1:18:22] hearts alive people are saved that way
[1:18:24] you're supporting a cause isn't that
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:28] because you're supporting the church of
[1:18:30] the living god
[1:18:31] how many his beliefs i don't the church
[1:18:33] of god maybe god is universal
[1:18:36] not just one place but
[1:18:38] everywhere you love him
[1:18:42] i love him with all my heart and i just
[1:18:44] want to do something
[1:18:46] that's pleasing to him
[1:18:48] let's look at another one shall we
[1:18:55] oh my when i thought about this i says
[1:18:57] you know we preach so much about being
[1:18:59] saved predestinated but how much do we
[1:19:01] really speak about
[1:19:03] working in the vineyard and doing
[1:19:05] something
[1:19:06] how many knows that for most of us
[1:19:08] and myself that means
[1:19:11] being a light to your neighbor
[1:19:15] right
[1:19:17] a light to your neighbor which
[1:19:19] every one of us can probably say lord
[1:19:20] help me isn't that right
[1:19:23] help me to be a better light to my
[1:19:24] neighbor
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:28] all right
[1:19:29] luke 17 i want to talk about the
[1:19:32] attitude
[1:19:33] of the laborer what kind of an attitude
[1:19:36] that we should have
[1:19:38] as servants
[1:19:40] as higher laborers
[1:19:42] as workers
[1:19:44] who have been given a talent of some
[1:19:46] kind
[1:19:48] for the kingdom of god
[1:19:53] all right luke 17.
[1:19:56] we'll begin with verse
[1:19:58] 6.
[1:19:59] the lord said if you had faith as the
[1:20:01] grain of a mustard seed
[1:20:02] you might say unto this sycamore tree
[1:20:06] and it's not sycamore
[1:20:10] sick of mine
[1:20:12] something like that
[1:20:14] be that plucked up by the roots and be
[1:20:16] that cast
[1:20:17] into the sea and it should should obey
[1:20:20] you
[1:20:21] which of you but
[1:20:23] which of you in other words if you have
[1:20:26] great faith that's wonderful
[1:20:28] but which of you having a servant
[1:20:29] plowing
[1:20:31] or feeding cattle will say unto him by
[1:20:34] and by
[1:20:36] when he is come from the field go and
[1:20:38] sit down to meet
[1:20:40] or will he rather not say unto him
[1:20:43] make ready wherewith i may sup
[1:20:47] and gird thyself and serve me
[1:20:51] till i have eaten and drunken and
[1:20:53] afterwards thou shalt eat and drink
[1:20:56] does he thank that servant because he
[1:20:58] did the things
[1:21:00] or commanded him
[1:21:03] huh
[1:21:05] thank you thank you
[1:21:06] in other words he said the master don't
[1:21:08] look i hired you i paid for you paid for
[1:21:11] you to do this i hired you to do you're
[1:21:13] my servant
[1:21:14] he don't thank him for all that
[1:21:19] now this is kind of different coming
[1:21:20] from jesus right
[1:21:22] what did jesus say i throw not
[1:21:25] now
[1:21:26] that must be
[1:21:29] a
[1:21:30] throw that's new to me and i throw not
[1:21:33] what are we throwing right
[1:21:35] but from what i understand he says i i
[1:21:37] bet not
[1:21:39] i think not
[1:21:40] so that we'd understand right no nothing
[1:21:43] he's saying no he doesn't think him
[1:21:46] so likewise ye when you shall have done
[1:21:49] all these things which are commanded you
[1:21:53] say
[1:21:54] we are unprofitable servants we have
[1:21:57] done
[1:21:58] that which is our
[1:22:00] duty
[1:22:02] to do
[1:22:06] folks let me say this
[1:22:08] any servant doesn't matter who it is me
[1:22:10] anybody once you think you're something
[1:22:13] or you've done something for god
[1:22:17] oh you're not at the place you ought to
[1:22:19] be
[1:22:20] you're at the place where you ought to
[1:22:22] be realized i really haven't done
[1:22:25] nothing yet
[1:22:27] i just did what you commanded me to do
[1:22:30] i may believe with god we should go the
[1:22:32] extra mile lord i should have done so
[1:22:35] much more
[1:22:38] how many of our older folks is the
[1:22:40] afternoon can say with me i feel like i
[1:22:43] should have done so much more
[1:22:46] for the lord
[1:22:48] i still feel like an unprofitable
[1:22:52] servant
[1:22:58] lord help me
[1:23:01] i still feel like an unprofitable
[1:23:03] servant
[1:23:04] i can see why brother ben of all he did
[1:23:07] he would say forgive and help your
[1:23:09] unprofitable servant
[1:23:13] because we're just doing
[1:23:14] what god has asked us to do
[1:23:17] now how many of us would have to be
[1:23:18] honest with ourselves
[1:23:20] and say well i barely do that sometimes
[1:23:23] i barely do that sometimes just doing
[1:23:25] what god said do
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:33] god bless you let's stand if you will
[1:23:35] with me this morning
[1:23:39] musicians you can come with our heads
[1:23:41] bowed
[1:23:48] i stand here with a heavy heart
[1:23:51] this morning
[1:23:53] because i feel the lateness
[1:23:55] of the day
[1:23:58] i feel that the day is far spent
[1:24:01] it's just upon us
[1:24:05] i feel the holy spirit crying out in me
[1:24:09] calling out to you
[1:24:11] why are we so
[1:24:13] overly
[1:24:14] concerned
[1:24:16] about the things of this world
[1:24:19] when really
[1:24:20] our whole ambition
[1:24:23] is to soon
[1:24:24] leave this world
[1:24:27] we can't stay here much longer
[1:24:31] you won't have a chance to do anything
[1:24:34] when it gets totally dark
[1:24:37] when it's dark it's dark when it's over
[1:24:41] it's over
[1:24:44] search your heart
[1:24:46] look at the opportunities
[1:24:47] that you've missed
[1:24:49] i look at the opportunities
[1:24:52] that i've missed
[1:24:56] i've not been as bold
[1:24:58] as like what paul said pray that i could
[1:25:01] speak with boldness
[1:25:03] the devil and his people they're very
[1:25:05] bold
[1:25:07] with their agenda but where's where are
[1:25:09] we at as christians with ours
[1:25:12] to spread the light stand for what's
[1:25:14] right

[1:25:26] my heart you can have it too
[1:25:29] i have this peace in my heart you can
[1:25:31] have it too

[1:25:38] that he died for the whole sins of the
[1:25:40] whole world
[1:25:42] the same gospel he began to preach
[1:25:44] on the day of pentecost repent world
