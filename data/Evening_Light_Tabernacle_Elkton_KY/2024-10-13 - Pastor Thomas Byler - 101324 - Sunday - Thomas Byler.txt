TRANSCRIPT
========================================
make sure you can get to where you're going so I told the kids listen I guess I'm speaking to myself to make sure pay attention because we get so so off track sometimes the devil if he's going to put anything on your mind he's going to put it on your mind on Sunday morning so it's good for us to pay attention but Psalms 37 we're going to go and uh we're starting in verse 20 but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of the Lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away way for such as he be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be C cursed of him shall be cut off though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue tth of judgment the wicked watch the righteous and seeketh to slay him wait on the Lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off though shalt Thou shalt see him yet he passed away and lo he was not yeah he sought him but he could not be found but the transgressors shall be destroyed together and the end of the wicked shall be cut off this one together and the Lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him amen God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters you know there's a lot of Truth to what brother TR was saying I guess being land lovers like we are it's hard to realize how important a compass is unless you've actually used one you know your Bible is your compass if you've ever flown an airplane or been out at sea or Compass you have this morning you're not going to make it on the other side you're not going to be able to follow the path to get you to where you want to be this morning and uh I was just going to mention this this morning I hope I didn't lose my uh from from Wednesday night I was going to to say that uh I was just thinking there this morning i' probably been doing the treasury here since I think 2003 it's been almost 20 years and after the offering on Wednesday I can say you know I'm I'm not a warrior it's never been my nature to be a warrior I I mean I have to just commit things to God's hands and no matter what's happened over the years with us God has always provided and you have to believe that you have to have the faith to believe that God is always going to provide does it mean that you don't go through hard situations no there's no no human being has any guarantees but you have to have faith to believe that God's going to bring you out on the other side so the the offering that I have wrote down from Wednesday is $222,000 635 so that that's a pretty good size offering so God is more than able to touch people heart and make things happen so I can just tell you as a Treasurer there's been many of times where if if you looking at the situation what we going to be able to go through it and I can tell you God has always provided for us when we ever needed to provide it and um I can't right now we've uh there's a lot of bills that been paid in the church and I know I gave a report a couple of weeks ago but there were some other expenses from the summer until October uh uh so instead of I I think I told you all about $77,000 but when I edit it all back up again uh for the meetings and everything from August until now for stuff we've done around the church we probably spent about $88,500 but getting on to something more important just I I can't say it enough I been doing this a long time I have never seen God not it might not be the way that I expected it to be it might not be what I actually prayed for in my life but God always meets the needs and I have that I'm not afraid to say that because I know that God no matter what the circumstances are he will meet the need this morning and I if you want to turn to the uh 12th and thir and 13th chapter of Hebrews I'm not going to take a lot of time this morning but I I was reading this one devotional and it goes back before I read this it goes back to the gospel you know Jesus in Matthew 5 and 6 and 7 when he's doing pre teaching the people in the Beatitudes you know he talks about the lies of the fields and the birds in the and the birds he God meets their needs supplies their needs without them worrying or caring about the things that are going on and it's the same for you God will meet your need he supplies the need as you need it and this is this is what this man wrote years ago not majoring on it but I thought it was funny It Go but to where what we believe this morning you know all of us believe that we got something waiting for us on the other side something is drawing us to the other side this morning and uh we know God's word says that and we know the message of the hour says that but this is what this is a par couple of paragraphs here and and he kind of strikes it here there's a sense of Exile in all our hearts and all of us feel that this morning and the Exile is we're separated from being with Christ this morning not in a spiritual sense but in the physical way we're not in heaven yet and there comes to most men now and then a sense that the Earth is alien Shore and we sure believe that some theologians say this sense of Exile is due to the fall of Man and that's trueth there we're exiled and this body's exiled our spirit isn't exiled by his sin man has broken the original Harmony and has lost the environment for which he was created as the birds with broken pinion and the poet said this since the Exile is in us God is our home and like water seeking its own level we are seeking the ocean from where we come from and that's us this morning our spirit this morning and everyone here is seeking to be in the presence of Jesus Christ this morning I hope that's what everyone's desire is this morning and uh I lost my place it's our Glory that we yearn for the heights beyond our reach and we are searching for something lost behind the ranges and seek a comp a completeness and a self-re realization of which our Earthly environment is too limited and that's true this flesh we have is kind of limited this morning but the spirit that in us that God's going to redeem one day that's not going to be lious have any limits that day and when all is said in the sense of Exile hunger we have said nothing saves that we are hungry for God and for righteousness to me the most precious promise of Jesus is that who hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be satisfied and that's true this morning the more you hunger after the Lord the more you desire him the more he feeds you and the pro that promise of course makes the necessity of an afterlife for no soul is ever satisfied in this world and I was just thinking this he's talking about an ancient um Persian quote here and it kind of speaks to what brother Bram was talking about the ancient pers said that the death death a man's soul is met by an Angel who says I am the image of your in of your interrupted ideas and unfulfilled strivings and I don't believe that but he goes on to say I'm your true self all you tried to be wanted to be but failed to be I am but we shall merge into one being as one is I don't believe that but what I believe that everyone here this morning has a theophany Laten on them on the other side how God seen you in the F in the very creation of the world and that's what we're striving to move toward in our lives is to be on that other side to take possession of that L that God I'm not pronouncing that right you have to forgive my pronunciation but that's what God desires us to move to one day and uh let me just read a few scriptures and I'll sit down so brother Brad can talk about what happened on Thursday but uh I'll just read out of the 13th chapter of Hebrews and sit down but I was just thinking this morning this is a crazy world that we live in it's a crazy place I don't even like talking about it don't like mention the things they do out there in the world anymore it's not edifying you know to bring it to the house of God but it just lets me know in my spirit that the time is close do I know exactly when it's going to be no I don't know exactly when it's going to be but the evidence I see in the outside world the darkness that I see lets me know that it can't be that far off and it's in God's hands where when it's going to happen and I'll just read what this has to say this is the 13th chapter the first few verses here let Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers thereby some have entertain entertained angels unaware and that's really true um remember that your in bonds is bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body marriage is Honorable in all and the bed on the file but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge that speaks to the the age we live in right now that your conversation be without coveted this that speaks to the age we're in it's very Covetous age be content with such things as you have had for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee and then in the sixth verse it says so that we Mo boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will I will not fear what men shall do unto me and I you have to really hold that close to your heart because remember what brother Thomas was mentioning the there's coming a day what what we believe just people won't be able to stomach it anymore they'll get so angry with you because you believe what you believe they'll wind up trying to kill you one day and remember them which have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith followed considered the end of their conversation and we all know this scripture Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and be not carried away about by diverse strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have not profited them which have been occupied therein and then I'll just finish with this we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which is save the Tabernacle I'll leave there the only thing I'd like to say is it's a very I was uh as a young kid I've always been interested you know and rocketry and stuff like that and some of you probably know that the SpaceX people were able to land 100 foot cylinder in a tower and now you would think to yourself the technology required to do something like that but the point I'm going to is brother random said that we're you know we're in that astronaut age and it's the technology out there in the world is just accelerating and acceler ating and accelerating there's no way of stopping it anymore and it goes back to me what he was talking about in the days of Noah the very technology that the Earth has right now is the same technology brother Bram said man will always destroy thems of God doesn't step in because men don't know when to stop they just keep going and going and going but I think it there's always if there's a negative there's always a positive and the positive for us that God has no breaks for you this morning any promise any desire that you have that come from through the word of God that can find its way through all the promises of God it's here for you this morning if you'll just reach out in faith and accept it this morning so as they go one way we all need to be going another way and there's nothing stopping us either you can have more of God this morning and the only thing limiting you this morning is your own faith and your own desire to do greater things for your Lord this morning brother Brian thank you brother Brian it's a good day to be a Christian amen certainly thankful for what God is doing and and done in the in this church and just to give a a quick update and I was uh thinking I don't want to take much time but there there just stuff keeps coming to me but uh we were able to make a delivery on Thursday and and uh was quite impressive uh with what the church here has done and what the community has done um and you know I was thinking about that and I thought you know um we always are wanting to uh be Christlike and and that's what a Christian is is Christlike and that's ministering to others uh and you often times we wonder what can I do I'm not a preacher I'm not a deacon I'm not this I'm not that but ministering to others through what you've done is is just just great and and it's it's just it just Thrills my Soul so you know I was thinking Jesus you know and and even he had to be ministered to and he told us in in the Book of Matthew 25 he said when I was thirsty you gave me drink when I was hungry you gave me food when I was naked you you gave me clothes when I was a stranger you took me in so we don't have to know these people to help these people but it's our duty to help our our brothers and sisters and neighbors and you know uh you you see the stories and and you you think well man I I could be so angry at the government for not doing what they should be doing when you hear these stories well as Believers we we shouldn't even be angry it shouldn't even affect us because we we're not dependent upon the government we're not I mean if something happened to us are they coming we we depend on God and and and if we take you know take that attitude that's what that's what the the way the the church was set up to take care of each other before governments were even established the church took care of each other the the sister that took the alabaster box she ministered to Jesus and she ministered her she poured out what she had to give to Jesus and we see Jesus go and feed 5,000 plus women and children probably 20,000 people he was ministering to the people so uh I'm encouraged to to know what what the church has done here with just uh just uh the people getting out and and sharing what what we're trying to do who we trying to help and what what's behind us so as we come went in the other day we were able to deliver and I tell you the The Word of Life Church and brother Michael Bailey his coordination there is is quite impressive um we pulled up with if anybody saw in the back of our truck it was four pallets it was about uh 5400 lbs of clothes food and boxes and heavy stuff and so we pulled up and he said hey we're we're eating lunch right now would w should just come in and and have a bite and we'll unload this truck when we get done so I said okay so we go in and we're sitting down and having lunch and a few minutes pass and the sister comes by with a microphone and she says brother Michael about everybody's done eating do you want us to unload the truck and he said yeah go ahead and and take care of it and she got on that microphone and she said listen we need so and so's group to go unload the truck so and so's group she had them busted up in teams you be at the Sorting table and I'm going to tell you brothers and sisters in 15 minutes time they had the trailer unloaded sorted and put on tables it was quite incredible so I thought you know these these people are they're all in they're dedicated and joas was talking to brother Daryl and he said you know Sister Joyce we went up into the mountains the other day and and they reached some people who said they haven't seen another human in nine days right nine days eight or nine days and just the gratitude that they have for for the efforts that's been put forth and and knowing that you know and they say hey we we could we couldn't have made it we wasn't going to be able to keep going without you guys reaching us and you know the and I'm like I said I'm not politicizing this thing but I do know when brother darl brother Michael and the the Saints up there tell you that they're bypassing those that are on the main roads to get to those that can't get out they can't get to the town they can't get to help and they're dropping off supplies and then you know and they tell you the soon as they drop them off the supplies are gone by the end of the day uh or when they drop them off they just raise their hands and praising the Lord and crying in tears because somebody cared enough and so uh that's you you done that ministering those people are are alive and and eating and and warm because of the efforts that you've made and and so thankful to the church for that um we uh we are still doing doing the work this week and and trying to keep things moving for at least this week I do know uh as far as food right now uh we will take what we get in because that's what it's designated for and we have several people that's doing things I I think the Beta Club at the high school are they doing canned good still and and other stuff too so they're going to be bringing stuff in several churches that have been in contact I think with us are are going to probably be bringing some stuff in but what I asked brother Michael what are the needs today and the need today is generators um so that they can have heat and Refrigeration um they don't expect the power to be turned back on up in some of those remote places at the earliest would be January so um you know we're getting cold here just take a few 10 degrees off and go into the mountains and think how cool it's getting up there so um blankets uh you know good good you know we we would like and and I'm going to share this with the church here and if anybody sees it it'll probably be within our Circle anyway uh but they they've had to sort they've had so much clothing and stuff brought in that was you know just it was an empty out and and people with good intentions but uh they had to leave everything outside because things just wasn't clean you you know what I'm saying things wasn't clean wasn't in well-kept and so they had to leave and had to go through it they spent like eight hours going through stuff uh to make sure that that stuff was good and clean and and they had to discard what what wasn't so really we need good clean uh new stuff if possible and and I know you know people do what they can do and give what they can give and very appreciative of all of that uh but let's just be conscious that these have to have wear left in them you know it's not the these clothes may be the only clothes for one or two outfits for just a couple of you know for two or three months for a while so they have to have a lot of wear in them uh so you get what I'm saying I'm not going to go too deep into that but um so our drive this week um and brother John and and I'll just tell you he has he has went above and beyond and he has he said well they need generators we're going to get them generators and I said well I'll make some phone calls you make some phone calls we'll find some generators and we'll see what we can do and um so he he called me I got four I got four paid for and he called me back I got two more paid for I got four more paid for and I think now we're up to 15 that has been spoken for 15 generators um I've been calling brother John's been on on the phone he finally made the connection with Cabellas and Cabellas is going to offer a discounted price uh in the next probably tomorrow he'll make an order but John said I'm put I'm we're our church he said I feel 100% sure we can do 40 there's there's a book somebody wrote it's a business book and it said whatever you think you need as it's called times 10 as times 10 and so he said we can do 40 I said okay okay we can do 40 now you say man this church has given and given and and until we've about you know probably give all we can probably give but what he did he went through his phone and he just started seeing looking at his contacts and he went alphabetically from A to Z and started just texting hey our church is doing this it's you know they need heat they need generators they need power they're not going to have power would you be interested I I'll take one and tell them how much that's what he did so if you wonder how to how to sell just go to your phone and start selling so uh but do what you can do I know everybody's busy but that is kind of our goal this week and and we're headed in the right direction we've got funds coming in I know the the school uh Carson school is going to do a uh a a fund Fund Raising Drive fill The Jug and they're going to have competitions between their classes to try to see who can raise the most money to go towards these generators extension cords those kinds of things so I just want to let you know where the need is what the direction that has shifted and U and when John told me 40 I'm thinking okay that's that's a big that's a tall order I thought I better call brother Michael Bailey and make sure he can distribute 40 you know we don't want to just put a bunch in there and I said brother Michael how many generators can you distribute because we're thinking about sending a tractor and trailer load he said yeah boy send them on so that was his response and uh the need is great um and you know the thing is you say well man we're just keep hearing about this but you know as well as I do it doesn't matter if it's a if it's a death in a family if it's a disaster after two weeks that is kind of Forgotten is that right you know it's for the first week two weeks everybody calls everybody's there you got all you know all this help but then life goes on with that circle of people and before you know it you're you're still suffering but everybody else is back to their regular daily lives and so that's what brother Michael stressed he said listen we need all the food we got we will get rid of all of it it will be needed because this is going to last for he said this is not going to last for two more weeks this is going to last for two more years you know um the need that they're going to have up there so um very thankful for the church I just want to give you a heads up and let you know what was going on and and where your efforts have went and proud of proud to proud to say I'm a part of evening light Tabernacle and what God has done through this little group of people we're we're just a little group of people but magnificent things have been done through the work of the Holy Ghost and laying on your hearts to give and to ask and to do and God does

ain't it amen going that long ways and those crazy Maniacs on the road and stuff right everybody else is the maniac not you you know amen so praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen God bless you this morning amen just uh just trying to follow the leading of the spirit just something the little something that the Lord laid on my heart amen and so we're going to try to minister it with the help of the Lord this morning I guess I brought my glasses amen my second set of eyes oh brother uh Aaron Oglesby everybody clear your schedules now we got brother Aaron Oglesby coming Wednesday night he's going to be speaking Wednesday night amen and then we've got brother Joe Adams going to speak next Sunday morning amen so we got a couple good preachers coming and we're looking forward to it and I'm spending some time hunting with them amen up at Junior's camp so we're looking forward to amen being able to just enjoy amen good company amen amen and see what the Lord will have amen by the way of his word praise the Lord turn your Bibles again and we want to pick up on the story that we uh uh read about over in Second Kings Second Kings will start there amen have y'all got my title ready all right put that up for them before we start I'll just give you my scary title amen there it is the windows of Heaven and the Gates of Hell amen there it is up back there all right the windows of Heaven and the Gates of Hell amen and it just I just begin to ponder a little bit Amen on that last story that we read that we're about to read so uh and I'm not going to read uh I'm not going to read it again uh because I want to read a different part this is in 2 Kings 7 if you haven't gotten there 2 Kings 7 and we read about the four lepos men if you all remember last amen last time and how that they uh said but man Samaria if we stay here we die and if we go to the enemy we might get killed but you know we sure are going to die if we stay here so uh let's just go and then when they got got there of course we find that all of the hosts of the syrians or the syrians they were all all gone ain't that right and they went in there and man they got gold and silver and there as much as they gold and rment and hid it and come again another tent and went and hid it and boy they was just having them a jubilee you know amen and so but I want to read chapter 7 verse 1 through two um then Elijah said and let me just before we read don't read ahead of me but listen to this we know that they were in a terrible famine to where even a mother killed its baby and they ate it and then the other mother was supposed to they were supposed to e it eat its child the next day and of course it had hid it so that they couldn't find it and and the woman came to the king and complained and said you know that she ought to do it and of course he was in distraught because of it and then in verse CH verse uh chapter 7 verse one Elijah said Elijah said Elisha said hear ye the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of Samaria then the Lord on Whose hand the king leaned answered theand of God and said behold if the Lord would make Windows in heaven might this thing be amen might this thing be and he said behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shall not eat thereof turn to Malachi this is another place where God talks about the windows of Heaven Malachi 3 but I I just begin to ponder on that thought about the windows of Heaven amen and so and I also got to thinking about the Gates of Hell amen and and what it brings but we know that the man was no doubt trying to express that you know this kind of a good thing that so happen could only happen if God opened up the windows of heaven and poured it out amen how many knows that God is in the business of pouring things out of the windows of Heaven that's right amen windows I mean Heaven has Windows Heaven has a door amen how many believes that heaven has Windows and Heaven has a door how many knows what the door to Heaven is that's right Jesus says I am the door to the Sheepfold amen so he is the door Amen to heaven but we'll maybe get into that a little bit later but in Malachi 3 and this is of course this is where people would go amen if you was going to preach on tithes amen and so forth but I just want to pull out the part about heaven will a verse 8 chapter 3 verse 8 will a man rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me that now herewith sayith the Lord of hosts that I if I will not open you the windows the windows of Heaven ain't that right and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it amen praise the Lord is't that a wonderful scripture amen I will rebuke the Devourer for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field sayith the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land sayth the Lord of hosts praise be to God may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen you know uh we know that the Bible says that we're not supposed to tempt the Lord God ain't that right in other words you don't jump off a building and say well you know the angels are going to Bear the up amen because that's what the devil tried to get Jesus to do and he says Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God but in this case but in this case God go okays you proving him ain't that right he says go ahead and do that and prove me prove me amen and I've said it before I believe that the church here as far as I know everybody paid their tithes and and so I truly believe that it is a blessing of God to do so isin that right amen because you're promised well I don't I don't mean to go here but go to my mind so I might as well ain't that right I mean can you imagine if everybody was cheating on their tithes how much Freedom that the Holy Spirit would have to work it wouldn't be good wouldn't no it wouldn't be good because God would be grieved because nobody's doing what they're supposed to do anyway and so you know sometimes when we do things wrong whatever it might be in your life until you change what you're doing don't expect the windows of Heaven to come open for you you have to change what you're doing amen and start doing something different Amen in order for God to bless that and I can't help but believe that amen you know uh even even behind this Pulpit it doesn't matter who it might be amen when things are in the way that they're supposed to be God promised that he would pour out ain't that right of the windows of Heaven A Blessing ain't that right that there may be he said bring this so that there may be what meat how many knows that's spiritual food Amen in the house of God Amen and so I believe it's not just for the pastor Brother Brad or other ministers amen but I believe it's for whoever might come behind his Pulpit amen God promised that he's going to feed you I don't know about you but oh Lord I'm hungry and I want to be fed I love when the Holy Spirit have Liberty to move amen Windows of Heaven pour out prove me brother Bon when he preached on he says you know this is the one thing that God said that you can prove God on amen he will reuke the Devourer for your sake amen so there we see and I really want to dwell first on the gates of hell if I could for a few minutes amen should really take a whole sermon on each but we'll see if we can't get through it with the help of the Lord amen and see just what he'll have to say Amen praise the Lord Matthew 16 a fam your scripture it says in verse 177 and Jesus answered and said unto him Simon that is blessed art thou Simon bar Jonas for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen so how many knows that that g the hell has some gates that's right we want to talk first of all all what hell brings what hell brings oh my and it ain't good how many knows what hell brings ain't good he'll try to make it look good it'll seem like it's good it'll be glamorous it'll be something yet your flesh will desire it'll be fast it'll be Pride it'll be gy it'll be uh you know all of the Splendor and it'll look like it's good but it'll be death in Disguise isin't that right amen all right see brother benon makes a statement he says brother the lids come off of Hell the lids come off of hell and streams of demons power is pouring from everywhere amen Pandora's box came to mind when I was studying on this Pandora's Box and I didn't really go do any research and so you forgive me and I don't get the story right my wife looked it up a little bit because I asked her about it and I guess it's some kind of a what Greek mythology or something about a man who had a box and they had captured all these curses that right all these curses and and evil things you know that they had put it in this box and he was to take care of it but he trusted his wife with it and said you take care of it I'm understand while she told me that her name was Pandora and she said man how did why did Pandora Nam their music station Pandora you know didn't think turn out so good for Pandora but she said something about you know that this pandard is wife of hers she was so curious I just she couldn't stand it is that right she wanted to know what what what it was that she oped the box and let it all out am man and tried to close it back up but couldn't because it was too late and I thought that story is about right cuz I know another I told I told I told my wife and she kind of cracked at me and I hope she don't mind this morning but I said you know it's kind you know is not to knock women but women are curious maybe women are curious they called they're even called a cat in some cases oh boy I'm going get in trouble this morning tell me something didn't brother bam Talk About Eve she wondered what it would be like she was curious she wanted to see what it would be like so it does bear out amen she was so curious that she opened so to speak pandar SP she opened the floodgates of Hell a that right she opened up the floodgates but said every sickness every ambulance every great hair every feebleness every ache in my arm and my pain every ache anything that ever was caused I'm going to say through Eve isin't that right she opened that box up and there wasn't no cloth in it loose so to speak let go come out the lid come off is that right come off a hell amen amen you know in a way you also hold Pandora's Box because you've got a door to your heart is that right and you got to be careful what you open that heart to amen that's right there many doors am in in the in the area of our life and she opened up and what happened we know that ultimately it was it was The Serpent and ultimately it was the devil because we know the devil got into the serpent is that right and coaxed Eve and spoke to Eve and deceived de and get calized her by saying you know the Lord knows that you know if you take this you're going to be wise it's G to make you smart you're going to know both good and evil you're going to be like us knowing good and evil how much better we'd all been have been perhaps if that had never happened hello but God knew it was going to happen and she opened up that gate and my what flooded in the very Gates of Hell very cursed amen is that what the she opened up the box of curses even God said to Adam I curs this to ground and curs this this that and the other brought a curse amen I'm going to go ahead say what comes to my brain like a lot of message people or people Christian of any kind sometimes just a simple gospel isn't enough they want something a little more and a little deeper and more knowledge and a deeper understanding and a a deeper Revelation and it can get off you can go off if you aren't careful amen that's right cuz the devil will offer you all kinds of things amen so we see that's one place that was one time that this was open the gates of hell so to speak was open and the devil could come in and my the Havoc that he brought brother bab says Satan's Army now notice he says I got to get this Satan's Army he brings diseas us he's a destroyer the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death sorrow frustrations worry amen and that's the two great forces that's coming together right now and they're battling how many knows this morning we come and you sit there and you might have your arms folded but you're doing battle today we're doing battle cuz how many know you got an adversary you got somebody that's going to come against you we don't get to have the freedom of no adversary amen until we get to the other side and the one thing that God is allowing amen is to learn how to fight that adversary how to overcome that adversary praise aren't you glad for that woo we can talk about how Adam grew old how he got fee Eve got old she got feeble she died got headaches got sick got Cuts got wounds all these things that happened to him and all of humanity down through all of time but aren't you glad there's a man that can come and shut that thing back up that's right you become captive I'm going to go slow me I was going to jump ahead but let me just go through some of the things that he brings would that be okay they're battling they're right here in the building right now and they battle day by day with you every Force Satan is following you along that great kingly Priestly Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you trying to bring fear trying to being scar but by God he says you're fortified with the gospel with the word of Truth around your La Glory praise be to God having on the helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith the swords waving in your hand Satan I'm coming to meet you amen how many know you got to meet him amen I believe that you could scream out today to the whole world you have to choose your master Every Soul that hears the gospel is and the gospel is this that you have to choose your master Jesus says you can't serve both you have to choose which Master you're going to serve cuz you will serve one or the other you have no choice you must serve one or the other number two you must decide which one you're going to serve you must make that decision that decision is forced upon every human being so make your choice just as you are sure to have one or the other Final Destination heaven or the Lake of Fire destruction that's right you have to go one to the or the other no matter how much you Mumble and disbelieve and try for it not to be it will be that's right amen if you try to say there's no heaven and there's no hell you're just fooling yourself how foolish is somebody to fool theirself that's not very wise to fool yourself face the facts amen is there a God yeah we had his picture taken from with him right there's the picture of almighty God the pillar of fire you want evidence there it is and we got 1100 tapes where God come down in a mighty way and proved himself proved himself alive that he really is and you got to go down in the basement say and be stupid and go to hell the only way that you'll ignore it is to willfully not believe it amen praise be to God he brings these things that's what hell brings that's what the Gates of Hell bring amen how many know demons are tormentors he brings torment the devil will offer drink and booze and whiskey and and drugs to make everybody feel make them feel like oh they're just in a wonderful world but when that wears off the guilt is still there it's a substitute they think they're having a good time but they're not dealing with the real issues how many's glad that we can deal with the issues of our life they can be dealt with condemnation can be dealt with because we were all born in sin shape and iniquity and that condemnation has to be dealt with you'll try to deal with it through drugs and so forth but it'll never do the job it'll never take care of the problem like my wife always says problem solved right that's right all right praise the Lord Tormentor that's right amen when Adam and Eve did what they did they sold us out to the devil and we become captive how manyan we become a captive to the devil we were captured we were enslaved we were in the pawn shop we couldn't get away if we tried how many's glad not to be there anymore that's right thank you Lord I hope you feel I hope you know what it's like woo to be set free amen because that's what heaven's Windows does amen notice the devil captures people he holds them captive and how many knows the Bible says that he does not release his captives no he never releases them and because he doesn't release them they are in despair that right they despair Paul said it this way we are troubled on every side we're troubled on every side but yet not distressed how many knows we're living in a world that's distressed amen suicide on the Rampage people are distressed they're under stress Under Pressure yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair despair is when you want to change something try to change something and you can't you just simply can't it's despair it's a terrible place to be that's where the devil takes people that's what the devil brings captivity amen he brings guilt amen condemnation condemned why I don't think we appreciate enough the fact that we're no there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that condemnation that guilt what people don't do amen when that's not dealt with a guilty conscience amen fear scare brother Braham says he follows you tries to scare the liver out of you that's right he brings a fear they're afraid this is going to happen afraid that's going to happen afraid oh people say they're not afraid but brother B says all these jokes and everything that America's got going on out there it's just a person walking by the graveyard trying to make a joke trying to act like they're not scared they better be scared and they are amen that's right downcast the blues sorrow depression oppression forsakenness forsakenness amen how many of those drugs that come down there close to their overdose close to overdosing let me ask you something does the devil ever deliver them does he ever help them no he can't he's not a deliverer he's the one that puts him in that place when they get to that place he only laughs that's his Joy is to destroy he's a destroy Destroyer hell brings destruction hell brings division hell brings differences just comes to mind not even Wroten down but our little differences that we have sometime like the Pentecost well he's coming on a White Horse no he's coming on a cloud well we're going to have to just part ways over that was that God or was that the devil brother B said it was the devil amen so how many knows the devil's quite obvious amen amen what he brings anden hey praise the Lord listen how how many how many's glad that Jesus said I'll never forsake you amen when the windows of Heaven get poured open when he God begins to pour out from the windows of Heaven amen what happens when God pours out his blessings from the windows of Heaven it can change a whole Service and bring a complete different atmosphere a Heavenly atmosphere a Heavenly atmosphere amen all right so listen to this sin he brings sin which is the biggest you realize that sin is what unbelief the one thing that the devil does that is most catastrophic is to cause a person to not believe to disbelieve cuz that shuts off any blessings of God to that person it shuts off Heaven from that to that person because they have to believe all things are possible to them that believe but if disbelief to disbelief is to miss the Mark it's sin amen so brother Brown didn't he say the worst sin is or the W worst thing is unbelief that's the worst sin there is the sin of unbelief amen isn't that exactly what he brought to E believe got her to question God's word not believe that it's actually he's actually going you're actually going to die amen he brings sicknesses such as high blood pressure diabetes epilepsy cancer amen he brings Envy jealousy hatred meanness murder anger lust all those things is what the devil brings makes you jealous of this person or Envy towards that person or hateful towards this person or that person that's what he brings that's right amen or the devil will also offer if you're not a druggie or all of these other things he'll offer a religious spirit is that right go to church put your name on a book many people try to appeased their conscience by joining church or do things like that amen that's right but and they go into some kind of a man-made sister ain't that right and they're still lovers of stagnation they're still lovers of things that's wrong uncleanness they're still hateful Birds is that right now let's look at another one Revelations 20 Revelations 20 and verse one it says and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit with a great chain in his hand and he laid a hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless plit and sh shut him up how many believes Pandora's Box so to speak this devil that got loose one day will be be put back in the pit where he come from that's right cuz that's where he come he come out of the pit of Hell the Bible one place he says the king he call he is the king of that pit the king of the bottomless pit amen God's going to put him back in there and sets a seal upon him that he should not deceive the nation no longer till the Thousand Years should be finished and after that he must be loose a little season now I'm going to add a little something here you just judge of whether you think it's right or not but I believe that the devil and all of his little imps will be all lipping there too because he's the chief and we're going to have peace ain't going to be no jealousy and hatred not little imps thrown out the whole bunch is going to get gone in there is the way I see it when he puts him in there he put all of his followers in that pit and shuts him up woo Glory how many looking forward to that day one place over in re Isaiah 14 it says and that they that look upon the shall uh say man is this the guy that does all this he says because he'll be put in that pit isn't that right that he talks about being put in that pit amen you and I how many believes that we're going to be there we're going to watch God put this guy in that pit because we're the ones that live for a thousand years with Christ Rule and Reign we're going to kick him in there brother Glenn because we're used to kicking him around how many believe we're used to kicking the devil around if he ain't in your heart right now guess what you must kicked him out somehow he must not be [Applause] there praise be to God hallelujah listen to this Satan's Army brings diseases and God's Army is commissioned to cast them out there you are every time the devil throws something onto you Army God's Army is to cast him out woo W that's right that's the very tactic that God used Satan uses the army of Destruction to disbelieve God's word and set him up and try to get it set up a better Kingdom than that of Michael and God cast him out God's method is to cast The Devil Out cast down reasoning cast down Superstition cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen you're above it resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in Heavenly places in Christ amen with every devil under your foot and when he sticks his head up there just cut it off amen every every time the devil temps you just cut him off every time he tries to put a little dis on view or Discord or dis uh whatever it might be just cut it off say get out of here devil bring every thought that comes in your mind cap to the word of God close the door how many beli Clos the door to the devil and all of his imps and all that he does Amen praise the Lord all right now we know that God cast him out of Heaven first didn't he that's right he cast him down into the Earth him and a third of the angels all of them they become mean ugly hateful they were once nice Angels amen teenagers maybe we are sweet and kind and loving and don't try to hurt nobody this that or the other go on out there in the world and see how mean and things that people treat you and all of a sudden if you're not Holy Ghost filled you'll be one mean woman you'll be a mean man hello how many knows it has a way of making you that way when you get away from God you become like these angels did they were once angels of God and now they're Devils no conscience no sweetness no goodness amen God help us not to be that way isn't that right let's not be like that amen now before I go into the windows of Heaven let's talk a little bit more about the river Euphrates how many seen on YouTube people talking about the E Euphrates River have you heard anything the Euphrates River drying up and they claim when it dries up that there's some devils going to come up out of there demons and all kinds of crazy stuff's going to come up out of there amen how many like to know the truth of that you want to know the truth of it I'm gonna read it to you if that's all right Amen brother brandham talked about this in the Feast of the trumpets he says let's read the scripture first go to Revelations with me where are you going with this this brother B well we want to talk about the loosing of or the opening up of the door of hell a't that right hell opening up demons coming forth we're living in that hour according to the prophet of God it hadn't happened for 2,000 years there's these demons that's been bound for 2,000 years and these demons in our age has been let loose amen okay let me see where we're at Revelations 9 Revelations 9 and verse 13 says and the six Angels sounded and I Heard a Voice from the four horns of the golden alar which is before God saying to the six angels which had the trumpet says loose the Four Angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates and the Four Angels were loose which were prepared for an hour and for a day and for a month and for a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 and I heard the number of them brother bam says under this six seal he says these 200,000 spiritual demons they started in Rome Germany Hitler huh remember he said musolini stalen Hitler and I believe ikeman he M named him about four of them huh that were dictators what did they do I don't know why Japan didn't come in there is that right because they were a dictator and they were responsible for the large portion of the people that got killed 68 million was it World War II 68 million people men becoming so scarce until they had to train a women and a children hello now see I just follow what the prophet says and say what he says because some of these things we don't really understand but I just try to say what he says is that okay that's what he said German Hitler over in the Bible they would receive power as kings but wasn't crowned a dictators not a Crown King but just receive power as king notice these 200,000 demons turned loose upon those Jews when they burned them they crucified them they put bubbles in their veins they killed them until there was no more gas to kill them with they shot them till they didn't have any more bullets to shoot with they done everything they could how many know these Devils were ruthless merciless unimaginable evil loosed opened up the pits of hell so if there's anything loosing from the river fredes it's already happen hello spiritual demons he call it they cremated the their bodies and everything and hung them on the fences children and all innocent people because they were Jews they were done that way but God said he'd give each one of them a robe a that right undeserving as they was ain't that something how they just willfully went into those camps gave their lives I don't know about you but I think I'd have maybe put all up a little resistance brother R we'd have had more resistant parties they had some but for the most part there's very little they could do amen then sometimes we wonder well where did all of those Spirits go brother brandham said where they went he it's the hour that we're living in the Ecclesiastes the spirits uniting together now and bringing them all in this one great big Slaughter to blot out it's already in writing in this nation now that these churches has to be closed unless you belong to that organization it's a union it's a boycott just like the mark of the beast amen notice while that group is arriving making themselves ready to stomp out anything that won't agree with them how many knows that the left and all of that if you don't agree with them they it's as much as said they would rather you be dead you go into one of Trump's rallies and you come over and he hey how y'all do yeah come on over here they're nice folks but not that other side if you don't agree with them they hate you isn't it something out there's talking oh this hate they're the very ones that hate racist they're the ones that are racist amen I think camela did a oh boy we're get to in trouble here that's all right she did a great job she blamed everything on Trump that she did and was doing and had intentions of doing she's not the only one I've seen the presidents before that the Democrats said jump on it real ahead when actually what they're accusing somebody else of oh you're you're you're you're coming against the Constitution and all that other stuff amen what was it I was I had his name uh he was a he's a congressman from Texas but anyway he was up there talking about how that the Democrats the none showed up to talk about this uh uh the uh the immigration problem and the people that are dying coming across the river and everything else you know and how that you know the Supreme Court said told them to keep the law the rule that brother uh that Trump had put it in place 42 article 42 or something like that did they no they said no you can't just write out uh and forgive all of these students that did they not do it no they went got around it did it anyway and I love the way this senors it say you can do all of that then you accuse other people how many knows that where's them Devils I'm telling you where those devils are they're right up in there getting ready to stomp out listen to what he says anything that won't agree with them amen and who is the head of it all the pope amen now how many knows it won't be too long you say stuff like

many knows people just you the movie star you just vote for the wrong person or go for the wrong story and you're out huh what is it it's supernatural Devils 200,000 that's been loosed amen praise the Lord that's right won't agree listen there's another group being made ready after a while in Revelation 19 that's right and listen while this group down here has got 2,000 years that it's been bound at the river Euphrates and it's been bound for 2,000 years also the church has been bound has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under martyrdom and so forth not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas the Holy Spirit can't work because the church because of the man-made cem wo can you imagine a preacher going wo glory in the Army Shir he'd be cast out you can't worship you can't pra you can't say Amen bound you better do what we tell you to do are you going to Hell Bound those systems bound the Holy Ghost but how many know the windows of Heaven has been coming down and God's been pouring us out of blessing said you don't have to be a part of that say come out of her my people pour out some more that come on don't be partakers of sin you're free you're the bride of Christ you can believe all of the word amen but that's where all of those 200,000 devils and so forth they're in the ecclesiastical realm amen the lids come off of Hell streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere and it's Conquering the Nations huh it's conquering politics till it's rotten to De core and amen how many know that's right the Nations look at the UN look at how they're coming against Israel and for the Arabs hello the people that attacked Israel killed babies and all the vicious stuff that did and they side with them you tell me that's not Devils amen that's right I somewhere here he even talked about the UN and so forth It's concrete that's right it's concrete to churches until they don't know nothing but their denomination as long as you got your name on a book let me tell you how many knows you got to have a real genuine experience with Jesus Christ amen praise be to God so we see in this hour how even the lid has come off of Hell 200,000 thousand thousand

thought it was awesome that's the truth amen praise the Lord all right have I given you enough depression this morning let's get some good stuff y'all want to go on the other side of this now let's go to the other side of this amen think about it how that the floodgates with Eve was opened up for thousands of years for 4,000 years no matter how much Israel would maybe want to try to keep the commandment and do all of that they were captive to their flesh they were captive to their lusts they were captive to be carnal because they didn't have the power of the Holy Ghost Amen Let me just start with this Amen brother bam talked about imorphia I believe it was and and so forth how that God Amen it means for God to pour himself out isn't that right Amen in that Calvary when Christ died and when he rose again went up into heaven ain't that right he talked about if I go not the comforter cannot come and we can say Acts 2 amen we found when God begin to pour out his blessings is that right to a bunch of cowards that were in the upper room scared worried that they're going to have to face the same kind of a death that Jesus did but staying there because they were commanded of God to do so amen and God brother uh I me Jesus Christ's Ministry was what to set the captives free to bring Deliverance to the captives to me heal the brokenhearted those that are depressed those that are oh my oppressed and everything else to bring freedom to bring happiness how many knows am mean the devil in his kingdom brings captivity but Jesus says I come to set you free and if the sun sets you free you're going to be free indeed not just may be free you're really going to be free praise be to God Amen the windows of Heaven praise be to God how many believes that every verse every promise in the Bible is yours amen you got to pick pick one of the other you got to pick the curses of the devil or you can pick the blessings of almighty God Amen before I go into some of this other other I want to pick this up before I bypass it but if every promise in the book is yours then this is yours in Deuteronomy 28 it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hearken unto the diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the Earth all these blessings shall come upon thee amen how many knows those lepers they experienced the windows of Heaven coming open ain't that right they went in tense and every Financial thing they had need of my they was grabbing W

that's kind of scary going into a situ where you might die in just a few hours you're going Scavenging their tents so to speak speaking grabbing all their gold oh my they're silver all that they have because God was pouring out his blessings upon them amen listen to this overtake thee listen blessed sh thou be in the city and blessed sh thou be in the field I am blessed I am blessed every day that I live I am blessed blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kind flocks and thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store blessed shall thou be when thou comest in and blessed shall thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thine enemies to rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against see one way and flee before you seven ways woo when the Devil comes at you with something amen just commit it to God and say God you take care of this what that guy flee seven ways how many knows when depression wants to come in Heen when you get want to get the blues and the Wy Wy W say just get away from me devil I've got everything to be happy for cuz when God sent Jesus Christ he opened up the floodgates Eve opened up the floodgates of Hell Jesus opened up the floodgates of Heaven he said I'll bless you so much until you like David said my cup is full and running over in other words I can't barely contain myself that's how good God is amen I was listening or reading some of brother bram's quote and he says man I would rather have this if you stack money this High weigh stacks of money he say you take your money you give me this you've got something better than a billion dollars hundred billion dollars the true riches amen a freedom of no condemnation of Liberty amen praise be to God my as Eve and Adam after the fall what they were the Bible says that and and God drove the man out that right drove them out get away no more Fellowship no more speaking to the tree and watch that lion watch that Mountain line when you go hunting hello the Thorns the Briars everything that can hurt you will hurt you watch that tree when you're cutting it down if you're on a ladder Murphy's Law is going to be in effect it's going to come swing back and sent you sailing woo all kinds of terrible things that right that's right and no more no more that eternal life no more peace PE peace was taken but how many knows my peace I give you Jesus said not as the world gives give I do because there's a fake peace not a real peace but Jesus came to bring peace amen and instead of condemnation he pours out of Heaven justification how many have to be justified amen he pours out and gives us how many know spiritual food in due season how many believe we've had spiritual food in due season that's right praise be to God called invisible Union of Christ and the bride all of your past I don't know about you but your de your past has to be dealt with it has to be brought under the blood and after it's under the blood you don't have to worry about that anymore you might remember remember but this food that God sends down from heaven says you'd stole as you never did it in the first place never even done it in the first place as far as God's concerned so get off me devil is that right get away from me there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus the curse is still all around us and even in his flesh but the curse is no more in here that soul is not under a curse anymore how many's with me it's not under condemnation a curse but a blessing praise be to God Heavenly places we now where in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because he pours it down but how many knows you cannot receive it unless you open something also there's something that we got to open that is the heart of your door the door of your heart the heart of your door the door of your heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you is't that right I want to see you high and lifted up amen open that up I'm here to tell you how many knows that we come to church sometimes and we become as Spectators well I wonder what brother Brad's going to preach you and wonder his subject going to be and and so forth and sit back and listen to what he got and so forth I try never to come that way if I sit out there I try to get into what's being said and receive what's being said not just a spectator but open your heart open your mind and say God that was for me that's for me amen then God can pour out his Blessing but when you come and you're just a spectator just kind of watching well this is sh no you're not going to get very much how many believes that you're not going to ever change from what you are to something better unless you open up your mind and say God I'm not content with how I am I want to be better than what I am you've got to open that Heart Change Me Lord amen then got to come down I'm so glad that we have to open up every art every door brother says preach a message called doors and door a lot of door door of your heart the the door of your private life the door of your job the door of your home life your financial life every door has to be open say Christ come on in and instead of being driven out now Jesus said come come on to me all ye who are God the fivefold ministry now amen is saying come on into the Tree of Life come and eat this fruit and live forever instead of driving away we're saying come come into the highways and the hedges compelling people to come home aren't you glad that's what the windows of Heaven does and the door of Heaven amen Jesus of course being the door I am the door to the Sheepfold if you try to climb up some other way huh you got to come by that door God provided a door for us amen for us to come into and say Lord take me deeper than I have ever went in that our heart's desires this morning is take me deeper than what I have ever gone that's right not only not only does Jesus deliver you sets you free is that right but he cleans you how many believes that we get cleaned by the power of the Holy Ghost cleans you up and then he does something else he fills you up fills you I'm glad to be filled with the Holy Ghost this morning so that you don't have emptiness in there anymore God brings total satisfaction amen and then after he fills you he promis you that he will lead you I'm glad that he there to lead us we don't know what next week holds amen praise the Lord we just follow the spirit I'm glad Brother Brad followed the spirit brother John followed the spirit Ain that right brother John come and said you know we'd like should take an offering for those folks over here there I hadn't really heard or seen anything about it but he come back John Michael perhaps his son told him about it he got him sister Leisa all went over there and saw what was going on and said boy we'd like to be a part of that and brother God brother Brad God laid it on his heart to try to you know be the head man on this and try to get it going and and look what God did how many knows it's about what god let's be led by the spirit what'll be next week next year what we don't know but whatever it is we have a God that promised to lead us and to guide us because I'll tell you right now if the devil will lead you to death he'll make see it's young people he'll make sin look good you'll think oh you'll have freedom no you won't you're going to be serving the devil amen and he'll lead you to despair but Christ leads you to Joy fills us and what does he do he don't do like the devil that's right because the devil you'll get down to a place where you can't go no more at the door death and he'll forsake you he will leave you but Jesus no matter what it is like I read in Paul he says we may be distressed but we're not forsaken how many's glad not forsaken we'll never be forsaken as long as we we have in him in our hearts amen my my my you know brother Bram talked about how that we're at a he preached at a junction of time there's always Junctions I can't help but feel like we're getting at a junction amen we're getting at a junction and we're going to just see what happens and it's very very important for everybody just to be close to the Lord in these Junctions because it takes a real Mason to turn the corner amen takes a real Christian to turn the corner and see which way to go amen praise the Lord what does he pour out what does he pour out brother brand preached on broken sisters that right how that man they want broken sisters they have drink out of a sistern that's stagnated wiggle tails in it always looking back to what Luther said Wesley said they got frogs in there cre that look back but he says for us there's an artisian well how he's glad for this Artisan well we drink from God we drink this water that God has supplied drink the word of God and what does it do it refreshes us we ain't got to worry about the wiggle tails in our life the stagnant things and so forth it keeps it bubbling and pushes it out how many's glad that you've got a life to where you don't have to come to church to get clean cleaned up all you got to do is get on your prayer bones all you got to get is in your closet and say God take this away Lord wash me from that ain't that right an nesian well blessed how many believe we're blessed more blessed than what we realize that's why prophet of God said we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth that's right we're like a mouse like a mouse when Joseph told Pharaoh there's going to be seven years of plenty then there's going to be seven years of nothing they went and they store it up like you wouldn't believe for the whole world and brother bandam says whenever we don't want to ask too much of God it's like being that little mouse in the grains of Egypt and say now I've got five 10 of them here and I'm going to what I'm going to eat a grain in the morning morning grain at noon and grain at night I'm getting a little skinny and my ribs are showing but I'm going to do this cuz I don't want to run out how many know we ain't got to run out we've got plenty of food to eat we've got a seven4 course meal he poured it all out here at the end he me he poured it all out and he's pouring himself out into you into me amen how many believe that butam says you're not eating on on a man you're eating on the unfailing body word of the Son of God and as you eat on the word you become the word how many believes we're becoming him by feeding on his word or we're like that little fish brother Glenn out in the ocean that's what a real message believer is we're swimming in this remember he said in Luther's time we had maybe water up here to our knees if you laid down you could Splash a little Wesley up here to your waist Pentecost up to here in water we had the water that deep but now we got an ocean amen you could just Dive Right In and say hallelujah God you are so good I can't hardly contain it brother Howard Carroll used to say man I'm doing so good I need another me that way I can feel twice as good hey amen that's good how many believes that God is good amen he really is

heads this morning and I just want to ask do you have that peace that passes understanding do you have that joy unspeakable and full of Glory because that's what he poured out of the windows of Heaven
