[52:26] amen praise the
[52:30] Lord turn to St John if you will St
[52:43] John let's go with the 11th
[52:53] chapter and the 17 th
[52:56] verse then when Jesus came he found that
[52:59] he had laid in the grave 4 days already
[53:03] may God had his blessings to the reading
[53:05] of the word you can preceed it tonight
[53:07] amen I want to title this when Jesus
[53:11] comes when Jesus comes amen one place I
[53:16] believe the Bible says that the spirit
[53:17] of Christ of God is the spirit of
[53:20] Prophecy amen how many knows that Spirit
[53:23] of Prophecy prophecy
[53:31] that right things that's ahead am comes
[53:36] we know that the prophet also taught us
[53:38] that God
[53:41] has before the foundation of the word
[53:44] world alloted a certain word for every
[53:48] age that right every age has a certain
[53:52] word amen so Christ is going to be made
[53:55] manifest in that word that he has spoken
[53:59] now I won't go into detail I didn't go
[54:02] into the study of it but you know
[54:04] brother Braham talked about how that you
[54:06] as a Believer as a Son of God are the
[54:08] manifested word of God you're the light
[54:11] for your day Jesus says you are the
[54:13] light of the world Amen because it's no
[54:15] longer Jesus walking on the shores of
[54:17] Galilee it's Jesus now walking in you
[54:20] and you become the light of the world
[54:23] Amen praise the Lord that means that the
[54:25] current that's flowing through the light
[54:27] so to speak amen through that switch and
[54:29] so forth the spark that it takes Amen to
[54:32] light up those lights amen that has to
[54:34] be running through your body if that's
[54:37] not in your heart then you're just a
[54:38] church
[54:41] member amen how many know we've got many
[54:44] of
[54:45] those churches churches churches people
[54:48] are filled up with nomal Christians
[54:50] without that spark that brother Tommy
[54:52] talked about amen without that spark to
[54:54] ignite it I me know so gasoline is part
[54:58] of the
[54:59] mechanics amen it's part of the
[55:00] mechanics just like the oil's part of
[55:02] the mechanics but that spark amen that
[55:05] is a dynamic it takes amen that
[55:07] Supernatural power Amen to make that gas
[55:10] move and that's the way the word of God
[55:12] is we need the spirit of God to come to
[55:14] ignite it and make it
[55:17] live
[55:19] amen amen how many knows that for th
[55:23] thousands of years the first coming of
[55:25] Christ was prophesied all through the
[55:28] Old Testament of how he was coming how
[55:31] he's coming how he's coming talk more
[55:32] about his second com did his first
[55:34] coming isin that right talked about
[55:37] his second coming so how many know
[55:39] there's another coming of Christ amen I
[55:42] want to say that Christ is always coming
[55:44] and he's always
[55:46] [Laughter]
[55:48] here it just comes to me now but how
[55:50] many knows he's always
[55:54] was
[55:55] he he was he is and he will
[55:58] be amen so he's all praise the Lord amen
[56:03] and so we're going to look at that and
[56:06] I'll pick up that thought perhaps right
[56:08] there a little bit in a little bit if
[56:10] the Lord wants me to talking
[56:16] about
[56:17] amen
[56:19] Revelations 1 and verse 7 says it this
[56:21] way behold he cometh amen here's another
[56:27] coming when Jesus
[56:29] comes

[56:35] Lord my my my my we could stay here till
[56:39] I don't know
[56:40] when
[56:45] amen how many's glad that we believe
[56:48] he's coming but I also believe that he's
[56:52] here he's
[56:53] here
[56:58] yes
[57:02] amen Sometimes
[57:05] some we pray too far away we believe too
[57:09] far we overreach so many times amen we
[57:16] overreach amen all right let's look at
[57:18] this this coming he cometh with clouds
[57:20] and every eye shall see him and they
[57:23] also which pi Ned him amen woo how many
[57:28] knows he's talking about the
[57:31] unbeliever he's talking about those that
[57:33] killed
[57:35] him amen every
[57:39] eye I let's stop there a minute we know
[57:42] every knee is going to
[57:44] bow now it said that every eye is going
[57:47] to see
[57:49] him you know how they deny him oh they
[57:53] want to put him away no no no no no no
[57:55] but they're going to have to look at him
[58:01] someday aren't you glad that you're
[58:03] looking at him a little bit sooner than
[58:06] that I'm glad that I already got a
[58:10] look amen because when you look now you
[58:13] had to
[58:15] live the stone that that come out of the
[58:17] mountain he says that stone amen if you
[58:20] that Stone Falls on you or if you fall
[58:23] on the stone I believe it is Say it'll
[58:25] Crush you it'll break
[58:28] you but he says on whom the stone will
[58:31] fall it will grind him to
[58:33] powder I would rather fall on the stone
[58:35] and let it break me amen I don't want to
[58:39] be ground to powder because there's
[58:41] coming a day that he'll grind to powder
[58:44] amen oh how
[58:46] thankful we ought to
[58:49] be I would think just before I came out
[58:51] here I thought you know you could be at
[58:54] uh I don't know IND these 500 if you
[58:56] could be at a Super Bowl you could be at
[58:59] a great event all of the great great
[59:02] events that you could possibly imagine
[59:04] that you could be at but I believe
[59:06] you're in the greatest place that is on
[59:09] the face of the Earth sitting in
[59:15] church yeah it does something to you
[59:18] you're sitting
[59:20] there and you're doing the greatest
[59:22] thing that there is to do amen
[59:25] that is to exalt his name that's to
[59:29] glorify God that's to praise him that's
[59:32] to feed on God feed on things that
[59:36] are
[59:38] Eternal I thought that's
[59:42] exactly if you've got Christ in your
[59:44] heart you can't be in the better
[59:50] place all right well praise the Lord
[59:54] every eye I shall see him and they also
[59:58] which Pierce him and all the kindreds of
[1:00:01] the Earth shall whail because of him
[1:00:05] even so so it
[1:00:10] amen I am the alpha the Omega the
[1:00:14] beginning and the
[1:00:19] end aren't you glad that you are part of
[1:00:22] the word of God Amen
[1:00:25] amen part of the word of God we want to
[1:00:27] look at that what happens when Jesus
[1:00:29] does come to
[1:00:33] you last week even the heavens that
[1:00:36] you're
[1:00:37] going to is going to be changed even the
[1:00:40] heavens that we're going to is going to
[1:00:42] pass away Behold a new heavens and a new
[1:00:45] Earth that we're going to dwell on this
[1:00:47] Earth is going to have to be renovated
[1:00:49] and so forth amen and when Jesus comes
[1:00:55] when he meets you when you come in
[1:00:57] contact with Jesus what was the prophet
[1:00:59] that you know man can come in the
[1:01:01] presence of God and ever remain the
[1:01:05] same how many believes that's why it's
[1:01:07] so
[1:01:08] important the presence of God is so
[1:01:12] important when he
[1:01:15] comes
[1:01:17] a he changed me pretty near 40 years ago
[1:01:21] I guess it was and this world has never
[1:01:23] been the same
[1:01:25] ever since Mighty Jesus came well this
[1:01:27] world this world it's just never been
[1:01:30] the same never will be the same it'll
[1:01:34] always be
[1:01:35] changed I mean believe God comes to
[1:01:37] transform when Jesus come he comes to
[1:01:41] transform oh my let me let me try to get
[1:01:45] some of these starters out of the way
[1:01:46] shall we even so amen everybody when he

[1:02:31] with him in the Judgment judging the
[1:02:34] world that's

[1:12:54] a lot of hard times lot of hard things
[1:12:56] that you went
[1:12:57] through we should all be sitting
[1:13:02] around I tell you what I don't think
[1:13:04] there's any Bel such
[1:13:07] a thing as a
[1:13:09] Christian you know I have could name his
[1:13:13] name died sorrowfully bad somebody that
[1:13:17] wasn't the message and he got to where
[1:13:20] he he said that wa from church and
[1:13:27] everything I don't care how many
[1:13:29] Hypocrites are in the church I don't
[1:13:30] care how many false people are around
[1:13:32] that doesn't do away with the
[1:13:34] real there's a real brothers there's a
[1:13:36] real sisters there's a real Church
[1:13:38] there's a real God there's a real Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost There's real
[1:13:42] Grace There's real
[1:13:44] Mercy There's real
[1:13:47] forgiveness unforgiveness only hurts you
[1:13:50] not the other
[1:13:51] person bitterness only hurts you not the
[1:13:54] other
[1:13:57] person anyway that's kind of off the
[1:14:00] subject but it's right on maybe but
[1:14:04] the Holy
[1:14:05] Ghost you love him isn't God
[1:14:13] great I trust you have a day I can take
[1:14:17] you to the
[1:14:19] time and I can take you to the place
[1:14:23] where he came to me showed me his
[1:14:25] Amazing Grace and I've never been the
[1:14:29] same
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:33] changed and if you're a Christian even
[1:14:35] Paul says we are changed from glory to
[1:14:37] glory even Into His Image I don't care
[1:14:41] how long you have known him how he's
[1:14:43] come but he keeps coming to you and he
[1:14:45] keeps changing you every time you come
[1:14:48] to him how why do you think that when
[1:14:50] you come to
[1:14:52] church
[1:14:57] or you go
[1:15:01] worse you say well no I'm leaving the
[1:15:04] same no I beg to differ with you if
[1:15:06] you're leaving the same you're leaving
[1:15:07] worse right cuz that's just another time
[1:15:10] that you didn't get anything from God
[1:15:11] and you just got a little CER a little
[1:15:14] harder
[1:15:16] yet to not listen to the Holy Spirit
[1:15:19] that's exactly right be easier for you
[1:15:21] to try to think that you're de the next
[1:15:23] time but it'll just make you a little
[1:15:25] bit worse sorry can't leave the same
[1:15:29] just like the Rich Young
[1:15:32] Ruler when he came to him he should have
[1:15:35] been
[1:15:36] prepared huh the Rich Young Ruler should
[1:15:39] have been prepared when he came to
[1:15:42] Christ to count the cost I don't know if
[1:15:45] he was in that service or not but he
[1:15:47] said let him come the court unless
[1:15:49] you're willing to forsake father mother
[1:15:50] all for Mak not
[1:15:52] worthy no doubt maybe he had heard that
[1:15:54] maybe he didn't I don't know but when he
[1:15:55] came to him and he asked him for eternal
[1:15:57] life he wanted eternal
[1:15:59] life but I'm telling you what if it
[1:16:02] meant going to the Cross dying or
[1:16:04] whatever it meant he should have been
[1:16:05] willing to do
[1:16:07] it but he liked his
[1:16:10] riches just a little too much because he
[1:16:13] was a good boy he was better than most
[1:16:16] Christians he never broke any of those
[1:16:18] Commandments that's saying a
[1:16:21] lot it's saying a lot when you look
[1:16:23] Jesus in the
[1:16:26] fa and said not committed ad commments
[1:16:31] right and did
[1:16:33] Jesus one time say ah you're
[1:16:36] lying no he could have he said you're
[1:16:38] lying about this and you're lying about
[1:16:40] that you failed there but he kept all
[1:16:41] the
[1:16:43] Commandments but Jesus being God knew
[1:16:45] where his weakness was he knews where
[1:16:48] his hang
[1:16:49] was that's why he didn't ask like Z is
[1:16:53] and everybody else that give half of
[1:16:54] their riches to the poor did did
[1:16:56] somebody wrong they pay him seven times
[1:16:58] this that or the other Jesus said I want
[1:16:59] you to go and sell all the
[1:17:01] thast a
[1:17:05] l do you realize brother John that if he
[1:17:09] said
[1:17:10] 50% the man might have done
[1:17:16] it 25% whatever might he might have di
[1:17:20] said that sounds like a deal to
[1:17:22] me but when he said all it was just a
[1:17:25] little too
[1:17:27] much and Jesus revealed that in his
[1:17:30] heart he wasn't willing to forsake all
[1:17:33] you're not worthy of being
[1:17:35] my and he went away amen and he was
[1:17:39] never the same
[1:17:41] again praise the Lord my my
[1:17:47] my when Jesus
[1:17:49] comes amen the tempter power is
[1:17:55] broken for all is changed when Jesus
[1:17:59] comes to say let's sing that at end how
[1:18:02] many believes that all gets changed when

[1:24:57] they had it caused him to
[1:24:59] come folks I'm here tell if we had our

[1:25:12] you're too busy with everything
[1:25:16] else we let the cares of this world suck
[1:25:20] the spiritual life out of until we look
[1:25:23] like those that were in the uh under
[1:25:26] Hitler's what is
[1:25:29] that the Holocaust thank you we're
[1:25:32] looking like Holocaust
[1:25:34] people huh dried
[1:25:38] up like brother B says somebody say well
[1:25:41] praise be to God and the lady in the
[1:25:43] back man sh send Shivers over somebody
[1:25:46] everybody turned their head like wow

[1:25:50] about huh
[1:25:54] dry up suck the
[1:25:58] life of Jesus Christ out of
[1:26:05] us we got to realize we got to come to
[1:26:07] realize that everything that you ever
[1:26:09] have need of is
[1:26:11] where in you
[1:26:14] right right
[1:26:18] here oh my aren't you glad you ain't got
[1:26:21] a Peter in that all the rock the ship
[1:26:23] was rocking it was W they took
[1:26:25] everything out they couldn't we was
[1:26:26] taking
[1:26:27] on water but he described he one more
[1:26:31] dip and we're going down one more see
[1:26:33] that water coming and we're no
[1:26:35] down they went back to the
[1:26:37] back Jesus wake
[1:26:42] up that we perish I I don't care what's
[1:26:45] your problem I don't care if you're r at
[1:26:46] the break of going down Jesus cares and
[1:26:49] he always shows up most of the time in
[1:26:52] the darkest
[1:26:57] hour how many know in The Darkest Hour
[1:27:00] most of the time that's when he shows
[1:27:03] up when you're in brings him on the
[1:27:07] scene that brings him on the
[1:27:10] scene our problem is that's most of the
[1:27:13] time when we begin to call upon
[1:27:16] him a that right but God is right there
[1:27:20] yeah I don't care what the condition
[1:27:23] is what your situation
[1:27:26] is most of
[1:27:31] us but for most of us probably it's a
[1:27:33] closer walk with God we could all raise
[1:27:36] our hand say I need a closer walk with
[1:27:41] God I'm not where I ought to be with
[1:27:46] God pration I'm not waiting for
[1:27:48] everything to break down I'm not waiting

[1:29:01] failed to recognize it they're reaching
[1:29:03] up there somewhere amen and when it was
