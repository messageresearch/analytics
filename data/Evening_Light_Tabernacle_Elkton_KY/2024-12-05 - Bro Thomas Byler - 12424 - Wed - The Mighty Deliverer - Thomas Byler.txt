you'd never leave us nor forsake us even to the end of the world and father we know that you're still here Lord Jesus we're so grateful for that Lord Jesus and tonight we ask God that you just be out

have us all clear father before you Lord Jesus both the speaker and the years of the hearer that your spirit could have free be freedom to flow Lord Jesus and just speak to Hearts this evening as you see fit bless the reading of the word now we ask it in Jesus name amen have a just a two-page message tonight so we may not keep you too long but we'll just uh see how the Lord does Amen everybody feeling good praise the Lord I like that good re a good ReSound amen amen turn your bibles if you will to the Book of Luke amen and we want to continue on our series amen and looking at the attributes of God Amen and what he is amen and just to try to express a little bit amen amen feel so when you think about God and how great he is and all that he is well it just makes me feel like my my my how how what a little sliver whatever we could say or do would just be a sliver right of of it amen amen so Lord help us to open it up open it up that we could really grasp amen the awesomeness of our God Amen how many believes we serve an awesome God amen and so um praise the Lord I'm just glad to be his aren't you glad to be a child of the king Luke 4 and verse 17 but let's go with 16 and he came to nazarus Luke 4 and verse 16 and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance captives and the recovering of the sight of the blind amen and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen God bless the reading of the word you can be seated amen we found a little a little bit later as he sat the book down amen that he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears amen tonight we want to look at the mighty deliverer amen how many believes that God one of the attributes of almighty God is that he is a deliverer amen praise the Lord amen you know and uh you know as we go through these things we think about them you know because uh until you really really experience uh the reality of the essence of God it's still I might just say a figment of your imagination amen Ain that right it might just be something that you know mentally but once you experience what God is it makes all the difference in the world amen amen so tonight with the help of the lord we want to look at the deliverance and and things that God allows and the that he does things and and uh you know to to deliver amen because for realize Deliverance of course amen he brings Deliverance to the captive so before you can be delivered of something you've got to amen be uh like that little crow that brother Braham talked about I believe it was Johnny Crow got the farmer tied up a't that right and he was tied up and just went circles and circles and circles and all of a sudden some kind of man come by am me untied him and I untied that Crow and said come on let's go let's go let's go let's go and he didn't know any better but he just kept circling and circling he was free but he didn't know he was free amen and that's the way it is with Jesus Christ when he went and died on Calvary he set everybody free how many knows it's all free everybody set free amen and Jesus said who the son has set free is free indeed I like that praise the Lord another brother I was studying a little bit and brother B was talking about how that the word washed means loosed and he use it for the Colt untied a colt and Lazarus loose him loose the grip of death let him free set it free something that's tied up bound down ain't that right amen and then after it's set free let go amen it's not captive anymore praise the Lord amen praise the Lord over in uh I'll just go to it right quick you don't have to follow if you don't want but in Psalms 103 1 through3 says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is with me within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits amen who G forgiveth all thine iniquities and who Health all of thy disease Jesus how many that's part of the benefits of Christ amen when we think about what Christ did for us on Calvary and how that he is and we understand him and we feel him and and know him as our personal savior right how many knows and knows Christ as your personal savior amen if you uh don't know him as your personal savior amen then you probably don't know what it's like to be set free from sin amen you just don't know what it's like but if you know what it's like to be for set free from sin then you know what it's like to be set free from condemnation and if you're free from sin and condemnation you have peace in your heart amen you also understand that the benefits of getting Christ in your heart it isn't just one benefit it has a whole bunch of benefits amen I want you to know that whenever he sets you free from sin and he saves your soul amen he is not just a savior but he is a deliverer he is your husband and if he is your husband guess what whenever a man takes a responsibility of a woman amen that Veil I guess goes over on the shoulder of that man amen now he is completely responsible for her how many's glad that he knows all about your need he's responsible for you that's some of the benefits that come with knowing him as his savior another one just the one we want to dwell on with the help of the Lord tonight for while amen it's going to be that he is also your deliverer you want to mess with me well you got to mess with him a that right how many knows before the devil can mess with you he's got to go through him first amen I'm thankful ful for that praise the Lord so um my my when I think about it and I would love to go through these things because it's just not a reality to people is that right the fact that he saved them a't that right now we all know that I was thinking about this that we were all in the devil's pawn shop how many knows when Adam sinned he for fed everything that title deed went back to God and then guess what the devil had rights on Adam and Eve he had rights we all went into the devil's pawn shop so to speak amen and God couldn't just carry out a rescue operation huh he couldn't just come in there and take it back you know like maybe of Iran and or somebody has our has our hostages or whatever amen and we get our Green Beret we get our oh we get the best of the best we go in there and we just clobber all the guards and everything and we bring in our helicopters and our gunships and shoot everybody comes close we get our people out but that's not what God did no because the devil had a right he had you in his pawn shop and he had a right to have you and there had to be a a price paid in other words he held us Ransom he held us Ransom and the ransom money had to be paid amen and aren't you glad that Jesus Paid our Ransom amen and now he goes into the pwn and Chap and he says here's the money here's the blood let him go think about it woo all of his children by the time all of God's children brother Joe y'all amen all of God's children come on children you can get out of this pawn shop get off of that rack get off of that chair am me come out from behind them bars amen and run out that door come on and not only that but Cain's children amen he didn't just say God's children he says hey all of y'all y'all can all go that's truly Deliverance real deliverance and all of y'all can go whosoever will come on come on come on whosoever will let him come as I've said many times here the problem is with the WL whosoever will or should we say wants to whosoever desires how many knows that's why it's so important why you happy toight promise because I thank God that I have a desire for church I thank God that I have a desire for God I thank God that I have a desire to be saved I thank God that I have that will God I want it I want it I want it how many thankful that you have a desire you have a want for it anden if there's a Rapture up ahead it'll be because you want it and if you make it to Rapture because you'll want it amen the rest of them that stay in the pawn shop brother Glenn what happens if you stay there going the wrong way that's right then you are like Israel after 50 years if you become a slave to somebody you was their slave you owed them a million dollars boy you didn't do your finances well at all and you owed a million dollars I mean you had to work it off but guess what I still owe him a half a million but next year is Jubilee year and I don't care if I owe him $500,000 yet amen when that when that bell rings when that amen that trumpet sounds amen I'm telling you what you can put your ho down and said it is Liberty I am free it's all gone I'm going back to where I started how many beli we've had a jubilee in our day amen God Almighty came down and said you can be free you don't have to be tied to no denominations anymore no more Creeds of man amen you can come on out of her my people and you can be free in the Holy Ghost but if you choose to stay there but if you choose you still want to be a Amish you still want to be a menonite you want to be this you want to be that and they took you is that right took up you into the temple they got some kind of a all and they bored something in your ear ain't that right you was marked forever and you know why they stayed Brother Brad you know why they stayed it's because like their Master you wouldn't stay if you didn't like where you was he gives me ribe eyes he feeds me good corn I get good broccoli I mean I get asparagus you know I get all kinds of good stuff he feeds me good he keeps me closed he makes sure I got 12 grams of insulation in my shoes when it's winter I don't get cold toes when I work I have gloves I have whatever I have need of my wife is taken care of my children are taken care of of course we don't get any money for what we do we're slaves I don't understand how they can be a happy slave but they're happy slaves huh happy slaves amen and how many knows that's the way the world is they're happy doing what they're doing otherwise they say I'm not happy with that world I want something more I want something more than just the things of this world Amen and the things you know uh the the the Gentiles food and clothes and what should we shall wear what shall we eat that's what the Gentiles that's what the whole world goes after they happy with that but I'm not happy with that I'm not happy with old age I'm not happy with sickness I'm not happy with cancer I'm not happy with diabet I'm not happy with any of that I am hungering for eternal life for life that last forever I want [Applause] more amen preach it huh thank you brother Glenn amen all right let's get to our thought this was just some pre thoughts amen what I thought that's right and then what did they do they serve that Master for their whole life I don't know if I should go down this rabbit Braille any longer but when somebody rejects the word huh your pastor preaches to you you reject that word hello you're not happy with that you walk away you could get bored in the ear to where you'll never want that again you'll never hear the truth again pretty strong ain't it but that's right you're happy serving the master that you serve God help us amen all right praise the Lord but aren't you glad oh my how many's free tonight how many is free amen free from condemnation free from Fear free from anxiety free from doubt free from frustration yes sir free from depression free from sin free from condemnation amen I wonder just how free people really [Applause] are that's right when you're really free boy you feel good don't it feels good to be free that's right all right let me get to something that I've preached on millions of times I think and I've got something new off out of it again you all ready for that it's about trials something new about trials amen all right now we'll get to that in a second but let me first of all say this that he's a specialist how many know that God is a specialist when you go to a doctor and he says well look I know what it is but I'm not just a specialist in that I you need something by somebody knows more about it than I do amen and so when they can't handle it more they put it to a specialist and God is a specialist brother Brandon preach a message is called the darkest hour then Jesus comes and if you remember I'll just start here with Mary and Martha when Jesus when Lazarus got sick isin't that right and he passed away it says even Jesus himself said that this is not unto death this is to bring honor and glory to God and it was to be glorifying Jesus Christ it was to bring God glory amen and he went even after he stayed at a certain place after they send the word to him and then it says he went over into next city I forget the name of it Judea or somewhere not Judea but anyway the next city the disciples says man why do you want to go back there they want it to kill you last time he went there amen and I believe the brother B says he went even further away amen and then he tells his disciples you know let's go back to see Lazarus because he's sleeping Thomas I believe was or one of them said well if he sleeps he's doing good he needs a nap that's what they thought it was sleeping well if he's doing good like the rest of us when we're taking a nap we're doing pretty good that's right but he said no no no no no he's dead oh my Thomas Thomas says well let's go on back and let's go back and die with him amen but anyway they all went back and came back back and came to a certain town or close to where Lazarus was Martha found out about and she come running to him wherever he was she come out to him he says she said you know if you would have been here Lazarus would not have died how many appreciates whenever IM me that brother Tommy talked about it I've I've seen it many times in my own life amen you want to fix something or you need something and immediately God answers you right there and there it is and you're like woo God is quick I like God it's just right there there and how many believes God cares about the intricate parts of your life he does Amen but a lot of times a lot of times it seems like that God waits till it's too late amen I thought about titling this better late than never because we have that phrase you know at least you're late but at least that's better than never that was kind of Martha's situation he says you know you're a little late but even now whatever you ask God to give it to you and he says Martha he's going to rise again Martha says oh yeah I know he's going to rise he's going to rise at the resurrection and guess what Jesus said he looked at her and said I am the resurrection and I am the life woo Glory you know I was praying the other day and I was praying to God lord you see our circumstance Lord can you hear us will you hear us do you hear us can you hear me Lord Hear My Cry hear me Lord you know what I got back he says what are you talking about you talking about if you've got the Holy Ghost I'm not off somewhere I I'm here I I hear you how many believes that that's right he's there he's listening he not off somewhere off if you've got the Holy Ghost just talk to him he knows he hears you amen I thought that thank you Lord so many times we're reaching out into the star somewhere when he's a lot closer to you than what you think amen he understands but in that case it seemed like he it was so late and it was such a dark hour you know because it have been so much different if Jesus would have come right away and prayed for him and he did just not died amen but so many times we think well we'll believe till the last breath hey I want you to understand something God's there he's still God after the last breath he's still God as a matter of fact but it seems like he's he was four days late we might say he was already and bombed he was already in Tomb can you imagine brother the Tommy go digging somebody up out of the Grave how many people would be skeptic of you ain't that right there'd be so many people skeptic but brother Bram says if God told me to go raise Abraham Ling I'd invite the world that's right amen tell you what if I'd have been back there here's a tricky question if I'd have been back there if you'd have been back there what would you have done I'd have said where are we going where's it at I'm GNA be there I just said I believe it how can you say that how can I say that because we didn't see a lot of those Miracles that way but we believe anyway and if you believe now you would have believe back [Applause] there but all those other people back there they wouldn't believe it but if you believe now you to believe back then I to believe Moses's message I to believe Noah's message I didn't believe Jesus's message I didn't believe John the Baptist's message I didn't believe Paul's message cuz I believe it now [Applause] that's right that don't make it jump a little I don't know what will that don't make a Baptist shout don't know what will right Amen to think that if you have the capacity to believe and not see now if you'd have been there you'd have believed you'd have been one of those Believers not a doubter but a Believer amen man I'm going to read you something that seems cruel it seems cruel of God but this cruelness as what we might think is his specialty it's his specialty didn't brother Braham say look if it had been a Pentecostal there and said of Martha they said they to give Jesus a piece of their mind you know what he said he says you know here we have followed you we've believed everything you done and me when we ask something of you we won't even come huh that's it I'm done I'm out of here is what a lot of them would have said amen how many those there is that class out there there a whole lot of them like that amen but if that had been Pentecostals amen but not Martha she didn't give him peace of my mind his M she says even now whatever you ask really he believe that God will do it you see the thing about God is the reason that he specializes and I want to call him The Specialist of impossible impossibilities amen a specialist of impossibilities so he lets it go he let Lazarus go is that right let Lazarus go embalmed 4 days late amen let me read you a quote but before I do let me tell you one more story and I love this story of how God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt right with a mighty hand delivered them Mighty hand of Deliverance what a hand it was Pharaoh felt it all of his army dead in the sea ouch it really hurt when God whooped him it was really painful but he delivered him with a mighty hand how many times the Bible talks about how that God delivers with a mighty hand amen and then the first thing let me just read it here come the children of Israel walking in the light Moses going on before him there they was come on this is the way God's calling we're going out we're going out to the promised land oh Hallelujah and they all there they all was shouting and jumping and having a good time amen you know and the first thing you know they look back and said what's that dust huh and one of them climbed up on the hill and said oh my last it's Pharaoh's Army amen and God said what are you so scared about didn't you believe me what I did down there what you so worried about why are you so worried why do you make me angry when they got down there Moses went out and interceded to God and of course he opened up the Red Sea and they walk through closed the enemy in now notice that's the way God does don't get scared don't get excited don't get flustered or you provoke god brother bam says for someone that had heard did provoke brother B says how many knows that the Israelites provoke god with their unbelief they made God angry so God Specializes in putting you in places you can't get out of there is black and as Bleak as possible and if you murmur and complain God's angry with you sure you want to be a Christian huh you'll put Place put you in places where it looks as black as dark as can be that's right and then if you murmur or complain it provokes God that isn't that what I just read that's right brother bandam said it why do you make me angry they murmur they complain that's right woo the Lord now are you ready for what I was talking about a while ago seems cruel listen to this when they got out there in their Journey just converted and brought out then the first thing you know they got in trouble God loves to bring you in trouble he loves to bring you into trouble I don't want to hear that you don't want to hear that but God loves to do it that's exactly right he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it Glory this is what my new revelation is is that it's never about the test it's never about the trial right it's always about your reaction to the trial that God is looking for that's right give him a hand why God looks for your reaction see how you will react he can use anything he can do anything use any trial test but that's not the point the point that God is looking for is your [Music] reaction my reaction trust me I know amen I know what I'm talking abouten amen it's not always easily grasped hello amen it's not really gotten amen and let me just share with you I hope I can express this in the right way this will be a real lesson for us another lesson your heavenly father is teaching your pastor amen and that is when you think about this it's not about the test but it's about your reaction and I want to I'm here to tell you the hard part is not to test the battle isn't the test the battle isn't the hard part or of the test the real how can I express this the real battle the hardest part of any trial is overcoming not the trial but yourself that's the hardest part your mind right brother Glenn you know been there done that the thoughts that come through your mind the imagination that come through your mind amen cuz you you can only imagine the imaginations that I have with my wife hello and where it goes if you go down that road hello the hardest part for me is overcoming fear oh boy the Lord knows how they teach you a lesson you know I preached not so long ago how that people love power and and God is a god of power and we talk about how that mankind loves to go to these tractor pulls and these big engines and all of these oh my just roar just the power and God wants this church full of power and you don't realize real power is overcoming self even but Braham says if you could can if you can conquer yourself you got more power than demanded runs all over the building screams the loudest and does all of those things real power is being able to submit yourself control your thoughts throw out Doubt cast out Doubt cast out doubt and let Faith come in let love come in let confidence come in let peace come in ain't that right so I'm telling you the hardest battle amen is overcoming yourself and the thoughts that come into your mind overcoming fear I would not be standing here like this at all if it wouldn't have been for overcoming power of the Holy Ghost hello I wouldn't be preaching like this if I let fear and despair overcome amen when you go down that road and I'll give you one little thought that come to my mind that I want it to entertain and you know how brother baham said that when God calls a a a a man to Pastor or minister right he calls his wife also and in my despair or in my wrong thought I said well I wonder why he couldn't do that for when he takes one if he calls one take the other one too little thoughts like that go through your mind amen because of the love that you have amen sometimes God allows pain so much that I thought that if I took an 8 inch knife found my rib cage went between them and jabbed it into there it would be less painful than some of the thoughts that come to your mind hello but what do we do we don't entertain those thoughts we cast those thoughts to the Wayside that's right so the biggest part of a trial is not the trial but it's overcoming the fear if they just think if Israel would have done that now this is where God this is oh this is where God dwells hello God dwells in that Faith but Bram says you know he can only heal you according to your faith so if you think the days of Miracles has passed well guess what you better rely on a doctor or you're dead that right cuz God can't honor that no they have nothing for God to honor you've got to believe that he is that is heward rewarder of those that diligently seek him that by his stripes he is that you are healed we believe that when you believe that with all of your heart and don't don't doubt the rest is up to God Amen take fear and go back to hell with it devil take depression and go back to hell with it that's right every one of us no doubt not just us but every one of us somehow or other the devil's attacking probably don't you don't how many realize is there the devil bring things about you way to try to drag you down to try to bring you into depressed States so when you come into the house of God we ain't got the shouting that we do anymore we ain't got the preaching that we used to do we ain't got the the the Hallelujah like we used to do the devil don't like this the devil don't like us worshiping God the way that we do he don't like it but guess what the more he don't like it the more we're going to [Applause] do I like what lne Lawson said man if you don't want to worship then get on out of here let me worship I'll do the worshiping if you don't want to you don't want to believe in shouting and praising God and having Liberty in the house of God go find the church that's dead there's some of them around no doubt but it ain't around here we have a living God we're living oracles living Epistles written and real of all men amen amen so I learned those two things with God it's not a about the trial we look at the trial oh my such a trial such a trial and it's the same thing as if you look at a symptom how many knows if you look at your symptom you won't never be healed if you listen to a doctor's report you'll never get well amen if we listen to Donna's doctor report you are going to die from that if you listen to that well he a going know you ain't going to get nowhere that's not God's report how many glad that there's another report over here and by his stripes we are healed that's God's report and I'm a whole lot more excited about that than I am with about the other report amen praise be to God same thing with the trial don't look at the trial don't look how bad it is don't look at how hard it is look at your attitude about it look at how you react to it that's what's God is looking for amen he's looking for how you will react amen all right God loves to bring people bring you in trouble he loves to put trouble down and see what you'll do about it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and the first thing you know March him right on out into this place wouldn't have been well listen you see what it says here it looked like God was a poor military man to push him right into that corner there to let them perish well wouldn't it been something if the Red Sea would have already been opened when they got there is that right God did God could have done it beforehand hey y'all just come right down in here and walk right across didn't said oh wow this is nice but no no not God he let the Red Sea bring him down somewhere in a trap brother Bram called it a trap they were absolutely in a trap and he lets you and me get into traps a that right sure he does I'm glad I ain't got to Spring myself out brother Brad I ain't got to Spring myself out all I got to do is trust him brother BS his biggest Miracles his miracles of when he couldn't get over it can get under it can't get around it just stand back and watch God take you through amen I want to say like David amen Goliath I want you to understand that the god that delivered me from the mouth of the lion and the bear will deliver you into my hands also he'll deliver me out of your hands how many believe that the god that delivered us from this trial that trial he'll Deliver Us from this trial he'll take us through amen cuz he's the mighty deliverer he wants to show you his delivering power brother B says he loves to show his power he wants to show you his power but how can you can he if you can always get it out out by yourself I hope everybody in the world hears this I feel sorry for people who try to make things happen themselves good luck with that let me let me know how that works out for you huh it don't work out so good but I'm here to tell you when you trust the Lord in it it always works out good amen so he thought about these places these things looked like he was a poor military man but God loves to do that he says he put you right into the Trap Amen Let me just read the whole quote yes God loves to show his mighty hand yes he does he likes to show his power he's waiting tonight to show it to you to take take that Sinner and turn him around thank you Jesus take that woman of ill Fame and change her to a Godly woman take a girl that's taken the wrong road a boy that went down the wrong road bring them back to a place and make them Sons and Daughters of God out of them he's ready to take a dying man with cancer the one with heart trouble the one that's blind the one that's Afflicted he will if we will just place his faith in there it'll turn him around from Death to life start him off with a testimony he's wanting to do it he puts you right into a trap to see what you will do how you will react brother Bon when he was talking about John Ryan he says you can't just accept your healing amen but you've got to confess it you've got to publicly confess it that you're healed amen telling everybody I am healed that's why would disrupt the services praise God for healing me you got to confess it everybody say it with me thank you Jesus for healing GNA thank you Jesus for healing Donna you got to confess it there's a lot of people scared to confess it they're afraid to say it you can't be afraid to say it confess it believe it and God can work with that how many believes that God can work with that confess it most people sit back and see what God will do nope well maybe God will you got doubt ah she's healed I'm Healed I'm delivered I've got a problem I've got a habit but I'm Healed I'm delivered start saying it start confessing it God will make your body come subject to your confession that's not Thomas B's words that's the almighty God's word people's afraid to sign a check amen man when I think about the benefits of almighty God how many knows when you get saved brother bam says God gives you a checkbook amen he's got his sign name sign on every one of them don't be afraid to write them out he's got all the riches of Heaven he'll bankrupt Heaven before you'll let one check B Hallelujah think about it when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got everything that you will ever need you've got it right in here you got everything you'll ever [Applause] need W if that's a real reality to you it ought to stimulate it ought Quicken you just a little bit you got to everything you inherit the world we like our 30 Acres our what this that or the other your two acres your whatever you got we appreciate that but God gives us inherits the whole world we'll join HS with Jesus we're going to inherit [Applause] everything that's the benefits of our great Redeemer our deliverer The Shepherd of our souls amen praise the Lord that's right so many times God could do something so much sooner than what we think wouldn't it be nice if the Sarah the shunamite woman had her son he had Ed oh my head hurt pray for me come on there and she was holding him in his lab oh mama play for me my head's hurting God please have mercy on him Lord remove this headache Lord Whatever It Is God wouldn't have been easy for God just to take the heada aake away but no he didn't you know mama was praying right she was praying for that headache she was praying for her boy and there he slopped over till there was no pulse he was dead dead as dead can be amen she went and laid him on the prophet's bed I believe it is is that right he went to looking for the prophet I don't remember the story too well I'm thinking maybe his servant went down to him with a stick or something and he he said go lay a stick on him right she said no no no no not good enough I want to see him I want to see him I want to talk to him he said all right he come and of course what happened it was the glory of God the power of God God Specializes in impossibilities thank youus amen not on aspirin not on give him a couple Tel all no I feel much better them T make me good amen take a couple of P I'll pray Lord take my headache I got to my headache thank you Lord ah your possibilities you know but when it's impossible that's oh my how did I write this when we think it's too late when we think it's too far it's over that's God's perfect time amen that's right that's God's perfect time he specialized Us in those time he's the god he's of impossibilities he specializes in times like that amen praise the Lord that's right the woman with the blood issue maybe he could have got to her much sooner but she spent all she had and she tried every doctor yet grew worse amen and it was what the last thing there was nothing else to be done amen then Jesus comes darkest hour then Jesus comes if you don't doubt if you believe amen how many thankful to serve a God Like That amen let me tell you I want to I want to talk about two more stories amen all right actually let me verify basically with scriptures what I say when I say that it's not about the trial but it's about your reaction to the trial how many believes that after tonight I believe it's not so much about the trial that trial is God wanting to see your reaction see if you'll have faith or whether you'll have doubt amen and believe me how many knows brother Glen you let doubt rule there's a whole lot of junk that comes with that whole lot of junk amen like brother Braham says there's absolutely nothing good about fear nothing good about it at all can't do anything for you it'll only make things work I'm going to take job for an illustration here for a minute the the Lord said to Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth it perfect than an upright man one that fearth God and ath Evil and still he holdeth fast his in well this was the second time still he holdeth fast his Integrity although thou removed us me against to destroy him without a cause then Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yeah all that a man have will he give for his life but put thou forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh in other words let this come upon him and this will be his reaction he will curse you to your face Satan says you're going to have a reaction that he's going to curse you if you touch his flesh it was the same story am me before he lost all of his children and everything he'll curse you to the face both times amen why it was God looking for the reaction the devil thought he would get the a negative reaction action from him oh that's what the devil wants this just comes to mind so I'll say it in times of Trials and Times of testings it is an wide openen door for evil things to come in let a husband and a wife have a spat let them get angry with each other let that and your love turns better bam says sometimes that natural love will turn into hate you'll hate they'll they can end up in divorce hello end up in divorce because of something that comes along because they don't have control of their reaction amen didn't mean to go down here but I will remember brother Bram says that one Pentecostal come and he says man I got saved and I've been casting that devil off of my wife casting that devil off of My Wife and everything she was about ready for a divorce brother Brandon what would I do what shall I do well he didn't have the right reaction didn't he no he say take this action go buy our flowers and stuff be nice to are kind later he come back man it revolutionized we're doing great now why because of his reaction amen and so many times evil things come come in families families are broke up friendships are broke up is that right bitterness between people for years and years and decades why because people have the wrong reaction to what's going on how many believes it's important that you have the right reaction to whatever little thing comes your way this is not just for big things but this is for the little things that come your way somebody does you wrong you better watch your reaction cuz bitterness will come in and when bitterness come in hatred comes in that's exactly what Cain did he got jealous just jealousy came in then hatred then murder evil things come of these places and these doors that come open amen that's why you have to guard your heart you have to guard your thoughts make sure your reactions are the way that they're supposed to be amen what did Brother Braham say temper breeds temper is that right he says but love breeds love and he says if you're family goes to fussing with you he said fuss back I can't hear you no no no no I know I know know I've experienced it that's easier said than done that's easier said than done but I have learned in my lifetime that just stay calm amen if anything start apologizing if you really want to turn the situation around say honey I am sorry I upset you what can I do to make you happy it's all over with Folks at least with my wife I've got a good wife that's right sorry honey I distur I messed you up not always done it hello but I'm here to tell you when you get upset also it don't make any it makes for a fire that's right anyway I just thought about that Lord in any given trial like this there's always always you can you can get worse or your trials will make you stronger how many wants that in your life Lord let my trials my tests make me stronger amen I feel it I believe it amen they'll make you stronger I'll say this I understand these things much better now than what I have in the past amen amen there are a whole lot more of a reality to me amen and I thank God for his grace for his mercy and for his overcoming power isin't that right that is only through Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost and trust me when I tell you sometimes those battles rage I'm here to tell you the biggest battle is the battle that has raged in my mind amen that's the big battle is what it's a it's a mind battle said the biggest battle ever fought was right there between faith and doubt amen thank y'all for praying amen for all of us isn't that right for all of us thank you Jesus amen so tonight's lesson is it's not about the trial it's about your reaction to the trial don't worry about the test worry about your reaction to the test because that's what God is looking for that's exactly why God was angry with Israel huh you know how your flesh wants to say God why did you want why do you do this huh that's what the devil wants you to say you don't question God God's Sovereign I'm here to tell you tonight God knows just what he's doing amen God knows just what he's doing amen and he does it well we serve a awesome God we don't question God Amen we say God we are yours we're in your hands we're your children we know you're Our Shepherd you watch over us amen amen thank you all for everything amen thank you for loving one another how many believes we need to love one another stick together amen anything comes up anywhere throw it out cast out like Paul said casting out every reason every imagination bring every thought captive to the word of God but God said amen stand with me tonight if I go another another minute longer I won't have had a little short sermon God bless you I also want to say anytime anyone's prayer for anything if I don't open the altar now he want you just anytime you need something you just
