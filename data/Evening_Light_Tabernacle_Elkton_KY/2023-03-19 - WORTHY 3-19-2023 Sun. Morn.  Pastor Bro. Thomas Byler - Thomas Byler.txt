the Thrones of the House of David peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces because of the house of the Lord Our God I will seek thy good everyone can be seated brother Brian brother Brian's not here this morning but uh so so I'm going to be doing Sunday school so we'll see how it goes got some stuff together but usually some well a lot of times it don't go quite like you're playing it to go so that's that's life I guess but I know Let's uh if you could let's go to uh Luke here Luke 17. trust everybody's had a good week a little bit cold but we're heading in the right direction I believe so Luke 17 this is just a one little scripture we'll try to we'll bounce it through the scriptures just a little bit here and this is Jesus and uh kind of just going over things this morning be kind of like a glass half empty glass half full type of people what what kind of people are we so Jesus says here he's saying to his disciples then said he unto his disciples this is 17 1. it is impossible but that offenses will come but wound him through whom they come so Jesus was telling him his disciples that offenses are going to come he said it is impossible but that offense is will come so telling him that offenses are going to come so we know that offenses are coming so then what are we going to do when they come we have choices of how we act and react to him uh then let's go here let's see to Romans Romans 9 and we'll start in 20 here Romans 9 20. nay but oh man who art thou that replies against God shall the thing form say unto him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus and not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel onto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and make his power known endured with much long-suffering vessels of Wrath to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had for prepared under Glory even unto whom Heath called not of the Jews only but also the Gentiles people who can't see predestination that right there is a predestination scripture in my opinion I'll go back to Jeremiah talking about the Potter again and that's what come to church that's go down they say it go down to The Potter's House to be broken over and sometimes made over and get all that stuff out that we don't want in us anymore so uh Jeremiah chapter 18. and starting in verse 1 here the word which came to Jeremiah I can't wait just a little Jeremiah chapter 18 verse 1 the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words and then I went down to The Potter's House behold he wrought a work on the Wheel the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying O House of Israel cannot I do with you as this Potter saith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hands so are ye in my hands O House of Israel it's again just being made over by the Potter and uh sometimes well a lot of times things don't go it's quite like we always plan it just like coming up trying to prepare something it doesn't always go as you plant it that's that is kind of how life goes a lot of times we have a idea in our mind how things should go but a lot of times the Lord has a different different plan for us than what we think of that our life should go and so sometimes it gets hard well a lot of times it does get hard actually so but uh let's see uh so I was going back let's go to but it molds us and basically makes us into what God would have for us nobody wants really difficult situations and nobody wants buses and fights but sometimes that's what we have coming in our life it molds us makes us and presses into what God would want for us especially in today's age we don't want hardships uh we live in a really really easy easy age rich and they think they're they're increased with knowledge but strange knowledge but they but they're rich they don't want no hardships everything's supposed to be easy it's a ladyfc and age that we're living and they want smooth sailing but even as we look back through the scriptures a lot of times God God's people they didn't really have smooth ceilings a lot of times it got really rough like Paul he didn't he and this is the other thing we wouldn't choose our you guys might choose I wouldn't choose sometimes these hardships that come upon us but they're there for the pressing and the making of what we're supposed to be and how we're going to come out on the end Paul didn't he didn't want that thorn of thorn in his flesh because Paul he didn't even want that form of Flesh it was it wasn't his choice but God Did It for Paul to to bring humiliation so he said that he wouldn't get puffed up he said in him he's and when he realized that then Paul said he accepted it and he he glorified our Lord and glorified in his infirmities that's here in the last one here let's see I think it's over here such a one-hour Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirmities Paul speaking for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but how I forbear lest any man should think of me above that which you seeth me to be for that he heareth of me or that he heareth of me unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation there was given to me as a thorn in the flesh messenger of Satan to buff at me let's say should not be exalted above measure for this thing I ever sought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure and Infinities and risk approaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong Paul said and Brendan said it too well I'll read it I don't know you better let's see I got it right here brother Bear's talking about tensions and and tensions in life whoever speaking of how we have these different tensions and things speaking of tension I was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have any tension just think of it tension is a part of a living that kind of encouraged me when I thought of it that way had if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing nothing you could work on like a husband and wife me wants to do something they're trying to work together especially Christians the other one once then when you come together to you you find out what she's done she finds out see the tension really brings you closer together and somebody tells you that well said just think of the little wife that went under a lot of tension then you wasn't so good or the husband went under some tension when you wasn't so good and then it's all forgiven look how you feel about it uh he said see have tension that's all I think of of feet yo feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pains or nothing what if they're what be no no pain at all you'd have no feelings at all see if you had no feeling then one of your senses would be gone everything's uh God just give us Grace to stand up to it that's the thing if we just stand up with the grace and stand there and say we know that when this is life is over the great ones on the other side where we'll be looking to go to and we'll remember all these things that's tension and then some uh people uh some people tries to introduce Christianity and you feel free from worry he said no you're not you're free you're free from tension he said oh no you add tension when you become a Christian because you was kind of a slop go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a CR a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on attention puts you on a guard that's what makes you T makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing it's just the way where you're looking at it just the way you're looking at it if you just look at the other side there's no matter how thin you slice anything you still got two sides to it you see so you want to see both sides so tension I think is what's the tension if I could could have been born without this tension well it wouldn't have if I could have been wrong with us well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was a tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing thing to me so then as Paul said as though tension something another he had consulted the Lord take it away the Lord said Saul my Paul's Grace uh to Paul his grace is sufficient he said then I'll glory in my infirmities when when I'm weak I'm strong as long as the will of God all right and brother Branham says now I consulted him one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me this is about brother man talking about tension in his life about eight or ten years ago he said it'll never scare you again and it never has no sir don't worry about it I just feel it but I know it's there but I just go on because it doesn't scare me no more so thankful for that now this is what brother Brown said he said he could now he could have said it won't be there no more and that's why a lot of times we want we want it gone but he said you won't be scared no more so it is his will that it happens so I just embrace it and say thank you Lord I'll walk that way brother Branham said so that's how it was for brother Branham that's how it was for Paul I guess we sometimes think it might be different for us and sometimes it is sometimes the Lord takes things away from us and we don't have to worry about anymore and sometimes it bothers and lags and lags and lags on us it creates attention in our life but I believe that tension is to draw us back to Christ it and really uh you know it takes the Holy Ghost to say just like Paul said I've I've asked Thrice now for it to be taken away from me but it wasn't taken away from me Lord in in my weakness Thou Art strong I become strong so it takes the Holy Ghost to say that in those times because otherwise you know then there's a lot of people that do it they get angry at the situation and sometimes we we struggle through life it's not not easy but basically that's the idea you know is the tension that it's brought a lot of times for the breaking down of us and to really really help us a long life's journey I have a lot of other stuff here but that's pretty much what I had there so I don't know I think I'm about one time so Brother David of the Lord this morning I thought that was very good sure helped me and brother Woody said it helped him this morning and you know our heavenly father he knows what we have need of this morning

so let's just go before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we come before you thank the Lord Jesus to be assembled in your name once again father and in your presence Lord Jesus and to speak to your people your purchased of your blood father this morning we ask God that you would just have your way in a special way father today as always we ask for you to have the preeminence and that your spirit would just say the things God that we need to hear this morning Lord we ask God that you just help us Lord as bless the meditation of our heart father that which we feel you've laid it on our heart to speak about this morning Lord Lord we ask God that you would take every Spirit under your control Lord Jesus for your honor and For Your Glory we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen and amen praise the lord we want you to continue a little bit more on the thought that we had Wednesday amen taking from the same scriptures over in the Book of Revelations if you want to turn with me amen I just couldn't really get away from that thought amen and so we want to speak this morning on uh basically we want to speak on WE titled it worthy amen we talked about if we want to title it worthy let's talk I'm talking about worthiness amen amen so Revelations let's go with the fifth chapter I was going to read the very same scriptures that I read Wednesday but I want to um read the fifth chapter amen and we'll go from there and when I saw and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy amen now or that's what we're going to speak on worthiness who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much and I remember this that brother banham said that John the Revelator here was a type of the Bride amen of the church isn't it right and he was the type of it I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me wheat not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book into loose the Seven Seals thereof and I be held in low in the midst of the Throne of the and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders study lamb as it had been slain remember Wednesday we read over here in the fourth chapter in verse 80 talk about the four beasts and so forth amen into Four and Twenty Elders now we find to find these same people over here again now notice having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book now notice Thou Art Worthy how many believes that he is worthy this morning we want to take a look at some of the detailed words of why what he is worthy of that's going to be our Focus this morning okay what he is worthy of Amen notice to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou it was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and that's made us into our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands of thousands and I wrote down here do you reckon you're included in some of them amen I believe you're included in those tens of thousands and millions of people amen and notice what these people were saying saying with a loud voice ma'am noticed they fell down into saying with the loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain amen now but let's find out what he is worthy of Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature with now now notice now I want you before we read the next scripture brother bam said he put it this way he said every creature heard John worshiping the Lord heard me saying now notice in every creature which is in the heaven on Earth and under the Earth is such as artisty and all that are therein heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that setteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever amen amen I wrote down here she says you know forever worship and subtitling this forever worship how many Believes In Forever worship I Believe In Forever worship and the four be said amen and the Four and Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated [Music] oh I wrote down all these different things amen that he's worthy of but I want to read a couple more scriptures just to lay the foundation if I could Wednesday we read on the eighth verse of the fourth chapter it says and when those beasts give Glory let's go back up one and the four beasts verse eight and had each of them six wings about them and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day nor night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and which is and which is to come now part of my whole inspiration was the things that I've heard about Azusa Street and different revivals and when they start they don't stop they keep right on going you know the touch of Heaven A blending of heaven and worship the way that it is up there coming down even to where they even hear angels and uh and brother Branham talked about uh having I haven't heard that in certain churches in certain places you know how hard the Angelic choir would even join in you know how many knows that when we get over Yonder there's not going to be any night there so whatever you're gonna be doing you're going to be doing constantly yeah amen praise be to God you know I can't help but believe that if we're going to do something over there or be something over there that we're going to have to be at over on this side because remember father God said hi everyone you go from this Dimension to the other you mean you don't change it doesn't change your character or what you are amen so whatever we are here if we're worshipers here we'll be worshipers there amen everybody expects a magic wand over there there don't you know you know and I'll tell you what we might be a quiet maybe we're quiet worshipers here but I'm telling you why when we get over there we're going to make a lot of noise remember this is going to be a noisy place over there amen I'm gonna try to go to three o'clock all right [Laughter] I said I'm gonna try I said I didn't say I was gonna and maybe that's just me but I don't think for sure will follow the leading in the spirit is that okay all right so now notice here now that scares you all to death already I shouldn't do that all right so he said now notice here it says they said the rest not day or night amen saying holy holy holy I didn't believe that's going on right now holy holy holy holy holy holy amen is the Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come oh Revelations 1 and verse eight it says I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending talk about predestination for knowledge huh Bible says he's the beginning and he's the ending he already knows all of it he's the star he's the Finish he is he which was noticed in worshiping for what this is one of the reasons why they're worshiping him is because he is the one that was he's the one that is and he's the one that always will be you and I we've got a short little old lifespan here isn't that right but he don't never start he don't never finish he never stops he always wants help me with me I wrote down here I says man you have got to let it get all over you how many believe that you know I can preach I'm gonna preach this morning and if you'll open up because I'll tell you what as I study and as I read and as God reveals these things to me and as I hope put myself up for this it does some it does some awesome things really does something for you if you're going to get any out of church if you're going to get anything this morning you're going to have to just get it all up in it you're gonna have to let go amen get at it get all over you because I may I I'm a thorough believer for that well one thing but the man says we're living way below our privileges huh so I don't know about you but I'd rather come up a little I've been higher to my my privileges foreign amen and this is just going to be a start because all these things that we've read already we could probably take all summer on all summer on notice which is now notice the beginning and the end saith the Lord he didn't say God saith the Lord he just saith the Lord which is and which was now notice they said which was which isn't it to come his spirit says it which ears which was and which is to come the Almighty how many beliefs he's the Almighty amen Almighty I want to talk about how that he's worthy of Glory honor power nobody said let me see here in verse 11 of chapter four now I'd like for you to have your Bibles with me and follow me with me today if you would with these scriptures because sometimes I want you to just read it out there with me amen say it with me why because we're going to be saying it together over there isn't that right they're all saying it so we want to say it amen let's read chapter 4 verse 11 together thou are you there yet Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created now when you and I think of pleasure we think of fun don't we if we was to use the word pleasure we said we're going to go ahead and have some fun so God did his all this for his own fun for his own pleasure this is what God did for his own pleasure don't even think of telling God what to do and what he can't can't do amen foreign just blows my mind just the thought of God in that Isaiah 40 verse 20 it says there is no searching of his understanding our puny Minds aren't big enough to ever search God out and figure him out there is no searching of his understanding amen praise the Lord so we see here now I'm gonna I'm gonna cover some ground here with the help of the Lord but let's just talk about what he's worthy of and let me back up just a minute first of all the chapter that we just read to me I guess has to be one of the most outstanding chapters in The Bible why because if he is not worthy to redeem and take that book then All Is Lost all of humanity Adam and Eve and everybody from there on is gone they're all lost he has to absolutely throw us all into hell he has to be absolutely destroy everybody he's all lost if he is not worthy to take that book no man was found worthy and John began to weep you mean it's all lost huh and another one came and said don't weep God we find one that's Worthy I'm here to tell you we're going to talk about this through this season's changes of Eternity we're going to be worshiping this one that was Worthy how many believe it if y'all notice that all of the whole crop Heavenly Angels the 420 others all ten thousands times ten thousand they all fall down before him and a worship Him why because they said thou aren't Worthy he acts Worthy amen all right I want to secondly we're going to begin to talk about uh well let's just do this so we see here these four words we find in verse 9 of chapter four are you if you're with me he says and when those beasts give what they give Glory in honor and thanks now notice here that thanks comes in to play how many believe that in worshiping God thanks has to be into play it has to be in the play because why because of what he done we're grateful we're thankful for what he done give thanks with a grateful heart give thanks to the Holy One give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son amen enjoyed the Sunday school this morning but I tried but I had it right here on my sheet right here it says Paul gave glory to God in his weakness for when he is weak and God is strong amen glory praise the Lord notice give him glory that's one of the first topics we want to talk about once I get get started here give glory and honor and thanks to him that liveth forever and ever now I notice down in verse 11. when you've already seen glory honor Gloria Glory I am power also he's worthy of power because he has created all things and for thy plan were created I don't know if I'll get to it but it comes into my mind right now and I want to say it before I don't that is the Bible says one place the scripture says and I I read it and then I lost it but it says the whole earth is full of his glory how many believe that the Earth is full of his glory you can talk about one thing and praise be to God just to think of how that the sun makes a perfect a complete turn in 24 hours and it came perfect time why are you so excited about that well I'm excited because I know it's god making that happen amen that's just one the whole earth is full of his glory you can see God everywhere right amen something's happening to me I don't know just what it is but I like it something's happening to the world isn't that right it's getting darker and darker you know on Tuesday they're supposed to arrest Trump right and we all know in the all states are going to be a dark day because it's a representative of what they would do with any conservative what they want to do hello it's a dark hour the world's getting darker but God's doing people too that's what I'm looking for amen it's going to get darker it's going to get worse out there amen all right let's focus on this not the negative now let's look at this so he says also here and power you're worthy of honor and power for those created all things now over in verse 13 we go over it again if that's all right Worthy is a lamb that was verse 12 that to receive power okay notice power verse chapter 5 verse 12. if you want to follow now they were saying with a loud voice [Applause] you know I mean you know me I'm a loud person you know you clad people that's wonderful but I'm a loud person folks you know Worthy is the Lamb that was slam slain to receive receipt and here's another one wisdom boy that's going to be a good one when we get to that I'm just gonna say it get ahead of myself all right human beings they are so they're dumber than the animal kingdom now I'm not talking about Christians and people that serve in reverence God but I'm talking about the others because a cow's smart a horse is oh and you're not just some dumbass they're very smart they know who they are they know what they are and they do exactly what God has Instinct them to do they follow it to the letter you don't see you don't see a deer modifying or all these other birds modifying they make the nests like they always did they're smart they follow the things that God has given but Humanity they don't know whether they're male or female come on folks they look worse than you know and I say that they don't know who they are where'd he come from what they're here for and and I say that because of the prophet of God saying that morally our women have gotten worse than a dog or a or a hog or a dog or whatever else isn't that right he says our morals our morals are worse than the animal kingdom yeah that's right man with man win with you don't find that in the animal kingdom folks you find a big old fight going on that's right but now and as human beings boy oh boy when God created us can I say this he created us with the ability to become really dumb I said the ability to become but he also give the believer the ability to have the wisdom of God to be a son and daughter of God and to look like Christ how many believe that amen thank God for that Total Insanity didn't know what the prophet God said the whole world go into sanity and insane amen and that's where we are amen okay so that was just a little thought on wisdom God is the Fountain of all wisdom isn't that right all right so he's worthy of wisdom and spirit thanks thanks and honor and glory and also blessing amen how many know that we all enjoy the blessings of God but sometimes we need to bless God to bring those blessings back to him oh my God all right now notice isn't it something that we read it in chapter verse 12 and then and in third verse 13 he says it again and every creature is in heaven and earth and under the earth and the Sea and all over that are in heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power begin to be to him that sits on the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever think about it they're praising him forever and ever and ever [Music] oh my you get tired of church you sure gonna get tired over there huh what's the brother man say about church service he's a Believer can stay alive we have short services for those that come and maybe uh you know or not whatever it ought to be with the Lord and uh you know not to wear them out we want them to come back but we could say all night if the Holy Spirit comes and does something in that right believe you can because this is what we live for amen praise the Lord glory and honor and power those are the same blessing and honor and glory and power be to him that setteth on the throne amen and the four beasts said hey amen somebody tell me right quick raise your hand what does amen mean there you go brother Glenn very quick that means so beer oh my you see how that can do that is a worship word that's confirming God sin that's right God said it so let it be written so let it be done so be it if I said it show me it boy I mean if he would have just said that it said well I'm not so sure about that huh the devil got even said well you know maybe he doesn't really mean what he said no she should have said God show me it amen but we got a bride in his end time that believes that that's going to say so be it God said it he spoke it through a prophet I believe it that settles it straight is the gate listen to that sermon brother bam talks about there's millions and billions of so-called Christians that don't know more about God than the hot dot knows about Jones shoes and so forth so-called Christians I know why he said it because later on he talked about how God can come down and do the very same thing time and time and time and time again and they won't believe it yet they call themselves Christians let me tell you something when God come down and he spoke you are from so and so your name is from so and so and this Center the other that was a little longer brother Branham that was a lord Jesus Christ speaking through him doing the very same things he did back then and the world will burn because they don't believe that amen can I say El to you something good are you ready you will go to heaven because you do believe that he that believeth shall be saved he that believeth not my Works how can we work the works of God then disciples says believe on him who he has said it still stands true today believe who God sends because if you don't believe him don't try to tell me you didn't believe him back then everybody claims to believe him what he did on Calvary but when he comes right in front of him and does the very same thing then they call up the elzibar and of the devil you are of the devil claiming to be a Christian folks anyway that's free wasn't going to say that now but I just you know he got down on this generation on this bunch of Christians who call people that claim to be Christians and so forth and won't believe God when he does something amen I'm not following a man I'm following God through the man all right here we go so once and more let's look at find some more praise be to God all right I like this stop right here I gotta stop here just a second before we said amen and the 420 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever he fell down in worshiped forever and ever let me tell you something that God wants forever worship it's the devil was the devil was in heaven for billions of years maybe we don't know how long it was is that right but eventually it got old to him and he got jealous and had hatred and he had he had jealousy in him and he wanted to be a god like God was huh and even Jesus when he was here on the earth he says you know the word comes on some people oh and I'll tell you what the word makes him shout and they Rejoice for a season and the fine bye my goodness gracious brothers and sisters this pastor right here is so sick I see people coming and by going by the wayside God don't have much for quitters Paul said those that turn back my soul shall have no pleasure in him I would love people that stick with it God loves people that stick with it I'm here to worship God to serve God through eternity not just for a period of time or until the next trial comes up or the next test comes up or something bad happens I don't care what happens serve God anyway are you with me thank you brother Tommy that's the truth that's free too amen next one is found in Revelations the seventh chapter this was after uh the 644 000 I believe are sealed then there's another multitude that comes up okay in verse 9 of chapter seven it says and after this I be held in law a great multitude which no man could number of all Nations stood before the kindreds and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb Chloe with white robes and Palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation here's a new word for us huh what is it they're quite salvation to our god which sateth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell Before the Throne and uh the throne on their faces and worship God saying amen blessing Glory wisdom now notice not just thanks but it's Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen everybody can say Amen it's all right won't bother me a bit and God will love it that right the whole crowd honor now notice look at look at this how did every thing that was ever redeemed has got it in their hearts into their minds they give honor and glory and power and strength and blessing of Thanksgiving to almighty God how do we compare this morning don't you reckon we need some more of that in US that's why I'm preaching that this morning because I believe we need more of it right down in here last trip last scripture on picking up these different ones let me see what they got now I've got to wrote down riches wisdom strength blessing wisdom Thanksgiving got wisdom twice I guess and salvation all right be to him now according to the prophet of God we come back Revelations the 19th Chapter so turn to Revelation 19 chapter with me if you will then we'll go to we'll begin with verse one here's another bunch of people you're a quiet bunch or aren't they and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Hallelujah amen somebody tell me what Hallelujah means say it loud praise our God that's right it means the same thing in every language but a band says I think I can talk a little what was he call it friend uh uh not French but one of the language he says hallelujah Hallelujah notice Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor notice the whole crowd what do they say that he's worthy of all these things he's worthy of Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgment for he hath judged a great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and had Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said come on now Hallelujah that's right and her smoke rose up for ever and ever now notice here comes the 420 Bill to Elders again and the Four and Twenty Elders in the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne saying amen praise art let's just said so be it praise our God let's all say it so be it praise our God Amen Hallelujah I'm gonna start over here I ain't wait until I get over there when I die and I take my last breath folks I hope I get to just I hope I hope God allows you to hear me show me on the other side my body if I was to die I'll go by the grave might be laying right there may happen I don't know but Jay just let him know mother Marley made it over there did y'all hear that amen hallelujah whoo I want to live here doing it and I want to die and go over there if I go by the wayside over there amen because that's what we're going to be doing over there done I'd already been kicked out of the Amish church if I'd have been preaching up there this morning ain't gonna have all of that amen ah praise God now no so verse 4 saying amen hallelujah amen now notice a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great amen I don't care what your status in life is it don't matter your voice needs to be heard just as much amen and I heard as you were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and that's the voice of a mighty thundering saying Hallelujah for the Lord Our God omnipotent that means all powerful the all-powerful god rage we are so disappointed at who is reigning now but when we get over there it ain't gonna be no disappointment when the omnipotent bond is raining and as I'm taking this place over foreign I don't know about you but I'm excited for our future yeah we're talking about the future here a little bit but I'm excited about our future because I'm here to tell you one of these days it's going to materialize I may believe one of these days the body of Christ and then we're gonna see him in Disguise it's gonna materialize and this body is going to materialize you to a glorified body it's gonna happen it's gonna happen it's gonna happen that's what we need to get a mind it's gonna happen it's coming it's coming it's coming people don't have a revelation of that that's why they're so thoughtful so sloppy they think it's just going to keep on going like it is it's not going to keep on going like it is it's coming during the Brooklyn this ship this America's ship is taking on major water it's about to go down it's going down there's only one hope if only hope you only have one chance one hope of ever making it out of this alive and that's in this man that is a lamb that's Jesus Christ there was one that was found worthy to take the book it was Muhammad or Buddha or any of those it was the lamb that was slain on Calvary Worthy the only one that could redeem this back to God remember this book that we just read about it it is the book of redemption amen it's a book of redemption praise God amen I've had this tingling man night before last night couldn't even sleep on the couch it was so bad laying on my back just causing numbness and this out and the other and I know it's just this devil the last night I went to bed kind of thinking maybe it's going to be a bad night and I said Lord Jesus you know I want to do good tomorrow preaching your word so can you give me a good night's rest Lord I slept like a baby [Laughter] enough slept for a good long time straight on my back I said it ain't her nowhere please God huh God's still a Healer folks I don't care what symptoms several tries to put on you just go on God will take care of it amen all right you love him I want to love him more I want to dedicate myself more how many beliefs this morning you need to dedicate yourself more to God amen I believe that's what God is helping me do dedicate yourself more amen sure we're claimed to be Christians and serving God but you know dedicated our time our thought our everything to him 24 7 it's all about God and I like this let's go on came out of the throne saying praise our God ye servants and he heard a great voice of money multitudes and many thunderings saying hallelujah the Lord Our God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad amen how many believes I came to give you Joy that more abundantly life and met more abundantly joy unspeakable let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him honor I guess is one of the first things I want to talk about this morning as we get started honor let's rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready amen praise the Lord that's what we got to do let's give honor to him we're going to start with that for just a minute honor honor I thought about that in God said over in Malachi 1 and verse six he says the son honereth his father and a servant his master if then I be a father where is my honor if I be a master where is my fear saith the Lord unto uh the Lord unto the hosts of hosts unto you how many believe that God is worthy of honor amen now there's something I want to cover at I want to go back and I want to cover a little bit before we're going into it too heavy we realize that without God you're nothing now some people think they are so I'm thinking sure we're here we live out our lives but eventually you'll actually come to nothing I mean you'll cease to exist you'll become extinct never be without God you are going to become extinct you're nothing without God and anything that you have has been given to you by God that's why he's worthy of it all amen this our flesh begins to fade you can begin to lose your strength huh you lose your glory that's right the glory of young man as his strengthened and so forth but all of that Fades away amen as we get older we begin to think about our deathbed we think about how that we're going to go amen brother Daryl Hampton brother Stephen called me last night he says you know that he had a uh four different bleedings into his brains a major uh stroke so forth they don't know whether he's even going to make it and so forth and he said he's only 64. I look at it and I'm 61. well I'm not that far off how many tells you every day is Grace for any of us I don't care what age you are but you got to realize something and that is that you in our flesh we are just like grass we're like a flower you know right that comes and it blooms and then it lasts for a while then it's gone but the Lord that's why we look to God that's why we look to him look unto me and be saved aren't you glad that there's one that you can look to in this world and to know that in the spite of all the perishing that's going on you don't have to perish amen because if we have that lamb that was worthy to take the book let's look at how God see things first of all we know that God is omnipotent he reigneth he truly reigneth and I want to talk I'll bring into some of that when we talk about his power because I want to talk about his glory his honor and power this morning I'd like to cover those three if I could but first I want to talk about how that without God you have no strength there's no glory there's no honor and God doesn't share his honor or his glory Bible talks about he won't share his glory with another right so let's talk about this flesh for syllabus because we know that this flesh some some people don't even realize that they're Triune beings how many knows that a lot of us whenever we first had the circle up here and we had brother Branham drawn out how they were a threefold purpose uh threefold being an audit the outside is the flesh see taste feel here and smell and so forth and then there's on the inside there's another part of you that's the spirit being so most people don't even think they don't think about that Spirit that's on the inside of them isn't that right and the things that they do allow those spirits to come and make them miserable and they're completely miserable because they don't even understand who they really are and then on the inside of the inside inside of that Spirit on the inside is the real you it's called your soul now unfortunately that's the one that people think about the least people think about their soul the least we put so much I wrote on a reinvest so much in this flesh huh I put a different tie on this morning and didn't have a pin for it and I said oh I'll try a different eye come Wednesday I said well honey this is a terrible matching isn't it she says no that's great you do wonderful after 30 years of experience you ought to have a little bit of a taste and be putting things together but I still question myself it's got a match and so you know I tried to make sure I match right try to do this out of the other we put so much in our flesh because we want to look right we want to dress right we want to have our hair right is that right but what about making sure that when we come to the house of God your spirit is right your attitude is right you're kind you're sweet you're loving that spirit is just how it's we ought to invest more in making sure we got the right attitude that we've got the right spirit because that matters more than you flushed us how many knows you might be ugly as Sin and you may not have watched for a week but if your Soul's watch you can jump up without [Music] me Joy comes from the inside not just outside that's why so many out there the whole world is absolutely failing to get the joy that they want because you're trying to do it with the fleshly appetites and it never will work it has to be in the spirit realm you got to care about that Spirit on the inside and not just the spirit but that Soul that's on the inside people don't think but they don't they don't never think about what they're going to spend eternity or that they're going to lose their life because how many know that's why Jesus came is that you might have life he came to that you could your life could be spared because we were all Damned the whole world is was Damned amen oh mankind was dimmed but God came to save all of mankind so it's important not so much the flesh flesh Prophet as little Paul said don't mean much amen time goes so swiftly I'm so fast but that spirit and in that soul I think the properly God said one place he said you know that well I'll tell you you go to a restaurant and you find a a bug a roach in your peep stuck on the cheese you're going to have a problem I need a big old I need a super Pizza okay give me a big old Super Pizza I'm gonna eat it and I don't want to be charged for none of it trying to feed me a bug that's how we are right I wouldn't have no doubt they would say we're so sorry let me get you another one and a fresh one if you won't walk out and if you don't you're going to be taking a knot and looking around right now right I'm gonna say something I'll tell you what if I'd ever get in a squabble or whatever with somebody about my food I wouldn't say go make me another one I would leave because it probably spitted or something because they don't like the way you just did them as a Christian isn't that right to make somebody seem so upset you spit in your food in the first place be nice about it you probably wouldn't have to worry about it isn't that right but what do you say but then sometimes you'll cram you'll let the devil get on your iPhone wherever whatever and cram mess in your your Facebook this Saturday or the other and you'll feed that Soul a bunch of junk then you come to church and wonder where the Holy Ghost is and why the preacher can't preach and why you don't feel the way that you ought to do hello it's because you got to watch what you're feeding your soul watch what you're feeding your spirit man that controls his spirit is mightier than the man that takes a city if you can control your spirit kind of spirit that you have you are mightier than uh Napoleon that could take a whole world almost he could not control his own Spirit died of alcoholic because he never could conquer himself huh amen Lord help us for God amen [Music] because I'll tell you this in Isaiah 40 verse 6. it says the voice cried and the voice cried and said on well he said wait a minute and the voice said cry and he said what shall I cry cry that all flesh is grass grass don't you know that we're made out of the same material grass is made out of and the dirt was made out of 16 elements of the Earth why she's not not a bunch of grass bunch of dirt and they're all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth and the flower fadeth amen because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon him but surely the people is grass your flesh don't mean much folks it doesn't mean a whole lot if you think it's so wonderful and so gorgeous and so beautiful go out there and dig one of these days up and look at that bunch of pile of bones and that rottenness it's not so much amen grass the grass withers the flower fadeth but the word of Our Lord shall stand forever [Music] how many so glad that when Peters talk about being born again we're born again it says by the word of God he talks about that when she's a flashy slash but that which is of the spirit and spirit and you and I are not born of his flesh but if you're a child of God you have been born by God's word and God's word endures forever I mean he's glad for that to be born by the word of God not not just flesh anymore there's something down in here that's warned by the word of God laughs how am I think about it that by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe that word into your heart it quickens that seeds on the inside you come to life and you have eternal life down in verse 12. who have measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and mean it out to heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure and the mountains and scales and the hills and the balance who hath directed The Spirit of the Lord will be in his counselor had taught him this comes with being the wisdom of God how many knows he is all wisdom this also comes with the power of almighty God all right with whom to key Council and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as a small dust of a balance all these nations mean absolutely very little to God they're nothing compared to him behold you take up the owls as a very little thing verse 17 in all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity how many as we get to think in so much of ourself people think so much of their self the world thinks so much of their self when they're nothing notice how God says less than nothing that means minus zero minus because without God it had really been better for you to never have been born now what he said about Judas and so forth it'd have been better for him not have been born less than nothing because God is every I'm trying to say God is everything people he's everything he has to mean everything to you beat you this morning he has to be everything to you he is my everything he is my all he is my everything both great and small we sing that song and that's what he needs to be every day of your life isn't it something how we invest so much time in this flesh not enough in the soul not enough in the spirit God help us right Lord help us to invest more time to making sure our soul is right and our spirit is right amen and I hope that time is right all right amen all right I want to did we start with honor honor yes I believe it's so important that we honor God and having studied this and prayed about this and getting closer to the Lord I realized Lord help me to honor you in the way that I live the things I do the clothes I wear everything that I do Lord let it bring honor and glory to your name how many knows you're sitting in church this morning because you want to honor God we want to honor we want to reverence him honor he is worthy of respect he's worthy of honor all of our leaders and so forth they think that they are that you've got the honor and you got to re respect them but what about God where she's on her he is deserving of all honor foreign David always honored God did he David honored and glorified God I want to talk to you about some of them that honored God and some of them didn't David was one that honored God he give God to credit for the lion and for the bear remember he didn't come say I'm going to come and I'm going to do this to you and I'm going to do that to you no he says my God that delivered that bear into my hand the god that delivered them but uh lying into my hands he will deliver you God will do it how many blades no matter what if you're ever gonna achieve anything do anything it's going to be God that does it he's worthy of honor and Glory Nebuchadnezzar was one that didn't honor God and that he thought that what he did he had done oh my not sure if I uh okay we're gonna read a little bit is that okay in Daniel the fourth chapter Daniel 4. we want to read about King Nebuchadnezzar that did not give honor to God the way that he should have one place Brother Band makes a statement he says if you don't bring honor and glory to God you're going to find yourself a cold backslitting person someday I mean because we got to honor and glorify God amen in Daniel 4 and verse 28. all this Came Upon King Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Allah Babylon the King's bacon said is not discrete Babylon that I have built for the house of the King by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty boy he was really stuck up wasn't he he really thought he had done something and if you'll remember what we just got through was that Nebuchadnezzar had a dream oh my man I didn't have time to do it but yesterday taking a nap I I played Daniel and and and before I fell asleep I read where he talks about how to you know uh Nebuchadnezzar was going to kill all of these uh wise men and uh magicians and all of you go I'm gonna kill every last one of you if you don't tell me what my dream was and the interpretation of it they were telling him no King they ain't a man alive that can tell you the dream and then the interpretation huh ain't nobody like that in the world nobody no King has said he said no all you're going to do is give me a bunch of Lies if I tell you the dream you're gonna lie to me about what the interpretation is basically is what he said and they were about to go out there and kill him and the leader of them the leader of the ones that were supposed to kill him Daniel came up to him after praying about it and God showing him the dream he says now hold off a minute I got something for you and Daniel come before the king he says I want you to know that there's a God in heaven that reveals secrets the same thing people come and say brother banham I want you to tell about the interpretation of my dream and he said just be quiet this is what you dreamed and this is the interpretation he tell him what he dreamed that wasn't better Branham that was God very same God here huh aren't you glad not just back in Daniel's there but in your name that ain't worth shouting about I don't know what is when we think about it the brother Madam could have been so famous he's gonna be that but he always give God the glory how many so people man people wanna oh be even preachers oh I'm a good preacher I'm fancy no you ain't nothing unless it's God you're just a sinner saved by grace if there's any credit that goes to God give God the glory if God the honor he's worthy of it if you have strength if you have breasts give God glory he's the one to give it to you [Music] laughs you even gotta flavor of happiness and joys because of the grace of almighty God but here he was thinking oh I did this and I did that folks when you get to thinking you did this and you did that you're in trouble and for the honor of my Majesty while the word was in a king's mouth their fellow voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar today it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and that dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high rulift in the Kingdom of men how many believe that that he's still on the throne he still ruled the kingdom of man let me pick up power for just a minute let me know Jesus said when he left he says all power is given unto me in heaven and the Earth their Ephesians this is the ascended above principalities above Powers against rulers of Darkness entities above all of the powers and principles he's above it all there ain't no Kingdom in America George Washington he didn't just happen to cross the Delaware and get lucky and get that battle one no this America would have never been formed unless God would allow it to form amen no reason Rises or Falls but but God's permission he's the one that controls it the Bible clearly states it amen all right he most high ruleth in the Kingdom of man and giveth it to whomsoever he will amen folks all of these everybody that has these nukes huh all of these dudes that we can say well I don't know I'll tell you what this North Korea could just amen they could just blow us up anytime or cube or or do some of the other all the submarines they got everywhere you have to be land-based you're going to Continental they can go with

period huh God has control I don't care how smart you are or Think You Are God is the one that controls it remember what was it belty Shazer he thought he was all safe and secure behind the Babylonian walls isn't that right ain't nobody ever penetrated these walls nobody coming up in here let's have a party bring some of them silver vessels from the temple that we got out of the juices out of the other let's have as a drunken Rock and Roll Party and it is but in the midst of it all God come down and he wrote with his hand isn't that right you can wait in the fallance and found warranty amen at the same time this all was happening the enemy was out there changing and the current of a river the river that came right up underneath the walls it very veered off the river and they came right in under the walls and they were coming right through I think says they would come through the walls underneath just as they were speaking and trembling in their shoes and taking over don't think to yourself Mark God has a way of getting defeating you same with America didn't know what he said about America we think we're so safe and our powerful power that we have it don't mean nothing to God he is the god that's worthy of all power when I think we're not just letting it go into my mind to think of how to God you know talk about power for just a minute is that right whenever we come to the moon when we went to the moon right wasn't that a great time everybody in schools they let them all out and everybody was watching the little bitty old blurry screen to head back then and oh my the President Kennedy or one of them said he was a what one small step for man when that man uh uh forget his name step on the moon right he stepped on the moon all the schools everybody it was one great it's fine might have been a small step from man but it was a giant step for mankind wow we did something you don't find nothing but a bunch of rocks when you get there why did you waste all that precious money boy when I go to heaven I'ma pass the moon so fast fast I won't even barely even see it oh they can have man can have such a great time of the power on Jesus and all these fast he's out of the other or the power of this and power that why don't you give God the glory and realize he is the one that is all powerful huh such a fuss over jumping on the moon we ought to be jumping around because of the creator that made the Moon how about the power it took to hang that big ball up there how about the power he took to hang the stars out there and the moon and Jupiter and Mars and Venus and all these galaxies of stars they don't go praise people will scream and hollering jumping carry on with football games and all of this that or the other what they can do and give honor to them but the god that huh they don't give him no honor they don't give him no glory oh yeah Bill's shout and worship worship them footballs foreign worship them basketball worship this and worship baton oh my it's all great it's all nothing to God and to a Christian if you'll turn your eyes on Jesus look full in this wonderful face you'll realize that the things of this earth grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and his grace he thinks his fade away amen how many beliefs Paul said I don't come to you with enticing words of man wisdom that your faith wouldn't rest in the wisdom of man but it would thrust into power oh a power that could forgive you of your sin of power that could direct Lazarus from the dead that's some power a power that could change somebody like Tommy over there huh that man for nothing good to have that man he wouldn't listen for nothing God got his attention take the power of almighty God to change your man to change his nature changes desires oh I feel that power working already you are more of the power of God than yours more the power of God for you to have not for you to notice I'm in the seasons and so forth but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come upon you don't be like those amen that have a form of godliness but to deny the power thereof even Jesus said about the Pharisees you by your Traditions have to make the word of God and on effect it's powerless because of your traditions and the stuff that you mix in amen Lord help us power yeah that's real power real power I should love those that hate you real powers that pray for those that despitefully use you real powers to be able to turn your other cheek huh real power [Music] real power isn't to be able to run all over the building and scream and shout and all this out of the other but real power and real strength comes from you being able to surrender yourself to God show me a man that is surrendered to God and I'll show you the power of God all right my oh my we're just basking in it this morning don't you enjoy it for asking in the power of God the word that's coming forth is power if you'll receive it folks it's enough power right here to change you to give you victory over sin to give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory if you just get yourself out of the way and say that's what I want brother boiler [Music] God hates a powerless religion why because God is full of power think of what it took to make all that and then I thought about faith brother toy of faith how that God just wants you to believe how that we can believe and receive and put ourselves completely in the trust of almighty God made all these things your little problems ain't nothing Goliath was absolutely nothing no wonder this just comes fresh no wonder he said that nations are nothing but a drop of a bucket they don't mean nothing they're less than nothing he can take one man Moses and they stop I oh Nation just take one man in his hand and I'll destroy the biggest army there ever was don't mean nothing to God less than nothing and that's the god that you and I served this morning that's why we're all so quiet about it yeah I guess God could maybe he will I'll be like Shadrach Meshach and the Bendigo I don't know if you will but I know that he can't one thing we know we're not bound down oh he got mad isn't that right he got mad and he fired that thing up oh I want to say something God help people that tried to manipulate things and change things by their own carnal ways you'll never get free you'll never win against God with your carnal ways and what you think you can do it'll never work you'll be defeated every single time but trust in the power of God put yourself in his hands and watch him come on the scene God loves to do it oh my can you imagine how God could have showed his power if he wanted to but he's killed his grace and his mercy and he showed that he was real to our generation he showed that he is real to see if people will do it we don't see him in all of his glory now how many knows where he's beat down he's the all-scouring of the Earth the other but when he comes in oh when Jesus comes in his glory it is Glory oh flesh it says I will see his glory praise the Lord talk about power and Nebuchadnezzar here taking it for himself folks let me continue this is verse 33 now of Daniel the fourth chapter seven times well I'll pass over thee and thou that thou mayest know that the most high rulerth in the Kingdom of men oh my aren't you glad that he's ruling in your kingdom I mean his kingdom God is inside of you and you how many glad to have Christ's ruling in your world I was thinking about Revival and how people have Revival and to get all inspired about God and get all fired up by God and so forth but you know I thought you know God doesn't want you to just get fired up for him for a week or two or a month or two no he doesn't want you to have a Revival and we read Wednesday if you didn't hear Wednesday how to even the problem God brought it out he said Jesus died so that you could live in that you kind of Glory 24 7. if you ain't been into Revival for six months I mean you don't need to get pumped up stirred up or whatever you ain't got to come to church to pump up why you can stay pumped up you stayed primed up you stay in the power of the Holy Ghost that's where you can live he says can a person live that way Glory [Music] yes you can foreign but boy you'll have to fight this here won't you there's old flesh you'll have to fight it real hard I know I know it's getting you to where man you're trying to put a big old high bar up here for you but about are you putting too high a bar up here for people can't never get that high don't you lie to me somebody did other bam says you see people that reach that place and you wonder whether you can he says he didn't make it just for some of us and some of us not no he made sure that we could all live in there and everything else is excuses amen all right I'll contain myself all right I'll calm myself down for now you love the Lord isn't he isn't it great oh when I think about how blessed we are to have a god like we do to have that comforter with you whatever you go how many needs more of it on a larger time frame than what you've got see like I need it more than what I got I need God 24 7. I need that Holy Spirit 24. I want to be in that Fellowship 24 7. then I want to tell you by the Holy Spirit saying I believe that you got to quit letting the thing this world taken out of you too busy not enough time no time huh did I hit the mark did I hit the nail that's exactly right we've got no time to pray we got no time to read we got no time to meditate because it's on everything else I know I'm the preacher I know what it's like when you get your mind somewhere else too far too long it's hard to get back in it but I'm determined more than ever I want to surrender yourself myself more to God I want more of this I want more of God I want more of Jesus more and more and more I want more of Jesus amen so I'll give you more of me gotta give him more amen praise the Lord all right now we're ready to start

power now in glory and giveth it to whomsoever he will and that's something how the Holy Spirit just pulled that in taking that River even though he thought he was so secure underneath it came can I say something else that just comes to mind didn't brother Brown says don't worry about the the the the Woodpecker the bird that's pecking on the outside worry about the worm that's on the inside of the Apple don't worry about the Communists out there we're almost taken over by the commies now that's right I don't care who out there here the commies Communists have almost taken us over that's right you should hear those reporters saying we are a police state now we are a police state the only question is to the extent that we are when we can arrest somebody that we don't want to run for president we can do that we don't want him to run and what he's done what they're charging him of is nothing compared to what they've done not even a little smidgen close to him let me tell you something that's some pure evil that's right Pure Evil I don't care who hears it that's the truth huh that's where we're at folks won't be long come after you come after me come after your land come after your mommy land our money your money whatever it is and it's all perfectly according to the scriptures perfectly fulfilling the scriptures supposed to come but guess what there's a bride that's getting ready to get out of here that's the question are you ready this morning are you ready to get out of here amen I want to be ready oh my because it just comes to mind remember he said when that squeeze comes it's already too late it'll be too late then remember brother bam saying that when that comes and there'll be a time when people won't be able to be saved I went in this morning if you're not in this morning kidding this morning finished epic members nether here and the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did he grass and as oxen and his body was wet but the Dew of Heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers that's pretty long ah like a woman sure enough and his nails like birds claws I don't know about you but you see my nails probably not because I have a real good nail clipper I don't know why he didn't think about it just go ahead and chew him off like I do but he grew long nails I don't know if we'll ever get to see him Brother Brad or not a picture of Nebuchadnezzar when he was out in the field let's see what he looked like long hair beard looked like Moses Maybe only worse because I'm sure Moses cut his hair and at the end of days the days Nebuchadnezzar lifted up his eyes unto heaven mine and mine understanding returned unto me and I and I blessed the most high and I praised and honored him do you realize over in Revelation it talks about when those plagues come and says and they would they repented not to give him glory all of our Revelations so people will not give him going they'll not get him out anymore but there's a group of people here that does I mean honoring and bringing glory to almighty God but now he praised him he honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generations and all the inhabitants are of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of Heaven uh aren't you glad there's Army in heaven remember Elijah showed his servants he says open his eyes he says that he might see that the syrians that are down there by the droves there's more of us than there is of them and he opened his eyes and the whole hillsides and everything was filled with chariots and I'm not sure if it wasn't the fire fire horses of fire and chariots they were all them serious didn't have a chance can I just say something can you imagine what it was like in the spiritual realm when all of the Philistines and remember when they would kill each other and all these things that they do can you imagine the Army those armies of Charities to come down there and wipe them all out in the spiritual Realm the armies of Heaven praise be to God you've got him on your side this morning I may believe that you've got them on your side and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what do is thou at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom and my honor and brightness return unto me and my counselors established in my kingdom and excellent Majesty was added unto me and now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of Heaven how many can say that I was a right low down Senator but he come and he saved me he picked me up and everything I have everything I have all that I am and I'll go see him now I praise I excel I honor I praise him I mean with me we praise him for what he is we got glorify him for what he is cause he's worthy of honor and glory and power and strength and you name
