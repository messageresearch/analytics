[19:36] richly
[19:37] amen i want to speak on something that i
[19:39] just heard brother brandon making a
[19:41] statement that kind of stuck with me and
[19:42] i decided
[19:43] that i'd like to take a sermon on at one
[19:45] time amen
[19:47] and so he made he was preaching and he
[19:49] says he said
[19:50] makes the statement that sometimes
[19:52] preachers and sometimes people
[19:55] i mean they paint too pretty a picture
[19:57] for christians
[19:58] amen and make it sound like it's too
[20:00] easy and they make it too easy for
[20:02] christians amen
[20:04] and so tonight we want to look at the
[20:05] christian life amen i call it the
[20:07] christian life and how to
[20:08] how rugged a christian life is amen
[20:12] and so we'll go over things that we've
[20:13] certainly heard before but i just trust
[20:15] it'll be a blessing to you
[20:16] amen let's bow our heads lord jesus we
[20:18] come before you father once again
[20:20] assembling ourselves together
[20:22] as you have asked us to do in your name
[20:24] and you have promised god when we do
[20:26] this
[20:26] that's wherever two or three would be
[20:28] gathered in your myth that
[20:30] would be gathered there you would be in
[20:32] our midst lord and father we just desire
[20:34] lord jesus that you would just
[20:36] look upon every request every need the
[20:38] lord that's represented father we know
[20:40] that you know
[20:41] every need that's here lord and in the
[20:44] heart of every
[20:45] person we just lord ask god that you
[20:47] would
[20:48] meet that need lord and then father if
[20:50] there's anyone that
[20:51] you'd like to speak to we ask god you
[20:53] just speak the hearts tonight lord and
[20:55] minister to them by the way of your word
[20:57] lord and help us to be better christians
[20:59] lord tonight after we leave than what
[21:01] we've come and we just ask god you're
[21:03] blessing upon the reading of the word
[21:05] now in the name of jesus christ
[21:07] amen and amen if you will turn your
[21:09] bibles
[21:10] amen we'll begin with the book of
[21:12] hebrews
[21:14] amen the book of hebrews the second
[21:16] chapter
[21:17] hebrews 2 and we want to dwell on this
[21:20] for just
[21:21] a little bit here at the beginning
[21:26] amen so the idea is that the christian
[21:29] life how many knows
[21:30] it's actually a rugged life it's not a
[21:33] flowery bed of ease is it no that's not
[21:37] what it is amen
[21:38] and i thought i thought uh
[21:41] you know because what i'm going to say
[21:44] and and things that i'm going to read
[21:46] it's going to
[21:48] it's pretty uh pretty rough really
[21:52] amen and i thought since by god's grace
[21:55] a lot of the things that we read amen
[21:58] you and i
[21:59] aren't really experiencing i mean we
[22:02] don't see it
[22:03] in our age amen at least not yet
[22:06] and we trust that before some of these
[22:08] things happen that we would be gone
[22:11] so anyway we'll start with hebrews the
[22:13] second chapter
[22:14] hebrews 2 and first i want to talk about
[22:18] uh taking things for granted amen
[22:21] and letting things slip and so forth
[22:24] neglecting things
[22:25] and so forth and that you know before we
[22:28] get into some of these other scriptures
[22:30] hebrews the second chapter verse one
[22:32] through three
[22:35] it says therefore we ought to give the
[22:37] more earnest heed to the things which we
[22:39] have heard
[22:40] at least at any time we should let them
[22:43] slip
[22:44] for if the word spoken by angels was
[22:46] steadfast and every transgression and
[22:49] disobedience
[22:51] received a just recompense of reward
[22:54] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[22:57] great as salvation which at the first
[22:59] began to be spoken by the lord and was
[23:02] confirmed
[23:03] unto us by them that heard him amen my
[23:06] god it is blessings to reading of the
[23:07] word you can be seated
[23:10] amen that word earnest
[23:14] in that verse one if you'll notice he
[23:17] says we ought to give them more
[23:19] earnest heed amen we might use another
[23:22] word for that and call it
[23:24] serious yeah we have to be more serious
[23:28] about what we have heard how many knows
[23:30] that
[23:31] as a person amen uh
[23:35] in a hole in a hole i believe that
[23:37] christians
[23:39] are serious amen amen now we realize
[23:42] that you can be seriously wrong
[23:44] you know right there's a lot of people
[23:47] that are serious but they're seriously
[23:49] wrong
[23:50] but at the same point and at the same
[23:53] time if you want to get anywhere with
[23:54] god or get anywhere period
[23:56] the one thing that you can't be is
[23:58] somebody that's just
[24:00] a gesture or just a joke or take
[24:02] everything for a joke
[24:04] and laugh about everything you have to
[24:06] have a certain amount of sincerity
[24:08] i mean believe that you got to be
[24:09] sincere and that's what he's saying here
[24:12] he says you know
[24:13] we ought to give very earnest heed to
[24:16] things that you hear
[24:18] not uh because we as human beings i'll
[24:21] tell you this right now as human beings
[24:24] we're the slippiness people in the face
[24:26] of the earth
[24:27] all right you know because if we didn't
[24:31] slip if people would actually learn from
[24:33] their mistakes
[24:34] all right if we would actually take
[24:36] things serious
[24:38] you would look at history and you would
[24:39] look at what happens
[24:41] and you would try not to repeat it isn't
[24:44] that right
[24:44] but how many knows that humanity humans
[24:47] in general
[24:48] have an absolute tendency to repeat
[24:51] the same mistakes amen no matter how
[24:54] much they know it no matter how
[24:56] much they've seen it no matter how many
[24:58] how much they
[24:59] uh you know you know and uh i'll tell
[25:01] you i mean it's just amazing
[25:03] how that people will actually do the
[25:05] same things over and over again
[25:08] amen because they don't take it to heart
[25:10] they don't
[25:11] take it serious amen
[25:15] and so we can look at several different
[25:18] examples you know because
[25:19] and i want to talk about negligence you
[25:21] know insincerity leads to negligence
[25:24] right negligence amen and taking things
[25:28] for granted
[25:29] you know people just take things for
[25:31] granted and so
[25:33] and they pay for that how many knows
[25:35] that whenever you take things for
[25:36] granted you pay for it
[25:38] when you neglect things you end up
[25:40] paying the price
[25:42] people all the way back in noah's time
[25:45] how many knows they
[25:46] they expressed and they uh really
[25:49] expressed this to the
[25:51] fullest extent of actually neglecting
[25:56] something that was vindicated and proven
[25:59] something that was absolutely the truth
[26:01] amen they neglected to hear noah
[26:05] isn't that right and because of their
[26:06] negligence amen they took it for granted
[26:09] they just took noah for granted
[26:12] amen and for 120 years god was merciful
[26:15] to them in that hour
[26:17] amen and listen so it says in verse 2 if
[26:21] the word spoken by
[26:23] angels was steadfast and every
[26:26] transgression and
[26:27] disobedience right received a wreck
[26:30] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[26:33] escape
[26:34] so it talks about angels that spoke
[26:36] things angels would come
[26:38] and they'll speak things even in the old
[26:40] testament whether it was to moses
[26:42] and different ones angels would come and
[26:44] they would speak
[26:45] amen in every transgression amen
[26:49] received a recompense a just recompense
[26:53] of reward
[26:54] so whenever you like to hear
[26:58] and whenever you uh you know take things
[27:01] for granted whenever you're not
[27:02] serious about things there's always a
[27:05] great
[27:06] penalty that comes with it now you take
[27:08] this salvation that he's talking about
[27:10] how that the lord came and he's what he
[27:12] do what the salvation was that
[27:14] you know that god so loved the world
[27:16] that he gave his only begotten son that
[27:17] whosoever should believe him
[27:18] should not perish but have everlasting
[27:21] life
[27:24] now how many knows there's a there's a
[27:26] penalty there's a
[27:28] there's a reward that comes with not
[27:30] hearing
[27:31] the son of god and this gospel amen
[27:34] there's a reward that comes with it he
[27:37] that believeth
[27:38] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[27:40] shall be damned
[27:42] now what if the whole world would take
[27:44] these things serious
[27:48] huh where would the world be at if
[27:52] everybody actually took it serious
[27:56] was serious about it and realized that
[27:58] you know
[27:59] you shouldn't take this for granted
[28:01] because
[28:02] it is going to happen if you neglect it
[28:06] you are
[28:06] going to perish you're going to lose
[28:08] your life
[28:10] amen all right so i believe there's a
[28:14] level of sicilia that we gotta
[28:16] approach god with amen truly
[28:19] have to do so now notice um
[28:23] you know even you know you just take
[28:25] many different
[28:26] examples you know people just take god's
[28:30] word for granted
[28:31] they don't take it serious the bible
[28:33] says that in the last days there will be
[28:36] scoffers and that right
[28:37] there was they there were scoffers in
[28:39] the days of noah
[28:41] amen that made fun of noah they'll be
[28:44] scoffers in the last days saying
[28:47] where is the promise of his coming
[28:50] you know god ain't coming god's word
[28:52] ain't true
[28:55] you know what people say and that's what
[28:56] people thinking
[28:58] you know you know for since the fathers
[29:00] fell asleep all things remain that they
[29:02] weren't they're
[29:03] absolutely taking it for granted they're
[29:06] not taking it serious
[29:10] amen
[29:14] oh my but you know how many knows that
[29:16] we realize
[29:17] that it's going to happen it's coming
[29:20] it's going to happen so we take it
[29:22] serious tonight that's why we come to
[29:24] church on wednesday because we
[29:26] realize this world's going to end and we
[29:28] need to have our eyes
[29:29] on another world we need to have our
[29:32] eyes on what's going to happen
[29:35] if you know your electric bill is going
[29:37] to come due in about two weeks guess
[29:38] what you're gonna make sure you got
[29:40] money to pay for it
[29:41] you don't neglect it man because if you
[29:44] neglect it they'll come and shut
[29:45] off they'll come and shut your power off
[29:48] if you neglect to see and take care of
[29:50] something that you see
[29:51] coming in the future amen
[29:56] so we look at this you look at the storm
[29:59] in florida you know that man he just
[30:01] neglected it he
[30:02] took it for granted that hey this storm
[30:04] ain't gonna do nothing
[30:05] only thing he had to do is get in his
[30:07] car take his family and go for a little
[30:10] ride
[30:10] for maybe 24 hours because those storms
[30:13] don't last all that long
[30:14] you know just go somewhere else for a
[30:16] little bit
[30:17] but no he couldn't do that he wasn't
[30:19] going to believe no matter what they
[30:21] said
[30:21] he was going to be absolute negligence
[30:23] he was going to take it for granted
[30:25] amen he's not going to take it serious
[30:27] what did he call
[30:28] it cost him his life his wife's life his
[30:31] children's life
[30:33] because he didn't take it serious
[30:36] amen he was slothful
[30:40] about it he was he just kind of let it
[30:44] slip
[30:44] he let it slide you do that
[30:48] and you pay the price amen
[30:52] and i thought about that and i thought
[30:53] about how that you know
[30:56] we're living in a lay odyssey age
[31:00] we're living in that age that certainly
[31:03] has let things slip
[31:08] when you let things slip you just kind
[31:11] of
[31:12] become wishy-washy
[31:17] you become like a jellyfish
[31:20] let me tell you it leads to negligence
[31:23] leads to unappreciativeness
[31:27] i'm thankful must
[31:33] amen and you would be amazed
[31:37] at how that people will take their very
[31:39] life the very
[31:40] very life to take for granted amen
[31:44] people perhaps you know uh you know
[31:47] perhaps know that smoking
[31:48] is bad for your health but they'll do it
[31:51] anyway
[31:52] people understand as long as they're
[31:53] healthy they don't think about it but
[31:54] when it comes upon them then it's a
[31:56] different story
[31:59] and you know people are just not serious
[32:01] about it
[32:02] you becomes lawful you become unthankful
[32:05] now the bible says in romans the second
[32:07] chapter that
[32:07] you know there's a group of people that
[32:09] though they knew god
[32:10] they did not want to retain god in their
[32:12] knowledge but they became
[32:14] unthankful and when you become
[32:18] unthankful you beget let down
[32:21] on unappreciated on being appreciative
[32:24] of god
[32:25] that the whole world has done that
[32:28] amen we come and we're living in that
[32:30] out we're living in an
[32:31] age when everybody is just slothful
[32:36] all right they're lukewarm
[32:39] because why they're rich and increased
[32:42] with goods
[32:44] and we don't appreciate and i hope after
[32:47] tonight's sermon that we will truly
[32:48] appreciate
[32:50] amen everything that god has done for us
[32:54] everything that he does for you every
[32:57] day
[32:58] because i'll tell you now you don't
[32:59] really appreciate your health
[33:01] until it begins to slip away
[33:06] then you're going to see the the best
[33:08] doctor you'll get the best energy to try
[33:10] to fix
[33:11] your problem because you don't want that
[33:13] problem
[33:15] now unfortunately there's problems we
[33:17] can't solve like
[33:18] getting old and getting gray air now you
[33:21] can fix it yeah you can fix it i guess
[33:23] and go get
[33:24] hair dye and diet you know problem
[33:26] solved right
[33:28] but you're still getting old you ain't
[33:29] gonna change that you might change the
[33:31] color of your hair but you ain't gonna
[33:33] change the wrinkles on your face you
[33:36] aren't gonna change the fact that you
[33:37] don't have the strength that you once
[33:39] did
[33:40] amen oh my
[33:44] yes sir the closer the 60 we come the
[33:47] more we realize it amen
[33:49] y'all enjoy your 50 and 51 to 52 and 53.
[33:53] i'll tell you what you better do what
[33:54] yeah i think what was it my
[33:57] father-in-law said one time he said you
[33:58] know whatever you do
[34:00] you better do it before you get to be
[34:02] about 45.
[34:04] huh well i thought i was real pretty
[34:07] good at 45. i'll tell you but
[34:08] i'm gonna tell you whatever you're gonna
[34:10] do you better do it before 55
[34:13] because after 55 you're going to find
[34:16] out because i know from experience that
[34:17] you don't have the energy you don't have
[34:19] the strength that you used to have
[34:22] i've been trying to get on a job at the
[34:24] house all summer long because it's been
[34:26] too hot you know but
[34:27] i've been trying to get down and i'll
[34:28] get on the fir and i'll go do one or two
[34:32] things in here here it is two three
[34:33] o'clock in the afternoon already
[34:35] i can't get nothing done anymore brother
[34:37] joe
[34:39] time flies so fast it is going by
[34:45] the day just fought you know oh my i get
[34:48] something done
[34:49] and do a little bit something on tuesday
[34:51] hey here's wednesday so guess what today
[34:52] we don't work we study we pray
[34:54] you know we got about thursday and
[34:56] friday saturday
[34:58] you know and then when we flies it flies
[35:01] but you better enjoy it because when you
[35:03] get up there in the upper 50s folks you
[35:05] are going to slow down
[35:08] amen but anyway that's just a tip for
[35:11] you
[35:12] baby huh but we're living in an age and
[35:15] i thought about this because
[35:16] i want to talk about the christian
[35:17] christian life the christian life and
[35:19] what it really is
[35:20] and what it really means because brother
[35:22] man says you know we paid 2
[35:24] 20 a picture for being a christian
[35:30] too burning a picture for being a
[35:32] christian
[35:34] and you know i want to just say this
[35:36] right off the top
[35:37] i believe that a christian goes through
[35:39] some really
[35:40] really hard things period
[35:45] all right but yet in all of them going
[35:47] through these hard
[35:49] things he is asked to be sweet
[35:53] and to be kind one to another to be
[35:56] gentle and to be patient
[35:59] and to be long-suffering to be meek
[36:05] in the hardest things that you can ever
[36:08] imagine experience
[36:09] experiencing in life huh
[36:13] and i'll read you what what what the
[36:15] things that jesus
[36:16] said you know we're going to go through
[36:19] and i thought about that why did we
[36:21] paint it so pretty and i thought well
[36:22] i'm going to take some of the scriptures
[36:24] and we're going to go through and find
[36:25] out what a christian
[36:27] you know has to face so let's go with me
[36:31] if you will let's go over to matthew
[36:32] we'll begin in matthew
[36:37] now there's a there's a lot of things
[36:39] i'm going to start with
[36:40] start with this but i'm going to bring
[36:42] out quite a few different things
[36:46] that's heart that's rugged how many
[36:48] bloods brother bam says that a
[36:50] christian life is a rugged life
[36:54] it's a hard life huh
[36:58] it's not an easy life like people think
[37:02] now like i said sometimes we don't even
[37:05] appreciate it we
[37:06] we we forget you know some of these
[37:10] things that a christian
[37:11] that goes with being a christians
[37:12] because of the fact that we live
[37:14] actually living in an age where we're
[37:16] not facing some of the things that
[37:18] the bible talks about them having faced
[37:21] all right
[37:23] for example martyrdom
[37:28] all right example we're not going out
[37:29] here and having our head chopped off and
[37:31] being fed the lions
[37:33] being burned at the stake are we
[37:38] so some of those things that you know
[37:41] it it some of those things it talks
[37:43] about how that he would
[37:44] change his strategy and rather than
[37:46] killing you if you don't bend
[37:48] he would try to become partners with you
[37:50] and get you to join them and so forth
[37:52] and with flatteries he would take many
[37:55] all right
[37:56] so let's go to matthew and look at the
[38:00] one
[38:00] one thing that's kind of hard and rough
[38:02] already
[38:05] in chapter 10 of matthew
[38:08] it says after he says a lot of other
[38:11] that i want to i want to i want to
[38:14] point out but we'll point this out first
[38:17] it says in verse 38 he that taketh not
[38:20] his cross and followeth after me
[38:23] is not worthy of me
[38:26] i'm told that the early christians
[38:28] actually drug a cross around
[38:30] as a symbol of taking up their cross
[38:34] huh he that findeth his life shall lose
[38:39] it
[38:39] and he that loses his life for my sake
[38:42] shall find it now
[38:43] most of the time our concept is that
[38:46] look you've got to die to yourself
[38:48] right that's losing your life
[38:51] two aspects of this you can look at it
[38:54] two ways
[38:55] one is of course we know that you gotta
[38:56] die to yourself
[39:00] back then it could also be applied
[39:03] very literally
[39:07] huh that if you're not willing to lose
[39:10] your life and to actually die isn't that
[39:13] right
[39:14] if you're not willing to be kong on the
[39:17] cross like peter was
[39:19] that right if you're not willing to come
[39:21] this far
[39:22] then you're not worthy of following me
[39:26] that's sometimes let me tell you
[39:27] something you might not think so but you
[39:29] just try
[39:30] sometimes amen that when your flesh
[39:33] wants to have
[39:34] its way you try dying to it and let the
[39:36] holy spirit have it you'll find out
[39:38] there's a battle there
[39:40] not always so easy you don't get to have
[39:42] your way
[39:44] you have to die to yourself that's rough
[39:48] because isn't that right and then if
[39:52] you'll notice up in verse 24 we'll pick
[39:54] up a couple more things he says you know
[39:56] the disciple is not above his master
[39:59] nor the servant above his lord it is
[40:02] enough that the disciple be as his
[40:04] master and the servant as his lord
[40:06] if they call me be out or the master of
[40:09] the house beals him up
[40:11] how much more shall they call them of
[40:13] this household
[40:15] so you know christianity is always kind
[40:19] of
[40:19] nice it ain't bad when everything's
[40:21] going good and everybody's patting you
[40:23] on the back and telling
[40:25] you how great a person you are but what
[40:27] about when somebody begins to call you a
[40:29] devil
[40:35] what about when they rub you the wrong
[40:37] way
[40:38] because i'm guaranteeing you this one
[40:40] thing that people's going to rub you the
[40:42] wrong way
[40:47] all right fear them not therefore for
[40:49] there is nothing covered that shall not
[40:51] be revealed and here that shall not be
[40:53] known in other words
[40:54] you know they may think that they're
[40:55] getting away with something but don't
[40:57] worry about it it'll all be made
[40:58] manifest
[41:01] amen whenever whenever there's somebody
[41:04] wrong about something let me tell you
[41:06] something they would try their utmost to
[41:08] prove to the world that they're right
[41:10] but a christian ain't gonna do that huh
[41:14] you just leave it to the lord don't
[41:16] worry the lord take care of it
[41:18] so he says just watch you know there
[41:21] ain't nothing here
[41:22] you know we're not trying to hide
[41:23] something we're not trying to push our
[41:25] way or trying to force
[41:26] a certain way of seeing things
[41:30] amen because remember jesus was called
[41:32] blg bub
[41:33] and and and jesus called them
[41:37] of their father the devil said their
[41:39] heads of the devil
[41:41] amen so now notice
[41:44] and what i tell you in darkness that
[41:46] speak in you in light and what you hear
[41:47] in the ear that preach upon housetops
[41:49] and fear
[41:51] not them which kill the body
[41:54] hello but they're not able to kill the
[41:57] soul but rather fear him which is able
[41:59] to destroy both body and soul and
[42:01] verse actually it's not here
[42:05] but i'm going to read it one more
[42:06] scripture i'll pick up another one
[42:15] huh
[42:19] i thought it was right here all right
[42:22] so john
[42:28] romans
[42:32] there it is in luke
[42:36] the 6th chapter verse 4 it says the
[42:38] disciple
[42:39] is not above his master but everyone
[42:43] that is perfect shall be as
[42:46] his master
[42:49] [Laughter]
[42:50] how many of us always are praying to be
[42:54] like
[42:54] i want to be like you lord i want to be
[42:56] like you i want to be like you
[43:00] huh the bible says that's what you
[43:02] should be
[43:03] if you want to be perfect then be as
[43:06] close to what jesus was
[43:08] as you possibly can know that that's
[43:11] what i read pretty much there won't you
[43:14] if you want to be perfect then you got
[43:15] to be like your master
[43:18] that's the right desire to have is i
[43:20] want to be like you lord
[43:22] but you just got to be willing to be
[43:25] ready
[43:26] with what comes with that amen
[43:30] all right let's look a little another
[43:32] thing that's hard
[43:33] another thing rugged about a christian
[43:35] that's not easy
[43:36] back in matthew 10 again same chapter
[43:43] and we'll go down to verse 34.
[43:46] he's talking about who shall deny me and
[43:48] so forth but i want to come to this
[43:50] because he talks about
[43:54] think not that i am come to send peace
[43:56] on earth
[43:57] i am come not to send peace but a sower
[44:00] i mean
[44:01] when you become a christian you may have
[44:03] to quit hanging with the crowd that
[44:05] you're hanging with
[44:07] maybe the crowd that you're hanging with
[44:09] you're going to tell them hey i became a
[44:11] christian
[44:12] i guarantee you they'll probably say
[44:14] well we ain't hanging with you no more
[44:17] you ain't our friend no more you most
[44:20] likely don't have to separate from them
[44:22] they'll probably separate from you that
[44:25] comes along with
[44:26] being a christian and starting out as
[44:29] being a christian is
[44:30] you got to be able to this fellowship or
[44:33] get away from
[44:34] everything that ain't like christ
[44:38] he didn't come to send peace i come to
[44:40] set a man
[44:41] at variance against his father daughter
[44:44] against her mother
[44:45] daughter-in-law against her mother oh my
[44:47] gracious you mean becoming a christian
[44:49] means that
[44:50] you might have odds with your family
[44:56] yeah that's what jesus is saying get
[44:58] ready here it comes
[44:59] it ain't a flowery bed of ease because
[45:01] i'll tell you right now
[45:03] ain't nothing as thick as blood
[45:06] huh you know what the good part about it
[45:09] is
[45:09] it's a family can bitterly disagree
[45:12] but they still love each other
[45:16] i mean no just because that you disagree
[45:18] with your family and what they
[45:20] think and the way they believe or
[45:22] whatever it might be don't mean you
[45:24] don't love them
[45:26] i don't care who it is
[45:29] amen but still there's a variance notice
[45:32] he said
[45:32] there is there's a difference there amen
[45:37] that's right even in your family and a
[45:40] man's foe
[45:41] shall be they of his own household be
[45:45] ready for it
[45:46] your foe may be your sister
[45:50] your son your daughter brother sister i
[45:53] don't know
[45:54] it just depends on who's following the
[45:56] lord and who isn't
[45:58] but how many knows right don't persecute
[46:00] bride
[46:02] christian don't persecute christian
[46:05] that's right amen no
[46:08] all right so we find there in that we
[46:11] find that it is
[46:12] that's the beginning of some of that
[46:15] ruggedness that we face
[46:18] some of the hardship that we face amen
[46:22] how many of those like brother bam says
[46:24] that god never
[46:25] promised us a flowery bit of ease
[46:30] no no he sure didn't let's go on to
[46:37] matthew or luke 6.
[46:41] let's look at a few things here and over
[46:42] in luke
[46:44] what jesus said sometimes when i read
[46:48] these scriptures
[46:50] why i almost feel bad of how good i have
[46:54] it
[46:55] huh how many leaves you got it good
[47:00] let me tell you something all of us got
[47:02] good
[47:06] i don't see any policemen coming in here
[47:08] and dragging us out
[47:10] and putting the steak up and burning us
[47:13] huh you got it good
[47:20] soy listen jesus said it this way 6
[47:23] verse 17 and he came down with them and
[47:26] stood
[47:27] well yeah and stood in the plane
[47:30] and the company of his disciples and the
[47:32] great multitude of people out of judea
[47:34] and jerusalem
[47:35] and from the sea coast of tyre inside
[47:37] them which came
[47:39] to hear him and to be healed of their
[47:41] diseases
[47:43] and they that were vexed with unclean
[47:45] spirits and they were healed
[47:47] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[47:49] him for there went out virtue
[47:51] of him and he healed them all and he
[47:54] lifted up
[47:55] his eyes on his disciples and said
[47:57] blessed be
[47:59] poor for yours is the kingdom of god
[48:03] blessed are ye that hunger now
[48:06] for you shall be filled
[48:10] amen amen it reminded me of what brother
[48:13] branham said about our missionaries that
[48:15] are out in the foreign fields don't have
[48:17] but a meal or two a week and they ain't
[48:19] got no shoes on their feet
[48:20] trying to spread the gospel and brother
[48:23] branham got all over us
[48:24] americans and we waste all of this waste
[48:27] that we have
[48:28] brother branham was missionary minded
[48:30] wasn't he he thought about that
[48:32] they were hungry huh
[48:35] blessed are you if you're hungry now
[48:39] because you will be filled
[48:43] jesus pointing to the other world hello
[48:46] blessed are ye that weep now
[48:49] for you shall laugh
[48:53] amen blessed are you when men shall hate
[48:56] you
[48:56] and when they shall separate you from
[48:58] their company and shall reproach you
[49:01] and cast out your name as evil for the
[49:03] son of man's sake
[49:05] rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy
[49:07] for behold
[49:08] your reward is great in heaven for in
[49:11] like manner
[49:12] did they their fathers also unto the
[49:15] prophets
[49:17] huh so if you're spoken evil against
[49:20] you're
[49:20] up the wrong way bad things are said
[49:23] about you how many knows
[49:24] that's where the rub comes people say
[49:28] not
[49:28] good things about you that's easy to
[49:31] serve the lord when everybody's saying
[49:32] good things about you
[49:36] amen
[49:42] i might just say this it comes to my
[49:44] mind
[49:45] but you can never be in the hall of fame
[49:48] until you first go through the hall of
[49:49] critics
[49:52] amen you have to be able to take
[49:54] criticism
[49:57] you have to be criticized how many
[50:00] believe that
[50:00] i believe every christian that stands
[50:03] for the right thing
[50:04] is going to be criticized by somebody
[50:08] you know one thing i see is that our
[50:09] government our government isn't shutting
[50:11] us down
[50:12] right now we're not really being
[50:13] persecuted by the government but there's
[50:15] still
[50:15] people that don't like you if you stand
[50:18] for the right thing
[50:20] nobody believes that if you stand for
[50:21] the truth there'll be people that'll
[50:23] hate your guts
[50:25] that will hate you it might be locals it
[50:28] might be somebody or article
[50:29] it could be anybody but if you really
[50:32] stand for the truth
[50:33] and i'm gonna tell you i think it's
[50:35] boiling up because
[50:36] i'll tell you people uh people you know
[50:39] they hate christians they don't want you
[50:41] to tell them anything about god
[50:43] and if you do they'll hate you this
[50:45] world is full of hate
[50:52] so he says but one to you
[50:55] that are rich huh that are rich
[50:59] brother brown says that the bomb in
[51:02] america
[51:03] is a millionaire he's rich
[51:06] folks i don't know about you but if i
[51:07] was starving i would go to the dairy
[51:09] queen
[51:10] if i was a bum i'd probably go to dairy
[51:11] queen after dark
[51:13] and i'd go look for that hamburger that
[51:16] didn't have a pickle on it that that
[51:17] customer came back in there and threw a
[51:19] iraq fit about
[51:20] said i said pickle like this doesn't
[51:23] have any pickle
[51:25] i remember don she was a almost a
[51:28] manager at a burger king and she found
[51:30] you know you know anything crazy you
[51:31] read it in the news right
[51:33] nowadays where people get hostile and
[51:35] slap
[51:36] hit the workers because they didn't have
[51:38] enough mustard or something
[51:40] what is the world coming to
[51:44] yeah you even read it in news where they
[51:46] got assaulted because they didn't have a
[51:47] certain something or other on their
[51:48] sadly
[51:50] but like mother bram says you know they
[51:51] can go in the garden garbage pile they
[51:53] have lots of food but over there in
[51:55] india and he says you reach out they
[51:56] can't find it anywhere
[51:58] they couldn't get it if nothing and yet
[52:01] you
[52:01] throw out all those burgers and throw
[52:03] out all that food just because
[52:05] something wasn't quite right yeah
[52:08] i'd probably be a dead bum with food
[52:10] poisoning but i'd find food somehow
[52:17] but he said we're rich he said even a
[52:18] bomb would be rich in america
[52:20] even those beggars is that right
[52:24] but how many thankful for what god has
[52:26] given you
[52:28] amen that's right for you have reached
[52:32] your
[52:33] consolation in other words you've got it
[52:35] nice
[52:36] huh how about lazarus was it
[52:40] lazarus the rich young ruler and lazarus
[52:42] you know laying at his gates isn't that
[52:43] right
[52:44] one had it terrible the other one had so
[52:48] much but yet he wouldn't even feed that
[52:50] man
[52:51] he was so steady he wouldn't even feed
[52:53] that man he probably said you know
[52:55] you know you could get you a job i don't
[52:57] know about you but i always make sure
[52:58] that they can get a job and work before
[53:00] i help them out
[53:02] you know but if he really is a bomb help
[53:05] him out
[53:06] huh if he really needs help and that man
[53:09] really need help he had sores everywhere
[53:11] and he wouldn't even help him
[53:14] and guess where they ended up the rich
[53:15] man he had his consolation
[53:17] remember in that lifetime that thou had
[53:20] stole these good things
[53:22] but lazarus he didn't have anything
[53:26] so jesus said whoa unto you that are
[53:29] rich now
[53:31] now we realize that there's a balance in
[53:34] all of that isn't that right nothing
[53:36] wrong with having plenty
[53:38] but if you use it for the kingdom of god
[53:41] well
[53:42] until you are full for you shall hunger
[53:46] one to you that laugh now y'all go ahead
[53:48] and mock
[53:49] go ahead and laugh but you're gonna cry
[53:54] yeah we may have to bow our heads we may
[53:57] have to take
[53:58] all that they peace at us and everything
[54:00] that they say and they spit on us
[54:03] pluck our beard hang us on the cross
[54:05] kill us 68 million down through the dark
[54:07] ages
[54:08] and remember folks that this persecution
[54:12] and this killing of christians
[54:13] went on for 1600 years
[54:17] is that right it wasn't around till
[54:19] 1700s
[54:20] when martin luther came that they
[54:21] actually quit killing christians the
[54:23] romans did
[54:25] that right they began to quit killing
[54:27] them they couldn't do it anymore
[54:29] because there was too many governments
[54:30] rising up that would stop it that would
[54:33] harbor people that wanted to have free
[54:35] for the freedom of religion
[54:36] so for that all of those years folks it
[54:39] was a terrible
[54:40] terrible thing that the children of god
[54:42] suffered
[54:44] folks you couldn't meet like this if you
[54:47] met you had to meet somewhere in private
[54:50] ultimate really private kind of like
[54:52] china right now isn't that right
[54:54] persecute you they'll put you in jail
[54:56] maybe even kill you
[54:58] for having a church service that's kind
[54:59] of what it was like for 1600 years
[55:01] that's why thank god you know for as
[55:04] much freedom as we have yet here
[55:06] because slowly but surely we see it
[55:09] deteriorating and we realize that
[55:10] eventually
[55:11] they'll shut you down they will
[55:13] persecute you eventually
[55:15] amen all right so woe unto you
[55:18] when man when all men shall speak well
[55:21] of you
[55:22] for so did their fathers unto the false
[55:24] prophets
[55:25] so we see that the christian life
[55:27] whenever everybody pats you on the back
[55:29] and nobody ever says anything bad about
[55:31] you
[55:33] jesus says whoa
[55:37] whoa maybe you're so doty and
[55:41] so lukewarm you don't say anything you
[55:44] know
[55:45] about anything no matter what anybody
[55:47] does
[55:48] they like you i like you you know
[55:51] but when you stand up for the truth
[55:53] people don't like you
[55:55] when you do the right thing people don't
[55:57] like you
[56:00] amen
[56:03] so we see that and it goes up for course
[56:06] on
[56:08] to saiyan but i say unto you
[56:12] love your enemies do good to them that
[56:14] hate you
[56:16] how many knows that's a rugged life it's
[56:19] not
[56:19] easy to love your enemies
[56:24] i wrote this down here and i said it's
[56:27] not easy
[56:29] in yourself to love your enemies
[56:33] it's not easy at all but if you've got
[56:37] a holy ghost it becomes easy
[56:40] how many beliefs it becomes easy
[56:44] yes it does because i believe that
[56:47] it has to be something that you do from
[56:48] your heart
[56:54] do good to them that hate you that does
[56:57] kind of goes
[56:58] rough don't it in the flesh that goes
[57:01] really rough
[57:04] to actually look for an opportunity
[57:08] to do something good to somebody that
[57:10] hates you
[57:12] wow that's a rugged christian life isn't
[57:16] it
[57:17] bless them to curse you pray for them
[57:19] that despitefully use you
[57:22] and on the hymn that smiteth you on the
[57:24] right one cheek
[57:25] all for the elsa other also
[57:31] most of us are offering my right hand
[57:34] right
[57:35] with the knuckles kind of pulled out
[57:36] right after one cheek got smit
[57:39] we'd offer him a hand for a fist
[57:43] here you go that would be yourself but
[57:46] that's the self jesus said that you got
[57:47] to die to
[57:49] even one place he says you've got to
[57:51] hate your own life also
[57:54] huh even hate your old life how many
[57:56] would say oh god i
[57:57] i hate the old time i don't want nothing
[57:59] to do with him
[58:02] that's right i want nothing to do with
[58:04] that guy i want nothing but christ's
[58:06] life
[58:07] but it takes a rugged christian
[58:11] rugged to be able to turn to the other
[58:14] one also
[58:16] if somebody shoes you at the log and
[58:17] takes your coat the bible says give him
[58:19] your cloak also
[58:21] can you imagine hey here's you i'm
[58:22] here's my coat here's my cloak would you
[58:25] like that too
[58:27] here you can have that too why
[58:30] because what's coming over there god
[58:32] will have ten cloaks for you over and
[58:34] him
[58:35] you ain't worried about it
[58:42] amen all right shall we go a little
[58:44] further
[58:47] okay and so forth all right so that's
[58:49] right and that's as much as i want to go
[58:51] there because we could go down here the
[58:52] whole way down and what
[58:53] what the christian life is and judge not
[58:56] that she shall not be condemned
[58:57] condemned not that she will not be
[58:59] condemned and so forth
[59:00] forgive and he shall be forgiven yet but
[59:03] i want to go to saint
[59:04] john if you would let's go to saint john
[59:07] i have a few more scriptures here we
[59:09] won't keep you too long tonight but
[59:10] let's just go through this saint john 15
[59:17] and jesus once again gives a description
[59:21] of what a christian life really is
[59:24] what it's going to be like what you can
[59:27] expect
[59:28] to face
[59:43] 15 and verse 18. it says
[59:46] if the world hate you you know that it
[59:49] hated me
[59:50] before i hated you amen
[59:58] if you were of the world the world would
[1:00:00] love his own birds of a feather flock
[1:00:02] together
[1:00:04] hey how many know some certain people
[1:00:06] have you just
[1:00:08] pat them on their back and everything
[1:00:09] else you know
[1:00:11] oh they love you man they like it but
[1:00:13] rub that the wrong way one time a little
[1:00:14] bit
[1:00:16] find out what they're really made of
[1:00:20] because you are not of the world but i
[1:00:22] have chosen you
[1:00:23] out of the world therefore the world
[1:00:26] hateth
[1:00:27] you
[1:00:30] how many knows if this world is full of
[1:00:32] hate
[1:00:34] that's right there's a lot of people out
[1:00:36] there that hate christians
[1:00:39] amen remember the word that i said unto
[1:00:42] you the servant is not greater than his
[1:00:43] lord
[1:00:44] if they have persecuted me they
[1:00:47] will persecute you
[1:00:51] amen they will
[1:00:56] if you stand for what's right you can
[1:00:58] expect
[1:00:59] persecution
[1:01:03] if they have kept my saying they will
[1:01:05] keep your saying also
[1:01:08] amen in other words if they would agree
[1:01:11] with me
[1:01:11] they would agree with you
[1:01:14] but all these things will they do unto
[1:01:16] you for my sake because they have not
[1:01:19] known him that sent me
[1:01:23] if i had not come and spoken unto them
[1:01:26] they had had no sin but now they have no
[1:01:29] cloak for their sin
[1:01:30] he that hateth me hated my father also
[1:01:35] remember this if you truly are a
[1:01:38] christian standing for the right thing
[1:01:40] whoever hates you hates your god also
[1:01:45] he also hates your father
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:55] all right let's go to paul quick shall
[1:01:58] we
[1:01:58] let's go over to paul and see what he
[1:02:01] says about the christian life
[1:02:07] let me um let me do
[1:02:10] let me read you a quote the quote i have
[1:02:13] right here
[1:02:14] before i read that last scripture
[1:02:17] brother branham and mighty conquer
[1:02:19] edmonton alberta i guess it is
[1:02:22] 1957. he tells the story of having gone
[1:02:26] to rome we are told that the church was
[1:02:29] progressing all the time
[1:02:32] under persecution i crossed the river
[1:02:35] and went into rome and i went down to
[1:02:38] the san angelos catacombs
[1:02:40] i'll tell you what if i ever went
[1:02:42] anywhere on a tour or
[1:02:44] somewhere in the world to see that's
[1:02:45] where i would like to go look i'd like
[1:02:47] to walk those catacombs
[1:02:48] i'd like to see those bones
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:55] i'd like to see it because i know that's
[1:02:57] my brothers and sisters
[1:02:59] that gave their life for what they
[1:03:02] believed
[1:03:05] i went down there and while we were
[1:03:07] going through the catacombs and seeing
[1:03:08] the tombs
[1:03:09] where the bodies had been buried of the
[1:03:12] people that had died under persecution
[1:03:14] and at the corners with little short
[1:03:16] graves of course that was the babies
[1:03:19] i went over into the coliseum there i
[1:03:22] stood where
[1:03:23] they used to make the decision on
[1:03:24] whether the man was to die
[1:03:26] or not to die after they made him fight
[1:03:29] to the death
[1:03:30] and when he had decided that the man
[1:03:32] should die the gladiators would hang
[1:03:34] their thumbs
[1:03:35] out over the walls and would push the
[1:03:38] thumbs down
[1:03:38] that means or meant that the man must
[1:03:41] die
[1:03:43] one that fought the other one until
[1:03:44] christians fighting christians until
[1:03:46] one would be down and ask whether his
[1:03:49] life should be spared or not
[1:03:51] they thumbs down they
[1:03:54] and they would kill the christian and as
[1:03:57] i stood there
[1:03:58] my heart was moved and i raised my hands
[1:04:00] up to god and i says oh god be merciful
[1:04:03] the gladiator said thumbs down but i'm
[1:04:05] saying hands up
[1:04:08] raise him up oh god in triumph
[1:04:11] at the last day i mean those they love
[1:04:14] not their lives unto death
[1:04:18] over revelations it talks about thou
[1:04:20] shall have tribulation
[1:04:22] 10 days there was 10 10 years just
[1:04:25] before constantine i believe it was
[1:04:27] where hundreds of thousands that they
[1:04:31] killed and slaughtered
[1:04:32] in that way i mean kill them
[1:04:35] you talk about a bloody genocide
[1:04:40] just because they were christians and
[1:04:42] that right
[1:04:44] all of those people died they didn't
[1:04:47] have a good
[1:04:49] not like we do but let's remember when
[1:04:52] we have little trials when we have
[1:04:53] little
[1:04:54] things come up don't let that shake you
[1:04:57] we've got it very nice compared to what
[1:04:59] they have
[1:05:01] amen i appreciate what god has done for
[1:05:04] us
[1:05:04] now notice triumph on that last last day
[1:05:07] for you promised that you would do it
[1:05:10] that precious faith of the early church
[1:05:13] that was
[1:05:13] pure gold
[1:05:17] pure gold that faith of
[1:05:20] pure gold said the bible that was
[1:05:24] tried in the fire
[1:05:27] and how they would open the pits of the
[1:05:29] great arena
[1:05:30] setting like that only in the bleachers
[1:05:33] as well we
[1:05:34] as we would call it and the great
[1:05:35] massive place down there they would burn
[1:05:37] them up to the stake
[1:05:39] they would open the doors in the traps
[1:05:40] of the hungry lions and tigers
[1:05:43] and they would rush forth
[1:05:46] on a praying bunch of christians
[1:05:50] and just drag them from bone to bone
[1:05:54] and the faith of those people stood firm
[1:05:57] and in the midst of all that the church
[1:06:00] growed
[1:06:01] mightily all the time
[1:06:09] talk about taking things for granted we
[1:06:11] take how nice we have it for granted
[1:06:15] how good we have it we take it for
[1:06:16] granted
[1:06:18] don't realize that this is all just a
[1:06:21] very
[1:06:22] beautiful thing that the lord has
[1:06:23] allowed amen
[1:06:26] but yet remember when somebody
[1:06:28] criticizes you whenever
[1:06:30] you get persecution that's all things
[1:06:32] it's so supposed to be
[1:06:34] but ibm says and after constantine come
[1:06:36] over and liberated them from under the
[1:06:38] roman
[1:06:39] persecution and united to church and
[1:06:41] state together
[1:06:42] there's where we got catholic to begin
[1:06:44] with and when they
[1:06:46] did the church lost more grounds in 10
[1:06:48] years
[1:06:49] than it had gained all through the
[1:06:51] persecution
[1:06:53] brother baby says if there's anything
[1:06:55] that makes christians
[1:06:57] lazy soft jellyfish
[1:07:00] lukewarm unappreciative amen
[1:07:05] is when they are on a flowery bed of
[1:07:08] ease
[1:07:10] but the man makes this notable statement
[1:07:12] we don't have
[1:07:14] persecution enough
[1:07:17] how many knows persecution brings out
[1:07:20] the best in you
[1:07:23] it's good for you trials just like
[1:07:26] trials are good for you
[1:07:29] tests are good for you
[1:07:33] i pray that god has brought many of us
[1:07:36] through trials and tests that we have
[1:07:39] passed
[1:07:39] that we don't need to take many more
[1:07:43] amen that's right
[1:07:46] but abram says we don't have it hard
[1:07:49] enough
[1:07:50] because it's always at this chain is
[1:07:53] strongest
[1:07:54] at its weakest link any man under
[1:07:57] pressure
[1:07:57] is what he is when he's under pressure
[1:08:00] his true characteristics
[1:08:02] will show when he's under persecution or
[1:08:05] pressure
[1:08:08] see if you can get him riled
[1:08:12] get him all riled and stirred up then
[1:08:14] you'll see the real man come out
[1:08:16] if he's got temper it'll show itself if
[1:08:19] he's me congenital
[1:08:20] it'll show itself put him under pressure
[1:08:23] let somebody disagree with you once
[1:08:25] see how you open your mouth let somebody
[1:08:28] do you wrong one time slap you one time
[1:08:31] see how you open not your mouth
[1:08:35] and are like jesus amen if he's meek in
[1:08:38] general it'll show itself put him under
[1:08:40] pressure once
[1:08:41] and god puts all his children
[1:08:45] under those tests how many believes that
[1:08:49] i believe one of the big tests we have
[1:08:52] is lukewarmness
[1:08:53] big test we have is riches
[1:08:57] so much to be had and so much more to
[1:08:59] get until we find out
[1:09:00] maybe if our interest and our sincerity
[1:09:03] and christ
[1:09:04] dwindles and we become more interested
[1:09:07] in the things of the world
