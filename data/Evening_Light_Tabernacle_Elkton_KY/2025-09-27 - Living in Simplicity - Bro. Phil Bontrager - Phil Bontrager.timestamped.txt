[0:00] So we're going to read out of Mark 10
[0:02] and verse 13. We must become simple
[0:06] ourselves. We have to also become
[0:09] simple.
[0:12] Verse 13, 10:13. And they brought young
[0:14] children to him that he should touch
[0:16] them. His disciples rebuked those that
[0:17] brought them. And when Jesus saw it, he
[0:20] was much displeased.
[0:23] He said, "Don't don't stop those young
[0:25] people, those kids from coming to me."
[0:28] and said unto them, Suffer the little
[0:30] children to come unto me, and forbid
[0:31] them not, for such is the kingdom of
[0:34] God. Verily, I send you, whosoever shall
[0:37] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[0:39] little child, he shall not enter
[0:40] therein. He took them up in his arms,
[0:42] put his arms around them, and blessed
[0:43] them. How does a child receive it? You
[0:46] say, "Well, how how would a child
[0:47] receive anything when we're supposed to
[0:49] receive the kingdom of God like a
[0:50] child?" How does a child receive
[0:51] something?
[0:53] Mommy, I'm hungry.
[0:57] Oh, that's too simple. You know why she
[0:59] responds? Well, honey, I know you're
[1:01] three years old, but you got to earn
[1:02] dinner.
[1:04] Have you done good enough to be fed?
[1:08] Have you lived a good life? Are you good
[1:10] enough? Do you think you earn? Have you
[1:12] really earned dinner?
[1:15] Have you impressed me enough to get to
[1:17] feed you?
[1:20] How many How many people look at God
[1:22] that way?
[1:24] How many people see the the rules of the
[1:26] message and say, "Oh, I got to earn his
[1:28] blessing."
[1:31] &gt;&gt; You see how Satan corrupts us from the
[1:33] simplicity?
[1:35] [Music]
[1:37] &gt;&gt; You know what a real three-year-old did?
[1:39] Mommy, I'm hungry. Well, wait for
[1:40] dinner. Oh, mommy, I'm hungry. Now,
[1:45] you cry out until you get what you want.
[1:50] Don't ever quit. I don't have a hissy
[1:53] pit. I'm not talking about that.
[1:56] [Music]
[1:59] Well, why do you believe? You know,
[2:01] another three-year-old comes up and
[2:02] says, and he said, you know, my my daddy
[2:04] said that the the the moon is made of
[2:06] green cheese.
[2:09] Well, my daddy said it's made of yellow
[2:10] cheese.
[2:12] Well, why do you believe that? Daddy
[2:14] said so.
[2:16] It's that simple. Why do you believe the
[2:19] crazy things that people could do? How
[2:20] can you believe the things you believe?
[2:22] Daddy said so.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Let it be that simple. God said, "So,
[2:29] it's enough.
