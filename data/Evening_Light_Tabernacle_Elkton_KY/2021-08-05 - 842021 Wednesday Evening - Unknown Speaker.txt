for our mid-week service and i do want to say i plan on trying to get the rest of that sealer done tomorrow morning so anybody that can help i know everybody's got jobs and probably can't very many help but any man pete he'll help me maybe but anyway huh brian said you could come so anyway that's all right but anyway anybody that can for a couple hours shouldn't take long but anyway we're going to try to get the rest of that done it's just amen that don't have saturday open really so i'm going to try to get it done before then amen that's just our heads lord jesus we come before you father thank you for once again to be able to assemble ourselves together in your precious name lord knowing god wherever two or three are gathered there you will be in our midst lord jesus we're so thankful for that father that you are in our midst lord jesus doing uh your own good pleasure father and that the purpose of god might be fulfilled we ask god that you just bless each and every one that has come out this evening thank you for each one that feels good we ask god thank you for the good health that you've given to each and every one of us lord and we just pray father that you just continue to lead and guide us father and as we serve you lord and get drawn closer to your lord jesus just teach us thy ways lord that we might walk in your footsteps lord jesus bless the service now bless the meditation of our heart bless your word as we open it father and give us the anointing that we need to minister father in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen god bless you tonight um i'm going to title this serving god serving god amen and so it's going to give us perhaps a little bit more clarity on how we serve god what we do to serve god that'd be all right amen what we can do i got wrote down here what we can do for jesus to serve him amen and that's something we all want to know a little bit more about what we can do to serve jesus a little bit more amen and so um amen if you will turn your bibles we'll go to matthew 23 now matthew 25 i'm sorry and i told myself we'll probably have one of brother branham's sermons that he said that the sermon so long is really the best can anybody tell me how long that is 30 40 minutes what something like that amen so i was thinking 20 to 30 but anyway 30 to 40 be all right i guess too so amen praise the lord amen this is something we've heard a lot but it'll be perhaps just a little different angle so to speak but in matthew 25 we'll read this is right after the parable of of a servant and so forth that you were given so many talents and so forth and the one hit it and so forth and then then it says in verse 29 for on that's chapter 25 of matthew and verse 29 for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even at which he had and cast ye that unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth now this is really what i want to get to and when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come me blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepare for you from the foundation of the world for i was unhungered and you gave me meat i was thirsty and he gave me drink i was a stranger and he took me in naked and he clothed me i was sick and he visited me i was in prison and he came unto me and then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when shall we be a hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we the the sick or in prison and came unto thee the king shall answer and say anthony verily i say unto you insomuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me. they shall say also to them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was a hunger and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and he gave me no drink i was a stranger and he took me not in naked and he clothed me not sick and in prison and he visited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we the hungered and thirst and the stranger and naked and sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you in inasmuch as he did it unto the one of the least of these you did it unto me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous unto eternal life i want to read one more in just one page back matthew 23. it was two pages back one all right all right so verse 27 what unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto white as sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful on the outward but inward but our inward we are within full of dead men's bones and are of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity war unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the self occurs of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our father we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye be the children of them which killed the prophets amen may god add his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen so we find that the judgment what we see here is when the sound of man shall come in all of his glory and all the holy angels with him when he sits upon the throne of his glory and he gathers all the nations together he separates the sheep from the goats and isn't that amazing that he makes a statement like what he did amen this is what i want to talk about a little bit tonight with the help of the lord if you'll notice he didn't say well you didn't obey my commandments you didn't dress right you didn't do this you didn't believe he didn't talk about any of that he talked about how that they treated the people of god amen and if you'll notice what he says also he says as you have done unto the least of these you have done it unto me amen in both cases it was as you have done to answer the least of these you have done it unto me amen now we realize and we are taught by the angel of this hour that you know and also we by the scriptures that we find that you know uh we find that jesus even said to the scribes and the pharisees because they said with their mouth that if they'd have been back then if they'd have been back then they wouldn't be killing god's prophets right in other words we'd have been on the right side if we were back there right and so this really brings to light and this is going to come right down to every soul every individual but we find that they would try to say look i would have not been part of it but jesus said yes you would have been is that right another place he says they called themselves but abraham was the father and jesus said if abraham was your father you would believe me right because it's not necessarily if you want to know what you would have done with christ back in the gauge going by you could find out what you would have done back there but what you do with him now and they're right and we know that there would be a lot of people to say boy if i'd have walked ashore here godly i'd have believed him amen i'd accepted him on it on all of this you know but that's that's so much the point nowadays because jesus is still walking the shores of galilee so to speak and people are still doing certain things to him and notice how this was based upon what people do to christ's people and that's just the revelation i had this week about what we do to each other the way that we treat each other amen amen and i was thinking of how that you know the human being the human being is just about the hardest creature to love that god made it is you look back and look at friendships that have broken up look at friends and different ones it's hard to have a friend huh you don't have to aim it if you want to but because there's so many things that can be can come between us men hate each other many people people can't get along can they always fighting all fussing look at the marriages that break up that's a good sign of how well we can get along right not all that great not to mention we know that uh human especially human beings let me say this especially humanity that is ungenerated ungenerated unregenerated we're generated all right but not regenerated unregenerate people what did mother banham said that a man was if you didn't have the holy ghost he's nothing but a brute he's a he's he's a brute beast he's worse than an animal huh you know the animal kingdom and the females you know they don't allow the mill amen certain things unless they're ready and so forth but you know if they try to awesome that'd be a real problem but with man brother man said a real brute they'll throw a baby out of a mama's arms and ravage her that's how broody is terrible and when i was far as a woman unregenerated what did he say that she was he said that she's worse than a dog and if you think i preach hard brother bran preach hard she isn't worth the money that it costs to buy a bullet a clean bullet to shoot her with that's what i get from it that's pretty hard preaching ain't it that's real hard preaching why because she's worse than a dog right worse than the bible says she's watering the man's blood a bad woman is a water in a man's blood it's horrible amen a good woman oh what a treasure it is and that right the greatest treasure that you can have is a woman that's faithful i mean you can't have anything better but a woman that is unfaithful you know and we say we like mother bram so i said we call a dog a right why because she just she just goes all through the neighborhood and and any male that'll have her we'll have her just she's just that way because she's in her time and she's ready for her baby because barbara is natural she's want to have babies and so that's what she does we don't think much of it but she's nothing but a prostitute right and you know but it's the same way he says a woman knows better right when she does that she's worse because she knows better that woman only i mean that dog only does it because it's his nature amen and we find brothers just like i said in the human aspect of things it's the hardest the hardest species love is a human being we are rascals and we're not lethal we get the holy ghost how many knows that how many look at all the families hello we let's just look at this we as a christian family look hard it's hard it is for us to get along as christians thank you thank you very much that's exactly right even as a christian sometimes it's hard to get along and you've got to have a lot of holy ghosts to get along and love one another folks don't even read the news it's a massacre out there all right all this divorce with the man or the woman the man gets some children the woman doesn't or whatever they're just killing each other by the dozens it's a horrible world out there amen and it takes the baptism of the holy ghost takes a regeneration and so one of the hardest things that jesus ever said to us amen and that is he says in john 13 34 he says a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another isn't that something he couldn't give him any kind of command but he said i'm commanding you to love one another he did you think he was gonna be easy he must know that it ain't gonna be easy no as i have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men know that you ark are christian huh but obama says one place the greatest evidence that we're christians is when we love one another when we treat each other right when we love one another because that's a hard thing to do amen and not just as brothers right but also your enemy we as christians are commanded love them that hate you you can't dislike people you can't hate people amen i've been dealing with dogs a lot lately a lot of us do and how many knows i can under completely understand why they would say that a dog is a man's best friend huh because they are true and loyal huh they'll love on you and if you let them love a little bit they'll love on you more and if you ain't careful they'll lick you and kiss you and everything else that's right you got to watch that stuff why they just this is love they man they'll replay they'll come back with love but humans don't always do that do they loyal and everything but the bible says that we're looking one of the greatest evidences is that you love one another the way that people are going to know if you're christian or not is if you have love one for another and on that day think about it on that day god's gonna ask what did you do to my children right what did you do to my children the least of these now brother ben when he explained this scripture he talked about a christian but a christian the reason that they didn't that what they had to ask wait when did i ever see you hungry whenever that when did i ever feed you wouldn't that when did i ever visit you he said that did it just so automatically that they didn't even think about it he says that's the way it's supposed to be a fair christian it's so automatically help and so forth for people that it's just uh it's just natural it's just their nature now let me just place this scripture right okay uh let me place the scripture right because we feel that we fit in this category for one thing we're sheep right we are god's sheep but we're also the bride and this is also the scripture that brother brother branham used he says this is not necessarily the bride right this is not the bride in the judgment because the bride don't come into the judgment he says but this is the people that have done good deeds to the bride that are given life on that day right because of what they did because in this year that's exactly that's the only reason they were given life you did good to my people then therefore i'm giving you life but we still have this the same spirit we carry the spirit of love amen that fits this scripture amen and we have to realize tonight and we've got to realize one thing that the most important species the most important people that there is is god's people because god is in them amen all right serving god how can we serve god amen let's go to mark 9. go to mark 9 38 we know that whether it was jesus or whether it was john the baptist or whether it was paul right the people in that generation that accepted john the baptist that accepted jesus that except that paul those are the people that were saved by almighty god right those are the people that were on the right side those who rejected those people because remember one time the pharisee says how can we work the works of god what was the answer believe on him whom he sent in other words the whole works of god is if god sent somebody the works of god is to believe the one that god sends amen because if you don't do that you don't believe god all right so now in mark 9 and verse um 33 and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that he disputed among yourselves by the way but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed amongst themselves who ought to be the greatest another subject they wanted to talk about they just held their face and he sat down and he called the 12 and said unto him if any man to be sired be the first now let me ask you how many tonight wants to be great in the kingdom of god that's better yeah if you don't want to be great in the kingdom of god what is wrong with you you want to be the worst huh can somebody tell me who the worst is in the kingdom of god tonight this is a really good this is a quiz what's the scripture say who is the least in the kingdom of god for the most part it's a preacher huh it says somebody that says something and then doesn't do it i can get the scriptures he says somebody that says something and then doesn't do it that's the least in the kingdom of god jesus said huh pretty pretty good for us isn't it because we preach a lot so we have to live up to it but listen here listen he says he says if you desire to be the first let me put it in the same full language the same shall be last of all in other words if you want to be first you got to be last and servant of the good people or the richie people or whatever some people no no no no all in other words you're under everybody hey not very many people i know want to be the least that they want to be the bottom they want to be everybody's huh that bum out there huh be his servant you want me to be a bomb servant how about a flea bitten mangy doll god on the street huh be his servant brother branham was remember he picked him up off the road took him home and cleaned him up the mighty great prophet of god cleaning up a mangy fully bitten dog he became servant of all so if you want to be great in the kingdom of god you have to begin to serve people amen i hope tonight that we get a good view that as you serve somebody else you serve god how many believe that as you serve somebody else because god how many knows that's where god lives god lives in people oh boy i was gonna save this for last but can i say it how many of those that sometimes as parents beat the liver out of our kids sometimes we're maybe too rough with them we might offend them we better be just in what we do because remember one time billy ball beat his kid or something brother bam got back he says i'm getting away from you because the angel of the lord didn't away like the way you treated that kid amen i mean believes even your children the way that you treat your children you have to be careful about because there's angels watching them and most of us have gotten we've most of us got raised that boy i'll tell you what you do wrong and you're going to remember it for weeks sometimes we we it took people we took our kids our kids a lot of times they were you know i don't know they were you know maybe not quite as good as a dog come on folks what i'm saying is we don't we you know it was really rough in other words we were too far over the other way it's what i'm saying because you got to have that love and that affectionate care i forget to what does the bible say you know about uh not pushing your kids to wrath and so forth isn't that right because we're responsible for that too but i said that to say this also you know with us relationship comes right down this is where it comes right down to that is in our marriages the way we treat our husband huh the way we treat our wife is the way we treat christ amen brother byler preach it that's the truth amen so because sometimes we let our spouses become so common to us huh we'll come to church and praise god but comes home then we don't treat them right no that ain't right the most direct effect that your christianity gonna be is towards your spouse the way he treats your spouse amen anyway i kind of want to save for down the road but that's the truth it comes down that far because god cares about how we treat one another let me see there let me go on he shall be servant of all now notice two things he says if you want to be first in the kingdom then be last in other words think of yourself as the least right become servant of all and he took a child verse 36 if you follow on me took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive of such children in my name receiveth me amen and whosoever shall receive me me but him that sent me how many of these that's how it works when you the way that you treat a child of god is the way you treat jesus and the way you treat jesus is the way you would have treated the father god himself not that jesus isn't but it reflects you understand so there it is down in verse let's jump down to verse well let me read this because i read i said something about this sunday and i didn't know if i felt just a little pushback but i want to read it and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him hey because he followed not us huh we get to where somebody ain't my religion somebody ain't like me being in watch out they forbad him don't you go preaching gee we got jesus here you ain't a part of us and jesus said forbid him not for there is no man that shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me amen for he that is not against us on our part then he goes back on the subject for whosoever shall give unto give unto you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward what if i say all kinds of evil things against you and this that or the other and wicked things never make it right do you think i'll be accountable you better believe it you speak against the son of man you know even there he said you know he will be forgiven you but you speak against the holy ghost working in his people that'll be a different story you can't say one word against one person or do one thing against any of god's children but that god is watching amen you can't give him a cup of water here here's a cup of water and you won't lose your reward whether it's good or whether it's bad amen and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were cast into the sea [Music] i'm thinking there's another scripture that says it in matthew 18 i know there's one talking about this also verse 6 18 6 he says whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me he were better for him than a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drown into the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of offenses he says for it must needs be that offenses will come but woe to that man by whom the offense comes amen there's your judgment as you do to my children you'd do unto me if you offend one of my little children amen woe to that person how many believes that god has had his people all down through the ages those who were for those people were blessed those who are against god's people woe unto them amen does everybody get a picture that you want to really be careful how you treat god's people what you say about each other what you do to each other how you treat one another amen listen to this christian friends of mine i'm as sincere as i know how to be brother ma'am says because some of those people it's somebody's mother perhaps he understands somebody's mother now and if that was my mother and some man was praying for my mother i'd sure want to be a sincere i'd want him to be sincere because brother brown says and as i do to god's people i am serving god i mean believe that as you serve god's people you serve god let that sink in as we serve one another we serve god as we love one another we love god saint john first john 1 2 verse 9 says he that saith that he is in the light and hated this brother is in darkness even until now amen another place he says he that hateth his brother and says he's in lot is a liar you cannot love god and hate anybody not even your enemy that's right because when the love of god is india it doesn't go to just the church family or the neighbors is that right are those that do good to you but it's got to reach all the way out into those who don't do good to you persecute you and you've got to be able to what do good to them that despitefully do something good paul said put coals of fire on their head by coming back and doing something good blow their mind what i expected you to punch me for that you're going to help me with this amen that's the truth amen so listen that's right as i serve god's people i'm serving god because he says insomuch as you have done it unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me listen and this is just i didn't even know you had said this but this thoughts what prompted me to preach this tonight amen because i when i seen this i was like lord help me i don't know about you but lord help me amen listen here's a lovely thing as you serve one another you're serving god the love of god is in every christian heart to be kind to one another to forgive one another if you don't see the scriptures just like amen just pray for the other person let that person just love one another you'll find there's no greater evidence of a christian in the world than love isn't that the truth by this shall the world know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another amen don't you just don't that just make you feel good we have pledged ourselves anew knowing that in our hearts we have been quickened from the dead don't that make you feel good oh my i love you with undying love listen love one another for you cannot dislike your brother who you have seen and say that you love god well i really don't like that guy but i love jesus come on folks don't work that way right praise the lord how many knows what eternal life really is let's go over it again what eternal life is and this will be a challenge for us at evening like tabernacle everybody out there this will be a challenge for us because we are living in an age and i'm sure we're all guilty of what i'm fixing to read that we are living in an age when everybody is kind of out for their self that's right everybody kind of watches out for themselves we don't know till that the neighbor's dead until we see it in the favor right listen jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others amen brother brandon was talking to his friend doc an old friend of his they were back they were both in their 50s and he was there and he says how are you doing bill and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc i said yourself he says oh i got a lot of patience said i got 15 examinations this afternoon and i said well that's good as long as the examinations isn't finding nothing wrong and we got to talking about back when we were boys and i said well doc i don't know just how long i'm going to be around we're both in our 50s he says that's true bill and i said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now i have kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes and so he said that is true and i said the greatest thrill i have is living for others amen living for others and he said that's what makes life real it's when you not what you can do accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others see that's what you're really that's when you're really living and listen to this i've read this before but i'd like to read it again and if there happens to be someone among us who has never tried to do that let me put it this way for us who have tried it know that it's good let's try it a little more that's me lord i sure i'm so busy with my stuff i don't think enough about others and their needs how many can say that with me i think so much about my stuff i hardly ever think about others needs and if you really want a blessing start doing that listen what he says never try that try to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life and you'll find that it's more blessed than all of the riches that can be thought of when you can try to make life's burdens just a little lighter for somebody else amen you just don't know the joy unless you've tried it once to do something for somebody else how many believes that serving god truly is as you serve one another as you love one another you serve christ and that brings me to thinking of 31 years will be soon in the ministry of the lord and i guess every man thinks of sometimes of sometimes when he has to come to his last service come to that last hour and look back down the path and see what he has accomplished now i guarantee you you get in your 50s and you're going to have some of those thoughts folks i know that when you get older because i'm a little older now i'm almost 60 rather glenn i'm almost enough to be old enough to say i know what it's like to be a little older that's right i've got the authority to do so because i'm there i ain't got the authority to say well when you get 80 i'm not there yet for 70. when you get a little older those thoughts come to you you begin to reflect back and think about what has been accomplished what you've accomplished in your life and i know people i watch people and i won't mention names but i know people that get greatly disturbed and bothered by it right because all of that is going to catch up everything we've done catches up you think about it what you've done your life what you have done in your life amen you sure will to look down the path and see just what's been accomplished see what's going on have you did anything and as i have just said it's what you do other for others that counts i often wonder what it would be when i got to the end of my road which we don't know what time that will be none of us do so i was thinking about that looking back down along the trail where we've come through life we've seen the different hills the fire patches the rocks the hard places the smooth runnings and what i did in those kinds of times it'll all show up one of these days at the hour of my going away and it'll do that on each one of us we are all sure to do that it'll show up on each one when that time comes amen now another police brother branham said a couple things about that we ought to love one another but says no matter what anybody's done if they are wrong don't never build up a complex against that person you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of god's in you you will love the other person one he's wrong amen how many knows that most of the time when somebody's wrong we get upset with him we don't like him we say bad things about him that's the exact wrong thing to do you got to be able to love them when they're wrong amen because you won't be helping them if they're in the wrong and you don't like them pray for them and love one another and brother ben says this in a couple places one of them was humbled by self he remember listen he says surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different things and the miracles and everything the prophet saw you know he says i ought to know a little bit about what gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with god don't never let arrogant proud better than somebody else's spirit ever come around you i added a couple of those things in there let me read it the way he did don't never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody's done even if you're wrong and so forth amen now he says above everything love god and love one another above everything is you gotta love people they're the hardest to love but that's exactly what he asked us to do because why when god shed his blood on calvary sure he redeemed the earth sure he did all of that but his main purpose for was for what for souls or people because they're the most valuable they're the greatest treasure that god has is people and he lives in people and i believe it's the most valuable thing it's what he's going to spend eternity with is people and we need to love one another again he says in christ the mystery of god he says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to do amen and how bad he's remember he said we're one sweet group i mean you'll be you'll go along one day nice every year you'll have oh man you'll just everything will be going so smooth and then all of a sudden something will happen right that's the devil trying to come in and cause you to hate one another and everything else amen god the devil won't let it stay that way but better bam says you just stay loving and sweet and kind to one another amen because that's where it's all at amen praise the lord do you love the lord tonight well i don't know what time i started but i bet you anything that was 30 or 40 minutes sure does go fast don't it amen so if you want to be the greatest in god's kingdom and serve everybody else become the servant of all the humblest of all don't think of yourself as somebody that has to be served but somebody that's there to serve somebody else to my my way of seeing it i say especially about myself and i'm sure you're there too is lord just help me to get in that frame of mind more after tonight than what i was when i came to church are you with me lord help me to get into that frame of mind that it's more important to serve somebody else to do something good to somebody else than it is to myself amen it's just god's life so if you will stand with me musicians if you come i just never really saw it that way i guess until this week when i got to thinking of how god said that really and the prophet even said he said as we're serving one another as we love one another we're loving and we're serving god it's the way that we do because that's where god dwells is in us amen sure it's obeying the commandments sure it's so you know if a man loves me he keeps my sure that's all part of it but i believe this is a great aspect that we definitely need to say god help me with let's bow our heads how many is guilty of not doing this of not really thinking about others the way that you should maybe your husband your wife your neighbor or whoever it might be i'm guilty i'm guilty of just living for myself too much and i need to stop start beginning to say god help me not to just live for myself but eternal life holy ghost life is living for others caring about others sharing the gospel whatever it might be just to be a help just somehow do something for god's people do something for god doing something for the neighbor just it's not doesn't gain us our entry to heaven we're saved by grace but it's what we want to do it's the way that god has told us to do and that's what we want to live like we want to live by the holy ghost and serve god by serving one another and loving one another and being kind lord jesus we ask god tonight that you which is blessed each and every hand that is up mine is up saying lord jesus help me father for i get so consumed i get so busy with my stuff i don't i i like help me to make more time for other people for people that i know have a need lord jesus to be right there to help in that need lord in any way that i can to love people father help me to express that love in our hearts every each and every one of us for we want the people in the world we want everybody to be able to say boy that person really has a lot of love in their heart that person is a christian that god that person has to know god because of all the love that i see coming out of their heart lord that's what we want to be just a reflection of you help us lord and after tonight god help us lord not to just come to church on wednesday and let this be another sermon but father let it be the word that goes down into our hearts and our souls and it becomes a part of our lives and lord we exercise and we'll practice it lord jesus in jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you i want to live the way i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love till there's just the lord once again if we could tonight oh i'm going to live
