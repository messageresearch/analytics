[22:10] i
[22:15] before it was on

[25:24] cross
[25:25] all the pain and suffering

[25:29] almost unfathomable that
[25:32] he could come down he could take all the
[25:33] blame all the punishment and all we get
[25:35] is the reward and all we all he asked us
[25:37] is that we lay our life down for him

[28:30] word

[28:37] three are gathered there you would be in
[28:39] our midst lord we just thank you father

[28:59] that you would just help me to speak the
[29:01] things that you once said lord come down
[29:03] in a special way with your presence lord
[29:05] anoint lord jesus may we all go from
[29:07] here closer to you than what we was when
[29:10] we came
[29:11] we ask these blessings and favors in the
[29:13] name of jesus christ
[29:14] amen and amen
[29:17] let's turn our bibles to the book of
[29:18] joshua if you will once again out of the
[29:20] book of joshua
[29:22] amen it seems like we have been in
[29:24] joshua quite a bit but
[29:26] amen this is uh
[29:29] i mean just going to be a little bit
[29:31] different direction perhaps but
[29:34] it's certainly something i have enjoyed
[29:36] just meditating on i mean
[29:38] you know what as a preacher i'll tell
[29:40] you what we can get pretty happy just
[29:42] meditating on the lord
[29:44] you know meditation is a good thing
[29:47] how many knows that
[29:49] i think david said meditate on a day and
[29:52] night right and on his law does he
[29:54] meditate day and night and the things
[29:56] that you meditate is what creates the
[29:58] atmosphere around you
[29:59] amen it's just
[30:02] it's a wonderful thing
[30:03] so in joshua the first chapter
[30:15] and i want to read
[30:18] one verse there and then i think we'll
[30:20] go to hebrews 5
[30:23] 13
[30:24] 5 and 6.
[30:26] all right i want to read joshua 1 and
[30:29] verse 5.
[30:30] there shall not any man be able to stand
[30:33] before thee all the days of thy life as
[30:34] i was with moses
[30:36] so will i be with thee i will not fail
[30:38] thee
[30:39] nor forsake thee amen
[30:43] i'm thinking that
[30:45] another one over just a few pages back
[30:47] deuteronomy 31 and 7.
[30:52] this was moses i believe
[30:55] if i'm not wrong
[30:57] one of his last
[31:00] speeches and so forth and speaking to
[31:02] aaron
[31:05] in verse 6 31 6 says be strong enough
[31:08] good courage
[31:10] fear not neither be afraid of them for
[31:12] the lord thy god
[31:13] he it is that
[31:15] doth go
[31:17] with thee and he will not fail thee nor
[31:20] forsake thee
[31:21] and then in i believe it's
[31:24] hebrews
[31:28] new testament bringing it over into the
[31:30] new testament
[31:39] hebrews
[31:40] 13.
[31:47] five and six
[31:49] thirteen five and six let your
[31:51] conversation be without covetousness
[31:54] and be content with such things as you
[31:56] have
[31:57] for he hath said i will never leave thee
[31:59] nor forsake thee so that we may boldly
[32:03] say the lord is my helper i will not
[32:06] fear what man shall do unto me be god at
[32:09] his blessings to reading the words you
[32:10] can be seated
[32:12] tonight i want to title this
[32:14] supernatural
[32:16] intervention
[32:18] supernatural
[32:19] intervention
[32:21] or divine
[32:23] intervention
[32:25] amen
[32:28] amen
[32:30] you know it's quite something how that
[32:33] um
[32:35] we as human beings we will spend
[32:38] millions and billions of dollars
[32:42] to try to go out into space we will
[32:44] build these great big satellite dishes
[32:49] in that right
[32:50] and send signals out there and we are
[32:52] very curious
[32:54] of whether we're alone in the universe
[32:57] or not
[32:59] isn't that right
[33:00] and we'll spend billions of dollars lots
[33:03] of money amen and and even look for
[33:05] other worlds
[33:07] to see whether they're inhabitable or
[33:09] not
[33:11] i don't know about you but i
[33:14] think of what we got is pretty good
[33:17] amen i know it's a little overpopulated
[33:20] maybe but as far as nature and as far as
[33:22] what god's made is simply awesome isn't
[33:25] it how many knows there's places uh you
[33:27] know some of those rural areas out there
[33:29] i don't care if it's alaska i don't care
[33:30] if it's uh you know every different
[33:32] place has its beauty it's all made by
[33:35] god and yet
[33:36] man wants to try to you know still he's
[33:39] not satisfied am i right
[33:42] um what was it that the prophet of god
[33:44] said he says they're going to spend all
[33:45] this money trying to get a man to the
[33:48] moon and then when they do they're not
[33:50] going to find out anyway
[33:52] then all they gotta do is come back home
[33:54] you know that's about as much as
[33:56] consists of right
[33:58] but you know i i just love this thought
[34:01] because you know you know
[34:03] uh
[34:04] i'm thankful that we're not alone
[34:07] aren't you glad you're not alone
[34:09] i believe it was david that said you
[34:11] know i will not
[34:13] though i walk through the valley of the
[34:14] shadow of death i will fear no evil
[34:18] for
[34:19] thou art with me amen that means that he
[34:21] is not alone
[34:24] i'm so glad that we are not alone in the
[34:27] universe
[34:29] but you know you don't have to look out
[34:31] there for some companionship or some
[34:33] aliens or some new life you know they
[34:36] should focus a whole lot more wouldn't
[34:38] it be much better if they would really
[34:41] take a good look at who really is here
[34:44] with us
[34:46] huh let's be so much better off if they
[34:49] check out who is with us right here
[34:54] amen
[34:55] and you know they'll dig in dirt they'll
[34:58] dig up fossils to figure out how long
[35:01] that we've been here and how that it was
[35:03] made
[35:05] huh isn't that right why don't they just
[35:07] believe what god said and it'd all be
[35:09] taken care of
[35:13] and you know the bad part is that they
[35:15] you know they even as the prophet god
[35:16] said the more they dig they more they
[35:19] prove
[35:20] creation
[35:21] you know every time they try to disprove
[35:23] god they just prove him that much the
[35:25] more
[35:27] and you know to have these inner i guess
[35:29] these space stations and so forth like i
[35:31] said and they try to find to hear a
[35:33] voice out there somewhere
[35:36] how much better they would be off if
[35:38] they try to hear the voice that's trying
[35:40] to talk to them all the time
[35:44] believe that god's trying to talk to the
[35:46] world he's trying to communicate to the
[35:48] world but they just aren't listening
[35:51] they want to go about it some other way
[35:54] i believe it's like god said that man is
[35:57] always going way over the top of things
[36:00] looking for something when it's right
[36:02] down there under him
[36:04] they need to look down here closer
[36:07] amen
[36:09] praise be to god
[36:11] you know it's something about you know
[36:14] if we didn't have
[36:15] the supernatural if we didn't have
[36:18] help from somewhere
[36:20] right if we didn't have help or
[36:22] intervention from the supernatural we
[36:24] would be in bad shape
[36:30] everybody wants to talk about how bad
[36:32] putin is how bad putin is
[36:34] let me tell you something without
[36:36] regeneration you're all bad
[36:39] everybody's as bad as putin if you ain't
[36:41] born again
[36:45] huh
[36:47] the only thing that'll help us the only
[36:49] thing that'll help is if god truly
[36:52] intervenes and he has intervened
[36:54] intervened
[36:55] hasn't he
[36:57] god has energy he got always in the
[36:59] supernatural
[37:00] oh my let me just go way ahead of myself
[37:03] here and you know even down to your
[37:06] daily food and clothes god intervenes
[37:08] for you
[37:12] amen
[37:13] every little detail god is there
[37:20] oh my if we could just know that it's
[37:22] there and believe that it's there that
[37:25] even around here if we could just look
[37:27] in that dimension
[37:29] huh
[37:30] how many knows if you could just tap
[37:32] right now into another another into
[37:35] another dimension into let's say the
[37:38] radio and television dimension if we
[37:40] would uh tap into every voice that's
[37:43] going through here
[37:45] you couldn't hear me for all the noise
[37:50] can you imagine all those voices and all
[37:52] those things bombarding this place all
[37:55] you'd have to do is get a radio and turn
[37:57] it up
[37:58] and the television turn it up

[40:28] of billions of miles no it's god's going
[40:30] to redo this very earth right here and
[40:33] this is where we're going to live
[40:36] i'm not really interested in going past

[41:02] praise the lord over into another
[41:04] dimension
[41:06] praise be oh my if the world if the
[41:08] world would just realize
[41:11] that there has never been in the history
[41:13] of the church
[41:16] a
[41:18] universal world over intervention by god
[41:23] shown like it was in your age and in my
[41:26] age
[41:28] never so many miracles never so many
[41:30] infallible proofs that god is real god
[41:33] is alive
[41:35] huh
[41:37] how many knows
[41:38] he came and intervened
[41:40] when we were in the biggest mess you
[41:42] ever saw 900 different churches down 900
[41:45] different beliefs jesus comes
[41:48] right down in the middle it says y'all
[41:50] all wrong
[41:52] there's only one right way that's the
[41:53] bible
[41:54] quit putting your own interpretation and
[41:56] your own ideas to it come back to what
[41:58] paul said come back to the bible
[42:01] amen
[42:03] oh my
[42:06] my
[42:07] the fbi some preachers wanted to break
[42:09] up the meeting and say the xbi fbi is
[42:12] going to expose the prophets being false
[42:14] and so forth this that or the other and
[42:16] and they put all these flyers out when
[42:17] they come time
[42:18] everybody says you watch him now as a
[42:20] warrior he says you know it wasn't the
[42:22] fbi they don't care about those things
[42:24] the fbi that really did come investigate
[42:26] got saved
[42:28] [Laughter]
[42:30] oh the fbi god said they were better off
[42:32] than these backslidden preachers
[42:36] huh
[42:39] that's right they were better off than
[42:40] the backslidden preachers
[42:42] then he pointed it out no it was these
[42:45] preachers sitting up there in the white
[42:46] suit and that one over there don't
[42:49] down don't
[42:50] bend your head down and try to hide
[42:51] behind the other right there you you're
[42:53] the one that did it
[42:55] now if i'm simon the source there's come
[42:57] on down here
[42:59] come on down here stand by my sides
[43:01] because god said i'll be all right by
[43:03] you by your side and no man will ever
[43:06] stand in front of you
[43:08] they might die in front of you but they
[43:10] won't stand in front of you huh
[43:13] and we'll see who is right
[43:15] they cowered and ran out of the building
[43:18] i wonder where they are today
[43:20] i would dare say dead
[43:23] you know not sure because of their
[43:24] blasphemy or whatever but simply because
[43:27] of age also
[43:29] because it was so long ago amen
[43:33] oh my praise the lord you love him
[43:36] when i look at this and i look at the
[43:38] world over
[43:39] i look at our generation
[43:42] i mean those that there was time that
[43:44] jesus talked about this generation
[43:47] when he said a wicked and adulterous
[43:49] generation seeketh after a sign
[43:53] and it won't be given the sign but the
[43:55] sign of the prophet of jonah
[43:58] but he was in the wells belly for three
[44:00] days and so forth come forth talking
[44:02] about the resurrection they'll be
[44:03] actually given the sign of the
[44:05] resurrection that brings that evil
[44:07] generation will be that was our
[44:10] generation given the sign of the
[44:12] resurrection
[44:16] but it was a wicked and adulterous
[44:17] generation i wrote down here you know
[44:19] the world has missed its opportunity
[44:28] folks
[44:29] i don't know about you i don't want to
[44:30] miss no opportunity
[44:33] it is depressing when you miss an
[44:35] opportunity
[44:37] in other words something that you could
[44:38] have had something that would have been
[44:40] but it isn't neither will it ever be
[44:42] because you made the wrong choice
[44:45] this world had the opportunity to see
[44:47] god they had opportunity
[44:49] to know who where it really all come
[44:51] from and what it was really all about
[44:55] when blind eyes were opened
[44:58] the deaf could hear
[45:00] huh
[45:03] no wonder no wonder the prophet said
[45:05] this message will have rapturing faith
[45:08] it's got rapturing faith in it
[45:10] there's rapturing faith in this message
[45:16] how many knows that if we ever have a
[45:18] body change if i ever change from this
[45:21] old tinkling and aging body it will take
[45:24] divine intervention
[45:26] [Music]
[45:27] it will take supernatural power
[45:35] amen
[45:37] not just natural power
[45:41] but russia is doing is natural power
[45:43] what hitler did was natural power what
[45:46] catholicism does is natural power kill
[45:49] you if you don't bow 68 million all they
[45:52] had was natural power
[45:54] but it took a supernatural power to walk
[45:57] out into those lions ends in the bed to
[45:59] die for the sake of the lord
[46:02] huh a supernatural power
[46:05] if you just have natural power this
[46:07] morning or this evening
[46:13] then all you have is religion that you
[46:15] have in your brains
[46:19] just in your mind
[46:21] that's just natural power
[46:25] a carnal
[46:27] understanding
[46:29] huh
[46:30] and that's what the majority of the
[46:32] world has but a supernatural
[46:34] understanding a supernatural power is
[46:37] something that is beyond natural now you
[46:40] and i we were made
[46:42] supernatural
[46:46] okay
[46:48] how does how do you do that well
[46:51] our body our flesh is
[46:53] natural
[46:56] right
[47:00] it doesn't do a lot for you
[47:04] but that second one
[47:06] we're made out of body and then we're
[47:08] made out of
[47:11] go ahead
[47:12] spirit
[47:15] we have flesh
[47:16] then we have spirit now how many knows
[47:18] that spirit that's not natural
[47:22] it's in the ghost world
[47:25] huh
[47:26] it's in the spirit world
[47:28] it's in a different dimension and it can
[47:30] be good or it can be bad
[47:35] huh
[47:37] that spirit realm that supernatural
[47:40] realm something beyond the natural
[47:42] is what you or i are governed by tonight
[47:47] it's what controls this flesh
[47:50] that wakes up in the morning and it
[47:52] can't hardly function without its coffee
[47:55] huh
[47:57] and if you feel me bad and depressed you
[47:59] get away from god and back sleep you are
[48:01] so miserable
[48:05] hey unregenerate people are miserable
[48:11] if you don't believe me go to walmart
[48:14] and to chair out for a little while
[48:17] and look at all the miserable people
[48:23] huh
[48:24] the whole world
[48:26] miserable well
[48:28] how do you justify that brother byler
[48:34] the laodiceans says they were wretched
[48:37] miserable
[48:38] poor
[48:40] blind
[48:41] and naked
[48:43] they're miserable
[48:46] they're poor
[48:48] they're blind
[48:51] that's right they're walking around
[48:53] blind
[48:54] they don't know where they're gonna end
[48:56] up at they don't know where they're
[48:57] going
[48:58] they don't know where they come from
[48:59] they don't know if they come from the
[49:00] chimpanzee or
[49:02] they don't know where to come they don't
[49:04] they're blind
[49:06] why all because
[49:08] they missed god's they missed god's
[49:11] intervention
[49:16] amen
[49:19] let me take i want to not lose this
[49:22] anointing but let me just
[49:24] go back for a minute how many remembers
[49:27] over in revelations it talks about a
[49:29] four winds hold the far winds and don't
[49:32] let them hurt the trees and all these
[49:34] other things until we have sealed our
[49:36] servants in our foreheads
[49:38] brother bam says they was riding on the
[49:40] decline of the first world war nobody
[49:43] knows today whoever made the issue of
[49:45] peace kasir wilhelm said he didn't do it
[49:48] no general said that he didn't do it but
[49:50] notice how strange it was it was on
[49:52] november the 11th at 11 o'clock in the
[49:54] day the 11th day of the month 11
[49:57] 11 month of the year eleventh hour of
[49:59] the day and eleven minutes to meet till
[50:02] till eleven what was it hold stop
[50:05] mysteriously what this it was god's
[50:08] issue
[50:09] went forth to hold
[50:12] huh
[50:15] hold the four winds
[50:17] hold these stripes and so forth
[50:20] hold it until we have sealed our
[50:22] servants in their foreheads in other
[50:24] words he says don't completely
[50:26] annihilate the world until
[50:28] israel gets sealed
[50:31] now he believes that's going to happen i
[50:33] believe it'll be after
[50:34] those jews get their ceiling
[50:37] that you'll
[50:38] see
[50:40] a complete annihilation
[50:43] i say annihilation you know what i mean
[50:44] that
[50:45] i completely burnt over
[50:48] amen
[50:49] but what was it it was god
[50:52] intervening i mean these and wars and
[50:55] all these different things that happen
[50:57] god intervenes
[51:00] i could i didn't have time or go over
[51:02] the old testament and you've already
[51:03] probably heard me say it before and read
[51:05] it before where god says the nations are
[51:07] just as a drop but as a bucket he says
[51:08] he god sets up who he wants and he take
[51:10] down who he was
[51:13] he was uh i'm not sure if a caesar
[51:15] remember that one one of the hebrew
[51:17] caesar or one of them that went out
[51:19] there
[51:20] and made himself to be a god and he died
[51:22] right there in the writing where he was
[51:24] sitting the skin words began to eat him
[51:26] up killed him right there on the spot
[51:28] because he made himself look like a god
[51:32] god can do anything he wants
[51:34] how many is glad that that god is
[51:37] absolutely
[51:39] in our lives
[51:41] and not just in our lives but he also
[51:43] deals with the people out there and the
[51:45] governments and everything else same way
[51:47] with russia and ukraine right now huh
[51:51] there was another there was different
[51:52] things i talked about i think brother
[51:54] pete a little bit but you know uh i've
[51:56] done a lot of study of world war ii and
[51:59] and germany and and all of those fights
[52:01] and all the different fights that they
[52:03] had and even the prophet of god brother
[52:05] brad mentioned it and so forth about the
[52:06] sacred line and different things that
[52:08] the prophet prophesied of and and so
[52:10] forth and uh you know things that was
[52:12] going to happen and and when we came to
[52:14] the end of fighting the germans and
[52:16] defeat them and so forth and one of our
[52:18] generals said you know let's go on into
[52:20] russia now we got these nukes we can
[52:22] take over the world
[52:25] huh
[52:26] and we had men that was trained our army
[52:28] was man they were in such a rhythm of
[52:31] overtaking things and over they were on
[52:32] a roll
[52:35] they was in the zone
[52:37] and they might just let's go ahead and
[52:38] take russia
[52:39] huh i thought about that many times why
[52:41] didn't they we wouldn't have all these
[52:43] problems
[52:44] every country that says no country
[52:46] against nukes except us
[52:48] every country we could have been a whole
[52:50] world over but guess what there was an
[52:52] interceding intervening right there
[52:56] even before that if you'll notice
[52:57] germany going into russia amen and they
[53:00] fought the russians all the way till
[53:02] they could see their capital
[53:05] but
[53:06] hitler wasn't too smart and the bible
[53:08] went on and on and on until winter it
[53:10] got so cold that most of their froze
[53:12] didn't have any winter clothes and then
[53:14] half of them are a lot of them froze to
[53:16] death
[53:16] frostbite and they just couldn't do it
[53:19] how many knows they could have never
[53:20] take the kremlin
[53:22] why because what the scripture says
[53:24] about what they're going to do
[53:26] so no matter what somebody tries to do
[53:28] if god don't allow it it ain't going to
[53:30] happen
[53:32] because there ain't no doubt how many
[53:33] there ain't no doubt but the english
[53:35] here with america no doubt they have
[53:37] dead as outnumbered outgunned
[53:40] militarized by a long shot but we still
[53:42] won
[53:44] why because it was meant to be
[53:46] god intervened and he gave us some
[53:48] victories
[53:49] and here because it had to fulfill the
[53:52] scriptures
[53:54] now hang on to your seats how many knows
[53:57] if he's behind the good work in you
[53:59] and that god is going to finish it no
[54:02] matter how many devils come your way and
[54:04] what happens god's going to see you
[54:06] through
[54:08] doesn't matter how odd how overwhelming
[54:10] the eyes are
[54:12] you're gonna make it
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:16] how many knows david the little bitty
[54:18] shrimp fella just a little natural
[54:20] looking man and a great big god that
[54:22] have nothing to do with it
[54:24] the supernatural intervene it wasn't
[54:26] david's arm or his sling or his soul it
[54:29] was the god that was all in it
[54:32] it ain't you and you're natural it is
[54:34] what god is in your heart in life that's
[54:36] what makes the difference let me tell
[54:38] you something joy is supernatural peace
[54:40] is supernatural you've got to have
[54:42] intervention from almighty god if you
[54:44] get it in your heart
[54:48] or you won't have it
[54:50] you can ask god to forgive you you can
[54:51] repent you can do all things but if god
[54:53] don't come down and forgive you and feel
[54:55] you you ain't gonna get it
[54:57] there has to be divine intervention
[55:03] something supernatural has to take place
[55:08] amen
[55:11] praise be to god
[55:13] people can't see god right
[55:16] man i look everywhere and i see
[55:18] god aren't you can't you see god
[55:21] everywhere
[55:22] sure you can
[55:24] you can watch him in wars you can watch
[55:26] him nature you can do and especially in
[55:28] your own life you can see
[55:32] you can look at his creation as you
[55:33] security yard you see god everywhere
[55:38] you can just look it up at the sun you
[55:40] can look up at the moon
[55:42] and see god
[55:44] because when that sun's just moving a
[55:46] little bit that moon just a little bit
[55:48] huh you think about it you think you
[55:50] know that it makes a perfect rotation
[55:53] exactly the way it is it's supposed to
[55:55] and it's never lost a minute as i know
[55:57] us it don't lose time
[55:59] it's directly on and that's gone
[56:03] praise god you love me
[56:07] it came to my mind in the church age
[56:09] book
[56:10] brother brandon put it this way
[56:12] he says you know
[56:14] these things saith the faithful and true
[56:16] witness now i want to show you
[56:18] what i find in the thought of faithful
[56:21] you know when we often talk about an
[56:23] unchangeable god whose word does not
[56:25] change and when we speak of him after
[56:27] the manner we often get a view of him
[56:30] that makes him seem very impersonal
[56:33] it is as though god made the whole
[56:36] whole universe and all the laws that
[56:37] pertain to it and then he stood back and
[56:39] became a great impersonal god
[56:46] it is as though god made a way of
[56:48] salvation for lost mankind
[56:51] that way being the cross then
[56:53] and then when the death of christ has
[56:55] atoned for our sin and his resurrection
[56:57] gave us an open door to him god just
[57:00] folded his arms and stood back
[57:02] [Music]
[57:03] amen how many said that we're not
[57:06] serving to god that he's folding his
[57:08] arms and he's standing back
[57:11] no he's very
[57:13] personal
[57:15] in your life and in my life every
[57:19] day
[57:21] every word that's you comes out of your
[57:24] mouth huh
[57:27] and more importantly you might never
[57:30] do things you know
[57:32] right outright but let me ask you this
[57:34] you don't have to do bad
[57:36] outright
[57:39] all you got to do is think it
[57:42] because the bible says as a man thinketh
[57:45] in his heart
[57:46] so is he
[57:49] you ain't getting away with nothing
[57:52] it doesn't even need to be not thinking
[57:56] because that's what i thought if i
[57:57] thought these what is this crazy thought
[57:59] go in my mind get out of my mind that's
[58:00] why i'm wicked get out of here
[58:02] huh
[58:03] i would never do something like that
[58:06] but that thought just tries to come back
[58:08] and get you to entertain it a little bit
[58:11] and i thought well you might never do it
[58:12] but look what the scripture says
[58:13] scripture says
[58:15] if you just think it in your heart
[58:18] so easy
[58:20] amen
[58:22] also that's not me that's not with the
[58:24] devil
[58:25] amen i'm sure we have thoughts isn't
[58:27] that right
[58:28] oh my think back moves and and as if we
[58:33] had listen
[58:34] it is as if we majored in believing in a
[58:38] great creator who having created lost
[58:42] personal interest in his creation now i
[58:45] say that
[58:46] is how too many people are apt to think
[58:49] isn't that the truth
[58:51] way too many people in the world
[58:54] think that god is just sitting back and
[58:56] he's not doing anything
[59:00] huh
[59:01] that he's not a personal god anymore
[59:04] then the bible says he says you know
[59:06] where is the promise of his coming
[59:08] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[59:11] things continue as they were
[59:14] they think god is not oh my they just
[59:17] don't know god do they
[59:19] they're just not his child until they
[59:21] can't see him nowhere they can't feel
[59:22] him nowhere because you cannot even see
[59:25] the kingdom of god jesus said unless
[59:28] you're born again
[59:31] ma
[59:34] you know how much god intervenes god
[59:36] intervenes so much that you can't even
[59:39] come to jesus unless god intervenes
[59:43] no man can come to me except
[59:47] my father does and some intervening
[59:51] your father has if you have that in your
[59:53] heart
[59:54] if you got a desire in your heart
[1:00:00] if that passion is in your heart yet oh
[1:00:03] my
[1:00:04] that ought to make you the happiest
[1:00:05] person in the world because a lot of
[1:00:07] people ain't got a feeling for it
[1:00:09] whatsoever
[1:00:11] there's no feeling there whatsoever and
[1:00:13] if you've got that feeling in your heart
[1:00:14] for god that is placed by the divine
[1:00:18] intervention of god
[1:00:24] people
[1:00:24] just don't
[1:00:26] care
[1:00:33] i don't care it's what kind of ins a
[1:00:35] statement
[1:00:38] insane that's right about a joke
[1:00:41] the man says it's an insane statement
[1:00:45] because it's insanity for you not to
[1:00:48] care
[1:00:53] you are way
[1:00:54] out there if you don't care about your
[1:00:56] soul
[1:00:57] about yourself
[1:00:59] amen
[1:01:01] oh my
[1:01:04] that's wrong thinking
[1:01:05] for god is governing in the affairs of
[1:01:09] men
[1:01:10] right now
[1:01:12] he is both creator and sustainer
[1:01:17] amen how many knows he's the one that
[1:01:19] creates it he's the one sustains it he's
[1:01:22] the one that keeps it going
[1:01:24] amen
[1:01:25] for by him are all things created
[1:01:28] colossians 1 16-17
[1:01:31] that are in heaven that are in earth
[1:01:32] visible and invisible whether there be
[1:01:34] thrones and dominions and principalities
[1:01:37] powers
[1:01:38] all things we gave were created by him
[1:01:41] and for him
[1:01:42] he is before all things and by him all
[1:01:45] things
[1:01:46] consists
[1:01:48] amen in other words he keeps running
[1:01:51] smoothly
[1:01:52] i like that
[1:01:54] aren't you glad for the scripture says
[1:01:55] that all things work together for good
[1:01:59] to them that love god
[1:02:02] to them that are called according to his
[1:02:05] purpose
[1:02:07] everything works together for good god
[1:02:10] makes things work together for good
[1:02:14] in other words he is right there in your
[1:02:16] life and in my life
[1:02:18] making things work right
[1:02:21] many times we don't see it
[1:02:24] many times we're so well off and so busy
[1:02:27] with our things that it takes a hardship
[1:02:30] it takes something drastic it takes
[1:02:32] something an impasse
[1:02:35] to come our way
[1:02:38] trouble to come our way
[1:02:41] for god to really show himself
[1:02:43] huh
[1:02:46] israel was so carnal they were so
[1:02:48] natural amen so carnal they were so
[1:02:51] carnal that they did not believe in the
[1:02:54] supernatural let me just say this is a
[1:02:56] minister of the gospel according to the
[1:02:58] word of god they were denied to enter
[1:03:00] the rest because of their unbelief jesus
[1:03:02] said they're everyone dead
[1:03:05] why because they could never get in
[1:03:07] their minds that there is a supernatural
[1:03:10] god intervening on their behalf
[1:03:13] quit worrying about your food worrying
[1:03:15] about your clothes start worrying about
[1:03:17] pleasing god
[1:03:25] can i tell you something else i thought
[1:03:26] about brother glenn
[1:03:29] some brother brad talking about it and
[1:03:31] you know our goals and the bible says
[1:03:33] the scripture says set your things
[1:03:35] things on things above not on things
[1:03:38] below
[1:03:39] i look at myself and look at what
[1:03:41] everybody wants to do everybody wants to
[1:03:43] get rich everybody wants more money
[1:03:45] everybody wants worldly stuff and more
[1:03:47] worldly stuff and it's all worldly stuff
[1:03:53] i think i am i think we all can say
[1:03:55] we're still too attached to the things
[1:03:57] of this world
[1:04:01] because it's all going to go by the ways
[1:04:02] it all ain't going to matter after a
[1:04:04] while anyway
[1:04:06] it's all going to blow up it's all going
[1:04:07] to burn up
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:11] but yet the world that's why jesus said
[1:04:13] watch it the gentiles seek after the
[1:04:15] things of this world he said right
[1:04:18] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[1:04:20] all these things will be taken care of
[1:04:22] make sure you're seeking the kingdom of
[1:04:24] god
[1:04:25] i wonder just how much our affections
[1:04:27] are affect on things above and not below
[1:04:32] how many could come to the altar for
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:36] yeah we could all come to the altar say
[1:04:37] god i'm guilty of that i've got my
[1:04:39] affections too much on the things of
[1:04:41] this world
[1:04:43] because in this age that we have
[1:04:46] the way that we're living
[1:04:48] things getting harder it kind of gets in
[1:04:50] every one of our little bit hey i better
[1:04:52] get more because i ain't going to get
[1:04:54] much after a while
[1:04:57] i better get me a bundle of two two by
[1:04:59] fours before they go up twice the price
[1:05:01] they are now
[1:05:04] huh i want to build a deck that's that's
[1:05:06] all man i could he built that for a
[1:05:07] thousand that's gonna cost me three
[1:05:09] grand
[1:05:12] huh
[1:05:13] better get it done quick
[1:05:15] but anyway too much on the things of the
[1:05:17] world lord help us to realize
[1:05:20] this world's gonna fall apart i'm gonna
[1:05:23] get ready for the new world
[1:05:25] don't you
[1:05:26] anyway just a thought ahead lord help us
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:33] to look more to the supernatural
[1:05:37] another story that i really liked
[1:05:40] it has to do do with intervention
[1:05:43] in a
[1:05:44] in a in world war ii
[1:05:47] world war ii
[1:05:48] as you know
[1:05:50] hitler wanted to take france he took
[1:05:52] france he took italy and his next
[1:05:54] objective was to take england
[1:05:57] right
[1:05:58] churchill and all them
[1:06:00] and
[1:06:02] the allies had taken and they had come
[1:06:04] together and especially the majority of
[1:06:07] england soldiers had went to france to
[1:06:09] fight
[1:06:10] but they had very underestimated
[1:06:12] hitler's power and they got
[1:06:15] driven all the way back to a city called
[1:06:17] dunkirk into a little trap area
[1:06:19] somewhere and there was about 400 000
[1:06:21] men from what i understand there that's
[1:06:24] a lot of folks my friend
[1:06:26] and as they were coming in and they call
[1:06:28] it the miracle of dunkirk and how many
[1:06:31] notes miracles just don't happen
[1:06:33] unless god's involved
[1:06:37] and right there they were right up close
[1:06:39] to dunkirk they had him cornered they
[1:06:40] had him right there and all of a sudden
[1:06:42] hitler makes a
[1:06:44] decision huh
[1:06:47] let me see if i can read this
[1:06:49] however in one of the most widely
[1:06:52] debated and potentially
[1:06:54] pivotal decisions of the war
[1:06:57] adolf hitler ordered his generals to
[1:07:00] halt for three days
[1:07:02] huh
[1:07:04] they had him on the run
[1:07:05] they had him
[1:07:07] and they stopped
[1:07:09] who does that
[1:07:12] who does that
[1:07:14] no that somebody somebody's got to
[1:07:16] intervene here right
[1:07:19] praise god for intervention
[1:07:22] you know
[1:07:24] listen for three days giving the allies
[1:07:27] time to organize and evacuate
[1:07:30] in the end despite heavy fire from
[1:07:33] german fighters and bomber planes on the
[1:07:36] beaches how many knows it was it was bad
[1:07:39] folks and i i don't know about you but
[1:07:40] i'm here to tell you i believe all of us
[1:07:43] in school if you want me to tell you
[1:07:45] what people ought to teach these
[1:07:47] teenagers you don't have to do them too
[1:07:49] young but when they get a teenager years
[1:07:51] and before they get to be an adult they
[1:07:53] need to know all these people that gave
[1:07:56] their lives in the most ruthless way for
[1:07:58] their freedoms
[1:08:02] because the wonder bunch we got right
[1:08:04] now they don't appreciate them at all
[1:08:06] neither do our government and so forth
[1:08:08] but those people died by the millions
[1:08:11] for freedom
[1:08:14] amen and they ought to teach it
[1:08:16] teach every bit of it
[1:08:20] instead they're teaching them to be
[1:08:22] racist don't you just love it people
[1:08:25] that
[1:08:26] say oh you're racist turn around hey
[1:08:28] let's teach racism to our children
[1:08:31] that's what it is a bunch of hypocrisy
[1:08:34] huh
[1:08:36] ah didn't politics no that's just plain
[1:08:39] right even brother bam talk about the
[1:08:40] black folks and so forth hello
[1:08:43] you know that to be great they should
[1:08:44] get better teaching right there amongst
[1:08:46] themselves
[1:08:48] and and martin luther and what he did
[1:08:50] how he led him
[1:08:52] was wrong
[1:08:54] demons
[1:08:56] says he was devilish right okay let me
[1:08:58] back it back to the normandy
[1:09:00] well not normandy but done kirk
[1:09:04] amen you could probably tell us stories
[1:09:06] about that brother and you probably know
[1:09:07] more about united but anyway
[1:09:10] so listen so that's right
[1:09:12] they were bombarded
[1:09:15] hey i don't know about you but it'd be
[1:09:16] it'd be terrible you know
[1:09:18] in no full-scale german attack was
[1:09:21] launched
[1:09:23] now listen before i tell you how many
[1:09:25] they rescued the evacuation was by no
[1:09:28] means straight forward
[1:09:30] before long the harbor became
[1:09:32] potentially blocked by ships sunk during
[1:09:34] the constant raids from enemy aircraft
[1:09:37] in other words when it could usually
[1:09:38] load them up they couldn't because there
[1:09:40] was a bunch of ships sitting there so
[1:09:43] it became necessary to take the troops
[1:09:45] off by nearby beaches how many knows
[1:09:48] eventually they had to take their jeeps
[1:09:49] and their trucks and farm their own ramp
[1:09:53] to get onto boats and so forth
[1:09:55] huh
[1:09:57] all right
[1:09:59] an almost impossible task because of
[1:10:02] shallow water which prevented large
[1:10:04] ships from coming close coming in close
[1:10:06] to shore small ships were needed to
[1:10:08] ferry the troops from the beaches to the
[1:10:11] larger ships now back up to the story
[1:10:13] now notice
[1:10:17] in the end
[1:10:19] he says despite heavy fire and gunship
[1:10:20] and so forth the beaches no full scale
[1:10:22] was launched
[1:10:24] and over 300
[1:10:28] and 30 000 allied troops were eventually
[1:10:31] rescued
[1:10:33] that is a lot of soldiers folks
[1:10:38] and it said that uh
[1:10:42] churchill ordered he ordered uh
[1:10:45] different navy vessels and different
[1:10:47] ones to go and they says we expect we
[1:10:49] expect to be able to rescue about thirty
[1:10:51] thousand
[1:10:54] and they end up with three hundred and
[1:10:55] thirty
[1:10:57] how many believe things like that is
[1:10:58] divine intervention
[1:11:00] who in the world put it in hitler's mind
[1:11:02] hey let's just stop here
[1:11:05] uh
[1:11:06] they said it was a pivotal point because
[1:11:08] why if you didn't have any soldiers if
[1:11:09] england didn't have any soldiers they
[1:11:10] could have made it so much easier and
[1:11:13] everything else but god stops things
[1:11:16] he intercedes he intervenes
[1:11:20] same with many times you can find out
[1:11:22] and even even in that area if you'll
[1:11:24] notice that those sold
[1:11:26] on the ground they got a
[1:11:29] lot
[1:11:30] of relief because there was a lot of
[1:11:33] clays with cloud cover and those nose
[1:11:35] dive bombers couldn't come down through
[1:11:37] that
[1:11:38] see so as long as they had a lot of
[1:11:39] cloud cover they had a little rest
[1:11:41] god will even give cloud with clover
[1:11:43] where they need it
[1:11:44] aren't you glad for god that is
[1:11:46] governing and that cares about every
[1:11:47] detail of your life
[1:11:49] how many wants and more in your every
[1:11:51] everyday life lord jesus help me to
[1:11:52] realize you're not way off somewhere
[1:11:55] you're right here
[1:11:58] giving me supernatural power
[1:12:00] oh i like what brother batman his
[1:12:02] message is we're talking about a
[1:12:04] supernatural god with supernatural signs
[1:12:07] with a supernatural word preaching and
[1:12:10] so forth bringing it to a supernatural
[1:12:12] people
[1:12:13] how many believe the joy of the lord is
[1:12:16] supernatural
[1:12:17] peace of god is supernatural
[1:12:20] the joy of the lord is my strength
[1:12:25] talk about supernatural and spiritual
[1:12:27] power
[1:12:28] legion how many knows he had so many
[1:12:30] devils on him
[1:12:31] evil spirits on him that he made his
[1:12:34] frail body i am sure he looked like a
[1:12:37] druggie
[1:12:38] i'm sure he wasn't fed with a big bunch
[1:12:40] of steaks and everything he stayed in
[1:12:42] the grave i don't know where in the
[1:12:43] world he got all his food but listen he
[1:12:45] got so strong he would they would climb
[1:12:47] and change he'd break chains
[1:12:51] and that is the power of evil
[1:12:55] a supernatural evil power that caused
[1:12:58] him to be that strong
[1:13:01] we know that anybody that gets devil
[1:13:03] possessed and so forth that they get
[1:13:05] many times their strength that they
[1:13:07] would just normally
[1:13:09] lifting weights and becoming strong
[1:13:11] that's not it it's the spirit that's in
[1:13:14] them
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:18] like that one stadium says you know it's
[1:13:20] not the size of the dog in the fight but
[1:13:22] it's the size of the fight that's in the
[1:13:24] doll
[1:13:26] and listen i like that because he says
[1:13:28] you know if an evil spirit could make
[1:13:30] somebody that strong
[1:13:33] to pray change and everything what what
[1:13:35] the holy ghost supposed to do to
[1:13:37] believer
[1:13:41] how many dollars the holy ghost is
[1:13:44] strength
[1:13:46] god is my strength and my refuge
[1:13:52] he's our strength
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:56] that old 80 of some year old preacher
[1:13:58] coming up there on his overcoat
[1:14:00] but i'm saying why did they get the old
[1:14:03] geezer up now y'all forgot to give me i
[1:14:05] call old folks old geezers
[1:14:10] i'd take satami the other day i said
[1:14:12] check out what i got i'm not bad for an
[1:14:14] old geezer is it
[1:14:16] i call myself that so i hope that don't
[1:14:18] offend nobody but
[1:14:21] well i know what he's taking that old
[1:14:23] man up there when there's so many young
[1:14:25] people up there preaching to preach he
[1:14:27] got up there
[1:14:30] he got to thinking no doubt he got the
[1:14:31] preach he got under the anointing
[1:14:34] he kicked up his heels and scooped
[1:14:36] knowledge but he was preaching about the
[1:14:38] oh my the rainbow and coming back of
[1:14:40] christ and everything else you got so
[1:14:42] happy you ain't got enough room for me
[1:14:44] to preach up here
[1:14:46] huh
[1:14:48] oh my
[1:14:50] you get down on your knees
[1:14:52] you got to talk to the lord i may
[1:14:54] believe there's power in prayer
[1:14:56] why because you tap into the
[1:14:58] supernatural man if we need an
[1:15:00] electrical outlet to pluck in our power
[1:15:03] stuff we need a little bit of a plug in
[1:15:05] for our spiritual life
[1:15:07] that's why we come to church that's why
[1:15:09] we pray that's why we read because we
[1:15:11] need a charge from the lord to give us
[1:15:13] some power
[1:15:16] supernatural power
[1:15:19] the preacher needs it to preach with the
[1:15:21] congregation needs it to receive with
[1:15:25] oh my i like when you get a drill and
[1:15:28] you plug it in amen and you pull that
[1:15:30] trigger
[1:15:31] i'm telling you what the preacher gets
[1:15:33] the patient hey man if you're really
[1:15:34] plugged in and i like when the
[1:15:35] congregation gets a hey
[1:15:41] praise the lord glory
[1:15:49] but on the other hand
[1:15:51] preacher can't preach
[1:15:53] he ain't where he ought to be
[1:15:56] huh he can't preach
[1:15:58] congregation they're confused
[1:16:01] they get so
[1:16:05] you quiet hear a mouse run around
[1:16:08] huh
[1:16:10] no amens
[1:16:13] cold
[1:16:15] everybody can't wait for that preacher
[1:16:16] to quit i want to get in my car oh i got
[1:16:19] stuff to do
[1:16:21] get out of here this is too cold around
[1:16:23] here for me
[1:16:24] huh
[1:16:26] but you get the warmth of the holy
[1:16:27] spirit
[1:16:29] sheep that love each other
[1:16:31] you can't hear like barely get in your
[1:16:32] car to go fill us up a little longer huh
[1:16:36] talk and so forth and converse and so
[1:16:38] forth
[1:16:39] how many believes that
[1:16:41] that's what we need
[1:16:43] the supernatural power
[1:16:47] how many knows the greatest intervention
[1:16:49] that god ever did
[1:16:51] was when he sent
[1:16:52] jesus christ
[1:16:54] the great
[1:16:55] intervener
[1:16:57] between god and man
[1:16:59] we couldn't go behind that curtain we
[1:17:01] couldn't come into that presence
[1:17:04] you couldn't go into that holiness of
[1:17:05] holies you'll go behind that curtain and
[1:17:08] you will drop dead
