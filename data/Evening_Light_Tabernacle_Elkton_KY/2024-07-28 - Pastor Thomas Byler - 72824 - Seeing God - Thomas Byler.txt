father so Lord just clean out anything of Our Lives that would be hindering Lord we just ask that you would move today in a mighty way that you would just speak through our pastor this morning Lord

Lord we just come before you Lord and just want to say we just invite you into our music this morning Lord that you would just uh use the ministering of uh music to our hearts Lord to draw Us close to

bring glory to you and bring us closer to you we love you Lord with all of our hearts in Jesus name amen children can be dismissed to Sunday school and if you'll just stand with me and go with me in the Psalms here going to go to Psalm six this morning Psalm 6 just a few verses here oh Lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasen me in thy hot displeasure my soul is also sore vexed but thou oh Lord how long for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks my ey is consumed because of grief it is waxed old because of all mine enemies the Lord ha heard my supplications the Lord will receive my prayer let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly God bless you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters if you would turn with me to Corinthians 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter but reading that Psalm there you know God does really care you know how how many of us have been in that position in our life where you've had some type of situation some type of trouble in your life where you've been like David here in the psalm and you've given your whole soul heart and mind has been fixed by the things around you and then all of a sudden God just speaks to your heart you just know that he's heard you and he's going to make it right by you you know that's a that's a comforting thought so in the word of God if I don't lose all these places in here I was just going to read I was U I don't know how many times I listened to that message this last night and this morning and other times that last one brother Brandon preached which is called leadership it was in uh 1965 in December but I I made a note I I'm for some reason I have a hard time printing out quotes off of that table so I just wrote down something that struck my heart but I'll just read few of these verses is here in 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter and I'm sure all you know this chapter by heart you know the most important thing we can do the brother Bram always told us you got to read your Bible every day and every person has a certain portion of the word of God that means a lot to him um I like this chapter I read this a lot too for we know of our Earthly House of this Tabernacle word we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heaven so you know when you read that just that first verse there it really should open your heart to know that God cares you about you so much that he's thinking about you making this happen for you this morning and he goes on to say here for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven and I'm sure everyone feels that way this morning that's anop that everyone talks about that's calling you in that song your desire is to be in that place it goes on to say in the third verse if so being clothed we shall not be found naked for we are for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for what we would be unclothed but clothed upon the mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God who ha given us the earnest of the spirit this morning you all have that this morning there therefore we are always confident you know th was we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord and that's where we're all at this morning as long as you're in this body you're waiting to be on the other side in that body where you can see the Lord face to face and you know him and he goes on to say I lost my place but I for we walk not by faith but by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be AB absent from the body to be present with the L Lord wherefore we labor that we present whether pres present or absent we may be accepted of him I'll just finish at that ninth verse if you would go with me to uh the Epistle of John this morning let me open I know I get in a hurry you know I'm one of those individuals I I don't have a lot to say some of you all know that about me I don't say a whole bunch but uh I was just thinking this morning I wrote I was listen listening to that message about leadership this morning and I couldn't get this quote to print out I and I don't like bringing my tablet here because I have all my business stuff on and I'm always I've said this before I'm always afraid of some customers video coming up and and being a little bit too salty but um this is what brother brandom had I don't the exact quote where it comes from but it really struck me this morning now he said now look look at yourself really are you a genuine Bible Christian full of the love of God and and in this message he talked about he had several examples he talked about the Rich Young Ruler and then he talked about the Infidel that he was squirrel hunting with he met he had certain examples that he was bringing then he goes on to say and I just wrote a uh a little note to myself here when brother brownon was talking about full of the love of God well we know this morning that you can only be full of the love of God unless the you have to have God's holy ghost you have to have the presence of the Holy Ghost in your heart and life or you won't be full of the love of God you'll still have the world in you and he goes on to say you remember the Bible said in the last days when this time T when this time takes place he said he'll send Mark and Angels through and he said through the churches and I was thinking about that this morning you know we're at that place this morning where God is watching everything we do everything we say everything you know I know I'm not trying to be funny but sometimes we don't think God is watching us and we do things we know that really can you bring the things we do can you bring them through the word of God and that's what in that first thing he said are we Bible Christians this morning we only do the things that we can bring Through the Bible this morning the fully through the word of God if anything we're doing this morning can't fully come through the word of God then we don't need to have it in our hearts and lives this morning and I'll just I didn't write it all down I didn't but he said he goes on to say the Bible says in the last days this time takes place he said send the marking Angels throughout the churches and that's where I didn't I I didn't I sto writing but I was thinking some of the other things he was saying he was he he was talking to everyone in that church service in California he wasn't just talking to the Methodist he just wasn't talking to the Baptist he just wasn't talking to the Pentecostals he was also talking to us this morning in that message and and the thing that struck me about that message this morning is that he was speaking to our hearts and lives to let us know that the only thing that'll be there on that other side is the character that God builds in your heart in life this morning and the only way that you can have that character goes about what I wrote Are you a true genuine Bible Christian this morning and the only way you know that is by the word of God this morning and uh I hope I didn't lose my place here I think it's in the uh in the second chapter of the first Epistle of John I I'm not going to say I know I say a lot of cliches but I'm I'm not going to say you know think about me I've maybe the Army ruined me but I'm the kind of person that everything has to be done in brevity I I don't like saying a lot or doing a lot of things verbally I like to be consise about what I say I don't I don't like just I don't like running on and running on I like to get to the point about things that that probably comes to my Army days but everything has to be concise and to the point that's just the how I am but it goes on to say here this first verse in this chapter the second chapter my little children these things I write onto you that you sin not so John the Apostle John is telling us he's writing these things so that we don't sin that if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and heas is the propriation for our sins not of ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so John was seeing here that through throughout the until the coming of Jesus Christ that sacrifice was given one time for for the whole world for all those that would believe it and he goes on to say here hereby we know that we know him if we keep his Commandments and that goes back to what I was reading what brother I wrote down what brother banam said if you're a true Bible believing Christian you'll do what you'll do with this third verse you'll keep God's Commandments this morning and he goes on to say he he that saith I know him and and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in in him rarely is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him and he goes on to say he that he that saith he abideth him ought himself also the walk even as he walked so he's telling us giving us a charge here this morning that that example that need we need to look at is the example of Jesus Christ in the gospels that's who we need to emanate that's who we need to bring our lives around the word of God and whatever Christ was that's what we need to be and I lost my place there but he goes Brethren I write no new commandment onto you but any old commandment which you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning so John just like brother brandham just like any real man of God is always going to bring you back to the word of God he's not going to bring you to his own ideas or how he sees things he's always going to bring you back to God's word and and that's our responsibility as Christians genuine Christians is that everything that we do and believe has got to go back to the word of God and I'll just read read a few more verses and sit down and again I might reread the same verse again a a new commandment I write un you which thing is to and in you because darkness is passed and the True Light now shineth and he that sayith in he is in the light and he his brother is in darkness even to now we all live Above This I know and he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there's none occasion of stumbling in him but I I'll finish there and I was just thinking you know the world brother Brandon in that message this morning you know I can't listen to it enough he was he was talking he was just he was talking like I said to pend he was talking to everybody and just like John said you can't think of yourself anymore more than you really are he was genuinely telling the people that to be there on that day the word of God has to have its full effect in your heart and lives and you're deceiving yourself if it doesn't and it and what it really struck me a lot of times about the message of the hour you know he's talking in 1965 to these people but we're now in 2024 about to go into 2025 and see the things right now that he's talking about the depravity that's out there in the world and it should only draw us closer to Jesus Christ this morning as we believe the word of God for the hour they were living Brother David oh sorry joshen let's stand this morning I want to welcome everybody it's good to have Austin and Sarah and Hannah and all them back from the trip glad the Lord brought them back safely and good to have our visitors with us from Indiana who the gave us their charity

this morning amen we want to turn if you will amen and we'll begin with uh let me see here amen remember next weekend is the first Sunday of the month brother Nick Wright will be with us Sunday morning and Sunday evening amen so be praying for him amen that's coming up this next weekend all right let's go to um John 12 John 12 actually we'll read John 14 first and then we'll read John 122 let's go to St John the 14th chapter 12 and we'll begin with verse 23 actually let's go back up to verse 20 if we would amen and this is something that brother brandham preached on many times amen amen and I think his title most of the time that he preached on this was s we would see Jesus amen s we would see Jesus and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast the same came therefore to philli which was of Bethesda of Galilee and desired him saying s we would see Jesus Philip cometh and tth Andrew and Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it it die it bringeth forth much fruit amen now St John 12 I mean St John 14 I read St John 12 didn't I yeah let's go to St John 14 14 and we'll start with um 14 and let me see here we'll start with 19 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye see me and because I live ye shall live also and at that day you shall know that I am in the Father the father in me ye in me and I in you may God add these blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen this morning I want to speak on a simple subject and I'm sure I've spoken of on it before but amen I just want to I feel led to speak on it one more time amen and basically I want to read a couple scriptures if I or a couple quotes if I could and me try to lay a little foundations and amen and and this is kind of where it's took off at I like to sometimes just take off kind of where we left at left off at brother bam he makes a statement he was talking about those soldiers he says that crucified him and so forth we could think tonight of what a irrational and a horrible thing it was for those soldiers to put a rag over the face of our Lord Jesus to make fun of him being a prophet and could notice that could no the secrets of the heart a rag over his face and sent him out there in the courtyard and took a stick and struck him on the head with it and then passed it one to another and said if you be a prophet prophesy now and tell us which one of us hit you see no respects at all he says they couldn't feel no virtue but that little woman with enough Faith That Could Touch His Garment she got her desires you see we've got to be we've got to be conscience of God's presence amen amen amen I what came to me a conscience of God's presence for amen our conscience has to be in tune with his presence amen it's quite something isn't it that we're living in a world we're living in a world where somebody could do that to the Lord Jesus Christ and treat him in that way isin't that right and then another person just by the touching to the ham of their garments after they had spent all their money on doctors a that right yet grew worse never could get her healing even not a doctor in the world could heal her never couldn't help her but when she just touched the Hem of His Garment she was made completely whole virtue went out of her amen how many believe that we're still living in the same world that if you can believe this morning there is no telling whatever it is that you have need of this morning God is present I don't want him to be present TR in somebody else that don't do you any good God has to come present in here he's got to come in here because if he's not in here it really doesn't do you any good better B him talk about I believe it was uh running from the presence of God talking about how that people will cuss and curse and everything else Ain that right because they don't feel the presence of God but let a Christian come in there and say I wish you wouldn't you and all of a sudden they'll Oh They'll they'll straighten up amen I guarantee you sisters when you go down through Walmart amen and you're walking down through there and all these women dressed in every other way that you can imagine when they look at you it ain't no telling what goes through their mind oh there's still a woman around here with Holiness we went to my my my granddaughter's game yesterday you know and we was at the park and I'll say what I I I I was about to hit I I had my record I was going to be record it cuz it got so noisy I about needed earplug them folks get into it folks but anyway then I I seen a woman going walking through there and she had a skirt on you know I'm like wow there's a woman here with a skirt on she must be Pentecostal but as she walked by it was so tight hello I said well that didn't do much good even if she is Pentecostal if it's too tight it really don't do nothing good amen but still just to think that when you dress the way you should do you not realize that those people are coming into the presence of God if you're filled with the Holy Ghost oh my I'm so glad that man I'll tell you what just by the grace of almighty God it's amazing grace amen amen oh my TW was grace that brought me safe this far be grace that will take me home amen I was once blind but now I see and how many knows that's spiritual blindness people don't see God oh my yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye will see me how many glad that you're able to see God oh he said the world's not going to see me anymore and do you even realize that the people while he was there didn't see God my title this morning is seeing God seeing God Amen how many knows their God was manifest In the Flesh manifest In the Flesh the word was with God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and they still did see him that's right they didn't see God even the disciples Brother Brad they looked at him they were around him they didn't see God a't that right see Philip saith unto him in Chapter 14 verse 7 verse 8 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it'll satisfy us cuz he kept talking about the father didn't he show us the father and it'll satisfy us and Jesus says unto him have I been with you so long a time with you and yet H has thou not known me Phillip you still don't know who I am Oh my he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me amen how many the fullness of the godhead was manifested in him bodily I want to make a statement just because I see you don't mean I see you just because you introduced me to your friend for the first time doesn't mean I now know him you might know his name you might know how he looks but you don't really know him you don't know what kind of person this is do you because what he really is is his character his character defines him remember brother Brandon preached a message called way back in 1964 I believe is God is identified by his characteristics in other words his character is what defines God the way that you know God is by his character all can I go slower when I think about what we talked about here amen across the pulpit and how that we look at God and how that he was amen Before Time was way back there he was omniscient he was omnipresent and he's omnipotent amen all powerful but when now we want to look at the amazingness of his character and to be able to see him because of his character amen let me finish this here first so he says he how can you say that he saids now notice he says believest now not that I am in the father and the father in me the word the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake how many believes sudden here you're identified by What You Do by your actions your actions identify you say well I'm a Christian like brother brother Brian was saying so you say I'm a Christian but then let me see your works you can say it all you want to but let me watch your actions that speaks louder I can really see it when I see the love of God coming from you amen for the gra of God coming from you but if you say you're a Christian and you got bitterness and hatred and everything else there's something that's not Jing so to speak it don't add up you aren't what you claim you are I thought I knew you but I didn't really know you you don't know a person just by seeing them you know them by the actions that they have and that's what Jesus was saying The Works am mean if you can't believe me then believe the works believe the works that's my character that's what I am people are what their character

dead and bring you and stand you before me make you answer for everything you've done amen how many glad that we stand in the presence of God and say God whatever down our Lord take it away from me cleanse me from all unrighteousness amen we want to send our sins on up beforehand under judgment so that when he comes Amen on that day the devil tries to say he did that he says I'm sorry but there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus there's nothing against them I've got nothing on the record books of them folks amen at evening light Tabernacle amen woo at that day brother bam said that was this day at that day you'll see me why because I'll not only be with you but I'll be inside of you I'm going to tell you something I don't just see him I feel him I don't know about

drink and better smoke than they can smoke hello why this is the pure stuff this is the pure thing this is the thing that they're supposed to enjoy themselves with the crushed Lily the open that comes from the crushed lily of the valley come down into your heart take a little bit of that you won't want none of that other stuff folks when I was out there in the world and man they always wanted the best weed they always wonder is it any good is it any good well how about this morning heyen is your religion any good I want you to understand I got the best religion I got the only religion that satisfies that makes you feel good amen my that's right think about it those Greeks came brother brandham so many times would preach that you know why because brother brandham would illustrate it now they wanted to see Jesus and Jesus said unless a corn of wheat fall in the ground in other words unless I die it's just going to be me amen but if I die amen it'll bring forth many many of them there'll be a whole lot then you'll see Jesus how many believes you can see him in the universe you can see him in creation and you can see him his word you can see him in his church you can see God in his people amen so many ways that you can see God and I love seeing him you can look at man failures but you look at him and you're looking at Perfection amen praise the Lord believe me for the very Works sake because it wasn't Jesus that doing the works it was God that was doing the works I'm standing here you're sitting there because God's Works how many believe that because of his works because what he done oh I love to talk about God I was going to title it a talk about God because I like to talk about him I like to talk about seeing him I like to talk about how he works I like to talk about his character how many times David says you know forget not all of his testimonies testify about his testimony oh we like to hear each other's testimony what's your testimony but what about God's testimony God's got the greatest testimony of everybody or anything tell me more about the three Hebrew children and what God did when he come down there and delivered them tell me again about Daniel and the lion s tell me about the great Miracles the testimonies of God I was reading there in Psalms he says who's ever going to actually be able to properly Proclaim all of the glory and testimonies of god wow we'd be here a while wouldn't we amen but I like that you can see God by his characteristics even Jesus told him when they wanted to see him he says when I'm dead and raised again then you'll see me how many believes that you'll see me Peter saw him that's right the impotent man who couldn't walk rise up I believe that you perceive that you have faith be healed in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk amen what is it I was listening to to uh let me see here if I got it brother Brian's Sunday school that if you claim that you know him you claim to know him then you also ought so to walk amen how many believes you you claim to know God you claim to have seen God well if you really have and he's coming the way that he has said that he would come your mouth is going to talk like him your walk is going to walk like him your affections is going to be on him you're going to love like him you're going to have faith like him you're going to be him aren't you praise be to God oh my brother brand preach a message called Paradox ain't that right he begin to talk about how that you can see God in his creation Now I wrote down here in my notes we take so much for granted we take God so much for granted because when you really think about it he made all things for him ain't that right all things were made by him and for him whatever he created he created for his good pleasure we'll never Elevate ourselves or get spiritual talking about each other what a great man this is or great man that is or this that or the other no there's one that we can talk about that'll Lift us up and that is the great man Jesus Christ Amen brother bandam I heard him yesterday preaching he was talking about the Kenedy in the different ones man they'll get one and they'll brag him up brag him up brag him up and get a platform for him he says we're here to build a platform to Jesus we're here to promote him amen a lot of people looking for the next president who's going to be the next president folks I'm looking for a new heavens and a new Earth not a new president it's all debauched isn't it amen praise the Lord let me just kind of take a little side street here we all know that when camela was when she was became the vice president and all of that that she wore the color of dress brother Braham said that a woman with a certain dress and it was the color of the dress wasn't it that's the kind of color clothes that she had on and we all like whoa is this the woman and really he's just set a great woman in office I don't know he ever said she'd actually be president but here we are at the very brink of her actually becoming president and let me tell you something with the Crooked voting machines I wouldn't be a bit surprised they get her in hello and if she does come in hello signs of the time ain't that right next thing was what a big old bomb blowing up and me I was doing a little research they said and Russia had three bombs just three of their bombs would make it an America uninhabitable just three of them they got plenty of them two of them for Europe just two of them for Europe wow hello it's amazing how power how much power they have but you know what the miraculous thing is is that they can't do it until God allows it thank you Lord you and I be gone out of here before that happens amen that's God that's a paradox I thought when I thinking about par that's a paradox a miracle how many you you see God in the Miracles that he works because he specializes in things thought impossible amen if we can just be conscious of his presence omnipresent the Bible says that everything is sustained by God it's held together by God every bleed of grass that has life in it has God in it ain't that right because it's his power is that right it's his power that causes it to grow like I with think fixing say a while ago the reason we take it so for granted is because we're born in it we're born and raised around the glory of God the power of God his glory f kills all the Earth how many believe that when you look into galaxies the Stars the moon all of that you can see them how many belev for a Believer does something brother brandham could have a jubilee Pentecostal fit running around a tree by just watching an eagle in a squirrel to hear a elk call in a and a uh wolf how is that right he could have a jubilee God I hear you huh I'll tell you something when the saints sing when the saints clap when the saints pray I hear God why because the devil would have everybody quiet amen wo I hear God there's somebody alive hello Hallelujah Glory you hear God cuz the devil once it's so quiet that when somebody in the back says amen everybody look around who was that what was that huh oh thank the Lord you love him this morning oh how we love him we think about in everything you see God take for granted that the Four Seasons didn't brother Bram explained to us that every year testifies there's a resurrection every year a yearly testimony but I'm call it the spring amen it's the spring of a person's life when you're young ain't that right then you go up into summer you're middleaged is that right from 20 to 50 maybe and then from 50 to 80 it's fall that's right the leaves change CH color that's right get all different color than what it was and after a while it dries up and it falls down a that right the sap goes back down into roots of the tree cold winter [Music] come I remember at home and in bed to hear them winds blow at night and it would whistle it was spooky friends it was spooky laying there dead in the graveyard they're gone brother Ivan gone many many we could mention brother Billy sister Janie many different ones gone oo spooky huh Americans with their jokes and stuff they're going by a graveyard acting like they're not scared huh they know they got it coming amen but guess what after a while all the leaves there's no Greenery all everything's Brown everything Dead all covered with the snow but guess what after after a while here comes the robins here comes the birds tweaking here comes the little leaf coming back every year testifies those Saints won't stay there they're going to rise again I see God in the season everywhere you look you can see God it does something for you amen Rise Again folks I know how about you we uh Peter said according you know we look for a new heavens and a new Earth knowing that these elements shall melt with fervent heat but we look for a new heavens and a new Earth where in dwelleth what we're pushing here righteousness what we want righteousness and that way we all want say God take every bit of unrighteousness from me Lord because that's when you that's you know what was it my wife was saying she's seen something about taking an exam you know take how was it taking an exam and uh then wanting to know the score or something you know no you you you you got to take the exam first before you find out the score amen you can't do it after you know tell me the score and then take me to Z no people want to go to heaven and then or go some Purgatory no it's too late then you do it here amen another one every day how many beles every day what time is it quarter to 12 ah a lot of us turning 40 lot of us turning 40 about 12:00 that right it's all downhill from there 12:00 1 2 3 4 heading down the other way high and noon 40 years old well you're up there now it's over the fixing to be over the hill that right that's what it represents in the mornings you're born woo Springtime go out there and listen to the bird sing and everything else and happy and jumping around and everybody's happy but now midday you're about the middle and then it goes on down to the hours of sunset is that right in the evening time getting old to finally guess what when it gets dark you lay down ain't that something God wrote it so to speak in our DNA he wrote it in the heavens he wrote it on a everyday basis why can't people just open their eyes and see there is a God if you don't believe in God don't believe in that there is a God you won't amount to too much you won't amount to too much you'll be all sailes no anchor that's how the world is they all sails and no anchor we think how well how can it get any worse how can it get any worse well I think imitating having a bunch of drag queens imitating the Lord's Supper huh what just before Olympics truly truly Sodom to the core Sodom and Gomorrah to the core it's about time to get out of here cuz God's not just going to let that slide forever no he's not Brother Brad I truly believe that as long as his children here that's the only thing that's keeping him from bringing judgment upon the world those that are still righteous remember Abraham said are you gonna destroy Sodom if there's five 40 or 50 righteous all the way down just a few if there's any righteous will you destroy nope ain't that right what was it about four of them come out and the one turned back to a pillar of salt cuz she looked back very few even they had to come out that's why brother Ram says don't worry about the bride going through the tribulation period why God don't burn the his his people with the wicked no he don't he takes them out amen so it's the righteous people that are still keeping the wrath of God off of this world but when that Rapture takes place when that Rapture takes place and those two prophets say no more rain hello fleas frogs flies and bring all kinds of curses upon the Earth can you imagine I don't even want to imagine I don't want to be here to imagine amen it's going to be a terrible place and we're right on the verge of it any time now the Lord could come at any time folks be ready for you know not the day nor the hour but as we see the signs appearing amen you better be ready I like that how many wants to be ready Jesus said be ready he didn't say be almost ready he didn't say get ready he said be ready be ready for you know not when the hour comes when that thief comes in in and in maybe it'll happen at midnight but Bram says between 6 and 99 is that right well only six and nine in about one place on the earth everything else is a different time amen so you better be ready no matter what time he comes but back to thinking about it you see God in every day in every day that you live you should be able to see God's testimony that there's a resurrection that there's it's not over with it's not finished you lay down at night you get your rest why in the morning Bo I'm fresh and ready to go brand new man every single day you testify of the death burial and resurrection of people amen that God's going to bring it to pass other things that we don't see like consider The Sparrows how God feeds them ain't that right they don't and the lies of the field they don't to but your heavenly Father Knows what you have need of seek the kingdom of God first in other words God's Providence a lot of times we don't see we don't recognize that every time you have need of something God supplies it for you maybe one job closes and something else will open up it's always if you're a child of God you don't have to worry God is going to take care of you he's going to take care of you and a lot of time we don't recognize how that God does take care of us I see God if don't let me Vis it I was a tractor supply I think yesterday and I wanted to get this little building just a little small building has that tent tarp over it whatever and I was looking for a certain size and I talked to the lady the lady says do you have any of these tents yeah over there we have these little buildings whatever little tents went over there and they didn't have anything but just a little bitty ones and I want a little bit bigger one and ah you know don't have it no you can go on Amazon and order I guess this out or the other said all right well I come all the way here just to try to get one and so but that's all right so on my way out they're leaning against the wall is exactly what I wanted I said well how did that ain't supposed to be over there supposed to be over here with the rest of this stuff I said hey lady I found it over here I found what I wanted right over here and you know what came through my mind what came through my mind is I don't know who left it there put it there somebody grabbed and says I want is halfway out they said no I don't want this after all they said it there cuz God knew I would be coming in I wanted something I said that's God he knows what you need he knows what you want and before I ever got there before I ever come God do what I have need of can we say this morning God knew before the foundation of the world that you would want salvation that you would want joy unspeakable and full of Glory that you'd have needed forgetful forgiveness and that he would want it so he supplied it 2,000 years ago not just then but before the foundation of the world he made it ready for you he says I'm going to put it in writing CU I know and you as a Christian how many know everything you have need of God will have it there I believe the scripture says God had knows what you have need of before you even ask how many's glad to serve a god like that thank you God for supplying you can have less gray hair now you don't have to worry about stuff because you know that you're in God's hands God will take care of you what God wants from you what God wants from me is your heart make room in that heart for Him will you make time for God pray so that you can see him in a greater way amen I won't read is I wanted to lay this for a foundation but it just comes to my mind now but we'll just go we'll just go quick over this where brother Bram talked about a little boy that went to his mom I believe it was and goes can anybody see God Mom said well ask your Sunday school teachers he went he went to the Sunday School teachers and they R to Sunday school says well ask the pastor you know I don't know ask the pastor if anybody can see God Amen the pastor says no son no oh son nobody can see God is that right and this I'm going to read this part the little fellow was disappointed amen and he used to stay down on the river he says we live near the Ohio river and he used to go down there with an old fisherman up the river a peace Tower Six Mile Island fishing all the time and one day after a big rain along this time of the year he was coming pulling down through the waters you know and any Boatman knows how that is music after raining is over and the little bitty waves on the water and you just let your ore slip across as if you were pulling your boat and was clipping along and the old fisherman had a long white beard he be to look over his shoulder where the sun come out and the sun had rain it had just rained in and there was a rainbow he pulled the ORS he turned around and look and a little fellow NOS of tears coming off of his white beard as it dropped down he'd pull a little further and he'd looked back oh the little boy he was s in the bow of the boat so he run towards the stern of the boat and he says sir I'm going to ask you a question that my mother can't answer my Sony school teacher and my pastor he said God is so great said Can anyone see him the old fisherman pulled his ores into his lap throw his hands to his face and like that and wept out grabbed that little fellow and huged and said God bless you a little heart honey all I've seen the past 35 years has been God how many believes every Sunrise every sunset we can see God everywhere that's right thank you Lord how many's glad to be able to see God when you see a sinner repenting you see God touching somebody's Hearts when you see them giving their heart to God Amen it's the master putting an imprint touching their heart all the things that we sometimes fail to see fail to recognize and each other didn't the Bible say he says that uh many are weak and sickly among you and many are even dead because we don't discern the Lord's body how many believ that I'm looking at God's body know you not that you are the body of Christ and members in particular how many beli the Church of the Living God is where Jesus dwells when you see kindness come from somebody when you see love a care coming from somebody you see God how many believes wives and husbands you should see it in each other children should see it in their parents we should see God in one another how it's because of the character that we have you don't see Christ's character when somebody spitting mad and and cussing at you no that's not God how mean knows the devil is easy to see the devil ah it's not hard to see him at all but sometimes it's harder to see God it's quite something that even the disciples couldn't hardly see him they should have realized that's not that's not just a man that's more than a man that's why I'm so excited when I think about God in this hour the unveiling how many brother B preached unveiling of God God veils himself he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveals it to babes such as will learn God actually hides himself hides himself in Simplicity and you know how he reveals himself according to the prophet it's in the same he reveals himself in the same way in simplicity it's a little thing sometimes that we don't recognize like we should amen when you see longsuffering huh not short but long suffering when you see gentleness when you see meekness when you see Christians forbearing one another in love is that right putting up with each other not get all hostile because somebody isn't quite where we are or the way that you think they ought to be because they're not all going to be the way that you think they ought to be but have patience how many beli we have patience one with another how about not holding accounts the devil holds grudges the Holy Spirit doesn't hold any accounts those Pharisees wanted to Stone that woman that was caught in the very act but God was merciful how many believes you see that you see God in somebody that's merciful find somebody in the church always condemning everybody else and this that or the other remember that's not God God will say let's pray for him we're going to believe God's going to deliver him from that let's pray for him not talk bad about him we see God in each other in what we say and the way we talk and our kindness one to another our love one for another Jesus said so much he says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another love is forgiving love is kind love love suffereth long amen it's not boastful it doesn't seek its own don't we need a good great big old syringe full of I mean a big old syringe full I we need a big old syringe full of the shot of God God to get rid of our selfishness this is a generation of self-love it's about me huh we know that eternal life is living for others not for yourself but yet we're living in a very selfish age I don't know how to put it I don't know how to put it it's despicable it's repulsive to Thomas berer to see how to go how to the world am me treats the Lord how they treat the very God that's all around them and they don't even try to open their eyes and realize even the prophet of God talked about the rotation of the Sun and the Moon and how the moon holds the tides out if it would go out the whole T the whole thing it flood over the moon has to say in its place and the stars in their place and the sun in its place you think it's hot at 95 with a heat index of 110 yeah it's hot but let it get a little bit closer and see what happens probably at 150 we'd all be dead our air conditioners are fry hello but it's all held by the mighty hand of God how many's glad that your world is held by the hand of God my life is held by the hand of God your life is held by the hand of God and why is that because God is giving you enough Grace for you to surrender yourself and say Lord here I am I'm yours I'm just a dumb sheep God I need your direction I can't do without you I'm totally lost without you I I'm incapable of making the right choices do the right things say the right things I always stick my foot in my mouth huh I need the Lord to help me keep my foot out of my mouth keep me from saying what I shouldn't say let him have the preeminence in my life I thank him so much amen that he keeps us in that way praise the Lord just's a very few people that have ever saw God ain't that right I think Moses was was uh permitted to see the backside of him you can't look at me can't see me but you can see the backside all right brother brandom I won't read the story but when he was praying for the Salvation of his dad you know and he was out and praying and he was on his porch I believe it was there he had went out in the field and then he came back in the house and he was praying for the Salvation something says get up and go and he got up and went back into that broom Sage field and there he was praying amen and something woke him up and not woke him up got him up and he looked and he seen Jesus y'all remember that the side of him and he said he had a he had a robe on he had beard short beard like and hair down to his shoulder I don't get some ideas now but he had his arms folded is that right kind of sideways brother BR was seeing him sideways and he kind of moved around he wanted to see him and he never moved he said until he said Jesus and he said he turned and looked at me when he turned and looked at him he says the closest description that he could give with behalf man's head of Christ he said the closest he could but he said it would seemed like if he would speak he could speak things out of existence or whatever is that right just so amazing that he he he lost Consciousness he found himself woke up amen went back to the house and saw him he said he was a shorter fell Jesus wasn't a tall he was a shorter fell he said so he got to see him amen I don't know about you but we see him by faith don't we we see his works we see his attributes we see what God's doing but we see don't see him face to face yet we don't see him eye to eye yet but I want to say this in closing think about this there's something on the inside of us and that that's been born Born Again These Bars of bone they hold my soul ain't that right but one of these days what is on the inside is going to work its way out but's on the inside that Holy Ghost that fire that man that's been born again when he's going to grow and this shell so to speak is going to crack and it's going to be changed how many believe it's going to be changed and what's going to happen is we're going to fill 1 John 3 and verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be amen but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen this Jesus that we have in our hearts one of these days will become visible to us how many believes that and he is now in us but he shall be with us amen every time I've ever preached this he says he was with the disciples but we got something greater now they were with him but now he's in us but I want to change it again because it's going to change again to being in us back to with us Revelations 21:3 and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God stand with me this morning and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne how many believes he sitting on the throne of your heart right now amen and we're hearing this and believing this that one of these days the things that we believe by faith are going to materialize how many believe that the Rapture is going to materialize this body is materially it's going to change from mortality to IM IM mortality we're going to see like that song says oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever of his Saving Grace on the streets of Glory let me lift my voice cares all past home at last ever to Rejoice how many he's looking forward to seeing face to p face we have him now in our hearts but we look forward to the day that we'll be able to see him touch him fall before him and forever live with him amen I saw a sign out there it says 2024 Jesus I said amen that's right that's who we're voting for Jesus 2024 amen hopefully this will be the Year this will be the time that he comes how many's looking for his return let's bow our heads kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus Lord we don't know what we would do if it wasn't for you without him how lost we would be and Lord we thank you Father for knowing god that we would have a desire to be saved we'd want to be your children we want you as our leader our guide Our God our king and you made a way for that Lord Jesus and I pray this morning if there there's any in here that doesn't know you that can't see you don't have a intimate relationship with you father I pray God you'd have mercy because that's the only way they'll get it is if you have mercy that you have Grace if there's anyone in here that claims to serve you Christian but not where they should be may they raise your hand their hand in Repentance say God forgive me Lord Jesus for not recognizing you not having faith in you like I should cuz you said when when I come back to earth will I even find anybody that believes Lord you have a group here I believe that truly believes and has Faith Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ fill each one aresh with your spirit Lord and help us to recognize you Lord not just in the stars and the moon the galaxies not just in the earth and the trees but help us to recognize you in our own lives working father that it's not us speaking it's not us living it's you it's Christ in me doing the living doing the speaking treating my children a certain way treating my wife a certain way wife treating her husband a certain way everything that we do Lord Jesus May our character reflect you Lord may people around us on our jobs our workers may they see Jesus in US father for that is truly where you are we ask God this morning this service dedicated father to us yielding ourselves to you and
