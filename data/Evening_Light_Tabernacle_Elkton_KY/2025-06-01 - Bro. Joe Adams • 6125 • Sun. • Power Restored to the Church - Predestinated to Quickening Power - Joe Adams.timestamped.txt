[18:14] Good morning, brothers and
[18:16] sisters. If we'll just stand this
[18:21] morning. Maybe uh Brother Tommy will
[18:23] open us in prayer this morning.
[18:44] Father,
[19:11] All of our
[19:25] sacrifice. Obvious
[19:58] Amen. If you're going with me in the
[20:00] Psalms to Psalms 8, we're just going to
[20:03] read Psalms 8. It's a short little
[20:05] Psalms
[20:07] here. Sure is good to be back in the
[20:09] house of the Lord this morning,
[20:11] expecting great
[20:14] things where two or three are gathered.
[20:17] He said that he he promised that he'd be
[20:18] in our midst. We believe that.
[20:21] We're at Psalms
[20:24] 8. Oh Lord our God, how excellent is thy
[20:28] name in all the earth who has set thy
[20:30] glory above the heavens.
[20:42] When I consider thy heavens, the work of
[20:44] thy fingers, the moon and the stars
[20:47] which thou hast ordained,
[20:56] For thou hast made him a little lower
[20:58] than the angels, and has crowned him
[20:59] with glory and honor.
[21:11] to the field.
[21:18] This one together. Oh Lord, our Lord,
[21:21] how excellent is thy name in all the
[21:24] earth. God bless you, brother
[21:44] Josh. Amen. Welcome everybody this
[21:46] morning. You ready to worship the Lord?
[21:48] Amen. Who come expecting this morning?
[21:51] Amen. I know. I sure did. It's good to
[21:53] have our visitors here with us, the
[21:54] Adams family. Amen. Anyone else that's
[21:56] tuning in via the stream, it's good to
[21:58] have you here, too. Amen. Listening, my
[22:00] sins are gone this morning. You ask me
[22:02] why I'm
[22:04] happy. You ask me why I'm happy. So,
[22:10] I'll just tell you why.
[22:14] Because my sins are gone.
[22:19] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[22:24] where they are, I
[22:28] say my sins are
[22:31] gone. Oh, there underneath the blood on
[22:37] the cross of Calvary.
[22:40] As far removed as darkness is from
[22:45] dawn in the sea of God's
[22:49] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[22:52] me. Praise
[22:55] God. My sins are
[22:59] gone. Was at the old time altar where
[23:04] God came in my heart. And
[23:08] now my sins are
[23:12] gone. The Lord took full
[23:16] possession. The devil did
[23:20] depart. Yes, I'm glad my sins are
[23:25] gone. Oh, there underneath the blood on
[23:30] the cross of Calvary.
[23:34] as far removed as darkness is from
[23:39] dawn in the sea of God's
[23:42] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[23:45] me. Praise
[23:48] God. My sins are gone.
[23:53] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[23:57] to make me down, I
[24:01] say my sins are
[24:05] gone. You got me into trouble, but Jesus
[24:11] got me out. I'm
[24:14] glad my sins are gone.
[24:19] Oh, there underneath the blood on the
[24:23] cross of
[24:24] Calvary. They're as far removed as
[24:28] darkness is from
[24:31] dawn. In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[24:36] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[24:41] My sins are
[24:44] gone and I'm living now for Jesus. I'm
[24:49] happy night and day
[24:53] because my sins are
[24:57] gone. My soul is filled with music. With
[25:02] all my heart I say I
[25:06] know my sins are gone.
[25:11] Oh, there underneath the blood on the
[25:15] cross of
[25:17] Calvary as far removed as darkness is
[25:21] from
[25:23] dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[25:28] that's for me. Praise
[25:32] God. My sins are
[25:36] gone. Amen. Give the Lord a hand of
[25:39] praise this morning.
[25:41] Amen. There's power, power, wonder
[25:43] working power in the
[25:44] blood. Oh, would you be free from the
[25:49] burden of sin? There's power in the
[25:54] blood. There is power in the blood.
[26:00] for
[26:01] you full of victory when there's
[26:07] wonderful power in the
[26:10] blood. Oh, there is
[26:13] power,
[26:15] power, wonder working power in the
[26:21] blood of the lamb.
[26:25] Oh, there is
[26:27] power,
[26:28] power, wonder working power in the
[26:33] preious blood of the lamb. Let's sing
[26:37] the third
[26:38] verse. Oh, would you be wider, much
[26:43] wider than snow? There's power in the
[26:47] blood. There is power in the blood.
[26:52] And since things are lost in its
[26:56] lifegiving blow, there's wonderful power
[27:01] in the
[27:03] blood. Oh, there is
[27:06] power, power, wonder working power in
[27:11] the
[27:13] blood of the lamb.
[27:17] Oh, there is
[27:19] power, power, wonder working power in
[27:24] the
[27:25] preious blood of the
[27:30] lamb. When would you do service for
[27:35] Jesus your king? There's power in the
[27:39] blood. There is power in the blood.
[27:45] Would you lift me his praises to
[27:52] sing? Power in the
[27:55] blood. Oh, there is
[27:58] power,
[28:00] power, wonder working power in the
[28:05] blood of the lamb.
[28:10] There is
[28:11] power,
[28:13] power, wonder working out in the
[28:17] preious blood of the
[28:21] lamb. Oh, there is
[28:24] power,
[28:26] power, wonder working power in the
[28:31] blood of the lamb.
[28:36] There is
[28:37] power, power, wonder working power in
[28:42] the
[28:43] preious blood of the
[28:49] lamb. Amen. We've got the power in the
[28:52] name of
[28:53] Jesus. We've got the
[28:59] power in the name of Jesus.
[29:04] We've got the
[29:09] power in the name of the
[29:11] [Music]
[29:14] Lord. And though Satan
[29:18] rages, we cannot be
[29:23] defeated. We've got the
[29:28] power in the name of the Lord.
[29:34] Oh, give me your
[29:38] hand. Let's agree
[29:42] together that all of our
[29:47] eneies will crumble at our
[29:52] feet. And whatever we bind on earth, it
[29:58] shall be bound in heaven.
[30:03] Oh, at the name of
[30:06] Jesus, Satan has to
[30:10] [Music]
[30:11] flee. We've got the
[30:16] power in the name of
[30:19] [Music]
[30:21] Jesus. We've got the
[30:26] power in the name of the Lord.
[30:31] And though Satan
[30:33] [Music]
[30:35] rages, we cannot be
[30:40] defeated. We've got the
[30:45] power in the name of the
[30:49] Lord. And for many years
[30:54] now, Satan's tried to stop us.
[31:00] Oh, but the bride of
[31:04] Jesus, the Lord is still
[31:08] alive. And like a mighty
[31:13] army, we keep marching
[31:18] onward, winning every
[31:23] battle because the Lord's on our side.
[31:29] We've got the
[31:32] power in the name of
[31:37] Jesus. We've got the
[31:41] power. Oh, in the name of the
[31:47] Lord. And though Satan
[31:51] reigned, we cannot be defeated.

[35:29] every chain. Break every
[35:35] chain. To break every chain. Break every
[35:40] chain. break every
[35:45] chain. Amen. That's you and me this
[35:48] morning. Amen. We're going to go to
[35:50] prayer at this time. Man, we don't have
[35:52] any written prayer requests this
[35:53] morning. I wonder if Brother Brad if
[35:54] you'd come this morning. Brother Danny
[35:56] and brother Michael John and brother
[35:57] Paul if you'd come and take up the
[35:59] offering. Amen. But if you have a need,
[36:02] just let it be known before the Lord
[36:04] uplifted hand as we go to prayer. Amen.
[36:06] Brother Brad.
[36:10] Father, we just come this morning, Lord,
[36:12] and just step into your presence, Lord.
[36:15] And we're thankful for your presence
[36:16] amongst us this morning. And we trust
[36:19] that there's a full liberty and freedom
[36:22] in in the presence here this morning,
[36:25] Lord. And we just ask, Lord, that you
[36:26] would come into our midst in a special
[36:28] way this morning and speak to the hearts
[36:30] of your believers this morning. And you
[36:32] saw the hands all over the building this
[36:34] morning and the needs that's been
[36:35] brought before you. The unspoken request
[36:37] and we know that there's needs are many,
[36:40] Lord. But we know you're a great God,
[36:42] Lord, and you're able and and
[36:43] functioning, Lord, and able to meet each
[36:45] and every need that's before us, Lord.
[36:47] So, we commit these needs into your
[36:48] hands, Lord, and trusting as your will
[36:51] be done, Lord. Lord, we just ask that
[36:53] you bless this offering, Lord, in a
[36:54] special way this morning. Bless those
[36:56] that can give, those who cannot.
[36:59] bless Brother Joe this morning in a
[37:01] special way, Lord, and just give him the
[37:03] liberty as we've seen him study and set
[37:05] himself aside and and preparing for the
[37:08] service. And we trust that we've come
[37:10] prepared, Lord, that there's a bedding
[37:12] ground as the word falls and the in and
[37:14] the word falls that it'll just be a
[37:17] place that it can grow and it can move,
[37:19] Lord Jesus, as it's our heart's desire
[37:21] just to grow into you. So we commit the
[37:23] service into your hands now and
[37:25] everything that be said and done to
[37:27] bring honor and glory to you. In Jesus
[37:29] name we pray.
[37:33] Amen. Morning. May mean God bless you as
[37:36] you give. Amen. Can we sing that little
[37:38] song? When I think about the Lord, how
[37:41] he saved me.
[37:43] When I think about the
[37:48] Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me,
[37:55] how he filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[38:02] how he healed me to the uttermost.
[38:08] When I think about the
[38:12] Lord, how he picked me up and turned me
[38:18] around, how he placed my
[38:23] feet on solid
[38:27] ground. Oh, it makes me want to
[38:32] shout a hallelu.
[38:36] Thank you,
[38:38] Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of all the
[38:43] glory and all the honor and all the
[38:50] praise. Oh, it makes me want to

[39:12] [Music]
[39:15] Oh yes. When I think about the
[39:21] Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me,
[39:28] how he filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[39:34] how he healed me to the uttermost.
[39:39] When I think about the Lord, has he been

[40:44] praise. Amen. Sister Lisa is going to
[40:46] come and bless us with a special this
[40:48] morning. Let's just think sing that
[40:50] again as she comes. It makes me want to
[40:54] shout a
[40:57] hallelu. Thank you,
[41:00] Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of all the
[41:05] glory and all the honor and all the

[43:21] to see what he will do.
[43:27] because he cares about your

[46:09] Amen. We serve a God of the impossible.
[46:12] I remember the Glennster Sherry going to
[46:14] come this morning. As they come, let's
[46:15] sing. What a day that will be. My Jesus
[46:18] I shall see. What a
[46:21] day that will
[46:24] be. When my
[46:26] Jesus I shall see.
[46:30] And I
[46:31] look upon his face. The one who saved me
[46:37] by his grace. When he takes me by the
[46:44] hand and leads me through the promised
[46:49] land. What a day, a glorious
[46:54] day that will be.
[47:00] Well, good morning everyone. God bless
[47:02] each and every one of you. Uh, let me
[47:05] tell you, Sister Lisa, as soon as my
[47:08] nephew gets a sound man for his studio,
[47:11] we'll have an album by her with all of
[47:13] her songs. That's a promise. All right.
[47:19] [Music]
[47:27] She was 12 years old. The Bible said
[47:33] when life just up and gave
[47:37] her
[47:42] away. In the hands of death she reached
[47:47] for life. Her mother wept. Her father
[47:52] cried, "She's
[47:54] [Music]
[47:58] dead." Jesus wrote a different
[48:03] story, another chance for God to receive
[48:08] glory.
[48:13] He woke her up and took her hand,
[48:17] restored to her life
[48:21] again. And this is all they heard the
[48:26] young girl say.
[48:29] [Music]
[48:31] Come and
[48:33] see what Jesus did when who I
[48:39] was met who he is.
[48:43] [Music]
[48:44] Come, come and
[48:48] behold. So you'll believe.
[48:53] Don't take my word.
[48:58] Just come and see.
[49:01] [Music]
[49:05] Slow
[49:11] down. Once again, death came for
[49:17] life and left behind a trail of broken
[49:22] tears.
[49:27] Sickness came to Lazarus life. An empty
[49:33] tomb. His body soon would
[49:39] fill. So Jesus came and Jesus wept. They
[49:46] said, "Come and see our brother in the
[49:50] grave."
[49:52] [Music]
[49:54] A stone was rolled. A prayer was prayed.
[49:59] Come forth rang out. Death ran away.
[50:04] Belief was born as faith stood to say.
[50:11] [Music]
[50:12] Come and
[50:15] see what Jesus did.
[50:21] When who I
[50:24] was meant who he is.
[50:30] Come and
[50:33] behold. So you believe.
[50:39] Don't take my
[50:42] word. Just come and
[50:47] see. Come and
[50:51] see what Jesus
[50:56] did. When who I
[51:00] was meant who he is.
[51:06] Come and
[51:09] behold so you'll
[51:13] believe. Don't take my
[51:18] word. Just come and
[51:22] see. Don't take my
[51:27] word. Just come and see.
[51:34] [Applause]
[51:45] Amen. Thank you, brother Glenn, sister
[51:47] Sherry. Amen. Who's ready for the word
[51:49] this morning? Amen. Let's stand and
[51:51] we're going to invite Brother Joe.
[51:53] Remember, Brother Joe is no stranger to
[51:54] us. So, let's just pull on the gift this
[51:56] morning. Amen. See what the Lord has for
[51:58] us. And as he comes, let's sing I'm
[51:59] sheltered in the arms of God this
[52:01] morning.
[52:03] So let the storms rage high. The dark
[52:09] clouds rise. They don't worry
[52:14] me for I'm sheltered safe within the
[52:21] arms of God.
[52:25] and he walks with
[52:29] me and not of earth can harm
[52:34] [Music]
[52:35] me. Oh, for I'm
[52:40] sheltered in the arms of God.
[52:47] I feel the
[52:50] touch of hands so kind and
[52:57] tender. They're leading
[53:01] me in paths that I must trust.
[53:08] And I'll have no
[53:12] fear for Jesus walks beside
[53:17] [Music]
[53:19] me. For I'm
[53:23] sheltered in the arms of
[53:29] God. And so let the storms rage high,
[53:35] the dark clouds rise.
[53:38] Bless you. Good to see you. Bless
[53:41] you. For I'm
[53:45] sheltered in the arms of God.
[53:53] walks with
[53:55] me in
[53:58] [Music]
[54:02] love. For I'm
[54:06] sheltered in the arms of
[54:11] God. Aren't you thankful this morning?
[54:13] That's where you're sheltered.
[54:16] Amen. No greater place. The Bible says
[54:18] he will be a a strong tower that the
[54:20] righteous can run to and and they're
[54:23] safe. They're sheltered in his loving
[54:24] arms this morning. So, we bring
[54:26] greetings to you today. Brother Tim, our
[54:28] pastor, and the saints there at Evening
[54:30] Light send their greetings. And just
[54:32] want to say thank you to brother Thomas
[54:33] for having us to come back. As
[54:37] uh as brother Josh said, we're no
[54:39] stranger. So, we're glad to be here.
[54:41] This is kind of like our home away from
[54:43] home. I was telling Brad, I preach here
[54:44] probably more than I preach at the home
[54:46] church. So, praise the Lord. We're glad.
[54:48] We're glad to be here with you this
[54:49] morning. We want to turn to the We'll
[54:51] turn to him and have a word of prayer
[54:52] and kind of get into this thought this
[54:54] morning. We do have uh two services
[54:57] today. And obviously, you know that more
[54:59] than I do. This is your church. But we
[55:01] just want to take a thought. We kind of
[55:02] pick back up on where we had been
[55:04] preaching the last couple services for
[55:05] you and just kind of continue this line
[55:08] of thinking this morning. So, Father, we
[55:09] just bow our hearts and our heads to
[55:11] you. Thank you Lord for the opportunity
[55:13] you give us to worship you to come today
[55:15] Lord and Lord give reverence and honor
[55:18] to you and we ask that your word would
[55:20] just be made manifest God quicken it to
[55:22] our hearts our lives Lord may it be more
[55:25] than just a formality may it be more
[55:27] than just agreeing with the words on a
[55:29] page but God we're asking that the words
[55:31] will come off the page of the Bible the
[55:33] Lord to come off the tapes that we
[55:34] listen to Lord and the word be made
[55:36] flesh in this hour God you would tell us
[55:38] that we're written epistles read above
[55:41] by all men. And we're just asking, Lord,
[55:43] that our lives will tell the story,
[55:44] Lord, that we're no longer sinners.
[55:46] We're no longer slaves, Lord, but we're
[55:48] sons of God. We're daughters of God,
[55:50] Lord. We've been redeemed by the blood.
[55:52] And so, we're asking for that blood to
[55:54] come, Lord, and be in effect today on
[55:56] our behalf. We just commit this service
[55:58] to you. We ask that you'll bless the
[55:59] giving of the word and the receiving of
[56:01] it, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. If you
[56:04] have your Bibles this morning, we're
[56:05] going to look here. I'm going to look in
[56:06] a couple places. So we'll look in
[56:08] Ephesians 1 3-1 11, Luke 24:49, Romans
[56:13] 8:10-11, and then we'll have you be
[56:15] seated.
[56:16] So Ephesians 1 and verse three, blessed
[56:19] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[56:21] Christ who has blessed us with all
[56:23] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[56:26] according as notice now according as he
[56:28] has chosen us in him before the
[56:30] foundation of the world that we should
[56:32] be holy without blame before him in love
[56:35] having predestinated us unto the
[56:37] adoption of children that means placing
[56:39] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[56:42] according to the good pleasure of his
[56:43] will to the praise of the glory of his
[56:46] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[56:48] in the beloved, in whom we have
[56:50] redemption through his blood, and
[56:51] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[56:54] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[56:56] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[56:58] prudence, having made known unto us the
[57:00] mystery of his will, according to his
[57:02] good pleasure, which he has purposed in
[57:04] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[57:06] fullness of times, he might gather
[57:08] together in one all things in Christ,
[57:11] both which are in heaven and which are
[57:13] on earth, even in him in whom also we
[57:16] have attained an inheritance, being
[57:18] predestinated according to the purpose
[57:20] of him who worked at all things after
[57:22] his counsel of his will. Luke 24 and
[57:24] verse 49. If you'll turn there,
[57:32] Amen. You glad to be in the house of the
[57:34] Lord this morning?
[57:36] All right, we'll take some head nodding.
[57:38] That's okay. We'll warm you up this
[57:41] morning. Luke 24:49. And behold, I send
[57:45] the promise of my father upon you, but
[57:47] tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until
[57:50] you have been endued with power from on
[57:53] high. Remember, there's a promise of
[57:54] power. Jesus is letting his disciples
[57:56] know where to go to receive this power.
[57:59] And it's expected. Don't just go, but go
[58:01] with an expectation that when you come
[58:04] into this place, I'm telling you, he's
[58:06] given you the forewarning that I'm going
[58:08] to fill you with power. I'm going to
[58:10] give you this power that you seek. Now,
[58:12] let's go to Romans 8 and verse 10.
[58:15] Romans 8 and verse 10 and we'll look at
[58:17] 10 and 11. And if Christ be in you, so
[58:22] here's the key, church, this morning is
[58:24] that Christ has to be in you. Not an
[58:28] idea, not a doctrine, not a dogma, not a
[58:32] creed, but Christ. If Christ be in you,
[58:36] then the body is dead because of sin.
[58:40] But the spirit is life. And that word
[58:42] there, spirit is life, is Zoe. That
[58:44] means God's own life because of
[58:46] righteousness. But if the spirit of him
[58:48] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[58:51] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[58:54] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[58:57] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[59:01] you. God bless you. You can have your
[59:03] seats this morning.
[59:12] just put that there. So, I want to kind
[59:14] of come back and I want to take my time
[59:15] this morning. I want to speak to you
[59:16] again on power restored to the church,
[59:19] but we'll give it a subtitle this
[59:20] morning on
[59:22] predestinated for quickening power or
[59:24] predestinated to quickening power. And
[59:27] we find here in our reading in
[59:29] Ephesians, we hear this word
[59:30] predestinated mentioned several times.
[59:32] Several times. And we understand that
[59:34] brother Brown would talk about
[59:35] predestination and he, you know, he
[59:37] talked about us being in the thoughts of
[59:39] God before the foundation of the world.
[59:40] And the thoughts of God, they are
[59:42] eternal. And so if God already had a
[59:44] thought of you, then no matter what you
[59:46] go through on this side of eternity,
[59:48] you're going to make sure God's going to
[59:49] make sure that you fit the thought that
[59:51] he had in his mind. But we look here in
[59:53] Romans 10, and we we've been told in
[59:56] Luke 24, there's a promise of power
[59:58] coming. And and in in Romans 8, we find
[1:00:01] here that if Christ be in us, the spirit
[1:00:04] of God be in us, the Zoey life of God be
[1:00:07] in us, and if that spirit that's in us,
[1:00:09] if it raised up Christ from the dead,
[1:00:12] then it's also going to quicken these
[1:00:14] mortal bodies.
[1:00:16] We look here at this word quicken here.
[1:00:18] The word quicken here means to cause to
[1:00:20] live. You may have come in here this
[1:00:22] morning dead. You may be trapped in sin.
[1:00:25] You may be living a life of unbelief.
[1:00:28] You may be a sinner. You can be in drugs
[1:00:30] and alcohol. No matter what it is. But
[1:00:32] if Christ can come in you today, then he
[1:00:35] can quicken this life. He can make it
[1:00:37] alive. He can give you life. It's a
[1:00:40] spiritual power to arouse, to
[1:00:42] invigorate, to restore to life. Let me
[1:00:45] tell you, all of us had one time lived a
[1:00:48] life outside of the indwelling of the
[1:00:50] spirit. And I want you to understand
[1:00:52] this morning, church. It's got to be
[1:00:54] more just them proclaiming, I believe
[1:00:56] God sent a prophet. It's got to be more
[1:00:59] than just I believe there's a message
[1:01:01] been been sent in this hour. We're
[1:01:03] speaking about Jesus Christ, the token
[1:01:06] life becoming in flesh this morning,
[1:01:09] living inside of somebody. the power of
[1:01:12] God to quicken your life, to transform
[1:01:15] your being, to make you from a sinner to
[1:01:17] a son of God, the way God had originally
[1:01:20] planned you to be. It takes an
[1:01:22] overcoming power. It's not mind over
[1:01:24] matter. It's not going to so and so's
[1:01:26] church. It's not believing in God sent a
[1:01:29] prophet. It's being quickened by the
[1:01:31] Holy Ghost. And I want you to understand
[1:01:34] me this morning. I want it to be more
[1:01:36] than a mental conception. You may be a
[1:01:38] good person. You may be a good
[1:01:40] Christian. I'm not talking about being a
[1:01:42] moral morally good person. I'm talking
[1:01:44] about know that you've been quickened by
[1:01:47] the power of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:51] Quickening power. We're
[1:01:53] predestinated to quickening power.
[1:01:58] Today we find there's a lot of good
[1:02:00] kids. And I'm kind of getting ahead of
[1:02:01] myself, but we're going to preach by
[1:02:02] inspiration. You got a lot of good kids
[1:02:04] go to a lot of great camps. They go into
[1:02:07] that camp and they come out of that camp
[1:02:08] the same way they went in.
[1:02:11] Well, mom and dad's a deacon. Mom, well,
[1:02:13] not mom. Hope God, hope
[1:02:15] not. We got some real problems in the
[1:02:17] churches. Then, dad's a deacon. Dad's a
[1:02:20] minister. This one's that. Mama's us
[1:02:22] singing. And we got all this. And you
[1:02:24] know, our whole
[1:02:25] religious idea and our whole religious
[1:02:28] identity is because of what who we where
[1:02:30] we go to church or, you know, what we
[1:02:32] believe or who our parents are.
[1:02:34] But what about that quickening power
[1:02:37] becoming a personal quickening power?
[1:02:40] Talking about take it off a mama, take
[1:02:42] it off a pastor, take it off of uncle,
[1:02:44] take it off a church, take it off a
[1:02:46] location, and place it in your heart, in
[1:02:49] your soul that you know that you know
[1:02:52] that you know that your life has been
[1:02:55] transformed. The things that you used to
[1:02:57] do, the desires that you used to have,
[1:03:00] you don't do anymore, you don't desire
[1:03:02] anymore. that only caused by the
[1:03:04] indwelling of the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:06] Ghost. It only comes by quickening
[1:03:08] power.
[1:03:12] Well, I go to brother Thomas's church.
[1:03:13] That's great. But that quickening power
[1:03:15] ain't there. You're going to hell.
[1:03:17] Or better yet, I would just say it like
[1:03:19] this. That quickening power is not
[1:03:20] there. You will go through a
[1:03:22] tribulation.
[1:03:24] I'm not going to say you're going to
[1:03:25] hell. That's between you and God. But I
[1:03:27] will tell you, he's only going to
[1:03:29] rapture those that have been quickened.
[1:03:34] This is flat, but I'm trying to spare
[1:03:36] you some heartache.
[1:03:38] So, we look
[1:03:40] here. God will only quicken, brother
[1:03:43] Brad, what he has redeemed.
[1:03:46] And God will only redeem that which he
[1:03:49] intends to quicken.
[1:03:52] Oh,
[1:03:54] hallelujah. For some of y'all that know
[1:03:56] that you've been quickened by the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost, that should make you shout this
[1:03:59] morning. That should make you rejoice
[1:04:01] this morning. That declares to you this
[1:04:03] morning, I can't be lost. I won't be
[1:04:06] lost cuz I've been redeemed by the
[1:04:09] blood. And I if I've been redeemed, that
[1:04:11] means I've been quickened. And he's only
[1:04:13] going to quicken that which he plans to
[1:04:16] redeem.
[1:04:18] That means you can't miss a rapture.
[1:04:20] That means you won't miss the rapture.
[1:04:24] But he would tell us in end time
[1:04:25] evangelism. And I listened to this
[1:04:26] sermon on the way up this this week. And
[1:04:28] he says, "Remember now my message
[1:04:30] recently on the bride." And if you
[1:04:32] haven't listened to the restoration of
[1:04:34] the bride tree, I would encourage you to
[1:04:35] go listen to that. And he says, "Now see
[1:04:39] how that he took Jesus. He was a tree.
[1:04:42] The one that David saw a tree planted by
[1:04:44] the rivers of water. His fruit and seed,
[1:04:47] the most perfect
[1:04:48] tree. And they cut him down. They hung
[1:04:50] him on a man-made Roman tree for
[1:04:52] mockery. But what did he do? He rose up
[1:04:55] again on the third day. And the prophet
[1:04:57] says, "What else did he do?" He set
[1:04:59] forth a bride tree. So it wasn't so much
[1:05:03] that he was just coming to be a tree
[1:05:05] that's going to be set by the rivers of
[1:05:07] water and going to produce its own
[1:05:08] fruit. But he was looking for a bride
[1:05:12] tree. He's looking for a people, a
[1:05:15] church, a tree that would bring forth
[1:05:16] fruit through every age. But in the
[1:05:19] finality of all the ages, it will be a
[1:05:22] time that that fruit will be plucked.
[1:05:24] That fruit will be picked and that fruit
[1:05:26] will be quickened and caught up with
[1:05:27] him. And we find, he says, what else did
[1:05:29] he do? He set forth the bride tree, a
[1:05:32] man and a woman, like the trees that was
[1:05:34] in the Garden of Eden. Two trees. One of
[1:05:36] them was a tree of life. One was a tree
[1:05:38] of death. And what did he do? He come to
[1:05:40] redeem this tree. You see, since he
[1:05:43] redeemed it at Calvary, he's ready to
[1:05:46] plant her now to restore his bride tree.
[1:05:49] The one that should have been in Eden,
[1:05:51] but she fell there because she
[1:05:52] disbelieved the word. But oh, here he's
[1:05:55] going to restore a tree that will
[1:05:58] believe the word. I say, "Mama, that's
[1:06:02] me this morning. I believe the word. I
[1:06:05] believe the message. I believe the
[1:06:08] prophet. I believe the scriptures. I
[1:06:11] believe Malachi 4. I believe Luke 17:30.
[1:06:15] I believe Revelations 10. My I believe
[1:06:17] it pertains to me this morning. I am
[1:06:20] that bride tree.
[1:06:24] And when she come up, listen what he
[1:06:26] said. Now when she come up on the day of
[1:06:27] Pentecost, that original doctrine, that
[1:06:30] original faith, then what did Rome begin
[1:06:32] to do? send the cankerorm, the polymer
[1:06:36] worm. Each one of them took its part of
[1:06:37] the fruit off the fruit, the leaves, and
[1:06:39] everything. Sucked it all down. Oh, but
[1:06:42] a prophet said, "I will restore."
[1:06:47] Look around, church. I'm talking about
[1:06:49] the restoration.
[1:06:50] Talking about the restoration. Why
[1:06:52] aren't these pews full? Because it ain't
[1:06:54] for everybody. It's only for those that
[1:06:55] have been quickened. Only for those
[1:06:57] that'll be redeemed. And I trust there's
[1:07:00] more out there around this area that's
[1:07:01] going to come to the revelation of who
[1:07:03] they are. But we find here God to give a
[1:07:05] promise. I will restore sayeth the Lord.
[1:07:08] She started back in the reformation.
[1:07:10] What did she do? She organized and God
[1:07:12] pruned her right in St. John 14. Cut all
[1:07:15] the organization off of it and she came
[1:07:17] to Wesley and she organized and God
[1:07:19] pruned it off. See, God is speaking of
[1:07:22] his fruit tree that he had planted. God
[1:07:24] planted a fruit tree. He planted on the
[1:07:27] day of Pentecost and he brought that
[1:07:29] tree there for a purpose. He wanted it
[1:07:31] to bear his fruit word. God's word. He
[1:07:34] wanted a church that would keep his word
[1:07:36] all down through the age. Eve had failed
[1:07:38] to keep it. The Jews had failed to keep
[1:07:40] it. The law had failed and it fell. So
[1:07:43] God planted him a tree. I'm here to tell
[1:07:45] you church that this bride though that
[1:07:48] first Eve failed to keep the word. But
[1:07:50] this bride, this end time bride tree,
[1:07:53] she will not fail to keep the promises
[1:07:55] of
[1:07:57] God. God has determined I'm going to
[1:08:00] restore a church. He's not going to
[1:08:02] restore on some man concept. He's not
[1:08:04] going to restore some man-made creed,
[1:08:06] but he's going to restore a church on
[1:08:08] the word of God.
[1:08:12] I will restore. And he says, "She is
[1:08:16] still coming."
[1:08:19] For who? So, as many as the Lord our God
[1:08:22] should call,
[1:08:24] you can be eight this morning. You can
[1:08:26] be 80 this morning. Whosoever the Lord
[1:08:29] our God shall call.
[1:08:31] He says in the evening time there will
[1:08:34] not be an organization but there will be
[1:08:36] a church. There will be say where does
[1:08:38] the fruit ripen at in the top. Why? The
[1:08:41] sun hits it. In the evening time the
[1:08:43] seeds are planted now for an evening
[1:08:45] time
[1:08:47] bride. Oh my. An evening time
[1:08:51] bride. And in the evening time the seeds
[1:08:54] are planted now for an evening time
[1:08:56] bride. When the tree of life, notice the
[1:08:58] tree of life is Jesus Christ. He was one
[1:09:01] that was in the garden. And he says,
[1:09:03] when the tree of life returns back to
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:07] bride, what is he meaning there? It
[1:09:09] means when that tree of life that was in
[1:09:11] the garden now comes back inside that
[1:09:14] bride tree otherwise quickens that bride
[1:09:17] tree gives her the same life that was in
[1:09:20] the garden is now the same life that's
[1:09:23] permeating a people living in a
[1:09:25] manifesting in a people. That's what
[1:09:28] he's waiting for. That's what he's
[1:09:30] longing for. He's longing for the
[1:09:32] display of that life to be in the
[1:09:34] display of this life.
[1:09:37] more than just being a one-man ministry.
[1:09:39] He's looking for a multimember body
[1:09:41] ministry.
[1:09:44] Oh, hallelujah. So, the evening time
[1:09:46] evangelism, listen what he says, will be
[1:09:49] the mark of Malachi 4 to restore the
[1:09:52] faith of the people back to the faith of
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:56] fathers. See, that's the baptism of the
[1:09:58] Holy Ghost that baptizes us into the
[1:10:00] body that recognize only his body, his
[1:10:02] flesh, his word. Denominations won't
[1:10:04] ever touch that. It's a revelation. and
[1:10:06] she knows it. So he says, "So did Eve
[1:10:08] know it, but she fell, but this one
[1:10:12] knows it and won't fail."
[1:10:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:17] No matter how bad it gets, no matter how
[1:10:19] low you get, no matter how dark it gets,
[1:10:22] this one won't fail. Somebody should say
[1:10:25] amen to that. This bride, me, I'm a part
[1:10:29] of this bride. I'm a part of that bride
[1:10:31] tree. I can't fail. I won't fail. Listen
[1:10:34] what the prophet of God says. She's
[1:10:36] ordained. Hallelujah. Woo. She is
[1:10:38] ordained not to fall. She won't fail.
[1:10:41] She is predestinated to it. What am I
[1:10:44] speaking about this morning?
[1:10:46] Predestinated to quickening power. It
[1:10:49] means you can't fail. You can't miss the
[1:10:52] quickening power. If you ever was in the
[1:10:54] mind of God, if you ever was in the
[1:10:56] thoughts of God, God is determined. He's
[1:10:59] going to quicken that seed and bring
[1:11:01] that seed to manifestation.
[1:11:04] So, mama, daddy, quit worrying about
[1:11:06] your child.
[1:11:08] Quit worrying about your children. Place
[1:11:10] them in the loving hands of Almighty God
[1:11:12] and trust that they were seed. Before
[1:11:14] there was ever seed in your womb, they
[1:11:16] were seeds in the mind of God. Before
[1:11:18] they ever came to manifestation on this
[1:11:20] earth, they took their first breath in
[1:11:22] the mind of God. God saw everything that
[1:11:24] they would be. And God sent a word and
[1:11:26] God placed them in your care. Because
[1:11:28] why? God knew there would come a time.
[1:11:30] God knew there would come a service. God
[1:11:32] knew there would come a time where the
[1:11:34] quickening power of the Holy Ghost would
[1:11:36] capture that seed and bring that seed to
[1:11:39] life and quicken that seed to eternal
[1:11:42] life.
[1:11:47] As a parent, you want to do for your
[1:11:50] kids, right?
[1:11:52] You want them to have this. And the sad
[1:11:55] part is it's not ours to
[1:11:57] give. But you have to you have to look
[1:12:01] beyond the
[1:12:03] failures. You have to look beyond their
[1:12:05] mistakes. You have to look beyond what
[1:12:08] you see with the outward appearance. And
[1:12:10] you have to trust that there's a seed on
[1:12:13] the inside.
[1:12:16] I love how the prophet of God would say
[1:12:17] that a son of God can go a long time
[1:12:22] before he ever recognizes he's a son.
[1:12:27] Oh, now back to eternal life. I love
[1:12:30] what he says, redeeming back with him,
[1:12:33] going home. Notice redeeming back.
[1:12:36] Otherwise, to redeem means to
[1:12:39] reclaim. God's reclaiming a bride. You
[1:12:43] know, Satan would tell you, "Well, you
[1:12:44] always belong to me. You always had my
[1:12:47] desires, and you wanted the world and
[1:12:49] the things of the world, and you
[1:12:50] gravitated to this and gravitated to
[1:12:51] that." But God said, "I'm redeeming back
[1:12:54] my bride. I'm reclaiming my bride." How
[1:12:57] does he do that? By one spirit, we are
[1:12:59] saved. By one spirit, we are quickened.
[1:13:02] And it takes the quickening power of God
[1:13:04] to take a life that seems to be
[1:13:06] minuscule, that seems to be wasted in
[1:13:09] the world. And God can take that life
[1:13:11] and so quicken it and so fill it and so
[1:13:14] turn their desires and completely
[1:13:16] revolutionize their nature to the things
[1:13:18] that they used to do, they despise to do
[1:13:21] them anymore. And that's what it takes,
[1:13:23] church. It takes the quickening power,
[1:13:27] not of your favorite preacher, but the
[1:13:29] quickening power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:33] What is it? The bride is going back with
[1:13:36] him, redeemed back to the original Adam
[1:13:38] and Eve again. for debt is left behind.
[1:13:40] They look back at the cross and see the
[1:13:42] debt has been paid. He said, "Now this
[1:13:45] is in Christ the mystery of God
[1:13:46] revealed." Now by faith we are
[1:13:48] resurrected with him, sitting in
[1:13:49] heavenly places right now, looking back
[1:13:52] to what redeemed us. Waiting for the
[1:13:54] husband to come to march home with him.
[1:13:58] And I hope that's what you're waiting
[1:13:59] for. I hope that's what you're looking
[1:14:01] for. The husband to come and to snatch
[1:14:04] away his bride.
[1:14:07] You know, I remember the day I got
[1:14:08] married, Brother Brad. It's been 23
[1:14:10] years ago, but I'll never forget it.
[1:14:12] Brother Tommy, I stood there with the
[1:14:14] pastor. All everybody's eyes was on me.
[1:14:17] I'm like, "Yeah, I was loving it, just
[1:14:20] smiling." Well, when those doors opened
[1:14:22] up and my eyes fell on my
[1:14:26] bride, my my
[1:14:28] my moment I had been waiting for all my
[1:14:32] life. come walking step after step after
[1:14:38] step arrayed in fine linen, clean and
[1:14:42] white,
[1:14:43] pure. And I had the honor and the
[1:14:46] privilege of taking her from out from
[1:14:50] the headship of her father and bringing
[1:14:51] her under my headship. See, God is
[1:14:54] longing for that day when those doors
[1:14:56] are going to open and this bride stands
[1:14:58] before him clean and white, pure.
[1:15:02] Oh, we know we've done the things that
[1:15:04] we've done, right? We're we're of that.
[1:15:06] But there's a blood that's been washed
[1:15:08] over the people. And red through red
[1:15:11] makes white. Now she's clean. Now she's
[1:15:14] spotless. Now she's without wrinkle. Now
[1:15:16] she's without blemish. And he's longing,
[1:15:19] church. He's longing for them doors to
[1:15:21] open and that eastern sky to split. And
[1:15:24] he come and take away his bride. the
[1:15:27] bridegroom, the husband coming to take
[1:15:29] away the bride tree to quicken her not
[1:15:32] only in their spirit, but now to quicken
[1:15:35] her body. This old pest house of sin,
[1:15:38] this old this old the deliberating or
[1:15:41] debilitating body of ours and gets sick
[1:15:44] and and begins to wake up and hurt. The
[1:15:46] older you get, the more decrepit it
[1:15:47] gets. But one day, we're going to step
[1:15:49] outside of this mortality and we're
[1:15:51] going to put on immortal life. We're
[1:15:53] going to put on a new body, a heavenly
[1:15:55] body. The body that we came by, that we
[1:15:58] passed over, is called a theophony body,
[1:16:00] church. We're going back to that body.
[1:16:02] Let me tell you, there ain't enough
[1:16:03] devils in hell going to keep us from
[1:16:05] going back to that body. Why? Cuz
[1:16:07] quickening power has come in this age to
[1:16:10] quicken a people and bring them back to
[1:16:12] the mind of God to put them back in
[1:16:14] heavenly
[1:16:17] places. He says, "And you are
[1:16:19] quickened." And this quickening power
[1:16:21] brings your body into a rapture
[1:16:24] condition
[1:16:25] already. See, notice the Pentecostal
[1:16:28] people up there when they got quickened
[1:16:29] by the Holy Spirit. Now, don't be
[1:16:31] afraid. Now, I know we're several
[1:16:34] hundred years past
[1:16:35] Pentecost and you know, and and in the
[1:16:38] message ranks, we were afraid of
[1:16:40] Pentecost. Pentecosta, we were so
[1:16:43] worried about the emotionalism and
[1:16:45] everybody just having emotion and
[1:16:46] emotion emotion. Let me say, but if your
[1:16:49] if your doctrine is based on this, if
[1:16:52] your emotion is backed up by the word of
[1:16:54] God, you can shout. Come on. If if it's
[1:16:57] backed up by the word of God, you can
[1:16:58] dance. If that emotion, when that
[1:17:00] revelation strikes your heart and and
[1:17:02] you want to run around the church, you
[1:17:03] can do it. Why? Because it ain't just
[1:17:05] mere emotion. It ain't just excitement.
[1:17:08] It ain't just a euphoria and being
[1:17:09] captivated in a service. No, it's based
[1:17:12] on the word of God. When you find
[1:17:14] yourself in the word of God and God
[1:17:17] quickens a promise to you, God quickens
[1:17:19] the word to you. God fills you with the
[1:17:21] Holy Gh, you may shout, you may jump,
[1:17:24] you may dance, but make sure that it's
[1:17:27] based on the word of God. It ain't based
[1:17:29] on some sense of emotion. It ain't based
[1:17:31] on some man's idea and everybody hooping
[1:17:34] and jumping, but it's based on
[1:17:35] quickening power and quicken your soul
[1:17:38] from unbelief to believing.
[1:17:42] I say God quicken us this morning.
[1:17:44] Quicken us to the reality that we are
[1:17:46] that bride tree.
[1:17:50] He says, "Then you are
[1:17:52] quickened." And this quickening
[1:17:55] power, listen to me, young
[1:17:57] people, this quickening power brings
[1:18:01] your body into a raptured
[1:18:04] condition. Notice the Pentecostal people
[1:18:06] up there when they got quickened, he's
[1:18:08] talking about the day of Pentecost by
[1:18:09] the Holy Spirit. When those Pentecostal
[1:18:11] group up there on the day of Pentecost
[1:18:13] received their abstract deed from God,
[1:18:15] sure it glorified their souls. That's
[1:18:19] what it is. This quickening power that
[1:18:20] I'm speaking of, it glorifies the soul.
[1:18:23] It changes the soul. And we understand
[1:18:26] there is going to be another quickening
[1:18:28] that's going to change his body. But
[1:18:31] until then, allow the spirit to quicken
[1:18:33] the soul to change your soul. Notice it
[1:18:36] glorified their soul. They
[1:18:38] screamed. So, it's okay to scream.
[1:18:42] Well, we got to have special meetings.
[1:18:45] We got we got to let me just let me just
[1:18:47] walk back here for a minute. We got to
[1:18:49] have special meetings and we got to have
[1:18:51] dynamic preachers and we got to have
[1:18:53] this and we got to have that. We ain't
[1:18:55] got to have that to raise this.
[1:18:58] No, sir. No. No. You should expect
[1:19:01] quickening power every service. It
[1:19:03] doesn't matter who's preaching. It
[1:19:04] doesn't matter what they're preaching.
[1:19:06] If they're preaching the word of God,
[1:19:08] you should be able to raise that banner
[1:19:09] and say, "I'll be quickened. I'm under
[1:19:12] expectation for quickening power, for
[1:19:14] the anointing of the Holy
[1:19:17] Ghost." So what if it ain't your
[1:19:19] favorite preacher? It don't matter. You
[1:19:21] can still receive because he should be
[1:19:24] your favorite preacher.
[1:19:28] I'm just going to put this here because
[1:19:29] I may wave it throughout this service.
[1:19:32] They quicken their body to a heavenly
[1:19:34] language.
[1:19:37] the place that they were
[1:19:39] going.
[1:19:41] Oh, you ain't going to be speaking
[1:19:43] English in heaven. It's another
[1:19:46] language. We should start practicing
[1:19:48] that language
[1:19:49] here. You're like, "What do you mean,
[1:19:53] bro?" I mean, allow yourself to get
[1:19:57] captivated by the
[1:19:58] spirit. Even when there's church is half
[1:20:01] full. We think we can't have powerful
[1:20:04] services when the pews are not filled.
[1:20:06] You can have a powerful service with two
[1:20:08] or three. That's right.
[1:20:11] I was at a church last week in
[1:20:13] Minneapolis. We had 20 people in the
[1:20:16] service. But we had church.
[1:20:19] 20 people. But we had church. What am I
[1:20:21] telling you? It ain't dependent on
[1:20:23] numbers, church. It's about what is your
[1:20:25] expectation.
[1:20:27] See, it quickened their body to a
[1:20:28] heavenly language. the place that they
[1:20:30] were going. Quickening power. God shook
[1:20:32] their mortal bodies till their entire
[1:20:34] mortal language was transfigured,
[1:20:36] transformed into an immortal language.
[1:20:39] What a quickening power.
[1:20:43] Well, you know, if if brother Brad would
[1:20:46] just really let go, then we can have
[1:20:47] quickening
[1:20:48] power. No. What about you let go?
[1:20:53] Let me just ask you. If I came up here
[1:20:55] this morning and I didn't study all
[1:20:57] week, I hadn't made any preparations, I
[1:20:59] didn't have any notes, and I'm just
[1:21:01] winging it. Boy, you just love that kind
[1:21:04] of preaching, wouldn't you? Look at him.
[1:21:06] He's the winged preacher. Fall flat on
[1:21:09] his face. I mean, fumbling over words,
[1:21:12] no talk, no thought, just running here,
[1:21:14] squirrel here, and squirrel there, and
[1:21:15] he's out on a limb here. No consistency
[1:21:17] in the thought. You think, man, why in
[1:21:19] the world did Brother Thomas invite him,
[1:21:23] you know? But I pray and I study and I
[1:21:25] seek the leadership of God and you know
[1:21:27] you wouldn't want that in a preacher now
[1:21:29] would you? Come on church class
[1:21:32] participation. It's okay this morning.
[1:21:34] Can I get an amen? But when that
[1:21:37] preacher has studied and he is and he
[1:21:39] has sought God and he has prayed and he
[1:21:41] he has been in the word and he comes
[1:21:43] here and begins to pour out his heart to
[1:21:45] try to get the people to see the
[1:21:46] revelation and you sit there.
[1:21:50] You hadn't made any preparation. You
[1:21:51] hadn't prayed. You hadn't prayed for the
[1:21:53] service. You didn't come with any kind
[1:21:54] of expectation. Oh, but you don't want
[1:21:57] the preacher to get say anything about
[1:21:59] it because why? Oh, the shoes on the
[1:22:01] other foot. But let me tell you, if the
[1:22:02] preaching should be expected to prepare,
[1:22:04] what about the members of the church?
[1:22:06] Shouldn't we be expected to prepare? We
[1:22:09] should come to every service waiting and
[1:22:11] anticipating and looking for quickening
[1:22:14] power to come and change our heart. You
[1:22:17] may not be in need, but your brother and
[1:22:19] sister may be in need. They may need
[1:22:21] your prayer. They may need you to create
[1:22:24] an atmosphere that the Holy Ghost can
[1:22:26] drop down and seal that predestinated
[1:22:28] seed.
[1:22:30] Amen. Notice he said, "If the spirit
[1:22:33] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:22:34] in your mortal bodies, it shall also
[1:22:37] quicken your mortal bodies." We are
[1:22:39] quickened then by the power of the
[1:22:42] living God. See, quickening power is
[1:22:45] God's own life manifesting in the
[1:22:48] believer. See, what does quickening
[1:22:50] power do? I ask you that. What does it
[1:22:52] do? It means that you can't live the way
[1:22:54] that you used to live.
[1:22:56] So, some of you, I'm not going to ask
[1:22:58] you that you know you got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:01] because everybody will put their hand
[1:23:03] up. Well, I know I got it. But if you're
[1:23:06] still doing the things you used to
[1:23:09] do, come on. Gut check, reality check.
[1:23:13] If you're still doing the things you
[1:23:14] used to do, you still have the desire to
[1:23:18] do the things you used to
[1:23:20] do, then you need to take that hand and
[1:23:23] you need to bring it down and you need
[1:23:24] to have a reality check, a conference
[1:23:26] with God.
[1:23:29] Oh, I'm glad that you want to raise your
[1:23:30] hand. I'm glad that you want to claim
[1:23:32] that. But I'm not talking about just
[1:23:33] proclaiming something. I'm talking about
[1:23:35] knowing that you've been quickened that
[1:23:37] that seed on the inside that your life
[1:23:39] has been do you understand that one day
[1:23:41] these bodies are about to be raptured
[1:23:42] out of here and if you don't know that
[1:23:44] you know that you know you're going to
[1:23:46] be left behind you going to be part of
[1:23:48] that series oh left behind series where
[1:23:50] you're going through a great tribulation
[1:23:52] and the wrath of God going to be poured
[1:23:53] out but God has promised a people in
[1:23:55] this hour God has sent a message in this
[1:23:57] hour to do what? To restore that bride
[1:23:59] tree to quicken that seg on the inside.
[1:24:02] You don't have to wonder. You don't have
[1:24:04] to probe. You don't have to question.
[1:24:06] You can have the assurance this morning.
[1:24:08] That quickening power is on the inside.
[1:24:11] And your nature's been changed. Your
[1:24:13] desires have been changed. Not what you
[1:24:15] used to be turned to to the world can be
[1:24:17] turned back to the word. The desires be
[1:24:19] turned heavenly.
[1:24:23] Church. But notice many believe that
[1:24:25] quickening power just means you believe
[1:24:26] God's in a
[1:24:27] message. Well, bless God. I go to
[1:24:29] brother Thomas's church. Well, bless
[1:24:32] God. Satan comes here every Sunday.
[1:24:36] Quickening powers means you believe
[1:24:37] God's in a profit. But see, quickening
[1:24:40] power quickens the soul to
[1:24:45] life. See, it quickens you much more
[1:24:47] than just believing the message or that
[1:24:50] God sent a prophet. It quickens you to
[1:24:54] being much more than being a a good
[1:24:57] person. Much more than just being a
[1:24:59] morally decent person.
[1:25:03] Come on, church. Quickening power turns
[1:25:06] your heart back to the faith of the
[1:25:08] fathers.
[1:25:10] See, your nature's been changed. Your
[1:25:12] desires have been changed. The things
[1:25:13] that you used to do, you don't do them
[1:25:15] no more because now your desires are
[1:25:18] different.
[1:25:20] Second Timothy 3 and verse one, this
[1:25:23] know that in the last days perilous
[1:25:26] times will come. Now that word perilous
[1:25:29] means hard to bear, troublesome,
[1:25:31] dangerous, harsh, fierce, savage. That's
[1:25:33] today.
[1:25:35] I mean, you got to be blind, deaf, and
[1:25:36] dumb not realize we're living in
[1:25:37] perilous times. He says, "Men shall be
[1:25:40] lovers of their own selves, covetous,
[1:25:42] boasters, proud, blasphemer, disobedient
[1:25:44] to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
[1:25:46] natural affection, truth bakers, false
[1:25:49] accusers, incontinent, fierce, and
[1:25:51] despisers of the those that are good,
[1:25:54] traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[1:25:56] pleasure more than lovers of God."
[1:25:59] Talking about a woke generation.
[1:26:02] Lovers of pleasure
[1:26:05] more than lovers of God. They spend
[1:26:07] eight, nine, 10 hours playing video
[1:26:09] games. Can't hold down a job because
[1:26:12] they're too worried about
[1:26:14] missing their next video game, playing
[1:26:17] with their contender over somewhere else
[1:26:19] and trying to beat them. And yet their
[1:26:21] their their soul is shriveled up. Notice
[1:26:24] having a form of
[1:26:27] godliness. That word form there means
[1:26:29] semblance or appearance. having a form
[1:26:31] of godliness but denying the power
[1:26:35] thereof from such turn away. So I want
[1:26:37] to kind of break into verse five here
[1:26:38] and I want us to look at this because
[1:26:40] it's kind of a teaching preaching
[1:26:41] service this morning but having a form
[1:26:43] or a semblance of godliness but denying
[1:26:46] that word denying marriage is to
[1:26:48] disclaim to disown to renounce to
[1:26:51] decline to refuse. It's not just
[1:26:53] declining. No, I don't have time. But
[1:26:55] no, you you're adamantly opposed to it.
[1:26:58] You refuse it. You decline it. Notice
[1:27:01] the condition of the people of the end
[1:27:03] time. They have a form, a semblance of
[1:27:06] godliness, but they deny the quickening
[1:27:08] power, access to their soul, to quicken
[1:27:11] them, to change them. They disown it.
[1:27:13] They renounce it. They decline it. They
[1:27:15] refuse the power that was promised in
[1:27:18] Luke 24:49. No, they may look apart.
[1:27:21] They may look like a good man, a good
[1:27:23] woman, a good boy, a good girl. They may
[1:27:25] but but inside of the inside, they deny
[1:27:28] the access of the Holy Spirit that come
[1:27:30] down and completely change their life.
[1:27:32] They want to hold on to their fashion.
[1:27:34] They want to hold on to the things of
[1:27:36] the world. They want to hold on to their
[1:27:37] their worldly associates. But I'm
[1:27:39] talking about being transformed. I'm
[1:27:42] talking about being quickened by the
[1:27:43] power of God. Amen. Notice he
[1:27:48] said his word testifies in the last days
[1:27:51] there will come a falling away. There
[1:27:52] will come up a cold formal powerless
[1:27:56] church. That's what we're living in. A
[1:27:59] church that had no
[1:28:02] power having a form of godliness but
[1:28:05] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:28:07] away. When we deny the Holy Spirit
[1:28:10] access in our lives, access in our home,
[1:28:13] access in our churches, we will be a
[1:28:16] powerless
[1:28:17] people. And the prophet said, "If the
[1:28:21] church could identify and withstand the
[1:28:24] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:28:26] Christian
[1:28:29] church, Satan would be powerless."
[1:28:34] But we find today that it's not Satan
[1:28:37] that's powerless in many churches. It's
[1:28:39] the people that are powerless because
[1:28:41] the people's gotten cold. They got in
[1:28:43] formal. They gotten indifferent. You
[1:28:45] know, you may look like a Christian, may
[1:28:46] act like a Christian, may go through the
[1:28:47] motions, attend church, special
[1:28:49] meetings, dress right. But without the
[1:28:51] spirit to quicken that seed, you will
[1:28:54] turn
[1:28:56] cold. You will turn indifferent.
[1:29:00] You will be defeated by the
[1:29:04] enemy. And what you find is when you
[1:29:07] become cold and you become indifferent,
[1:29:09] you walk through those doors and you
[1:29:11] just go through the motions of being a
[1:29:13] Christian. I sit on my certain seat on a
[1:29:16] certain side of the church. I do a
[1:29:19] certain thing. I come in. I look right.
[1:29:21] I I do all the mechanical things,
[1:29:25] right? But it ain't about the mechanical
[1:29:27] things. It's not about you fulfilling
[1:29:30] some church responsibility or some
[1:29:32] self-righteous duty, but it's about the
[1:29:35] quickening power. I remember when I gave
[1:29:37] my heart to the Lord at 22 years old, I
[1:29:39] was dabbling in the church. I didn't
[1:29:40] really have a desire to go to church. I
[1:29:42] was out there in the world hanging on to
[1:29:44] the things of the world, doing the
[1:29:45] things that worldly guys do at 21, 22
[1:29:48] something years old. And but when God
[1:29:50] truly got a hold of my heart, my passion
[1:29:53] and my desire became church.
[1:29:56] I quit the bar scene. I quit the
[1:29:58] drinking scene. I quit that scene. I
[1:30:00] turned away from all my worldly
[1:30:01] associates. I was alone, brother Tommy.
[1:30:04] For months on in kind of like Paul on
[1:30:06] the back side of the desert trying to
[1:30:08] find out who this God was that just
[1:30:10] completely changed my life. And that's
[1:30:12] what it means to be quickened. When God
[1:30:14] comes down and quickens you, he changes
[1:30:16] your desires. He changes your worldly
[1:30:19] associates. Oh, it doesn't mean you
[1:30:21] can't be friends, but it means you're
[1:30:22] not going out with them all the time.
[1:30:23] You're not hanging out with them all the
[1:30:24] time. Because why? How can two birds fly
[1:30:26] together? How can they flock together
[1:30:28] unless they be in agreement? Let me tell
[1:30:30] you, this is the agreement right here.
[1:30:32] We should flock together around this
[1:30:34] word. We should gravitate together
[1:30:35] around thus sayeth the Lord. We should
[1:30:37] expect God to come in every service. We
[1:30:39] should be praying for our young people
[1:30:41] to have a real Holy Ghost experience.
[1:30:43] Don't wait for some camp meeting. Get on
[1:30:45] your knees and begin to pray, begin to
[1:30:47] fast, begin to call out to God. God, I
[1:30:50] want to see my son saved. God, I want to
[1:30:52] see him filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:54] do what is necessary. mean business with
[1:30:56] God. God quicken them. Change them.
[1:30:59] Revolutionize their appetite. God, give
[1:31:01] them a hunger for the things of God.
[1:31:06] So, Brother Joe, why are you preaching
[1:31:07] it like this? Because I'm praying like
[1:31:09] this. I'm believing like this. I got
[1:31:11] four kids. I'm praying God to get a hold
[1:31:12] of them.
[1:31:15] Well, you're a good preacher. It ain't
[1:31:16] based on being a good preacher. It ain't
[1:31:18] based on being a good family. It ain't
[1:31:20] my relationship with God does not tie to
[1:31:23] them to God. They got to have their own
[1:31:24] relationship. God does not have
[1:31:27] grandchildren.
[1:31:31] Ephesians 3 and verse 20. Now to him
[1:31:33] that is able. I love this. To do exceed
[1:31:36] and abundantly above all that we can ask
[1:31:37] or think according to the power that
[1:31:40] workketh within us. Unto him be glory in
[1:31:43] the church of Christ Jesus throughout
[1:31:44] all the ages world without end. Notice
[1:31:47] this phrase who exceeded and abundant
[1:31:49] means superior, extraordinary,
[1:31:51] surpassing, uncommon, super added, more
[1:31:54] imminent, more remarkable, more
[1:31:57] excellent. Now there's another
[1:31:59] translation that would it says like
[1:32:01] this. Now to him who in exercise of his
[1:32:05] power that is at work within us is able
[1:32:07] to do infinitely
[1:32:09] beyond. Infinitely beyond. That means
[1:32:12] without
[1:32:13] end. I know some of you kind of like me.
[1:32:16] Your little Kentucky brain can't wrap
[1:32:18] around that word infinitely or
[1:32:20] infinitely, however you want to say it,
[1:32:22] but it's inf infinitely beyond all of
[1:32:25] our highest prayers or our
[1:32:28] thoughts. See, God's able to do far
[1:32:32] exceeding more than we can ask or even
[1:32:36] think. And if he can do that, then
[1:32:39] shouldn't we ask? Shouldn't we think?
[1:32:43] Shouldn't we pray? Shouldn't we believe
[1:32:45] for it? God pour it out. Service after
[1:32:49] service. But don't just wait for a
[1:32:51] service. Pour it out in the car. Pour it
[1:32:54] out in the closet. Pour it out at home.
[1:32:56] Pour it out. No matter if it's on the
[1:32:57] school, pour it out on a job. God, pour
[1:32:59] it out. I'm expecting Lord that you to
[1:33:03] do the exceeding abundantly. If it's on
[1:33:05] a Sunday morning, if it's on a Wednesday
[1:33:07] night, if it's a special meeting, it
[1:33:09] doesn't matter God. I'm only asking,
[1:33:11] God, that you pour it out. Let the
[1:33:13] quickening power of the Holy Ghost come
[1:33:16] and quicken that
[1:33:18] predestinated seed.
[1:33:21] 1 Corinthians 2 and verse one says, "And
[1:33:24] brethren, when I came to you," notice
[1:33:26] Paul's prayer or Paul's preaching here.
[1:33:28] I like Paul. Paul's man after I think me
[1:33:30] and Paul would have been best buddies.
[1:33:32] Paul, man, he shuck corn and Johnny
[1:33:35] didn't
[1:33:37] care. Paul, listen what Paul says. And
[1:33:40] I, brethren, when I came to you, I came
[1:33:42] not with excellency of speech or of
[1:33:45] wisdom. Now, Paul was an intelligent
[1:33:47] man. He was a learned man. He sat at the
[1:33:49] feet of Galia. He was a he was an, you
[1:33:52] know, a bright man, a brilliant man,
[1:33:54] just a a brilliant mind when it comes to
[1:33:56] the scriptures. But he says, "Notice my
[1:33:59] speech. I didn't come with you with
[1:34:01] excellency of speech or wisdom,
[1:34:03] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[1:34:05] For I determined not to know anything
[1:34:07] among you, save Jesus Christ and him
[1:34:09] crucified. And I was with you in
[1:34:11] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:34:13] trembling. And my speech and my
[1:34:16] preaching was not with enticing or
[1:34:19] persuasive words of man's wisdom, but in
[1:34:21] demonstration of the spirit of God.
[1:34:23] Notice that your faith shall not stand
[1:34:25] in the wisdom of man, but in the power
[1:34:27] of God.
[1:34:30] See, Paul is saying my ministry and you
[1:34:32] know, it didn't come with liberal arts.
[1:34:34] It didn't come with science. It didn't
[1:34:35] come with psychological uh endeavors and
[1:34:39] and philosophy and dry morality of the
[1:34:42] Gentiles. But my gospel, my preaching
[1:34:44] came with salvation through a crucified
[1:34:47] Christ. He knew that his preaching, it
[1:34:49] wasn't just going to fall dead. But God
[1:34:51] had anointed Paul to what? To change
[1:34:53] hearts and to change lives and to
[1:34:55] establish a gentile church to be
[1:34:58] quickened by the word.
[1:35:01] And Paul says, "My words didn't come.
[1:35:03] They're not enticing words, technical
[1:35:04] words, words of art can strive that
[1:35:07] human wisdom to captate or captivate our
[1:35:10] affections or have probable arguments
[1:35:12] only or to show reason to persuade the
[1:35:14] mind to ascent. No, nothing solid,
[1:35:16] substantial in advance. Only the run of
[1:35:19] words are or artfully put together, but
[1:35:22] without any strength of the argument in
[1:35:23] them, a method used by false teachers.
[1:35:26] But Paul said, "My preaching, my
[1:35:28] preaching came with power and
[1:35:30] demonstration of the Holy Ghost." What
[1:35:32] does that word demonstration means? It
[1:35:34] means manifestation. It means indutible
[1:35:37] proof. And that word indutible there
[1:35:39] means impossible to doubt. Paul said my
[1:35:41] preaching came with the impossibilities
[1:35:43] to doubt the word that when I lay hands
[1:35:46] on the sick, they had recovered. The
[1:35:48] dead were raised, the blind saw, the
[1:35:50] crippled walk. Paul saying, "My
[1:35:52] ministry, it ain't just come with
[1:35:54] enticing words, but there was a spirit
[1:35:56] behind it that quickened that word, and
[1:35:59] the dead raised alive, and evil spirits
[1:36:02] went out of people."
[1:36:05] Indutable proof impossible to doubt.
[1:36:12] He said, "The testimony of my
[1:36:14] ministry is that that which was preached
[1:36:18] manifested
[1:36:21] See the spirit furnished the evidence.
[1:36:24] Not a doctrine, not an idea, not a
[1:36:28] region, but the spirit. Paul says that
[1:36:31] the spirit had furnished a demonstration
[1:36:34] of the divine origin and the nature of
[1:36:36] the gospel. And we had back home at our
[1:36:38] church sister Atlanta. Many of you may
[1:36:40] have heard of her testimony. Believe
[1:36:41] I've given it here and brother Timothy
[1:36:43] shared it just a few weeks ago. you find
[1:36:45] that she had in her her left side of her
[1:36:47] lung was completely stage 4 nonhoskins
[1:36:52] cancer. They didn't give her no hope,
[1:36:54] brother
[1:36:57] Devin. But in a service after taking a
[1:37:01] few chemo treatments, lost her hair,
[1:37:03] ports in her
[1:37:05] arm, Brother Tim began to sing, "I'm
[1:37:10] leaning on the everlasting arm. I'm
[1:37:14] leaning. Yes, I'm
[1:37:16] leaning safe and secure from all
[1:37:20] alarm. And that revelation, it quickened
[1:37:24] that seed on the
[1:37:25] inside that cancer was defeated.
[1:37:32] It quickened it.
[1:37:37] Notice it became a personal revelation.
[1:37:41] And out of the mezzanine, she went and
[1:37:42] she began to dance around the
[1:37:45] church. Indutable evidence that the word
[1:37:49] that I'm preaching to you, Paul's
[1:37:51] gospel, William Brandham's gospel, our
[1:37:54] gospel, our message is still evidently
[1:37:58] effective.
[1:38:00] We had a young boy, young girl in our
[1:38:02] church. There she was, 16 years old on a
[1:38:04] night. She come up for prayer, wanted
[1:38:06] her son, her brother, excuse me, her
[1:38:07] brother saved. He was out in a rock band
[1:38:09] and got into drugs and alcohol on the
[1:38:12] college scene. He looked like a repbate.
[1:38:13] Kind of like some of our kids. You know,
[1:38:15] sometimes they look repbate. They look
[1:38:17] without hope, without any help. But yet
[1:38:19] God on a Wednesday night here, the
[1:38:21] service went long. And this young man
[1:38:22] woke up from his bed at 11:30. And you
[1:38:25] know, he seen mom and daddy wasn't home
[1:38:26] and he got scared and went across town
[1:38:28] and saw that the neighbors wasn't home.
[1:38:29] They were church members. They went
[1:38:31] home, ran to another neighbor's house
[1:38:32] that was church member. They went home.
[1:38:34] He got afraid that the rapture done took
[1:38:35] place.
[1:38:37] Oh, maybe you're here today. What was to
[1:38:38] happen that the rapture would take place
[1:38:40] in the next 10 minutes? Where would some
[1:38:41] of you be right here this morning? I
[1:38:43] trust you'll be at the altar praying,
[1:38:45] God, quicken me. Quicken me with that
[1:38:46] spirit. But yet, here he was. And you
[1:38:48] know, he he was so afraid that the
[1:38:50] rapture done taking place and he missed
[1:38:52] it. He drove his truck to church and he
[1:38:54] ran off in a ditch and he messed his
[1:38:56] truck up, but that thing crippled its
[1:38:57] way into the church parking lot. He ran
[1:38:59] in, stumbled in, ran to the altar, gave
[1:39:02] his heart to the Lord, and the boy still
[1:39:04] serving God today. He's got a beautiful
[1:39:06] wife, a beautiful child, a beautiful
[1:39:08] family. What am I talking about? I'm
[1:39:10] talking about quickening power. I'm
[1:39:12] talking about not some doctrine, not
[1:39:14] some idea. I'm talking about the power
[1:39:17] of God to come down on a Wednesday night
[1:39:20] through a little girl's prayer. I want
[1:39:22] my brother safe. And if it could happen
[1:39:24] for a sister, for a brother, what about
[1:39:25] a mom for a son? What about a a a father
[1:39:29] for his daughter? What about a family?
[1:39:31] What about a husband? What about a wife?
[1:39:33] What about quickening power and even the
[1:39:35] like tabernacle
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:39] infallible evidences
[1:39:42] that the word is still the word.
[1:39:46] Notice Paul says demonstration of the
[1:39:50] spirit and of power. That word power
[1:39:54] here is
[1:39:55] dunamis. It's inherent power residing in
[1:39:58] the thing by the virtue of its nature.
[1:40:00] It's dynamics.
[1:40:02] It means power to perform
[1:40:05] miracles. But it also has another
[1:40:08] meaning and we don't ever really preach
[1:40:10] this aspect of this word here. But it
[1:40:13] means moral power. It means excellence
[1:40:17] of
[1:40:18] soul. What good is it to do the
[1:40:21] supernatural? What good is it to be able
[1:40:23] to do the miraculous if your soul's not
[1:40:26] right? If your soul hasn't been
[1:40:30] quickened. But it's moral power, moral
[1:40:33] excellence. See, it's more than just
[1:40:35] performing laying hands on the sick and
[1:40:36] watching them recover. But it's a power
[1:40:39] to overcome
[1:40:40] sin. It's a power to rise above
[1:40:45] pornography. It's a power to rise above
[1:40:48] worldly fashion and ideas. It's a power
[1:40:51] to where you don't control it, it
[1:40:53] controls you. And without this power,
[1:40:56] man can live so long with his human
[1:40:58] abilities and his human efforts, but
[1:40:59] eventually he's going to fall to his own
[1:41:01] devices or the devices of the enemy. But
[1:41:04] with this quickening power, living on
[1:41:06] the inside of a believer, he will live
[1:41:07] above the temptations of sin. He will
[1:41:10] live above the enticements of the world.
[1:41:11] Why is that? How is that? Because he's
[1:41:14] been he had died and now he's been made
[1:41:16] alive again. Galatians 2:20 says, "I am
[1:41:18] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:41:20] live yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[1:41:23] me." That's what it takes, church. Not
[1:41:25] some idea living inside of you. Not some
[1:41:27] some dogma living inside of you, some
[1:41:30] doctrine living inside of you, some
[1:41:32] self-help programmer. This is the laws
[1:41:34] of the message. But I'm talking about
[1:41:35] Jesus Christ, the word made flesh, the
[1:41:38] token life coming on the inside of a
[1:41:40] believer living inside of him. And he
[1:41:42] says, I've been crucified with Christ.
[1:41:44] Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but
[1:41:46] Christ liveth within me. And the life
[1:41:48] which I now live in the flesh, I live it
[1:41:51] by the faith of the son of God who loved
[1:41:53] me and gave himself for me.
[1:41:58] Notice what Paul says here in 1
[1:41:59] Corinthians 2 and verse 5. He founded
[1:42:02] the
[1:42:04] church on
[1:42:07] power. On power, on God's power. Notice
[1:42:11] he says that your
[1:42:14] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[1:42:17] men but in the power of
[1:42:23] God. See Paul was against intellectual
[1:42:26] ability. He warned the church in Acts 20
[1:42:30] that wolves were going to come in among
[1:42:32] them. Acts 20 verse 28. Take heed
[1:42:35] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[1:42:37] flock over which the Holy Ghost had made
[1:42:39] you overseers to feed the church of God
[1:42:42] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:42:44] blood. For I know this after my
[1:42:46] departure shall grievous wolves enter in
[1:42:48] among you not sparing the flock. Also of
[1:42:51] your own selves shall men arise speaking
[1:42:54] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:42:57] after
[1:42:58] themselves. So great men,
[1:43:01] teachers,
[1:43:02] wolves coming in, you know, they're not
[1:43:05] coming in to feed the sheep, brother
[1:43:07] John. They're coming in to fleece the
[1:43:09] flock. Let me get some money out of
[1:43:11] them. Because for some of them, it's
[1:43:12] just a meal ticket. Some of them hadn't
[1:43:15] been no more quicken. But you know what?
[1:43:16] Maybe they're a great ortor. Maybe they
[1:43:19] have a resounding resonating
[1:43:21] voice. I wish I did, but I don't. So you
[1:43:24] get to hear me squeak and squall and
[1:43:25] scream and shout and all that, and it's
[1:43:27] going to be fine. But some, man, they
[1:43:29] can stack it all together, man. They can
[1:43:32] tell you what page, what paragraph
[1:43:34] number. I don't care what page and
[1:43:36] paragraph number. I want to see a life.
[1:43:40] I'm not looking for your intellectual
[1:43:41] ability. Some of you can maybe you can
[1:43:43] quote the paragraphs and you can quote
[1:43:45] the quote just perfect and you can
[1:43:46] recite the entire book of Psalms. And
[1:43:48] hey, that's great. Pat yourself on the
[1:43:50] back, give yourself a gold medal. But
[1:43:52] that ain't going to get you to heaven.
[1:43:54] We're talking about quickening power.
[1:43:56] And I'm telling you church, there's a
[1:43:58] people that's been
[1:43:59] predestinated to quickening power.
[1:44:03] So he says here in Matthew 24:24,
[1:44:05] listen, for there should arise false
[1:44:08] Christs, false anointed ones, and false
[1:44:12] prophets, and they shall show great
[1:44:14] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:44:16] were possible, they shall deceive the
[1:44:19] very elect. Now, the question now arises
[1:44:20] in our minds, does God forsake his own
[1:44:23] and let them fall into a state of
[1:44:24] complete deception? This this is in the
[1:44:26] church age. It says on no account for
[1:44:28] the scripture says that see very clearly
[1:44:31] in Matthew 24 that the elect cannot be
[1:44:34] deceived.
[1:44:37] Come on elect of God.
[1:44:40] For there shall arise false Christ,
[1:44:41] false prophets and they shall show great
[1:44:43] signs and wonders in so much if it were
[1:44:45] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:44:47] elect. He says what then? The answer is
[1:44:49] clear before. There is a true church and
[1:44:51] a false church. There is a true vine and
[1:44:54] a false vine. And then in the Messiah,
[1:44:56] he says, "No, no. The elect ain't going
[1:44:58] to be deceived." No, no, they won't be.
[1:45:00] No. He says, "Church members will, but
[1:45:03] not the elected. They are chosen from
[1:45:05] the foundation of the world. They cannot
[1:45:07] be deceived. It's impossible." Hebrews
[1:45:09] 6, they will not be deceived. And the
[1:45:12] house of God says, "Amen. I am a
[1:45:15] quickened son and daughter of God. I
[1:45:17] can't be deceived. Though false teachers
[1:45:19] arise, those false prophets arise.
[1:45:21] Though great men come with their
[1:45:23] intellectual ability, we can see right
[1:45:25] through it. Why? Because we have been
[1:45:27] quickened. Quickened by the Holy Ghost
[1:45:30] and that seed on the inside has been
[1:45:33] germinated and comes to life.
[1:45:37] Ephesians 2 and verse one. And you hath
[1:45:39] he quickened.
[1:45:41] See, you need to put your name there.
[1:45:43] And you, Joe Adams, has he quickened.
[1:45:46] That's right. Tommy Richmond has he
[1:45:49] quickened. Amen. Tammy Richmond has he
[1:45:52] quickened. John Ler has he quickened.
[1:45:55] Caleb has he quickened.
[1:45:58] David has he quickened. Come on. I'll go
[1:46:01] around the church. You won't put your
[1:46:02] name there. I'll put it there for you.
[1:46:05] Carson has he quickened. Come on,
[1:46:06] church. Troy has he quickened. Oh, come
[1:46:10] on. We got to do better than that this
[1:46:11] morning. Sarah has he quickened. Jessica
[1:46:14] has he quickened. Lauren has he
[1:46:17] quickened. Weston has he quickened. Brad
[1:46:20] has he quickened. Daniel has he
[1:46:22] quickened. Paul has he quickened. Gideon
[1:46:24] has he quickened. Oh, hallelujah. I put
[1:46:27] your name there. I've been quickened by
[1:46:30] the word, by the anointing, by the Holy
[1:46:33] Ghost. And you have he quickened.
[1:46:37] You've been
[1:46:38] quickened by the power of God. Not some
[1:46:41] intellectual theology, but by the super
[1:46:43] anointing.
[1:46:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:48] You had thee quickened. Notice
[1:46:50] now who were dead in trespasses
[1:46:54] and sins.
[1:46:57] Lois, put your name there.
[1:47:02] Ah, come on, Devin. Put your name there.
[1:47:07] Man, you didn't think there was no hope
[1:47:08] for a minute.
[1:47:12] Oh, but God, can I say it again? But
[1:47:15] God, God put a seed, church. God planted
[1:47:19] a seed there before the foundation of
[1:47:22] the world. And God was, he's obligated
[1:47:26] to make sure that that predestinated
[1:47:28] seed is quickened. And you may go a long
[1:47:31] time. You may be covered up in sin. But
[1:47:34] God, you had to quicken this morning. He
[1:47:36] quickened you not with some intellectual
[1:47:38] theology, but quickened you by the word
[1:47:40] of God.
[1:47:43] Bible says where in times past you
[1:47:45] walked walked past tense. I want y'all
[1:47:48] to get this. This is past
[1:47:50] you. Matthew, this is past
[1:47:53] you. Josh, this is past
[1:47:56] you. You
[1:47:58] walked according to the course of this
[1:48:01] world, according to the prince of the
[1:48:03] power of the air, the spirit that now
[1:48:04] workketh in the children of
[1:48:05] disobedience. Notice whom also we had
[1:48:09] our conversation in times past in the
[1:48:11] lust of the flesh, fulfilling the
[1:48:13] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[1:48:15] and were by nature the children of
[1:48:17] wrath, even as others. Oh, but God.
[1:48:22] Come on, somebody help me preach this
[1:48:25] morning. But God, he ain't a poor God.
[1:48:28] He ain't a broke God. He ain't a
[1:48:30] depleted God. body. But God who is rich
[1:48:33] in mercy, who is rich in grace, who is
[1:48:36] rich in love, who is rich in joy, God
[1:48:39] this morning, but God this morning who
[1:48:42] is rich in mercy,
[1:48:45] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:48:48] even when we were dead in sins,
[1:48:51] tatted up, torn up, twisted up, tied up.
[1:48:56] But God, brother Brad,
[1:49:00] man, if you'd have known me before I got
[1:49:01] saved, none of y'all would want anything
[1:49:03] to do with me. You Now, why you got to
[1:49:06] say it so loud?
[1:49:09] Slow down, Caleb with your
[1:49:12] amens. But God,
[1:49:15] man, I had a fiery temper and a foul
[1:49:17] mouth, but God.
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:23] I thank God my wife didn't know me back
[1:49:24] then. She's like, "Ain't no way she can
[1:49:27] get through all those past, all that."
[1:49:29] But God, see, God can.
[1:49:33] God loved us when we were dead in sins
[1:49:35] and trespasses. He had quickened us,
[1:49:39] made us alive with Christ, for by grace
[1:49:42] you are saved. And he had raised us up
[1:49:45] together. Notice now, and made us sit in
[1:49:47] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That
[1:49:51] heavenly place is the promise that is
[1:49:53] the believer's position in Christ. Oh,
[1:49:56] we may be sitting here this morning in
[1:49:57] Elton, Kentucky, even like tabernacle.
[1:50:00] Oh, but we are seated in heavenly
[1:50:01] places. Why? Because that soul has been
[1:50:04] quickened by the word. And some of you
[1:50:06] are frying in the heavenlies. And I'm
[1:50:08] trying to get some of you out of the
[1:50:09] chicken yard that you recognize that you
[1:50:11] are always an eagle. You wasn't some
[1:50:14] dog. You weren't some some pig turned
[1:50:16] into a sheep. You always was a sheep and
[1:50:19] you always will be a sheep. You always
[1:50:21] was a son of God and you always will be
[1:50:24] a son of God. You may have drifted. You
[1:50:26] may have pecked around. You may have got
[1:50:28] all bessed up and dirty. But God, God
[1:50:31] who is rich in mercy. God who is full of
[1:50:33] grace this
[1:50:37] morning. You always was a seat of God.
[1:50:44] And can I tell you this ain't done by
[1:50:45] church power.
[1:50:47] This ain't done by your favorite
[1:50:48] preacher's power. This ain't done by
[1:50:51] some intellectual power, but it's by
[1:50:53] quickening power.
[1:51:00] 1 Thessalonians 1 and verse
[1:51:02] 5. Can I keep going a little bit longer?
[1:51:09] Notice what Paul says. Paul's adamant.
[1:51:13] Paul's ministry, he never changed. He
[1:51:16] stayed with the word. He says, "For our
[1:51:19] gospel came not to you in word
[1:51:23] only." But it came in
[1:51:25] weakness. It came in intellectual
[1:51:27] ability. It became because great men
[1:51:30] could pull up the table lap and search a
[1:51:32] thought and just bring it all the way
[1:51:33] through with no revelation, no anointing
[1:51:36] to bring it to pass. Do you realize that
[1:51:38] your prophet that he would preach things
[1:51:41] prior to 63, prior to the opening of the
[1:51:43] seals that after the opening of the
[1:51:45] seals, his revelation and his
[1:51:46] understanding changed?
[1:51:49] Well, well, maybe after the seals open,
[1:51:53] he became a prophet. He always was a
[1:51:54] prophet, but God doesn't reveal
[1:51:56] everything to his prophets. Prophets
[1:51:57] grow in revelation just like you and I
[1:52:00] grow in revelation and understanding.
[1:52:02] So, you got to have grace for the
[1:52:03] ministry. We may preach it one way for
[1:52:05] so long and we not that we want to be
[1:52:07] wrong, not that we want to be an error,
[1:52:08] but maybe we don't see the full
[1:52:10] revelation. And but Paul here, Paul's
[1:52:12] revelation and his understanding was
[1:52:14] never on his own human ability. But he
[1:52:17] said, "My gospel or our gospel came to
[1:52:20] you not in word only but also in power
[1:52:24] dunamis. Power to perform miracles.
[1:52:27] Power to live a moral life. Power to
[1:52:30] live above sin. Power to live above
[1:52:32] drugs. Power to live above the world.
[1:52:34] Power. It came not with intellectual
[1:52:37] teaching. It came not with dead creeds
[1:52:39] of man. But it came in power. It came in
[1:52:42] anointing of the Holy Ghost. Paul set
[1:52:45] the church with the anointing and the
[1:52:47] power of God in it. Not some dead creed,
[1:52:50] not some dead dogma, but a super
[1:52:52] anointing for a super race, for a super
[1:52:55] church.
[1:52:59] See, the effect of the gospel is evident
[1:53:02] in the lives of the believer.
[1:53:05] Notice what the gospel does. It makes a
[1:53:08] drunkard sober.
[1:53:11] It makes a thief honest.
[1:53:15] Oh, come on now. It makes It makes the
[1:53:17] promiscuous pure.
[1:53:20] It makes the profane reverent. It makes
[1:53:23] the lazy oh my. It makes the lazy
[1:53:27] industrious
[1:53:28] and get off your lazy hide and get
[1:53:31] working. Find a jo o and I ain't talking
[1:53:34] about job in the Bible. I'm about find
[1:53:36] yourself a job and get busy. Make
[1:53:38] something of yourself. Quickening power.
[1:53:43] You ain't got your hand out waiting on
[1:53:45] mama and daddy and the government to
[1:53:46] feed you, but you wait. You're trusting
[1:53:48] God that you'll get out there and make
[1:53:50] something of yourself. It turns the
[1:53:52] harsh and unkind to gentle and kind. It
[1:53:56] takes the wretched and makes them
[1:53:58] happy. See, the gospel has been evident
[1:54:01] in every age because the effect of the
[1:54:04] gospel in every age continues to change
[1:54:06] the heart and the life of the believer
[1:54:09] in every age.
[1:54:11] 1 Corinthians 2 and verse4 we kind of to
[1:54:13] come back to this Paul's saying notice
[1:54:15] my speech and my preaching was not with
[1:54:18] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[1:54:21] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:54:24] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:54:26] wisdom of man but in the power of God.
[1:54:30] See there is a movement within the
[1:54:32] message community today that does not
[1:54:34] believe in displaying of this power. Now
[1:54:37] you may not be familiar with that but in
[1:54:39] other countries and other areas there is
[1:54:41] a movement they don't want this display
[1:54:43] of
[1:54:45] power. See we don't need the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:48] We don't need all that emotion. Brother
[1:54:51] Brad kind of preaching is not not
[1:54:55] accepted in a lot of message churches.
[1:54:59] See, they believe since brother Brandham
[1:55:01] came the seventh angel and Malachi 4 and
[1:55:05] you know and he opened up the sealed
[1:55:06] book and revealed all the mysteries and
[1:55:08] he tied all the loose together that now
[1:55:11] we have the revealed
[1:55:13] word and the church says amen. Amen. We
[1:55:17] had the restored word and since we have
[1:55:20] the revealed restored word we don't need
[1:55:23] all the emotion, brother Joe. That's
[1:55:25] just a bunch of nonsense. You just
[1:55:28] acting as who's a street
[1:55:29] Pentecostal. You just getting a little
[1:55:31] bit too excited. We don't believe in
[1:55:35] that. Well, if you hadn't been
[1:55:37] quickened, then the church turns cold.
[1:55:41] Oh, remember that time, Brother
[1:55:43] Brandham? He kind of met one one of his
[1:55:44] friends said, "Brother Brandom, I was
[1:55:45] really enjoying your service, but when
[1:55:47] they begin to scream and shout, it sent
[1:55:49] shivers all up my back." He said, "Wow."
[1:55:51] He goes, "I'll tell you, if you ever get
[1:55:52] to heaven, you're going to freeze to
[1:55:54] death."
[1:55:56] He said, "This is the quietest place
[1:55:58] you'll ever be. Cuz if you go to heaven,
[1:56:01] there's going to be shouts praising God.
[1:56:03] Hallelujah. And if you go to hell,
[1:56:05] there's going to be weeping and wailing
[1:56:07] and nashing of teeth." I'm just telling
[1:56:09] you, you need to decide right now where
[1:56:11] you plan on spending
[1:56:13] eternity. I said, "Quicken me, Lord, by
[1:56:15] the supernatural power of God. I want to
[1:56:18] shout praises while I can. I want to say
[1:56:20] hallelujah long as I got breath in my
[1:56:22] lungs." The Bible says, "Let everything
[1:56:24] that has breath praise the Lord."
[1:56:27] There's only one kind of believer that
[1:56:29] has a right not to praise God, and
[1:56:31] that's a dead one. But ain't none of you
[1:56:33] dead this morning. You've been made
[1:56:34] alive. You got breath in your lungs. You
[1:56:37] got a right to shout. You got a right to
[1:56:39] praise. You got a right say, "Glory to
[1:56:41] God. I've been quickened. I've been made
[1:56:43] alive. I've been transformed by the
[1:56:45] power of God.
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] Well, we got the revealed word. We no
[1:56:55] longer need all this excitement. And
[1:56:58] they in their ministries, notice, they
[1:57:00] don't preach the revealed word. They
[1:57:03] teach. Now, let me say this. We need
[1:57:06] anointed teaching because anointed
[1:57:08] teaching places us on the word of
[1:57:14] God. And we're going to get into some of
[1:57:16] this. My goodness. I got to I got a long
[1:57:19] ways to go. Here we go. Smokey hand
[1:57:22] abandoned. But notice the revealed word.
[1:57:26] Now they teach the reveal. That word
[1:57:28] revealed means to be made known. So if
[1:57:30] they're teaching, brother Tommy the
[1:57:31] revealed word. Then things got to happen
[1:57:34] in the church.
[1:57:36] If they're teaching it, then it's got to
[1:57:38] happen. But there's churches that don't
[1:57:41] want you to tell a testimony. Don't want
[1:57:43] you to say what anything's what God's
[1:57:45] doing. their fear that you're taking
[1:57:48] away from brother Brandham. The greatest
[1:57:50] discredit that we can do to this message
[1:57:53] is to say and keep our testimonies to
[1:57:56] oursel and not share them.
[1:57:59] The greatest discredit that we can do to
[1:58:01] God.
[1:58:04] Look, I've seen God move in my ministry.
[1:58:06] Joe Adams didn't have nothing to do with
[1:58:08] it. I'm a man like you. But God working
[1:58:10] through a vessel, answering a prayer of
[1:58:13] a people, quickening the heart. Notice,
[1:58:17] our faith should not stand in man's
[1:58:19] ability to articulate or orate man's
[1:58:21] ability to stack quotes and scriptures
[1:58:23] and recite sermons, pages, and paragraph
[1:58:25] numbers, but our faith is to stand in
[1:58:27] the dunamis power, the power to perform
[1:58:29] miracles, and to live an excellent moral
[1:58:32] life. That's what Paul is saying. I
[1:58:34] don't care how much you shout. I don't
[1:58:36] care how much you scream. I want you to
[1:58:38] live a life. I want you to live a life.
[1:58:42] If you can't muster up the first amen,
[1:58:45] just live a sermon. Live it. Manifest
[1:58:50] it. Show to this dying world that you
[1:58:52] have been changed by the gospel.
[1:58:56] Notice Paul being well trained. Brother
[1:58:58] Bam says this is in Hebrews. Paul being
[1:59:00] well trained, he knew the scriptures by
[1:59:02] the word. But you see scriptures, no
[1:59:03] matter how well you know them, if the
[1:59:05] spirit doesn't quicken them, then the
[1:59:07] letter killth. Notice, but the spirit
[1:59:10] giveth life. It must be quickened or
[1:59:13] made alive by the spirit. If the spirit
[1:59:15] doesn't live the word and make it a
[1:59:17] reality to you, then the letter is just
[1:59:20] intellectual. And he says, and that's
[1:59:21] where many confessed Christians today or
[1:59:24] professed Christian is that their
[1:59:25] intellectual conception of Christ. Well,
[1:59:28] I believe God sent a prophet when I
[1:59:30] believe the message and it's just
[1:59:32] intellectual conception. Gideon, we want
[1:59:35] more than just intellectual
[1:59:38] conception. I don't want intellect. I'm
[1:59:41] glad that you're intellectually can
[1:59:42] conceive it and it's there and you got a
[1:59:44] great mind and you can you can remember
[1:59:46] the scriptures and remember the quotes.
[1:59:48] But what use is it, brother Tommy, if
[1:59:51] the heart and the nature has not been
[1:59:54] yet quickened? Well, I go to Eden Light
[1:59:56] Tabernacle. And you live like a devil
[1:59:59] Monday through
[2:00:00] Friday, but on Sunday, man, I'm in
[2:00:03] church. I got perfect attendance.
[2:00:08] I hadn't missed a service in a long
[2:00:11] time. Well, big whoop. Give you a gold
[2:00:15] star.
[2:00:17] But what I'm trying to get that soul
[2:00:19] converted this morning
[2:00:22] predestinated brother Glenn to
[2:00:24] quickening power that you know that you
[2:00:28] know that you know that you know listen
[2:00:31] what brother Bram
[2:00:33] says. Satan doesn't care how religious
[2:00:37] you are. So everybody in here put your
[2:00:39] wings
[2:00:40] up. Sit on them. Stuff them down. Put on
[2:00:44] them wings. He doesn't care how
[2:00:45] religious you are, how right you are in
[2:00:48] your doctrine. If you miss that life,
[2:00:52] you won't come up anyhow.
[2:00:55] Young people, do you understand what
[2:00:57] he's saying
[2:00:59] there? If you miss that life, that
[2:01:04] quickening power. Well, I'm going to be
[2:01:06] Bible way camp or what's that new what's
[2:01:08] that camp's about to come up? BYC. I'm
[2:01:11] going to BYC in a couple weeks. I'm
[2:01:13] gonna get it there. Why wait till you go
[2:01:16] to BYC? How about we get it right here
[2:01:18] with me? I'm trying to rap and I'm not a
[2:01:22] rapper. But you understand what I'm
[2:01:24] saying? If you miss that life, oh, you
[2:01:28] can shout, you can nod, you can agree
[2:01:31] with the sermon, you can agree with the
[2:01:32] preacher, you can agree with the pastor,
[2:01:34] you can do all the the dos and the
[2:01:37] don'ts, but if your heart hadn't been
[2:01:39] changed and your life hadn't been
[2:01:41] quickened, you will not come up.
[2:01:46] Understand me. You can be ever so good,
[2:01:49] so clean, so moral, so right. Don't miss
[2:01:51] a service. Support the mom. Support dad.
[2:01:53] Don't give them any kind of trouble. But
[2:01:55] if you don't have that
[2:01:59] life, you're going to miss the
[2:02:03] rapture. I know this is very flat, but
[2:02:05] it's meant to be flat. Cuz I'm trying to
[2:02:07] spare you heartache.
[2:02:09] I'm talking about you got to know that
[2:02:11] you got to know that. You got to know
[2:02:13] that you got to know. You got to quit
[2:02:15] playing games with yourself. That don't
[2:02:16] only go for the young people. It goes
[2:02:18] for some of you moms and dads. You may
[2:02:20] have been going through the motions and
[2:02:21] going through the faz and going through
[2:02:22] the, you know, just what we do as
[2:02:24] believers. We come to church, we raise
[2:02:26] our family a certain way, but you know,
[2:02:27] the inside of your heart has never
[2:02:28] really been transformed by the
[2:02:30] quickening power. I'm talking about that
[2:02:32] to you today. No matter how religious
[2:02:35] you
[2:02:37] are, if you miss that life, you will not
[2:02:41] rise.
[2:02:44] And if I was you this morning and you
[2:02:47] knew that you didn't have it, there's no
[2:02:49] way I'd stay in my seat. There's no way
[2:02:52] I'd stay complacent. There's no way I'd
[2:02:54] stay right where I'm at. I'd be running
[2:02:57] to the altar. So God, quicken me while
[2:03:00] there's time. Quicken me while there's a
[2:03:02] power to be quickened with. Listen what
[2:03:04] he goes on to say. Notice he says
[2:03:07] now there's only one spirit. Notice
[2:03:09] that's not the spirit of man. It's not
[2:03:11] the spirit of the church. It's not the
[2:03:12] spirit of a movement, but it's the Holy
[2:03:13] Spirit, which is the spirit of Christ.
[2:03:15] And Paul would say, the gospel is not in
[2:03:17] word only. See, the word's just the dead
[2:03:20] letter. It's got to take the the
[2:03:22] quickening power. It's got to be
[2:03:23] quickened and made alive, brought to
[2:03:24] pass what the letter says it'll do. See,
[2:03:27] not just teach word, but preach, make it
[2:03:29] manifest. The word has to be made alive.
[2:03:31] It's a dead letter until it's made
[2:03:33] manifest. And then it's quickened and
[2:03:36] it's brought to pass. And God said about
[2:03:38] it, he says, "Notice, that's the gospel
[2:03:40] in action. If the devil can't keep you
[2:03:42] from seeing the truth, if he can't keep
[2:03:46] you from seeing the truth, he'll push
[2:03:47] you overboard with
[2:03:49] it. He'll make you a fanatic, doesn't
[2:03:52] mean you've been quickened, but he'll
[2:03:54] make you fanatical about it. Oh, you
[2:03:56] jump, shout, speak in tongues in every
[2:03:58] service. It ain't got one thing to do
[2:03:59] with God."
[2:04:02] See, if the devil can keep you from
[2:04:03] seeing the truth, he'll push you
[2:04:05] overboard with it. See, if you go off on
[2:04:07] some fanatic or some fantastic or either
[2:04:10] you he'll keep you from seeing it all
[2:04:11] together. And he says he talked about
[2:04:13] the Methodists. They had a shout.
[2:04:14] Pentecostal spoke with tongues. There
[2:04:16] was a group. They had the shakers. Men
[2:04:18] will walk up one aisle. They shake the
[2:04:20] ladies down another aisle and they
[2:04:21] shake. And none of them had the Holy
[2:04:23] Ghost. None of them had the quickening
[2:04:24] power. They just had a formalism, a
[2:04:27] fantastic.
[2:04:29] I'm not here to get all of you to jump
[2:04:31] and shout and act like Joe Adams or Brad
[2:04:33] Powell or Thomas Bow or Tim Puit or
[2:04:35] Donnie Reagan or Andrew Spencer or
[2:04:37] Timothy Prud, whoever you want to put
[2:04:39] there. It ain't about acting like some
[2:04:40] man. I'm talking about being quickened
[2:04:42] and acting like God.
[2:04:45] See, God lives in his word. Faith cometh
[2:04:48] by hearing, hearing by the word. And by
[2:04:50] faith are you saved and that's through
[2:04:51] grace. Not anything whether you shake or
[2:04:54] speak in tongues or whe whatever takes
[2:04:55] place that has nothing to do with it.
[2:04:57] Jesus said, "He that heareth my words
[2:04:58] and believeth on him that sent me, he
[2:05:00] hath eternal life. He that heareth my
[2:05:03] word and believeth has been quickened to
[2:05:08] him." Let me kind of go down here. And
[2:05:10] he said, "The devil, the enemy of your
[2:05:12] soul, he can't tread on those sacred
[2:05:14] grounds where you met Christ."
[2:05:18] So you ain't got to worry about it,
[2:05:19] Brother Troy. When you meet God on the
[2:05:22] back side of that desert and that heart
[2:05:23] and that life has been quickened, ain't
[2:05:25] no devil can come there and take it
[2:05:27] away. Can't erase it off. They can't say
[2:05:29] the days of miracles of the past. You
[2:05:30] done been there. You done been proven.
[2:05:32] You done had the experience.
[2:05:35] There's been a lot of times Joe Adams
[2:05:37] want to throw his hands up and walk away
[2:05:38] and
[2:05:39] quit. But you know what? It ain't Joe
[2:05:42] Adams holding on. It's he's holding on
[2:05:44] to Joe Adams.
[2:05:49] There's a lot of times, Tommy, you want
[2:05:50] to throw your hands up and quit.
[2:05:52] There's a lot of times as parents, you
[2:05:54] want to give
[2:05:55] up, but it ain't us. It's God holding on
[2:05:59] to that
[2:06:02] seed. Let me try to get to a certain
[2:06:04] There's a certain place I'm wanting to
[2:06:05] get to
[2:06:06] today. Here we
[2:06:09] go. This is in a message conflict
[2:06:11] between God and
[2:06:14] Satan. He says, "What is the word of
[2:06:16] God?" The word of God is God
[2:06:19] himself. If you have pen and paper, I
[2:06:21] want you to write this
[2:06:23] down. The word of God is God
[2:06:27] himself. So God gave the believer,
[2:06:30] listen what he says. God gave the
[2:06:33] believer himself.
[2:06:37] He didn't give you a Bible. He didn't
[2:06:39] give you a track. He didn't give you
[2:06:41] some dogma. He didn't give you some
[2:06:43] doctrine. God gave you himself.
[2:06:49] So, brother Joe, why did God give
[2:06:51] himself? He says, "Woo!" He says, "It's
[2:06:54] God himself." He gave the believer
[2:06:56] himself to attack the enemy by, in other
[2:07:00] words, he's the father and the word is
[2:07:02] God and the word is our father. We're
[2:07:04] born by the word and he's standing in
[2:07:06] front for his children. There you are.
[2:07:09] He's standing out there for his
[2:07:10] children. What are we scared about? The
[2:07:13] rapture is sure. The coming is sure.
[2:07:15] Every blessing that's been promised is
[2:07:17] ours. All belongs to us. He said notice
[2:07:20] he gave the people himself.
[2:07:24] That's what I'm talking about being
[2:07:25] quickened. Not quickened to an idea, not
[2:07:28] quickened to some intellectual
[2:07:30] conception, but quickened with that
[2:07:34] life. But you know how the devil comes?
[2:07:37] Well, you know what? There's no hope for
[2:07:40] you. You send away your day of grace.
[2:07:43] Am I talking to anybody this morning?
[2:07:46] You had done crossed the line, dummy.
[2:07:49] Look at you. Look what you have done.
[2:07:51] You're a disgrace to your family. You're
[2:07:53] disgrace to the church. You're a
[2:07:54] disgrace to the community. See, that's
[2:07:57] the devil talking to you. God don't tell
[2:07:59] you that. God ain't there once. Bible
[2:08:02] says there is therefore now no
[2:08:04] condemnation to them that walk
[2:08:08] what? Come on. Y'all know the
[2:08:11] scripture. Walk after the spirit and not
[2:08:14] after the flesh. There's no
[2:08:16] condemnation. But notice what the
[2:08:17] prophet says. Jesus once and for all.
[2:08:20] One time he was he who was perfected
[2:08:22] forever those that had come into
[2:08:23] fellowship with an eternal blessing,
[2:08:25] eternal fellowship with an eternal
[2:08:26] presence of God with what? The power of
[2:08:29] the Holy Ghost. Not in a symbol out
[2:08:30] yonder in some word or in some theology,
[2:08:33] but in the Holy Ghost in you. the power
[2:08:35] of God that raised Christ from the grave
[2:08:38] made alive in you and you're a new
[2:08:39] creature. He goes then you're a son and
[2:08:41] daughter of God. Oh brother, he said
[2:08:43] that's it. Take the blood of Jesus
[2:08:45] Christ stir. He said to take the power
[2:08:47] of the life that's in the blood. 2
[2:08:48] Corinthians 5:17 says therefore if any
[2:08:51] man be in Christ he is a new creature.
[2:08:53] Old things have passed
[2:08:55] away and behold all things become new.
[2:08:59] And can I tell you this morning it's
[2:09:00] never too late to become a new creature.
[2:09:03] Amen. It's never too late to become a
[2:09:08] new creature. It's never too late to
[2:09:10] repent and be baptized in Jesus name so
[2:09:13] that you can be quickened and receive
[2:09:14] the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It's
[2:09:17] never too late. You say, "Well, Brother
[2:09:18] Joe, you don't understand what I've
[2:09:20] done." Let me just share a quote with
[2:09:23] you. Brother Brandham in Mark of the
[2:09:26] Beast, he says, "I had a vision. I hope
[2:09:27] I have time to tell it to you what
[2:09:28] happened a few nights ago. I've seen
[2:09:30] glory." He goes, "I've seen glory and I
[2:09:32] seen people. I seen a woman run up and
[2:09:33] put her arms around me up there and I
[2:09:35] seen a little, you know, and it been a
[2:09:37] little uh rough on he goes I've been a
[2:09:39] little rough on women anyhow and I seen
[2:09:41] this woman most beautiful thing I've
[2:09:42] ever seen and she called me her darling
[2:09:44] brother and I said why does she do that
[2:09:48] and he said she was past 90 when you led
[2:09:51] her to the Lord.
[2:09:55] She was past 90.
[2:09:58] What am I telling you? There's hope for
[2:10:00] you today. Amen.
[2:10:03] I don't see a 90year-old in here
[2:10:06] today. I don't see a 90year-old in here
[2:10:09] today. Well, I've sinned away my day of
[2:10:11] grace. I've gone too far. She was past
[2:10:14] 90 years old before the quickening power
[2:10:17] quickened her soul. Let me go a little
[2:10:20] further. Let me let me say it like this.
[2:10:22] He says, "Notice. Howdy, sir. There's
[2:10:24] something strange about you, sir. Satan
[2:10:26] has desired to take your life. You're
[2:10:28] all tore up. Now, if you're a woman, a
[2:10:30] sister, you can put your name here. You
[2:10:32] can say, "Ma'am, you think you send away
[2:10:35] your day of
[2:10:36] grace. You think your life is
[2:10:39] ruined. Do you love Jesus?"
[2:10:43] I'm asking, do you love Jesus?
[2:10:47] What makes you love him? Before there
[2:10:50] could be anything in there to make you
[2:10:52] love him, there has to be a creator to
[2:10:54] create the love in your heart.
[2:10:57] Man, come on, church. Before you could
[2:11:00] even desire to love God, God put that
[2:11:03] desire there.
[2:11:06] And if you got the
[2:11:07] slightest the slightest inkling of a
[2:11:11] desire to serve God, God put that there.
[2:11:17] God put that
[2:11:22] there. I'm going somewhere with this.
[2:11:26] God put that there. Listen, let me
[2:11:28] finish this quote. But before there
[2:11:30] could be anything there to make you love
[2:11:32] him, there has to be a creator to create
[2:11:35] the love in your heart. Is that right?
[2:11:37] If you send away your day of grace, you
[2:11:40] would hate
[2:11:44] Jesus. If you have sinned away your day
[2:11:47] of grace, you would hate Jesus. But you
[2:11:50] love him and you're all right. The
[2:11:53] devil's just lying to you. you're
[2:11:54] nervous, come here and I'll cast them
[2:11:57] away from you if you'll believe. Now,
[2:11:59] let me show you a scripture where one
[2:12:01] has sinned away their day of grace or a
[2:12:04] quote. Brother Bam's talking about this
[2:12:06] young lady. He was in a meeting and he
[2:12:08] approached her and he said, "God's
[2:12:09] giving you your last call." And she,
[2:12:11] "Mr. Brandon, if I wanted somebody to
[2:12:12] tell me about my last call," and she got
[2:12:15] all indifferent and you know, cuz she
[2:12:17] was a a preacher's daughter or deacon's
[2:12:19] daughter. She said, "Wait a minute. I'm
[2:12:21] going to leave." He goes, "I'm I'm going
[2:12:22] up here." She said, "You remember the
[2:12:23] night, preacher, you told me God was
[2:12:25] giving me my last
[2:12:27] call." She said, "It's the truth." She
[2:12:29] said, goes, "And you had the privilege
[2:12:31] to tell anyone you want to." She said,
[2:12:33] "But I'm lost forever." She said, "My
[2:12:35] heart has become so black." And he goes,
[2:12:37] "Here's her remark." She said, "I could
[2:12:39] see my mother's soul fry like like fry
[2:12:42] in hell like a pancake and laugh at it."
[2:12:45] See, that's the danger of rejecting
[2:12:48] Christ. You get so hard and so callous,
[2:12:51] you don't want nothing about
[2:12:54] it. But if God put a desire there, if
[2:12:58] God put a seed there, I don't care how
[2:13:00] much it's been covered up with shame,
[2:13:02] with hurt, with failures, with
[2:13:06] indifferences, with
[2:13:08] embarrassments, it's never too late to
[2:13:12] become a new creature.
[2:13:15] And if if I'm talking to you this
[2:13:17] morning and if there's any inkling of a
[2:13:21] love in that heart to serve God, God put
[2:13:24] it there. Cuz otherwise you would hate
[2:13:26] Jesus and you'd be just like this other
[2:13:28] girl in this quote, you could see your
[2:13:30] mom's soul fry in hell and laugh at it.
[2:13:34] But the Bible says in John 1 and verse
[2:13:36] 12, "But as many as received him, to
[2:13:38] them gave he the power to become sons of
[2:13:41] God, even to them that believed on his
[2:13:44] name, which were born not of blood, nor
[2:13:46] the will of flesh, nor of the will of
[2:13:47] man, but of God." So
[2:13:50] notice, God placed a desire in the heart
[2:13:54] of the believer to receive this word. I
[2:13:58] want the musicians to
[2:14:00] come. And if that's you this
[2:14:03] morning, you're
[2:14:05] predestinated to quickening
[2:14:09] power. You may have looked at your life
[2:14:11] and you may see all your failures. You
[2:14:13] may have woke up this morning and looked
[2:14:15] in the mirror and said, "Man, I have not
[2:14:17] amounted to anything but heartache,
[2:14:22] misery, poor little old me."
[2:14:27] But if there's an inkling of a
[2:14:31] desire, you still love God. You don't
[2:14:33] know how. You don't know why. You can't
[2:14:36] understand it. And you can't explain it.
[2:14:38] I'm not asking you to explain. I'm
[2:14:40] asking you to
[2:14:43] receive.
[2:14:45] Predestinated to quickening power. every
[2:14:51] seed, every son, every daughter, no
[2:14:54] matter what
[2:14:56] age. Brother Glenn, no matter what we go
[2:14:59] through or what we've gone through,
[2:15:02] there's a predestinated
[2:15:04] moment when that life is forever
[2:15:07] changed. Some of us, thankfully, it's at
[2:15:10] a young age. Others, Brother Glenn, I
[2:15:13] think it was a little bit longer for
[2:15:15] some of us.
[2:15:17] Some of us it may be past
[2:15:19] 90 before that seed ever gets quickened.
[2:15:22] But I'm telling you, there's a seed
[2:15:25] there. How do you know, Brother Joe,
[2:15:26] there's a seed there? Because there's a
[2:15:29] desire
[2:15:30] there. There's a desire for God. Oh, it
[2:15:35] may be pushed way down and you know, and
[2:15:40] but you know, and it just kind of hovers
[2:15:43] way real low, but you're here this
[2:15:45] morning.
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:47] Do you hear me? You're here this
[2:15:49] morning. Something brought you to the
[2:15:51] house of
[2:15:52] God. Something brought you in his
[2:15:54] presence this morning. Something brought
[2:15:55] you here to hear the
[2:15:57] service. Pre I'm telling you, you're
[2:16:00] predestinated to quickening power. Quit
[2:16:02] listening to the lie of the enemy
[2:16:04] telling you you've gone too far. You,
[2:16:07] you know, you're never going to make it.
[2:16:09] You've done too much. Your family's in
[2:16:10] ruins. Your house is in ruins. Your
[2:16:12] marriage is lost. And quit listening to
[2:16:15] that. And how about you listen to the
[2:16:17] word this morning? How about you listen
[2:16:19] to a man of God who's preaching to you
[2:16:20] about quickening power? A power that can
[2:16:24] take all the unbelief
[2:16:26] aside. A power that can write every
[2:16:29] wrong. Oh, it doesn't do away with your
[2:16:32] past, but it puts it
[2:16:34] somewhere. It puts it somewhere. And he
[2:16:37] sticks a sign up and says, "No fishing
[2:16:40] allowed."
[2:16:41] Bible says he'll put your sins in the
[2:16:44] sea of his forgetfulness. You know that
[2:16:47] God doesn't even remember your sins when
[2:16:50] they're confessed in the blood. Doesn't
[2:16:52] even remember. You bring it up, Satan
[2:16:55] brings it up, maybe somebody else brings
[2:16:56] it up, but God doesn't even know what
[2:16:58] we're talking about. That's a quickening
[2:17:01] power this morning. Quickening power of
[2:17:04] the word to take a hopeless case and
[2:17:08] make a trophy out of it.
[2:17:11] take a lost cause and make it his main
[2:17:15] purpose. God's purpose. He has a
[2:17:17] three-fold purpose. He was going to come
[2:17:18] in this hour and manifest himself in
[2:17:21] Christ to have preeminence in a body and
[2:17:25] to restore that body back to an Eden.
[2:17:29] And that's what's he doing. It takes
[2:17:30] quickening power. Now, I'm going to ask
[2:17:32] you this morning. I want every head
[2:17:33] bowed. I want every eye closed.
[2:17:37] I've come a lot of times and I preach
[2:17:40] very evangelistic faithbuilding
[2:17:42] messages. But today is kind of turning a
[2:17:44] little bit different
[2:17:46] and some of you were on my heart very
[2:17:48] heavily this morning. Yesterday as I was
[2:17:51] studying, making preparation this week
[2:17:53] and I'm going to ask
[2:17:55] you, if that's
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:17:59] you, if at you this morning, Satan said,
[2:18:02] "You've gone too far. You've done too
[2:18:05] much.
[2:18:07] But if there's a little
[2:18:09] desire, I'm going to ask you to get out
[2:18:11] of your seat and just come up to the
[2:18:14] altar. If there's one here this morning
[2:18:16] with the
[2:18:18] inkling of a desire, every head bowed,
[2:18:22] every eye closed, I'm going to give you
[2:18:24] an
[2:18:25] opportunity. Don't be ashamed.
[2:18:28] [Music]
[2:18:29] Maybe you're a young
[2:18:30] person and you're ready to make that
[2:18:33] full step, that full uh surrender to him
[2:18:37] this morning. The altar is open. That
[2:18:39] you know that you know that you know
[2:18:42] that you know. Remember church, no
[2:18:45] matter how religious you
[2:18:48] are, no matter how good you are, if
[2:18:51] you're here this
[2:18:53] morning and there's a question in your
[2:18:55] mind whether you had the baptism of the
[2:18:57] Holy Ghost tonight or today, the altar
[2:19:00] is open.
[2:19:03] I urge
[2:19:04] you. I encourage
[2:19:06] you. You don't have to be there and and
[2:19:09] doubt it, question it,
[2:19:12] wonder. The altar's open. He can give
[2:19:16] you that assurance this morning. That
[2:19:18] I've been
[2:19:19] quickened. My life has been transformed.
[2:19:22] Father, we just bow our heads to you
[2:19:24] this evening, Lord. Thank you for the
[2:19:26] opportunity you give us to come in your
[2:19:29] presence, to have church, Lord, to speak
[2:19:32] of the things of God. And yet, Lord, it
[2:19:34] may gone a little bit different than
[2:19:36] maybe what's expected. But I believe,
[2:19:38] Father, that there's those that are here
[2:19:40] this morning. Satan has told them
[2:19:42] they've gone too far. And Satan's has
[2:19:45] told them that there's no hope. They
[2:19:46] might as well quit, give up, walk away.
[2:19:50] But Lord, you a prophet would tell us if
[2:19:51] there is even a a love for him, then you
[2:19:55] the creator created that love and that
[2:19:57] heart for him. And I'm asking, Lord,
[2:19:59] you'd quicken that heart
[2:20:01] today. Lord, you'd quicken that life,
[2:20:03] young or old, Father, maybe there's a
[2:20:06] young person here or middleage here,
[2:20:08] Lord, this morning that maybe they've
[2:20:10] been wrestling with the idea whether
[2:20:12] they have the Holy Ghost or not. Lord, I
[2:20:15] believe we can understand and we can
[2:20:16] have the assurance, Lord, in this hour,
[2:20:18] Lord, that our lives have been
[2:20:20] transformed. We don't have to question.
[2:20:22] We don't have to wonder. We don't have
[2:20:24] to probe. We don't have to hope. We
[2:20:25] don't have to beg, Lord. We can have
[2:20:28] that assurance because our nature's been
[2:20:30] changed. Our desires have been changed.
[2:20:32] So I'm asking father today that you
[2:20:35] would just come in this service at the
[2:20:36] closing of it right now and lord anoint
[2:20:39] the word and anoint the
[2:20:41] heart quicken it to our our lives today
[2:20:44] father and may you just transform us
[2:20:47] lord make us a new creature this morning
[2:20:50] father may all the old things that we
[2:20:54] used to do the desires that we used to
[2:20:56] have lord may we be transformed and be
[2:20:59] made new this morning by the word of god
[2:21:02] May you put that seal, Lord God, on our
[2:21:07] lives, like that train car your prophet
[2:21:09] speaks about. That seal is there. No one
[2:21:12] can break that seal until it arrives at
[2:21:14] its destination. And I'm just asking,
[2:21:17] Father, today that the seal of the Holy
[2:21:19] Spirit, the abstract title, deed, Lord,
[2:21:22] to go to every heart, every life, every
[2:21:25] home, every boy, every girl, every man,
[2:21:27] every woman this morning, Lord, they'll
[2:21:29] know that they know there's not a devil,
[2:21:32] there's not a sickness, there's not a
[2:21:33] trial too
[2:21:34] great, but what the goods are going to
[2:21:37] arrive at its destination. So, we're so
[2:21:40] thankful today, Father. May you bless
[2:21:41] your people now in Jesus' name. Amen.

[2:22:47] king. Sing it once again. Oh, in the
[2:22:56] presence
[2:22:58] of
[2:23:03] Jehovah, God
[2:23:09] Almighty, my prince of peace.
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:18] Trles
[2:23:23] vanish,
[2:23:24] hearts are
[2:23:30] men in the

[2:23:43] Oh, in the
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:56] presence, God
[2:24:03] Almighty,
[2:24:05] Prince of

[2:24:11] trles vain,
[2:24:16] Manage
[2:24:18] hearts are
[2:24:23] mened in the
[2:24:30] praise of the
[2:24:35] King. Amen. Has it been good to be in
[2:24:38] the house of the Lord? We just thank
[2:24:40] brother Joe for pouring out his heart.
[2:24:42] And you know, I was thinking as he was
[2:24:44] preaching there, you know, the prophet
[2:24:45] tells us that because we definitely have
[2:24:47] heard a call go out today. And maybe
[2:24:50] there's somebody here that something was
[2:24:52] tugging at your heart, but you just
[2:24:53] couldn't make that
[2:24:54] step. And we don't say this and to put
[2:24:57] fear or or to to make you worry or fret,
[2:25:00] but the prophet taught us and told us
[2:25:02] that God's obligated to make that call
[2:25:05] once. And if God has tugged at your
[2:25:09] heart today and maybe you just maybe you
[2:25:12] just need some to think about it, don't
[2:25:14] let that word just lay
[2:25:16] idle, but start start
[2:25:19] praying because there's something
[2:25:22] there's a reason that the word went out
[2:25:24] the way it did
[2:25:27] today. You know, there's going to come a
[2:25:29] time that he's rounding up the final
[2:25:31] ones. I I truly believe that if if that
[2:25:33] when that last one is called and that
[2:25:36] last that quickening takes place,
[2:25:38] there's going to be a quickening of the
[2:25:39] bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:25:42] We're just waiting for that last one.
[2:25:43] Hey, we're not here to hurt you. We're
[2:25:45] not here to to put fear on you. We're
[2:25:46] pulling for you. We're pulling for you.
[2:25:49] And God, as he puts out the word, be
[2:25:51] receptive to the word. Be tender to it.
[2:25:55] What you got, Sister Becky?
[2:25:59] Lead in me a
[2:26:02] clean
[2:26:04] [Music]
[2:26:05] heart, oh

[2:27:08] me.
[2:27:11] Restore unto
[2:27:15] me the joy of thy
[2:27:22] salvation and renew the right spirit
[2:27:27] within me.
[2:27:31] Create in me, oh create in me a clean
[2:27:40] heart, oh
[2:27:45] God and renew the right
[2:27:49] spirit within me.

[2:28:08] God, and renew the right spirit within
[2:28:14] me.
[2:28:19] Oh, and cast me not
[2:28:23] away from thy
[2:28:28] presence, oh
[2:28:30] Lord, and take not thy holy spirit from
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:41] me.
[2:28:44] Restore unto
[2:28:48] me the joy of thy
[2:28:53] [Applause]
[2:28:55] salvation and renew aerite
[2:28:58] spirit within me.

[2:30:34] over by your shield of love.
[2:30:41] And I claim the
