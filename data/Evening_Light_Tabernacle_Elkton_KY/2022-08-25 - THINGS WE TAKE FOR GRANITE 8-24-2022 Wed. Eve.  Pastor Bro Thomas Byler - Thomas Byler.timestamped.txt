[55:51] amen
[55:52] all right let's pray
[55:55] kind heavenly father we just come before
[55:57] you lord jesus lord jesus just thankful
[55:59] father once again to be able to bask
[56:01] lord in your presence and to sing songs
[56:03] to you lord and to praise you lord jesus
[56:06] and
[56:07] just honor you lord jesus with our heart
[56:09] and father everything that's within us
[56:10] father we just want to tell you that we
[56:12] are appreciative lord jesus of all that
[56:14] you do for us and for being able to
[56:16] assemble together tonight lord knowing
[56:18] god that wherever two or three are
[56:19] gathered there you would be in our midst
[56:21] lord and
[56:22] we're so grateful of god that you
[56:24] promised that you would never leave us
[56:26] no forsakes even to the end of the world
[56:28] and father we believe that you're in
[56:29] your children lord jesus you're with
[56:31] each one of your
[56:32] sons and your daughters tonight father
[56:34] we just ask god that you'd help me just
[56:36] get out of the way now father as we try
[56:38] to express what you've laid upon our
[56:40] hearts to speak about tonight father
[56:42] bless the reading of the word
[56:44] ministering tonight in jesus christ's
[56:45] name
[56:46] amen and amen
[56:48] praise the lord amen that was good amen
[56:51] everybody said amen
[56:53] praise the lord
[56:56] it's a simple little thought tonight if
[56:58] you want to turn with me to the book of
[56:59] hebrews
[57:01] let's go to hebrews 2.
[57:08] something i've spoken on before but for
[57:10] some reason it just seems like the holy
[57:12] spirit wants to remind us
[57:13] perhaps once again would that be all
[57:15] right
[57:21] hebrews chapter 2.
[57:23] therefore we ought to give the more
[57:25] earnest heat to the things which we have
[57:27] heard at least at any time
[57:29] we should let them slip
[57:31] for if the word spoken by angels was
[57:33] steadfast and every transgression and
[57:36] disobedience received a just recompense
[57:38] of reward
[57:39] how shall we escape if we neglect our
[57:41] greatest salvation
[57:43] which at the first began to be spoken by
[57:45] the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[57:48] them that hurt them god also bearing
[57:50] them witness both with signs and wonders
[57:52] and with diverse miracles and gifts of
[57:54] the holy ghost according to his own son
[57:57] or his own will may god add his
[57:59] blessings to the reading of the words
[58:00] you can be seated
[58:02] amen i don't know if any of you have
[58:04] looked at the title yet tonight but we
[58:06] want to speak with the help of the lord
[58:09] on things that we take for granted
[58:11] amen things we take for granted
[58:14] amen and also
[58:16] want to speak on negligence amen i was
[58:19] beginning i was thinking about
[58:20] negligence of course we know that
[58:23] to neglect something it's just not to
[58:25] pay a whole lot of attention to it
[58:27] not to take it too serious all right
[58:30] to be slothful about it
[58:34] and so forth uh and also what you take
[58:37] for granted you do add treat pretty much
[58:40] the same way
[58:41] amen so i was thinking you know
[58:43] uh about
[58:45] you know taking things for granted and
[58:48] and so forth the neglection neglection
[58:50] it of course leads to
[58:52] uh taking things for granted and also
[58:55] taking things for granted
[58:56] also goes the other way it means you're
[58:59] neglecting something
[59:00] amen
[59:02] amen i looked looked it up
[59:04] on siri and so forth and it
[59:06] specific you talked about a lot of times
[59:09] perhaps you know your spouse or somebody
[59:11] like that that you would take sometimes
[59:13] for granted things that we take for
[59:14] granted and also
[59:17] an interpretation of it was and often
[59:20] implies a lack of appreciation
[59:22] or gratitude amen
[59:25] a lack of appreciation or lack of or
[59:28] gratitude
[59:29] and i thought we're living in a world
[59:31] that is very much like that
[59:35] people that do not appreciate amen
[59:38] they don't have any gratitude
[59:40] amen for the things that they have now
[59:43] uh for the privileges and i want to talk
[59:45] about privileges for a little bit comedy
[59:47] believes that we're a privileged people
[59:53] we're a privileged people
[59:55] beyond what you can imagine
[59:57] more so
[59:59] than what you realize amen
[1:00:02] i think our first neglect is realizing
[1:00:05] how privileged we are
[1:00:08] the first thing we take for granted is
[1:00:10] how we how privileged we are
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:16] you know and i was i was thinking of one
[1:00:19] thing i was thinking about when i kind
[1:00:20] of come onto this i'm thinking how that
[1:00:23] they want to come out with these
[1:00:24] electric cars and they want to go green
[1:00:26] everything right
[1:00:27] and i thought well i'll tell you what
[1:00:29] maybe one of these days i'm gonna be
[1:00:30] driving this little electric car that
[1:00:32] they give you because they're already
[1:00:34] talking about maybe not having people
[1:00:36] own their own cars and stuff
[1:00:38] huh
[1:00:39] yeah but about you're up there just man
[1:00:40] you're way off but hey they they when
[1:00:43] they first come out and said they defund
[1:00:44] the police we all laugh like what what a
[1:00:46] stupid idea
[1:00:48] but they did it right you just never
[1:00:50] know what might happen there but anyway
[1:00:52] you think about you might have to go and
[1:00:54] drive a little car that'd run electric
[1:00:56] and have can go down the chattanooga
[1:00:58] have to charge it up this that or the
[1:00:59] other you know you know i thought you
[1:01:01] know look well i tell you what i
[1:01:03] appreciate i appreciate
[1:01:05] i'm thankful tonight to be able to drive
[1:01:09] and be able to fuel up
[1:01:12] i thought you know i got to think of how
[1:01:14] that we never think about these things
[1:01:16] we hardly ever think about these things
[1:01:18] and and it's called taking these things
[1:01:20] for granted
[1:01:22] now unfortunately if you take two things
[1:01:25] too much for granted and you neglect
[1:01:27] those things your life will lose those
[1:01:29] things
[1:01:30] isn't that right
[1:01:32] and when i got to thinking of the whole
[1:01:33] spectrum of negligence and and taking
[1:01:36] things for granted it goes a long way
[1:01:38] don't it
[1:01:40] and especially in the spiritual realm
[1:01:42] but i thought i might talk a little bit
[1:01:43] for just a little while about some of
[1:01:46] the natural things that we we
[1:01:48] we take
[1:01:49] for
[1:01:50] granted amen
[1:01:53] praise the lord there's there's so many
[1:01:54] things and
[1:01:55] and just like going out and starting our
[1:01:57] car up let's talk about about that for a
[1:01:59] minute you know the prophet god said it
[1:02:01] takes faith just to start your car up
[1:02:04] do you ever think about knights gonna
[1:02:05] take faith no you just naturally do it
[1:02:09] amen and you don't even think about the
[1:02:11] common faith that you have
[1:02:13] amen to crank your car up to do those
[1:02:15] natural things
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] even even
[1:02:22] we take for granted
[1:02:25] our breathing
[1:02:31] how many ever thanks god for being able
[1:02:33] to breathe
[1:02:34] how many ever appreciative be able to
[1:02:37] breathe we hardly ever do that do we
[1:02:39] you don't think about it
[1:02:41] but how many knows if you amen when you
[1:02:43] think about
[1:02:45] you know just those things that those
[1:02:46] little things that you really don't
[1:02:49] appreciate a lot of times
[1:02:51] naturally speaking
[1:02:54] naturally speaking
[1:02:56] but you let yourself choke one time
[1:02:59] yeah you get something caught in your
[1:03:01] throat one time and find out how much
[1:03:03] you appreciate
[1:03:05] if that thing comes out
[1:03:08] amen that's the same way when you really
[1:03:10] realize you know because even the
[1:03:12] prophet said we have no promise of ever
[1:03:13] going out to swords to make it at home
[1:03:16] now we don't worry about that do we
[1:03:18] but we take it for granted that hey you
[1:03:20] might not
[1:03:21] we don't think about that
[1:03:23] people take life oh the whole world
[1:03:25] takes life in general for
[1:03:28] granted they act like they're going to
[1:03:31] live forever
[1:03:33] huh and that there's no judgment there's
[1:03:36] they take god for granted which is in
[1:03:37] the spiritual realm but it takes so much
[1:03:39] for granted
[1:03:41] mobility
[1:03:42] amen to be able to move be able to do
[1:03:45] and and to be able to walk talk to
[1:03:47] somebody in a wheelchair
[1:03:49] amen and and and you know complain about
[1:03:53] you having to maybe hobble a little
[1:03:54] because your foot hurts or this that or
[1:03:56] the other they'll say but you can just
[1:03:58] be glad that you come on
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] you know one thing that this does for me
[1:04:07] i believe it makes you sensitive to god
[1:04:10] it makes appreciate makes you appreciate
[1:04:12] god on a much higher level
[1:04:16] because i'm here to tell you that i
[1:04:17] believe it makes us more thankful for
[1:04:20] everything that you have
[1:04:22] for everything that you're able to do
[1:04:25] and i want it to not just be a
[1:04:27] thankfulness but i want it to be an
[1:04:29] actual worship
[1:04:32] amen the actual praise amen for all that
[1:04:35] god ever does
[1:04:37] for you
[1:04:38] and for everything that you have
[1:04:41] now we all know that us americans the
[1:04:43] americans and our young people
[1:04:44] especially maybe not as they're older
[1:04:46] folks
[1:04:47] especially not people like brother
[1:04:48] hershel and sister rivendell some of
[1:04:50] those that were
[1:04:51] come through those hard times that
[1:04:54] depression
[1:04:57] hey they appreciate everything
[1:05:00] they're a whole lot more you find those
[1:05:01] people are a whole lot more appreciative
[1:05:03] of what they have than the generation
[1:05:05] that we have now they don't appreciate
[1:05:07] the things they have they don't
[1:05:08] appreciate the country near it
[1:05:12] i mean why do you think a border floods
[1:05:14] when it's open like it is
[1:05:16] because they want
[1:05:19] they want to have a chance at the
[1:05:21] privilege that you and i have
[1:05:26] how many believe you're privileged
[1:05:28] just to live in this country
[1:05:34] glory yeah
[1:05:37] yeah if i was in south america if i was
[1:05:39] in into mexico if i was anywhere there i
[1:05:42] would probably be flooding too that is
[1:05:44] coming to this place
[1:05:46] huh
[1:05:48] why because we're privileged still
[1:05:51] we know those privileges the devil's
[1:05:53] trying to take away but and eventually
[1:05:55] probably will lose a lot and lot a lot a
[1:05:57] lot according to the prophet isn't that
[1:05:58] right even that his church very well
[1:06:01] could lose this church
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] i found that wrong but ibm says meetings
[1:06:07] like this will be a fond memory
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:11] so you'll be a fond memory or something
[1:06:12] you know we used to get together we used
[1:06:14] to be able to get together the devil
[1:06:16] don't want us to get together he hates
[1:06:18] freedom
[1:06:19] huh
[1:06:20] and i think tonight i hope out tonight
[1:06:22] we appreciate more
[1:06:24] all the little things
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:28] seeing
[1:06:30] being able to see right
[1:06:31] i have appreciated in the last few weeks
[1:06:34] i'll tell you what you know i've
[1:06:35] appreciated the you know the times that
[1:06:38] i could go like that and not everybody
[1:06:40] was a blur
[1:06:44] and i took it for granted i never
[1:06:46] thought about ever losing my sight
[1:06:49] i never thought about
[1:06:50] you know yet someday you may have to
[1:06:52] wear a glass i didn't mind putting them
[1:06:54] on a little bit for a little ring no
[1:06:55] problem but every day all the time sweat
[1:06:57] dripping down i have to wipe them all
[1:06:59] time you know
[1:07:01] but we take things for granted
[1:07:05] that's right hearing

[1:07:09] phrase how many glad first being able to
[1:07:11] see tonight

[1:07:14] person fanny crosby says well you're a
[1:07:16] blessed person
[1:07:18] huh
[1:07:20] just because you're able to see
[1:07:22] just because you can walk just because
[1:07:25] amen you can speak
[1:07:28] and praise be to god
[1:07:30] and all the natural things all the

[1:09:06] everything we did have to be pumped
[1:09:10] but they have running water they have a
[1:09:11] hot water heater instead of they have to
[1:09:13] heat water up thank god we ain't got to
[1:09:16] make a bath all in the same tub anymore

[1:09:53] let me tell you something we are we are
[1:09:55] not negligent when it comes to our
[1:09:58] natural things
[1:10:01] that's one place we are not negligent
[1:10:05] huh
[1:10:07] and we don't take it for granted
[1:10:10] no we're on top of it
[1:10:13] but my question is when we come to the
[1:10:15] house of god
[1:10:16] are we as clean as we make our body
[1:10:18] before we come
[1:10:20] i mean it believes the inside that's
[1:10:22] what's really important
[1:10:24] is that we have that right now we don't
[1:10:26] neglect that
[1:10:28] that we don't take that for granted
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:35] we thank god for good soaps and
[1:10:37] everything else he gives us that causes
[1:10:39] it to be able to smell good
[1:10:42] and be clean
[1:10:44] well i don't know about you but i thank
[1:10:46] god
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] that we can be clean on the inside now
[1:10:51] we've got a hyssop
[1:10:52] that we've got a blood of jesus christ
[1:10:54] that cleanses you from all
[1:10:56] unrighteousness does it make you
[1:10:58] absolutely clean and smell good
[1:11:03] good to be around don't you like to be
[1:11:05] around people that are good to be around
[1:11:07] we know what brother bran said to
[1:11:08] certain people you just
[1:11:13] don't care about being around that
[1:11:14] person all they ever want to do is run
[1:11:15] somebody down
[1:11:17] talk about this talk about that
[1:11:20] or complain about everything don't you
[1:11:21] just love a complainer
[1:11:25] that's right we don't like complaining
[1:11:26] nobody likes a complaint god don't like
[1:11:28] a complainer
[1:11:31] god's quite something isn't it he'll put
[1:11:34] you between a heart and a rock place and
[1:11:36] expect you to be happy
[1:11:44] he expects us to conduct ourselves with
[1:11:46] joy amidst the trials that he's allowed
[1:11:50] to come away
[1:11:56] a little hard to do sometime ain't it
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:03] because we got things
[1:12:04] you know and i know a lot of us here i
[1:12:06] know a lot of us have done it a lot of
[1:12:08] us have gotten to the place now i
[1:12:10] believe that something major can happen
[1:12:12] in your life
[1:12:14] and you can take the right attitude
[1:12:15] target
[1:12:19] hey the little bitty things that's not
[1:12:21] so bad but it's when the big things come
[1:12:23] your way
[1:12:24] you know the big changes the this big
[1:12:26] happening and all of a sudden you're
[1:12:28] gonna really get upset about it or you
[1:12:29] can say well god will handle that
[1:12:32] huh
[1:12:33] i believe it's time that we as
[1:12:35] christians are mature and when those
[1:12:37] things come we can conduct ourselves
[1:12:39] among with with gratitude
[1:12:42] with praise anyway
[1:12:44] i've just had a couple of those things
[1:12:46] happen in the last week man boy that's
[1:12:48] enough to make mess up your day
[1:12:52] to ruin your day

[1:12:56] just said man it was just a bad day i
[1:12:59] called it

[1:13:07] god knows
[1:13:09] i don't understand
[1:13:11] but god knows
[1:13:12] believe in god
[1:13:14] if i could have done something about it
[1:13:15] i would have
[1:13:17] but i couldn't so just leave it alone
[1:13:18] and commit it to god and let your bad
[1:13:21] days or whatever it might be committed
[1:13:22] to god and say god you take care of it
[1:13:25] amen

[1:13:44] yeah
[1:13:45] yeah not benjamin franklin he had to
[1:13:48] kite this string and got shocked
[1:13:50] thomas edison i believe you know
[1:13:52] perfected it or whatever and
[1:13:54] did all of that study and all of that
[1:13:56] work to light it up
[1:13:59] and you know he was kind of conf no
[1:14:01] doubt but considered a little bit he's a
[1:14:03] little crazy
[1:14:06] he thinks that he can take some kind of
[1:14:08] juice and run it through the wire and
[1:14:10] light light the place up
[1:14:13] [Laughter]
[1:14:16] look all of them folks are considered a
[1:14:19] little crazy
[1:14:20] i don't care they made fun of the ford
[1:14:23] to miss a ford you know when they
[1:14:24] started with these little cars and stuff
[1:14:26] from the car when they you know no doubt
[1:14:28] they had races in the kids one of them

[1:14:32] outrun the first cars they made
[1:14:34] called a bunch of foolish what's that
[1:14:36] rattle trap

[1:14:40] but where is it at today
[1:14:42] huh

[1:14:48] on and say thank you lord jesus
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:53] for the natural things all of those
[1:14:54] things that light up the whole world

[1:16:20] going on probably everything else
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] amen so praise god
[1:16:27] amen thank god that we're living in the
[1:16:29] hour that we're living in how many knows
[1:16:31] that we were procrastinated for this
[1:16:33] hour
[1:16:35] hey man we've got things we have we have
[1:16:37] just about everything
[1:16:40] huh they've got so many gizmos and
[1:16:43] gadgets and stuff nowadays right
[1:16:46] folks even your phone it'll do stuff i
[1:16:48] i'm not i don't even want to learn
[1:16:50] really
[1:16:52] you know all the stuff everything it'll
[1:16:54] do
[1:16:56] praise god but you know i had to think
[1:16:58] in the natural
[1:16:59] in the hour that we're living with
[1:17:01] everything at our fingertips
[1:17:04] huh
[1:17:05] everything that are disclosed we have
[1:17:06] everything and then i thought you know
[1:17:08] if everybody was a christian everybody
[1:17:11] lived godly
[1:17:13] everybody had the holy ghost then we
[1:17:16] could dismiss all the police forces
[1:17:19] brother braham says at the hospitals
[1:17:21] and all these things you dismiss all of
[1:17:23] them god take care of it what a
[1:17:25] wonderful world it would be if everybody
[1:17:27] was filled with the holy ghost
[1:17:33] now
[1:17:34] we know that in all that has been
[1:17:36] supplied all that we have all that we
[1:17:38] are privileged the most privileged
[1:17:40] people in the natural
[1:17:41] right
[1:17:42] we're the most privileged people of all
[1:17:44] time in the natural
[1:17:47] we have
[1:17:49] got it the easiest
[1:17:51] you know it's almost gotten to where if
[1:17:53] you if you want to stay in shape you
[1:17:55] better have some workout bench or go for
[1:17:56] a walk or run
[1:17:58] uh you don't have to go walk to the job
[1:18:00] you drive your car there you drive back
[1:18:02] and you get there and sit and machine
[1:18:04] does it work or whatever
[1:18:07] unless you're a carpenter then it
[1:18:09] requires a little bit of physical
[1:18:12] or a logger
[1:18:14] huh
[1:18:16] so everything in the natural
[1:18:19] compare so to speak with the spiritual
[1:18:22] my god shall supply all your need
[1:18:26] how many believes your need has been
[1:18:28] supplied
[1:18:31] amen the opportunity is there
[1:18:35] you know it's there you're privileged to
[1:18:37] take advantage
[1:18:40] of what has been given you
[1:18:43] of what has been supplied to you in
[1:18:45] every aspect
[1:18:47] yet we have homeless people living under
[1:18:49] bridges and everything else don't we
[1:18:53] amen it's sad
[1:18:56] when you look at the homelessness in
[1:18:58] america
[1:18:59] and so forth and and philadelphia i
[1:19:02] believe it is i've watched some of that
[1:19:03] it goes on in philadelphia down in some
[1:19:05] of those streets and the people that die
[1:19:08] like rats down there
[1:19:10] the drugs and how they're just
[1:19:12] if you've never seen it i don't know
[1:19:13] what you want to maybe use adulthood but
[1:19:16] they've taken on drugs and they actually
[1:19:17] have
[1:19:18] stations where they have garbage cans
[1:19:20] like where you dispose of your needles
[1:19:22] and everything
[1:19:25] i just read yesterday where i think in
[1:19:27] california they're thinking about
[1:19:28] setting up places where you can inject
[1:19:30] yourself
[1:19:33] you used to fight drugs didn't we now we
[1:19:35] promote it
[1:19:36] that's the devil in it destroying the
[1:19:38] people that's what it is
[1:19:41] it's all it is destroying the people
[1:19:42] destroying the country and they're
[1:19:44] practically zombies and so forth and the
[1:19:46] devil takes them out
[1:19:48] and it's sad
[1:19:50] amen
[1:19:53] yet a privileged people
[1:19:55] yet
[1:19:56] everything so much supplied in the
[1:19:58] natural yet people don't appreciate it
[1:20:00] and that's why you know realize that
[1:20:02] they took it for granted no there's a
[1:20:04] lot of people that simply took it for
[1:20:06] granted neglected it
[1:20:09] and lost it
[1:20:12] amen and whose fault when you think
[1:20:14] about it think about it whose fault
[1:20:17] amen
[1:20:20] brother bam says listen
[1:20:22] and how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:20:24] such
[1:20:25] you neglect to eat you'll die you
[1:20:27] neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck
[1:20:30] you neglect the milk the cow she'll go
[1:20:32] dry you neglect your teeth you'll have
[1:20:34] to have them pulled out someday you pay
[1:20:37] for your neglection
[1:20:41] oh my
[1:20:42] let me tell you this a lot of times our
[1:20:44] wives or our husbands can become so
[1:20:47] common to us until we not only neglect
[1:20:50] but we take them for granted
[1:20:53] take them for granted they'll always be
[1:20:55] there they'll always be there now be
[1:20:56] careful
[1:20:57] huh
[1:20:58] be careful
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:02] you pay for negligence
[1:21:04] amen and for taking things for granted
[1:21:07] you certainly do
[1:21:10] but we're privileged people in the
[1:21:11] natural
[1:21:14] and a lot of times when you have it too
[1:21:15] easy when things become too common to
[1:21:18] you
[1:21:18] it's when you begin to take things for
[1:21:20] granted that's why this wednesday night
[1:21:21] i don't take this moment for granted
[1:21:24] lord help me not to take you people for
[1:21:26] granted how many believes we shouldn't
[1:21:28] take each other for granted
[1:21:30] we're all precious brothers we're all
[1:21:31] precious sisters satan wants to destroy
[1:21:34] us he'd like to get in between us he'd
[1:21:36] like to do all of that
[1:21:38] but don't take each other for granted
[1:21:40] don't take anything for granted
[1:21:43] not anything
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:47] praise the lord
[1:21:48] looking at the spiritual for just a
[1:21:50] minute
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] we realize over in laodicea i mean it
[1:21:56] was over layout of the chile to see a
[1:21:59] church age
[1:22:00] they
[1:22:01] thought they were rich and increased
[1:22:03] with goods and had needed nothing
[1:22:06] but yet they thought they were spiritual
[1:22:08] didn't it they thought they were
[1:22:10] spiritual they thought they were right
[1:22:11] they thought that christ was with them
[1:22:15] just like joseph and mary did
[1:22:19] whenever they were going back home from
[1:22:21] i believe it was paying taxes or
[1:22:23] something
[1:22:24] and they were leaving and went home and
[1:22:25] once a day's journey or so and they
[1:22:27] realized jesus wasn't with him
[1:22:31] isn't that right and they had to go back
[1:22:32] for him and brother bound to preach a
[1:22:34] message on it
[1:22:35] talking about he's hot he thought that
[1:22:37] he was with him and he wasn't that's the
[1:22:39] way it was in this generation that's the
[1:22:42] way with all these churches and that's
[1:22:43] where it is a lot of people all the time
[1:22:45] they think that he's with them when he's
[1:22:47] not
[1:22:51] huh
[1:22:52] and that's that ain't it
[1:22:55] they neglected to look and make sure
[1:22:57] that he was i believe this is the hour
[1:22:59] of making sure that he is
[1:23:03] oh my to make sure leodysea they thought
[1:23:06] they were rich in creative goods
[1:23:07] pentecost which represented laodicea the
[1:23:10] last church ace was the pentecost the
[1:23:11] church age
[1:23:13] they almost saw them
[1:23:15] got rich they got increased with goods
[1:23:17] they had oh they had jump up and dance
[1:23:19] and music and speaking in tongues and
[1:23:21] everything else
[1:23:22] but when you looked at how the women
[1:23:24] dress and women even became preachers
[1:23:26] and they certainly didn't do that at the
[1:23:27] beginning
[1:23:28] huh
[1:23:30] they thought that god was with him but
[1:23:32] he wasn't
[1:23:34] amen they neglected him
[1:23:37] they took for granted that he was with
[1:23:39] them don't take for granted that you've
[1:23:41] got christ
[1:23:42] you have to make sure that you have
[1:23:44] christ
[1:23:46] how many know tonight that god has
[1:23:48] supplied us
[1:23:50] he has supplied us with everything
[1:23:52] we are spiritually the more more
[1:23:55] privileged people than all of those were
[1:23:58] all down through the dark ages
[1:24:01] we have more tonight
[1:24:04] more assurance more vindication more
[1:24:06] proof
[1:24:08] when i looked up that word privilege and
[1:24:11] looked down to the computer and it was
[1:24:12] like 200 of them brother man i'm almost
[1:24:14] all the time talked about what a
[1:24:16] privileged people that we are to have
[1:24:19] christ come right down among us and show
[1:24:22] us that he's here
[1:24:25] that he's alive and what is truth and
[1:24:27] what is right we're a privileged people
[1:24:33] oh my don't take it for granted don't
[1:24:35] neglect that like a hebrew says don't
[1:24:38] neglect this great salvation that god
[1:24:41] brought
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:44] i believe that's what god will tell a
[1:24:45] lot of people that tell i mean at the
[1:24:47] judgment
[1:24:49] he'll tell him why didn't you accept why
[1:24:51] aren't you saved it was not because i
[1:24:53] didn't supply it you just took it for
[1:24:55] granted
[1:24:56] you neglected it
[1:24:59] it wasn't the most important in your
[1:25:01] life
[1:25:05] oh my
[1:25:06] i think about it how negligent and how
[1:25:09] that will boy we'll be on the job we'll
[1:25:11] be there tomorrow morning people be on
[1:25:13] the job
[1:25:14] they won't neglect that
[1:25:16] that's the income
[1:25:18] but where's people in the house of god
[1:25:20] the night before which is more important
[1:25:23] even the prophet said i'd rather you
[1:25:25] miss some work than to miss church or
[1:25:27] sunday school
[1:25:29] better to miss that than it
[1:25:31] is a whole lot more important people are
[1:25:34] more concerned about whether you've got
[1:25:36] food to eat or clothes where than they
[1:25:38] are that you look good and you're
[1:25:40] dressed in the robe of his righteousness
[1:25:45] oh we wear the best clothes i try to
[1:25:47] come up here i try to make sure my ties
[1:25:49] matches my shirt and everything else
[1:25:51] we try to dress our best
[1:25:54] huh
[1:26:01] how about dressing the best spiritually
[1:26:05] i believe i believe tonight that it's
[1:26:07] more important that we dress right that
[1:26:09] we are closing his righteousness that
[1:26:11] you're full of the holy ghost
[1:26:13] that you got his move on
[1:26:18] that you don't take some perfect perfume
[1:26:20] soap or wash yourself you ought to take
[1:26:22] the perfume of the holy ghost and wash
[1:26:24] your soul real good that's more
[1:26:26] important
[1:26:31] trying to think of that now it just
[1:26:33] comes to mind we used to take a bath
[1:26:35] every two weeks
[1:26:37] and read our bible every day
[1:26:39] huh
[1:26:41] now we take a bath every day and read a
[1:26:43] bible every two weeks or so
[1:26:49] anyway
[1:26:52] one week with
[1:26:54] our prayer makes one no seven days
[1:26:56] without prayer makes one week
[1:26:59] something like that huh
[1:27:02] that's right
[1:27:03] glory
[1:27:06] this does something to me
[1:27:11] why aren't you why aren't we the kind of
[1:27:13] christians we ought to be i'll tell you
[1:27:15] why
[1:27:16] negligence
[1:27:18] we need like to take advantage of the
[1:27:20] opportunity that's in front of us
[1:27:24] it's the only answer because you cannot
[1:27:26] blame god
[1:27:27] when he said it was finished it was
[1:27:29] finished
[1:27:30] the prophet said if jesus was up here he
[1:27:32] couldn't heal you if he was in my suit
[1:27:35] wearing it he couldn't hear you he'd
[1:27:36] tell you i already did yeah i already
[1:27:39] killed you at calvary when it was
[1:27:41] finished it was finished can you receive
[1:27:43] it can you accept it
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:49] same way with salvation
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:53] the reason that people were going to
[1:27:55] hell is because they took it for granted
[1:27:59] they neglected to hear it
[1:28:01] they neglected oh my
[1:28:06] people are more concerned even jesus
[1:28:07] said isn't that right even just jesus
[1:28:10] said you know take no thought
[1:28:13] for your raiment or your food
[1:28:16] huh
[1:28:17] for god he knows that you have neither
[1:28:20] these things
[1:28:22] i believe that we god supplies those
[1:28:24] things for us
[1:28:26] how many believes that
[1:28:29] sure he does but what did he say seek
[1:28:31] first the kingdom of god and all these
[1:28:33] things will be added unto you
[1:28:35] but people are more concerned
[1:28:38] about their privilege in their natural
[1:28:40] than they are for their privilege in the
[1:28:42] spiritual
[1:28:45] that's why the church is in the shape
[1:28:47] it's in
[1:28:48] that's why the world is in the shape
[1:28:50] that it's in
[1:28:56] like i said people think they're going
[1:28:58] to live for you're not going to live
[1:28:59] forever you're going to come down and
[1:29:00] you're going to choke out you from your
[1:29:02] last breath one of these days
[1:29:04] like brother baby says i don't care how
[1:29:06] pretty you are i don't care what a
[1:29:07] hollywood star you are one of these days
[1:29:10] you're gonna shrivel up he said and die
[1:29:14] i like the way he put it
[1:29:17] that's the truth
[1:29:20] group up
[1:29:22] and die
[1:29:24] yeah
[1:29:25] i don't know if y'all have seen some of
[1:29:26] those arnold schwarzeneggers and uh
[1:29:29] rocky what's his name sylvester stallone
[1:29:31] or some of them you know and and and and
[1:29:34] they're shriveling you
[1:29:36] up they're
[1:29:39] shriveling up and i'm like boy if we
[1:29:40] could just if they could just get saved
[1:29:43] if they could just get a hold of god and
[1:29:45] realize
[1:29:46] all of that world is nothing
[1:29:48] you're nothing without god
[1:29:51] nothing
[1:29:53] oh my no wonder jesus said don't think
[1:29:56] so much about the body but think about
[1:29:58] that soul that's worth ten thousand
[1:30:00] worlds
[1:30:03] we went to a restaurant
[1:30:06] and if we ask for extra ketchup or
[1:30:08] mayonnaise they don't have it we'll say
[1:30:10] look this sandwich ain't made right can
[1:30:12] i have it made right
[1:30:18] or as the prophet said we go and get
[1:30:19] some soup and there's a spider or a bug
[1:30:21] in the soup we're going to self it say
[1:30:23] but what's wrong with y'all
[1:30:27] but we'll let all kinds of little books
[1:30:29] go in our ear we'll get all kinds of
[1:30:31] mess go down in our soul
[1:30:35] huh
[1:30:36] we got big old snakes and spiders and
[1:30:38] every kind of mold and mildew a lot of
[1:30:40] times
[1:30:42] why because we didn't pray like we
[1:30:44] should
[1:30:45] we didn't take advantage of the prayer
[1:30:48] that we could have had that morning that
[1:30:50] time with the lord
[1:30:54] i like what brother brad said about
[1:30:56] being hid away getting away somewhere
[1:30:58] and saying god i gotta have more of you
[1:31:00] that's what it takes to get more of god
[1:31:03] it's a consecration of saying god i want
[1:31:06] i got to have more
[1:31:09] boss man can you let me have off today i
[1:31:11] need to go somewhere and pray all day
[1:31:13] today i need to write my bible today
[1:31:16] give me a break
[1:31:20] i need a break
[1:31:22] so that i can
[1:31:23] feed this soul here
[1:31:25] i can take care of this a little more
[1:31:27] how many believe we need to take better
[1:31:28] care of this better of the soul not this
[1:31:32] outside but the inside
[1:31:37] oh my lord help us
[1:31:40] we'd see so much more of god
[1:31:42] in our life
[1:31:44] if we did
[1:31:48] people don't think there's going to be
[1:31:50] no judgment
[1:31:52] they just take it for granted there
[1:31:54] ain't going to be no judgment
[1:31:56] i mean is there in for a real rude
[1:31:57] awakening
[1:32:01] oh my i want to preach a little bit to
[1:32:03] our politicians is that all right
[1:32:06] all of them guys that say we just
[1:32:07] evolved from monkeys
[1:32:10] darwin theory and all that other stuff
[1:32:13] boy are you in for a rude awakening when
[1:32:16] you die
[1:32:17] you're gonna realize that you ain't no
[1:32:19] dead dog you ain't no monkey you're not
[1:32:22] gonna just stand and that's it you're
[1:32:24] still gonna be somewhere
[1:32:27] not only be somewhere but it'd be in a
[1:32:29] lost
[1:32:30] torment
[1:32:32] of a nightmare until god calls you back
[1:32:34] up and stands you in front of him and
[1:32:36] you
[1:32:37] him and judges you that's what you're in
[1:32:40] for
[1:32:44] you teach our young peoples that they
[1:32:46] come from monkeys no wonder they act
[1:32:48] like a bunch of apes
[1:32:51] well anyway i'm okay whatever
[1:32:53] huh
[1:32:55] animals
[1:32:57] it was you that did it
[1:32:59] huh
[1:33:00] that's right
[1:33:02] they take it for granted there's no
[1:33:03] judgment
[1:33:07] they take god for granted
[1:33:10] they know god
[1:33:11] don't even want to believe there is god
[1:33:17] best
[1:33:18] way that i can explain there that
[1:33:21] is what god said about it
[1:33:23] a fool
[1:33:25] a fool has said in his heart there is no
[1:33:29] god
[1:33:34] you think this can be by chance
[1:33:37] oh my i don't know if stupid's worse
[1:33:40] than a fool but whichever it is that's
[1:33:41] what you are
[1:33:43] to be able to look at this and then
[1:33:45] think that there's not a god that put it
[1:33:47] all together
[1:33:49] and you know what the biggest thing is
[1:33:51] i'll tell the the biggest condemnation
[1:33:53] that will be to this generation
[1:33:56] is that right there
[1:34:00] that'll be the greatest condemnation his
[1:34:03] word will condemn him already it it it's
[1:34:05] enough to condemn them all but when he
[1:34:07] got he sends a prophet like he said he
[1:34:09] was gonna and jesus comes down and does
[1:34:12] everything he ever did on the on the
[1:34:14] shores of galilee
[1:34:17] that is more
[1:34:19] over and over and over you don't believe
[1:34:21] that you are going to burn
[1:34:25] because it was jesus you just don't do
[1:34:27] that to god
[1:34:28] it wasn't brother adam that was the
[1:34:30] pillar of fire above his head it was
[1:34:32] almighty god
[1:34:34] and that'll be their biggest
[1:34:35] condemnation
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:42] can i say one more thing
[1:34:44] one thing about it i truly believe
[1:34:46] though that those that are elected those
[1:34:48] that have their seed on the inside they
[1:34:51] aren't gonna neglect it
[1:34:54] they're not gonna take it for granted
[1:34:59] come on people you ought to be a little
[1:35:01] louder if you want to know say i'm not
[1:35:03] going to take it for god i will not link
[1:35:05] back the baptism of the holy ghost i
[1:35:07] will not neglect to take opportunity of
[1:35:09] everything that he supplied for me
[1:35:12] i can be rich in god
[1:35:15] like my holy spirit that can be rich in
[1:35:17] my heart my soul can be full of god
[1:35:24] but i gotta quit being negligent
[1:35:26] the holy spirit is calling on you to
[1:35:28] quit being negligent
[1:35:32] quit taking these things for granted
[1:35:34] could take them so insincerely
[1:35:37] unappreciative
[1:35:40] we don't appreciate it enough
[1:35:43] huh
[1:35:45] my
[1:35:47] i was thinking on this and i thought man
[1:35:50] you know how many of us if we knew that
[1:35:53] something was going to raise up perhaps
[1:35:56] a new phone system or whatever
[1:35:58] and it's going to be the biggest ever
[1:36:02] well you take all your money probably in
[1:36:04] stock invest in the stock market right
[1:36:07] because it was going to go way way way
[1:36:08] up let me tell you something jesus made
[1:36:12] an investment on calvary and it's the
[1:36:15] richest thing ever
[1:36:17] because the biggest thing that people
[1:36:18] take for granted is their own life
[1:36:21] people will take their own life for
[1:36:22] granted
[1:36:25] huh
[1:36:26] brother tommy
[1:36:28] you have a little this past
[1:36:30] brother tommy took his life no time many
[1:36:32] times for granted
[1:36:34] huh
[1:36:35] any of these people that risk their
[1:36:37] lives
[1:36:39] for an adrenaline rush
[1:36:40] flipping their bikes over and all of
[1:36:42] that knowing that life could be snuffed
[1:36:43] out just like that
[1:36:45] all it takes is one mistake
[1:36:48] huh you take your life for granted
[1:36:52] and it isn't until you're in a
[1:36:53] wheelchair can't walk
[1:36:55] that you say over and over and over
[1:36:58] i shouldn't have done that
[1:36:59] i wish i wouldn't have done that
[1:37:02] i always should have been smarter
[1:37:04] huh
[1:37:06] don't you know that's going to be hell
[1:37:09] hell is going to be full of people boy i
[1:37:11] sure wish i would have taken advantage
[1:37:13] of the cross of calorie i wish i would
[1:37:15] have taken advantage of john 3 16.
[1:37:20] where he said whosoever
[1:37:27] i can't help but believe that somehow or
[1:37:28] other perhaps in my own mind now
[1:37:32] well maybe not because we know that that
[1:37:34] word is what's going to judge people
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:37] perhaps before the opening of the
[1:37:40] judgment day
[1:37:41] that scripture will be read for god so
[1:37:44] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:37:45] begotten son that whosoever
[1:37:48] believeth in him shall not perish but
[1:37:50] have everlasting life
[1:37:53] let's start this judgment
[1:37:57] let's see who took this for granted
[1:38:00] huh
[1:38:01] let's see who neglected this
[1:38:04] because that's going to be the only
[1:38:06] answer
[1:38:08] anybody that ever heard that scripture
[1:38:11] all you got to do is hear it once
[1:38:13] how many knows that's all god is
[1:38:15] obligated to do is to tell you one time
[1:38:18] you're obligated god is obligated to
[1:38:20] give it to you one time
[1:38:24] but he does it over and over and over
[1:38:26] and over again he's a mercy for god
[1:38:28] he reaches out his hand to read this
[1:38:30] doesn't he do that to us
[1:38:32] time at the time he reaches out
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:39] as i believe proverbs were said i
[1:38:41] reached out my hand but you would not
[1:38:45] you would not
[1:38:47] that's right
[1:38:48] that'll be a lot of that too you would
[1:38:50] not
[1:38:52] you would none of my reproof
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:57] that's right
[1:38:58] people take for granted this world's
[1:39:00] going to go on
[1:39:02] it's not
[1:39:04] it's not it's coming to a rugged end
[1:39:07] it's going to have a fire baptism
[1:39:10] it's going to burn
[1:39:12] it's coming to an end folks
[1:39:14] if they would not take that for granted
[1:39:16] they prepare
[1:39:17] they say what i gotta do
[1:39:20] oh my heard something else brother man
[1:39:22] says man what what consolation you and i
[1:39:25] have knowing that our economy and our
[1:39:27] world and everything that there is not
[1:39:29] one hope for it he said there is a hope
[1:39:32] and that is only in christ jesus is
[1:39:34] there any help
[1:39:35] the only answer people take for granted
[1:39:37] that jesus is coming back they think he
[1:39:40] might never come back
[1:39:43] but they neglect the fact that he's
[1:39:44] coming back
[1:39:46] how many knows that's why they'll be
[1:39:48] left behind
[1:39:50] well he delays his i don't know you know
[1:39:55] my i wonder how many message people
[1:39:56] would be like that
[1:39:58] i kind of go back out in the world and
[1:40:00] don't have no hallelujahs in church
[1:40:02] anymore
[1:40:04] ain't got no amen ain't got no preaching
[1:40:06] preacher i sit there and know man i hope
[1:40:09] you don't hit me too hard tonight
[1:40:12] huh
[1:40:14] my
[1:40:15] instead of amen that's right brother
[1:40:17] get lukewarm
[1:40:20] backslid
[1:40:23] on god
[1:40:25] why
[1:40:25] because they let it slip
[1:40:28] why did we preach this over and over
[1:40:30] because peter says i want to stir up
[1:40:33] your pure minds by way of remembrance
[1:40:38] how many beliefs we as humans
[1:40:43] well let me bring back
[1:40:46] you know some some people i guess
[1:40:50] well they've told me years ago i guess
[1:40:53] that they didn't need the five-fold
[1:40:55] ministry
[1:40:56] because they had come to perfection the
[1:40:58] five-fold ministry was supporting us in
[1:41:00] perfection once we come to perfection
[1:41:02] why would we need faithful ministry
[1:41:04] anymore
[1:41:06] well their lives proved that they really
[1:41:08] needed a preacher
[1:41:12] i don't think we'll ever not need a
[1:41:14] preacher because we're forgetful people
[1:41:17] we have a tendency to let it slip
[1:41:20] and we need to be brought back in line
[1:41:24] we need to hear something on the
[1:41:25] wednesday we need to hear something on a
[1:41:27] sunday
[1:41:28] we need to have it again tell it timing
[1:41:30] again preach it
[1:41:33] we need that holy spirit to remind us
[1:41:36] constantly remind us and i believe the
[1:41:38] prophet of god said we need to checking
[1:41:40] up time not every hour
[1:41:44] not every day but every minute of every
[1:41:46] hour
[1:41:48] we need to check up see whether we're
[1:41:49] ready or not
[1:41:52] amen
[1:41:56] we'll be good brother
[1:41:59] we'll be good
[1:42:01] if we are as rich
[1:42:03] spiritually
[1:42:04] as we are physically and financially
[1:42:10] well i'm not rich motherbot
[1:42:13] i'm just a punk
[1:42:15] didn't brother bam say something about
[1:42:16] even bombs or millionaires here in
[1:42:19] america
[1:42:26] why
[1:42:28] because like when donna was manager at
[1:42:30] burger king she had somebody come back
[1:42:32] up there and was it extra ketchup he
[1:42:34] asked for
[1:42:36] he come back in there
[1:42:38] and he took that sandwich and he threw
[1:42:40] it back way back now i said extra
[1:42:43] ketchup
[1:42:47] oh my
[1:42:49] you talk about small right
[1:42:52] we have all the time there was no pickle
[1:42:54] on that sandwich i don't think that they
[1:42:56] go back and
[1:42:57] keep that for the next one and add a
[1:42:59] pickle
[1:43:00] usually it goes to the garbage can
[1:43:04] right
[1:43:05] wrong get it right
[1:43:07] goes out in the dumpsters then people
[1:43:10] with pot bellied and india and and that
[1:43:13] have got sicknesses and everything else
[1:43:16] they'd be glad to be able to find a nice
[1:43:18] one like that without pickles they
[1:43:20] wouldn't mind it at all
[1:43:22] they say thank you jesus i got a nice
[1:43:24] one it made a pickle on it but it's
[1:43:27] great
[1:43:29] they can do good
[1:43:31] listen
[1:43:33] how many believes that
[1:43:34] we need to be richer spiritually
[1:43:37] lord jesus help us to be richer
[1:43:40] spiritually
[1:43:41] don't let me to neglect that soul
[1:43:46] people
[1:43:46] that how many knows people go through
[1:43:48] their lives and they never really think
[1:43:50] about their soul
[1:43:53] it's just something in the background
[1:43:55] how how is your how is your soul doing
[1:43:58] you know
[1:44:02] so hmm
[1:44:04] what's that
[1:44:06] apparently probably know what a soul is
[1:44:10] that's you that's the real you on the
[1:44:11] inside
[1:44:13] how's that guy do it
[1:44:14] not this guy the guy on the inside
[1:44:17] that one this robe of flesh drops that
[1:44:20] person that's on the inside it'll still
[1:44:22] be
[1:44:23] it doesn't just poof into thin air
[1:44:26] no that soul is still there
[1:44:30] how is it soul tonight how do you stand
[1:44:32] before god
[1:44:35] oh yeah
[1:44:37] neglect god neglect forgiveness
[1:44:41] neglect grace
[1:44:42] they neglect the great pardon
[1:44:46] let me know john 3 16 it's a great part
[1:44:49] now who's your everybody shall not
[1:44:50] perish but have everlasting life
[1:44:54] and you can sign your name in there in
[1:44:56] the nice he left the blank there
[1:44:58] that whosoever
[1:45:00] what's your name
[1:45:02] and if thomas bothers you believe in him
[1:45:04] he should not perish but have
[1:45:06] everlasting have eternal life
[1:45:10] people don't realize how valuable
[1:45:14] their life is
[1:45:16] until they come down to the door death
[1:45:19] then all of a sudden they get a
[1:45:20] revelation
[1:45:21] huh
[1:45:22] like brother brahm says man he's heard a
[1:45:24] lot of people say boy have my daughter
[1:45:26] have my son do this and have him do that
[1:45:28] i didn't do it can they maybe they can
[1:45:30] do it but everyone says your children
[1:45:32] and those folks can't do what you should
[1:45:33] have done
[1:45:35] you should have done that while you
[1:45:36] could
[1:45:38] huh
[1:45:39] they want to get right
[1:45:41] mine
[1:45:47] lord help us we want to be spiritually
[1:45:50] rich
[1:45:51] we want to be able to have a light on
[1:45:54] here how many it's glad for the light
[1:45:56] it shines in our hearts
[1:45:59] through the gospel through the holy
[1:46:00] ghost
[1:46:02] through the fire
[1:46:05] because we know that with the fullness
[1:46:06] of the word fullness of the word coming
[1:46:09] back
[1:46:10] brought the fullness of the spirit
[1:46:12] not just a gift of speaking in tongues
[1:46:14] or just a parcel but
[1:46:17] it gave the fullness of the spirit again
[1:46:21] so you don't have to be partially but
[1:46:22] you can be full of the holy ghost
[1:46:25] wash this blood
[1:46:27] they absolutely spurned absolutely
[1:46:30] neglect god's mercy
[1:46:34] his forgiveness
[1:46:36] my
[1:46:42] and they squander
[1:46:45] their life
[1:46:47] just squander
[1:46:49] their life
[1:46:51] let me tell you don't squander your life
[1:46:54] a lot of times
[1:46:56] youth how many knows youth is something
[1:46:58] a lot of times you
[1:47:00] uh
[1:47:00] take for granted
[1:47:03] you take for granted
[1:47:05] when you're young you don't think about
[1:47:07] being old
[1:47:10] no you don't think about being old 30
[1:47:13] 40. i didn't think about it hey when we
[1:47:14] had the big party down there
[1:47:16] sprayed deadly white stuff all over my
[1:47:18] hair and everything else and put a pair
[1:47:20] of glasses on me
[1:47:22] you know i look about like i do now i
[1:47:24] guess
[1:47:25] oh man
[1:47:28] i thought that ain't too bad
[1:47:29] you know
[1:47:31] but boom there hit 50 yeah
[1:47:33] and then 60. folks it doesn't last long
[1:47:36] make the most of your youth serve the
[1:47:39] lord with your use use it for the lord
[1:47:42] that's why i'm glad to see brother tommy
[1:47:44] here different ones danny different one
[1:47:45] do something for god that's one thing
[1:47:47] brother brandon talks do something with
[1:47:49] whatever you have do something for god
[1:47:52] don't be idle be doing something for god
[1:47:56] because it's the only thing that will be
[1:47:57] worth anything in the end is what did
[1:47:59] you do for god
[1:48:01] i'm not going to ask you how successful
[1:48:02] you were in this side or the other it'll
[1:48:04] be what did you do for christ what kind
[1:48:06] of the servant was you
[1:48:08] amen
[1:48:11] praise the lord
[1:48:13] god is good
[1:48:15] the spiritual privileges god has
[1:48:17] supplied how many knows he's supplied
[1:48:18] it's all here
[1:48:20] we're not living in the machine gun age
[1:48:22] anymore we're not living in a uh
[1:48:25] the muzzle loader anymore
[1:48:28] remember how brother man type the
[1:48:29] natural with the spiritual and so forth
[1:48:32] now we're in the atomic age
[1:48:37] hey amen
[1:48:40] people used to maybe try to shoot the
[1:48:42] devil with a gift they have maybe
[1:48:43] speaking in tongues and use some gift to
[1:48:45] overcome the devil
[1:48:47] but what brother brahm says if you want
[1:48:48] to overcome
[1:48:50] you have to overcome the way jesus
[1:48:52] overcome
[1:48:53] is that right
[1:48:54] and how did jesus overcome anything
[1:48:57] it was with the word of
[1:48:58] god it is written
[1:49:02] it's also written even the devil would
[1:49:04] use it you know the scriptures but he'd
[1:49:06] say it's also written he'd always fight
[1:49:09] him with the word
[1:49:10] because we know the word will defeat the
[1:49:12] devil anytime any place on any grounds
[1:49:16] it'll defeat him every time
[1:49:19] not your emotions
[1:49:21] it has to be that word
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:24] quote him the word tell him what the
[1:49:26] word says
[1:49:27] you get sick you say bye stripes i am
[1:49:30] healed
[1:49:34] hey let me tell you some in closing
[1:49:37] if the prophet of god had to get his
[1:49:38] healing
[1:49:41] by no great revelation from what i
[1:49:42] understand
[1:49:44] not something great come down here but
[1:49:46] he said he began to claim his claim that
[1:49:49] we're by his stripes i am healed
[1:49:53] by his stripes i am healed and he sat at
[1:49:56] the table with mom and daddy from my
[1:49:58] understand and he began to eat food that
[1:50:00] he was not supposed to eat or he would
[1:50:03] kill him
[1:50:04] and he began to eat that food and mama
[1:50:06] was crying don't eat that don't need
[1:50:08] that
[1:50:10] huh
[1:50:10] don't eat that son
[1:50:12] and man he went to throwing up
[1:50:17] hey
[1:50:19] get back down there
[1:50:22] talk about faith huh
[1:50:25] take god at his word and see what
[1:50:27] happens
[1:50:31] think about that stomach remember that
[1:50:33] stomach trouble he had he didn't get
[1:50:35] instant healing
[1:50:36] years and years and years
[1:50:39] it bothered him
[1:50:40] [Music]
[1:50:42] and then one day
[1:50:43] the squirrel-like thing to come out of
[1:50:45] there right
[1:50:46] amen and god touched him he's over with
[1:50:48] his eyes that he couldn't barely see
[1:50:50] because of explosion of different things
[1:50:52] god healed him and he could see 20 20.
[1:50:55] how many god does that so let me
[1:50:56] encourage your feet folks have faith in
[1:50:59] god
[1:51:01] doesn't matter what it is you take god
[1:51:02] at his word he is obligated he will back
[1:51:05] his word up
[1:51:08] i want to say this god does not neglect
[1:51:11] to take care of us
[1:51:13] we're a privileged people tonight to
[1:51:15] have a father like what we do
[1:51:18] amen
[1:51:20] there was these two birds up in the tree
[1:51:25] just talking to each other

[1:51:31] them all of them humans look how sad
[1:51:33] they are

[1:51:37] years ago i remember they waved each
[1:51:39] other they'd say how do you do they'd
[1:51:41] say good morning but now they just pass
[1:51:43] each other with their head down all sad
[1:51:46] what do you reckon it is
[1:51:50] and one says you know
[1:51:52] maybe maybe they don't have a heavenly
[1:51:54] father like we do
[1:51:58] he knows the fall of a sparrow
[1:52:02] he knows what you have need of he cares
[1:52:04] he's my heavenly father tonight how many
[1:52:06] say god i am thankful that i have you
[1:52:08] for my heavenly father one that cares
[1:52:11] one that doesn't neglect you he don't
[1:52:12] neglect us he gives us what we have need
