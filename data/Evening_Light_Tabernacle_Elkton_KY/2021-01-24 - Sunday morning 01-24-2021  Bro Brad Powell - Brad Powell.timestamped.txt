[33:08] with me

[33:12] like brother butler said so
[33:14] just wanted to say thank you to brother
[33:16] byler for his friendship
[33:18] first and foremost and for having the
[33:20] confidence
[33:21] uh to ask me to minister in the church
[33:23] it's it's a big responsibility
[33:25] i've never taken it lightly and
[33:28] you know i just really cherish the
[33:30] opportunity to be able to do that
[33:33] um you know talk about testimony god's
[33:35] certainly been good to us
[33:37] i've been good to my family and good to
[33:39] the church you know you look out you see
[33:41] the people of the church
[33:42] and you see how god's moved on the
[33:44] people and and how god moves in our
[33:46] services and
[33:47] and just seems like we're getting to a
[33:48] higher place and that's where we've got
[33:50] to get to
[33:52] um it's been about 11 years i think
[33:54] since i delivered a message to the
[33:56] church
[33:56] and so my my lovely wife reminded me of
[33:59] that so
[33:59] you know no pressure no nerves you know
[34:01] so it's been a while
[34:03] but uh some maybe be wondering why you
[34:06] know after 11 years would i decide to go
[34:08] back into the ministry
[34:11] well you know i think about it and you
[34:13] think why would you do that
[34:15] well brothers and sisters it's a late
[34:16] hour it's a really late hour
[34:19] and we're witnessing the world crumbling
[34:22] around us and as we sit back and we
[34:25] watch and you know you can't help but
[34:26] see what's going on in the news and
[34:27] things that's going on and the world is
[34:29] just falling apart
[34:31] a good friend of mine called me the
[34:32] other day he's a baptist pastor
[34:35] in hopkinsville and he was talking and
[34:38] we were talking about the world events
[34:39] and things going on
[34:41] and as we were talking we got down and
[34:44] he said
[34:45] you know remember me and mom in prayer
[34:48] his mom was going through pancreatic
[34:49] cancer and
[34:50] any of you know anything about it and
[34:51] had any identification with that it's
[34:53] it's not a good
[34:55] it's not a good diagnosis to have and
[34:57] just a sweet lady
[34:59] mary crawford's her name if you just uh
[35:01] lift her up in your prayers
[35:03] but uh he asked me he said just pray for
[35:06] us
[35:07] and so you know i sit in there and it
[35:09] just so happened you know sometimes
[35:10] people ask you to pray for them and
[35:12] and you not you know you're not in the
[35:13] in a place where you can just sit down
[35:15] and really dedicate
[35:16] the time and put forth the effort to to
[35:19] pray at that very moment but
[35:20] it just so happened that that i was kind
[35:23] of
[35:23] out just exploring the woods when i was
[35:25] talking to him on the phone
[35:27] and i sat down beside a on a little
[35:29] falling over tree over
[35:31] over a little branch there and i just
[35:33] sat down and i began to pray and
[35:34] thinking about the things that we had
[35:36] talked about and as i prayed i sat there
[35:39] and i said lord
[35:40] i don't even know how to pray how do you
[35:42] pray for our country how do you pray for
[35:44] our world how do you
[35:45] how do you pray for that when you see
[35:47] the things falling apart and crumbling
[35:49] how do you pray and i sat there for a
[35:51] minute and the more i thought about it
[35:53] and thought about our government and
[35:55] and how things you know the patriotic
[35:56] side and you man you want to see the
[35:58] country strike
[35:59] you know thrive you want to see uh you
[36:01] want to see things go good because we're
[36:03] raised americans we're patriotic
[36:06] but on the flip side we know what the
[36:07] prophet said and so i sat there
[36:10] and it just like the spirit just spoke
[36:11] to me and said
[36:13] come lord come that's all you can pray
[36:17] come lord come because the times are not
[36:19] it's not going to get any easier
[36:21] and if you believe that i'm afraid
[36:23] you've got false hope
[36:25] because we know what the prophets told
[36:26] us uh brother branham said in the 50s he
[36:28] said they thought they could fix the
[36:30] world with a democracy
[36:31] he said that didn't work he said they
[36:33] thought they could fix it with a
[36:34] dictator
[36:35] he said that didn't work so the only
[36:37] thing we've got to get us out of here is
[36:39] jesus
[36:40] christ so
[36:43] you know sometimes i think about the
[36:47] last 11 years
[36:50] and i think man what a waste of time
[36:51] what what what time i've wasted
[36:54] and you know that's probably a lot of
[36:56] truth in that but i can't turn back time
[36:59] i can only i can only pick up from today
[37:00] and go forward
[37:03] and i'll be honest with you because i
[37:04] think that's the best way to to handle
[37:06] situations
[37:08] is to just be honest and get it out get
[37:10] things out in the open
[37:13] we went through things my family that
[37:15] that that hurt i mean that's all you can
[37:17] say
[37:18] we had hurt feelings we had anger issues
[37:21] i mean it was uh you know there's things
[37:22] you have to overcome and anybody knows
[37:24] that you cannot
[37:25] minister to the people you cannot bring
[37:27] education to christ
[37:29] if uh if you got those things in your
[37:32] in your life so by god's grace
[37:35] everything is fine
[37:36] um you know we've overcome all of that
[37:39] uh we had to get softened back down we
[37:41] had to do some exploring for ourselves
[37:43] or our family
[37:44] we had to just kind of get away for a
[37:46] while and and get to a place to where we
[37:48] could regroup ourselves
[37:50] uh because we were kind of in a we felt
[37:52] like just kind of in limbo of where we
[37:54] were at and what we were doing
[37:55] so but god has god has been good to us
[37:58] he's made a way
[38:00] um and you know after we softened back
[38:02] up
[38:03] i guess in the last couple years we
[38:05] entered in or i entered into i guess
[38:07] that
[38:08] deal making stage i'm sure some of you
[38:11] have been there with god before
[38:13] god if you'll do this i'll do that uh if
[38:15] you'll if you'll
[38:16] provide this i'll go here i'll do this
[38:19] we've probably all
[38:20] been guilty of that and it's kind of a
[38:22] funny thing how
[38:23] our minds our human minds think that we
[38:26] can make a deal with god
[38:27] and somebody who's never lost before so
[38:30] we you know
[38:30] he's always going to come out on the
[38:32] wind inside no matter where we're at so
[38:34] um long story short i'm going to get uh
[38:37] get through the testimony part and get
[38:39] into the word here in just a minute
[38:41] um but god has provided in such a way i
[38:44] said god
[38:46] i'm in a you know i'm in a job that i
[38:48] cannot
[38:49] feel like i cannot minister and be
[38:52] effective and put in the time and effort
[38:54] with the job that i'm in
[38:56] i had a good job i was director of
[38:58] nursing for seven years
[39:01] my wife and hannah and brother troy know
[39:04] what go into that
[39:05] and it's such high level stress that it
[39:08] really
[39:09] uh you just you just can't imagine this
[39:11] the stress level
[39:13] my wife tried it for a little while and
[39:15] it didn't work too well for her so
[39:17] by god's grace she's got a new job today
[39:19] too but
[39:21] so i said god you know you're gonna have
[39:23] to provide me a job to where
[39:25] i can have the time and the ability to
[39:28] put in the effort and the study
[39:30] like i need to have so
[39:33] i began to look in i actually went
[39:34] through a little campaign phase there
[39:38] where i was running for an office for a
[39:39] public position
[39:41] we didn't win that i was kind of
[39:42] discouraging it there but i thought you
[39:44] know
[39:45] that's not what god wanted me to be
[39:46] that's not that's not the job i needed
[39:48] to be doing what god needs me to do
[39:50] so we didn't cry over spilled milk we
[39:52] just moved on with life
[39:54] and i was sitting there one day at work
[39:57] out in the parking lot
[39:58] trying to think you know just kind of
[40:00] praying and
[40:01] the lord kind of spoke to me and he said
[40:03] just call so and so
[40:05] so it's actually the the boss that i
[40:08] have now
[40:09] i called him i said gary are you
[40:12] by any chance are you looking for
[40:14] anybody a nurse a registered nurse
[40:16] to do some consultant work for you and i
[40:19] said you know most pharmacies have that
[40:21] and then when they deal with long-term
[40:23] care they have a consultant go in
[40:25] and he said i've been needing to do that
[40:26] for about 10 years
[40:28] and he said let me think about it and
[40:31] i'll get back with you well time went on
[40:33] week two weeks i think about three weeks
[40:35] and finally
[40:36] the phone rang one day and i didn't even
[40:38] recognize the number
[40:39] and uh i answered the phone and it was
[40:41] gary and he said brad i said
[40:43] yes sir and he said he said i want to
[40:45] offer you a job
[40:47] and so i thought man how does god how
[40:49] does god know how to do that god moves
[40:51] in such a way
[40:52] that he can make a way when there seems
[40:54] no way to be made
[40:56] it was actually a dream job you know i
[40:59] couldn't ask for a better job
[41:00] nursing i couldn't ask for a better boss
[41:03] his family his family owned pharmacy
[41:06] they're a christian family you go into
[41:08] the pharmacy they have christian music
[41:10] playing not
[41:10] rock and roll or you know but they have
[41:12] christian music playing inside the
[41:14] pharmacy
[41:14] and so i you know you just can't hardly
[41:17] get much better than that it's been such
[41:18] a blessing for us
[41:20] and we're thankful for that and so then
[41:22] i thought well
[41:24] i'm going to try them again because you
[41:26] know sometimes we want to make a lot of
[41:28] deals
[41:29] and i said well god i've got this house
[41:31] and
[41:32] we need to we need to downsize and it's
[41:35] just more than we need to take on it's
[41:37] more than
[41:37] more than i want to manage um you know
[41:40] when you're young and ambitious
[41:41] sometimes you think bigger is better and
[41:44] so here we were in our
[41:45] early 40s with a 3 600 square foot house
[41:49] no need of half of that so i said god
[41:54] if you if you'll help us get rid of this
[41:56] house i'll consider
[41:58] getting back in the ministry you know
[42:00] it's just the way you do it's just the
[42:01] way you work
[42:02] and and i thought well this this will be
[42:05] the end of it here because nobody
[42:06] in todd county is going to come by this
[42:08] house 3 600 square foot
[42:11] there's just not that big of a market
[42:13] well within i think it was within three
[42:15] months
[42:15] we we pretty much had closed on it and a
[42:19] family from pennsylvania had come down
[42:20] and bought it so you know that's just
[42:22] the way god works
[42:24] god will make a way and we're thankful
[42:26] for that god's been very good to us
[42:30] and you know
[42:33] i need your help this morning so you
[42:36] know the preacher can only preach
[42:38] if he can get himself out of the way and
[42:41] part of getting yourself out of the way
[42:42] is getting over your nerves and
[42:44] uh i'm nervous i mean you can tell i'm
[42:47] sure
[42:48] but we'll we'll move forward and see but
[42:50] i just need you to pull
[42:51] pull on the gift i don't know how long
[42:52] we'll go this morning
[42:54] i know the very first message i preached
[42:57] brother byler talked about it the other
[42:58] day
[42:59] the heart of a thoroughbred we were in
[43:01] the little church and i preached on that
[43:03] and about the life of seabiscuit and i
[43:05] can remember
[43:07] i'm in my early 20s i guess and
[43:10] and i remember working up that message
[43:13] and getting my notes together and i was
[43:15] thinking in my
[43:15] in my room there and i thought man i
[43:18] hope i don't hold them people over two
[43:19] hours
[43:20] they'll kill me i think about 20 minutes
[43:22] later we were
[43:24] we were done we were out so
[43:27] you know sometimes you uh you think and
[43:30] you
[43:31] and you try and you push and you go
[43:32] forward but uh it all works out man i
[43:35] found out though one thing about
[43:36] preaching it's not about
[43:38] the qual the quantity it's not how long
[43:40] you go
[43:41] it's about the quality it's about what's
[43:42] said when you're there
[43:44] so um if we go for 30 minutes that'll be
[43:47] fine if we go an hour that'll be fine
[43:50] 20 minutes that's what we'll do so let's
[43:54] stand if you would let's go before the
[43:55] lord in prayer this morning
[44:00] let's bow our heads heavenly father
[44:03] we're certainly thankful lord be in your
[44:04] house and for the opportunity to come
[44:06] and
[44:07] speak to your people this morning lord
[44:08] and lord you know i've had the
[44:10] opportunity to
[44:11] to speak in front of people in the past
[44:14] lord and
[44:14] i've been able to sit down and talk to
[44:17] different politicians and governors and
[44:19] and so forth and lord there's nothing
[44:21] ever like stepping before the bride of
[44:23] jesus christ
[44:24] it's such an honor and a privilege
[44:26] responsibility lord lord we just asked
[44:28] or that you would just help us this
[44:29] morning
[44:30] to get ourselves out of the way we just
[44:32] asked or that you would move in a cert
[44:34] in a special way that you would meet the
[44:35] needs
[44:36] of the people to be an encouragement to
[44:38] the people lord and we just want to tell
[44:40] you we love you and we appreciate you
[44:41] and we thank you for the lord for all
[44:42] that you do for us
[44:43] draw us close to you through this
[44:45] service in christ's name amen
[44:47] turn in your bibles if you would to
[44:49] genesis chapter 37
[45:02] i tell you the devil's really been
[45:04] trying to get at people i think here
[45:06] recently with this
[45:07] not only covid but allergies and i know
[45:10] he's been
[45:11] hounding me over the last few days with
[45:12] cough and allergies and
[45:15] and it's drainage so we'll all bind
[45:18] together today and
[45:19] and rebuke that devil in the name of the
[45:20] lord jesus
[45:22] um genesis chapter 37
[45:27] and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his
[45:29] father was a stranger
[45:31] in the land of canaan and these are the
[45:33] generations of jacob
[45:35] joseph being 17 years old was feeding
[45:38] the flock of with his brethren
[45:40] and the lad was with the sons of bilhah
[45:42] and the sons of zilpha
[45:44] and his father his father's wives and
[45:47] joseph brought unto his father
[45:49] their evil report so we look at joseph
[45:51] here just as we kind of go down through
[45:53] here and we see that joseph
[45:54] he was doing exactly what he was
[45:55] supposed to do he was supposed to be the
[45:57] one to come back and report to his
[45:59] father because we know
[46:00] that joseph was the one most loved by
[46:02] his father he had trust
[46:04] his father had trust in him so he would
[46:05] come back and tell and that didn't work
[46:07] out real good for joseph with him and
[46:09] his brothers okay
[46:12] now israel loved joseph more than all
[46:14] his children because
[46:15] because he was the son of his old age
[46:17] and he made him a code of many colors
[46:19] and when his brethren saw that their
[46:20] father loved him more than all his
[46:23] brethren
[46:23] they hated him they could not speak
[46:26] peace
[46:26] peaceably unto him and joseph dreamed
[46:30] a dream and he told his brethren and
[46:33] they hated him
[46:34] yet the more so here's twice right here
[46:37] immediately in the scriptures that he's
[46:39] been hated by his brothers
[46:40] the more he tries to do to please god
[46:42] the more he tries to do to please his
[46:44] father
[46:44] he's hated even the more and he said
[46:47] unto them here i pray you
[46:49] this dream which i have dreamed for
[46:52] behold
[46:53] we were binding sheaves in the field and
[46:56] lo
[46:57] my sheaf arose and stood upright and
[47:00] behold
[47:01] your sheaves stood round about and made
[47:03] obeisance
[47:05] to my sheaf so what is that word
[47:07] obeisance so we look at that and we
[47:08] found out that the word obeisance i
[47:10] looked that up
[47:10] and it means to make a body of in token
[47:14] of res
[47:14] of respect or submission so he's mad
[47:17] they've his
[47:18] these sheaves have now laid themselves
[47:20] down into submission
[47:22] now how do you think that made the the
[47:23] mother brothers feel when he told them
[47:25] that he's the 11th born
[47:27] out of 12 and benjamin's just a child
[47:29] and here his other brothers are sitting
[47:31] there and and
[47:31] he's saying you're going to bow down to
[47:33] me and his brethren said unto him shall
[47:35] we indeed
[47:36] reign over us or shall thou indeed have
[47:39] dominion over us
[47:40] and they hated him yet the more for his
[47:43] dreams
[47:44] and his words and he dreamed yet another
[47:47] dream
[47:48] and he told his brother and said behold
[47:50] i have dreamed a dream more
[47:52] and behold the sun and the moon and the
[47:54] eleven stars
[47:55] made obeisance to me and he told it to
[47:59] his father
[48:00] and to his brethren and his father
[48:01] rebuked him
[48:03] and said unto him what is this dream
[48:06] that thou has dreamed
[48:07] shall i my thy mother and thy brethren
[48:10] indeed come
[48:11] to bow down ourselves to thee to the
[48:13] earth
[48:14] and his brethren envied him but his
[48:17] father observed the same
[48:19] you may have your seats but the lord add
[48:20] his blessings to the reading of the word
[48:23] another little scripture that i just
[48:24] want to quote real quick is uh hebrews
[48:27] chapter 13 and eight very familiar
[48:29] scripture to us jesus christ the same
[48:31] yesterday today
[48:33] and forever those three little words
[48:35] yesterday today and forever the prophet
[48:37] used those words 3036 times in his
[48:40] messages
[48:40] over the time so those three words
[48:42] yesterday today and forever
[48:44] must have some significant importance
[48:46] into the life of the believer to build
[48:48] the faith
[48:49] to get us to where we need to be so
[48:51] yesterday today and forever
[48:53] and i want to take just for a little
[48:54] thought this morning on the word
[48:57] yesterday yesterday now we all know what
[49:00] the word yesterday refers to it refers
[49:02] to the day before
[49:04] today and if you think about what
[49:06] yesterday is
[49:07] yesterday defines who you are who i
[49:11] am today so yesterday begins to mold our
[49:14] character
[49:15] yesterday builds our faith up to a place
[49:18] that we can get closer to god
[49:19] or yesterday takes us into a place that
[49:22] we become
[49:23] further away from god yesterday can
[49:25] either strengthen us
[49:26] and draw us closer to god make us strong
[49:29] in the word or yesterday could take us
[49:31] to a place that we become
[49:32] weak and undedicated in god yesterday
[49:35] could possibly be the most important day
[49:37] of your life we don't think about that
[49:41] but how we handle yesterday makes us who
[49:44] we are i mean look around
[49:45] brothers and sisters everybody in here
[49:47] lived yesterday right
[49:48] if we're breathing today we lived
[49:50] yesterday so what does yesterday
[49:53] do for you how did it define you think
[49:56] about your yesterday what happened
[49:57] yesterday
[49:58] did you go through struggles yesterday
[50:00] did you find yourself in a place that
[50:02] you relied upon you had to rely upon god
[50:04] maybe god felt like you felt like god
[50:06] wasn't there
[50:07] did you find yourself in a place that
[50:09] you were just getting up there on top of
[50:11] the world and you felt like you were as
[50:12] close as you could be
[50:14] yesterday what happened yesterday
[50:17] because it makes us who we are today
[50:20] that's why brothers and sisters we need
[50:22] to have god
[50:23] first and foremost in our life and
[50:25] everything we do
[50:30] many times we look at the word yesterday
[50:34] and we can grow in yesterday
[50:37] we've all been there in a place in our
[50:39] life i'm sure
[50:40] when everything is good life is good the
[50:42] preacher preached a great service
[50:44] my goodness all the bills are paid the
[50:46] refrigerator is full
[50:47] the kids all get along everything's
[50:50] going just fine
[50:51] god's moving in our life and nothing can
[50:53] ever go wrong
[50:54] been there we've been there
[50:57] or have you ever found yourself defeated
[51:00] in yesterday
[51:01] when it's when where before nothing
[51:03] could go wrong but now nothing goes
[51:05] right
[51:06] now nothing goes right and you find
[51:08] yourself uh the preacher he didn't even
[51:10] know you were there
[51:11] at church your spirit's deflated the
[51:13] frigerator broke down
[51:14] you don't have enough money at the end
[51:16] of the month and now you're sitting here
[51:18] and you're saying oh my goodness life is
[51:20] horrible god where are you
[51:21] at how many has been there
[51:26] so did god forsake you at that time did
[51:29] god leave you and walk away and say
[51:31] you're on your own now buddy
[51:33] no he was there all the time but
[51:36] sometimes we
[51:37] fail to put god in a place of today
[51:40] we fail to put god in a current
[51:42] situation where we have to rely upon god
[51:45] we leave him out in the past
[51:49] listen to what the prophet said 58
[51:53] lifting him up out of history we are the
[51:56] people today of his pasture
[51:58] we are the sheep of his fold and he's
[52:00] waiting on us to stand
[52:02] and call him into action
[52:07] call him upon the scene watch him go
[52:10] into movements
[52:11] watch him do the supreme watch him do
[52:15] the thing that
[52:16] man will wonder and scratch their heads
[52:19] and not understand it
[52:23] the world can't understand the way god
[52:25] moves
[52:26] the world don't understand how god could
[52:28] come into
[52:30] a god of history a god of joseph a god
[52:32] of
[52:33] mary a god of all these different
[52:34] characters in the bible how he can come
[52:36] back into a present day
[52:37] in your life today and move on the scene
[52:41] the world does not understand that
[52:43] listen what he said he's a historical
[52:45] god
[52:46] and a present day god he's waiting
[52:50] to be called out of history
[52:54] he's waiting on us to call him
[52:57] out of history when you're going through
[52:59] those laws in life when things are not
[53:00] going good
[53:01] god is sitting there and he's just
[53:03] waiting
[53:09] that's why we have to realize who we are
[53:13] let's look at joseph the life of joseph
[53:15] a little bit and let's just see how god
[53:17] moved out throughout his life
[53:19] so joseph we looked at he's a born the
[53:22] 11th child of 12
[53:24] loved the most by his father so much
[53:27] that his father makes him a
[53:28] special coat a coat of privilege a coat
[53:31] of many colors to recognize him as
[53:33] you're my favorite boy that had to be
[53:36] tough
[53:38] i was an only child man i'm telling you
[53:41] if you was the child of 11 and
[53:42] and you're publicly made hey this is my
[53:46] bright and shining star right here
[53:50] and i see you over there
[53:55] so joseph is now carrying this burden
[53:59] that he's the greatest of his brothers
[54:02] maybe he could have got into his head
[54:03] just a little bit
[54:05] and he begins to take responsibility
[54:07] because he was a responsible person
[54:09] his father knew that his father knew he
[54:11] was responsible
[54:12] so one day he sends joseph out into the
[54:14] field to go find his brothers and make
[54:16] sure that they're tending to the flocks
[54:18] fine
[54:19] so they're sitting out there and as
[54:20] joseph's beginning to walk through the
[54:22] field
[54:22] his brothers see him coming and
[54:24] immediately
[54:25] that hatred begins to bowl that hatred
[54:29] that we've seen before where he said i
[54:32] dreamed a dream
[54:33] and i seen you guys fall down at my feet
[54:37] and i've seen you submit to me that they
[54:40] remember that and that hatred begins to
[54:42] bull
[54:42] and bull and ball up in them and they
[54:44] look at him and they say
[54:46] you know what we're going to do we'll
[54:48] kill him
[54:49] if we take him off the scene there will
[54:51] be no dream to come to pass
[54:53] we'll just move him completely out of
[54:55] the scene and then we'll be on our own
[54:57] we don't have to worry about that little
[54:58] brother of ours no more
[55:00] just get him out of the way but
[55:01] thankfully reuben
[55:03] stepped up and said no we can't kill him
[55:07] he is our own blood we can't kill him so
[55:10] they put put together another plan and
[55:12] they say well just throw him in this pit
[55:14] we'll just leave him in there for now
[55:15] can you imagine a 17 year old boy
[55:18] going out there to be with your family
[55:20] and they throw you into a pit
[55:22] and there's joseph out there crying and
[55:24] crying help me brothers
[55:26] let me out of this pit why are you
[55:28] keeping me in here brothers
[55:29] let me out of here please brothers
[55:32] 17 years old i've got a 16 year old
[55:36] there's other young people here i
[55:38] wouldn't want to see my child at 17
[55:40] crying in a pit not knowing if he's
[55:42] going to live or die
[55:43] but that's exactly what they did to him
[55:45] put him in this pit
[55:47] until this group of slave traders come
[55:49] by so here you have these
[55:51] flights come by they're slave traders
[55:53] and reuben says we'll just sell him
[55:55] just sell him get him out of our lives
[55:57] and get him out of our way we'll go back
[55:59] we'll tell father that he was killed and
[56:02] so that's what they did they took it he
[56:03] took his his precious coat
[56:05] everything has symbolism so his his
[56:08] token of
[56:08] of of superiority they take it and they
[56:11] dip it in goat's blood and take it back
[56:13] to jacob
[56:14] and say now look sorry dad we found this
[56:18] on the road
[56:19] joseph was killed joseph was killed
[56:27] but that was yesterday
[56:31] that was yesterday so now he's in this
[56:35] slave trade
[56:36] and he's going there these ishmaelites
[56:38] they come and they go before
[56:39] the egyptians and there's potiphar and
[56:42] potiphar who is a chief
[56:44] chief of the uh of the masters to the to
[56:46] the pharaoh
[56:47] and he's chief counsel to him and
[56:49] potiphar looks at him
[56:50] and he sees joseph and he's like man
[56:52] there's something different about this
[56:54] guy
[56:55] there's something different than him
[56:56] than all the rest of the slaves
[56:58] i don't know what it is i can't put my
[57:00] finger on it but i want him
[57:02] so potiphar begins to look at him and
[57:04] then potiphar takes him back down to his
[57:06] house
[57:07] in slavery now but when you look at the
[57:09] bible what does it say and the lord
[57:12] was with joseph
[57:18] and he was a prosperous man
[57:22] wow so yesterday he's in a pit
[57:26] and he's struggling for his very life
[57:28] and he's been sold into slavery
[57:30] but now here he is the lord is with him
[57:33] in slavery
[57:34] he's a prosperous man and it says that
[57:37] that the master even saw that the lord
[57:40] was with him
[57:41] now you tell me that's not a shining but
[57:44] there's not an aura around somebody
[57:46] when a master of egypt can look at an
[57:49] israelite and say
[57:51] god is with him the lord is with him
[57:54] and he said the lord saw that the master
[57:56] saw the lord was with him
[57:58] and the lord made all that he did to
[58:00] prosper
[58:01] in his hand wow
[58:08] me just read the rest of this to you and
[58:10] joseph found grace in his sight
[58:13] he served him he made him overseer of
[58:16] his house
[58:21] and all that he had put into his hand
[58:23] and it came to pass from
[58:24] from the time that he had made him
[58:26] overseer in the house and over all that
[58:28] he had
[58:29] that the lord blessed the egyptians
[58:32] house
[58:34] for joseph's satan wow you think god
[58:37] can't take a bad situation
[58:39] and turn it around to make you supreme
[58:43] god can take any kind of bad that you're
[58:45] going through
[58:46] and step right in slide right in there
[58:48] and turn the ti
[58:49] the tides to where the enemy serving you
[58:53] he had so much confidence in joseph a
[58:56] slave
[58:57] that he made him ruler of his house so
[59:00] you understand when potiphar left
[59:02] he didn't call one of the other
[59:03] egyptians to come over and oversee his
[59:04] house
[59:05] he said joseph come over here and
[59:08] oversee my house while i'm gone
[59:11] brothers and sisters joseph didn't allow
[59:13] the struggles
[59:14] of yesterday he didn't allow the
[59:17] struggles of his new life of slavery
[59:19] to hinder him from going forward with
[59:21] god
[59:23] now can you imagine in the back of his
[59:24] mind he still has to be thinking why did
[59:27] they get rid of me
[59:28] what did i do because he just thought he
[59:30] was doing what he was supposed to do
[59:32] he was following the father's orders and
[59:34] he was dreaming what god made him dream
[59:37] what did he do he wasn't malicious in
[59:40] anything he'd done
[59:41] so in the back of his mind he still has
[59:42] to be thinking i wonder if benjamin's
[59:44] okay i wonder how my father's doing
[59:47] i wonder if he's still living working
[59:50] for potiphar
[59:52] giving everything he's got to egypt
[59:55] working for potiphar
[59:57] how easy it would have been for joseph
[1:00:01] to turn from god
[1:00:05] where would you i mean don't answer out
[1:00:07] loud
[1:00:09] but where would you be what would you be
[1:00:12] thinking
[1:00:13] god where are you i've done everything
[1:00:16] up to this time
[1:00:17] i've followed all the commandments
[1:00:18] you've ever given me where are you now
[1:00:22] he could have easily said that joseph
[1:00:24] could have easily took that
[1:00:26] that route he could have become so
[1:00:28] wretched towards god
[1:00:31] but he didn't life was good
[1:00:35] his master blessed him his master was
[1:00:37] pleased with him his master gave him
[1:00:39] everything that he needed
[1:00:40] he made him overseer of the house he was
[1:00:42] the man in charge
[1:00:46] life's good but that was yesterday
[1:00:50] you see every day we live builds our
[1:00:53] character
[1:00:54] every day the things we go through makes
[1:00:56] us who we are
[1:00:57] it makes us stronger it gives us our
[1:00:59] christian character
[1:01:01] so here now you see life gives us these
[1:01:03] ups and downs
[1:01:04] just like it did for joseph and so
[1:01:06] things were going well
[1:01:08] and who steps in potiphar's wife
[1:01:13] she sees how goodly that joseph is
[1:01:17] because he's a goodly man and she calls
[1:01:20] on him
[1:01:21] joseph come away with me
[1:01:25] hold up joseph said no ma'am
[1:01:28] i won't have any part of that so what
[1:01:31] does she do but she grabs his garments
[1:01:33] pulls him out pulls the garments off of
[1:01:35] his back
[1:01:35] and makes it look like that he tried to
[1:01:37] ravish her
[1:01:39] and then she begins to put him into a
[1:01:40] place and she's crying out to all the
[1:01:42] people of egypt look what this man has
[1:01:44] done did you bring him here to make a
[1:01:46] mockery of us
[1:01:50] wow what option
[1:01:53] did potiphar have he had no
[1:01:57] option but to put joseph in the
[1:02:00] in the prison into bondage so here the
[1:02:04] man that was in charge
[1:02:05] is now the man in chains and there's
[1:02:07] something how things change from one day
[1:02:09] to the other
[1:02:17] chapter 39 this is a
[1:02:20] good three or four chapters there that
[1:02:22] you go through but we're not gonna hit
[1:02:23] them all
[1:02:25] but chapter 39
[1:02:31] we see joseph in prison what we just
[1:02:33] talked about
[1:02:36] in verse 21 what does it say
[1:02:40] does anybody got it the lord
[1:02:44] was with joseph
[1:02:48] wow man we think we've got it hard
[1:02:51] sometimes
[1:02:52] we think we've got it really really bad
[1:02:55] sometimes
[1:02:57] i don't i i don't know anybody that's
[1:02:59] ever been thrown in a pit to die
[1:03:02] if you have see me after service
[1:03:06] if you've been left to slavery if you've
[1:03:08] been put in bondage
[1:03:10] if you've been falsely accused
[1:03:14] in such a way that joseph was but
[1:03:19] the lord was with him
[1:03:22] the lord was with joseph and showed him
[1:03:24] mercy
[1:03:25] let me just show you how much god cares
[1:03:27] about where we're at in our life
[1:03:30] joseph is now in the prison he's now in
[1:03:32] chains he's now in bondage
[1:03:34] and he's sitting there and what does the
[1:03:35] next verse say god gave him
[1:03:38] favor in the sight of the keeper
[1:03:41] of the prison brothers and sisters that
[1:03:45] ought to be our prayer
[1:03:46] every day god give me favor
[1:03:49] in those i come in contact with we need
[1:03:52] to be in favor of those we come in
[1:03:54] contact with
[1:03:55] that way we have an advantage now joseph
[1:03:58] because of who he was because god was
[1:04:00] with him
[1:04:01] god gave him favor to the keeper of the
[1:04:03] prison now he's in a different place
[1:04:06] god can make your worst enemy have favor
[1:04:09] on you
[1:04:15] the keeper of the prison left joseph in
[1:04:17] charge
[1:04:19] isn't that something you got a prisoner
[1:04:21] watching prisoners that don't go too
[1:04:23] well in todd county jail
[1:04:26] i don't know about the egyptian jail but
[1:04:28] he had some kind of confidence
[1:04:30] in joseph
[1:04:34] let's jump off of joseph for just a
[1:04:36] minute
[1:04:38] let's look at shamgar for a minute
[1:04:43] so there was shamgar
[1:04:46] he's there setting sitting there in his
[1:04:48] day the philistines
[1:04:50] they had come in there were no judges in
[1:04:53] israel so
[1:04:54] philistines had run of the land they
[1:04:55] could go anywhere they wanted to do
[1:04:57] anything they wanted to do to anybody
[1:04:59] nobody was going to stop them
[1:05:01] so here's shamgar
[1:05:05] and shamgar standing there and last year
[1:05:10] yesterday they took everything that he
[1:05:14] had
[1:05:14] to feed his family to feed his wife to
[1:05:16] feed his kids
[1:05:18] to feed his livestock now can you
[1:05:20] imagine you work all year long
[1:05:22] to put put aside and you have to store
[1:05:24] this grain for the next year's crop
[1:05:26] and you've got all this in place and
[1:05:28] here comes these these philistines come
[1:05:30] in and take
[1:05:30] everything that you've got
[1:05:36] said he was standing there and he's
[1:05:37] looking at his wife her shirt sleeves
[1:05:39] was torn
[1:05:40] she didn't have clothes fitting to where
[1:05:42] the kids didn't have no shoes
[1:05:43] the kids were barefooted
[1:05:46] and he said he can see him standing
[1:05:48] there
[1:05:50] and says well wife dear
[1:05:53] i suppose maybe this winter we won't
[1:05:55] starve
[1:05:59] wow what relief when shamgar he's
[1:06:02] sitting there and he says
[1:06:03] wow god has blessed us we come through
[1:06:06] the
[1:06:06] worst worst event we've ever been
[1:06:08] through in our life when the philistines
[1:06:09] took everything we had last year
[1:06:11] and now we've got grain we've got enough
[1:06:14] wheat
[1:06:14] we've got enough we can feed the kids we
[1:06:16] can make some porridge for breakfast
[1:06:19] i guess we're going to be all right
[1:06:25] he says this maybe i can even sell a
[1:06:28] little
[1:06:29] and get you some clothes now what an
[1:06:32] honor it must have been for shamgar you
[1:06:34] know how humiliated he must have felt
[1:06:36] from the prior year knowing that the
[1:06:39] philistines had come and robbed him of
[1:06:41] everything he had in his life
[1:06:43] then he only robbed from him they stole
[1:06:46] from his wife
[1:06:47] his kids he took their clothes took
[1:06:50] their their
[1:06:51] their food all this was surrounded
[1:06:53] they're green they had to have the green
[1:06:56] maybe i could sell a little bit and get
[1:06:58] you some clothes
[1:07:00] then he heard something thump thump
[1:07:04] thump thumb
[1:07:07] thump thump
[1:07:10] the familiar sound of marching soldiers
[1:07:16] can you imagine the the the feeling his
[1:07:19] heart must have had
[1:07:20] and the as he must have fell down to his
[1:07:22] lowest point back
[1:07:23] and remembered everything that happened
[1:07:24] the year before
[1:07:29] he said he looked out the window and
[1:07:30] raised the barn door
[1:07:32] and saw 600 men
[1:07:37] prophet said they were big fat fellas
[1:07:39] walking up there
[1:07:43] so you know sham garden had no grain so
[1:07:45] he wasn't no big fat fella
[1:07:49] so here was this man who had had
[1:07:53] lost everything and you got these big
[1:07:56] fat soldiers walking up with armor and
[1:07:58] shields
[1:07:59] and he looks over and they're there to
[1:08:00] take his his food
[1:08:02] and to rob him once again and he looked
[1:08:04] over at his little wife brother branham
[1:08:06] said and shamgar said he could see the
[1:08:07] tears running down his face
[1:08:10] he knew what was coming brother sister
[1:08:13] sometimes in
[1:08:14] life we see things coming before they
[1:08:17] ever get there
[1:08:18] and it's almost like watching a train
[1:08:20] wreck
[1:08:21] you don't want to see it but you can't
[1:08:23] take your eyes off of it it's coming our
[1:08:25] way you can hear the train coming
[1:08:28] shamgar was here in a place he could
[1:08:30] hear the train
[1:08:31] coming destruction was in his path
[1:08:35] and he looked out there and he said i'm
[1:08:36] just a farmer
[1:08:38] i can't fight them i'm outnumbered
[1:08:40] they're 600 to my one
[1:08:42] what could i do brothers and sisters
[1:08:45] that was yesterday
[1:08:46] that was yesterday because today he rose
[1:08:49] up and he said i
[1:08:50] am an israelite i am an israelite
[1:08:54] i have been circumcised i have the
[1:08:56] covenant of the lord
[1:08:58] and today i am not a farmer but a
[1:09:00] warrior
[1:09:01] so shamgar goes out there with an ox
[1:09:03] goat
[1:09:05] a stick with a brass horn on it and he
[1:09:07] begins to beat
[1:09:09] and beat and beat can you imagine as the
[1:09:11] holy spirit must have swept through that
[1:09:13] land
[1:09:13] as body was falling left and right left
[1:09:16] and right one after another
[1:09:17] how much did it looked when he got done
[1:09:27] what did he do he brought god on the
[1:09:30] scene
[1:09:33] he didn't just settle for a god of
[1:09:35] history
[1:09:36] but he brought god on the scene he
[1:09:39] wasn't bound to the fear of yesterday
[1:09:42] he wasn't bound to the fear of losing
[1:09:44] everything he had
[1:09:45] he wasn't bound to the fear of watching
[1:09:47] his children starved to death
[1:09:49] or his wife starved to death with no
[1:09:51] clothes
[1:09:52] he wasn't bound to that he brought a
[1:09:55] present-day god
[1:09:56] on the scene
[1:10:04] two thousand years ago
[1:10:08] jewish jewish law stated
[1:10:13] that the consequence of adultery was to
[1:10:16] literally be dragged out into the
[1:10:17] outskirts of the city
[1:10:19] and be stoned to death
[1:10:22] they didn't play
[1:10:26] so on this particular day the jewish
[1:10:29] authorities are walking through the
[1:10:30] streets
[1:10:31] they get word of a young lady who's
[1:10:34] found herself in a place that she didn't
[1:10:36] belong
[1:10:38] they get her they catch her in the very
[1:10:41] act of adultery
[1:10:45] there's no doubt about it she's guilty
[1:10:48] no doubt about it what could she say
[1:10:50] caught in the very act
[1:10:52] news begins to spread you know how small
[1:10:54] towns are
[1:10:56] town knows more about you than you know
[1:10:57] about yourself
[1:10:59] so here the news begins to spread in
[1:11:01] this little town and they begin to come
[1:11:03] and the crowd gets bigger
[1:11:05] and bigger and bigger and you got more
[1:11:08] stone throwers
[1:11:09] and more stone throwers and they grow in
[1:11:12] number
[1:11:13] you know everybody wants to do their
[1:11:14] part when it comes to keeping law
[1:11:18] you see that a lot of times in church
[1:11:19] everybody wants to do their part when
[1:11:21] they know the law
[1:11:26] same thing happened here in this city
[1:11:27] we've got stones we called her
[1:11:29] and we want to know what you got to say
[1:11:31] jesus so here now is jesus
[1:11:34] in the streets and they approach him and
[1:11:36] they're going to try to find him and
[1:11:37] catch him off guard so they go up to
[1:11:40] jesus
[1:11:41] and they begin to look at him and they
[1:11:43] say rabbi which means master
[1:11:47] this woman has been caught in the very
[1:11:49] act of adultery
[1:11:51] the law says we will stone her to death
[1:11:56] what do you say
[1:12:00] listen listen
[1:12:05] that's what we heard silence
[1:12:09] the hush of an atmosphere so quiet that
[1:12:12] you could have heard a pin drop
[1:12:14] they were looking and wanting some big
[1:12:16] great words of wisdom from jesus
[1:12:18] and he simply sits there silent
[1:12:21] while all these stone throwers are
[1:12:23] sitting there just palms sweating ready
[1:12:25] to throw just
[1:12:26] ready just grimacing on their face let's
[1:12:29] kill her
[1:12:31] and jesus simply
[1:12:35] bends down kneels down on the ground and
[1:12:38] begins to write
[1:12:46] and he says you without sin
[1:12:50] cast the first stone
[1:12:54] i don't know what he wrote
[1:12:58] i'd like to know i've often thought
[1:13:00] maybe he just wrote pardoned
[1:13:04] pardon for that young lady
[1:13:07] you without sin cast the first stone if
[1:13:10] you've done nothing wrong before
[1:13:12] cast the stone and one
[1:13:16] by one the stones begin to drop
[1:13:22] can you imagine the horror that this
[1:13:24] young lady was feeling in her mind
[1:13:27] and the tears rolling down her face
[1:13:30] and then when she begins to look there
[1:13:32] and she looks up at jesus she looks
[1:13:34] around
[1:13:34] and she sees no accusers whatsoever
[1:13:38] nobody's left
[1:13:42] jesus says where are they and her
[1:13:44] sobbing through her tears and tears
[1:13:45] falling on the ground
[1:13:46] and her crying and sobbing where are
[1:13:48] they
[1:13:50] there are none there are none
[1:13:55] then i won't accuse you either he said
[1:13:58] go and sin no more
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:02] yesterday that woman was living a life
[1:14:06] of adultery she was living a life of
[1:14:07] prostitution
[1:14:08] she was living a life that the whole
[1:14:10] city the entire
[1:14:12] country there looked down upon her and
[1:14:14] was cast aside by her entire community
[1:14:18] but today because of god's grace
[1:14:22] today because of jesus christ was on the
[1:14:25] scene
[1:14:26] and he was in her midst he changed her
[1:14:29] life
[1:14:31] god changed her life she found value
[1:14:34] now she has value in life now she's
[1:14:37] accepted by the community
[1:14:38] now she's saved brothers and sisters can
[1:14:40] you imagine the feeling she must have
[1:14:41] had knowing that now i'm free my sins
[1:14:44] are gone
[1:14:58] all preachers look at their clutches you
[1:14:59] know
[1:15:06] jesus was walking with his disciples
[1:15:12] on a mission
[1:15:15] jesus is walking along knowing the road
[1:15:18] that is ahead of him his disciples fall
[1:15:22] sleepy
[1:15:24] you know where i'm going his disciples
[1:15:27] fall sleepy
[1:15:28] they fall asleep and he's sitting there
[1:15:31] and he says i've got to go a little bit
[1:15:33] farther
[1:15:33] so he goes right into this garden and he
[1:15:36] kneels down beside this rock
[1:15:38] and begins to pray now right there
[1:15:42] brothers and sisters when jesus knelt
[1:15:43] down and began to pray
[1:15:45] that was no longer god that was a man
[1:15:50] brother branham said it couldn't have
[1:15:51] been god because god can't die
[1:15:54] and there had to be a decision made as
[1:15:56] he began to sit down here and kneel down
[1:15:58] to pray
[1:15:59] and brother branham illustrates it so
[1:16:01] well he said i can see gabriel come down
[1:16:04] and his great sword by his side and he's
[1:16:07] sitting beside jesus
[1:16:08] he said i can see wormwood over here and
[1:16:11] all the other great angels
[1:16:12] lighting down upon the rocks
[1:16:16] and he said then that great holy spirit
[1:16:19] elohim
[1:16:21] the self-existing one he came down into
[1:16:24] his presence
[1:16:27] you know what's next he said he asked
[1:16:30] him
[1:16:31] son do you want to go through with it
[1:16:37] that's a man
[1:16:41] put yourself there he knew what was
[1:16:44] fixing to happen
[1:16:46] he knew what laid ahead in his future he
[1:16:48] knew what tomorrow holds
[1:16:51] and he said do you want to go through
[1:16:53] with it
[1:16:55] brother branham said the angels were
[1:16:57] listening
[1:16:59] he said what's your answer the whole
[1:17:02] world
[1:17:02] lays on your shoulders do you want to
[1:17:05] pay the price
[1:17:07] or do you want to or do you want to
[1:17:10] you can come right on now without death
[1:17:13] he had an option he could have went
[1:17:17] right on into the heavenlies
[1:17:18] never suffered one bit
[1:17:24] there lays calvary before you
[1:17:28] they'll spit in your face
[1:17:31] they'll take you to calvary you're going
[1:17:34] to die in
[1:17:35] agony with a crown of thorns on your
[1:17:37] head and your blood will drain out
[1:17:40] are you willing
[1:17:44] wow are you willing
[1:17:48] angels standing there wondering what's
[1:17:50] fixing to take place
[1:17:52] and what did jesus say as a man
[1:17:56] knowing the future of tomorrow
[1:17:59] not my will but thine be done
[1:18:05] brother branham said right there the
[1:18:07] angels knew so
[1:18:08] much what was fixing to take place said
[1:18:10] that the angels
[1:18:12] right then unfolded their blessings to
[1:18:14] begin to minister to him
[1:18:16] because they knew what laid ahead
[1:18:20] as a man he made that decision
[1:18:23] right there in that very garden he made
[1:18:25] the decision and he agreed to take the
[1:18:27] sins of the entire world
[1:18:29] upon his shoulders he agreed right there
[1:18:32] to take your fears
[1:18:33] he agreed to take your doubts he agreed
[1:18:36] to take your
[1:18:36] your your lust your hatred your anger
[1:18:39] your injury
[1:18:39] your strife your bitterness he took all
[1:18:42] of those mean
[1:18:43] qualities all those hateful things that
[1:18:44] we carry in our life and he took it upon
[1:18:46] his shoulders
[1:18:47] to a place called calvary
[1:18:52] they beat him they mocked him
[1:18:56] they spit on him they put a crown of
[1:18:58] thorn up on his head just like the
[1:19:00] prophet said
[1:19:01] they hung him up on a cross to die and
[1:19:03] he took his last breath
[1:19:10] but that was yesterday
[1:19:13] thank god for today because today jesus
[1:19:16] is no longer in the grave he's not in
[1:19:18] some tomb
[1:19:19] jesus is alive he's alive and well god
[1:19:22] god there was nothing they could do the
[1:19:23] grave couldn't hold him the devil
[1:19:25] couldn't stop him
[1:19:26] they couldn't do nothing with him he
[1:19:28] went down into the pits of hell
[1:19:29] and took the keys from the devil and
[1:19:31] said now they're mine
[1:19:35] release these people
[1:19:44] listen to what the prophet says
[1:19:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:49] forever
[1:19:51] just call on a historical god
[1:19:55] watch him become a present god
[1:19:59] raised up out of history to shine just
[1:20:02] as he did back then
[1:20:04] he'll act the same he'll do the same
[1:20:08] he'll forgive the same he'll heal the
[1:20:12] same
[1:20:13] his compassions are the same
[1:20:16] his willingness is the same his power
[1:20:19] is the same he's the same
[1:20:25] last three words he's waiting on us four
[1:20:27] words he's waiting
[1:20:29] on us he's everything he ever was
[1:20:33] when the world is crumbling around us
[1:20:35] just like we spoke about earlier when
[1:20:37] the world is crumbling and falling to
[1:20:39] shreds and pieces before our very eyes
[1:20:42] this word didn't change
[1:20:46] his saving power didn't change he still
[1:20:49] saves he still heals he still delivers
[1:20:51] anything you have need of this morning
[1:20:53] he's there for you
[1:20:57] i'm gonna close with this one little
[1:21:00] statement here
[1:21:02] with all the ups and downs as i've
[1:21:04] studied out on joseph there's so much
[1:21:06] more you could go into on joseph
[1:21:09] and and we know what happened with
[1:21:10] joseph he had the the
[1:21:12] the the butler and the baker and they go
[1:21:14] down into prison with him
[1:21:16] and and so they have dreams down there
[1:21:18] and one uh joseph interprets the dreams
[1:21:21] right and so i'm just going to hit him
[1:21:23] real quick so
[1:21:24] he interprets the dreams and one of them
[1:21:26] is set free and one of them's head was
[1:21:28] taken
[1:21:30] but you know joseph told that one guy
[1:21:32] let's say was it the was it the butler
[1:21:35] the one who lived
[1:21:38] i can't remember but anyway he told him
[1:21:41] he said remember
[1:21:42] me joseph said remember me
[1:21:45] when you go before the before the throne
[1:21:47] of egypt remember what i did for you
[1:21:50] remember how i
[1:21:51] interpreted these dreams that lasted
[1:21:54] about that long
[1:21:57] if you look in the bible it says almost
[1:21:59] two years
[1:22:01] went by before he remembered him
[1:22:06] you just saved somebody's life and they
[1:22:07] don't think about you for two years
[1:22:14] two years passed then we know the rest
[1:22:18] of the story
[1:22:19] pharaoh ends up having dreams and they
[1:22:20] call up joseph and joseph comes up
[1:22:22] interprets the dreams the
[1:22:24] the fatted cows uh eat up the skinny or
[1:22:27] the skinny cows eat up the fatted
[1:22:29] and and so we know all of egypt saved on
[1:22:31] the account of joseph's interpretation
[1:22:33] of the dream
[1:22:34] so now we find joseph lifted up into a
[1:22:36] place
[1:22:37] of authority he was the very second
[1:22:41] to the very king of egypt
[1:22:44] we're talking about a israel bull
[1:22:48] he's now second in place to the very
[1:22:51] king
[1:22:52] of egypt and here's what always stood
[1:22:55] out to me
[1:22:56] as so astounding as he now sits in his
[1:22:59] position
[1:22:59] all of israel is saved now because
[1:23:02] they had food his father come they
[1:23:04] recognized
[1:23:06] and the pharaoh looks at him and he
[1:23:07] changes his name
[1:23:10] to zephaniah panah
[1:23:13] changes his name
[1:23:16] anybody know what that means i'm going
[1:23:18] to tell you because it's good
[1:23:21] god speaks and he lives
[1:23:26] can you imagine all of egypt now had to
[1:23:30] look at joseph
[1:23:31] zephaniah panaya who is now known as god
[1:23:35] who speaks and is alive so all that god
[1:23:39] all that joseph went through in his
[1:23:40] entire life we signed the lord was with
[1:23:43] him the lord was with him the lord
[1:23:44] looked over and the lord
[1:23:45] gave favor to him and now god put him in
[1:23:47] a place that they looked at him
[1:23:49] because god was living through him
[1:23:54] brothers and sisters don't let yesterday
[1:23:57] define you in a bad way
[1:23:59] don't let your yesterday caused you to
[1:24:02] backslide on god
