[50:08] bless this reading of Thy word tonight
[50:09] Lord God we'll be happy and thankful
[50:11] when we leave this place in Jesus
[50:13] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[50:16] God bless you as you're standing here
[50:17] let's take our Bibles we like to go to
[50:19] Numbers Chapter 19
[50:22] here i' like to preach on the Waters of
[50:25] Separation perhaps you've heard brother
[50:26] Brandon preach it in
[50:28] 1955 uh it's a wonderful message I
[50:30] believe it was June 6th if I'm not
[50:32] mistaken U he preached this message
[50:34] while you're turn in there i' like to uh
[50:35] bring greetings from our church back
[50:37] home we're just a very very small Church
[50:39] our church can probably just fit in just
[50:41] right here by God's grace if not maybe
[50:44] three quarters of this here by God's
[50:46] grace so uh we're thankful you know we
[50:49] had brother Thomas there and he got to
[50:50] visit us and I was so glad he was
[50:52] blessed you know I was just thankful he
[50:54] was blessed and to get the invitation
[50:56] you know I'm humbled you know our church
[50:57] is so small um but we're thankful we
[51:00] have a big God though that's the best
[51:01] part it doesn't matter how big or small
[51:03] the church is we got a big God we love
[51:06] the Lord Jesus Christ so we're thankful
[51:08] for uh the fellowship today with brother
[51:10] Thomas and Donna what wonderful Saints
[51:12] they are praise God I don't know if I
[51:13] could be amongst sweeter Christians and
[51:15] that you know just the hospitality and
[51:17] the sweetness of the Holy Spirit and
[51:19] like I said they Victoria caught her
[51:21] first ate fish because of brother Thomas
[51:23] and sister Donna so we're thankful for
[51:25] that car caught six more herself there
[51:28] so I caught a couple too by God's
[51:31] grace but uh it's wonderful to see what
[51:33] God has done for your pastor out there
[51:34] you know uh at his home and uh you know
[51:37] it's just amazing what God can do with
[51:39] one person praise God and you know all
[51:40] the the helpers and the vision that he
[51:42] has here and this is just a beautiful
[51:44] church and we're thankful to be here my
[51:45] first time here uh so we're thankful to
[51:48] be in the house of God I don't get out
[51:49] very much I'm a pastor you know I stay
[51:51] close to the church don't get a lot of
[51:52] invitations that's okay I I I was I was
[51:55] already invited by Jesus to be the
[51:56] pastor of the church so that's the most
[51:58] important invitation I need but it is
[52:01] refreshing you know it really really is
[52:03] refreshing to come to a church and visit
[52:05] the Saints and just see the same holy
[52:06] spirit that we see in our services with
[52:09] here with you as well by God's grace so
[52:11] Numbers Chapter 19 off after we uh read
[52:14] the text I'll probably share just a few
[52:15] more things about my family and our
[52:17] church by God's grace but let's have
[52:19] this uh reading and then we'll have you
[52:20] be seated by God's
[52:23] grace like to preach again on the Waters
[52:25] of Separation this this this sermon has
[52:27] uh blessed my heart and I've seen it you
[52:29] know when I preach at different places
[52:30] I've seen this message really minister
[52:32] to others as well so I hope it'll be a
[52:35] great blessing to you verse one says and
[52:38] the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron
[52:39] saying this is the ordinance of the law
[52:42] which the Lord hath commanded saying
[52:43] speak in the children of Israel that
[52:45] they may bring thee a red hepher without
[52:47] spot how many know that Israel has about
[52:50] five of them if I'm not mistaken they
[52:51] got five of them last
[52:54] year wein is no blemish and upon which
[52:57] never came
[52:59] yoke and ye shall give her unto alers of
[53:01] the priest that he may bring her forth
[53:03] without the camp and one shall slay her
[53:06] before his
[53:07] face now I'm going to skip down to verse
[53:09] nine and if you could could you read
[53:11] tonight i' like to hear your voices you
[53:12] our our church I always have our church
[53:14] read you know at least one verse
[53:16] together it's nice to hear your voice
[53:18] nice to hear the Saints speak the word
[53:19] of God how many know there's life in the
[53:20] power of the
[53:21] tongue so if you haven't spoke it yet
[53:23] today now you're going to be blessed now
[53:25] you're going to feel the power of God
[53:27] because you're speaking God's word let's
[53:29] read verse N9 I like to count it on
[53:31] three 1 2 3 and a man that is clean
[53:34] Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher
[53:37] and lay them up without the camp in a
[53:40] clean place and it shall be kept for the
[53:43] congregation of the children of Israel
[53:45] for a water of Separation it is a
[53:49] purification for sin may God add his
[53:52] Blessing to reading his word you may be
[53:53] seated
[53:57] I like to record these you know I can
[53:58] share them with my wife and the Saints

[54:01] going to record the audio myself and
[54:03] again it's a privileged to be here by
[54:05] God's grace I'm humbled to be here and I
[54:06] hope brother that brother Thomas I hope
[54:08] we can have you up to preach for us when
[54:09] it uh fits your schedule brother we'd
[54:13] love to have that by God's grace and he

[54:16] helping the Navar Saints we call him the
[54:18] Navar Saints the former Amish former
[54:20] Amish community up there it's about 45
[54:22] minutes south of our church and uh he
[54:25] did a wonderful job helping I don't know
[54:26] how this guy does it I don't he he must
[54:28] have unlimited energy I need to talk to
[54:30] him about energy afterwards by God's
[54:32] grace I I'm chasing around my eight
[54:34] children I'm working a full-time job uh
[54:36] and I'm pastoring a church and I'm like
[54:37] how does this guy do all this does he
[54:39] have some secret energy I don't know
[54:41] about but brother uh it's so such a
[54:44] blessing to be with you sir we
[54:45] appreciate you God bless you uh just a
[54:48] little bit about me you know I uh uh I
[54:49] was raised in Assemblies of God church I
[54:51] didn't know the message um and then I
[54:53] heard the message in November it was
[54:55] Thanksgiving night 2001 what a
[54:57] Thanksgiving brother Ram tells us in the
[54:59] invisible Union what a Thanksgiving
[55:01] Hallelujah thanksgiving's a message and
[55:03] uh from that moment my life's been you
[55:05] know transformed by the Gospel of Jesus
[55:07] Christ because that's what we have we
[55:09] actually have the real Gospel of Jesus
[55:10] Christ we call the message and it is but
[55:13] it's the message of the original Gospel
[55:15] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and uh so you
[55:19] know since then uh you know shortly
[55:21] after that I would say you know uh 3
[55:23] years after that I was married to my
[55:25] lovely wife we've been now married
[55:26] married 21 years I don't want to forget
[55:27] that 21 years sometimes I forget how
[55:29] many years we've been married uh and you
[55:32] know she's born me eight children we
[55:33] have uh eight beautiful children two of
[55:35] them here tonight so we're thankful for
[55:37] them and I've been a school teacher as
[55:38] our as your pastor said I've been a
[55:40] school teacher now for 20 years I just
[55:41] finished up 20 years there I teach the
[55:43] little ones I teach first grade I had
[55:45] the choice to go higher but boy I really
[55:46] like those little ones they still hug
[55:48] you you know they they draw you pictures
[55:50] they tell you they love you so I like to
[55:52] stay with the little
[55:53] ones I know you know some people may
[55:55] think that's ridiculous but I it just
[55:57] kind of fits me you know and it makes
[55:59] sense I got eight children I might as
[56:00] well teach children you know by God's
[56:01] grace uh I just likeed that you know I
[56:04] just like the children there
[56:07] um and so um you know I started
[56:09] preaching oh yeah uh I was baptized by
[56:12] the pastor brother Isaiah Brooks if you
[56:14] know him and then uh he made me a deacon
[56:17] and then I started preaching in 2004 now
[56:20] I've been preaching 20 years hard to
[56:21] believe that uh just flies by like that
[56:24] you know but so many wonderful blessings
[56:25] I'll share some testimonies you know
[56:27] tonight and tomorrow um and so then you
[56:31] know we we were driving 3 hours every
[56:33] one way every Sunday to support brother
[56:35] Isaiah because he was my pastor you know
[56:37] but then we felt led we should start a
[56:38] church that was in 2006 and so I've been
[56:41] pastoring you know 18 years uh since
[56:43] 2006 our church has grown mostly with
[56:45] children we've got a few more adults
[56:47] than we started it's mostly grown with
[56:49] children and uh and so I started a
[56:53] YouTube Ministry if you like YouTube you
[56:54] know of course you got to stay away from
[56:55] all the evil but there's good stuff on
[56:56] there but I started a YouTube Ministry
[56:58] in 2013 so I've been doing that for 11
[57:00] years and putting out videos defending
[57:02] brother brandom I started a podcast a
[57:03] few years ago called defending the
[57:05] message I've written two books I wrote a
[57:07] book about modesty you know the outward
[57:09] appearance and then I wrote a book about
[57:11] the New Testament Mysteries brother
[57:12] brand mentions them and cers this is the
[57:14] end time he he mentions Scofield's list
[57:17] of mysteries and he says how the the
[57:19] church age messenger was to reveal those
[57:21] so I wrote a book on that as well I just
[57:23] love the word you know our brother said
[57:25] you know I'm a teacher that's I you know
[57:26] that's what I am by Nature I'll try to
[57:28] preach a little bit though tonight by
[57:29] God's grace you know I just when I'm out
[57:31] and about I don't like to maybe teach so
[57:33] much I kind of like to preach and build
[57:34] your faith you know but either way you
[57:36] know when you teach the roots go deeper
[57:38] by God's grace so we'll just see
[57:40] whatever you all pull out you know
[57:41] that's really what it depends on brother
[57:43] BR said a preacher can do he can have
[57:44] whatever anointing he has but the people
[57:47] got to have the same
[57:48] anointing right it's it's a it's a
[57:50] fellowship right it's a it's it's a
[57:52] teamwork right it's a it's a family
[57:54] right everybody in the family's got to
[57:55] do part
[57:57] Hallelujah so uh that's a little bit
[57:59] about me um that's probably all you want
[58:02] to hear about me let's get to the word
[58:03] of God here as as we'll preach you know
[58:06] we'll try to bring out these
[58:07] thoughts so looking at the Waters of
[58:09] Separation again brother Randon preached
[58:11] this in 1955 it's a tremendous message
[58:14] he had to shorten it because uh he was
[58:15] short on time and he wouldn't do the
[58:17] prayer line at the end he said you know
[58:19] teaching was a different anointing
[58:21] because he had to get under the
[58:22] different anointing to do the prayer
[58:23] line at the end um but he actually
[58:26] called this message a teaching so maybe
[58:28] it will be some teaching but just before
[58:30] I forget you know I want to read this
[58:31] quote brother random said in 1954 he
[58:33] said uh we need some spiritual vitamins
[58:36] God has got them for you to help your
[58:39] spirit up to pep you up a little that's
[58:42] the preaching of the Gospel Hallelujah
[58:45] if that won't pep up the church there's
[58:48] nothing that will because Faith cometh
[58:51] by hearing hearing of the word of God so
[58:55] if you want to leave here with a little
[58:56] more pep in your life receive the word
[58:59] of God say Amen to the word of God
[59:03] repent of any sins any uh easily
[59:05] besetting sin repent of that receive the
[59:08] word of God and you'll walk out of here
[59:10] with more energy than when you came
[59:12] in you'll walk out of here happier than
[59:15] when you came in I know for this for a
[59:18] fact I know you'll walk out of here more
[59:19] hopeful than when you came in because we
[59:22] spend you know our time out in the world
[59:23] you we hear the news and we hear all
[59:25] things you going on and then the people
[59:27] get sick and there's disruptions to our
[59:29] life maybe lower finances here or
[59:32] sickness there whatever it might be but
[59:33] I tell you if you get in line with the
[59:35] word of God you'll walk out of here with
[59:36] a lot of Hope for the future praise God
[59:39] because God is the uh he's the author
[59:41] he's the author and finisher of your
[59:43] faith Hallelujah you're in the you're in
[59:45] the palm of his nail scarred hand
[59:47] Hallelujah no man can pluck you out of
[59:49] the father's hand Hallelujah no man put
[59:51] you there no man can pluck you out
[59:53] praise God so you got nothing to worry
[59:55] about amen brother B said the whole
[59:57] Christian uh walk is rest in the Lord
[1:00:00] amen what are we doing we're resting in
[1:00:02] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so you know
[1:00:05] we uh we we pulled inspiration from the
[1:00:08] Waters of Separation brother R also
[1:00:10] mentions this in uh briefly about 50
[1:00:12] minutes into the sermon he mentions this
[1:00:14] in the basis of Fellowship 195 I'm sorry
[1:00:18] 1961 so this is a message about
[1:00:20] Fellowship brother brandom uses it for
[1:00:21] fellowship and also separation from sin
[1:00:25] Hallelujah and remember as we go on you
[1:00:27] know brother raham says Devils don't
[1:00:29] move unless you expose
[1:00:32] them and then the Bible also says tells
[1:00:36] us in Jude chapter 1 there's only one
[1:00:37] chapter the Bible says you've got to
[1:00:39] hate even the Garment spotted by the
[1:00:41] Flesh of
[1:00:42] sin so you know if if we want to draw
[1:00:45] close to God if we want a closer
[1:00:47] fellowship with God we've got to hate
[1:00:49] our sin we've got to repent of our sin
[1:00:52] Hallelujah because we all fight Devils
[1:00:55] uh we we we all fight evil spirits uh
[1:00:58] brother Ram says the worst devil of all
[1:01:00] of them is the devil of
[1:01:02] unbelief he said that's the worst one he
[1:01:04] said but the worst feeling of all the
[1:01:07] Devils now listen feeling he said the
[1:01:09] worst feeling is the devil of
[1:01:11] nervousness or
[1:01:14] distress anybody felt nervous these last
[1:01:16] few years Co make anybody
[1:01:19] nervous of course of course it did we we
[1:01:22] never gone through it gone through it
[1:01:24] before but brother says the worst demon
[1:01:27] uh feeling is a evil sphere of
[1:01:29] nervousness that's why we got to come to
[1:01:31] the house of God and let off the
[1:01:34] pressure hallelujah praise
[1:01:37] God the Bible calls it casting down
[1:01:40] anything that exalts itself against the
[1:01:41] word of God cast it down
[1:01:44] Hallelujah and bring every thought into
[1:01:46] captivity to the
[1:01:49] Lord and then you're able by God's grace
[1:01:51] to believe again hallelujah it's not
[1:01:54] that you lost all your faith but it just
[1:01:56] that you uh you know you had a mind
[1:01:59] battle and the Bible said you the the
[1:02:02] devil can develop a stronghold in your
[1:02:03] mind brother random calls it a complex
[1:02:05] anybody ever had a complex before a
[1:02:07] complex is when somebody says something
[1:02:09] about that brother in instantly evil
[1:02:11] feelings and yet you should have felt
[1:02:12] good feelings about them why didn't you
[1:02:15] feel L to that person because you got a
[1:02:17] complex you have a stronghold build up
[1:02:20] in your mind but the Bible said we have
[1:02:22] Mighty weapons to tear down strongholds
[1:02:24] your pastor knows a thing or two about
[1:02:26] tearing down buildings I saw a video of
[1:02:28] it today Hallelujah that's what that's
[1:02:31] what overcoming a complex is it's
[1:02:33] tearing down the building Hallelujah and
[1:02:35] why' he tear it down so he can build
[1:02:37] something back up Hallelujah that's what
[1:02:40] God wants to do in our life he wants to
[1:02:41] build down an evil you know an evil
[1:02:43] spirit or a bad feeling he wants to tear
[1:02:46] that down and build up something strong
[1:02:48] praise God build up something that would
[1:02:51] glorify God
[1:02:54] hallelujah and so as we gone we we have
[1:02:56] to remember these things that this
[1:02:58] message is for fellowship with God also
[1:03:00] for one another but mainly God and then
[1:03:02] it's for separation from
[1:03:05] sin uh brother random said I in 1961 he
[1:03:08] said he preached it back in 1955 and he
[1:03:10] said a Jewish rabbi was sitting in the
[1:03:13] audience and this this story is about
[1:03:15] being uh the Waters of Separation
[1:03:18] outside of Moses's Tabernacle how many
[1:03:21] know Moses Tabernacle had a fence to it
[1:03:24] and it had a door at the front
[1:03:26] there's a picture of it out there you
[1:03:27] got the pillar of Fire coming down out
[1:03:29] there right with with Moses Tabernacle
[1:03:31] but the Waters of Separation happened
[1:03:33] outside before you even got into the
[1:03:35] outer
[1:03:36] Court Hallelujah it happens out there
[1:03:40] and and and there's all these steps
[1:03:42] there's steps to the water separation
[1:03:43] and then you know when you enter in then
[1:03:45] there's steps there's the Brazen altar
[1:03:46] then there's the Laver right and then
[1:03:49] there's a door to the holy place you got
[1:03:50] your candlesticks you got your shoe
[1:03:52] bread you got your altar of incense then
[1:03:54] you have another Veil
[1:03:56] yeah and then once you go in there now
[1:03:58] you go in the presence of God
[1:04:01] hallelujah and so a Jewish rabbi was
[1:04:04] sitting there here brother random
[1:04:05] preaches and the brother Rand said the
[1:04:07] Jewish rabbi repented he said I never
[1:04:09] heard it like that in all my life now
[1:04:11] he's a Critic of Christianity but he
[1:04:13] hears brother Randon preaches and he
[1:04:15] says after that he said he said I come
[1:04:18] from a generation of Rabbi Rabbi after
[1:04:20] Rabbi after Rabbi brother Ram said and
[1:04:22] he said and now I'm a Pentecostal Rabbi
[1:04:25] with with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:31] amen so he was a Jew who had the Bible
[1:04:35] said God blinded the Jews he had
[1:04:36] blinders on but as brother Adam preaches
[1:04:39] the Holy Ghost took off the blinders and
[1:04:41] now he had the eyes salv amen and now he
[1:04:43] had eyes that can see Hallelujah ears
[1:04:46] that could hear praise God and he
[1:04:48] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] amen oh the life of God
[1:04:53] Amen if it'll do it to a Pentecostal
[1:04:55] Rabbi how about a message believer
[1:04:57] sitting on the message Pew the last 40
[1:04:59] Years of your life amen or the last 18
[1:05:02] years of your life or the last 15 years
[1:05:04] of your life how much more will this
[1:05:06] message take off your blinders so you
[1:05:08] can see the word of God so you can see
[1:05:10] Jesus Christ in every detail of the
[1:05:12] Bible
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:16] amen now if you look at numbers
[1:05:19] 19:10 notice the Bible says he that
[1:05:22] gathers the ashes of the heph I we'll
[1:05:23] build up to this in a moment but I just
[1:05:25] want you to see this
[1:05:26] shall wash his clothes and be unclean
[1:05:28] until the even that's speaking of the
[1:05:29] the priest or the helper of the priest
[1:05:31] that would take up these ashes and be
[1:05:33] unclean to the even and it shall be unto
[1:05:36] the children of
[1:05:37] Israel and unto the stranger everybody
[1:05:40] say and ready and so this this Waters of
[1:05:44] separation is for the children of Israel
[1:05:46] but notice it's also for the stranger
[1:05:49] the
[1:05:51] Gentile the Bible calls them

[1:07:48] press
[1:07:49] play it's harder to open up your Bible
[1:07:53] it's harder to go in the prayer closet
[1:07:55] the church
[1:07:56] said we lose our first love where's our
[1:07:59] original Zeal well it it it's somewhere
[1:08:02] and you can go get it amen you can bring

[1:08:57] guilty and made them holy and brought
[1:09:00] them back into Fellowship

[1:09:08] anybody in here would be guilty of
[1:09:11] sin I'm being
[1:09:13] facius I know we're all guilty of
[1:09:16] sin right brother man said I'm my worst

[1:09:50] john8 the blood of Jesus Christ if we

[1:09:56] and makes us holy and puts us back into

[1:10:10] heer is brother Ram said notice
[1:10:14] everything pointed to Christ brother Ram
[1:10:17] said even the Waters of Separation The
[1:10:19] Red heer he said it couldn't be a brown
[1:10:21] one it had to be a red one and brother
[1:10:24] said that r red represents Redemption he
[1:10:27] said sometimes red looks is danger to us
[1:10:30] right like a stop sign don't go through
[1:10:31] the stop sign or a stop light but
[1:10:34] brother mam says he said a red heer this
[1:10:36] represents Redemption he said follow
[1:10:40] that red all down through the Bible oh

[1:10:45] with with lamb skins on what is it it's
[1:10:48] bloody red Hallelujah is that right amen
[1:10:52] then in Rahab what do we see a Scarlet
[1:10:54] Red thread
[1:10:56] Hallelujah is that right and then at
[1:10:59] Jesus's death what do we see he's
[1:11:01] covered his bones stare at him the Bible
[1:11:04] said his tongue clung to the roof of his
[1:11:06] mouth that's how thirsty he was anybody
[1:11:08] ever felt that way
[1:11:09] before that thirsty his tongue clung to
[1:11:12] the roof of his mouth his bone stared at
[1:11:15] him and blood poured out all over and he
[1:11:18] was bleeding for you and I praise God he
[1:11:21] willingly did that for the joy that was
[1:11:23] set before him so he could see you saved
[1:11:27] hallelujah it's a red it's a red line
[1:11:30] all the way of redemption and brother
[1:11:32] bam said this red heer represents
[1:11:36] Redemption Hallelujah he said everything
[1:11:38] points to Christ the Bible says here in
[1:11:40] numbers 19 it has it has without spot
[1:11:44] this has to and as you've heard you
[1:11:45] probably heard about the heers in in uh
[1:11:47] Israel they're protecting them from the
[1:11:49] Hamas and everything you know to make
[1:11:50] sure uh that nobody can get to these
[1:11:52] heers because they're going to need one
[1:11:54] of these heers when they build their new
[1:11:56] Temple they cannot
[1:11:58] sacrifice or get even get even into the
[1:12:00] temple until they have this red heer and
[1:12:03] the Waters of
[1:12:04] Separation Hallelujah so that's why many
[1:12:07] people think we're at the end time well
[1:12:09] we know we're at the end time amen
[1:12:11] denominational churches they you know
[1:12:12] they're they're just guessing but we
[1:12:14] know for sure praise God we see Israel
[1:12:16] back in her Homeland the Fig Tree is
[1:12:18] putting forth its buds and brother R
[1:12:20] said all the other trees are too you see
[1:12:23] the pope went to the G7 a you weeks ago
[1:12:25] and Biden's rubbing his forehead with
[1:12:27] the Pope what's that that's the mother
[1:12:30] Harlot and that's the Beast out of the
[1:12:31] earth rubbing their foreheads together
[1:12:33] putting their heads together oh my
[1:12:36] church we we need to be ready praise
[1:12:38] God but this red heer had had no spot no
[1:12:41] blemish the Bible said Jesus is without
[1:12:44] spot and no
[1:12:46] blemish and this red heer never came a
[1:12:49] yoke upon this red heer and brother Ram
[1:12:52] said notice never a yoke on his neck
[1:12:55] Christ was not yolked with any
[1:12:58] organization and the church said isn't
[1:13:01] that beautiful amen this red effer
[1:13:03] didn't he wasn't yolked to Pentecost
[1:13:05] amen he wasn't yolked to Lutheran he
[1:13:08] wasn't yolked to Jeffersonville he
[1:13:09] wasn't yolked to anywhere he was Yol he
[1:13:12] wasn't yolked at all he was free
[1:13:15] hallelujah amen that's what we are we're
[1:13:19] free hallelujah we're not yolked to the
[1:13:21] world Amen Hallelujah we are free in
[1:13:24] Christ Hallelujah amen so we see Jesus
[1:13:27] in every type the Bible said the red
[1:13:29] effort had to be taken without the camp
[1:13:31] and Hebrews 13 said Jesus was taken
[1:13:33] outside the
[1:13:35] camp oh it's beautiful praise God now
[1:13:38] notice once they burnt I'm sorry once
[1:13:40] they killed the red heer they had to
[1:13:41] take the
[1:13:42] blood and the Bible tells us here in uh
[1:13:46] verse four elaser the priest shall take
[1:13:48] her blood with his finger and sprinkle
[1:13:50] of her blood directly before the
[1:13:51] Tabernacle of the congregation seven
[1:13:54] times
[1:13:55] Hallelujah brother tells us what this
[1:13:57] means again a basis of Fellowship he
[1:14:00] says look oh the next thing he took he
[1:14:03] had seven Stripes of blood before him to
[1:14:04] show that the seven Stripes meant the
[1:14:07] seven Church
[1:14:08] ages at every age had to be represented
[1:14:12] by the blood nothing else no other way
[1:14:17] from Genesis the Revelation from Eden to
[1:14:19] the Millennium it's the blood and
[1:14:21] nothing but the blood
[1:14:23] Hallelujah so El would take that blood
[1:14:26] and he wasn't inside yet he wasn't even
[1:14:27] in the outer court and he had to
[1:14:29] sprinkle one Ephesus two samna peramos
[1:14:34] thyra Hallelujah Sardis Philadelphia and
[1:14:37] thank God there's blood for leoda
[1:14:40] Hallelujah there's blood for us and let
[1:14:43] me tell you the same blood that was shed
[1:14:45] for Paul's sins as a he he was a
[1:14:47] blasphemer and the same blood that saved
[1:14:50] him and the same blood that will save us
[1:14:52] hallelujah not a different blood not a
[1:14:55] different sacrifice same blood same
[1:14:58] sacrifice same power Same Love same
[1:15:01] Mercy same forgiveness the same God
[1:15:04] hallelujah
[1:15:07] amen hallelujah so when Paul says uh
[1:15:11] when I sin it's not me it's the sin that
[1:15:13] dwelleth within me I can say Amen to
[1:15:17] that
[1:15:18] Hallelujah and then I always bring up 1
[1:15:21] John
[1:15:22] 3:9 uh do you have it up there can you
[1:15:25] is that possible it's okay if you don't
[1:15:27] 1 John 3:9 but it says he that uh he he
[1:15:31] that has the seed of God does not commit
[1:15:33] sin huh two chapters earlier in chapter
[1:15:37] one John said If any man says he doesn't
[1:15:40] have sin he's a
[1:15:42] liar right and then two chapters later
[1:15:45] uh he tells us that if we if we uh I'm
[1:15:47] sorry that if we have the seed of God we
[1:15:49] do not commit sin because the seed of
[1:15:51] God is in him and it remains there it is
[1:15:54] thank you sir good job back there

[1:16:10] the holy when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:12] it's like a seed and it's brother says
[1:16:14] it's growing all the time you just feed
[1:16:16] it it's going to grow he said it starts
[1:16:18] off like a little button just keep
[1:16:19] feeding that butt my my your button must
[1:16:21] be pretty big by now brother amen
[1:16:23] hallelujah must be big like a a uh some

[1:16:32] it grows but notice you cannot sin what
[1:16:35] can't sin the seed of God in you cannot
[1:16:37] sin I had to heard some more amens on
[1:16:39] that one Hallelujah the seed of God in
[1:16:42] you cannot sin other words your soul can
[1:16:44] never sin Hallelujah that's right your
[1:16:47] mind your flesh will sin every day
[1:16:50] brother said I make thousands of
[1:16:51] mistakes in a month he said sure I do
[1:16:53] thousands of mistakes in a year he said
[1:16:55] but every time I'm wrong I say Jesus
[1:16:57] forgive me and Jesus forgave him
[1:16:59] Hallelujah but in one way that soul
[1:17:02] never sin in the first
[1:17:04] place because the soul is a seed of God
[1:17:07] well whose seed is that God's
[1:17:09] seed that seed inside of you is part of
[1:17:11] God's spirit and if it's part of God's
[1:17:13] spirit it has the Eternal qualities of
[1:17:16] God Amen oh you've got Eternal nature to

[1:17:53] killed beast and burn it all together

[1:19:34] said uh the Bible also calls it Ezekiel
[1:19:36] 13 new heart new spirit my
[1:19:40] spirit and then when you get the Holy
[1:19:42] Ghost everyone will see and hear
[1:19:45] it that's what the Bible said Peter said
[1:19:48] God has shed forth this which you see
[1:19:51] which you see and hear amen and brother

[1:20:21] night with with makeup all over their
[1:20:23] faces and their dresses undone he said
[1:20:24] those old Kentucky mothers would get out
[1:20:26] of uh uh come with some type of a stick

[1:20:30] I thought I'm in Kentucky tonight
[1:20:33] amen said that must be a sign I'm
[1:20:35] supposed to preach this
[1:20:37] tonight Hallelujah but you just keep
[1:20:40] believing that church you got to be

[1:21:00] daily help me to bring every thought
[1:21:02] into captivity to Christ
[1:21:06] Hallelujah now you see it's a
[1:21:08] purification for sin so they'd kill the
[1:21:10] animal uh use the blood then they burn
[1:21:12] the red heer and mix the the Scarlet his
[1:21:15] up and the wood and then they they would
[1:21:17] burn it all they take the ashes and mix
[1:21:20] it with water put it in a in some type
[1:21:23] of a charger and then then they could
[1:21:25] use it Hallelujah brother calls it well
[1:21:29] brother tells us it's the water of
[1:21:31] Separation this mixture is going to
[1:21:33] bring you back into
[1:21:35] Fellowship it took a red heer to die to
[1:21:39] suffer and bleed and give its life so it
[1:21:43] could cleanse you and bring you back
[1:21:45] into
[1:21:46] Fellowship something had to die to bring
[1:21:49] you back into Fellowship after you're
[1:21:51] already a Christian right Jesus Jesus is
[1:21:55] the Once once and for all offering

[1:22:22] today so thank you I appreciate that I
[1:22:24] normally don't drink water when I'm on
[1:22:25] the road but I think all the heat today

[1:22:29] verse 11 he that toucheth the dead body
[1:22:32] of any man shall be unclean seven

[1:22:43] can't worship you can't go into the
[1:22:45] temple see that verse 12 and he shall
[1:22:48] purify himself with it on the third
[1:22:51] day and on the seventh day he shall be
[1:22:53] clean but if he purify not himself the
[1:22:56] third day then the seventh day he should
[1:22:57] not be clean I love this God makes you

[1:31:44] that they get into people's lives and it
[1:31:47] it's a death in the house it's a
[1:31:48] spiritual death in the house it's going
[1:31:51] to affect the whole house or maybe it's
[1:31:53] like this this sometimes in my house
[1:31:55] yeah I got I got six girls and two boys
[1:31:58] I got eight children did I tell you that

[1:32:13] know my parents were divorced I was poor
[1:32:15] we had six you know I had six siblings
[1:32:16] and we never got anything so I like to
[1:32:18] spoil my kids a little bit by God's
[1:32:19] grace they're only young once anyway you
[1:32:22] know Hallelujah yeah right I forgot I
[1:32:27] lost my track my train of thought there
[1:32:28] I already know what I was preaching on
[1:32:29] there start talking about
[1:32:32] that the dead things yes the dead
[1:32:36] things but I was I'm going to just back
[1:32:39] back to that I can't think of it now but
[1:32:41] you know we have to make sure things
[1:32:42] that come in our house they defile our
[1:32:44] house oh I know what I remember it was
[1:32:46] arguments sometimes my girls or
[1:32:48] sometimes my my oldest son and my
[1:32:50] teenage girls they start arguing and
[1:32:51] fussing name calling that can be a a
[1:32:54] dead thing if they don't repent of
[1:32:56] that because every then every time
[1:32:58] brother walks by a sister he slaps him
[1:33:00] pushes him kind of playful like that
[1:33:03] that's an evil
[1:33:04] spirit and the church
[1:33:07] said the Bible said cherish one another
[1:33:10] love one another don't pick on each
[1:33:12] other oh here here's another one name
[1:33:14] calling that's a real death in the house
[1:33:17] do not let them call
[1:33:19] names unless it's like uh my my
[1:33:22] wonderful brother and sister you darling
[1:33:24] you know you're sweetheart you're
[1:33:26] handsome just use
[1:33:28] those if not it's going to cause sibling
[1:33:31] rivalries that's true never degrade them
[1:33:35] I told both girls before we came I said
[1:33:37] girls you look beautiful tonight and I
[1:33:39] don't care if anybody else thinks that I
[1:33:41] think it and they're going to know that
[1:33:43] Daddy thinks they're
[1:33:44] beautiful before some Slicker comes
[1:33:46] around and says something like that
[1:33:48] they'll know well Daddy treat treat me
[1:33:50] way better Hallelujah Daddy's a real man
[1:33:52] of God he loves God Amen
[1:33:54] Hallelujah but if you let fighting and
[1:33:56] name calling and bickering if you don't
[1:33:58] stop that it's a death in the home and
[1:34:00] there's only one way to clean it out
[1:34:02] through the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah
[1:34:05] the Old Testament called it Waters of
[1:34:06] Separation but in the New Testament the
[1:34:08] blood of Jesus Christ will separate
[1:34:10] those children from their sins
[1:34:12] Hallelujah to clean your house back out
[1:34:14] by the grace of
[1:34:16] God
[1:34:19] Amen now we can go through a lot of
[1:34:21] these sometimes people don't pay tithes
[1:34:22] and offerings that's another death in
[1:34:24] the
[1:34:26] house and I personally believe if they
[1:34:28] don't do that how can they be born again
[1:34:31] if you can't open your wallet to God how
[1:34:33] can you open your soul to
[1:34:35] God and I'm not asking for more money
[1:34:38] that's not why I do it but it's
[1:34:40] selfishness it's a lack of
[1:34:42] faith you're the Bible said you're
[1:34:44] robbing God and some people say oh
[1:34:47] that's not in the New Testament you
[1:34:48] failed to read your Bible it's 1
[1:34:50] Corinthians 9:13 and 14 Paul said God
[1:34:53] has ordained they which preach the
[1:34:56] gospel should live of the
[1:34:59] Gospel again all these accusers brother
[1:35:02] random all these accusers these haters
[1:35:04] of the message what they do is they hate
[1:35:06] the Bible that's what it really is but
[1:35:08] we love the Bible amen the Bible's got
[1:35:11] all the answers brother says brother
[1:35:12] said if I die in my tracks right now he
[1:35:15] said the Bible's my
[1:35:17] absolute
[1:35:20] amen hallelujah he said an absolute is
[1:35:24] Limitless in
[1:35:26] power that's what an absolute is
[1:35:28] Limitless in
[1:35:30] power the church said what now the tapes
[1:35:33] can't be the absolute because look what
[1:35:35] the tapes have done to Jeffersonville
[1:35:36] they lost all the
[1:35:37] power Hallelujah I believe in the tapes
[1:35:40] but brother never said my tapes are the
[1:35:42] absolute thus sayith the Lord uh they're
[1:35:44] equal to the Bible brother R never said
[1:35:46] that but yes but and brother Praises he
[1:35:49] he Praises at the end of preaching the
[1:35:51] absolute there in 63 I believe it's
[1:35:52] January
[1:35:54] brother said I pray for this
[1:35:56] congregation that they will come to know
[1:35:58] you as the absolute Hallelujah Glory
[1:36:02] he's praying to God and he says may this
[1:36:04] congregation know that you are the
[1:36:06] absolute brother R said God's absolute
[1:36:09] is the word of
[1:36:12] God right so all these tap people they
[1:36:14] have a different absolute than God I
[1:36:16] don't know about you but I don't have
[1:36:17] God's
[1:36:19] absolute I know there's a fine line but
[1:36:21] I think you understand what I'm saying
[1:36:25] right brother man said there's quotes
[1:36:26] brother said I have no power to do
[1:36:29] anything well then he can't be the
[1:36:30] absolute because the absolute is
[1:36:32] Limitless of
[1:36:34] power
[1:36:35] right
[1:36:37] Hallelujah brother said he says I make
[1:36:40] uh mistakes all the time on tape he says
[1:36:42] 700 that didn't bow the knee instead of
[1:36:44] 7,000 we need to start listening to more
[1:36:46] tapes the church
[1:36:48] said they're listening to tapes but
[1:36:50] they're not hearing them they're just
[1:36:52] listening to them they're not hearing
[1:36:53] them
[1:36:54] yeah brother said God makes no mistakes
[1:36:57] God doesn't make contradictions God
[1:36:59] doesn't make errors Hallelujah God's
[1:37:01] absolute is his word
[1:37:06] hallelujah oh you're a good Bible
[1:37:08] believing church here praise God
[1:37:11] hallelujah that's
[1:37:13] right another thing is with you know the
[1:37:15] relationships between husbands and wives
[1:37:18] if they can't get that solved out
[1:37:20] something's wrong if God can't get in
[1:37:22] your bedroom and clean out that how can
[1:37:24] he get in your
[1:37:26] soul Hallelujah and I know there there's
[1:37:28] pains for people's past and I know
[1:37:29] there's scars but the Bible said Jesus
[1:37:32] is so tender he won't break a breeze
[1:37:34] rud Hallelujah so if you've been hurt in
[1:37:37] your past Jesus won't come and just
[1:37:39] break it all up the Bible said he binds
[1:37:41] up the
[1:37:42] Brokenhearted we've got if we got hurts
[1:37:44] from our marriage or hurts from our
[1:37:46] family hurts from parents Jesus will
[1:37:47] take those pieces and he'll start
[1:37:49] putting them back
[1:37:51] together thank you Jesus he'll bind it
[1:37:53] back up he'll just rub it back in there
[1:37:55] he's got some some spiritual glue he can
[1:37:57] just put it all that broken heart back
[1:37:58] together the Bible said a wounded Spirit
[1:38:01] who can bear only you see you you can't
[1:38:03] bear it you got to cast your cares on
[1:38:05] Jesus so he can bear
[1:38:07] It cast your cares on Jesus for he cares
[1:38:10] for you how many really believe that he
[1:38:13] cares for you tonight you really you
[1:38:14] really believe
[1:38:15] that I'm more convinced than ever in my
[1:38:18] life that he cares for me I have so many
[1:38:21] testimonies I could fill the whole
[1:38:22] service with testimonies
[1:38:24] where God shows up with eight kids and
[1:38:26] I'm I'm a teacher I'm not a rich man
[1:38:27] everybody knows that if you know
[1:38:29] anything about teaching I'm no rich man
[1:38:32] you know in Ohio you can look up every
[1:38:33] teacher's income you can go look up my
[1:38:34] income after service if you want it's on
[1:38:36] there every it has it's public
[1:38:38] information but we we've been so down on
[1:38:41] finances sometimes one time a few years
[1:38:43] ago was it was two it was 2020 no 20 19
[1:38:48] we we bought an old Fixer Upper House
[1:38:50] you know that's all I could afford
[1:38:53] and my wife you know we just had a real
[1:38:55] small kitchen I mean it was maybe and we
[1:38:56] had already had six kids by that time it
[1:38:58] was maybe like this you know maybe and
[1:39:00] uh she was just saying brother Jesse

[1:39:04] make more money what's wrong with me
[1:39:05] like I'm such a loser you know that's
[1:39:08] what I was thinking and I was just I was
[1:39:10] holding the baby there and I just said a
[1:39:11] prayer I said Lord perhaps in 10 years
[1:39:13] you can you can give me a new kitchen to
[1:39:15] help out my wife she worked so hard she
[1:39:17] feeds feeds six children plus me she

[1:41:42] every Church goes through trials the
[1:41:43] brother M says if you don't go through
[1:41:44] trials you're not a true
[1:41:48] church so he left and he was a musician

[1:41:51] Arizona and I'm going to try to become a
[1:41:53] famous musician he got into Satanism all
[1:41:55] these
[1:41:56] things and I'd already baptized him

[1:48:31] about this this is thirsting for life
[1:48:33] march
[1:48:35] 1960 he says uh see friends you're thir
[1:48:38] you have thirst inside of you have you
[1:48:41] ever tried to satisfy that say well I'll
[1:48:43] go downtown and buy some new clothes he
[1:48:45] says that isn't it that's not going to
[1:48:47] satisfy your
[1:48:49] thirst maybe you need no new clothes
[1:48:52] that's leg legitimate he
[1:48:54] says but when you just make that your
[1:48:58] idol of how you must listen be so SP and
[1:49:02] span all the
[1:49:06] time maybe it's your home maybe it's
[1:49:09] something else that's taken the place of
[1:49:11] that thirst and calling it ought to be
[1:49:13] God God is that satisfying
[1:49:16] portion do you hear what he
[1:49:18] said he said you making sure you're
[1:49:20] clothed you look you he he cleaned up
[1:49:23] really good tonight I saw him earlier
[1:49:24] you know he was rubbing those uh those
[1:49:26] worms on there he was putting the worms
[1:49:27] on there throwing the fish back in his
[1:49:28] hands were all dirty he cleans up really
[1:49:30] good over
[1:49:32] here I tried to clean up as good as him
[1:49:34] by God's
[1:49:36] grace Hallelujah but brother says if
[1:49:39] you're not careful looking proper and
[1:49:41] looking nice new clothes he said be can
[1:49:44] become an idol how do you
[1:49:46] know when when it when it hurts your
[1:49:48] walk with God if you're not all looking
[1:49:50] your best you feel like you're you're
[1:49:52] lost you feel like you're less
[1:49:54] than and church I'll say like this if
[1:49:56] you spend more time looking in the
[1:49:58] mirror than looking in the
[1:50:00] Bible something's probably wrong because
[1:50:04] the bi the Bible said the Bible's a
[1:50:05] mirror look in the mirror of God's word
[1:50:07] amen James chapter one amen look in the
[1:50:10] word the mirror of God's word
[1:50:15] hallelujah now the sister out in
[1:50:17] Pennsylvania she said her SPI and span
[1:50:20] house became an idol and here's what she
[1:50:22] said
[1:50:24] before the church on W every Wednesday
[1:50:25] and every Sunday if the house wasn't SP
[1:50:27] and span clean she was walking around
[1:50:29] screaming at her children and her
[1:50:30] husband this needs to be clean this
[1:50:32] needs to be clean and what kind of
[1:50:33] atmosphere did that create before
[1:50:36] church we're not leaving till this is
[1:50:39] clean it's got to be SP and span and she
[1:50:41] comes up to this side of the church
[1:50:44] crying brother Jesse I have an idol in
[1:50:46] my life it's SP and
[1:50:49] span and see when you're late to church
[1:50:51] then you're not in the you're not in the
[1:50:52] right the
[1:50:54] atmosphere to sing to worship to give
[1:50:56] God praise and the church
[1:50:58] said and she wept her way to repentance
[1:51:01] now Church none of us none of us believe
[1:51:03] in a dirty house none of us believe in
[1:51:04] dir wearing dirty clothes and holes in
[1:51:06] them or something like that but it but
[1:51:08] so but things so simple can become Idols
[1:51:11] in our life if we're not careful and if
[1:51:13] that becomes an idol it creates an evil
[1:51:15] spirit something dies in the home but
[1:51:17] God's got a solution for us tonight
[1:51:20] hallelujah amen amen
[1:51:23] we don't have to let the death stay in
[1:51:25] the house
[1:51:31] amen
[1:51:34] hallelujah is that
[1:51:38] right pise the
[1:51:40] Lord
[1:51:42] hallelujah that's true
[1:51:44] church this is all true this is what
[1:51:46] brother BR taught us hallelujah anything
[1:51:48] can become an idol he said he said your
[1:51:50] husband can become an idol your wife can
[1:51:51] become an idol your car can become an
[1:51:53] idol some of you Brothers your guns
[1:51:55] might become an idol
[1:51:57] brothers sisters your your SP and span
[1:52:01] house can become an idol your general
[1:52:04] appearance can become an idol anything
[1:52:06] that takes away from the Lord can become
[1:52:08] an
[1:52:09] Idol Hallelujah I'm trying to bring this
[1:52:12] down to a close bear with me here here
[1:52:15] here here's an idol I didn't realize I I
[1:52:18] preached this at our church
[1:52:19] recently and you know you're a pastor
[1:52:21] brother Thomas and sometimes you feel
[1:52:23] the anointing my everybody's in one
[1:52:24] Accord sometimes you don't and so
[1:52:27] recently one of these Wednesday nights I
[1:52:28] was preaching I'm enjoying the preaching
[1:52:30] I'm like is anybody else hearing
[1:52:31] anything I'm saying tonight Lord did I
[1:52:33] miss your mind
[1:52:35] somehow help me Jesus you just got to
[1:52:38] press through the sermon sometimes you
[1:52:39] know people come in tired or you know
[1:52:42] but I brought up Hebrews 12:15 which
[1:52:45] says looking diligently lest any man
[1:52:47] fail the grace of God and a root of
[1:52:50] bitterness spring up among you
[1:52:53] yeah and I just I spent maybe one minute
[1:52:55] on
[1:52:57] bitterness and bitterness can become an
[1:53:00] idol it became an idol in one person's
[1:53:02] life I just shared a brief example of
[1:53:04] bitterness in my life uh when I was
[1:53:06] growing up I was 13 years old my mom and
[1:53:07] dad had six kids I was fourth out of
[1:53:10] six my dad left my mom with six
[1:53:14] kids now it was both their faults it was
[1:53:16] both their fault I I seen it but it was
[1:53:19] awful for my dad to leave right
[1:53:23] and so from that moment on you know and
[1:53:25] I I I I uh I don't know if you knew this
[1:53:26] but I got into sports I was a state
[1:53:27] champion in football state champion in
[1:53:29] track I played football at akan they're
[1:53:31] division one school it's LeBron james'
[1:53:33] Hometown I played against Michael Vic
[1:53:35] Ben rossberger now they whipped us but
[1:53:37] you know at least we got to play against
[1:53:38] them you know at least I got to say I
[1:53:40] got whipped by that
[1:53:43] guy but as I was going to play football
[1:53:46] I still had this bitterness against my
[1:53:48] dad I was 19 years old when I went to
[1:53:50] college right 19 years old but and in
[1:53:53] college I started hanging around some
[1:53:55] Christians because I had no other
[1:53:56] friends I I knew you know I KN I didn't
[1:53:59] want to be like these guys at the party
[1:54:01] so I just I was raised in church so I
[1:54:03] just gravitated toward these Christian
[1:54:05] guys and I went to an athletes and
[1:54:07] action conference and I saw a 6 foot6
[1:54:10] offensive lineman from Ohio State named
[1:54:13] Tim Anderson I saw him raise his hands
[1:54:16] like this he's a redheaded big guy he
[1:54:18] was he was like a big Jolly guy you know
[1:54:20] they won a national championship but I
[1:54:22] was in the same room with him I was
[1:54:23] sitting right behind him I saw that guy
[1:54:25] raise his hands and tears started
[1:54:27] pouring down my face and I thought shame
[1:54:30] on me here I'm 19 years old I was raised
[1:54:32] in church and here's a man bigger than
[1:54:34] me stronger than me and he's got enough
[1:54:36] love for God to raise his hands shame on
[1:54:39] me I'm afraid to worship
[1:54:41] God and that was the moment I repented
[1:54:44] of my sins and I became a
[1:54:47] Christian Hallelujah I went back to my
[1:54:50] dorm room I was a I went back to my dorm
[1:54:53] room I took down all my dirty pictures
[1:54:55] off the wall I took all my Snoop Dog
[1:54:57] ACDC Tim McGraw I took those CDs you
[1:55:00] guys don't know what CDs are but I took
[1:55:01] those CDs and I threw them in the trash
[1:55:03] amen and I opened up my Bible and I
[1:55:06] started reading
[1:55:09] Hallelujah and I came to Matthew
[1:55:12] 7 and it said not everyone that says to
[1:55:14] me Lord Lord will enter in the kingdom
[1:55:16] of
[1:55:17] God you cast out Devils even though you
[1:55:20] cast out Devils heal the sick I never
[1:55:21] knew your workers iniquity I thought oh
[1:55:24] my but then shortly I'll get back to
[1:55:26] that but shortly after that we went down
[1:55:28] to see my dad in Tennessee and I had a
[1:55:30] hatred for him but before I went down I
[1:55:32] wrote him a letter and while I'm writing
[1:55:33] that letter the Holy Spirit came on me I
[1:55:35] didn't know the message the Holy Spirit
[1:55:36] came on me I read my Bible and it said
[1:55:38] Jesus said if you don't forgive those
[1:55:40] the other people I won't forgive you I
[1:55:43] started crying I don't even know the
[1:55:46] message I'm like Dad I forgive you I'm
[1:55:49] going to come we're going to come pick
[1:55:50] you up we're going to bring you back
[1:55:51] home
[1:55:54] I sent that down there and church as
[1:55:57] soon as I wrote that I could feel the
[1:55:58] bitterness lift off my life I mean I
[1:56:01] hated my dad he wasn't there he wasn't
[1:56:03] there when I won State he wasn't there
[1:56:05] when when I broke the records he wasn't
[1:56:07] there on senior night my mom just walked
[1:56:09] me across I didn't have a dad for senior
[1:56:12] night but I did have a Heavenly dad amen
[1:56:16] he never left me he never forsook me
[1:56:18] hallelujah amen praise God
[1:56:24] so we drove down there and I hugged my
[1:56:25] dad after years of hating him six years
[1:56:27] of hating him i' felt that rud of
[1:56:30] bitterness rise up right I felt that
[1:56:33] evil spirit lead me and I felt clean I'm
[1:56:34] a brand new Christian I feel like I
[1:56:36] could walk on the clouds amen I feel
[1:56:38] like I could tackle Michael Vic although
[1:56:39] I couldn't amen I felt like
[1:56:42] it Hallelujah that's
[1:56:46] right but I felt that root of bitterness
[1:56:48] and recently we had somebody come up
[1:56:50] just a few Services ago and said brother
[1:56:52] Jesse I've been struggled with roots of
[1:56:53] bitterness towards my family for years
[1:56:55] we prayed church it was that service I'm
[1:56:57] like is God ever going to where is God
[1:56:58] in this service how come there's no
[1:56:59] anointing as soon as we started praying
[1:57:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:57:03] dropped we started weeping and crying
[1:57:05] praising God worshiping God and she got
[1:57:07] delivered from that Spirit of bitterness
[1:57:09] hallelujah praise God
[1:57:11] amen amen that became an
[1:57:15] idol and now she can forgive this family
[1:57:18] member when before she
[1:57:21] couldn't and then just fast forward one
[1:57:23] more year my brother Simon heard the
[1:57:25] message from Craig Boer and Isaiah
[1:57:28] Brooks he gave me my life story by
[1:57:30] William brandham I'd never heard brother
[1:57:32] brandham preach this now this goes back
[1:57:34] to the cassette tape days you guys don't
[1:57:37] know what cassette tapes
[1:57:40] are I was on College you probably do
[1:57:43] huh I was on college break I was I was a
[1:57:46] new Christian but I was still chewing
[1:57:47] tobacco I was still smoking cigarettes
[1:57:49] I'm a Christian yep Christian
[1:57:52] and I put brother brandom in the
[1:57:53] cassette tape Li life story I'm playing
[1:57:56] Nintendo video games this is uh
[1:58:00] 200201 and
[1:58:03] this brother BR starts talking and as
[1:58:06] he's
[1:58:07] talking I start forgetting about the
[1:58:10] game and I just start
[1:58:12] crying I'm like I have never heard a man
[1:58:14] preach like this
[1:58:16] before it the Holy Ghost come on me so
[1:58:18] powerfully I had just set the Nintendo
[1:58:20] system down and I I just had to listen
[1:58:22] to brother brandom and I haven't stopped
[1:58:24] listening to him since by God's
[1:58:26] grace
[1:58:28] Hallelujah there's a voice within the
[1:58:31] voice hallelujah
[1:58:34] amen there's the voice within the voice
[1:58:37] the voice of Christ in brother R's
[1:58:42] voice and then I heard him preach
[1:58:43] anointed that ones at the end time and I
[1:58:46] shouted I said Hallelujah now I
[1:58:48] understand Matthew 7 hallelujah oh
[1:58:51] brother AR said the Holy Ghost is the
[1:58:53] dissolver of all doubt
[1:58:55] hallelujah oh let me try to close here
[1:58:58] by God's
[1:58:59] grace oh I love this message
[1:59:04] amen
[1:59:06] glory let me try to close I got all
[1:59:08] these slides here got if you don't clean
[1:59:11] out your house Saints you'll be like aen
[1:59:13] and Eli Kora and Dayan ananas and
[1:59:19] Safa they let their houses get
[1:59:23] defiled they let the dead things remain
[1:59:25] in their
[1:59:27] house I've talked to other uh children
[1:59:30] of pastors uh up there in
[1:59:34] Ohio and they said when they were
[1:59:36] teenagers it's like the Holy Ghost gave
[1:59:38] their parents like a special discernment
[1:59:40] they could almost like sniff out like
[1:59:42] the worldly music or the cigarettes in
[1:59:45] their purses and different things like
[1:59:47] that
[1:59:49] Hallelujah see God has to give the
[1:59:51] parents discernment in order to keep the
[1:59:53] house clean so the spirit of God can
[1:59:56] move that's right now parents let me
[1:59:58] give you a little clue when I was a
[1:59:59] sinner I would go in the bathroom and
[2:00:01] just say my stomach hurts i' just go in
[2:00:02] the bathroom and Chew Chew Tobacco or do
[2:00:05] evil things and I'd lock myself in the
[2:00:07] bathroom just so you parents if you need
[2:00:08] any clues when they're spending time
[2:00:10] alone and doing things you know this
[2:00:12] little seems a little
[2:00:14] strange that can be a sign that they're
[2:00:16] involved in
[2:00:18] sin Hallelujah so that's a good time to
[2:00:21] start asking asking questions why are
[2:00:23] you in those so long or why were you
[2:00:25] late the other night or what what do you
[2:00:27] what what you got in there in that bag
[2:00:28] what why do you smell like this why do
[2:00:30] you you need to ask questions because
[2:00:34] that that that that sin can defile the
[2:00:36] whole house then you wonder why you feel
[2:00:39] a little different you don't feel as
[2:00:41] close to God
[2:00:44] hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[2:00:46] something can die in the house and
[2:00:48] everything in the house needs cleaned
[2:00:50] amen glory thank you Lord this was
[2:00:53] preached by your
[2:00:55] Prophet Hallelujah I'm so glad it was
[2:00:59] I'm so glad it was but there's men that
[2:01:01] cleaned out their home Jacob
[2:01:04] Gideon all kinds of Godly men that clean
[2:01:06] out their houses
[2:01:10] amen now what I'll do is this
[2:01:13] here I want to say this brother Ram said
[2:01:17] I love this quote now let's bring it
[2:01:18] down home brother said now my Baptist
[2:01:21] brother I want to ask you something if
[2:01:23] justification is all that God requires
[2:01:26] I'd like to ask you this now he's
[2:01:27] talking about elaser and the Waters of
[2:01:30] Separation when the man was separated By
[2:01:32] the Waters of Separation sprinkled then
[2:01:34] he could not enter in the worship of the
[2:01:37] glory the lord he could not do it okay
[2:01:41] it's because he was only sprinkled from
[2:01:43] his sins it's separated from his sins
[2:01:45] but it did not put him into
[2:01:48] Fellowship Hallelujah so brother said
[2:01:50] when a man sins he couldn't even get to
[2:01:53] the outer court because he needed to be
[2:01:57] sprinkled and what does brother R say a
[2:02:00] Baptist person believes in baptism they
[2:02:02] believe in the cross and the church said
[2:02:04] yeah who's ever been to a Baptist Church
[2:02:06] before don't don't they preach the blood
[2:02:07] of Jesus don't they yes brother say the
[2:02:11] Baptist says I just got to be saved
[2:02:12] that's all I got to do brother Ram says
[2:02:14] no this show you you got to go deeper
[2:02:19] in if you if you don't conf any sin you
[2:02:23] can't even go into the first
[2:02:25] court if you live in sin and don't clear
[2:02:27] out the idols in your life you can't go
[2:02:29] to the first Court well if you can't go
[2:02:31] to the first court you ain't getting to
[2:02:32] the second court and if you don't get to
[2:02:34] the second Court brother says you're not
[2:02:36] getting into fellowship with God in the
[2:02:38] holy of
[2:02:40] holies does everybody see that what an
[2:02:43] amazing revelation God gave to brother
[2:02:45] Bram I haven't heard any other preachers
[2:02:47] preach this it was a prophetic
[2:02:50] Revelation Hallelujah
[2:02:53] I believe it was finishing the mystery
[2:02:55] of God hallelujah the mystery of
[2:02:57] godliness becoming like God
[2:03:01] hallelujah that's how you become like
[2:03:03] God outer Court inner Court holiest of
[2:03:07] holies how many believe
[2:03:11] that so brother Ram says you got to go
[2:03:13] all the way in you got to go into the
[2:03:15] holiest of holies if you want to have
[2:03:18] fellowship with God how do we know
[2:03:20] because you ask a b you ask a Baptist
[2:03:23] can a woman cut her hair they'll say of
[2:03:24] course she can cut her hair that was an
[2:03:25] Old Testament custom but if that
[2:03:28] preacher would have went into the Holi
[2:03:29] of holies God would have told him the
[2:03:31] Bible says a man NE a woman never cuts
[2:03:33] her hair is that right brother
[2:03:35] Hallelujah he would have got thus say
[2:03:37] the Lord he would had fellowship with
[2:03:39] God if he would have went into the
[2:03:41] holiest of holies praise
[2:03:44] God that's right uh how should we be
[2:03:47] baptized Baptist preacher oh Father Son
[2:03:49] Holy Ghost is all right that proves he
[2:03:51] never went to the holy of
[2:03:52] holies CU God will say keep reading the
[2:03:55] book of Acts there's five baptisms and
[2:03:58] every time they are baptized in the name
[2:04:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's
[2:04:04] power in one name
[2:04:07] Hallelujah is that
[2:04:10] right now let me bring this down to us I
[2:04:13] saw a lot of hands earlier that said
[2:04:16] you're born again and I say hallelujah
[2:04:18] to
[2:04:20] that but brother brother I this
[2:04:22] Revelation came to me in 2 2017 I'd
[2:04:25] already been pastoring for 11 years and
[2:04:27] brother I'd Wonder many times as a
[2:04:28] pastor I'd sit in my study and think how
[2:04:30] can these
[2:04:31] people no not not many just a few how
[2:04:34] can these few people come to church they
[2:04:36] never cry they never shout like me they
[2:04:40] never spit like me they never scream
[2:04:43] like me they never dance like me they
[2:04:46] don't clap they don't speak in tongues
[2:04:48] they don't pray for the sick they just
[2:04:50] stare at me all the time how can someone
[2:04:52] come to this church this long and they
[2:04:54] sit there like that and then God showed
[2:04:55] me
[2:04:57] this see where I'm
[2:05:00] going they can come to a message Church
[2:05:03] they can physically come into the church
[2:05:06] but spiritually they're not even in the
[2:05:09] church because something died in their
[2:05:11] home that's
[2:05:14] right and spiritual death has settled
[2:05:17] over that person's life many times with
[2:05:19] men it's
[2:05:20] pornography right or bitterness towards
[2:05:22] their
[2:05:23] wives
[2:05:25] right and so if that sin is
[2:05:28] unconfessed death has covered them and
[2:05:31] they come to church and you can't move
[2:05:34] them you preach the word of God doesn't
[2:05:37] move
[2:05:39] them something's wrong with
[2:05:42] that God showed me that that's why
[2:05:46] people and I found out later in our
[2:05:47] church that's what the problem
[2:05:48] was unconfessed sin
[2:05:52] imagine you're a Jew brother said
[2:05:54] somebody died in your house you got to
[2:05:56] go to the priest he sprinkles you with
[2:05:57] the water of Separation sprinkle
[2:06:00] Hallelujah you wait seven days now you
[2:06:02] can go to church those Brothers say
[2:06:04] welcome back to church you're all clean
[2:06:06] come on in oh I see you got your Lamb
[2:06:08] with you for a sin offering yes I do I
[2:06:10] sin but God for God's going to forgive
[2:06:12] me I'm going to sacrifice
[2:06:13] this and you walk into church and what's
[2:06:16] the first place you go to the Brazen
[2:06:19] altar you say priest here's my spotless
[2:06:22] lamb this is the one this is the one
[2:06:24] that's real special to me this was the
[2:06:25] most beautiful of all of them and I have
[2:06:27] to have this killed because I mistreated
[2:06:29] my
[2:06:30] wife that's a sin offering I sinned
[2:06:33] against my
[2:06:34] wife and can you imagine if that's your
[2:06:36] favorite lamb how about your favorite
[2:06:38] you know you you put your favorite
[2:06:39] animal in there and you've got to watch
[2:06:41] that animal cut
[2:06:43] it and it bleeds
[2:06:46] out that would mean something to you
[2:06:49] this died for me
[2:06:53] see now now the shedding of blood it
[2:06:55] becomes a more dear thing oh thank God I
[2:06:58] can be forgiven now now now it means
[2:07:01] something but you know how most people
[2:07:03] went to church in Jews days they just
[2:07:05] took their Beth slam there it is ah they
[2:07:06] were checking their smartphones in their
[2:07:08] days too yeah all right just get it over
[2:07:11] with come on priest I got to get to work
[2:07:13] come on man what are you waiting for see
[2:07:16] the blood didn't move him anymore are
[2:07:19] you with me church are you with me
[2:07:21] that's right and that's why we can
[2:07:23] preach about the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:07:25] we can study and we'll weep and cry as
[2:07:27] God shows us scriptures about the blood
[2:07:29] and the cross it'll never lose its power
[2:07:32] Hallelujah but then for so many people
[2:07:35] the blood has lost its power but the
[2:07:37] Bible said it can never lose its
[2:07:41] power why is it ineffective anymore
[2:07:44] because something's done but let me tell
[2:07:47] you you can be clean
[2:07:49] Hallelujah let's end our
[2:07:53] may God help us not to be people that
[2:07:57] come to church with d things in our
[2:07:58] homes and the blood doesn't even move us
[2:08:04] anymore the wash after that they had to
[2:08:06] wash in the labor but said that's the
[2:08:09] washing of the Waters of the word also
[2:08:11] ties water baptism some new person gets
[2:08:14] baptized oh big deal I can't make the
[2:08:16] baptism I don't care what happened this
[2:08:20] used to be so Wonder wonderful it it
[2:08:22] could have been your
[2:08:24] child it could have been you and you
[2:08:27] can't feel this anymore what
[2:08:30] happened you've been spiritually cut
[2:08:33] off you're cut off you can't come into
[2:08:37] even the outer Court even the even the
[2:08:39] baptism even the cross doesn't move you
[2:08:42] anymore and if that doesn't move you
[2:08:45] when you get in the Holy place the the
[2:08:46] Candlestick the church ages you can you
[2:08:48] can preach a hundred sermons on the
[2:08:50] Ephesian Church age it never move these
[2:08:52] people cuz they're they got dead stuff
[2:08:54] all over their
[2:08:56] house you could preach all seven Church
[2:08:59] ages you could do that and it doesn't
[2:09:02] move people anymore they don't want to
[2:09:04] go listen to they don't want to do this
[2:09:06] or that because something is died in
[2:09:07] their
[2:09:09] house no wonder they don't pray anymore
[2:09:11] that's the altar of incense that was the
[2:09:13] last thing before the holiest of holies
[2:09:15] no wonder they can't even hear from
[2:09:18] God they're not they're cut off they're
[2:09:20] not going in in there to the holiest of
[2:09:22] holies they don't know the will of God
[2:09:25] for how many children I should have
[2:09:26] where I should move what job I should
[2:09:28] have they don't have th sayith the Lord
[2:09:30] because they're not in fellowship with
[2:09:33] God because they're fellowshipping with
[2:09:35] dead
[2:09:39] things they're fellowshipping with dead
[2:09:41] things that's right and so God has to
[2:09:44] cut them off until they come God's
[2:09:46] provided way Hallelujah glory to God
[2:09:50] glory to God

[2:10:24] God's bread cannot get stale
[2:10:26] Hallelujah but you think it's stale it's
[2:10:30] impossible it's because you you've let
[2:10:32] something die in your house that's right

[2:11:38] conscience you know what you need you
[2:11:40] need a sprinkling that's what you
[2:11:43] need you know what I need when I fall
[2:11:46] short I need a sprinkling it's in the
[2:11:48] New Testament 1 Peter 1 verse2 said
[2:11:51] sprinkling unto The Obedience of the
[2:11:54] Holy Spirit now I'm I'm switching that
[2:11:56] up unto obedience and the sprinkling of
[2:11:59] the blood of Jesus Christ I always
[2:12:00] wonder brother why does a why does Peter
[2:12:02] talk about sprinkling because it's the
[2:12:05] type of the Waters of separation and if
[2:12:08] anybody needed the sprinkling it was
[2:12:09] Peter all his mistakes he
[2:12:12] made every time he come back to Jesus
[2:12:14] Jesus was spiritually sprinkle you're
[2:12:17] forgiven you're forgiven I forgive you
[2:12:21] come back to
[2:12:22] worship come back to my
[2:12:25] presence while they're playing that
[2:12:27] would anybody be honest tonight and say
[2:12:29] brother Jesse I I need to get back in

[2:12:33] honest and say that tonight God bless
[2:12:35] those hands bless that hand bless that
[2:12:37] hand go bless that hand God sees that
[2:12:39] hand God sees that hand God sees that
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:46] hand I'm going to say a general General
[2:12:48] prayer for everybody and then after that
[2:12:50] if you need special prayer you're more
[2:12:52] than welcome to come up to the front now
[2:12:54] if your hand was up you be sincere now
[2:12:56] imagine if something died there's a dead
[2:12:59] carcass in your house how you would try
[2:13:01] to clean that up oh my
[2:13:04] goodness if there was a dead animal or
[2:13:06] something dead in my house I do
