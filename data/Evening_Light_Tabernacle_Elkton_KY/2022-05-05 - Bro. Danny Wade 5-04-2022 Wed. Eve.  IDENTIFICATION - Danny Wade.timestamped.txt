[37:10] my potential i believe i believe i
[37:12] believe that satan
[37:15] satan and must not know
[37:17] something
[37:18] that that
[37:19] might happen
[37:21] in tonight
[37:22] ain't um
[37:24] something that might might happen
[37:25] tonight that might change people's lives
[37:28] like
[37:29] he doesn't he doesn't want me up here
[37:32] satan doesn't and he'll do whatever he
[37:33] can to get to
[37:35] to to keep me out of this pulpit
[37:38] amen
[37:41] now um
[37:44] what we just read was um the
[37:47] about the
[37:48] church of this day now the people of
[37:51] this day um the churches
[37:54] um are lukewarm they uh
[38:00] and they don't know it they don't know
[38:02] who they are
[38:03] the the churches of this state
[38:06] uh the
[38:07] baptists the methodists all of them
[38:11] they don't know who they are
[38:13] and and there's
[38:15] there's people today that uh
[38:19] like the um
[38:23] p people all deciding that they're going
[38:25] to be
[38:27] they can't decide whether they're a male
[38:29] or a female they can't decide
[38:31] if
[38:34] they can't decide what um
[38:37] what gender they are and and they're
[38:39] like who am i like they're wondering who
[38:42] are they they don't know who they are
[38:44] and so so i was i was just thinking
[38:47] about this i
[38:48] uh the the churches of today don't know
[38:52] who they are
[38:53] they don't know
[38:55] who they are but
[38:56] but we do know who we are tonight if
[39:01] and
[39:03] they they think that well
[39:06] um you know we're
[39:08] uh
[39:11] you know and they said someone will say
[39:13] well i'm a baptist i'm a methodist or
[39:16] whatever
[39:17] i'm a christian
[39:19] right
[39:20] and
[39:22] but but yet this bible
[39:25] well
[39:26] we'll tell
[39:27] will say something different and and yet
[39:29] they they look at um
[39:32] a church or so someone else who who
[39:36] where do they look to to see who they
[39:38] are
[39:39] and
[39:41] now uh let's see what um
[39:45] here what uh brother branham said and
[39:48] and that's what we we want to look at
[39:50] tonight i want to look at me i want you
[39:54] to look at yourself
[39:55] that we're going to speak about some of
[39:58] the characters of other times
[40:01] and i want to see myself in in god's
[40:04] looking glass and then how many how many
[40:06] wants to look in in god's looking glass
[40:09] see what what does god
[40:11] say who does god say i am
[40:13] not not who
[40:14] my church says i am who who my religion
[40:18] says i am
[40:20] because if anything will show you
[40:23] where you're standing it's hit this book
[40:26] there is no book like it because it is
[40:29] all truth i don't
[40:31] say that other books are not true but i
[40:34] i know this one is true it's all truth
[40:37] because it's the word of god
[40:42] now jesus gave us the example of what we
[40:45] ought to be looking at when when he
[40:47] reflected his life to us through through
[40:50] the word
[40:53] and what we should see
[40:56] when we look into god's mirror we should
[40:59] see ourself identified with him that's a
[41:01] perfect example
[41:04] amen when we um
[41:08] sometimes we we get caught up with like
[41:11] well i'm uh i'm um
[41:13] a carpenter i'm a i i do this you
[41:16] someone will ask you who who are you
[41:19] oh like my name is daniel wade
[41:22] i
[41:23] am
[41:24] a
[41:25] christian i
[41:27] um
[41:30] i am a
[41:33] person who
[41:34] um
[41:36] what whatever it's like it's like you'll
[41:39] go on about like you're this or that
[41:41] about like your character
[41:44] and who you are
[41:45] and
[41:46] when we
[41:47] we follow jesus christ we must follow
[41:50] this word he's the the perfect example
[41:53] so when and people look at you do they
[41:56] see jesus christ that's that's really
[41:59] the only thing that matters
[42:05] now jesus gave us the example of what we
[42:07] ought to be looking at
[42:09] when he reflected his life to us through
[42:11] through the word
[42:12] what
[42:13] we
[42:14] we should see when when we look into
[42:16] god's mirror we should see ourself
[42:18] identified with him that's the perfect
[42:20] example i probably didn't read this
[42:22] twice
[42:23] but anyways
[42:25] um
[42:28] now i remember there's this person at
[42:30] work at the place i used to work at
[42:34] um
[42:35] her name uh was um autumn
[42:39] um
[42:40] one day i asked her if she knew jesus
[42:43] she said yeah she's a christian
[42:46] but yet yet i've seen her her life she
[42:49] she drunk and smoke and all this stuff
[42:52] and and i was surprised like
[42:55] why do you say you're a christian when
[42:58] when your life doesn't show it your life
[43:00] doesn't reflect who jesus christ is
[43:03] and and so i told her that that
[43:06] i i told her to be christian she would
[43:09] have to follow the word and she shut me
[43:11] down and told me
[43:13] she believes differently
[43:15] you know she just looks at the bible a
[43:17] little bit
[43:18] differently like
[43:19] um
[43:20] she says oh well you know if i follow
[43:22] jesus christ i
[43:24] believe that he died on the cross for me
[43:26] and that's it that's it that's all
[43:28] and but yet her her life doesn't show
[43:31] that her life doesn't show who
[43:34] her life reflects who she is
[43:38] see your life reflects who
[43:40] who you are it reflects who who you are
[43:43] and and if you aren't living
[43:46] according to this word
[43:49] then
[43:49] [Music]
[43:51] then and that doesn't mean it makes you
[43:53] a
[43:55] a liar when you say you're a christian
[43:57] but don't follow this word
[44:09] now but we find out that as as we go
[44:12] along through life that that our
[44:14] character molds the image that we are
[44:17] each one knows that
[44:21] you as as you live so so as your
[44:24] character molds you
[44:26] to
[44:27] what you are now now you have seen
[44:30] people that just love to be around yet
[44:33] they
[44:34] they might not exactly be in your
[44:36] bracket of society and again
[44:39] and they might be a different race
[44:41] the colored or the brown or the yellow
[44:43] but they're just something about that
[44:45] character that you just love to be in
[44:47] their presence because each person is a
[44:50] a little
[44:51] dynamo of their own
[44:54] and and you
[44:56] you put out an atmosphere
[45:00] and then and then you see people that
[45:01] that were not noble people but yet you
[45:05] were always glad to get away from them
[45:07] it's just that they they create an
[45:09] atmosphere around
[45:10] where where you are
[45:13] nothing nothing against them they're
[45:14] nice people but you just don't like the
[45:17] atmosphere
[45:18] they they're
[45:20] in in their character creates whatever
[45:23] they are
[45:24] makes them what they are
[45:27] amen
[45:35] now um
[45:37] like i was saying um
[45:39] that they are um
[45:43] poor and blind and naked and they don't
[45:45] know it
[45:46] and and they um go on saying saying oh
[45:50] i'm a good person i i do this i do
[45:54] that
[45:55] well
[45:58] this this bible
[46:01] um
[46:02] if you don't if they don't follow this
[46:03] bible exactly
[46:05] then
[46:07] then um they're a liar and
[46:11] and when they when people say oh i'm a
[46:13] christian i follow god but don't follow
[46:15] this word and they're a liar
[46:22] excuse me
[46:34] amen um
[46:36] so uh
[46:39] in revelations 3 5 it says he that
[46:42] overcometh the
[46:43] same shall be clothed in white raiment
[46:45] and and i will not blow his name out of
[46:48] the book of life i will confess his name
[46:51] before my father be in before his angels
[46:54] satan will try try to tell us
[46:57] who
[46:58] who we we are he says you are nothing
[47:01] you you you claim to be a christian but
[47:04] yet yeah here you are failing all the
[47:06] time and
[47:08] and falling down and messing up look at
[47:11] you you're nothing but but
[47:14] uh someone who who's uh who pretends to
[47:16] be a christian you
[47:18] satan will try to tell you that you are
[47:20] not uh who who you say you are who you
[47:23] claim to be satan will try to pull you
[47:25] down and tell you that that you you are
[47:28] not
[47:29] who
[47:30] you are not a part of this bride you are
[47:32] not going into rapture satan will always
[47:34] put these things in you and try to to
[47:36] tell you these things that aren't true
[47:39] but don't listen to it because satan is
[47:42] nothing but a liar and and
[47:45] and this bible says you are
[47:48] sons and daughters of god and and
[47:50] whatever satan and tries to put in there
[47:54] tries to twist something he always tries
[47:57] to do that
[47:58] but but we gotta take god out of his
[48:00] word and believe it over everything that
[48:02] satan tries to say because
[48:05] as uh
[48:06] as you are chosen you are
[48:09] i i chose you before the foundation of
[48:12] the world i'll you are
[48:14] a
[48:15] a son you are
[48:17] my daughter you are
[48:22] says you are because this is god's word
[48:24] and that is god god
[48:27] speaking and god speaks through his word
[48:31] and
[48:33] and and if you believe that over
[48:35] everything satan tries to tell you then
[48:38] then um
[48:41] that then you'll be unstoppable satan
[48:43] won't be able to put anything in it and
[48:46] to stop you he won't be able to say
[48:48] anything to stop you if you just believe
[48:50] that word and and not accept anything
[48:53] that satan tries to tell you
[48:58] man there's some people that that say
[49:01] they try to they find their identity in
[49:04] different things
[49:05] there's people that i idolize hollywood
[49:07] stars they they fall
[49:13] they fall so so much in love with their
[49:15] idol that they try to look like them and
[49:17] act like them and if
[49:21] if if they would be like that about
[49:25] jesus the world would be in a better
[49:27] place i mean
[49:29] they they say well this is my favorite
[49:31] idol
[49:32] uh i i was kind of like that about uh
[49:37] my favorite rapper a long time ago i
[49:39] started rapping and i started trying to
[49:41] copy him and i even
[49:44] wore a hoodie all the time
[49:45] and that that wasn't in that time i i
[49:48] got that spirit of
[49:50] um
[49:51] rap music on me and i was was trying to
[49:55] rap i was trying i thought it was cool
[49:57] trying to look like and make the the
[49:59] rapper and i
[50:02] i mean come on somebody i mean
[50:06] we get like that that uh sometimes to
[50:09] where we we want to be like someone else
[50:11] we oh we like that person we like we
[50:13] like who they are we like everything
[50:15] about that person
[50:16] uh like
[50:18] let's say say you're a
[50:20] football player you want to be
[50:23] like
[50:24] uh tommy brady or someone like that you
[50:28] want to be a really good
[50:29] um
[50:31] football player or whatever
[50:35] because you want to be like them you
[50:36] think it's cool it's what whatever yeah
[50:38] and
[50:42] and and but jesus
[50:44] set the example he said follow me
[50:48] be like me do what what i do
[50:50] and and uh
[50:53] and and uh
[50:55] live like he he wants us to live follow
[50:58] this word that's his example that's what
[51:00] he wants us to do
[51:10] and
[51:11] and um
[51:22] sometimes
[51:23] we
[51:28] we we don't know
[51:30] where to go and we don't know which way
[51:32] to
[51:33] um
[51:35] to go we don't we don't always know what
[51:37] what the right uh
[51:39] things to do right things to say
[51:43] when you get put on on the spot and
[51:46] sometimes sometimes you say stupid
[51:47] things you'll do
[51:49] stupid thing and sometimes
[51:51] and
[51:57] and um
[52:01] but but we got to we got um follow uh uh
[52:08] this this word well anyways um let's see
[52:11] over here where uh
[52:16] okay okay
[52:20] okay here's here's another place what
[52:22] will what brother branham said
[52:24] um he's the same same jesus
[52:27] yesterday today and forever the same
[52:29] type of character a man that professes
[52:32] to be a christian must have a christ
[52:34] like nature if it isn't there's an
[52:37] another
[52:38] nature there and there which isn't
[52:41] christ-like if if you have the nature of
[52:43] a killer if if i told you i have the
[52:46] spirit of john dillinger some famous
[52:48] outlaw you'd expect me to have guns and
[52:51] and you it'd be dangerous to be
[52:54] sitting around
[52:56] on here
[52:57] where i was at because i i'd be a
[53:00] murderer
[53:05] amen once you get uh you you get we all
[53:09] get like a
[53:12] a spear on us to us we we all have a
[53:15] spear on us that we here uh like we're
[53:19] gonna be like that either you have the
[53:21] holy ghost or you got some um
[53:24] different spirit
[53:26] and
[53:31] if i told you i had the spirit of some
[53:33] famous mechanic you'd expect me to know
[53:36] what was wrong with your car if i looked
[53:39] at it if i told you the spirit of christ
[53:42] was in me i i must act like jesus you
[53:44] must act like jesus your character and
[53:47] conduct must
[53:48] be molded like that and this holy spirit
[53:51] molds that conduct
[53:53] when he comes into you amen so so um
[53:59] if you have a spirit then if you have
[54:02] the holy spirit who all everything who
[54:06] he is will become manifest in in your
[54:08] life and and once you identify yourself
[54:12] in this word you look at this word and
[54:14] you see yourself in it you see see that
[54:17] that's who who you are you follow
[54:20] exactly what this bible says
[54:22] is that that's when when you'll get to
[54:24] um your full identity where you're
[54:28] in the perfect will of god
[54:49] okay here in um
[54:53] first john 2 27 it says but the
[54:55] anointing which you have received of him
[54:58] abideth in you and he need not that any
[55:00] man teach you but as the same anointing
[55:04] teacheth you of all things
[55:07] and is truth and is no lie and even as
[55:10] it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
[55:12] and now little children abide in him
[55:15] that when he shall appear we may have
[55:17] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[55:19] as coming if you know and know that he
[55:22] is righteous you know that everyone that
[55:25] doeth righteousness is born of him
[55:29] amen so um
[55:34] we we've got to
[55:36] identify yourself in in his word
[55:39] now um
[55:41] sometimes we'll think that um
[55:48] like we won't know what we're doing
[55:50] sometimes but
[55:53] if if we are um if we identify ourselves
[55:57] in that word well and
[56:01] we'll get we'll um get in the perfect
[56:05] but anyways uh
[56:07] sorry if i'm starting off a little bit
[56:09] slow i'm kind of getting used to this
[56:11] all over again
[56:24] god made a man to desire to have an
[56:27] example and god gave him an example that
[56:30] that example is jesus christ to be
[56:32] identified with him
[56:34] see we are given we we all every single
[56:37] human being
[56:39] it's in him to desire to be like
[56:41] something i'm going to be like this
[56:43] great great big somebody i want to be
[56:45] like like
[56:47] i i want to be like the hollywood actors
[56:50] or whatever this everyone has an idol or
[56:54] or something something that they want to
[56:56] be like something that they they can
[56:59] look at and they identify i i think
[57:02] think i'm i see myself in that
[57:06] now we've got to get to a place to where
[57:08] we see ourselves in that word and we
[57:11] identify ourselves with
[57:14] uh jesus christ and that that's how how
[57:17] it is with the
[57:19] that is how it is with with the believer
[57:22] er when uh when people see you when
[57:25] people see me do they see jesus christ
[57:28] in me
[57:29] do they see
[57:30] a in my through my works do they see
[57:33] jesus christ in my works
[57:35] when people look at me do they see
[57:38] who jesus christ is being manifested
[57:41] through the things that i do
[57:46] now if we would be more like him then
[57:48] there there wouldn't be so many big
[57:50] shots in the world there wouldn't be any
[57:52] a hungry people in the world there
[57:54] wouldn't be any whiskey or drinking or
[57:56] gambling god gave us an example to be
[57:59] like but we refuse to be it now
[58:02] now that's what's the matter with the
[58:04] world they they got the desire god has
[58:06] given them but they've turned it in the
[58:09] wrong way it's time to turn and return
[58:11] back and get on the right road and get
[58:14] facing calvary nature proves it
[58:18] amen
[58:20] amen it's
[58:23] that's how it is this day and
[58:26] with the
[58:29] people identifying themselves with sin
[58:32] they they have to look at something they
[58:34] have to look look to something to
[58:36] identify themselves in and and it's it's
[58:39] been perverted to where er people's pain
[58:42] in in their faces and people cells
[58:45] um trying to look like something that
[58:47] they're not
[58:49] now a
[58:50] sinner knows he's a sinner and and um
[58:55] well not always because people there's
[58:57] centers i've met sinners that say
[58:59] they're they're a christian that's the
[59:01] worst kind of center that that that's
[59:03] going about sinning
[59:05] and and
[59:07] and claiming
[59:09] uh christianity
[59:10] he's nothing but a liar and
[59:14] but but the people atheists know that
[59:16] they're atheists and they say well yeah
[59:18] i'm an atheist i believe this i believe
[59:20] that they know who they are
[59:22] now that but the denominations and all
[59:25] of them
[59:27] they don't know who they are
[59:28] and and
[59:30] until they they figure out who they are
[59:32] that that's the first thing
[59:35] that you have to
[59:37] realize so that change can happen
[59:41] amen because it's
[59:43] it's something that they don't see
[59:49] if so someone is out on the streets and
[59:52] they're uh
[59:54] poor or they're naked they're blind
[59:57] and if if they don't know it how are
[1:00:00] they say how is anything supposed to
[1:00:02] change nothing's going to change if they
[1:00:04] don't see it
[1:00:08] and and that that's the first thing and
[1:00:11] repentance is turning from sin what
[1:00:14] what's uh
[1:00:15] what repent what is repentance
[1:00:18] if you you don't know what you're doing
[1:00:20] wrong and you think you're all right
[1:00:24] that that's the first step of getting
[1:00:27] into the condition of repentance
[1:00:31] now if people of this day with that
[1:00:34] great desire and great ambition to be a
[1:00:37] like somebody an
[1:00:40] example if they took christ as their
[1:00:43] example that then we would would have we
[1:00:46] would have every
[1:00:48] we could fi fi
[1:00:50] fire
[1:00:51] every police there was in the nation
[1:00:54] everybody would be meek and humble
[1:00:56] everybody would be kind and have
[1:00:58] brotherly love
[1:01:00] one for the other
[1:01:02] there there would be never be a divorce
[1:01:04] case
[1:01:05] ever played in our country there would
[1:01:08] never be any sickness they would
[1:01:10] we could dismiss we could even dismiss
[1:01:12] hospitals
[1:01:14] if everybody tried to make jesus christ
[1:01:16] their example we would have a need for
[1:01:20] nothing else
[1:01:22] but
[1:01:24] but
[1:01:26] the way things are
[1:01:27] that they don't know people don't know
[1:01:30] who they are
[1:01:31] and and people don't recognize it the
[1:01:34] pharisees they
[1:01:36] they um thought that they were so holy
[1:01:39] and righteous and and yet yet they
[1:01:42] didn't see who they they actually are
[1:01:45] even though jesus christ condemned them
[1:01:47] for for what what they did
[1:01:51] but but they didn't see who they are and
[1:01:53] and that's the first step
[1:01:54] to change who they are their their
[1:01:57] identity is still
[1:02:01] it's it's not not in
[1:02:03] where they should be
[1:02:12] so so that nature is in the man and he
[1:02:15] puts it
[1:02:17] on the wrong thing he he makes
[1:02:20] some man and you you know the bible said
[1:02:23] that we are cursed when when we make
[1:02:26] flesh our state
[1:02:27] when you try to make flesh your stay or
[1:02:30] put your trust in flesh the bible said
[1:02:33] you are cursed
[1:02:34] how
[1:02:35] well i know it's so easy to do it here's
[1:02:39] here's what causes a lot of it it is our
[1:02:42] newsstands for full of vulgar magazines
[1:02:45] our homes are full of
[1:02:47] pin up pictures
[1:02:49] our new
[1:02:51] screens are never censored they're wide
[1:02:53] open can crack any kind of jokes or or
[1:02:56] do things that that's terrible there's
[1:02:58] no um there's no cleanness among us
[1:03:01] anymore i i know you think i'm awful
[1:03:04] hard on that but it's
[1:03:06] so somebody has got got to be hard on it
[1:03:10] it's just got to be done
[1:03:13] and then all the these these things that
[1:03:16] they're putting out that through the
[1:03:18] media that um
[1:03:20] like we were talking about like the uh
[1:03:22] school system it's so so corrupt and and
[1:03:26] yet the younger generation is the next
[1:03:28] generation they're teaching
[1:03:31] uh
[1:03:32] kids
[1:03:33] is uh
[1:03:34] that they can choose what gender that
[1:03:37] they're gonna be
[1:03:39] what whatever they're
[1:03:41] they're training up a bunch of kids to
[1:03:43] be
[1:03:45] a a people that doesn't know who they
[1:03:47] are
[1:03:50] a bunch of children who
[1:03:52] who don't know who they are they grow up
[1:03:54] to be men women that don't don't even
[1:03:57] know know what gender they are it's it's
[1:03:59] gotten that bad now that the school
[1:04:02] system is teaching it and and that's why
[1:04:06] it's it's good to get to keep your
[1:04:08] children out of those those
[1:04:11] schools and and homeschool your children
[1:04:15] and
[1:04:16] it's it's gotten it's just gotten that
[1:04:18] bad just keep them out of it that and
[1:04:20] they're gonna grow up to
[1:04:22] to
[1:04:23] um
[1:04:24] unless unless they got the holy ghost
[1:04:28] they'll never
[1:04:29] know who they are
[1:04:39] when i was a little boy i read the the
[1:04:41] book of tarzan the apes
[1:04:44] mama had an old fur rug that
[1:04:48] mrs uh
[1:04:49] then had
[1:04:51] give her laid before the dresser i cut
[1:04:53] that thing up and made me a tarzan soup
[1:04:55] his suit and
[1:04:57] slept in a tree for a week i wanted to
[1:04:59] be tarzan but when i read the the book
[1:05:02] of lone star ranger i rode a broomstick
[1:05:06] out
[1:05:07] being a hobby horse trying to be the
[1:05:09] lone star ranger
[1:05:12] it's no no more than and what people
[1:05:14] will do it's it's what you read the
[1:05:17] music you listen to go into a restaurant
[1:05:19] in and this old
[1:05:21] rock and roll no wonder people are going
[1:05:23] crazy that's enough for
[1:05:26] to drive a human being crazy
[1:05:29] and then there's there's um
[1:05:32] so so many different things that they're
[1:05:34] trying to influence people to to
[1:05:38] be someone that they're not
[1:05:50] i i identify yourself with some movie
[1:05:53] queen and see where you'll be identify
[1:05:56] yourself with some cowboy or some
[1:05:58] teenager you'll see where you'll be
[1:06:01] but i challenge you to not
[1:06:03] not identify yourself with jesus christ
[1:06:06] in his death and his resurrection and
[1:06:08] you'll see
[1:06:10] where where you'll be at the
[1:06:11] resurrection for if we suffer with him
[1:06:13] we shall reign with him and god has
[1:06:16] given us
[1:06:18] the promise
[1:06:19] my whole desires to be like him
[1:06:24] amen if we get into that condition
[1:06:27] if we get into that condition
[1:06:29] and and to where
[1:06:31] all we we want to be on all that i want
[1:06:33] to be is is like him we we identify
[1:06:36] ourselves with with jesus christ that is
[1:06:39] who i i want to be that is the person
[1:06:42] and i want one to be like instead
[1:06:45] instead of looking at these other things
[1:06:47] these different and uh things out in the
[1:06:49] world that the world wants to be like
[1:06:51] the world says you should be like this
[1:06:53] you should do this you should
[1:06:55] you should
[1:06:57] do what we want you to do
[1:06:59] but we will not comply because as jesus
[1:07:02] christ has uh has came he has shown us
[1:07:07] how he wants us to be
[1:07:11] he has shown us the example he he wants
[1:07:14] us to identify ourselves with him and
[1:07:17] and
[1:07:18] when when he comes back he want one
[1:07:21] doesn't want us he doesn't want to see a
[1:07:22] bunch of people that went off to look at
[1:07:25] their
[1:07:27] to be something else identify
[1:07:29] themselves with something else he wants
[1:07:31] to come back and see
[1:07:32] himself a people that has decided to be
[1:07:35] just like him
[1:07:37] a people that is perfect
[1:07:40] now um perfect according to this word
[1:07:43] for it that follows this word exactly
[1:07:46] and and stays right with this word and
[1:07:48] nothing has not drifted from that like
[1:07:51] like
[1:07:52] humans to tend to do because it's our
[1:07:54] inner our nature but but
[1:07:57] once we become born again
[1:08:00] it's again it's uh
[1:08:02] against our nature or to do those other
[1:08:04] things
[1:08:06] we we start out as someone that then
[1:08:12] that isn't
[1:08:14] until where where um
[1:08:16] we're we're supposed to be
[1:08:18] until we become born again we and once
[1:08:22] you become born again you're identified
[1:08:24] yeah you your identity is changed that's
[1:08:27] why it's called being born again you're
[1:08:29] not no longer the person that you used
[1:08:31] to be
[1:08:32] and now you identify yourself as a
[1:08:36] christian you identify yourself as a son
[1:08:39] of god
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:53] take me lord and mold me and make me
[1:08:56] shape me over again like the prophet
[1:08:58] that went down to the potter's house
[1:09:00] break me up and remold me
[1:09:03] that that's how i
[1:09:05] to
[1:09:06] be i want to be remolded by
[1:09:09] jesus christ i want to to be
[1:09:12] exactly like him i want to be
[1:09:14] christ-like i don't want him to come
[1:09:16] back and see
[1:09:18] me
[1:09:19] out here trying to look like snakes
[1:09:20] someone else i want one to to look like
[1:09:24] him and and that's how how we'll get
[1:09:27] into the condition to go in the rapture
[1:09:30] when and
[1:09:31] and jesus look god cannot
[1:09:37] god let's say um
[1:09:40] just like uh
[1:09:44] abraham abraham's uh wife
[1:09:49] when she laughed at what what uh
[1:09:52] at the word of the lord she laughed at
[1:09:54] it but god could not touch her because
[1:09:57] she was a part of abraham so so god
[1:10:00] cannot destroy us because we're a part
[1:10:03] of the lord jesus christ when he comes
[1:10:05] back he'll
[1:10:07] he'll see
[1:10:09] us in that condition to where we're
[1:10:11] a part of the lord jesus christ because
[1:10:14] that bride is gonna be
[1:10:16] a uh
[1:10:17] like
[1:10:18] like jesus christ we're
[1:10:20] they're going to be like him when he
[1:10:22] comes back if
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:47] that's exactly where where the church
[1:10:49] stands today
[1:10:51] sold her word given character to satan
[1:10:53] for scientific man-made religion
[1:10:56] when she had the right as a church of
[1:10:58] god to stay with the word of god
[1:11:02] and have the holy spirit working among
[1:11:04] uh
[1:11:06] welding the body together with the word
[1:11:09] and love of god instead of that she sold
[1:11:12] out her birthrights like esau and took a
[1:11:15] denomination let her do it
[1:11:18] let her do it anything she wanted to do
[1:11:21] right just to be pop
[1:11:22] popular just to
[1:11:25] like her mother did in i see a rome
[1:11:29] god's word oh
[1:11:31] oh how it's entered into a pentecostal
[1:11:34] realm it's too bad but it didn't but it
[1:11:37] did
[1:11:38] it
[1:11:40] notice just a minute a nun in the
[1:11:42] catholic church that that woman to to
[1:11:44] become a nun
[1:11:46] and takes that last veil she she's
[1:11:49] absolutely sold out to that church she
[1:11:52] is
[1:11:53] so body and spirit
[1:11:55] property of that church she has an and
[1:11:58] no mind of her own and she can't
[1:12:00] have
[1:12:02] when she takes that last veil no ma
[1:12:04] no mind of her own no will of her own
[1:12:08] see out out here that satan
[1:12:11] makes them his
[1:12:15] his bogus and like the truth
[1:12:18] that the true church of christ the bride
[1:12:21] is sold out to him and his promised word
[1:12:24] till the very mind that's in christ is
[1:12:27] in you what a difference
[1:12:30] amen that's how it's got to be until
[1:12:33] you've got that that mind of christ
[1:12:37] christ the mind of christ is in you
[1:12:40] amen and that's how how we got to get
[1:12:42] like
[1:12:44] we gotta get get the mind that's in
[1:12:46] jesus christ
[1:12:47] in it that you think exactly like he
[1:12:50] wants you to think you
[1:12:52] live exactly the way that he wants you
[1:12:54] to live
[1:12:56] and
[1:12:57] and to follow all this uh word exactly
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:03] and to
[1:13:04] where we identify ourselves in that word
[1:13:09] and we we find today that the the modern
[1:13:11] church and modern world church the the
[1:13:13] modern world church and also that
[1:13:16] spiritual church are both impregnated to
[1:13:19] give birth to sons
[1:13:21] one of them a denominational birth
[1:13:24] to is going to give one of
[1:13:27] uh
[1:13:28] day two
[1:13:29] to these days at the world council of
[1:13:31] churches which will produce to that
[1:13:34] world the antichrist through a
[1:13:36] denomination that's exactly the truth i
[1:13:38] may not live to see it i believe i will
[1:13:40] but
[1:13:41] you young young people remember that
[1:13:44] you
[1:13:45] a minister say that that that that'll
[1:13:48] finally wind up
[1:13:51] and that is the mark of the beast when
[1:13:53] she forms that world council of churches
[1:13:55] and she'll give birth to her son the
[1:13:57] antichrist
[1:14:00] the other is impregnated by the word of
[1:14:02] god and will bring forth the body the
[1:14:04] finished body of jesus christ which is
[1:14:06] the bride the body of christ isn't
[1:14:09] finished yet how many knows that a
[1:14:12] woman and is one the christ is one body
[1:14:16] the word that the bride will have to be
[1:14:19] the rest of that body and the two
[1:14:21] together makes the one body again like
[1:14:23] adam was at the beginning
[1:14:26] man
[1:14:27] his wife are are one now now she the
[1:14:30] true bride so sold out to him that she
[1:14:34] used no mind of her own his mind of
[1:14:37] course and it is his will and his will
[1:14:40] is his word
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:45] that that's how the bride's got to be
[1:14:47] identified and with jesus christ
[1:14:52] her mind is his mind and
[1:14:58] and she follows his word exactly
[1:15:01] amen
[1:15:09] now look at the so-called bride chosen
[1:15:12] by man and compare the spiritual to the
[1:15:14] natural of today a modern
[1:15:17] isabel bewitched by her ahab max factor
[1:15:21] beauties everything look at the church
[1:15:23] the the same way but a prostitute to the
[1:15:26] the word of the living god big
[1:15:27] denominations big buildings big money
[1:15:29] big salary all sold out
[1:15:32] men standing in the pulpit endorsing
[1:15:33] that that that's all all right and and
[1:15:37] let let them get by eye with it just to
[1:15:40] see that's all truly a blindly ought to
[1:15:42] see a church just exactly what the bible
[1:15:44] said would be said i am rich i said as a
[1:15:48] queen i in need of nothing and know us
[1:15:51] down not that thou are on that that
[1:15:55] are our
[1:15:56] poor miserable blind wretched naked and
[1:15:59] and don't know it if that that isn't
[1:16:02] thus said at the lord revelation 3
[1:16:05] i've never read it that that's what she
[1:16:07] is and don't know it think of it
[1:16:11] if you tell a man or a woman on the
[1:16:13] street that that would start
[1:16:15] naked and tell them they were naked
[1:16:18] they'd
[1:16:19] say turn to your own business what why
[1:16:21] there's a mental deficiency there
[1:16:23] somewhere there is something that went
[1:16:25] wrong with their mind
[1:16:28] amen men when people get to that
[1:16:30] condition it's such a bad condition and
[1:16:34] and they'll say say that that they
[1:16:36] have need of nothing that they don't
[1:16:38] need anything they they're they're fine
[1:16:41] they
[1:16:42] look at them
[1:16:43] and they are
[1:16:45] in that condition but will not see it
[1:16:47] and therefore change will never happen
[1:16:50] and
[1:16:51] because of that
[1:16:52] amen and
[1:16:54] and so so
[1:16:56] and another thing uh that that word
[1:16:59] those words i have need of nothing that
[1:17:02] could mean like like i'm
[1:17:04] i'm okay i don't need anything you know
[1:17:06] i got all that i have need of
[1:17:09] i i lack nothing but but yet and uh even
[1:17:14] when with with the gospel even
[1:17:16] most people only go so far they're to
[1:17:19] where that um they're
[1:17:22] just
[1:17:22] saved and then that that's it they don't
[1:17:24] get filled with the holy ghost or
[1:17:26] anything else they just go to the first
[1:17:27] part they
[1:17:28] they love that part that says says um
[1:17:32] john 3 3 16 they love that part he who
[1:17:34] believes on the lord jesus christ i'll
[1:17:36] be
[1:17:38] saved and
[1:17:40] they love that part because
[1:17:44] um they they want to say that that well
[1:17:46] you just believe on him well i believe
[1:17:48] in jesus christ and
[1:17:50] and then they do nothing with that they
[1:17:51] just say well i believe that's it now
[1:17:53] i'm saying now i'm going to go to heaven
[1:17:55] they don't want to actually change or
[1:17:59] they don't want to change their life
[1:18:00] to to follow him they don't want to pick
[1:18:03] up the cross and follow him and it's
[1:18:04] just it just stops there and that's it
[1:18:08] there's a lot of people that like that
[1:18:10] this day
[1:18:12] as a matter of fact
[1:18:13] probably
[1:18:14] most christians are well so-called
[1:18:17] christians are like that
[1:18:19] they say well i'm a christian i identify
[1:18:21] as a christian
[1:18:24] well
[1:18:25] uh
[1:18:26] i could say i identify as a dog i'm not
[1:18:28] a dog but but it's it's in you it's what
[1:18:31] you do that shows that you are
[1:18:33] and and if they go around and do
[1:18:36] whatever they they want and go out in
[1:18:38] the in the world and and sin and drink
[1:18:42] and do all these things
[1:18:44] then
[1:18:44] they're
[1:18:45] they're not really a true christian
[1:18:51] and
[1:18:52] when you can read the word of god how
[1:18:55] how that people should do and this
[1:18:57] baptism the holy ghost that we have
[1:19:00] today and people
[1:19:02] what why they are
[1:19:04] why they look at you as if you were
[1:19:06] crazy you tell them you've got they
[1:19:09] they've got to be born again
[1:19:11] they got to believe the bible
[1:19:15] but yet people still still won't believe
[1:19:17] it they say well i believe my own
[1:19:20] certain way and i can and live my life
[1:19:23] with it in every way i want to live it
[1:19:33] first peter 1 2018 2
[1:19:37] says see seeing ye have purified your
[1:19:41] souls in in obeying the truth through
[1:19:45] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[1:19:48] brethren see that you love one another
[1:19:50] with the pure heart fervently being born
[1:19:52] again not of corruptible sepa
[1:19:54] incorruptable by the word of god which
[1:19:56] liveth and abideth forever
[1:19:59] amen when
[1:20:00] we've got to be born um and born again
[1:20:03] and not of corruptible seed but of
[1:20:06] incorruptible by the word of god just
[1:20:08] like this it
[1:20:11] is like
[1:20:13] i have the this
[1:20:16] fear that i might um
[1:20:20] i always had this fear before i started
[1:20:21] preaching and stuff
[1:20:23] that
[1:20:24] um
[1:20:25] that i might mess up i might say
[1:20:27] something that i i shouldn't say i might
[1:20:30] um
[1:20:32] um because i'm going to be judged for
[1:20:34] everything i say but that's the thing
[1:20:36] god god puts that fear in in us that
[1:20:41] so that
[1:20:42] we won't say anything that we shouldn't
[1:20:44] say and
[1:20:46] and
[1:20:47] but that that's the thing god doesn't
[1:20:48] make any mistakes when he calls people
[1:20:51] he he he chooses
[1:20:54] his people for the right reasons even if
[1:20:57] they don't start out written very well
[1:20:59] or they don't
[1:21:02] god knows what he's doing when he
[1:21:04] chooses his people
[1:21:07] and and i believe god hasn't made a
[1:21:09] mistake
[1:21:35] he's the same jesus yesterday today and
[1:21:38] forever the same type of character a man
[1:21:40] that professes to be a christian must
[1:21:42] have a christ like nature if it isn't
[1:21:44] there there's another nature there that
[1:21:47] which isn't christ-like
[1:21:51] amen and
[1:21:53] um
[1:22:12] excuse me sorry
[1:22:16] reading the same things over and over
[1:22:17] again
[1:22:25] the bride is like into to pure gold her
[1:22:27] righteousness is his righteousness her
[1:22:30] attributes are his own glorious
[1:22:33] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:22:36] what what he is she is to reflect but
[1:22:38] but he
[1:22:40] what he has she is to manifest there is
[1:22:42] no fault in her that
[1:22:44] she is all
[1:22:45] glorious within and without from
[1:22:48] beginning and ending she is the work of
[1:22:50] her lord and all his works are perfect
[1:22:53] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:22:55] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:22:57] purpose of god how can one fathom it how
[1:23:01] can one understand it though though we
[1:23:03] cannot do that we accept it by faith for
[1:23:06] god has spoken it but not only is the
[1:23:10] candlestick of gold it is beaten gold
[1:23:13] handcrafted of beaten gold according to
[1:23:16] her blueprints which were spirit given
[1:23:19] outside of her lord and master jesus
[1:23:22] christ whichever
[1:23:25] people so beaten and purged as the bride
[1:23:28] of jesus christ surely she has filled up
[1:23:31] the sufferings that christ has left her
[1:23:34] and left behind her her goods are
[1:23:37] de
[1:23:37] spoiled her life is in jeopardy she is
[1:23:40] accounted as sheep for the slaughter she
[1:23:42] is killed all the day long she suffers
[1:23:45] much but
[1:23:46] in it all retaliates not neither does
[1:23:50] she cause others to suffer worthy of the
[1:23:53] gospel is this lovely bride of christ
[1:23:56] and and as god is malleable
[1:24:00] where is brass will break with the
[1:24:02] beating
[1:24:03] this gold of god will bear her suffering
[1:24:06] for the lord not bowed not broken not
[1:24:10] destroyed but formed as a thing of
[1:24:13] beauty and and a joy forever by the
[1:24:15] trials and testings of this life
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:25] as the musicians come
[1:24:36] first first john 5 5 4
[1:24:39] and verse 4 to 5 says
[1:24:42] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[1:24:45] the world and this is the victory that
[1:24:46] overcometh the world even our faith who
[1:24:48] is he that overcome with the world but
[1:24:51] he that believeth that jesus is the son
[1:24:53] of god
[1:24:55] amen whoever is is born of
[1:24:58] the world will
[1:25:00] get away from from the things of this

[1:26:07] children abide in him that what what
[1:26:09] when he shall appear we may have
[1:26:12] confidence not be ashamed for him at his
