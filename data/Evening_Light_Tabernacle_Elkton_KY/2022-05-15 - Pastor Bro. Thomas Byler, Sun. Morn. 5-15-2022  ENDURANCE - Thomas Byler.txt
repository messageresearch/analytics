to be in the house the lord stand with me if you will um we'll just ask brother austin to open us up and pray children can be dismissed to sunday high school turn with me if you will to isaiah d4 seeing o bear thou that does not bear break forth into singing and cry loud thou that it's not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited foreign husband the lord of hosts is his name and i redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall be shall he be called for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be roth with the nor rebuke thee oh though afflicted tossed and tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colors and lay thy foundations with sapphires and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake this last one together no weapon has formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith lord you can be seated morning brothers and sisters you know you could you could take those what how many verses were there those 17 verses and you could go from one end from genesis 1 1 all the way to revelations and you could historically bring out all the things that the jewish people went through in their struggle but the one thing that this chapter in isaiah says no matter what it was god didn't forsake him it might have looked the circumstance might have looked bad for him on the outside but god gave him a promise that he would take care of him and nourish him that's a comforting thought um i wasn't here last sunday but when i got to offering the uh the amount for um that was donated last sunday the offering sunday was twelve thousand six hundred and seventy one dollars and i hadn't made that deposit yet but i'll make it tomorrow or tuesday so that's as of this morning um and i was just gonna go over a few things um the uh principle i'm saying this the principal amount left on the church is uh 72 372.49 that's as of as of the last time i made a payment i know like i've told you before we're going into december so i don't i don't really add a lot to the principal map through the sum where i i kind of stay close to what the payment is but going at this rate i i told you on january or in december we'd be at 68 000 by one january of 2023 at the lower terrace we're going to be well below 68 000 as long as everything stays the same uh in the general fund right now uh is was 10 638 and so that's what's in the general fund right now and uh and we have had no problem making the uh the building payment every month so that's been lord's bless us there i had him i told him to come top off the propane for the for the summer but i don't know i don't know if they've done it or not before i i was a little concerned about i was trying to get them to do it before the fuel prices weren't keep going up but i don't know if they've done it or not if they haven't i might wait and tell them to hold and waiting to see what goes on with the fuel prices if they don't get any better it's going to be worse next year than it was this year so that's where we're at right there and like i've always told you before if you have any questions you know don't be afraid to ask me and i appreciate all your prayers i i guess last time i wasn't able to make it my blood pressure was all over the place and if you don't know anything about me i'm one of them guys i've never had that's something i've never had a problem i've always had low blood pressure low pulse rate never had a problem with it so i appreciate your prayers you know you know i'm finding out i'm going to be 63 here soon and maybe a little testimony and you all know me i'm just one of those guys i don't hold anything back if i'm going to do something i do it with everything that i have within me but as you get older you realize you're in a fight your body's saying you're not going to do that anymore and your mind and your spirit's telling your body well we are going to keep doing that you have to i'm not going to surrender to that you all know me pretty well but your body's trying to tell you one thing and your mind's trying to tell you something else and sometimes the two don't always agree and you wind up fighting each other and and sometimes the body wins and sometimes the mind wins that's just the way life is but if you return with me to uh and uh some of you are nurses you probably you probably know my arthritis is not getting any better it never gets better it only gets worse do i do i dwell on it no i don't dwell on it you know i just you just have to live with it and i would tell all you young men uh you they you know when you're young you don't think you're ever gonna get hurt but you know i'm 63 i'd say that a second time but i've probably broken every major bone in my body through my life and you know sometimes you you have an accident or you do something stupid you know you're laying there on the ground or laying in a belt wherever it is you wait you say to yourself thank you lord i'm not dead but then you might then you say to yourself you know might not have been the smartest thing to do i maybe could have done it better before i did it wrong you know so you're not as individ you know you're not as indestructible as you think you are so you get to a point you know you break enough bones in your life you do enough stupid stuff the older you get you're going to find out that you pay for it so i don't know if that helps anyone out but it sooner or later it'll come to fruition but if you return with me to the sixth chapter of of the gospel of john you know i was thinking this morning i was listening to a couple of messages this morning in my office brother branham was talking but i just wrote before i get into john i wrote what he had to say and i was just thinking that's the problem what he was saying is the problem with the world this morning is that people are not who they really are when you get out there in the world what you see is not real people they put on a face they put on a show but behind that show they are not letting you know or you're not seeing who they really are it's all it's a it's a game it's all fabrication what you see out there and he was saying he would rather have people be who they really are than to play either whether it's play christians or play this or play that and i was thinking he was talking in you know i think this one was in 1959 1960 and we're in it and we're in a time right now where there everything's reversed right now what the norms were in 1960 and what the norms are in 2022 are totally reversed each other now and it's just a crazy place out there and i always say this i can't say it enough your only hope is in jesus christ and in the word of god anything outside of that you know it's not going to stand on that day the only thing that's going to stand on that day is your character and the word of god that's it that's all you're going to bring there on that day and uh in that relationship you know that's really important you know a lot of times you play around you play with it you don't really take it serious and then you realize that you're coming up short and that's a horrible thing you don't play with it just reach out in faith and grab it and let it change your life and change who you are that's what that's what the world needs this morning that's what we all need but i probably lost my place here i'm drifting but if uh if you would start at about the 34th verse of john the sixth chapter of john and jesus was saying here we all know what this is about you know this is when when a lot of his disciples didn't choose to walk with them anymore and a lot of us you face that in your own lives when you start talking to people about who you are what you believe the message of the hour a lot of those friends you had you don't have anymore you know it's just there's always a choosing time everyone has to choose i'll just read this then jesus said on the verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not the bread from heaven my father gave you the true bread from heaven for the bread that god excuse me for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven that giveth life on to the world and that's where we're at this morning the true bread of life is either we're going to possess you or it's not he goes then he said unto them lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but i say unto you that ye have not seen me excuse me but i say unto you that you also have seen me and believe not and i mean that's just a lot of people are that way you know they follow the miracles and they follow the signs but they still don't believe and all the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me well i and no one is cast out for i come down from heaven not to do my own will but to do the will of him that sent me and this is the father's will which sent me that of all that which it he hath given me i shall lose nothing but should raise up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up in the last day and that's where we're at this morning you know it's not really complicated you know this morning you know you can make him complicated but it's really not complicated your relationship with jesus christ is not complicated you might choose to make it complicated but it really isn't complicated it's just simply believing the word of god and walking in it this morning and we all have to make a choice this morning you know as you see the world i was on my tablet this morning on going you know christian updates on what's going on in ukraine and and i sometimes i have to go to non-uh european or non-uh american news sources to really see what's going on because like i said live the week before or last the news is only letting you see one side and i'm not taken aside here but they're only letting you see one side and that's the point we're getting to in this world there'll come a time where they'll only allow you to have one opinion just like the bible said but you all and us we only want the right opinion and that's what god is showing us in the word of god for the hour that we're living this morning brother david amen let's stand this morning if we could he loved him with all your heart let's sing that song this morning sister becky i love you lord and i left my voice if we could amen so appreciate him this morning and man god bless you it's just good to be in the house of the lord

[Music] thank you lord jesus thank you lord hallelujah amen you love him this morning good morning good to be in the house of the lord amen on this late spring amen day looks like it's going to be a beautiful day thank you musicians appreciate amen your songs this morning and also praise the lord for the missionary offering god bless you with certainly more than what i expected and i hope and trust that it will really be a blessing and a benefit to those christians that are stuck once still in ukraine amen wherever they are in their basements and different places we know that it's not a safe place to be right now but we just pray that somehow that each and every penny will find its way and be able to help those believers amen amen so god bless you richly for that this morning amen certainly are glad you know i think that's one of the best things we do amen is missionary work amen that's the best thing you can do is missionary work amen the best way to invest your money so praise the lord god bless you amen and we will i'll uh we'll be in touch and probably keep you up posted and updated perhaps on some of the things and you may mean amen and brother brother barry whenever he gets another update amen we'll try to keep you all updated also amen and so that's just very very sad over there and it's just really really sad amen and so of course we know that all war is sad amen and it'll be that way until the end amen as long as man is in control and not the holy spirit there's going to be wars amen amen well god bless you this morning i just uh i feel a little different this morning and so um kind of amen not so much the joy of the lord perhaps as it is the burden of the lord amen and so i trust this morning's service will be a benefit for you amen and i know wednesday we spoke on god's judgment amen amen in this you know i believe the prophet said we need more of those uh fire and brimstone type of messages amen because that's the other side of salvation isn't it it's the other side it's the other side of people people who have rejected mercy rejected the grace of almighty god then they have to stand the judgment and the wrath of god amen if they do not want their sins erased nor forgiven then they have to pay for their sin and i'm he knows each and every one amen and so amen it's kind of sad amen and so uh this morning we will amen speak with the help of the lord on endurance and patience amen if you will turn your bibles i want to read the scripture i actually have quite a few scriptures but i think we'll start out with peter amen let's start out in the book of peter if you will turn to second peter 3 amen and so we will have prayer amen i know we haven't had it yet this time right so i mean we do want to pray i mean last wednesday i prayed talked just a little bit forgot we had prayed but anyway so let's not forget to pray is that right you love the lord let's bow our heads lord jesus we come before you father we want to thank you lord for our beautiful day god that you have given us to come together to worship in spirit and in truth lord to freedom to be able to do so lord and we ask god this morning as we search our hearts lord and see where we are with you father we ask god that your great holy spirit would just come down lord and discern the thoughts the intents of the heart lord jesus not just those present but those that are listening this morning father we ask god that you would lord jesus see if there's any wicked way in us lord jesus and if there is lord take it out father for we have one motive one not objective lord and that is to meet you in disguise lord and father we ask lord now with that which i feel lord you've laid upon my heart to minister lord that you'd help me just to get out of the way and you speak lord the words that you once said lord bring your anointed anointing lord to anoint the word lord jesus and set it into hearts lord so that it would bring forth one hundredfold in each one lord we ask for those that are sick this morning god that you would give him a complete recovery lord jesus and a speedy recovery we believe it with all of our heart in jesus christ's name amen and an amen competitor 3 verse 4 down to verse 13. and amen i think we finished off pretty much with reading this wednesday but we want to take this and then go on with it in a little bit different direction second peter 3 and verse 4 says and saying well verse 3 i mean knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers and walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and the lord is not con not slack concerning his promise as men some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance remember the day of the lord will come as the thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise the elements shall melt with fervent heat and earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought need to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens of heavens being on fire shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth were indwelled with righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that he looked for such things be diligent that he may be found of him in peace and without spot and blameless now let's go to our main scripture in hebrews 12. hebrews 12 and i'll back up after i read this one and pick out a few thoughts that i wanted to share with you amen on ii peter the third chapter hebrews 12 137 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a crowd of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith now i want you to notice two words i want you to notice the word endure endurance and also patience okay so at the end of verse 1 let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself least ye be wearied and faint in your minds for ye have not ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and have you forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise thou not the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth us and scorches every son whom we receive it and if you endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if he be without chastisement wherefore all our partakers and are you bastards not sons may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen i want to start out by just um looking at verse three of chapter three of second peter for a minute it says you know that knowing this that the they'll come in the last days coffers and walking after us amen and so that of course describes that everybody is going to kind of pretty much do whatever they desire to do isn't that right amen after their own lust because in their minds amen in their minds they don't really think that he's coming right they don't really think that it is coming you know and [Music] i've you know and i just want to say that i feel like in my heart there's something about a believer something about a christian and we want to speak on this morning we want to talk about a long-range vision all right faith being a long-range vision looking way ahead looking at what's coming right they don't think it's going to come so they live however they want to amen but let me ask you this do you think tomorrow will come a better question yet did today come it came didn't it and just as sure as yesterday we would have said you know i wonder if tomorrow is coming now it's here amen i mean that's how sure that it is that jesus christ is going to return amen the time will come when time will be no more how many know we're running out of time we're running out of time just as sure as we're standing here one day we'll not be here just as sure as we're here this morning there'll be a judgment day that comes is that right and i'll tell you what you really have to keep your eyes towards the end amen [Applause] amen and so they say they think that he's not going to come but peter's saying here he says you know the old world it overflowed with water it was destroyed and peter begins to say and just as sure as the old world was destroyed that's how sure that this present world is reserved it has a reservation by the word of god this is sure as god's word is true amen this world is reserved for fire even the heavens are going to be on fire the earth is going to be on fire amen and so this morning we want to talk a little bit with the help of the lord about endurance imminent who and of course endurance and patience runs hand in hand amen and you know as we get older i mean as we get older you have and i have this morning a real longing a real desire for something that endures right something that endures and what we love so much about god is that he don't never change we know that here we have no continuing city right we have nothing there is nothing here that continues everything changes continuously changes you would think that if we had a when you have a good thing you want to just try to keep it that way don't you but it doesn't stay that way amen just like being young well well it ain't too many turns of the sun and things change amen i like what brother brian said about you know your mind says no i can do this yet i can do it but the body says no you can't i know what he's talking about amen and if you you can you can really push it but you pay for it and after a while the penalty becomes worse it's just uh you don't want to pay the penalty for it amen but it just doesn't stay the same nothing stays the same except the word of god i mean god's word endureth forever it never changes even jesus said heaven and earth they're gonna pass away but my word it'll never pass away god's word is the only thing that endures and a christian has a desire for something that endures amen praise the lord abraham how many knows abraham desired a city that was built by god they desired a better country am i right [Applause] he so journeyed in a strange land looking for a city who's builder and maker with god let me tell you something this world is becoming more strange all the time this is a weird place folks this is a strange place amen and it's become more strange to the christian nothing's normal anymore is it you go to walmart go anywhere and you see a woman with a skirt and so forth dressed like a human being was like wow look at there you almost want to say praise the lord got to be a christian wear a skirt right right and so to everybody else look at what they're you know one thing they don't they don't say the same the evil people they don't say the same and you realize folks that those everybody out there they're people just like you are but it's a spirit that possesses something amen praise the lord endurance we're looking for things that endure if you all remember brother brahm's life story how he talked about his dad did he was so tough how strong he was his shirt would get sunburned to the back and they'd have to peel it off and how he could take 900 pound logs and load 900 pound logs and so forth he says my daddy will never die died at 52. seeing a big old oak tree there in the front yard man that thing will last forever it wasn't no time hello and that thing was nothing but a spring huh no continuing city and when i think about it even the probably god look how long he's been gone let me tell you something he is very glad for the stand that he took while he was here because here we have no contain life is short here amen but the christian desire something that endures endures forever even jesus said labor not from the meat that perishes but labor for the meat that endureth amen that's what we're eating this morning the meat that endureth i'm not reading something out of a man-made cookbook or how to stay young this is the word of god it's the only thing that endures forever and he believes that if you are going to endure forever you're going to have to be part of this right here amen how many believes that oh my and then before i go a little further it says there that he says you know don't be ignorant with the lord one day is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day and the lord's not not slack concerning his pop a promise but notice the other word that i like to bring into this is that one of the fruits of the spirit is long suffering right i mean i was a christian has to suffer along he has to be patient he has to endure amen it's part of the christian's makeup it's part of who we are because we're living in a world brothers and sisters where people haven't got what it takes don't have that endurance on the inside of them huh remember jesus went talking when he was talking about the sword that went forth the soul and so forth in all the different places that the seed fell amen and he said in verse 20 of chapter 13 of matthew he says but he that receiveth the seed into the stony places the stoning place is the same as he which heareth the word and anoi with joy receiveth it yet he has not rooted himself to earth for a while amen i don't know about you but i don't want to just endure or do it for a while amen don't you like people who stick it out people who go the distance amen one place the bible says that he that endureth unto the end he shall be saved amen i believe how many believes it takes gonna take endurance we're living in a world folks where we're going to have to endure this layout of ch we're living in ireland i felt like this was perhaps something the lord was wanting to tell us and that is that we're going to have to be a little more patient we're going to have to endure all the way to the end and that's truly what we're doing now the reason that part of the reason i read that about the long suffering of christ and amen and the days of noah there was you know there's a long suffering period not that right and even today god is long-suffering it says god is long-suffering not willing that any should perish amen god is waiting long even the probably god thought that you know the millennium would have been here by 1977. well i'm glad it wasn't where would you be some of us weren't born in 77 probably huh let alone born again but god is long suffering he's long suffering and how many know that the bible says there in first corinthians 13 he says you know charity suffereth long and is kind amen and charity also endures all things i mean there's endurance with love that's what god is god is love and he has got long suffering he's got endured waiting for people to come to christ he's not willing that any should perish amen and you and i are running a race every human being has had to run that race we've all had to endure keep on going keep it on keep an eye on how many knows you take something in there to help you to keep on going on through all the trials and through everything that comes along amen and we desire i hope you are desiring because i'm getting less at home here than ever amen i'm longing for i'm aren't you longing for something that's eternal amen that's exactly right now notice another scripture if you will that paul was talking in hebrews the 10th chapter he said verse 34 for you had compassion on me and the things that he needed so far [Music] in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance cast now that way therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward for ye of need of patience amen notice how he talks about he talks about endurance talks about patience how many believe we have need of patience people are not a patient anymore and no doubt a lot of us that have had some experience of how that the supply chain is supposedly slowed down now amen and some things you can't get near as quick as what you could and boy i'll tell you what isn't that just almost upsetting why because we got no patience we don't know what patience is anything you want you can go get almost at any given time amen amen we have to be patient that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while paul having the same mentality yet a little while and he that shall come will come he's going to be here one of these days amen and will not tarry for now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back and that's what's happening amen people are falling away [Applause] people are backsliding and isn't that what the prophet seen at the very end when he seen a picture of the preview of the bride now right brother brad you seen the hand there the last the few of those ladies at the very end begin to veer off and that right to get back in line get back in line amen keep steady keep steady why because we're living in an age where men people are just drunk with pledges of the world drunk with riches drunk with money drunk with it amen all kinds of things for distractions to keep you distracted to get you distracted get you off the path amen oh my he says and if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them that draw back unto perdition but of them that believe unto the saving of the soul just like jesus that we're not part of those who endure for a little while and amen that go by the wayside when trials and tribulation comes off the fall amen amen endurance endurance in this lukewarm age let me know it's lukewarmness all around us layout asea riches and cares of life amen things that you got to endure endurance and have to have pain patience have to be patient in it in hebrews 6 and uh verse 11 and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence of full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen just like abraham how many knows abraham had to wait for 25 years and you know what it wasn't he didn't have to wait from 25 to 50 right that might have been an easy way or even for him from 50 to 75 now that was a little harder because sarah was already not able to have any more children anymore by the time god and they were calling to visit him but he was about 75 and sarah was about 65 and then god came and says i'm going to give you all a baby huh and then he went in from 75 to 85 90 years old am i right wait for all that time it had to be it had to be a thing of endurance well just keep waiting a lot of time we expect our prayers to be answered instantly when you get prayed for it you believe it you hang on to it and you believe it with all of your heart remember john ryan he came back and he said you know i didn't get healed brother god says you believe me to be a prayer prophet you believe god healed you he says well then keep believing that kate confessed to it he had to be told twice to hang on to him after the second time he kept hanging on to it he told a lot a lot of people he said i praise god i'm healed i can see praise god i'm healed he was wrong on his back but he couldn't see many times he wasn't he had to walk away and still be blind but one time the time came when he was in that barbershop isn't that right man had a razor black and he we're making fun of him this is the guy he's just the guy he's going around everywhere talking about being able to see and he's still buying his bat they had a little laugh no doubt huh he said that's right praise god i'm healed and just about that time his eyes popped open hello i don't care he probably had half his hair cut he didn't care how he looked he's jumping up jump up right up praise the lord that's probably god putting the barber right running behind him with a shaver in the raider and he was all looking funny here you know come on back here facebook why because he had endured patience wait for god didn't daniel pray for pray for something and he took 25 days for the angels finally come and answer his prayer imagine an angel having from what i understand you know and i don't know exactly just what they were battled but they were battling uh other spiritual powers to try to get to him how many believe we need patience folks we need patience evening light tabernacle you need patience people need patience endurance amen things just don't do more because god isn't in it how many believes you need god in it if you're going to endure amen that's right look he says be followers of them who threaten through faith and patience inherit the promises look to abraham look at how he waited and he had to be patient i like noah's example i mean those got a message and he was told that god is going to destroy to destroy the world and he preached for 120 years huh 120 years ma here we are folks we're up we're up close to the 75 80 year mark already since the prophet came on the scene and declared to the judgment of the world and the destruction of the world and so forth a long time amen so you have to endure noah preacher for 120 years look at how long he had to wait how long he had to endure all the scoffers never folks you know i don't know about you but the scoffers don't do much to deflect me how about you it don't matter how much they don't think there's a god and we come from monkeys and there's no judgment and all of that huh folks i'm telling you just like brother brown says you can't tell what's being people a lot of times you know we just had another mass shooting by some teenager that recorded his rampage huh no doubt he lived with mom dad neighbors and everybody but people did not see that in him huh perhaps didn't see that there's that potential and people are just you never know amen but aren't you glad for christians that are what they are be what you're supposed to be amen that's a christian amen praise the lord so in order brother and sister to have some kind of endurance you have to be born how many says to win at your birth people that are not born again they're about as unstable as they come that's why the world is in the condition that it's in now thinking of how christ would feel about the world and the condition that it's in now because there was times when jesus would you know tell that fox you know and so forth he kind of make a joke perhaps and then there's other times when jesus when he would sit on the side of a hill and then he said he wept he said oh jerusalem jerusalem i would have hovered you but you would not what about today let me tell you something that this world is in a very sad condition it's very sad to see oh my as you endure as you are like lot how many knows that lot was vexed by the conditions of sodom it says it vex his right to soul i mean that's the way that we feel that's the way we feel sometimes whenever you see two lesbians or homosexuals walking out that vexes your souls like oh how could this be or the hairdos people have the tattoos it matches you you realize that the precious soul there but it's absolutely taken over by spirit they need the freedom of god they need god more than anything else in the world but it vexes you it's a vexation and i believe god still feels i believe god feels the way about this generation the way that he did with noah's generation how did he feel [Music] he was grieved he was grieved and he says it repenteth me that i have made man he was very grieved with the way that humanity went and that's the way we feel this morning we are grieved with the way that humanity is gone you know in the bible talks paul talked about it as obeying all the laws of the land and so forth because they are policemen and they're there to make sure that you do that which is good that which is right and i thought you know that that's be a good that's a good law to follow is somebody that's enforcing good and right but now we have laws and our laws and so forth that are making right wrong and wrong right and if you don't believe in that wrong well they were going to persecute you that's where we're at in a terrible place amen and it's only people listen the world don't realize i hope the world hears this but you don't realize that the only reason that you're still here is because of god's long suffering for you i asked myself many times sitting out on my farm what am i still doing here what are we still doing here it's time for us to leave this place and how many believes we're going to leave in the moment and it's going to be a secret catching away folks it's going to be it's going to come in the time the world doesn't expect it amen and he says if you're not aware but paul said that day is not going to take you on unaware because you're not of the night and you're not asleep like they are we're going to be ready i mean we're going to be ready and waiting for the coming of the lord and when he comes we're going to be just taken out of here amen and the world will say well they just you know they were a little bit funny anyway they were in a cult they followed some man all kinds of things they'll say but it's all going to go amen now from what i understand people still preach still have a service it'll runs perhaps smooth for a while yet amen but when them two prophets come to israel hello when them two prophets come to israel we know that they'll shut up the skies the heavens that don't reign they have the power to bring curses and everything else upon the earth you talk about peril in that tribulation period it'll sure be perilous but it's the patience of almighty god amen how many knows god god is a god of patience amen okay second peter i wanted to read you this first peter not not second peter first peter one if you want with me let's start with verse 22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfraimed love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god how many knows when you're born by the word of god it changes your whole desire system it gives you a complete new outlook amen your high the word of god i want to say that so that you get that which liveth and abideth forever praise the lord i'm just glad that you know that you live eternally if you're born by the word of god you will never pass away you will never come to naught for all flesh peter saying here for all flesh is as grass the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away amen amen but the word of the lord endureth forever it'll never change and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you amen so in order for us to be be able to endure you have to be born by the word of god let's talk about patience for a little bit james if you will let's go to james can i mention one more thing before we we go into patience i want to just mention hebrews 12 where it talks about the lord said if you endure chastisement am i right because sometimes the lord correcting us and so forth we have to endure that if you can't endure that then you're not god's child it takes you know endurance and then it takes patience to be able to go through things james 1 and verse 2. my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divine divine divers temptations diverse knowing this that the trying of your faith works patience but let patience have her perfect work that she may be perfect in an entire lacking nothing i mean those it's something about trials that come your way tests that come your way that if you are patient through them and come out through them and obtain his patience it brings you to perfection how many knows israel did not have any endurance and they did not have patience every time they as soon as their stomach got a little hungry what did they do murmur complain huh as soon as they got a little thirsty they murmured they complain as soon as they come up to the red sea they murmur they complain they had no endurance they had no patience just wait i'm going to stay that wait on the lord shall renew their strength amen we need patience the world needs people out there on the road we need patience we here in elkton i need patience i'll tell you what i don't like to go to nashville i don't like to go to those places you know because we've been privileged just to have one red light here in elkton and you come up to that red light and you say well is this thing going to stay on forever even that you know and especially other places where the where the lights are forever you're like wow that does hardly ever change why but you find out that in bigger cities bigger drive through everything it just makes takes a lot more patience amen and i had thought about this i thought you know we're blessed we're blessed at where we lived you're blessed where you live amen i went to atlanta not so awful long ago i had to do business with uh the person that i bought some land off of and and i had to go downtown atlanta and and then out into the outskirts of atlanta some of that and seeing the apartment complexes and you know you have to figure out what building which apartment building is and i thought wow this is how these people have to live i would like thank you kentucky thank you lord for for what you've given me amen who i don't know somebody here said you know you have better than 90 of the people out there probably how many believes that you get to have your own place or have it paid for whatever it might be amen thank god now notice that you may be perfect in entire wanting nothing in james and verse chapter 5 if you will james 5 and we'll begin with verse 7 be patient therefore brethren unto the king of the lord amen let's all read that be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord how many beliefs that's what we got to do just be patient let me ask you this question what what one hope is there for this world there's only one hope the prophet said and he said the coming of the lord jesus christ is the only hope there is that's the only hope everything else is going to be cannon fire destruction destroyed that's not hope right to stay here is not hope the only hope that you and i have is the coming of the lord and to be caught up together to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with him amen that's the only hope but in it we have to be patient i believe as christians we have to be patient patient long suffering how many does we got to be long-suffering one with another i've lived long enough to know this that if you love somebody man you will cover a multitude of sins man you will have long suffering for a person amen if you've got love but i'll tell you what i've known people that don't have love they claim they have love but they don't have any patience for you whatsoever huh no forgiveness that's how you know whether somebody loves you or not if they're willing to be long-suffering and gentle with you forgiving am i right or unforgiving amen lord help us to have love be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord the husband waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it amen how many believe that god is patient one place that talks about the patience of god i'm going to come back to this but i want to read this right quick revelations 1 9 it says i john also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ huh isn't that what uh uh john i mean uh paul said in hebrews 12 run this race with patience looking unto jesus the author and the feature of our faith look at how patient he was with those sinners patient with those scribes and the pharisees patience when they were beating him patience when they were putting the stripes on his back huh he endured it says that jesus endured the cross he endured the hardships and then he says look at him at the end now he's at the right hand of god exalted above every name name above every name that there is amen he says look to him for your example of patience and endurance you look to christ and what he did amen okay so god is the husband that waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh amen how many knows that was the attitude of the christians 2 000 years ago he is coming it's almost here that's what they said it straws now it's almost here cannot presume for just a minute they probably presumed that the roman government would be the last government they didn't they expected the lord to come back any time they really were that was their expectation amen you say well how do you know he's coming now well we've had a prophet come to say this is it get ready let's say of the lord we're at the end amen so be patient establish status to establish your heart in other words set yourself honestly we need to set ourselves don't be distracted by anything don't let anything pull you away cause you the backslider or to be deterred this is the hour where you have to be patient established steadfast looking for the coming of the lord grudge not against one another brethren least he be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of job amen but in job look at how he endured look at the patience that he had look at his endurance i wanted to ask siri or or somehow find out just how long job was on the action i wonder how long he was in that condition maybe somebody can come up with that for me and have seen the end of the lord amen the end of the lord and that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy praise the lord amen so there it says look at look at the look look at all the examples that we have of patience of being patient and of enduring and keeping on keeping on because how many know sometimes your flesh don't feel like it sometimes you don't feel like praying sometimes you don't feel like going to church hey man that's just goes to show you you need to get on your prayer bones and say god i don't want to i this is home this is not this world is not my home i'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue everything around here is temporal everything is temporary and i'm looking for a city i'm looking for something that is eternal amen i already have eternal life but let me tell you what folks this cesspool this pet house is not my home it's not your home we're looking for a better place we desire like abraham a better a better land amen how many is doing that how many knows we need patience we need patience we need endurance how many feels like you needed i need more more endurance brother violet amen praise the lord god bless you like i said israel was an example of what you don't want to be they were impatient amen they were short dathan and korra they couldn't wait for god to do something let me know just wait for god to do it but they couldn't wait israel couldn't wait for god to supply food for him couldn't wait for some supply water for him if they'd have just waited i mean that would have made it way for him god would have given him what he'd give he would have given food he would have made the way but god was trying them he was testing them did they pass the test no the bible says if you are chastised if you're corrected and you can't take that correction that you're a bastard and not a son because a real son and daughter of god they can take the chastisement that comes amen that god gives amen plays the lord so i'll tell you what this morning my heart my heart just goes out amen because we realize that the world is in a real bad condition folks and you almost feel like jesus you know you feel like like perhaps jesus felt and that is just to sit on a hillside somewhere and weep say god you know look at what you did all day long he stretched out his hands but they would not not your destruction now your desolation comes upon you amen but thank god god knows those that are his amen god bless you this morning stand with me musicians if you'll come all i can tell you this morning is keeping worrying keep pressing on amen one of these days just as sure just as sure as if the clock keeps ticking tomorrow morning that alarm's going to go off it's going to be monday right you have to go back to work just that's how sure it is that one of these days jesus is going to come in the clouds of heaven and he's going to catch his little bride away and be gone amen and so shall we ever be with the lord that is our hope amen let's bow our heads why don't you ask yourself if you don't waver something ask if sometimes you get impatient or get lukewarm just kind of waver a little bit and you're not patient you're not you're not diligent in your prayer life like you should be you say god help me lord jesus establish my heart father help me lord be patient to your coming god bless you god bless those hands all over the building lord jesus it's so easy for it to happen in this hour that we're living in lord because of all the distraction because everything around us lord sometimes we're not enduring like we should be lord we get away from you we backslide we go we we kind of wobble so to speak in our walk with you in our relationship with you we wobble god we're not patient we're not enduring like we should be and we ask you to forgive us for that we ask lord jesus from this sunday morning on that you'll help us the lord stay focused god lord and endure lord go make it through this thing lord jesus and all the thoughts and the things that comes in our mind and to cast them out lord we've got to endure all the thoughts that come our way lord to commit it to you lord jesus we ask god that you'll bless every heart every hand this morning lord those that are not here but father hear of my voice lord we ask god a blessing upon them
