[11:11] Warner Brothers and Sisters
[11:15] we'll just stand this moment
[11:19] maybe brother Danny Wade will open us in
[11:21] prayer this morning
[11:35] and the children can be dismissed for
[11:37] Sunday School
[11:39] and we'll go in the Psalms here
[11:41] Psalms 24.
[11:53] Psalms 24
[11:58] the Earth is the Lord's in the fullness
[12:01] thereof the world and they that dwell
[12:04] therein
[12:11] who shall Ascend on into the hill of the
[12:13] Lord or who shall stand in his holy
[12:16] place
[12:25] you shall receive the blessings from the
[12:28] Lord
[12:28] and righteousness from The Lord of his
[12:31] salvation
[12:39] lift up your hands O ye gates and be
[12:42] lifted up
[12:44] ye are the lasting doors and the king of
[12:47] glory shall come in
[12:49] goodness
[12:55] dub your heads oh you Gates even lift
[12:58] them up the Everlasting doors and the
[13:00] king of glory shall come in
[13:02] who is this king of glory the lord of
[13:05] hosts he is the king of glory Selah God
[13:09] bless you may be seated brother Brian
[13:21] Warner Brothers and Sisters
[13:23] nor after reading the psalm like that
[13:25] what do you have to worry about what do
[13:28] you I mean really honestly what do you
[13:30] have to worry about you know when in the
[13:32] last couple of Scriptures it talks about
[13:34] the Everlast lasting Gates and the
[13:36] Everlasting doors
[13:38] well if you know your Bible you can
[13:39] think back all the way
[13:41] you know to a physical sense where
[13:44] Samson carry the gates of the city out
[13:46] onto the hill if God was able to do that
[13:49] with a man what could he do with any of
[13:51] us this morning whatever your
[13:53] circumstances are whatever problems you
[13:56] have whatever situations you have in
[13:58] your heart or in your life this morning
[14:00] and there's nothing that God can't
[14:03] deliver you from there's nothing no
[14:05] situation that we have this morning that
[14:07] God can't speak to us about this morning
[14:09] it all depends on your faith and how you
[14:11] acted on us each day
[14:14] um if you would come with me to uh
[14:17] the sixth chapter of Matthew
[14:25] you know we spent a lot of time worrying
[14:27] about things we have no control over
[14:29] you know we spend hours sometimes people
[14:32] you know
[14:34] everyone deals with situations and
[14:36] circumstances definitely you know we're
[14:39] not all the same God likes variety he
[14:42] doesn't like everything he's not trying
[14:44] to have a cookie cutter where everyone
[14:46] looks the same everyone has their own
[14:48] way about things but everything should
[14:50] be impurity with the word of God and
[14:53] that was uh reading the
[14:56] a couple of different devotionals this
[14:58] morning and the one was about how we
[15:00] spend people spend vast hours hours
[15:03] worrying about things like I just said
[15:05] not being repetitive that they have no
[15:07] control over
[15:10] um I'll I have this marked but we'll
[15:13] start about the 23rd verse of the sixth
[15:15] chapter of
[15:17] and uh this this is not what I'm talking
[15:20] about this morning but it's true but a
[15:23] fine eye the evil it's our whole body
[15:24] shall be full of darkness and you can't
[15:27] and
[15:28] just reading that simple sentence there
[15:30] you can't be two different things you
[15:32] can't be white and you can't be black
[15:33] you're either white or you're black
[15:35] you're either evil or you're righteous
[15:37] there's no in between There's No Gray
[15:39] areas in the word of God or in life and
[15:42] he goes on to say here no man can serve
[15:45] two masters for either he will hate the
[15:47] one or love the other or else he will
[15:50] hold to the one and despise the other
[15:52] you cannot serve God in Mammon you know
[15:56] live out there in the world and come in
[15:58] here on a Sunday and expect everything
[16:00] to be okay that that's a lot of Catholic
[16:02] theology there if you're if you're
[16:04] believing that
[16:06] and he goes on to say here this is the
[16:09] last spot I was thinking therefore I say
[16:11] unto you take no thought of your life
[16:13] for what you shall eat or what you shall
[16:16] drink nor yet for your body
[16:18] what you shall put on it is not the life
[16:21] more than meat and the body more than
[16:23] Raymond and that goes back to the psalm
[16:25] uh brother Troy was reading this morning
[16:28] you know and he goes on to say here
[16:32] behold the father of the air for they
[16:34] sell not neither do they reap nor gather
[16:36] into Barnes yet the heavenly father and
[16:38] the feet of them
[16:39] and are not much more than that goes to
[16:42] what I'm saying this morning you know
[16:45] God's more than able whatever it is this
[16:48] morning you know to take care of it this
[16:50] morning God really cares I'm I can say
[16:52] this but you've got to believe it and I
[16:54] got to believe it in my own heart my
[16:56] real God really cares about your about
[16:59] you he cares about everything about you
[17:02] if you're giving him what he deserves
[17:04] he'll give you what you deserve now what
[17:07] I mean by that it's not a legalism it's
[17:10] not law or it's not but it's just a
[17:14] relationship with Jesus Christ out of
[17:16] one love and another that they do things
[17:18] for each other and it goes on to say
[17:21] which of You by taking the thought can
[17:24] add one cubit onto a statue and why'd
[17:27] you take youth off for Raymond consider
[17:29] the lilies of the field for they grow
[17:31] material not neither do they spend
[17:34] goes back to what I said in the
[17:36] beginning you know
[17:38] plants don't worry about growing they
[17:40] just grow trees don't worry about
[17:42] growing they just grow they're trees
[17:44] they grow you know animals are the same
[17:47] way you're the same way that you grow in
[17:50] spiritually you grow in the natural you
[17:52] grow you can't change it you just grow
[17:54] and that's the way it is natural for a
[17:57] Christian you should grow in Christ
[18:00] you should grow on the word of God it's
[18:02] just a natural just a natural thing
[18:04] about it and it goes on to say and what
[18:07] you've taken thought can add one cubit
[18:09] onto his statue
[18:11] take you thought for Raymond consider
[18:13] the lilies of the field how they grow
[18:15] and they toil need a spin knot and I
[18:17] know I just reread that yet I say unto
[18:20] you that even Solomon and all this Glory
[18:21] was not right like one of these
[18:23] wherefore if God so close the grass of
[18:26] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[18:29] cast into the yavashall not he much more
[18:31] clothed you oh ye of little faith and I
[18:34] was that devotional this morning was
[18:36] talking about how people spent a lot of
[18:38] time worrying about things they can't
[18:39] control and it's the same for us this
[18:42] morning and you know I could say this
[18:43] today and then wake up tomorrow and have
[18:46] all kinds of problems and not do what
[18:48] I'm saying to do this morning we're all
[18:50] human beings we make mistakes therefore
[18:53] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[18:54] or what shall we drink or
[18:56] wherewithal we shall be clothed
[18:59] for after all these things do the
[19:01] Gentiles seek for your heavenly father
[19:03] knoweth that you may need of those
[19:05] things you know that's the whole
[19:07] thing about the world we live in this
[19:09] morning everything
[19:10] everyone is striving to be reach the
[19:13] goals that really won't matter on that
[19:15] day I guess it's the older you get the
[19:18] things that you thought were important
[19:19] really don't as you get older you
[19:21] realize they weren't as important
[19:23] doesn't mean when you're 20 years old
[19:24] they're not important but as you get
[19:27] older you you know you start
[19:29] thinking about all the all the things
[19:31] you desired to do and you realize in the
[19:34] context of things you know we all have
[19:36] an appointment we have to make and it's
[19:37] not going to change that date any bit
[19:39] and I'll finish reading this and seek ye
[19:42] first the kingdom of God and the
[19:43] righteousness and all things shall be
[19:45] added onto you
[19:47] take therefore no thought of the moral
[19:49] for the moral shall take care of thought
[19:51] of the things of itself sufficient is
[19:53] the dead and the evil thereof and then
[19:56] if you would jump with me this morning
[19:58] the Philippians
[20:03] the fourth chapter
[20:07] here this morning
[20:13] looking at the time back there I'll get
[20:16] started again
[20:18] I'll just read a few of these cursors
[20:19] here this morning and um
[20:21] this is what Paul had to say you know
[20:24] that's what in the gospel had to say and
[20:27] this is what Paul had to say therefore
[20:28] my brother on dearly beloved long for my
[20:32] joy and Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord
[20:34] my dearly beloved and forgive my
[20:36] pronunciations here are deceased
[20:39] additives and besee synthetic that
[20:41] they'd be the same mind in the Lord so
[20:43] Paul's telling his followers to have the
[20:46] same mind that he has it's no different
[20:48] for us this morning we should have the
[20:50] same the same mind that was in brother
[20:52] by Adam should it be the same mind in us
[20:55] and that mind is Jesus Christ and he
[20:58] goes on to say here I can do all
[21:01] I'll ask
[21:03] uh man I jumped a couple of scriptures
[21:05] here but uh you know I entry fee also
[21:08] true yoke fella help them those women
[21:12] which label with me in the gospel
[21:13] Clement and also what's with my fellow
[21:16] laborers whose names are in the Book of
[21:18] Life and then he gives us some
[21:20] principles here it says
[21:23] rejoice in the lord always I again I say
[21:26] rejoice you know you couldn't read these
[21:27] scriptures enough every day in
[21:29] devotional just like I said these will
[21:32] take all that word away if God cares
[21:34] about you enough to give you this word
[21:37] of God he cares about enough to bring
[21:39] this about in your life
[21:40] and he goes on to say here rejoice in
[21:43] the Lord again I say rejoice let your
[21:46] moderation be known unto all men and the
[21:48] Lord is at hand be careful for nothing
[21:50] and that goes what I was saying this
[21:52] morning about worrying
[21:54] Paul is telling us not to worry about
[21:56] anything and just put it in God's hand
[21:59] now I know I I'm saying this morning
[22:02] also but that changed that human nature
[22:04] and you know that human nature wants you
[22:06] to be concerned and worried about things
[22:09] you have no control over you got to
[22:11] fight that and goes on
[22:13] and God let your moderation be known
[22:15] unto all man the Lord is at hand be
[22:17] careful for nothing but in everything by
[22:19] prayer supplication and with
[22:22] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[22:24] unto God
[22:25] and the peace of God which passes all
[22:27] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[22:30] Minds through Jesus Christ
[22:32] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[22:34] true whatsoever things are on us
[22:37] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[22:39] things are pure whatsoever thing are
[22:42] lovely whatsoever things are good report
[22:45] if there be any virtue if there be any
[22:48] praise think on these things
[22:50] and I I was I'll just read this I'll
[22:53] read this a lot I know but this comes
[22:55] out of that uh book that brother Billy
[22:57] gave us years ago uh healing thoughts I
[23:00] don't know if you some of you still have
[23:02] that book
[23:03] but I'll I'll just read and sit down
[23:05] after this this morning
[23:07] but I I mean I I know I have a lot of
[23:10] inflections I say all the time I'm not
[23:12] trying to be repetitive but it's really
[23:15] important as
[23:16] the world you got to forget about the
[23:18] world out there
[23:20] as soon as you get out those double
[23:22] doors that whole world is centered on
[23:24] one thing just to get you to worry about
[23:27] things that you have no control over but
[23:29] I'll just read what brother
[23:31] had the same spiritual adoption it's
[23:34] this is the beginning of that book I
[23:36] know I say this a lot but you know I
[23:37] can't I just thought that it speak for
[23:40] itself
[23:41] and this is what he had to say in order
[23:43] to stay with God you have to stay gentle
[23:45] you have to fight that
[23:47] rough
[23:49] wanting to struggle and fuss with
[23:52] everyone's Spirit you got to be gentle
[23:55] doesn't say that you don't have to be
[23:57] firm with people you can still be firm
[24:00] with people and be gentle at the same
[24:02] time
[24:03] in order to stay with God stay gentle
[24:05] God is gentle in order to stay with God
[24:08] stay with love God is love
[24:11] you know you got to have both of those
[24:13] be gentle and love at the same time stay
[24:15] meek don't ever be self-sufficient and
[24:18] that's that one little short sentence
[24:21] right there is really hard for the day
[24:22] that we live in every
[24:24] you want to be self-sufficient everyone
[24:26] wants to be their own mate the own made
[24:29] man you know but self-sufficient I mean
[24:32] what he's trying to say here is that
[24:33] you're totally relying on Jesus Christ
[24:35] and everything
[24:37] uh always rely upon him never use your
[24:40] own mind again that's a hard thing to do
[24:43] never use your own mind take his
[24:45] thoughts and we know who Jesus's
[24:48] thoughts are it's the word of God and
[24:50] the message for the hour
[24:52] let his thoughts be your thoughts take
[24:54] them into your carnal mind and repeat
[24:56] them over and over
[24:58] and that one sentence right there is
[25:00] giving the young believer or whether
[25:02] he's
[25:03] 70 years old or whether he's 20 years
[25:06] old he's given you a principle right
[25:08] there that if you'll just do it he says
[25:11] I'll just reread it
[25:13] again never use your own mind take his
[25:16] thoughts let his thoughts be your
[25:17] thoughts take him in into your Colonial
[25:20] mind and repeat them over and over
[25:23] until they become a part of you
[25:25] basically what he's saying is you need
[25:26] to take the the word of God and which is
[25:30] the mind of God and his very thoughts
[25:32] and just repeat it over and over and
[25:34] over again until it becomes a part of
[25:36] you that's not a vain vain repetition
[25:39] but you're applying the word of God to
[25:42] your life over and over and over again
[25:44] until you bring it into Fruit into
[25:47] existence
[25:50] so and goes on to say so oh God take all
[25:54] my doubt away and let my thoughts be
[25:56] your thoughts
[25:57] and this age is very hard that his
[26:00] thoughts be your thoughts
[26:02] away the thought of thickness sickness
[26:05] take God's healing thoughts and let them
[26:07] become your thoughts and think on these
[26:10] things that's really important for the
[26:12] age that we live in think on his
[26:14] thoughts not just for
[26:16] natural healing whatever your spiritual
[26:19] problems are for Spiritual healing
[26:21] Whatever It Is God I I can't say this
[26:24] enough whatever it is I know that God is
[26:27] more than able to take care of it this
[26:29] morning brother David

[36:01] surgery on our eye and they haven't told
[36:04] me when they're going to do the left eye
[36:05] yet so
[36:06] uh we got to get a couple doctors
[36:09] make up their minds so just continue to
[36:12] remember that and we we can see some
[36:13] better and maybe I won't mess up so much
[36:16] since when I get where I can see better
[36:18] and I uh
[36:20] we had prayer Wednesday night for my
[36:22] granddaughter Chloe
[36:24] she was in the Vanderbilt's children
[36:26] hospital and
[36:28] they had finally figured out what was
[36:29] wrong with her calling off her causing
[36:32] all her problems and we had prayer
[36:34] Wednesday night and I was telling
[36:37] brother Steve and
[36:38] they uh
[36:41] the the nurse I think she'd been there
[36:43] 15 or 18 years and she said I've never
[36:46] seen nothing like this before it just
[36:48] all
[36:50] and there was a little bitty spot at the
[36:53] bottom that they took to send off for
[36:56] some test work that was all that was
[36:57] left just enough so they could make sure
[36:59] I guess they were right she said I've
[37:01] never seen that so there's no no scar no
[37:04] nothing it's just it's gone
[37:07] all right

[37:21] their eyes to see how wonderful and

[1:05:49] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[1:05:52] if you have committed sins they shall be
[1:05:54] forgiven him
[1:05:55] confess your faults one to another not
[1:05:58] just anybody see and pray one for
[1:06:01] another that ye may be healed
[1:06:05] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:06:07] righteous man availeth much Elijah was a
[1:06:10] man's subject to like passions as we are
[1:06:13] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[1:06:15] not rain and it rained not on the Earth
[1:06:18] by the space of three years and six
[1:06:20] months and he prayed again
[1:06:24] and the heaven gave rain
[1:06:26] and the Earth brought forth her fruit
[1:06:28] Brethren if any of you do err from the
[1:06:31] truth and one convert him let him know
[1:06:35] that he which converteth The Sinner from
[1:06:37] the era of his way
[1:06:40] shall save a soul from death and shall
[1:06:43] hide a multitude
[1:06:46] sins
[1:06:48] amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[1:06:52] you Lord for the word do we have just
[1:06:54] read and we pray that you blessed as it
[1:06:56] goes forth to the hearts of your
[1:06:58] children
[1:06:59] we just thank you for the good
[1:07:00] Fellowship we had last night
[1:07:04] brother Glenn and Sherry come over and
[1:07:07] and uh my the experiences that him and
[1:07:10] brother Sean had had through the war
[1:07:13] and you watched over them and protected
[1:07:15] them and brought them out over and
[1:07:18] and I know you were protecting all of us
[1:07:20] Lord we have an angel with us
[1:07:22] so father now we just commit ourselves
[1:07:25] into your hands and we step aside in
[1:07:27] Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:07:29] and I believe you Lord is Supply ever
[1:07:31] need here amen God bless you
[1:07:38] I'd like to take a little subject and I
[1:07:40] want to call it uh Divine Healing for
[1:07:43] the obedient
[1:07:46] and I would like to Major upon obedience
[1:07:51] and uh
[1:07:53] Divine Healing is the personal property
[1:07:57] of every believing child of God that
[1:08:00] belongs to you
[1:08:02] it's the earnest of the Resurrection if
[1:08:05] there's no Divine Healing
[1:08:07] there's no Resurrection
[1:08:09] because if it can't heal you he can't
[1:08:11] raise you up
[1:08:14] and the prophet said the right mental
[1:08:16] attitude towards any Divine promise
[1:08:19] any Divine promise
[1:08:22] we'll bring it to pass and like the
[1:08:24] brother said this morning he was quoting
[1:08:25] the prophet and he said take those
[1:08:28] scriptures into your carnal mind and
[1:08:30] repeat them until they become a reality
[1:08:32] to you
[1:08:34] what do people in the natural do you
[1:08:37] know in sports and all they they are out
[1:08:39] there practicing daily aren't they
[1:08:43] and our singers or whatever they're out
[1:08:45] there in a in a
[1:08:47] uh like a generator just generating what
[1:08:51] they're going to be doing
[1:08:54] well what about us
[1:08:56] how busy we should be for the Lord amen
[1:08:59] now Divine Healing is based upon first
[1:09:02] of all Divine Healing is based upon the
[1:09:05] word of God
[1:09:07] Psalms 107 verse 20 he sent his word
[1:09:12] and healed him
[1:09:15] he spoke the world into existence didn't
[1:09:17] he I spoke he isn't that something how
[1:09:20] he spoke the word
[1:09:22] and he believed what he spoke
[1:09:26] isn't that beautiful
[1:09:28] and it came to pass
[1:09:30] now secondly Divine Healing is based
[1:09:34] upon the atonement and the atonement is
[1:09:37] the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:09:40] centers you were healed
[1:09:44] and if you were healed past tense then
[1:09:47] you are healed now present tense oh I
[1:09:51] like that yes amen hallelujah now let's
[1:09:55] go to mark 16.
[1:10:03] people might think we don't need that
[1:10:05] Mark 16 I think we do
[1:10:08] yeah
[1:10:10] Mark 16
[1:10:13] and 15.
[1:10:15] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:10:17] world and preach the gospel
[1:10:20] to every creature he that believeth that
[1:10:23] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:10:26] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:10:28] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:10:31] my name shall they cast out devils they
[1:10:34] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:10:36] take up serpents
[1:10:38] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:10:41] shall not
[1:10:42] hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:10:45] on the sick and they shall recover now
[1:10:49] it didn't say when they would recover
[1:10:52] he said but they shall recover
[1:10:55] and I want you to believe that with all
[1:10:57] your heart you shall recover
[1:11:01] amen now if you're prayed for you've
[1:11:05] been prayed for you've asked to be
[1:11:07] prayed for uh then the next thing is to
[1:11:12] act like you're healed even if you don't
[1:11:14] feel like you're healed
[1:11:16] and that's the way I've been doing for
[1:11:18] years my fingers was giving me a problem
[1:11:21] about the guitar
[1:11:22] I had and I
[1:11:25] and I I said and brother Brown said if
[1:11:28] you can't do nothing but wiggle your
[1:11:29] finger said wiggle it and give God
[1:11:32] praise that you're healed just go ahead
[1:11:34] and wiggle it
[1:11:35] so I've been wiggling for over five
[1:11:37] years I've been wiggling
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:41] and saying that I'm Healed
[1:11:45] and it used to lock up he locked up and
[1:11:48] NATO Sister Anne I said pull that thing
[1:11:51] loose
[1:11:52] we was out working one day and in the
[1:11:55] yard and that thing locked up on me and
[1:11:58] she pulled it loose and when she did I
[1:12:00] went oh I mean I I wouldn't tell you how
[1:12:03] loud it was you know because
[1:12:05] oh it hurts so bad
[1:12:08] and I I went to the doctor uh not too
[1:12:11] long ago and uh
[1:12:13] he'd give me a shot of cortisone he says
[1:12:15] now it's since this has been bothering
[1:12:17] you so long since I don't know if this
[1:12:19] will work
[1:12:20] and I I said well it used to lock up on
[1:12:23] me he said it don't lock up now and he
[1:12:25] said well it must have healed itself but
[1:12:27] I knew better than that I knew God had
[1:12:29] healed me
[1:12:30] amen so I just let him say his little
[1:12:33] speech and uh
[1:12:35] because it wouldn't do no good to that
[1:12:38] at the time
[1:12:40] praise God but anyway I was acting like
[1:12:44] I'm Healed and I'm still active
[1:12:47] that I'm Healed
[1:12:49] as a matter of fact at one time in my
[1:12:52] life I thought about making a guitar
[1:12:53] special you know just a guitar tape just
[1:12:56] picking it out
[1:12:57] and the devil didn't like it
[1:13:00] see he says I'll just do you know I was
[1:13:02] trying to get him
[1:13:03] well he ain't got me yet
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:08] praise God so she said you've got to put
[1:13:11] your faith you've got to put your faith
[1:13:13] into action
[1:13:15] you got to act like you're healed just
[1:13:18] like when I I had one promise of a paint
[1:13:21] job I told you Wednesday night I had one
[1:13:23] promise of the paint job and I jumped
[1:13:25] out on it and I went to church and I
[1:13:27] said I'm covered up with paint job
[1:13:30] and I wasn't covered up
[1:13:33] by no means
[1:13:35] but word got the word got the word they
[1:13:38] were started telling about us and before
[1:13:40] you know it two weeks later we slammed
[1:13:42] under
[1:13:43] and we had slammed under for 10 years
[1:13:45] straight years
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:49] praise God then we slacked up a little
[1:13:51] while and I said well just get back to
[1:13:53] paint
[1:13:54] boy you know what I said I'm covered up
[1:13:56] here we here we go again covered up
[1:13:59] your words that you speak
[1:14:02] it hits the central nervous system of
[1:14:04] your body the speech nerve center
[1:14:07] and like we said Wednesday when you
[1:14:09] speak a word and say well I feel like
[1:14:12] I'm taking the flu
[1:14:15] well why can't we just say I feel like
[1:14:18] I'm taking healing
[1:14:20] well I mean I'm taking healing let's say
[1:14:23] that I'm taking healing that's better
[1:14:26] than saying I'm taking this and I'm
[1:14:28] taking this and Mama had this Daddy had
[1:14:31] this this wouldn't have this and this
[1:14:33] one had this but it's going to stop
[1:14:34] right here
[1:14:37] I ain't taking it
[1:14:40] so
[1:14:41] uh
[1:14:44] James 2 18 show me thy faith without thy
[1:14:48] works and I will show thee my faith by
[1:14:50] my works
[1:14:52] so what he's saying is without works you
[1:14:55] can't prove you've got faith
[1:14:59] hold on
[1:15:01] and anyone can see that I have
[1:15:04] the way I act
[1:15:08] anyone can see I got faith by the way I
[1:15:10] act
[1:15:13] and so
[1:15:15] James 2 26 for as the body without the
[1:15:18] spirit is dead
[1:15:20] so faith without works is dead also
[1:15:24] see
[1:15:26] we have a living faith
[1:15:29] faith has to talk
[1:15:31] it's going to use your lips to do it let
[1:15:34] your faith talk
[1:15:36] amen
[1:15:38] now God told Israel how to get their
[1:15:41] land healed in second chronicles 7 14
[1:15:44] said If my people which are called by my
[1:15:47] name
[1:15:48] shall humble themselves
[1:15:51] and pray and seek my face and turn from
[1:15:54] their Wicked Ways then will I hear from
[1:15:57] heaven and will forgive their sin and
[1:15:59] will heal their land
[1:16:03] see now
[1:16:07] ah
[1:16:09] you see God demands obedience
[1:16:13] now let's go to Acts 19.
[1:16:32] oh man acts 19. now notice this in 11
[1:16:37] and 12.
[1:16:39] and God brought special Miracles by the
[1:16:42] hands of Paul
[1:16:44] so that from his body were brought unto
[1:16:46] the sick handkerchiefs
[1:16:48] or aprons
[1:16:50] and the diseases departed from them and
[1:16:54] the evil spirits went out of them
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] now in a message called the life story
[1:17:03] the prophet said this
[1:17:07] you must never try to get anything from
[1:17:10] God
[1:17:11] without first being right with God
[1:17:17] amen and in Psalm 66 18 if I regard
[1:17:22] iniquity in my heart the Lord will not
[1:17:25] hear me
[1:17:27] in other words he's saying
[1:17:30] he would not have listened if I had not
[1:17:33] confessed my sins
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] now and then you're instructed in this
[1:17:41] to call your neighbors pastor
[1:17:45] and notice real careful if you've got
[1:17:48] anything that's in your heart against
[1:17:50] anyone
[1:17:52] go make it right first
[1:17:56] and come back and then pray
[1:17:59] and have a prayer meeting in your home
[1:18:01] and pin this handkerchief to your
[1:18:03] underneath garment then believe God
[1:18:08] you can't have anything
[1:18:10] in your heart against anyone someone
[1:18:12] asked Billy Paul said what is the
[1:18:14] greatest Miracle you saw in in the life
[1:18:16] of William Brown he said oh the greatest
[1:18:18] Miracle he said was
[1:18:21] that no matter who his enemies were you
[1:18:25] couldn't tell if they were his enemies
[1:18:27] or not because he treated them all the
[1:18:30] same enemies and Christians he treated
[1:18:33] them all the same and think about this
[1:18:37] had such a gift in his life that one
[1:18:39] brother told him said I love you brother
[1:18:41] Byron and he said down in his heart I
[1:18:43] knew he didn't
[1:18:45] can you imagine living with that
[1:18:48] and people say well I wished I had a
[1:18:50] Ministry like that he said don't never
[1:18:52] desire a Ministry like
[1:18:54] they said you don't know what you are
[1:18:58] asking for
[1:18:59] right he said I cast them Devils out and
[1:19:01] they come back at night and haunt me
[1:19:04] that night he said I got a little battle
[1:19:06] all my own
[1:19:08] sometimes two or three hours sleep a
[1:19:10] night
[1:19:11] amen makes you think don't you
[1:19:15] I mean what little price are we paying
[1:19:17] for the Lord
[1:19:19] yeah it's like the brother was saying
[1:19:21] this morning that those devotions were
[1:19:22] so beautiful
[1:19:24] words now
[1:19:27] then believe God I remember years ago
[1:19:30] when I was Pastor in a little church in
[1:19:32] uh
[1:19:33] Belmont North Carolina
[1:19:37] had a little group there and uh there
[1:19:39] was a sister that come there her name
[1:19:41] was Hilda Chavis
[1:19:43] and uh
[1:19:45] she began to have headaches you know and
[1:19:47] and uh
[1:19:49] she went to the doctor and they found
[1:19:51] out she had a tumor on the brain
[1:19:54] uh and it was pretty hopeless
[1:19:59] and so uh
[1:20:01] I began to pray for you know and and we
[1:20:05] was all we we laid hands on and prayed
[1:20:07] for but she still ended up in the
[1:20:09] hospital that still God though still God
[1:20:12] works everything out
[1:20:14] and so
[1:20:16] I had a dream of sister Hilda
[1:20:19] and I'm glad I read about the
[1:20:21] handkerchiefs and aprons came from Paul
[1:20:25] well
[1:20:27] brother Sean I had a prayer Clause that
[1:20:29] brother Brian had prayed over and I
[1:20:32] forgot where I put it
[1:20:34] and I collect wheat pennies or I used to
[1:20:37] I ain't much in collecting
[1:20:40] pennies no more I'm getting ready to get
[1:20:43] out of here
[1:20:45] but anyway I I you know I forgot where
[1:20:50] I'd put that crack off because I wanted
[1:20:52] to take it to Hilda you know
[1:20:56] so uh
[1:21:00] I got to looking in my wheat pennies one
[1:21:03] day and I just was looking around Emmett
[1:21:04] and I've seen that prayer cloth
[1:21:08] and I thought wow
[1:21:13] I got tied up to the hospital
[1:21:17] and she said
[1:21:18] brother the whole I've got a dream I
[1:21:21] want to tell you about I said and I had
[1:21:23] already dreamed about this too she said
[1:21:25] yeah and I got one too
[1:21:26] or she's I told her what I I was fixing
[1:21:29] to tell her she said well I got a dream
[1:21:31] I want to tell you
[1:21:32] I think she told me hers first
[1:21:35] and
[1:21:36] I said well
[1:21:38] she says I saw you and two more Brothers
[1:21:40] in a
[1:21:44] and you were passing a wheat penny two
[1:21:46] more preachers and then you were passing
[1:21:48] a wheat penny to each other
[1:21:50] and said you gotta hold up and said I
[1:21:52] know who needs this Hilda
[1:21:56] and I said well you know what
[1:21:58] you know where I found this prayer cloth
[1:22:00] I found it in my wheat pennies
[1:22:03] and it's for you this is for you Hilda
[1:22:07] she put it on
[1:22:09] and it went along to she was out of the
[1:22:11] hospital completely healed
[1:22:14] Hallelujah
[1:22:16] praise God
[1:22:19] Hallelujah and I thought that was so
[1:22:22] amazing and you know brother Brown said
[1:22:24] look at us look at us in the condition
[1:22:26] we're in
[1:22:27] and look look what God does for us in
[1:22:30] the condition that we're in he said what
[1:22:31] if we were one heart and one chord just
[1:22:34] constantly thinking about the Lord
[1:22:36] constantly talking about him
[1:22:38] praying and seeking his faith as the
[1:22:41] scripture said
[1:22:42] as the scripture said he said it's
[1:22:45] untelling what God would do
[1:22:47] said we'd see all kind of things going
[1:22:49] on
[1:22:50] do you believe that
[1:22:52] I believe I'm just full enough to
[1:22:53] believe it
[1:22:55] amen
[1:22:58] that might say well brother Hall you're
[1:23:00] a fool absolutely
[1:23:02] Christ now who's fool are they
[1:23:06] amen and so anyway uh I remember this
[1:23:11] sister that was in a church she wanted
[1:23:13] me to go pray for her brother that was
[1:23:15] in the hospital
[1:23:17] and uh he was one of these uh wrestlers
[1:23:20] on TV and they called him pretty boy
[1:23:22] David
[1:23:23] it's just a you know a name they give
[1:23:25] him and he was a tough guy but he got in
[1:23:28] practice he got thrown out of the ring
[1:23:30] on top of his head that cracked his
[1:23:32] skull all the way around
[1:23:34] and he was bleeding out of his ear and
[1:23:35] they couldn't stop the blood
[1:23:37] and so I I went up there and honestly I
[1:23:41] was walking in the spirit I I was
[1:23:43] thinking about the word and I was
[1:23:45] it felt like I felt like Jesus Christ
[1:23:48] was walking in that hospital
[1:23:51] and I got into that where David was and
[1:23:54] I said um
[1:23:55] you know I approached him I'm sure I
[1:23:58] approached him by his soul and
[1:23:59] everything everything was okay
[1:24:02] and so I just want to make sure
[1:24:04] everything was right
[1:24:05] you know
[1:24:07] and so we prayed a simple little prayer
[1:24:09] and honestly I'm not just saying this it
[1:24:13] immediately stopped
[1:24:15] stop the blood stopped
[1:24:18] amen God God
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:21] God did it where the doctors couldn't do
[1:24:23] it the main doctor walked in there
[1:24:28] amen the main doctor walked in
[1:24:31] now he sent his word
[1:24:34] and heal them so you so what can you do
[1:24:37] you can take this message for your
[1:24:39] healing
[1:24:41] amen whatever you need I you know I love
[1:24:44] to hear the word of God sometimes I'll
[1:24:46] be hearing it
[1:24:48] a big part of the day and sometimes I'll
[1:24:51] hear a message
[1:24:53] it seemed like I heard one message about
[1:24:56] 300 times one year because I wanted to
[1:24:58] know for I wanted to know the truth and
[1:25:01] there was something in there I needed
[1:25:06] couldn't help it I had to have it now
[1:25:08] I'm on the Hebrew series and I I you
[1:25:11] know I'm I'm stuck on here for a while
[1:25:12] and I don't care if if I've sticked the
[1:25:15] rest of my life I love it
[1:25:19] there's something about that Hebrew
[1:25:21] series when I first read that book on
[1:25:23] the Hebrew series I could
[1:25:26] city law but there's difference between
[1:25:29] law and Grace and brother Ram said law
[1:25:32] and Grace cannot exist at the same time
[1:25:37] and there was some people not too long
[1:25:39] ago trying to get me to see that we were
[1:25:41] worship on Saturday and so forth like
[1:25:43] that you know you know on me
[1:25:45] and uh and and and so when you look at
[1:25:49] the Rich Young Ruler coming to Jesus
[1:25:51] uh he said what can I do to inherit
[1:25:54] inherit eternal life you know what can I
[1:25:57] do he said well keep the Commandments
[1:26:00] they told him he said which
[1:26:03] he said well Thou shalt not kill or Thou
[1:26:06] shalt not uh commit adulthood Thou shalt
[1:26:08] honor thy father and mother but he
[1:26:10] bypassed the fourth Commandment which
[1:26:13] was to keep the Sabbath day and keep it
[1:26:15] holy he didn't tell him to keep that
[1:26:17] because why the Sabbath was already
[1:26:20] there
[1:26:21] right there God in flesh
[1:26:24] that was the true Sabbath because Jesus
[1:26:26] said come unto me all ye that labor and
[1:26:28] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:26:31] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:26:34] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[1:26:37] shall find Sabbath our rest unto your
[1:26:40] souls so we rest every day we don't just
[1:26:43] hey take Saturday off and just not do
[1:26:46] nothing hey every day is a rest day for
[1:26:49] us
[1:26:49] in COD
[1:26:53] of course we come on Sunday because we
[1:26:55] uh respect the the Resurrection Day
[1:26:59] we give honor
[1:27:01] and uh
[1:27:03] uh
[1:27:04] so many things but anyway
[1:27:08] uh let's go into the uh one little
[1:27:11] thought here about the ten lepers that
[1:27:13] came to Jesus
[1:27:15] and they said master
[1:27:18] have mercy on us can you imagine
[1:27:21] yourself as a leper
[1:27:23] and they came to Jesus and said
[1:27:26] Master have mercy on us
[1:27:29] and he told him to do one little simple
[1:27:31] thing
[1:27:34] he said
[1:27:36] show yourselves to the priest now you
[1:27:40] don't show yourselves to the
[1:27:42] priest as a leper unless you're healed
[1:27:47] but as they went in obedience with what
[1:27:50] we're talking about what are we talking
[1:27:52] about Divine Healing
[1:27:55] obedience
[1:27:58] see as they went they were healed
[1:28:03] so as you step out by faith on the word
[1:28:06] of God and just keep on keep on at it
[1:28:10] you will be healed
[1:28:12] I promise you it's God's word
[1:28:15] now another instant
[1:28:18] uh
[1:28:21] I tell you what let's go and read I've
[1:28:23] got
[1:28:24] another scripture too I want to read to
[1:28:26] you this morning uh let's go to Second
[1:28:29] Kings 5 and look at it let's look at
[1:28:31] something there
[1:28:33] Second Kings five
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] oh my I just don't you just love the
[1:28:44] word of God from Genesis to Revelation
[1:28:46] to communion foreign
[1:28:52] amen here we go now second Kings
[1:28:56] five
[1:28:58] 10 to 15 to 14. now let's look at the
[1:29:01] the attitude of um of Naaman
[1:29:05] unless he has attitude changed okay
[1:29:09] all right here we go
[1:29:10] and Elisha sent a messenger unto him
[1:29:14] saying because you know he wanted to be
[1:29:16] cured of his leprosy
[1:29:19] he was a LEP
[1:29:21] and so Elisha sent a messenger unto him
[1:29:24] he didn't come out he sent a messenger
[1:29:27] saying go and wash in Jordan seven flesh
[1:29:31] shall come again to thee and thou shalt
[1:29:33] be claimed oh but Naaman got an attitude
[1:29:36] didn't he
[1:29:38] but Naaman was Roth and went away and
[1:29:42] said behold I thought now don't that get
[1:29:45] people in trouble
[1:29:47] well I thought the message meant this I
[1:29:51] thought the word meant that it means
[1:29:54] exactly what it says
[1:29:57] amen
[1:29:59] God don't need no interpreter he's his
[1:30:01] own interpreter
[1:30:04] and so anyway he said behold I thought
[1:30:07] he will surely come out to me and stand
[1:30:10] and call on the name of the Lord his God
[1:30:12] and strike his hand over the place and
[1:30:15] recover the leper he wanted hands laid
[1:30:18] on him didn't he
[1:30:19] oh come on out here
[1:30:21] but he
[1:30:23] God had a way of doing things
[1:30:26] are not abanar and farther rivers of
[1:30:31] Damascus better than all the rivers of
[1:30:33] Israel they are not wash in them and be
[1:30:36] clean so he turned and went away in a
[1:30:39] rage he must have really had a
[1:30:41] temperament
[1:30:43] oh my
[1:30:45] way in a rage
[1:30:48] and his servants came near and spake
[1:30:52] unto him and said my father if the
[1:30:54] prophet had bid thee do some great thing
[1:30:57] would us thou not have done it
[1:31:00] how much
[1:31:02] rather than when he saith
[1:31:06] clean well he finally got his cool down
[1:31:09] he finally
[1:31:11] pulled off
[1:31:16] yeah
[1:31:18] then when he down oh yeah he finally
[1:31:22] finally obeyed the word didn't he
[1:31:24] and dipped himself seven times in Jordan
[1:31:27] oh muddy Jordan
[1:31:30] according to the saying of the man of
[1:31:32] God and his flesh came again like unto
[1:31:34] the Flesh of a little child and he was
[1:31:38] clean
[1:31:40] he should have done that to begin with
[1:31:42] but he had to learn lesson I guess you
[1:31:44] know
[1:31:46] if you don't learn by your mistakes they
[1:31:49] ain't no use to make them
[1:31:51] you know
[1:31:55] really and so
[1:31:59] I got a couple more things I want to
[1:32:01] tell you
[1:32:04] praise the Lord
[1:32:06] and Mark 5 there was a man with a
[1:32:08] withered hand
[1:32:10] and Jesus said stretch forth thine hand
[1:32:18] you man that's all I got to do Lord
[1:32:23] amen
[1:32:26] and he stretched it out and his hand was
[1:32:29] restored whole as the other
[1:32:31] by simply obeying
[1:32:37] all you got to do is obey
[1:32:40] obey what God Said and you'll be the
[1:32:43] happiest person in this world
[1:32:45] God wants you to be happy so settle up
[1:32:48] and let us go
[1:32:49] amen amen
[1:32:54] God wants you to be happy he don't want
[1:32:57] you to go around frowning he wants you
[1:33:00] to be happy
[1:33:01] you know brother Byron and sister meet
[1:33:03] he was Uptown you know one day and
[1:33:04] brother man was always saying hey how
[1:33:06] you doing hey and
[1:33:09] I don't know if you're that way but I
[1:33:11] want to meet no strangers I just like to
[1:33:13] be friendly with everybody
[1:33:16] and some people said well I'm just
[1:33:18] singing to the bride well that's good
[1:33:21] but I like to sing to the bride and
[1:33:23] whosoever will let him come and drink
[1:33:24] the water of Life freely that's what the
[1:33:26] spirit's at
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:32] so there's children out there that's not
[1:33:34] in the bride that's his children that
[1:33:36] will make it in
[1:33:38] and so
[1:33:40] anyway they were going along hello
[1:33:44] he said maybe that sister said hello
[1:33:48] she said I said hello
[1:33:51] he said well I never heard you she said
[1:33:53] I smiled
[1:33:57] he said oh a little old possum Grand
[1:33:59] that ain't worth nothing
[1:34:01] he said you ought to speak up
[1:34:04] hello how are you shake your hand
[1:34:08] and uh
[1:34:09] I just thought I'd throw that in because
[1:34:11] it come to me so
[1:34:13] you when something comes to your mind
[1:34:15] we'll do it
[1:34:16] it's all right now
[1:34:19] I got two more scriptures
[1:34:23] let's go to Isaiah
[1:34:29] first chapter
[1:34:34] I see
[1:34:37] Isaiah first chapter
[1:34:46] verses 18 to 20. come now
[1:34:51] you know isn't it something how God
[1:34:52] always is coming on the scene about now
[1:34:57] because now Faith is and and uh
[1:35:01] and there's so many scriptures in the
[1:35:04] Bible that you can take and defeat the
[1:35:05] Devil
[1:35:08] it's like
[1:35:09] this guy wanted to be positive I was
[1:35:11] telling brother Sean he wanted to be
[1:35:13] positive he didn't want to be negative
[1:35:14] in his testimony and somebody and he was
[1:35:16] having a bad day have you ever had a bad
[1:35:19] day
[1:35:20] he was having one and somebody said
[1:35:23] how you doing
[1:35:26] I didn't want to speak negative he said
[1:35:29] uh um oh I'm having a Romans 8 28.
[1:35:33] that means all things work together for
[1:35:35] good to them that love God
[1:35:37] and he just smiled and said I'm having a
[1:35:39] Romans 8 28. praise the Lord all right
[1:35:42] come now and let us reason together
[1:35:44] saith the Lord though your sins be a
[1:35:47] Scarlet they should be as white as snow
[1:35:49] though they'd be absent they shall be
[1:35:52] his wool if you be willing now let you
[1:35:55] hear
[1:35:56] if you be willing there it is
[1:36:00] and obedient
[1:36:03] ye shall eat the good of the land
[1:36:06] but if you refuse and rebel ye shall be
[1:36:10] devoured with the sword for the mouth of
[1:36:12] the Lord hath spoken it amen so in one
[1:36:16] more scripture
[1:36:18] and we're getting pretty close to the
[1:36:19] close and
[1:36:21] but I want to go over here to proverbs
[1:36:24] 13.
[1:36:26] thank you
[1:36:28] you know Proverbs 13 yeah
[1:36:33] there's one scripture that that helps a
[1:36:36] pastor and it helps everyone
[1:36:39] and that is he that handleth the matter
[1:36:41] wisely
[1:36:43] shall find good
[1:36:46] sometimes you hear things going on and
[1:36:48] if you go siding in with it you better
[1:36:51] be careful
[1:36:52] he that handleth the matter wisely
[1:36:56] shall find good
[1:36:58] now I just
[1:37:02] Proverbs 13 15.
[1:37:14] I see
[1:37:16] good understanding giveth favor but the
[1:37:20] way of transgressors is hard

[1:37:31] had got away from the Lord
[1:37:34] but bad case of ulcers

[1:37:54] but God knew where he was at
[1:37:57] and he was upon a mountain God came to
[1:37:59] him and said get to Billy Paul as quick
[1:38:01] as possible
