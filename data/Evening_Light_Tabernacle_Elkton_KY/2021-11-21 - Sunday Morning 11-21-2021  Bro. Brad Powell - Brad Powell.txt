christ's name amen and amen better try children can be dismissed for sunday school and if you'll go with me in the psalms we're gonna finish uh psalms 119 here we're psalms 119 we're going to start in reverse uh 161 i was reading for some reason i turned to that i didn't have it mark or anything but i read that i said i'm sure i was doing the bible read i said that's the verse that's what i was yeah and here he goes right to it that's good praise the lord 161 princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart standeth in all of thy word i rejoice that thy word i hate in a poor lying but thy great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them my soul hath kept thy testimonies and i love them exceedingly let my cry come near before thee o lord give me give me understanding according to thy word my lips shall utter praise when thou hast taught me thy statutes shall speak with thy word let thy hand help me for i have chosen thy precepts let my soul live and it shall praise thee and let thy judgments help me i have gone astray like a lost sheep seek a servant for i do not forget thy commandments amen god bless you may be seated brother brian for adult city school my brothers and sisters there was uh one of those scriptures we were reading uh i thought i found it but i couldn't find it but i was uh before you if you return with me to uh first peter the second chapter you know i was listening to a message this morning and it said the name of it was god's provided way of healing i didn't write down the month and the day but it was in 1954 and uh brother brother branham was talking about you know what we all need to do he was teaching them so they could have healing ministries but this was as i was listening it he said that he was talking about out of revelations now at the end times that uh it was kind of funny he talked about germ warfare and i was just thinking of our current state where we're at today in our own in our own people thinking of in genesis from basically the sixth to the tenth chapter where nimrod and and the people after the flood they tried to force themselves into a one-world government and in a one world society by building the tower of babel and the only way god was able to destroy it was to change all the languages on the face of the earth so people couldn't communicate together if you can't communicate you can't work together and i was just thinking of the day we're in today where you don't have to know someone's language to communicate with them all because of the internet and everything that's going on in the world today you can communicate thousands of miles across the globe even though you might not speak the name same language both the internet you're able to communicate and i was just thinking in that even in our own country and in the world i'm not saying that kova 19 is this german warfare that he was talking about but they're using covet 19 to bring everyone under submission to make everyone do what they tell you to do and it's almost forcing the whole world to do the same thing now i know that you can't i'm not a conspiracy inside conspiracy inside conspiracy kind of guy but you think of the last you if you look at the last 11 months or the last nine months or 10 months and you look at the four years before that it's like our enemy is kind of angry that thing that his plan will slow down and he's doing everything he can to accelerate whatever that plan is and it just lets me know that as a christian or as a believer it's really important to hold your place wherever god has set you to hold your place in that position wherever god has put you it might be i i don't know what it is but whatever god has desired to see you do in your life you should be good at it that's what brother branham said but uh i was also thinking of what brother thomas said the other day about he was talking about psalms 1 and uh well i can only speak for myself like i i hate to say that a lot but that's the truth i can only speak for myself as a young man you know serving the lord there were some things that uh an older man told me and one of those things is you have to apply the word of god every day in your life you got to go over it time and time again you have to take scripture and read and pray over it and try to apply it to your life and when god gives you the understanding or speaks to your heart and any portion of the scriptures then you you know it's subtle and i was thinking he was reading out of psalms the first chapter of psalms and as a young man i i memorized that psalm that first psalm and when i had difficulties with the men i was dealing with or people i was dealing with you know when you're kind of being pulled to go their way i would read that i would just meditate in that psalm and i would know that that's not god's intended way god wants you to be separate doesn't want you to you know people take separate as being that god's saying that god wants you to be different all the time that's not i don't take it that way but god wants you to separate yourself from the evil doesn't mean that you push people away but if they're doing things that are evil and you can't fellowship with that then sometimes you have to walk away and i know you young men and young women it's sometimes it's hard to walk away and turn the other direction because she it's in the nature of human beings to want to fellowship whether whether that's healthy for you or not but it hurts you when you have to leave people because they're doing things that you can't agree with doesn't change the fact that you still need to do that and one of the other chapters that are important for people is this second chapter here and peter it's one of the chapters when i was a young young man i memorized because in this chapter all the nuggets that you need as a christian to be successful and i am totally off the point this morning where i was gonna be this morning but i was also thinking when uh the world that we live in right now is trying to force you to accept a certain opinion and if you don't accept that opinion then you won't have any fellowship whether it's at work or whatever it is or you're either going to go their way or you're not going to go at all and as the time gets later and later each each day moves on we can see they're trying to force everyone into a certain direction and it's going to get harder for christians i think i i don't know when i can't say when but it's going to get harder each day for you to hold what you believe and to deal with people that don't have the same eye same reasoning or the same goal as you do uh the other thing he um without faith he was talking to the people in that day this is 1954. i wasn't even born yet and he was talking to the people that if you can't have simple faith for healing how are you going to have faith for our rapture or how are you going to have faith so you have to have simple faith to believe god's word to move into it and uh i was just thinking in the age that we live in it's that's the purpose of the age that we live in right now everything you you see out there in the world it's trying to take that zap that faith out of your heart and out of your life and if you if you fellowship with it too long in the wrong way you're not going to have any faith left but i'll i'll just read a few of these scriptures here in a second peter and it must be me but it seems pretty warm up here today uh i'll just read we're fire laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking and as newborn babes desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby you know it's really hard to grow as a christian when you have when you harbor malice towards your brother or you have it could be malice according at your employer or you there's something that your employer does that you you're angry with every day he goes on to say but so you have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming is unto a living stone disavowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious and you also are lively stones that are built up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable god by jesus christ wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold by laying zion a chief cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which are disobedient the stone which the builders disavow the same is made the head of the coroner i know i talk about this a lot that that stone jesus christ himself you know you're going to do two things either it's going to crush you one day or you're going to fall upon it and humble yourself before everyone here this morning including myself has to make that choice you're going to choose which way that stone affects you and your heart and in your life and he goes on to say the sound of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble that the word being disobeying we're on to they also were appointed but i'll finish with this ninth verse but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation of peculiar people that you shall show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light you know that the only thing i would finish with this morning not taking a lot of time here is everyone has a everyone has a place where god wants you to be whatever that position is and you have to fill that position in your life and i would encourage anyone if if you don't know what god intends for you don't don't be satisfied which is just miranda ring along in life reach out to what god has for you whatever that purpose is and hold on to it steve woke up sort of early this morning which isn't really unusual for me but it come on my heart about how thankful i mean i know it's this time of the month and i'm sure that's what started me thinking on it but you know every day we need to get up and the first thing we need to do is say thank you lord i don't care what circumstance you're in in life if he's allowed you to to face that circumstance he's right there with you you're not by yourself so let's just sing some songs this morning that talks about thankfulness i know the world's taking this week and turning it into a holiday season of thanksgiving which is way better than the one that we just celebrated uh i wish they would do away with that one totally but a lot of people spend a lot of money and time into halloween but that's that's just i have no use for it myself but either way let's uh let's start off saying and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear the word cause to me there's millions of people [Music] that might have heard bits and pieces they heard just enough to turn it against you know turn them against it because there's plenty of stuff on the internet and everything i can turn you against this word but i'm very thankful for being able to hear it and to receive it amen and i just want to thank you lord [Music] is [Music] [Applause] a face to face with [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] it's revealed to me [Music] thanks for that special life when a song [Music] let's take it one more time and i just wanna thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have [Music] thanks for that special [Music] a face to face with eternal life and lord [Music] amen you thank him this morning jesus thank you thank you lord for saving me thank you thank you lord for setting me free once i was lost now i found now my soul is heaven bound thank you thank you lord for saving [Music] oh me you thank you lord for saving me thank you thank you lord for setting me free once i was lost now my soul is heaven thank you [Music] [Music] there's a little song here it's well that's an old song through it all i know people sing it for specials and they sing i want to try to sing it congregation wise and i know everybody might sing it differently and i'm having trouble remembering it i mean i went over it this morning but hey you just need to be around me if you think i have trouble remembering i've had many tears and sorrows i've had questions for tomorrow [Music] but in every situation god gave through it all through it all i've learned to trust in jesus i learned to trust in god [Music]
