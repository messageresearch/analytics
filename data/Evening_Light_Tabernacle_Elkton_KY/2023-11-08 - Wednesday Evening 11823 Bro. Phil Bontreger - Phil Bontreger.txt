each Heart Lord Jesus I pray we ask you to come and have your way tonight I ask this amen God bless you this evening it's good to be back here to see everyone again hope everyone's doing wonderful getting ready for winter time is that good yeah I'm going to read out of Philippians the second chapter starting to the fifth verse be about four or five verses there some of you probably could quote this it's just very very well read and preached on Philippians 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God that means not something to be grasp at like oh I got to be equal with God I'm God but he said I'm going to let that go but made himself with no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death to the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and give a name which is above every name you can have a seat if you like tonight I want to speak on the saw it proving who you are proving who you are Jesus saw himself in the word as he grew up he recognized who he was and and and the Word was revealed to him more and more until he recognized what his purpose in life was yeah and he humbled himself to that purpose brother and sister every person who's in The Bride is going to come to a place where they recognize their purpose in this life and will humble yourself to that purpose and it takes humbling cuz most of the time a lot of the times it requires us doing something that we really don't want to do prefer I prefer not doing that God he said I didn't ask you I'm telling you right but now you have a choice to do it or not now if you don't do it you can be like join or run away but he's gonna get you he's gonna bring you back he said no no come on back I like how he said he being found in fashion as a man brother and sister we find our El we grow up we were fashioned as a man we recognize that oh my goodness look what kind of a person I am because the more you want to serve God the more you see how weak and evil and nasty that own nature is and how selfish and how it just wants to have its own way and we find oursel in a a fashion as a person fallen in a fallen condition and yet we want to serve God because something inside of us said but I want to be a Christian but I'm struggling to do it how do I go about this you do it the same way God did that Jesus did you find your purpose purpose and you find what he wants for you and you walk in that purpose and he will bring you to that place let this mind be in you which is in Jesus Christ what is that m not something I'm want to be something great I'm G to humble myself recognize that if he doesn't do the work in me it's not going to get done there's nothing I can do to make myself righteous I'm gonna have to depend solely on him and he's gonna promise to bring me through right second Thessalonians in 2 chapter Paul says he now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our Gathering Together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as at the day of Christ is at hand and so what I want to look at this is Paul is saying you need to know who you are so that you are not going to be shaken and troubled and distressed and worried because oh my goodness look around you look around you say we are in the midst of a hurricane here the whole world has gone insane and here we're sitting like in the eye of the needle and we're thinking what's going on going to happen what's going to happen next yeah that's right and you're right it has gone crazy and yet we have the front row sea watching scriptures being fulfilled in our name scriptures that were prophesied thousands of years ago and today you can look at them and say this is happening today have you noticed the anti-Semitism the whole world has gone against Israel they're supposed to United States we're going to turn against them sooner or later and when we do I don't want to be here please God that's right that's right but we're going to lead the way because right now we're the one thing that's holding now we'll still support Israel wait till we turn against them to everyone's going to fall into line I mean besides ones already there we're watching the scripture because every nation will come against Jerusalem friends it's happening right in front of our eyes you know something else that's happening the Antichrist spirit that the Antichrist that the image to the Beast is rising up and taking power have you seen who got elected to our speak Speaker of the House Mike Johnson best guy you could ask for he is a blatant Christian he's not ashamed of he's bold about his Christianity and he's sending I have got probably 20 emails from him support me in this we're going to turn America around we're gonna get American value Christian values back in place and I'm like yes yes let's go except you recognize that's the very image of the Beast rising up and Tak power in our government that's going to completely take over friends that's where it comes from it ain't the left right it's Iron Curtain I mean I'm sorry it's the purple curtain it's a Catholic it's that religious system is going to take over the government friend that the left brother BR said never fear communism fear romanism cath Catholicism they're the ones who worry about bid and his cronies ain't nothing they got nothing going on it's these other folks going to take control they're going to force the mark of the beast it's the Christians right we're watching that image of the Beast taking power right now in front of us yeah and the things we support that's why it's so deceptive support it from a distance don't get all took up into that next thing you know you're going to be in something you can't get out of and that something here we are watching these things happen and it's just this whipping around it's whipping around and right now we still got it easy naturally speaking Yeah because we can still come to church that's right not a person here probably wondered worried about am I going to get my next meal where am I getting my next meal no we got we got refrigerators we got food we got money we got all this stuff there's plenty of places around the world where Christians are literally being killed and tortured just because they're C I'm not talking about messy Believers to be a Baptist or Catholic or anything you can get killed they're suffering friends naturally we are not but it's coming so now is the time to get your stabilizers in now is the time to know who you are now is the time to get settled because if you're not settled now when that little bit of pressure comes against a soft living layer of sins Naturally Speaking yeah you're going to be crumbled who's going to stand if you knew that you come to church tonight there might be people protesters out there throwing rocks at you going in the door would you come to church that's right that's how it is what if they were going to put your face all over the newspaper tomorrow said look at these these uh patriarchal racist whatever they're going to call you yeah yeah and you go to work you go to school and your friends and your people look you know Cowarts looking at you are you part of that cult right you're getting fired from your job because they can't have people like you working there that's right who's still coming to church I'm I'm just gonna stream brother Thomas I stream coward yeah yeah where's your where's your persecution who are you standing for yes find out friends I'm not making this church a book you got to know who you are now you got to know who you are let me read what brother Bram said can we do that he said he's asking this question he says how many Christians are here raise up your hands all the Believers raise up your hands everywhere oh I suppose that's wonderful it looks like 100% so he's preaching to a bunch of Christians he said now if you're a Believer I believe that I know what the greatest curse that's on the church today it's not knowing what they are oh wow it's a curse because if you don't know who you are you don't know where you're standing you can't stand there because something comes along it's going to wash you right away it's going to blow you right over you need to know who you are where you're stand it has to do with placing and and adoption in your position in Christ he said you might you need to know that he said now with the help of God this afternoon I'm going to help you to place the believer positionally in Christ what his authority is in Christ these are things that we must know and brother and sister I hope we all do by this time yeah right but tonight we're going to look at this a little bit and see proving how do you know who you are how do you prove who you are he said now this this epistle the letter of Ephesians written to Believers not the outside world this is Believers that's why I brought this afternoon first I test and see if there's group of unbelievers and siners want speak it here he said now try hard Christians to understand that this day that the message has been placing the believer in positionally placed the whole message has been putting us in Christ placing us there so we know who we are so that when the storm comes against now by the way I said we have it easy I was talking naturally spiritually you're fighting the hardest battle that's ever been fought because what's going on is we have it so easy it's so easy just to kind of relax and take it easy because we got all the takes we got the Bibles we can pray we can do all this stuff so we get lazy we get laad isical and Satan hits us and hits us and his and some of the times we don't even realize that what are is considered our day to-day walk we are being hounded by demons and just like well this is just natural we don't even realize the thoughts that constantly pump our mind it's not normal other ages haven't had to put up with this like we do but we got it so easy and we don't even think about it and we just kind of get desensitized and we fight this battle we fight that we fight that and we don't even think about it but all the time oh sometime we think about it things get really rough don't get me wrong but so many times just go through I had a good day today why I only fought about 10,000 demons you don't even think about it but you did is positionally putting us in a place if every believer in here was in their place now I'm just going to break it's going to break it off a little bit if every believer knew their place he said the lady on a cot the man with the crutches along there there would not be a feeble person in this building in the next 20 minutes if every man could simply find his place his or her place in Christ Jesus what a difference it would make that is our inheritance that is Rapture and material that's what needs to happen friends because we're going to have to get to the place where you know you are to such a place because you have to have rapturing faith rapturing faith is greater than any of us have ever experienced yet friends because it's going to change its body but everyone has to have it because a little unbelief here it'll little unbelief there it's going to it's going to it's going to hinder it and so friends that's going to be gone either you're going to come to this place so you're going to be gone that's what the storm that squeeze that's coming it's going to squeeze some people right out the door it's going to squeeze the other people right up into a Rapture but you need to know who you are because otherwise you will be gone this ain't playing God's Not playing this Ain playing Church let's have a picnic let's go do this friends this is where it comes down to where you need to know who you are he he goes on he says now I know he said I felt your mind rolling fast he could tell what people were thinking he said now brother Brandon I know where I am you think you do see that's it if you did it would be different it would be different this is for all of us friends and nobody said well I got but figured out no one else does we're all coming to this place and this is one reason you didn't pray for your pastor more than anything else except Revelation because you can't get higher than him yeah he's leading the charge you make sure you hold him up before the Lord and keep those demons off so he bring the word to preach it to get you to this place because the way you're going to get here is by the preaching of the word is going to produce it yeah that's right amen he says little babies I got a little one back there just learned to walk he'd bump and fall down get back up he thought he was doing something great I was that way one time time but now I'm a man I put away childish things he said we got to come to full Doctrine I like good old shouting meetings where we just clap our hands and Shout have a good time have a wonderful service and the things dance on the bubble as it word but wait all right then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing just because you can shout and dance and have a wonderful service does not mean you know where you're standing it's the word friends it's the word brother here brother brand today he was talking about how the false ones can Pro produce the same signs as the real ones it's not the signs it's the word that tells the difference and when you know where you're standing you can stand on the word and be salad there and just because you and you might dance one time you might dance for another two years but it doesn't matter if you dash or not CU you know where you're standing you can't build your confidence because you danced and shouted and screamed and felt anointings that's no Foundation to stand on that's why so many people going to be deceived because that's what well I know I have it because I jumped and shouted in church so do frogs yes it is he said let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that get back to the foundation and see where you are I'm G I'm gonna turn to uh second Peter here real quick and read a little bit second Peter the first chapter just to save time I'm not going to read everything but he verse four says whereby are given un to us exceeding great and precious promis that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature have an escaped corruption that's in the world through us so he said these promises we are partakers of these promises which means you believe him and then when you believe him produces a new birth which is that divine nature and through that you escape the corruption then it goes on to say now besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and he goes through all these virtues that you need to add to your new birth once you're born again then you have to go through just add The Virtue add this the strength which comes through trials right that's right he says for in verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be baren nor fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but if he lack us these things liketh what the revelation of who you are and the these these virtues that are that are uh molded into you through your trials you go through he said if you lack these things you cannot see you're blind cannot see far off have forgotten you apprach from those sins verse 10 wherefor the rather brother give diligence to make your call and election sure for you to do these things you shall never fall what's he saying you got to make sure you're calling an election it's sure you got to make sure you know who you are now I got to ask you a question can you call yourself can you elect yourself then how do you make it sure what's he talking about because if you take this from a carinal perspective and I used to look at it this way I got to add all these virtues and I got to make my call election sure how am I supposed to go about doing that well I got to try really hard I had all diligence I got to make sure I have faith what come I my virtue I'm going to work on my Temperance I'm going to work on my no quit it you ever try to do that in your own strength try to make yourself a better person I'm gonna give myself character you give yourself a headache then what are you supposed to do how do you make your call election what he saying if you need to make sure you know where you're standing on the Revelation that God called you and he elected you and he told you that and so when anything comes against you you stand firm on that and say Satan I know where God put me I'm not getting off of here that's what he's talking about you make a call electure by knowing that it's been revealed to you who you are not CU you bubbled ass not because you felt an anointing not CU you had a baptism because Jesus Christ told you personally exactly who you are that's how you can stand there and friends when you can stand there then when you go through the trial you'll have the right attitude and it will for your your virtue and your Temperance and all this brother love it will mold that into you because you stand there with the right attitude knowing that this is for my good and nobody's gonna take this away from me and then you humble yourself and go to your cross you had the same mind in you that Jesus had he found himself in likeness of a man he humbled himself and you can do the same when you recognize who you are if you don't know who you are you're going to bail that trial you're going to have a bad attitude you're going to be impatient with drivers like I was today God have mercy and you're GNA like you're going to fail it and say well let's try this again bring me another bad driver oh feel got impatient again bring me mother bad driver are we're gonna get this right after a while some of you know what I'm talking about all you human beings do hey man it's true friends this is how it happens and how do I do it you know what humbles me down I recognize who I am yeah Phil this is for your good why don't you figure this out okay it's all about the attitude you take okay let it go yes and then Satan comes and says I thought you're a Christian if thou be the bride of Christ that's how it came to Jesus if thou be the Son of God change it you're hungry change the stones and if thou be the son of prove it to me that's right when I say proving who you are I am not talking about proving it to the devil who cares what he thinks about you you got nothing to prove that a liar if you could prove it he won't believe it anyways that's the spirit of this AG they look at the fact this is fact and they say I don't want to believe it that way I don't like it that way and they'll turn and believe something completely different because they just don't want to believe the fact that's what's going on in this world that's why the whole thing over there with Hamas and all that they going to look at the facts that I don't like the facts I'm going to believe something different that's he's exactly right Satan's the same way he's an author of that he don't he don't care what you prove he's gonna he's never gonna be satisfied if thou be the Son of God if thou be the most come down off the cross and prove it to us we'll worship you we'll believe you no they wouldn't have they find a reason not to because Christ can be flashed right in front of a person's face today I'm talking about they look right at you and all they see is some old body of person they say well I don't see any difference in you oh yeah you're a little different but I I'm satisfied with my religion I'm satisfied and a tradition veils and from seeing it brother B says this the holy spirit makes every movement like Christ it'll make you Christlike the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions emtions our emotions he's supposed to we're supposed to Humble ourselves so he controls our emotions so when I get impatient in traffic I like surrender relax and he comes and takes over and says Phil it's okay it's okay you're gonna get there three seconds later than you would have got there if you you yeah is and when you look at it from that perspective it's like man Phil you are an idiot but that's the way we do we get tore up about oh he said something she said something about me oh my goodness do you did do you think of oh my and we get all this stuff and thoughts go you ever you ever dve down the road and a thought comes and you start wondering if that really happened or not and then you start dwelling on it and next something that never it's just it's just ridiculous and that's the way Satan fights us because our minds are are weak yes the prophet told us our minds are weak he said if our bodies are not weak and our brains our minds being coming week two yeah sat knows what he's doing yes our emotion not so much jumping up and down you could do that as shindig will bring that to you but the Holy Spirit brings you into operation or in control of God that you walk in peace amen yeah we can walk in peace in the midst of this world friends we can walk in peace the Holy Spirit humble ourselves and let the Holy Spirit take control we can have an inner peace while our mind is on fire our bodies are are tore up and all this stuff go whipping around but we can turn inside and find out there's peace in there all he wants to do is say I got you covered will you just allow me to have control here and I'll give you some peace but the reason we don't have peace we're so tore up we're worried we're stressed because we're trying to control a situation every time we worry it's because we want to try to control the situ situation we want to know how God is going to do this how you going to hand this God are you sure you got this are you sure you got this I don't know what oh my goodness got all this going on yeah that's right I'm I'm I'm I've probably done this before I like doing this it just really gets the point across if I done it before just ignore me for a minute I'm I'm gonna pick on my sister over here right yeah I'm G get her back for all those years she picked on me so so she noticed is there in the back porch of the house little water there's a little leak in the ceiling she says Steve I think we got a leak on the roof he look say yeah looks like it she said we need to get it fixed he said yeah I'll get to it when when you going to do it honey I'll get to it okay but it's leaking yeah right there but it needs to be fixed I know and tomorrow well whenever I get to it I got other things that's on my list I'll get to it well when is it when are you going to get what if it what if it storms what if I have a blood comes what if it just floods the whole house oh my goodness we might lose a whole house when are you going to fix this you ever you ever approach God that way oh but this is this is terrible this something bad could happen oh my goodness let's catastrophize everything so he says honey do you believe me I believe you okay that night in bed honey are you sleeping I can't sleep why not there's a little there's a leak on the roof that's me and God that's me yeah God you said I know you said you heal me I don't see anything happening yet yeah well you poor weak little wannabe that's right just believe what he said amen just believe he's going to take care of it did he not say he take care of it yes he did then what are you worried about well when oh now you got to put a time limit on him yeah yeah this is human nature friends this is what we all fight I hope you all know what I'm talking about if you're way past this and you just let the rest of us catch up okay he said he said uh you walk in peace and in love and in Joy with longsuffering goodness meekness gentle patient you see it isn't something that you do that's the key to the whole message tonight it isn't something that you do it's something the Holy Spirit does in you you see Hallelujah you don't prove nothing you don't have to prove anything to anybody when I say proving who you are it ain't you proving it it's him proving who you are he vindicates at who you are take your hands off the wheel and let him drive the car quit trying to prove you're a Christian quit trying to prove that you're a bride quit trying to prove all this stuff because you're just falling in Satan's trap well I got to live good enough to be bright I got to do this to be bride I got no you need to stand on your election that God told you you are elect and you say I will stand here and let him do all those he promised to do that's what he's asking for not for you to go and prove who you are on you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's a subconscious movement of the Holy Spirit oh I wish I could shout the Praises of God around the world to that that's right it says subconscious something just naturally comes yeah and the more we can get out of the way the more naturally it would live our out you said I just want to wish I love more I love more I want to love more the only thing that's keeping I'm talking about you Christians born again the only thing that's keeping you is your own self being in the way the love is in there it was in there it was came to life when you're born again the love of God is there to love everyone just the same way Jesus loved people and it's there for your for your enjoyment if you would just quit your own stuff yeah and what keeps love is when you're protecting yourself Jesus showed the greatest love when he completely quit protecting himself he didn't want to Jesus did want to but he said okay I'm G spread my arms and take it I'm gonna love everybody and what keeps me from expressing love is when you might hurt me amen when you said something to hurt my feelings when you did something that I didn't like when I'm holding a grudge anything like that that's what keeps love from manifesting itself talking about the love of God something else that keeps it is our human love yeah because our human love gets in the way of God's love especially when it comes to family and we're ready to compromise we're ready to do something maybe to make exception because well that's my family that's my family come on right sometime you got to have that tough love and say yeah you're my son you're my daughter but listen this is the word of God right here we're gonna stand on the word daddy you just don't love me one day you'll see one day you'll see I think being a parent today is the hardest job the world to do it right I when I train where I work you know we we take care of kids I tell the people there I said being a good parent is extremely difficult there's so many influences on the kids and right here it is this is a gate to hell not I'm not saying get rid of it I'm saying control it if you can't control it get rid of it till you can all right boy Ione PL of saying that that's all right thank you let's keep going here all right we're going to look at Ephesians a little bit and brother bradam he was pre preaching out of Ephesians positionally placed in the church he said Ephesians parallels Joshua in that Joshua took the children of Israel and he placed and he gave their inheritance in the promised land remember that was the type of the Holy Ghost and so now Ephesians it plac the the Born Again Believers in Christ tells us who we are it tells us our inheritance tells us what we have and so we're going to read through here a little bit but before we do when brother Brandon was preaching this he says this a little bit more water all right he says now watch this Matt now I'm gonna do this read this and then I'm go back and talk we're going to read through Ephesians what what brother BR was talking about okay watch this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of Falling Away right amen you're not going to fall away friends what did it say when you make your call in election sure you will not fall keep you from falling that means falling you don't make mistakes but he's not going to fall away when you think you're going to fall you're going to find out you're standing on a rock you can't get off that rock it's already been sealed so he says you're not going to fall away quit have quit allowing Satan to give you that heart to whip on your mind and say you're not bride you're not bride if you're a bride you w be done if you're bride you would have done that those thoughts you having you know that's not yeah yeah I don't see it I just don't see you being bride you better just go for Plan B maybe you can get foolish virgin that yeah you're not gonna make it he doesn't know the future friends that's right you ever have him trying to get you to be afraid of what might happen yes yeah this might happen that might happen that he don't know the future he don't got no crystal ball right he doesn't know well this is probably going to happen to you this is probably gon to happen to you this oh shut up one of my favorite quotes lately brother Bram says this Satan come hang on a second I love saying this Satan comes to you he says let me tell you what I'm gonna do you ain't gonna do nothing that's right that's the way you talk to him yeah well s comes and says I tell you what I'm gonna do you turn to him say you ain't gon to do nothing he Brother Brad said that's the way we need to talk to the devil he ain't going to do nothing he said well I'm going to cause this and I'm going to cause that you ain't going to do nothing the only thing he can do is what my father allows you to do you servant boy you ain't nothing come on don't be afraid to talk to him like oh what if he comes against he's supposed to if he ain't coming against you hard and in hatred then you're in a wrong place he should hate you with all his might you're his destruction you're the thing that's keeping him from getting back to Heaven you're you're the one who's going to see kick him off into that place out there where he don't want to be friends we are the ones who we are there's utter destruction you're sitting here this this evening and he's out there and he's going crazy he's roaring like a li but he got no teeth why because he cannot get to the bride of Christ but but bad things happen for of course bad things happen we're human beings y That's right so he comes said you know if you know bad things going to happen if you keep being a Christian have you seen the unbelievers out there you think they're living a life of ease look at the bad things that are happening out there the difference is when bad things happen to us we have a resource their resource likes to see them suffer he likes to inflict pain our our resource allows it to happen no one is going to mold character into you that's going to make you what you need to be yes you're going to suffer one way or the other you might as well suffer for Christ why why suffer for the devil just to go out and enjoy a few minutes of miserable pleasure all right he said knock all that idea out of being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm Gone the next to Gody condemn me the next day I'm back again that's nonsense he said now who want I'm going skip down a little bit just to save time okay so Paul addresses to the saints that are called and preserved in our field the Holy Spirit are already in canaan's land this is who he's talking to when we read Ephesians if you're not there yet friends you got to get there there's no time to wait if God's moving on your heart at all the least little inkling give it to him say God I want this whatever this is I want something I gotta have something more that's all you get tonight well then Sunday morning it might be to little inkling and you just keep holding on to that and keep believing and keep believing what he's telling you and one day you're going to be this place where you say I know where I'm at because God has revealed to me that I have been elect oh by the way you didn't become elect you always were elect you were elect from before the foundation of the world you're going to be elect End of Time Eternity other way through you always were elect you always will be elect you can't keep from being elect and you didn't elect yourself Jesus Christ elected you he said I want you and I want you and I'mma put my seed in you and I'm going to make you what I want you to be and stop trying to prove to the devil who you are just start worshiping me let me prove who you [Applause] are he said don't be scared of nothing for he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are how you're standing that's why he's talking about the Ephesians Paul he's going to tell you where you're at who you are and where you're standing amen oh he says now remember I'm not talking to those outside of Christ I'm talking to those who are in Christ and how do you get in there baptized by one Spirit into the body this is for believers I'm going to read from Ephesians the first chapter start the third verse remember friends this is for believers now when I'm reading through this I want you to read recognize what he's asking you to do we want to recognize what he's doing and then we want to recognize what he's asking you to do okay so keep that in mind verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ blessed us with all spiritual blessings according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so he chose us that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so he right away he tells you you are holy and Without Blame before him Jude I think 24 says to him who is able to keep you from falling amen what a scripture am he did not say go ahead and keep yourself from falling he said he can keep you from falling boy you get that Revelation it'll set you free verse five having predestinated us un the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself so he predestinated that means determined it's already been decided what's going to happen you're going to be adopted amen that means not only you are born again but you're placed in your position in the body it's already been predestinated friends you're going to be there if you're not some of you are there right now if you're not there you're going to get there it's already been determined that's more sure than you determine that you're going to drive home tonight after church thousand things could happen to stop that nothing's going to stop this amen amen according to the good pleasure of his will he didn't say about your will it's his will that he does this for you so far what does he ask you to do nothing right he's done it all so far yeah remember this is placing you in the body to the praise of the glory of his grace it ain't my grace it's his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved he made you accepted he did this you didn't live good enough to be accepted you didn't believe enough to be accepted he made you accepted Accord to his grace friends I'm I'm going have to get Sidetrack I got time okay have you noticed that the the more you go on Christ the more grace you have amen I could look back 10 15 20 years ago and how judgmental I was if someone didn't believe it the way I believe oh they're off yeah send them to hell yeah they don't believe it the way I see it right that's ridiculous if everyone of us are not growing in Christ and seeing more more light than we died way back there the last time we saw any more light yeah brother Brandon his own Ministry you can see he saw more light and more light all the way up to the seals that's right he even said he said he said if you watch the tapes they get pler and planer what's that going showing Christ more plain revealing him more and more and brother and sister if I see someone who didn't see things the way I did I don't see things the way I did back then either so if I can grow how come he can't grow how come she can't grow of course she can we're all grown and you know what even if they don't see it the way I do I'm not the judge anyway you're still my brother and you're still my sister and go you know we're gonna all come to the right place and I I'm tired of being judgmental I'm tired of trying well this person see it this way and I hear so much around the message friends I have you he about that Pastor he beli well have about that sister she what about this just just they're not your servant right you didn't call them that's right you don't know where they're at individually we're going to get to that here in a second individual walk let me get back on CH verse seven in whom we have Redemption through his blood not through our works his blood he did it the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had to bound towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known to us the mystery of his will the mystery of his will this is what brother BR said he said the mystery of his will he's preaching adoption he said now it's not just a little thing it's a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for him or herself it's God's mystery he say what is this mystery of his will that's between you and God it's an individual walk it's not a group it's not a denomination it's not well we all believe it this way we believe this way we are all in our individual walk we see you know different different levels of our character development we see this little this Revelation this person sees it here and I you this brother might have a revelation he had it for 10 years I might not get it for five more years and all of a sudden that quickens to me but I see something he don't see and it just goes with it because it's all it's individual we're all not like step by step we're all walking our own pathway and let just go ahead and encourage other to keep going instead of trying to say see do you measure up with me do you measure up with me who cares don't be comparing yourself to other people compare yourself to the Holy Spirit The Mystery of his will is for you an individual in your life personally he has made it known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which Heath purposed in himself his pleasure purposes and in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him brother and sister we are at the fullness of time it's about ready to gather all things in heaven and all things in Earth together and we're going to get out of here [Applause] yeah in whom we also have obtained an inheritance give yourself an inheritance have you done that I think I'm gonna give I'm gonna inherit something what can I give myself you can't give yourself an inheritance someone has to give it to you yeah he's predestinated you to have an inheritance The Inheritance is this word off the page living in here that's the life of Christ that is Christ that is your inheritance that's his will for your life however that works out in your life but your inheritance is Jesus Christ himself my what what more could a person want we have an attain inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work all things after the counil is his own will it's his will is his Cel it's his inheritance is his predestination his grace it's his love it's his blood is his forgiveness now we find out what he wants from us that we should be to the trust of his GL who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation that's all he's asking you you've heard the gospel of TR the word of Truth The Gospel your salvation he said now trust me all these things that I said please believe me trust me that I'm doing this yes in whom also after that ye believed that's what he wants you hear the preaching of the word you hear the word and you believe and you trust him he's going to do this and you believe in that rock that's a faith that's a rock you're standing on and that's all he's asking us to do amen Trust and believe that's how you prove who you are because there's something inside that rock this rocked hard it's Can't Be Moved it's that election it's that Revelation and that is your proof because Satan can't get you to fall away from that he's doing everything else everything else yes trust me sister Becky I'm gonna fix the roof trust me it's that simple that's why that's why he makes it so everyone no no you don't have to be smart you don't have to be educated you don't have to have all this this knowledge of the message you don't have to have you know oh I've read all the the the the messages I read the Bible four times I've done all this I Pray no no no no no trust this is what I'm doing believe it yes it's the hardest thing for a human being to do is just let go yeah let go take your hand off the wheel there you go lord it's like driving your car down the road and he's your co-pilot you know what you're doing every tree yeah but if I trust him to drive I might have a wreck have you seen your car yeah that's right you do nothing but wreck when you're driving it yes that's right get out of the seat switch seats let him drive and don't be a backseat Drive driver he don't need you to tell him how just go along for the right it's too simple isn't it it's just too simple that that that's I'm I'm convinced of this the message believers who missed the Rapture couldn't get simple enough yes they had to figure something out they had to have some sensation they had to have something that they could do they had to be something well the way I sing the way I I preach the way I pray you know it's something that I can throw into it that could get simple enough just to drop down and say I trust you I believe you yes and your word here you place in me right here I know where I am I've been predestinated I've been adopted I've been forgiven all these things this is where I am in Christ tonight because you did it all and then he wraps it up after you believed you sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise sealed away can't get out oh my sealed you recognize when you're sealed you can't no one can break that seal right then what are we worried about what are we stressing about well what about my kids what about this what about that what about that that's just Satan trying to get you to lose your peace of mind that's right brother B says this for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear oh wonder if I can just hold out oh if I can just hold out you ever feel that way if I can just hold out to the Rapture just just hold out he said hold out nothing it ain't whether I held out it's whether he held out I'm in him now well will you say well I if I'm in him now you Presbyterian say oh we always believe that but your life proves that you're not unless you walk the kind of life that he walked you believe the same gospel he preached and if you're trying to hold out is because you're not walking the right kind of life you're not seeing enough Christ in you he said I just got to hold on just try hard I got to try to overcome this I just got to try to overcome this I just got to try to over there we go friends there we go but you have to overcome yes you do have to overcome how do you go about it trust and believe yes he said he said he's already done this for you he's got you in the body all that Holiness he's he he gave you Holiness before him and and all these things he already promised this is what he sees and we're still struggling well I got to do this no brother friends you just got to believe what he said but it's a battle of course it's a battle because in spite of all the evidence Satan brings against you you stand there on the word and say yeah but I still believe the promise I was prayed for I give this to the Lord and I Stumble and fall stumble and fall but I know one day I'm going to stumble and fall for the last time because I have a promise has placed me in the body and I can't get out the Lord amen amen oh my let me read read you one more quote and I'm G be done here L church church brother Ram says remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages that even as Adam and Eve fell before because they left the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the World Church system system we know that has happened the World Church system has turned completely over to the image of the Beast or the Beast itself there's no light anymore there's not the leot Dean age ends in the blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stand stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little Hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus short and Powerful demonstration when that third pull comes into effect full effect and you're going to see the bride do exploits what does that look like having a clue I don't even worry about it how much is that going on right now it could be happening right now as far as the what we're defeating the devil and all kinds of is that what it is is going to be something more than that I don't know and neither does anybody else so don't let anyone try to talk you well this is the way it's going to happen no you don't know every time we figure out what God's going to do we get it wrong every single time how we know he's gonna do it but how he goes about it Nobody Knows by word about it because all I know I know I'm in that group that's what I have to do I know I'm in that group so when we get we get hunted we get persecuted we get whatever happens that storm runs right across this blowing us all over friends if you know who you are right you broke that curse amen of not knowing what you are amen you know you're part of the body of Christ and then you can stand built on a rock thank you Jesus and nothing can [Music] stop amen amen God is good God good I say this all the time I said what will you do if what what would you do if you weren't a Christian yeah what would you do if you didn't have peace if you didn't have something to rock to to be solid on something to hold you because you look all the way around the world and we see everything going the way it is ah what would you do where would you go I'd be insane just like they are yeah just like they are and me it's good it's good to be a Christian God bless you I just want encourage you just keep pressing the battle friends you got to know who you are and if there's any question find out it's only one person can tell you your pastor can't tell you your mom or dad can't tell you one person can give you Revelation the prophet himself couldn't give you Revelation it only comes through Jesus Christ get a hold of him find out and even if you know who you are be strengthened in it I'm just I'm just we're too close to the end to get discouraged now amen the hardest battles are still ahead of us but we're really close to the end so he's going to take us Lord Jes Jesus we're so thankful that you would come and encourage us tonight Lord I pray that this word would just bury itself into our hearts Lord Jesus and bring forth much fruit Lord Jesus let it come up let it be watered with praise and worship and Faith Lord Jesus we just ask that you would come now father and just watch over us as we leave from here before we do we could wish worship you a little bit if you would just
