[55:40] that finds their place their blessings
[55:42] Lord our blessings don't rest on the
[55:44] outside of the promised land but it
[55:46] rests in the land of promise Lord the
[55:49] last time I was here we spoke upon
[55:51] footprints in the land of promise and
[55:53] Lord I believe today you're coming back
[55:54] to kind of speak to us along those same
[55:57] lines again today God we want to be a
[55:59] people who's blessed but not our
[56:01] blessings of wealth and prosperity but
[56:03] blessed by the word of God blessed in
[56:05] the word of God blessed because Lord
[56:08] you've sent us a message in this hour
[56:10] which we have received father and we
[56:12] just pray God that you would just keep
[56:13] your hands upon us you see every hand
[56:16] that was lifted every heart and I ask
[56:18] today God that you'd meet the need of
[56:20] the believer Lord and may you forgive us
[56:22] where we fail you and may you just take
[56:24] control of this service for we ask it
[56:26] all
[56:26] this morning in the precious name of
[56:28] your son Jesus Christ amen if you have
[56:30] your Bibles this morning I'm going to
[56:33] have you look here at habach uh chapter
[56:36] 2 and verse two we're not going to have
[56:38] a lengthy scripture reading we're going
[56:39] to look at chapter 2 verse two and verse
[56:42] three and I want to speak to you on the
[56:44] vision is
[56:47] speaking so we look here where's Gideon
[56:49] my my buddy Gideon at this morning is he
[56:53] here oh man well you send him my
[56:56] greetings tell them I'm still eating on
[56:58] the Tic Tacs he gave me they've been a
[57:01] blessing we man every time we go to
[57:03] church pull a little pack out and take
[57:04] it in well I know you're not supposed to
[57:06] eat candy in church but got to have
[57:08] something right well you just send my
[57:11] greetings to Gideon thank you all right
[57:13] so we look here habac at 2 and verse two
[57:15] and it says and the Lord answered me and
[57:17] said write the vision and make it plain
[57:19] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[57:23] it for the vision is yet for an
[57:25] appointed time but at the end it shall
[57:27] speak and lie not though it t wait for
[57:30] it because it shall surely come it will
[57:33] not t God bless you you can have your
[57:36] seats this
[57:37] morning like I said I want to speak to
[57:39] you I've been on a series back home and
[57:42] on living in the hour of fulfillment and
[57:44] I believe if you're cognizant of our
[57:47] political systems and world world
[57:50] systems and looking around looking at
[57:52] Israel and different things playing out
[57:54] you can see that we're living in that
[57:56] hour of final fulfillment where God is
[57:58] about to take home a bride and Life as
[58:01] we know it as civilization is coming to
[58:03] an end and there's going to be a a a
[58:05] Rapture for the body of Christ and we're
[58:07] going to live in an eternal reign with
[58:09] him but we find here it lays out in the
[58:12] word this morning and I want to speak to
[58:14] you on the vision is speaking because I
[58:16] believe that this Bible that we read
[58:18] daily is a vision of God I believe
[58:21] everything that's laid in here that
[58:23] pertains to the body that pertains to
[58:25] the bride of Christ will be manifested
[58:28] it will come forth just the way God
[58:31] plans it to it may not come according to
[58:33] your idea it may not come According to
[58:36] some other man's idea but it will be uh
[58:39] uh it will come to manifestation
[58:41] according to the plan of God according
[58:44] to the way God designed it and purposed
[58:46] it so we find here in the back of the
[58:48] scripture says write division otherwise
[58:51] don't just speak it brother Brad but
[58:53] write it down so Generations after
[58:55] Generations after Generations can come
[58:57] back to that word come back to that
[58:59] vision and Trust the vision that it will
[59:03] not car it will surely come to
[59:07] pass come on church so we got a promise
[59:10] we can come back to this same word not
[59:13] tainted with Man Hands not some man's
[59:16] idea not some Creed not some church
[59:18] entity but we can come back to the same
[59:21] word of God and believe that this word
[59:24] he said write it down for generations
[59:27] and generations not to the first
[59:29] generation only but to the generation
[59:32] that's living in the leot to see and age
[59:34] you can come back to the same word and
[59:37] have the same promise had the same
[59:39] outpouring have the same Revelation oh
[59:41] praise God this morning it's the same
[59:44] and though the vision
[59:46] T oh though it car wa for it for it
[59:50] shall surely come to pass it shall
[59:53] surely begin to speak
[59:57] do you believe that this
[59:59] morning so let's just slow down for a
[1:00:01] minute this is one of my teaching
[1:00:04] series don't you laugh you think huh he
[1:00:08] ain't teaching I'm not much of a teacher
[1:00:10] I'm a preacher right but we look at this
[1:00:13] word Vision it means an oracle it means
[1:00:16] a prophecy Divine
[1:00:19] communication a dream of
[1:00:21] Revelation and when you look here it
[1:00:23] says the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:00:28] time a lot of things we think of that we
[1:00:30] want it instantly we live in a microwave
[1:00:35] age you know back I'mma tell my age now
[1:00:40] about 26 years ago how many of you
[1:00:42] remember 2.8
[1:00:45] KBS none of y'all that's dial
[1:00:48] up see y'all don't even remember that
[1:00:51] some of you youngsters you're like KBS
[1:00:53] what in the world is he talking about
[1:00:56] kilobytes per second you wait and you
[1:00:58] hear
[1:01:00] that it's dialing up and finally you get
[1:01:03] connected well today it's
[1:01:05] instant well we got 300
[1:01:09] megabytes come on Church let's work with
[1:01:12] me a little bit this morning but we find
[1:01:14] it's for an appointed
[1:01:17] time so the vision may not be for right
[1:01:21] now but there's an appointed time that
[1:01:23] that vision is going to manifest itself
[1:01:25] it says but at the end it shall
[1:01:29] speak and lie not though it ter way for
[1:01:32] it so we find the word vision is an
[1:01:34] oracle Divine communication a dream and
[1:01:37] though it tar there's an appointed time
[1:01:42] just like every individual has an
[1:01:44] appointed time that they come and meet
[1:01:47] God you can't shove it down their throat
[1:01:49] you can try as much as you can you know
[1:01:52] we heard the old cliche you can lead a
[1:01:53] horse to water but you can't make them
[1:01:55] drink but you let that horse get thirsty
[1:01:57] enough he'll begin to drink let me tell
[1:02:00] you you let that Son of God who's been
[1:02:02] drifting and wavered he be drifted long
[1:02:05] enough and his life becomes a living
[1:02:07] hell he'll be reminded that there's
[1:02:09] promises in the word he'll come and take
[1:02:11] a drink of it you won't have to force
[1:02:13] him you won't have to make him because
[1:02:15] at the appointed time if there is a seed
[1:02:18] on the inside that seed has to come to
[1:02:21] manifestation that seed has to come and
[1:02:23] take a drink of the word of God
[1:02:27] so I don't get all worked up cuz my
[1:02:29] family some of my family members are not
[1:02:31] serving the lord I just wait on
[1:02:33] God cuz God gave the
[1:02:36] promise and some of you mothers and
[1:02:38] fathers that have wayward children don't
[1:02:40] don't be
[1:02:41] distressed because the Bible gives you a
[1:02:44] prophecy it gives you a word that they
[1:02:46] and their
[1:02:47] offspring shall be there let me tell you
[1:02:50] I would pray without ceasing for that
[1:02:53] Offspring and though it ter wait for it
[1:02:55] for it cuzz it shall
[1:02:58] speak and this word speak here means to
[1:03:01] breathe out to come to pass so just
[1:03:04] going to kind of look at this and lay
[1:03:05] the foundation this morning for the
[1:03:07] vision is yet for an appointed time and
[1:03:11] though he speaking it right now it's not
[1:03:13] going to be expressed or manifested for
[1:03:16] a distance time off in the future and we
[1:03:20] find here but at the end notice when
[1:03:22] this period appointed by God shall come
[1:03:24] it shall be accomplish it shall not
[1:03:27] disappoint the
[1:03:29] expectation now we have been given a
[1:03:31] prophecy regarding the end time we have
[1:03:34] had a Prophet come on the scene and tell
[1:03:36] us the things in which we should be
[1:03:38] looking for come on Church notice we're
[1:03:41] not like denominal Believers we're not
[1:03:43] like Sinners out there who's threatening
[1:03:45] and stressing and worried about chaos
[1:03:47] all around us we've had a Prophet come
[1:03:50] and show us the things that are coming
[1:03:52] the vision has spoken in this day and we
[1:03:54] can sit back with ease why because we
[1:03:57] know the outcome we know before the
[1:03:59] first bomb Falls this bride is going up
[1:04:02] Hallelujah this morning we don't have a
[1:04:04] reason to fret we don't have a reason to
[1:04:07] worry and to be fretful we have given a
[1:04:11] vision and it will speak
[1:04:15] church and it is
[1:04:17] speaking notice so the event that is
[1:04:20] habca saying here though the vision T it
[1:04:24] will speak or breathe for forth or it
[1:04:26] will come to
[1:04:28] pass and so it terries we're warned now
[1:04:32] and that's the thing I got we got to
[1:04:33] think about because a lot of times we're
[1:04:34] like What happens in the delay so many
[1:04:39] people because the Lord seems to have
[1:04:40] delayed his coming and we see things
[1:04:43] around us we're thinking well why isn't
[1:04:45] he come why didn't he come why didn't he
[1:04:46] come because that's part of the
[1:04:49] process cuz we're worn now you notice
[1:04:52] we're worn way back in AA
[1:04:56] though it t though it
[1:04:59] delay oh don't get comfortable in the
[1:05:02] delay well you're starting to do things
[1:05:04] you shouldn't in the delay you get soft
[1:05:07] in the delay you're not serving God like
[1:05:10] you should in the delay well you know if
[1:05:12] it's going to be it's going to be and
[1:05:13] you know you know if God comes I I guess
[1:05:15] CNN will put it on there they'll
[1:05:17] broadcast it for several weeks before he
[1:05:19] comes it ain't going to be like that God
[1:05:22] is looking for somebody who's earnestly
[1:05:25] desired ing his coming every day every
[1:05:28] day when you wake up you begin to pray
[1:05:30] oh God come today may this be the day
[1:05:33] may this be the hour may my children
[1:05:35] find you Lord may they surrender
[1:05:37] everything to you Lord may this be the
[1:05:40] time that our bodies are changed and
[1:05:42] we're going
[1:05:45] home
[1:05:46] Hallelujah though it Terry wait for
[1:05:50] it you know that's a hard thing for some
[1:05:53] of us man you miss that d up remember
[1:05:56] when you used to click the button
[1:05:57] brother Joe and it
[1:05:59] turn 2.8 or 28 KBS something like it was
[1:06:03] slow you sitting there waiting you go
[1:06:05] fix you a pot of coffee and finally you
[1:06:07] get back and then all of a sudden woo I
[1:06:10] got internet I'm
[1:06:13] connected now you're always connected
[1:06:16] come on hope you see the type now we're
[1:06:18] always connected this ain't waiting for
[1:06:20] some preacher to find some quote but but
[1:06:23] now we got the entire message at our
[1:06:25] fingertip we're always
[1:06:28] connected oh Hallelujah so we find here
[1:06:32] that the scriptures can have a compound
[1:06:34] meaning and I hope you don't mind I'm
[1:06:36] taking my time this
[1:06:37] morning brother Thomas when you get
[1:06:39] tired of me preaching you just come up
[1:06:40] here and pull my coat say all right
[1:06:42] brother Joe you're
[1:06:43] done we only have one service back home
[1:06:46] on
[1:06:47] Sunday and let me tell you it's a
[1:06:49] service and so we just follow the leader
[1:06:52] I've been taught by the best but I'm not
[1:06:55] going to try to hold you too long but
[1:06:56] notice now scriptures can have a
[1:06:58] compound meaning that mean it can have a
[1:07:00] natural occurrence and also a spiritual
[1:07:04] occurrence okay the natural can take
[1:07:06] place and manifest long before the
[1:07:10] spiritual so we look here in the book of
[1:07:12] habac and he's talking about the vision
[1:07:15] and he's talking about the destruction
[1:07:16] of the Babylons who are coming into
[1:07:18] there and and and back at his concern
[1:07:20] Lord you're allowing these people to
[1:07:21] come in and they're raping and they're
[1:07:23] pillaging and they're stealing and
[1:07:24] they're doing how how long are you going
[1:07:26] to allow this to continue where one man
[1:07:28] comes in and he goes out and they take
[1:07:30] destroy another nation and they take all
[1:07:32] their goods and they they take
[1:07:33] everything from him just to cast his
[1:07:35] neck back out and repeat the process and
[1:07:38] God is telling him there will be a time
[1:07:41] that I deal with the unbeliever there
[1:07:43] will be a time that I deal with Babylon
[1:07:46] there will be a time that I deal with
[1:07:48] the child is there will be a time but
[1:07:50] until that time you keep waiting for the
[1:07:53] vision to
[1:07:54] come so God begins to speak to him
[1:07:57] regarding the word regarding the time in
[1:07:59] which he's living and notice we find
[1:08:02] this compound meaning being played out
[1:08:05] are the compound scriptures being played
[1:08:07] out in the Book of Daniel now you go to
[1:08:09] Daniel 9 and we look here and it says
[1:08:11] now in the first year of Darius the son
[1:08:13] of hazaras the seeds of the M which was
[1:08:17] made King over the real of the Chans in
[1:08:20] the first year of his Reign I Daniel
[1:08:23] understood by the books So Daniel begin
[1:08:26] to study the books begin to look back at
[1:08:30] what his predecessors had said he wasn't
[1:08:33] looking the books of Dr James doson he
[1:08:36] wasn't looking at the books of some
[1:08:38] preacher on the street he was going back
[1:08:40] into the prophecies he was going back
[1:08:43] into to seeing what the prophets before
[1:08:45] him what they had wrote down in the word
[1:08:48] of
[1:08:49] God I Daniel understood by the books the
[1:08:53] number of years whereof the word of the
[1:08:56] Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that
[1:08:58] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:09:01] desolation of Jerusalem so we find
[1:09:03] Daniel going back to Jeremiah's
[1:09:06] prophecy because he wanted to see when
[1:09:09] is this 70 years are going to play out
[1:09:12] when does it start when does it end so
[1:09:16] we notice now Israel at this time or
[1:09:18] Daniel here there's 70 years natural
[1:09:22] then there's also the 70 years spiritual
[1:09:26] the 70 weeks of Daniel and you play that
[1:09:29] out it's and we're close to the end of
[1:09:32] the 70
[1:09:33] weeks if you had listened to the 70
[1:09:35] weeks of Daniel I would encourage you go
[1:09:37] back now they don't pertain to the bride
[1:09:40] we'll get into that a little bit here
[1:09:41] this morning they don't pertain to us
[1:09:44] but they tell you exactly where we are
[1:09:45] in a
[1:09:46] timeline you know when I first became a
[1:09:49] Christian and and came to this message I
[1:09:51] read the 70 weeks of Daniel y'all
[1:09:53] remember the green book this Daniel 70
[1:09:55] weeks
[1:09:55] man I put that book down it's like this
[1:09:57] is way over my little head like boy My
[1:10:00] Little peon brain couldn't understand
[1:10:02] that and I have avoided it for 20s
[1:10:04] something years but just here in the
[1:10:05] last several months I begin to to to
[1:10:07] study it and and go through it and go
[1:10:09] through it and go through it and my
[1:10:11] brother Brad the Revelation just begins
[1:10:13] to expound yet it doesn't pertain to the
[1:10:16] bride but we understand Israel is the
[1:10:19] time piece God distinguished at
[1:10:22] appointed time that Israel that he would
[1:10:24] pour out judgment upon her captives and
[1:10:27] bring her back into the homeland of the
[1:10:29] world and if we can watch Israel church
[1:10:32] we can also see when our homine when
[1:10:34] we're going back to our homeland in a
[1:10:36] spiritual union with the bride of Jesus
[1:10:38] Christ or with the groom himself let me
[1:10:40] tell you you put your eyes on Israel
[1:10:43] watch Israel because when you watch her
[1:10:45] you're watching yourself leave
[1:10:47] here so we find Daniel begins to look
[1:10:51] back at Jeremiah's prophecies
[1:10:55] and we're going to go to Jeremiah
[1:10:57] Jeremiah 25 and verse
[1:10:59] 7 I'm GNA try to slow this down I keep
[1:11:01] saying that but this is just too good
[1:11:03] not to
[1:11:07] preach all right that's two of you how
[1:11:08] about the rest of you come on that's two
[1:11:11] of you with me how about the rest of you
[1:11:14] I heard y'all had an outstanding service
[1:11:15] Wednesday night let's have another one
[1:11:16] this
[1:11:17] morning notice here in Jeremiah
[1:11:20] 25 yet you have not hearkened unto me
[1:11:23] sayeth the Lord that you might provoke
[1:11:25] me to anger with the works of your hands
[1:11:28] to your own hurt therefore thus sayith
[1:11:31] the Lord of hosts because you have not
[1:11:32] heard my words now they've heard the
[1:11:35] words but they didn't hear the words
[1:11:37] does that make sense this morning cuz
[1:11:39] some of you sitting right here this
[1:11:41] morning you're hearing the word but are
[1:11:42] you hearing the word you're hearing a
[1:11:46] voice speak but are you hearing the
[1:11:48] voice behind the voice speak so every
[1:11:51] service you come has got to be more than
[1:11:53] just brother Brad it's got to be be more
[1:11:55] than brother just brother Thomas it's
[1:11:57] got to be more than that human voice but
[1:11:59] you're hearing the inspiration in which
[1:12:01] God laid it upon their hearts to speak a
[1:12:04] message that's when you're hearing the
[1:12:06] voice of God and you're hearing the word
[1:12:09] of God but here we find they didn't hear
[1:12:12] the words of God oh they heard the words
[1:12:15] of a prophet but they didn't hear the
[1:12:17] voice behind
[1:12:19] it therefore thus sayith the Lord of
[1:12:22] host because you have not heard my words
[1:12:26] behold I will s and take all the
[1:12:28] families of the north sayeth the Lord
[1:12:30] and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[1:12:32] my servant and I will bring them against
[1:12:35] this land and against the inhabitants
[1:12:37] thereof against all these nations round
[1:12:40] about and I will utterly destroy them
[1:12:42] and make them an astonishment and a
[1:12:45] hissing and a Perpetual desolation
[1:12:47] moreover I will take from them notice
[1:12:50] what he's going to take away from them
[1:12:52] to me I thought this was very very very
[1:12:55] profound I'm going to take away the
[1:12:56] voice of myr and the voice of
[1:12:59] gladness man when you ain't got the Lord
[1:13:01] you ain't got no
[1:13:03] happiness the voice of M your life
[1:13:06] stinks I'm going to take the way the
[1:13:08] voice of my the voice of gladness the
[1:13:10] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[1:13:13] the Bride are all
[1:13:16] removed because they did what they
[1:13:19] didn't hear the voice of God they didn't
[1:13:21] hear the words of God and the sound of
[1:13:23] the millstones and the light of the
[1:13:24] candle otherwise he's removing the light
[1:13:26] out of their midst there would be no
[1:13:28] progress there be no work the sound of
[1:13:30] the millstones are grinding the way they
[1:13:31] make their living all these things he's
[1:13:33] pulling them he's telling them I'm about
[1:13:35] to come
[1:13:36] in I'm sending Nebuchadnezzar I'm
[1:13:39] sending in your enemy to come in because
[1:13:42] you turned yourself away from my
[1:13:45] Commandments and it says in verse 11 and
[1:13:48] this whole land shall be a desolation
[1:13:51] and an astonishment and these nations
[1:13:53] Shall Serve the king of Bon 70 years and
[1:13:58] it shall come to pass when the 70 years
[1:14:00] are accomplished that I will punish the
[1:14:03] king of Babylon and the nation and that
[1:14:06] Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
[1:14:08] in the land of the Chans and I will make
[1:14:10] it a Perpetual desolation and I will
[1:14:13] bring upon that land all my words which
[1:14:15] I have pronounced against it even all
[1:14:18] that is written in this book which
[1:14:19] Jeremiah ha prophesied against all the
[1:14:21] nations for Many Nations and great Kings
[1:14:24] shall serve themselves of them also and
[1:14:27] I will recompense them according to
[1:14:29] their deeds and according to the works
[1:14:31] of their hands for thus sayeth the Lord
[1:14:33] that after the 70 years be accomplished
[1:14:36] at Babylon I will visit you and perform
[1:14:40] my good word toward you and causing you
[1:14:44] to return back to this
[1:14:48] place so there's a promise God's laying
[1:14:50] out here in the book of Jeremiah look
[1:14:53] because you didn't hear and because
[1:14:55] notice what it says now because you
[1:14:57] didn't hearken unto me sayeth the Lord
[1:14:59] that you provoke me to anger you
[1:15:01] wouldn't hear my word I'm going to allow
[1:15:04] your enemies to come in and bring you
[1:15:07] into
[1:15:08] exile to hold you
[1:15:11] captive so we find Israel was exiled or
[1:15:15] taken captive by the Babylonians in King
[1:15:17] Nebuchadnezzar due to their Disobedience
[1:15:20] to the Lord and we think we can be
[1:15:23] disobedient and get by with
[1:15:26] it but notice there's a set period of
[1:15:33] time there's a set period of there's
[1:15:36] only 70 years in which Babylon has the
[1:15:40] opportunity to work there's only 70
[1:15:44] years that they had to remain captive to
[1:15:46] the Babylonians in King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:49] so we find here Daniel wanted to know he
[1:15:52] goes back to Jeremiah's prophecy to find
[1:15:55] when will that time be accomplished not
[1:15:58] only the time regarding God pouring out
[1:16:01] his wrath on Nebuchadnezzar and the
[1:16:03] Babylonian Kingdom but also the time
[1:16:06] when God is going to take the Jews who's
[1:16:09] been dispersed throughout the lands and
[1:16:11] take them back to the Homeland that they
[1:16:14] belong to notice God will never bless
[1:16:17] the Jew until he's in his homeland and
[1:16:20] God will never bless the bride until
[1:16:23] she's in the Homeland
[1:16:27] so notice there's a prophecy that's
[1:16:29] going forth there is a set time after
[1:16:32] the 70 years brother Tommy God is going
[1:16:35] to take the Jews and take them back to
[1:16:37] their Homeland back to where he can pour
[1:16:40] out his Spirit back to where they can be
[1:16:42] blessed back to where they can multiply
[1:16:45] put them back into the homeland of the
[1:16:47] land of
[1:16:49] Palestine it's a prophecy it tells him
[1:16:52] that they're not going to remain slaves
[1:16:53] indefinitely
[1:16:55] and let me tell you you're not going to
[1:16:57] remain a slave indefinitely your
[1:16:59] children will not remain a slave
[1:17:01] indefinitely devil only has a period of
[1:17:04] time but at the time appointed
[1:17:06] Hallelujah God is going to move and God
[1:17:08] is going to draw people back to the
[1:17:12] Homeland
[1:17:15] Hallelujah see they'll return home he's
[1:17:19] promised they're going to return home
[1:17:21] return to their native land return to
[1:17:23] the Homeland the land that they were
[1:17:25] taken
[1:17:27] from and we notice here that after the
[1:17:30] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I
[1:17:33] will visit
[1:17:35] you so we find even in that day in
[1:17:38] Jeremiah's day it wasn't about Jeremiah
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] prophet come on
[1:17:44] church but he says I will visit
[1:17:48] you I'm going to visit your family I'm
[1:17:51] going to visit your youth I'm going to
[1:17:53] visit your old I'm going I'm going to
[1:17:55] visit your churches I'm going to visit
[1:17:56] your huge camps I will visit you at the
[1:17:59] time appointed let me tell you we're
[1:18:01] living in the appointed time we're
[1:18:04] living in the hour of fulfillment where
[1:18:07] God is about to wrap this entire thing
[1:18:09] up and there will be a bride and she
[1:18:12] will go home with him and though the
[1:18:14] prophecy T it will speak and I'm going
[1:18:17] to go ahead and tell you this morning it
[1:18:20] is
[1:18:21] speaking to those that are listening
[1:18:25] it is
[1:18:27] speaking well you say well brother
[1:18:30] Joe I'm blessed you know God never did
[1:18:33] bless Israel I'm just going to get
[1:18:36] comfortable well in a minute these
[1:18:39] little T-Rex arms I
[1:18:41] got notice God never did bless Israel as
[1:18:45] long as she was outside of her
[1:18:47] Homeland and God will never bless you
[1:18:50] outside of the homeland of this word oh
[1:18:53] you may be successful
[1:18:55] you may make lots of money you may have
[1:18:58] nice things live in a nice house you
[1:19:00] know wear the nicest clothing that's all
[1:19:02] fine and dandy let me just tell you what
[1:19:03] your Prophet said he said and so has our
[1:19:06] modern T Trend today falling away from
[1:19:09] the things of God and has brought the
[1:19:11] world to one of the greatest idoles that
[1:19:14] we have listen to one of the greatest
[1:19:16] idoles that we have and that's
[1:19:19] idleness we got young men playing Xbox
[1:19:22] more than we got young men reading the
[1:19:24] word of God God they so consumed on
[1:19:27] their video games and they don't even
[1:19:28] know how to be a man let me tell you
[1:19:31] when I was 78 n 10 years old I wasn't
[1:19:34] out there working in the field don't get
[1:19:36] me wrong H not having that but I wasn't
[1:19:39] playing video games man I was out there
[1:19:42] fishing riding four-wheelers doing
[1:19:44] things working on them doing it myself L
[1:19:46] to learn doing all this stuff we were
[1:19:48] poor so you had to do stuff yourself if
[1:19:49] you want to get something done but I
[1:19:51] wasn't at home occupying my time on
[1:19:53] video games like we see these young kids
[1:19:55] today we got young boys young married
[1:19:57] men 25 26 spend all their time can't
[1:20:01] hold down a job because they're too
[1:20:03] worried about getting caught up on their
[1:20:05] video game playing against their
[1:20:07] friends losing their jobs over a video
[1:20:12] game I don't know how the word I got
[1:20:14] here but notice idleness there it is he
[1:20:17] said just idling around great is the
[1:20:19] iniquity of the people today making
[1:20:21] plenty of money and think that's God's
[1:20:23] blessing us because he's prospered us he
[1:20:26] said that's no sign of God's blessing
[1:20:29] not at
[1:20:31] all he says what we need today is not a
[1:20:35] lot of material
[1:20:36] things he says we have that we don't
[1:20:39] need greater churches we don't need
[1:20:42] greater congregations we don't need more
[1:20:44] on the radio and on television we don't
[1:20:47] need so many more of these things but
[1:20:49] what we need today listen up Church what
[1:20:51] we need today to be spiritual is a
[1:20:54] person that will humble themselves
[1:20:56] before God if they haven't got a penny
[1:20:58] and will pray till that Spirit within
[1:21:00] them is satisfied with the goodness of
[1:21:02] God and a Revival takes place let me
[1:21:06] tell you you may have drove up in a
[1:21:07] hoote this morning but you can get into
[1:21:09] the presence of God and begin to pray
[1:21:12] and begin to call down the anointing and
[1:21:14] a revival can take place and even like
[1:21:17] El in Kentucky let me tell you what are
[1:21:19] we waiting for what are we waiting on we
[1:21:22] don't need the president to drive when
[1:21:25] God has got Vindicated Believers in our
[1:21:27] midst this
[1:21:29] morning we don't need fancy cars in the
[1:21:31] driveway we got what we need right here
[1:21:35] Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:21:36] humble theel and say I need you this
[1:21:38] morning Lord I want more of you this
[1:21:40] morning I want to hear the voice of
[1:21:45] god notice if you haven't got a
[1:21:49] penny there ain't many of you here this
[1:21:52] morning that ain't got a penny but we
[1:21:54] pass pass a little tent this morning had
[1:21:56] a 70- year old man in a wheelchair in
[1:22:00] it and a 70y old lady sleeping in a tent
[1:22:05] on the side of the
[1:22:06] road what would they give for what
[1:22:09] you're listening to this
[1:22:12] morning look goes notice if they haven't
[1:22:15] got a penny and will pray to the spirit
[1:22:17] within them is satisfied with the
[1:22:19] goodness of God and a Revival takes
[1:22:21] place on the inside of their heart that
[1:22:24] changes their attitudes in the
[1:22:25] atmosphere that we live in now let me
[1:22:28] ask you how many of you are praying for
[1:22:31] Revival well I got one I got two I got
[1:22:35] three my goodness y'all scared of
[1:22:38] Revival I'm I'm going to ask it again
[1:22:40] it's not a trick question not tricky at
[1:22:45] all do are we
[1:22:48] okay how many of you this morning are
[1:22:51] praying be honest I started start seeing
[1:22:55] some hand slide up I ain't even finished
[1:22:56] the question yet how many of you are
[1:22:58] praying for a
[1:23:00] Revival come
[1:23:01] on how many you praying for your own
[1:23:06] Revival that's better how many you
[1:23:08] praying for Revival for your church how
[1:23:11] many you praying for Revival for your
[1:23:12] young people oh that should be our
[1:23:15] desire see praying for Revival get into
[1:23:19] the atmosphere you ain't got to let the
[1:23:21] preacher do it all let me tell you the
[1:23:24] creature is just part of the work let me
[1:23:26] tell you the greatest outpouring of the
[1:23:28] supernatural takes place right there in
[1:23:30] those pews when you begin to have a need
[1:23:33] and begin to call on God and begin to
[1:23:35] respond back to the word and then the
[1:23:37] Lord comes back and speaks to you then
[1:23:39] the Revival begins to change then the
[1:23:41] atmosphere in the church begin to change
[1:23:44] then the atmosphere in the home begins
[1:23:46] to change and then you come into the
[1:23:48] house of God expecting to hear from God
[1:23:51] that's what causes a Revival that's what
[1:23:53] causes a stir in the hearts and lives
[1:23:57] but many time we see the outpouring at
[1:23:59] other
[1:24:00] churches well they can have it there we
[1:24:03] can't no let me don't you take that
[1:24:06] attitude this morning no sir what they
[1:24:09] have there we can have here come on
[1:24:12] Church what they have there we can have
[1:24:14] here what we had last week and even like
[1:24:16] men you can have it and even like El
[1:24:19] because God is the same yesterday today
[1:24:22] and forever it the people will humble
[1:24:26] themselves if the people will go to
[1:24:28] crying out to
[1:24:30] God God can pour out his
[1:24:33] spirit and I will say God will pour out
[1:24:36] his
[1:24:38] Spirit Ain about about who has this and
[1:24:42] how much we
[1:24:43] have I tell my children we're blessed
[1:24:47] absolutely we have been blessed we live
[1:24:49] in a nice house like none of us wearing
[1:24:52] Rags you know we drive decent vehicles
[1:24:56] but if God took it all away I still
[1:24:58] serve
[1:24:59] them cuz I know what he's done for me
[1:25:02] brother Joe I know what I used to be and
[1:25:04] I know what I am now and I'm going to
[1:25:06] tell you the Baptist Church didn't do it
[1:25:08] the Pentecostal Church didn't do it the
[1:25:10] method this church didn't do it but God
[1:25:12] sent me a
[1:25:13] messenger God sent me a prophet and oh
[1:25:16] let me tell you I had to do some
[1:25:17] humbling brother Tommy to receive it but
[1:25:19] when I humble myself down it ain't about
[1:25:21] money it ain't about what I have what I
[1:25:24] have not it's about getting into into
[1:25:25] the presence of the Living God and
[1:25:28] letting that word change me and change
[1:25:30] my
[1:25:33] desires so what we want today we want
[1:25:36] the blessings of
[1:25:39] God this is where we raise our hands

[1:27:50] offering I'm not asking you take up
[1:27:52] another offering don't don't go there
[1:27:55] I'm just reminded of the little story a
[1:27:57] little boy and his dad come in church
[1:27:59] Brother
[1:28:01] Brad you know and the dad they sat
[1:28:04] there and little boy's getting happy
[1:28:07] he's enjoying what he's hearing and Dad
[1:28:10] just you know he dropped a little dime
[1:28:12] in the Ser in the offering plate and
[1:28:15] when he got up and left brother Joe he
[1:28:17] took his dime back out of off from plate
[1:28:20] y'all heard this
[1:28:21] story I ain't never heard it
[1:28:24] okay and the son looks up at his dad as
[1:28:27] he reaches in and grabs that dime back
[1:28:29] and the son looks at him said Daddy he
[1:28:31] goes you would have got more out of the
[1:28:33] service if you would have put more into
[1:28:36] it said you would have got more out of
[1:28:38] the service if you would put more into
[1:28:41] what am I telling you this morning if
[1:28:43] you want a move of the spirit if you
[1:28:45] want a Revival if you want the voice of
[1:28:47] God to come and speak to put more in the
[1:28:49] service put more into the worship put
[1:28:52] more into it you can come your hands you
[1:28:55] can shout amen you can say glory to God
[1:28:57] put more into it and you'll get a
[1:29:00] blessing out of
[1:29:02] it we want the blessings of God
[1:29:05] therefore we must invest into the
[1:29:08] promises of God and believe the word of
[1:29:13] God
[1:29:15] notice now let's go back to my my topic
[1:29:19] that was all off
[1:29:21] topic Genesis 15
[1:29:25] Verse 18 God
[1:29:28] promised God promised Israel a little
[1:29:31] piece of
[1:29:34] property
[1:29:36] brother Carson put that first picture up
[1:29:39] God promised Israel I don't know where
[1:29:41] your slides are oh
[1:29:43] mercy anybody find Israel in this
[1:29:46] picture you don't really see it but you
[1:29:48] see you see
[1:29:51] Africa you see Saudi Arabia you see Iraq
[1:29:55] you see Iran you see Syria but man God
[1:30:01] promised Israel a little piece of
[1:30:04] property let's look at his Genesis 15
[1:30:06] and verse 16 keep that up says now in
[1:30:09] the same day that the Lord made a
[1:30:10] covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed
[1:30:13] have I given this land and God's
[1:30:17] promised a land for his chosen people
[1:30:19] that's right notice now from the river
[1:30:22] of Egypt unto the Great River the river
[1:30:24] Euphrates the kenites the kenites the
[1:30:26] catamites the Hittites the perizzites
[1:30:29] the reims and the amorites the
[1:30:31] Canaanites the gites and the jebusites
[1:30:33] so we see here the total state of Israel
[1:30:37] total land mass of Israel is
[1:30:40] 8,630 square miles let's go to the next
[1:30:43] picture and bring this up a little bit
[1:30:45] closer now Israel is starting a form
[1:30:48] here you can see it but also you see
[1:30:50] Egypt on the left you see Jordan on the
[1:30:53] right you see Syria up to the Northeast
[1:30:55] you see Lebanon right there directly in
[1:30:57] North so you see she's just a little
[1:31:00] sliver of
[1:31:02] land I'm going somewhere with
[1:31:04] this see Israel is roughly the same size
[1:31:09] of New
[1:31:10] Jersey now when you look at the map of
[1:31:12] the United States New Jersey is right up
[1:31:15] here next to New York some of y'all that
[1:31:17] don't know that it's little bitty New
[1:31:20] Jersey Connecticut Rhode Island they're
[1:31:22] all right there very small little pieces
[1:31:25] of land and we notice here the country
[1:31:27] is bordered by Lebanon to the north
[1:31:30] Syria to the Northeast Jordan to the
[1:31:32] east Egypt to the Southwest the med the
[1:31:34] Mediterranean Sea to the west and notice
[1:31:37] now here also it's full of mountains and
[1:31:40] plains and fertile land and the desert
[1:31:42] they're often just few minutes apart so
[1:31:44] we look here go to the next slide now
[1:31:47] we're getting a little bit closer next
[1:31:49] slide now we see this is a little bit
[1:31:52] better picture and we find from Gaza
[1:31:55] right there all the way to the east if
[1:31:57] you go east you can cross Israel at its
[1:32:00] widest Mark in 90
[1:32:04] minutes it took us almost an hour to get
[1:32:07] here from the the place we were staying
[1:32:08] I'm not telling y'all where I was
[1:32:09] staying because I was on a little bit of
[1:32:12] pleasure this week but we find at their
[1:32:14] widest mark it takes 90 minutes and from
[1:32:18] the very top of Israel up there by the
[1:32:19] Golan Heights by Lebanon to the very
[1:32:21] bottom down here by taba way down here
[1:32:25] at the very bottom it takes nine hours
[1:32:27] to go from top to bottom with traffic so
[1:32:30] Israel is a very small piece of land but
[1:32:34] yet God had promised The Chosen you can
[1:32:37] turn that off I'm done with that slide
[1:32:38] but God had promised Israel I'm going to
[1:32:41] give you a special land and notice God
[1:32:44] done all the research God knows what
[1:32:46] lays in the land we find here the Bible
[1:32:49] would tell us in Exodus 3 and ver8 I've
[1:32:51] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:32:53] land of the Egyptians and to bring them
[1:32:55] up out of that land unto a good
[1:32:59] land notice it's a good land and a large
[1:33:05] land large put that slide back up one
[1:33:08] more time the last one or put the very
[1:33:10] first one up this is a large land I mean
[1:33:15] you can't even find it on the map but
[1:33:19] yet God oh come on church God has
[1:33:22] already spoke over the land he's already
[1:33:24] pre planned the land he's already
[1:33:26] predestinated that Israel will dwell in
[1:33:29] this little sliver of land that takes
[1:33:32] you a mere 90 minutes to cross and 9
[1:33:35] hours to go up and down but yet it was a
[1:33:37] land that God chose that God picked out
[1:33:40] and that God said I'll bless you if you
[1:33:42] stay in that land I'll take you out of
[1:33:44] Egypt I'll take you out of the foreign
[1:33:46] lands oh and I'll place you right here
[1:33:49] and I'll bless you in that land it was
[1:33:52] also a land described is Flowing with
[1:33:54] milk and
[1:33:56] honey you know what milk and honey
[1:33:59] represents that's the diet of
[1:34:03] Kings oh he's telling you I'm going to
[1:34:06] give you the best of the best if you
[1:34:08] stay in the
[1:34:10] land but we find here due to Israel's
[1:34:15] Disobedience they begin to be dispersed
[1:34:17] and I got to speed up cuz I'm taking a
[1:34:19] lot of time here but I'm enjoying myself
[1:34:21] so we find that there is what we call
[1:34:24] the Jewish dispora how many have ever
[1:34:26] heard of
[1:34:27] that okay we're going to have to get
[1:34:29] y'all connected to civilization up here
[1:34:31] in
[1:34:34] Elton praise God we finally got internet
[1:34:36] it's a church we're making progress
[1:34:39] little by little we're going to get
[1:34:40] there but so they got what we call the
[1:34:43] Jewish dispora or the Jewish Exile it's
[1:34:45] a dis dispersion of the Israelites or
[1:34:47] the Jews out of their ancient ancestral
[1:34:50] Homeland and we notice the first exile
[1:34:53] took place was an Assyrian Exile in 733
[1:34:57] BC before Christ the second Exile was in
[1:35:01] uh 597 by Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:35:05] and what it is is they come in because
[1:35:07] of their Disobedience to God and they
[1:35:09] came in and dispersed them and pushed
[1:35:11] them out of their Homeland or pulled
[1:35:13] them out of their Homeland and drugged
[1:35:15] them and made them captives and slaves
[1:35:17] in other lands that didn't belong to
[1:35:19] them so we find Daniel 70 weeks is going
[1:35:22] back to the disp
[1:35:24] and say there's only going to be a
[1:35:25] window of time there's only going to be
[1:35:27] an allotment of time that I'm going to
[1:35:29] allow Babylon and that I'm going to
[1:35:30] allow these other nations to come
[1:35:32] against you but at the end of that time
[1:35:34] I'm going to return you home oh come on
[1:35:38] oh hope you're seeing it this morning
[1:35:40] and what God does for natural Israel he
[1:35:43] does for Spiritual Israel what God's
[1:35:45] done for them he's doing also for the
[1:35:47] bride there's only going to be a short
[1:35:49] window where I'm going to let you be
[1:35:51] dispersed
[1:35:54] thank you Lord notice
[1:35:56] now so the Jews just as the Jews were
[1:35:59] dispersed from their Homeland for more
[1:36:01] than
[1:36:02] 2500 years they were dispersed
[1:36:07] 2500 years scattered throughout Arab
[1:36:11] Nations Egypt the European countries the
[1:36:14] true bride of Christ has been dispersed
[1:36:17] from the homeland of the word for seven
[1:36:20] Church ages
[1:36:23] where was she founded Brother Brad at
[1:36:26] Pentecost God gave her
[1:36:28] Pentecost as her Homeland it's more than
[1:36:32] just Supernatural it's more than just
[1:36:33] signs and wonders it's the reveal word
[1:36:36] of God God said this is your Homeland

[1:36:42] Nai and cancel they organized it and
[1:36:44] took it into Catholicism and then a few
[1:36:46] years after that they begin to be
[1:36:48] dispersed in the Baptist and the
[1:36:50] Methodist and the Pentecostal and all
[1:36:52] these other foreign land but God said I
[1:36:54] will bless you in the homeland of the
[1:36:57] word that's where our blessings lie it

[1:38:14] of you were out there in those foreign
[1:38:17] lands some of you I myself was in a
[1:38:20] Baptist
[1:38:21] Church drifting trying to find the truth
[1:38:25] because there was something on the
[1:38:26] inside said you don't belong there I
[1:38:29] left the Baptist went to the Methodist
[1:38:32] good Lord I surely didn't belong there
[1:38:34] went there went to the Pentecostal now
[1:38:37] it's getting more my speed I like a
[1:38:39] little bit that jumping I don't mind a
[1:38:40] little shouting in church I like to feel
[1:38:43] the Holy Ghost all right I won't Jance
[1:38:46] for you that be all right I'll keep
[1:38:47] myself under control but it was getting
[1:38:49] closer because God was leading me out of
[1:38:52] the foreign land just like he led many
[1:38:55] of you out of those far lands of
[1:38:56] denominations and he brought you to the
[1:38:58] homeland of the word of God he brought
[1:39:00] you where he can bless you and that
[1:39:02] blessing ain't with money that blessing
[1:39:04] ain't with property that blessing ain't
[1:39:05] with natural things that's a spiritual
[1:39:07] blessing where he's going to change your
[1:39:09] heart change your desires fill you with
[1:39:11] the Holy Ghost and when they come back
[1:39:13] and change your body and take you to a
[1:39:15] wedding supper that's the blessings that
[1:39:17] lay in the word that's the blessings
[1:39:20] promised to the bride but I'll only
[1:39:22] bless you when you're in the word of God
[1:39:25] I'm not going to bless you looking like
[1:39:26] the world I'm not going to bless you
[1:39:28] playing with the world I will bless you
[1:39:30] in the word of
[1:39:34] God I hope this is okay this
[1:39:38] morning notice now let's keep
[1:39:41] going so there's a promise he said I
[1:39:45] will restore saith the Lord so there's a
[1:39:50] promise of restoration for natural
[1:39:52] Israel there's also a promise of
[1:39:54] restoration for Spiritual Israel and see
[1:39:58] there would be a restoration of the
[1:40:00] Bride tree now she' been ate down by
[1:40:02] these four bugs and we understand Joel
[1:40:05] said I will restore all the years that
[1:40:10] set
[1:40:11] time some of you may have still been at
[1:40:14] on done killed your joy and un killed
[1:40:16] your fellowship un killed you enjoying
[1:40:19] coming to the house of God God's got a
[1:40:21] promise over you I'm going to restore it
[1:40:24] oh you can't wait I'm going to restore
[1:40:26] you you ain't going to wait till the
[1:40:27] doors of the the church open up you'd be
[1:40:29] glad to go into the house of the
[1:40:31] Lord but we find here God promised he's
[1:40:34] going to restore people and elect a
[1:40:36] called out group back to the original
[1:40:38] word back to Pentecost don't be afraid
[1:40:41] of
[1:40:44] Pentecost I ain't talking about AO of
[1:40:46] Pentecost I'm not talking about the the
[1:40:48] nomination Pentecost but don't you be
[1:40:51] afraid of the signs and wers don't you
[1:40:54] be afraid of the supernatural don't you
[1:40:57] be afraid of the word cuz at Pentecost
[1:41:00] they had the word of God and let me tell
[1:41:03] you if we got the restored word
[1:41:05] shouldn't we also have the restored
[1:41:07] power shouldn't we have the restored
[1:41:09] SIDS shouldn't we have the restored
[1:41:11] wonders shouldn't it be in our midst
[1:41:14] what are we ashamed of
[1:41:17] then I'm not ashamed of Pentecost cuz I
[1:41:21] know where I stand on this word by the
[1:41:22] message of the hour but notice in
[1:41:24] Ephesians 5: 27 God promised that he's
[1:41:27] going to present to himself a glorious
[1:41:30] church not having a spot or wrink or any
[1:41:33] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:41:36] without blemish and as God began to deal
[1:41:39] with the
[1:41:40] Jews I'm going to show you something
[1:41:42] here maybe it went over your head maybe
[1:41:44] you never thought about this but the
[1:41:45] Lord laid this on my heart when I began
[1:41:47] to study this out God be to deal with
[1:41:49] the Jews right at the end of the first
[1:41:52] World War
[1:41:53] 1914 to 1918 was the first world war
[1:41:58] then he also be to move on the Jews
[1:42:00] again in the 1930s and the
[1:42:02] 1940s so God is beginning Brother Brad
[1:42:05] to deal with the Jews because now he's
[1:42:08] saying this end of those 70 years that
[1:42:10] Daniel PR that Jeremiah prophesied has
[1:42:13] to come to pass I gave them a promise
[1:42:17] I'm not only going to deal with their
[1:42:18] captiv and those kingdoms that came
[1:42:20] against them but I'm also going to
[1:42:21] restore them back to the homeland of the
[1:42:24] word they had been dispersed they had
[1:42:27] been scattered theyve not been blessed
[1:42:30] oh they may have prospered and they may
[1:42:31] have been wealthy and they may have been
[1:42:33] great businessmen and women and things
[1:42:34] of that nature but their true blessings
[1:42:37] doesn't lie outside of the promised land
[1:42:40] so God be to deal with the Jews in the
[1:42:43] early 1900s and what happened at that
[1:42:46] time in 1909 can anybody tell me what
[1:42:50] happened a prophet was born
[1:42:55] so God is Not only dealing with natural
[1:42:58] Israel now he begins to raise up a
[1:43:01] Ministry he begin to raise up a prophet
[1:43:04] in the end time around the same time
[1:43:07] that would do what that would gusher in
[1:43:09] the bride back to her
[1:43:11] Homeland so we find 1909 William Brandon
[1:43:14] was born 1933 at the age of 24 he
[1:43:17] preaches his first message and in the
[1:43:20] same year 1933 he had said seven
[1:43:23] continuous Visions regarding the end
[1:43:26] time
[1:43:28] 1936 brandom Tabernacle was built 1946
[1:43:33] we move ahead 10 years he' received an
[1:43:35] Angelic visitation on May 7th 1946 that
[1:43:38] commission him with the worldwide
[1:43:41] Ministry and launching his campaigning
[1:43:43] career in the mid 1946 so we find in
[1:43:47] 1946 he's commissioned now to go around
[1:43:50] the world
[1:43:53] oh I hope you're seeing something here
[1:43:56] 1947 we had the first recording of
[1:43:59] William bram's message faith is the
[1:44:01] substance so what is happening here a
[1:44:03] prophet is coming on the scene to Usher
[1:44:06] the elect away from Creeds and dogmas
[1:44:09] and restore her back to the Vindicated
[1:44:13] word 1962 we move forward a lot so let's
[1:44:17] move forward real quick 1962 62 toward
[1:44:21] the end of brother branham's Ministry we
[1:44:23] begin to see a lot of things begin to
[1:44:25] plan begin to play out just like we did
[1:44:28] in 1940s with the Jews what God was
[1:44:30] doing there we find 1962 he preaches the
[1:44:33] restoration of the brid tree showing
[1:44:35] she's got to be restored 1962 he
[1:44:38] preaches why am I against organized
[1:44:40] religion see organized religion is
[1:44:42] foreign lands to a Believer it's not
[1:44:44] where you
[1:44:45] belong 1962 he preaches is this the sign
[1:44:49] of the end sir see he's looking to see
[1:44:51] we're close it's all about to come to
[1:44:54] fulfillment and he's preaching that 1963
[1:44:57] he preaches the way of a true Prophet
[1:44:59] because a true Prophet is going to stay
[1:45:00] with the word of God then we also in
[1:45:03] 1961 or 62 I believe 61 he preaches a
[1:45:06] true sign that's overlooked because a
[1:45:08] prophet is that sign that's been
[1:45:10] overlooked for generations and
[1:45:11] generations oh Church don't you see that
[1:45:14] God has opened your eyes to what he's
[1:45:15] doing in this hour because it shows that
[1:45:17] you're not part of those out there in
[1:45:19] Exile but you're the ones that are
[1:45:21] coming home back to the land back to
[1:45:23] where he can pour out his blessings upon
[1:45:25] you oh he should excite you this morning
[1:45:27] to realize you're not forgotten and he's
[1:45:29] not forsaken you but he sent you a
[1:45:31] message to bring you back into the
[1:45:33] homeland of the
[1:45:36] word notice 1963 he preaches God hiding
[1:45:40] himself in
[1:45:43] Simplicity and see if you all you saw
[1:45:45] was a prophet you didn't see
[1:45:47] God God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:45:51] simple oh me simple o you simple oh you
[1:45:54] simple oh you God hiding himself in
[1:45:59] Simplicity oh this is
[1:46:02] awesome I'm trying to show you you're
[1:46:04] not out there in those foreign lands
[1:46:05] God's bringing us home notice now this
[1:46:08] is at the same time he's dealing with
[1:46:09] the Jews so then we find in 1963 the
[1:46:13] seals become
[1:46:16] open the seals become open and the
[1:46:18] prophet of God said the Bible became a
[1:46:21] new book
[1:46:24] oh now when he looked into the word he
[1:46:27] saw it the way he'd never seen it before
[1:46:30] all the loose sins that men had probed
[1:46:32] at through generations and generations
[1:46:35] now it took a prophet and he tied those
[1:46:37] loose sins up and now we are the
[1:46:40] recipients of a great and wonderful
[1:46:43] message it's a message of restoration oh
[1:46:46] not Reformation but restoration we are
[1:46:48] going back to the H land of the word of
[1:46:51] God the seal have been open the book has
[1:46:54] become a new book it's a land church
[1:46:56] that's promised to us this
[1:47:00] morning notice 1963 the uniting time and
[1:47:06] sign oh I could go there with this but
[1:47:08] I'm G hold it for just one more sermon
[1:47:10] title then we got 1963 the
[1:47:14] token outside of the opening of The
[1:47:16] Seven Seals the most ordained message
[1:47:18] that I ever preached that's your Prophet
[1:47:21] so what is a token the very life literal
[1:47:25] as he said the literal Life of Christ
[1:47:28] coming and tabernacling your
[1:47:33] Humanity oh you talking about a
[1:47:36] blessing because it come from the
[1:47:39] word he broke the seals off of them now
[1:47:41] he's said oh your home every gate around
[1:47:44] Israel now they're destroyed you can go
[1:47:46] back to the homeland of the word so we
[1:47:49] find here the token then 63 Christ The
[1:47:52] Mystery of God revealed but if you pay
[1:47:54] attention he also speaks in Christ The
[1:47:56] Mystery of God revealed that the bride
[1:47:58] is the mystery of Christ
[1:48:01] revealed she is him oh man that's just
[1:48:06] beautiful she's not a denomination she's
[1:48:09] not a church she's not a man's idea
[1:48:12] she's not a Creed she's not a Dogma she
[1:48:15] is
[1:48:17] him
[1:48:19] woo that's who you are notice now then
[1:48:22] we find he preaches God's provided way
[1:48:25] for this day 1964 then the
[1:48:28] identification of Christ in all the ages
[1:48:31] so he wants you to see so you can see
[1:48:34] not only Christ in every age but you'll
[1:48:36] be able to see Christ in this age you'll
[1:48:38] be able to see Christ in this age in
[1:48:40] this age whatever age you are this
[1:48:42] morning whether you're 80 whether you're
[1:48:44] 60 whether you're 13 it's Christ in this
[1:48:47] age at 49 year old age at 69 year old I
[1:48:51] see Christ in that age I see him in the
[1:48:54] old I see him in the young I see him in
[1:48:56] the boys I see him in the girls I see
[1:48:59] Christ through every age and every
[1:49:02] generation Hallelujah this
[1:49:05] morning come on work with me this
[1:49:07] morning church this is good stuff
[1:49:10] notice then he preaches God is
[1:49:12] identified by his
[1:49:15] characteristics now if this wasn't God
[1:49:18] that's fine but he's identified by his
[1:49:20] characteristics then in 1964 he preaches
[1:49:22] to Mighty God unveiled before
[1:49:25] us and in that message he's getting to
[1:49:27] show deity is now tabernacling
[1:49:32] Humanity deity is now tabernacling
[1:49:36] Humanity then he preaches in 19 no let
[1:49:38] me go back one more 1964 toward the end
[1:49:41] of 64 he preaches the identified
[1:49:44] Masterpiece of
[1:49:46] God how many of you listening to that
[1:49:50] lately at least you're honest the
[1:49:53] identified Masterpiece brother Brandon
[1:49:55] wasn't pointing to himself as that
[1:50:01] Masterpiece he was pointing to a
[1:50:04] bride I said he was pointing to a body
[1:50:07] he was pointing the one just like
[1:50:09] Michelangelo when he sculptured the the
[1:50:12] the statue of Moses and I saw the
[1:50:14] replica out there in California let me
[1:50:16] tell you when Moses got done because
[1:50:18] what was in his vision became manifested
[1:50:21] he stroke he stroke it on the knee and
[1:50:23] said speak I'm here to tell you in this
[1:50:25] hour this little bride is speaking
[1:50:27] because why she's taking the open book
[1:50:29] and she's prophesy again and the word is
[1:50:32] Flowing that's the identified
[1:50:34] Masterpiece for this hour you are that
[1:50:37] identification you are that
[1:50:41] Masterpiece quit looking at some other
[1:50:43] church quit looking at some other young
[1:50:45] person quit looking at some other couple
[1:50:47] you are the Masterpiece you are the
[1:50:49] identification
[1:50:56] 1965 last year of his
[1:50:58] ministry seed is not air with the shook
[1:51:01] showing there's a distinction between
[1:51:03] the church and the
[1:51:05] bride that the seed will not be air with
[1:51:09] the shock otherwise we got a different
[1:51:14] Ministry oh my we're not going to be on
[1:51:16] the outside Lebanon and Syria and Egypt
[1:51:20] now we got a different Ministry we're in
[1:51:21] the Homeland of the word the seed will
[1:51:25] not be air with the shook the Shu just
[1:51:27] holds the seed in but at that appointed
[1:51:30] time the shook has to give way and the
[1:51:33] seed has to come forth and let me tell
[1:51:35] you it's the coming forth time the seed
[1:51:37] of the Bride it's come forth and it's in
[1:51:39] time and we are she we are ready to take
[1:51:42] a body
[1:51:43] [Applause]
[1:51:48] change 1965 the anointed ones at the end
[1:51:52] time
[1:51:53] Christ is revealed in his what own
[1:51:56] word not some other man's word not some
[1:51:59] man's idea he's not revealed through
[1:52:01] Thunders and perusia and two souls and
[1:52:03] no souls and all these other ideas they
[1:52:05] have a partial truth but that ain't
[1:52:07] where he said if God was so focused on
[1:52:10] all these other movements that surround
[1:52:12] the message he would have laid on a
[1:52:14] prophet's heart to preach those things
[1:52:16] but he stayed with the word he stayed
[1:52:18] with what belongs to the believer in the
[1:52:21] promised land and I me tell you Thunders
[1:52:23] it don't belong to us that's not our
[1:52:27] message but we got a message right here
[1:52:30] stay balanced stay in the middle of the
[1:52:32] road stay with it it'll take you on to
[1:52:34] the coming of the
[1:52:37] Lord 1965 the invisible
[1:52:42] Union of the bride of Christ notice the
[1:52:46] invisible Union there's a vow that's
[1:52:50] made before the wedd ceremony now how
[1:52:54] many of you got married here some of
[1:52:56] y'all should raise your hands I mean you
[1:52:57] may not like it but you got married
[1:53:00] anyway
[1:53:01] right before there was a
[1:53:05] ceremony there was an invisible Union
[1:53:07] that took
[1:53:09] place brother Troy you asked
[1:53:13] her will you marry
[1:53:15] me thank God she said
[1:53:18] yes come on Troy this is time for you to
[1:53:21] speak up
[1:53:23] yeah and we'll talk about that later tro
[1:53:25] we'll have marriage cancel when I get
[1:53:28] done but there's an invisible Union it
[1:53:31] takes place before the wedding ceremony
[1:53:34] look at your Prophet getting you into
[1:53:36] the homeland of the word no then he
[1:53:39] begins to preach the Rapture after this
[1:53:42] invisible Union's taking place then
[1:53:44] there's a promise that there's a Rapture
[1:53:46] you're going to be caught up the
[1:53:47] catching away not only are we going to
[1:53:49] I'm going to marry you but I'm going to
[1:53:51] come and take you to that that home
[1:53:53] beyond the skies then he preaches things
[1:53:56] that are to be toward the very end of
[1:53:59] 1965 things that are to be otherwise
[1:54:02] telling you you look for these
[1:54:04] manifestations in the scripture because
[1:54:06] the scripture is the vision and it is
[1:54:09] speaking then he preaches at the very
[1:54:11] end
[1:54:12] 1965 modern events are made clear
[1:54:16] through prophecy so you can look around
[1:54:19] that's why we're not fren that's why
[1:54:21] we're not afraid that's why we're not
[1:54:22] full of anxiety and on pills and
[1:54:24] medication it's because we had a Prophet
[1:54:26] come and said look for these things
[1:54:28] prophecy is beginning to make itself
[1:54:30] clear by modern events that's been all
[1:54:33] around us we see Israel right now she's
[1:54:35] back in her Homeland we see she's become
[1:54:37] the burdensome Stone every nation that
[1:54:39] surrounds her is her enemy but let me
[1:54:41] tell you it's only the vision speaking
[1:54:43] and it's telling us we're close little
[1:54:45] bride we're close to going home we won't
[1:54:48] be here much longer
[1:54:53] we will not be here much longer there
[1:54:56] will be a catching away because the
[1:54:58] union has already been been taking place
[1:55:01] The Vow has been
[1:55:04] made can I keep
[1:55:07] going let me try to bring this down I
[1:55:09] got I got a whole lot here but I know
[1:55:11] it's 12:00 and I'm watching that clock
[1:55:13] brother B say the church has failed
[1:55:15] instead of bringing the people together
[1:55:16] as one body it separated them out he
[1:55:18] says so the church will never take the
[1:55:21] people over Jordan he says Remember come
[1:55:24] out of her my people you see come out of
[1:55:26] her let's serve god with one heart one
[1:55:29] mind one Accord is that right and then
[1:55:31] God will take his church over Jordan
[1:55:33] that's over death now you believe that
[1:55:36] with all your
[1:55:38] heart so we find in
[1:55:41] 1947 there's something special happened
[1:55:43] here he got the commission from the
[1:55:46] angel and I want you to see no longer
[1:55:49] was it just a local Ministry around
[1:55:52] Jeffersonville Indiana but he was
[1:55:54] commissioned to take the message around
[1:55:56] the world to call out the bride that's
[1:56:00] been
[1:56:01] dispersed that's been in the dispora
[1:56:04] those in Europe those in Africa those in
[1:56:07] the foreign lands go around the world he
[1:56:09] went around seven times for what the
[1:56:11] message is still going around the world
[1:56:13] calling back the bride get her back to
[1:56:16] the homeland of the word of God where
[1:56:19] you can be blessed to take a Rapture and
[1:56:21] a body change that that's the entire
[1:56:23] purpose let me tell you this message was
[1:56:24] not about William brandom don't get hurt
[1:56:26] over that but it was about you it's
[1:56:28] always been about you youve been that
[1:56:31] bride that's been dispersed so God sent
[1:56:33] you a messenger to call you back to the
[1:56:36] promised land of the word of God where
[1:56:38] we can take a
[1:56:42] Rapture Hallelujah God has called us out
[1:56:45] of the confusion and far lands of
[1:56:49] denominations calling us back from the
[1:56:51] desport now notice
[1:56:53] they asked Jesus in Matthew 24 Jesus
[1:56:57] went out and departed from the temple
[1:56:58] and the disciples came to him for to
[1:57:00] show him the buildings of the temple and
[1:57:02] Jesus said unto them see ye not all
[1:57:03] these things verily I say unto you that
[1:57:05] there should not be one notice left here
[1:57:08] one stone upon another that shall not be
[1:57:11] thrown down and he sat upon the Mount of
[1:57:13] Olives and the disciples came unto him
[1:57:15] privately saying tell us when these
[1:57:17] things shall be and what shall be the
[1:57:18] sign of thy coming and the end of the
[1:57:20] world they were curious like us when are
[1:57:23] these things going to come like your
[1:57:25] like the counterparts that we work with
[1:57:27] they're wondering when they know
[1:57:28] something's happened they can see it
[1:57:30] they can sense it and Jesus tells them
[1:57:33] in Matthew 24 and verse 14 or 15 he says
[1:57:36] when you therefore shall see the
[1:57:39] abomination of desolation spoken by
[1:57:41] Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy
[1:57:43] Place whoever readeth let him understand
[1:57:45] so he's talking about the Jews now Jesus
[1:57:49] tells them when you see the Abomination
[1:57:51] when you you see what Daniel prophesied
[1:57:54] when you see what Jeremiah prophesied
[1:57:56] when you see the vision begin to
[1:58:00] speak then you'll know that the end is
[1:58:03] not and brother Brown would tell us in
[1:58:05] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel 1961 he
[1:58:08] says this is one of the most important
[1:58:10] scriptures in the book referring to uh
[1:58:13] Daniel 9 he says what does it do it
[1:58:15] tells the closing of the Jewish Nation
[1:58:17] the Jewish people this scripture to 70
[1:58:19] weeks it discloses and tells exactly
[1:58:22] from the time that Daniel started there
[1:58:24] until the end of the consummation it's
[1:58:26] one of the greatest time
[1:58:29] pieces he goes if you want to know what
[1:58:31] day of the week he goes look at your
[1:58:33] calendar if you want to know what time
[1:58:35] it is you look at that clock back on the
[1:58:37] back wall it's telling me to hurry up
[1:58:39] but if you want to know where we are as
[1:58:41] a
[1:58:41] people as a nation as a country you want
[1:58:46] to know what time it is as far as the
[1:58:48] end of the end you got to look at Israel
[1:58:53] he said notice he said Daniel referring
[1:58:56] to Daniel 7 we has nothing to do with
[1:58:59] the Gentiles the Seven Seals the seven
[1:59:01] plagues the seven woes the seven
[1:59:03] trumpets has not one thing to do the
[1:59:05] Gentile church will be in glory at that
[1:59:08] time in another place he said when these
[1:59:10] things take place he says we'll be we'll
[1:59:13] be in glory at a wedding supper getting
[1:59:18] married oh Hallelujah y'all said that
[1:59:21] very weak
[1:59:23] I mean you telling me you getting
[1:59:25] married and you
[1:59:27] amen PR God girls if the guys didn't
[1:59:30] want to say amen that's where you should
[1:59:32] have shouted to the rooftop you know
[1:59:34] what it was like when you went from
[1:59:36] store to store looking for that dress
[1:59:38] getting everything planned out come on
[1:59:40] sister Tammy give me a little bit of
[1:59:41] amen amen that's weak come on come on
[1:59:43] sister Donna I know you got an amen in
[1:59:45] you yes sir man when you was getting
[1:59:47] married and that vow was made you got
[1:59:49] all excited all giddy you started
[1:59:51] planning everything everything out
[1:59:52] that's what we're here to do Church he's
[1:59:54] coming back to take a bride that says I
[1:59:57] will marry you you'll be bone of my bone
[2:00:00] fresh of My Flesh power of my power I've
[2:00:03] taking you home with me I'm not going to
[2:00:06] leave you here but you're going to go
[2:00:08] with
[2:00:09] me he says I go to prepare a place for
[2:00:12] you and if it wasn't so I would have
[2:00:15] told you he's got a land prepared he's
[2:00:17] got a word prepared he's got a all we
[2:00:20] got to do is ly up with the
[2:00:26] word the Gentile church he says will be
[2:00:30] in glory she'll be getting
[2:00:32] married come on
[2:00:35] sisters amen that's weak but y'all going
[2:00:38] to have to come visit Louisiana cuz our
[2:00:39] sisters want to get
[2:00:43] married
[2:00:45] man well we'll just move on we'll deal
[2:00:48] with marriage another
[2:00:50] service Hallelujah notice he says and it
[2:00:53] discloses the fact that God Deals Only
[2:00:56] with the Jews when they are in the
[2:01:00] Homeland Hallelujah so in Isaiah 11: 11
[2:01:03] we find here God is predicting or
[2:01:06] prophesying that his children will be
[2:01:08] back in our homeland Jeremiah 29:10
[2:01:11] Jeremiah predicts that Israel will
[2:01:12] return back to their Homeland Ezra 1:1
[2:01:15] confirms at the return of the Jewish
[2:01:17] people back to their Homeland Genesis 17
[2:01:19] God telling Abraham and his off they
[2:01:22] will be in a Land of Canaan it'll be a
[2:01:25] Perpetual holding so notice Israel has a
[2:01:28] natural Homeland it may not appear to be
[2:01:31] much but it's God's land and God gave it
[2:01:34] to him as her as his little bride and
[2:01:37] what am I telling this message may not
[2:01:39] look much to a lot of people that just
[2:01:41] glance at it and look at it and they
[2:01:43] want to cast it off and they want to
[2:01:44] throw it away but to the Bri it's the
[2:01:47] whole land of the world every promise
[2:01:49] lays in it every Wonder every sty every
[2:01:53] Supernatural every healing every
[2:01:55] Deliverance it oh Hallelujah it lays in
[2:01:59] the
[2:01:59] word it may not be big when you look at
[2:02:03] denominations but everything we have
[2:02:05] need of is right here in the
[2:02:10] word it's in the word and we've been
[2:02:13] restored back to the homeland of the
[2:02:19] word let me go a little bit further
[2:02:22] amen he goes I've always told you if you
[2:02:25] want to know what day of the week it is
[2:02:28] look at the
[2:02:29] calendar if you want to know what time
[2:02:31] we're living in watch the
[2:02:34] Jews that's the only time piece see God
[2:02:39] and he goes said God did not all low a
[2:02:41] certain time for the
[2:02:43] Gentiles there was no certain space of
[2:02:46] time he says now that's where I think
[2:02:48] many of the great writers mix it up
[2:02:50] trying to apply this to the jewi and
[2:02:51] Gentile because he said thy people but
[2:02:54] he was talking to Daniel not to the
[2:02:56] church Daniel's people is to Jew if he
[2:02:58] was talking to the church you can't make
[2:03:00] that run anywhere see you're way back
[2:03:03] because even before the coming of Christ
[2:03:05] it'll run right any kind of prophetic
[2:03:06] weeks you want to put it in there it's
[2:03:08] already run out but he was talking to
[2:03:10] the Jews so therefore the Jew is God's
[2:03:13] time
[2:03:15] piece it has nothing to do with the
[2:03:17] church the 70 weeks has nothing to do
[2:03:21] with the church so brother Joe why does
[2:03:23] Daniel 70 weeks why is it so important
[2:03:27] because it's our time piece it's telling
[2:03:29] us exactly where we
[2:03:33] are
[2:03:35] exactly where we are for many of us that
[2:03:40] are here this morning Israel has always
[2:03:43] been in that little land she was
[2:03:45] restored back in
[2:03:49] 1948 that's all that we know
[2:03:52] but for 2500 years she was dispersed and
[2:03:55] for many of you young people this
[2:03:56] message is the only thing you ever knew
[2:04:00] because your parents came from the
[2:04:01] dispersion the dispora and they came
[2:04:03] back to the
[2:04:04] word but the Jews were out there for
[2:04:07] 2500 years but at the time
[2:04:10] appointed the vision shall speak at the
[2:04:14] time appointed not only speaks for the
[2:04:17] the the Jewish bride but it also speaks
[2:04:19] for the Gentile bride let me go just a
[2:04:21] little bit further and I promise I'm I'm
[2:04:23] not going to hold you too long Matthew
[2:04:25] 24:32 he says now learn a parable of the
[2:04:28] Fig Tree when his branches yet tender
[2:04:30] and putteth forth leaves you know that
[2:04:32] summer is now they're asking when are we
[2:04:34] going to know these things he said was
[2:04:36] the little fig tree but we find prior to
[2:04:39] Matthew 24:32 he begins to tell about
[2:04:42] the signs of the end of the age in 24
[2:04:45] 3-14 then he speaks about the
[2:04:47] abomination of desolation in verses 15-
[2:04:50] 28 then he speaks about the the coming
[2:04:52] of the son of man in 29 through 31 but
[2:04:54] we find Israel for the first time for
[2:04:57] 2500 years is restored again to
[2:05:00] Jerusalem he says oh people don't let
[2:05:02] that go over your
[2:05:06] head he said that's the Fig Tree putting
[2:05:09] forth its buds this generation he said
[2:05:12] now 40 years is declared a generation
[2:05:14] Israel has now been a nation for
[2:05:17] 76
[2:05:20] years how how close are
[2:05:23] we see the prophecy is being
[2:05:27] fulfilled the vision is speaking so that
[2:05:30] gives further
[2:05:32] Credence that we're living in the hour
[2:05:34] of fulfillment let me go on a little bit
[2:05:36] further because I want to show you one
[2:05:37] more PowerPoint a
[2:05:39] slide we go here and brother Bown says
[2:05:42] and it is I oh God we're glad today to
[2:05:44] see Israel come into our homeland of
[2:05:45] nation the old sixo star David flying
[2:05:48] under them Jews returning saying they'll
[2:05:50] never come back to die in a homel land
[2:05:52] but they come to see the Messiah oh God
[2:05:54] now he says now oh goes lce we're
[2:05:58] watching just as Noah watched Enoch and
[2:06:00] know immediately after Enoch come the
[2:06:02] Judgment was going to strike the Earth
[2:06:04] we see the Ark of the Jew being prepared
[2:06:05] again we know the translation of the
[2:06:07] hand the Jews are in the Homeland and
[2:06:10] and been going back if you get the
[2:06:11] decline of the world wars he said after
[2:06:13] the first world war flew over he said
[2:06:15] they flew over Jerusalem and captured it
[2:06:18] and it begins God went and began to hard
[2:06:20] melini's heart Hitler's heart Stalin's
[2:06:23] heart heart to men all over every
[2:06:25] country hating the
[2:06:29] Jew then he goes into Third Exodus he
[2:06:31] says as it was in Germany up in Russia
[2:06:34] and Italy the people raised up Joseph's
[2:06:36] talking about Jose of Stalin and Hitler
[2:06:38] and and Stalin and melini who hated the
[2:06:41] Jews they had to go back to their
[2:06:43] homeline he says God you got ways of
[2:06:46] doing things we don't understand you
[2:06:48] pressed him no home in Germany he says
[2:06:51] he says every everything was taken away
[2:06:52] from also in Italy and Russia no place
[2:06:54] to go they were sent back to the
[2:06:56] Homeland just to fulfill the
[2:07:00] word and so it is with you Church you
[2:07:03] have no home in the bride or in the in
[2:07:05] the Baptist Church in the Pentecostal
[2:07:07] Methodist Church our homeland is in the
[2:07:09] word of
[2:07:11] God he says oh the loving hand of God
[2:07:14] how sometimes it looks cruel the way the
[2:07:16] people suffer but it's still it's the
[2:07:18] tender hand of
[2:07:20] Jehovah so you're telling me that a
[2:07:23] second world war 75 million people
[2:07:27] casualties included military and
[2:07:28] civilians around 3% of the world's
[2:07:31] population died in the second world war
[2:07:33] and it's the tender hand of
[2:07:37] Jehovah let me give you some
[2:07:40] numbers many civilians died because of
[2:07:43] the liberate genocides massacres Mass
[2:07:44] bombings disease starvations the Soviet
[2:07:47] Union Russia lost around 27 million
[2:07:50] people during the war .7 million
[2:07:52] military 19 million civilians Germany
[2:07:55] sustained 5.3 million military losses
[2:07:58] mostly on the Eastern Front during the
[2:08:00] final battles of Germany Nazi Germany as
[2:08:03] part of the deliberate program of
[2:08:05] Extinction and systematically killed
[2:08:06] over 11 million people including six
[2:08:09] million Jews in addition to the Nazi
[2:08:11] concentration camps the Soviet Googs
[2:08:14] labor camps led to the deaths of 3.6
[2:08:17] million people yet after all the Death
[2:08:20] after all the destruction after all the
[2:08:22] cruelty and all the wasted life it is
[2:08:24] still the tender hand of Jehovah God
[2:08:28] will do what it takes to get his elect
[2:08:30] into the homeland of the word and he
[2:08:33] will do the same for the bride he will
[2:08:35] let Destruction come he will let hard a
[2:08:37] come he will do whatever it takes
[2:08:40] because his word will not return
[2:08:44] void notice she's one of the great time
[2:08:48] pieces let's put that PowerPoint up if
[2:08:50] you do
[2:08:52] he said we found ourselves 40 years
[2:08:54] coming back since the first world war
[2:08:56] the Jews have returned back to their
[2:08:58] Homeland God never did deal with Israel
[2:09:01] until she was in her
[2:09:03] Homeland now them Jews them true Jews he
[2:09:05] said them that never had an opportunity
[2:09:07] now brother there's your 144,000 there's
[2:09:10] 12 Tribes of GAD and Asher and Reuben 12
[2:09:12] tribes he said they're finally all
[2:09:14] standing on Mount Si back in the
[2:09:16] Homeland there they were but we find
[2:09:18] here in Exodus 19 I'm going to show you
[2:09:20] some pictures
[2:09:22] and they're not the best pictures but
[2:09:23] you'll get the gist of it anyway Exodus
[2:09:26] 19 we we see it 19 and verse four says
[2:09:29] you have seen what I did unto the
[2:09:31] Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle
[2:09:33] wings and brought you unto myself so in
[2:09:36] May 1949 the country of
[2:09:39] yeeman allowed the majority of the
[2:09:42] Jewish population to leave Israel
[2:09:45] immediately jumped into action you can
[2:09:46] show the next slide jumped into
[2:09:49] action launching operation on on the
[2:09:51] wings of an eagle it's an a covert
[2:09:53] airlift operation to bring tens of
[2:09:55] thousands of yemenite Jews to their new
[2:09:57] Homeland in Israel the operation
[2:09:59] officially named originated from
[2:10:01] scripture you have seen what I did unto
[2:10:03] the Egyptians and how I bore You On
[2:10:05] Eagle's Wings and I brought you to
[2:10:06] myself Exodus 19 and4 during the
[2:10:09] operation nickname operation Magic
[2:10:11] Carpet some 49,000 yite Jews mostly
[2:10:15] children were airlifted to Israel from
[2:10:17] yeman Aden and several other places of
[2:10:19] Saudi Arabia the mission was a a secret
[2:10:22] only revealed to the media after it was
[2:10:26] completed next line you see you remember
[2:10:30] hearing brother bam talk about these
[2:10:32] things he said they seen a little real
[2:10:35] played how they were waiting to go back
[2:10:38] to the
[2:10:39] Homeland here I have a a story I'm going
[2:10:42] to share with you from a man by the name
[2:10:43] of Mr ozrey he was a little four-month
[2:10:47] old child during this time he said his
[2:10:49] 20-year-old father and a friend loaded
[2:10:51] up on their donkeys and went to the
[2:10:53] market they were in yeman yeman was a
[2:10:55] very backward country Mr azrey said we
[2:10:57] didn't have news we didn't have we
[2:10:59] didn't know what an airplane was if you
[2:11:01] went to the big city you you'd see a car
[2:11:03] but very few people went to the big city
[2:11:05] so only
[2:11:07] donkeys could you imagine getting a
[2:11:09] church this morning on a
[2:11:12] donkey The Village all Jewish in in very
[2:11:15] close proximity to all Arab Village made
[2:11:18] up about 40 Jewish families all inter
[2:11:20] married with each other because they
[2:11:22] were disconnected from other Jewish
[2:11:23] communities so everyone was related to
[2:11:26] everyone the market town was named as
[2:11:28] big TZ which my grandmother said was
[2:11:30] about a half a donkey's day ride away on
[2:11:33] the road they went him he's talking
[2:11:35] about his father now on the road the two
[2:11:37] men Mr Oz's father and another gentleman
[2:11:40] they met a stranger also on donkey back
[2:11:43] the man was a eski Jew he didn't look
[2:11:45] Jewish but he said the Shalom Alum to
[2:11:47] them and they just looked at them and
[2:11:49] startled they said who are you and he
[2:11:51] said said I'm a shelc or the messenger
[2:11:54] from etrit Israel and Israel a state
[2:11:57] whose existence had they had not heard
[2:11:59] yet although it was in the land that
[2:12:01] they believed someday their descendants
[2:12:02] would visit they said you don't look
[2:12:04] Jewish but the shelc started reciting
[2:12:06] the Shima and by the end of the first
[2:12:08] paragraph they said we believe you he
[2:12:10] goes he goes on to say he goes these
[2:12:12] three were men were able to talk to each
[2:12:14] other because the Y Jews still spoke
[2:12:17] Biblical Hebrew as a living language and
[2:12:19] the shc said you should go back to our
[2:12:23] homeland he told me he says we have our
[2:12:26] own State now we have a leader whose
[2:12:27] name is David benu and another leader
[2:12:29] another leader whose name is moshi moshi
[2:12:32] sherad who followed bingan his prime
[2:12:34] minister and they asked how did we get
[2:12:35] there they said they're airplanes you
[2:12:37] can show the next Slide the airplanes
[2:12:38] will be waiting for you in addin the
[2:12:40] British control yemenese Seaport about
[2:12:42] two week donkey R away so they asked him
[2:12:45] and said what is an airplane he he took
[2:12:47] out a piece of paper out of his pocket
[2:12:48] and he drew it threw on and he looked at
[2:12:50] it he said what looks like an eagle next
[2:12:53] slide he said that's what God promised
[2:12:55] to send us back on in Exodus next slide
[2:12:58] God talks about bringing Israelites out
[2:12:59] of Egypt On Eagle's Wings and the
[2:13:01] promise of in gathering of the Exiles on
[2:13:04] eagles's wings echoes in Jewish Jewish
[2:13:07] dreams he goes now back on the the dusty
[2:13:10] road to yea the man poured out a loaf of
[2:13:11] bread out of his bag and he said now I
[2:13:13] brought this for you so take it back to
[2:13:14] the vision the the village and show them
[2:13:17] and tell them so my father and his
[2:13:18] friend turned around they went back to
[2:13:20] the village and they stood stood by
[2:13:21] Rabbi and the rabbi said to assemble
[2:13:23] everyone in the synagogue and they said
[2:13:25] the service for gratitude and
[2:13:26] Thanksgiving they also said the
[2:13:27] blessings for new things then the rabbi
[2:13:29] told everybody to be ready to move in
[2:13:32] five days and in five days they left and
[2:13:35] they rode their donkeys to at next life
[2:13:37] so they went to ad and the jdc and the
[2:13:40] Jewish agency took good care of them and
[2:13:42] they prayed that God will send eagles
[2:13:44] wings that was the air lft sometimes
[2:13:46] known as operation flying carpet but
[2:13:48] known to the people who brought brought
[2:13:50] their new Liv on the wings of an eagle
[2:13:52] next slide you see next
[2:13:55] slide go forward to the next slide now
[2:13:58] they're on the ples heading back next
[2:14:00] slide here they are the yemenite Jews
[2:14:02] who didn't know what an airplane was but
[2:14:05] they knew there was a Homeland that
[2:14:07] they've been waiting for to get back to
[2:14:09] that fulfilled Exodus 14 and9 and we
[2:14:11] find here next slide here we find
[2:14:14] brother Brandon would tell us he says
[2:14:15] notice he says then when the old Rabbi
[2:14:17] stood out there and he seen the pl land
[2:14:19] them Jews he says you read it in the
[2:14:21] magazine they're still plying with
[2:14:22] wooden plows and when they seen the
[2:14:24] thing sat down that wasn't going around
[2:14:26] it the old Rabbi stood there and he says
[2:14:28] remember our Prophet said we're going to
[2:14:30] go home to our homeland and we'll be
[2:14:32] carried Back On Eagle's Wings and they
[2:14:34] asked are you going back to the Homeland
[2:14:36] to die he said no we're going back to
[2:14:39] the Homeland to see our Messiah what am
[2:14:41] I telling you Church we're not going
[2:14:44] back to the homeland of this word to die
[2:14:46] we're going back to meet the Lord Jesus
[2:14:49] that's why I sent you a message that's
[2:14:51] why we got a prophet in this day we're
[2:14:53] going to meet the Lord in the skies
[2:14:56] musicians
[2:14:57] come what God does for natural Israel he
[2:15:01] does for the supernatural for the
[2:15:02] spiritual
[2:15:04] Israel oh hallelujah we're going back to
[2:15:08] our homeland not to die but we're going
[2:15:11] back we're going back to see the Messiah
[2:15:15] we're going back to see our Lord and we
[2:15:17] also let me just end with this last
[2:15:19] scripture as I break this
[2:15:23] down for this we say this is 1
[2:15:26] Thessalonians 4 verse1 15 for this we
[2:15:29] say by the word of the Lord that we
[2:15:31] which are alive or remain at the coming
[2:15:32] of the Lord shall not prevent them which
[2:15:34] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[2:15:37] descend from heaven with a shout and the
[2:15:39] voice of the Archangel and the Trump of
[2:15:41] God and the dead and Christ shall rise
[2:15:44] then we which our Al remain shall be
[2:15:46] caught up together with him in the
[2:15:47] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[2:15:49] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[2:15:51] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[2:15:55] words notice in the Rapture message I
[2:15:58] believe that's our message I believe we
[2:16:01] can take comfort in the Rapture message
[2:16:03] he says three things have to happen a
[2:16:06] shout what is a shout it's a message
[2:16:08] going forth the living bread of life
[2:16:11] bringing forth the bride that's why
[2:16:14] you're here church you've heard the
[2:16:17] shout he says now he goes God God has a
[2:16:21] way of doing things he never changes his
[2:16:23] policy he never changes he's an
[2:16:25] unchanging God Amos 3:7 he said he would
[2:16:27] do nothing on the earth until he reverse
[2:16:29] reveal it to his servant the prophets so
[2:16:31] the shout brings forth the bride getting
[2:16:33] a people ready he says now we come
[2:16:35] through the church ages but were're
[2:16:37] promised in the last days according to
[2:16:38] Malachi 4 that there would be a return
[2:16:40] again a prophet in the lamb that's right
[2:16:42] notice his nature what he would do
[2:16:45] notice he said he used the the the
[2:16:46] spirit of Elijah five times but the
[2:16:49] first thing is a shout he starts to
[2:16:50] ascending from heaven and there's a
[2:16:52] shout what is it it's a message to get
[2:16:54] the people
[2:16:57] together oh we may have been dispersed
[2:17:00] but he came with a shout and went around
[2:17:03] the globe seven times to get the little
[2:17:05] bride together to get her ready for what
[2:17:08] for a homecoming
[2:17:10] time a shout of message get the people
[2:17:13] together a second is the voice of the
[2:17:15] Resurrection the same voice the loud
[2:17:17] voice in St John 11: 38-44 that called
[2:17:20] Lazarus from the grave getting the bride
[2:17:23] together then the resurrection of the
[2:17:25] Dead to be caught up with it now watch
[2:17:27] these three things take place the next
[2:17:29] is what a trumpet he says now the third
[2:17:31] thing is a trumpet which always at the
[2:17:34] Feast of trumpets is the calling the
[2:17:36] people to the feast that'll be the bride
[2:17:40] supper oh Hallelujah the Lamb's supper
[2:17:44] with the bride the first thing comes of
[2:17:46] fourth is a message the calling of the
[2:17:48] Bride together the next thing is the
[2:17:49] resurrection of the sleeper bride the
[2:17:51] ones that died back in other ages that
[2:17:52] were caught and the thirds the trumpet
[2:17:55] the Feast of Heaven in the sky why he
[2:17:57] says that's the thing that takes place
[2:17:59] friends and he goes therefore the
[2:18:00] message calls the bride together the
[2:18:02] same one with a loud voice he screamed
[2:18:05] out with a shout and a voice and he woke
[2:18:07] Lazareth with a loud voice he cried
[2:18:09] Lazarus come forth and the voice wakes
[2:18:12] up the sleeping bride sleeping dead and
[2:18:14] the trumpet with the sound of a trumpet
[2:18:16] and when he does it he calls he says
[2:18:18] always a trumpet called Israel to the
[2:18:20] Feast of trumpets which was a
[2:18:22] Pentecostal Feast a great feast in the
[2:18:25] sky and the Feast of the trumpets now a
[2:18:27] trumpet do you announce a calling
[2:18:29] together come to the feast and that's
[2:18:31] what we're waiting on brother and sister
[2:18:33] we have heard the shout we have heard
[2:18:35] the voice and we're waiting on the call
[2:18:38] come up hither my people and be not
[2:18:40] partakers with her
[2:18:42] plagues we've heard the voice we

[2:18:47] shout we've woken ourselves up from a
[2:18:50] slumber we come out of the
