know you've eaten eaten lunch and the the Sunday afternoon services are always a little different and I'm torn in which direction to go as far as I I want to preach this thought and it seems like the Lord's leading me to want to slow down and teach a little bit so we just want to follow his leadership and do what he has uh do what he wants us to do and and you know brother Baler asked me he said are you ready for tonight I said I don't know if you're ever ready and I said I told joice I said I I just feel like I I don't have you know my thoughts are jumbled up and I said but one thing I know is if I just put him first and I put those thoughts before him he'll pull them all together and he'll he'll see this person needs this and this person needs that and man I I can't tell you how many times I've had people come up to me after service and they say I liked it when you said this this and this I'm thinking I never said that but God said it God knew what they had need of so turn with me in your bibles if you would and I want to continue on uh on our thought of the King's Highway and if we were to uh subtitle tonight it would be the Queen of Sheba and uh turn with me in Matthew chapter 12 I'm not going to keep you long I do know you're tired I know how I'm human too we're all human and and sometimes a preacher can get under an anointing and the people don't get under that same anointing uh you know you just eating lunch and and uh you know you've eaten lunch and you're tired and your body naturally tells you it's time to take a nap or rest or slow down so um we'll just we'll just go as the Lord leads and see where we're at so Matthew chapter 12 um while you're turning there I'm just want to uh have a quick word of prayer if you'd bow your heads tonight Lord Jesus we just come before you tonight with grateful Hearts thankful for the day you've given us and for those that were able to come out today and just to gather and to hear your word Lord and sit down and and just listen to you minister to our hearts and we thank you for that Lord and Lord we come once again uh and just ask that you would just speak to us tonight Lord uh ask for your leadership and your guidance for your anointing over the service tonight Lord for the lips of the speaker and the ears of the hearers Lord Jesus that we would get what we would have need of tonight Lord and we could leave here knowing that we have heard from you and we're prepared to take on the challenges of the week and and be uh steadfast and strong in the word as we leave Lord we just want to tell you we love you and appreciate you and thank you for all you do for us in Jesus name amen so Matthew chapter 12 and I know you got your spot there but I want to read this little quote to you that Prophet began to talk about and he's talking about the Queen of Sheba here the the queen of the South and you know uh the the Bible tells us and in our scripture we're going to read and is talked about but I want to kind of look at this and rehearse but he says as we notice this little lady pressed her way on he said for she was determined to find out she had heard rumors she had heard the talk she' heard things that was going on over here in Jerusalem and and with Solomon and this Temple and she'd heard all these good things and he said she was determined to find out and we have to find our place ourselves in our place in the word that we're determined we're determined to move on when others say you shouldn't you're determined to move on when your health fails you you're determined to move on you keep walking this King's Highway and he says God's hand to protect God's hand protected her till she finally arrived at this place and we're going to get into some details about the journey that she was on but when we think about that God's hand of protection because of her determination to find out what was God's message message for this hour what was God trying to reveal to the people she said I want that Revelation I'm determined and he'll protect me and get me there no matter how hard the journey that's the way we have to look at this he said if you're really in your heart trying to find out what's right God will lead you to that spot he'll protect you all along the road and bring you to that spot he said and see she dismounted her camel out in front of this Palace and she didn't come to stay day for just one night she didn't come just to play around the word she didn't come just to say oh I think I'll see what's going on over here she was serious she meant business he said she come there not for just one night but she come and she pitched her tents and she set up camp she wanted to know what was going on she didn't stay for just one night or just an hour or just to see but she came and stayed until she was convinced you see we we all have to stay in the presence of the king until we're convinced that we're the Bride of Jesus Christ well some of you got that we have to be convinced in this hour that there is a greater than Solomon is here that there's something greater before us in this hour that we're living there's something greater the Holy Ghost on the inside in this day that we're living in a greater than Solomon is here Matthew chap 12 we'll read let you have your seats here just a moment the queen of the South shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall con condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here you can have your seats tonight Behold a greater than Solomon is here now we've heard this and we've read this scripture and and we we've looked at this in Matthew many of times we've over we've looked it over and we've we've heard this but I want to take a moment here and just kind of look and we lay a foundation and let's look and see what's really happening here in Matthew chap 12 when when when when when this when this quote or this this scripture is given given here that says the queen of the South shall rise up in judgment what's happened before that statement was made and we look at this and we can see that this St this statement is so important because Jesus brings this out right after The Parables that he's been speaking to these Pharisees so in chapter 12 of Matthew these Pharisees were these ultimate religious leaders right the scribes and the Pharisees they're they're the they're the religious of the religious among the Jews and before Christ as his life was on Earth and these guys were determined I will not break the law they were determined we will not break the law of God under any circumstance We Will We Will devise a system to where no matter what we'll do this this this this and this and we will not deviate away from the law law law law and Jesus is sitting there looking at this and you would think brothers and sisters with such a desire in their heart to never break the law you would think that they would be able to look and notice and recognize that Jesus the son of God stood right before them the walking talking flesh of God stands right before him and they're trying to tell him how to live the life by the law and they're sitting there and they're looking at this and you would think they would look and recognize hey this is the one we've been waiting for this is the one we've been longing for this is the one we've talked about and we've heard preachers preach about but no they didn't look at it that way they could only see Jesus Through the written law of the word and they could not see him through the very present ever knowing need providing God that he was you see their problem was they wasn't understanding the nature of God you know there's a lot of law LA s there's a lot of rules there's a lot of dos and don'ts and don't do and do this and don't do that but there's also a nature of God and they could not see the nature of God because you see God in their mind in the Pharisees mind God was primarily the one who makes demands he's a demanding God he's a God that tells you to do this and do that and that's the end of it but what they couldn't see uh they they couldn't see that those scriptures those laws could not be kept they didn't have the understanding of that these Pharisees thought that that that God looked at the external that everything you do that I can see you know it'd be easy to it' be easy to know that everybody's in or out by based on just by the way they walk and talk and act are you with me if you're looking at people by the law it would be easy just to go in there and say yep yep yep nope nope nope yep yep and that's what they did but Jesus when he come onto the scene it says God looks at the heart don't don't don't tighten up on me don't tighten up on me this is not this is not a free pass I'm not talking about a free pass I'm not talking about a high way where we can do whatever we want because God knows what I what what's on my heart no that's not the way it works because the scripture also tells us us as if a man looks upon a woman to lust after her he hath committed adultery already in his heart so the heart is more than just than than than just God saying oh you can do anything you want and get by with it because you love me that's not what he was saying and but these Pharisees couldn't get the difference here but I want you you to notice here and we look at 1 Samuel here it says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or the height of his stature because he I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart now he's talking here to Samuel the prophet about going down and trying to find a replacement for Saul and so he's talking to Saul here in this scripture and brother bam says I want you to notice the Lord God said to Samuel go up to the house of Jesse and anoint one of his sons King to take Saul's place he said now the people chose Saul you realize God didn't want kings God said I don't want you to have a king and they said we want a king we want somebody that we can put before us somebody that we can lift up and Samuel said God does not want you to have that because God wants you to know that he is the king of kings and so now we see here we're in a dilemma Israel's chosen was not God's chosen and he tells samel to go down here to the house and I want you to go down here and I want you to to look at them and I want you to go before Jesse and and pull out all of Jesse's kids here and I want you to go through them one by one by one one and find my anointed one and here sets Solomon sorry back up Saul here set Saul here this fine big goodlooking handsome man that was chosen by the people they wanted somebody that could had stand up with a presence somebody that had some Authority somebody that that that that that that demanded respect and God says you chose a king you want a king so I'm going to give you a king of my choosing are you with me and so now he goes down here and he sends his prophet Samuel down there and he comes before Jesse and his wife now can you imagine that conversation when the door when they knocked on the door and said hey I wonder who that could be I don't know honey why don't you go see we're coming we're coming open the door and there stands the prophet of the hour Samuel the prophet of the hour has now come to your home and knocked on your door to what do we owe this honor come in come in let's have a seat let's talk about this what what are you here for well I I I have to explain this to you but you see Saul is not God's chosen King and God has sent me his Prophet down here to find a king of his choosing why are you at our house well that King resides here God's anointed one resides here oh Lord you imagine the conversation when he looked at his wife said honey come here and listen to this go get our oldest and and the word and the prophet tells us that he goes and gets the oldest child the oldest one and brings them out before Samuel Samuel being the obedient one he is he says tell me what you got oh look at look at our look at our oldest son he's he's educated he he's smart he's handsome he's tall he he looks like he just would fit Under The King Crown so Samuel thinks well if that's what they think I'm going to give us a try so he goes and gets the cruise of oil and he begins to walk over to the eldest and as he begins to pour God says [Music] no they're trying to give me another one of what I already got God don't need another one of what he's already got he's looking for something special he's looking for a bride in this hour somebody that the world rejects somebody that the world don't accept but it's God's chosen person for the hour so here he comes one after one after one after one the oil cannot be poured God stops him every single time and so they're sitting there they scratching their head now man what what we going to do honey we're running out of kids matter of fact we've run out I think I think we've run out and and Samuel looks at him and says Jesse do you have any more well well you know sometimes you get those conversations [Music] well and he says bring him to me well let's talk about this Samuel cuz yeah I will not sit down until you bring me this child but he's out of he's Ruddy looking he's wind burnt he's red from them burnt by the he's been out in the fields all day day after day he smells like a sheep it's just not what we're looking for Samuel says I didn't ask what you were looking for you bring me what you have and God will make the decision so they go and they call go get David bring him in here let him see this little Ruddy thing and can you imagine him coming in just a slim TR trim short Ruddy red sunburnt and here's his brother standing over here 64 250 benches 400 that guy and here's David but he begins to look at him and D David comes inight of the Prophet the prophet of our hour said that Samuel run and he got the cruise of oil and he run over to David and he begins to pour out the oil on top of him and anoint him and anoint him and anoint him why was that why was he able to because that was God's chosen King for the hour when we go through things in our life and you think man how am I going to do it it's when God begins to pour out his anointing on you and you and you and he Pours and pours and pours why because you're God's chosen vessel for this hour back to these Pharisees these Pharisees were so angry they were so angry at Jesus and and and they begin to look at Jesus and and they couldn't believe that he was ignoring their Petty interpretations of the law so these Pharisees here they begin to to look at Jesus and and say how come you don't follow the laws that we have how come you don't follow our Traditions sometimes Jesus you even violate them now can you imagine the religious leaders coming up to the the very God man think about this God in flesh and they're saying why don't you follow our rules why don't you follow our laws because as we begin to look at these brothers and sisters a lot of these little rules and these laws that were man-made ideas they were man-made a spin off of the message you caught that didn't you I can't tell you the number of times you can count on my fingers and my toes how many times I've had people say me to me brother brandham said who whoa whoa who really you sure he said it that way did he word it it different maybe come on church if we're not careful we see this happen around us and people begin to take quotes and say the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said into a place that a real son and daughter of God has to step back and say wait a minute I don't think he said that I've had people do me that way more than once and then when I say I don't think he said that well he told so and so oh did he now well now we're getting to where the rubber Meats rode so and so may have embellished it just a little bit so and so may have Twisted it over here just a little bit to fit their household but what I need need is this word of God delivered by the prophet messenger of the hour I don't need anybody to spin any interpretation of this I don't need Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees saying this is the way we want to do it because Jesus said this no no no no no I want what Jesus said in red letter words if you're going to tell me the prophet said something you better be able to show it to me in his black and white words in a book if not I don't have time for it if you can't back it up with this or the message book in print with a word verbal word behind it thank you brother hear say these Pharisees and these scribes they looked at Jesus and they said why walk not thy disciples according to the traditions of the elders did you hear what I said traditions they eaten bread with unwashed hands and he answered to him and I love his answer now this is red letter I love his answer he said well Isaiah the prophesied of you Hypocrites Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites as it's written these people honth me with their lips but not their heart they honor me with their lips but not their hearts their heart is far from me these Pharisees and Sadducees they prayed and and robed and walked and and saay through the towns swinging their [Music] incense you've seen them you know you've watched Chosen and they walk through and they parade through there and look like and they sound like we love the Lord we love God we're God's people but all on the inside what can you do for me what can how can you help me how can we how can we grow the church how can we do this how can we you see what I'm saying and so these Pharisees they be and Jesus says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines of Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God ye hope hold to the traditions of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things as you do and he said unto them full well ye reject the Commandment of God these people would say they have the Commandment of God and Jesus is looking at them and says no no no you reject the Commandments of God he said that you may keep your own Traditions you see we can't be so swept up and so bound down by Traditions that we cannot move when the spirit says move if you're not careful if we're not careful we become so traditionalist such traditionalists that every church service has to be a certain way you know the routine you know the routine what would happen Lord Lord have mercy somebody have a heart attack if we change the order so if we change the way we done something traditions and we hold these tradition and when we hold on to traditions we are gripping and binding the moving of the holy spirit this wasn't in my notes so somebody's pulling I want to see the holy ghost moving in our midst not just a bunch of traditions not just coming because it's 10:00 not just coming on a Wednesday night but I want God moving in our children God moving in our marriages God God moving in our jobs God moving in our homes you see according to their oral Traditions you couldn't go to work on Sunday at all oh Jesus's men was hungry Jesus's men the disciples were hungry so they go and they begin to pull the ears of corn off oh my goodness they step back and they begin look at this this is a violation Jesus of the Sabbath Jesus said don't you know what they did in the temple with the showbread don't you know what they did when they were hungry and they went into the temple and they took the showbread to eat and they just been to set back and then Jesus entered into the synagogue where a man sat with a withered hand can you imagine seeing this man sitting there our hearts our hearts are always will reach out to people that are withered and and and distorted and hurt and so Jesus Walks but he looks at this guy he looks at this withered hand and these Pharisees they begin to look and they're eager now they're eager now to look and just wait to accuse Jesus of breaking something on the Sabbath and Jesus begins to look at this man and they ask him CU they know what he's fixing to do they done called on enough to know that this man's capable and they know that he's able to heal they know that he's able to deliver they know that he's able to move on the scene of any situation and they look at him in this situation knowing what he's going to do and they say is it lawful for you to heal on the Sabbath this is right before he's getting ready to pour out his anoint his healing anointing onto this withered man and they ask him that question and I like how he answers and he answers their question by asking them if a sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath would not you pull it out if if so because I imagine they would have to say well let's uh let's see that's going to a sheep back in that day is going to cost me this much money oh yeah we're going to get him out we're not going to lose any sheep we're not going to lose a sheep because that's going to cost us so many daeri so many Franks so many of this so yeah we would have to get that sheep out so Jesus then looks at it and he says well if it's lawful to relieve the misery of a sheep on the Sabbath how much more is it lawful to relieve the misery of a fellow human being who is more valuable see it was about the money it was about their pocketbook and he says it's how much more is it to to for to heal a human who's more valuable than that of a sheep you see brothers and sisters their Traditions could not outsmart the wisdom of God in flesh so this goes on and apparently it goes on and and they come in not long after these two episodes Jesus is then moving on the scene and here we find a man who is blind and mute and possessed by a demonic spirit and these Pharisees begin to watch they begin to watch to see what's fixing to happen and Jesus comes down there and Jesus begins to cast out these Demons by the Holy Ghost spirit that's on the inside of him and they have no law that no no scripture no law no no decree anything they can put at him they say you know what you're just a devil a matter of fact you're be alub you're the chief of devils now you know he could have got an attitude he could have got a real attitude for somebody calling him that but let's think about what they did did they not blaspheme the Holy Ghost a sin that Jesus said was unpardonable they' come here now and they blasphemed the Holy Ghost and so there's lessons for that in in this for us Jesus in this clash of the Pharisees we need to be careful that we don't make our own man-made rules that we accept what Jesus is doing that we follow the scriptures that we're not trying to idealize what God is doing in our lives you know we try to make God's fit our plan that don't work we try to make God fit into our program well I'll do this God's going to allow me to do this so I can do that and this and be careful be careful because that's what the Pharisees and the Sadducees did we want to be careful that we don't become Pharisees the prophet said that when Samuel get back to to David here the prophet said that when Samuel poured the oil upon him he looked at them and he said God chose him God chose him he said see we choose by sight Pharisees they want to be they want to be looked at they want to be known they want to be seen everything's about a show any show we have is by sight and he said but they but God looked at his character he said God looked at his character it was the character that was like Jesus Christ and it began to manifest in him see he said it's not the worldly Beauty it's not that that attracts the bride it's his character the character of the church that Jesus looks for it's not in buildings it's not in programs it's not in in groups or meetings but it's on the inside it's on the heart it's not about that free P but it's about your desire for more of God your desire for God wisdom your desire for God's knowledge and for God moving in your life and he said he's looking for character he said he's looking for a day that the bride to be formed Hebrews 13 and8 just exactly like it was like he was you mean he's looking for for somebody to be exactly like he was not somebody to act like a Pharisee and to be proud and to walk with incense no he's looking for somebody that walks the way he did he's looking for somebody that's got to be the same as his flesh he said the same as his bones the same as his Spirit the same everything just exactly built up and them two then become one why could Jesus not become like a Pharisee oil and water don't mix their agenda was completely different than that of Jesus as he walked on the scene we've got to be molded into the character of Jesus Christ we got to be formed into the character of Jesus Christ turn with me to First Kings chapter 4 let's look at Solomon here for just a minute then we'll get into the queen I'm not going to be well I'm not even going to say it first Kings chapter 4 and verse 29 now I want you to listen to this and I'm going to slow down here because this this is this is some really you how many of us how many of us be honest and say we struggle with reading the Old Testament well this is a book in the Old Testament you shouldn't this is this is this is good reading right here and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largess of what heart even as the Sands that are on the seashore and Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East Country and all the wisdom of Egypt for he was wiser than all men than Ethan the azerite the heon the chaal the D the sons of mayle and the fame was in the All Nations roundabout and he spake listen now listen to this he spake 3,000 Proverbs did you read that he spake 3,000 Proverbs I told Jo other day I said I need to write down some of these little things I say that's kind of catchy well I found out I didn't have a whole lot to write down I thought it was pretty good the other day when I said you scenario mind that people get some narrow minded they can see through a keyhole with both eyes open I thought man I got all kinds of these let me think 3,000 Proverbs his songs were a, and5 what's that girl's name Taylor Swift she claims to be one of the biggest songwriters she's got so many hund 1,5 songs listen now he spake of trees from cedar tree that is of Lebanon and even unto the hsip that springeth out of the wall he spake of also the Beast and the foul and the creeping things and fishes and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon from all Kings of of the earth which had heard of his wisdom how did he get this wisdom have you ever thought it's in there but we don't think about it how did he obtain this such wisdom I tell you how it was is because his heart was right when when David died and he come up there and Solomon come up there and God was getting ready to anoint somebody to to to be over the people of Israel and he looked at Solomon he says listen Solomon it said God came to him I think in a dream and he began to talk to Solomon and he says ask what you will and Solomon looks and listens and he's he's talking back to God and he says listen I I I'm a nobody you see that's where a lot of people mess up they want to be somebody Solomon says I'm a nobody my daddy was great and here I am just a young man I think when he took over he was 20 years old he says I'm just a young man in the midst of your entire people I'm supposed to tell them whether it's good or bad or whether it's good or ugly I'm supposed to discern the thoughts I'm supposed to do all of this I just want to know more about how to do this I just want to know what I'm how I'm supposed to handle this that's all I ask for God you lead me you guide me you tell me how and you know what God's answer was to him because you've asked this you will be the wisest person before or after there will be nobody wiser than you you will know the answer to every question they cannot stumble you Solomon and oh by the way since you didn't ask for riches and treasures and gold I'm going to throw that in on top of it yeah you see what I'm you see how God operates it was his heart was right he was he was wanting to do what God wanted to do not what he wanted to do and so the wisdom of Solomon now is unmatched by any other when you think about Solomon you look at it and you say he's an author he's a songwriter he's a botanist he's a zoologist you name it he knows it it says there was not any subject that he was not the wisest of can you imagine can you imagine and here's this little Queen in a land far far away that's a fairy tale from a land far far away and she hears by passing and trade and people are going in and out of of Sheba and in and out of her territory where she's the queen of and she says I I I hear about this guy named Solomon they say he's incredible they say he's really something to behold I'm going to go see him so here the desire in this little queen's heart was to go and meet this meet this keing this little Queen she was willing to travel for months and months and months on the back of a camel now let's look think about a Pharisee she's willing to travel through the hot burning desert month after month after month day after day setting up tent watering camels doing whatever she has to do just to go hear the wisdom of the king the the discerner of the hour and the Pharisees wouldn't walk across the street to hear Jesus for five minutes do you see the difference do you see now why Jesus could say a greater than Solomon is here and the queen of the South will rise up against people like you this woman has a whole different level of dedication this woman has what most people you can't even imagine we can't imagine the kind of dedication she's got but she wants to grow in her knowledge she wants to get more of God she wants to know more about God and the prophet said that Solomon was a discerner of the heart and so here she goes and she comes into the presence of the king and what does the king do he didn't say now listen you should not have been on that Caravan on Sunday that's not lawful no he didn't say that the prophet said she be he began to zern the intents of her heart and he could see what was going on and and he looks out there and he's beginning to look and and he looks and he says you're a little Queen but he said the people that she was around said if you're you're going to go hang around a bunch of people like Solomon you see it's got to be that way you got to have that desire on the inside you got to have that drive that no matter what people say no matter what's going on no matter who puts you down no matter who puts you out they don't change what God is doing in here and that's the way this little Queen was she was hungering for God she was ready she was going to do it no matter what even though they said we'll excommunicate you how many people around the message of the hour has been kicked out of their homes been excommunicated not just the message of the hour just to accept Christianity in general you're out of here we don't believe that you're following a man you're following a cult you're in something that's not true I believe it's the atheist that's are the foolish ones I believe that's what the scripture says but here she was she got her Scrolls that she'd been reading she'd been reading the word and she gathered her Scrolls up and she says I'm going on a journey and she began to get into this journey she began to go down there and she began to get ready and get get all my camels ready ready get the Caravan ready get my goods get my spices get my gifts get my gold get everything ready I'm going to go see the king I said get your gifts get your goods get your worship get your praise get your Authority get your power we're going to go see a king and so she has it in her mind she's going to go see the king and she begins to head down here and the prophet said now remember there's one thing I don't want to leave out I'm going to take some money and she says I'm going to take some gifts and I'm going to take it's the truth and and he says if it's the truth I'm going to support it that's what her attitude was if this Solomon is the real deal I'm behind it I'm going to support it and if it's not I'm going to bring my money back with me and he says so all that weal there on these camels and he said I want you to remember the fleet Riders of ishmail were in the desert you know ishmael's bunch is a rough Bunch we still see it today they're merciless they have no mercy for nobody and so here they're out there in the desert and the prophet tells us that these desert robbers out there they could easily have tooken taken them and she could have fallen prey they would have killed them killed her killed her people with her her Entourage took all of her her money you know I got to think well just how much money it keeps talking about money the Bible talks about money the prophet talks about money she's got gifts she's got gold so let me put this in perspective this little Queen meant business I mean business brother Joe she was in the materials business 120 talents of go gold well how much is a talent of it no 4.5 tons of gold let me break that down to you in numbers we can somewhat understand 10,000 pounds of gold 10,000 lb of gold at 16 o a pound that's 60,000 o of gold are you following me brother Joe says yeah I know where you going you talking some serious numbers here 160,000 ounces of gold on today's market value of $2700 she carried with her $432 Million worth of gold she didn't need need the king's money she just wanted an appointment with the King let me tell you we don't need the king's money he owns a cattle on a thousand we don't need the king's money we need an appointment with God we need a God that we can go before and ask him and talk to him and commune just that's all she wanted I just want to communicate with the King $432 million of gold when I say she meant business she meant business she took Church serious you know last time I preached I guess it was last Sunday right last Sunday yeah I preached and I begin to tell you some of the numbers The Staggering numbers of the decline in Christianity well the next day I had a met I met with a guy just a nominal guy and then we were he began to talk church and and and we talk and he said you know he said I heard something this week that just staggered me and I said what was it and he said this is Todd County now he what he made sure to stress that to me now this is Todd County he said this was a poll that was taken in Todd County the government done it of this County and he says full-time Church you're considered to be a full-time churchgoer if you go to church one service a month do you see the hour we're living in you're a full-time churchgoer if you go to church one service a month I thought well praise the Lord because surely everybody in Todd County goes once a month no no I was kind of hurt he said do you want to know what percentage of people are considered in Todd County to be full-time churchgoers I said 85 90% he said 16 16% are considered full-time church goers they go at least once a month she travels across the hot burning desert on the back of a camel for some say 12200 miles across the desert just to go have an appointment with the King there's something about it though that says when you're really determined and when God is revealing himself and God is revealing himself and you're determined to see Christ there is no more danger in front of you there's no more fear in front of you you don't really care what the people think you don't care what your old friends now say about you those things don't matter anymore why because you got an appointment with the King [Applause] the appointment with the king is the only thing that matters the prophet said she'd come up there in this and and she'd come there but before the king and she was sitting there and she was just waiting to hear from the King and of course he dramatizes it with the with the me meetings that was going on and he says she heard her prayer card called he says she heard her prayer call or prayer card called and she come up there and he says uh she begin to sit up there she came before Solomon and said when she come to stand before Solomon that God knew all her Secrets isn't that something that the Pharisees come with an attitude of you don't tell me what to do and she came with an attitude of God I'm an open book God if there's anything in my life that's not pleasing to you find it if anything's holding me back find it if I've done anybody wrong find it why because she wanted to be right before the king I want to be right before the king you want to be right before the king God reveal myself to you you know sometimes it's hard it's hard for us as humans as Christians as humans to open oursel up and be open even before God in our secret closet because we tend to hold on to those things we begin to We tend to hold on to little grudges little isms little habits little influences that we have they're mine they're in my secret place they're in a place that nobody knows but not her I'm an open book she stands before The King and I want you to watch what the Bible tells after God had began to reveal himself and he began to say everything to her and began to tell her of all of her all of her experiences and everything that she she had been through everything that she had gone through everything she was her heart's desire had been revealed to her you remember that $432 million dollar she said I want you to have all I've got she gave her gifts to God sometimes as as Christians we come to the house of God we worship God we praise God but do we really give him all of our gifts do we really really give him all of our talent do we give him the 120 talents that we we toted in here today now I'm not asking you to give you money I'm talking about your gifts I'm talking about you singing I'm talking about you witnessing I'm talking about you worship I'm talking about you praising I'm talking about you clapping I'm talking about you dancing I'm talking about you shouting why is it we feel like we can't dance I mean my goodness Donald Trump to the YMCA we've got life to its fullest we've got a kingdom before us how we ought to shout how we ought to dance how we ought to sing from the rooftops she gave all of her gifts you say well I don't know what God would do with it let me tell you what he did with hers he gave the money she gave the money the 432 million and it said boats begin to come in from her area she had cargo ships begin to sail in the the great Timbers from her native land Timbers like you said you have never seen before she took he took those gifts King Solomon took those gifts and said I'm going to take your gifts that you brought me and I'm going to use them in my temple he built the porches of the temple out of the trees that she sent over that's what you call pouring out and giving back to God how should we do that how much more should we do that in this hour that we're living in God has done so much for us he's revealed the very words the message the of the hour the church ages the seals marriage and divorce serpent SE these are things that people just it blows their mind I tried to talk to a Baptist pastor friend of mine and I tried to explain serpent said he said you really believe that I said I sure do there's no other way I can see it there's no other way that I can open this book and make it all connect from this page to this page without that very Doctrine because it's the forces of Good and Evil it's the forces of right and wrong it's the serpent seed under my foot so we wi this hour as we come to a close how many would say God allow me in this hour to come before you but come to the king's high as I walk down the King's Highway through desert through heat through storms whatever it is allow me to come before your very Palace porch and open my heart up accept me for whatever I am God because my true desire is to serve you with all my heart I want God I want you to have all of my gifts I want you to have all of my talents let's stand to our feet listen to what he says here he dwells in his word and his word comes into your heart and it speaks itself out and declares he interprets his own word through you you see the Pharisees they wanted to interpret it through themselves but he interprets his word through you he's trying to find somebody he can get a hold of to show that he is still God can you imagine when she sat there before the king in Solomon's Temple and she sat there and he began to reveal himself Time After Time After Time and she would say well King what you what about this oh that's simple and he began to tell well King what about this oh that that's easy it it happens like this and he begins to reveal message after message after message he said but he he if he can get somebody that he can speak to if he can get another woman listen now another woman with a blood issue he can still speak the same thing he can do the same thing making known declaring we're in the presence of God when she stood Before the Throne of the King Solomon she was is in the very presence of the king let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus for this day you've given us for the services today and for the time of Fellowship the Saints have been able to share Lord we trust that all that's been said was been pleasing to you today and

Lord youve spoken to our hearts we thank you for that Lord Lord we want to be like that little Queen was as she walked as she journeyed as she she went through whatever the the situation whatever the desert situation was she was determined to get in the presence of the king and not just hear not just get in the presence of the king but to hear what the king would have to say to her so that she could learn and she could grow and she would she would begin to expound herself as a as as the lady would before the king and Lord us as the Bride of Jesus Christ we just want to be in your presence Lord there's no greater desire we have than but just to walk and to live and and be in your presence to hear you to worship you to serve you to love you with all of our hearts Lord when the road gets rough Lord give me the determination that that young lady had to get into the presence of the king we love you Lord we ask a a blessing and and we continue to hold up Sister Bor before you Lord as the the devil just trying to torment her and and and Destroy and and and sear her body but Lord we know that there was blood shed on Calvary that there was healing in the stripes that was placed on your back that there is no demon there is no torture there's no sickness no disease nothing that could stand before you father because as that blood was shed there was a there was a healing that take place for everyone that will accept you as their savior you're still the great physician Lord so we lift her up and we hold her up in the days to come as as she fights this battle and we're believing for a 100% healing a testimony of Deliverance a testimony that that that Satan had to get his hands off and that she's free and her body as well Lord we just ask Lord that you go with us tonight Lord as we
