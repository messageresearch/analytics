be in the house of the lord amen praise the lord good to see everybody out this morning amen we just greet you in the name of the lord amen you can be seated for a minute i want to give a little that'll be all for the music i don't think it's the this is the first of the month the second did we do birthdays last week we didn't all right well comes to my mind so let's do dude birthdays yet if we can birthdays and anniversaries why not praise the lord without having to carry in certainly it's kind of easy to forget isn't it all right brother joe you're not in the doghouse right no all right who praise the lord glad to hear it all right praise the lord everybody has a birthday all right hold on for your comments more yeah 61 isn't it yeah all getting up there for sure aren't we sisters jeanette was talking last night a little bit time does 5 fly fast amen so god bless you a happy birthday to you a happy birthday to you [Music] birthday to [Applause] [Music] all right august all right anybody has any anniversaries mike and grace how many years you know 13 years seemed like yesterday don't it already married 13 years all right let's sing a happy anniversary [Music] happy anniversary [Music] amen praise the lord god is good isn't he amen so uh just a couple reports here uh before we get started i talked to brother jim um d-o-d-d that's right i always get it b it's a d-o-d-d all right dodd up in uh vancouver the one that took care of our last missionary offering and i was just trying to get a feel on where things have went and how things have went and so he said they haven't been able to build any buildings because of the code but over there so they've been kind of on lockdown and so they haven't been able to do any of that they may in the future they plan on doing it in the future whenever things get to where they can actually do that amen but so i asked well so basically can i ask what the money was doing and he said that that it is actually there's only about 30 percent of those folks that have even have a bible so he says they've been buying a lot of bibles for them and so they're trying to get you know get them to where they actually have a bible so that's good isn't it and then also there's a lot of translation at this time he says there's a whole lot of translation going on of the message into their language so that's wonderful so instead of building buildings right now i guess so that'll be all that's all good it's getting the word out there and that right so it's just really wonderful i believe that uh you know bram said you can never go wrong doing missionary work so we want to take our middle of the year i guess we'll take one offering here at the middle of the year and we'll think about first of december maybe taking another one either december or january but anyway i think next sunday if it's all right with everybody we'll take our middle of the year a missionary another missionary offering and i told uh the deacons and everybody i said that i talked uh text a little bit back and forth with brother daryl and so either this may get to him but that's all right um but anyway he's not been been able to minister and he doesn't have a secondary job and all so he said just pray for me he said you know it's you know you can't preach with this corona and so forth you know he's had that for the last little while and so we want to take portion of that if it's okay and give it to him would that be all right let's try to help brother darrell out amen because he's certainly a real man of god and amen so we'll take a portion of that next week amen and and do that with that so and also i think that john me and john talked about having youth meetings or whatever so maybe that's on a small scale but after the last few weeks i don't think we'll do anything as far as youth this year okay because it's really getting or getting around in it amen i'll tell you what my heart goes out to people amen like i didn't even know brother bruce and them had it amen but uh amen these are certainly perilous times that we're living in isn't it perilous times we're living in and this pandemic i know you know it's all over the world amen not just here in the united states but it's everywhere so but we are thankful that i guess the actual mortality rate of it all is down so that's good all infections i guess and so forth is up mortality rates are down so that's a good thing at least in our state so the way i see it uh you know right now is worse than it was here last round that we actually shut down church for a couple of months and so uh we do know that it's all around us and now we can certainly see see it a lot more so i know there's different ones you know that are working at the nursing home so if anybody is working if you're working with people that have covet and so forth and you chose you choose to just stay home and we would probably prefer you did to just stay home and stream if you have direct contact with somebody like that because you could easily be a carrier and we know that if it gets on one and amongst a group like this it can spread pretty fast so we want to try to avoid that we want to take whatever precautionary measures that we possibly can okay and so i don't know if brother steve has talked to you this morning did did you say anything to anybody where's brother steve at oh there you are okay you talked to everybody at the door to try to keep the distant thing thing amen so that's very good let's keep that up and i see that we have certainly had some way back up there brother tommy tammy good to see y'all way back there amen praise the lord it's all right to go out there but i don't have corona so we do have a few empty seats out here in the front but that's all right too it don't bother me one way or the other but amen it's kind of different up there ain't it and pretty neat i'll tell you what the balcony is a pretty neat place amen it's pretty cool so praise the lord but anyway so um let me think of anything else so let's just all be careful all right and we'll pray for those that uh certainly for uh i think sister joyce and hannah i think they work at the nursing home and so forth so we'll remember them in prayer because we they we don't want them to catch it amen and they do help people that are infected by it so that's a real sacrifice and a real uh patriot on their part i believe to help people like that and so we'll continue to remember them in prayer amen and so but we'll continue on i don't believe that it's a time to stop uh amen i believe that we need to keep continuing on amen and just trust the lord in everything and serve him and just take what precautions that we can and we are certainly in the lord's hands and trust him life or death we are in his hands and trust our lord and savior and we're so grateful to have a god like what we do amen so praise the lord certainly um i really appreciate the lord and what he's been saying to us and speaking to us amen and we appreciate your prayers amen because i realize amen that this place right here is a very sacred place very very important and very um very sacred and a big responsibility amen to stand behind the pulpit here amen and to speak to god's people and to lead god's people and to influence you in the right direction and to have the inspiration of the holy spirit to lead the church in the way that we should go how many believes that's important so we do covet your prayers we thank you for your prayers and we we thank the lord jesus that i feel like the messages that i received from him amen it's just i just want to say that it just comes seems to come perhaps i listen better amen than what i used to but it just seems to come a little easier than what it used to and so i thank god for quickening his word to us amen um any other announcements that anybody can think of amen just want to say we appreciate each and everybody and we will certainly keep different ones on our prayer list like whether uh the tit bells of course only knows them by the bruce and them then brother jewel forney how many remember continue to remember brother jewel forney he and uh just quite a few different people that we need to just remember we need to post with don if you'll remember we need to do a little bit more make sure we get some of these things posted and then sister jeanette that was kind of a shock finding out that even she's they found something down in her that they're gonna get and find out just what it is but we're trusting the lord that all will be well amen and then for sister susan these are all very uh real needs amen and we trust the lord we'll do a miracle for her amen and that this will get rid of that cancer that it'll be rebuked in jesus name and that shall live a full life amen because we know that when satan does something like that we have a place that we can go to and claim our victory amen so we know that god still does amen how many believes he's still real he's still a healer he's still a deliverer and we appreciate god amen for who he is so before we start i'll just tell you where my inspiration come as i was praying and asking the lord what to speak on this morning and that scripture came to me to seek the lord while he may be found amen from there we'll just go and see what the lord will have for is that okay so stand with me we'll go before the lord in prayer kind heavenly father as we approach your throne of grace once again lord and our hearts and our minds we just can't thank you enough for the right to be able to approach your throne father to be able to speak to you directly lord jesus father having a clear channel between us and you to be able to speak father and for you to speak back lord we thank you for calvary having made this possible for us lord for what you have done lord jesus that you have bridged the gap between god and man and now lord jesus we're back in fellowship with you we're back in being led by the holy spirit like adam was before the fall having every right that he had before the fall father and lord jesus we ask god as we look at these different rights and the things that you have given us lord and father the privileges that you have given us lord the opportunities that you have given us father and this morning we want to take and speak about taking advantage of those opportunities and those privileges we ask god for your inspiration for your ability and that you would just say whatever you once said this morning father and lord as your people have gathered in your name we believe god that you are in our midst this morning we believe that you are here we ask god for all of these requests lord this morning that has already been mentioned father that you would go to each and every individual and grant them the faith to be able to overcome lord jesus and father to have complete victory and joy in their lives lord father we ask god not to just bless the opening of the word the reading of the word the meditation of our heart our gathering together in your name we ask it in jesus name amen and amen let's turn first to first corinthians first corinthians and i want to talk about and i'll title this this morning obtainment obtainment in first corinthians the ninth chapter and verse 24 know ye not the day which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain remember we're talking about obtainment and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainty so fight i we're going to talk about running we're going to talk about fighting this morning not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection least that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a cast away over in isaiah 55 this is the scripture that came to me when i began to think about this message and when the lord began to just kind of pour out the message to me and wednesday night we talked about being privileged what kind of uh how privileged the people that we are amen so this morning we want to talk about taking advantage of those privileges taking advantages of those privileges it'll also go along with what we have talked about how a few sundays or wednesdays ago when i used the latter for an illustration amen it'll kind of go along with that also isaiah 55 isaiah 55 and we'll just read one verse there seek ye the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let's go to another scripture yet in first chapter of proverbs chapter 1 of proverbs verse 23. turn ye at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you because i have called and he refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have set at not all my counsel and with none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh and when your fear cometh as destruction and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and should be quiet from all fear of evil may god had his blessings to reading the words you can be seated this morning isn't that a wonderful wonderful scripture amen you know there's a lot of scriptures that talk about seeking the lord amen seeking his face you know you might wonder but the lord does like for us to seek him and it's a real privilege that if you ever get away from the lord if you ever stray away from the lord one of the first things that has to happen is you have to begin to set your heart your heart has to change something has to turn in your heart now right something has to tell you you know i don't like the direction that i'm going here i don't like the way that i am i want to go in a different direction because from the heart it goes to the mind and from your mind you begin to turn around and you begin to repent you begin to go a different direction amen and then you begin to seek the lord and you begin to talk and you begin to realize where you're at and so forth and you know and it changes your whole course of your life amen and he i like that because he says you know seek me while i may be found there's another scripture in matthew the seventh chapter verse 7 matthew 7 70 says ask and it shall be given unto you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you praise the lord is that right think about it that's the promise of god oh my when i think about what malachi 4 what our prophet taught us just the thought that he taught this one thing and that was that whenever you get born again and by the way of calvary by what jesus did for us on calvary we are supposed to and have access to being in the same condition as adam was before the fall all right amen except for this physical body amen how many of those we're still looking for that to happen a body change but talking about inferior complexes talking about fear period talking about all of those things that came upon adam as a result of his sin that is all supposed to be taken away from you and from me now how many know that's a big mouthful we already said this morning that we're supposed to be in the same condition that adam was before the fall in other words we're supposed to be able to walk in the cool of the day and talk to the lord and have fellowship with the lord amen i have i don't know but you might want to practice this amen but perhaps when you're going through the day you know and and you're just good seeing the wonderful green trees out there and all your perhaps look up at the sunset perhaps you look at the clouds and the peculiar amen how that they're maybe a little different or beautiful or sometimes those clouds and those skies they'll become like a wavy ocean yeah i mean has ever seen them like that and you look up and you say wow what a beautiful picture and i believe every day that we ought to be so close to the lord that when we look at that and say lord father i sure am glad of how beautiful you made things and your creation of how i get to enjoy it and and you know i was thinking of just walking it just the other day and i was thinking of how i felt thanking the lord i was talking to him i said lord thank you for giving me the opportunity in this world of death and sorrow and sickness and where we're at how the world is but yet you gave me the opportunity to walk this walk amen to be young and to be getting old amen and to go through this life for the journey thank you lord for giving me the opportunity and help me lord to make the very best of it because i won't get to do this again you won't get to do this again dominique believes that we need to make the most of it we need to make the best of it we need to run this race with patience that set before us we need to live this life to its fullness i'm not sure where i have seen it somewhere i believe it was burt reynolds or one of those people i guess that's pastor it might have been johnny cash you know but they talked about he says you might waste a lot of things but he says if you waste time you have wasted everything huh why because you only have so much time and you realize as you get older you know you only got so many breaths you only got so much time and you don't need to waste it on the devil you don't need to waste it on the wrong things but you need to use it for the honor and glory of the lord because when we come down to that door of death there's only one thing that's going to matter and it isn't how many millions we have in the bank but it's going to make a difference of how we live for god it's the only difference it's going to make [Music] what kind of walk that we had what kind of life that we lived how did we act and how did we do and how did we treat people and what did people see us as huh are you with me this morning so paul he said let me run not with uncertainty not one that beateth the air but let's run to what to obtain to receive to make the goal amen now many believe we got a message that god has sent in this hour and that message and the word of god and what has been brought doesn't need any adding to it don't need perfecting huh no it's already perfect it's exactly what we have need of so there's only one thing left what is that that's for us to receive it to attain it to get it amen now i hope i'm talking to a perfect church this morning perfect individuals huh i hope i am be nice wouldn't it but the chances are we probably aren't but this one thing that i thought about this morning as i begin to i was i was thinking about the church and preaching this you know i do hope and pray that we will become a finely tuned church let's not be like a car that's running on three cylinders when it's got eight huh a bunch of skipping and missing huh how many wants to walk finely tuned with the lord amen so i got to thinking lord i begin to pour it out you know he said seek me wow i may be found because there'll come a time when people will want they'll desire but they won't be able to get to the lord how many please we're privileged people but you know it doesn't matter how privileged you are if you don't take advantage of that privilege all right shall we start for one thing that we seem to do one thing that we seem to do is that we're always seem to be looking back we human beings we have a tendency to have a spirit like a frog all right always looking back looking back even as preachers a lot of times now we know that faith comes by hearing hearing testimonies of the past right of what people have done of what they have attained of how they have uh you know possessed the promises of god how they were great people through the spirit of god amen now you take for example abraham lincoln you know when you say abraham lincoln in your mind you think about a man that was honest a man that fought for righteousness a man that fought to free the slaves isn't that right man that watched them be sold on those blocks up there and separate it and he says one day i'll hit that thing if it costs me my life it ain't right you realize it wasn't right am i right think about abraham because why that character went with abraham lincoln amen let me think back of george washington we think back of daniel and the lions then we look back at the three hebrew children we look back a lot of times at knox finney calvin we look back we have a tendency to look back amen when it comes to religion most churches are teaching a historical god or a historical religion or on a founder a man that led perhaps a movement many many many years ago such as martin luther john leslie even pentecost isn't that right and people have a tendency to look back but about him he says it this way in 55 he says listen he said i feel so bad today when people try to make god something in history i want to ask you something what good is he god of history if he isn't that same god today oh my what good is this bible if it's something from yesterday if it ain't the same today what is good is the god of moses if he isn't the same today amen oh my he is god today he's risen from the dead he's here to prove himself he's still the same god we talk about a historical god what's the matter tonight the church has been taught in some historical thing and not put it down to a present day what good is he god of elijah if he isn't god today what good has he got of moses that delivered the hebrew children and so forth what good is a god like that of history if he isn't the same tonight oh my what good is he god that walked the banks of galilee back younger open up the eyes of the blind made to death and the dumb to speak in the ear healed the sick the lepers raised the dead if he isn't the same god tonight what good is he hallelujah amen praise be to god that's right amen and notice how that even with moses's mother how many that moses's mother no doubt taught him the story of how that her and her husband had put him in that water in the nile amongst the crocodiles and had committed him to god and had seen that he was a special child and told the story of how that it floated down and pharaoh thought it fought this little hebrew child floating and she wanted a little baby so she snatched it out of the dial said i'm going to raise this as my own but i don't need a wet mother and so go get amongst the hebrew chip mothers amen and call a wet mother amen to give my child suck in the raisin amen and it went and got the very mother of the baby and that right told the story of the miraculous and how god had done amen and thought all these things were taught moses but let me ask you something one day he thought well maybe i am deliverer amen and she believed that he would be there to deliver your delivery you're the deliverer amen he and his carnal self believed his mama's testimony is that right but listen what i wanted the point that i want to make this morning is even your mom and dad sometimes we look back to what mama says we look back to what daddy says and the experience that they have but that doesn't do you do any good it didn't do moses one for the good. amen he thought in himself yeah i'm a deliverer and i this egyptians is beating this yeah this hebrew amen he took and he slew that egyptian right amen what he tried to do in himself turned out to be a massive failure and all of what he was going on as some previous experience or somebody else's experience turned out to be a total failure how many knows the seven sons of siva whenever they were trying to do what paul did amen trying to do the same thing it turned out to be a complete failure amen why because i want you to know this morning that when it comes to god when it comes to fiery furnaces when it comes to lions and the alliance dance and everything else you don't need somebody else's experience you've got to have that own experience you got to be able to say no my mom and my daddy you know they had an experience but i have my own experience i'll tell you this is what god did for me not a historical god of your parents even or your pastor or your church we always like to hear oh we hear these great testimonies of people but we are where are you at let me tell you something i truly believe oh my that now we are the shadrach meshach and abednego we are the daniels we are the esters for such a time as this stephen every one of us could should be able to say this layout to see a wretched satan's eating sin everywhere debauchery everywhere homosexual just a complete barrel of messy sin satan's eden can you imagine that's what the devil's eaten smoking drinking just everything you can imagine that's eepless wrong around us but we can say first like esther you know esther was a great woman remember right because she took up for the jews she stood up this was her time how many believes this is your time this is your time and for such a time as this thomas byler was born steven young this is your time this is your hour in the midst of a lukewarm lady rich and increase with goods have need of nothing think they have everything lukewarm halfway mediocrity kind of world church world huh god has called you to be on fire and to be hot for god not lukewarm not mediocre huh this is our time we talk about we say three hebrew drum how could you do it you was gonna it was gonna throw you in that fire what do you do you is going to die daniel the same way we think he's such a hero when how how did you do it 68 million down through the dark ages how did you how could you walk into that arena and have them lions come towards you and tear you to pieces be thrust through with the sword all these things be burned into saying how could you do it your hero huh but i've heard before and i kind of tend to believe that on that day they'll come and ask us in the middle of that sin and that lust and that that temptation huh in the middle of of being able to get anything you want wherever you want and become whatever you want in the middle of all of that how did you survive how did you survive leonisia huh let's see how many beliefs it's our time amen how many knows that god don't have any grandchildren in other words well my mama my daddy's a pastor he's a preacher when you get out there guys i'm going to say oh you're the preacher's son yeah come on in huh how many does it don't work that way god don't have grandchildren you can't go by the experience of your pastor or your mama your daddy you have to have your own experience it has to be real to you young people or it'll never hold it'll never hold somewhere down the road your colors will show as a matter of fact as a pastor i can tell you i can preach you everything that you need to know huh i can warn our young kids not the world marry or date worldly people and everything else alone amen tell them get him in the church get him back see if they'll accept god first hello you can tell them all this stuff but it don't do nothing they do it right anyway you can tell them don't go down that road what will they do go down that road why don't hold them it has to be a personal experience with them with the lord amen brother stephen here different ones i've used even this church say hey huh they just went out on a message perhaps went out there and tested as a result today they stayed by their self that's what you might have to look forward to does that do anything for them no it still doesn't do nothing i'm going to do it anyway why because people need a personal experience with almighty god how many believe we need that you don't need the god of yesterday you need a god of today how many needs a savior of today a filler of the holy ghost this morning that's what we need i got saved at 20 years old the lord done something in my life and i'm still here huh i didn't go by somebody else no i said god come and help me lord i need your help please save me lord i don't know which way to go but here is my life here is my all and i'm here to testify and if you get to the right place and you meet the right conditions god is gonna do the same things we talk about pentecostals we talk about people of the past we talk about how people acted in the holy ghost what kind of church services they used to have you used to have but i want you to know that we are not people of a has-been where are people of them now how many believes that this morning that's what god is this morning amen praise the lord we have a lot of sick people got people with cancer huh they don't need a god of history they need a god that's present the god that was with them needs to be here now i believe that the god is the same as he always was but i'm here to tell you this morning attaining it attaining these things huh let's just be real honest people have a real hard time attaining it receiving it in other words getting it that's what paul said it's not about running huh but it's about getting there huh how many believes that it's about getting there he said many run in the race many are running they're all running that's all part of it but it's not all about that it's about receiving it it's about getting there it's about possessing it how many believes that that's what it's all about amen praise the lord because the bible's promise is that if you ask you might get it it shall be given unto you oh my oh my and if you believe we're we're taught now let me go in this direction we're taught that first you have to accept what god has done already how many believe that in other words you have to accept that god has already done it for you amen it's a finished work but how many times did jesus say according to your faith so be it unto you that's where the fight comes that's where the battle comes is that faith huh remember i believe it was i'm thinking it was blind was it blind martin amos or was it the story of the man had a child that was sick i'm not sure which story it was but anyway remember jesus said you know he said if thou can't believe all things are possible remember the man saying back remember what he said lord i believe help thou my unbelief in other words it was a really hard situation but yet jesus was telling them anything is possible if you can believe it and the man had to acknowledge god help me with my unbelief i believe that's where the problem is today is that unbelief [Music] we might say that we believe but you have to genuinely believe if it ain't a genuine belief you'll be disappointed right now that if you would have genuinely believed it would have happened amen everybody can say amen to that because the bible says if you'll truly believe it'll happen so the problem is with you not god problem is with me not god the problem is with us not god because if we believe when we come to the place that we're supposed to come to it's going to happen how i long how i fierce for myself and for every one of us to get to that place that when we truly believe to something we see it manifested [Music] huh isn't that right how many is with me this morning because it's rare amongst the message believers it's rare amongst us people getting their healing is rare and it's according to our faith amen sometimes it takes a pressing too passing through you have to seek the lord amen that i come to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him diligently seek him buddy robinson he got serious isn't that right let me just say this before i forget to sometimes you have to get sick and tired of being sick and tired huh sick i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired i mean i feel so much until i'm sick of failing i refuse to fail anymore huh you got to get plum sick of it are you with me this morning sometimes you got to get diligent desperate about it amen praise the lord buddy robinson what did he say i'll tell you what that old cornfield went up in that cornfield he says god if you don't fill me with the holy ghost first of all i wish i could remember the story correctly i'm not sure but you'll probably you know he was plowing or something in his old donkey or mule or whatever kept acting up he got so mad he went bit his ear in other words the problem wasn't so much with the donkey as it was with the with buddy because why he had a temper problem and that old thing would get out of the holing line and start plowing out in the middle of the field and he jerking around and then it'd just be a stubborn old thing and he got lost his temper i could see the other guy like a monkey crawler biting that thing's here what a spectacle to behold right he was caught back down he says man i lost it again oh i'm so sick of this i've done this yesterday i did the thing before i'm so tired and i'll tell you what i'm going over here i'm gonna die i'm gonna die then mules will starve they ain't gonna get no water my wife's gonna wonder where i'm at and everything else but i'm gonna go over here and if god don't fill me with the holy ghost and take my problem away from me he's gonna find a pile of bones huh it was a battle isn't that right it was a fight but what happened he got it how many believes that when you come according to the scriptures if you're willing to say father mother brother sister land whatever it takes forsake your own life also then you're ready to follow me but if you're not willing to forsake yourself you still want your ways and do things your ways and think it your way you want to do all that no you're not worthy of him yet that's why you don't have victory that's why you don't have joy unspeakable that's why you aren't in a place where you're saying i need a second me to hold some more of this good stuff hallelujah how many has the joy of the lord praise be to god in the midst of this world it's easy to get the what did brother chill call it wows you are owes you wooz is that right whoa whoa ah come on folks but brandon even said he don't mean for us to intend for us to walk around like that listen to this oh my now that's the people today if you'd only see when i tell you about divine healing you say well brother madam look i was prayed for last night now i can't even move a hand anymore that don't happen with it sure god give it to you oh my them israelites why sure god didn't just get up there and take his brush and sweep them all out now come on in here you are sit down god never did do that show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my works you've got to go do it see and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have every man that is born again of the spirit of god knows that you you have had to fight for every inch of ground amen sure how many believes you got to fight for it if you want to know god in a real way you're going to have to fight for it you're going to have to fight doubt you're going to have to fight self you're going to have to fight the hivites and the hivites jebusites huh all of that you got to fight all of that get over top of it he was referring to joshua the first chapter he says moses my servant is now dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan amen we can say it all afternoon talking about how that we need to go get it know what he said go get it you want it you go get it you want it ask for it didn't he say ask me and i'll give it to you seek me and you'll find me it's not good enough that he's there unless you find him i mean you got to find him all right these people and all right arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i have given you as i said to moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the greater river the great river euphrates all of the land of the hittites all of your land of sorrow all the land of your depression all the land of your doubt huh all of the land of your problems that this world offers for you and has for you all of the physical problems that you're going to encounter huh all of this i've given you until the great sea towers are going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of the life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsaken can we say this morning as god was with brother branham history so god will be with us how many believes he's still here but you know there's some conditions listen to what he says only be a jellyfish be wishy-washy be strong and of good courage in other words have courage god hates a coward for unto this people shall not divide and inheritance the land which i shall swear unto their fathers to give them remember a couple of wednesday nights ago we talked about how the brotherhood said when you get the holy ghost amen it's like inheriting a whole great big warehouse full of stuff amen and if you can't get it up high enough get a ladder climb up there and get it huh all of this have i given you oh my all right unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong how many believe this is an hour not to be weak but be strong paul said finally brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god you know right put his whole lord abroad paul that's how he wanted the church he wanted ephesians to be strong in the lord to be hot for god to be on fire you know that's a simpler being on fire is simpler than what you think huh i was thinking about and i thought lord just let me burn let the people watch me burn huh let my neighbors watch me burn let my workers watch me everywhere i go lord just let people see me burn in other words just have that fire down on the inside somebody needs something you go help them you do something that's that fire burning it's not running around the aisles hiring sure that's part of it perhaps but your fire is to burn constantly wherever you are down on the inside you love to push play you love to read bible and you love to prey that's it burning how many wants is burning i mean god that's how i want to be i just want that fire burning in my heart be strong that's one of the requirements if you're going to see a god be a reality to you today is that you have to be strong in the lord if you don't want to see anything stand in your way then be strong in the lord and in the power of his might this is one of the conditions i believe amen all right that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to right hand or to the left amen that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest but this book of the law shall not depart out of the mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shall thou make thy way prosperous and then shall thou have good success how many believes that oh my listen to this now you've got to do it you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have all right you've got you them every man that's born of the spirit of god knows you've had to fight for every inch of ground he says you've got to tow the mark with satan amen kind of draw a line in the sand huh draw a line toe the mark here you are you're coming no further that's it huh but let me tell you something else this story don't draw a line here if he's stolen your joy and your peace and your health and whatever it is say devil i'm coming on here and i'm grabbing whatever's mine and i'm going to put the line way back here because you that took too much from me i'm taking it back huh how many believes that brother brown talked about he says man if you've got fine find somebody squatting in your house huh it's time to get the authorities and get them out all right now let me finish here well listen so he says toe the mark with satan isn't that right friends he said this is not a picnic this is a battleground we never come here to eat cookies let us just have a nice picnic and honey you bring some cookies and bring some good baloney and whatever it is and a good beef hot dog and we'll roast it no that's not what this is all about just a good time it's a battle how many believes it's a battlefield sure you got to battle through every everything that comes your way all right and so forth we're in a battle listen well anything that satan's put upon you in the way of sickness or whatever it is take a moment and think if the devil has done anything to any of you this morning taking your joy away taking your confidence maybe trees the holy spirit i don't know what it is but whatever the devil has done how many knows he says whatever it is that he has done every born-again person has an abstract warrant from god and the holy spirit is here to put any devil out huh praise the lord how many knows cancer is a devil cancer is a devil and he gets on people huh sure just like any a lot of those other things are devils that come upon sometimes no matter now notice the holy spirit here's put any devil out no matter if he is cancer tumor cataract whatever he is the holy spirit will put him out if you'll serve notice to him in the name of jesus christ because he's got no legal right no legal rights i am the lord that he loved all thy diseases is that right he was wounded for our transgression and with his stripes we were healed but you've got to go over and take it amen go over and take it oh my praise the lord you got to go and take it through prayer through believing how many believes that how is it that we fight how is it that we fight most of our battles is on our knees right here this is where we fight our battles the devil will tell you well i'll tell you what i've been trying to get the holy ghost for so long and i still ain't got it remember the one man that came to brother baby said brother ma'am i've been wanting to holy ghost for three years i know some of y'all can tell me what he said huh why are you not believing huh why are you not believing because if you truly believe the way you should you wouldn't be waiting three years for it huh unbelief and sometimes we think we believe when we don't really huh how many believe we need a real touch from the lord that we might attain let's not just run let's not just beat the air but say god here i am every promise in there is mine but we have untapped resources and a lot of times we look at that as being in the word or being out there somewhere no though i believe the valves to those untapped resources is right here in our hearts i truly believe it that it's right here amen why because brother brown said he made it very plain that if any person you take a sinner and any person that'll meet the requirements of the holy spirit come to the same conditions meet the same conditions that somebody else before them had him in the holy ghost will come and baptize with that person you will absolutely be filled with the holy ghost but they've got to meet those conditions and that right that heart in there it's got to be turned just right and so many times you know we've gotta so fight and battle amen even sometimes we gotta oh my we gotta fight doubt sometimes so many times we gotta fight well i don't know i don't know but you gotta get over that you gotta get past that and say god i believe your word and then rather than goes to explaining how to receive it and he says maybe you're paralyzed and you can't move nothing and he says you know you begin to say god i believe that i can move my finger i believe i can move my finger and the only thing that moves is your finger just a little bit just a little bit then he goes on to sand keep believing keep asking god you don't think it's a it's a fight how many believes it even receiving your healing or so it's a fight through doubt you got to barrel through that doubt and once you get that out of the way it's free sailing how many of these when that doubt goes to subsidy amen the more doubt that goes out of our life the more of these promises are going to be real to us i have to ask myself the question everybody has to ask yourself them questions perhaps we're not as strong in the lord that's what we think or more of these things would be happening in our midst huh because they should be how many believes miracles should be happened the very same god of moses and all of those he is he's here i believe he's with us but you know we've seen so many people die brother herbert and not get healed until it hurts our faith doesn't it it hurts our faith but i'm here i truly believe this morning that god's still the same he hasn't changed problems not with god it's with us perhaps our sincerity level because remember he says be courageous let this be in you day and night don't deviate it from right to the left huh and then what then you'll be successful but let's admit it sometimes we let our minds go to the right or to the left immediately let the outcome in because it is it truly is according to our faith how is it that uh brother branham could be there and the holy spirit could be there and certain people in the audience they'd get it and others would not get it back to thinking about brother bam says you'll fight he says it many many times every promise belongs to you but i guarantee you this one thing if you're gonna get any of it you have to fight for every inch that you get you got to fight doubt you got to fight i believe you got to fight things that you know you got to fight through it all brother bannon one time you remember when he wanted his own healing he wanted his own healing so much and from what i gather from what i gather about what brother baby said it wasn't some great spiritual revelation it was simply he said that i took god at his word and i said i believe that by his stripes i am healed amen and in front of his mama in front of his daddy amen the doctor says you ever take a bite of solid food it'll kill you dead you know right he began to eat onion he began to eat stuff you know and he went oh he was sick for days he was so hard would just make him cringe he was so hurt hurting bad throw up and swallow his puke back down he was fighting he was battling for his healing is that right but he defied live or die huh how many believes it has to be a live or die thing it has to be that desperate that god i need you now i mean i need you remember the woman with blood issue right the woman with the blood issue she came and she believed with all of her heart if she would just touch the hem of his garment isn't that right and she touched the hem of his garment and she was made completely whole how many believes if you touch if you'll just touch the hem of his garment you will be made completely whole but sometimes it takes desperation just like blind bar named bass remember him and brother bam says he was blocks away and he was screaming oh son of god help me help me he was yelling help he says if opportunity is passing by my opportunity being able to see is passing by i can't let it happen i can't let it pass by oh if the world would just see this morning that the opportunity to be saved and to live forever is passing them by it's right there if you'll just come and seek it they could have it how many believes that on the day of judgment that will be their judgment no i offered it to you i laid it out there but you did not want it that's what he's going to tell him you did not want salvation because i had my arm stretched out i provided it it was there don't talk to me about not saving you huh i put it out there i gave it to you but you was too busy with your horses you was too busy with your land you was too busy with your oxen and your marriages and everything else your world is too busy you did not ever take it serious you did not seek me diligently you didn't want me with all the art god loves when the when the righteous cry unto it the lord hears him amen desperately seek him see god hear him amen lord if you don't heal me i'm gonna die right here huh watch what happens mamas that would go back in their bedrooms because their son was at war and he's world war ii and he's probably to die in there praying all day think about the prophet of god going in that cave and being there for a long period of time before the angel ever came long periods of time do we pray that long no we pray for three minutes and god don't do it hey you know it's no wonder we don't get nothing he went there for days until the angel came and said you know if you heard huh daniel the same way but that's the way it's going to be lord here we are amen praise the lord in the cave just wait there wait for god to come those that diligently seek him amen blind barn was he was heard god heard him he called her his cry and he went and healed him brother bram says that's how we have to do sometimes he called them god's little spiritual cry babies he says a little child a little baby has no other way of getting what it wants to no don't give it no button to push huh no bell the ring cry he says that's what god sometimes wants us to cry out to him he loves when you call out to him say god i don't know what to do here i am buddy robinson he got the baptism of the holy ghost brother branham got his healing and that right he was healed after a few days they said brother about him you lied you didn't feel any better he was throwing up meeting your own people you said they just come by and ask him how you doing brother man i'm doing fine huh think about it you get prayed for if you ain't bitter by the next sunday you get paid for it again next time that you get prayed for it again you get paid for it again you're just hurting your own faith well it didn't happen last week but tuesday you say well it didn't happen last few times either huh i mean believe there comes a time you have to drive a stake saying i'm being prayed for here i'm committed to god and i'm going to go and begin to act like it's already done huh it's time to rise up sometimes in your healing or your salvation or whatever it might be it's time to rise up well he had pre peter in them had had they realized he had faith to be healed what did they say don't stay there but raise up get up and walk get up and go how many believes brother brown he began to eat he began to rise up say i'm eating i don't know if it's also what it was but who's gonna kill him if he ate too much of it you gotta be beginning god begin to see look at that say look at there look at there he really does believe me huh how many bees that's what we need we need desperation in our life desperation to be courageous courageous have courage don't be a wimp amen oh my be strong and very courageous because he was wounded for our transgression bruce for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed folks i don't know about you but when it comes we talk about heaven we talk about the rapture you know right we're not looking back how many believes we're looking forward i'm looking forward to the rapture brother brown even says you know we don't look at what cotton knox and calvin and all those but we look to now and the future i don't want to be disappointed today i want to attain like paul said unto the resurrection i don't claim to have already to attain to it but i follow after i put those things behind me that are passed how many is glad for it every day you can get up and say god forgive me for yesterday's failures here's a brand new day i missed that for new starts i like new starts hey man if you haven't exactly done all the way you're supposed to do you still have you still have the opportunity you still have the privilege of saying here lord here i am let me start anew maybe there's somebody in the morning so i don't know why i said that but maybe there's somebody's morning see i kind of need a new start lord i need a fresh start brother says we get the baptism in the holy ghost but we need a lot of refillings of the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen and that's there how many believes that when you ask god to forgive you you know he does because you feel it in your heart well it's not just for salvation it's not just forgiveness it's not just for give me the holy ghost it's for healing it's for whatever it is that we have need of that's god's there i am believing and i am praying that we're going to see more miracles more of the power of god because i truly believe that i heard i heard brother bam say in him tape yesterday he says you know how was it anymore something about how he could have done with moses no abraham how he could have had them to have a baby you know in their young life and so forth and and he could have done that so they could grow up with their children you know and enjoy them but he waited until they were old and couldn't have him anymore he says like why does god do stuff like that he says because god loves to work miracles i mean god loves to work miracles he loves to do it i mean being carnal me and you if we had that kind of power we would probably show off a little right we'd probably say look what i can do well he's not carnal but he's god and he loves to show his power my question is every one of us are we willing to receive it and say god let me see your power i need your power this morning amen whether it's this layout is a age that causes this to become kind of haphazard or whatever it might be whether it's healing whether whatever it might be amen so how many believe that these things don't always just come real easy they come with much prayer even whenever the disciples couldn't cast out that child with epilepsy i believe it was couldn't cast that devil out jesus said why couldn't you cast a bow i'll tell you right now why you couldn't cast them out it was because of your unbelief isn't it strange they could cast everything else out but when it came to that one they didn't have the faith they didn't have the belief for it because he strictly directly said because of your unbelief however he says this does not come out by prayer and fasting so what does prayer and fasting tell us that it will increase your faith amen so that prayer that fasting that dedicate it increases it increases it jesus was the master and he was prayed up when he prayed for it it was all done amen so let me just close in saying this i say lord jesus to myself probably all of us say help bow my unbelief help our unbelief lord because that's where that's where the problem lays is our unbelief that's the only thing that's the battle that's the biggest battle that's the that's that's where the war is amen let's stand this morning how many will be in prayer for all the different ones and for god to continue to protect the church here amen every individual all of us because we truly are living in perilous times my friend perilous times because paul said perilous times would come and we're i truly believe we're here but the midst of all of that i'm thankful that god gives us how did he put it here i believe in isaiah know his proverbs whoso hearkeneth but whosoever hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall not be quiet for fear and shall be quiet from fear of evil how many likes to play and stay in that place where the holy spirit is where it's quiet the devil can't rattle you because you're in that quiet place because you found the lord you found that shelter you found that rock to hide under it doesn't matter how much the wolves cry how whatever it is there you are in that quiet place before the lord let's bow our heads search your heart this morning i've searched mine and i've said to the lord father help my unbelief i want to be completely rid of any unbelief in my life lord how many out there would say you know if it's truly just unbelief that's holding me back then lord help my unbelief lord help my unbelief god bless you god bless you god bless you up there balcony god sees you lord jesus we come before you lord and we realize lord jesus it doesn't matter how look and how hard the condition is you still speak to our hearts as you did those in the bible when you said if thou canst believe all things are possible and lord we still say father help us help our unbelief lord for we know that these promises are ours there you it's your word that you have given that if we would ask we would
